[],,redcookiestar,,,[],,,,text,t2_jgrpx,False,False,[],"It’s not just about the healthcare system but also the reaction of the state, country and the state of the social welfare system.

My own country (Australia) locked down pretty quickly at the start.

Western Australia and Queensland locked their borders down so fast and hard to every other state and international and when they realised this was serious. Then the Northern Territory and Tasmania and South Australia followed soon after.

The difference is they had state leaders who basically said F* this, no, and decisively despite opposition just slammed the borders shut and even now are playing hardball and refusing to open despite the entire country having nearly completely beaten covid - or being cautious, because they just aren’t willing to risk it.

Contact tracing in those states was pretty good. They went into various stages of lockdown at the start, Western Australia put homeless people into the hotels to get them off the streets when the hotels had to go into lockdown and had no customers. The government paid the hotels to house them so the hotels wouldn’t go bust and so people who were vulnerable were safe.

Canberra was good with contact tracing and was able to avoid much lockdown or border closing.

In NSW and Victoria (Sydney and Melbourne) they didn’t close the borders. 

In NSW it nearly got out of control - F* up with contact tracing and the cruises docking - and in Victoria it got out of hand because contact tracing went off the rails. 

Victoria nearly became like the rest of the world. They were out of control and climbing as fast as everywhere else.

The difference here being that, the rest of the country was doing okay and the having the support of other states behind them and basically that one last push to get over the line for a covid safe country they went to the extreme.

They went into complete police lockdown. Curfew. Regional and city and suburb style border closures. You could only be out of your home for a certain period of time, for certain reasons. The majority of businesses had to close. 

If you didn’t adhere to these rules, the police would fine you and if you resisted, they’d arrest you. It was that simple.

But In saying all that - they didn’t leave people with nothing.

Our government has been paying $1100 as a couple each every two weeks (so a two person family would get $2200 every fortnight plus you could take up to $20,000 out of your retirement fund that every working Australian has - employers pay 9%-11% extra as part of your contract into a super fund that you access for emergencies or when you turn 60.) 

They frozen rental evictions, they gave relief to the banks and utility companies so that they could pass those on to the homeowners and then down to the renters - you could get out of leases easier, you could negotiate a temporary rent decrease or a mortgage stop.

They had a scheme where businesses would be paid $1500 a fortnight per employee that they kept employeed too. The goal of this, was so that for example Target or Kmart could just close their doors and not go bankrupt but keep paying employees - to stay at home. Then when it opened again, they hadn’t lost employees, it was to save jobs and big corporations.

They gave bailout funds to industries that needed it. To stop them collapsing. A huge lockdown is a massive pain in the ass. Big companies still pay massive rents to the people who rent out the store space, amusement parks and zoos still have bills to pay and animals to feed. 

But the point of all this - is that when Victoria went into total lockdown - it lasted three months and was hell on earth for them but at the end of it what do they have to show for the pain?

Lockdown just eased for them. They are at zero cases a day. From 400-700 and climbing.... to zero new. Low mortality. They did it.

The whole country is at low cases now. Most are either under control or are from people returning home from overseas at which point they are forcefully quarantined in hotels for two weeks.

Is it harsh? Yeah. Very. But we got paid to stay at home and not everybody will agree with the government obviously but they didn’t totally leave us with nothing.

&gt;The good news is that the longer-lasting IgG antibodies persisted in these same patients for up to four months, which is as long as the researchers were able to look. Levels of those IgG antibodies also served as an indicator for the presence of protective antibodies capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 in the lab.

Do you know anything about the manufacturing process of a vaccine? Do you know anything about the refrigeration needs during transport and storing and how that affects the whole supply chain?

The first two are an independent 10% or so for the average person worldwide.  Combining the others and we may, I'd guess,  have 100,000x more reinfections than confirmed ones.  This is still a tiny number. 

* Anecdotes of reinfection are everywhere but not that numerous.  If 25% of people could be reinfected within the timeframe I think they should be far more common.  Keep in mind though you still have to be exposed twice.  If we estimate 10-20% of the US has caught COVID then 2.5-5% should be eligible for reinfection and of those 0.25-1% would have been actually exposed again.  800,000-3.3m people in the US. It's this possible?

* If reinfection were even close to as severe we would not see deaths and cases decline in places with herd immunity,  like Sao Paolo, Manaus, and Delhi. But,  at least in Brazilian cities where mortality is tracked,  deaths spiked then dropped back to baseline. 

* Antibodies may wane in number yet still provide immunity.  The study linked here does not give any distribution of antibody titer counts,  which is a red flag for me. 

* Antibodies may not even be as important as t cells to protective immunity.   Unfortunately T cells are several orders of magnitude more expensive to study.

&gt; Face Masks  
&gt;  
&gt;In our systematic review, we identified 10 RCTs that reported estimates of the effectiveness of face masks in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections in the community from literature published during 1946–July 27, 2018. **In pooled analysis, we found no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks** (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.51–1.20; *I*2 = 30%, p = 0.25) ([Figure 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181938/figure/F2/)).

we also KNOW, that face- /surgical masks can be very harmful. this includes reduced blood oxygen saturation from them and increased blood co2 levels. both of which are dangerous and can lead to death:

we even got osha (**Occupational Safety and Health Administration**) whistleblowers coming forth about the insanity and harm of forcing masks onto the broad public:

and we also already got studies showing the MASSIVE psychological and psycho-vegetative harm coming from forcing facial masks onto the public:

this garbage article is just trying to demonize the people, who actually stand up for you and me and everyone and are also standing up for all our children and fight against the slave muzzles, that only do harm and 0 good. that is not my opinion, but scientific fact.

what is actually antisocial is to try to attack the people, who don't wear masks. what is anti social is also to create a hit piece to  try to demonize them.

the facts are clear and every day more and more people are waking up.

They are large European countries  with a much higher population and much bigger cities.
They have different social structures and it's very common for multiple generations to live together and they have a lot fewer single person house holds.
They have a less developed social security net, they don't have the same opportunities for home office, and so on.

In a way Sweden is an island similar to NZ considering how well Sweden's neighbors have handled this so far.

But still Sweden has failed so hard compared to the neighbors they usually compare themselves to (and also compared to most of the world).

But at the end of the day - it doesn’t matter what you eat when it comes to weight gain/loss. If you eat 3000 calories of lettuce a day, and only need 2000, you are going to gain weight. 

If you need 2000 calories a day, and only eat 1000 calories of chocolate, you will loose weight. Granted, your health will be crap, you wont have much energy, and your physique will be junky.

Quick review though which is that Memory B-cells are the ones responsible for neutralizing antibodies.  Neutralizing antibodies are the chemicals responsible for sterilizing immunity, which is the immunity that people think of as ""immunity"".  T-cells are split into CD4+ helper T-cells (which are responsible for activating other immune responses) and to cytotoxic killer CD8+ lymphocytes.  Those CD8+ T-cells do not attack virus particles like neutralizing antibodies, but attack infected cells that are pumping out virions.  What is important there is that T-cells are a line of defense that only responds to already-infected cells, which means there's an active infection.  Neutralizing antibodies prevent infection in the first place.

So, the widely mentioned study that SARS-CoV-2 infected patients had detectable T-cell immune responses 17 years later does not contradict the headline study here in the UK, and does not mean that those patients would have had sterilizing immunity and would be immune to reinfection.

We expect with this coronavirus, as with other coronaviruses that memory B-cells ""forget"" over time and that on a 12-24 month timeframe people will become prone to reinfection.  With seasonal coronavirus sterilizing immunity begins to wane after 6 months, after 12 months about 50% of people have lost immunity and after 24 months nearly everyone has lost immunity.  Because COVID-19 is a more severe disease it may produce more lasting immune responses in people that have been hospitalized.

We expect vaccines to produce initially strong B-cell responses similar to convalescent ICU patients and strong initial sterilizing immunity, but expect it to be lost over time, which is why experts have always stated that vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 would need yearly booster shots.  There will be at least some T-cell responses produced by the vaccine, but vaccines are expected to produce more B-cell than T-cell responses, another reason why booster shots will be necessary.  We do not know which vaccines produce strong T-cell responses and since we only have about a month of data on vaccines in humans we can't say how long any initial T-cell responses will persist.

The CD4+/CD8+ responses to the virus which do persist are what will eventually turn the disease into the common cold.  They will not prevent reinfection, but will blunt the disease.  CD8+ T-cells will get a jumpstart on killing infected cells and CD4+ helpers will spin up the immune response and start to stimulate production of B-cells and neutralizing antibodies again, and the course of the disease will look more like the common cold and less like COVID-19.   The 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza is a good example of this where cross-reactive T-cells to pre-1957 H1 envelope protein (from the 1918 H1N1 pandemic, which became seasonal influenza until 1957 when it was displaced by H2N2) protected older people so that the 2009 H1N1 was nowhere near as severe.  Older people still got infected, still got sick, still could transmit the disease, but they didn't wind up in the hospital/ICU and dying by the thousands.

BUT immunity isn't a binary on/off switch and there's levels of immunity.  Sterilizing immunity is what is necessary for herd immunity, and sterilizing immunity will be somewhat fleeting for this virus, and you don't get it from T-cells.",,,1603825615,{},gaavzhs,False,t3_jj6lht,False,True,t3_jj6lht,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jj6lht/uk_study_finds_evidence_of_waning_antibody/gaavzhs/,1603830138,2,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Hughes cited the political challenge with a state or federal mandate but asserts the same laws provide freedom for employers and schools to require their employees and students to be vaccinated. According to the article, Farley Cleghorn, a physician and global health practice head at consultancy Palladium, “Countries can legally mandate vaccination to cross borders, as with yellow fever, and schools from kindergarten to universities can legally require vaccination for entry, as in much of the world for the expanded program of immunization and with limited medical exemptions....If a vaccine is developed, employers may be able to require employees to become vaccinated and will have to evaluate accommodations for religious beliefs and/or disabilities,""

It will be similar to how masks are being mandated now, businesses and schools can deny entry for those who aren't vaccinated.

first of all, I'm a teacher and I can tell you it is NOT a mess.  Now, it does *not* replace teaching a child while in the room with them.

&amp;nbsp;

And yes, it is more difficult to help students, especially the ones in need.  

&amp;nbsp;

Every day, there's new things implemented to try and reach out to these kids (and all kids).  The quality of the education will not be the same during distance learning.  It WILL NOT.  But to make it seem as if no one is learning or the ones that need the extra help will completely bottom out...nah.  Kids will learn.  Many at lower levels than in-school.  Some at higher levels (I've really had some kids completely blast off during this time).  Some will be stuck.  There are kids that barely did anything while in school and now are doing even less.  With all kids, we reach out as much as possible.  If someone is disengaged, we reach out to the parents.  Set up as many ways of communication as possible.  

&amp;nbsp;

At the end of the day, there's only so much we can do, while in-school or distance learning.  As Trump said, it is what it is.  **Everyone is living with this pandemic for the foreseeable future**.  IF no effective vaccines are out there in 2021, it'll come time to decide what to do because this method is not sustainable long-term.  However, during an emergency and pandemic, I think distance learning is sustainable for a year or so.  I'd give it this whole school year, depending on how the vaccines and medications come out.  If meds (like the one the president got) and vaccines pass trials and are super effective, maybe my February or March we can start filling back in.  If it takes a little longer, Maybe next school year.


&amp;nbsp;

It isn't just the kids that are losing out in this situation.  And it is no fault of theirs, the parents, the teacher, the schools, the city, or the country.  This is just a reality.  Its a pandemic.  It is a highly infectious virus that kills people that are older, anyone that is not in tip top shape, or might have a pre-existing condition like diabetes or anything that doesn't put your body at 100%.  On top of that, it leaves lingering effects for possibly years (obviously can't be proven yet, but damage is being done and scientists and doctors are already labeling how certain effects to the body will take years to repair, if they do at all).

&gt;Critics of President Donald Trump’s trade war with China stress that  it has led to higher consumer prices, costly bailouts for American  farmers and mutual hard feelings. All these points are right as far as  they go, but they don’t go far enough. The biggest cost of the trade war  — measured in lives lost, lingering business uncertainty and a longer  economic downturn — is the lack of cooperation between the U.S. and  China on vaccines and other biomedical advances.  
&gt;  
&gt;Consider the U.S.  position. Since it’s impossible to know which vaccines for Covid-19  will be safest and most effective until the clinical trials are further  along and other studies have been made, the federal government has made  advance [purchases](https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/explaining-operation-warp-speed/index.html)  of seven vaccines. By pre-purchasing a portfolio of vaccines, the U.S.  can ensure that when the time comes to ramp up production, the companies  will be ready.  
&gt;  
&gt;The current portfolio is multinational, including investments  in Pfizer, Sanofi, AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson. Ideally,  there should be at least one Chinese vaccine included, but there is not.  
&gt;  
&gt;Obviously, given the rhetoric of the current administration,  using a Chinese vaccine would be politically difficult. You can’t call  it “the Chinese virus” and then tell Americans they ought to take a  Chinese vaccine. So the Trump administration has made no serious effort  to make a vaccine-sharing deal with China.  
&gt;  
&gt;Early in the process, some U.S. observers went so far as to sneer  at the Chinese vaccine efforts. But to date they have been impressive.  China has made the fastest progress of any nation, and it has several  vaccine contenders, with [four products](https://www.ft.com/content/ce9a4c98-49b5-4c24-9ff2-ed1c6a3f3412) now in Stage 3 trials.  
&gt;  
&gt;While final results are not in, data from Brazil indicate that the Sinovac vaccine likely is [safe](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-sinovac-brazil/chinas-sinovac-vaccine-is-safe-brazil-institute-says-idUSKBN27429E). The United Arab Emirates also is in the midst of testing the BBIBP-CorV vaccine in a Phase 3 trial, with results expected soon, just as China itself is actively testing the products. One recent [paper](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30832-X/fulltext) in the medical journal The Lancet indicated a result of “promising”  and also sufficiently safe. The matter is hardly settled, but at the  very least the Chinese vaccines are not dropping out of contention.  
&gt;  
&gt;China  is already administering those vaccines to its military and to some  employees of state-owned enterprises. The U.S. typically would be more  cautious. But China, with its extensive information-gathering  capabilities, is effectively conducting its Stage 3 trial in public, and  at an accelerated pace. Whether or not you agree with that policy,  Americans in principle can benefit because it is China is taking all the  risk and generating the information.  
&gt;  
&gt;Another advantage of the  Chinese vaccines is that they are designed for quick production and  rapid scalability. That could be helpful even if in purely biomedical  terms they are not the most potent products.  
&gt;  
&gt;In all fairness,  there is no guarantee that the U.S. would have been able to strike a  vaccine deal with China even if Trump were not president and there were  no trade war. Still, the Chinese have been very active making advance  sales of their vaccines abroad, often attempting to extract geopolitical  concessions as well. China also just [signed up](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-09/china-joins-who-s-global-coronavirus-vaccine-program?sref=EP6bV7CS) for Covax, the vaccine-sharing multilateral arrangement. The U.S. still has not joined.  
&gt;  
&gt;The U.S. should not offer international concessions in return  for a claim to Chinese vaccines. But it is quite possible China would  be open to a cash deal. China could also obtain the rights to buy some  U.S. vaccines, thus reducing risk on both sides, as a kind of mutual  insurance contract.  
&gt;  
&gt;It would probably qualify as a humbling  propaganda defeat if America turned out to need a Chinese vaccine. But  eating a little crow would be a small price to pay for a useful vaccine,  given the immense damage wrought by Covid-19.  
&gt;  
&gt;At a faster pace  than most people would have thought possible, China has become a major  player in the biomedical sciences. Trade with China isn’t just about  iPhones, soybeans and plastic toys at Walmart. These days, it is also a  matter of life and death. Maybe few Americans knew that when the trade  war started.

Past research has attributed income-based inequalities in young children’s academic achievement and educational attainment in part to differences in the home environment; that is, to differences in what parents do and the goals that drive their behavior. However, in our studies using data on parenting behavior and parental goals over the past 30 years, we found that income-based differences in parenting have been steadily decreasing. For instance, since the mid-1980s, low income parents have greatly increased the time they spend in enrichment with young children, such as reading to them, telling them stories, and taking them to the library. And, when we look at parents’ goals for children, we see a complete convergence in trends over time, such that high and low income parents today are equally likely to value children’s ‘thinking for themselves’ and ‘working hard’ over ‘being obedient,’ a trait low-income parents consistently rated as more important than higher income parents throughout the 20th.

￼

Consequently, economically advantaged and disadvantaged parents of young children share more similar parenting behaviors and goals today than ever before. There is some evidence these changes are benefitting young children too –Reardon and Portilla find that test score gaps between kindergartners at the top and bottom of the income distribution narrowed in the first 20 years of the 21st century after increasing from the 1970s to 2000.

The COVID-19 crisis, and the economic and social restrictions that followed it, threaten that progress. The pandemic has exacerbated inequalities in families’ economic, health and educational resources that will tax low-income parents’ ability to pursue and realize their goals. Decades of research describes the toll taken by job loss, income instability, and material hardship on parent mental health, parent-child interaction, and children’s development and we can see in emerging data from the pandemic that these phenomena remain true today.

Our respective research teams have been following hundreds of low-income families with young children from before the onset of the pandemic through this spring after its onset. One of these longitudinal studies is of 272 predominantly Latinx families of elementary school children in rural Pennsylvania, and the other is of 314 predominantly Black and Latinx families of preschoolers in Chicago. Despite the differences in demographics, emerging evidence from families surveyed between April and June of this year shows striking similarities in the ways in which three pillars of parenting – economic stability, parental mental health, and support for children’s learning – have been shaken. In rural Pennsylvania, for example, we found a substantial increase in the share of parents who worried they would run out of food before they could afford to buy more, just as parents’ reports of daily worry and depression increased steadily from February to May 2020. In Chicago, we similarly found that the share of families who reported struggling to make ends meet nearly doubled, from 13% to 23% from last fall to this spring. Not surprisingly, these same parents reported a substantial increase in their levels of stress. Disruptions in parent-child interaction are also apparent: Among parents in Pennsylvania, the share of parents who reported losing their temper with their children on any given day increased by 60 percent from February to May. In Chicago, the share of parents who agreed with the statement “I feel overwhelmed by the responsibility of being a parent” rose significantly from 8.9% last fall to 14.3% this spring.",,,1603760352,{},ga85tp6,False,t3_jir69g,False,True,t3_jir69g,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jir69g/covid19_could_erase_parenting_gains_of_the_last/ga85tp6/,1603765756,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

As an illustration: While Mississippi, the state with the lowest unemployment benefits, offered citizens an average of $213 a week, Massachusetts, the state with the highest, provided an average of $555 a week.


&gt;The CARES Act added $600 a week to existing state benefits through the end of July, significantly boosting unemployment benefits in every state. But most Americans may be waiting until they receive these benefits as many states have had trouble quickly processing the hundreds of thousands of unemployment claims coming in each week.

How many people who are out protesting are dying? Not that I'm turning this into a right or wrong, Left vs Right, Republican vs Democrat thing, but if this virus was really that dangerous as you claim, then why is protesting allowed? I'm not talking about the rioting and the Police force when reacting, I'm talking about the actual peaceful protests. Why is that allowed? If the virus is so dangerous and spreads like wildfire, why is protesting allowed at all? Do BL really M, or is that just a thing we say? If they mattered we would stop and prevent ""large gatherings"" right? 

I am not so heartless to say that the 200k+ people that died is an acceptable loss, but what I have an issue with is that less than 3% that have contracted the virus actually died worldwide, yet we encourage and allow protests and then blame certain people in the white house that the virus is not under control. 

The Governor's who allow their states and city's to host such large gatherings that some call riots and some call peaceful protests are the same states that are also dealing with increased numbers in cases. California for example. LA showed shots of protests with major streets being flooded with a sea of people protesting, and currently have or accumulatively have not, not sure which, 914,000 cases and now the Governor of California is trying to tell its people that they can't gather for the holidays. Why is it that the government has no problem with protests, but turkey dinner with the family is not? 

One last thing I urge you to consider. If this virus was actually as severe as we are being led to believe, then why are we not hearing more about the extermination of the homeless population. Wouldn't they be the absolute first to be effected by this virus?

Your link is five months out of date and is essentially just a puff piece leaning heavily on Abe (please) and a government advisor who obviously wants to tout low numbers as signs that his suggested policy course worked. But it clearly didn't. If it had, Japan wouldn't have gone from double-digit cases when that article was published to just shy of [2,000 a day](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/japan/) over the summer.

They didn't contain shit. And your own article bears out what I've been saying all along:

*Meanwhile, the government never made testing the priority it became in other countries. Japan has conducted 2.2 tests per 1000 people. For comparison, the rate in neighboring South Korea is 16; and in the United States, 43.*

Nor has this [changed much](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-japan-testing-idUSKBN25R17D) over time:

*But a highly bureaucratic approval process means Japan has one of the lowest testing regimes among major economies, carrying out about 14 tests per 1,000 people, compared with 36 in South Korea and 246 in the United States.*

*Patients wanting to be tested must go through telephone consultations, demonstrate they have symptoms or show they have been in touch with an infected person. Health ministry authorities must then approve the test and have in some cases refused to authorize them.*

The government is keeping numbers artificially low by discouraging testing. Given that hospitals were not overloaded even in most Western countries with rampant spread, the better overall health of Japanese people makes it even less likely.

Yes, if you tested your blood early, in the process of your body learning how to make this antibody, you could test negative. It takes up to 6 weeks for our bodies to learn how to make this antibody.

Ahahahahaha. You say comparisons done by laymen? You understand these are the top scientists in the world making these comparisons, right? Everyone is trying to understand what works and what doesn’t, and Scandinavia is literally the best example in the world of comparable countries. Literally Sweden and Norway are perfect candidates for different strategies and outcomes. On the other side we have... you. Saying “I don’t think we are comparing apples to apples”. With no evidence. No data. No articles supporting your point. Not even a talking point by a Swedish state paper. Just... nothing. 

&gt;Triage is not the same as collapse, if that is what you mean. You haven't sent me any sources, but I can show you an example of mine. There was a field hospital built to accommodate corona patients, but it was never needed and was later demolished when numbers improved. https://www.dn.se/sthlm/faltsjukhuset-i-alvsjo-avvecklas-anvandes-aldrig/

That’s not what I mean, and you know it. Here’s the evidence. I look forward to you providing some links saying my evidence is wrong. If you can’t do that, well you’ve lost.

&gt; ""They didn't try to save their lives. They were scared that the intensive care units would be overwhelmed and you couldn't take care of young people,” says Anders Vahlne, a professor of virology at the Karolinska Institute. “And so they were selecting [patients], a bit too harshly I think"".

https://www.google.dk/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-europe-52704836

&gt; ""They told us that we shouldn't send anyone to the hospital, even if they may be 65 and have many years to live. We were told not to send them in,"" says Latifa Löfvenberg, a nurse who worked in several care homes around Gävle, north of Stockholm, at the beginning of the pandemic.

&gt; Healthcare staff in Stockholm have previously warned of unclear guidelines and that patients needing intensive care are not receiving it despite there still being several hospital beds available in the region.

There’s no doubt that the Swedish government let people die who should have received care and would easily have lived, and that this is one cause of the ten times higher death rate. 

&gt;Of course it suffered, but it did not crash. An export-oriented economy will always suffer during times of crisis but a collapse can be prevented. And it was.

Wrong. It’s funny how you want to assert things absolutely without comparison to anywhere else. “Crashing” is not a scientific term, you can’t just subjectively say “Well I don’t want this to be a crash, so it wasn’t”. The economy suffered as much as the rest of Scandinavia. That’s the only data point that matters unless you’re a fucking mongrel. 

&gt;I don't think the comparison is valid, so I will not. Is that difficult to understand?

I know you don’t think. Unfortunately for you, **your opinion is absolutely irrelevant**. You keep surprising me though - do you actually think your opinion has any form of value? Do you actually think I’ll go “Oh well he doesn’t think it’s valid, guess that argument isn’t true”? Here’s the trick - scientists everywhere in the world consider Scandinavia the best possible comparison, especially in this exact case. Do you understand? **Do you realize that “Well I don’t think so” is not a counter argument to that?**

&gt;If you want to criticise Sweden use the actual figures, ~6000 deaths. The last months it has been around 2 a day on average. Majority of deaths 80+, less than a thousand total under 70.

No you dimwit. When comparing countries, you use per capita rates. Otherwise you would only ever look at China, Russia and the US. Sweden has the 12th worst outcome in the world. In absolute terms, 5400 people have died needlessly.

Sweden has had an enormous amount of deaths per head of population, 5880 deaths representing 581 deaths per million population.

The message being sent out is way off the mark and being “somewhere in the middle” of two perceived extremes doesn’t always mean being sensible, it can just mean people are afraid of being seen as “extremist” (by what and whose standards?) - and that’s what polarization does to many. It’s not exactly reasonable to meet for social purposes or to share a meal with other people in the middle of a pandemic that’s devastating the world, and yet not doing so is considered extreme (in part because there’s so many people fervently preaching the exact opposite). 

Granted, locking yourself up in the basement and not going outside even for a walk by yourself is way over the top, but then I really never heard of anyone doing that (though I definitely don’t doubt the existence of such people). But when a single infected person can set a chain of transmission that causes dozens, hundreds, thousands of secondary cases and ultimately a big outbreak, keeping your distance from other people instead of giving in frivolous wants/needs is actually the sensible thing to do. With nearly 8 billion people on the planet and a transmissible potentially deadly virus, if everyone takes precautions in moderation there will be still a lot of infections and deaths going on. See [this model] (https://statnet.org/COVID-JustOneFriend/) showing how meeting with just one friend maintains a level of connectivity a lot higher than a network with just essential worker ties.

&gt;This network is a lot more connected than the one with just essential workers.
Visiting your friend means that you can reach almost all the other households in your community, and they can reach you! That includes lots of people you don’t even know. The virus can easily travel from them to you and then far beyond to many others. All before you even know you’re infected. It’s a very connected, and effective, network of transmission.

One should consider that there are a lot of essential workers, so no perfect isolation there and more importantly that loads of people are meeting way more than one contact, so it’s not at all extreme to say that everyone who can isolate should definitely strive for that rather than staying somewhere in the middle. Trouble is, there was never a solid unified message on how serious the pandemic situation is and about the importance of really following the preventive measures.

It’s the same irony reflected that people in the ‘Red States’ tend to not realize how much transfer of funds goes from Blue to Red. 

So the social ‘safety net’ is, as it stands, under attack by the very people who benefit the most. 

To implement the kind of targeted financial and other support requires a bare minimum of infrastructure. It can be built but it takes time we don’t have. 

An example of this was Florida where the Republicans had deliberately crippled the unemployment system. When it became needed as a conduit for aid from the Feds it broke down. 

Another example was the direct financial support the Feds provided to citizens. To people who have lost their income the payments were a pittance. But the political reality required that funds be sent to huge numbers of people that don’t need it and provided the usual interface for well resourced corporate grifters to manipulation to their own advantage.

One case could hypothetically have acquired the virus as a close household contact of a previous positive case, with confirmed case onset date less than two incubation periods before the flight, and symptom onset in the flight case was 48 h after the flight. In-flight transmission was the only common exposure for four other cases (Flight Groups 3 and 4) with date of onset within four days of the flight in all but the possible tertiary case. This case from Group 3 developed symptoms nine days after the flight and so may have acquired the infection in-flight or possibly after the flight through transmission within the household. ""
So, actually the duration of the flight and the 17% occupancy might or might not have anything at all to do with 13 people infected. Some or all of them may have been infected before boarding.

I think that ploy was wrong from the start.

Yes , there had been shortages for about 2-3 weeks, but since the price went up fast, production picked up really fast because thousands of factories switched to making masks overnight.

&gt;  
&gt;Previously, the Ministry of Health had entered into an agreement with the AstraZeneca laboratory for the acquisition of 17 million doses, with an optional purchase option of 3 million doses when needed.  In order to be able to vaccinate all Moroccans, the government is currently negotiating with the Pfizer, Johnson Johnson and Casina Pio laboratories to acquire the sufficient quantity.   
&gt;

&gt;  
&gt;The goal is to vaccinate 80% of citizens over 18, while not excluding extending this campaign to the youngest. The vaccination operation will first concern staff in the health and national security sectors. Vulnerable categories such as people over 65, patients with chronic diseases and pregnant women, as well as civil servants and public transport staff will follow.    
&gt;  
&gt;

&gt;*Al Ahdath Al Maghribia* reports that vaccination against Covid-19 is not compulsory. The Ministry of Health will, however, launch massive campaigns to sensitize the population on the need to be vaccinated and the importance of guarding against the pandemic. According to the specifications signed between the Kingdom and China, the Moroccan authorities should receive, on November 15, the conclusions of clinical trials carried out on 600 Moroccan volunteers.    
&gt;  
&gt;It should be noted that the tests carried out in countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Argentina have demonstrated the effectiveness of the vaccine from the Sinopharma laboratory, as well as the absence of any harmful effect on the health of citizens.

Let me explain.

You had an overlap between flu season and covid. Limited testing. So it entered the hospitals. The first to be infected were those that belong to an elderly age group. Once you lockdown the spread will also continue at home but it will move to younger age groups that have less symptoms. So it became quite hard to understand how kids would be affected if they were in lockdown and had no symptoms.

Now the path is reversed. First it hits the younger (schools, bars, etc) then it spreads to older family members. That means once you have an increase in cases like we see it is extremely likely the younger population might be the primary vehicle of infection. And when numbers increase it might be too late.

I agree with what you say. They should have allowed only primary and kindergarten at first and monitor the situation.

One thing that must be said is right now there are many classes that have been forced to do online lessons because of outbreaks. And by law everyone having a quarantined kid under 14 must work from home or if not possible stay home and get state relief.

If that is the case, then well over majority must be immune so that the disease starves out and doesn't get passed on to more than 1 people by each sick person.

The answer is further complicated by questions of the length of the immunity granted by vaccination or by recovering from the disease.

From the beginning the Polish government has used the Coronavirus to continue its concentration of power, including introducing a series of draconian laws that have noting to do with protection. 

The abortion thing is vital to the discussion since they ran on an anti-science campaign of pushing false information (such as abortions for women, even if it would save the life of the mother, should be banned because it is somehow dangerous and damaging). How did they expect a government which DENIES SCIENCE to actually handle this well?

If you push bullshit lies about science, you get what you pay for. Italy had an overwhelmingly elderly population and after it burned through their elderly, it peaked and troughed. MEdian age Itlay is 51, median age poland is 40 (that's a massive demographic difference)

Something as obvious as saying different countries are not the same is so mind blowingly obvious that asking for a source is like asking for a paper proving that water is wet.

Now if experts are comparing the countries, so be it. We are not.


&gt;That’s not what I mean, and you know it. Here’s the evidence. I look forward to you providing some links saying my evidence is wrong. If you can’t do that, well you’ve lost. 


Prioritising those with a good chance of survival does not equal a collapse. If you want to make this about the definition of what a failure would be go ahead, but you have not proven anything.

If you want to see why it would be wrong, go back to my last comment and use googles translator on the linked article.


&gt;The economy suffered as much as the rest of Scandinavia. That’s the only data point that matters unless you’re a fucking mongrel. 


Again, it is impossible to be unaffected, but Sweden was among the least. About tied with denmark ending up in 3rd by a 0.1% difference. In comparison to *Europe* it is far better.

&gt;Here’s the trick - scientists everywhere in the world consider Scandinavia the best possible comparison, especially in this exact case. Do you understand? Do you realize that “Well I don’t think so” is not a counter argument to that?


If there is an actual scientific analysis you have, use that instead. You are a layman and your analysis is absolutely worthless to me. What I am saying and has consistently said is that due to the major differences in the societies a 1:1 comparison is worthless.


&gt;Please explain to me why having a ten times higher per capita death rate than Norway and Finland is not a failure.

That isn't true. A lot of time it is attacking the heart which is what makes the lung function diminish. Also cytokine storms.

&gt;We found that septic shock and multi organ failure was the most common immediate cause of death, often due to suppurative pulmonary infection.

&gt; in a cytokine storm, levels of certain cytokines soar far beyond what’s needed, and immune cells start to attack healthy tissues. Blood vessels leak, blood pressure drops, clots form, and catastrophic organ failure can ensue.

Can't find the data at the moment but I believe only a fraction of covid deaths are even from patients who went on a ventilator at this point.

The study asked people about their *views* on certain measures like masks and social distancing. From that, they drew conclusions about *actions.*

- “Do you think it is necessary to avoid approaching people as much as possible until the coronavirus situation is controlled?” (social distancing),

- “Do you think it is necessary to wash your hands and/or use alcohol gel as many times a day until the coronavirus situation is controlled?” (hygiene), and 

- “Do you think it is necessary to use facemask (that protects nose and mouth) in Brazil?” (facemask).

These questions ask for **opinions,** not about actions. They do not warrant any conclusion whatsoever about the individual’s actions. 

For example, there’s a local road with a 25 mph speed limit. Based on the size of the road and intersections and the buildings around it, etc, I think that it is unnecessary to drive 25 mph there - I think it is stupid and that 40 mph is a more appropriate speed for the conditions.

Through now the compelling one is that it's an US alliance thing. Trump and PIS sign the declaration (along with Hungary, Belarus and several third-world countries) that they're pro-life, Trump (soon) appoints catholic fanatic into the Supreme Court. We (nearly) outlaw abortion.

It's a quite uncanny parallel that PiS also stuffed our Constitutional Tribunal with their cronies (like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krystyna_Paw%C5%82owicz) disgusting piece of shit), which invalidated the exception in the leglslation that allowed aborting fatally-damaged fetuses, so it's not legal anymore.

As for the Constitutional Tribunal, here's what the en-Wiki says:

&gt; In 2016 Julia Przyłębska, an ally of Law and Justice, was appointed as President of the Constitutional Tribunal. **Her appointment is open to the challenge that it is unconstitutional because she was appointed directly by the President of the Republic rather than being elected by judges on the Tribunal, as required by Poland's Constitution**. Her controversial appointment brought the total of women on the fifteen person Tribunal to two.

Yeah, the organ responsible for interpreting the constitution is itself made unconstitutional. That's one of the things EU means when they tell about ""rule of law"" being violated here. It's a joke.

Arguably the *previous* government started it, by trying to elect new judges to it before old judges term expired. But *that* should be invalidated, not... this whole ridiculous clusterfuck: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Polish_Constitutional_Court_crisis

&gt; On 22 December 2015, the Sejm passed a law which reorganised the Constitutional Court. The new law introduced a **two-thirds majority and the mandatory participation of at least 13, instead of 9, of the 15 judges. Art. 190 (5) of the Polish Constitution requires only the majority of votes**.

&gt; Furthermore, pending constitutional proceedings had previously to wait in the docket[clarification needed] for six months, or under exceptional circumstances for three months. The Court is now bound to handle the cases according to the date of receipt. Judges of the Constitutional Court can be dismissed on request of the Sejm, the President or the Department of Justice.

&gt; The bill was approved by the Polish Senate on 24 December 2015 after an overnight session, and signed by President Duda on 28 December 2015. It has been said that as a result, the decision-making capacity of the court has been ""paralysed"".

&gt; **On 9 March 2016, the Constitutional Court ruled the amendments non-compliant with the Polish constitution. The Polish government regards this verdict as not binding, as it was not based on the rules introduced by the amendment, and refused to publish the verdict, a binding condition for its legal validity.**

So... **they tried to change how the institution enforcing constitution works - which is defined by constitution, making it obviously unconstitutional, the institution said the change is unconstitutional, but the government claims the institution's complaint is invalid because it doesn't work according to these new rules. Which are unconstitutional. To reject the changes they must, according to the government, accept the changes**.

They die from infectious disease contracted in schools, or from car accidents going to school. Fewer students and teachers would die if we kept schools 100% virtual forever. However, socialization and learning is important, and virtual learning especially for younger children is not a substitute for in person learning. Before COVID, we sent kids to school even though there was risk associated with it because the benefits outweighed the risk.

dude...Yeah, a kid can get something and die.  But the chances are slim.  I've been a teacher for 16 years now and there has never been a death of a student.  It'll happen, but not something common.  

With Covid19, there WILL be at least 2 deaths in one year.

OTOH, if a lockdown is to prevent hospitals being overrun, then yes, they work. They should be the last resort when all else has failed. But if hospitals are about to be overrun, that means all else ***has*** failed, and the affected region needs to lock down.

The night-time curfew is being implemented across Melbourne from 20:00 to 05:00.

The only valid reasons for leaving home during these hours will be work, medical care or care-giving.

Melbourne residents will only be allowed to shop and exercise within 5km (three miles) of their home. Exercise outside of the home will only be allowed for one hour at a time.

Only one person per household is allowed to shop for essentials at a time.

A further element of the lockdown is that the state's domestic and international borders were sealed.

Nothing California - or any other U.S. state has done or is doing comes even close. And the lockdowns used in China and Vietnam have been tougher than Victoria's.

So yes.  I am confused.   Did Fauci just run with the information the ""task force"" told him to?   Which is bad any way you look at it.

Or did Fauci and the CDC decide that PPE shortages would occur and therefore the American public should be misled so they don't hoard it, even if it IS for their own good?

1) Kids from the ages of 10-18 are likely just as good as drivers of the infection as young adults are. Lots of theories about this, but the studies (particularly the Korean study) demonstrate this is a likely true statement.

2) We know that COVID-19 is likely airborne under special circumstances, which is in enclosed spaces with prolonged exposure, and when there's inadequate ventilation and air handling. These are all circumstances that are present in schools. 

3) Most schools that the New York Times focuses on are schools in areas where there is low community transmission. In areas where there is high community transmission, the state refuses to allow those schools to release data, or is pressuring them heavily not to release data. Most school admins in those areas are pressuring parents not to go test and simply to quarantine. 

To say with authority that schools are not the drivers of the pandemic is false; they aren't the drivers when community transmission is low, but Isreal showed that when you have high community transmission the virus can explode out of control in school settings. Also, Texas has been in session for a few months now, and there have been multiple outbreaks down here, and the numbers continue to climb dramatically.

The observed deficits varied in scale with respiratory symptom severity, related to positive biological verification of having had the virus even amongst milder cases, could not be explained by differences in age, education or other demographic and socioeconomic variables, remained in those who had no other residual symptoms and was of greater scale than common pre-existing conditions that are associated with virus susceptibility and cognitive problems.    
&gt;  
&gt;The scale of the observed deficits was not insubstantial; the 0.57 SD global composite score reduction for the hospitalised with ventilator sub-group was equivalent to the average 10-year decline in global performance between the ages of 20 to 70 within this dataset. It was larger than the mean deficit of 512 people who indicated they had previously suffered a stroke (-0.40SDs) and the 1016 who reported learning disabilities (-0.49SDs). For comparison, in a classic intelligence test, 0.57 SDs equates to an 8.5-point difference in IQ.   
&gt;  
&gt;One might posit that people with lower cognitive ability have higher risk of catching the virus. We consider such a relationship plausible; however, it would not explain why the observed deficits varied in scale with respiratory symptom severity. We also note that the large and socioeconomically diverse nature of the cohort enabled us to include many potentially confounding variables in our analysis",,,1603816330,{},gaac3fa,False,t3_jj1s9s,False,True,t3_jj1s9s,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jj1s9s/coronavirus_long_covid_patients_left_with_lower/gaac3fa/,1603818106,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

No,  I'm saying it's propaganda in part because that is the intented takeaway.  It is propaganda in so far as it would be designed to elicit an emotional response by either side. The study itself is trite - let's just think about this -  people who are antisocial are less likely to do things for others. If a paper published a study showing that mask wearing is correlated with lower testosterone I'm sure you would agree that1 whilst it might be true it is still propaganda.

No I'm not. I'm just talking about it. I'm talking about how it is used to make people controlled. And what it is actually done as demonstrated in this thread is meant that people are unable to talk civilly to someone like me who they perceive as not conforming and therefore being a Bad Person.

The whole argument around T-cells and antibodies are almost entirely out of place in most contexts I've seen them (as a conservation biologist with papers in animal virology).

[],,porlos67,,,[],,,,text,t2_149fn6,False,False,[],"&gt; I think they'd have to do a door-to-door campaign.

There are three basic groups of people.  The first are people who are eager to get the shot.  Healthy eager people will go wherever they need to and are not an issue; just get the vaccine somewhere close to them and let them know where and when to be there. 
 For those who are eager but less mobile, yet are in situations with similar people (nursing homes, group homes, prisons, etc), you can send out a nurse to give the vaccine on-site.  The most problematic people in this particular group are those who are eager, but they live alone and can't get around very well.  For at least some of them, I'd expect that they'll have nurse ride-alongs with Meals On Wheels.  Some of the others will be vaccinated when they come into contact with the healthcare system, but I expect at least some of this group to be overlooked or left behind.

The second group of people are those who aren't interested in the vaccine: either they're anti-vaxxers in general, or they're against this particular vaccine (the virus is a hoax, a conspiracy, too rushed, etc).  The only way to reach them is an educational campaign.  Expect to see PSA's and ads debunking common misconceptions and pushing people to get vaccinated.  [Side note: it would be lovely if the vaccine is one of the ones that's inhaled, that would help with people who are scared of needles.]

Then there's the third group: those who are willing to consider getting vaccinated, but won't go out of their way to do so.  The thing here is to make it extremely convenient for them to get vaccinated.  I fully expect to see drive-through vaccination set-ups at schools, for parents when they're dropping off or picking up their kids.  In the south and midwest, I wouldn't be surprised to see a vaccine van in the Church parking lot on Sundays; that may work with some of the Orthodox groups here in New Jersey as well.  Basically, just find where a bunch of people are naturally going in their daily lives, and go there.

&amp;nbsp;

Of more concern to me is that most of the vaccines need two doses to work, and most of them work best if the second is given at a certain point after the first.  Making sure we get the second dose to people on time makes things trickier.  And it'll be even harder to keep track if we end up with competing vaccines.

An issue for states with small towns far apart from each other is the issue of keeping the vaccines at the proper temperature until administration; fortunately, that's not an issue for New Jersey.

And the final problem is another education issue.  The threshold for accepting a vaccine right now is that the vaccine needs to work for 50% of the people its given to, and it needs to either reduce contagiousness, OR reduce symptoms, OR reduce the death rate.

So you're going to have people who get vaccinated and think that protects them entirely.  At least some of them are doomed to disappointment because the vaccine won't work on everyone, while others will still get sick despite the vaccine working in them - they just won't spread it to others, or won't be as sick as they normally would have been, or they'll get very sick but they won't die.  But all they'll see is that they got the vaccine and still got ill, so clearly the vaccine is a complete failure.  It's very much the way the flu vaccine is these days: its designed to reduce your chances of getting the flu, and to make it less severe when you do get it, but **so** many people think its entirely useless because they ""still got the flu"".",,,1603760292,{},ga85po8,False,t3_jilhca,False,True,t1_ga7765q,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jilhca/nj_wants_70_of_adults_to_get_covid19_vaccine_in_6/ga85po8/,1603765695,2,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

They say immunity appears to be fading and there is a risk of catching the virus multiple times.

&gt;More than 350,000 people in England have taken an antibody test as part of the REACT-2 study so far.

&gt;In the first round of testing, at the end of June and the beginning of July, about 60 in 1,000 people had detectable antibodies.

&gt;But in the latest set of tests, in September, only 44 per 1,000 people were positive.

&gt;It suggests the number of people with antibodies fell by more than a quarter between summer and autumn.

&gt; The way the surgical and cloth masks are designed, most of the air that escapes is vented at the sides

Correct, because these devices are masks, not respirators.  Masks are designed as a _covering_.  Think of them more like spit guards.  They are effective at _reducing_ the amount of large droplets emitted by a source; however they do very little for fine droplets / aerosol -- and do not seal to the face.  In essence, they do a half-ass job at source control.  Better than nothing, but almost a year into this thing it's probably past time to stop hosing around.

Respirators, on the other hand, tightly seal to the face and are able to filter a significant fraction of the air due to both the seal and technologically advanced filtering media.

While NIOSH-rated disposable respirators are still in short supply, KN95 and KF94 devices are easier to find.  These are the Chinese and Korea standards similar to N95 in terms of filtration efficiency.

When a vaccine comes out, I think that will be the rationalization for most to just ditch all safety.

I can speak from experience on this to a certain extent. I’m a part of a vaccine trial, and I suspect I got the shot. I have a place that does antibody testing in my office building, but I intentionally haven’t done it because of the psychological aspect. 

Despite not knowing if I got the vaccine, I have found myself SIGNIFICANTLY less stressed, to the point that I have to tell myself to not wander within 6 feet of people at the gym and not to go join in on pick-up basketball games I see going on at my local park.

This coming from someone who has had severe anxiety during this pandemic leading to bi-weekly panic attack. 

It’s wild to me how just the thought of having some immune protection combined with society acting normal has just washed away like 6 months of being freaked out and taking major precautions. Instead of putting forth efforts to act normal, it’s taking self-convincing to continue precautions. 

Turns out, for me, a lifetime of normalcy really is the default I go back to easily. Almost a year of precautions hasn’t changed that.

This is to say, I think if me, an r/coronavirus redditer with major anxiety has this response... a big majority of people will to, especially if and when a vaccine is shown to give at least some level of protection.

Take the time to decompress after every clinical. Many people like those in your family will continue to deny the gravity of this pandemic even after they are directly affected by it. Humanity may be the most intelligent species, but it is far from the wisest. 


I don't know how many positive cases my team has been exposed to. There hasn't been 1 shift when we haven't been exposed to a **new** case. Not just *a* case, a **new** one. Now with Disney World open, we have patients from out of state flooding in to be tested. We report the results of hundreds of patients to the department of health every week. The risk of becoming overwhelmed is always high for us, but now the problem is the risk of becoming overwhelmed *too frequently*. 


I have to actively remind myself that my purpose is to help the patients under my care, that is all. There is no downtime in nursing because patient care is continuous. It is constant. The nurse works 24/7, but  the *person* cannot. You won't be able to do every single task for every single patient that needs to be done during your shift. So when those tasks pile up and you're running around like a headless chicken, stop. Take a deep breath and wash your hands (no one will bother you if you're washing your hands). After that, take another deep breath. One patient at a time. One task at a time. 


Thank you for helping us fight the virus. Even if you are not directly carrying for covid patients, know that every little task you do is one less for the nurses you're shadowing and that means so much to us. Time is precious. You're doing a good job.

Can't really blame politicians or experts either I think. It was a long time since we had a pandemic on this scale. Science is messy and they didn't have all the answers, and still don't. Usually these disagreements and discussions is had within obscure journals and scientific conferences that the general public never reads or attends. But the public and media clamored for any information at all and anyone who would say anything was heard and their answer's was picked apart and condensed to be easily digestible, with the expected loss of details and nuance. 

And while I think countries need to have plans for pandemics, people need to realize that not all pandemics are equal. Fatality rate, how the disease is transmitted, who are most affected, etc will play a huge role in what the response from authorities and the general public will be. The HIV pandemic is handled in a completely different manner than covid-19 and if we have a pandemic with a fatality rate of +10% (which is the case for some bird flu viruses) and/or children is very vulnerable there will be another response from the authorities and the public than what we are seeing today.",,,1603774984,{},ga8u7x7,False,t3_jifooo,False,True,t1_ga6gi9n,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jifooo/pandemic_fatigue_is_realand_its_spreading/ga8u7x7/,1603778074,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

and here is the problem.  One group doesn't want to put them in safely.  They're having kids go back to school with masks not being mandatory, no (or not enough) safety measures set up, and way too early.  

&amp;nbsp;

I've outlined when it would be ""safe"" (safer...not ideal but what can you do).  Once real treatment is out.  Once vaccines are out.  Personally, the treatments are looking like the safer thing.  Once they start to roll out, then we can safely start going into the classrooms with protections, guidelines, etc.

But your focus is ""get back soon"".  It just can't be like that AND be ""safe"".  

&amp;nbsp;

I'd be more willing to go back if the treatments were released and readily available.  Vaccines...less so but its another compromise.  

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;If a student or teacher is in this group or don’t want to come back, continue online. If a student or teacher is more likely safe that not and want to go in person, go in person.

Not enough personnel for that.  You'd need teachers for distance learning AND at school.  As I mentioned earlier, my school is setting up systems in which we'll be able to target both, but in all honesty, we're going to be paying even LESS attention to the ones online because now we need to concentrate with online students and in-class students.  Trying to tie them together but that's just dividing the class up more.  

&gt;What are the statistics saying and for those more at risk what can we do to protect them? 

Social distancing, masks, cleaning, not being in closed quarters with others.  A school, even with half capacity days, would still not allow for this.  And kids are still kids and will slip up more often than adults when it comes to masks/cleaning.  

&amp;nbsp;

You're talking about economically, intellectually, and mentally and I'm talking about health and death.  One of those should take precedence over the other.  Especially if it is  a 1 year thing.

&amp;nbsp;

I see treatments coming out sooner than later.  Vaccines are much trickier and I think they'll be held out longer until stronger versions are developed.  

&amp;nbsp;

As for the privilage.  Look, I want to live.  I want my students to live.  I want my students' family members to live.  It would mightily be desasterous if someone died from covid19 (or because of complications it causes on other conditions) because ""they needed to be back at school"".

&amp;nbsp;

Our fundamental difference is that you think kids need to be in school NOW because of the social and educational purposes while I think we can provide enough to educate from home and not spreading the virus...and it WILL spread.  

I agree with you that a long term plan will have to include going back to school.  However, you seem to think we're already in the ""long term"".  Nah, this is still recent.  Long term is more than a year for me.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Is that an excuse to let people fall behind

a pandemic and possible death is a perfectly good excuse.  yes. 4 teachers dying in the school (4% out of 80).  15 students dying because of going to school (3% of 600).  80 parents/grandparents/family members dying (4% out of 2000 that the kids in the school will be in contact with after school).  1 death is a tragedy.  4 teachers, 15 students, 15 family members.  That's a lot of deaths.  Now, this doesn't mean everyone in a school will get covid.  But the reality is that enclosed spaces mean a lot of infections.",,,1603766746,{},ga8hudd,False,t3_jik9j4,False,True,t1_ga8dwwv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jik9j4/chicago_public_schools_says_teachers_union/ga8hudd/,1603771996,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],1603767095.0,,

Since August, when Covid re-emerged mysteriously in NZ, we've had the following outbreaks:  

* [Cold-store cluster](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/coronavirus-covid-19-the-three-theories-for-augusts-auckland-outbreak/DMKFXSZH7IGOS3P7BWPWGR6GVU/) - still don't know who patient zero was. We caught it late so required a semi-strict lockdown of three weeks in Auckland to stamp it out. Became the country's biggest cluster to date and spawned a few sub-clusters. Wake-up call for the country.

* [Hotel maintenance worker](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/covid-19-coronavirus-the-case-hotel-lift-and-maintenance-worker-how-did-virus-spread/E277XGVJ6MCLENCJ7I7LU5NMMU/) who caught it from a quarantined returnee (the ""elevator button"" case). Identified early and didn't spread to anyone else.

* [Quarantined returnee](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/426876/covid-19-second-cluster-has-potential-to-be-very-serious-professor-skegg) who left quarantine after two negative tests and fourteen days in isolation but then tested positive. Spread to at least one other person on the flight out of quarantine, and then to their family (who then went on a big holiday visiting a bunch of tourist hotspots). Intensively contact tracted and stamped out with no lockdown.

* [Port worker](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/18/new-zealands-three-week-streak-without-local-covid-case-ends-as-port-worker-falls-ill) who caught it from doing maintenance on a ship which had picked up some crew from the Philippines. Spread to a couple of colleagues. Still quite early days but again looks like we've aggressively contact traced it into submission and there have been no new cases linked for nearly a week now.

There have been many other ""scares"" of infected people escaping quarantine or otherwise coming into contact with the community and none has resulted in community transmission.

What's emerging is pretty solid proof that when you keep cases at a baseline of 0, effective contact tracing can stamp out any new outbreak without the need for new lockdowns. The virus is obviously fairly infectious but it's not the measles - it can't and doesn't outspread intensive contact tracing when it can't hide among the noise of uncontrolled community spread.

NSW in Australia has proven it too - they had cases popping up for months on end but traced the shit out of them and successfully got cases back to 0 with no lockdown. Victoria will definitely do the same now that they've done the hard work.

And then of course you've got all of Southeast Asia, which has been doing this quietly and effectively right from the very beginning.

Baseline of 0 with heavy contact tracing is the only sustainable way to respond to Covid until a vaccine is widely available. With such low numbers we can do genomic testing of every single case and identify precisely where they came from, giving us good confidence of whether there are any unknown chains of transmissions out there. You simply can't do that with hundreds or thousands of daily cases - there's effectively no intevention left to you except various flavours of lockdown.",,,1603768532,{},ga8kynp,False,t3_ji9cnd,False,True,t1_ga5g14f,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ji9cnd/australian_city_melbourne_to_exit_one_of_the/ga8kynp/,1603773535,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],1603769621.0,,

Yeah, okay, so [IFR of COVID is sitting around .5-1%](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/estimating-mortality-from-covid-19)

% infected doesnt matter if % death isnt a direct result - and its not.  A large majority of people become infected and do not experience symptoms or issues.  Positivity rates of tests dont help either as no tests are 100% and even if at 100%, there remains a large % of people who cant or wont get tested.  So we imagine instead of the positivity rates and fatality rates, we use CFR and IFR - which are both very low.

&gt; Does that mean that it’s safe to drive drunk?

No, thats a horrible connection.  Its a strawman argument.  We arent talking about drunk drivers, nor the direct relation.  And even if we *were* - you are comparing wrong numbers. Not only do you not know the total amount of drunk drivers (caught *and* uncaught), you also have to take into account how many drivers **total**.  Horrible attempt at a comparison.

Either way, its a tiny fraction.  Whats the % rate of 225k to 350million? Thats the CFR.  Now imagine there are at least 50-60% **UNTESTED/ASYMPTOMATIC** people out there - now that number shrinks dramatically.

That's great, your country isn't the one in the post. Most countries are not seeing massive increases due to international travel. 

&gt;A few people coming from abroad is what has led every country on Earth besides China to having covid within their country,

Yes which is why closing your borders is important when you have low or no cases in your country. Once you getting tens of thousands everyday closing your borders is far less important. How do you not get this?

&gt;it can derail attempts to control community transmission with the country

Not significantly. If the community is taking proper procedures to screen and isolate positive individuals it shouldn't matter where the case came from so long as they handle it responsibly and prevent it from spreading. A case coming across the border is no different from a case that didn't. If you have proper guidelines within that country to isolate and contact trace then somebody coming across the border isn't as great of a concern as what you do with them if thry are positive. The latter is far more important which has been my entire argument but you cannot comprehend it. 

&gt;As I've said, an untold number of times, both border controls and internal suppression are required to limit the spread of covid.

Yes and in this specific instance the latter is of exponentially greater importance. Keeping the border closed isn't even that important if you take the proper measures with any newcomers, like screening them beforehand and having them isolate for two weeks. Also with the state many countries are in they are having to focus on the internal suppression, not their borders. Most countries are not getting their cases from abroad so for them to worry about the border is a waste of time. Obviously for countries that are getting covid from abroad it isn't a waste of time, but none of the countries discussed in this post are getting them from abroad. 

&gt;Failing to prevent covid-infected people from entering your country will inevitably derail suppression efforts.

Not if your supression efforts include isolating newcomers and screening them beforehand. This is why internal policies are so much more important than just ""cLoSe ThE bOrDeR"". I mean you realize countries are still trading with eachother right? 100% border closure is impossible. This is another reason having solid plans to mitigate spread within your own community is the highest priority. Getting a case from abroad is almost an inevitably, so you need a plan in place to handle cases locally that extend beyond the braindead chants of this thread that are ""close the border"". Closing the border is like 1% of the fucking job done. The rest has to be done internally. 

&gt;You're focused on countries that either never got virus transmission under control

AKA the one the fucking post is about? Or the majority of them? When talking about these countries, which is what the post is about, plans need to include what to do within the country. A border closure is not what they need right now. They need stricter guidelines for domestic spreading. I don't give a rats fucking ass what your prison nation accomplished. When there is a thread about you guys you can bring up your border closure. Unfortunately for the rest of us, closing our borders is the least of our concerns. I would also like to point out it's significantly easier to maintain a border closure when you're a fucking island. Try sharing the longest land border with the worst hit country and get back to me. 

&gt;You continue to focus on a particular few countries where border restrictions will have the least amount of impact

**BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THIS FUCKING POST IS ABOUT YOU TROGLODTYE**

&gt;border restrictions not working in countries with high infection rates

The implication of that statement being they don't work to stop domestic spread, which is the primary goal of any solution these countries are looking for right now.

The point of contention is mainly political. The closest reality is it is either wave two just because the death curve has only had two peaks, and deaths are probably a more accurate depiction of covid due to the imperfections behind testing/asymptomatic cases. Or it is wave one because any location in the USA has only had one death peak and the two peaks as a country are just a result of one wave moving geographically.

Okay dude, here.  Do you still drive a car knowing that there are drunk drivers on the road? Im 100% sure you do.  So theres your answer - if we dont stop driving for drunk drivers, do you stop living your life because of a sickness you cant control either?

You can cherry pick numbers all you want, but the only ones that matter are CFR and IFR.  Thats it. Hospitalizations dont matter, positivity rates are unreliable as fuck, and other metrics arent paying attention to the ones that really are the true form.

I'm going to guess that those unfortunate folks who are under quarantine just might either be out of luck or will have to break quarantine to be able to vote, either early or on Election Day.

My county has drive in/by voting, which I guess could be a potentially ""safer"" way for those who are or might think they have been exposed to vote.  The safety level will be determined by the level of PPE that the poll workers have access to and wear.

I do hope that everyone is able to vote and have their ""voice"" heard.

I'm not talking about the rioting and the Police force when reacting, I'm talking about the actual peaceful protests. Why is that allowed? If the virus is so dangerous and spreads like wildfire, why is protesting allowed at all? Do BL really M, or is that just a thing we say? If they mattered we would stop and prevent ""large gatherings"" right? 

I am not so heartless to say that the 200k+ people that died is an acceptable loss, but what I have an issue with is that less than 3% that have contracted the virus actually died worldwide, yet we encourage and allow protests and then blame certain people in the white house that the virus is not under control. 

The Governor's who allow their states and city's to host such large gatherings that some call riots and some call peaceful protests are the same states that are also dealing with increased numbers in cases. California for example. LA showed shots of protests with major streets being flooded with a sea of people protesting, and currently have or accumulatively have not, not sure which, 914,000 cases and now the Governor of California is trying to tell its people that they can't gather for the holidays. Why is it that the government has no problem with protests, but turkey dinner with the family is not? 

One last thing I urge you to consider. If this virus was actually as severe as we are being led to believe, then why are we not hearing more about the extermination of the homeless population. Wouldn't they be the absolute first to be effected by this virus?

Most people would benefit from a flu shot.  Depending on the year, which types of strains are prevalent and how well they predicted the strains, it can reduce your chances of catching the flu by 40-60%.  And if you do catch it, it’s less likely to be severe.  “It’s just the flu” can very easily mean a truly miserable ten days or time in the hospital or severe complications like sinusitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, and heart problems.

I’d happily get a yearly shot for any reduction of that risk.  My mom actually broke a rib coughing from flu induced pneumonia.  She was only 50 at the time.

For example, a 73-year-old man entered a grocery store without a mask in a small town in a rural county. When asked to wear one, he refused and assaulted several people inside. Upon leaving, he got in his vehicle and tore through the parking lot, doing damage to the outside of the store, before speeding off. Provincial police pursued him and fatally shot him at his residence.

There are people across Canada that don't care about others. Look at all these anti-mask protests.

&gt; In all likelihood, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other regulators will issue the first COVID-19 vaccine approval or emergency use authorization (EUA) for one vaccine while many other candidates have clinical trials still underway or in the planning. At that point, ongoing studies of any vaccine—including that first one—could become unethical because half the participants would get a placebo, at a time a vaccine with established efficacy will be available. “It’s a very vexing issue,” says Christine Grady, who heads the bioethics department at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center, which organized a “grand rounds” webinar on the challenges last week.

&gt;  For all these questions, Grady tells ScienceInsider, the ethical equation “boils down to a fairly simple calculus”: the individual versus the societal value. During the webinar, philosopher Joseph Millum framed the issue as “fundamental” to all clinical research. “Clinical research is ethically challenging because it exposes participants to risks for the benefit of others, not for the benefit of participants themselves,” said Millum, who works with Grady at the NIH Clinical Center.

All I'm saying is that there is a portion of the FDA advisory council that is not as keen as others to push for an EUA. It might not happen. Having that information isn't a bad thing and I never said they should or shouldn't get an EUA.

&gt;So serious was this in Britain that, as the pandemic took hold early this year, doctors set up a monthly committee to coordinate reports of brain disorders. Neurologist Dr Hadi Manji was among them. Very quickly, he says: “We had to make the meeting weekly because of the numbers of referrals.”

&gt;Indeed, new research from Chicago reports that one third of Covid patients hospitalised early in the pandemic suffered some form of altered mental state – from confusion to unresponsiveness. That in itself is not so unusual. Being seriously ill affects lucidity. According to Mary Ni Lochlainn, fellow in Geriatric Medicine at King’s College London, up to 80 per cent of those in intensive care suffer delirium.

That made me wonder why he chose that number. We did get down to 30,000, which is the same order of magnitude, although close to the next if you are doing percent of the total population.

Some truth there.

We were able to keep a lid on things with contact tracing, and isolation. We had a few outbreaks (see [Kelowna](https://www.kelownacapnews.com/news/kelownas-canada-day-covid-19-cluster-declared-over/)) which we got under control with contract tracing and isolation.

The problem is respiratory season. Specifically, winter (please do not even attempt to compare your winters to [ours](https://globalnews.ca/news/4926965/edmonton-cold-snap-frostbite-hypothermia/)). 

We've been told since the beginning the virus spreads far and wide in [respiatory season](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-coronavirus-covid-19-second-wave-fall-1.5542088), and it will be an extreme challenge with a [second wave](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-may-21-2020-1.5577286/b-c-s-top-doctor-bonnie-henry-says-2nd-wave-of-covid-19-inevitable-but-current-lessons-will-guide-response-1.5577290).

I appericate the honestly that our public health officials have shown. Rather than giving us false hope they were honest, there will be a second wave, and to expect restrictions.

As evidence, Edmonton v Kelowna had much stronger health measures in place (contact tracing app, manditory masks, universial asymptomatic testing, etc) and they have been unable to contain it with [just trace and isolate](https://globalnews.ca/news/7400293/city-of-edmonton-coronavirus-restrictions-october/).

Not necessarily. Memory B cells can survive and express immunoglobulin for decades. Neutralizing antibodies are found in the **serum** of 1918 flu survivors, 90 years after infection.

Of the subjects tested, 100% exhibited **serum neutralizing activity** against the 1918 virus (mean titer 1:562), and 94% had serologic reactivity to the 1918 HA (as indicated by hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) titers of 1:40 or greater; mean titer 1:396), even though these samples were obtained nearly 90 years after the pandemic.

By introducing DNA/RNA into cells (which is what DNA/RNA vaccines do), you can:
  - give the cell new capabilities
  - modify the genomic DNA
  - modify gene expression
  - modify protein expression
  - reprogram the cell (eg. turn a unipotent somatic cell into a pluripotent stem cell)
  - alter DNA transcription/translation
  - alter cell signaling
  - kill the cell
  - cause cell metastasis
  - cause cytotoxic effects
  - modify the behavior of the cell
  - make changes that will affect your descendants

He that overcomes will be clothed in white raiment, and Jesus will not blot out his name out of the Book of Life, but He will confess his name before His Father, and before His angels. Him that overcomes, Jesus will make a pillar in the temple of His God, and he'll go no more out, and Jesus will write upon him the name of His God, and the name of the city of His God, which is New Jerusalem, which comes down out of Heaven from His God, and Jesus will write upon him His new name.

[],,StandAloneComplexed,,,[],,,,text,t2_6fl0a,False,False,[],"As a result, it is worth to note the Chinese system is in constant reform, and is probably the political system that has changed the most among its peers the past few decades (Deng XiaoPing market reform in the 80', Jiang opening of the party in the 90', etc.). There is no point in treating it like the China of Mao, this isn't a dictatorship ruled by a family like the Kim dynasty in North Korea.

Because some of my other political long explanation posts have been removed from this sub on basis of being ""purely political"" (which is fair), I'll end up with some thought about all this reflects to the present day coronavirus situation:

The Chinese system is way more *accountable* than the American democratic system. There is no way a singly party state can shift the blame to the opposition. They have to fix whatever difficulty happens because they don't have any choice to keep their legitimacy intact. In contrast, I'd argue democratic systems allow any elected official to pretty much do whatever they want once elected, just with the ""threat"" of not being reelected in a few years, but it literally doesn't even matter if the leader at that time took deliberate and disastrous action, or completely mismanaged a critical situation, in foreign policy or domestically such as not handling a deadly pandemic resulting in hundreds of thousand of death.

Moreover, because of their competency, it is the coronavirus task force that handled the crisis in China. [Dr. Zhong Nanshan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhong_Nanshan) ran the show and called the shots, and was on TV while XI Jinping was criticized in the Western media for not being present, while it was basically his job to let the expert do theirs:

&gt; In early January 2020, Zhong visited Wuhan, in response to a growing cluster of then-unidentified pneumonia cases, and was reassured by city health officials that the disease was controllable and preventable. On January 20, however, he returned to Wuhan, to re-evaluate the situation, and came to the conclusion that the novel coronavirus was more transmissible than previously identified, and warned the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party[10] that authorities in Wuhan were likely understating the severity of the outbreak, and on the same day, publicly announced on state television the same.

This isn't specifically a characteristic of the Chinese system per se, as many democracies more or less let their task force direct the action, but the technocrat side of Chinese leaders (f.e. Xi JingPing has an engineering degree) and respect of science certainly had a strong influence.

Overall, the democratic vs authoritarian system isn't as a clear cut as you might initially believe, and while I certainly acknowledge you can't talk freely about overthrowing the CPC in China, criticizing policies is possible, protesting is possible (see article above), and better, the Chinese have more freedom in the sense they can get their government to act for the better in a more practical way.

I won't argue the Chinese system is perfect and all rose tainted (China faces enormous challenges), but if I'm to look at the data and past results of policies, depending on your definition of ""freedom"" I personally might prefer the Chinese system than the American one, and certainly prefer it for the freedom of living a life 

Lastly, while I did some research and have my opinion on HK and XinJiang, I don't want to dive into these topics since they very politically heavy and clearly not in line with this coronavirus sub. Hopefully the above is acceptable and doesn't get removed.",,,1603796663,{},ga9evv4,False,t3_jicnn3,False,True,t1_ga9euz2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jicnn3/why_asia_is_doing_better_than_europe_in_the/ga9evv4/,1603796674,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,
[],,StandAloneComplexed,,,[],,,,text,t2_6fl0a,False,False,[],"&gt; Curious. How would you argue that exactly?

Not Chinese, but China has been my pet peeve for a few years and I have dived into how it basically works more than the average Westerner.

I wouldn't exactly say China is more ""free"" in the liberal sense of the term, but I would certainly argue their system is much more ""reactive"" to the need of their citizens.

To make it short, I like these two sentences that quite reflects the reality imho:

* *""In China, the government controls the corporations, while in the US corporations control the government.""*

* *""You can't change the party in China, but you can change the policies. You can change the party in the US, but you can't change the policies"".*

To support the first point, having election isn't a guarantee that policies will widely reflects the wishes of the people. See f.e. [this study by Princeton University (2014)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/testing-theories-of-american-politics-elites-interest-groups-and-average-citizens/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B):

&gt; Multivariate analysis indicates that economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence

Which basically means the US democracy is little more than an illusion, and that while in theory the system should reflects a ""one man, one vote"" principle in the polls, in practice Jeff Bezos vote (of a different kind of paper and outside of the poll) weights much more than the one of the average American.

For the second point, one need to realize that while the Chinese don't choose their leaders directly, China [has elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_China) on a local level, and they have a different mechanism to select competent officials on the higher levels, pretty much based on results and performance, rather than voting the most charismatic leader.

Not having direct elections on the upper levels also doesn't mean they don't have legitimacy (elections equaling legitimacy being more of a Western amalgamation), and it doesn't mean their isn't any other channel in place to voice their needs, notably in the form of public opinion surveys. For a more academic and longer article about that topic, there is this excellent writing: [The ""Surprise"" of Authoritarian Resilience in China](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2018/02/surprise-authoritarian-resilience-china/) by Wenfang Tang (2018).

That one article is particularly interesting since it goes deeper in the public survey system, and demonstrates the reasons the Chinese people actually support their government in mass (higher than in most democracies), and that the various Western explanations for this high approval (such as ""Chinese live in an unfree society so that they have extremely low expectations about what their government can do for them"") are actually unfounded, and that the judgment of the Chinese system by the West is certainly ideologically biased.

First, not all of Lombardy was evenly hit. It was in particular 3 provinces and Milan was not one of those.
Also, people are angry because they already had to make big sacrifices. New guidelines came in week after week to reopen and stay open safely and all the businesses did so at their own expenses. Gyms, pools, bars have not been linked with many transmission cases. Places were very safe and rules very strict. And everything was fine until schools reopened and public transports started to be packed again. Not much, not to say nothing, was done to reopen schools safely and no there was no transportation plan. And the government had 6 months to get ready.

Nothing was done to keep the vulnerable protected either. There’s a surge of cases in nursing homes and within families with young children.

Another study from August had 2 main points to this question:
- infections in the wider community likely driving cases in schools
- children were more likely to acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection at home than in school

So, the study found that schools are safer than many alternatives for the students and teachers.

At our school, incidents where pod quarantining was required all happened in the first 2-weeks while everyone was out of school. They had gotten it before school was in session and brought it with them (mostly teachers and staff). Once everyone was back in a school routine, the chances of a teacher or student contracting it dropped substantially because they were spending a majority of their time in a “safe zone” at school. 

This is certainly not what I personally had predicted (I thought we’d be converted to virtual after 1 week), but the past 3-months have 100% proven me wrong. I just feel bad for a lot of friends and colleagues where schools are still locked down. It’s not back to normal here by any means, but schools going back has been really heathy for the kids, families, and community. 

The virus is weird in how it works!  I think we’ll be studying it for a LONG time trying to figure it out.

The first study you linked was in a non-school environment. Of course younger kids are gonna have a high rate of household transmission. Their parents hug them and make them dinner even when they're sick and make their bed and go their laundry and everything. Their household positivity rate was higher than 20-30 year old because I assume they are independent and don't rely on their parents, therefore have less interactions with roommates. It starts to climb as people get older and have more contact with spouses/kids. Not really shocked. And one outbreak in Israel isn't really relevant. You said (or whoever made the original claim) that the outbreak in the US was tied to schools opening and I said there's no evidence of that. You linked a non school Korean study and a Israeli outbreak. None of that shows the outbreak in the US is caused by schools. My alma mater Notre Dame reopened and did have a small outbreak of 200 students as people adjusted to the new rules. After a fte a week or two they figured it out. They are now down to 1 a day if even. I'm not saying open schools up with no rules. Plenty of schools in Illinois have opened up. Some had a few positive cases and then shut down again proactively till the cases clear then opened back up. Some have had 1 or 2 cases and traced correctly and is fine. My niece went home with a cold and the school wouldn't let her back until she had a negative test. New Trier, one of the high school in Illinois, has 7 active cases and 42 students quarentining out of 3980 students. No students in Illinois have died since opening in August. In fact, only 7 people under the age of 20 have died in the entire state since the start of the pandemic. It doesn't list preexisting conditions, but I'm sure some of those 7 had serious health issues. Nobody is advocating for those types of kids to go back to school right now.

*Due to the current situation in Europe and Sweden, the Stockholm Medical Association says that it is time to back away from the relief they have made on restrictions for people over the age of 70, what do you say about that?*

\- We continuously monitor all efforts we have in Sweden and try to adapt them as well as possible. Right now we are working on adapting them locally because the spread of infection looks so different in the country. When it comes to people over the age of 70, it is a slightly different situation, we do not have a large increase among them at the moment. It is important that we help protect them, but we see no reason to change that part today, says Anders Tegnell.

*Why not introduce a discouragement on domestic travel if the situation looks so different in the country?*

\- This is a discussion we are having. So far, the differences are not so great, very many regions have an increase. We think it is important for the General advice to avoid too many contacts.

Im an ER doc, I'm used to patients/staff/the system having lots of expectations of me. Everyone wants me to get to them faster, but take more time for them... I already don't take breaks during my shift, and I can only be so optimally efficient, so ultimately time for one comes from time for another. People want confidence but not narrow mindedness because they want certainty in an uncertain and imperfect environment. I'm used to putting most of those pressures on myself, but it is no doubt the reason why multiple shifts in a row leave me feeling burnt out. Patients that acknowledge that do a lot to help.

100,000 deaths I believe is within society’s risk tolerance. 

We know that 60,000 flu deaths is because there was a year in the last decade that saw that number come to fruition and nobody batted an eye. I do not believe the flu is the upper-bound of society’s risk tolerance either.

I suspect that 100,000 straddles that line, if we aren’t already.

Without context or an appreciation for aggregate statistics, you can make any number sound prohibitively large. 

For example, I can say, with palpable emotion “one death is too many!” It’ll sound good.

I can also say “650 preventable deaths and all we had to do was wear a damn mask!” It would also sound good.

Point being, society tolerates needless death. It does every year. Car wrecks, viruses, RX overdoses, alcohol poisoning, etc... Society allows for a certain number of death and keeps going.

[],,PirateNinjaa,,,[],,,,text,t2_cecfh,False,False,[],"It isn’t that hard to make a fan and filter hose combo with a battery which doesn’t leak and this is that, and if it doesn’t provide enough air (which it provides plenty of on speed 3, even if doing moderate exercising), you suck it through the mask or draw more air through the filter of the fan unit. I replaced the POS kn95 mask it came with with a well fitting silicone sealing n95 and that makes a big difference. You can cut a hole in any mask and if you cut a good hole it is a super tight fitting that doesn’t leak at all at the hose junction. 

There is literally no downside, it’s like having a little electric motor pushing your bicycle. “What if it doesn’t make you go fast enough or you run out of battery?”  You just pedal like a caveman like you would be doing already if you didn’t have the motor. It’s just doing some of the leg work for you. This fan is like that. A powered bonus with no downside, and it’s filter is a 99% filter which is better than the 95% of the n95 so it is a pretty significant upside too. 

The filter it is drawing air through is very similar to the ones inside those pink 3M p100 rectangular cartridges you use with half face respirators, you could probably just bust one of those cartridges open and remove the filter from it and put it in this if you think it’s a cheap knockoff filter. You can absolutely feel it drawing air through the filter if you put your hand by the intake. No air flows if you cover intake completely, any leaks are small and pretty insignificant. Fan uses some decent power but it has a lithium battery the size of my thumb that delivers the juice needed. Only lasts for like 2 hours on speed 3, but speed 2 produces more air than I breathe anytime other than exercising, and speed 1 is perfect for relaxing hard and lasts for like 10 hrs.

I think it’s a also matter of scale - if you only see a dozen flu cases in person over the years, four of them your own, and none are too bad, you think that’s what flu will always be like for you and people like you.

My own experience was worse, so I make more of an effort to avoid it happening again to me or anyone I would infect along the way if I got sick.
I’m just glad I’m not the one who infected my mom!  She was a teacher in a different state, probably caught it from the kids.

But I also have family in various medical fields - when you’ve seen two thousand flu cases ranging in severity from moderately miserable to quickly-dead, in everyone from toddlers to waitresses to grandmas, or you deal with the guilt of a kid who killed their parent/grandparent by bringing it home, you weigh the risk/hassle/cost/benefit ratio of a flu shot differently.

I’m in the US, so availability and custom and cost affect the attitude, too.  I think about 45% of adults get a flu shot annually.  Doesn’t take much effort, it is often free through work or insurance or community programs (unlike the rest of our terribly expensive medical care), and you can do it at any pharmacy without a doctor.

Since the cost of hospitalization or treatment for a bad case will bankrupt/severely financially hurt most of us, we literally can’t afford the risk of the flu, so if a free/cheap shot lowers that risk, a lot of us will take it.  Individuals may be rich, but the population as a whole is poor, and can’t afford medical care.
(2/3 of all bankruptcies in the US are linked to medical issues - either the bills themselves, or lost work from losing jobs when people get sick/injured.  Our social safety nets are pitiful and paid sick/vacation time is not required of employers.)",,,1603803484,{},ga9njp9,False,t3_jilhca,False,True,t1_ga8j2pj,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jilhca/nj_wants_70_of_adults_to_get_covid19_vaccine_in_6/ga9njp9/,1603803496,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

This isn't even accounting for the fact that the data sets from schools are incomplete and hard to trace because most schools do not require a negative test to come back, and most of the time when a student shows symptoms they only have to quarantine from 10-14 days (or with doctor's clearance, not necessarily a test), which results in no test.

Call it whatever you want. You lost every single thread you opened, and now you’ve retreated to one last point. 

&gt;Now, the reason why keeping the healthcare system protected is important is not just to reduce the amount that die from covid, it is also so that as few as possible die from other causes as well while the doctors are busy dealing with the virus.

Sure. And striking the right balance between treating the extraordinary victims of the virus with the ordinary victims is key. Which Sweden failed at. A fact supported by four different sources I sent to you. If you disagree, then please provide evidence, not just an opinion or a made up reasoning. Evidence. Studies. Expert opinions. Send me anything that supports your opinion, please. Anything at all. 

&gt;The other main argument, again, was the economic one, but I have already proven that the Swedish economy was among the least affected despite the focus on exports.

You have proven nothing. You’ve claimed something. Please provide evidence for your claim that Sweden is among the least affected, taking into account that tourism, not export, has been hit hardest. Relying on export has been a positive in this crisis. You keep coming up with random things that are so easily disproven. You are the definition of a layman wanting to argue details that you understand nothing of. I support everything I say with a source, and you’ve given me not a single one. 

&gt;These are valid measurements for what can be considered success.

No. The crisis is about preventing deaths. Which Sweden has failed at. You’re just trying to cherrypick the least terrible measures to make Sweden look better. 

&gt;Norway by contrast, is not nearly as good a benchmark as it is completely arbritrary, the only reason you use it is because they handled themselves almost surprisingly well, but that does not make every other country worse.

No. I’m so fucking tired of you making shit up and then accusing me of doing the same. I’m using Norway as an example because it is literally the most comparable country in the world to Sweden. Which I’ve sent you a study done by experts that agree with me. 

&gt;I repeat, Norway doing well does not make every other country worse.

Sure. It just makes Sweden a lot worse, since experts agree that if Sweden had done what Norway did, **thousands of deaths could have been avoided, at no cost to the economy.** This is not just my opinion. It’s not an argument I’ve thought up. It is the opinion of epidemic experts around the world. And what is your counter argument to that overwhelming evidence?

Of course it matters... but what you are saying is we should compare known numbers (the reported numbers) to the imaginary numbers you invent to account for the difference in testing.

Yes, there were twice as many tests in the week of June 24 (the previous high) but we have no way of knowing what the real number might be. For all we know, they tested everyone that was actually infected and thus the reported number *is* the real number.

Likewise, for all we know, despite testing twice as many people last week, they might not have tested anywhere near the total number of people that are actually infected. In fact we can assume that it is not, because obviously there are infected people spreading the virus to other people unknowingly (I would hope).

So, in the end, all we can do is compare the reported numbers.

&gt; Feels like this is common knowledge by now, but for some reason you like to make things seem in their worst possible way. 

No, I try to stick to the facts. The facts are that there are more **reported** cases now than at any time before. Anything else is just a guess.

FHM statistic counts everyone that dies within 30 days of being confirmed as positive of COVID-19 (""recently positive""). It also makes checks against the death registry to ensure that. This means if you were recently positive and got hit by a car - you are counted in. If you are recently positive but with stage IV terminal cancer and die now, you are counted in. If you are recently positive and have any unrelated condition that results in your deaths - in or out of the hospital - you are counted in. If you are untested and die of COVID-19, you are not counted in this statistic and also if you are tested but die more than a month after you last positive test. Keep in mind, people in hospital are tested more than once too?

Socialstyrelsen statistic counts everyone that has in their death certificate COVID-19 as main or secondary cause of death or as contributing factor. This also includes people that were diagnosed with COVID-19 by a doctor but not tested. However, they exclude people that died of other causes while being COVID-19 positive - so the example with the cancer patient or the traffic accident will be removed here. You can find the data here: [https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/statistik-och-data/statistik/statistik-om-covid-19/statistik-over-antal-avlidna-i-covid-19/](https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/statistik-och-data/statistik/statistik-om-covid-19/statistik-over-antal-avlidna-i-covid-19/) ; 90% of the cases found in this statistic had test results from FHM, so the two statistics largely overlap.

Edit: also, people refer to the statistics of Sweden because it is one of the few countries where the excess deaths from all causes collaborate the officially reported COVID-19 death numbers.

Fair enough. For what it's worth, I agree that she has the ""experience"" to be a supreme court judge. If I wanted to be snooty, I could even say that her credentials are below average. I wouldn't because I fundamentally disagree with the credentialism that's led most supreme court justices in recent history to be chosen from Harvard or Yale, but that's an entirely different argument. 

&gt;The science shows children are extremely low risk. In fact, they have a higher risk of dying of the flu and more children die of the flu in 3 months every year than have died of coronavirus since the pandemic began 7 months ago. There's no reason we can't get kids back in school in some capacity with proper precautions and controls.

Yes, from everything I've read, that's correct. Children are much less likely to die from coronavirus than practically any other group. 

I do have a few issues with this line of thinking though. 

1) What about Covid's long term health affects? I'm not a virologist, and I didn't study a science, much less medicine. I'm not going to pretend that I know much other than what I've read in news articles which aren't exactly the most reliable source, but it sounds like a significant proportion of people who get covid have longterm side-effects ranging from breathing difficulties to mental slowing. Even if the risk of death is low, these long-term effects need to be considered. 

2) You're completely ignoring the teachers &amp; their families. 

3) If a school is underserved then they're less likely to have proper precautions and controls to mitigate the risks. 

4) The families of these children are at higher risk themselves. Even if the students don't die, one bad outbreak at a school could mean dozens of high risk people getting infected. And again, if a school is underserved then it's likely not getting the best anti-Covid equipment as is.  

I hear what you're saying. I went to a high school where 1/3rd of my class didn't graduate, and that was during the Obama years. I'm certain teachers there don't have proper protection right now. So I'm very aware of the issues that you're bringing up because I've seen families who don't have internet, kids who are shuffled around from family member to family member, and who don't have parental figures who make them go to school. I'm not fine with leaving them behind, but I am concerned for the teachers as well. It's wrong to tell them to risk their lives when the government doesn't give a shit about them or the kids. After all, if the government cared, then something would've been done months ago. Or they'd be passing another stimulus bill right now with provisions to ensure everyone has internet access. Or they'd be doing anything but putting Amy Coney Barrett on the court. 

If you want to blame someone, blame elected officials. They could do something. Pelosi, McConnell, and Trump could've gotten together and said ""Look, there's a lot of teachers and students who are at risk. We can follow the science, find what's best, and ensure that everyone is as protected as they can be."" But that's not what happened because they're all bloodsucking ghouls. They're the reason I'm so supportive of unions - because unions are the only way for the average person to exercise any power in our society. I'm sure Lori Lightfoot is going to bend on some issues. Imagine if this was nationwide. Imagine if there was a nationwide teachers strike right now demanding proper protection, assured internet access for students, and meals too. I bet you they'd be acting right now.

Trump is saying that the reason why we have more positive cases now is because we're testing more.

The data shows that the infection *rate* has been largely static since the beginning (3-5%). 

So in the beginning if we only tested 100 symptomatic people we'd expect to see 3-5 positive tests for COVID.

Now that covid is everywhere (again, wholly because of Trump and his leadership) he's saying we have more cases because now we're testing tens of thousands of people a day, meaning we're seeing thousands of positive cases.

Trump also, erroneously, points to the CDC IFR data which most recently states that the survival rate for anyone under 70 is essentially a guarantee and you're more likely to die due to a car wreck if you're in the working class (less than 70 years old) than from covid.

For example, by May, Mexico reported double the amount of pneumonia deaths (not classified as covid) than normal.  Experts there have said that those deaths were likely due to Covid given the lack of testing capabilities.

Sure the virus wasn't handled well in most Western countries. And due to that we have to face the current reality.

The measures SEA countries take or the more lax measures Western countries take wont do it anymore. So what should we do?

I was a lifelong atheist (I'm 36  now, converted at 32), and I'm also a scientist. So I already had all my liberal worldviews baked in. While I've definitely had to face and challenge many of my preconceived notions of the world, I've 100% noted you can be as liberal as they come and still be a Christian. 

So again, as a liberal atheist scientist convert, my experience is atypical, and so my views are probably flawed on other Christians. But I can tell you a ton of churches are utterly ashamed of the behavior of White Evangelicals, think Trump is morally unfit as a leader, and we feel it's our burden and responsibility to try and ""clean  up"" the mess the others have made. It's almost an impossible battle, but we *are* trying. But I do wish many would try harder.

I could write a book on that topic, and it'd involve a lot of Christian theology you'd probably not be interested in (I know when I was an atheist I'd have rolled my eyes), but... yeah. 

A lot of us converts bring very liberal viewpoints into the church, and we feel obligated to fight against the cancer of fundamentalism. Christians have a better chance of getting through to other Christians (hopefully), so we try to take the initiative and fight the good fight.

When you take a gap year it’s usually to build up funds  for school or work experience, or to go traveling. It’s really hard to find work in most cases as a college student, especially one that would pay decently, and finding a job relevant to your field to build experience is also hard to find. You can’t travel either, at least not to foreign countries like most gap-year college backpackers would want to do. 

You can’t just take a gap year and spend the entire time doing nothing, which would likely happen to a lot of students. Also if you’re in my case, you’ve already taken a gap year and can’t really justify doing another one. 

Also I’ve heard of cases where programs told their students that if they take a gap year they’re not guaranteed a spot back in the fall of 2021.

The entries, each appended with a detailed list of the stops the patient had made, in sparse, sterile language, read like a ship’s logbook. “08:00 left home (on foot) / mask worn,” began one entry for Mapo’s fourth patient, dated from March 6th to 10th. The post went on to note each bus and subway transfer (“Bus transfer to no. 7730 in front of Sangam High School → disembarked at Susaeggyo / mask worn”), as well as a six-minute stop at a local supermarket, before ending with “15:00 tested positive → 19:00 transferred to Seoul Medical Center.” Emergency text alerts, because of their character limit, linked recipients to these entries rather than relaying them in full. “For the text alerts, we use something called a ‘remote broadcasting apparatus,’ ” Song said. “Then it’s sent to every phone in a five-kilometre radius through a nearby base station.”

[],,Busch-Diesel,,,[],,,,text,t2_6qomajz4,False,False,[],"Rural hospitals often have single-digit ICU beds, with a majority already used in ""normal"" times, because it would be a waste of money to have 40 ICU beds in a hospital with 5 ICU patients.

So when a hospital with 9 ICU beds ""overflows"" because they had 5 normal patients and 4 COVID patients, they transfer patients to the nearby metropolitan hospital with more beds.  Excess deaths are not occuring, so why is this such a cause for alarm?

Another common thing we hear is ""ICU at 90% capacity"" with no breakdown of the patient numbers.  The headline implies that an 11% surge in COVID cases will overwhelm the hospital, but if the hospital has 20 beds with 16 used and 2 used by COVID patients, they can actually handle a 100% surge in COVID patients.

Here's a good write-up from /u/grignardsreagent:

&gt;As background, I am an emergency room worker in Las Vegas who has over four years of experience. 
&gt;
&gt;When cases ""spike"" the media loves to exaggerate this by posting headlines stating how **ICUs are at full capacity reeeee**. My experience is anecdotal, but I will explain how the media makes it seems like people are dropping like flies when in reality they are not. 
&gt;
&gt;One thing to keep in mind is that hospitals are generally owned by corporations whose purpose is to turn a profit. These institutions are \*generally\* not designed for worst-case scenarios. Instead, they are designed to accommodate best-case scenarios for their pocketbooks. What I mean to say is that building massive ICUs would ultimately be financially unwise from a corporatist's perspective. Why spend extra money when you can just hold ICU patients in the emergency room (if ICUs were at full capacity) until a bed becomes available on the floor? From a money perspective, it is a win-win, and this is something they do all of the time if it is say a bad flu season or an atypical week. 
&gt;
&gt;At my hospital, it is not uncommon for our ICU to reach capacity. The big wigs want to work staff as little staff as possible, and they keep nurses on call just in case. Again, if there is a bad flu season or patient volume has increased inexplicably they will simply hire travel nurses to fill the needed roles. 
&gt;
&gt;Ultimately, it does not take very much for an ICU to reach full-capacity at many hospitals, and the media deceives the public and fear mongers by writing these headlines. Where were the headlines when our ICUs reached full capacity hundreds of times before COVID existed? Exactly. 
&gt;
&gt;I am not saying that ICUs reaching full capacity is not meaningful; it just that it is not nearly as bad as the media would have you believe. It's not like we have a hundred beds on standby and they are all chock-full. In my hospital, it would mean an extra three beds are occupied, and boohoo the intensivist has to stay the full-shift maybe instead of going home early to sleep.",,,1603822470,{},gaapby7,False,t3_jj33ch,False,True,t1_gaan67r,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jj33ch/in_rural_america_resentment_over_covid19/gaapby7/,1603826115,-1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

We've both said our piece so I'm not going to continue debating, as neither side is going to convince the other. I'd just like to say that this began with you saying schools are a major driver of the current outbreak and I said they weren't. You've shown that kids can get coronavirus (something I never argued against, I argued that they don't get very sick, which is statistically a fact). You've shown that schools can have outbreaks(something I never argued against, obviously they can, but risks should be mitigated and schools should be temporarily shut down if needed). Illinois is having 5000 cases a day. Schools have had a reported 500 total cases of students. I see no evidence that nationwide or statewide schools are a major driving force of this pandemic. That isn't anecdotal, that's just data points.

Also there are papers supporting my point of view. Read this review and feel free to read the multiple studies they describe that oppose your point of view. Do you think I'm functioning solely off of anecdotal evidence?

- No sitting in cafes, no cafe brunches etc (Melbourne has the best cafe culture in the world so this is a big deal)
- No more fancy nights out at a restaurant. But every so often we made a special effort to have a nice dinner and a few bottles of wine.
- LOTS more walks. We'd go for at least an hour walk through parkland every single day at sunset.
- No socialisation with friends and family, which sucks, but honestly the fact that everyone in the state is going through the same made it feel a bit better. Lots of people sharing their feelings and mental health struggles on IG and supporting each other, that sorta thing.
- Both working from home. This is a big one for us, cos my partner's commute to work + office environment SUCKED pre-covid. WFH has been amazing, more sleeping in, an hour commute removed each way, more time to hang out together
- We usually go to Europe for a month or two every year, which obviously couldn't happen this year.

To add to this, I'm sure for many couples it's been a major stressor, but for my partner and I this has been a pretty great bonding experience. And NB that the bulk of this (July - October) happened during a cold and wet winter here in Melbourne, so most of the time TBH most of the time we would've been bunkered down indoors anyhow. For us, it's really just removed maybe once every two weeks having beers at a pub with mates and a fair bit of eating out at restaurants. As an upside, we've both saved a shitload of money that we normally spend on pretty frivolous things, and we're planning on doing a 6-12 month road trip around Aus next year with the proceeds.

And what it's also saved is the rest of Australia getting infected too. They've been able to lead a normal life because of what we've done. The whole of Aus has all but eliminated Covid, and now has a travel bubble with New Zealand set up.

Also, a sacrifice is a voluntary or involuntary measure taken for the benefit of others to your own detriment. 

Getting sick is not a sacrifice unless you are one of the folks going to participate in the British Challenge Trials in 2021. Nobody benefits if a person gets sick, so it’s not a sacrifice.

So, by definition, you are simply wrong.

Moving on, if you like wearing a mask, fine. I, for one, would rather not wear a mask all things being equal. I like using facial expressions, seeing facial expressions, gauging peoples’ looks, breathing freely when heavily respirating etc.

Is a mask to my detriment? Yes
Does it benefit others? Yes
Is that why I and everyone else does it? Yes

It’s a sacrifice. Should not be a norm. Will not be a norm.

EDIT:
If you look at it one way it is a sacrifice getting sick I will say that.

For example, the few thousand who die a year in car wrecks could be considered a sacrifice for having the ability to drive.

I look at those tolerable numbers, and I think society does as well, as default deaths.

Your English comprehension is abysmal. I've pointed out numerous times that border restrictions along with suppression measures within the country are both essential. You're clearly too dumb to understand that oft-repeated point I've been making.

Yet another strawman in your second paragraph. Nice one. The only issue at hand is whether or not border restrictions are effective at preventing covid transmission. And, as you've admitted, they are.

Relaxing border restrictions here was due to a general dislike of internal EU borders. They're only to be implemented when deemed necessary. The Finnish government, along with other EU governments, thought they weren't necessary anymore, hence they were lifted. And that, as is obvious by now, was a mistake.

Ah, gotta make sure to get in an insult about people not visiting Finland. Ouch. I'll get over it though.

I don't think anyone can accurately state it's not a factor at all, but the amount of spread is less than I expected.

That being said... what our community has done around school being open is definitely not helping.  Sleepovers, parties, house parties, gatherings... all of these things have increased and are spreading.  Our state and county have, continuously, linked outbreaks to personal gatherings- and those are are then linked to schools because kids bring what they picked up there to the school.  That is how school outbreaks happen.

And despite the pleas (the district literally made a video begging parents to cut down on the social interaction outside of school) and the new restrictions (the state limited the number of people in a gathering to ten and from no more than two families) no one is changing their behavior.  The day after the new restrictions were announced, each of my kids was invited to two different parties, and neither wedding my husband and I were invited to were canceled.

When parents were successful in convincing leadership that their kids needed to be in person, they then took that to mean that their kids' lives should not be disrupted.  Social outlets and sports are now ""necessary part of education and development"" and so they mentally justify all of these choices.

As long as the government cannot go into people's homes and shut down the parties, they have less and less recourse.  So if families are refusing to make those changes, they may have no other choice than to close the schools.  If they want to slow the spread.

The other option seems to be what I hear a lot, which is ""spread it amount the healthy, build immunity, end this sooner.""  I don't subscribe to that, but when the government is battling those two people groups, closing schools may be their last resort.

It does, but many countries haven't got their numbers under control yet so they simply aren't at the state where their borders being closed is relevant. That's my entire point. Countries aren't worried about foreign travel right now, their concern is suppressing the spread within their country, and closing borders does nothing on that front. 

Right now most countries are at the stage where they need to get their own numbers under control. You talking about border closures as a fix to that issue is a red herring. Full stop. When we are talking about getting domestic cases under control bringing borders into the discussion is irrelevant. 

This entire post is about how France has 52k cases in one day. Their borders being open or closed would not have significantly changed that number because it is all domestically spread. You bringing up border closures is completely irrelevant to the topic of domestic spreading. 

&gt;You keep bringing up America for some reason. THEY NEVER GOT IT UNDER CONTROL. NOT EVEN CLOSE.

Yes because their leader is another troglodyte who thinks he can just close borders and be done with it. But that's not a solution for domestic spreading. It's a solution for foreign spreading. But foreign spreading is not a concern to the vast majority of countries right now, so talking about solutions to an issue most countries (and the one which is the topic of this post) are not facing is beyond irrelevant.

After being exposed a couple of times to coronaviruses people generally obtain affinity maturation and are unable to be infected anymore. Even if reinfections are more common than we think, eventually the immune system will be able to permanently combat it. 

Even then, its far more likely from what we know that the majority of reinfections will be asymptomatic or mild. Asymptomatic ones had been happening for months and months (all the way back to April in Asia, but they were being dismissed as poor testing or long haul), just no one took notice until there were a few severe reinfections. Keep in mind the virus has shown to produce tcell and bcell responses. Subsequent infections will generally be less severe. Not everyone has a proper immune response as well, which could explain rare severe reinfections. They're also studying the severe reinfections closer. There are dozens and dozens of asymptomatic/mild possible reinfections in backlogs that haven't been genetically tested.

All in all the chances of people being infected over and over is extremely unlikely. Mild coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 showed only 10% of people were able to be infected on their third introduction to the virus spaced out for antibodies to wane (**edit:** *for the record around half were able to be infected on second exposure*). And as mild coronaviruses these invoke a more mild immune response than SARS-CoV-2 in general.

Its much more likely this virus becomes an immunosupressed endemic disease (by vaccination and acquired immunity) that still circulates causing bad colds, but is overall mild for most people besides the small population left who has zero exposure to it. 

**Edit:** *When people say there isn't such a thing as herd immunity to common coronaviruses it doesn't mean you can't build permanent immunity to it. It just means reinfections are possible and the virus continues to circulate through the population.* 

*Experts now believe the Russian Flu Epidemic of 1889 was actually caused by hCov OC43 as it jumped from cows to humans genetically around then in that region. It appears it killed millions and caused severe disease when it was a novel virus. Now it circulates as an low level endemic disease causing colds. The epidemics likely caused only lasted a couple years.*",,,1603757668,{},ga80t1y,False,t3_jioge0,False,True,t1_ga7tyjz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jioge0/covid19_heart_changes_raise_death_risk_virus_may/ga80t1y/,1603763052,-6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],1603758360.0,,

[],,Mister_Met,,,[],,,,text,t2_3clhd3st,False,False,[],"THANK YOU DR FAUCI! This is exactly why there *needs* to be a **federal** law mandating masks **right fucking now**.

In many ways this doesn’t go far enough however, because often even people who wear masks do so wrongly. By no fault of their own. It just happens. For this reason there should be a task force of specialists who can monitor that these masks are being worn correctly. They can spread out into the communities and do this work.

As part of that, people who have willfully put their fellow citizens in danger need to be identified. This obviously includes anybody who voted for Trump. These people should have a special insignia on their masks so they can be identified by authorities for the sake of the public good.

Their children should perhaps have a slightly less conspicuous symbol on their masks — something to identify the very real risk they are in as a result of being raised by such enemies of society and of science.

As part of a new nationwide emphasis on public health, citizens should be encouraged to identify people who are “enemies” of this progress. Once identified, these individuals should be given a chance to repent and change their ways. But this progress will of course need to be monitored by the government, so they should have a third type of insignia on their masks, to ease identification.

To facilitate compliance with the new public health measures, a new agency of the government should be created. The task force I mentioned above can easily be adopted to this work. These individuals will be employed by the federal government but not identified as such. This is to help gain a measure of trust from the population. Their jobs will be to keep files on individuals within their purview, and update these files regularly to track progress.

Obviously people who willingly violate the new mask law will have to be separated from society — for the good of society, as well as for their own good. This will be dealt with humanely and fairly. Not at all like Nazis. These individuals will simply be separated from their families and society and moved to a safe place for a time being. All perfectly humane and fair. These safe places will seek to educate them to the evil of their ways and the harm they are doing to the world. Once re-educated they can be returned to society. Of course repeat offenders will have to be dealt with a little more harshly. 

But this will be for their own benefit. Eventually individuals who have proven to be a menace to society and a danger to the security of the state, will have to be permanently removed. This too will be done humanely, but the key is that it will be done for the good of the collective whole. Because in such a system there will really be no space for individualism. This selfish attitude is exactly what got us into such trouble in the first place.

So selfish activity will have to be controlled in all aspects of society, especially the economic realm. Individuals will not be allowed to hoard cash. A progressive tax policy will of course help this to be redistributed, to aid the less fortunate. With cash hoarding outlawed, banks will not have any reason to exist. So they can probably be done away with first. People who run these banks will have to be identified as enemies of the state and placed in camps until they see the error of their ways and can be returned to society. But of course they will not be allowed to enter in an advantageous position, but somewhere near the base, where they will be reduced to doing manual tasks that help the greater good. Needless to say they will also have a special insignia on their masks that identifies them as a part of this dangerous class of individuals.

Business owners of all stripes will have to receive the same treatment as the managers of banks. Of course they will be understanding and will welcome an opportunity to make amends to society. However those that do not will, for their own protection, have to be removed from society.

There are other measures that will have to be taken vis-a-vis the bourgeoisie who have brought so much pain unto the country. But that can be tackled later.

**The important thing is that it should 100% be against the fucking law to leave your house without wearing a mask.**

Frankly they should require wearing them even when you are home and even when you’re alone. But for now it should simply be strictly outlawed in public. Anybody caught flaunting this very important rule will have to be dealt with very harshly. Penalties are not enough. Imprisonment, of an indefinite period (at least a year, and up to five or even ten years) for first time offenders. No exceptions, no appeals. Second-time offenders are sent to top secret camps permanently. These camps will be for degenerates and other repeat violators of these laws. For security reasons they will have to be off limits to all but a small group of security professionals with special clearance. Red Cross and other international organizations will not be allowed anywhere near their premises. This to make sure such harmful individuals are kept out of sight and out of mind. It is only fair, correct, and proper that such measures are taken against people who willfully go out in public without masks.",,,1603767956,{},ga8jz7e,False,t3_jilfni,False,True,t3_jilfni,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jilfni/dr_fauci_says_the_us_is_still_in_the_first_wave/ga8jz7e/,1603773045,-1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Between mid-May and the end of September, the health threat panel did not meet. The PM started to overturn various measures in August and September and the government was sending contradicting messages. This undermined the trust in the prevention and the majority people started to believe the Covid was hoax. This was reinforced by various ‘specialists’ from the medical field but not in virology. You got dentist, cardiologist, and other downplaying the infection. Any doctor saying otherwise like the director of the most hit county hospital in Uh. Hradiste was accused having a political agenda. The approaching regional election at the end of September wanted to be won by the current populist government that sacrificed thousands of lives to maintain hold upon regional government.

[],,Blightking,,,[],,,,text,t2_mkpfy,False,False,[],"Okay, so the flu vaccine is actually a cocktail. Flu mutates *very* quickly, much much faster than coronavirii. There’s an incredible number of flu variants with different antigens running around, so medicine boards look at the strains in the opposite hemisphere and try to select the three most dominant ones. There’s problems with that because A. They can  and frequently completely miss the mark on what that strain is, B. the top three strains don’t cover every single strain, and C. even if the correct strain is selected, the targeted antigen can change quick enough that it outpaced vaccine development. So you end up getting a relatively ineffective flu vaccine. Covid-19, thank god, does not suffer from these problems, at least at the time I’m writing this. Not only that, but flu vaccine technology hasn’t really improved since the 60s, and there haven’t been major attempts to do so. Flu just isn’t really that much of a problem, so there’s no grant money to improve delivery methods or any of the tech that could bolster immunogenicity. The Covid front runners and a couple outside that are all new tech which would, in theory, but based on the aforementioned results likely be better at producing a stronger immune response. 

TL;DR comparing flu vaccine efficacy to a potential Covid one is an inappropriate comparison.

I don’t think any phase 2 has finished yet, but we have readouts that state their immunogenicity, including antibodies and all that. You don’t need a phase 2 trial to complete to see if a vaccine produces a strong immune response- it’s mostly so long for safety reasons.

I think that the density and interconnectedness of Europe means that the virus has already spread everywhere, to every town and village. In the US, some places are only just getting started, with plenty of places still to be hit.  

The reason NYC was hit so bad early on is because it's the capital of the world, with millions of travellers and tourists passing through. 'Blue' states were hit harder initially for the same reason. More rural 'red' states are less well travelled and connected and so the virus has took longer to take hold. 

Viral load seems to be an important factor in outcomes. If you get hit with a lot of the virus before your immune system gets started it's not gonna end as well. That's why a lot of medical staff were dying early on in China and Europe. Now that we are all wearing masks and taking other precautions, even while infection rates are high, fatalities are much less than in April. People are getting infected but with smaller doses of the virus, and do have a better chance of recovery. 

A reduction in deaths should be apparent when most people are taking it seriously.

I don't believe this.  Safety and getting through this is more important than 1 year of education that's affected.

Possible death or 1 year of education affected.  Really think about this.  

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;States and the government need to do what they can to get students safely back in classrooms where they can properly learn. 

And here is the problem.  One side (republicans) are pushing this in grossly inhuman way.  There NEEDS to be a point to go back in.  But right now, the push is ""just go back.  Masks aren't mandatory"".  It is too early into this to be going back.  The ""safely go back"" option is to wait until true treatments (like the one trump got) and vaccines (even if they're only partially effective) are out.  Then start integrating.  I don't agree with shutting everything down, but at the same time some large groups are pushing callous solutions.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;But to students struggling in whatever way, especially low income students, this year of education means the world to them and will affect them for many years to come.

I agree.  They'll be affected.  Everyone, not just them, will be affected.  This is something huge and impactful.  And the solution will not leave people unscathed.  Right now, you're advocating pretty much go learn at the expense of some 10% of teachers dying (lets be honest, a lot of teachers are older or not in the best shape), some children, and a ton of adults that get the virus from the children going to school.  I SEE your argument and it is a valid point but I just can't compare  a year and 4 months of affected school work and education growth to DEATH.  Avoiding death should be a priority and with everything, there needs to be a balance.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;because it doesn’t necessarily regard them. 

Well, it affects me.  In late february, early march (before trump shut down and before France shut down), I was one of the first with lysol, spraying the doorknobs, spraying my desk.  And I can tell you, even though the education isn't as good as it was, I don't want to risk my health or my life just to go back.  Heck, the school recently proposed going back to teach online while in the classroom (no kids, but they set up a lot of projectors, 65 inch tv's cameras that follow you around, good quality mics supposedly, etc) and even that I don't want to do because that means going to a place that others (cleaning staff, maintenance staff, other teachers) have been to and maybe spread the virus.  On top of all that, I'll be meeting with fellow teachers and friends and that'll put me in a position where it'll be awkward to isolate from them.  So, even without students I don't want to go back. I have faster internet at home.  I have a faster computer at home.  I have better audio at home.  No need to go risk it.  Yes, education will not be the same for this year for most people.  My health, the health of my students, the health of the children's family, and the health of the community is more important than getting 70-80% of the class instead of 80-100% of the class.

EDIT:

Speaking about the social aspect, that's another hard one.  I like to label myself an extroverted introvert.  I like to be alone most of the time.  But the few times I do go out, I like to enjoy myself with the friends and acquaintances.  Many can't believe I'm an introvert because when I go out with them, I'm a top 3 figure in group outings.  DUring the pandemic, I've gone out twice with someone.  I've risked it for them but after the date/outing, I've asked myself, ""was it really worth it to risk my health, my parents' health since I live in the same building""?  Going back to work (again, even without students), I'd feel the social aspect of having to and wanting to socialize. But is that really more important than possibly getting very sick and dying or infecting a loved one or family member?

It’s hard to grasp certain concepts without the in person aspect or extra help. The lack of relationships being made can be depressing and overwhelming. I agree that distance learning is not a replacement and is what we’re doing for the moment, but it definitely isn’t good and is very chaotic. And this is coming from someone who’s always been a 4.0 student. As a nursing major, some of the concepts I’m learning need to be taught in person but are being taught online which is not feasible whatsoever. I have two elementary aged siblings and one of them was just bawling their eyes out because they are struggling with online learning (has also always been a straight A student) and hates not seeing their friends. They now have a therapist for depression. And my other sibling isn’t doing too much better.

Let’s not even get into the other attributes like those students who don’t get to eat each day because school food was their only meals. Students who are in abusive households and don’t have school as an escape anymore. Special educated students who are now falling even further behind because they’re not thoroughly understanding online education. There’s so many pieces to this puzzle.

At the end of the day, in person education needs to be a priority. States and the government need to do what they can to get students safely back in classrooms where they can properly learn. To you, it may not be a big deal that millions of students are missing “a year or so” of a quality education. But to students struggling in whatever way, especially low income students, this year of education means the world to them and will affect them for many years to come.

Edit: But for the most part, I do agree with most of what you said. It just needs to be a bigger priority to get students back to in person that’s all. I think a lot of people on the sub don’t care about this subject because it doesn’t necessarily regard them. They had their time in school. They don’t have children. They’re grown adults.

&gt;I've repeatedly pointed out that my country is an example of one where border controls do work in cases of ""widespread community transmission"", when suppression measures are implemented.

No you country is an example of good lockdown measures to stop the spread within. You will never be able to control domestic spread with border closures. That's the problem it solves. Border controls do nothing against community transmission because community transmission happens within the fucking border. 

There are two separate issues. Foreign spread and domestic spread. When you have 52k new cases, less than 1% of those are coming from abroad. Therefore your main concern is stopping community spread. A few people coming from abroad are drops in a fucking ocean. Closing your borders will not solve the issue they face, bringing it up is a red herring. 

&gt;How many times have I said that border controls along with suppression measures within a country are necessary?

And how many times do I have to fucking tell you most of these countries are not worried about foreign travel right now or also have their fucking borders closed already. Closing borders is not a solution for the state these countries are in right now. It will do absolutely nothing to help them in the state they are in right now. 

This entire conversation is irrelevant for multiple reasons. The main one being most countries do in fact have their borders closed. The second being the issues they face presently will not be solved by stricter border controls. If you cannot fathom that most countries are dealing with domestic spread right now, and border closures do nothing to prevent domestic spread, then you are beyond useless to this conversation. 

And don't talk of poor reading comprehension when you aren't even competent enough to understand what border controls are effective at fighting. Right now what France needs is significant lockdown measures. Border closures wont help them in the slightest since their cases aren't coming from abroad. That doesn't make border closures useless, but it makes them irrelevant to this conversation. 

The fact you are so mind numbingly incompetent to be unable to see the point I am making is truly a sight to behold. I mean we're practically agreeing but you seem to think borders are like 50% of the solution. All the other measures like mask wearing, social distancing, closure of non essential business, are the *vast* majority of the fight against covid. Closing the boders would have such a tiny fucking effect on these countries it's not even worth bringing up. Not because it will have zero overall effect, but because it's useless to those countries right now. 

When you talk about border closures being miraculously effective and then add all the other measures that are actually doing the legwork as some fucking afterthought you're empowering dumbasses who think closing the border is all you need to do. That's how this entire conversation started. Somebody suggesting borders should be closed, on a thread about France have 52k *domestic* cases. That is pointless to the conversation of how to curb the spread in those countries.

I tend to believe that people who minimize the effects of the virus are poorly informed or unable to confront what their fellow humans are facing. If all else fails, I call to mind what I consider to be an American of average intelligence and then remind myself that 50% of them are dumber than that.

I don’t think that the sacrifices that were made to slow the virus were for nothing. The problem of demonstrating success of a venture that prevents something from happening is that opponents of the venture will deny that it had anything to do with the prevalence of what was meant to be stopped.  

If the US hadn’t taken the inadequately rigorous and too short ‘quasi-shutdown’, the current escalation in cases would have started with a higher number of infections, which would likely mean that we would have been in our current miserable position sooner and now we would be in a bigger mess.

The way most US states approached their so-called ‘lock downs’ underdelivered on slowing the spread of the virus. That gives politicians cover to reject a second, proper lockdown (fewer people allowed to leave home and only near home for an hour or two, comprehensive testing with rapid results, prompt contact tracing and enforced quarantine) by saying that the undeniably high economic cost of the earlier ‘lockdown’ was not justified. 

The result will be half a million dead by February, and many, many more sickened. Some will have long lasting (possibly permanent impairments). The higher number of cases will worsen the hammering the economy is taking - especially as news and images emerge of overwhelmed hospitals, people being triaged and left to die, refrigerated trucks storing bodies and mass graves.  We got a glimpse of it in New York, which has resources and will to beat back the infection. Now a majority of states are on the cusp of that situation. Many lack the resources,
will and know-how to mitigate the situation materially.  

To scrape through in April, New York relied on a huge number of traveling doctors, nurses and techs. Those resources are now wanted in most states. There are hospitals in Texas currently bidding $4,500 per week plus accommodation to nurses. At the same time, some hospital personnel are falling victim to the infection and others are becoming too burned out to work.

The next six to nine months are going to be harrowing - assuming at least a couple of vaccines are demonstrated safe and effective by the end of the year, manufacturing, shipping and storage get worked out, people trust them enough to ensure adequate numbers are vaccinated and serious side effects don’t arise months after vaccination and immunity lasts for at least months. If all of those stars align we may have sufficient  population immunity to resume something like normal life.

No, it isn't. What we know about colds or other diseases that usually transmit in schools doesn't necessarily transfer, and in fact doesn't appear to apply.

As a counterpoint: when schools in in e.g. Helsinki (schools closing) and Stockholm (schools not closing) showed little to no difference in spread.

So they are having do 3x as much work to trace contacts of 1 infected person. That's my point. Edmonton is resorting to shutting things down to contain this latest outbreak. 

In many ways Edmonton was better prepared:

1. Manditory mask order in Edmonton (BC at the time was suggested);
2. Contact tracing app (BC waiting for the Federal one); and
3. Widespread a symptomatic testing particularly of high risk areas.

But this nation is filled with whiners, and their conservative politicians sold them a bill of goods about the lack of a need for sacrifice that they were eager to buy.

I agree with your criticism of conservative leaders, but I think that casting the blame on low-level individuals misses the point.  This passage from the article explains it well:

&gt;In some ways, these tragic errors in intuition are convenient for leaders, both within and outside the government. Birthday parties and vacations and nights out on the town are easily framed as personal choices free from government influence, even though other countries have gone much further in giving their citizens tools to keep themselves safe and make good decisions—nationally coordinated testing programs, extensive government aid for businesses, a clear and consistent message about safety. You can see the same finger-pointing dynamic in how some college presidents [set their charges up to fail](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/10/college-was-never-about-education/616777/), and then punished them for becoming infected. This approach reflects how, in America, blame for large-scale destruction and death is often shunted onto those with the least power to change policy or protect themselves. “Think about all the accidents on oil platforms, or drilling rigs,” Susan Silbey, a sociologist who studies safety at MIT, told me. “It's the same few companies over and over again.

The problem is that last week i brought some identical cool masks and gave one to my mum who was happy to wear them.

On friday, she took my car, (she ususally never do that) and i had left my mask there. I was wearing this mask the day before (thursday) i don't kniw what series of bad luck played, but she mistook my mask for hers, she wore it! For a good hour i think. She realized her mistake when she eventually saw her mask in her bag.

My mum has an auto immune disease and take some lowering immunity drug. I feel so angry and sad and guilty

As a summary.

I was wearing a mask on thursday.

My mum wore the same mask friday.

Measuring differences amongst only those infected by SARS-CoV-2 underscores the implicit conclusion that the vaccines are not expected to prevent infection, only modify symptoms of those infected.

This is weird for a virus because most vaccines target inducing a strong b cell/antibody response. Of course this can be tailored but historically we've worked on vaccines inducing antibodies and we've focused on that response as opposed to t cell.

COVID related healthcare costs should've been made free so the uninsured don't have to worry about paying $100 for a fucking test or not being able to afford hospital bills. More money should've been thrown at hospitals, hospital workers, and hospital equipment. No reason why people should be dying because there's not enough ventilators going around. 

There should've been a strict lockdown policy and country/state borders should've been closed. Access could've been allowed on a case by case basis after mandatory testing and enforced solo quarantining while a person waits for their test results. This should've stayed in place until infection rates were at max 10/day in an urban environment. Banning travel is great, not just from China, but anywhere else that had a big COVID issue. If you know has a big bedbug problem, would you want them to sit on your couch? Absofuckinglutely not right? That analogy should be good enough reason for anyone to understand why banning travel period would've been perfect. For those who need a place to stay, the government could've paid for their quarantining at a hotel/testing until they were cleared to leave on a plane with other people who were also cleared to leave.

The Trump administration handling COVID was basically neglecting it until shit hit the fan. The preventive costs would've been way cheaper than dealing with the aftermath now (e.g. business bailouts and shutdowns, ridiculously high unemployment rates, PUA). Just take a look at Vietnam to see what good policy was. Granted, the size difference is immense, but the planning was there.

What did we do? Hold anti-masks rallies and make COVID a bipartisan issue, withhold COVID related unemployment aid until election results because of political BS, charge people up the ass for COVID healthcare, etc. The list of stupid shit we did and the list of important things we did NOT do is too long to name.

&gt;Lockdowns will be neccessary.
Okay, we have SPH orders again and then what? We do this all again every 3 months? If our government leaders were honest, maybe that would work but they're not honest. It's always lockdown and then normalcy and then rinse/repeat and they have the nerve to be surprised that people are worn out by the constant surprises and lack of any consistency.

&gt;Numbers are rising like crazy, and wont stop with half hearted meassures like we have now.

These measures work when numbers are low and managable, not during rampant outbreaks. The issue with lockdowns is people seem to be confused as to their purpose. Lockdowns are not going to eradicate COVID once rampant outbreaks are occuring, but it will stop the outbreak. But stopping an outbreak and stopping COVID are not the same.

But there’s a similar tone from the opposite side as well that shows up screaming about how doing all the right things is so minor. Obviously lots has to change during a pandemic and I also wish we had locked down properly too, but we didn’t. So when people who have worn masks for months and avoided events since March are being told their desire to have their kids in school, go to their jobs, socialize comfortably with a few friends in summer (or now winter), workout with decent equipment, or take a trip is no big deal, well that’s not evil clearly but it’s certainly empathic either.

It’s exhausting trying to survive the no mask morons only to be told you’re basically one of them for suggesting anything that isn’t 6’ away from everyone for another year or whatever.

https://www.google.dk/amp/s/theconversation.com/amp/coronavirus-why-the-nordics-are-our-best-bet-for-comparing-strategies-135344

Yes, experts are comparing countries in Scandinavia. In many different studies, and specifically in case of the Coronavirus. This source right here tells you that the countries are comparable enough that the different outcomes will be due to differences in strategy. No, they are not 100% comparable. Two different Swedish cities are not 100% comparable. But the differences are small enough that experts confidently say that we can use the different results directly. That’s a fact. That’s what I’ve been saying all along. 

&gt;Prioritising those with a good chance of survival does not equal a collapse. If you want to make this about the definition of what a failure would be go ahead, but you have not proven anything.

You did not ask me if the system collapsed. You asked me if it failed. And it did - it failed it’s population by completely overestimating the need for triage, and refusing to adjust. This led to hundreds, if not thousands, dying completely needlessly. I’ve sent you proof of that. 

You want to call that not a failure, that’s on you. But saying “well the system didn’t collapse because we just let people die in their homes instead of in hospital beds” sure doesn’t sound like something that you should be proud of. 

&gt;Again, it is impossible to be unaffected, but Sweden was among the least. About tied with denmark ending up in 3rd by a 0.1% difference. In comparison to Europe it is far better.

Yes, about tied with Denmark. Who has one fifth the deaths per capita. Does that sound good to you? You know the lockdown was to prevent deaths, right? The economic damage is a consequence of the attempt to save lives. So same damage and way more deaths is a terrible outcome. Why do you believe it isn’t?

&gt;If there is an actual scientific analysis you have, use that instead. You are a layman and your analysis is absolutely worthless to me. What I am saying and has consistently said is that due to the major differences in the societies a 1:1 comparison is worthless.

As noted above, that’s just one scientific analysis. I’ve from the start said this is what people who actually know something are saying. I’ve never claimed it’s my baseless opinion, but I can see why you would think that. After all, so far you’ve sent me absolutely no evidence in favour of your opinion. Makes sense that you would think I’m the same. But I’m really not. 

A 100% comparison is impossible. Yet experts are saying that between Sweden, Norway and Finland, the huge differences in outcome are due to the differences in strategy. Not me. Experts are saying that. 

&gt;Because failure and success should not be purely based on the rest of the world.

When we are comparing which strategy was the best, of course it should. Would you still say the strategy was a success if there were zero deaths in all other countries?

&gt;For example, Finland had more than 12 times the amount of deaths of New Zealand, does that make Finland a failure?

You will be hard pressed to find two countries that are less comparable than Finland and New Zealand. Are you suggesting that, if I should be allowed to compare Sweden to Norway, then it would be the same as comparing Finland to New Zealand?",,,1603804928,{},ga9pt6i,False,t3_jhjbch,False,True,t1_ga9grn8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jhjbch/did_swedens_coronavirus_experiment_pay_off_not/ga9pt6i/,1603804939,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

I served as one of the non-armed guys who go into cities that have been firebombed and bombed, and put out the fires and find people in the rubble and save them.

The assumption is you will never have enough ressources to save everybody. The doctors may be dead and the place with medical supplies could be burned, general chaos is the assumption.

Anyway, you set up a medical station in tents for treating survivors, and then you go into the bombed place and search and dig for people. 

This is what the first searcher team does:

You go around and shout for people, and those you find you sort in 1,2 and 3. Everybody gets attached a number.

1 are those that can walk themselves to the medical place, so they are given a couple minutes or care, like bandage big bleedings, and then given directions to the medical center and told to go there.
  
That can also be like people that lost an eye. If you find a guy with eyes blown out but he can walk and another guy that can walk and has eyes, you tell the eye guy to help the no eye guy get to the medical center.

2 are those that can't walk and can be saved - like if you are burned or lost a foot. They get a 2 and their location are marked down on a map, and you tell them ""we'll get back to you!""

3 are those that are either not possible to save or too much work to save. Like if they were burned all over or lost their legs or had gut injury. Or even if you had a small injury, but were trapped under rubble and it would take a long time to dig them out. 

They get number 3 and are left to die. We were supposed to also tell them ""we'll get back to you!""

At the treatment center they'd always treat 2s ahead of 1s, and the 3s would only be picked up in case all the 1s and 2s got done, and the assumption was that that was not likely to happen.

So the chilling job was separating people in 2 or 3, especially if they are like on the edge. Like this ""this guy would normally be saved, but we could save 5 guys in the time it takes to save him, so we do the 5 guys instead and this guy dies"".

It's almost certainly a death sentence to get a 3. And the procedure was just like ""look at them for 30 seconds, and then make the call.""",,,1603804615,{},ga9pb20,False,t3_jiep1c,False,True,t1_ga9dkpv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/jiep1c/poland_there_are_no_places_in_the_hospital_the/ga9pb20/,1603804627,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

　　Israeli media Channel 12 reported on Monday that the Mossad had brought the Chinese vaccine to Israel in recent weeks. It's unclear exactly how the intelligence agency acquired the vaccine.

&amp;#x200B;

Multiple government sources have ""indirectly"" confirmed the report to local media. The vaccine was reportedly procured in order to study its formulation and further explore vaccination options. In addition to this, a senior Israeli Ministry of Health official confirmed that Israel is seeking to purchase the neocrown vaccine from other countries.

&amp;#x200B;

Israel has reportedly developed its own new coronavirus vaccine, but its testing process is still at an early stage. Last week, the Israeli Institute for Biological Research (IIBR) in Nesbitzona announced its new coronavirus vaccine, called ""Brilife. The vaccine has received all the necessary approvals, and the first phase of clinical trials is expected to begin next week. First, the vaccine will be tested on about 100 volunteers, and if all goes well, an additional 1,000 people will be enrolled in the second phase of the trial next spring.

&amp;#x200B;

　　In recent weeks, there has been a sharp increase in the number of new coronavirus infections in Israel, with the total number of cases now reaching 310,000.

If we’d relied on being a remote island, we’d be broken. We had 205 known cases when we locked down (edit: on March 25th), more than enough to kick on and create a full blown outbreak.

That was what broke the back of the virus and forced the R0 below 1.

Many European countries did exactly the same. Denmark locked down around mid-March when they had a few hundred cases and no deaths. Same for Austria.

They tend to cause very mild common cold symptoms in people.  They’ve been studied rigorously since the 1950s.  Short term immunity to them, is very well known and well documented and proven as scientific fact.  In fact even in a recent very exhaustive study a few years ago, they had found that some people had gotten sick from the exact same virus strand twice in one year.  They caught and got sick in the early spring time, and then later that year after fall got another cold and gene sequencing showed it was the exact same betacoronavirus.

With all that being said, SARS-CoV-2 is different from Human Coronavirus.  It’s a SARS-like Coronavirus, which are extremely rare and exotic strains found only in bats and camels and shit.  They cause very severe disease so it is possible the body develops robust memory cells in response to it.

*But...* it’s possible it doesn’t.

Scientists have no idea why we have such short term immunity to human coronavirus.  It could simply be that our human immune systems simply didn’t evolve to deal with coronavirus over the centuries.  These are zoonotic viruses meaning they mutates are some point in the past maybe only a couple hundred years ago, to start infecting humans.

The thing of it is, right here, right now we do not know how long immunity truly lasts against SARS-CoV-2.  We have absolutely no idea.  We can measure antibodies.  We can measure memory cells.  We can track how long these things last. But we don’t actually KNOW if their presence actually prevents us from getting sick.  We likely won’t know that for quite some time.

What we do know is that there has been a small handful of scientifically proven re-infections with SARS-CoV-2.  We don’t know if that’s exceedingly rare, or if it’s more common and just not being observed.
