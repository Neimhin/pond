&gt; A significant concern is that SARS-CoV-2 could establish in natural wildlife populations that could lead to transmission events to humans. We have determined that deer mice are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and that virus can persist for up to 21 days. Moreover, efficient transmission to other deer mice occurred, suggesting the potential for sustained persistence in natural populations of deer mice. 

(They note that one silver lining of this fact is that we may be able to use deer mice as an animal model for COVID-19 disease studies.)

Cult-y conditions make loyal soldiers, and that's the point, and that's why they send missionaries to places where everyone is either Mormon or purposefully not Mormon.



Side note, Mormon membership numbers are self reported, based on the church's definition, and not auditable. IIRC, if they lose track of someone because they move or stop attending the person is still counted as Mormon until they are 110 years old.

While Covid primarily kills older populations, ""long Covid"" appears to impact younger people at nearly as high rates as older people.

It's suspected that these issues may continue to progress, and could lead to problems like early onset dementia.

Meanwhile, the vaccine is incredibly safe. Even the most serious side effects, like myocarditis, are rare and resolve without permanent damage.

Old and slow people govern the WHO. (I have faith on the CDC, not the WHO).

&amp;#x200B;

As the topic is about Germany, [a german source](https://www.lgl.bayern.de/gesundheit/infektionsschutz/infektionskrankheiten_a_z/coronavirus/karte_coronavirus/index.htm#inzidenzgeimpft)

In the german state Bavaria, the number of infected per 100000 inhabitants is 9 times higher for unvaxxed.

So yes, your statement is kind of true, but while the vaccine does not completly stop the spread it does severally reduce it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Vaccine doesn't fully protect you.

Again technically true, but not the whole picture. The vaccine does not protect you 100%, but it does severally reduce the probability of severe disease and death.

It's not about black or white, but about different shades of gray.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;There are risks of blood clots, Myocarditis, and other things.

More than 6 billion doses of vaccine have been given worldwide. Yes, those risks exist, but they are mathematically irrelevant. The risk to get stuck by a lightning is higher than getting any of those risks.

&amp;#x200B;

The U.S. government has done plenty of shit to warrant mistrust by it's people. I mean how hard is it, as a global superpower, to provide clear and accurate information nationally during a global health crisis/emergency? Did we even see that happen during COVID ever? Nope, but when some corporations put together a vaccine in record time to sell to the government, they can do that. 

Politicians - governors, Congress, presidential administrations, etc have done many things not in the interest of the people, but for them and their own's self interests and pursuit of higher power, wealth, and social status. Looking at the food industry in America does nothing to bolster the idea to me that the FDA is any better than the rest of the federal government.

If healthy people would rather not get injected when they almost guaranteed can naturally fight off the virus, I can understand that. Now if people deny the vaccine and then start getting so sick they need to be hospitalized - taking up valuable medical resources and time and putting other, more vulnerable people at risk - that's super shitty.

Your critique is baseless, especially when applied to Denmark. You don't seem to be aware of how the whole thing unfolded. Danes largely stopped wearing masks well *before* removing other restrictions. The last restrictions were lifted in September, but you'd have had a hard time finding anyone wearing a mask in Copenhagen by April already.

Same in the rest of the Nordics. Actually in places like Norway there was never at any point in the pandemic a strong mask mandate; masks were at most recommended in crowded indoor places where social distancing wasn't otherwise possible.

Also, what on Earth does ""far too quickly"" mean? Denmark lifted restrictions gradually over the course of *months*, and cases kept declining in the meantime. Now they are rising again, which is only expected. Arguing that they lifted restrictions ToO qUiCkLy, basically implying that there's a direct causal link ""too quick removal"" --&gt; ""rising cases"", it's completely disingenious - as if cases aren't rising all around Europe, including places that never removed some restrictions.

The issue is that fires are now very rare. We use better materials and don't have open flames in the same way as the mid 1900s and earlier. It's a widespread issue of contention that firefighters are often part of unions that will fight and sue to keep the same level of staffing as decades ago, despite not really needing them.

I don't know all the ins and outs of it, so I won't pretend to be an expert. But when I see very minor emergency needs, about a dozen local stations all show up with a few trucks each. It almost seems like they finally have a reason to drive big trucks around, so literally all of them within a half hour radius show up.

I've personally called 911 a couple times, and despite there being absolutely no need for a firetruck, one or two come. It's because the firefighters are EMTs, so that part of the service is useful, but they go way overboard on resources.

Instead of the county owning 47 fire trucks for a million dollars each, a lot more lives could be saved with homeless shelters, heating shelters, and substance treatment places.",,,,1635906500,{},hj3jbuy,False,t3_ql5irr,False,False,t1_hj37dvq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ql5irr/more_than_2000_new_york_city_firefighters_out/hj3jbuy/,1636127260.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This also established the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) which does allow for compensation for vaccine injury.

All vaccines have some risk. If you are administering them to the whole population this can be a significant number of people though still far less then the injury the illness causes that the vaccines prevent. That’s a key component of evaluating vaccines for approval. 

So vaccines provide a strong net benefit to society and result in far less death and disease. We want more vaccines not less. If we don’t provide liability protection vaccines will not be developed. It’s not a conspiracy to help vaccine companies. It’s common sense public policy to encourage the development of vaccines that will save millions of lives.

Strip away PREP protection for the manufacturer's and open them up for liability if any long term risks are such bullshit? Why is that an unreasonable request? I must trust pFizer implicitly, but the shareholders don't have to.

Also to say there have never been long term side effects from a vaccine is unequivocally false. While the circumstances are quite different, and the consequence is derived due to the unique nature of Dengue virus, Dengvaxia is a prime example of a vaccine that caused potentially great harm in the longer term.  Sanofi had to later recall this vaccine 6 months after commercial approval due to an issue discovered by another Dr. who questioned (and was correcr) their data.  Plasma leakage in many individuals was greatly increased due to that rollout.

And while the particular reasoning for Dengvaxia and Sanofis recall and re-labeling was necessary, it demonstrates that unforeseen complications or oversights do happen.  They are not impossible.

[],,koi-lotus-water-pond,,,,[],,,,text,t2_57wqkofa,False,False,[],"The Navajo Nation managed to tame Covid-19 earlier this year, mounting a campaign that drove its vaccination rate far above the United States average, after the virus ravaged the Navajo people.  
  
But now the nation — the largest reservation in the United States — is enduring yet another virus surge, and experts and tribal leaders aren’t sure why. Other highly vaccinated tribes are also contending with a resurgent virus.  
  
Over the course of the pandemic, the Navajo went from having one of the country’s worst case rates in the spring of 2020 to being lauded in September by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease official, as an “example of success” in its fight against Covid-19. The rate of fully vaccinated tribal members — 70 percent, according to tribal data — is substantially higher than the nationwide rate of 58 percent.  
  
Indigenous leaders around the country have pushed hard to vaccinate their communities, knowing that Covid has had a disproportionate effect on Native American people, who now have the highest vaccination rate in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  
  
Despite their successes in overcoming mistrust in the federal government and inoculating hard-to-reach communities, the Navajo and other highly vaccinated tribes find themselves experiencing yet another virus surge.  
  
In addition to the Navajo Nation in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, the Indian Health Service said on Friday that it is seeing “intermittent” increases in the Billings area, covering Montana and Wyoming, and the Great Plains area, covering the Dakotas, Nebraska and Iowa. It said that tribal communities — though they tend to have high vaccination rates — are affected by the surrounding states and communities, which may have much lower vaccination rates.  
  
Many tribal members also commute to work in urban areas or border towns, where they may be at higher risk of exposure.  
  
The Blackfeet Nation of Montana, which has vaccinated nearly every eligible member, experienced a spike in August after recording few to no cases for weeks. That was after the tribe, confident after its successful vaccination campaign, voted to welcome back tourists by reopening its roads into the eastern section of the popular Glacier National Park. Cases are running relatively high among the Blackfeet as the virus surges throughout Montana, where vaccination rates in counties surrounding the reservation are as low as 38 percent.  
  
In Minnesota, the White Earth Nation, where 60 percent of eligible members are vaccinated, recently recorded its highest-ever surge in daily cases, said Ed Snetsinger, the tribe’s emergency manager.  
  
As for the Navajo, officials said the latest spike has been less severe than the nation’s first two, which came last winter and in the spring of 2020, because 70 percent of eligible members are vaccinated.  
  
The nation has exceeded 100 confirmed cases in a day several times recently, according to tribal data. Confirmed cases peaked at almost 400 a day in the winter, and reached a low point in single digits in June and July.  
  
The Navajo Nation is the largest U.S. tribe, with an official enrollment of nearly 400,000 members as of May.  
  
Jonathan Nez, the president of the Navajo Nation, said that some members brought the virus back to the reservation after visiting neighboring communities in Arizona and New Mexico, which have looser Covid regulations than the tribe does. The Navajo have been required to wear masks in public since April last year, indoors and out, but there is no such outdoor mandate in surrounding areas.  
  
“We do have multigeneration families living under one roof, and when someone brings Covid home, it spreads quickly in the house,” Mr. Nez said in an interview last week.  
  
While tribes have largely been successful in vaccinating their members, pockets of people continue to resist getting the shots, said Dr. Mary Owen, the director of the Center for American Indian and Minority Health at the University of Minnesota medical school and president of the Association of American Indian Physicians.  
  
“These pockets seem to be greater in the 17- to 45-year-old range,” said Dr. Owen, who is Tlingit. “From what I’m hearing and what I’m seeing in our clinic, is that people in this age group have a greater sense of invincibility and also seem to be relying more on social media for their news about the vaccine.”

Walensky, M.D., M.P.H., endorsed the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ (ACIP) recommendation that children 5 to 11 years old be vaccinated against COVID-19 with the Pfizer-BioNTech pediatric vaccine. CDC now expands vaccine recommendations to about 28 million children in the United States in this age group and allows providers to begin vaccinating them as soon as possible. ](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1102-PediatricCOVID-19Vaccine.html)",,,,1635899762,{},hj339mh,True,t3_qle7vm,False,False,t1_hj28c06,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qle7vm/cdc_panel_unanimously_recommends_pfizer_covid/hj339mh/,1636117040.0,24,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am well aware of the many side effects of Covid and there are dangers, that is totally correct. But I had covid in February, and honestly if it wasn't for the crazy state the whole world is in, I wouldn't even have noticed it. Felt more like having a slightly congested nose for one day. And now even though I still have antibodies, with evidence from the Doctor, my employer threatens to fire me if I don't get the vax. I think that's totally unacceptable and you are labeled a conspiracy theorist if you say that natural immunity is superior. And let's be honest here - it totally is.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore what infuriates me the most is that I have never heard a single so called ""health expert"" talking about making lifestyle changes to naturally strengthen your immune system and to exercise every day just a little bit. It's just the fucking vaccine, as if that somehow magically makes you healthy, but as much as you might disagree with me, you just can't inject health into your buddy.

This is something I've been struggling to understand. Since when do Bulgarians use American-style rhetoric around ""freedom"" and ""rights""? What's going on in the Bulgarian psyche that makes defending their freedom of choice (at the expense of all reason) so important all of a sudden?

I've been following the situation in Bulgaria pretty closely since the start of the pandemic (I'm still a citizen and visit frequently) and I've been really disappointed with the low vaccine uptake. I think the situation can largely be blamed on the poor government response (such as no information campaign, like you said) and the political crisis (unpopular GERB government, multiple elections, etc). The political leaders made a real mess of things. 

I keep hoping that people will wake up to how serious the pandemic is and the consensus will shift towards vaccination, but it sounds like that's not going to happen. How can people there keep believing that Covid is nothing to worry about? Do they not realize that hospitals are full? Do they not believe that over 100 people are dying per day? Do they not care?

In recent months Jackson has reconnected with several former Ventavia employees who all left or were fired from the company. One of them was one of the officials who had taken part in the late September meeting. In a text message sent in June the former official apologised, saying that “everything that you complained about was spot on.”

Two former Ventavia employees spoke to The BMJ anonymously for fear of reprisal and loss of job prospects in the tightly knit research community. Both confirmed broad aspects of Jackson’s complaint. One said that she had worked on over four dozen clinical trials in her career, including many large trials, but had never experienced such a “helter skelter” work environment as with Ventavia on Pfizer’s trial.

“I’ve never had to do what they were asking me to do, ever,” she told The BMJ. “It just seemed like something a little different from normal—the things that were allowed and expected.”

She added that during her time at Ventavia the company expected a federal audit but that this never came.

After Jackson left the company problems persisted at Ventavia, this employee said. In several cases Ventavia lacked enough employees to swab all trial participants who reported covid-like symptoms, to test for infection. Laboratory confirmed symptomatic covid-19 was the trial’s primary endpoint, the employee noted. (An FDA review memorandum released in August this year states that across the full trial swabs were not taken from 477 people with suspected cases of symptomatic covid-19.)

“I don’t think it was good clean data,” the employee said of the data Ventavia generated for the Pfizer trial. “It’s a crazy mess.”

A second employee also described an environment at Ventavia unlike any she had experienced in her 20 years doing research. She told The BMJ that, shortly after Ventavia fired Jackson, Pfizer was notified of problems at Ventavia with the vaccine trial and that an audit took place.

Since Jackson reported problems with Ventavia to the FDA in September 2020, Pfizer has hired Ventavia as a research subcontractor on four other vaccine clinical trials (covid-19 vaccine in children and young adults, pregnant women, and a booster dose, as well an RSV vaccine trial; NCT04816643, NCT04754594, NCT04955626, NCT05035212).

In her 25 September email to the FDA Jackson wrote that Ventavia had enrolled more than 1000 participants at three sites. The full trial (registered under NCT04368728) enrolled around 44 000 participants across 153 sites that included numerous commercial companies and academic centres. She then listed a dozen concerns she had witnessed, including:

Participants placed in a hallway after injection and not being monitored by clinical staff
Lack of timely follow-up of patients who experienced adverse events
Protocol deviations not being reported
Vaccines not being stored at proper temperatures
Mislabelled laboratory specimens, and
Targeting of Ventavia staff for reporting these types of problems.
Within hours Jackson received an email from the FDA thanking her for her concerns and notifying her that the FDA could not comment on any investigation that might result. A few days later Jackson received a call from an FDA inspector to discuss her report but was told that no further information could be provided. She heard nothing further in relation to her report.

In Pfizer’s briefing document submitted to an FDA advisory committee meeting held on 10 December 2020 to discuss Pfizer’s application for emergency use authorisation of its covid-19 vaccine, the company made no mention of problems at the Ventavia site. The next day the FDA issued the authorisation of the vaccine.8

In August this year, after the full approval of Pfizer’s vaccine, the FDA published a summary of its inspections of the company’s pivotal trial. Nine of the trial’s 153 sites were inspected. Ventavia’s sites were not listed among the nine, and no inspections of sites where adults were recruited took place in the eight months after the December 2020 emergency authorisation. The FDA’s inspection officer noted: “The data integrity and verification portion of the BIMO [bioresearch monitoring] inspections were limited because the study was ongoing, and the data required for verification and comparison were not yet available to the IND [investigational new drug].”",,,,1635938251,{},hj4ufc1,False,t3_qlrr57,False,False,t1_hj4tgk2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qlrr57/covid19_researcher_blows_the_whistle_on_data/hj4ufc1/,1636155520.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The positivity rate is something like 0.2%, that's the key takeaway. Meaning that if anything, the testing is already overdimensionned (""too much people are being tested""). 

&gt;Why do you say that very little would be gained by not having infected people going about business as usual, especially in schools and offices?

That's not what I am saying. 

I am saying the benefit brought by additional tests would simply be completely negligeable at this stage, you may catch a couple but you'd have to run an *insane shitload* of useless tests to get only a few. The ratio benefit/cost would be super low with this figure, and you could do something else with the ressources.  

The 0.2% is already with ""risky"" people (symptomatic, close contacts as determined by the hokenjo, etc.). Meaning that the ratio in the rest of the population is likely lower than that, probably well under 1 per thousand, if not lower. 

Japan was very clear since the beginning they were not going for a zero covid strategy, that it was absolutely OK to have cases slip through the net, that getting all asymptotic cases was not even on the table and that the test/tracing was retrospective (we've got 2 years of press conferences about that...), contrary to many other countries. You can read tons of interviews by Hitoshi Oshitani, one of the main architects of the response. [This one](https://www.japanpolicyforum.jp/diplomacy/pt2020060516261910392.html) (already a bit old) for instance. The retrospective tracing was dropped a bit during the peak waves, but right now it's back on track.

One out of every 51 Coloradans is estimated to be currently contagious with COVID-19  
A frustrated Colorado Gov. Jared Polis on Tuesday all but ruled out issuing a new statewide mask order to curb sharply rising coronavirus infections and hospitalizations, saying that the responsibility instead lies with those who are unvaccinated against the virus to protect themselves.  
“The patience of most Coloradans is wearing very thin about why we should keep wearing masks just to protect the 20% of folks who haven’t taken the simple step to protect themselves,” the governor said during a briefing with reporters.   
Colorado now has the fifth-highest coronavirus case rate in the country, according to federal data. An estimated 1 in 51 Coloradans are currently contagious with COVID-19 as people hospitalized with the disease has surpassed 1,200 — the highest level since December 2020. About 80% of people hospitalized in the state with COVID-19 are unvaccinated.  
There are fewer than 150 intensive care beds available statewide, and a 16-county region in southwest Colorado on Tuesday reported 0% available ICU capacity, though that percentage can change quickly in the region’s small hospitals.  
In response to the alarming trends — more than 2,600 new coronavirus infections are now being reported per day in Colorado, a roughly 600% increase from case rates in July — Polis over the weekend issued executive orders giving the state greater authority to direct transfers of patients between hospitals and also laying the legal groundwork for hospitals to ration care if they become overwhelmed.  
The state has also asked for federal emergency medical teams to come to Colorado to help with staffing shortages in the state’s hospitals. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment on Sunday ordered hospitals to suspend cosmetic surgeries in order to free up staff and bed space; some hospitals have already gone further, delaying needed but non-emergency procedures.  
Asked Tuesday if he intended to issue more proactive orders to slow the spread of the virus, Polis balked. He said a statewide mask order isn’t a substitute for vaccination. He said it’s time for the unvaccinated to “quit procrastinating.”  
Nearly 80% of people eligible for vaccination in Colorado have received at least one dose of vaccine. No one under the age of 40 who has been fully vaccinated has died of COVID-19 in Colorado, Polis said, and death rates are dramatically lower for vaccinated people in older age groups.  
“The 20% that haven’t yet chosen to get protected are putting themselves at risk — which you can certainly argue is their own business, and I have no qualm if they have a death wish — but they are clogging our hospitals,” Polis said.  
While Colorado’s current COVID hospitalizations are about two-thirds of what they were during the state’s winter surge last year, more people are now hospitalized in Colorado for other reasons — car accidents, heart attacks and issues caused by delayed medical care. The state’s hospitals have not been more full during the pandemic.  
Dr. Rachel Herlihy said modeling estimates predict hospitalizations will peak later this month or early next month and are not expected to exceed the state’s capacity on the current trajectory. But, if virus transmission increases further, the state could see its hospital capacity breached.  
“As you can see with the projections, it’s going to be tight,” Polis said. “It is tight, and it’s going to be tight for the next several weeks.”",,,,1635956265,{},hj5y0nk,True,t3_qlxz3k,False,False,t3_qlxz3k,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qlxz3k/colorado_governor_says_onus_is_on_unvaccinated/hj5y0nk/,1636177167.0,114,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

#[Summary of Findings (data available as of 10/28/21) :](https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/)
* Cumulative Number of Child COVID-19 Cases: **6,396,278 total child COVID-19 cases reported**, and **children represented 16.6% (6,396,278/38,496,700) of all cases**
* Overall rate: 8,498 cases per 100,000 children in the population
* 100,630 child COVID-19 cases were reported the past week from 10/21/21-10/28/21 (6,295,648 to 6,396,278) 
* children represented 24.2% (100,630/416,059) of the weekly reported cases
* Over two weeks, 10/14/21-10/28/21, there was a 4% increase in the cumulated number of child COVID-19 cases since the beginning of the pandemic (218,332 cases added (6,177,946 to 6,396,278))
* Among states reporting, **between 5.1%-13.5% of children tested were tested positive**
* Among states reporting, **children ranged from 1.7%-4.2% of their total cumulated hospitalizations**, and **0.1%-2.0% of all their child COVID-19 cases resulted in hospitalization**
* Among states reporting, children were 0.00%-0.26% of all COVID-19 deaths, and 7 states reported zero child deaths
* ​In states reporting, 0.00%-**0.03% of all child COVID-19 cases resulted in death**

Now for some simple math: 
#`.03% X 6,396,278 = 1,918!!!`

This is **TWENTY TIMES** higher than your figure.

&gt;It is so low it is hard to accurately measure to any statistical significance.

HOLY FUCKING SHIT what is the matter with you? Because you consider them a rounding error it's ok to ignore it? To do nothing about it? Would you still feel this way if it were *your* kid?

94 dead kids is OK with you, but how about 1,918? Let's do nothing and make it a cool 2000, or 2500.

&gt;The only real reason this is being promoted for children, is not to protect them, it is to protect adults.

No, it's ***not*** to benefit any one segment of society, it's to benefit ***ALL*** of society. **PERIOD.**

&gt;I can already predict that this is going to quickly become mandatory for a lot of children,

Like the *other* ***FOURTEEN*** mandatory vaccinations children in America have to take before being allowed to attend school? Hell, let's bring back polio and smallpox in the name of ""freedom"". That's where this line of thinking leads.

&gt;if the vaccination rate of all adults was above 90% a long time ago, and Delta had not spread like wildfire, then rushing for approval for under 12 would not even be a consideration right now.

Well, Delta *did* rage like wildfire because too many people thought they knew better than science and modern medicine and here we are. There's bound to be yet another variant give the number of walking disease vectors out flaunting their ignorance. This have *every* possibility of turning out like the 1918 pandemic, which experienced a ""W"" shaped mortality rate. High at first, then went down, followed by a spike, a dip, then as people assumed it was licked, let their guard down, and **WHAM!** A tidal wave of deaths.

&gt;The whole reason there is so much pressure is due to risk in adults, not children.

So I guess that 2% of kids that get Covid and get hospitalized (123,558 children hospitalized) just aren't worth worrying about, eh?

I think they started doing boosters for elderly in  September, but only just opened it to the broader population a couple weeks ago. No clue how well booster uptake has been.

With a new more contagious version spreading, no restrictions, waning vaccination protection, and room for more vaccine uptake, there's not much surprise there is a surge in cases. The interesting part if why are their deaths per Capita is about double Sweden, who is less vaccinated. My guess is cases and case detection. Sweden has had double the confirmed cases  cumulative per Capita as Denmark despite doing 1/10th the testing. So the real difference in cases is probably much larger. Sweden is probably undercounting deaths compared to Denmark because of the detection. But the unvaccinated people in Sweden probably have a lot more natural immunity.",,,,1635958562,{},hj64603,False,t3_qlsys7,False,False,t1_hj5wmf1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qlsys7/denmark_experts_recommend_return_of_facemasks/hj64603/,1636180342.0,14,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

---------------------------

Covid shots for children ages 5 to 11 years have finally been authorized, but it may take a few days or even a week or more before kid-size doses of the vaccine are widely available in your area.

On Tuesday, a panel of experts for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gave its blessing for a lower dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to protect younger children against Covid-19. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the C.D.C. director, has signed off on the recommendations, clearing the way for the parents of 28 million children between the ages of 5 and 11 in the United States to get their kids vaccinated.

But parents rushing to make vaccine appointments are likely to discover they can’t get the shot as quickly as they might have hoped. In the past, shots for older children or booster shots for adults immediately became available a day or two after the committee vote. But that’s because the vaccines for children 12 and older are identical to those given to adults. The shots created just for younger children are still being distributed around the country.

Younger children will receive one-third of the dose authorized for those 12 and older, delivered with smaller needles and stored in smaller vials to avoid mix-ups with adult doses. Like older kids and adults, young children will return three weeks after the first dose for a second shot.


“Vaccination for 5 to 11 is different than vaccinations for adults,” Jeffrey D. Zients, the White House Covid-19 response coordinator, said in an interview. “This is a new program designed from the ground up specifically for kids.”

Mr. Zients said that there was plenty of supply to fully vaccinate all children in that age group and that 15 million doses had already been packed and shipped. By Friday, more than seven million doses will have been delivered to thousands of sites around the country.

“We’ll see the first sets of kids start to get vaccinated late this week,” Mr. Zients said.

The full children’s Covid vaccination program should be fully “up and running” sometime during the week of Nov. 8, Mr. Zients said. Children can be vaccinated at more than 20,000 sites, including pediatric and family medical practices, children’s hospitals, pharmacies and school clinics, Mr. Zients said. Parents can call their pediatricians, check local health department websites or go to Vaccines.gov to find locations offering the children’s Covid vaccine.

The children’s vaccination campaign is expected to follow a different pattern from that for adults, many of whom just walked into pharmacies to get their shots. Survey data shows that 62.8 percent of parents say a family’s regular doctor’s office is the most trusted place to get a child vaccinated. Only 34 percent said they trusted getting children vaccinated at a local pharmacy. Just 14.8 percent said they would let a child get vaccinated at school without a parent present.

While health officials urged parents to be patient as they try to schedule appointments in the coming days, the larger question is how many parents will seek out vaccinations for young children. Some parents, even those who are vaccinated, are worried about giving children a brand-new vaccine, especially since most coronavirus cases in youngsters are mild.

According to a survey released Thursday by the Kaiser Family Foundation, only 27 percent of parents are eager to get a vaccine for their younger children as soon as one is authorized, while a third say they will wait to see how the vaccine is working. Three in 10 parents say they will definitely not get the vaccine for their teenagers or children.

Members of the C.D.C. committee who recommended the vaccines noted that they planned to get their own children and grandchildren vaccinated. They cited data showing that for every nine children vaccinated, one Covid infection would be prevented. Several members also said they were reassured by the safety data for the vaccine and gravely concerned about the toll Covid-19 had taken on children and their caregivers.

To date, nearly two million children ages 5 to 11 in the United States are known to have been infected with the virus, and 8,300 have been hospitalized. A third of those hospitalized were admitted to intensive care units, and at least 170 have died. More than 120,000 children in the United States have lost a parent or caregiver to the disease.

“I have a child in this age group, and I’m going to take my child to get this vaccine,” said Veronica McNally, a committee member who leads the Franny Strong Foundation, a childhood vaccine advocacy group in West Bloomfield, Mich. “To say that this disease does not impact kids is not an accurate statement.”

Dr. Matthew F. Daley, a committee member and senior investigator at the Kaiser Permanente Institute for Health Research in Aurora, Colo., said it was important that doctors listen to parents’ concerns about the safety and potential side effects of the vaccine.

“It’s understandable you have questions and concerns,” Dr. Daley said, speaking to parents just before the committee voted. “I would encourage you to talk to your child’s pediatrician. They know your child, they know your family, and they can walk you through this.”",,,,1635903536,{},hj3cc5b,False,t3_qlirc8,False,True,t1_hj3bxz8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qlirc8/how_to_get_a_covid_vaccine_shot_for_your_kid/hj3cc5b/,1636122322.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

- ""No, it's not to benefit any one segment of society, it's to benefit ALL of society."" Incorrect. My child - like all children - are part of society. My child is not at high risk, it is actually astronomically low. Same with all children.


To put things in perspective - her risk is multiple times lower than the risk of death from slipping we take whenever we take a bath.

Meanwhile, the vaccine *does have risks* to children, small but measurable. There have been cases of myocarditis and pericarditis. So you're asking me to put my child at small risk A, to protect her against another small risk B? That is not a choice I would normally be willing to make, I would normally say ""the hell with it"" and leave it to chance, because at the end of the day I do not have the data to make the decision.

But we all know that is not where we are going here, there is going to be enormous peer pressure and mandates that force parents to get their children vaccinated against something that is not dangerous, in order to protect other people, **who in most cases ARE AT RISK DUE TO THEIR OWN ACTIONS**.

&gt;The number of job postings mandating candidates have a Covid-19 vaccine doubled since the end of September, according to an analysis published Tuesday by Ladders, a career site for higher earners.

&gt;“To see something doubling month-over-month indicates real change in the economy and companies’ behavior,” said Marc Cenedella, founder and CEO of Ladders.

&gt;Job-listing trends typically take years or even decades to evolve, he said.

&gt;The share of listings requiring a vaccine remains low relative to the overall number, however. About 10,000 job posts — 5% of the total — required a Covid-19 vaccine as of Oct. 31, according to the analysis.

&gt;But the rapid acceleration is remarkable and suggests the trend will continue for the foreseeable future, Cenedella said.

&gt;(The analysis, which is of positions paying at least $80,000 a year, examines listings on the Ladders site as well as public ads on corporate career websites across the U.S.)

&gt;Similarly, 2% of all U.S. job postings on job site Indeed advertise that vaccination is required, according to AnnElizabeth Konkel, an economist who analyzed company data as of Oct. 22.

&gt;By comparison, about 0.5% of Indeed job posts had a vaccine requirement two months earlier.

&gt;The share in October was also higher for certain occupations relative to others: Nearly 7% of pharmacy and child-care job postings included vaccination requirements, according to Indeed.

&gt;The Biden administration is soon expected to issue a rule requiring larger private-sector employers to mandate vaccines for workers. (The unvaccinated would have the option to get tested on a weekly basis and wear a mask at work.) It’s expected to cover two-thirds of the private-sector workforce.

&gt;The Food and Drug Administration gave Pfizer full U.S. approval of its Covid vaccine in August. The move was expected to encourage some unvaccinated Americans to get the shot and give companies more confidence to require it.

&gt;A quarter of workers in October said their employer has required them to get a Covid-19 vaccine, up from 9% in June, according to a survey published Thursday by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

&gt;Adults with a household income of at least $90,000 are more likely than those with incomes below $40,000 to report a Covid-19 vaccine requirement at work — 31% versus 18%, respectively, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation survey.

&gt;There’s also a political split — 26% of Republicans said their employer requires vaccination or that they want their company to mandate vaccination; the share is 77% among Democrats and 46% for independents.

&gt;Some companies and municipalities have fired workers or put them on unpaid leave for refusing to comply with vaccine mandates.

&gt;New York City, for example, put about 9,000 municipal workers on unpaid leave, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday. About 9 in 10 city workers covered by a mandate have been vaccinated, he said.",,,,1635967980,{},hj6sww3,True,t3_qm275q,False,False,t3_qm275q,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qm275q/vaccine_mandates_are_surging_in_job_listings/hj6sww3/,1636192862.0,33,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The region that seems to be most notable is the middle-east. Despite official statistics suggesting that the region has got off relatively lightly, it might actually have been the hardest-hit by the pandemic (even worse than Europe and Latin America).

It also confirms what I've suspected for a long time: that the countries with the highest death counts are sometimes just better at counting. The US and Brazil officially have the highest death tolls (and Brazil is in the top 10 even on a per capita basis). But that's because their official death tolls are more accurate than many other hard-hit nations.

Conversely, India is undercounting by a factor of 10, which would mean that it has several times more deaths than the US and Brazil put together.

This is a gross misunderstanding of how vaccination works. To simplify in terms of dice, to infect an unmasked/unvaccinated person in a closed room, the virus will have to role 8 or better on a 20 sided die. If a target is the only person masked, it would have to roll a 12 or higher. If everyone is masked, it would have to roll a 16 or higher. If no one is masked and only the target is vaccinated, it would have to roll and 14 or higher. If everyone is vaccinated it would have to roll natural 20s. Vaccination does not confer immunity. It makes it HARDER for the virus to infect you. The virus needs fresh targets to proliferate. If everyone in a group is vaccinated, the numbers are just about impossible for the virus to get rolling. If only one person is vaccinated thinking they're unstoppable in a sea of the unvaccinated, they're a damn fool. They have an advantage, but they are not invulnerable. Vaccination is about getting just about everyone vaccinated to halt the spread of the virus. Every vaccinated person is a hill for the virus to climb, and every unvaccinated person is sweet down hill coast, and that downhill coast right next to a steep hill makes it that much easier.",,,,1635966575,{},hj6pa4d,False,t3_qlsys7,False,False,t1_hj5ag6s,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qlsys7/denmark_experts_recommend_return_of_facemasks/hj6pa4d/,1636191043.0,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Actual goals need to be set for it to be reasonable to continue to ask people to follow restrictions. 21 months into this that is not an unreasonable ask, especially when virtually no one else in surrounding communities is following any Covid restrictions anymore.

It's 100% possible that SUNY has a super-secret ""get out of Covid"" plan laid out, but as a long-time faculty member I can tell you it's unlikely. Most likely what is going on is that no one wants to take a leadership/responsibility role, in case there is another flare up of Covid. The outbreak at Oneonta last year pre-vaccine scared the pants off of administrators. The big difference being, of course, that last year there was not a 95%+ vaccination rate on campuses... there was a 0% vaccination rate, with the exception of people who might have been enrolled in the various vaccine studies.

From my recollection, Pfizer has to collect 6 months of safety data after people in the trial got their second dose before they can apply for full approval. We should be close to that mark if we haven’t reached it already. 

Once they they submit for approval the FDA has like 10 months to get it done although they will likely expedite it. For the 16+ age group it took about 3.5 months for full approval to get done.

&gt;There is no evidence that you can get COVID-19 by preparing or eating food, including wild hunted game meat in the United States. However, hunters can get infected with many diseases when processing or eating game. Hunters should always practice good hygiene when processing animals by following these food safety recommendations:

&gt;Do not allow contact between wildlife and domestic animals, including pets and hunting dogs.

&gt;Do not harvest animals that appear sick or are found dead.

&gt;Keep game meat clean and cool the meat down as soon as possible after harvesting the animal.

&gt;Avoid cutting through the backbone and spinal tissues and do not eat the brains of wildlife.


&gt;When handling and cleaning game:

&gt;Wear rubber or disposable gloves.

&gt;Do not eat, drink, or smoke.

&gt;When finished handling and cleaning game:

&gt;Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.

&gt;Clean knives, equipment, and surfaces that were in contact with game meat with soap and water and then disinfect them.

&gt;Cook all game meat thoroughly (to an internal temperature of 165°F or higher).

But now we do have vaccines, and I have the misfortune of living in one of the handful of states in the U.S. where the indoor mask mandate is still in place and the ONLY state where there's an outdoor mask mandate. As I can't tolerate wearing a mask for any length of time (I worked from home from the start of the pandemic until mid-summer this year) living ""the life I want"" is out of the question.

The only reason I am able to be at work is because I work with a group of adults (all vaccinated) who are able to reasonably evaluate risk and have, with only a couple exceptions, decided that whatever risk exists, it's not worth the discomfort and disconnection from others that wearing a mask entails. Those who disagree mask up themselves. 

One thing I have found in talking to other vaccinated people in my very, very liberal city is that not one person in 20 wants to be wearing a mask. It IS a big deal, it DOES interfere with life, and it's simply not necessary for those that have been vaccinated (although, again, if people want to mask up, they obviously have that option. They can even double-mask if it makes them feel better).

It sounds like the majority of those applications will be rejected since they’re going to check whether these guys have been consistently religious or suddenly decided they were. That said, 1000 FDNY are on unpaid leave compared to those 34 cops, so either there is a real gap in compliance or they have different strategies. Ultimately, I think the effect will be overblown because broadly speaking, when push comes to shove, the overwhelming majority of people in other jobs have eventually given in. They may still resent it, but psychologically, it’s easier to accept if it’s out of their hands. 

Another possible factor is that cops are more aware on some level that most of them are inessential.

WASHINGTON — Two months after the Pentagon began requiring all troops to get the coronavirus vaccine or face dismissal, the vast majority have now had shots, in part because none received a religious exemption, military officials said.

While vaccine exemptions are often broadly worded, requests based on religious beliefs are coming under close scrutiny in the military and at the Department of Veterans Affairs, the first federal agency to impose a mandate. They will likely be followed by the rest of the federal government, where most workers are required to be vaccinated by the end of this month. The Biden administration will release a federal vaccine requirement for private companies with 100 or more employees “in coming days,” a representative for the Department of Labor said this week.
The widespread federal and private sector mandates pose a test for the country, and the military and Veterans Affairs are being closely watched by companies and legal experts. Across the country, there are at least 40 legal challenges to vaccine and testing mandates issued by cities, hospitals, universities and other employers that have yet to move forward, while others have been knocked back.

A federal appellate court removed a temporary injunction last week that had allowed health care workers in New York to seek religious exemptions to the state’s mandate.

The Defense Department has granted a smattering of exemptions, including to people who were already leaving the military or have medical issues. However, some of those exemptions, like for people who recently had the coronavirus, may soon be reversed. Officials declined to say how many service members had requested an exemption but said the number was not large.

“I don’t see the courts interfering with the vaccines in any other context than possibly religious exemptions,” said Dorit Rubinstein Reiss, a law professor and expert on vaccine mandates at the University of California, San Francisco. “But I don’t know if courts will be willing to second-guess the military.”

The leaders of most major religious organizations have recommended that their members get the vaccine. Officials say that no one is actively discouraging people in the military from seeking a religious exemption. But anyone seeking one from the Pentagon or Department of Veterans Affairs would be required to have an established history of adherence to a religion that prohibits vaccines, among other things.

“If members of the military want to apply for one, then they should be able to,” said John Kirby, a spokesman for the Pentagon. “And they should be able to make their case.”

About 97 percent of the country’s 1.3 million active-duty service members have had at least one dose of the vaccine, and roughly 87 percent have had both shots. The Air Force, which this week became the first division to hit the deadline for its mandate for full vaccination, will release its latest vaccine data on Wednesday. About 11,000 of its 326,855 active-duty personnel are likely still unvaccinated and facing possible expulsion.

At the Department of Veterans Affairs, where thousands of workers who interact with patients were supposed to be fully vaccinated by Oct. 8, officials have taken a dim view of such exemptions. Since the department issued a vaccine mandate for its 115,000 frontline health care workers this past summer, about 88 percent of the 380,000 employees covered by the mandate have had at least one dose, falling short of officials’ hopes for nearly full vaccination.

In hospitals or nursing homes with particularly vulnerable populations, “I think that there will be a point there where it is an undue burden on us to ensure safety in the provision of health care,” said Denis McDonough, the secretary of the department, “at which point we’re going to have to deny religious exceptions.”
Vaccine reluctance in the military and the Department of Veterans Affairs mirrors that of civilian society, where vaccine rates are largely lower without such mandates. Some people have embraced vaccine conspiracy theories or have been fearful of possible side effects, or do not see themselves at risk for the virus.

Over the summer, as the Delta variant surged, military officials became alarmed at the growing number of deaths; over the fall, more active duty members died from the virus than in all of 2020, none of them vaccinated. In total, 71 active-duty service members have died. The Navy has led the charge with vaccinations, and roughly 99 percent in the service have had at least one shot ahead of the deadline to be fully vaccinated by the end of the month. Sailors were made acutely aware of the dangers of the virus early in the pandemic when an outbreak occurred on an aircraft carrier deployed to the Pacific Ocean. The captain, who pleaded with the Pentagon for help, was later fired.
There is a “common understanding that we often work in congregate settings such as shipboard environments and it is understood that in these settings, infectious diseases can spread very rapidly,” said Capt. Robert Hawkins, who leads the Navy Medicine’s Commander’s Action Group. “Immunizations have played a large role in readiness to conduct our mission for a long time, so we have had an understanding of their role in protecting our health and mission.”

In the Marines and the Army, about 93 percent of all troops have been at least partially vaccinated. Each service branch set its own deadlines and complex disciplinary procedures for those who decline shots, including extensive counseling sessions with clergy and commanders.

Still, only a doctor can give a medical exemption. “It’s a lawful order,” Mr. Kirby said of the vaccine mandate, and commanders have the right to “ultimately do what they need to do for the readiness of their unit, and if that comes to doing something of a punitive nature, they certainly have that right and that authority.”
On a military subgroup on the social news and message board site Reddit, people swapped advice on how to talk to those who were resisting a vaccine, from offering scientific evidence to refuting claims that vaccines stem from aborted fetal cells to noting that troops take far more dangerous risks in combat. Stressing health and safety and readiness is always better than threatening expulsion, commanders say.

The private sector is clearly watching. Many companies, including United Airlines, Procter &amp; Gamble, 3M and IBM, already have mandates, and several have indicated they will allow for “limited” medical or religious exceptions. Almost a dozen states have joined a lawsuit to prevent federal mandates from going forward.",,,,1635901933,{},hj38htn,True,t3_qlj6oc,False,True,t3_qlj6oc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qlj6oc/military_grants_few_vaccine_exemptions_as/hj38htn/,1636120086.0,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Who the fuck is claiming *that*?? Certainly not any of the manufacturers. Not for *ANY* vaccine, not at *ANY* time in history.

&gt;then why hide behind full legal indemnity?

You mean the [legal indemnity that's been around since **1941**??](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/300aa-22). You act like this is something new just for the Covid vaccines. It's ***NOT***.

&gt;Strip away PREP protection for the manufacturer's and open them up for liability if any long term risks are such bullshit? 

Yes, let's allow ***thousands*** of scammers, fakers, and greedy ambulance chasers abuse the courts to reduce our only apparatus for manufacturing life saving drugs to ashes. I'm sure that will go well for us all. 

&gt;Also to say there have never been long term side effects from a vaccine is unequivocally false. 

What you fail to mention is that ***YOU*** are the *ONLY* one saying that. Straw man much?

&gt;While the circumstances are quite different, and the consequence is derived due to the unique nature of Dengue virus, Dengvaxia is a prime example of a vaccine that caused ***potentially*** great harm in the longer term.

Key **WEASEL WORD:** ""***POTENTIALLY***"" 

You are ***really*** scraping to find an example here, and intentionally obtuse in providing meaningful information to back up your assertion.

&gt;Sanofi had to later recall this vaccine 6 months after commercial approval due to an issue discovered by another Dr. who questioned (and was correcr) their data.

Utter ***BULLSHIT!!!** Sanofi (French manufacturer) did **NOT** ""recall"" that vaccine. [The Philippine Department of Health is the one who banned it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengvaxia_controversy) for *clearly* political reasons. Dengvaxia is approved in both the European Union and the United States, plus 19 other countries and is *still* available today. It is only indicated for people who have previously had Dengue fever, which was the previously unknown issue in the Philippines.

Considering that Dengue fever infects [**390 million people a year**, with about 500,000 requiring hospitalization, and **~40,000 dieing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever), the potential for harm from the vaccine is by ***FAR*** outweighed by the benefit. Just like *EVERY* other vaccine.

&gt;And while the particular reasoning for Dengvaxia and Sanofis recall 

#*NOT*. RECALLED. EVER.

Quit spreading disinformation to make you example sound more critical than it was.

&gt;I don't understand why anyone would be condemned for not wanting to 100% trust a medication that the manufacturer will not risk exposure to suit from.

They lowered the age by 2 years to ensure that instead of 18 year olds, they got 16 year olds all going out, so it would be even harder for the kids to escape and head home, in the past few decades, too.

LMAO! You're quoting CNBC quoting the CDC director who is using numbers that are *INCOMPLETE* because they only counted cases which included the necessary demographics to break it down by age. That's why [their own numbers broken down into ***demographic*** categories](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#demographics) show only 607,838 deaths, when [*their* ***TOTAL*** numbers](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home) show a TOTAL of 745,274. A discrepancy of **137,435 DEATHS.** That's **leaving out 18%!!!**

Also take note that the demographics page says ""*These data are not generalizable to the entire U.S. population.*"", something the article you desperately cling to as definitive completely FAILS to mention.

I'm not concerned with *just* childrens deaths, or just adult deaths, I'm only concerned about ***ALL*** DEATHS, and the *actual* death rate is ***HIGHER*** than what you are claiming.

&gt;""No, it's not to benefit any one segment of society, it's to benefit ALL of society."" Incorrect. 

Holy crap are you thick.

&gt;My child is not at high risk, it is actually astronomically low. Same with all children.

That *really* isn't the point now, is it? At any rate, there hasn't been 94 child deaths in the 5-11 age range, there's been 172 (according the the *SAME* CDC demographic source cited by articles quoting the CDC director). Nearly TWICE, and again that number is artificially low because they only included deaths that included sufficiently complete demographic data to compare properly. Add another 18% to 172 and we're over 200 for 5-11.

Now add to that: ""[Over two weeks, 10/14/21-10/28/21, **there was a 4% increase in the cumulated number of child COVID-19 cases since the beginning of the pandemic**](https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/)""

Clearly Covid infections in the 5-11 demographic are *still* growing. The ONLY thing that's going to stop that is getting vaccinated.

&gt;To put things in perspective - her risk is multiple times lower than the risk of death from slipping we take whenever we take a bath.

This is such [**COMPLETE** ***BULLSHIT***](https://safekids.org/sites/default/files/documents/ResearchReports/report_to_the_nation_protecting_children_in_your_home.pdf) it's not even funny. The majority of bath time deaths among children come from drowning or scalding. The number of ***deaths from slipping*** aren't available because there's **NO RECORDED CASE** of it even happening, despite the fact that [slip *injuries* account for &gt; 80% of ALL child bath injuries](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/124/2/541.full.pdf?download=true). Among *ALL* types of bath injuries, only [approximately 0.5% of unintentional injuries result in death.](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm6022.pdf)

Even as an absurd strawman argument, your claim doesn't hold water, as **MORE** kids have died from Covid this year than ***ALL*** other bath related injuries ***COMBINED***. LIterally **EVERY** source cited by both you and I confirm this. Look it up.

&gt;There have been cases of myocarditis and pericarditis.

Funny thing about that. [According to a 2020 review, approximately 5%-25% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 have had evidence of myocardial injury](https://www.thecardiologyadvisor.com/general-cardiology/heart-inflammation-after-covid-19-infection-in-athletes/). I am counted among those. I started having heart issues after having Covid for ***MONTHS*** and before the vaccine was even available.

#""[Myocarditis (or pericarditis or myopericarditis) from primary COVID19 infection occurred at a rate as high as 450 per million in young males. Young males infected with the virus are up **6 times more likely** to develop myocarditis **as those who have received the vaccine**](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.23.21260998v1).""

Let me reiterate this: You are **SIX TIMES** as likely to get Myocarditis from **COVID** than you are from the vaccine. The jury is still out as to the cause, and it *may* be that the Myocarditis is being ***caused*** by exposure to Covid in those already  vaccinated. That being said, [the risk for myocarditis was 0.146% among patients with COVID-19 and 0.009% among patients without COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7035e5.htm). Both rates are infinitesimal. Your fear mongering over Myocarditis from the vaccine is *TOTALLY* unfounded.

&gt;So you're asking me to put my child at small risk A, to protect her against another small risk B?

""**Risk**"". You ***completely*** and totally have demonstrated *any* ability whatsoever to evaluate ""risk"". The chances of Myocarditis from *ANY* cause are exceeding small. They're **WORSE** for those who contract Covid. They're **WORSE** for men than for women. Your child is at about as much risk as she is getting hit in the head by a meteor.

#""[Among patients with COVID-19, the risk for myocarditis was higher among males (0.187%) than among females (0.109%) and was highest among adults aged ≥75 years (0.238%), 65–74 years (0.186%), and 50–64 years (0.155%) and among children aged &lt;16 years (0.133%).](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7035e5.htm)""

Your hitorinics are *entirely* unjustified.

&gt;That is not a choice I would normally be willing to make

Because you're clearly a *terrible* decision maker. 

&gt;I would normally say ""the hell with it"" and leave it to chance, because at the end of the day I do not have the data to make the decision.

You *DO* have the data. It's been spoon fed to you, but instead you cling to out of context numbers from an article written by a non-medical professional.

&gt;But we all know that is not where we are going here, there is going to be enormous peer pressure and mandates that force parents to get their children vaccinated against something that is not dangerous, in order to protect other people, who in most cases ARE AT RISK DUE TO THEIR OWN ACTIONS. And I do not think that is correct.

Well, you'll do what you want to regardless. Facts don't seem to dissuade you, even when they're directly from the very studies by the experts that know this subject better than anybody. You seem to not want to vaccinate your child as a grudge against those too uninformed and stubborn to do what's right by them. In effect you're every bit as bad as them, because you're both doing it over emotional reasons instead of informed, reasoned medical reasons.
