&gt;In the clearest sign to date that Whitehall is actively considering additional measures, the Observer has learnt that the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) contacted local authorities on Friday to canvass their level of support for the “immediate rollout of the winter plan – plan B”.

&gt;The disclosure comes as senior doctors warn that operations are already being cancelled due to NHS staffing shortages and scientists warn of “a triple whammy” of respiratory illnesses this winter, with Covid, flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which causes cold-like symptoms but can be serious for children and older adults.

Adobe can likely make a reasonable accommodation for a lot of employees to work remotely, however not all employees can do so. If a reasonable accommodation can’t be made, then the company can fire them.

It's not surprising because our cold, wet, weather arrived in early October this year and has driven people inside, but it is discouraging. 

I've been taking a deep breath this weekend and facing the fact that it is indeed, best case, going to be late winter/early spring before we have a chance of things really improving (which for me to consider things improved 100% has to include the dropping of mask mandates).  

I can do it, and am going into this period with more focus than I had before.

Yes, the nastiness of measles it greatly underrated. It's argued that the official death toll from measles drastically underrates the true death toll, since it only counts deaths from the acute infection. A significantly greater number of people likely die from other pathogens because measles has literally erased their immune memory for those pathogens, by killing off the memory cells. It is weakening the immune system as you say, but in a very specific, particularly nasty way, different form other types of immune suppression. Here's a pretty interesting study covering this:

[Long-term measles-induced immunomodulation increases overall childhood infectious disease mortality](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4823017/)

&gt;The introduction of mass measles vaccination has reduced childhood mortality by 30 to 50% in resource-poor countries (5–8) and by up to 90% in the most impoverished populations (9, 10). The observed benefits cannot be explained by the prevention of primary measles virus (MV) infections alone (11, 12), and they remain a central mystery (13).  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;In other words, MV infection replaced the previous memory cell repertoire with MV-specific lymphocytes, resulting in “immune amnesia” (17) to nonmeasles pathogens. Previous investigations of virus-induced memory-cell depletion suggest that recovery requires re-stimulation, either directly or via cross-reactive antigens (26–29).  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Our results show that **when measles was common, MV infections could have been implicated in as many as half of all childhood deaths from infectious disease**, thus accounting for nearly all of the interannual fluctuations in childhood infectious disease deaths. **The reduction of MV infections was the main factor in reducing overall childhood infectious disease mortality after the introduction of vaccination.** \[emphasis added by reddit commenter\]

That was news to me, and Googling, I cannot see where you're getting it from. The closest I can see is this:

*Restrictions – from 80% additional public health restrictions will apply to unvaccinated people. Further details to be confirmed. For example, venues and events who require all patrons and staff to be vaccinated may be able to operate without public health restrictions. However, venues and events which allow unvaccinated people may continue to be subject to a range of public health restrictions such as capacity and density limits.*

But Qld isn't 80% yet, and when they are, they don't intend to stay at zero (no more quarantine for domestic entry).

[],,Neece235,,,,,,[],"Thank u, and exactly! I have so many downvotes at times because I like healthy discussions and knowledge, heck posts like this normally get downvotes. So understanding both sides and seeing where there is a middle ground, matters. The more we can conversate with one another and learn to communicate effectively the sooner this world can heal. Sadly the lack of human interactions over the last 2 yrs has created a nasty environment. People think it is my way or the highway, they think there is no discussion, both sides! It is frustrating. And honestly makes no sense whatsoever. 

However, if u learn to talk to one another and help one another to come to a mutual understanding, action happens. 

People who I know that were afraid of the vax, eventually got it. Why? Because I sat down with them and explained what they heard was wrong. Not misinformation, that’s a trigger word for many, but I explained that it was interpreted wrong. Yes x y and z is in it, but u eat iron magnesium and other metals too. It isn’t like injecting lead paint into ur veins. I simplified explanations for them. I helped them to understand it on their level, not mine or someone else’s but their level. It takes a lot of patience, a lot of work and a few months for some, but eventually everyone comes around. Mind u there are always a few lost causes, a few who will see the few bad side effects on a few people as it is going to happen to them, or why even chance it? My explanation is, u take 15 pills a day, all have horrible possible side effects, but u have none. U need to help people understand one another. Look at what their habits are and what their true fear is and tackle them, together.  

Forcing anyone to do something or divulge their health information, is wrong. We don’t force people to say if they have hepatitis or aids and work at a restaurant, and both are horrid viruses/diseases. Look at the stomach flu that constantly hits restaurants, like chipotle, and that is from them not washing their hands after they use the bathroom. Simplistic acts that people still cannot do. 

U can bring a horse to water but cannot force them to drink it. This is what is wrong today. People just want to force beliefs onto others, or force what they want, rather than educate and enlighten each other. I have hope people will stop this madness, and start treating one another like decent human beings with compassion and kindness. This world needs to heal, and what we are seeing is insanity. Repeating the same behavior over and over and expecting a difference outcome. It’s time we all start to speak up and help each other to heal rather than attack one another for wanting to understand more. 

I have faith it’ll happen just because a few others feel the same way as I do, eventually kindness and compassion spreads.",,,,1635052219,{},hhtufez,False,t3_qe50sj,False,True,t1_hhtns9l,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qe50sj/21_chicago_cops_in_nopay_status_after_refusing_to/hhtufez/,1635205872.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,[],text,t2_3k0dwywc,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Excellent points on history and /u/BenDarDunDat comments are on point here too.  If we want to break down anyone we considered great for their era, we're going to find a ton of flaws.  The Internet Era has made that one abundantly clear so you can only imagine things that happened when people didn't have spotlights cast on them 24/7.  

However, that doesn't mean that flawed people can't do great things even if it's just a moment of perfection in an otherwise body of flaws.  I think a prime example of this we're seeing today is Dr. Fauci, the guy is regarded the world over for his expertise and he's been in a position of that esteem for darn near 40 years.  Because of a lack of understanding how a pandemic works and the evolution of information and recommendations, you see people calling for his head (sometimes literally) and that's just insane to me.  Imagine if your regular doctor misdiagnosed something and you immediately had his license to practice taken away...it's the current climate we exist in.

It's not about Mike the Mechanic. He's a follower and he choses to follow Tucker Carlson. There is nothing which can be done for Mike the Mechanic. He's chosen sides because the people he follows tells him there are sides to be chosen. 

It's about Tucker Carlson. 

Tucker Carlson choses to incite fears in his followers for TV rating points and publicity rather than pulling the country together. He looks like he's trying to fight for leadership of the country, but it's a pseudo-leadership. By that I mean Mr. Carlson doesn't actually engage in debate about the best way to handle a pandemic which is killing US citizens and making tons of people ill, and he doesn't actually have any power to enact any of the change he rants about on his TV program. Rather, he throws rhetorical bombs and sows doubt about the current leadership to create a leaderless vacuum. He questions whether a pandemic is happening at all. He lies directly about vaccines. He lies about the intent of the current leadership. 

All to make money off of people like Mike the Mechanic, to rile him up to make him watch his TV show and sell advertising. He questions the vaccine but has taken the vaccine himself. He'd shower with sanitizer afterwards if he actually had lunch with Mike the Mechanic. He just wants Mike's eyeballs so he can get advertiser's money. It's a business. 

So, I can empathize with Mike the Mechanic. He has been confused by a money grubbing rhetorical bomb thrower who's made Mike into a follower while chasing ad dollars. But the only way to get Mike to take a vaccine to lever the US out of the pandemic is by legal mandate. You won't ""logical argument"" your way into getting a shot into his arm.

Endemic Covid-19 Has Arrived in Portugal. This Is What It Looks Like.

  
Portugal, with one of the world’s highest coronavirus vaccination rates, recently lifted many restrictions in a cautious return to normality  
LISBON—In this soccer-crazed capital of a soccer-obsessed nation, the stadiums are full again. Portugal, a country ravaged earlier in the year by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, now has the highest Covid-19 vaccination rate in Europe and offers a glimpse of a country trying to come to grips with what is increasingly looking like an endemic virus.  
Tens of thousands of screaming soccer fans crammed into the Estadio da Luz here Wednesday to watch hometown favorites Benfica take on Bayern Munich. They amassed on the subway to the stadium, at the entrance as officials patted them down and, after the game, at food trucks where they downed sandwiches and beer as they tried to forget the drubbing their team had just received.  
The government recently lifted a 30% capacity limit at stadiums imposed to control Covid-19. But things haven’t returned to what they were: Fans need a certificate showing they are vaccinated, recently recovered from the disease or tested negative. Masks are obligatory throughout stadiums.  
Close to 100% of people over the age of 50 have received at least one vaccine dose, according to the Portuguese government. For those between the ages of 25 and 49 it is 95% and from 12 to 17 it is 88%. Some 89% of Portugal’s entire population of 10 million has had at least one vaccine dose, not far behind the rate in the world-leading United Arab Emirates, compared with 65% in the U.S. and 73% in the U.K., according to Oxford University’s Our World in Data.  
Portugal has been averaging six deaths a day for the past month, compared with almost 300 at the peak in January. Adjusted for population, the current rate equates to about 200 in the U.S. The deaths plunged to one or two a day in May and June before rising to 20 in July. The number of new daily recorded infections and hospitalizations has been trending down since the summer. The country is now averaging about 750 new cases a day, compared with almost 13,000 in January. There are about 320 people hospitalized, down from almost 6,700 at the peak.  
On Oct. 1, Portugal ditched most of its Covid-containment rules, but in many ways life in Lisbon is a throwback to the deepest days of the pandemic. Hand pumps dispensing disinfectant gel are ubiquitous and some churches still rope off seats to ensure social distancing even though it is no longer obligatory. The Covid-19 certificate is required at large events and masks are still mandatory on public transportation, in schools for students 10 and older, and for employees in shops, restaurants and bars.  
**Portugal dropped most of its coronavirus restrictions on Oct. 1.**  
Masks are still mandatory on Lisbon’s subway and other public transportation.  
At the same time, subways are full. Lisbon’s fleet of rickshaw taxis, known by the Thai term tuk-tuk, whisk tourists along the narrow streets of the city’s old town. Nightlife pulsates in various parts of the city all week, tram lines popular with tourists skip stops because they are bursting with passengers and almost every day finds a new massive cruise ship docked at the harbor.  
Portugal’s cautious return to normality, despite a vaccination rate that is the envy of public-health officials around the world, is being watched as a possible way forward for other countries as their vaccinations inch higher and they contemplate when to ditch their remaining restrictions. The Portuguese approach contrasts with the U.K.’s, where a combination of fewer vaccinated people and almost no restrictions has led to a surge in infections and a rising death rate.

  
Soccer stadiums in Portugal can operate at full capacity, but spectators must show that they are vaccinated, recently recovered from Covid-19 or tested negative.  
“I need tourists, otherwise I have no business, but I look at the infection numbers every day and if it goes up even a little bit I get nervous,” said Paula Marques, who runs a souvenir shop in Lisbon. “I hope the pandemic is a thing of the past here in Portugal, but to be honest I still worry a little bit about what will happen as it gets colder.”  
Portugal got through the first wave of the pandemic in early 2020 relatively unscathed. But a steep rise in cases in November last year and then a savage surge in January shattered the illusion some here had that this small country tucked away in the southwest corner of Europe could escape the worst of the pandemic.  
At the peak in January, an average of about 290 people were dying a day in Portugal from the virus. Adjusted for population, that equates to more than 9,500 in the U.S. The worst daily average over a week in the U.S. never topped 3,500 deaths.  
Maria Mota, executive director of Lisbon’s Institute of Molecular Medicine, has one image indelibly imprinted in her memory from that period that still makes her jittery. Working late one evening at her lab, from her window she counted 52 ambulances lined up outside the emergency room of the country’s largest hospital waiting to drop off patients.  
Portugal is now in a “transitional period” that likely will delineate the pandemic from the new reality of endemic Covid-19, said Dr. Mota. With memories of the trauma of January still fresh in the collective Portuguese memory and with question marks remaining over what will happen as the cold returns and more life resumes indoors, most people are likely to proceed cautiously, she said.  
“Nobody will ever forget this past January, but now Covid is endemic and we need to learn to live with the virus,” said Dr. Mota. “Almost the whole population is vaccinated here and the virus still circulates, showing it won’t go away.”  
As in other countries with a large proportion of the population vaccinated, a stubborn persistence of infections in Portugal hasn’t led to a significant increase in the rate of hospitalizations or deaths.  
“Things are getting better, but it’s slow,” said Miguel Campos, who drives tourists around Lisbon in a tuk-tuk. “We are taking baby steps. We have a mix of optimism and hope that this return to normal will continue.”  
’Things are getting better, but it’s slow,’ said rickshaw taxi driver Miguel Campos, of the Covid-19 situation in Portugal.  
Paula Marques, who owns a souvenir shop in Lisbon, said her business relies on tourism and that she worries infections might rise when the weather gets colder.  
Before the pandemic there were 800 rickshaw taxi drivers in Lisbon, but now only about 200 work during the week and 500 on weekends, said Valentim Gaspar, another rickshaw taxi driver. For now, the balance between drivers and tourists makes it possible to earn a decent living, he said.  
The Portuguese almost universally attribute their vaccination success to Henrique Gouveia e Melo, an ex-submarine commander brought on to run the inoculation drive after a shaky start. He projected confidence and tapped into the population’s generally favorable attitudes to vaccinations, according to public-health experts. The vaccine rollout began in January just as the worst of the pandemic peaked in Portugal, providing a clear incentive for anybody who might have been unsure about getting vaccinated.  
On a soccer-mad continent, Portugal stands out for its dedication to the sport, making the return to full capacity in stadiums all the more symbolic for many people. Spain, which also has one of the highest vaccination rates in Europe, recently returned to full capacity at its stadiums, but food still can’t be sold. Italy this month increased stadium capacity to 75% from 50%. In most of Germany, there are still limits on capacity.  
“It’s time to open everything up because if somebody hasn’t gotten vaccinated at this point, then they aren’t going to get vaccinated,” said Hugo Vale, a 32-year-old engineer, as he drank beer with friends outside the stadium ahead of the Benfica-Bayern game.

[],,Neece235,,,,,,[],"I know it is serious, i said that before. My issue is making anything mandatory on others, they want even medically exempt to get it or be fired! If ur medically exempt ur out of work. That’s a small amount of ppl who are but that isn’t fair. That is my issue. 

Heck i even go so far with some other religious exemptions, like orthodox jewish or Islam, they do not even drink caffeine, and we want to force this into them? Or they lose a job…. I just cannot be okay with that. 

And again, if these r doctors and nurses refusing it who work the front lines, I am not an expert they r, I am not going to try to say I know more than they do! If ur not a medical professional or a scientist, u shouldn’t be telling them what to do. That’s my only issue with the mandates. 

Excluding medically exempt people from being able to work, or religious exemptions that are honest and real, it isn’t right. And again it is there choice to decide this. But if there r that many doctors and nurses who are not getting it, who worked and work front lines still, im not arguing w them or wanting to force it on them.

I swear compassion is lost in this world, someone can know it is real and be extra safe during it and people condemn them still if they can’t have a vax or are waiting to get it. 

And the judgement of others is insane anymore. U assume people are against mandates and that makes them against vaccines or against science. Even when they say they r for both and know how bad it is! Smh I’m so tired of childish remarks or rudeness from others just because my opinion is different then theirs. 

I have literally had horrible side effects from drugs that my doctors have given me, induced autoimmune hepatitis two hospital stays, serotonin syndrome where I lost 3 days of my life zero memory nothing, GBS from a flu vax with more hospital stays and a few more…. so if these ppl want or need more data before continuing then they should have that, the drug companies need to prove all data and never do. 

I have lived thru some horrors from the pharmaceutical companies and I wouldn’t wish it on my enemy. I do not know their life experiences, they could have had some issues too and I am not going to judge them or be rude to them or want them to be hurt.

Because if it's more contagious than Delta, then *ceteris parabus* it would be expected to cause some disruption, since (1) there are a lot of people that Delta has yet to burn through and (2) there will be some cohort who has recovered from original Delta (or been immunized) but has inefficient immune response because this sublineage is just different enough to wild type Delta for the virus to overcome the immune defenses.

Impairments in executive functioning, processing speed, category fluency, memory encoding, and recall were predominant among hospitalized patients. The relative sparing of memory recognition in the context of impaired encoding and recall suggests an executive pattern. This pattern is consistent with early reports describing a dysexecutive syndrome after COVID-194 and has considerable implications for occupational, psychological, and functional outcomes. It is well known that certain populations (eg, older adults) may be particularly susceptible to cognitive impairment after critical illness5; however, in the relatively young cohort in the present study, a substantial proportion exhibited cognitive dysfunction several months after recovering from COVID-19. The findings of this study are generally consistent with those of research on other viruses (eg, influenza).6
Limitations of this study include a potential sampling bias, as some participants may have presented to Mount Sinai Health System because of health concerns.

The COVID-19 pandemic has deeply impacted all aspects of social, professional, and financial life, with concerns and responses being readily published in online social media worldwide. This study employs probabilistic text mining techniques for a large-scale, high-resolution, temporal, and geospatial content analysis of Twitter related discussions. Analysis considered 20,230,833 English language original COVID-19-related tweets with global origin retrieved between January 25, 2020 and April 30, 2020. Fine grain topic analysis identified 91 meaningful topics. Most of the topics showed a temporal evolution with local maxima, underlining the short-lived character of discussions in Twitter. When compared to real-world events, temporal popularity curves showed a good correlation with and quick response to real-world triggers. Geospatial analysis of topics showed that approximately 30% of original English language tweets were contributed by USA-based users, while overall more than 60% of the English language tweets were contributed by users from countries with an official language other than English. High-resolution temporal and geospatial analysis of Twitter content shows potential for political, economic, and social monitoring on a global and national level.",,,,1635087895,{},hhv9tia,True,t3_qetxhy,False,True,t3_qetxhy,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qetxhy/a_highresolution_temporal_and_geospatial_content/hhv9tia/,1635233167.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,[],text,t2_67vr4xq3,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

An evolutionary perspective on this circumstance suggests that natural selection in utero, induced by the onset of the pandemic, caused pregnancies that would otherwise have produced a preterm birth to end early in gestation as spontaneous abortions. We test this possibility using the odds of a live-born twin among male births in Norway as an indicator of the depth of selection in birth cohorts.  
  
Methodology  
We apply Box-Jenkins methods to 50 pre-pandemic months to estimate counterfactuals for the 9 birth cohorts in gestation in March 2020 when the first deaths attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in Norway. We use Alwan and Roberts outlier detection methods to discover any sequence of outlying values in the odds of a live-born twin among male births in exposed birth cohorts.  
  
Results  
We find a downward level shift of 27% in the monthly odds of a twin among male births beginning in May and persisting through the remainder of 2020.  
  
Conclusions  
and Implications: Consistent with evolutionary theory and selection in utero, birth cohorts exposed in utero to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic yielded fewer male twins than expected.  
  
Lay Summary  
Our finding of fewer than expected male twin births during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic provides more evidence that evolution continues to affect the characteristics and health of contemporary populations.",,,,1635087230,{},hhv8d7l,True,t3_qetpi1,False,False,t3_qetpi1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qetpi1/twinning_during_the_pandemic_evidence_of/hhv8d7l/,1635232421.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,[],text,t2_67vr4xq3,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Yeah just looking at the percentage of deaths that were vaxed vs unvaxed loses the context of how many total deaths are happening, which is overall going to be lower when the vax rate is higher, but with the vaxed/unvaxed percentage split increasingly tilting towards the vaxed side even as the absolute number of deaths goes down.

Like, say on average a vaxed person had a 0.005% chance of dying from covid over a given month, and a non-vaxxed person had a 0.02% chance.

At a 50% vax rate, we'd expect, in a country of 9 million people, 4.5mil * 0.00005 = 225 vaxed deaths and 4.5mil * 0.0002 = 900 unvaxed deaths, so total deaths = 900+225=1125, of which 20% were from vaxed people and 80% were from unvaxed people.

At a 90% vax rate, we'd expect vax deaths = (9mil * 0.9)*0.00005 = 405 vaxed deaths, and (9min * 0.1)*0.002 = 180 unvaxed deaths = 585 total deaths, of which 70% were vaxed and 30% were unvaxed.

So at the higher vax rate we have less total deaths, but of the deaths we do have a higher proportion are from the vaccinated population, just because at that point most of the overall population is vaccinated.""

Ireland has vaccinated 90% of adults as already mentioned. Adults will always typically be the ones to die from covid since kids/teens are much lower risk of dying. The covid vaccines won't prevent every single covid death it's not 100% effective no vaccine is but it should significantly reduce the number of covid deaths. The vaccine is simply an added layer of protection. It won't stop you from dying of covid but it should significantly reduce your chances of dying from covid should you still catch covid. Think of it like condoms they don't 100% stop pregnancy but it does significantly reduce the chances of pregnancy",,,,1635087151,{},hhv86xx,False,t3_qege69,False,False,t1_hhuhadf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qege69/antivaxx_groups_claims_about_covid_deaths_among/hhv86xx/,1635232333.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,[],text,t2_75ke43rr,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

""It shows how the median ages of new Covid-19 deaths in each of the six weeks between 8 September and 19 October (roughly the period covered by the vaccination data), were 81, 74, 79, 79, 85 and 76 respectively.""

""Similar data from the Central Statistics Office (CSO), which also publishes information about Covid-19, shows that there were 156 deaths recorded between 11 September and 19 October.
Of these deaths, 136 were among people aged over 65, including 81 people over the age of 80""

And if you look at vaccine status it looks as if amongst the elderly vaccine takeup is even higher and closer to 100%. If you look at Irelands covid [tracker](https://covid19ireland-geohive.hub.arcgis.com/pages/vaccinations) it shows for those 70+ approximately 524,000 of them have been vaccinated. Amongst those 60+ around 1 million of them are vaccinated. Bearing in mind in 2019 there was roughly 696,000 65+ residents in [Ireland ](https://www.statista.com/statistics/710767/irish-population-by-age/). Can't seem to find out how many 65+ vaccinated only those 60+ but the data would suggest almost 100% takeup for those 65+. And from the article around 87% of deaths from 11 September and 19 October were 65+. Given that the 65+ are almost 100% vaccinated it's no surprise then that covid deaths is now amongst the vaccinated since there's literally very very few unvaccinated elderly people left. Covid will always impact the elderly worst since even after vaccination an 80 year old would still be higher risk than a healthy 20 year old. Again vaccines are not 100% effective.

To put some more precise numbers on that, [this CDC data page](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) currently shows
&gt; A total of 45,149,234 COVID-19 cases have been reported as of October 20, 2021.

[This CDC page](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html) gives estimates as of May 2021 of
&gt; CDC estimates that from February 2020–May 2021:
&gt; 
&gt; 1 in 4.2 (95% UI* 3.6 – 4.9) COVID–19 infections were reported.
&gt;
&gt; [...]
&gt;
&gt; These estimates suggest that during this period, there were approximately:
&gt;
&gt; 120.2 Million Estimated Total Infections

Assuming that same rate of 4.2x under-reporting applies through October, 4.2*45,149,234=189,626,782 or ~57% of the population of the United States. (BTW, that CDC estimates page also has a breakdown of the estimate by age range.)

One difficulty in going from that to how many more people Delta can still infect is that we don't know those numbers broken down by vaccination status; vaccines weren't available for most of that time, so there's no particular reason to believe unvaccinated people are all that much more likely to have had COVID-19, so there may still be a lot of unvaccinated people who have gotten lucky so far who could still be infected.",,,,1635100432,{},hhw48pi,False,t3_qemxxg,False,False,t1_hhvxbvt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qemxxg/daily_discussion_thread_october_24_2021/hhw48pi/,1635248391.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,[],text,t2_44dk6lcn,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,NoDisappointment,,,,,,[],"Yeah it's a bit complicated. In tech you're usually given a package that you can expect to be the minimum for the next 4 years. That could be like $150k base salary, $300k worth of stock vesting over 4 years, and a signing bonus of $50k. That leaves your total annual compensation equal to $150k + ($300/4=$75k) + $50k = $275k for the first year and $225k for the next 3 years. Basically that means your market value was evaluated to be $225k per year and offered a $50k to poach you from your current company. So that's the customer treatment from Amazon.

However inside Amazon that role was actually supposed to pay a range of $175k-225k so since they needed to hire you they wine and dined you and offered the highest amount for the level but once you're an employee your next target is probably gonna be closer to that $175k and you're already making more than that for the first 4 years so you're gonna pretty much get no raises despite your real market value (what companies offer to external hires) increasing due to more experience. So once those 4 years are up and you're still not promoted, your pay is gonna go down to $175k. That's the employee treatment.

In a company like Google that's more generous to its employees (although that seems to be changing with its recent remote working policies), you actually get additional stock grants every year that increase your total annual compensation depending on your performance. After 1 year on the job you might get another grant worth $60k vesting over 4 years, and that every year. If Google offered you the same initial terms as Amazon did, your compensation for the first 4 years is actually $275, then $240k (225 + 60/4), then $255k (225 + 2\*60/4) and so on until your initial 4 year grant expires and you're left with $210k without a promotion.

This is a terrible argument. Regardless of whether hunger kills more or less, covid still killed millions to date worldwide and over 700k in the US alone.

Unlike world hunger, it costs nothing on an individual level to get the vaccine (outside of the fraction of a dollar of your personal taxes that already went to funding it), and if everyone eligible did so, covid deaths in the US would drop to nearly 0.

It is okay to admit I do not understand everything in this world, but I want too, so I ask a lot of questions, lol! I did it in school many years ago and I still do it today. If I do not understand what someone is saying I simply ask them to elaborate. But I constantly see people (esp on here) immediately assume they know what a person means but never actually read what they said. We all communicate differently, so trying to say anything that makes sense to everyone equally is impossible! 

Lack of communication &amp; compassion is the downfall of this world, that is why good teachers never get upset when a student asks a lot of questions. They understand that the student wants to learn and is eager to learn but is just seeing it from a different point of view. Having a lack of compassion to those who do not understand something is what is making this world so bitter and hateful. 

I hope more people learn to have these two things soon. Patience might also be needed during this time, as some have absolutely none, and that causes a lack of the two other things I mentioned. So possibly 3 things will be the fall of this world!

""Yeah just looking at the percentage of deaths that were vaxed vs unvaxed loses the context of how many total deaths are happening, which is overall going to be lower when the vax rate is higher, but with the vaxed/unvaxed percentage split increasingly tilting towards the vaxed side even as the absolute number of deaths goes down.

Like, say on average a vaxed person had a 0.005% chance of dying from covid over a given month, and a non-vaxxed person had a 0.02% chance.

At a 50% vax rate, we'd expect, in a country of 9 million people, 4.5mil * 0.00005 = 225 vaxed deaths and 4.5mil * 0.0002 = 900 unvaxed deaths, so total deaths = 900+225=1125, of which 20% were from vaxed people and 80% were from unvaxed people.

At a 90% vax rate, we'd expect vax deaths = (9mil * 0.9)*0.00005 = 405 vaxed deaths, and (9min * 0.1)*0.002 = 180 unvaxed deaths = 585 total deaths, of which 70% were vaxed and 30% were unvaxed.

So at the higher vax rate we have less total deaths, but of the deaths we do have a higher proportion are from the vaccinated population, just because at that point most of the overall population is vaccinated.""

The COVID-19 pandemic has a complex impact on romantic relationships from their  
beginning to their ending. In order to find new potential partners, people use the Internet  
and various communication technologies even more than before. In addition, especially  
among the younger individuals, the reevaluation of current relationships seems to be  
more important than before the pandemic. The quality of the relationship took some hits  
for some couples, while for others it flourished. Various demographic and psychological  
variables account for these differences. Although parents feel some additional burden,  
this might not be felt as problematic. However, those who are trying to legally end their  
marriage are confronted with additional problems. One crucial negative outcome is the  
increase in the rates of intimate partner violence and a solution for this issue is not easily  
approachable. While therapists experienced some difficulties due to social distancing,  
they also use video-chatting or teletherapy to stay in touch with their clients.  
  
Despite the impressive number of studies that were conducted on romantic relationships   
during the pandemic, some shortcomings must be discussed. These studies only  
present a short-term image of the situation. While important, this is not enough to draw  
pertinent conclusions about the impact of the pandemic. Longitudinal studies with multiple   
yearly waves are needed to have a more complete view of how COVID-19 really  
impacted close relationships. In addition, not all of the studies were able to differentiate  
between the different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic (the start of the pandemic, the  
lockdown, etc.) and their distinct impact.",,,,1635086727,{},hhv78t3,True,t3_qethqg,False,True,t3_qethqg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qethqg/covid19_and_romantic_relationships/hhv78t3/,1635231858.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,[],text,t2_67vr4xq3,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

Background  
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (COVID-19) had dramatic effects on the pregnant population worldwide, increasing the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes.  
  
Objective  
To assess the incidence of aSB during the COVID-19 pandemic in Austria.  
  
Methods  
We collected epidemiological data from the Austrian Birth Registry and compared the rate of aSB (i.e., fetal death ≥24+0 gestational weeks) during the pandemic period (March–December 2020) and in the respective pre-pandemic months (2015–2019).  
  
Results  
In total, 65 660 pregnancies were included, of which 171 resulted in aSB at 33.7±4.8 gestational weeks. During the pandemic, the aSB increased from 2.49 to 2.60‰ (p=0.601), opposing a significant decline in preterm deliveries ≤37 gestational weeks from 0.61 to 0.56‰ (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.91, 0.96; p&lt;0.001). During the first lockdown, the aSB rate significantly increased from 2.38 to 3.52‰ (p=0.021), yielding an aOR of 1.57 (95% CI 1.08, 2.27; p=0.018). The event of aSB during the COVID-19 pandemic was strongly related with increased fetal weight, and maternal obesity.  
  
Conclusion  
In Austria, there has been an overall increase in the incidence of aSB during the pandemic with a significant peak during the first lockdown.",,,,1635085955,{},hhv5k17,True,t3_qetbl1,False,True,t3_qetbl1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qetbl1/antepartum_stillbirth_rates_during_the_covid19/hhv5k17/,1635231021.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,[],text,t2_67vr4xq3,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,

This area has a quite high vaccination rate and most software types are pretty onboard, so Adobe is likely to have very, very few people claiming exemptions. I imagine that a significant amount of vaccinated people are going to object to working with unvaccinated colleagues, either due to having vulnerable family members, being vulnerable themselves, or just the principle or not wanting to work with those who are uncaring/selfish. So, whichever companies do NOT be pretty strict with mandates will find their smartest and most team player workers defecting for better companies.

[],,Takatotyme,,,,,,,"I work in the biggest children's hospital in Arizona, in a CVICU, and I can say confidently that I work with some extremely intelligent people. I initially wrote off many of my coworkers who didn't want to get the vaccine as idiots, until I had some conversations with them about why. Many of them were not anti vaccine but were hesitant because they wanted to have children at some point soon but were not confident with the data that was out regarding that. And to be clear, these co workers aren't idiots; they're people who I've seen think critically in life and death situations more times than I can count. And they weren't convinced by the data they were seeing. 

Some of them, the ones who work closely with doctors, changed their stance and got vaccinated after some long talks with them, and I think this is where every corporation is fucking up right now: They're forcing mandating these vaccines without making a good faith effort to understand why people are reluctant. I think a mandate would have been beneficial down the line, but we should have first had these employees sit down in a meeting with an actual physician and allow their concerns to be addressed or answered. 

And before you come at me about ""well there's this paper and that paper and these studies and-"" yes, I get that. There are. And I know how to read them, and what they say. You know how to read them. You and I are both probably really really good at recognizing bad arguments and understanding who qualifies as a credible source in this case. You and I both get that.

But Mike the Mechanic really likes what that Tucker Carlson guy says. Mike the Mechanic is also still dealing with a ton of the claustrophobic trauma that he experienced when his business shut down in March 2020 and he couldn't work for a long time and he saw his savings account slowly diminish to nothing while overeducated public health nerds who's savings accounts were doing just fine got on TV and got on Facebook and finger wagged for months on ends about how Mike the Mechanic should behave and feel. Mike the Mechanic (who went to a trade school, hasn't thought about the scientific method in 30 years and is very ignorant about science) also watched what could very easily be considered flip flopping occur regarding masks and distancing and so many other things by the public health nerds. This was very traumatic for Mike the Mechanic, he was confused and horrified. And these feelings definitely get triggered every time the vaccine mandates are brought up.

Now he's being told ""you have to get the vaccine"" while also being told ""hmm, well looks like myocarditis is possible and also we're not letting Moderna be used for these groups anymore"" and Mike the Mechanic is still confused, angry, and a little scared. Companies having doctors sit down with these employees and answer their concerns would go a long way to alleviating this and would probably be pretty effective.

(2) Defiance. Some people simply don't like being told what to do, even when their lives are at stake. And they really don't like being told what to do by people they don't like--in this case ""liberals"" or scientific experts. They distrust them in all things, and, again, they are willing to bet their lives on it. (3) Misinformation. It is VERY easy to manipulate people's behavior with the right timing and techniques. (4) Stupidity. A good number of people are actually stupid and make spectacularly poor decisions. It's uncomfortable to acknowledge this, but you find it everywhere, and it's a factor here, too.

[],,TicketImportant,,,,,,[],"The government has been telling us this since July. However, there are no restrictions on large gathering. For example, tickets were sold out for the latest Marc Anthony concert which was at full capacity. Hockey games in a stadium that fits 21,000 people are full capacity. 

Today, according to Quebec stats, there are 68 people in the ICU for Covid in Quebec ([link](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/situation-coronavirus-in-quebec)). 68 people out of a population of 8.5 million. 

So, will the restrictions ever stop? By your logic, if you are always keeping restrictions in order to prevent the possibility of an outbreak, then restrictions can theoretically continue forever....
