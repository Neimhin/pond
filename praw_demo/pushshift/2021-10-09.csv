We need level, honest journalism. I won't deny that fact. And they need revenue to accomplish that.

Especially if it ends up being several different subscriptions to different ""papers"". I'll also always have adblock installed. Largely due to the sometimes nefarious and almost always annoying way they implement the ads. Everything from screen jacking, pop ups, auto play videos, cookie tracking,ad injection and so on.

And of course a disease can't spread as easily after the host dies.

However, that doesn't mean a mutation won't be both more contagious and more lethal. It just means that one more contagious and less lethal has a statistical evolutionary advantage over a strain that is more lethal.

Additionally, mutating to have a longer asymptomatic but contagious period grants advantage, which is one of the reasons Covid in general is so easily spread.

The report placed blame on Governor Andrew Cuomo and Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker, while claiming nursing home deaths had been undercounted by as much as 50%.

Senator Tedisco, who filed an amicus brief to the Empire Center for Public Policy‚Äôs lawsuit against the DOH in September, released the following statement on Wednesday:

‚ÄúClearly the best disinfectant is sunlight. Governor Cuomo‚Äôs coronavirus cover-up is crumbling down. Last week, the Attorney General issued a scathing report that begun to lift the Cuomo Administration‚Äôs veil of secrecy that was hiding the real number of nursing home residents who died from COVID-19.

It‚Äôs obvious that the Governor‚Äôs six-month cover-up and refusal to give us these numbers shows he felt they mattered so he could hide any blame. History has shown that the cover-up is often worse than what‚Äôs being covered-up. Sadly, a lack of transparency has been a hallmark of this Administration. I want to thank Justice O‚ÄôConnor for her ruling that demonstrates that this nursing home data is public information and the people have a right to know what their government is doing.‚Äù",,,,1633901994,{},hg5jxwv,True,t3_q5bp4j,False,True,t1_hg5jd5d,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q5bp4j/floridas_covid_positivity_rate_below_5_for_first/hg5jxwv/,1634025729.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2. This new vaccine I'm reading about from Japan scares me because it prevents *all* viruses period from entering the human body and we might want a virus to enter the human body at some point in the distant future for some unknown reason  

It's the same reason you wouldn't want an anti-bacterial treatment that just killed every bacterium in the body. That would ruin your health and make you unable to digest a lot of things. 

I don't think that they've accurately understood what this potential new vaccine actually *is*. But given what they think they're making a point that can be followed. Some gene therapies are delivered by viruses, e.g., and a magical barrier that keeps all viruses out of your body would close those off to you, e.g.

Yes, thats it. Copy pasting my old comment:

The antibodies created by your body after vaccination are for the spike protein. But a real infection would create other antibodies aswell, which you would be tested for. I read this in ~~yesterdays~~ AMA here:

https://old.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/poobgc/im_dr_vincent_racaniello_a_virology_professor_at/hcxzygv/

Serologic tests can detect the presence of these antibodies in serum within days to weeks following acute infection.

The theory was that the weakest variant would prove most contagious and that this one would fare the best because it would be spread while the rabbits went about their business.

Nah, they havent been going deep into vaccine research but deep into conspiracy and false information. Your first step is to do your own due diligence. Credible sources are linked in this sub everywhere, e.g. you can see the automoderators links about vaccine FAQ. About your loved one: Its incredibly hard once someone fell into the conspiracy trap/cult think to get out off again. Its a lenghty process in which you have to avoid to overwhelm the person with facts, they often stonewall you. Their conspiracy think comes from them being unable to differentiate credible sources from aunt karens facebook posts. It comes from an emotional place e.g. fear.

Airborne transmission is a whole different thing and the scientific calculator munitions in general has been very hesitant to label an illness as transmissible through the air ever since germ theory was created and doctors stopped believing that bad air caused illnesses.

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/07/opinion/coronavirus-airborne-transmission.amp.html

&gt;	The scientific wrangling, resistance and controversy that prevented a change in guidance stem from a century of mistaken assumptions whose roots go back to the origins of germ theory of disease in the 19th century.

&gt;	Until germ theory became established in the 19th century, many people believed that deadly diseases like cholera were caused by miasma ‚Äî stinking fumes from organic or rotting material. It wasn‚Äôt easy to persuade people that creatures so small that they could not be seen in a seemingly innocent glass of water could be claiming so many lives.

&gt;	‚Ä¶

&gt;	Along the way to modern public health shaped largely by the fight over germs, a theory of transmission promoted by the influential public health figure Charles Chapin took hold.

&gt;	Dr. Chapin asserted in the early 1900s that respiratory diseases were most likely spread at close range by people touching bodily fluids or ejecting respiratory droplets, and did not allow for the possibility that such close-range infection could occur by inhaling small floating particles others emitted. He was also concerned that belief in airborne transmission, which he associated with miasma theories, would make people feel helpless and drop their guard against contact transmission. This was a mistake that would haunt infection control for the next century and more.

&gt;	In modern medical parlance, respiratory transmission routes are divided between the larger droplets, associated with diseases that spread at close distance, and the smaller aerosols (sometimes also called droplet nuclei), associated with diseases like measles that we know can spread at long distance and are usually highly contagious. Indeed, studies showing that respiratory diseases spread more easily in proximity to infected people seemingly confirmed the role of droplets.

&gt;	It was in this context in early 2020 that the W.H.O. and the C.D.C. asserted that SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted primarily via these heavier, short-range droplets, and provided guidance accordingly.",,,,1633886815,{},hg4izmf,False,t3_q3y2ri,False,True,t1_hfy5hek,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q3y2ri/covid_cases_dip_below_100000_a_day_in_us_as/hg4izmf/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,False,d034f2985469c9fb91ed5c41682105fcca2571f2,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1633894849.0,False,r/Coronavirus,public,,1633886998.0

&gt; Despite the wide availability of Covid-19 vaccines, not all Halloween parades have been safe from virus-related cancellations this year.

&gt; In Westchester County, New York, for example, the Tarrytown Halloween Parade was canceled out of concern, the organizers said, for ‚Äúour most precious attendees, our children,‚Äù many of whom are not yet eligible for vaccines. And in nearby Rockland County, Nyack‚Äôs Halloween parade was canceled, too. The National Zoo also canceled its popular Boo at the Zoo because it didn‚Äôt feel it could keep visitors or animals safe from the virus.

&gt; But Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation‚Äôs top infectious disease doctor, came to the defense of the mask-friendly holiday during a CNN interview on Sunday, saying that outdoor trick-or-treating was perfectly safe.

&gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good time to reflect on why it‚Äôs important to get vaccinated,‚Äù he said, urging those who were eligible for coronavirus shots to get them before Halloween to protect themselves and their children. ‚ÄúBut go out there and enjoy Halloween.‚Äù

&gt; He said that the ability for parents to get vaccinated, combined with the low risk of the virus spreading outdoors, offered some reassurance.

&gt; ‚ÄúThis is a time that children love,‚Äù Dr. Fauci said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very important part of the year for children.‚Äù

&gt; The F.D.A. authorized emergency use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for 12- to 15-year-olds in May. Since then, more than 8.2 million children in that age group have received at least one dose and more than 6.7 million have been fully vaccinated.

&gt; Pfizer and BioNTech asked federal regulators last week to authorize their vaccine for children ages 5 to 11, a move that could help protect more than 28 million people in the United States. Shots are not expected to be available to that group before the beginning of November.

&gt; Coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the United States are currently falling, prompting hope that the wave caused by the Delta variant is ebbing. But Dr. Fauci warned on Sunday that enough people remained unvaccinated to allow the virus to rebound during the colder months.

https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/vaccinated-people-are-less-likely-spread-covid-new-research-finds-n1280583

&gt; **People who are vaccinated against Covid-19 are less likely to spread the virus even if they become infected, a new study finds, adding to a growing body of evidence that vaccines can reduce transmission of the delta variant**.

&gt; British scientists at the University of Oxford examined national records of nearly 150,000 contacts that were traced from roughly 100,000 initial cases. The samples included people who were fully or partially vaccinated with either the Pfizer-BioNTech or the AstraZeneca vaccines, as well as people who were unvaccinated. The researchers then looked at how the vaccines affected the spread of the virus if a person had a breakthrough infection with either the alpha variant or the highly contagious delta variant.

‚Ä¶

&gt; Both vaccines reduced transmission, although they were more effective against the alpha variant compared to the delta variant. **When infected with the delta variant, a given contact was 65 percent less likely to test positive if the person from whom the exposure occurred was fully vaccinated with two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. With AstraZeneca, a given contact was 36 percent less likely to test positive if the person from whom the exposure occurred was fully vaccinated.**

&gt; The risk of transmission from a breakthrough infection was much higher if someone had received just one dose of either vaccine.

‚Ä¶

&gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the highest quality study we have so far on the question of infectiousness of vaccinated people infected with delta,‚Äù said Dr. Aaron Richterman, an infectious disease physician at the University of Pennsylvania, who was not involved in the research.

‚Ä¶

&gt; **It's likely that people who have been vaccinated clear the infectious virus from the body faster**. A previous study from Singapore had found that although levels of the virus were initially the same in those infected with the delta variant regardless of vaccine status, by day seven, levels of the virus dropped quickly in those who were vaccinated, which may reduce the ability to spread illness.

‚Ä¶

&gt; **Vaccines have the ability to prevent transmission of the virus in two ways, he said. The first is by preventing infection altogether. The other is by reducing the amount of infectious virus should somebody get sick**.

&gt; ‚ÄúPeople who have been vaccinated will have immune systems at the ready that can coat the virus in antibodies much more quickly than unvaccinated people who have to build up an immune response,‚Äù Richterman said.",,,,1633891020,{},hg4tabf,False,t3_q4ygyc,False,True,t1_hg3olk9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q4ygyc/delta_has_235_higher_risk_of_icu_admission_than/hg4tabf/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,False,2dbf7cc3509aab3b4f7052e110f776af1b35cef3,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1633894393.0,False,r/Coronavirus,public,,1633891341.0

What you're describing, which is using isolation and quarantine to eradicate the virus, is impossible (as has already been shown many times). 

Even in a hyper localized population, like I don't know, New Zealand, they haven't been able to eradicate it with isolation, for some very simple reasons. 

1. The Delta variant is incredibly contagious and spreads asymptomatically, so its spread isn't visible. 

2. The level of isolation that's needed to combat that kind of spread isn't possible because people require goods, services, supplies in order to live, so there will *always* be some level of travel occurring. Even if you close all businesses and lock people in their houses, *someone* will need to bring them food and supply. That level of infrastructure ratchets up quickly and would be **significant** if it had to service an entire community/city/country. 

3. The virus can live on surfaces, and yes, as stated previously, in animals. ***You can get it from your f#cking cat***. 

So even ***if*** you were able to quarantine humans to a level that stopped spread completely (which you can't, as NZ and Australia are showing), the virus would resurge as soon as quarantine was lifted because it would either make its way back in to the community from an outside source, or ***it would transfer from an animal reservoir back to a human and then begin spreading again***. 

Ignoring the fact that even localized eradication is impossible (seriously, do some actual reading), spread would commence again starting from one of these sources.

Anomalies have been reported by people in south-west England over the past week, with one public health official saying they were aware of a ‚Äúhigh number‚Äù of inconsistent test results, according to reports by the i newspaper.

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), which replaced Public Health England at the start of October, said it did not believe there were problems with any testing kits and added that there was no evidence of a new variant.

Dr Zoe Price‚Äôs daughter Rosie was one of those who developed symptoms earlier this week. She had positive lateral flow test results, but then had two negative PCR tests.

The 14-year-old later spent a day in hospital after becoming dehydrated as a result of the illness.

Price, an A&amp;E doctor from Bath, told the Guardian: ‚ÄúShe became ill on the Tuesday and had a vomiting bug, and I think a few people have started vomiting and being off school.

That isn‚Äôt exactly how this works IRL.


&gt; Some people who get COVID-19 receive no protection from reinfection ‚Äì their natural immunity is nonexistent. A recent study found that 36% of COVID-19 cases didn't result in development of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The people had different levels of illness ‚Äì most had moderate disease, but some were asymptomatic and some experienced severe COVID-19.

‚Ä¶

&gt; Natural immunity can decay within about 90 days. Immunity from COVID-19 vaccines has been shown to last longer. Both Pfizer and Moderna reported strong vaccine protection for at least six months.

&gt; Studies are ongoing to evaluate the full duration of protective immunity, including the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.

&gt; Real-world studies also indicate natural immunity's short life. For example, 65% of people with a lower baseline antibody from infection to begin with completely lost their COVID-19 antibodies by 60 days.

&gt; What about that Israeli study suggesting natural immunity is stronger? Infectious diseases expert James Lawler, MD, MPH, FIDSA, carefully evaluates the study design of the retrospective Maccabi Health System study in his Aug. 31 briefing. In the briefing, he identifies two concerning sources of error that were not corrected for: survivorship bias and selection bias.

‚Ä¶

&gt; Furthermore, there is no country on the globe in which natural infection and natural immunity has brought the pandemic under control. In countries like Iran or Brazil very high levels of natural infection have not prevented recurrent waves of infection.

&gt;But the state‚Äôs survey of agencies providing home health care also showed that at least 34,000 workers appeared to have missed the deadline to get vaccinated under the new state mandate, rendering them unable to work and deepening a labor shortage in the industry.

&gt;Some industry leaders had predicted that as few as 70 percent of workers were likely to be vaccinated before the deadline, and the higher-than-expected rate suggested some workers may have chosen to be immunized to save their jobs.

&gt;Faced with a similar cutoff the previous week, hospital and nursing home staff in New York accepted the shot in greater numbers than home health aides, who typically make just above minimum wage. About 92 percent of hospital and nursing home workers had received at least one shot when their deadline arrived on Sept. 27.

&gt;Though home health workers have largely been out of the spotlight during the pandemic, New York State has at least 250,000 of them, with some estimates rising to over 500,000. The deadline applied to employees of the state‚Äôs 1,500 licensed home health agencies. Another 30 percent of home health aides statewide were hired directly by patients through a Medicaid program and were not subject to the mandate.

&gt;New York had never before released data on what percentage of home health aides have been vaccinated, making it impossible to draw comparisons with the new numbers, which were released Friday.

&gt;The numbers came from a Department of Health survey of all licensed home care agencies, which asked them to report their vaccination levels on Thursday. Agencies representing some 245,000 workers responded. They reported that on average, 86 percent of their employees had been partially vaccinated and that 71 percent had been fully vaccinated.

&gt;The home health care work force in New York has suffered from sharp shortages that have only been intensified by the pandemic, as has been the case in other states. At the same time, demand for home care has risen as people have tried to keep their loved ones out of nursing homes, in part because of the poor conditions in homes that the pandemic exposed.

&gt;Though the loss of workers was not as steep as feared, some industry leaders warned that losing even 5 percent or 10 percent of aides in a field already suffering from a labor shortage could lead to the curtailment or elimination of care for thousands of patients. The losses might also create backlogs of patients at hospitals that typically discharge patients to home care, the leaders said.

&gt;Al Cardillo, president of the Home Care Association of New York State, said the percentages alone did not tell the whole story. Even some agencies with high vaccination rates were losing large numbers of employees that would be hard to replace, he said.

&gt;‚ÄúI just received word from a New York City-area agency that today, to comply, had to remove 175 home health aides from service,‚Äù Mr. Cardillo wrote in an email. ‚ÄúAnd this is from an agency with a 94 percent vaccination rate among aides.

&gt;We‚Äôve known from the beginning that Covid is relatively mild in children compared to adults ‚Äî and especially older adults,‚Äù Shamez Ladhani, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at St. George‚Äôs Hospital in London, told me.  
&gt;  
&gt;The risk is even lower for children under 10, experts told me. Infants under 1 year old might be at higher risk than slightly older children due to their immature immune systems, but the data is way too thin to draw any conclusions for infants.  
&gt;  
&gt;Another way to gauge risk is to compare Covid-19 to other significant causes of death. Covid-19 has killed 280 children under 18 from January through September 2021, the time span in which the alpha and delta variants were active. **Flu and pneumonia, heart disease, drowning, guns, and motor vehicles were all deadlier to children during the same time periods annually from 2015 to 2019 (the latest years with available data).**  
&gt;  
&gt;As one example: The number of children under 18 who died in vehicle crashes from January through September in recent years was nearly six times higher than the number of children who died of Covid-19 from January through September of this year.  
&gt;  
&gt;These numbers can help contextualize risk. ‚ÄúOne of the best ways to communicate risk ‚Äî and for me, personally, to even think about risk ‚Äî is to compare the risk of something I don‚Äôt understand to the risk of something I do,‚Äù Stephen Kissler, an infectious disease researcher at Harvard, told me.",,,,1633881156,{},hg45xxd,True,t3_q5an28,False,False,t3_q5an28,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q5an28/how_the_risk_of_covid19_for_kids_compares_to/hg45xxd/,1634000183.0,12,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is nowhere near accurate. COVID PCR‚Äôs sensitivity ranges depending on where you are in the infection.

&gt;	Accuracy of viral RNA swabs in clinical practice varies depending on the site and quality of sampling. In one study, sensitivity of RT-PCR in 205 patients varied, at 93% for broncho-alveolar lavage, 72% for sputum, 63% for nasal swabs, and only 32% for throat swabs.

Then Biden won the election, the vaccine was announced a few days later, and now democrats were on board since it was no longer a ""Trump vaccine"". Both Biden AND Trump got vaccinated as soon as they were able. 

Trump continued to offer support for the vaccine, with a famous example being one of his ""rallies"" a few months ago. He encouraged the crowd to get vaccinated, at which point they booed him.

It's been in use 60 years, it's dirt cheap to makes, there's dozens of manufacturers the world over. Nobody stood to make a substantial profit off it.

Yet because of the strength of evidence, it became the standard for severe covid. It's still a standard treatment.

There's a lot of legitimate problems, massive conspiracies to suppress cheap treatments not just by pharma companies, but all medical research doctors in the world, isn't an issue with covid. This is how you get idiots overdosing on veterinary formulations of ivermectin.

The very fact this study was published in a prestigious journal so that others can look into it to either confirm or refute the benefit makes your claim false. **This was a clinical trial**. Somebody funded it. The results are in a high impact journal. Assuming no serious flaws are uncovered, more trials will now be done. If they replicate the findings, this, like the other cheap treatments, will become part of the standard recommendations. Because you don't need a new drug approval to administer something like this. It's not a new drug. It's *already* allowed to be given to humans.

When I went back to work the first full week of January, I was still on the nebulizer every 4-8 hours and had abdominal pain from my diaphragm and core muscles working overtime. I get jittery and have trouble sleeping when I use the nebulizer a lot, and it was much worse on the duo-neb. Between the sleep deprivation, a semi-numbing effect from the duo-neb, and brain fog I wasn't aware just how bad the overexertion was my first two days back to work. That Wednesday (January 6th) I was walking up some stairs at work and all my core muscles clenched up on me to the point that I couldn't inhale or exhale. My core relaxed a tiny bit, but anything but the most shallow breath and the gentlest movements threatened to cinch everything up again. I ended up getting an ambulance ride to the ER, where I was put on a muscle relaxant and told to stay the fuck home for the rest kf the week.

Background  
Before 2020, mental disorders were leading causes of the global health-related burden, with depressive and anxiety disorders being leading contributors to this burden. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has created an environment where many determinants of poor mental health are exacerbated. The need for up-to-date information on the mental health impacts of COVID-19 in a way that informs health system responses is imperative. In this study, we aimed to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence and burden of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders globally in 2020.  
Methods  
We conducted a systematic review of data reporting the prevalence of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic and published between Jan 1, 2020, and Jan 29, 2021. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, preprint servers, grey literature sources, and consulted experts. Eligible studies reported prevalence of depressive or anxiety disorders that were representative of the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic and had a pre-pandemic baseline. We used the assembled data in a meta-regression to estimate change in the prevalence of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders between pre-pandemic and mid-pandemic (using periods as defined by each study) via COVID-19 impact indicators (human mobility, daily SARS-CoV-2 infection rate, and daily excess mortality rate). We then used this model to estimate the change from pre-pandemic prevalence (estimated using Disease Modelling Meta-Regression version 2.1 \[known as DisMod-MR 2.1\]) by age, sex, and location. We used final prevalence estimates and disability weights to estimate years lived with disability and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders.  
Findings  
We identified 5683 unique data sources, of which 48 met inclusion criteria (46 studies met criteria for major depressive disorder and 27 for anxiety disorders). Two COVID-19 impact indicators, specifically daily SARS-CoV-2 infection rates and reductions in human mobility, were associated with increased prevalence of major depressive disorder (regression coefficient \[B\] 0¬∑9 \[95% uncertainty interval 0¬∑1 to 1¬∑8; p=0¬∑029\] for human mobility, 18¬∑1 \[7¬∑9 to 28¬∑3; p=0¬∑0005\] for daily SARS-CoV-2 infection) and anxiety disorders (0¬∑9 \[0¬∑1 to 1¬∑7; p=0¬∑022\] and 13¬∑8 \[10¬∑7 to 17¬∑0; p&lt;0¬∑0001\]. Females were affected more by the pandemic than males (B 0¬∑1 \[0¬∑1 to 0¬∑2; p=0¬∑0001\] for major depressive disorder, 0¬∑1 \[0¬∑1 to 0¬∑2; p=0¬∑0001\] for anxiety disorders) and younger age groups were more affected than older age groups (‚àí0¬∑007 \[‚Äì0¬∑009 to ‚àí0¬∑006; p=0¬∑0001\] for major depressive disorder, ‚àí0¬∑003 \[‚Äì0¬∑005 to ‚àí0¬∑002; p=0¬∑0001\] for anxiety disorders). We estimated that the locations hit hardest by the pandemic in 2020, as measured with decreased human mobility and daily SARS-CoV-2 infection rate, had the greatest increases in prevalence of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders. We estimated an additional 53¬∑2 million (44¬∑8 to 62¬∑9) cases of major depressive disorder globally (an increase of 27¬∑6% \[25¬∑1 to 30¬∑3\]) due to the COVID-19 pandemic, such that the total prevalence was 3152¬∑9 cases (2722¬∑5 to 3654¬∑5) per 100‚Äâ000 population. We also estimated an additional 76¬∑2 million (64¬∑3 to 90¬∑6) cases of anxiety disorders globally (an increase of 25¬∑6% \[23¬∑2 to 28¬∑0\]), such that the total prevalence was 4802¬∑4 cases (4108¬∑2 to 5588¬∑6) per 100‚Äâ000 population. Altogether, major depressive disorder caused 49¬∑4 million (33¬∑6 to 68¬∑7) DALYs and anxiety disorders caused 44¬∑5 million (30¬∑2 to 62¬∑5) DALYs globally in 2020.  
Interpretation  
This pandemic has created an increased urgency to strengthen mental health systems in most countries. Mitigation strategies could incorporate ways to promote mental wellbeing and target determinants of poor mental health and interventions to treat those with a mental disorder. Taking no action to address the burden of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders should not be an option.",,,,1633877924,{},hg3yr9t,True,t3_q59m9y,False,False,t3_q59m9y,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q59m9y/global_prevalence_and_burden_of_depressive_and/hg3yr9t/,1633996402.0,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About 98 percent eligible residents there have received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, according to municipal officials.

Most received the vaccine offered by Pfizer, and this week the drug maker said that presented an opportunity: Pfizer announced that it would fully vaccinate everyone in the city over the age of 12 so it can carry out a study of the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine.

The company will work with local health officials, a hospital, a university and Brazil‚Äôs national vaccination program to monitor the transmission of the coronavirus in a ‚Äúreal-life scenario‚Äù after the whole population has been vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech serum, Pfizer said.

The study will follow participants for up to one year to investigate how long vaccine protection lasts against Covid-19 and new virus variants.

‚ÄúHere we believe in science and we lament the almost 600,000 deaths from Covid-19 in Brazil,‚Äù Mayor Beto Lunitti of Toledo said in announcing the Pfizer study.

The study comes after the experimental inoculation of almost every adult in the southeastern Brazilian town of Serrana. That experiment was believed to be the first mass trial of its kind in which an entire town was vaccinated against the coronavirus before the rest of the country.

The experiment in Serrana was conducted over three months in winter and spring. Sinovac‚Äôs Covid-19 vaccine was put to the test in the town of 45,000. It was a resounding success, with steep drops in new cases, hospitalizations and deaths, at a time when the rest of Brazil was in the grip of the pandemic.

Brazil has suffered one of the world‚Äôs highest death tolls from the pandemic. About 600,000 people have died from Covid-19 in Brazil, according to a New York Times database. Though many experts believe the true death toll may be higher, that is the world‚Äôs second-highest death toll. More than 710,000 Americans have died.
