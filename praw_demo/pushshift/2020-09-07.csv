The NYU study you quoted is NOT an RCT, it's a retrospective analysis. The SUNY trial you referenced is also NOT a clinical trial. And, if [this](https://www.albany.edu/sph/news/2020-findings-released-observational-study-hydroxychloroquine-and-azithromycin-patients) is the SUNY trial you are referencing, they specifically say their findings should not be used to guide clinical practice.

In regard to the Ford study, they don't actually say anywhere in that letter that they were going to do an RCT and then didn't due to the political climate. So your statement that hospitals wanted to do RCTs but couldn't is still unfounded. And if they didn't do them, it's because they saw the evidence was mounting that it simply was not worth pursuing further, not because angry libs on reddit scared them away 

In regard to the Zinc study, you realize you can't make conclusions from a study in 2011 about a novel pathogen in 2020? Again, it's enough evidence to support doing further research, not enough evidence to go around saying Zinc is useful in the treatment or prevention of COVID-19.

You really need to re-evaluate how you are coming to clinical conclusions because, at this point, you are making a lot of rookie mistakes.

Unfortunately, COVID stimulus checks are a form of “government assistance.” 

If you’re filing your taxes jointly, the government considers your expenses 100% shared. So if the partner who is a US citizen gets a stimulus check, they can’t say the non-citizen partner didn’t receive any government assistance. So, instead, that couple is ineligible for stimulus money.

Granted, the number and diversity of long trails wouldn't really matter much to someone who has different backcountry hobbies like skiing or climbing.

I went to a Title I high school and we didn't have a pre-calc teacher for half of the year (just had substitutes coming in week after week); and when we did get a teacher, she gave up halfway and we were left without a teacher again. It was a lost year but we all passed anyway to calculus because there was no one there to ""fail"" us. Our school merged pre-calc and trig in one class, so my trig background was very weak. I pushed through and took calculus but the whole thing was very piecemeal. When I got to college, I avoided taking math classes because of how scattered by learning was, and this limited majors I could study and of course my job opportunities. I was always the best in my grade in math up until 10th grade or so (I was always one of those kids that would compete in district-wide math competitions) and would have likely gone into a STEM math-heavy field based off of my interests and natural aptitude, but fuck is it hard to stay on tract when you don't know the basics.

Math is one thing that is key to not fall behind in. Math is all about building blocks. Falling behind in trig will put you back in pre-calc, then calculus, and anything you need after that.

It goes without saying that this was all pre-COVID, so I agree with you that the US is pretty shit with this and having an extra bump in students falling behind doesn't mean much in the greater picture.

So in reality, 260 cases have been officially linked but ""researchers concluded"" that there were actually 266,000.  If you read the method they used to come up with this in the study, it's highly suspect.

I think the most ridiculous thing in the article is this:

This number is laughable horseshit.  The overwhelming majority of people who test positive do nothing but go home and get better on their own, which certainly doesn't cost THE PUBLIC $46,000.  I'd be VERY interested to get into the details of their justification for this but all they say in the study is they based it off ""the statistical cost of a COVID-19 case of $46,000 estimated by Kniesner and Sullivan (2020).""

&gt; Who knows what counties with ""largest relative inflow"" they used for this, but I sure hope they're not talking about counties in South Dakota

They're using anonymized cell phone data to determine where the people who had been at Sturgis went, then categorized counties nationwide by the number of people who went into that county who had been in Sturgis, weighted relative to the population of the county. A total of 749 counties nationwide were categorized as ""high, high-moderate or moderate"" inflow from Sturgis.

They're contending that people picked up the virus at Sturgis and then brought it back to the counties they usually live in and are then looking to see whether there's been an uptick in the number of cases in the counties that a lot of folks from Sturgis went back to.

&gt;There's zero consideration given for whether any observe case increase was due to Sturgis exclusively, or other factors are at play. They just assume it's all Sturgis, which is very stupid considering cases have been going up in the midwest for some time now with not really much of an apparent spike from Sturgis. I have no doubt that it contributed to the deteriorating situation in these areas but to blame the whole thing on Sturgis is just moronic.

I think that's what they're trying to control for with the county-level view; if the cause is Sturgis, you'd expect a bigger uptick in counties (including in the Midwest) where there were a lot of people coming in from Sturgis compared to counties that didn't have that many people coming back from Sturgis. 

&gt;What the fuck is going on in this bolded part? Because it looks to me like they're saying they identified a 10% increase in daily cases in some areas, then applied that 10% to THE SUM OF EVERY COVID CASE EVER in that area? 

The COVID data they're using as the ""pre-rally"" cohort is July 6-August 2, rather than every case prior to the start of the rally.",,1599605846,{},g4hongq,False,t3_iownsr,False,True,t1_g4ha21o,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iownsr/sturgis_motorcycle_rally_was_superspreading_event/g4hongq/,1599609304,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

I have kicked out people of all ages, ethnicity, gender, and  income level for not wearing the mask.  

I'll walk up and say ""Hey, are you finding everything ok? Cool. Cool.   Sorry I know it's a pain, but please keep your mask on, and let us know if you have any questions!""

If I catch them with it down again I grab a new mask still in the little package, bring it to them and say, ""Excuse me, I can't help but notice your mask isn't staying on your nose and mouth, so I brought you this one as yours doesn't seem to function properly."" Which generally shames them pretty thoroughly without leaving an opening for them to accuse me of being rude.  

If I see it again after offering them a mask I go up to them and say, ""Hey, you need to leave right now, we will not be selling you anything. Wearing a mask is not optional, it is a state mandate and I will not risk my work being unsafe and shut down just because of your regrettable actions.  Leave now, but please come back when you can figure out how to deal with a mask for the brief time you're in my store.""  
Usually they interrupt partway through my kick out speech, and usually they're contumelious as they do so which gives me free rein to threaten them withphysical removal from the store and a call to the police because I've declared them as trespassers.  

The whole Labor Day 3 day weekend? Cops were called 7 times by my store, and I lost track of the number of people I had to shame with a nice new mask.  Kicked out 5 of them.  


Wear your fucking masks people.  I don't care if it's effective, if it makes me safer, whatever.  My shop WILL get shut down if it's reported as not compliant with the state mandate, and I like my job.

Back in March/April, most of the folks here was afraid of COVID19 and its progression.

But over time, with the lifting of the lockdown restrictions, we started to be less focused to the virus itself than the economical consequences of the pandemic.

Furthermore if you don't have a relative who suffered from the virus or work in a hospital,  it's harder then to really grasp the danger of what's happening, and see for yourself that this threat ain't just words.

To add to this point, there's also the popular myth that the virus is only dangerous when you have to be hospitalised.
Unfortunately, studies are piling up right now to confirm that even if you didn't develop symptoms, there are serious odds that the COVID19 will have left long term damages to your heart and your brain, if not permanent.

Last but not least, if you think that's bad, stay tuned cause it's gonna get worse.
Not only the seasonal flu will make people less alert on detecting Coronavirus symptoms, but I assure you that the future vaccine campaigns will be an absolute sh*tshow.

My country was already extremely anti vaxx (we were actually the number one, with 1/3 of the population being fearful of vaccines) and since the Coronavirus, everyone I asked said the same thing ""I'm not anti vaxx but I won't take this one, because if it's released next year then it has to be rushed and botched, and I won't be a guinea pig"" dismissing completely the concept of testing phases.

Antibodies fade after some months. That's not a bad thing. Every sign is pointing to durable immunity from COVID-19, as is seen in other coronaviruses.

Obviously not everyone who has had coronavirus has gotten a coronavirus test, especially people with mild cases and people who had it back in the spring. If the true number of cases is 10x or more higher than the confirmed cases that lines up well with an estimate that 30-40% of people in NYC have had COVID-19.

Right now, I guess the reported side effects are fever, chills, headache, and overall, mild stuff. Nothing alarming from what I'm reading (although if it exists, I'm sure someone will point out the 1-in-many case...)

If it was ready today, and my doctor was like ""do you want this?"" and I knew that overall, the chance of developing immunity was less than 50%, and since I'm overweight, I'm probably on the wrong end of that statistic, I'd be like ""yeah, prick me."" I'd know I still have 40+ days to keep strict social distancing and mask wearing (30 between initial and booster, then 10+ days to develop immunity) - so in that timeframe, nothing will change, however afterward, I'll at least be able to go to sleep at night knowing that my chances of developing a bad infection have gone down dramatically, even considering I'm not the ideal healthy patient.

Others will never be convinced that the thing is safe (even though the stage I and II data says it is). Others will have to think about it. Others will need to come face to face with how awful this virus can be. Others will just kind of let it happen if their Physician offers a vaccine during a routine visit.

[],,najumobi,,,[],,,,text,t2_17icui,False,False,[],"  Excerpts from article: 

&gt;Sen. Kamala Harris suggested Saturday that she might refuse a vaccination for Covid-19 because “I would not trust Donald Trump.” My father, 96, feels the same way about Gerald Ford. “No way,” he says when I tell him I hope he gets the new shot as soon as it’s available. “I got the swine flu vaccine in 1976. I was in bed for three days, and my memory hasn’t been the same since.”  
&gt;  
&gt;That fiasco has fueled many anti-vaxxers since. More than 40 million people received a rushed, flawed vaccine against a virus that never emerged, and at least 500 cases of the paralyzing Guillain-Barré syndrome were linked to it, along with thousands of cases of other unreported symptoms like my father’s.  
&gt;  
&gt;This time at least the epidemic—and the need for a vaccine—is real. Of the more than 30 vaccines currently in clinical trials for Covid-19, three are in Phase 3, the final stage before approval, in the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed. Factories are gearing up, and distributions centers have been instructed to be in place by Nov. 1. That’s a good move even if the vaccine isn’t ready to distribute by then. The last thing we need right now is a bureaucratic delay.  
&gt;  
&gt;The leading vaccine candidates—from BioNTech/ [Pfizer](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PFE), Moderna, and Oxford/ [AstraZeneca](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AZN) —have all cleared early safety trials and shown a robust immune response. What remains to be seen is how safe and effective a vaccine will be when 15,000 volunteers receive it in Phase 3, vs. the response of 15,000 who receive a placebo. Anthony Fauci, longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told me in an interview last week that the ultimate decision will be made based on whether a safe vaccine offers actual protection against this coronavirus.  
&gt;  
&gt;According to Dr. Fauci, the Data Safety Monitoring Board could use this information to reach a decision even before the completion of the trials: “If you get a number of events, namely infections, and your trial happens to be focused in an area where you have it and you reach the predetermined number of events, you could get an answer before the trial is officially over.”  
&gt;  
&gt;The FDA could approve it conditionally, using an emergency use authorization. “That’s the reason why you have data and safety monitoring boards. They intermittently look at the data for adverse events . . . and for data that is for efficacy. . . . Is it conceivable that you could get an answer in October? The answer is certainly. I think its unlikely, but I think we can get it.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Once we have a vaccine, the next challenge will be getting people to take it. This will involve considerable community engagement, outreach and transparency on the science, especially given the distrust of vaccines in some segments of society—apparently now including the Democratic presidential ticket.  
&gt;  
&gt;I will try to convince my patients to overcome their fear and help them to recognize that the dangerous virus should be scarier than the vaccine. That’s the only way to beat Covid-19.",,1599552597,{},g4f8vpb,True,t3_iopqfm,False,True,t3_iopqfm,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iopqfm/dad_please_get_a_covid_shot/g4f8vpb/,1599552608,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

may i suggest y'all stop doing that, accept some things you really believe to be true are like your weird religion on the eyes of others, and that you most likely feel like that about someone else's beliefs as well, and let people live in their ignorance as part of accepting who they are even if it means leading a shorter, more difficult and less enjoyable life on their part? sometimes it's affecting you, and sometimes things need to be talked over, but most of the time it's stuff like facebook posts and such. i can't see how pushing someone to the point of conflict because we don't think the same and i believe the other to be wrong can help both of us, it feels more like someone coping with their own helplessness brought by these ideas trying to bully others into commiserating by violently stripping them away their coping mechanisms, even if it isn't that.

There is plenty of good news. But there is also bad news out there too. To just write it off because the cases and deaths aren't as high as they were after the virus had time to spread in stealth without detection or mitigation for months is silly. Especially when deaths went down after that initial peak, went back up, and haven't decreased yet. So its pointless to compare to the peak, its not like we're coming down from that peak. That was months ago. Cases and deaths went down. Then they went up. Now cases are going down, but deaths are lagging behind which is perfectly normal. But as new problems areas arise (22 states are seeing an increase of case numbers), we might see a new wave of cases and deaths from the midwest. 

One thing a lot of people seem to not understand is you can't look at the US just as one country for where its at in the pandemic. Its huge. Its like comparing different countries across Europe. Some areas of the US have been hit harder than others. The ones that haven't still are still at a high risk for a bad outbreak. Especially in the fall/winter as more people are forced indoors.

Some areas like NYC, Florida, Alabama, etc... may have seen the worst of it already, but the midwest and mountains which makes up a lot of the US haven't been hit hard at all yet. They're far from done with this. 

It has nothing to do with who the president is. That's another problem. We have politicized a virus. And a virus doesn't compare about politics. It just does its thing. So we have political issues slowing down the progress on fighting an infectious disease. Its ridiculous, and people who look through that lens are a huge part of the problem. 

I don't align with the majority sub opinion on many things. I do think it tends to skew negative.

One of either two things happened - NYS had a massive number of nursing home deaths but they were in proportion to the overall infection rate and nothing was mishandled. OR NYS's massive number of deaths was largely driven by the nursing home situation and should have been obvious - and the policy of sending people back to nursing homes after diagnoses should have been reversed or never implemented.

There are pretty good arguments for both sides, but Cuomo refuses to allow an investigation that may result in embarrassing disclosures.

Let me guess.  You didn't read the paper or didn't understand the paper.  Fairly common for your piss poor understanding of biology and the very piss poor explanation of T cell immunity that you gave (which was just flat out wrong).  DNA primers were required for reverse transcriptase activity.  We don't have naturally occurring DNA primers for the mRNA-1273 vaccine in our cells.

After one week people realize they should wear masks and start social distancing.

Then in takes two weeks for the cases to start to decrease, two weeks for hospitalizations to go down. Two weeks for ventalator use to be reduced, and two weeks for death rates to go down.

Then one week of decrease death rate and people take off their masks and the cycle starts again.",,1599581463,{},g4gb6h8,False,t3_ioqh33,False,True,t3_ioqh33,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ioqh33/yesterday_us_reported_25325_new_cases_lowest/g4gb6h8/,1599581820,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

The referenced study uses DoT guidance on value per statistical life (VSL) as a starting point, and then puts broad estimate of infections into buckets of patient categories and assigns a certain percentage for each.  But the starting point VSL in 2019 dollars is $11 million for a life, which seems rather high.  Obviously the DoT is a bit conflicted in reporting that figure, since effectively the higher that $ is then the greater 'value' they can claim with safety regulations.

So it is not a measure of healthcare costs, but of holistic value of life impairment.  Just picking on one, they're valuing cost of an asymptomatic case at $11k, which seems preposterous. 

&gt;3.1 Valuing non-fatal cases using fractions of VSL lost We first use the Department of Transportation (2016) guidance on value per statistical life (VSL) and severity/injury estimates as a basis for our non-fatal valuations by category. After updating the figures for earnings and inflation the DOT guidance recommends using a VSL of about $11 million in 2019 dollars. We use the severity classifications in the DOT guidance as a basis for our non-fatal valuations. DOT (2016) recommends using six different severity categories in benefit-cost analyses including Level 1 (minor), which corresponds to using a 0.3 percent amount of the VSL, Level 2 (moderate), which uses about a 5 percent amount, Level 3 (serious), which uses about a 10 percent amount, Level 4 (severe), which uses about a 27 percent amount fraction, Level 5 (critical), which uses about a 59 percent amount, and Level 6 (unsurvivable) which uses a 100 percent amount (the full VSL). 

&gt;We therefore value asymptomatic cases at about $11,000 (in 2019 dollars) each which corresponds to using a 0.1 percent amount of the VSL in DOT (2016).^3 Symptomatic cases with no hospitalizations are assumed to line up in the minor category (about $33,000 each). Hospitalizations not in ICU or on a ventilator are classified in the moderate category ($512,000 each). ICUs without being on a ventilator are classified in the serious category ($1.1 million each). ICUs on a mechanical ventilator are classified in the severe category ($2.9 million each). We view such calculations as providing something approaching an upper bound, although we will argue below that non-fatal Covid-19 losses could be adjusted upward from the DOT categorical losses not only because of the uncertainty we mentioned earlier that happens over the course of possible non-fatal complications but also because of the so-called dread factor, which we elaborate on below",,1599587909,{},g4gnyax,False,t3_iownsr,False,False,t1_g4gflh4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iownsr/sturgis_motorcycle_rally_was_superspreading_event/g4gnyax/,1599589210,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],1599588504.0,,

You're setting up a pretty low bar.

All of the candidate vaccines have been proven to be safe, as proving the safety of vaccines is a lot easier than you're making it out to be.  It's relatively easy to administer a vaccine and monitor recipients for potential negative side effects and manufacturers have had months to run these studies.

Is it possible that a vaccine could have some latent effect that only manifests itself decades down the line?  I mean, yeah, it's theoretically possible, but there's no particular reason to think that's reasonably likely.  And that's no more true of this vaccine than any other.  Other vaccines aren't tested for decades before being administered and fearmongering about these kind of long-term effects is usually reserved for conspiracy theorists/anti-vaxxers.

There is an open question - and ongoing research - about the efficacy of these vaccines.  Do they produce a durable response that is effective in protecting against the virus long-term?  That's harder to test (we can't give people COVID to see if they are immune) and takes time.

But make no mistake, that has nothing to do with the vaccine being safe.",,1599587713,{},g4gnjxm,False,t3_iouw66,False,True,t1_g4gbl29,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iouw66/pfizer_ceo_says_people_who_dont_get_vaccinated/g4gnjxm/,1599588989,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

To expand on the above, the West tends to believe the Chinese government isn't legitimate, because it is not directly elected by the people.

However, in the Chinese system legitimacy emanates from results in a competency-driven system, while results basically don't matter to the West. There is mostly zero accountability, apart from the possibility of not being re-elected after a few years. Doesn't even matter if the leader at that time took deliberate and disastrous action, like blowing up foreign countries at the other end of the globe, destroying multiple generations of people.

This report from FSU only counted cases up to Friday Sept. 4th. Since then, there were a few hundreds of new cases in Leon County among college-aged residents. Florida State University students make up most of the new cases in Leon County in the past few days, so their total infected student body is most likely over 1,000 by now.

[Daily new cases in Leon County among 18-24 year olds](https://i.imgur.com/xy408ZY.png) On Sept 4th, they accounted for roughly 268 out of 952 cases or 28.15% of cases among 18-24 year olds for all of Florida.

[Cases by age groups in Leon in total and on 9/4](https://i.imgur.com/LAqIf4N.png) For some perspective on this, there were 1,009 total new cases on 9/4 for the age group of 15-24 in all of Florida.

Copper has properties where extra parts of the material (electrons or something) will grab onto parts of the virus and break it apart. There are concerns with too much copper in the body since your skin can absorb it, but they say your body won't get too high of a dose unless you're surrounded by it nonstop. They can usually trace some sicknesses and deaths in hospitals to a transfer within the hospital itself, so some hospitals are replacing all door handles, sink faucets, toilet handles with copper ones to reduce spread of viruses (not just covid19) at the cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars per hospital. But at least one hospital in the US has already started doing it.

And then the vitamin d stuff is similar to other stuff you've seen on this subreddit. Homeless shelters were bracing for a bad covid outbreak. They kept finding zero positive cases on people they tested. They were confused, this was happening at all homeless shelters across the US. They finally tested every person in the shelter at once and noticed 40% of the people were actually positive. They related this to higher amounts of vitamin D. Additionally, a lot of healthcare workers who are more likely to have vitamin d deficiencies were dying at the start of covid-19. They pushed to have people take vitamin D. The deaths of those healthcare workers were greatly reduced. At the time there were no official studies completed, but they said keep an eye out for some soon (and we've been seeing those reports on this subreddit recently).",,1599582933,{},g4ge1a0,False,t3_io3l5a,False,True,t1_g4bzmyt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/io3l5a/radiolab_invisible_allies_how_sun_and_copper_can/g4ge1a0/,1599583583,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

I'd not believe it months ago, but one gets used to this I guess. Luckily none of my friends or family have died (some of my mates however have lost loved ones...), the closest was my uncle who got very ill but is ok now. So far it's mostly hearing of anecdotes of people I don't know. Like a few days ago, a friend told me the shopkeeper of his street got infected and died. Stories like these every week (the worst I've heard is of a family were all were infected and 3 died). Then around once a month someone from my inner circle loses someone, so I mourn for them.

One phenomenon that still puzzles me is the appearance of many seemingly unrelated deaths. Every 2 weeks or so a friend posts about a dead family member, without any specifics (no mention of coronavirus), in Facebook. A family friend's brother also died in his sleep some time ago, pneumonia apparently, and he was still in his 50s. I still don't know if it's that frequent that family members die and people are just posting them more, or deaths have really increased. Usually I mourn 0, 1 or 2 times a year, but now I'm flooded with them. Maybe some of the mysterious deaths have to do with the virus, and in that sense, it's reasonable that the excess death count is much higher than the official number.

Edit: I wanted to add, it's surprising how adaptable a person can be. If I was reading this months ago I'd think I should be scared shitless and depressed. But the virus is invisible and if it doesn't touch you, you almost feel as usual. I've become desensitized after hearing so many stories of the dead.

Why these specific drugs? I could name a hundred more cheap drugs with just as much evidence as each one of these. Plausible mechanisms are everywhere in viral pharmacology.

You are saying this like docs don't already know. The threshold for intubation was high early on because these patients were really hypoxic.

I agree with you about the elite rule in China.
The truth is that what Trump lacks most is ""political accountability"", that is, the American people elected him to office to be accountable to the American people, and now he is either incapable or completely unwilling to assume that ""political accountability.""
Eastern ""elite rule"" is based on the premise that the elite is accountable to the people, and if the people decide that the ""elite"" has betrayed the people, then the ""elite"" may be removed from power (mostly by force) by the people.
In the Western model of democracy, the ""ouster"" is very civilized, but the process of electing an ""elite representing the masses"" is quite uncivilized. Similarly, if the elected ""elite"" is not accountable to the people, the people can only remove it from power at the next election.

It is amazing that such a leader with no ""political responsibility"" can be considered by 40% of the people as ""the elite representative of the people"".
It's amazing....

The majority of new cases being reported are in 20-40 yo. The majority don't go to the hospital and they typically haven't died. 96.8% of deaths in Canada have occurred in people 60+. The entire goal was to flatten the curve and don't overwhelm hospitals. We were asked to flatten the curve, and in BC, we've done it, twice. At the height of the pandemic, there were approx. 146 people in hospital, in the entire province. With case numbers rising exponentially, we're at 31 people in hospital. 

A great website, [here](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/epidemiological-summary-covid-19-cases.html), that is current to date shows that deaths in 0-49 yo, in Canada, don't even add up to 1% (0.9%). Our PHO, Dr. Henry, says we should expect to see COVID cases in school. Much like we can't control the flu, even with a vaccine, we can't control the coronavirus, but we can manage it.

This raises the possibility that the local population may be at risk for COVID-19 spread, especially if mitigating strategies (i.e., mask-wearing, interacting closely with only household members, avoiding crowds) were not undertaken.

Second,  using  data  from  the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a synthetic control approach, we show that  by  September  2,  a  month  following  the  onset  of  the  Rally,  COVID-19  cases  increased  by  approximately  6  to  7  cases  per  1,000  population  in  its  home  county  of  Meade.

During that first week, it's hard to tell which cases will turn serious just based on symptomology and severity **alone**. They usually start to feel a little better around day 7, but it's during that second week that we see the rapid decompensation and complications set in. She died at week 3, so this is not an atypical course of illness that results in death.

Restaurants fail at a crazy percentage, so I don’t know what you mean by “face no economic challenges”

Typically they fail due to poor management, location, or poor menu selections. Employee turnover is a frequent issue.

Folks who work in restaurants think they can run one efficiently, without having the business sense for it. Folks who open them as is investments have no idea how to run one/desire to operate it themselves, and ya even to pay most potential profit for a decent manager to hold the ship together.

Eventually the loans on equipment, and rent, come due, and they can’t handle monthly fluctuations in business. 

Best chance for success is to pay for the land/building/equipment up front, and scale payroll with business, reassessing on a weekly or monthly basis. 

Really works best for previously experienced owner-operators, but then again most people with 500k-1m realize there are more short term, passive, profitable investments. 

Short term, say first few years, it’s like buying a full time (and then some) job for yourself. Long term, if they manage to survive, it can be fairly lucrative if the owner runs it themselves.

Unfortunately it’s one of those businesses where frequently, there’s not enough profit % for the investor and to keep the management in place. It’s a physical job with long hours, and good management gets poached or gets fed up with the struggle.

""There is a risk to life associated with not getting police reform, which is why there are protests.""

There's also a risk to life associated with spreading a virus during a pandemic, not to mention the 30+ people who've been murdered in the riots/protests of which only 93% were peaceful, an embarrassing number many people don't seem to realize. Here's a fact, there were only \~20 unarmed black men killed by police in 2019. Of them the majority were attacking officers at the time. Here's another fact, you can't predict the race of an officer based on the race of the victim: [https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15877](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15877), meaning black officers are just as likely to shoot black people according to the known data. There was one objection that the proportional frequency of encounters may be different but that's not supported by any known nationwide data and the facts of the linked study remain. In any case I guarantee the number of lives lost due to COVID19 spread from the 20 million+ people who attended is higher than both those lost from Sturgis, by multiple times, and from unambiguous Breonna Taylor type cases.

UV C light is effective against many strains of the HPV virus and many RNA viruses.

PLasma is just fucking hot and if not contained in a magnetic field it could start a fire easily.

Silver punches a whole in the membrane / capsid and this leads to apoptosis of infected cells.. or fucked up osmosis explosions /implosions. They also bind to DNA/RNA and stop replication in its tracks.

Imagine a field surrounded by houses that gets cleaned every day.  On a given day if you find 1 dog turd you'd expect a small dog population, maybe only one.  If you find 10 dog turds, you might expect 5-10 dogs live in the area.  If you find hundreds of turds you might expect most people in those houses have dogs.  If the field is nothing but poop as far as the eye can see, you might expect there to be thousands of dogs.

BLM protesters are almost entirely outside all of the time for their protests. Sturgis attendees frequented a lot of bars and restaurants together. 

BLM protesters generally wear masks (for various reasons. . .). Many Sturgis attendees were against mask use. 

BLM protesters are typically protesting in their home cities, and being believers in the dangers of Covid they were more likely to stay home if feeling under the weather. People attending Sturgis would have traveled across the country to get there and would often be very reluctant to wuss out and not attend just because they’ve got a bit of a cough and can’t properly smell anything.

First, a minor squabble is this is for a sponsor petitioning for someone (e.g. a spouse, parent, or sibling) for US *residency*, commonly known as Green Card, NOT citizenship. Applying for US Citizenship, i.e. naturalization is usually done by the beneficiary him/herself and there are no requirements of financial support.

Second, more importantly, the sponsor (US Citizen) signs an I-864 affidavit of support. It does NOT mean ""the spouse is not allowed to be on any sort of government assistance..."" or as you say, ""barred from government assistance."" What the I-864 affidavit means is the sponsor is on the hook for whatever benefits the beneficiary receives. For example, the beneficiary applies for welfare, and the government will not hesitate to grant say $10k to the beneficiary. What the affidavit means is the government will then sue the sponsor (US Citizen) for the $10k. It also means the beneficiary him/herself can sue the sponsor for up to 125% of the federal poverty line (almost $16K in 2020). 

Third, the length is NOT 10 years. It is until the beneficiary paid 40 quarter credits of social security. If the beneficiary doesn't work at all or is severely underpaid, common in retiree parents, then the sponsor is on the hook FOREVER.

Fourth, VAWA is a ""shortcut"" to residency for abused beneficiaries. If a foreigner reports domestic abuse, he or she is eligible for, but not guaranteed, a green card. 

So, this is the opposite of yikes. From an immigration legal standpoint, the ball is completely in the beneficiary's court.

Nothing wrong with showering and washing clothes! But I think in terms of COVID risks, the most important things to keep clean when you get home (or even before that) are your hands, face and anything that goes near your mouth/nose (such as a mask).

What you should be wary of is less surfaces and what people touched, but the people themselves! Talking/eating around people definitely increases transmission risks, because that's when everyone involved cranks open their respiratory orifices to spew and receive. The risks are much lower outdoors.

They know that a happy population is way more trusting and willing to cooperate if/when the time comes for harder measures.

Masks were initially good in France, Spain and Italy, but people grew complacent with the success and they thought they were out of the woods and that the masks were the reason why. Social distancing went out the door because masks were all they needed. Then BOOM. Second wave.

The fact that it posts things to twitter and its website so its intended audience can get info easier doesn't mean it's the agency's job to disseminate information to the general public.

&amp;#x200B;

Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. ***A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.***

&amp;#x200B;

#### Community-acquired pneumonia

Community-acquired pneumonia is the most common type of pneumonia. It occurs outside of hospitals or other health care facilities. It may be caused by:

* **Bacteria.** The most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in the U.S. is Streptococcus pneumoniae. This type of pneumonia can occur on its own or after you've had a cold or the flu. It may affect one part (lobe) of the lung, a condition called lobar pneumonia.
* **Bacteria-like organisms.** Mycoplasma pneumoniae also can cause pneumonia. It typically produces milder symptoms than do other types of pneumonia. Walking pneumonia is an informal name given to this type of pneumonia, which typically isn't severe enough to require bed rest.
* **Fungi.** This type of pneumonia is most common in people with chronic health problems or weakened immune systems, and in people who have inhaled large doses of the organisms. The fungi that cause it can be found in soil or bird droppings and vary depending upon geographic location.
* **Viruses, including** **COVID-19.** Some of the viruses that cause colds and the flu can cause pneumonia. Viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in children younger than 5 years. Viral pneumonia is usually mild. But in some cases it can become very serious. Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) may cause pneumonia, which can become severe.",,1599579206,{},g4g6tk3,False,t3_iouw66,False,True,t1_g4g3bd0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iouw66/pfizer_ceo_says_people_who_dont_get_vaccinated/g4g6tk3/,1599579392,1,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

That said, there's no solid news to say: ""well, turns out the Moderna mRNA platform caused these horrible side effects in some patients."" 

Adenovirus vector, conventional immune response in t-cells, no major bad side effects. None of this was unexpected for what the Oxford vaccine tries to be. It's more conventional news rather than ""good news"". It's been ""not bad news"" so far.

But the real questions - whether the immune response caused by the vaccination can properly fight SARS2, if so whether the effectiveness is enough to make a difference epidemologically, and finally, whether this avoid somewhat predicted (because there's a small amount of evidence for it) ADE, which would make getting the virus worse if you've been vaccinated - none of these are answered.

There are things about the immunology related to SARS2 that medical science doesn't even understand yet, which are pertinent to whether a vaccine would even work.

In this sense, the Oxford phase III data will be among the first data sets to actually answer some of these broader immunology questions.

But, as many say, plenty of common coronaviruses have never had a vaccine successfully developed for them (maybe none at all?). ADE, hiding from the immune system, there are plenty of viruses that do many weird and different things. 

I genuinely don't want to be negative, but my thoughts when I hear about all this vaccine optimism is just that there's very little evidence yet to be optimistic. This phase III data will be among the very first sets of evidence to provide a basis for optimism. Which could happen, and would be great. But there's a huge chance that there will be very disappointing news, and I think people are way too mentally away from that. That is, a little realism now followed by grateful relief later is much better than undue optimism now than horrible disappointment. For mental health I mean.

Because, just because there are pessimistic people out there isn't affecting the results of these trials so this battle for optimism... well, if we get the bad news, I really worry about some people",,1599575082,{},g4fz4a0,False,t3_ioskea,False,True,t1_g4ft984,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ioskea/oxford_scientists_these_are_final_steps_were/g4fz4a0/,1599575093,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

## Abstract

**Objectives:** The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) conveys a serious threat globally to health and economy because of a lack of vaccines and specific treatments. A common factor for conditions that predispose for serious progress is a low-grade inflammation, e.g., as seen in metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and heart failure, to which micronutrient deficiencies may contribute. The aim of the present article was to explore the usefulness of early micronutrient intervention, with focus on zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, to relieve escalation of COVID-19.

**Methods:** We conducted an online search for articles published in the period 2010-2020 on zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, and corona and related virus infections.

**Results:** There were a few studies providing direct evidence on associations between zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, and COVID-19. Adequate supply of zinc, selenium, and vitamin D is essential for resistance to other viral infections, immune function, and reduced inflammation. Hence, it is suggested that nutrition intervention securing an adequate status might protect against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - coronavirus-2) and mitigate the course of COVID-19.

**Conclusion:** We recommended initiation of adequate supplementation in high-risk areas and/or soon after the time of suspected infection with SARS-CoV-2. Subjects in high-risk groups should have high priority as regards this nutritive adjuvant therapy, which should be started prior to administration of specific and supportive medical measures.

**The proportion of infected and dead among the elderly differs significantly depending on which medical company is responsible for the medical treatment, DN's review shows.**

In March, 14,700 people lived in nursing homes in the county. In July, 7 percent had died with covid-19. One in five had been infected, figures from the Stockholm Region show.

In the Stockholm Region, the two companies Familjeläkarna i Saltsjöbaden AB and Capio Legevisitten are responsible for the medical interventions for a total of 90 percent of the elderly who are listed on special housing. Figures from the Stockholm Region that DN has read show that the difference between the two companies is significant, both in terms of the proportion of infected and dead.

( figure from article - [https://api.quickshot-widgets.net/uploads/Smittade\_WEBB2-1599570893373-1599579426385.png](https://api.quickshot-widgets.net/uploads/Smittade_WEBB2-1599570893373-1599579426385.png) )

**At Familjeläkarna** , 24 percent who have been listed have been infected with the disease, and 9 percent have died. At Capio Legevisitten, 16 percent have been infected and 5 percent died with covid-19.

\- We can see that in the homes where we are responsible for doctor visits, the spread of infection has been smaller compared to others, says Capio Sweden's chief physician Margareta Danelius to DN.

She addresses what she considers to be important factors in limiting the spread of infection in the homes: early ban on visits, only ""unavoidable"" physical doctor visits, high continuity with good knowledge of patients, good cooperation with the residents and medically responsible nurse about latest knowledge about the virus and updating routines.

**Since May, DN has** sought Familjeläkarna for an interview. The company replies in an email that the figures are misleading, as the family doctors in addition to 6,548 listed on special accommodation have also been responsible for 2,571 short-term accommodation during the pandemic.

The company writes that a large part of the patients had covid-19 when they moved into the nursing home, and that they unfortunately died there.

According to the region, however, the figures are comparable, as all care providers report the figures in the same way.

**Christoffer Bernsköld** , unit manager at the health and medical care administration, describes that it was in order to get a grip on the workload that the region asked the care providers about figures on the number of infected and dead respectively. But according to Bernsköld, the companies have stated that they have handled the situation well.

He has a hard time believing that the difference is due to different ways of working.

\- It probably has more to do with whether the infection entered the homes they were responsible for. The conditions for the different accommodations differ and my picture is that the variation is very large in several areas. They are different in size and have different conditions in terms of how they organized their work, he says, and refers to Ivo's ongoing review of nursing homes throughout the country.

**Bernsköld links** the high death rates in covid-19 in nursing homes to the large spread of infection in society, where Stockholm was hardest hit.

\- This meant that many were unfortunately infected and the residents are a clear risk group, which means that many have died as a result.

[DN's review has shown](https://www.dn.se/sthlm/lakarbesoken-minskade-till-aldreboenden-under-pandemin/) that the physical doctor visits to nursing homes in the Stockholm Region decreased by 24 percent during the pandemic, and that a third of the visits were made at a distance.

**What does it matter if the doctors are present when you have an infection there?**

\- I think that what matters most is if you have had continuity, and by switching to distance contact, you could have better continuity with the doctors. In itself, I do not think that whether you have had distance contact or been on site has had any significance. The doctors must make an individual assessment in each case, says Christoffer Bernsköld.

The region does not know what type of consultation the medical organizations do at a distance, according to Bernsköld.

**The question was asked** by a group of doctors in a debate article in [Läkartidningen in July. ](https://lakartidningen.se/opinion/debatt/2020/07/det-medicinska-innehallet-i-sabo-maste-forbattras/)Among others, Bengt Winblad, professor of geriatrics, says that the high death rates cannot be explained solely by the infection in society.

\- It is striking that you have such excess mortality in Stockholm - 7 percent is a high figure compared to 2.8 percent if you look at the whole of Sweden.

**He does not believe** that covid patients can be assessed at a distance, and is upset that palliative care has been prescribed over the phone.

\- Medical ethics is about more than just prescribing drugs. Here they have not even visited the patients, and in that way they can not give prescriptions for palliative care with, for example, morphine treatment.

In the article, the authors emphasize that the medical content of special housing must be improved. This is especially true of Stockholm, according to Winblad.",,1599602759,{},g4hilpa,True,t3_ip37r1,False,True,t3_ip37r1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ip37r1/sweden_7_percent_of_the_residents_in_stockholms/g4hilpa/,1599606219,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

You'd have to be a maniac or have blind faith in all institutions in the world to answer A.  Surely you'd like to understand more about it than that it is a vaccine and that you could get it.

B is a very rational answer.  Consider it, do your research, and then make the call.  If the research is solid and the vaccine is actually safe and effective, most Bs will get the vaccine.

The only people we really have to worry about are the Cs.  But many of them will face a vaccine requirement as a condition of employment, school attendance, or travel, and will decide that their principles aren't nearly as important as their paycheck/degree/vacation.

I really don't think this is much to worry about.  90%+ vaccination rates are very possible.

We’ve done good on the social distancing, but of course you cant avoid people doing stupid things, so we have to deal with a bit of that.

The methodology used to arrive at the $46k number is extremely dubious, randomly deciding to start with the value of statistical life (VSL) used by the Department of Transportation and then making a whole bunch of unfounded assumptions and generalizations from there.  

And the methodology used to arrive at the 266,000 case number is even worse, are you fucking kidding me? 

&gt;We are further able to document national spread due to the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, although that spread also appears to have been successfully mitigated by states with strict infection mitigation policies. In counties with the largest relative inflow to the event, **the per 1,000 case rate increased by 10.7 percent after 24 days following the onset of Sturgis Pre-Rally Events. Multiplying the percent case increases for the high, moderate-high and moderate inflow counties by each county’s respective pre-rally cumulative COVID-19 cases and aggregating**, yields a total of 263,708 additional cases in these locations due to the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. Adding the number of new cases due to the Rally in South Dakota estimated by synthetic control (3.6 per 1,000 population, scaled by the South Dakota population of approximately 858,000) brings the total number of cases to 266,796 or 19 percent of 1.4 million new cases of COVID-19 in the United States between August 2nd 2020 and September 2nd 2020.

This is absurd.  Who knows what counties with ""largest relative inflow"" they used for this, but I sure hope they're not talking about counties in South Dakota, because increasing case rates in South Dakota by 10% is not going to get you anywhere near 266,000.  The whole state only has a few hundred cases a day, and that's during their current surge in cases.  But ok, they didn't say which counties, so let's look at some other huge problems with this:

* There's zero consideration given for whether any observe case increase was due to Sturgis exclusively, or other factors are at play.  They just assume it's all Sturgis, which is very stupid considering cases have been going up in the midwest for some time now with not really much of an apparent spike from Sturgis.  I have no doubt that it contributed to the deteriorating situation in these areas but to blame the whole thing on Sturgis is just moronic.  

* What the fuck is going on in this bolded part?  Because it looks to me like they're saying they identified a 10% increase in daily cases in some areas, then applied that 10% to THE SUM OF EVERY COVID CASE EVER in that area?  What the FUCK?  That's literally not how math works and it's not how infectious disease works.  

They took a bullshit number and multiplied it by an even more bullshit number to arrive at a big scary bullshit number.

It's absolutely pathetic that this article is at the top of this sub.  I hate these Sturgis idiots as much as the next guy.  Holding that event this year was reckless, dumb, and narcissistic.

I noticed that too. 

I just had a baby in May. 

Around Feb-March I was reading daily. Keeping informed. Strict protocols were in place in my home to avoid contamination. No outside food. Quarantined Amazon packages for a few days, etc. 

Eventually, it was wearing on my spouse. Had to relax it a little bit. 

Then came the birth. I think we were both scared of going to the hospital for a stay. 

But we did, and it was fine. Neither mommy or daddy or baby got Covid while there. 

We never got called to be contact traced so I assume no one else in the ward had it while we were there either. 

I still wear a mask when I go out in public stores but everyone else seems to be over it. I always hated the ""mask truthers"" and ""It's just the flu bro"" idiots because there is no denying we were dealing with a pandemic new illness. 

However, I'm starting to think it was WAY over hyped. This is just from personal experience. If it was as contagious and deadly as they say it was everyone in my town would be dead. It would just be a fucking ghost town with me and maybe the 100 other people who wore masks and played it by the book in the early stages left. 

But around the beginning of June our health centers closed down their drive up testing for ""lack of demand"". That was a big wake up for me. Then my friend who is in absolute shit tier deplorable health (obese, cigarette smoker, pot smoker, practical recluse with zero physical activity, shit nothing but fast food diet) came down with it and toughed it out in a few days. Didn't even go to the doctor just called and he said just rest at home. 

I mean in my town, we never really did anything right. People were still out to eat every day. Still going to bars, etc. But I don't know anyone who had to go to the ICU for it. Everyone I know just toughed it out - aside from my Uncle who needed to go in for a bit of oxygen. He's 70 and has cancer.... he pulled through it. 

I think doomsday is officially cancelled. I'm still being cautious because of the newborn, but I don't think it's like they said it is. Interesting that schools seem to have such a huge problem with it now, but i've heard the testing is absolute shit show with false negatives/positives so who knows what's really up.",,1599539833,{},g4ev7xd,False,t3_io7swh,False,True,t1_g4djdqw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/io7swh/daily_discussion_post_september_07_questions/g4ev7xd/,1599539844,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

2) cool goods that I'm not planning on using immediately (yogurt, frozen veggies, etc).  They get put in a clean bag (to prevent cross-contaminating other items) and stored in the fridge or freezer as appropriate.  After a few days, I take them out of the bag so they're more visible.  This is maybe 20% of what I buy.

3) cool things that I am planning on using soon-ish (bread, fresh broccoli, etc).  I wipe down the outer packaging with cleaner (the bread) or make sure I cook it thoroughly (the broccoli).  This is a small percentage of what I get, maybe 5%.

4) cool stuff that gets eaten soon after purchase and doesn't get cooked (sliced veggies in dip).

&gt; I wash my hands before and after handling food or groceries, rinse produce like usual, and am conscious about touching my face between hand washings. Definitely don't bother with quarantining food or washing things with soap or disinfectants.

Let me maybe try to explain a bit of it:

SARS-CoV-2 gains entry via the respiratory system: It has to go up your nose or maybe into your lungs. It does the virus no good if you eat it! It'll get deactivated for good by your stomach acid before it hits the kinds of cells it can infect.

Unless you plan on sniffing your groceries, you won't get COVID-19 directly from them.

But there's the indirect route: If your hands get contaminated with sufficient SARS-CoV-2, and you bring enough of it onto your face. This is why she washes her hands before touching her face.

That is just good hygiene in general.

But even that may not be necessary to prevent COVID-19: Every well documented case of COVID-19 has been transmitted by the carrier and the patient being in the same place at the same time. It seems that you need a live carrier there, constantly pumping out clouds of viruses, to get the critical mass needed to start a new infection.

With COVID-19, the danger is being with other people, unmasked, in an indoor environment with limited outside air for an extended amount of time. You should mainly focus on avoiding/mitigating those situations! Luckily, it nearly always takes the complete set of listed circumstances for transmission, so it's easy to defuse: You can avoid the indoors or avoid people or have everyone wear masks or open a few windows or avoid spending too much time and you'll be much safer.",,1599542830,{},g4eyvj5,False,t3_ioju5o,False,True,t1_g4ery8v,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ioju5o/it_is_highly_unlikely_that_food_is_a_source_of/g4eyvj5/,1599542840,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

He first thought that this was a bad joke, he told the news program ""Zeit im Bild"" on Monday evening.

Many people are already recommending that they be taken. For some gov entity to make a rec like that there's a lot of red tape. Plus there are the EXTREME outliers who might have a health effect from it, so they can't blanket recommend it for everyone.

I have found fish oil to actively increase my mental stability and overall happiness. First of all, I used to believe that was all bullshit.

A friend of mine was visiting the grocery store when i was on the phone with him and said he was picking up some vitamin c and fish oil. i said what's fish oil for. He said it's for depression and mental stability. I said more like snake oil. But I ordered a bottle and started taking it because, what's the harm.

I took 600mg daily through this pandemic, maybe starting mid May? Used regularly and then I ran out in late July. A few days later in the evenings after a few beers I would start to feel the distress. My dreams would be riddled with nightmares about this whole covid thing. Panic and anxiety.

A couple days later I thought, maybe the fish oil did have an effect, and ordered another bottle. When it arrived I started taking it and within 2 days the evening anxiety disappeared, the nightmares disappeared, and I was ""fine"". As a scientist by profession, this got me curious. After a week on it I started to slow my doses, wondering if it was a sudden drop-off, similiar to withdraw symptoms, that I was experiencing. One of the most consistent aftereffect for me for LSD is an extreme case of depression, lasting 12-24 hours after I've stopped feeling the effects of the drugs.

However, and sure enough, the symptoms started coming back gradually. I re-upped my doses and they disappeared. I started to gradually reduce the dosage over 4 days and have been off it for a week to see if the anxiety and nightmares disappear or lessen over time. If it doesn't go away or lessen in the next week I'll restart at 300mg daily dosage to measure the effect.

I am a white male in early 30's happily married with 2 children, financially secure and largely unaffected by covid other than working from home and wearing mask/gloves/goggles to the grocery store. However, due to covid, and my position in my career, I'm bombarded by bad news for roughly 12 hours a day, 5-6 days a week for covid diagnosis and clinical trials, which may be having an effect on the results of my test.",,1599541766,{},g4exlz4,False,t3_insfkf,False,True,t3_insfkf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/insfkf/signs_of_depression_have_tripled_in_the_us_since/g4exlz4/,1599541777,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

""If the viral inoculum matters in determining the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, an additional hypothesized reason for **wearing facial masks would be to reduce the viral inoculum to which the wearer is exposed and the subsequent clinical impact of the disease**. Since masks can filter out some virus-containing droplets (with filtering capacity determined by mask type),2 masking might reduce the inoculum that an exposed person inhales. If this theory bears out, population-wide masking, with any type of mask that increases acceptability and adherence,2 might contribute to increasing the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections that are asymptomatic. The typical rate of asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to be 40% by the CDC in mid-July, but asymptomatic infection rates are reported to be higher than 80% in settings with universal facial masking, which provides observational evidence for this hypothesis.""

""In an outbreak on a closed Argentinian cruise ship, for example, where passengers were provided with surgical masks and staff with N95 masks, the rate of asymptomatic infection was 81% (as compared with 20% in earlier cruise ship outbreaks without universal masking). In two recent outbreaks in U.S. food-processing plants, where all workers were issued masks each day and were required to wear them, the proportion of asymptomatic infections among the more than 500 people who became infected was 95%, with only 5% in each outbreak experiencing mild-to-moderate symptoms.3 Case-fatality rates in countries with mandatory or enforced population-wide masking have remained low, even with resurgences of cases after lockdowns were lifted.""

This is often called the ""Viral Load"" theory by laymen. The evidence is not yet strong, but it is very suggestive.

* **126k tests were performed in the previous week 36 with only 1.2% positive rate** (was reported on the briefing, I will go into exct numbers laters). This is a great increase of close to 50% compared to week 35 when it was 85k. This is also FINALLY reaching the testing capacity of 100k/week that the authorities were aiming for in late May. 
* The average number of deaths per day (7 day average, looked at 10 days before) is now one person per day.
* FHM warns about the coming flu season. It is not certain how the flu and the COVID-19 will interact in society. That's why flu vaccinations will commence on 3rd of November with priority vaccinations for 65+ years old, people that are part of medical risk groups, people that are in health and care or have to take care of people in risk groups. From 1st of December the flu vaccines will be also open to the larger public. 
* ICU patients with COVID-19 are now 13 across the country and 14 regions have no ICU cases at all. The ICU capacity in the country is back to normal levels. Few regions report small local outbreaks but so far these are being tracked and haven't influenced the healthcare. 

**Please, remember there is lag in reporting and deaths reported on a certain day are usually mostly deaths that happened on previous days. On average it takes up to 11 days to report 90% of the deaths for a certain day (see in the links graphs about how that looks)**

Overall number of cases? Much less than a lot of other places in Canada.  
Manitoba: leads canada in cases/capita.  
Manitoba: currently at the most active cases ""ever.""  
Winnipeg (more than 50% of Manitoba lives here): most active cases ""ever""  


I generally haven't been caring about cases per capita, just the number of new cases/day. If it's &lt;5 and all linked to existing cases, things are good. When it's 50 new cases and they don't know how they got sick, then that's bad.

We're far from ""we're all going to die"" but we went from 0 cases to 150 active in month, shut everything down, and then tapered off to virtually zero for may-july before ramping back up.

July 14: 0 active cases in MB  
Aug 1: 49 active  
Sep 1: 380 active cases.

I'm not sure which way you'd like me to slice the numbers for you.

The good news is they've done some more ""targeted"" shutdowns and quarantines, and that appears to be slowing things down. Overall growth the last week has slowed down.

As to your statements about fires and forests... If I live in the small forest, than that fire matters to me a whole lot more. But, your statement should be indicating number of trees on fire/square km because the number of fire trucks is proportional to the number of sq km of forest. If one city has 10x the population of another, it likely has 10x the medical capacity of the first.

&gt;At least 260 cases in 11 states have been officially connected to the rally by public health officials.

Out of a gathering of 500,000 people, 260 cases have been traced back to the event. 

I want you to imagine 500,000 people from the general American population living their lives as normal over the course of a week. Of that 500,000, how many do you expect to test positive for coronavirus in the month afterwards?

From August 6-September 6, there have been ~1,300,000 new positive cases in the US. This is 0.36% of the US population.

Compare this to 260 cases borne from the 500,0000 that attended Sturgis, which is an infection rate of 0.052%. 

These are very rough estimates but how does this justify such a hysterical headline? What data even indicates that having attended the rally made one more likely to test positive for COVID in the following month afterwards?

&gt;**Hyperinsulinemic syndrome: The metabolic syndrome is broader than you think**

&gt;...
&gt; 
&gt; Results
&gt; 
&gt; The presence (+) or absence (−) of hyperinsulinemia was documented in these articles as follows: central obesity (4+ vs 0−), diabetes (5+ vs 0−), hypertension (9+ vs 1−), dyslipidemia (2+ vs 0−), renal failure (4+ vs 0−), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (5+ vs 0−), polycystic ovary syndrome (7+ vs 1−), sleep apnea (7+ vs 0−), certain cancers (4+ vs 1−), atherosclerosis (4+ vs 0−), and cardiovascular disease (8+ vs 0−). Four articles examined insulin levels in the metabolic syndrome as a whole (4+ vs 0−).
&gt; 
&gt; Conclusion
&gt; 
&gt; These data document that disorders linked to the metabolic syndrome are associated with high levels of insulin, suggesting that these diseases share a common etiology that is expressed by high levels of insulin. This leads us to propose the concept of a “hyperinsulinemic syndrome” and question the safety of insulin as a chronic therapy for patients with T2DM.",,1599549193,{},g4f5pxd,True,t3_ioou6j,False,True,t1_g4f5ave,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ioou6j/dr_aseem_malhotra_the_best_defense_against/g4f5pxd/,1599549205,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

(You could say kill the virus, but using the word kill is kind of dubious when it comes to describe virus since they're kind of not really alive). These vaccines have historically been very successful, downside is breeding vats full of SARS-CoV-2 is both hard and dangerous and have to be done in a Biosafety Level 3 environment, which is why such vaccines are much more expensive and harder to make.

Recombinant adenovirus vector vaccine means  you take adenovirus (which is among other things responsible for the common cold and fairly harmless) and you genetically modify it so instead of growing its own spike protein it grows the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, so from the outside it kind of looks like a SARS-CoV-2 viral particle. They are also deliberately made to be replication deficient so they can't cause infection and spread among people (even if adenovirus is fairly harmless).

I've seen this analogy which I think is great.

Imagine your body's immune system is like a zoo. Once it has an animal in captivity you can study its behaviour and know how to hunt it in the wild.

Say SARS-CoV-2 is a panda.

Inactivated virus vaccine is like giving the zoo a dead panda. You will know exactly what a panda looks like by having it, even if you don't quite know it's behaviour while alive.

Recombinant adenovirus vector vaccine is like getting a bear, shaving it bold and then glue white and black fur onto it and presenting it to the zoo.

This assumes everyone is equally susceptible and equally likely to be exposed. Both of which we know are not true.

We've found everything from Vitamin D, to blood type, gender, and maybe even cross protection from other coronaviruses leads to different people being more or less susceptible to infection and severe disease. There are more variables beyond the few I listed as well. All humans are not equally likely to be infected, so your numbers are already faulty not considering these variables.

Then you have a certain part of the population that's less active in the community, less likely to be exposed. This could decrease the threshold further.

There is data now suggesting herd immunity threshold may be lower, possibly in the 40-60% range. Anyone who cites Bergamo or Queens going over these numbers doesn't know how an overshoot works during a huge outbreak.

Visit dr as i noticed the lump.  - cost 0 (free parking)
xray to see what they can see - cost 0 (free parking)
Refural to a orthopedic surgeon - Meeting surgeon - cost 4$ (parking)
MRI for the surgeon to know what he is dealing with - cost 0 (free parking at MRI clinic)
Follow up appointments to go over results  - cost 0$ (free parking)
Day surgery at the hospital across the city.  - cost 5$ (gas and 1$ for my retired mother to park while dropping me off)  this included the sling and drugs/prescription.
Had to go to urgent care 8 days later as the incision looked infected - ER dr looked over it and thought it could be skin infection so gave me drugs on the spot and a prescription - cost 8$ for parking. I was lazy and didn't want to walk far.
Follow up with the surgeon 3 days later to have the staples removed - cost 0. 

Further examples.  my 5 year old fell off the vanity after climbing on it after a shower and cut up her lady bits.. Off to the childrens hospital ER for 10 hours while multiple drs came and review the injuries and were going to put her under to stitch her up until a pediatric gynocologist came on shift and decided it was best to leave it.   - cost 8 $ for parking
Follow up visit with my Daughters dr 7 days later - cost 0$.

Ambulance rides can cost you 2-400$ if your work benefits don't cover it. IF you are staying over in the hospital you can pay to have a semiprivate or private room (2 or 1 person per room).  If you don't want to pay you may be in a larger room with 4 people.  Most employers have ""benefits"" that cover perscriptions costs, overnight private rooms and dentist, eye, physio, massages etc. 



When the cost for your health is 0$ you are going to go and get checked out if something comes up because you are not afraid of the financial hit you may have to take.. Your kid has a fever or infected cut? Of to your dr or a local walkin.

Normally, I would keep my mouth shut, but the current mess of the immigration debate (cluelessness on both sides) requires the truth more than ever.

1. What you are talking about, the I-864 Affidavit of Support, is for sponsors (American citizens) applying for *residency,* commonly known as Green Card, for someone else, e.g. siblings, parents, or children.

2. ""the spouse is not allowed to be on any sort of government assistance such as welfare or medicaid..."" is unclear. This does NOT mean assistance will be denied to the beneficiary (spouse in your example). The beneficiary will be granted benefits exactly the same as a citizen. What it does mean is the government will subsequently sue the SPONSOR for that amount of money. So, if the spouse receives $11k in welfare, the government will then sue the US Citizen for $11k. It's obviously moot if you're married with combined assets, but there is a big difference in cases with separate assets, such as divorce.

3. ""...for the first 10 years of marriage"" The period of time is *at least* 10 years. The beneficiary must pay social security for 40 credit quarters before the sponsor is off the hook. If the beneficiary does not work or gets paid very little, the sponsor is on the hook forever, even if divorced. However, this period of time ends when the beneficiary successfully naturalizes into a US Citizen. So it also can very well be less than 10 years, depending on how soon the beneficiary naturalizes.",,1599603472,{},g4hk05u,False,t3_ioquex,False,True,t1_g4fuqjb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ioquex/more_than_100_austrians_accidentally_received_us/g4hk05u/,1599606939,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

The math doesn't work that way.  You would need those cases to account for literally something like 50% of national COVID cases to get to 260K if the majority of them were concentrated weeks after 8/10.

&gt;And I'm not sure what you mean by ""where are the cases"". The cited number is a projection based on the actual number of cases in the tracked counties.

The cases among those who attended Sturgis.  The cases you are citing are total cases in those counties.  If tens of thousands of people had contracted COVID at Sturgis and brought it back to their home counties, we would have more than 260 cases tied to Sturgis and 1 death.

infection mitigation policies. In counties with the largest relative inflow to the event, the per 1,000 case rate increased by 10.7 percent after 24 days following the onset of Sturgis Pre-Rally Events. Multiplying the percent case increases for the high, moderate-high and moderate inflow counties by each county’s respective pre-rally cumulative COVID-19 cases and aggregating, yields a total of 263,708 additional cases in these locations due to the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. Adding the number of new cases due to the Rally in South Dakota estimated by synthetic control 
(3.6 per 1,000 population, scaled by the South Dakota population of approximately 858,000) brings the total number of cases to 266,796 or 19 percent of 1.4 million new cases of COVID-19 in the United States between August 2nd 2020 and September 2nd 2020.If we conservatively assume that all of these cases were non-fatal, then these casesrepresent a cost of over $12.2 billion.

[],,Busch-Diesel,,,[],,,,text,t2_6qomajz4,False,False,[],"Okay I'll go into discussion exactly why this post is propaganda IMO:

The entire video is just mental masturbation with assumptions and models, but presents it as though it's fact.  Shouldn't we be able to use real-world data to assess the effectiveness of mask usage considering we're 6 months into a worldwide pandemic with no shortage of real-world data?  

In the video they keep saying masks are 50% effective, which is obviously just a number pulled from their asses, which they acknowledge, but they don't make any effort to provide data showing how effective masks actually are.  Spoiler: It's because they're not even close to 50% effective.

The video assumes mask filtration is directly correlated to the chance of preventing an infection, when there are definitely more important factors at play.  For a simple example, a 50% particle reduction during a 1 hour face-to-face interaction isn't going to result in a 50% reduced chance of infection.

The entire assumption that we can defeat COVID by reducing R0 to under 1 with masks ignores the fact that, if masks work, when we stop using them R0 will increase back above 1.  So either use masks forever or have a second wave.  If the virus dies out due to herd immunity, we just flattened the curve without reducing the area under it.  If the virus is eliminated well after the peak due to a vaccine, we may save some lives, but not an overwhelming majority of them (looking at daily deaths in places like France, New York, and even America), and it's completely dependent on widespread mask usage until there's a vaccine.

The video states R0 for COVID without masks is 2.5.  Places without mask mandates like Georgia, Florida, Sweden, and even ""successful"" places like Norway and Denmark have shown that R0 can drop below 1 *without* masks.  Places like California have seen very similar outcomes to other ""poorly managed"" states, which would suggest that masks aren't as effective as we think they are, or at least not a significant contributor to R0 compared to other factors like population density, population demographics, and other non-pharmaceutical intervention methods.  


The only things the video got right are that there are a lot of variables that effect their assumptions, but they kind of shuffle it to the side while focusing on the ""important"" part being the mathematical model applied these assumptions to.  

The video is propaganda.  It's blatantly misleading viewers into thinking masks are both significantly more effective than they are in reality and that masks are necessary to stop COVID, while completely ignoring the data that suggests otherwise (and lack of data that backs up their own points).  It's literally just 7 minutes of analyzing an incredibly simplified model that only looks at three inputs: mask usage, mask inhale effectiveness, and mask exhale effectiveness.  It perpetuates the divisive idea that masks are necessary and does absolutely nothing substantial to back up its own argument.  Plus to top everything off, it blatantly ignores real-world data.",,1599601944,{},g4hgu5n,False,t3_iotupg,False,True,t1_g4gxxcc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iotupg/why_masks_work_better_than_youd_think/g4hgu5n/,1599605330,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

## Abstract

Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has poorer clinical outcomes in males compared to females, and immune responses underlie these sex-related differences in disease trajectory. As immune responses are in part regulated by metabolites, we examined whether the serum metabolome has sex-specificity for immune responses in COVID-19. In males with COVID- 19, kynurenic acid (KA) and a high KA to kynurenine (K) ratio was positively correlated with age, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines and was negatively correlated with T cell responses, revealing that KA production is linked to immune responses in males. Males that clinically deteriorated had a higher KA:K ratio than those that stabilized. In females with COVID-19, this ratio positively correlated with T cell responses and did not correlate with age or clinical severity. KA is known to inhibit glutamate release, and we observed that serum glutamate is lower in patients that deteriorate from COVID-19 compared to those that stabilize, and correlates with immune responses. Analysis of Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data revealed that expression of kynurenine aminotransferase, which regulates KA production, correlates most strongly with cytokine levels and aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation in older males. This study reveals that KA has a sex-specific link to immune responses and clinical outcomes, in COVID-19 infection.",,1599601814,{},g4hgjdo,True,t3_ip2zrw,False,True,t3_ip2zrw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ip2zrw/kynurenic_acid_underlies_sexspecific_immune/g4hgjdo/,1599605188,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

That’s “herd immunity.”

(T-cell) Immune persons cannot transmit Covid because they’re not infected. The virus may be in their system but it cannot infect cells. Naked virion particles outside of the body cannot survive and are destroyed by UV light, heat, molecular oxygen, free radicals, and about a million other things. You can have Covid in your system and sneeze on someone and if you’re T-cell immune then they’re not getting Covid, because these aren’t active viral particles. They’re basically just RNA fragments. It’s only when the viral particles can enter a cell to hijack the cells process of replication that a virus becomes “active” (transmissible). With T-cell immunity the virions cannot do this and are harmless.

It doesn't make much sense to me that the virus infected and spread via the respiratory tract, but skipped causing symptoms until it spread to the GI tract.

Large in-person gatherings without social distancing and with individuals who have traveled outside the local area are classified as the ""highest risk"" for COVID-19 spread by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Between August 7 and August 16, 2020, nearly 500,000 motorcycle enthusiasts converged on Sturgis, South Dakota for its annual motorcycle rally. Large crowds, coupled with minimal mask-wearing and social distancing by attendees, raised concerns that this event could serve as a COVID-19 ""super-spreader."" This study is the first to explore the impact of this event on social distancing and the spread of COVID-19. First, using anonymized cell phone data from SafeGraph, Inc. we document that (i) smartphone pings from non-residents, and (ii) foot traffic at restaurants and bars, retail establishments, entertainment venues, hotels and campgrounds each rose substantially in the census block groups hosting Sturgis rally events. Stay-at-home behavior among local residents, as measured by median hours spent at home, fell. Second, using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a synthetic control approach, we show that by September 2, a month following the onset of the Rally, COVID-19 cases increased by approximately 6 to 7 cases per 1,000 population in its home county of Meade. Finally, difference-in-differences (dose response) estimates show that following the Sturgis event, counties that contributed the highest inflows of rally attendees experienced a 7.0 to 12.5 percent increase in COVID-19 cases relative to counties that did not contribute inflows. Descriptive evidence suggests these effects may be muted in states with stricter mitigation policies (i.e., restrictions on bar/restaurant openings, mask-wearing mandates). We conclude that the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally generated public health costs of approximately $12.2 billion.",,1599601597,{},g4hg1rd,True,t3_ip2xcg,False,True,t3_ip2xcg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ip2xcg/the_contagion_externality_of_a_superspreading/g4hg1rd/,1599604946,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

I highly agree that home Ec should be far more prominent in education than it is now.  Students should come out of HS knowing how to save for retirement, how to use compound interest to help themselves (and how to avoid being ensnared by it), how to cook a healthy meal (and what that is) and how to do basic home repairs/change oil on a car.  I'd have used/did use the ones I learned more than anything I learned in Trig, and I have a private pilot's license.

Correlation doesn’t mean causation. National Bureu of Economics research found the opposite to be true. Although everyone was honestly expecting cases to rise, it didn’t happen. Mostly attributed to masks and that the larger non-protesting population stayed at home more. The rise in cases is mainly attributed to easing lockdown restrictions which happened shortly after the protests began.

&gt;RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL – All 2,000 volunteers selected in São Paulo to be administered the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Oxford University have already been given the first dose of the drug in phase III of trials.

In the city, the research is coordinated by the Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP). The global development of the drug is also under the responsibility of AstraZeneca Pharmaceutical Company.

The administration of the initial doses was completed during the month of August and the second dose has started to be distributed, in an expedited process. “It is well underway, we have already performed blood tests.”

All participants of the São Paulo stage of the study are well and did not present serious adverse symptoms after vaccination. All participants of the São Paulo stage of the study are well and did not present serious adverse symptoms after vaccination. (Photo: internet reproduction) “The results of these tests will be computed in a system accessed by Oxford specialists, who are responsible for developing the statistics required for the study,” says Soraya Smaili, Dean of UNIFESP.

“We now have to wait a little longer for all the tests to be done. The goal is to determine if the antibodies will last.” The expert pointed out that the second round of vaccines works as a type of “booster” for the first dose, the most important one.

All participants of the São Paulo stage of the study are well and did not present serious adverse symptoms after vaccination.

One of the reasons for choosing Brazil to run the vaccine trials were the disease’s epidemiological rates, which were high at the time the international cooperation was announced.

The current scenario, fortunately, no longer points to a sharp growth in infections in Brazil. On Friday, September 4th, the country reached a rolling seven-day average of 41,000 new cases and 857 deaths.

This is based on the notifications of the past seven days divided by seven, which offsets the traditional underreporting on weekends when the Health Secretariats work in shifts.

Rio de Janeiro and Bahia

In Rio de Janeiro, approximately 87 percent of the 1,500 volunteers have already received the first dose and 27 percent have been given the second dose. This study is coordinated by the D’or Research and Teaching Institute.

The forecast for the closing of all doses is still in October of this year. The same institute is in charge of testing 2,500 volunteers in Salvador, Bahia – the location saw a considerable increase in volunteer recruitment after a decision by the British university.

In the region, 42 percent of volunteers have already been administered the initial dose and another 16 percent have been given the second shot. The testing process is expected to be completed in November. Should they present any typical symptom of Covid-19, the volunteers will undergo an RT-PCR type test.

Once the vaccine’s efficacy is confirmed, it will also be produced in Brazil, with the involvement of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) laboratories in Rio de Janeiro.

Diseases can make it even more difficult. The 94% of COVID deaths with pre-existing conditions could  be all over the place. Yes, it is possible that someone who is old, obese, and has heart disease, the type of person who may have already been going downhill, went kaput because COVID sped up the process that was already happening.

Because you file taxes, it's obvious to the IRS what your situation is. This guy gets a pension from being a waiter in the US in the 60s.

(If we knew the kind of pension, I'm guessing the cause would become crystal clear.) 

Citizens who receive SSI qualify for the stimulus even if they don't file tax returns, therefore the IRS needed to use SSA data to issue checks.

This definition doesn't preclude (and in fact probably best works with) a super-spreader being a person *at* an event, that facilitates rapid transmission. By which ""event"" means stuff like the way we think of Sturgis, or a wedding or some other indoor ceremony.

However, that definition pretty clearly is focused on answering ""is X a SSEV"" by comparing *people* who spread heavily against *people* who spread less heavily. The key ingredients are knowing your R in advance, expecting a normal distribution of transmission occurrences that average out to that R, and having all those transmissions occur independently of one another.

So if you had 10 infected people all acting independently of each other who then go on to spread the virus to 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 5, and 13 people, respectively, the mean R would be 3.0. Out of 30 people who got infected, the person responsible for spreading it to 13 others would be either an 80th or 90th percentile SSEV. (I'm a little rusty and not sure if Z(n) is meant to take the cumulative spread at n (12 at n=8) or the marginal spread at n (5 at n=9)).

But what kind of widget is meant by ""n others"", people, or events? This is straightforward:

&gt; define an SSEV as any **infected person**

""Event"" in this context does not appear to mean ""the sum of damage across a discrete gathering"". Each person, and the web of people they transmit to, represents an ""event"".

I suppose you could use this definition to compare the Sturgis gathering to other comparable large gatherings, and see which among them is the super-spreader. But as it stands, the use of super-spreader in this headline looks like emotionally wrought junk science.",,1599598256,{},g4h8pov,False,t3_iownsr,False,True,t1_g4h2jgp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iownsr/sturgis_motorcycle_rally_was_superspreading_event/g4h8pov/,1599601072,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Access to healthcare is human right of course, and everyone has the right and can access healthcare, but calling insurance a human right is where you start to lose people, because the whole point of insurance is that the policy owner is taking on the risk that they might pay 10,000 dollars in insurance premiums but never need 10,000 worth of service. Again, it is the fact that people are seeing the same benefit whether they pay into the system or not that causes issues for people because if they aren't paying, I don't want to either.

&gt; This is by no means an accurate
accounting of the true externality cost of the event, as it counts those who attended and were
infected as part of the externality when their costs are likely internalized.


That second quote is from the paper itself. 


I was wondering where this number came from. So I also pulled up the paper that they reference. 

https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3680348

&gt; We therefore value asymptomatic cases at about $11,000 (in 2019 dollars) each which
corresponds to using a 0.1 percent amount of the VSL in DOT (2016).
3 Symptomatic cases with
no hospitalizations are assumed to line up in the minor category (about $33,000 each).
Hospitalizations not in ICU or on a ventilator are classified in the moderate category ($512,000
each). ICUs without being on a ventilator are classified in the serious category ($1.1 million
each). ICUs on a mechanical ventilator are classified in the severe category ($2.9 million each).


Maybe someone can explain to me how an asymptomatic case costs $11,000? Especially when asymptomatic cases are very unlikely to spread the virus except through prolonged direct contact.


Likewise, minor symptomatic cases not requiring hospitalization costing $33,000 seems high. 


The study responsible for those numbers is trying to extrapolate cost data from DOT(Dept of Transportation) estimates used to value costs of injuries from traffic accidents.

&gt; A limitation of the DOT (2016) estimates is that they are specific for injuries and
primarily relatable to vehicle accidents.

So...you're trying to estimate costs for a health issue based on health issues stemming from vehicle accidents, when treating vehicle accidents, even minor, tends to be incredibly inflated for several reasons, one being that there is usually a party at fault and as such- a very real punitive financial incentive in play. It seems like maybe the costs should have been estimated from something else more similar. How much does the common flu cost to treat on average for a per case basis?


Edit for additional information- 
The referenced cost study also calculated the effect of *dread* on costs incurred. So people being scared of catching the virus and spending money to prevent catching the virus inflates the cost. This was not reflected in the 46k per infected person. But it's an interesting factor. For this specific case, the sturgis rally, I doubt anyone was incurring costs from *dread* about the virus.

Also, in conjunction with this, a lot of pretty nasty-toned mocking of people who had been worried about the virus.

Also, in conjuntion with that, strong claims about people spreading misinformation when the people saying this are literally spreading misinformation. For example, a strong insistance that cold weather doesn't affect respiratory disease and that the only affect comes from behavioral changes. That's flat out untrue and worse than misinformation.

It sort of seems like a brigade going on. But then again, I think there are events going on in the wider world that create a strong incentive for us to just ignore the virus.

You seem to think every virologist works for the FDA. That's a very interesting view of the world but hardly true.

Also, the Oxford Vaccine Group isn't even based in the US. Why not look to whether the UK government approves the Oxford/AZ vaccine? Or look at approvals in Australia, South Korea, Taiwan, France, Germany, or Israel, all of which have advanced biotech.

Honestly, your statements are expressions of anger, not rational or informed courses of action. If you don't want to take a vaccine, no one is holding you down. There will be a long line, and people will be queued through the middle of next year. The idea that a vaccine fairy is going to land on November 3rd is magical thinking.

From a quick read it seems the crux of the argument is that they looked at a big sample of everyone who went to the event using anonymized cell phone location data, and then looked at which counties around the country those people were from. In the 3 weeks following the event, the counties that had high representation at Sturgis had bigger spikes than the counties that didn't, so they attributed that difference to Sturgis. As far as the more direct impact in South Dakota itself, they only estimated it at 3,000 infections, the rest was this effect of impacts seen by people spreading out around the country.

There are obviously a ton of confounding factors, one of the biggest is probably that in places where people were more likely to go to Sturgis, they were also more likely to ignore distancing guidelines in other ways. So there were surely plenty of people who never went to Sturgis and never even left their county but were spreading covid at the same time.

Without actual contact tracing in most of the country I don't think there's really a good way to calculate the exact impact it had. I agree with you that 266,000 seems like a stretch, as presented.

I also don't really think anyone cares. Surely the toll from this event is somewhere in between a couple thousand infections and a quarter million. Some people will argue that even the former is unacceptably high, and some people will think that even if it was 266,000 people it doesn't matter and they're never going to stop living their lives because of some virus.",,1599602381,{},g4hhuan,False,t3_iownsr,False,True,t1_g4gwfjd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iownsr/sturgis_motorcycle_rally_was_superspreading_event/g4hhuan/,1599605832,36,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

For context..

Someone whose treatment has complications may see bills about double that: $20,292. (The researchers came up with those numbers by examining average costs of hospital admissions for people with pneumonia.)

Because I thought the government were relying on us to know the risks. How many people have caught covid from being in a shopping centre (where quite a few people don't wear masks)? Or from having their hair cut (they'll have a mask on, but they'll be fairly close to you in an enclosed space for quite some time)? 

And how many have actually caught it from a pub that was overcrowded?

I have absolutely no idea. Do you? And without that kind of data, I can't weigh up the risks.

For clarity, I'm not going into pubs - crowded or otherwise - at the moment. But I'm not particularly surprised that many are.

&gt; The information has been readily available for a long time,

The same government information that said there was no evidence that masks were going to help a couple of months ago (despite many scientists stating the opposite), but are now mandatory in many places?

&gt;From there, you can deduce that the longer you're in that enclosed space the greater the risk you are taking. 

So the kids and teachers that are enclosed in classrooms for hours on end are at fairly high risk then? And whatever you might want to believe, there's very little opportunity for real social distancing in a lot of schools (oh, and teachers are told not to wear masks at all in lots of schools).

If we're meant to be informed on the risks, how about giving us the actual raw data rather than just the the rolled up (and often changing/contradictory advice)?

&gt;Large in-person gatherings without social distancing and with individuals who have traveled outside the local area are classified as the “highest risk” for COVID-19 spread by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Between August 7 and August 16, 2020, nearly 500,000 motorcycle enthusiasts converged on Sturgis, South Dakota for its annual motorcycle rally. Large crowds, coupled with minimal mask-wearing and social distancing by attendees, raised concerns that this event could serve as a COVID-19 “super-spreader.” This study is the first to explore the impact of this event on social distancing and the spread of COVID-19. First, using anonymized cell phone data from SafeGraph, Inc. we document that (i) smartphone pings from non-residents, and (ii) foot traffic at restaurants and bars, retail establishments, entertainment venues, hotels and campgrounds each rose substantially in the census block groups hosting Sturgis rally events. Stay-at-home behavior among local residents, as measured by median hours spent at home, fell. Second, using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a synthetic control approach, we show that by September 2, a month following the onset of the Rally, COVID-19 cases increased by approximately 6 to 7 cases per 1,000 population in its home county of Meade. Finally, difference-in-differences (dose response) estimates show that following the Sturgis event, counties that contributed the highest inflows of rally attendees experienced a 7.0 to 12.5 percent increase in COVID-19 cases relative to counties that did not contribute inflows. Descriptive evidence suggests these effects may be muted in states with stricter mitigation policies (i.e., restrictions on bar/restaurant openings, mask-wearing mandates). **We conclude that the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally generated public health costs of approximately $12.2 billion**

By making a very half assed effort we essentially got the worst of both worlds, outbreaks both drawn out and severe, as well as an economy in shambles with homelessness and unemployment as the current situation or future situation for many Americans. We really couldn't have handled it worse. 

Some economists calculate the overall loss will be between 50-95% greater than if we had focused on actual containment and tracing back when we still had time, spending the money and taking the immediate hit, but ensuring a better economy and less disease for months and months ahead prior to effective vaccinations.

It’s a sign that you have no idea what your talking about because, like I said, a mechanism is NOT the same as clinical efficacy. There are MANY agents with equally plausible mechanisms. If every drug with a plausible mechanism worked we would have cured every disease known to man. And sometimes we find agents that work with NO prior proposed mechanism.

What none of you seem to get us that the pre-test probability of any of these agents working is very low. But you’ve latched on to HCQ because that happened to be the drug China started using and you felt smart after watching some YouTube vid on it. That’s it. If it hasn’t proven clinical efficacy in multiple well-designed RCTs, it doesn’t work, even if some YouTuber made a pretty little diagram for you idiots about the “mechanism”. And now that we finally have enough trials to safely abandon it, you bozos still can’t get it through your head that mechanism is not efficacy. And now it MUST be some big pharma conspiracy that your stupid drug didn’t work because it’s cheap and look and the mechanism! The issue with that is.. we finally got some good data behind steroids that actually is sufficient to support efficacy, and we now use them wisely. These are cheap drugs that work. 

Sorry for the rant but I’m a little frustrated with redditors with zero scientific training pretending they know anything about clinical medicine after circle-jerking online about a drug for a few months.

Not so long ago before we kicked of this self esteem culture of 'everyone has a right to a voice and an opinion on everything', It was actually the mark of a critically thinking person to not waste their time with low quality sources. 

People looked closely not only at the message, but the messenger and his possible motive for said message.

The anti-vaxx movement was taken over by a loud minority yelling about autism, and now that's basically all the mainstream anti-vaxx message is about. I'm interested in the kernel of truth that started the movement, however. Most theories start because of something actually happening, and digging to the root of those ""case zeroes"" seems to help me better understand the whole picture. 

That being said, the US and their CDC have been incrementally making our vaccination schedules more and more aggressive throughout time. We have one of the most diverse populations by country, and we also have the most aggressive schedule. Now, this both makes and doesn't make sense. It makes sense because you want to broad strokes protect as many as you can, but where it doesn't make sense is that since we have so much diversity we can't expect all vaccinations to do the same thing to person A as they did to person B, or even person Z^3x . We do trials to try and understand the scope of these side effects, who is most commonly affected, and we make guidelines to match the data. All good when that data is appropriately used, but that is kind of the issue here.

A lot of people these days that are having adverse reactions to vaccines or that are having children who have these reactions, are seeing or noting them in their family history for the first time. And they feel betrayed, to a certain extent. Told that something was super safe, **super necessary**, and had been completely vetted for by our powers at be, but then they went and had a bad reaction. Now, please understand, I am talking about small percentages of people. 1% have an adverse reaction to vaccines (a small percentage of that portion includes death even - usually [from what I've read ***I AM NOT A DOCTOR***] from an allergic reaction), but we don't really go around worrying about that 1% unless they know they have family history to support issues with vaccines. Here's the extra kicker, though. Some of those people with family histories will still get pressured into vaccination. For no real reason. People like to throw around the term ""herd immunity"", but then they don't even believe in it themselves. 

These are the parallels that I'm drawing and asking questions about. As a mask wearing and vaccinated individual, it just makes me feel like I'm taking crazy pills sometimes when I'm the only one around me who's actually willing to try and dig to the bottom of an issue. Even if I don't 100% believe in the crazy shit that someone spouts, I will do my best to try and get to the root of why that issue is what it is. 

But on the topic of Covid... if the CDC was already in question legitimately by already having 1% of the population be acceptable tactical losses, then why wouldn't they be willing to now? What's the death rate? About 1%? 🤔

But they can have the same results, and in the case of ionophores, they do. Sure, for political reasons you hate HCQ, fine. I get it. Then fucking get Quercetin and/or EGCG, they are together better than HCQ anyway with less sideeffect.

Sorry for the rant but as an engineer, I believe in tests and testing hypothesis, not in politics. Yes, the results are in and the Zinc+ionophore works as an early treatment when the viral load was not huge.

Just bowing down and licking the tory boot is not worth it. For what reason should anybody be banned from doing something that protects themselves and others and doesn't negatively affect anybody whatsoever? It has no downsides. Just wear the masks, what they gonna do, arrest millions of students?  Again if I was a parent I wouldn't let them not wear a mask, they either are allowed to wear a mask or they're taken out of school, and maybe even a lawsuit could happen because of it. I imagine if thousands of parents got together to sue to let their children wear masks, there'd surely be a solicitor/barrister out there willing to do a class action thing pro bono. I'm not sure. I know more about the yanks legal system than I do our own.
  
It'd be like banning warm coats in the winter. Wearing a coat doesn't harm anybody, neither the wearer or anybody nearby, and *not* wearing one *IS* harmful, the cold can make people ill or even kill them.
