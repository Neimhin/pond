The vaccines do not stay in your body, so there's no risk of interaction between the two platforms.  The vaccines simply provoke an immune response, and that's what stays around.  The immune response from each vaccine platform is slightly different, so the mixing of two platforms is arguably creating a better/stronger protection.  This is being corroborated by the evidence from the AZ/mRNA combinations that are occurring in Europe.

I'm not a doctor, YMMV, etc.  But, where I am in the US, getting access to the shot is very easy and there are myriad appointments available.

I was making 500 masks in June 2020 to donate and it was *easy* to find a paper documenting a study of tests on the efficacy of various fabrics vs. a surgical mask and N95, with/without effective seal. The most effective cloth masks are made of double layers of tightly woven natural fabrics - like cotton and silk, because they’re not smooth fibers the way synthetics are; they’re fuzzy, so they trap more particles. Quality quilting cotton is extremely tightly woven. Cotton flannel is even better, as it’s super fuzzy. Silk “satin” is also effective (what they used was charmeuse).

A layer of cotton flannel/batting sandwiches between two layers of quilting cotton was the most effective, over 90%, matching surgical mask effectiveness AND N95 effectiveness without a seal. Double layers of tightly woven quilting cotton, silk charmeuse, and one layer of quilting cotton covered by a layer of silk chiffon were also extremely effective - over 85%. 

This means that a mask made of several layers of quality, tightly-woven, natural fiber fabric, with a nose strip to ensure a tight fit, is *absolutely* effective and will *definitely*  provide protection against Covid-19.

The pandemic (spreading genetic material) is fueled by these transmissions and with reinfection and new variants outcompeting it may take some time for things to settle. I’m ready for it to be over. It’s just not. We’re still in a pandemic and haven’t crossed into the endemic phase yet.

Stage 1: You come to the hospital because you’re having trouble breathing on your own. The medical team puts you on supplemental oxygen and admits you to a ward, where you’re given monoclonal antibodies, antivirals or other treatments. If all goes well, your ability to breathe will recover in a few days and you’ll be sent home.

Stage 2: The breathing treatments don’t work and you feel like you’re drowning. You can’t go to the bathroom or even sit up on your own. Doctors transfer you to the intensive care unit.

Stage 3: A machine forces air into your lungs through a bulky face mask wrapped tightly around your face. Even so, the number of breaths you need to take to get your required oxygen leaves you utterly exhausted.

Stage 4: Still unable to get enough oxygen into your body, you are sedated, then paralyzed, so a tube can be threaded into your airway and connected to a ventilator. But first, if you’re lucky, you’ll be able to call your loved ones in case it’s their last chance to hear your voice.

Stage 5: If several days on a ventilator have not turned things around for you, doctors may try to get you on an ECMO machine. These machines will oxygenate your blood for you, bypassing your lungs so they might have a chance to heal. But community hospitals like Gallardo’s don’t have them, and you might not be stable enough for a transfer to one that does.

Stage 6: Now your medical team has its hands full dealing with the consequences of your COVID-19 treatment. Tubes are inserted into your chest cavity to clear out the air that has leaked there. Your kidneys can’t keep up with all the drugs you’ve received, so you may require dialysis. Because you’ve been sedentary you may develop a clot, which could cut off blood flow to vital organs or result in a heart attack or stroke. You may need to be revived with CPR.

Stage 7: If your family decides you have no chance to recover, they’ll have a final FaceTime call with you. The breathing tube will be removed and the ventilator shut off. Someone from the medical team will be there to hold your hand until your breathing stops.

“I’ve been at this for 17 months now,” Gallardo writes. “It doesn’t get easier.”

If this sounds like a situation you’d rather avoid, she has some simple advice: “Get vaccinated.”",,,,1630496631,{},hb6c56l,True,t3_pfs4rw,False,False,t3_pfs4rw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pfs4rw/coronavirus_today_what_its_like_to_die_from/hb6c56l/,1630575846.0,877,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,2,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I suspect vaccine mandates will require people to be caught up with their boosters in order to be in compliance, once booster schedules are published and offered in the US. This is logical, for example, due to the antibody titers we discussed.

Anecdotally, people who had natural infection often don't seem to want to admit that their antibody titers wane, so this is a problem when it comes to trying to maintain levels necessary to prevent infection (and therefore transmission) from strains like Delta.

I think what we'd really want from a mandate is that ""your antibody titers must be at level X,"" whether that be through infection or vaccine. That's virtually impossible to implement.

Now, if the vaccine mandates are there just to keep people out of the hospital, then it might make sense to ""qualify"" anyone with immunity from a previous infection or a vaccine, at least based on the papers coming out about robustness of previous natural infection.",,,,1630496446,{},hb6bulf,False,t3_pfiqmf,False,False,t1_hb5whg7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pfiqmf/prior_covid_infection_doesnt_guarantee_good/hb6bulf/,1630575705.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Personally in my California high school, masks are mandatory indoors and optional outdoors, but most keep them on outside unless eating lunch. Each class has hand sanitizer and a box of masks by the doors. They’ve turned off all the water fountains but have given some teachers cases of water to give out instead. This year everyone must bring a personal device or borrow a laptop from the school since most work is based online, but there are still some teachers doing traditional teaching with paper or a mixture of the two. Seating for most classes is in alphabetical order so they can easily trace when someone catches covid. I’d say the only problem is that the halls are pretty packed during passing period (luckily I’m in an outside school so there is more air circulation) and there are some teachers who have their masks under their noses. Oh and they send out emails to everyone if someone on campus has gotten covid (the person remains anonymous) and if you are known to have been near them in class or have been in that same seat then your email would have extra instructions to quarantine at home just in case. It was kinda yikes getting one that said someone had covid on the first day of school lol

That’s all I remember off the top of my head.

&gt;Xing says the **antibody response to the Pfizer boost seems to be even stronger than the one most people generate after receiving two doses of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine**, according to earlier trial data. 


But it is not clear how those responses compare with those seen in people who receive two doses of **mRNA vaccines such as Pfizer–BioNTech’s, which tend to trigger an especially potent antibody response after a second dose.**

&gt;Giving people first and second doses of different vaccines probably makes sense, says Altmann. But he wonders what will happen if people need a third dose to prolong immunity or protect against emerging coronavirus variants. **Repeated doses of virus-based vaccines such as the Oxford–AstraZeneca one tend to be increasingly less effective**, because the immune system mounts a response against the adenovirus. RNA vaccines, by contrast, tend to trigger stronger side effects with added doses. 


&gt;*“I do think there’s a brave new world of vaccinology to be scoped in all of this,”* Altmann says.


&gt;Last week, a **UK study called Com-COV**, which analysed combinations of the same two vaccines, found that:

  -  **people in the mix-and-match groups experienced higher rates of common vaccine-related side effects, such as fever, than did people who received two doses of the same vaccine2**.

No, *you* are puffing yourself up, which is kinda pointless and boring especially because no one cares (and definitely I don't). Stop convincing yourself you're so important that someone might feel the need to ""downplay your successes"". I'm making some very circumstantial criticism. 

You can call it lockdown or James, but however you call it, fact of the matter is you've had stricter restrictions for longer than several European cities. And anyways - past doesn't matter. I'm talking about the next few months. You're more likely to be in lockdown over the next few months than an average European or American; that is, unless your government drops its covid zero policy, which tbh would be great and I hope it happens soon.

Then again, start bragging about whatever success as if it's relevant within this discussion, I still don't care and it still doesn't change my point about the next few months, which is why I said I'm glad I'm not living in NZ whereas I definitely *was* jealous during the past winter, but I also was jealous of Australia or Norway for that matter.

Then it was fda approved for that and now it's prescribed off label for other types of baldness that it is not approved for and has not been shown effective for. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30604379/

Then there is neurontin.  At first it was for seizures. Then it became an off label all purpose psychoactive for depression and anxiety. I worked with a psychologist who saw issues with it early on.

That depends on what study you're looking at. Since Janssen was administered to fewer people, the uncertainty is higher. 

In the CDC's MMWR [Effectiveness of COVID-19 Vaccines in Preventing Hospitalization Among Adults Aged ≥65 Years — COVID-NET, 13 States, February–April 2021](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7032e3.htm), they found:

&gt;  Among adults aged 65–74 years, effectiveness of full vaccination in preventing COVID-19–associated hospitalization was **96% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 94%–98%)** for Pfizer-BioNTech, **96% (95% CI = 95%–98%)** for Moderna, and **84% (95% CI = 64%–93%)** for Janssen vaccine products.

Look at how much bigger the confidence interval is for Janssen. 29 percentage points, rather than 3 or 4.

Many reports seem to show an overrepresentation of Janssen vaccine recipients among breakthrough cases and hospitalizations, but not always statistically significant.

And [some infectious disease doctors](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/booster-may-be-needed-jj-shot-delta-variant-spreads-some-experts-already-taking-2021-06-25/) started taking and recommending booster shots.",,,,1630452663,{},hb4dn5d,False,t3_pf4633,False,True,t1_hb2xdpy,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pf4633/moderna_creates_twice_as_many_antibodies_as/hb4dn5d/,1630539953.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

We started schools WEEKS ago (beginning of August). Very few mask mandates across the state. Contact tracing is scattershot...some parents don't inform the school of positive covid tests until a week has passed. *Some* keep their kids home while others don't...until their kid shows a symptom or two and then suddenly they let everyone know.

&amp;#x200B;

In fairness kids can wear masks without fear of any kind (in my school at least). I obviously don't mind. No other kids say *anything* about it. I have a huge thing of hand sanitizer in my room. I keep tissues around the room and I spray my desks in between every class and then leave a papertowel on the table for the kids to wipe it down (so it sits for 3-4 minutes first).

I have personally only had about 10 kids out total for covid isolation. Some teachers, however, have had 20-30 kids AT ONCE out for isolation. The isolation usually only lasts for a few days when they get a negative test and their symptoms go away.

&amp;#x200B;

This is basically all up to the parents/kids in my district. I have no clue what to think at this point though. The kids think this will only last another month. I think the county is going to hold out to the bitter end...which may likely be next Summer because I doubt the state will mandate schools going virtual.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Oh and also we've had teachers out constantly. Every single day. For isolation due to exposure. If you are vaccinated you just need a negative test and/or no symptoms (and wear a mask for a little while). Which means a lot of teachers are out a day or two for testing \[or possibly more if they have symptoms\]. And maybe 30% of these jobs are being filled. The other 70% are being covered by teachers during their planning. And we don't get paid for covering someone else's class. We just lose our planning time which for me means that I have to stay longer after work to plan and grade.

And there's no end in sight. I've been called to cover only ONCE, but the coverage calendar is cycling so quickly now. A couple of people that have different planning periods have been asked to cover 3 times in the past 2 weeks. Honestly, I'd be fine with it if they would just pay me my hourly rate for covering. At least I get SOMETHING out of it and if I have to stay an hour after school then I know I at least made that money up during coverage. \*shrug\*",,,,1630462860,{},hb4zohz,False,t3_pf81k1,False,True,t3_pf81k1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pf81k1/more_than_half_of_georgia_covid_outbreaks_are/hb4zohz/,1630551628.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oh but the government also taped off all the outdoor parks, so if you want to go out with your friend? Its either the bar or your not well ventilated apartment...

Also they didnt close gyms or group workouts, but they banned music over 120bpm in group workouts because ""you will spit more"" 

Thats not to mention that the large majority of people still go to the office to work, and the subway is crowded as ever, if not even more - because they reduced the times, so more people crowd on one train

But there is 2 real problems in my opinion. The first is that there are a lot of young anti~vax or at least ""I dont need a vaccine"" young people, there are quite a few cases of serious side effects which get investigated then leading to more anti vax fuel. Recently the government refused to investigate the death of a 20 year old woman dying 12 days after vaccination - that didnt help

The second is that if you do catch the rona, u have to go spend ur quarantine in a government facility. Nobody wants to do that shit so lots of people just dont test unless they are required too ~ like part time workers / teachers. Of course lots of people are going out and getting sent to the centers, but there are also plenty of who are purposely not getting tested to avoid that

The limits of K방역 have been reached and I suspect the government knows this and is just waiting till they reach some 70% vaccine threshold before they are willing to publicly say we have to live with the rona

Violent expiratory events like coughs and sneezes represent an important route for the spread of respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. We use finely resolved experiments and simulations to quantify how the turbulent cloud of moist air exhaled during a sneeze largely increases the airborne time and the lifespan of virus-loaded droplets. By providing visualizations of the spatial distribution of the virus copies, we highlight the high infection risk associated with droplets that remain airborne in the near proximity of an infected individual. The present study aims at raising awareness among public health authorities about this infection risk, which is grossly underestimated by current guidelines.  
  
Abstract  
After the Spanish flu pandemic, it was apparent that airborne transmission was crucial to spreading virus contagion, and research responded by producing several fundamental works like the experiments of Duguid \[J. P. Duguid, J. Hyg. 44, 6 (1946)\] and the model of Wells \[W. F. Wells, Am. J. Hyg. 20, 611–618 (1934)\]. These seminal works have been pillars of past and current guidelines published by health organizations. However, in about one century, understanding of turbulent aerosol transport by jets and plumes has enormously progressed, and it is now time to use this body of developed knowledge. In this work, we use detailed experiments and accurate computationally intensive numerical simulations of droplet-laden turbulent puffs emitted during sneezes in a wide range of environmental conditions. We consider the same emission—number of drops, drop size distribution, and initial velocity—and we change environmental parameters such as temperature and humidity, and we observe strong variation in droplets’ evaporation or condensation in accordance with their local temperature and humidity microenvironment. We assume that 3% of the initial droplet volume is made of nonvolatile matter. Our systematic analysis confirms that droplets’ lifetime is always about one order of magnitude larger compared to previous predictions, in some cases up to 200 times. Finally, we have been able to produce original virus exposure maps, which can be a useful instrument for health scientists and practitioners to calibrate new guidelines to prevent short-range airborne disease transmission.",,,,1630500819,{},hb6jlyx,True,t3_pft9mk,False,False,t3_pft9mk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pft9mk/shortrange_exposure_to_airborne_virus/hb6jlyx/,1630579567.0,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The criticism is not about the effectiveness of the strategy in itself - most people are intelligent enough to understand that if you lock down early and hard, cases are gonna drop at some point. That's pretty obvious. 

The real criticism is about how sustainable and manageable this strategy actually is, and whether there are better alternatives *right now*. Not last year.

The problem is, now this has devolved into some sort of contest between anti-lockdown weirdos waiting for cases to get out of control to say ""I told you so"" and defensive Kiwis repeating how the country has been so successful so far and waiting for cases to go down to zero to get all smug and cocky.

In essence, the argument was that they did not have the right to try a potentially life-saving medication.

&gt;In each of the three cases, the New York State Supreme Court Justices sided with the patient, and in each of the three cases, the patients made near-miraculous recoveries after the Ivermectin was given. In each case, these patients were in the Intensive Care Unit on ventilators, unable to breathe on their own, and universally, after the drug was given, they rapidly improved and were able to breathe on their own.

Mask mandates were dropped, case numbers were incredibly low, and places were opening back up.  And then Delta shows up.  Other states literally ban preventative measures.  A wide swath of the population refuses to vaccinate and instead believes the kookiest of conspiracies.  Now it's back to isolation.

Part of the problem is that science takes a long time to reach conclusions yet we are seeing conclusions made based on one data point. Case in point: the Provincetown study reported in MMWR which concluded that vaccinated people have the same high viral RNA loads as unvaccinated people. This is meaningless without measuring viral infectivity. It turns out that a subsequent study in Singapore revealed that while viral RNA loads in vaccinated people are initially high, they decline more rapidly than in nonimmune people. To me this means that vaccinated people are not likely to be shedding much infectious virus and are probably not transmitting. Yet the press concludes that vaccines don't work. The other issue I have is that the press is widely claiming that vaccine effectiveness is declining. Whenever you talk about vaccine effectiveness, you have to specify what you are talking about. All COVID? Asymptomatic? Mild? Moderate? Severe? Death? It is true that the ability of vaccines to block infection has waned, but that happens will all vaccines as you move 8 months past the shot. What the vaccines still do is prevent severe disease and death. The press ignores this and paints a picture of doom. They ignore the science and part of the problem is that they listen to people who should know better. For example, the Guardian ran a story yesterday quoting the head of Oxford vaccines saying herd immunity doesn't exist because vaccinated people will transmit delta variant. There is zero evidence for that statement and I think he is basing it on the high viral RNA loads observed in vaccinated patients which do not indicate that they are shedding infectious virus and transmitting it.

Desantis graduated from Yale and Harvard with honors.  He's not stupid.  He's intentionally created an environment where public schools are crippled in their covid response while private schools (so far) are not (1)(2).  Combine that with his statements that the Democrats and immigrants are to blame for covid(3) and now his willingness to disregard the judicial branch and it's becoming a lot harder to see his actions as someone who believes in fair government.  What's worse imho is that he's blowing it all up from the inside while using those failures to further erode public trust.  I'm open to alternative interpretations if you think I'm overstating it.

[],,Stumposaurus_Rex,,,[],,,,text,t2_kwfr6,False,False,[],"A really interesting study that relates to mask usage, COVID-19, and ventilation: [https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0057100](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0057100)

It's a technical read, but some snippets from the conclusion:

*(i)considerable relative aerosol concentration levels can be reached at a 2 m distance from the subject in an unventilated space, and even when the subject is equipped with a mask, the relative concentrations are notably higher than those expected based on the ideal/rated efficiency of the masks; (ii) fit of the mask to the face, in terms of limiting leakage around the mask perimeter, is critical for limiting aerosol dispersion in an unventilated space, especially for high efficiency masks (e.g., N95/KN95); and (iii) increased ventilation/air-cleaning capacity significantly reduces the transmission risk in an indoor environment, surpassing the apparent mask filtration efficacy even at relatively low air-change rates (∼2 room volumes per hour).*

I've harped before on ventilation as key metric instead of trusting any and every mask as a shield. This study seems to back up how critical mask fitting/filtration is, as in a poorly ventilated environment you aren't getting *nearly* the protection you think if your mask is a floppy mess.

I feel like this isn't getting nearly the airtime and buzz that the school mask usage/mandates get. Sure, mask up, but start pumping out smaller KN95 level masks to schoolkids and put some money into renovating school HVAC systems if you *actually* want to tackle the problem of school transmission instead of expecting every ill fitting cloth spiderman mask a kid is wearing for hours on end in a dilapidated and poorly ventilated school to be a legitimate form of protection.

There seems to be a tendency to say ""well it's better than nothing!"" and stop looking further into the matter.

Case in point, in Israel, about 3 months ago, we had almost no cases. I think I even recall a day with literally 0 cases (might be wrong). The overwhelming eligible majority were vaxxed. But then we had a couple of cases in schools. I was very angry with our health department for not recommending the vaccination for 12-15 year olds back then, which they of course did recommend after those cases. Soon after, though, it wouldn't have mattered either way - we got many more cases from the Delta variant from people traveling abroad, and now we've the highest case numbers we ever had (although, not as high as our peak deaths and serious cases rate thankfully).

Yesterday I got my 3rd shot. Most people are getting them. Our officials are saying we'll see a reduction of serious cases in a short while. Let's assume they're right... What happens after a couple more months or another variant?

I'm thinking at this point that even with peak obedience and peak vaccination, you'll get almost zero cases, and then some random breakthroughs, and then it all starts over again. The only way it doesn't is if people stay at home for a month straight, **in the whole world simultaneously**. Anything else -&gt; back to where we are after a while, albeit with hopefully less serious cases due to the vaccines.

Maybe it's time to stop badgering whoever's not acting according to some standards or others, and badgering instead our governments for better health care and more ICU beds? Because it's here to stay.

However, here is the thing that confuses me:

I live in Tompkins County, NY, where more than 70% of the adult population were fully vaccinated by the end of May. Active covid cases sharply fell from over 200 cases to single digits within the span of a month. During that time, we only had about 2-6 positive covid tests per week, up until around the first week of August when cases started climbing back up again. Over the past two weeks, undergraduates have been returning to the Cornell campus. In order to attend Cornell in-person, you have to be fully vaccinated (you also have to wear masks inside all buildings). In the last week, we have shattered many previous records: we currently have the highest number of active cases than at any other point in the pandemic, and our new single-day record for positive results has more than doubled. Cornell keeps their own independent covid tallies and these same records have been broken for them as well.

Since everyone at Cornell is presumably vaccinated, and since we have such a high vaccination rate in the county overall, it is hard for me to reconcile these observations with the idea that vaccinated individuals cannot transmit the virus to other vaccinated individuals. I realize that these observations, and speculation, do not have the equivalency of evidence that would come from peer-reviewed studies. I guess, I just wanted to describe this situation as it is unfolding, because the numbers seem to indicate that transmission is occurring among fully vaccinated people.",,,,1630518719,{},hb7pvkn,False,t3_pfa3va,False,False,t1_hb6zixk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pfa3va/im_dr_vincent_racaniello_a_virology_professor_at/hb7pvkn/,1630603114.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because it doesn't actually deserve an acknowledgement.

Whether or not you get some immunity from previously having Covid (everybody's immunity is different), why would anyone that has two brain cells to rub together, not want to ""seal the deal"" by getting a vaccine? 

It is also impossible to know when that natural immunity will fail and it is too late because it's a much harder thing to study considering all the differences in individuals and ""what kind"" of Covid they had.  Whereas vaccines are under continued study and at some point (earlier than you would know from previous infection) guidelines for boosters will be put in place for when, on average, that immunity starts to wane.

Also, you know that every moron who has had the sniffles in the past year will just say ""I've had Covid! I don't need a vaccine!"" and then this whole thing just never goes away.

All of Earth’s cultures are able to freely communicate with one another through the internet. And high speed travel lets us intermingle in ways that haven’t been possible in the previous centuries of human life. 

That creates excitement and love for each other in some, and fear and hate in others. Also lots of us want to progress into new technologies and ways of life, these people are progressive. Others want to conserve their old way of life, those people are conservative. 

The two are bound to clash, but progress will win and new tech like mRNA vaccines, CRISPR, nanotech, biotech, robotics, quantum computers, AI etc will eventually lead to even better tech that will allow immortality and interstellar travel.  

Those who wish to progress will partake in those technologies and live on in a more Star Trek-like world. Those who wish to conserve the old way of life will simply fade away. But there will be several decades of conflict between now and then. 

You can at least revel in the fact that we have self opening doors and tricorders already haha. It looks like we’re also well on our way to curing most diseases and extending our lifespans.

From Financial Times: [One in seven older children who test positive go on to have long Covid, study suggests](https://www.ft.com/content/31c30156-e446-469a-86d6-a1b93ccf91a0)  
  
(Note: It's a live-feed which lacks direct links.  You'll have to ctrl+f for the title, sorry.)  
   
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;The CLoCk study, funded by the National Institute for Health Research and **UK** Research and Innovation, **compared survey data from about 3,000 people aged 11 to 17 who tested positive for Covid-19 in England between January and March this year and 3,700 children who tested negative.**  
&gt;  
&gt;The study’s findings suggest that long Covid was the likely cause of **one in seven children who had tested positive experiencing three or more symptoms 15 weeks after infection. One in 14 children reported five or more symptoms.** 
&gt;
&gt;The data suggest that over seven months between September 2020 and March 2021 at least 4,000 and possibly 32,000 teenagers in England may have had multiple symptoms tied to Covid-19 infection after 15 weeks.  
  
Combine with this, from [WaPo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/08/28/delta-variant-unvaccinated-children-elementary-schools/):  
  
&gt;A CDC-funded simulation projects that without masking or testing, more than 75 percent of children could be infected within three months.  
  
From [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/457786/number-of-children-in-the-us-by-age/), in the US, there's 25m 12 to 17 year olds.  
  
Napkin Math:  
  
25 * m * 0.75 * (1/7) = 2.6m  
  
If we screw up masking (and related) hard enough, that's up to 2.6m teenagers with long-covid.  And I still haven't seen long-covid really sorted out.

I keep seeing this a lot, but the truth of the matter is more nuanced -- yes, you *can* still get infected and spread covid, but a lot of mitigating factors come into play.  If you're vaccinated, you're *far* less likely to catch covid and develop a breakthrough infection, and if you do, that breakthrough infection is much more likely to be a mild case that doesn't last as long.   

The hope is that once everyone is vaccinated, covid won't immediately disappear but it will dwindle as it just doesn't have the strength to take hold in new communities and spread like wildfire.

Sorry, I don't mean to point this in your direction - It seems like you get this already.

Pre covid, my little family were foodies. We ate out several times a week, just the 3 of us, exploring new food experiences or returning to favorite haunts.
The moment it was decided things were serious enough to mandate masks (though the virus hasn’t reached my area yet, it’s just close enough that it’s only a matter of time) we stopped eating out. Simple.
We figured if it’s that close and masks are now a protective measure then why choose activities that require mask removal (when it was still an exception to remove a mask). It’s not hard to simply plan differently and not eat out.
Meanwhile, in that little window of time when our only mandate was masks, so many people were trying to invite me out to eat, or go to the movies (another place masks were allowed to be removed). I’ve never felt so popular! We only get invited to special events on occasion, suddenly we had several invites a week to eat out for no apparent reason.
I strongly feel these people, possibly as a subconscious rebellion, we’re looking for activities that provided an excuse to be maskless in public because their normal behaviour changed.
Similar to when the pandemic first started and we had our first problem here, the Ruby Princess debacle. I can’t remember the last time we hosted guests and I don’t really socialise. Suddenly I had people from all over Australia asking to come visit me, not after things settle down, they were eager to move around the moment the virus became a problem. It was so strange to be batting away requests to travel to visit us right then and out of the blue. They were not trying to flee outbreaks either, if anything, visiting us brought them right to the Victorian border, the state that has battled the longest and most frequent outbreaks.
This is why we need draconian rules, because everyone started behaving differently, suddenly desperate to do the things that we were advised to limit, because in the early days, it was all only advice. They only became rules when everyone decided to change their behaviours just to go against advice and it was contributing to spread we were not equipped to manage.",,,,1630527590,{},hb8bn8q,False,t3_pfqlss,False,False,t1_hb7h0hi,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pfqlss/melbourne_lockdown_to_continue_until_vaccination/hb8bn8q/,1630615382.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Effectiveness of Inactivated COVID-19 Vaccines Against COVID-19 Pneumonia and Severe Illness Caused by the B.1.617.2 (Delta) Variant: Evidence from an Outbreak in Guangdong, China

Findings: Unadjusted and adjusted VE of full vaccination against pneumonia were 77·7% (95% CI 45·1–90·9) and 69·5% (95% CI 42·8–96·3), respectively. Full vaccination was 100% effective against severe illness. Unadjusted and adjusted VE of partial vaccination against pneumonia were 1·4% (95% CI -79·7–45·9) and 8·4% (95% CI -47·6–64·4). Interpretation Full vaccination with inactivated vaccines is effective against pneumonia, severe, and critical illness caused by the B.1.617.2 variant. Effort should be placed to ensure full vaccination of target populations.

It's hard not to when you're a perfect example of the stereotype. 

Ignorance isn't just an ""opposing viewpoint"", it's a dangerous willful arrogance that you, a random nobody, knows more about a specific subject from other random quacks online than people who have dedicated their lives to figuring out the stuff you just blow off without substantial evidence or demonstable understanding.

&gt;Not that facts matter anymore

Funny you say that after touting the ""vaccines don't stop spread or infection 100%, so they're totally useless"" dumbassery.

&gt;you've all clearly made up your mind and are continuing to be useful idiots for the elite (who couldn't give two shits about masks or social distancing in their own lives, btw).

Yeah, so this BS combined with your incoherent ranting about ""freedoms"", ""tyrannical surveillance state"" and ""social credit scores"" doesn't do you any favors.

Long covid had some biological similarities to ME/CFS. Hopefully this will lead to treatments.

In this review, we summarize the evidence that people with acute COVID-19 and with ME/CFS have biological abnormalities including redox imbalance, systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation, an impaired ability to generate adenosine triphosphate, and a general hypometabolic state. These phenomena have not yet been well studied in people with long COVID-19, and each of them has been reported in other diseases as well, particularly neurological diseases. We also examine the bidirectional relationship between redox imbalance, inflammation, energy metabolic deficits, and a hypometabolic state. We speculate as to what may be causing these abnormalities. Thus, understanding the molecular underpinnings of both PASC and ME/CFS may lead to the development of novel therapeutics.

So, the decision doesn’t necessarily support the idea that vaccination can be legally compelled.

Second, the Court explicitly said there was no evidence that the smallpox vaccines were dangerous or didn’t work. At that time, smallpox vaccines had been around for a hundred years and had been shown to be relatively safe and effective. Had there been questions about the safety or efficacy of the smallpox vaccine in 1905, the Justices may have thought differently.

Last fall we were all (well mostly all) diligently wearing masks, practicing good hand hygiene, social distancing and many students were not in the classroom.  Despite these efforts we saw a surge of COVID cases that started trending upward (nationwide) in October.  What we didn’t really see were a lot of cases of RSV in children or cases of flu in both adults and children. The picture looks very different this fall.  Kids are back in schools, mask mandates are sparse, social distancing has also sort of fallen by the wayside, but we’ve got vaccines (at least some of us).  I expect we will see our COVID numbers behave much the same as the United Kingdom, a decrease after the July surge, but then sort of plateau at a much higher baseline. And then there’s RSV, which decided to come out of left field and have a summer wave in children - which almost never happens.  I know the CDC has been known to do “flu forecasting”, but I haven’t found any numbers for this year.  What do you think the fall looks like for all of these respiratory viruses, not just COVID?  Is RSV just going to hang out and cause problems all through autumn?  Are we going to see a big surge of influenza in adults and/or children as we saw with RSV over the summer?  To me at least, this seems like it could be a mixed bag of *bad*.    

Also, I have a 3 year old who obviously won't be able to be vaccinated for some time.  I recently read a study (University of Miami) that suggested the flu vaccine offers some protection against COVID.

She’s also charged with falsely entering at least 10 people into New York state’s vaccine database for an additional $250, data which was transferred to New York state’s official Excelsior pass system.  
Clifford, who also went by the handle u/5starjazziiii and had more than 300,000 followers, is facing charges of criminal possession of a forged instrument in the second degree, offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree, and conspiracy in the fifth degree.

And it’s certainly not the vaccinated people under 30, or he’ll even under 50. That has become abundantly clear, but the youth are suffering. Kids in and out of school, college experiences not happening, people like me in our thirties that have been victim to one crisis after another after another. Earning power for millennials has been down since we started, graduating in the 2008 crash. Homes are unaffordable and college debt has dragged us down since day one. What’s it going to be like for the next generation? Mental health is already at an all-time low.

The solution is getting to be worse than the problem. Every adult in this country has access to a vaccine. We already lost so much to protect the old and the sick and the weak, and then the vaccines came out better than anyone ever expected.

We can’t sacrifice our youth to protect the unwilling. This is now almost exclusively a pandemic of the unvaccinated.

And yes, young kids should have had vaccine approval by now, but luckily they are mostly very unaffected - but still the sooner they can get vaxxed the better. 

Covid is never going away, and the sooner we accept that as a whole, the sooner we can all get our lives back. Life has risk. It always has. People die tragically of so many things.

&gt;Jasmine Clifford, 31, of Lyndhurst, NJ allegedly dealt 250 forged cards through her Instagram account, and employed Nadayza Barkley, 27, of Bellport, Long Island to fraudulently enter phony vaccine data for at least 10 individuals on the state immunization database, according to Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance Jr.

&gt;Clifford and Barkley were charged on Aug. 31 in Manhattan Criminal Court along with 13 individuals who purchased the phony cards. Vance pointed out that many of those accused of buying the fake vaccination cards are front line healthcare workers, including some employed in hospitals or nursing homes.

&gt;Peddling fake COVID-19 cards online has become something of a dangerous cottage industry complicating the country’s efforts to end the pandemic. Earlier this month, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called for greater federal action to take down the online dealers who cater to vaccine-hesitant individuals or anti-vaxxers who may buy the cards in an effort to get around private business or government vaccination mandates.

&gt;“We need companies like Facebook to take action to prevent the fraud happening on their platforms,” Vance said in a statement Tuesday. “Making, selling and purchasing forged vaccination cards are serious crimes with serious public safety consequences.”

&gt;According to the criminal complaint, Clifford — who went by her Instagram handle @AntiVaxMomma (the account has since been deleted) — allegedly began selling the forged cards through her Instagram account in May of this year.

&gt;Typically, prosecutors said, she peddled the phony documents to buyers for $200 a piece, accepting payments through CashApp or Zelle. For an extra $50, she offered customers to have their information fraudulently entered in the state’s immunization database.

&gt;For that part of the scheme, the criminal complaint noted, Clifford allegedly enlisted the services of Barkley, who works at a medical clinic in Patchogue, Long Island. Barkley allegedly entered information into the database fraudulently for no fewer than 10 of Clifford’s customers.

&gt;Clifford and Barkley were each charged with first-degree offering a false instrument for filing and fifth-degree conspiracy. Clifford was additionally charged with second-degree criminal possession of a forged instrument.

&gt;If convicted, Clifford faces up to 7 years in prison, while Barkley faces up to 4 years behind bars.

&gt;Additionally, the 13 fake card buyers charged on Tuesday were booked on a count of second-degree criminal possession of a forged instrument, and also face up to 7 years in prison if convicted.

&gt;Vance urged anyone who knows of individuals selling fake COVID-19 vaccination cards to contact his office’s Financial Frauds Bureau at 212-335-8900.",,,,1630457773,{},hb4om6e,True,t3_pfixv8,False,False,t3_pfixv8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pfixv8/online_antivax_momma_sold_fake_covid19_vaccine/hb4om6e/,1630545702.0,24,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study is looking at protection provided against the Delta variant, where the previous infection was the Alpha variant or earlier. Of course the vaccine was targeting an even earlier variant, though nobody was talking about variants back then.

Second, there will be wars fought over food and water due to unsustainable food practices that will eventually kill our land and ability to harvest food. This will drive up food prices as farmable land becomes scarce. As well as our freshwater situation will become dire at the end of our lifetimes. The West of the USA is facing the worst drought in our lifetime now. Climate change is here and is here to stay. Things supposed to happen in 2030 are happening already.

In your opinion. Why are you quoting all these stats on vaccine efficacy and hospitalization/death, when I made it very clear my issue was with long covid?

&gt; Those who are concerned about waning vaccine efficacy against infection have some options such as avoiding public places, maintaining a healthy body weight, or getting a booster when available.

Right, but that's just not satisfactory, with the exception of boosters, which we are still waiting for. My point is the pre-Delta version of the world, with a 95% vaccine efficacy against infection, was, IMO, a reasonable place to ""resume normal life."" What we have now is not. We can get there again, it's just not on a timeline that many people like.

&gt; Sure, I'm interested in seeing that.

1. JJ has been looking at two doses prior to delta. It should have been published already but i believe they had difficulty finding participants that weren't  vaccinated, exposed, and willing to take a vaccine. 

2. This study really doesnt say anything. Its too small and localized (not powered) and doesnt give the right info. ( what is the magic number of antibodies in a person to be effective against infection/hospital/death)

3. Acip just said how they dont think theres enough info for boosters.  They pushed for maybe doing risk based boosters (65+ immunocompromised)  since thats whos getting hospitizations 

4. The key to look at this is hospitalizations and death.   Unvaccinated is like 95% of the cause. The others are really the ones i mentioned above. If JJ was 50% effective  then you'd see hospitalizations higher and unvaccinated being like 85% of the cause. Same for if pfizer was ineffective, except there were more pfizer doses given so they would account for more hospitalizations.   Now this is also all a little mixed because pfizer went heavily into 65+ last dec and JJ came in late and really geared toward younger healthier anyway.

5.  You'll need a booster eventually, probably. Maybe. 
Probably.

6.  There is some increased risk with JJ.

The main take-aways:

1. The researchers randomized entire villages to either be placebo or to get a strong community-wide pro-mask campaign

2. The villages with masking campaigns reduced COVID incidence by about 9%, but, for the elderly (and more vulnerable) population, the reduction was around 30%.  This would be a good sized reduction in mortality.  Note that ""elderly"" is defined as 55+, because in Bangladesh, you don't have many 80+ individuals.

3. Villages where surgical masks were promoted did better than villages where they were not (i.e., likely more cloth masks in the other villages), and needed only about 30% of people wearing masks to see the effect.

4. Masks aren't sufficient by themselves.  With COVID being so contagious, you'll still have significant spread even if you knock 50% off of R0.  You need masks combined with other interventions (distancing, immunity).

5. The discussion about ""playing for time"" using masks is interesting.  You can make the argument that masks may slow down disease spread, but doesn't reduce overall mortality from the disease by much, if everyone is going to wind up catching it.  *But we now live in a world where we have mRNA tech for vaccines.*  Keeping a lot of people from getting infected may buy you a lot because you can get to vaccinations.  ""[So this study makes me inclined to have a teeny tiny bit of forgiveness for the folks at CDC who were all 'Boo masks don't work Asians are silly!' yes they were wrong, but these effect sizes are small enough that *if rapid vax development wasn't an option*, it'd be hard](https://twitter.com/lymanstoneky/status/1433062313284755458) to imagine masking having an effect on cumulative mortality by the end of the epidemic.""",,,,1630509383,{},hb72xru,True,t3_pfvt01,False,True,t3_pfvt01,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pfvt01/study_of_promasking_campaign_in_randomly_selected/hb72xru/,1630589892.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stage 8 is basically: after 6-8 weeks in a coma you can leave the ICU and be transferred to a normal ward in the hospital for another 8 weeks.

After that rehab starts.
At this point you have been away from home for 4 months at least, have lost tons of weight (mostly muscle mass), sit in a wheelchair and are so weak that you cannot even stand up on your own.

If your lungs are really fucked up you even require oxygen just to be able to sit upright.

Then it takes 1-2 weeks to be able to stand up again.

People have also been helped to conduct quick tests at home. Large-scale testing in red and orange zones over the past week detected 4,800 cases daily, accounting for 3.8 per cent of the total samples in those zones during the period.  
  
Nguyễn Văn Nên, secretary of the Party Committee, said the 3.8 per cent rate found in high-risk areas after mass testing was “within the city’s capacity to handle”.  
  
Treatment  
  
Dr. Tăng Chí Thượng, director of the city Department of Health, said the health sector was prepared for an increase in cases through mass testing.   
  
Treatment has improved as patients have been classified depending on their symptoms. Patients can be treated at home, at isolation areas in districts, or at field hospitals or health facilities.   
  
As many as 413 mobile medical stations led by a team of military doctors are offering treatment for patients, especially those at home. “The number of stations will be adjusted depending on the number of cases at home.”   
  
The health sector has used remdesivir, the first antiviral drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat COVID-19. It has the ability to shorten treatment times and speed up recovery of critically ill patients.   
  
In addition, the health sector will add the anti-viral drug molnupiravir for treating mild symptoms, but its usage will be carefully monitored by medical staff, according to Thượng.  
  
Deputy Minister of Health Nguyễn Trường Sơn said that large-scale testing has helped districts better understand the pandemic situation in each district.  
  
“I expect the number of cases will continue to rise in the coming days before it begins dropping gradually thanks to mass testing in high-risk areas during the lockdown.”   
  
Oxygen supply 

The Ministry of Health said HCM City’s COVID hospitals and health facilities should ensure oxygen supply to cope with new cases and critically ill patients.   
  
The ministry requires hospitals such as district-level and level-2 hospitals to have at least two central oxygen systems and sufficient equipment and human resources to perform high-flow oxygen therapy via the high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) technique.  
  
At general hospitals level-1 and higher, intensive care units must have at least 50 beds each and be ready to expand to 100 beds with a central oxygen system.  
  
The city Department of Information and Communications recently launched the phone app Oxygen 247 to help COVID patients and health officials contact hospitals that have empty beds with oxygen cylinders and ventilators.  
  
The Department of Health and the city’s Steering Committee for COVID-19 Prevention and Control can dispatch oxygen cylinders to hospitals facing a shortage.  
  
The app is available on IOS and Android platforms. Its database is connected with the Department of Health’s management system which is updated frequently.    
  
Oxygen production facilities in Việt Nam can make 1,300 tonnes a day and double their capacity if needed, according to the ministry.  
  
Food supply  
  
Speaking at a meeting on Tuesday (August 31), Deputy Prime Minister Vũ Đức Đam urged HCM City to hire freight forwarders to package and deliver food and essential items to people in need.  
  
People who have recovered from COVID-19 (who have immunity to the disease) and are in good health will be paid if they offer assistance with the work, he added.  
  
Tô Thị Bích Châu, chairwoman of the Vietnam Fatherland Front Committee of HCM City, said the city has an abundance of food and vegetables from sponsors to support people in need, but it lacks a sufficient number of people for packaging, distribution and transportation.  
  
“A number of frontline officers in communes and wards have been infected with COVID-19,” she said.   
  
The city’s goal is to bring the outbreak under control by September 15.  
  
As of Tuesday (August 31), the city was treating more than 40,130 patients at medical facilities, including 2,449 aged under 16. As many as 2,736 people are critically ill and on ventilators, and 16 require ECMO intervention. Another 20,604 are being treated at isolation facilities in various districts.  
  
Of 83,643 people being treated at home, 24,050 have recovered and will remain isolated for another two weeks.  
  
The number of new infections in the country since the fourth wave that began in late April has topped 458,000, with HCM City accounting for more than 221,200. — VNS",,,,1630513250,{},hb7ceib,True,t3_pfx9so,False,True,t3_pfx9so,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pfx9so/vietnam_city_to_speed_up_mass_testing_ensure/hb7ceib/,1630595351.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Desantis banned public schools from instituting mask mandates. Some school districts decided to ignore that ban, and lawsuits ended up in front of the Supreme Court of Florida. That court ruled that the ban was unconstitutional, but desantis decided to continue enforcing the ban anyways. The reason he did so is to prompt the United States military to intervene **against** him, and uphold the decision of the court.

So, to start with, I think it is a wild leap to assume the military would even be tempted to intervene in a local power dispute between the branches of a state government. Why on earth would they do that, when there is even precedent for the **federal** executive branch ignoring the US Supreme Court going back centuries? That just doesn’t make sense.

Second, it’s also very difficult to see **how** that would benefit desantis, who would be on the opposite side of the military. If you’re thinking the military would intervene on desantis’s side, I don’t think that makes sense either. Desantis already has the power to ignore the court. As I mentioned, there is already precedent that such a thing is allowable, and he is already doing so. Why would the military **need** to intervene to uphold the status quo, when the court has no mechanism by which to enforce their decision?

Now, if your point is that desantis is not fundamentally a small “l” liberal or a small “d” democrat, I don’t disagree. I doubt he is fundamentally opposed to a dictatorship, but thats a very different claim than saying he is doing this particular action to facilitate such a dictatorship. In this case, I don’t think you need any sort of covert explanation for his actions. He’s ignoring the court, because they are opposing the policy he put forward and he doesn’t want that. I don’t see why that isn’t enough to explain what he’s doing. The idea that this is some 4D chess move to get himself install as a dictator seems like an enormous stretch.",,,,1630516695,{},hb7kwnj,False,t3_pfc8oq,False,True,t1_hb7f5tr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pfc8oq/despite_courts_decision_florida_withholds_school/hb7kwnj/,1630600310.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of my dearest friend’s mom passed away this month last year, she was an active mid age lady who I considered as my mom. She reached stage 2 as per OP’s explanation, and doctors asked my friend if they should pull the plug and let her rest or put her on a ventilator tube through a hole in her throat. it’s such a hard thing to think about and remember the horrors, but at this moment I hope my friend does not come across this information, it would make her feel awful that there could’ve been other things done before it was too late.

Get vaccinated people, it’s literally two little pricks like a baby’s pinch on your arm, you might get tired and your arm where you got the jab might be soar for a day or two, but that’s it. that’s literally all it takes to have antibodies that will protect you from being in such horrific situation. 

Some of the most common fears include drowning, imagine drowning from your own body fluids building up in your lungs because you refuse to be vaccinated.

It’s not a big deal, you don’t need an agenda or a political opinion or religion or anything else that tells you to take it or not take it, do it for yourself, don’t believe the people who are against it, facebook and internet in general is a place full of anonymous people who have been doing some great and horrible shit too. There is a balance to everything and that is just normal, take a second and think about it, is it worth going the extra mile to spread false information and fight everyone because you believe some con artist or a troll who literally gains nothing but satisfaction in seeing people believe their shit and they are laughing behind your backs but acting like they’re by your side, or just getting up and literally ignore every living soul, every opinion you heard, every lie, and just do it for yourself if not for others. Go get up and get vaccinated, I and my entire family with ages varying from 16 up to 85 years old (multiple generations) have taken both the doses, we didn’t die, nobody is tracking us and even if they are, why would they be tracking a mid class family that has no political opinion or connections, no effect in the market, no illegal activity or anything that is worth tracking, we are healthy and we wear masks on top of the vax as a consideration and also another layer of protection. 

You could get sick from breathing in the wrong time at the wrong place, it’s that easy, it’s also as easy to get vaccinated and go on your entire life knowing you did the right thing even though you were so against it, and you open up a whole new level of self respect and discover so much potential in yourself for opening up and changing your attitude, you’ll understand more and more things as you progress and you’ll be ever so grateful to yourself, no more anger or fighting or protesting or anything, you are just a normal human who did it for themselves and that’s literally all that matters, you and me and everyone else being safe.

We even took a small family trip upstate to a cabin to hike at a state park. We still wore our masks whenever we were indoors. My toddler wore his mask perfectly even up to an hour in the museum. We went to places early when no one was there. We ate our lunch in the car or outside away from others. A new normal but we enjoyed it soo much.

My son wants to go to “school” soo bad. He brings toys to the park to play with friends but we keep our distance from people. I miss my in laws. They refuse to be vaccinated so we haven’t since them in a year. They will miss my sons 3rd birthday coming up. They missed the 2nd. I don’t feel hopeful for thanksgiving or Christmas either.

&gt;Visitors to Hawaii are required to quarantine after arriving unless they have uploaded valid COVID-19 vaccine cards under the state’s Safe Travels program.

&gt;The woman arrived on Aug. 23 and authorities began an investigation after an administrator with the program tipped them off about the misspelling, KHON reported.

&gt;“That’s one indication, as well as other things that in the card they thought it was suspicious and as part of being suspicious they did an excellent job of notifying us,” Special Agent William Lau of the attorney general’s office told the station.

&gt;The woman also had no reservation at the hotel listed on her travel forms and did not list her return flight, KHON reported.

&gt;Investigators discovered that Delaware, listed on the vaccine card, had no record of the woman being vaccinated, Hawaii News Now reported.

&gt;Officers tracked her down and arrested her Sunday at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport as she arrived for her flight home, KITV reported. She’s being held on $2,000 bail.

&gt;The woman told officers she had been vaccinated by her doctor, Hawaii News Now reported. She was traveling with another woman, who was not arrested.

Maybe?  So this study only uses vaccinated people (or single dose) but it is unclear to me whether the covid infections all occurred post-vaccination.  Given the Dec-Apr time frame, that seems like it would be impossible as the UK had only hit that ~30mil in April.

Given the concern around these events particularly with the AstraZeneca (that and Pfizer were the only two looked at given that is the vast majority in the UK)., I think this was just, designed to show, regardless of vaccination status when infected, the covid infection itself comes with a much higher risk for these events than the vaccination.

I wonder if your ""at higher risk"" was what irked someone.  The natural question is at higher risk vs. what?

With restrictions coming into play it could drag out into the winter. When we pseudo locked down for the holidays last year for a similar amount of cases it took 2 months to come back down to the same level and then months more to drop down to a reasonable amount. We're seeing mask mandates and vaccine passports crop up again so it's not really infinite growth except in certain states.

&gt;although I suppose delta can re-infect right? So those who get lucky the first time could in theory catch it later, if with a delay?

Possibly. I would guess it's unlikely to re-infect those who already had delta. But breakthrough cases from vaccines and earlier strains could continue to spread until our vaccination rate gets close to the \~80% it's probably going to top out at.

If you get exposed to 5 viral bodies, one two three four five, then even without vaccination, odds are you're going to fight it off without ever realizing it was there.

If you get exposed to 5 million, without vaccination, you're going to have a bad time.

If you get exposed to 5 million WITH vaccination, you might be asymptomatic or you might have some mild symptoms.  VERY rarely you will need hospitalization but you'll still have better outcomes than someone who did not get the vaccine.

If you get exposed to 500 million, even with the vaccine it's likely you will develop symptoms.

these numbers are fudged obviously but you see where I'm going with this.

the vaccine is not a force field, not an invisible shield that protects us 100% and makes us utterly impervious.

It just adds a resistance modifier to the formula.

That resistance can still be overcome with enough exposure.

My friend's stepdad works as a perfusionist, he's basically the guy who hooks covid patients up to ECMO as a last resort.  Consequently, his patients are the sickest covid patients of all.  And that means they have the highest viral load and are the most contagious.

My friend's stepdad volunteered for extra shifts so the rest of the team could reduce their exposure.  Even with PPE you still get exposed, it's not a moon suit.

My friend's stepdad ended up hospitalized for covid (he is vaccinated), and is currently at home on oxygen but his SpO2 is hovering 85-90%.

If he makes it, he will have longterm damage.  Without a doubt.

As far as I'm concerned he's a hero but the system certainly isn't treating him like it.  He is on short term disability but the jury is still out on whether the long term will kick in, etc, etc, etc.

Now granted, his case is very much an edge case that doesn't apply to the rest of us.

But all of this is to illustrate that just because you have the vaccine that doesn't mean it's a wise idea to party it up in crowded indoor bars with no masks and no ventilation.

Is that about right? Has anyone seen similar numbers?

Sources:
This CDC web site tracks data from about 10% of the US population. It's weekly data. So in the US, about 10x these numbers are hospitalized per week-- that makes it about 350 kids 0-4 hospitalized per week, and 570 kids 5-17 hospitalized per week. For COVID19.
https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/COVIDNet/COVID19_5.html

There are 19.7 million kids 0-4.
There are 53.3 million kids 5-17.
https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2019/demo/age-and-sex/2019-age-sex-composition.html

If 65% are fully vaccinated with a 94% effective rate then 6% of that 65% are vulnerable, or, 3.9% of that group. 

For the 7% who are at an 80% effective rate, 20% are vulnerable to getting infected, or 14% of that group.

Then there are the 28% of the rest of the population that has a chance to get infected. 

Maine has a population of 1.344 million people. 

1,344,000 * .65 * .039 = population * vaccination rate * vulnerability percentage = 34,070 people vulnerable to infection. 

1.344m * .07 * .14 = 13,171 people. 

The unvaccinated: 376,320 people. 

So roughly 423,561 people vulnerable to the virus. With a 2.5% case fatality rate:
10,589 people would die if those numbers did not change. 

The projection is that some 2,000 people in Maine will die between now and December 1st. This is lower than my math because of other factors, namely the protection of the vaccines and the use of masks lowering the rate of infection -- and because I'm not an epidemiologist, and my math is incredibly simplistic here.

In any and all cases, I am not entirely sure being « irked » by a question is an acceptable reason to ban the person who asks it.

Well, I'm reading tea leaves at this point because I can't see into someone else's brain... but I think that phrasing right there is it.
Yes, technically, a single jab or fully vaxx'ed person that has a breakthrough infections has both risks; the much smaller risk of these events from the jab(s) + the risk from covid itself.  What that phrasing doesn't capture is what is the risk for the entirely unvaccinated person?  Obviously they avoid the smaller risk from the jab itself.. but then they have a greater risk of getting covid and greater risk of more severe illness.  And with that might very well come these same events, perhaps either directly from covid infection or indirectly from longer term hospital care.  So while yes, you get both risks as the vaccinated and infected, that paints a rather incomplete picture.

The vaccines have been good at reducing severe illness, however as long as there is a lot of community spread, then the vaccine will not be as effective at preventing infections. The more vaccinated people are exposed to a virus the higher chance there is for a breakthrough infection. Israel has to think of a strategy on vaccinated their holdouts if they truly want to make this a manageable disease.

I believe this is a result of the smaller sample size of work-from-home employees.

I have some good news. You are correct work from home is not beneficial for every person. How productive someone is able to be at home has to do with a myriad of factors. Psychological factors (self-discipline, coping strategies, loneliness, anxiety, stress, boredom, daily routines etc), physiological factors(Diet, quality of sleep and physical activity), social factors(quality/quantity of social contacts outside work, communication with colleagues etc), and Situational factors(distractions at home, financial security, office set-up and demographics).^(1)  

In a Japanese study, people working from home found it easier to concentrate on work, do creative tasks, relax, and refresh, but found it harder to communicate. All of these with about 99% confidence.^(2) However, the confidence of the variables in the multiple regression for at home was slightly dissatisfying. I believe this is a result of the smaller sample size of work from home employees.

A study on the effects of WFM on developers at Baidu found that the impact of productivity was dependent on job and the individual.^(3)

This final study is more of a survey of workers. Workers who felt more productive at home continued to work from home. Those who felt less productive returned to the office.^(4)

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what I'll say in conclusion. I think you are right it is probably dependent on the individual and profession. However, unfortunately, I feel for many companies it will be all or nothing. If they decide to return to the office, even if an individual is in fact more productive at home they will be forced to be on-site.

Edit: One additional thing to note. The dataset in everyone of these studies is fairly small. Additionally in 3 of the 4 studies the evaluation of productivity was opinion based and qualitative rather than quantitative. However, I do believe that there is real value in the evaluation of well being in these studies. The only way you’ll get a real evaluation of productivity is from a company like google that I am assuming is using data in their decision. We also have to remember that productivity is not the only variable in the equation and companies are going to take other things into consideration when evaluating a return to the office.

Another way to look at it is that it is a lot less stressful to draft things ahead of time when there isn't a crisis. It allows people to take their time, do multiple revisions, get different perspectives, etc. Having drafts and checklists prepared ahead of time can make things less traumatic for the people who have to manage the event. 

I work in mental health/consulting and a few years ago I was contacted by an organization that had their head person die by suicide. The second-in-command reached out asking how to word things for an announcement. They later admitted they were super overwhelmed because the head person was the only one who had ever talked to their local paper/news and so they had no idea what they were doing.

Former Commercial HVAC tech here. Im not gonna waste my time going into the nitty gritty of it. Long story short, your idea is way more impractical, expensive and time consuming than it would be to just let kids do remote learning (and issue laptops and provide internet to those that dont have such means). 

Lets start off by going into how shady much of the ""Air purifier"" market is. The technology is literally decades old, but the market is still incredibly niche and I can guarantee you your first major challenge is going to be the challenges to the efficacy of many of these systems currently out on the market. Once you find the 1 or 2 companies that make an actually effective product (which will take probably 2 to 4 years to do the studies, peer review the research, etc. . .), then you need to make some kind of arrangement where they will focus on just making specialized systems (many of these for these schools with have to be customized, which all adds to production and delivery time and labor time - and cost) for schools.

Then, once you find the products that work and have been able to do research that they are effective for that specific occupied environment, No legitamate contractor in their right mind is going to drop all their book of (legally ibligated to complete work on)business to just focus all in on all the schools in one state (not to mention nationwide). Its doable, but especially with the labor shortage and the sheer volume of work that would need to be done (especially given how its still summer), id probably think each contractor assigned these project would probably need to create a separate department or permanently have 2 to 3 techs per company to be specifically assigned to handle just this one customer. And of course, thats not going to be true since those guys will get pulled all the time to do other calls/emergency jobs.

Hell, many of the shady ones dont even have the insurance, intelligence (im not kidding about this part) or even legal clearance to be working near children to start with. You cant just throw some fly-by-night retrofit guy who scams old ladies to somehow safely and correctly make modifications to a building-wide or multiple RTU system without effin up the BAS or setting off alarms and even not even properly installing the damn equipment.

You didnt even put any thought into the kitchen area. Many kitchens dont get served by traditional AC's. They are served by MUA's tied to EF's that serve the Kitchen Hoods only. Yes, air is circulating but as you are probably aware of now with how bad that COVID junk spread in restaurants, that setup most likely will still help spread this junk (you probably arent aware of this but the reason it wouldnt be practical or possible to add any sanitizer or special filter, all youre really doing is giving the infected air more room to spread about the space and stagnate in specific areas since the air wont be getting treated.

 Some systems in these schools it wouldnt even physically possible to do (if your building is served by a VRF, the fantasy of 'sanitizing' the air safely in an occupied space goes right out the window automatically if you are using your standard mini split head vs a ducted AHU connected to your condenser array).",,,,1630476960,{},hb5nrj4,False,t3_pf7d15,False,True,t1_hb2oij5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pf7d15/nyc_approves_4000_classrooms_for_inperson/hb5nrj4/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,c5292395e7c0563c6d38d29500a871efd4dc71c0,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1630476975.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

[],,Grim-Cheetah,,,[],,,,text,t2_7m0gpjkt,False,False,[],"I had my 3rd Moderna booster two weeks ago this Friday. The pharmacist asked a ton of questions since I was their first (and probably only immunocompromised booster recipient according to her, plus she was curious and I was happy to oblige an opportunity to educate about my weird affliction.) Online booking for it was half-assed. They were anything but lax when I got onsite. I was impressed. I brought a letter from my immunologist and my own Epi pen for CYA purposes and neither were needed thankfully, but they were thorough af and confirmed with the CVS Specialty pharm side (my infusion med provider), verified my condition and that I was indeed eligible, double checked my vax card matched their records, etc. They might be an outlier versus the rule, but I’m the only one I know that’s gotten boosted, so I can only speak from my firsthand perspective. And yes, plenty of people were pissed off and said nasty things because I got something they haven’t or can’t have yet.

(Side note: 3 vaccinations in and I’m still not magnetic, which is a total letdown since I had big ol’ X-Men/supervillain aspirations and am in reality walking around looking more like a rejected Quarian character concept from Mass Effect. It also kicked my ass hardcore a THIRD time, but holy cow I felt like I could flip a car after that fever finally broke. 

Upside is the treatment we immune deficient folks rely on now contains bonus SARS-Cov-2 antibodies (my “drug” of choice is 20% human immunogammaglobulin solution for self administered sub-q infusion)…finally getting some bang for my bucks. Full protective factor? Probably not quite high enough antibody levels yet, but that depends on the plasma donors statuses and if they’re getting enough vaccinated or recovered post-infection donors, so just might be at that point — and imo &amp; my doc’s opinion we probably are. Donate plasma if you’re vaccinated. Donate plasma if you’ve had it and recovered.

&gt;Connally Independent School District officials closed its five suburban Waco schools for the rest of the week after the Saturday COVID-19 death of Natalia Chansler, 41, a sixth grade social studies teacher at Connally Junior High School, said Assistant Superintendent Jill Bottelberghe.  
              
&gt;Chansler’s death came days after David McCormick, 59, a seventh grade social studies teacher at Connally Junior High, died of COVID-19, Bottelberghe said.  
    
&gt;It was not immediately known if either teacher was vaccinated.  
               
&gt;Connally High School football coach Terry Gerik says the Cadets will play La Vega as scheduled Friday night.   
           
&gt;In a Monday email, Superintendent Wesley Holt said the hope “is that the closure and holiday break will provide those who are positive with the virus or exposed to others with the virus, the time to isolate and recover. This closure will also allow time for deep cleaning and sanitizing of all CISD facilities.”

I am fully vaccinated, both doses of Pfizer, since February of this year. I was able to get my shots early because my friend's clinic had extras, for whatever reason, that would have gone to waste, most likely. So, they reached out to staff for them to get family and friends down to make sure they all got used. They were supposed to give my friend my vaccination card so he could deliver to me, at least that's what I was told.

He never received my card and all subsequent phone calls have gone nowhere as the actual clinic has no records of me receiving the shots. Apparently, the clinic contracts out the pharmacy work and has changed companies several times since I was vaccinated. No one seems to be able to tell me the names of these companies much less how to get ahold of them.

I live in Texas and this facility is in Tarrant county so I have tried going to the public health department there to no avail as they have no records of me either. Is it possible that if the pharmacy company is registered in a different county and thus I would have records there?

So the question for your family member is: this guy is rich. He's got a big beautiful house, big bank account, spouse who can devote her time to time to helping him rehab. What about the rest of us who are not as wealthy?

Then % of patients in for COVID whom were discharged without treatment, 

Hospitals are not admitting people for COVID-19 as the primary diagnosis if it does not require treatment.  So you aren't going to get data that said patient was admitted for COVID-19 as the primary diagnosis if they didn't need treatment.

So the big stuff in the news about COVID-19 hotspots in the USA is healthcare systems that have their inpatient units, more specifically, their ICU units have too many patients that need care compared to the resources available to treat them.  So there is not a theoretical overload of people who are staying overnight at the hospital who are well and do not need care.

From your original post, 

""Does anyone know the would-have-died vs. could-have-stayed-home-and-lived ratio?

you aren't going to be able to extrapolate COVID-19 acuity from the general outpatient population from records of patients who have been admitted to the hospital. The hospital people are there because they are very sick and need a high level of care.

this video may help you understand how hospital care is at a level where people are not ""worried well"" so to speak. The patients cannot go home. They need the medicines, the machines, and the staff to keep them alive.

The median household income in 2019 was $68,703. That means that in a 2 income household each person is only making about $34k per year which is hardly a luxurious salary. Half of Americans make even less than the median income.  

Also people who live in low COL areas don’t normally make 75k. Wages are somewhat proportional to COL. The lowest COL is in Harlingen, Texas which had a median household income of less than 40k in 2019. Even in Manhattan,the highest COL area, the median household income that year was only $86,553.  Most households are not making $75k unless they live in high COL areas and even then, many people still live in poverty there.

&gt;Show us your data that the vaccine helps with any long-term outcomes besides hospitalizations/death.

Hospitalizations and deaths are the metrics that matter when it comes to defining an ""endgame"" for society to resume as normal. We now have a working solution (vaccines) to reduce burden on the healthcare system.

Sure, I'm interested in seeing that.

&gt;Reduce by how much? How much does a mask cut down on your chances of infection? And the vaccine?

Vaccine efficacy against infection varies depending on when you got jabbed, but efficacy against hospitalization remains around 90%+ according to multiple studies. The data I've seen regarding masks is cloudy.

China says it will provide 2 billion vaccine doses to the world.

The pledge, which included a $100 million donation to Covax, intensifies competition with the U.S. over leadership in ending the pandemic.



Published Aug. 6, 2021        Updated Aug. 9, 2021

China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, said the country would provide two billion Covid-19 vaccine doses to the world this year and would donate $100 million to a global effort to distribute the doses to developing countries, as Beijing attempts to take on a more prominent leadership role in curbing the pandemic.

Mr. Xi’s pledges were announced on Thursday in a written message to an international Covid-19 vaccine cooperation forum chaired by the Chinese government. “China will continue to do everything it can to help developing countries cope with the epidemic,” Mr. Xi said.

He did not specify whether the two billion doses were donations or sales, or whether they consisted of new supplies or included those already sold. China is the world’s top exporter of Covid-19 vaccines and has sold 952 million doses worldwide, according to Bridge Consulting, a Beijing-based research company. It has also donated 33 million doses.

The $100 million donation to Covax, a global initiative backed by the World Health Organization to provide vaccines to poorer countries, would give the organization much-needed financing to strike deals with vaccine makers at a time when it has been struggling to acquire and administer doses. The world is still short of $700 million for needed vaccines, according to the W.H.O. Mr. Xi did not give a time frame for the donation.

The provision of both vaccines and money would give Beijing an opportunity to promote its reputation as a leader in public health and improve its image, which has taken a beating in the West after the pandemic. China’s donations place it in direct competition with the United States, which has sent 110 million doses abroad and purchased another 500 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine — worth about $3.5 billion — to be distributed globally through Covax.

Even with those supplies, however, the world remains short of the 11 billion doses the World Health Organization says must be distributed globally to bring the pandemic under control.



Last year, Mr. Xi promised that a Covid-19 vaccine would be a “global public good.” But in the following months, China appeared focused on mostly striking bilateral deals with countries to win good will.

This year, Beijing showed more of an interest in participating in Covax. Last month, two of China’s vaccine makers, Sinopharm and Sinovac, signed an agreement to sell Covax more than half a billion doses by the first half of next year.",,,,1630455887,{},hb4kly6,False,t3_pfgymi,False,False,t1_hb4jxdz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pfgymi/highincome_countries_called_on_to_share_covid19/hb4kly6/,1630543568.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm gonna just steal an entire paragraph from Wikipedia here (emphasis mine, a lot of this might sound eerily familiar): 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Harper has summed up new evidence and modern interpretations, with **disease and climate change as important drivers of political collapse** in addition to the traditional discourse. He describes a Roman climatic optimum from about 200 BCE to 150 CE, when lands around the Mediterranean were generally warm and well-watered. This made agriculture prosperous, and the collection of taxes straightforward. From 150 to 450, the climate entered a transitional period, in which taxes were less easy to collect and bore more heavily on the working population. After about 450, the **climate worsened further in the Late Antique Little Ice Age that may have directly contributed to the variety of factors that brought Rome down**.\[36\] The ever-expanding Roman Empire was built on the fringes of the tropics.

I feel for you, but everyone at every stage is being robbed of precious time. Little kids aren't getting properly socialized, people have lost their jobs, others have had surgeries delayed, suffer from long COVID, been unable to see family... it really sucks this is your college experience, and you have a right to be frustrated, but it sucks collectively now. Different generations get robbed in different ways. People during the World Wars were robbed of precious time (they went to war instead of college or living their life and either came back traumatized or didn't come back at all). Wearing a mask isn't fun, and I hate what it's done for social/dating experiences, but we have to adjust. It's pretty clear at this point the vaccines alone won't get us out of this mess. We need to vaccinate *and* wear masks at least for the near future.

Again, this isn't to diminsh your feelings, but we have to take a wider perspective. It's a shame that the extremists (and this doesn't include under 12s and people with legitimate medical reasons not to be vaccinated) refuse to do their part and so put more burden on the rest of us, but that doesn't mean we should slack off because of what they've done. We're all exhausted and stressed and yearning for a return to normal. However, we have to manage our expectations and realize normal is still a ways off.

I don't totally agree.  If you are healthy and fully vaccinated, you can do most of the things you could do pre-covid and they still feel normal.

I agree.  I dislike wearing a mask.

But I try to compare to what my life was before I was fully vaccinated.  I did curbside only, and did not going in to any businesses that did not offer that.  That even meant no takeout at many places.  I had a blast this winter having bonfires with friends every week or so, but never went inside.  I didn't carpool with people.  I didn't see my family for the holidays.

Now I can (and do, regularly) get takeout from anywhere.  I have done indoor dining at a couple of places that I have really wanted to go to that don't have patios.  I hang out maskless, indoors with fully vaccinated friends and family (that's all of them).

Reddit sold out years ago.  It's got progressively worse part in function of scale, and part in function of world issues and topics.  Past years with the banning of subs when new CEO came in and then the rise of Trump did a lot to change the demographics and content.  It went from the pre-September 94 usernet days to AOL opening up, of Facebook when it was just academic accounts.  Now, every fucker has an account, marketeers use it for marketing from 'Joe Nextdoor"" fake posts, a lot of subs are trash, the site is filled with promoted and astroturfed submissions and misinformation is rife.  There are some real gem of subs still on here, but they're not monetizes and do well because of the community aspect of it.  They (I hope) prosper because in those few subs, proper discussions, questions, knowledge share occurs for the greater good of that community.   Bit like GeoSites.   But so much content and karma whoring and corporate crap can just go.    Loads of communities jumped ship to discord, but now that's become post-sweet spot Reddit.

&gt; FDA officials are scrambling to collect and analyze data that clearly demonstrate the boosters' benefits before the administration’s Sept. 20 deadline for rolling them out to most adults. Many outside experts, and some within the agency, see uncomfortable similarities between the Biden team's top-down booster plan and former President Donald Trump's attempts to goad FDA into accelerating its initial authorization process for Covid-19 vaccines and push through unproven virus treatments.

&gt; On Tuesday, two top FDA vaccine regulators resigned — a decision that one former official said was rooted in anger over the agency’s lack of autonomy in the booster planning so far. A current health official said the pair, Marion Gruber and Philip Krause, left over differences with FDA’s top vaccine official Peter Marks. Now the agency is facing a potential mutiny among its staff and outside vaccine advisers, several of whom feel cut out of key decisions and who view the plan to offer boosters to all adults as premature and unnecessary.

You also know about 120M infected with virus pre-delta, so roughly 1/3 of the population. For simplicity sake, 1/3 of non-vaccinated were infected pre-delta, so now you have a total of 230M with antibodies, and 110M without, before delta wave. For leveling off of cases, seems like we need 90% antibody coverage, or 310M people, so 80M more than today. 

Delta is averaging 150K/day from testing - but the question is how many ACTUAL cases are there? 5x? 10x? Let's say 10x. So 1.5M/day, or 45M a month. Let's say half of those are unvax (given asymptomatic infections from majority Vax), so 750K people are newly getting antibodies daily, or 22.5M a month at current levels.

Then people are getting vaccinated daily too, something like 400K/day, so 12M/month. Combined with infection, that's about 35M a month that are getting antibodies. 

If we gotta get 80M new antibodied people and we are getting 35M over the last month, that would stand to reason that by no later than mid-October, likely sooner, this thing is over in its raging fire form. Then we move to the smoldering state, which over the winter would still be dangerous,but not showstopping.

Looks to me like we are nearing finish line in the USA, and the only thing that stops it is actual vaccine evasion. I have read that's a 5% possibility, but rises the longer we don't get the world vaxxed. I really hope the west doesn't go boosters for all and we get most folks worldwide done by March 22.

&gt; **Many studies on ivermectin for COVID-19 have serious methodological limitations, resulting in very low evidence certainty.**[120][124][125] As a result, several organizations have publicly expressed that the evidence of effectiveness against COVID-19 is weak. **In February 2021, Merck, the developer of the drug, issued a statement saying that there is no good evidence ivermectin is effective against COVID-19, and that attempting such use may be unsafe.**[126][127] The U.S. National Institutes of Health COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines state that the evidence for ivermectin is too limited to allow for a recommendation for or against its use.[128] In the United Kingdom, the national COVID-19 Therapeutics Advisory Panel determined that the evidence base and plausibility of ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment were insufficient to pursue further investigations.[129]

&gt; Ivermectin is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in treating any viral illness and is not authorized for use to treat COVID-19 within the European Union.[128][130] **After reviewing the evidence on ivermectin, the EMA said that ""the available data do not support its use for COVID-19 outside well-designed clinical trials"".[130] The WHO also said that ivermectin should not be used to treat COVID-19 except in a clinical trial.**[131] The Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency, Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases, and Brazilian Thoracic Society issued position statements advising against the use of ivermectin for prevention or treatment of early-stage COVID-19.[132][133][134]

This increase in cost results from population aging, not because we are living longer, but because birth rates dropped from three to two children per woman. Importantly, this shortfall is basically stable after 2035; adjustments to taxes or benefits that offset the effects of the lower birth rate may restore solvency for the Social Security program on a sustainable basis for the foreseeable future. Finally, as Treasury debt securities (trust fund assets) are redeemed in the future, they will just be replaced with public debt. If trust fund assets are exhausted without reform, benefits will necessarily be lowered with no effect on budget deficits.""

In 2016, police officers rate of deaths per 100,000 full time employees was 14.6. Logging workers had 135.9 per 100,000,  commericial fisherman was 86 , and delivery drivers was 24.7. You're nearly 10 times more likely to die if you cut down trees for a living than working in law enforcement.

another interest bit is that of the police officers death rate, almost 50% of on the job deaths are due to accidents. according to the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2019-statistics-on-law-enforcement-officers-killed-in-the-line-of-duty), in 2019, 41 of the 89 officers who died in the line of duty, were killed in accidents:

* 19 died as a result of motor vehicle crashes
   * 18 while operating cars, SUVs, trucks, or vans
   * 1 while operating an ATV or a motorcycle
* 16 were pedestrian officers struck by vehicles
* 3 were killed in firearm-related incidents
* 2 officers drowned
* 1 officer was reported to have died in the category of an other type of duty-related accident when they were struck by a tire/wheel while assisting a motorist.

\*Note that there are car crashes in the felonious death category as well, just those car accidents were the result of a persuit or some other felonious act. These vehicular deaths and fire-arm incidents listed here are reported as purely accidental, not malicious.

Covid also has an outsized death impact on every younger cohort, 50-65 yo are 20+ more likely to die after catching a case of this coronavirus vs. the flu... and the fact that it spreads more rapidly means that without controls, basically everyone will get it where as the flu spreads so slowly that some people would go decades not getting it despite zero precautions.

Covid will likely require boosters for as long as there are high rates of global infections putting out new strains. The good news is that if we widely distribute vaccines and boosters for a few rounds, that combined with a couple of years with some level of immunity from wild-type exposure will likely eventually reduce cases enough that new variants may slow and eventually stop if there are no strong animal reservoirs that get infected in the meantime. We may not completely eliminate Covid, but maybe in 10 years it will look a lot more like a strain of the flu, where there is enough vaccination and natural immunity to different variations that when a new strain breaks out it will still be less severe and spread less quickly, and a specific booster will be available for higher risk groups and individuals who want/need it.",,,,1630529610,{},hb8gkts,False,t3_pfkly2,False,True,t1_hb8camt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pfkly2/in_los_angeles_breakthrough_infections_are_now_30/hb8gkts/,1630618223.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

*The company announced Wednesday that it has initiated a later-stage clinical trial for its new antiviral medication and will enroll 1,140 participants to further examine the effectiveness of the drug against COVID-19.*

*The way the new drug is administered can be compared to the way Tamiflu is taken by people who become symptomatic with the flu. Tamiflu is recommended within 48 hours of the onset of flu symptoms to reduce their severity over the course of the illness, which may be shortened by a few days with the aid of the medication.*

*Pfizer believes that if its drug proves successful in ongoing trials, it could be used by hundreds of millions of patients in the years ahead as an affordable treatment for COVID-19.*

*""If successful, [the drug] has the potential to address a significant unmet medical need, providing patients with a novel oral therapy that could be prescribed at the first sign of infection, without requiring hospitalization,"" Pfizer said in its announcement.*

*Pfizer's Phase 2/3 trial comes after an early-stage study in March exceeded expectations. The drug was found to reduce viral replication in people with COVID-19 by more than fivefold. Preclinical testing also showed the drug could be effective against all currently known variants of COVID-19.*

*Pfizer chief scientific officer Mikael Dolsten said the drug appears to have a good safety profile and has not generated any problems in doses up to 500 milligrams twice per day over a 10-day period.*

We can academically debate how much more than 50% the word ""overwhelming"" means, but at the very least, all the way down to the 40-49 age bracket we have between 94%-82% double vaxxed, and then for the rest until 16-19 it's 79%-70% double vaxxed.

You can check those stats more precisely [here](https://datadashboard.health.gov.il/COVID-19/general) if you know hebrew, or just go to the graph in the third line of graphs on the left most column, it's not difficult to figure out. Light blue for triple, green for double, dark blue for one dose. The whole first line of graphs is also very interesting, it shows how well the vaccinations work for infections/serious cases. It shows the vaccines are a success, but also that most assuredly vaxxed also get the virus, which by this point is probably no surprise to anyone.

Anyway, the larger point stands. What can we do? Forcefully vaccinate everyone? The stats show clearly even that won't fully work and certainly not for a long time. I'm legit asking how we can fully go back to normal without a worldwide quarantine. For more than a few months that is.

The functional relevance of pre-existing cross-immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is a subject of intense debate. Here, we show that human endemic coronavirus (HCoV)-reactive and SARS-CoV-2-cross-reactive CD4+ T cells are ubiquitous but decrease with age. We identified a universal immunodominant coronavirus-specific spike peptide (S816-830) and demonstrate that pre-existing spike- and S816-830-reactive T cells were recruited into immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and their frequency correlated with anti-SARS-CoV-2-S1-IgG antibodies.

I went in and asked for Moderna because the recent studies have indicated it's better against Delta. My nurse had to contact the lead nurse who then had to call the infectious disease doctor on-call because they only had approval to give the same type as the original.After waiting 45 minutes, I was able to get approval for my individual case. So if you want the other one, I would call ahead and ask if the clinic is mixing shots and what it would take to get the other one. 

Side effects wise, for both Pfizer shots I had a sore arm and that was it. For the third shot, it's hard to say how much of the side effects were due to it being the third shot (effectively the second booster) vs it being Moderna, but it hit me way different than the Pfizer vaccine. I got the shot Saturday midday. Arm was getting sore Saturday evening. Was very sore Sunday. I started feeling feverish and tired Sunday night. Husband recommended I take a muscle relaxer and just sleep all of Monday so I did. My lymph node in the armpit of the arm that got the shot was so swollen it was visible and I had to put a pillow under my arm to keep pressure off it. Other armpit node got sore a few days later. So I'm hoping that means a super duper immune response!

[],,Constantdwindle,,,[],,,,text,t2_bs5gjy6y,False,False,,"Former Commercial HVAC tech here. Im not gonna waste my time going into the nitty gritty of it. Long story short, your idea is way more impractical, expensive and time consuming than it would be to just let kids do remote learning (and issue laptops and provide internet to those that dont have such means). 

Lets start off by going into how shady much of the ""Air purifier"" market is. The technology is literally decades old, but the market is still incredibly niche and I can guarantee you your first major challenge is going to be the challenges to the efficacy of many of these systems currently out on the market. Once you find the 1 or 2 companies that make an actually effective product (which will take probably 2 to 4 years to do the studies, peer review the research, etc. . .), then you need to make some kind of arrangement where they will focus on just making specialized systems (many of these for these schools with have to be customized, which all adds to production and delivery time and labor time - and cost) for schools.

Then, once you find the products that work and have been able to do research that they are effective for that specific occupied environment, No legitamate contractor in their right mind is going to drop all their book of (legally ibligated to complete work on)business to just focus all in on all the schools in one state (not to mention nationwide). Its doable, but especially with the labor shortage and the sheer volume of work that would need to be done (especially given how its still summer), id probably think each contractor assigned these project would probably need to create a separate department or permanently have 2 to 3 techs per company to be specifically assigned to handle just this one customer. And of course, thats not going to be true since those guys will get pulled all the time to do other calls/emergency jobs.

Hell, many of the shady ones dont even have the insurance, intelligence (im not kidding about this part) or even legal clearance to be working near children to start with. You cant just throw some fly-by-night retrofit guy who scams old ladies to somehow safely and correctly make modifications to a building-wide or multiple RTU system without effin up the BAS or setting off alarms and even not even properly installing the damn equipment.

You didnt even put any thought into the kitchen area. Many kitchens dont get served by traditional AC's. They are served by MUA's tied to EF's that serve the Kitchen Hoods only. Yes, air is circulating but as you are probably aware of now with how bad that COVID junk spread in restaurants, that setup most likely will still help spread this junk (you probably arent aware of this but the reason it wouldnt be practical or possible to add any sanitizer or special filter, all youre really doing is giving the infected air more room to spread about the space and stagnate in specific areas since the air wont be getting treated.

 Some systems in these schools it wouldnt even physically possible to do (if your building is served by a VRF, the fantasy of 'sanitizing' the air safely in an occupied space goes right out the window automatically if you are using your standard mini split head vs a ducted AHU connected to your condenser array).",,,,1630474110,{},hb5jupv,False,t3_pfjdlm,False,True,t1_hb4xwje,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pfjdlm/texas_school_system_closes_after_2_teachers_die/hb5jupv/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,17572ec2f348783f98261b7d6e3f5b1b14a85b7b,True,False,,0.0,1630474926.0,0.0,1630474985.0,False,r/Coronavirus,public,

From https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3716373/

""The chiropractic educational program is a minimum of 4 years. All Council on Chiropractic Education-accredited institutions provide a curriculum incorporating elements of basic science (eg, physiology, anatomy, and biochemistry), clinical science (eg, laboratory diagnosis, radiographic diagnosis, orthopedics, neurology, and nutrition), and clinical intern experience. In the clinical arena, chiropractic students have very limited training in pharmacology and critical care, but have significant training in clinical biomechanics, neuromusculoskeletal diagnosis, manual therapy, nutrition, and exercise rehabilitation.""

""Although all 4 institutions have followed different approaches to implementation, the overall strategies share some common principles. (a) Course work should incorporate journal club formats, checklist reviews of current studies, and student construction of critical appraised topics. (b) Informational literacy assignments should span all 4 years, be relevant, and relate to other course content. (c) The language and concepts of evidence-based practice must permeate all diagnosis and management courses and, where feasible, basic science courses as well. (d) Focused and ongoing training must target a large proportion of classroom and clinical faculty across the entire school curriculum. (e) Application of these skills must be patient based and become part of the clinic culture as opposed to an endeavor segregated to a journal club activity.""",,,,1630460433,{},hb4ugfy,False,t3_pf8tef,False,True,t1_hb45wj7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pf8tef/florida_families_line_up_outside_venice/hb4ugfy/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,a6b70e4ba264ca852bd67d26c454ffe67b5ed252,True,False,,0.0,1630460834.0,0.0,1630476629.0,False,r/Coronavirus,public,

Despite the cap, high income earners subsidize social security quite a bit. High income earners are also statistically much less likely to ever claim disability.

It's not as progressive as the normal income tax, but it's still progressive. Here's a chart from 2011* that illustrates it nicely, especially considering disability insurance. The official mechanism for accounting for benefits can be seen [here on page 4](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R43542.pdf). You can see how the ""bends"" are progressive: the higher the income, the lower rate of benefit return per dollar put into the system.

I'm against using payroll taxes to further increase the progressivity of the tax system. It's a favorite target of the ultra-rich against the far more numerous high income W2 earners. The ultra-rich gain income primarily from means not covered by payroll taxes (capital gains, investment income, business passthrough income, certain types of equity performance compensation).

Does anyone know the would-have-died vs. could-have-stayed-home-and-lived ratio?

Like are these beds just full of people who don't actually need to be there from a treatment perspective, or are most of the people in the hospital for COVID there because if they're not there, they're going to die?

7-day average of new cases in the US is \~150K as of today, while deaths is \~1.3K... which is &lt;1% of cases. So, is it the case that most people in the hospital just don't need to be there and shouldn't be, but are anyway because they're panicking? Like, is the hospital getting jammed up by the 1% or the 99%?

* Greece 
* Portugal 
* Japan 
* Italy 
* Spain (although they did have a brief return to growth for 4 years prior to 2020) 

These are all countries with known economic malaise. All of these but Japan have struggled with youth unemployment (and Japan's youth employment model is often exploitative in nature). This is ignoring the laundry list of Eastern European countries where you could point to the collapse of the Soviet Union as something that has continuing economic impacts through today. 

Unless balanced by global demand, shrinking domestic demand results in a vicious cycle of downsizing of the very companies you are hoping to hire your child - shutting doors of opportunity, not opening it. And the growth assumptions that helped underwrite piles of government debt start to fall apart - leading to financial crises like that seen in the EU debt crisis (focused on.. you guessed it.. the ""PIGS"" - Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain).

She did extremely well with the online classes, but not having any friends (new school for only a couple months before pandemic/online classes) and not really interacting with anyone, took it's toll on her well being. We heavily debated whether she should go back to school this year, I mean her mom and I are fully vaccinated, and she doesn't have any health problems that would be likely to leave her more compromised by covid, but we all know that there is still risk involved. But she NEEDS the socialization, to a degree that we were seeking therapist for her last year, and she needs the one on one occupational/physical therapy for a disability. So, she's been in class for 2ish weeks now, and everyday I am anxious about her coming home with signs/symptoms of the virus...
