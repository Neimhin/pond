What Florian Krammer is saying is the sequencing (of the genome) is difficult because of the limited virus per sample because the antibodies do not let the virus RNA to attach itself to human DNA and replicate to scale. This does not equal to the mucus or droplets not sufficient to infect others. For example if the virus is on a steel surface (let us say door knobs), if someone tries to do the genome sequencing post 24 hours, genome sequencing is not possible/ very difficult. However, if someone touches the door handle and then his nose, highly likely the virus will infect the person.

That's the real question, do you think we have to mask up until every single person in the country is vaccinated? 

If you agree that masking can stop before reaching 100%, then the question is when can you lift mask requirements? 90% vaccinated? 80? 70? What is your threshold? 

A data based approach will look at the trend, if the trend continues on it's current trajectory, then CDC is probably correct in their decision. If the trend shifts back up though, you could argue they messed up and lifted the mask requirements too soon.

Take a look at that link from about a month ago. It seems vaccination is highly likely to reduce transmission.

That being said, it's not enough for me to trust other people in public yet. I'll trust others who I know are vaccinated and not wear a mask around them because the combined reduction in risk of transmission.

At the same time there's no chance I'm taking my kid indoors to a place like costco. I trust the vaccine, I don't trust other people. 

I also had 2 people call in sick in the last 24 hours after not having issues with that for quite some time. Changes in behavior or nice weather, hard to say.

COVID has natural swings, so it can be hard to isolate factors.  For example, in Ontario they were declaring victory for lockdowns, but other provinces dropped at the same times, at about the same rates, without them.  If the lockdown were the cause of the recovery, you would expect places that locked down to have better results.

Likewise, when you vaccinate certain people and their infection drops while non-vaccinated rates don't, it looks more and more like it's the vaccine causing the drop.  Statistically, the bigger the effect, the smaller the sample size required, and the more likely and fast it is to be true and not random chance.

These were *very* good results, comparing the vaccinated vs the unvaccinated.  A surge makes this kind of test easier, as it's easier to see a change in the infection rate.

A surge means that there are a large number of infected people, which lets you compare more infected people and more vaccinated people.  If only a small group gets infected, a 100% reduction will only make a small difference.  If a large group gets infected, even a 5% reduction can make a big difference.

The attitude was changing to one where being vaccinated doesn't change anything for the person getting vaccinated- So why bother? And with the massive number of vulnerable individuals that had been vaccinated, it was honestly hard to argue against that attitude.

This changes that. Yes there are liars. People lie all the time. But we don't base our world around assuming the worst in people, that's what leads to dystopian policies where everyone is assumed guilty until proven innocent. It's just not what this country is about.

There are going to be liars, yeah, but there's going to be social pressure too. This will result in large amounts of ""I want to get vaccinated so I can stop wearing a mask."" There's going to be social pressure of ""Why aren't you wearing a mask when I know you didn't get vaccinated."" That's going to make a difference. It isn't going to convince everyone to get vaccinated, but you can't just sat ""This policy isn't perfectly effective, why are we bothering?"" That's ridiculous

 In a matter of weeks there will be more people who have no reason to wear a mask than there will be people who should still be wearing a mask. Why in the world should we be forcing the majority to do something unnecessary because a small subset of the minority might take advantage of it? I'm damn happy this change is here and I'm positive it's the right thing to do. I have never heard a good counter argument beyond ""Everyone is a stupid evil liar and I'm a good honest person who knows better."" This policy is one of trust and unsurprisingly its detractors base their belief in smug arrogance, the only thing more insufferable is how confident the detractors are that they're ""Just being reasonable.""

For context Oregon only stayed shutdown for a month more, but we had *very* few active cases when we reopened at the end of May 2020. And Israel/UK have both shown the effectiveness of combining their vaccine rollout with lockdown/mitigation. We'll see how our method works I guess.

But to directly answer your question, I would say 1-5 daily cases/100k, *across the country*. As long as there are areas with high numbers, and subpar vaccine uptake, exponential spread could creep up quickly.

This suggests that protective immunity by the mRNA vaccines tested here are likely retained against the B.1.617.1 variant**.

Now the CDC has repealed the mask mandate BEFORE I'm fully vaccinated. I still have to go to work, and I can't avoid people there. That puts me at risk.

This does not match what we've seen out of COVID so far, just saying. We're getting repeated waves of this disease. Everywhere.

But, you make a good point about masks. Food for thought:  The 188 to 306 number is using -backdated- flu data. That's really not appropriate, as we're talking about a time before we were all masking up. This makes it for a much more hospitable environment for respiratory diseases being compared to a much more hostile environment. That's going to be a big skewing of data.

If we look at the child flu deaths this season -since- we started masking up, do you know how many that is so far?

One.

Just one.

That's what you keep missing. They were breaking rules before. They were wearing masks on their chins. They were pulling down masks to talk. They were doing everything they could to not wear a mask. And many stores weren't enforcing the policy anyway as store employees don't want a conflict. 

So this CDC decision does not change much for anti-vaxxers/anti-maskers. That group has been mingling and infecting each other for a while and they would continue to do so with or without this CDC decision. So no, this CDC decision isn't going to kill them. They were going to kill themselves regardless due to their lifestyle. 

But those who are concerned can keep masking and distancing and protect themselves. And those people now have an extra incentive to go get vaccinated as soon as possible. 

As a result, I think your common sense is wrong. Your common sense is worrying about the population that will die due to their risky behavior that has nothing to do with this CDC decision. 

My common sense says this decision will save more lives through incentives and getting the hesitant to get the vaccine. It will also create more trust in CDC and vaccines for future pandemics. It paints a positive image that if people get vaccines, then CDC is reasonable and it will relax masking. It has a far reaching positive impact for vaccines and CDC not just for now but future that vaccines work and lead to relaxation of strict requirements. The positive far outweighs the negative. 

Your common sense seems to be stuck on protecting the ""liars/anti-maskers/anti-vaxxers"" who don't care and will infect each other regardless of what CDC says.

The truth is NOT everyone can get vaccinated yet, and that’s exactly my fear. She doesn’t have a choice. She’s too young. And she deserves to get back to a normal life just as much as everyone else.

You’re right that covid won’t fully go away, but it could get so much better than it is. And it would get better faster if people were careful for a few more months.

I didn't mean to imply that's all there was to it, but I wasn't too clear I guess. The timing of it was just an observation, the number of cases is important factor to me. When Oregon re-opened we had hardly any cases and a test positivity rate of 1%. GA and then TX reopened when cases were still going up. Thus ""peeing in the pool"" because those outbreaks didn't stay within their borders. 

I'm not in the business of comparing states' covid-19 response over the course of the entire pandemic. There's too many variables to control for, not to mention inconsistencies in data sets (eg. Oregon counted ""tests"" differently than every other state for most of the pandemic). Comparing when state's reopened is a little more specific, especially when the contrast is so acute as in the case of OR vs GA/TX. 

I agree about the vaccinations, and also prior infections. I think a big reason for WA and OR's late surge is that we've had some of the lowest numbers all pandemic, so less natural immunity.

And that's if you have an mRNA vaccine, J&amp;J is around 66% which means that you're only 3x less likely to get it. The real reason it's so rare is because most people have only been fully vaccinated a week or two, so there hasn't been enough time to be exposed to COVID, especially with rates plummeting.

However, there's been a lot of bad math where people estimate the risk as the number of breakthrough cases divided by the number of vaccinated people. This analysis is useless, as the ""breakthrough risk"" number will continue to increase as more and more breakthrough cases happen even as the real risk decreases with the plummeting case rates. The cynic in me thinks that the CDC stopped publishing info on breakthrough cases so that this formula that promotes vaccines still looks valid.

Anyway, I'm very pro vax, but with a math degree and can understand when some BS is going on. I just wish everyone would stop promoting vaccines with false arguments, as there are enough true arguments that show how great vaccines are without giving ammo to anti vaxxers.

Schools can be a bit different (like foreign travel), as health privacy regulations are laws, and public school requirements are laws.  The legislature can require vaccinations if the legislature wants.

Private businesses are quite a bit more constrained in such things.

In California (for example), there is a religious exemption for vaccination in  California Fair Employment and Housing Act, among other things.  There's also an anti-retaliation clause, so if you claim that the vaccine disproportionately harms minorities (which is likely the case, given disparities in healthcare), then your refusal to participate is protected by law.

When a store is going beyond CDC or State guidance, and the accommodation is minimal, and the risk is limited due to vaccinated employees and customers, it's a lot harder to categorically banning people who need accommodations, and prying into their medical history isn't good either.

In short, the days of trespass for not wearing a mask are going to largely come to an end at some point in the not too distant future, especially in places with strong disability accommodations.",,,1621059650,{},gy6tfpd,False,t3_ncjibz,False,True,t1_gy5npqb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ncjibz/walmart_to_stop_requiring_masks_for_vaccinated/gy6tfpd/,1621110723,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

It would have been poor optics to offer ""privileges"" before general availability.  There was a certain percentage of the population that would get vaccinated no matter what, so they waited for that and to make sure that vaccines were available.

Now that they are, they are flipping the script - trying to offer benefits to sway the undecided.  A lot of people aren't willing to lie, and the anti-vax crowd isn't going to get vaccinated no matter what, so they can maximize shots in arms by offering ""privileges"" and a return to normalcy as a carrot to sway the undecided.

It works better when done all at once, so that's why they are doing it this way.  They knew that vaccinated people were safe to gather months ago, just like it was common knowledge in the field that COVID surface transmission was rare last July or so.

They held off on changing the recommendations because they wanted people to feel like they were doing something to stay safe, and because it might help slightly.  Once the vaccine availability ramped up, they admitted it was ""hygiene theatre"", and recommended against it because it was making people feel safer than they should be.

On the other hand...scientists still don't know the host for ebolavirus, and ebola has been studied for decades.

&gt;The first outbreaks were in 1976 in South Sudan and Democratic Republic of the Congo.[41] The natural reservoirs of ebolaviruses are unknown.[42][43][44] However, some evidence indicates that megabats may be natural reservoirs.[40][41] Several megabat species have tested seropositive for antibodies against ebolaviruses, including the hammer-headed bat, Franquet's epauletted fruit bat, and little collared fruit bat.[40] Other possible reservoirs include non-human primates,[42] rodents, shrews, carnivores, and ungulates.[45] Definitively stating that fruit bats are natural reservoirs is problematic; as of 2017, researchers have been largely unable to isolate ebolaviruses or their viral RNA sequences from fruit bats. Additionally, bats typically have low level of ebolavirus-associated antibodies, and seropositivity in bats is not strongly correlated to human outbreaks.[44]

Now that these mask rules have been lifted, the venue has moved it inside. I have three children who aren't eligible for the vaccine. And even if they were old enough... It was literally just opened up so if the got the shot on day 1 they wouldn't be immune in time... But the mask guidance has been lifted immediately.

So now we will be indoors with a group of extended friends and family we don't know. I bet most of them won't be wearing masks now regardless of being vaccinated a sufficient time or not.

If we vaccinated a population of 100 000 and protected 95% of them, that would leave 5000 individuals diseased over 3 months, which is almost the current overall COVID-19 case rate in the UK. Rather, a 95% vaccine efficacy means that instead of 1000 COVID-19 cases in a population of 100 000 without vaccine (from the placebo arm of the abovementioned trials, approximately 1% would be ill with COVID-19 and 99% would not) we would expect 50 cases (99·95% of the population is disease-free, at least for 3 months)."".

This doesn't really change anything. The vaccines still aren't completely effective.

The crash helmet analogy doesn't really work either, because there are still a lot of precautions we take when driving. We may not strap helmets on ourselves, but we do wear seatbelts. Why? Because it's something easy we can do that significantly increases safety.

&gt;	 The ChAdOx1 estimates were presented by the Oxford team to the JCVI COVDI-19 sub-committee in a presentation and also in a clinical overview document. The Pfizer estimates were verbally given by PHE during discussion and were based on data previously provided to the sub-committee.

...it looks like the Pfizer announcement is based on data, and the AstraZeneca is based on no data but purely speculation and estimates. Eve the first section on Pfizer is almost two pages long, based on test data, but the AZ section is a measly few lines, suggesting it’s estimates or extrapolated. 

Another snippet from [here](https://www.nationalworld.com/health/coronavirus/covid-vaccine-second-dose-timing-of-pfizer-and-astrazeneca-jabs-in-the-uk-has-it-changed-and-side-effects-3090360)

&gt;	The Pfizer jab provides 95 percent protection after the second dose.

&gt;	The Oxford jab has proven to be 62 percent effective after two doses, with a small group of people receiving 90 percent protection when half a dose and a full dose is provided.

...seems to back up that the AstraZeneca jab is nowhere near as effective as the Pfizer, and I suspect that either they’ll have another announcement later confirming the OAz results, or they won’t because they don’t want to release the results as they’re not positive. 

I suspect there will have to be booster shots for OAZ vaccine recipients in the months to come as I don’t think it’s anywhere near as effective as they hoped. Hey, I had the OAZ and it’s definitely better than nothing: I actually thought I’d end up with Pfizer as I react very badly to flu jabs and some injections and I was told that, in that case, I’d likely get the Pfizer, but when I discussed this prior to the jab with my GP she essentially said just shut up and get the injection and you should be ok, and again when I went for the jab I was asked about allergies and reactions and had an extensive discussion with the people there and they basically almost theatrically paused and went back on-script about *you may feel some side effects*, completely ignoring anything I’d said to them.",,,1621065522,{},gy6zush,False,t3_nc9u36,False,True,t1_gy6y79g,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nc9u36/delaying_second_pfizer_vaccines_to_12_weeks/gy6zush/,1621114504,-2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

That doesn't sound like a reasonable way to estimate daily deaths. For example, the state has 70M people **NOW**, It hasn't had that popular in decades of the past so number of people who are around 70 are lower. It also ignores the fact that Indian population is mostly young. Assuming that Gujrat follows the Indian average of 6.38% for above 65 citizens then it means the state has 4.4M senior citizens who are likely to die of natural causes. In such case, the estimation for deaths within any 71 days would obviously change instead of 200k. 

As the article states, last year in the same period it was 58,000 deaths and now its 123,000.

Taiwan raised its coronavirus alert level on Saturday in the capital, Taipei, and the surrounding city, bringing curbs for a period of two weeks that will shut many venues and restrict gatherings in the wake of 180 new domestic infections.

Masks are to be worn outdoors for the first time, as the government encourages work and study from home, shutting cinemas and entertainment spots, while limiting gatherings of families and friends to five indoors and 10 outdoors.

Taipei’s government has already ordered bars, nightclubs and similar venues to shut.

Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said a ""level of risk"" in certain hot spots, such as Taipei's gritty Wanhua district, had spurred the decision to raise the alert level.

""Only by doing this can infections be dealt with and controlled,"" he told reporters.

Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je urged people to stay home as much as possible, adding that schools teaching should move online.

""During this time, if you have nothing on, then stay at home and don't go out, and if you do, wear a mask to reduce infection from droplets,"" said Ko, a doctor by training.

President Tsai Ing-wen's spokesman said she would reduce the number of ""unnecessary meetings"" or public events. The presidential office is close to Wanhua.

Amid pictures on social media showed people flocking to supermarkets to stock up on toilet paper and instant noodles, the economy ministry took to Facebook to assure people that supplies were ample and there was no need to hoard.

The rising community infections unnerved the stock market (.TWII) this week, though the government says the island's economic fundamentals remain good.

Deputy Finance Minister Frank Juan told Reuters authorities would watch market reaction on Monday, adding that he did not rule out calling a meeting of the National Stabilisation Fund, which the government can use to smooth large fluctuations.

Investors should act rationally, he said, pointing out that only a few sectors would be affected by the curbs, such as tourism, rather than the island's crucial foreign trade.

The new restrictions do not apply to the chip-manufacturing hub of Hsinchu, and are unlikely to affect exports of semiconductors, a global shortage of which has shut some car factories.

Chipmaking giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330.TW), said it was closely monitoring the situation, cutting non-essential gatherings and activities and reducing the movement of people across different chip fabs.

Taiwan has millions of vaccine doses on order from Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) and AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L), though only a small number have arrived from the latter due to global shortages and vaccination rates remain low.

More vaccines will start arriving next month, Tsai has said.

Since the pandemic began, Taiwan has reported fewer than 1,500 cases among a population of about 24 million, most of them imported from abroad, but a recent rise in community transmissions has spooked residents.

The island has never gone into a full lockdown and its people are used to life carrying on near normal, despite the pandemic ranging in many other parts of the world.",,,1621072286,{},gy76pzi,True,t3_ncv81e,False,True,t3_ncv81e,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ncv81e/taiwan_tightens_curbs_after_surge_in_domestic/gy76pzi/,1621118513,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Uh no because there would be ZERO cases unless variants take hold and the efficacy of the vaccines goes way down. 

&gt;If you agree that masking can stop before reaching 100%, then the question is when can you lift mask requirements? 90% vaccinated? 80? 70? What is your threshold?

I can't say exactly but perhaps they shouldn't base it on vaccination rates, they should base it on community spread. At the moment community spread of covid in the US....certainly in parts of the US...is relatively high. It's as high or higher than several months over the last 1.5 year of the pandemic so the risk continues to be as high now as it was then for the **unvaccinated**. If they needed to be wearing masks then they need to be wearing them now. 

&gt;A data based approach will look at the trend, if the trend continues on it's current trajectory, then CDC is probably correct in their decision. If the trend shifts back up though, you could argue they messed up and lifted the mask requirements too soon.

Well by that point it would be too late wouldn't it? I think even the CDC would say that the data already says the unvaccinated should wear masks right now. The problem is....now they won't. 

&gt;You saying they are wrong doesn't mean much.

Well of course it doesn't mean much....I'm just a commenter on reddit. However people WILL die from this, it's 100% certain. The unvaccinated will now be without masks and together in public places. Surely that will lead to deaths that masks could have prevented. The vaccines are great though....so I share your hope that the numbers will continue to go down anyway. But people aren't numbers....there will be actual lives lost from this policy change. 

&gt;There has to be a threshold when removing mask requirements won't impact the downward trend in infections. CDC thinks we have reached that threshold with enough immunity in the country. I personally think they are correct.

But again, the CDC hasn't removed masks for everybody they have said only the vaccinated may remove their masks. But the RESULT was Walmart and most public places EFFECTIVELY removing the masks for everybody. Therefore the CDC may have goofed here....or they are trying to offer a carrot to the unvaccinated which will backfire when they realize the unvaccinated will get to eat the carrot without getting vaccinated.",,,1621083205,{},gy7kj7v,False,t3_ncjibz,False,True,t1_gy6m8jp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ncjibz/walmart_to_stop_requiring_masks_for_vaccinated/gy7kj7v/,1621126313,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

If you're someone who will cave and go out and party the moment it is warm enough your personal risk is much higher. And while your risk of death is very low you also need to consider the risk of long covid and long term health problems no one knows much about yet (lung scarring etc). And if the Indian variant takes hold and spreads causing cases to rise the statistics will be affected, although for you case numbers would have to be very high again.  

If you're a sensible, diligent person who is careful then wait for Pfizer, if you lack self discipline get AZ ASAP. I'm pretty confident the UK government and health experts expect cases to jump after the 17th, the only question is how much.  

Lastly you mention disinfecting yourself, covid is predominantly spread via droplets/aerosolisation i.e. in the air. If you are concerned you'd be better off getting a few good quality N95/N99 or FFP2/FFP3 masks, they work much better at protecting *you* from breathing in airborne covid-19.

First off, my feeling is very specific to my location. I'm from western Washington, an area that, once the initial surge was under control, did an excellent job of keeping infection rates low. No complaints about that, but it has meant that we've seen a little bit of a surge this spring even as the rest of the country (which has much higher natural immunity rates from prior infections) has seen infection rates plummet. If I lived in southern California, where current infections per capita are roughly 1/6th what ours are, I would feel very different. 

My main concern is that the relaxation of masking for vaccinated individuals will cause people who aren't vaccinated to behave more recklessly and result in our case rates either remaining high for a sustained period or declining much more slowly than they would have otherwise. For me this doesn't matter much, but I do have children too young to get vaccinated and while I don't worry too much about their safety if they became infected, it would mean they'd have to be pulled out of school a childcare and be a tremendous pain in the ass. 

If our local rates continue to decline then my nervousness will be dissuaded.",,,1621096876,{},gy8ay9u,False,t3_ncsstr,False,False,t1_gy7zpm3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ncsstr/daily_discussion_thread_may_15_2021/gy8ay9u/,1621140831,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

From other link below, covid killed 43 people 24 and under in Florida (as of January 29th). I'm using Florida because schools were open the whole school year (part of your complaint about the numbers). The worst part about the flu deaths is that about half the deaths were healthy kids. How many healthy kids have died from covid in comparison? I'm guessing it's almost 0. So, you can keep home the very small % of high-risk kids from covid and probably reduce covid deaths in kids to near 0. Thus, if you're worried to send your kids to school now, how were you OK sending your kids to school before?

And there's science explaining why kids probably don't get affected by or spread the virus much due to them only starting to develop the ACE2 receptors that covid uses to infect the cells. If kids aren't getting sick, then that means it's most likely the virus is not replicating much in them leading to them also not spreading it either obviously. Thus, you have the numbers and explanation for the why as well.

When Trump was in charge, he rightly got the bulk of the blame, but his incompetence distracted from how poorly they have handled everything.

They have bungled every public communication leading to confusion, been territorial when cooperating with others is required, and been slow to communicate or even opaque on important and urgent issues but too quick to communicate on small uncertainties when delays of a few days might make a difference in perception. They are responsible for a lot of distrust and confusion. 

This announcement is just another example of bad strategy. Instead of taking a week to prepare state &amp; local health departments in order to prepare for a coordinated dropping of the requirements with clear communication on what households with children (or other common situations) should do, or recommendations of percentages vaccinated that would allow a county to drop requirements, they released this with no preparation of the way, leaving states and counties as surprised by this unexpected announcement as everyone else. 

The science might be on their side, but the public is rightly confused and concerned because they seem to be disregarding huge segments of the population.

* Average Kroger store, based on the profits, divided by store, makes about $948,000 per year in net profits ($18,230/week). This is not accurate, as there are other holdings, but leave it as it makes the best argument for your case. These stores were considering under performing, so they would be considerably less than $948,000 per year (calculations from the 2% average margin for last year, Kroger's net margins are now 1.81%, as they lost the huge bump from hoarding).

* The law put in effect $4/hour in hazard pay per employee.

* The average number of employees is 41 full time. Generally closer to 70 when part and full are included. Not sure for Ralphs or Food 4 Less, but let's use 40.

* If you take 40 employees * 40 hours * $4/hour, you have $16,160 per week, per store, with an additional $1,212 in employer sponsored FICA (7.5%). On top of that, Kroger has an additional 6.2% for each employee under $132,000/year and 1.45% on all employee wages. Since all would be below $132k, all would be at 7.65%, for an additional $1236.24/week. $16,160 + $1,212 + $1236.24 = an additional $18,604/week in expenses. And I did not check if there are additional Los Angeles employer fees. $18,230/week net profit minus $18,604/week = -$375/week.

* None of these stores were average stores, so more likely the change caused a bleed of $9,000+/week if they were at half the profit of the average store. 

Yes, the overall corporation can handle the loss of a few stores, but it cascades as stockholders lose faith in the chain.

Capitalism is a tragedy.

We learned about the benefits of the vertical and horizontal division of labour at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. As a result, we took labour out of its structure as well as the human being. The worker was no longer integrated into a community, no longer saw a purpose, a finished product and was exposed to the monotony. 

The worker became lonely, the ""family"" was dissolved because the work of the individual within the organisation was more valuable than the work of a community. Everyone specialised in individual activities. If he was not easily replaceable, he had something to oppose capital, otherwise the worker was exposed to abuse.

Capitalism dissolved social structures and diminished the power of labour. Until today, we have not been able to adapt social structures. Social media has acted as a catalyst in recent years. Gig-economy... a disaster.

Uncontrolled capitalism - Capitalism that has been politically unbounded and is used as an element of control in every area is a tragedy.

But... we are incapable of organising needs centrally. We have imperfect information, it is impossible for us to assess capabilities and strengths - to determine the right path outside the stress test of the market. The costs of organisation would be immense, the abuse of power unchecked. 

We need private ownership and market management of demand and supply = Capitalism.

The term capitalism is defined in many ways - many of these definitions are political. For me the term essentially means what I wrote above.

Capitalism can never be unchecked and the turbo capitalism of the USA is an abomination. But...",,,1621101445,{},gy8ki1m,False,t3_ncjvac,False,True,t1_gy5sxe0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ncjvac/kroger_reveals_that_it_paid_ceo_224_million/gy8ki1m/,1621146009,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

This has not been my observation in the two places I have lived during the pandemic (California and Florida). The vast majority of people were masked. The stores were doing their best to enforce the policy and most of the people who were against masks gave in and whined about it online. Now they won't have to wear masks nor prove anything. They are rejoicing.  

&gt;As a result, I think your common sense is wrong. Your common sense is worrying about the population that will die due to their risky behavior that has nothing to do with this CDC decision.

I don't think the CDC should play favorites about who they should try and protect and I certainly think that those who are misguided about covid still deserve to remain alive. But ignoring those points, it won't just be the anti-maskers who may die from this policy. The unvaccinated people not wearing masks (due to this new guidance) are also putting the vaccinated more at risk than they otherwise would be (some vaccinated do still get covid)....and are putting those not old enough to get vaccinated more at risk than they otherwise would be....and the immunocompromised more at risk than they otherwise would be....and the people who are unable to vaccinate (due to allergies or what have you) at higher risk than they otherwise would be. 

So no, I'm not ONLY concerned about anti-maskers and anti-vaxers here. 

&gt;It will also create more trust in CDC and vaccines for future pandemics. It paints a positive image that if people get vaccines, then CDC is reasonable and it will relax masking.

That's an interesting point that I had not considered. It is a positive to the new guidance but I still don't see it a bigger gain than the life saving necessity of the unvaccinated still wearing masks. 

&gt;But like I keep saying, test your common sense against the trend based on data. See how that works out for you.

Yes well we're all test subjects to this now....so goes Walmart so goes the rest of society in short time I would guess. It would have been nice to try this on a smaller scale first to get some actual real world data before suggesting it for the entire country but nope....from coast to coast masks will be optional for EVERYBODY in many public places. Let's hope vaccinations rates INCREASE from this point on due to the policy....due to this so-called carrot that you suggest has been placed in front of Americans. I don't see it happening but I honestly and truly would be delighted to be WRONG about all of this.

Demanding it specifically on transit regardless of vaccine status would be the simplest way to go. The CDCs new guidance even excludes transit specifically. 

I doubt they'll try to implement some city-only mask policy because:

1) it would run against the messaging they've been operating on about reopening the city to capacity next week.

2) it would be extremely hard to enforce at just a city level. Too many people are ranging in from LI, NJ and upstate and habits have inertia.

3) the already strained relationship between the governor and mayor would only get worse. They both want to be the one to drop the mandate and if the governor dawdles, the mayor will start swinging at him for political gain. 

4) the summer is starting, the places that are open will be competing with the ones who didn't. Waiting too long to unmask could leave the city open with no visitors because people planned their trips to places elsewhere earlier.

5) unmasking is big political capital but it has an expiry date. If the president and the rest of the country say it's time and you (as governor) do not, you better cynically hope things get way worse nationally or people will just get lazy about masks and you'll get no clout points for doing it.

I manage a small convenience store that had one of the strictest mask enforcements of anyplace in the city. We actively kicked people out of the store for not wearing masks right up until yesterday. Our regular customers were pretty good about it, so this only happened a few times a week. The store ran very lean, and if any employee (especially me) had gotten COVID, the store was at serious risk of going under.

While more than half the customers wore masks today, I had more unmasked customers in a few hours than in the last month. While I was the person who changed our mask policy today, I felt uncomfortable with so many unmasked customers because I didn’t recognize ANY of them. Then I realized that the majority of those maskless individuals were likely regular customers who wore masks for the last year and whose faces I had never seen. That made me feel better, because I’d bet most of them were vaccinated.

Those are easily forged with a printer. Sure they might ask but it's security theatre. 


&gt; You'll be hard pressed to get legit medical proof that indicate you'll be prevented from wearing mask

Shrug, my asthma nurse already offered a letter to say so without me asking. The masks excarbate my asthma, we tried a few medication changes. No luck so offered a letter saying as much, otherwise my asthma is fully controlled. It's on my records but I didn't bother as I don't need a mask on that long.


My American GP offered a vaccination exemption for Uni when I expressed unease at the Meningococcal vaccine.  I got the vaccination in the end as the disease looked horrible compared to the minute risks. You under estimate the desire for GPS to get through the day without abusive patients shouting at them. Writing a note saying patient X can't wear a mask because they reported it causes issues they will. 



&gt; or at least make you wait outside and get the stuff for you.


Which is a valid ADA accomodation &amp; the option costco implemented when masks where a hard requirement.



&gt; ADA protections are only up to the point where accomodating you would not put others at risk. Not everyone have gotten both shots with the required time and therefore are at risk.


Tell that to the CDC who says fully vaccinated people do not need masks. If patient X is fully vaccinated &amp; can prove it what accomodation are they going to offer ? The cheapest, easiest &amp; least confrontational is just wave them through.

[],,Qaz_,,,[],,,,text,t2_kj53y,False,False,[],"Yes, but it's not a random process. Both the AstraZeneca/Oxford &amp; the Sputnik vaccine are viral vector vaccines, specifically using an adenovirus (Oxford being a chimpanzee virus &amp; Sputnik being common cold viruses) that has been modified to avoid its replication. This virus enters cells, releases the coding it has for the spike protein, which the body then transcribes into mRNA, which then is used to make the spike proteins.

Interestingly, the Sputnik vaccine uses a different adenovirus depending on the dose - Ad26 on day 1 and Ad5 on day 21. I'm not sure if this explains their efficacy data relative to other viral vector vaccines, but I do think it's novel compared to other vaccines out there.

One explanation, though I'm operating off of limited information, is that our immune systems - when using a viral vector vaccine - can and do react to some extent with the adenovirus used. By using different viral vectors, they might avoid a scenario where the 2nd dose is less effective due to the body reacting to the viral vector. There's more to it, and some other possible explanations, but that is the one that I've seen.

For the combined trial, they're giving the AZ dose for day 1, and then on day 29 giving the Sputnik Ad5 dose. They've also started a study that is mixing the AZ vaccine &amp; Pfizer (in any order) and one that is mixing Moderna &amp; Novavax. I'm not sure on the specific reasons for that, but my layman's guess is that it would allow for more flexibility for supplies (say for instance, you  hypothetically only needed the AZ vaccine to prime your system, and then the Pfizer vaccine as a 2nd dose for a big boost to efficacy).

There might also be some studies in China on mixing doses, but I'm not entirely sure as I haven't kept up on vaccine news there.

I think the most important issue is thee CDC's mask recommendations have been weaponized against them. A lot of people, including Trevor Noah, have criticized the CDC for their messaging. Even Dr. Fauci said the CDC was being too conservative. The CDC's speech about impending doom in March didn't help either. With the CDC's new mask mandate, they're removing themselves from the line of fire so to speak.

None of these policy decisions are ideal, and in an ideal world, we'd tie non-pharmaceutical interventions to meaningful science based metrics.

1. They’ve been tested in highly regulated clinical trials, on hundreds of thousands of volunteers. They were safe and very effective in those trials. 

2. They’ve been administered to hundreds of millions of people around the world (between the different types of vaccine). 

3. They have no common, severe side effects known, after more than a year of scrutiny and study. 

4. They’ll significantly cut your chance of catching, spreading, or becoming severely ill with COVID. Our current crop of vaccines are some of the most effective vaccines ever developed. 

Out of those hundreds of millions of people I mentioned, no genetic changes or diseases have been recorded due to the vaccine.

here's a graph that ***predicts*** the ***evolution*** of a mutant that evades vaccines.

50k cases/day globally for ***6 months*** suggests an 80% chance that COVID 2.0 is born.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(21)00202-4/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(21)00202-4/fulltext)

&gt;Assuming a fixed vaccine escape mutation probability per infection (p), the risk of a vaccine escape variant arising in a specified time period is 1 – (1 – p)N, where N represents the number of cases in that period. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Reducing case numbers locally should be only one element of these strategies.** Travel restrictions to reduce the risk of importing novel variants should be considered. We recognise that assessing the escape variant emergence risk not only requires the variant to arise via mutation as considered here, but also to grow to appreciable frequencies. This is a stochastic process, depending on the availability of hosts to infect and the escape variant's fitness. A reduction in cases leads to both a reduction in the risk of escape variants appearing and a reduction in their subsequent establishment via transmission in the population.

&amp;#x200B;

vaccinating the kids now...

""could mean""

Take the Yankees situation: yes, a few vaccinated people got cases. Only one was mildly symptomatic. It's no big deal!

While in that same article it said that 90 children had died from covid. But that was only a period of time from the start of the pandemic in around March 2020 to August 2020. Now this could have been done because flu usually only sticks around for 4 months. So they decided to compare covid deaths over a similar time frame. I dont agree with this because covid is certainly a year round threat and most of that time frame for covid deaths was when children were mostly pulled from school. Also there were many restrictions in place like social distancing and mask wearing during that stretch of time. If children are just put in close proximity with each other unvaccinated for a whole school year I could definitely seem much higher death rates with covid than we get with the flu.,,,1621075475,{},gy7a3eb,False,t3_ncewko,False,True,t1_gy6p2oz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ncewko/some_fear_the_cdc_is_moving_too_fast_in_lifting/gy7a3eb/,1621120469,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I believe shutting things down and taking precautions across society, especially mask wearing, was the right move. So many vulnerable people could have been and were saved by limiting community spread. But those people have been vaccinated, or had the opportunity to be vaccinated, or have access to adequate PPE (N95 masks).  As I understood it, the two goals of shut downs and mask mandates were to flatten the curve to prevent overwhelming the healthcare system and to protect the extremely vulnerable: older folks and those with comorbidities. Those goals have been realized as much as they are going to be.

Somehow the intent of shut downs and mask mandates morphed in some people’s minds to “eliminate the virus“. That was never a realistic possibility, nor was it the goal. We’ve protected our healthcare infrastructure and our most vulnerable, it’s time to start taking individual precautions as each person deems warranted and move on with life.

1. Moderna/Pfizer are incredibly effective at preventing serious illness;
2. Moderna/Pfizer appear to be effective or very effective at preventing infection and transmission.
3. We've transitioned to a supply equal to or greater than the demand. 

Depending on the timing of the Pfizer approval, are we locked into a 3 vaccine portfolio for the next year-ish? 

The FD&amp;C Act requires a showing that there are no adequate, APPROVED and available alternatives. Pfizer has applied for approval, and the best opinion is that it's about 75-90 days out. That's less than the usual six months because 1. they're taking it on a rolling basis, 2. Its a pandemic, and 3. because, somewhere in there, I think the FDA might want to time it before the fall school semester, if they can. If the Novavax and possibly AZ applications are later - and it seems like they will be, at least for Novavax - they'll need to apply for full approval, not an EUA. And, query whether that approval request would be reviewed on an expedited basis,or if expedited review was granted, would it be the full six months?

**California reports 3,100 ‘breakthrough’ COVID cases among the vaccinated**

[https://www.sacbee.com/news/coronavirus/article251193109.html](https://www.sacbee.com/news/coronavirus/article251193109.html)

&gt;As of April 26, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded 9,245 breakthrough cases among 95 million vaccinated in the United States, including 132 deaths. That’s an infection rate of .01 percent.  
According to the federal agency, 45 percent of the post-vaccination cases were people age 60 and older. In 15 percent of the deaths, the person tested positive for the coronavirus but their death was not related to COVID-19.  
Nationally, the breakthrough cases included 835 hospitalizations, with about 70 percent of those patients exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms.  
According to a CDC website, the efforts to study breakthrough cases are based on voluntary reporting from state health departments and not all cases will be counted. The CDC has not updated the number of breakthrough cases in nearly 10 days.  
California’s health department said the data on breakthrough cases is consistent with findings the coronavirus vaccines are most effective in preventing severe illness.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;For starters, half of covid infections are asymptomatic, and most don't end up in hospitalization (and only 1-2% end in death).

&amp;#x200B;

are you under the impression that 

vaccinated &amp; infected &amp; asymptomatic can still transmit?

that they're a risk when unmasked?

&amp;#x200B;

where did you see that?

may have been ""unknown"" in the trials, but ***real world***.. it's not very likely.

If you run this out, it is likely each store makes between $100k - $1.x million in net profits per year. LA Times has these as ""under performing"", so likely on the low end of the range. 

The area in question added a $4 an hour hazard pay, which amounts to a bit over $8.3k per year per employee, plus additional FICA and California mandated fees (over $9k per employee per year). Average per store is 72, with approx 1/2 to 2/3rds full time equivalents, based on searches on industry averages (Dept. of Labor, etc.), so  $369,000 to $648,000 additional costs per year. As these are under performing, it is likely they could not afford it, at least not on a store per store basis. 

These stories titillate because we look at dollars versus billions in the headline. But, if I am honest, if I had a retirement plan over 2800 different investments and 3 were costing me money, I would dump them. I would do the same for a car that routinely had to be repaired. In each case, if we look at the macrocosm, I am changing economics (either for those in the companies with negative stocks or for the mechanics that make money off my auto repairs). Yes, I know all analogies fail.

Right, except that wearing your mask to protect yourself from those who are infectious is not nearly as effective as the infectious individuals wearing masks. So the ones most at risk (ie cannot vaccinate) cannot adequately protect themselves because those most likely to contract and spread the infection are not likely to continue wearing their masks.

So all I can do is trust they are making decisions with scientific evidence in mind.  Hell I’ve disagreed with the outdoor masking for ages now…but I realized they are really stubborn about doing things according to science and not “common sense”.

If we vaccinated a population of 100 000 and protected 95% of them, that would leave 5000 individuals diseased over 3 months, which is almost the current overall COVID-19 case rate in the UK.

Its a situation, not a singular national economic state. Rather, its a stateless, classless, moneyless society. So you have a misunderstanding there on a vast scale.

As for Socialism, I don't think you understand it well either. Socialism is not when ""the rich are taxed"" or ""government does stuff"". Socialism is the transition between Capitalism and Communism. Its when the workers jointly own the means of production, and has many forms. 

Some forms are Authoritarian in nature, like Marx and Lenin's conception of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat by means of a vanguard party (we currently live in a Dictatorship of the Bourgeoisie). Others are more Libertarian in nature, such as Anarchist Syndicalism, which I advocate for.

What you are talking about is Social Democracy. Which is better than what we have but still utterly exploitative.
Under any form of Socialism, you have few, if any, rich people at all. That wealth isn't there's because they stole it from the surplus labor value of the workers. 

What I am describing is Anarchist Communism. And the way you convince people of it isn't to make it more palatable. Its already the most liberating political philosophy we currently have. Its to show that the world is wholly unpalatable, and to show through results that our vision is preferable. 

My strategy?

It is under stuff like car crashes or the flu (COVID is less deadly to this group than the Flu).

And I was vaccinated day 1 that it was available to my group. I'm not trying to claim that a fear of COVID is unhealthy. But I do think the media has done a really good job making us worried and especially for young kids the low risk has been kind of glossed over or just not discussed, so we are applying a bit of a skewed worry on to kids. 

In other words, we don't shelter kids due to risks of catching flu or that they will be involved in a car crash. So now that 12+ can be vaccinated I do think opening up is sensible.

**D = Daily deaths on the day you want to examine**

**C = The daily case number from 21 days before the day you want to examine**

**FR = Fatality rate**

**(D / C) * 100 = FR**

All data is sourced from the U.K. government’s website [here](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk).

29 December 2020 was the worst day for COVID cases in the UK’s pandemic, with 81,523 people tested positive. This led to 19 January 2021 being the UK’s deadliest day, with COVID-19 killing 1,358 people. Therefore, the best way to test the efficacy of the vaccine is to see if the amount of deaths 21 days after a given date is comparable to the peak of the pandemic.

The death total from 19 January is 1.66% of the case total from 29 December. We can therefore assume that, at its worst point, COVID-19 in the U.K. had a 1.66% fatality rate. Since we assume that most contemporary cases are amongst the unvaccinated, the majority of whom are younger than average and do not have any vulnerabilities, we can hypothesise that this fatality rate has lowered over the last few months as those most susceptible to being hospitalised or dying with COVID have received at least one vaccine dose, and in many cases two.

On 15 May, there were 2,027 positive tests and 7 deaths. Positive cases have increased by about 8% since last week, but deaths have decreased by roughly the same amount. This is encouraging, but we need to bear in mind that on average, it takes 21 days for a COVID case to become a COVID death, and that this post is being written on the first day of widespread testing for the Indian variant. To get our current data, we must look at positive tests from 24 April and compare the fatality rate to the pandemic’s peak.

On 24 April, 1,524 people in the U.K. tested positive. 1,524 cases became 7 deaths three weeks later, which means the UK’s COVID fatality rate at the time of writing is 0.46%, less than a third of what it was at the peak of the U.K.’s outbreak. If the current trend of more cases and less deaths continues, our golden number will fall even lower.

&gt;However, the government's scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) says there is a ""realistic possibility"" it could spread 50% faster, which is a lot.

&gt;There are some higher estimates of 60% coming out of India, but these are based on published genetic sequences from viral samples and its not clear how representative of the overall picture they are.

&gt;Sage estimates the problems would really start with a variant that was 40% more transmissible as it ""would lead to a substantial resurgence of hospitalisations"" and put pressure on the NHS.

&gt;The uncertainty is reminiscent of last year when the new variant in Kent was first detected and raised questions about the approach to controlling the virus.

…

&gt;But it is important to remember we are not in the same situation as last year.

&gt;More than 19 million people - a third of the adult population - have had both jabs of their vaccine. Another 17 million have had one. Vaccines are weakening, if not eliminating, the link between infection and severe disease.

&gt;And overall cases are also far lower. The Office for National Statistics estimates fewer than 50,000 people currently have the virus. The figure was 1.25 million at the start of the year. Currently there are only around 1,000 people in hospital with Covid.

&gt;The concern is that while vaccines are great they are not perfect and not everyone who is vulnerable has had one. So if there was another wave of cases from the combination of relaxing and a new variant then a worrying number of people could still end up in hospital.

&gt;Note these predictions are not crystal balls. Earlier mathematical models had predicted a summer wave, but suddenly became far more optimistic once it became clear vaccinated people were less likely to spread the virus.

Yea, agreed. But new variants can pop up within the US anyways with the updated mask policies, making it more likely. 175 million Americans are unvaccinated, so that issue can arise without closed borders as well. Besides the Indian variant for example is already in the UK, and the US hasn't closed borders to the UK.  That variant can make it here, just like the dominant B1.1.7 UK strain did.

&gt;Unlikely to any significant degree. When something like 95% of the deaths are in the over 60 crowd

With 175 million still unvaccinated, and 33 million officially infected in the last year, there is potential for a surge.

Truth be told, I do think the flu is more deadly. Or at least on par with COVID, but prior evidence indicates that those without a vaccination have far worse symptoms, and the flu can even cause a pandemic (see last century). 

Now that we have a vaccine developed for COVID, and nearly 50% are vaccinated, it’s VERY similar to the flu in terms of danger to individuals. Yes, more people should be vaccinated in general for both viruses, but as a society, we need to stop catering to those who don’t want to be vaccinated.

The notion that the ""public"" can't handle information is why officials &amp; the media were saying that COVID is ""just the flu"" in February 2020. They did not trust the public to hear the truth -- that COVID had the potential to cause huge problems -- because they thought the public would freak out.

Same logic with masking. People like Fauci said that masks don't work, even going so far as to say that they may harm people who wear them incorrectly. As he has admitted later on, he didn't say this because he believed it. He said this b/c he was worried people would freak out and cause a shortage of masks for healthcare workers. He didn't trust the public enough to share his reasoning. Which backfired.

I think it's best to lay the facts out on the table, with all the caveats and uncertainties. Will some people misunderstand and distort a message for their own purposes? For sure.

I am saying that the CDC, by making this statement so soon, is inviting a lot of risk and abuse. I guarantee you that a lot more places are going to drop mask requirements and social distancing, and without vaccine card checks, non vaccinated people are just going to abuse the loosened restrictions. That could easily lead to an increase in cases again, and keeps this whole thing going at a higher volume. That does put us at risk. 

Anyway. I could be wrong, and I hope my concern is unwarranted, but knowing how people have been behaving in this country for the past 14 months, I could see it biting us in the ass. Right now we have the best of both worlds- a vaccine and reasonable mask protocols in many places. Take away those mask protocols and you better hope the vaccines are enough to protect us long term.

Deaths aren't my primary concern here. It is increasingly clear that COVID can have medium to long-term impacts of the health of adults and children who contract it. As a parent, is it responsible to expose your child to a virus that could diminish their ability to breathe and focus, or increases their risk of cardiovascular troubles down the road?

Costco themselves when they required a cloth mask or plastic face shield offered curbside delivery for orders. Which was an acceptable accomodation, during a pandemic.

Additionally, you know that there is a (pretty incredible for such a new vaccine) efficacy against covid so in this case, there is an option for you to manage risks by yourself to a degree. Getting any of the big four vaccines (J&amp;J, Pfizer, Moderna, AZ) is a route back to normal for all of us.

1. **inform your next of kin** (parents, spouse, kids, boy/girlfriend etc.) that you had the AZ vaccine on date x. Make sure they know the below symptoms.
2. **monitor yourself** \- the symptoms of CVST are fairly straightforward to spot:

* Headache.
* Blurred vision.
* Fainting or loss of consciousness.
* Loss of control over movement in part of the body.
* Seizures.
* Coma.

If these (granted this one might be a little tricky) apply to you after the vaccination, you need to get on the offensive. **Get in touch with a health professional!** The headache in particular is quite unique:

&gt;The MHRA has said that ‘as a precautionary measure, anyone who has symptoms four days or more after vaccination is advised to seek medical attention’.3 The symptoms that should prompt concern are a new-onset severe and persistent headache, blurred vision, confusion, seizures, shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, persistent abdominal pain, unusual skin bruising or pinpoint spots beyond the injection site.

[https://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/clinical-areas/pain/headache-after-covid-vaccination/](https://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/clinical-areas/pain/headache-after-covid-vaccination/)

3. **Do not hesitate to consult a health professional if you consider yourself at risk** early treatment is vital to a positive outcome.

In this instance, there is a positive prognosis:

&gt;""With the right treatment, most patients can have a full recovery after CVST, TTS or VITT.”

So I would say that if there is an option of taking the AZ vaccine and you're under 30, if decide to take it, you will almost certainly be fine, but, like any medication, be wary of side effects. Know what these are, inform yourself and, **under no circumstances, ignore any of the above red flags**. Additionally, again, make sure any of you closest friends/partners know you received it. Fixing this type of blood clot requires scans and tailored treatment and will result in a hospital stay but outcomes appear to be good.

If you were to wait for a Pfitzner/Moderna (mRNA) option, I wouldn't blame you for being risk averse but do bear in mind that whilst we have a good but not thorough understanding of the AZ vaccine, we have hints that covid infection may be a potential long term health issue for up to 10-20% of the infected: [https://www.gov.uk/government/news/185-million-to-tackle-long-covid-through-research](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/185-million-to-tackle-long-covid-through-research)

And in that case, yes it ***may*** be less dangerous to you as a ***young*** individual.

**BUT** here's the BIG caveat to that. COVID-19 overwhelmed hospital systems worldwide and brought many to the brink of collapse. Therefore, if it's true that the actual death rate is lower than currently thought, the fact it was still able to send enough patients to hospital to nearly collapse health systems means the infection rate is also significantly higher, and ultimately those two factors balance out and the danger of covid remains just as severe as is currently thought. If your health system collapses and you can't treat ANY patients then you're in a world of pain.

As to why Italy didn't notice for a while, future research will give us the answer but maybe variants gradually mutated over those 6 months to become more infectious and deadly until they were recognized as a threat. Maybe the exact nature of how COVID spreads on a societal level allows for this kind of difficulty in early detection.

Furthermore I have to wonder why we aren't concerned about mutations from other viruses? Why is it COVID-19 or more specifically SARS-CoV-2 which we worry about mutations escaping the vaccine, but not other viruses and their associated vaccines.

Polio vaccine came out in the 50s and in talking with my parents none of them remember talk about Polio mutating and escaping the Salk Vaccine.

[The masks are about 70% effective in protecting the wearer from COVOD-19](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2776536).  Let’s suppose that two mRNA vaccines are about ~95% effective against infection (which is what[Israeli ](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00947-8/fulltext) data show and I think we can extrapolate similar efficacy from the Moderna product).

So if I’m unmasked, my risk of *infection* on exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is already ~95% reduced.  If I add a mask to that, then I add an additional 70% of the remaining 5% or 3.5% for a 98.5% efficacy.  

But let’s remember that actual infection isn’t what’s important here.  What’s important is getting sick and hospitalized (or worse).  For that, the efficacy is 97.5% based on the same Israeli data above and so now the masks add less than 2% additional protection.

So those are the facts.  

Now, for my interpretation: there are costs to masks.  They are uncomfortable, they make it hard to read facial expressions, they’re a real problem for the Hard-of-Hearing and Deaf communities, and they generate a lot of waste that winds up in our wilderness and water.  So they are not a completely costless measure.

For me *personally,* that additional 1-2% decrease in absolute risk just isn’t worth those costs.  And so it doesn’t even matter if the guy next to me is vaccinated.  I have incredibly high protection even if he has COVID-19 and coughs in my face.

Now should that be *your* interpretation?  Maybe.  Or maybe you’re on B-cell depleting therapy and the vaccines don’t work well for you.  Maybe you’re otherwise medically fragile or have a medically fragile family member at home.  For those people, maybe they might interpret these data differently.

Nobody is talking about banning masks, so if you’re uncomfortable, wear a mask.

And failing that, there are third-party services like Instacart and DoorDash. 

&gt; If they can't wear a mask because of a medical conditon it is not their right to deny service.

Sure. The key there is that ""if"". And, as you have yourself proven (not sure why you're so keen to undermine your own argument, but OK), nobody is talking about denying service here. Just denying entry to the store.

&gt;As described in a new case study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, the patient was admitted to the emergency department after experiencing pain and coldness in his left leg for five days. He had received his first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine 20 days prior to the onset of his symptoms

&gt;Tests at the hospital showed that he had a low blood platelet count and extensive blood clots in his leg and lungs.

&gt;Dr. Paul Petrasek, a vascular surgeon and an associate professor at the University of Calgary's Cumming School of Medicine, says having blood clots in different parts of the body is commonly seen in cases of vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) but rare in other cases of blood clots.

&gt;""Usually, you just get a blood clot in one part of the body, but not in two very different parts of the body. So, his presentation to the hospital was typical of VITT, but VITT itself is a condition that has very unusual features to it,"" said Petrasek, who is one of the authors of the case study, in a phone interview with CTVNews.ca.",,,1621039038,{},gy5y0gy,True,t3_ncn2br,False,False,t3_ncn2br,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ncn2br/calgary_health_researcher_urges_more_awareness_of/gy5y0gy/,1621091683,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;In the past 24 hours, India had 326,098 new infections, taking its tally to 24.37 million, with 3,890 deaths, for a toll of 266,207, health ministry data shows. But the slow growth may also reflect test rates that are at their lowest since May 9. 

&gt;In Geneva, the World Health Organization’s chief said India was a huge concern, with the second year of the pandemic set to be more deadly than the first.

&gt;Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus's remarks to an online meeting came after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi sounded the alarm on Friday over the rapid spread of the disease through the vast countryside.

&gt;During the past week, the south Asian nation has added about 1.7 million new cases and more than 20,000 deaths in a second wave of infections that has overwhelmed hospitals and medical staff.

&gt;Police are patrolling the banks of the Ganges in India's most populous state of Uttar Pradesh to stop any dumping of corpses in the river, a government official said.
&gt;”We keep recovering 10 to 20 bodies every now and then,"" Navneet Sehgal, a spokesman for the northern state, which has more people than Brazil, told Reuters.
&gt;”We have put a police force on the river and have also sent communications to local authorities that this practice be stopped.""

Well that's not true, mRNA isn't inherently better than any other vaccine, by also using AZ the UK is ahead of the USA in terms of doses administered per capita, look at our daily death rate per capita compared to the USA, clearly the UK approach of using all available vaccines (which are perfectly good, one not better than the other) saves the most lives.

The UK has more doses per capita ordered than the USA does, so you are just misinformed on that.

[],,TowardsFitness,,,[],,,,text,t2_3rgju2mh,False,False,[],"Wow. That is a big rant without even reading what I am trying to say. 

1) I absolutely believe that vaccinated persons are at a low risk of being infected into a disease that is called Covid-19. This is in line with what the lancet and other peer reviewed journals say

2) However, none of the papers conclude that (and will never conclude) that a person fully vaccinated cannot carry and be a shredder of the virus known as SARS-Cov-2. This basically means while the vaccinated person might not get infected and surely not have a serious disease, he can potentially still transmit the virus through his mucus, saliva or droplets. There are zero papers that say vaccinated people SUPER RARELY transmit the virus. Agree the viral load is less, but we do not know today if the transmission risk is half or one third or one fourth vs a non vaccinated person. 

Read this https://www.livescience.com/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-college-trial-transmission.html

This is a study which just started and would take months to prove or disprove transmission rates in a vaccinated vs unvaccinated population. 

3) Coming to your accusation of me being a science denying person. In addition to lack of research on transmission risk (with trials underway) CDC isn’t the supreme god you believe it to be. It has been incorrect before.

https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/05/13/andy-larsen-biggest/

3) Coming to the 80-90% point. Given there is no vaccination for children currently, I never meant to include those in the target population. But when it does, &lt;17 group will be one of the highest adopters of the vaccine, in line with their other vaccines. The hypothesis is based on the fact that influenza vaccination rate is &gt;64% for the 6m-17 year range, ~60% for ages 18-64 and 65% plus for people aged 65 plus as per OECD data. And in a real world we can achieve those figures for sure. Agree 80% could be a stretch but it is needed by the nature of the virus

4) One more point which I would like to bring forward is that there will be some outliers in every society who have the potential to use this guidance to stop wearing mask even if they haven’t been vaccinated. And there is no way to trace the public in a mall, on the road, in a party to check each and every person not wearing a mask and verify if he has been vaccinated. Don’t you think this is a huge risk, again unless a majority of the population has been vaccinated? Don’t forget your so called “Covid deniers” and anti vaccine lobby would definitely be a part of the above group. 

Lastly, you accuse me of being against science even though is didn’t deny any findings from any scientific paper. I am happy to take back my statement of and when there is a paper that proves that the transmission rate in case of a vaccinated person is almost zero or negligible. And if such a paper exists today, please give it to me and I will apologise.",,,1621041590,{},gy62ijd,False,t3_ncewh1,False,True,t1_gy5pq7i,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ncewh1/trader_joes_updates_policy_customers_who_are/gy62ijd/,1621094458,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Saturday saw 165 community transmissions confirmed in the country, marking the highest number of Covid-19 cases in a single day since the pandemic broke out in Vietnam in January last year.

The new patients were recorded in Bac Giang, Bac Ninh, Lang Son, Vinh Phuc, Nam Dinh and the K Hospital in Hanoi and the central city of Da Nang, all related to previously confirmed patients and outbreaks.

Bac Giang recorded 85 cases, all linked to outbreaks at Japanese electronics company Hosiden and Quang Chau industrial park in Viet Yen District, which are now under lockdown.

The K Hospital, a leading cancer treatment facility, in Tan Trieu Commune in Hanoi's Thanh Tri District, which has been locked down since May 7, recorded 13 new cases - four medical staff and nine patients.

Da Nang recorded eight new patients, all linked to previous outbreaks. They are being treated at Hoa Vang District Medical Center and Da Nang Lung Hospital.

Bac Ninh Province recorded 16 new cases, all having been quarantined following contact tracing while Vinh Phuc had four new patients related to previous outbreaks.

Lang Son recorded two cases, who were in close contact with previously confirmed patients, and Nam Dinh recorded one.
Since the new wave broke out on April 27, Vietnam has reported infections in 26 cities and provinces.

The country has recorded 3,985 infections since the start of the pandemic, including 2,668 recoveries and 36 deaths. The latest fatal case was a 89-year-old woman recorded Saturday.

You mean having to wear a piece of clothe over my face that exacerbates my asthma ? My asthma is perfectly controlled as long as the mask is not on my face, with it on my peak flows drop. It's not an uncommon issue for those of us with severe asthma. 


&gt; But since your comment suggests your concern for yourself is so massive it leaves no room for concern of others let me remind you that we are a community


False I have continued to wear one despite the fact my asthma nurse has documented it exacerbates my asthma &amp; would legally exempt me from wearing one. I have followed the rules &amp; guidelines despite having been legally exempted from many of them . Not out of peer pressure but because I felt it was the right thing to do as the NHS was buckling.


&gt; say to the anti-maskers and the anti-vaxxers ""you're on your own"", what then? They'll cast off their masks because well, they're clearly idiots


They haven't been wearing them anyway so nothing has changed there.



&gt; We. Are. A. Community. We cannot write off the anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers less they become an anchor. We have to educate them and manage them and ourselves until we reach a real end on this pandemic.


Good luck with that, you can't even get Texans to agree whether chili should have beans, You sure as hell aren't going to convince knuckle dragging anti vaxers to change their ways. They'll get covid, gain immunity the old fashioned way if they surive. The consequences are their own and fundamentally the fence sitters are moving now the safety nets been removed.


&gt; People cant work, goods and services cant be produced and provided, resources drain, people working the problem become exhausted, shelves go empty and prices go up. Your vaccination doesn't protect you from any of that.

If almost everyone wears masks where you're at and you're supposed to wear masks, 80%-95% of people do.

When you say some people don't have to wear them, mask wearing doesn't drop to 64% (the percentage of people who aren't fully vaccinated), it will drop to 5-10% because as less and less people wear masks, less and less people wear masks.

That's fine if you're vaccinated or DGAF about COVID, but if you're a kid under 12, or immunocompromised, or haven't been able to schedule an appointment yet, you wearing a typical cloth mask only cuts your COVID exposure viral load by 50%. Most of your protection has been from mask adherence and distancing by others. With those gone, you're vulnerable again. And if you're a young kid, you can't wear an N95, or if you're under 2 you can't even wear a mask.

Even if you are vaccinated, the risk is still high enough and the cost of mask wearing is low enough that, statistically, you should still wear a mask. There's a much bigger chance of you catching COVID while vaccinated than getting in a car accident. But you still wear a seat belt, right?

So the problem isn't that the CDC parroted the reality that if you're vaccinated, you're pretty well protected. It's that the risk to you and needs of public policy are ENTIRELY different. We don't tell people that you're probably okay to drink 5 beers and drive because there's probably a low chance you'll get in a wreck, or that you probably don't need to wear a condom because MF heterosexual sex has a really low likelihood of you getting AIDS, or any other true statement. Public health is just that, public, it's about considering how a community will be affected, how people will behave, and what can be done to make us all safer.

CDC could have said we didn't need security theatre, we didn't need arbitrary capacity limits, didn't need random testing, all of this very tangibly expensive stuff. But instead of that, they ARE effectively getting rid of our cheap and effective solution of public masking, and the folks there are apparently SO out of touch that they didn't realize what they were doing in making this announcement.",,,1621042667,{},gy64e2s,False,t3_ncewko,False,False,t1_gy4oqqx,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ncewko/some_fear_the_cdc_is_moving_too_fast_in_lifting/gy64e2s/,1621095623,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The cdc isn’t using a set pre-determined number to determine the time to lift mask mandates. They have worldwide data that shows at what rate we need to be at to turn this thing around. They didn’t just decide because poor confidence in the CDC too lift mask mandates to appease us.

Saying CDC ""MAY"" have goofed and people will die from this. Well like I said, people can still die even if you remove mask mandates with 90% vaccinated. The 10% can still die from it. 

Any additional exposures due to the new mask guidance may be offset by the carrot effect that pushes those on the fence or being lazy to go get vaccinated ASAP. So while some people may die due to additional exposure, maybe more get saved due to an extra incentive to go get the vaccine. 

Your approach isn't very scientific at all despite your plea for science. How do we know the carrot effect isn't stronger than the risk of additional exposure due to no masking? 

That's why I keep saying, just because YOU think CDC goofed doesn't mean anything. Only way is to study the trend and see how it plays out. CDC may have made the right decision and incentivized people and it may actually save more lives. Immunity levels in the country are fairly strong now and those at risk who want to protect themselves can still mask and distance.

It almost seems like the vaccine gives the inverse symptoms compared to the virus itself. In that older people are more at risk from the virus while children often don't show any symptoms at all.

Why novavax? It doesn't turn my body into the last stage of the vaccine factory.

I'm sure the science behind the other vaccines is sound - just like the design and architecture of e.g. the first iPhone was sound.

The second version iPhone was much better, though. By the 3gs, they finally got it right and the 4s set quality in stone. 

That's for the world's richest (and arguably finest consumer electronics design) company with effectively infinite resources - working under considerably less pressure.

While Novavax's production procedure is novel - I like that as far as what my body sees, it's about as close to the ""dead virus"" tech we know and love as we can get (with good efficacy). Even simpler than that, in fact, as it's only part the virus.

That's my understanding, anyway. I'm very obviously not a doctor.

Now in the US the difference is that like 98% of the people who have got a first shot have got their second too. We will have to wait longer in Canada. But once you get someone in for the first one it is almost guaranteed they'll come back for the second.

It is so weird to see the back and forth. We had better guidelines in support in Canada where the US didn't.

In a follow-up to a March House-wide survey and interviews with members, CNN confirmed that 312 of the 431 members of the House -- just over 72% of the 431-member body -- have now received a Covid-19 vaccination. Of that, all 219 House Democrats have reported being vaccinated. Among the Republican conference, 95 of the 212 members -- 44.8% -- have said they are vaccinated.

The problem I have is the lack of options for enforcement and verification.

If his mask protected him adequately I’d also be okay with it, but n95 masks for kids aren’t a thing, and cloth masks work to protect others by limiting your own ability to asymptomatically spray germs on people.

As a parent, I’m far more concerned about long term conditions caused by COVID then I am death. And I feel like that is often glossed over. It also isn’t really true that we don’t shelter kids from things because of the risk of car accidents. We have car seat laws for children, including laws about type of seat based on age/size and when to rear face and when to front face. we have minimum ages for riding in the front seat of a car(in many places). We have laws about when a child (under 18) can start learning to drive, when they can drive independently, and when they can drive with other minors in the car. We also imply crossing guards on school walking and bike riding routes to prevent children from being hit by cars. So you know we actually shelter kids quite a bit to prevent car accident death. Maybe not so much flu, but at least for flu there are antiviral treatments and a vaccine that are both available for kids. I also think that we have to acknowledge that part of the reason COVID rates are so among kids is that kids were able to shelter in place/quarantine more consistently on average. Most kids I knew spent months literally never leaving the house. So many adults had to continue going in to work places as essential workers. Going back to school has been much more gradual. When a child in a school or childcare center gets shut down for 7-10 days (sometimes more). Does that happen when a grocery employee catches COVID? So of course it affects more adults then kids. I guess what is likely to happen is that families with means will continue paying more to order groceries, or leave kids at home with a stay at home parent or other caregiver when they need to go shopping or run errands, and parents that don’t have those options will be forced to take their children with them and potentially exposing them to COVID. Those same people can least afford the medical costs and lost wages that come with having a severely sick child or one who is mildly sick but must be quarantined for two-weeks or more.",,,1621106722,{'gid_1': 1},gy8vb9j,False,t3_ncvpro,False,False,t1_gy8fum9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ncvpro/what_if_it_was_your_kid_parents_of_young_children/gy8vb9j/,1621151771,114,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,

&gt;Our portion of the military that would be useful fighting a pandemic, just spent 18 months fighting a pandemic and needs a break.

the military is a big organization.

take a look at the assets here.. 

these are the guys who brought all the stuff for ***Desert Storm***

from the US to the Middle East.

and they're also really good at relief efforts.

***they are used to adverse conditions.*** 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60th\_Air\_Mobility\_Wing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60th_Air_Mobility_Wing)

Relief efforts kept the 60th busy. Beginning in August 1990, the wing provided airlift and logistic support to US and coalition forces in Southwest Asia, while continuing to perform worldwide airlift operations, including humanitarian missions to nations to Latin America and the former Soviet Union. In 1992–1993, commenced airlift in support of U.S. relief operations in Somalia during Operations **PROVIDE RELIEF** and **RESTORE HOPE.** It continued to support on-going operations in Southwest Asia during Operation **SOUTHERN WATCH.** The wing's elements also supported Operation **PROVIDE COMFORT** for Kurdish refugees, supported the evacuation of military personnel and their dependents from the Philippines through Operation FIERY VIGIL in 1991, and provided airlift support to Balkans peacekeeping missions beginning in 1995 with Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR, and continuing under Operations JOINT GUARD and JOINT FORGE. It deployed tanker and support elements to the European theater during Operation ALLIED FORCE from March–June 1999, as well as providing airlift support to other air expeditionary forces deploying to the operation.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And, even in the US we never sent in military assets into a hotspot until that hot spot started making intense mitigation efforts, turns out the US military isn’t willing to fight a fire that people are actively dumping gasoline onto.

the air force missed that memo.

Patient groups are tracking vaccine reactions in those who have received it via polling. There is a marked number of people who are having flare ups of their particular disorders that have been persisting for weeks to months at this point. For example, people with RA have reported having to go back on long term meds they may have been off of, or needing adjustments to their meds. In some cases, immunosuppressants are used, and so may blunt the effectiveness of the vaccine.

In my particular case, I have ME/CFS with POTS and MCAS. I have already been in a bad flare up of my disorder prior to getting vaccinated, so I’m trying to get it managed before I consider it. My household and I have been able to remain quarantined from others still, so the risk of getting COVID for me is extremely low. That’s not going to be a reality forever, though, because my husband will have to go back to in-person working in the not very distant future.

I have had a pretty significant case of my disorder for a very long time (more than 15 years) and if I got the vaccine and it exacerbated things any more, I’d probably kill myself. I can barely handle it as it is most days. I know a lot of people in my disorder community who feel the same way. People who are more significant risk for COVID because of exposure are getting vaccinated because getting it would be worse, but those who can avoid it for now are waiting to see what studies produce and what the recommendations are going to be for boosters and such. It’s a very fraught time. 

It would really be helpful if healthy people would get vaccinated to stop the development of mutations.

Kinda hard to sit in the pub for lunch with distancing &amp; masks. With masks gone the distancing rules will go promptly. You may enjoy sitting in a theatre masked up but few people do. The UK has trialled covid passport for raves, football, live shows etc. Movie theatres for example make their money on snacks &amp; beverages which no one will buy if they are masked.


Covid is aireborne, distancing is pointless if you have some one spewing rona in a confined space. Give it until June when the summer tourist trade starts &amp; you'll be hard pressed to find distancing restrictions retained. 



The CDC has clearly signalled their end game, drop earth shattering announcements to spur the lazy into action. The US covid victory party per Biden is July 4th, the American public has that as their ""independence day"" for Covid now also. Personally I have my trip to visit family in NYC planned now that the CDC has made clear the end game. I miss the US &amp; I have sacrificed a lot during this pandemic to protect others.



I continued to wear my mask despite the law saying I was not required. My asthma nurse went as far as offering to provide a letter for documentation as they excarbate my asthma.  I have sacrificed my career, wealth, social connections, familial bonds, my health &amp; my mental well being. All to protect society, my community &amp; my homeland when the risk to myself was non existant. When the NHS called for me to roll up my sleeve &amp; have the AstraZeneca vaccine I took it. Despite the fact the risk of a death via blood clots was higher then my risk of death from covid. I will once again roll up my sleeve in the coming week for my second jab which carries the same clotting risk to protect others. 


The UK curently requires it as the vaccination rates low so I will continue to do my part.

The other group you mentioned, those that can't get a vaccine, is incredibly small. The only people who can't get a vaccine is those who have a severe anaphylactic response to the covid vaccine or to other vaccines. According to cdc data, they found 21 cases of anaphalysis out of 1.89 MILLION doses. This gives you a whopping 0.001109139% of people in the study. The analysis response rates to other common vaccines is similarly tiny. MMR for example is 7 cases out of 20 million doses. 

While it might be philosophically comfortable to wait until the death risk is 0 to remove masks, ultimately some personal responsibility has to come into play given the widespread availability of vaccines. If unvaccinated individuals are prepared to die for their health choices and they don't pose a serious public health risk like overwhelming the hospital system, ultimately that's their choice. I don't think it makes sense for our entire society to try to cater to people who won't take care of themselves. I'm not sure it's there yet, but at some point this starts being a personal health issue, not a public health issue.

We know a very large percentage of people who already had COVID also have lasting immunity. These may not be 100% effective but nothing is. 

Overall, you take in the fully vaccinated group, the partially vaccinated group, the already had COVID group and you reach a very large percentage of the population having decent levels of protection built in. 

It was probably the right time to lift mask mandates for vaccinated. The math is supporting their decision. And of the remaining people who aren't protected, you have to factor in which group will never get vaccinated and mask up and which group needs a carrot.

But not for regular children.

Listen to Bill Maher about fear mongering over COVID in the media:
https://www.outkick.com/bill-maher-rips-liberal-media-on-covid-lies-inaccuracies/

Vaccines right now give adults maximum 95% protection. Adults with vaccines are STILL getting infected, but they just don't get hospitalized or die. Many people have gotten reinfected and can still transmit the virus. Bill Maher got reinfected after fully vaccinated. The shortstop for the Yankees got reinfected. Even my sister-in-law got reinfected even though she was fully vaccinated. This is not an uncommon thing anymore. So vaccines don't fully protect from reinfection, only from hospitalization and death.

Children naturally have 99.992% protection from hospitalization. Even if they got the vaccine, they will still get reinfected. How much more protection do you need over 99.992%? Getting the vaccine confers children 1000x LESS protection, and it still doesn't protect from reinfection, plus it carries the risk of some adverse reaction to the vaccine, including new potential allergies.

Canada currently has 43% with one dose, and polls show about 80% of Canadians would get a vaccine.

The United States currently has 46% with one dose, and polls show about 65% would get (or have already gotten) a vaccine. 

This originally started because you were asking why someone thought Canada would not slow down in its administration's of the vaccines like other countries had at similar levels. I  used the U.S. as a comparison, and the polls as an explanation as to why Canada will have a different uptake rate than the U.S. 

Additionally, the tweet I shared highlights that Canada is still accelerating our doses, where the U.S. when they were at a similar level for total population with at least one dose, had already significantly slowed down.

The goal here is to give some explanations as to why we will have a different experience in Canada with this vaccine rollout. There are other interesting points - for example, most Canadians under the age of 40 still don't have easy access to the vaccine, but that changes Monday where we open it up to anyone 30+ and then again a week after that where we open it up to anyone 18+. That's a somewhat large demographic, so we most likely will not slow down in administration for a while.

Does that answer your original question as to why Canada will most likely (and is already actually) having a different rollout than other countries (specifically the U.S.) when we compare total population with at least one dose?",,,1621097967,{},gy8d8wn,False,t3_nchdu8,False,True,t1_gy8bpvr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nchdu8/trudeau_government_begins_work_on_reopening/gy8d8wn/,1621142079,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,
