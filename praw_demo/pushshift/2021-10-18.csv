Immunity doesn't seem to explain the difference. UK's vaccination rate is 10 PPT higher than the US (66% vs, 56%), but total reported cases are a bit lower.

In other parts of the country (Florida) delta's pretty definitely over.  Those parts still account for most of nationwide cases which is bringing averaged numbers down.

The British Office of National Statistics doesn’t agree with your assessment.

&gt;	“However, today’s analysis shows that while there is some evidence of this so-called ‘mortality displacement’ among older age groups, it does not account for the significant excess mortality seen since the beginning of the pandemic.

&gt;	“In fact, we are yet to see any evidence that deaths in those aged under 65 or in private homes would have likely occurred over the following weeks or months, as deaths in these age groups and settings continue to be well above normal levels.”",,,,1634609169,{},hh6nnuv,False,t3_qau7fg,False,False,t1_hh6n0rk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qau7fg/uk_covid_cases_near_50000_in_one_day_as_no_10/hh6nnuv/,1634742781.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;UOL, in São Paulo 10/18/2021 6:08 PM   
&gt;  
&gt;The inventor of alcohol gel, Swiss health care physician Didier Pittet said he believed the coronavirus's tendency was ""to start running out a little bit."" Therefore, for him, it may be that an annual revaccination against covid-19 is not necessary.  
&gt;  
&gt;He explained that in the case of flu this happens because the virus of this disease is very mutable and there are different viruses. Also for this reason, the vaccine, in this other case, includes more than one type, and they are the ones that are most likely to create epidemics in the year.  
&gt;  
&gt;""As for the coronavirus, we cannot know even today if it will continue to mutate or make new variants. It seems that it probably will not,"" he said, in an interview with the newspaper Valor Econômico. And he added: ""this is part of a somewhat catastrophic scenario. But today we do not have the impression, based on scientific data, that this virus will behave like this. We are more under the impression that this virus will at a certain point start to if it wears out a little, if it goes out a little.  
&gt;  
&gt;The doctor emphasizes, however, that all surveillance is important since there is no definitive answer on the subject. The Swiss noted, for example, that there may still be ""one or two new variants"" and that, eventually, one of them may be able to circumvent the vaccines or reduce their effectiveness, which would result in the need for a new dose or even ""a vaccine A little different"".  
&gt;  
&gt;""That's not to say it's going to go away, but it's probably going to be part of the coronavirus family we've lived with for hundreds of years, without the need for vaccination every year,"" he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;From pandemic to epidemic In addition to being the creator of the alcohol gel, Pittet is chief physician in the infection prevention and control service at the University Hospital and the Faculty of Medicine of Geneva. The doctor is also chairman of the independent commission created by the president of France, Emmanuel Macron, to lead the pandemic in the country.  
&gt;  
&gt;The expert believes that the pandemic will become a pandemic when countries present greater controls of the disease and only have epidemic outbreaks, as is the case in Norway, where the situation is better. On the other hand, he emphasizes that the low numbers of vaccination coverage in the world maintain the pandemic scenario.  
&gt;  
&gt;""For example, in Africa vaccination is on the order of only 4% of the population, and there are less than 20 countries that have vaccinated 10% of the population. We will always be at risk of pandemic. Why is a vaccinated person protected, but an unvaccinated one continues not being protected, it threatens others and threatens itself,"" he explained.  
&gt;  
&gt;Therefore, for the Swiss doctor, it may be that in a few months we will have ""an uncontrolled situation in some places and new variants that are less sensitive to the vaccines we have"". In the case of Brazil, the sanitarist believes that if there are enough vaccines to revaccinate the entire population, this is a good initiative for 2022",,,,1634625754,{},hh7eal2,False,t3_qaxml1,False,True,t3_qaxml1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qaxml1/impression_is_that_the_virus_will_start_to/hh7eal2/,1634758916.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All cardboard boxes had to be put in plastic bags and then put in the trashcan. Like the virus couldn't survive on the plastic bags? That lasted about a month.

Included in the measures announced on October 18 is the introduction of a health pass to regulate access to events with large crowds.  
Boris Piotrovski, the city’s deputy governor, said that **beginning on November 1**, people will need to show a QR code to get into large sports or cultural gatherings with more than 40 people attending.  
People who have been fully vaccinated or who have had a negative COVID-19 test in the past 72 hours will be eligible to receive the QR code.  
**Starting on November 15**, the restrictions will also apply to swimming pools, fitness centers, theaters, cinemas, museums, and circuses.  
Restaurants and most shops will be included beginning on **December 1** in the city of some 5 million residents.  
**Cafes in stations and airports, pharmacies, and shops selling food will be exempted from the restrictions.**  
The city has reported the nation's second-largest number of new infections after Moscow.  


Why wait? QR code was tested during the summer, but that did not decrease the number of daily deaths. [worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/russia/)   


&gt;Authorities blame the fact that just 32 percent of Russians are fully vaccinated as officials seek to overcome widespread mistrust.  


And who to blame for that only 32% are fully vaccinated? Who are fiddling with numbers, downplaying the pandemic, ""everything is under control""-mentality, spreading anti-vax propaganda?

This is a request for helpful ideas on how to convince someone to get vaccinated.

My mother-in-law is hell bent on not getting vaccinated. This is rather problematic because:

- She lives in the country with the highest infection rates in the world right now. Patient triaging is a fact there already. The peak is still weeks away.

- She is working in kindergarten education, an extremely high risk environment.

- She is close to retirement age and has a medical condition increasing her risk even further.

- She is responsible for a teenager twenty years younger than his oldest sister.

- She has zero savings.

- She is facing dismissal from work. Vaccination will soon be legally required for all education professionals, the sanction being dismissal.

Other circumstances don't really help either:

- Both her very much sane adult children are abroad 2000 km away.

- She's not on speaking terms with her ex-husband. He's an alcoholic and has no ambition whatsoever of taking care of his minor son.

- Her mother is 82, sane, and so understandably not keen on meeting anyone unvaccinated.

- Her social circle is limited almost exclusively to the ""christian"" sect she's a member of.

- For some reason, she's even more decided not to get vaccinated than the sect leader.

- She's getting completely lost in facebook conspiration theories, to the point one of her daughters has reported her facebook account for repeatedly and deliberately spreading covid misinformation.

- She's most distrustful of mRNA vaccines.

I'd welcome any and all ideas and suggestions on how to get this issue out of my partner's way.",,,,1634642268,{},hh7x8tv,False,t3_qb613v,False,False,t3_qb613v,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qb613v/daily_discussion_thread_october_19_2021/hh7x8tv/,1634769799.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;On Monday, 49,156 new cases were recorded, marking the highest number in three months and taking the total number of cases to over 8.4 million in the U.K. The country also reported 45 new deaths within 28 days of a positive test, bringing the total number of fatalities to 138,629 — one of the highest death tolls in the world.

&gt;Meanwhile, hospitalizations and deaths have been steadily increasing since the summer when Covid restrictions in England were lifted on July 19. Pubs, restaurants and nightclubs reopened and mask-wearing became (for the most part) voluntary.

&gt;Thankfully, the numbers of hospitalizations and deaths have been rising at a much slower rate than earlier in the pandemic, largely due to Covid vaccines being highly effective at preventing severe infection, hospitalization and deaths.

&gt;Experts say there are a variety of reasons for the U.K.’s steep Covid numbers — ranging from the half-hearted mask adoption (even when masks are required, such as on public transport, the rule is rarely enforced) to large indoor gatherings that have allowed the virus to spread.

&gt;The U.K.‘s hesitation in vaccinating younger teenagers, something that other countries in Europe and the U.S. did much earlier, and the return to schools in September, have also been cited as reasons for the sharp rise in cases, although the boom in infections among 0-18 year olds is now ebbing as infections rise in their parents’ generation, data shows.

&gt;Perhaps most ironically, the U.K.’s early vaccination rollout — which began in December 2020 and was one of the first in the world — is also seen as contributing to its high case rate now.

&gt;That’s because we now know — due to an increasing body of data — that immunity in vaccinated people wanes after about six months. The spread of the much more infectious delta Covid variant in the spring and summer is also seen as a factor that has diminished vaccine efficacy.

&gt;Dr. Eric Topol, founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, tweeted his assessment of the U.K.’s situation on Saturday, stating: “Why does the UK currently have 6-fold hospital admissions and a 3-fold higher death rate compared with Europe? Among [the] possible explanations, two that stand out are less use of mitigation measures and less vaccination of kids, age 12-17.”

&gt;He noted that reliance on the AstraZeneca vaccine (where effectiveness has been found to decline slightly more over time than the Pfizer vaccine) as another possible contributing factor.

&gt;While, “another potential explanation is that the U.K. vaccinated earlier than rest of Europe, and therefore has manifest more waning of protection, especially among older people,” he noted. On a more positive note, Topol noted that “the U.K. has done far better than the U.S. for uncoupling cases from hospitalizations and deaths.”

I don't know what the endgame is either, but I know things do get better. We had that oh-so-brief window in June when cases were low and things were looking up. My city (L.A.) lifted our mask mandate and my family took a day trip to Vegas and ate indoors with masks off for the first time.

Now California just dropped to yellow, L.A. managed to avoid the worst of the Delta surge, and we're going to a movie theater this week for the first time since the start of everything. I get to see my 87 year old mother (who also has COPD) and severely immunocompromised niece without a mask now that we're all vaccinated. This WILL get better, we're just still in the middle of it and things change on what feels like a daily basis. I'm 51 and this is all new to me too, plus I have the stress of wanting to protect my family; not just my mom, but my partner and young adult kids too. It's been awful in so many ways but the changes we've had to make are outweighed for me by things like, my elderly mom and niece are still alive and haven't gotten sick.

This will end one way or another. We may have to mask up again sometimes, but (I believe) we'll keep having those windows and they'll stay open longer and longer. Maybe nothing will ever be like it was, but it won't be as dark as it was during the beginning.

They AREN'T shutting those people's lives down, COVID did that and also ACTUAL medical exemptions do count and no one ever said there will be no exceptions.

Religious exemptions are ignored for good reason, but that aside a medical exemption needs to be ACTUALLY TRUE.

For example DNA vaccines can hurt a lot of immunocompromised individuals due to outright risks outweighing the benefits. 

But there isn't just a single vaccine, a DNA vaccine like AZ/J&amp;J you can be exempt from, but not an MRNA vaccine for the same reasoning.

The fact is: Since there is 5 different vaccines to choose from, there is going to be effectively zero people where a medical exemption covers all 5.

When you mention natural immunity the problem comes back to exceptions.

We do not actually and never have actually cared if grandpa dies. Lockdowns were never meant to protect you, or your friends. Yes messaging sucks but they protect core infrastructure like hospitals, supply lines and liability to businesses etc etc etc. The cascade effect can be massive in scope. 

Unlike with a vaccine, natural immunity while it may be stronger does wane over time. How do you verify they have natural immunity? Did they get an antibody test? PCR? Rapid?

There is many companies doing those tests, so it adds confusions and layers of logistics and more checking. 

The fact is at the end of the day vaccines are easier to track and verify with known characteristics. 

I really wish we could stop talking about our individual protection or protecting others. Those are feel good emotions we use to try and reason with people to get them to protect ""Themselves"" and ""Others"" but at the end of the day that's not what actually drives decisions nor is it the point of a vaccine in general.

Vaccines protect public safety, which includes having functioning core infrastructure, a court system not riddled with cases due to liability, insurance premiums, supply shocks due to countries struggling and workers dying off etc etc etc etc etc etc etc. 

When we get muddled into the debate on personal protection people try to defend themselves by arguing they do not care about a virus, do not care about others, or it's their right. We unfortunately frame things in a way that gives people the ability to defend themselves when the entire point really has nothing to do with any individual person. 

Wrapping back to exceptions, as soon as exceptions exist people delay, wait or make bad decisions. Allowing exemptions for ""Natural immunity"" means the people unvaxxinated are going to rush to get infected, which adds cost to us all. 

Want a real reason vaccine mandates are the best even if natural immunity is better(Which it is, in some cases, after 6 months, but does wane, and vaccine reboosts that immunity to) is because it's easier to manage.

That's not to say that we don't actually have R &lt; 1 at times, but that's not due to the vaccine alone, we still have other NPIs that help with that.

Again I hope I'm making myself clear.  RT in the unvaccinated is through the roof, and vaccines reduce it significantly.  But after 6 months you're not going to have RT &lt; 1.

It is important that kids get the vaccines for which they are currently eligible, such as the flu vaccine, to reduce their risk of getting other respiratory diseases. And it’s important to remind kids of the basic steps they can take every day--washing their hands regularly, avoiding touching their nose and mouths, getting good sleep, eating healthy foods, and being physically active--to keep their bodies as healthy as possible.

The CDC also recommends, in areas with high transmission, that schools implement COVID testing programs for students, teachers, and staff.

While no vaccine is perfect, it is important to remember that all vaccines authorized or approved in the US remain extremely effective at preventing severe disease, hospitalization, and death.

It's a pretty confusing picture right now as studies looking at getting a variety of vaccines are still underway and no company has requested approval for their vaccines except as boosters for people who received their vaccines. An NIH study that we recently reported suggested that the mRNA vaccines might be the best choice as boosters regardless of what vaccine you received the first time around. It will take a while to sort this out and see what CDC recommends.

Regarding kinds under 12, I'll be watching as FDA, CDC, and their advisory committees review the data and make recommendations. It is important that they have the independence to do that work so that we can have confidence if a product is approved, that it is both safe and effective.

no other symptoms. i did a rapid test yesterday, negative, and did a PCR test today and am waiting for results

Hospitalizations, too. Deaths are finally dropping from their dismaying late-summer peak of more than 2,000 a day. Most people are vaccinated, and booster shots are gaining approval. Officials in the United States are hoping the worst of the pandemic is over.

U.S. coronavirus cases tracker and map

&gt;But so much depends on the virus itself. It is not static. It mutates. Delta, the variant of SARS-CoV-2 now causing virtually all infections in the United States, is more than twice as transmissible as the virus that emerged in Wuhan, China. The possibility of further significant mutations in the virus looms like a giant asterisk over any discussion of the trajectory of the pandemic.

&gt;In recent weeks, scientists who closely monitor the virus have said it still appears to have plenty of room to evolve.

&gt;”I see nothing that suggests this virus is quieting down,” said Kristian Andersen, an immunologist at Scripps Research. “I don’t think this virus is as transmissible as it can be.”

&gt;Scientists are tracking dozens of “sublineages” in the delta line of viruses, each with a slightly different array of mutations. One of those sublineages has spread with unusual speed in the United Kingdom recently and is gaining attention from researchers.

&gt;So far, there is no compelling evidence that any of the delta offspring have evolved into new, more dangerous variants. The attention-grabbing sublineage in the United Kingdom has taken several months to reach 8 percent of new infections there, so although it may have an advantage, it is not spreading with the kind of explosive speed seen with the ancestral delta strain, noted William Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

&gt;U.K. reported its biggest one-day Covid case increase in 3 months just as the new delta variant AY.4 with the S:Y145H mutation in the spike reaches 8% of UK sequenced cases,” Dr. Gottlieb wrote. “We need urgent research to figure out if this delta plus is more transmissible, has partial immune evasion?”

&gt;The delta subtype, known formally as AY.4.2, is reported to be 10-15% more transmissible than the standard delta variant, but it is too early to say for certain whether it has been causing a spike in cases in the U.K.

&gt;Professor of immunology at Imperial College London, Danny Altmann, told CNBC on Monday that the subtype “needs to be monitored and, so far as possible, carefully controlled.”

&gt;”Because delta has now been the dominant mutant in several regions for some six months and not been displaced by any other variants, the hope has been that delta perhaps represented [the] peak mutation performance achievable by the virus. AY.4 may be starting to raise doubts about this assertion,” he warned.

However, after World War II the Chamorro diet began to shift from locally grown foods to imported rice and highly processed canned goods, such as Spam®, corned beef, and Vienna sausage. The most recent dietary assessments of adults on Guam were conducted more than 20 years ago

&gt;“We did pretty well, I think, all things considered,” Dr. Ohm Deshpande, associate chief clinical office, said. “We’re at 94 at this moment who are subject to termination.” All 94 had been on suspension.

&gt;“They’re getting notified today that they’re being separated from the organization,” Deshpande said.

&gt;The number expected to be terminated had been at 225 a week ago, out of more than 28,000 employees. “Just over 700 have been granted exemptions,” Deshpande said. “Many more applied but not all of them received them. They’re the only ones who will get weekly testing.”

&gt;“I think in the last few days, people either got vaccinated or extremely delayed sent in their proof of vaccination,” Deshpande said. He said some may have gotten their shots at the last minute because they knew “we weren’t going to blink. In some ways it’s better than we expected.”

&gt;Deshpande said those who are being terminated can get back their jobs if they get their shots. “If they decide to get their vaccination we’ll welcome them back with open arms and we do have a number of vacancies,” he said.

&gt; Among those 17,500 patients, over 3,200 (or about 18.5%) had GI symptoms, the most common of which were diarrhea caused by intestinal infection, bleeding in the GI tract, and malnutrition. The researchers followed 715 of these patients after their release from the hospital, tracking their long-term symptoms.

&gt; Three months after their release from the hospital, 60% of this subset who suffered from malnutrition were still experiencing an inability to gain weight. Six months on, 56% of patients were still dealing with chronic weight loss. At this timepoint, the median malnutrition patient had lost almost 18 pounds compared to their weight at the time they entered the hospital.

&gt; The Northwell study’s findings align with Nichols’ experience of COVID-induced malnutrition, though she pointed out that her GI symptoms lasted for 18 months -- much longer than the six months the study tracked patients.

I think the US has also received less attention though in these classification efforts.

It'll probably be designated someday, but the effort we are putting into variant identification and track!ing is seriously disproportionate to its importance.

I think we just need to give everyone boosters after their 6 months are up, and just urge people to be careful over winter.
