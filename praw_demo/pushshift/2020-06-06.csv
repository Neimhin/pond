The Taiwanese official talked about a case that drew his interest: A disabled, stay-home wife of a man who worked in the wet market got infected with the coronavirus. Since she couldn't leave home, the only way she could get infected was from her husband who fell ill because of the disease. China officials finally begrudgingly admitted to him that human-to-human transmission couldn't be ruled out. That official went back to Taiwan and sounded the alarm right away.

September 2019 - PREDICT, a government research program, sought to identify animal viruses that might infect humans and to head off new pandemics. In a move that worries many public health experts, the federal government is quietly shutting down a surveillance program for dangerous animal viruses that someday may infect humans. The program, known as PREDICT and run by the United States Agency for International Development, was inspired by the 2005 H5N1 bird flu scare.

US notified Israel about coronavirus in mid-November 2019. An Israeli TV network claims that US intelligence agencies knew of an emerging coronavirus outbreak in China and gave Israel an advance warning in mid-November 2019, more than a month before clusters of infection in China started to be globally reported. US intelligence agencies had become aware of the outbreak as it spread early on in central China’s Wuhan City, Israel’s i24 news website cited a report by Israeli broadcaster Channel 12 as saying on Thursday. The agencies decided to warn US allies, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries and Israel.

a) The stress of the lockdown has helped contribute a lot to the degree of unrest that is now bubbling out in this just but poorly times series of protests.

b) The US simply cannot function collectively until the majority feel collectively threatened. For a while the news cycle from New York looked scary enough to push the average person to comply, but now it *'looks'* like the virus is reducing, so they feel no further fear.

c) The result of this combination will probably be a massive upsurge in cases, hospitalisations and deaths in the US, which will again terrify many back into lockdown, while others will just 'give up' and say its impossible to fight and try to go on with their lives normally. I doubt we will see federal or state action forcing a lockdown again until the numbers are well and truly out of control. So it will come down to the actions and choices of the population as individuals, as you might expect in the land of the Free.

So I now expect days with 3000-5000 deaths to become the norm for a while from late June onwards. I fully expect to see 250,000 dead in the US by the end of August and 1,000,000 dead by November. And more rioting, looting and shooting from all sorts of sides of the political fence.

&gt; This is no surprise given Qatar’s well-documented record of simultaneously exploiting foreign migrant workers and making solemn public pledges to improve their rights.



&gt; “We had no choice. We were forced to work on these flights or be fired. Managers would threaten us using abusive language, saying things like, ‘Take this flight or go back to your third-world country’,” said a Qatar Airways flight attendant from a South Asian country who did not want to be identified for fear of losing her job.


&gt; “Some staff with good looks or who are favorites of the management, especially Europeans, were asked to stage an act for CNN that (suggested) we were very happy flying health-care workers. They were paid very generously to do so, despite the fact that they didn’t necessarily serve on the flights or take any risks. But the (cabin) staff that were forced to work on those flights were given only threats.”


&gt; Analysts say the horror stories of freshly fired or under-pressure Qatar Airways employees reflect badly on a company that has played a key role in anchoring Doha as a commercial and international travel hub.

[],,Council-Member-13,,,,,,[],"&gt; I think you're drawing a false equivalency from what I've said, which is understandable because the nature of anecdotes tends to take big complex things and condense them down to a personal point of view.

To be fair, that is not a false equivalency *from what you said*. What you said/wrote was a sweeping judgment based on one observation. You may still be able to argue for your main general point, and it may also be true. But I was a bit handicapped here only having access to what you wrote. 

&gt; I would trust a public school over a Waldorf school because Waldorf schools shuffle bad teachers around very much the same way that the catholic church does with priests. Waldorf schools don't teach reading until much later because

So maybe that's the case in the American context (which I assume is your starting point)?  But, it is not the case where I am from (northern Europe), where individual Waldorf schools are independent self-owned institutions.

&gt; It's not an inherently bad approach (teaching creativity and appreciation of the arts is obviously good), but it's an approach that can easily lead to kids being unprepared for the real world. Waldorf graduates are usually successful but I'd put a wager down that this is more a result of advantages and privileges that come with the sort of wealth that allows them to go to Waldorf.

This is very speculative, and I do not think the data supports it. In my country, Waldorf schools are private, but they are not only for the rich since tuition is heavily subsidized by the state. This means, out of pocket tuition is about $150 per month for low-income families (to put this into context, an individual takes home (post taxes etc.) about $1700 per month from the govt if you're unemployed without insurance and have one child + child benefits). The result is that the composition of children/students is representative of society as a whole.

1. The vast majority of people were wearing masks and these events were outdoors. 

2. Most people who attended were young and low risk. While I can’t verify this for sure, I would assume that someone who’s immunocompromised or otherwise high risk would think twice about going. So would someone who’s currently experiencing COVID symptoms. Even just living with someone high risk would also hopefully put many people off from attending.

3. The numbers we were seeing in March/April were the result of completely uncontrolled spread for months. While these protests were big, they’re nothing compared to the number of people who were taking public transit, going to work in crowded offices, sitting in huge college lectures, packing into bars and restaurants, and attending big events like sports games and concerts every single day with no masks or other precautions before mid-March. Especially because those in high risk groups are now far more likely to take extra precautions and isolate themselves than they were previously.

I obviously can’t predict the future but I wouldn’t be surprised if we can avoid massive spikes from these protests, especially in hospitalizations and deaths.

I get that it's for essential services (though I'm not sure what high-risk, front-line services require cubicles and traditional office layouts), but if I were a business leader that had just gone through the nightmare of moving my entire operation virtual, I'd simply keep my workforce at home until a return to something resembling normalcy was deemed safe.

They are testing how effective a vaccine is for a range of viral load exposure. Lowest being someone who merely passes by a positive COVID case to highest being someone like a doctor/nurse that is exposed to the virus on a daily basis. (Wearing PPE).

It was at least another week before football shutdown and was followed by actual government instructions.

I went to that game aswel, I thought long about it. This was at a time when people were discussing the virus but rarely would you meet anyone who took it seriously. 

I’d been saying for a few weeks that we should keep our eyes on this and probably shut the boarders to be safe.

I was often laughed at by the smart, the daft and the carefree. It was hard to raise awareness, but it wasn’t here yet...

I didn’t touch anything from my front door to the metro and to the stadium except my seat. Toilets were difficult to get into as folks were lining up to wash their hands. Only saw 5-10 people with masks.

Hindsight’s wonderful. But nobody was in lockdown everyone was carrying on as normal.


Edit: It moved fast after this game and debates were had about the champions league games tues/weds and then Utd played Thursday. People were still flying and working as normal but folks really started to take it seriously. 

Prior to that the general consensus was we’ll be alright over this part of the world and you were laughed at or shutdown in all kinds of circles for suggesting otherwise.

I call that a slave wage somewhat to be hyperbolic but unlike reddit most of the working class world is not single children or 20 somethings with too much time on their hands. Though those people sound truly broken and despondent about their lot in life.

EVERYONE can contribute to something they are passionate about,  but we don't need every person running around pretending to be busy that doesn't give a shit.

60,000 opioid overdoses every year
40,000 flu deaths every year
15,000 drownings every year
That is:
175,000 deaths every year and all are preventable. 

I can keep going see...these are just US stats

500,000 cancer or cancer related deaths every year

All of these deaths require a change in behavior and safer habits to prevent so they are all preventable just like most Covid19 deaths are preventable. But if we haven’t cared enough about all those hundreds of thousands of deaths every year before, why exactly would 100,000 more be worth ruining the economy and shutting down an entire country?

Survival of the fittest. If you smoke for 30 years and get lung cancer and die, does anybody care? Nope, you knew better and smoked anyway. 

Same thing applies to eating healthy and getting exercise, and having good hygiene. If someone decides to eat pounds of sugar, drink nothing but energy drinks, and never work out, and spend half their life sitting on a couch acquiring a weak immune system, then goes out and uses a public restroom and doesn’t wash their hands and gets Covid19 and dies from it..... it’s somehow not their own damn fault? I call bullshit on that, with 35% having no symptoms at all, and the remaining 64.95% fully recovering, the risk does not warrant the proposed action. 

It’s time to reopen, with better hygiene for sure, and if you feel at risk, then YOU stay home.
