To play devil's advocate a bit - part of the reason there is hesitation to propose boosters is that the messaging the CDC wants to give is that the vaccines are highly effective and provide sustained protection. The logic is that people are more likely to take a highly effective vaccine than one viewed as low efficacy - or one that will require multiple true-ups to be effective. It's one of the reasons that so few people (relatively speaking) take the flu vaccine. 

I take a more pragmatic view that we have already essentially hit our vaccination ceiling. We're down to about 250K first doses a day - and within a week we will be seeing more antibodies being ""earned"" the old fashioned way (infection) if you assume a 5-6X undercount rate (which is a very reasonable; historically it was 3-4X but unvaccinated are less likely to test). 

In my opinion, the only way we are going to see a cataclysmic shift in vaccination rates is through more aggressive incentives (positive or negative) to get them. But in the US, such an incentive scheme (stimulus tied to vaccination status or vaccine passports) are highly unlikely to occur. At best we may pick up some soft employer mandates once the vaccines are fully approved. 

So, short of simply exporting our vaccines to countries in need (which, in fairness, is the humanist view - we can do more statistical good by vaccinating elderly in poor countries) - we should put them to work. We're wasting hundreds of thousands of doses every day as is because vials are only getting 1 or 2 doses pulled out of them before they go bad.",,,,1626393948,{},h5c76hd,False,t3_okqhlw,False,False,t1_h5c68ir,/r/Coronavirus/comments/okqhlw/us_is_losing_time_in_vaccination_race_as_delta/h5c76hd/,1626560522,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Patients who were much more tenuous were transferred out to the floor way earlier than they normally would in order to open an icu bed, older patients with a high risk of mortality were not transferred up to the icu, nursing was not required to document as much as typical and were way overworked which opens the door for increased chance of medical error, patients were transferred to hospitals that don’t typically see patients with that level of acuity. People who needed surgeries were cancelled to open the beds for covid patients (including things like valve replacements etc). 
Even now, the life saving ECMO treatment for severe covid cases is not offered to as many people as before due to the high demand - our state’s hospitals who use ecmo created parameters for who can qualify for it because they were getting way too many calls for people who needed it than they can accommodate.

We know that the overwhelming majority of young people do not develop severe symptoms and so are not hospitalised

You need to understand that just because someone is vaccinated doesn't mean that they cannot catch it.
You need a very high percentage of the population vaccinated before herd immunity starts hampering the progress of a virus through the population.

If anything, the opposite is true. The vaccinations mean that the older variants struggle to spread, so a selection pressure occurs against existing variants.

In addition, Merck, the original patent holder of ivermectin, has released the [following statement](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/):

&gt; Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today affirmed its position regarding use of ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

&gt; * No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

&gt; * No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;

&gt; * A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.

I'd be curious to learn a bit more about transmission rates for flu when masked - does everyone need to be masked to get decent protection (like with covid), or does is the vulnerable person wearing a mask offer good enough protection? Could we get by with thinner masks that would make it easier on people like you that seem to hate the idea? Are there other measures that may be simpler but more effective than masks? All good questions worth looking into whenever we make it through covid. 

But remember that we're still in the middle of a rapidly changing virus here - if it keeps spreading like this, we're likely to get a variant that affects the vaxed and/or more vulnerable people. Wearing a mask now will absolutely help slow the spread and ideally help keep us from having another full blown lock down.

Also, you understand that California has its own laws and state constitution, which goes a lot further in protecting individuals' civil liberties than federal law, right? 

Like, under federal law, a business can refuse service to someone wearing a swastika or a pro-choice t-shirt and probably someone with a bunch of tattoos or piercings. That's potentially a violation of their civil rights in California. Under the US Constitution, the right to freedom of speech generally doesn't extend onto private property, but that's not the same with the  right to freedom of speech under the California Constitution.

Also due to new fuel regulations that came in place last year SOx emissions are already down a ton version previously. Most of the time when you read about how cruises are horrible it’s because they’re comparing the emissions per person only for a flight versus the cruise which is stupid because the cruise ships function as a large mall and hotel and casino in addition to just being a travel vessel. They’re also using older pollution data from before the new regulations came into place and scrubbers were put on.

Yes, there are signs of organ damage in people with even asymptomatic infections, but remember, the mild symptoms just relate to our immune response to the infection, i.e. they're not necessarily proportional to the damage that is occurring inside our bodies. If this damage becomes significant enough, then we get symptoms from that too, which is when it starts to go from mild, to hospitalisation!  


Given that vaccines reduce hospitalisation risk by about 90-95%, I'd expect similar efficacy against this form of long covid. But of course there's another type of long covid where it's believed a rogue antibody is generated in response to the covid infection, that then continues to attack our bodies long after the infection is cleared. Given that a vaccinated immune system HAS templates for antibodies to attack the virus, it's less likely it will produce a new rogue antibody, but it can't be ruled out I guess.  


In short you're right. Vaccines don't make us invincible and risks remain, both of dying, and of long term issues. But imo and certainly if you're in good general health, the risks now are pretty low and it's just another thing in the world that *could* kill you, but probably won't - at least until a new killer variant comes along ;)",,,,1626388970,{},h5bxarj,False,t3_ok8ujs,False,False,t1_h5bun9y,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ok8ujs/doctors_investigate_rare_covid_breakthrough_cases/h5bxarj/,1626554971,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

In a world where Delta is widespread but not more virulent than other variants, SARS-CoV2 (with widespread vaccination) will come to resemble any of the other common cold coronaviruses, mostly benign, with occasionally a bolt-from-the-blue severe infection, much like flu. I think after 2020 everyone just needs to see the data play out for a little bit to convince themselves of it. In this sense I am excited about the UK reopening because we'll get to see this play out in real time at a large scale (much larger than Israel).

When I take off my optimistic hat, my worry is there actually is no plan, never has been, and likely won't be. It's one thing to shut something down/take something away (closing the border). It's another thing to develop a forward looking plan that achieves a positive result. This govt doesn't have a strong track record on the latter I'm afraid. But the phenom appeal of the PM will mean that the strain of the border closure by all (business, people inside and outside the country) will be felt for much longer than it ought to be.

To be clear, I think the govt did an outstanding (world-beating) job in 2020 keeping people safe. Nothing I say should be seen as taking away from that. I also think the vaccine rollout has been too slow. We're at a point now where NZ's primary supplier (Pfizer) is talking about getting approval for a booster in the US, when they haven't filled their international orders yet. If I were in NZ, I'd be wondering what pressure the govt was applying to Pfizer to deliver on its obligations. In Australia they had to rope in a prior PM to help with that. I worry that in NZ, the culture of ""well we'll just accept our lot and not question it"" coupled with the govt's popularity has hindered any legitimate critical analysis or sense of urgency.",,,,1626388958,{},h5bx9w8,False,t3_okl2vp,False,True,t1_h59exw1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/okl2vp/melbourne_to_enter_snap_covid_lockdown_from/h5bx9w8/,1626554956,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Several ways, the earliest ones were with controlled study, where the principle investigators would recruit volunteers who fit the requirements, then randomize them to control and test. So with large enough numbers in the group, you'll get equal distribution of people who live in mask mandate/no mask mandate, how many infected around them, location of the world, variants etc.

That's pretty good but nothing beats the real world. So once plenty of people get vaccinated post-market, Doctors and study coordinators would gather data and monitor who those were vaccinated were infected, and compare that again the general population. Again it's measuring people within the same population, but could start to see some departure, for example older people were vaccinated first. As variants breakthrough the vaccine protection, this is how we're getting the latest data, and so far has been fairly effective.

[],,SweetTacular,,,[],,,,text,t2_5aq2bswb,False,False,[],"It’s not exactly a shot in the dark to suppose that transmission is reduced in the vaccinated. We know that lower viral load, for instance, generally corresponds to lessened ability to transmit; and we know that getting vaccinated significantly reduces viral load in those who even get infected (and remember, many vaccinated people don’t at all) — so it’s not an unreasonable inference that the vaccines reduce transmission in that way, at least.

I guess you’re right that we’d need mass asymptomatic testing to *know* about transmission in the absolute sense. But I’m not convinced that we do need to *know* in that absolute sense. This is where our points of concern diverge. I think you’re needlessly fixated on all detectable presence of COVID in the population, vaccinated or not. I’m more focused on the severe outcomes like hospitalization and especially death. Is your concern with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic vaccinated people spreading the virus to other vaccinated people, who will themselves almost certainly develop similarly no and/or mild symptoms, if they get infected at all? I don’t get what we’re so concerned with here. This is an inevitability and we knew it would happen from the beginning. Even if transmission wasn’t reduced by the vaccines at all, the reduction of severity is still very real and extremely effective. I guess the transmission question is more important if you’re trying to reach the unattainable goal of zero or almost zero COVID spread; but what’s far more likely is that as more people get vaccinated, more vaccinated people will get infected, but those infections will be mild.

""NFL reveals extensive restrictions for unvaccinated players in training camp COVID-19 protocol""

""Unvaccinated players may not leave the team hotel or interact with people outside the organization while traveling, both of which vaccinated players are permitted to do. Any unvaccinated players found to have broken theses rules could be fined $50,000 by the league or their respective teams for a first offense.""

Players who are not fully vaccinated must also travel on a separate plane.  
Among the other notable restrictions:   
Players who have not been vaccinated are not permitted to eat meals with teammates.  
Only 15 unvaccinated players can work out in the weight room at a given time.   
Unvaccinated players may not use the sauna or steam room.  
Unvaccinated players who come into close contact with individuals who test positive for COVID-19 will be subject to a mandatory quarantine.

The only thing that will work on some people is to actually see a loved one battle through a severe case of covid. Even if we keep making restrictions there are just too many people who will not follow CDC guidelines while the rest have to put their life on hold for who knows how long. We can drag out the pandemic for another 3 years or just hope for herd immunity by next spring. If we keep reinforcing restrictions it will just delay the inevitable. Even LA county is only about 50% fully vaccinated, there is really no hope with a lot of folks.

&gt;  
&gt;the way that they're commonly used  
&gt;  
&gt; and outside of models, sure. But the way I see everyday people use them, I worry they're providing a false sense of security.

The argument that was made last February/March, and being made in the post I was responding to, is that people touching their masks is a big issue because they might have COVID formites on their hands and they'll transfer it to their face and get themselves sick that way. We quickly learned that formites aren't the main way COVID is spread and that argument no longer makes sense.

The fact that we never really had a good campaign to educate people about what masks are good and how to properly wear one is an issue, I agree. That's an area we should be doing better in. Though I'd counter by saying that dirty masks or poorly fit N95s are still a whole lot better than nothing. But that's a separate issue from this

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;the masks most people use that they touch multiple times a day with dirty hands is just absolutely worthless, or even harmful.

Because as long as you have decent hygeine and don't work in a COVID ward you most people aren't gonna have COVID on their hands and it does not matter if they touch their face sometimes.

There are several problems with the East Asian mask analogy. For starters, masks have only been *required* during disease outbreaks like the current one. Anytime else, flu season or not, they're strictly a personal choice. I guess this is what we're seeing right now in the majority of the United States. As an Asian-American myself who has been to East Asia on multiple occasions, I've never actually worn a mask there.

Its acceptability is also questionable, as it can reinforce the ""model"" minority stereotype. East Asians aren't naturally or genetically predisposed to follow the rules and excel academically.

The only [evidence we have](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ojj32i/progressive_increase_in_virulence_of_novel/) points to it being substantially more deadly.  But vaccines also reduce that such that CFR and IFR should both be overall reasonably lower than last spring.

Based on the timeline of cases rising (mostly over the last week), I don't think we'd expect deaths to rise yet.  But there's also no possible way around deaths rising; if we have a 1.0% CFR (note that IFR should again be decently lower than CFR) and we had 10,000 cases a day a month ago that would be 100 deaths ""for that day"", and if we now have 40,000 cases a day that's up to 400 deaths ""for this day"".  But those deaths may not happen for weeks or months (which is why we have a lot more than 100 daily deaths for that whole time period - many of them were from cases of much longer ago still when case counts were way higher).

&gt; And of course this is AFTER you had a ~10% chance or so of catching covid in the first place

Well, you had a 10% chance of catching COVID because everyone wore masks and stayed home for a year.  If we're done with that and have a R(t)~1.5 now then you end up with more like a 40% baseline chance of catching COVID.  This is in turn reduced by 80-90% for vaccination (probably similar for previous infection) against delta, and then chance of hospitalization/death is reduced by a much smaller factor if you do test positive.

The correct way to think about COVID attack rates is that if we did nothing, 90%+ of the population would catch it.  Making arguments based on fewer catching it because we prevented them from doing so is bad logic.  Vaccination essentially counts toward that 90%, and can even lower it significantly (since there's less final reproductive rate and thus less gliding after exceeding herd immunity).",,,,1626470347,{},h5g0tw4,False,t3_olbl51,False,True,t1_h5f8mu2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/olbl51/daily_discussion_thread_july_16_2021/h5g0tw4/,1626635075,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Those facts are now baked and we need to pivot into boosters and decide what the proper 95th percentile of time is from last shot and get on with it.  Then we can update the protocol saying if you get a vaccine today you get 3 shots  2 in 4 week back to back and another 6 or 9 months out.  This again is not unheard of for some vaccines.

Not quite, although you're sort of correct. Each individual virus has an equal chance of mutating, but those vaccinated have a much lower viral load. Much fewer individual viruses in a person means the chances of a mutation is much lower than in someone with no/low immunity.

As everything with this pandemic, it's a balancing act. Opening up or closing seems to be the thought processes going on, which seems to me to be a bit careless when balancing.

Check out this 
[great article about how unlikely it is for ""long term"" side effects from the vaccines to show up a few months or years later.](https://www.chop.edu/news/long-term-side-effects-covid-19-vaccine)

The J&amp;J vaccine manufacturing mixup that you heard about [isn't a problem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/mhhf8x/johnson_johnson_statement_on_us_covid19_vaccine/) There are no tainted or flawed doses from J&amp;J being distributed, all our doses of J&amp;J came from a different manufacturer in the Netherlands and are both safe and effective.

Vaccines given EUA are safe even if you hear about [clotting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mh39g4/blood_clots_and_the_az_vaccine_revisited/) or [growing a third arm.](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/12/04/get-ready-for-false-side-effects)

That the vaccine manufacturers are not liable (you can't sue them, etc.) if you die from their Covid vaccine is a [logical error], that's [true of all vaccines, and really, most medical practices/drugs/etc.]  They just have to warn you about potential risks, [which they actually do a good job of, even though those risks are miniscule.]  Note that this would also be the case (you can't sue them if it hurts you) for any future ""cures"", therapeutics, or other treatments for the disease. 

The vaccine isn't killing anyone. You heard wrong.  Great discussion [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/oc45h0/scientists_quit_journal_board_protesting_grossly/) 

Clotting is so rare from the vaccine and so common from the virus, it's basically not worth talking about.

Should we be excited about a vaccine [that's not 90%+ effective?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lv3h8e/daily_discussion_thread_march_01_2021/gpbwgkf/) Excellent question!

It's too soon to say ""lifelong"" but [that is a possibility.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l4nkco/the_immune_system_mounts_a_lasting_defense_after/) 

Immunity from the vaccine [lasts *at least 6 months*,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l9nfu8/stable_neutralizing_antibody_levels_six_months/) probably a lot,[ lot longer,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/k6a6pq/durability_of_responses_after_sarscov2_mrna1273/)  probably many years. It's looking like it'll be permanent or [semi-permanent in a good portion](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m1xbz4/sarscov2_mrna_vaccines_induce_a_robust_germinal/) of the population.

Vaccine induced immunity may be [comparable to](https://www.verywellhealth.com/antibodies-from-vaccines-and-from-natural-infection-5092564), or [better than](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l5whhu/increased_resistance_of_sarscov2_variants_b1351/), or a [LOT better than](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m8m23c/neutralizing_antibodies_against_sarscov2_variants/), immunity from a previous infection. Especially to [Alpha/Beta.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lgxpre/vaccineinduced_immunity_provides_more_robust/) Natual immunity from clearing an infection is highly protective of future infections, but you have to risk the disease in order to get it. 

The OG SARS virus (SARS-CoV-1) from 2003 gave detectable immunity [both 6](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/186/12/7264) and [12 years later.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kvbz9y/weekly_question_thread/gizs32j/)   

Vaccination and previous infection [reduce viral load, which reduces spread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2On6TTGdixc#t=7m59s). Updated info [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ocygyp/vast_majority_of_breakthrough_infections_in/)

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lbrb9m/oxford_astrazeneca_data_again/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) article does a good job of explaining the likelihood of vaccines *at least* reducing spread.  [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lf744r/daily_discussion_thread_february_08_2021/gml0gyi/) may help too. Data from [Scotland](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m3tx1n/covid19_vaccine_linked_to_a_reduction_in/). 

[""Moderna vaccine blocks &gt;90% (87-93%) of infections &amp; 91% (89-94%) of transmission.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfxpir/daily_discussion_thread_february_09_2021/gmqfk4q/)

 This [suggests](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfnipv/initial_real_world_evidence_for_lower_viral_load/) a great reduction in ability to spread the virus. [Maybe even with just one dose!](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2036242) You should [get both doses though.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m2mtnv/immune_response_to_sarscov2_variants_of_concern/)

Reinfections are rare, some studies show [less than 1 in 1,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kyj0bx/sarscov2_reinfection_in_a_cohort_of_43000/) (maybe in the 1 in 10,000 range, you'll have to read the study, it's awesome).  Reinfections tend to be much milder than previous infections, even those new variants. Check the [comments here](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lm0mc2/prior_covid19_significantly_reduces_the_risk_of/) for some really interesting discussion regarding reinfection.

[Delayed second doses are fine.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/layx6g/single_dose_administration_and_the_influence_of/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) At least with [ChAdOx1](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lbrb9m/oxford_astrazeneca_data_again/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), though there is evidence from the mRNA vaccine trials that suggest that up to 6 weeks is better if not at least acceptable. The problem is that you have to wait longer for the second dose, and therefore, full protection. [CDC](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lbiqne/daily_discussion_thread_february_03_2021/glvp1nl?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) used to say that there is no maximum interval between doses, but has recently changed. [Pfizer says not more than 6 weeks](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/liakcb/covid19_vaccine_doses_shouldnt_be_more_than_six/). 

[Dose intervals might increase efficacy if extended past 3 or 4 weeks,](https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/mudvjd/questin_about_vaccine_intervals/gv58byt/) CDC says you have up to 42 days between doses (but that may be extended at some point).

Did you accidentally get mixed doses? [All good.](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html)

Even if your antibodies fade over time, [you still have immunity.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/npeymo/sarscov2specific_memory_b_cells_can_persist_in/)

It's not. It takes longer than that. I see where you are going though.

It takes days for a short term response, but longer to form a sustained and lasting immunity. It gets really complicated really quickly past this point, and to be honest, I only understand portions of it.

Think of it this way - if all of the US was vaccinated (not plausible at the moment but lets think in ideals), then it would be EXTREMELY difficult for any outside variant to make its way here, spread through the population, and affect the vaccine effectiveness on a mass level. If it did get here, vaccinated people would be less likely to spread it despite the decrease in vaccine effectiveness (because 60% is still better than the 0% without the vaccine) so it wouldn't go very far, and even if it did, it wouldn't cause as much damage. Right now you're seeing some vaccinated people getting hospitalized and dying, but at such a minute rate compared to unvaccinated people, so were we all the be vaccinated, its likely we wouldn't see even close to that minute rate.

So yes, everyone else in the world not being vaccinated is also a problem for us, but we would be a lot safer if we had herd immunity within the borders of this country to prevent more spikes in cases, such as the ones that are already happening.  It's kind of like saying, ""well /I/ don't smoke, so I have no risk of lung cancer, while the people I live with smoke and their actions don't affect me so I won't stop them from smoking"" - the problem is, yes they do affect you, particularly because they are so close to you (within the US vs the world), and they can give you lung cancer even though you're protected via not smoking (the vaccine).

Not to mention, even if they didn't affect your personal health, they are now taking up hospital beds due to not being vaccinated that now can't be used, so not only are the unvaccinated hurting themselves, they are also hurting others who need a hospital bed but will die without it due to hospitals going back up to full capacity.",,,,1626453319,{},h5exdu9,False,t3_ol4mvd,False,True,t1_h5erl1f,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ol4mvd/after_a_steep_plunge_in_covid19_cases_every_state/h5exdu9/,1626612043,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,True

Well, it'll end when people stop acting like children and do what is being asked. Wear a mask, get vaccinated.

&gt;Macron said that from 21 July anyone wanting to visit a theatre, cinema, sports venue or festival that had an audience of more than 50 people would need to show a health pass proving they were either fully vaccinated or had tested negative.

&gt;The same requirement will be extended to bars, cafes, restaurants, shopping centres, hospitals, long-distance trains and planes from 1 August, the president said. Free Covid tests, meanwhile, will end in September, “to encourage vaccination”.

&gt;In an address watched by 22.4 million people, Macron also said vaccinations would be mandatory for health workers, retirement home staff and all others working with vulnerable people, with sanctions for those not fully vaccinated by September.

It's going to have to be voluntary for businesses, otherwise it will create a huge mess, both politically and legally.  But California also makes it really easy to sue a business if they illegitimately deny you equal treatment, so what happens when someone from out of state or who doesn't have access to the system (maybe they can't afford a smartphone or a computer) gets denied equal treatment at a business. That's a prime case for a civil rights lawsuit under Unruh.

But more problematic, which businesses are actually going to voluntarily comply? Stationing a worker at the door to enforce a passport costs them money and is likely to decrease business and increase liability for injuries and civil rights violations, so I would imagine that most of them wouldn't participate. After all, as bad as being the mask police was, it was relatively easy to see if someone was wearing a mask. It's a whole other issue to help every 90 year old lady figure out how to pull up her passport on the computer-phone-thingy.

I have only have a fever (100) and nothing else for 3 days now and tested negative yesterday morning. Hoping that means no COVID but nurse said I could test negative early on. Is that true if I'm showing symptoms?

I'm vaccinated and have also been very careful as my daughter is 3 and unvaccinated. The worst we've done is we went to outdoor aquarium and didn't realize how crowded it would be. No masks for us and she won't wear one (never went anywhere with her where she was near folks so no need). She loved it but regret having to weave through people at times.

We also sat outdoors as a restaurant once. The server had a mask.

That's literally it. I go grocery shopping early in morning once a week and wear a mask at that, wear one at work and anytime I go somewhere. Of course, no one else is anymore so I suppose now I am able to catch more of anything.

What's likelihood this is COVID and I had false negative? What the hell also could I be getting that beat my mask or attempts to sanitize hands I guess.

It's a bit of a strange sickness in that it's really just the fever and achiness (related to fever I think). Some sinus pressure but no stuffiness or anything. No respiratory issues. Nothing else is wrong but my fever.

I'm just wondering if the real vaccine efficacy is different than originally stated due to environmental circumstance. Say the initial study is done with vaccinated individuals living in a largely unvaccinated population with masking and other mandates while variants a &amp; b are in the wild. This would be different than vaccine effectiveness measured in an environment say with no mandates, 50% vaccination rate, and variants a, b, c, &amp; d in the wild, right? 

I'm just curious if we might see more breakthrough cases and have a change in the noted efficacy of the vaccine as mandates are being removed. The ideal situation would be 100% vaccination rate, but many states in the US still have a ways to go to even reach 70%.

No one in the vaccine group had any trouble with their pregnancy over the course of the study. They also tested it on female rats and did not find any problems, either with fertility or pregnancy.

The Pfizer vaccine FDA report doesn't give a nice summary like this, but they do report 23 people became pregnant during the trial. They report 2 adverse events related to pregnancy, both in the placebo group.

Both companies say they will continue to monitor pregnant people. In general, there is no know reason why a vaccine would affect fertility. I don't believe any ever has before.

Even in unvaccinated people, not everybody who is infected will necessarily transmit it, for a variety of reasons. There isn’t enough data to make any concrete quantifications of transmission post-vaccine, but it’s not unreasonable to infer that vaccination significantly reduces transmission, even if it doesn’t make it zero. We have to stop thinking of things here in terms of simplistic, broadly applying absolutes. 

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2107717

Here’s one short analysis from last month, suggesting that the transmission rate was 40%-50% lower in vaccinated households — and in most cases, those in the “vaccinated” households had only had one dose. It’s very likely, based on everything we know so far about the vaccines, that the second dose reduces the risk of transmission even more than that. Is that a definitive analysis? No. More data is needed. But the present preponderance of the evidence points to the likelihood of transmission post-vaccine as being nonzero, but also likely being quite small. 

And more importantly, transmission within a majority-vaccinated population is not only inevitable as COVID becomes an endemic disease and more people get vaccinated overall; but also, mere infection becomes less important of an indicator over time. It will still be a threat to the willfully unvaccinated, but they’ve made their decision and assumed that risk of their own volition, I’m not sure what the solution is there.",,,,1626455536,{},h5f2lyk,False,t3_ol1wvl,False,True,t1_h5eydyq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ol1wvl/yankeesred_sox_postponed_due_to_covid19/h5f2lyk/,1626614970,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Here are a few things other countries do.

Public transportation reduces the amount of traffic and also traffic fatalities. Reducing traffic also reduces pollution which reduces lung and heart diseases (nanoparticles, also stress from noise). Also the environment likes it.

Walking and cycling are promoted. This reduces cars on the roads too. This also increases the amount of physical activity and reduces deaths due to heart disease and cancers.

Side effects to health and environment of these two points could be more important in saving lives than actually preventing those accidents.

Distinction is made between types of roads. There are streets with low speed but high amount if intersections, roads with low amount of intersections and higher speed (even highways), cycling paths etc. In Americas a big problem is so called ""stroads"" which are high speed roads with high amount of intersections. A lot of accidents happen right here, and because of relatively high speed they're serious.

Cities are planned badly forcing people to drive long distances to get something they need. As nothing is available at a walking distance people have to drive which leads to accidents.

You can find videos about stroads and problems in American urban planning from e.g. YouTube.

So, it's a fundamentally a city design problem and not that easy to solve. As the cost to fix things is high it might be better to let people to die.

NY's digital Excelsior pass, can be bypassed easily (you can print out qr code, many businesses don't check the pass versus ID so you could use someone else's pass).

 Biggest loophole is that business that use Excelsior must also accept paper CDC cards. I get why (if you get covid shot in CT or NJ, you won't be able to use NY Excelsior pass), but the paper cards are just so easy for people to forge.

Basically, the ship has sailed. It will require a federal program to make this effective (Biden administration will not do it) and not all states/counties keep good records so it's too late

I have done some napkin analysis, this is based on people people hospitalized 8 days after infection and die about 18 days after infection.  I took these numbers (8 and 18) after looking at the 7-day peaks of cases, new hospitalizations and deaths.  The real answer is probably somewhere close +/- a couple of days.  

As of now UK is seeing 2.20% of all cases becoming hospitalized and 0.20% of all cases someone is dying. 

That is done from the peak of 10.56% of all cases becoming hospitalized and 3.08% of all cases someone is dying. 

Assuming that these numbers are correct and that UK is expecting 100,000 cases per day. UK will be seeing 2,200 new hospitalizations per day and 200 deaths per day. 

Those numbers are much lower than its peak during the January wave of 4,233 new hospitalizations per day and 1,285 deaths per day.

Though I’m also not sure if federal courts would even rule on that, they might just leave that up to state courts.

That’s really interesting, though I’m skeptical SCOTUS today would uphold that decision.  At the very least, I think they would require that such a mandatory vaccine would have full approval from the FDA, which no vaccine currently does.

I am ultimately against the government having the power to mandate that *everybody* takes a certain drug or gets a certain vaccine.  There’s too much potential for abuse or mistakes, imo.

Common flu and colds have a very small chance of doing you serious damage and you need a contact with them to help your immune system be better prepared.

Everyone is fascinated with Asians and their mask-wearing. But I think they're mostly worn because of their work culture. People probably wear them as an alternative for taking a sick leave, which is not very reasonable. Public health officials should make some clear statements that wearing masks to prevent colds is not very wise. In USA probably a lot of people treat masks as a political statement. We're in a very bad spot if we have to make everything political.

[],,Molire,,,[],,,,text,t2_174cr0,False,True,[],"&gt;There are more than 200 symptoms associated with long Covid spanning 10 organ systems—including memory loss, hallucinations, tremors and fatigue—according to a new study published Thursday, providing one of the most comprehensive insights yet into the lingering and debilitating illness that can affect patients for months or years after infection.   
             
&gt;Covid long haulers reported a total of 203 different symptoms in the seven months between Dec. 2019 and May 2020, ranging from rashes, peeling skin and digestive issues to muscle spasms, hearing loss and tinnitus, according to research published in the _Lancet’s E Clinical Medicine_ journal.  
      
&gt;The study, based on surveys from nearly 4,000 people from 56 countries, identified fatigue, brain fog and [post-exertional malaise](https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/healthcare-providers/clinical-care-patients-mecfs/treating-most-disruptive-symptoms.html#:~:text=subsequent) (where symptoms worsen after physical or mental effort) as the most common symptoms.  
        
&gt;On average, patients suffered from 56 different symptoms and those still suffering after six months—nearly two-thirds of participants taking the survey—were still experiencing an average of 14 symptoms.
    
&gt;Almost half (45%) of the study’s participants reported needing a reduced work schedule on account of their illness and around one-fifth (22%) were unable to work at all.  
      
&gt;The researchers noted that patients reported experiencing symptoms that are “not commonly mentioned in public discussion of long Covid,” like seizures, suicidality, facial paralysis, new allergies and changes in sensitivities to medication.   
         
&gt;Key Background...Severity of the initial infection does not appear to be strongly linked to the chances of getting long Covid, making children and young people—along with the unvaccinated—especially vulnerable....Studies suggest around 10% to 30% of Covid-19 patients may go on to become these “long haulers,” though this figure is likely to change as more research is conducted.  
      
&gt;33.9 million. That’s how many people in the U.S. have had Covid-19, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Using a conservative estimate of 10% for how many people go on to develop long Covid and subtracting how many have died from Covid-19, that’s 3.3 million Americans who could be living with persistent, debilitating symptoms.

This is consistent with this HK study published 1 month ago. In this study, they used 3 antibody test: (I copied from the previous post, someone else typed it)

**Roche Elecsys® test,** u/mL Sinovac after 1 dose: 9.6 Sinovac after 2 doses: **141.7**  
Pfizer/BioNtech 1 dose: 104.2 Pfizer/BioNtech 2 doses: **244.1**  
  
**Abbott IgG test, AU/mL** Sinovac after 1 dose: 157.6 Sinovac after 2 doses: **1005.2**  
Pfizer/BioNtech 1 dose: 1618.0 Pfizer/BioNtech 2 doses: **11572.6**  
  
**GenScript cPass test** Sinovac after 1 dose: 15.59 Sinovac after 2 doses: **66.7**  
Pfizer/BioNtech 1 dose: 66.0 Pfizer/BioNtech 2 doses: **94.5**

Basically if you look at Abbott IgG test, it's 10 times higher, but if you look at other 2 tests, it's more like 1.5 times higher. I'm actually interested in whether anyone know why the difference? A measurement thing or some scale is exponential? And 1.5 vs 10 definitely makes a totally different headlines. 

Also according to the researcher himself, this 10 times relationship is consistent with their original trial results. **Quote** ""According to the Nature Medicine article linked above, 10-fold to 13-fold differences in neutralizing antibody titers would correspond to very substantial differences in vaccine effectiveness, consistent with the clinical trial data (12/16)""  So this 10-fold relationship is pretty much expected I guess. You can see in the photo.

Study conducted by Umeå University in Sweden shows that mixing AstraZeneca (1st dose) and Moderna (2nd dose) provides good antibody levels and protection against Beta (South African) variant.

Do note however that this is a relatively small study (n=88), and while it does not prove anything on its own it adds yet another data point that mixing vaccines can be an effective strategy. 

The study is published here for those interested: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2110716

*Receiving an mRNA vaccine as a second dose after first receiving the Astra Zeneca vector vaccine provides good protection against covid-19. The combination of vaccines also leads to significantly higher antibody levels, compared to supplementing with the same variety, and also protects against the South African virus variant. This is shown by a new study at Umeå University, the results of which may have an impact on current and future vaccine strategies.*

Earlier this year, there were reports that Astra Zeneca's vector vaccine against covid-19 can cause rare but severe side effects in the form of blood clots, especially in younger people. In Sweden today, therefore, the vaccine is only used for people over the age of 65, and in many countries, younger people who have already been vaccinated with Astra Zeneca can choose to receive an mRNA vaccine as a second dose. At present, however, there is limited knowledge about how effective these so-called heterologous prime-boost strategies are in humans.

In a new research study, published in the top-ranked medical journal New England Journal of Medicine, researchers at Umeå University have examined and compared immune responses and side effects in people who received two doses of Astra Zeneca or who received one dose of Astra Zeneca and then a dose of Modernas mRNA vaccine.

\- It is a limited study of 88 people, but we clearly see that Moderna's mRNA vaccine works excellently to enhance the antibody response that the first dose of Astra Zeneca gave, says Mattias Forsell, who is an associate professor of immunology at Umeå University and leads the work. .

The study also shows that those who received the Modern vaccine as a second dose receive significantly higher levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies than those who received Astra Zeneca, and that these antibodies can also neutralize the South African strain (beta strain) of coronavirus. The subjects in the study were healthcare professionals between the ages of 23 and 62, and they received the vaccine doses at 9–12 week intervals.

\- The proportion of mild side effects was slightly higher in the group that received Moderna as the second dose, which was relatively expected based on what has already been described for both Astra Zeneca's and Moderna's vaccines, says Johan Normark, associate professor of infectious diseases and responsible for the clinical part of the work.

The results at Umeå University have been verified by an independent laboratory, through a collaboration with researchers at Karolinska Institutet and Region Värmland.

\- Our findings may be important for current and future vaccine strategies in Sweden and the world, as additional doses of vaccine will probably be needed to obtain full protection over a long period of time, Mattias Forsell adds.

The study has been made possible through support from SciLifeLab and the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation as well as the Swedish Research Council, Umeå University and the Västerbotten Region. The published results are part of the larger clinical drug study on covid-19 vaccine conducted at Umeå University in collaboration with Region Västerbotten and a number of other regions in Sweden.",,,,1626442209,{},h5e8fhn,True,t3_olgvx4,False,False,t3_olgvx4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/olgvx4/study_vaccination_with_two_different_covid19/h5e8fhn/,1626598891,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

We have already gone through a phased reopening and the final step is normalising people's behaviour (removal of masks, enabling people to feel confident about socialising again).

Following this phased reopening, there were nearly 52k positive tests reported in the UK, which is double the number from two weeks ago. 

Now, whether these people go on to die or experience ill health is another thing entirely. 

I believe the scientists when they say that the vaccines work, but I know that a reasonable number of people, who may not necessarily identify as antivax, actually do not have a great level of confidence in the vaccines doing their job.

If you don't believe that the vaccines will bring deaths down to an acceptable level (managing the disease) - and though the specifics are an entirely different debate, there *is* a level of deaths which will be acceptable - then *your* important metric must be the case numbers and by this metric, we are nowhere near being in control.

Keep in mind that Israel was the first to mass vaccinate. Antibody levels do drop over time, so you're seeing a precursor for other nations: a combination of mild vaccine evasion from Delta combined with the natural decay of active neutralizing antibodies due to time since vaccination. 

It is still relatively protective against hospitalization and death because some of that is mediated by B and T cells rather than existing antibody levels.

This is a well-documented principle of infectious diseases generally.

But if you want a COVID-specific example, here’s one from Spain:

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30985-3/fulltext

Again, we have to think less in absolutes and with more nuance. It’s not that we shouldn’t care at all about asymptomatic infections in vaccinated people, and just let as many people get infected as possible. It’s more complex than that. We should care, but not be overly concerned and fixated on asymptomatic vaccinated cases as something that’s necessarily a harbinger of doom. And by the way, many, if not most vaccinated people likely won’t get infected at all. 

We do know that long COVID is a risk, but again, it is very likely one that is similarly mitigated by the vaccine — particularly because we have reports of people with long COVID having their symptoms alleviated somewhat after getting vaccinated. We also know that long COVID was more prevalent in people with more severe cases — and we know that vaccination dramatically decreases the risk and number of severe cases, so it’s not a stretch to infer that the vaccine will diminish the risk and number of long COVID cases as well. The problem with long COVID is that it’s so amorphous and ill-defined, encompasses such a vast array of symptoms, and affects different populations in such varying ways, that it’s incredibly difficult to pin down and quantify what the risks of it are, let alone its prognosis.

I think general consensus is that the higher antibody level, the better protection. And most vaccines fit this rule. However we do see one exception, CureVac.

As I said in another thread, there was a period where all the most-vaccinated countries were having COVID surges *except* Israel, and experts sort of shrugged and said it's because those vaccines weren't as good. Pfizer briefly allowed Israel to be the only country to vaccinate its way to herd immunity, but Delta changed that. But we're still finding out how effective vaccines are and for how long. 

I believe that most (maybe all) vaccines still protect against severe infection, and for that matter, so does previous infection -- otherwise we would have seen massive confirmed reinfections everywhere that got hit with multiple variants. But the risk isn't zero and the risk of transmission is almost certainly higher than it was.

The messaging is very tricky at this time, because experts don't want us to lose faith in vaccines, but they also don't want vaccinated people to act like they're invincible. The problem is, of course, that vaccinated people (with any vaccine at all) know their personal risk is lowered, and you can't make them take the same precautions they used to.

Probably the idea of encouraging the vaccinated to hang out with the vaccinated, in some form or another, will start to come back (Israel is already starting to do this).",,,,1626463773,{},h5flvzd,False,t3_olmhp7,False,True,t3_olmhp7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/olmhp7/pfizer_covid_vaccine_significantly_less_effective/h5flvzd/,1626626268,38,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

##Cases
- 45,449 new resident cases weekly's report - Total Resident Cases: 2,406,809. **A change of +21,702 over last week's (23,747).** 
- 10.97% of people in Floridians had tested positive with COVID before (residents case numbers only).

##Testing
- 11.5% (+3.7% than last week's 7.8%) new cases positivity rate.

##Death
- 231 resident death- 38,388 Total Resident Deaths. 

###Averaging the case and death numbers into 7 days
- **45,449/7= 6,492.71 new cases per day in the last 7 days**
- **231/7=33.00 new death per day in the last 7 days**

##Vaccinated
- **153,349 New People Vaccinated (Actual First Doses)- 11,292,335 Total People Vaccinated (Actual Total First Doses Altogether)** 
- **152,087 Vaccinated Series Complete (J&amp;J 1 dose+Second Dose Vaccines)- 9,780,017 Total Series Complete (J&amp;J 1 dose+Second Dose Vaccines)**

##Percentage for Population That Are Vaccinated 
**(18+ population is removed since Total People Vaccinated counts 12+ now and age groups go from 12-14, 15-24 so it's hard to exclude under 18 from the adult population)**
- Total Population: 21,944,577
- Everyone who's Vaccinated in the Entire State Population (includes partially and fully vaccinated): 11,292,335/21,944,577=51.46% **(+0.70%)**

It's a statistics game. When a virus is very lethal, it tends to kill hosts or at least make them to sick to infect others as they are confined. Plus when a virus is new people tend to distance take measures etc. The selective pressure of viruses that kill to quickly and kill at to high of a rate is people die before they spread them.

Not that they don't spread them, just statistically speaking they spread them less. A version that causes less symptoms etc tends to spread more for obvious reasons.

There tends to be overlap in most viruses and strains so that the one the spreads quicker in a way actually vaccinates people from bad strains.

This usually multiples and causes bad strains to hit a load of road blocks in areas, and the weaker but more efficient strains dominate.

But that doesn't mean it applies universally, that just tends to be the trend and depends on virus vectors and many other factors.

Given how serious we take covid, we only loosen restrictions when it gets safer. This is a selective pressure against the virus because as cases go up and deaths remain the same we open up more giving selective pressures for more mild but faster spreading strains if possible.

If it's not available yet if there's a legit medical issue (like the only vaccines available in their area include ingredients that can trigger allergies, etc), I ain't mad at someone. 

If someone is flatly refusing, it's like ""cool, we told your ass. You get sick, that's your goddamn fault.""

But then my public health thinking kicks in. First, they may spread to their kids. The kids don't deserve that shit. They may also spread to others, and while for vaccinated people, the odds are very, very small, I personally don't wanna be sick because some shitbird doesn't want to be vaccinated. I really don't want them spreading this to medical professionals.

The big suck is that unvaccinated people are the perfect place for variants to spawn. They add additional strain to healthcare systems. If they're rural, then the small medical systems may not have the capacity, skill, or equipment to handle them, so they end up at a city hospital. So now you have city hospitals being crowded with their COVID cases in addition to rural cases. 

That's a lot of strain on bed and personnel capacity. That's less capacity for other everyday things.

This also means expenses pushed to the hospital and then to the healthcare system, which means we all end up paying for it.

And all because some shitbird won't look outside of their information circle, or just knows better and still won't be vaccinated.

&gt;During March to June 2021 India has experienced a deadly second wave of COVID19 with an increased number of post vaccination breakthrough infections reported across the country. To understand the possible reason of these breakthroughs we collected 677 clinical samples (throat swab/ nasal swabs) of individuals who had received two doses (n=592) and one dose (n=85) of vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin,) and tested positive for COVID19

&gt;This study indicated that majority of the clinical cases in the breakthrough were infected with the Delta variant and only 9.8% cases required hospitalization while fatality was observed in only 0.4% cases. This clearly suggests that the vaccination does provide reduction in hospital admission and mortality.

Overall 9.8% hospitalisation rates and 0.4% deaths among this cohort is not exactly good news, although there are almost certainty issues in group selection, since people with symptoms are far more likely to get tested.",,,,1626451041,{},h5es0mb,False,t3_oljcyg,False,False,t3_oljcyg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oljcyg/about_04_died_of_covid19_after_vaccination_in/h5es0mb/,1626609077,16,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

There have been past issues with older mRNA vaccines during development. The heart inflammation thing. Super fast development cycle. Fairly rough side effects (I and many people I know had fever, headache, multiple days of fatigue, short term stomach issues , etc.). Immense social and political pressure to take it (and justifiably so). Previous misinformation about COVID from public health authorities (don’t wear an N95, it might increase your chances of getting covid if not properly fitted, which only medical professionals know how to do—a valid public health position given the PPE shortage, but was obviously untrue). Extreme politicization of the pandemic (Trump….). A lack of detailed and understandable communication about how the vaccine works, why it’s side effects are more severe, what the potential risks are, etc. (I read a lot of actual studies and medical literature before I got it, and I can’t say that stuff is easy to understand). And aside from these more legitimate reasons to have doubts and concerns, I think there’s also the feeling that comes with such an abnormal once-in-a-lifetime (hopefully) event that disrupts life so severely, the feeling that “this can’t be real” which leads to a search for alternate explanations.

I don’t think being so dismissive is going to help increase our vaccination rate. We need to understand where this stuff comes from and get through to people, not just shit on their entire perspective.

You responded to a statement from someone expressing hopelessness with, in your mind, hope.  And I feel that same hope, though tempered.

We have two cases to deal with here - this specific interlocutor and then people in general.

This particular person has experienced tremendous loss and probably isn't in a place from which they can accept hopeful information.  They need support and time.  It is not your responsibility to provide either of those, but it is arguably a human expectation that you ought to understand.

In terms of people in general, the pandemic has demonstrated clearly how poorly most people understand and calculate risk.  Many, if not most people, already believe their risk of serious illness or death from Covid is vanishingly low.  In many cases, they are largely correct.  The dangers of long Covid are also poorly understood and amorphous at this time.

The point I'm making (in far too many words) is that people lack hope because they aren't hoping to simply survive - they are hoping for pre-Covid normalcy.  Parties.  Pot-luck dinners.  Nights at the pub watching sports while cheering the home team and sampling each other's craft brews.  School with sports, without masks.  Seeing people's faces.  

So far, the vaccines can't do that.  If the population of anti-vax isn't reduced, the current vaccines may become ineffective before they have even been made available to most countries in bulk.  The entire population of unvaccinated then becomes a petri dish.  

All of what I've just mentioned and more is on the news and social media daily (depending on your echo chamber of choice), and it's beginning to severely degrade many people's mental and emotional well-being.

The vaccines, miracles that they are, cannot touch the problem of despair directly.  Coordinated human effort, including vaccines, is what is needed to restore hope.

My two cents.

In addition, Merck, the original patent holder of ivermectin, has released the [following statement](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/):

&gt; Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today affirmed its position regarding use of ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

&gt; * No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

&gt; * No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;

&gt; * A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.

&gt; We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.

&gt;Macron said that from 21 July anyone wanting to visit a theatre, cinema, sports venue or festival that had an audience of more than 50 people would need to show a health pass proving they were either fully vaccinated or had tested negative.

&gt;The same requirement will be extended to bars, cafes, restaurants, shopping centres, hospitals, long-distance trains and planes from 1 August, the president said. Free Covid tests, meanwhile, will end in September, “to encourage vaccination”.

&gt;In an address watched by 22.4 million people, Macron also said vaccinations would be mandatory for health workers, retirement home staff and all others working with vulnerable people, with sanctions for those not fully vaccinated by September.

At this point I’m going to say that we can do three shots for the elderly and high risk folks to boost their immunity levels since the anti vaxxer morons clearly don’t give a shit and then we can let whatever happens happen. Get some variant boosters out in a few months and the vaxxed folks can get on with life while idiots can go gamble with their lives.

Vaccination rates aren't going up.

Delta has changed the herd immunity game. With Alpha, all we had to do was get 70% of the population vaccinated to reduce spread to noise. With Delta, that number has gone up to north of 90%. There is no way that happens organically with the anti-vax sentiment in the US.

Sure.  But unless you have a way to force them to get vaccinated, and that's not even close to realistically on the cards, we're in that boat until they get natural immunity unless we're just going to stay with these restrictions forever.

In addition, Merck, the original patent holder of ivermectin, has released the [following statement](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/):

&gt; Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today affirmed its position regarding use of ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

&gt; * No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

&gt; * No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;

&gt; * A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.

&gt; We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.

&gt;”I think one of the challenges with this is the individuals who are choosing to not get vaccinated are the same individuals who are going to choose to not wear a mask, and those are the ones who are at risk,” Supervisor Fletcher added.

&gt;Coronavirus cases in San Diego are increasing -- after weeks of daily positivity percentages hovering around 1%, that curve has been on a slow but steady incline since June 15 – but the rate of increase doesn’t compare to L.A. County, which is reporting its highest COVID numbers since March.

&gt;What also sets the two regions apart is that 80% of San Diego’s eligible population is at least partially vaccinated compared to L.A. County’s 70%. San Diego County is home to about 3.3 million people while more than 10 million reside in L.A.

&gt;”In San Diego our numbers are down because we vaccinated a lot of people. That's the bottom line,” Kaiser Permanente Registered Nurse Robyn Sarvis said. “Not because COVID went away, not because it’s less dangerous.

[],,KinnerNevada,,,[],,,,text,t2_m76zflk,False,False,[],"Even with half the U.S. vaccinated, COVID-19 continues to kill people faster than guns, car crashes and influenza combined, according to a review of mortality data. 

The situation has improved dramatically since January, when COVID deaths outpaced heart disease and cancer as the country’s top killer, according to a Bloomberg analysis. Still, for the month of June, coronavirus was responsible for 337 deaths a day. For comparison, the historic average deaths from gunshots, car crashes and complications from the flu add up to 306 a day. 

“The sad reality is that despite our progress, we’re still losing people to this virus,” Jeff Zients, the White House pandemic response coordinator, said at a press briefing last week. “Which is especially tragic given that, at this point, it is unnecessary and preventable. Virtually all COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths in the United States are now occurring among unvaccinated individuals.” 

Data for the analysis were gathered from Johns Hopkins University, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

After 10 weeks of global declines in COVID deaths, the highly transmissible delta variant is driving a new uptick. In the U.S., health officials have warned that a similar reversal may be underway: Daily cases have doubled from a low point last month, and hospitalizations are rising again.  

Vaccines by Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. prevent as many as 96% of hospitalizations and deaths from the delta variant, according to recent data from the U.S., U.K. and Israel. The protections are even greater when taking into account the effects of reduced transmission in well-vaccinated communities, as data scientist Cathy O’Neil explained in a Bloomberg Opinion column. 

“Preliminary data from several states over the last few months suggest that 99.5% of deaths from COVID-19 in the United States were in unvaccinated people,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky reported on Thursday. “Those deaths were preventable by a simple, safe shot.”

Falling behind on vaccinations

The U.S. vaccination campaign, however, has stalled. Once the envy of the world for its swift rollout, the U.S. has since been overtaken by more than 20 countries that now have better vaccine coverage, according to Bloomberg’s COVID vaccine tracker. The EU and China, which are currently administering shots at daily rates of about 4 million and 10 million doses respectively, are poised to blow past the U.S. in the next two weeks. 

Not only have U.S. vaccinations slowed to a trickle—just 530,000 a day, on average—but the gap between the most and least vaccinated counties in the U.S. continues to widen. That’s left some some communities especially vulnerable to delta. For unvaccinated people living in low-vaccination communities, the threat posed by COVID-19 is about as bad as it has ever been.

COVID vaccinations in the U.S. have already prevented roughly 279,000 deaths and 1.25 million hospitalizations, according to an analysis published last week by researchers at Yale University and the Commonwealth Fund. The report suggests that without vaccines, COVID would still be topping cancer and heart disease as the leading cause of death in the U.S.—even into the summer, when respiratory viruses typically fade into the background.

The sudden dominance of the delta variant has surprised health officials around the world. In the Netherlands, cases jumped by more than 500% in just the last week. The U.K. and Russia are reporting the highest transmission rates since January. Israel reinstated its mask mandate. Sydney and Melbourne are in lockdown again. 

“The delta variant is ripping around the world at a scorching pace, driving a spike in cases and deaths,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a press briefing Monday. “The pandemic is not over—anywhere.”",,,,1626447687,{},h5ek5ta,True,t3_oliit0,False,False,t3_oliit0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oliit0/covid_still_killing_americans_faster_than_guns/h5ek5ta/,1626604934,113,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

We know that some people still haven’t regained their sense of smell a year later. We know there’s sometimes “permanent” lung damage.

True, but only partially.

Let's group people into the following buckets:
1. People who are completely immune to COVID-19. They won't catch the disease even by showering in a bathtub of coronavirus.
2. People who can catch the virus, spread it, but are asymptomatic.
3. People who can catch the virus, and show minor to medium symptoms, without hospitalizations need.
4. People who can catch the virus, with severe symptoms, need hospitalization, but will survive.
5. People who die if get infected.

These 5 buckets exist naturally, and no vaccine can change this fact. What vaccines can do, however, is to move people from higher buckets to lower ones. There is no detailed data on how much the improvements are, but with the bucket 5 percentage, mRNA vaccines roughly reduce it from 1.5% to 0.01%-0.02%.",,,,1626390228,{},h5bzuun,False,t3_ol26zj,False,False,t1_h5bwo8z,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ol26zj/la_county_again_requiring_masks_indoors_starting/h5bzuun/,1626556433,35,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Covid-19 is something we're going to have to live with from now on - much like in the 1910s with the Spanish flu, as most flu viruses floating around are descendants of that original debilitating strain. We just adapted, and so did the virus.

The virus mutation is something of a mixed blessing. Covid-19 was originally a zoonotic transfer, meaning it was poorly adapted to human physiology. That's what makes it so lethal.
As time goes on, the mutations allow it to better adapt to humans - this makes it more virulent (spreads better) but less lethal.
Essentially we need to wait for that sweet spot where the lethality is sufficiently low whilst the virulence isn't too high.
At which point it becomes like a seasonal cold.

The tricky thing is the long incubation period, which makes it hard to contain.

(First shot) 💉💪🩹,dark,text,t2_12i2lf,False,False,[],"After six months of vaccination against covid-19 in Chile, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Science presented the first clinical studies on the efficacy of the Sinovac vaccine in the country.

The results that stand out in the clinical study, which was carried out with 2,300 volunteers, are that in that period of time only 2% of the fully vaccinated participants developed COVID-19 and that only 0.088% required hospitalization.

According to information from the Chilean media [La Tercera](https://www.latercera.com/que-pasa/noticia/resultados-del-estudio-clinico-de-sinovac-en-chile-en-seis-meses-no-registran-fallecidos-y-solo-2-de-los-vacunados-se-ha-contagiado/DHYNWVY5C5BMZMSITRSID3BSNI/), published on July 15, 2021, there were 2,300 people who in 2020 agreed to participate in a phase 3 clinical study with which the efficacy of the Coronavac vaccine from the pharmaceutical company is being evaluated. China Sinovac Biotech, one of the five vaccines that are applied in the country against the disease.

The academic of the Catholic University and director of the Millennium Institute in Immunology and Immunotherapy (IMII), Alexis Kalergis and leader of the clinical trial, together with academics and researchers from the Catholic University explained that to date, a very low percentage of covid cases -19 has been registered in the clinical study.

They detailed that of the total number of participants, only 45 have so far been diagnosed and almost all of them have presented illness with mild symptoms. In addition, only three people had more symptoms that required hospital care, but with successful recovery. In general, these cases correspond to older people with comorbidities. No deaths from Covid-19 have been reported in this clinical study, the researchers said.

Information from the Chilean media indicates that the main conclusion of the study is that the Sinovac vaccine has very good protection against severe cases and death from the new coronavirus and also develops antibodies capable of blocking the entry of the virus into cells (antibodies neutralizers against Spike or S protein) but these decrease over time, which is why a dose of booster vaccine is necessary to increase this protection.

According to the study, of the 2,300 vaccinated, to date, only 45 have been infected with COVID-19 and most of them mildly and only three have required hospital care and none have died.

Another conclusion is that the immune response developed by T lymphocytes (acquired immunity), which are those that expel the virus when it is already inside the cell, were also generated and not only against the Spike protein as in the case of antibodies neutralizers or blockers, an advantage that this vaccine has since it inoculates the complete but inactive virus.

According to the scientists, the effectiveness data obtained in Chile and in other countries that use CoronaVac show that this vaccine has a very good ability to prevent severe illness and death caused by the virus and also shows a very favorable efficacy and effectiveness to prevent covid -19 symptomatic.

A recent study published by the New England Journal of Medicine also proved the efficacy of the Chinese vaccine.

According to the research, on day 14 after the second dose, the effectiveness of this vaccine was 65.9% to prevent symptoms of covid-19, 87.5% to prevent hospitalization, 90.3% to avoid admission to ICU and 86.3% to prevent death related to Sars CoV-2 infection.

The study published by the New England Journal of Medicine was conducted between February 2 and May 1, 2021 as part of the Chilean vaccination campaign, and included 10.2 million people.

All data is about Delta variant.

\-People under 50: Case fatality rate - 0,02%

\-People over 50.: Case fatality rate - 2% 

But look at the risk of hospitalization:

\-People under 50: 3%

\-People over 50: 5,2%

**The difference is very small.** It shows that younger people are unlikely to die even if they're hospitalized, but they still put a lot of pressure on health systems.

**More than two thirds of admissions for delta variant are among people under 50. Only 4% of admissions in this age group were among fully vaccinated.**

People under 50 account for 90% of delta cases in the UK. It shows that older people are significantly protected from disease so far thanks to high vaccine uptake among this age group.

This data clearly shows that if we had a 90% of uptake among all eligible, not just elderly we could prevent more than 66% of hospitalizations. Probably much more as infections would be more rare in the first place.

**Governments really need to do as much as it's possible to have high uptakes among all eligible age groups.**

I'd say the article mentions quite a bit about how bad the overall situation is as well:

&gt; Crushed by COVID

&gt; Six weeks after entering a nationwide lockdown, Malaysia is in a state of paralysis.

&gt; Hospitals and their staff are overwhelmed, the unemployed are going hungry, the economy is reeling and the infection rate has continued to climb, reaching a level twice that even of COVID-ravaged Indonesia on a per capita basis.

&gt; Yet while Malaysia has sped up its jabs, it has done little to diminish dissatisfaction with the Perikatan Nasional government’s overall handling of the virus. It was just over a year ago, on July 7, 2020, that there were no new cases at all in the country and complacency has been blamed for its slide into despair.

&gt; In the meantime, the health system is crumbling and the body count rising, with burned-out doctors having to “play God” in some instances to determine who survives.

&gt; In Fahmi’s electorate in the south west of Kuala Lumpur, barbed wire and food banks on street corners have been part of the furniture since the lockdown.

&gt; Avg. daily cases in past week: 9,682 (+7.15%)

&gt; Avg. daily deaths in past week: 105 (+3.81%)

&gt; “There is a sense that they don’t know when this is going to end,” he said of his constituents.

&gt; But Dr Hartini Zainudin, a child-rights activist who is helping to coordinate assistance, said “this lockdown has been horrible” for those who have fallen into unemployment.

&gt; ”I’m getting people to give me 10,000 ringgit ($3200) so I can feed 50 families and hiring boats to get food out to hungry people on islands. I mean, it’s ridiculous.

&gt; But those who quote Holmes might want to actually read the case where the phrase originated before using it as their main defense. If they did, they'd realize it was never binding law, and the underlying case, U.S. v. Schenck, is not only one of the most odious free speech decisions in the Court's history, but was overturned over 40 years ago.

&gt; First, it's important to note U.S. v. Schenck had nothing to do with fires or theaters or false statements. Instead, the Court was deciding whether Charles Schenck, the Secretary of the Socialist Party of America, could be convicted under the Espionage Act for writing and distributing a pamphlet that expressed his opposition to the draft during World War I.

...

&gt; The crowded theater remark that everyone remembers was an analogy Holmes made before issuing the court's holding. He was explaining that the First Amendment is not absolute. It is what lawyers call dictum, a justice's ancillary opinion that doesn't directly involve the facts of the case and has no binding authority. The actual ruling, that the pamphlet posed a ""clear and present danger"" to a nation at war, landed Schenk in prison and continued to haunt the court for years to come.

...

&gt; In 1969, the Supreme Court's decision in Brandenburg v. Ohio effectively overturned Schenck and any authority the case still carried. There, the Court held that inflammatory speech--and even speech advocating violence by members of the Ku Klux Klan--is protected under the First Amendment, unless the speech ""is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action"" (emphasis mine).

That is, is delta infection worse than the UK or Brazil variant, or does it only pose more risk because one is more likely to be infected by delta because it is more transmissible and replicates more in the respiratory system? Don’t know for sure. 

While we wait for peer-reviewed data, there are news reports that support what we are seeing in the hospital setting - that is, more delta-variant cases are appearing. I’m not suggesting the risk for children is death, but rather long-Covid. I know that to be true because my wife sees it in her clinic. 

The moderator won’t let me link to news reports, so just Google “Covid delta variant Mississippi” and you’ll see one case example of outbreak due to delta among kids. You can find plenty of examples looking that way - I linked others but had to delete them. We see it in our academic medical center though - predominantly delta variants, and sicker cases. 

Viral load is 1,000x higher with delta variant vs OG SARS-CoV-2:

If you look at surges in locations with the vaccine available, they are (almost?) all driven by delta variant. 

My point is that people who choose not to vaccinate increase the risk for people who cannot vaccinate, and that pisses me off because I have kids who can’t vaccinate and the risk to them is not negligible.

Do you enjoy giving links that give no evidence for your claims?

'Nevertheless, ""both scenarios are still on the table,"" says geneticist Chan. Chan says she herself hasn't reached any conclusions about whether a lab is responsible: ""There's nothing that's a smoking gun,"" she says.'

This is what she had to say in May 2021. There was even **less** suggesting a lab leak early in 2020.

That being said, why can't you provide a source showing that the media was against actually investigating the source of the pandemic versus them just being against people pushing a theory not supported by any available evidence as fact?

And you wonder why people believe people consistently pushing the lab leak narrative are spreading conspiracies when it's based on so many omissions?

&gt;Scientists have been searching for the source of the pandemic, natural or lab-made, since day one. They’ve had plenty of time to “focus” on researching and analyzing multiple possible origins.

There's a difference between scientists researching the origins and people pushing a narrative out of racism/xenophobia. I'll ask again - what's the reason to fixate *solely* on a lab leak origin early on in 2020 when literally no evidence pointed to that?

&gt;Here, while you’re learning, read this, it’s a good play-by-play of what went down in public discourse in 2020.

https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-medias-lab-leak-fiasco

Why would the media focus on claims that have no evidence? Why would the media support a narrative that's the least likely option by far?

&gt;Macron said that from 21 July anyone wanting to visit a theatre, cinema, sports venue or festival that had an audience of more than 50 people would need to show a health pass proving they were either fully vaccinated or had tested negative.

&gt;The same requirement will be extended to bars, cafes, restaurants, shopping centres, hospitals, long-distance trains and planes from 1 August, the president said. Free Covid tests, meanwhile, will end in September, “to encourage vaccination”.

&gt;In an address watched by 22.4 million people, Macron also said vaccinations would be mandatory for health workers, retirement home staff and all others working with vulnerable people, with sanctions for those not fully vaccinated by September.

I don't get to choose whether I'm testing my vaccine or not. My argument is that whether all those unvaxxed people get infected quickly or if we flatten the curve with interventions and they all get infected over a longer period of time, the same number of infections are going to happen. Because everyone is either going to get vaxxed or they're going to get infected with a naive immune system. I can be more at risk from them for a shorter time or less at risk for a longer time, with ultimately no difference in risk.

Now, if your argument is that you as a vaccinated person want to mask and take precautions while the unvaxxed people are out infecting each all of each other and some of the vaxxed, then that's a 100% valid decision for an individual to make. But a society wide mandate on those things will only make the same number of unvaxxed infections take a longer period of time to happen. Other than through vaccines, we can only flatten the curve, not prevent infections from happening. And I do not believe flattening the curve is necessary or worthwhile in any area without a threat to hospital capacity. Scotland's relatively low hospitalization rate in their Delta wave (about 60% lower peak hospitalization despite 40% higher peak cases in this wave), because of the high levels of vaccination among vulnerable demographics, leaves me very optimistic about hospital capacity (20% vax areas like southern Missouri excepted).",,,,1626447452,{},h5ejm9r,False,t3_olf1ra,False,False,t1_h5ehth2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/olf1ra/englands_covid_unlocking_a_threat_to_the_world/h5ejm9r/,1626604660,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Basically asking the lab under investigation to self report. Obviously the lab said ""Theres no way it was a lab leak"" and that was that. They took them on their word and that was the scope of their investigation. 

One of the members of that investigation team was Peter Daszak. 

Daszak is actually heavily involved with the WIV by collaborating and basically organizing $700k of tax payer money to be given to WIV for undisclosed research projects through the NIH. 

Daszak is also a part of Lancet, perhaps the world’s preeminent scientific journal, which published a statement in February 2020, when relatively little was known about the coronavirus. The statement declared “solidarity with all scientists and health professionals in China,” where the virus had originated sometime in late 2019.

“We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin,” the Lancet statement said.

This article has a whole lot more info, and actually has research done by some Australians showing that a lab leak is actually the most likely scenario based on how the virus infects different species.

Australia and New Zealand have adopted a different strategy to most of the rest of the world in dealing with COVID. That means COVID zero within their borders, sustained by lockdowns when community spread arises. This has meant that for most of the past 18 months life has been normal (mass gatherings, no masks, etc.)

This only works if you can do two things well:

\- maintain an airtight border

\- if a case sneaks through, lock down quickly enough to stamp it out.

This approach will never last long term (unless NZ/Aus. want to be permanent hermit kingdoms - which I have to tell myself isn't true as the human cost for that would add up eventually as well) but the idea was to buy time until vaccines with minimal illness and death. I think on that front they have had amazing success, compared to the rest of the world. Speaking as someone with elderly family living in NZ, I am grateful for the strategy adopted.

The issue now is not that they're locking down (we can argue in fact that NSW was too slow to lock down hard enough) - that's the strategy they are taking so of course they're locking down, the issue is that the vaccine rollouts in both countries are terrible. That there is a discussion of boosters being approved in the US when Pfizer hasn't even fulfilled it's obligations to them is a sign of that (let alone other countries waiting for Pfizer, like Japan). We have seen (for example) in recent weeks the SK govt get creative in negotiating supply deals w Israel to try and solve this problem independent of Pfizer. Australian/NZ citizens should be wondering what their governments are doing, much like the SK govt is doing, to ensure expeditious delivery of vaccines.

There is in fact an urgency to deliver vaccines because Delta has changed the game with its higher infectiousness. It seems much more likely to break through a border quarantine, and when it hits the community where there is almost zero population immunity, spread like a wildfire through a dry forest.
