So you get a check for $1400. You deposit it. The fed literally electronically deposits $1400 in your account digitally. And they record a liability on their balance sheet of $1400. 

This is a simplified version of what happens, but accurate. The money is created digitally, and so is the liability. 

But more money is created by banks. Let’s say you deposit $1000 to your bank. The bank can typically leverage this 9to1. So they loan out about $90,000 to business, real estate projects, whatever. And they charge a interest rate on the $90,000 let’s say 4%. And let’s say they pay you 1%. So after one year they pay you $10 but makes $3,600. 
How does the bank make $89,000? The same way the fed does. They digitally create deposits in people account.

My first priority after being vaccinated will be getting medical care I have *desperately* needed, but frankly, I've also gone in and out of being suicidal from severe touch starvation. Obviously I've been seeing a therapist and whatnot, but human touch is a **physiological need** and I'd very much like to be able to hug someone. Most of my friends are not in priority groups / will not yet be vaccinated for who knows how long. I got stuck living alone this pandemic and have a multitude of medical conditions.

What's the recommendation for once I'm vaccinated? I don't want or plan on doing anything 'crazy', and I'm happy wearing a mask until the pandemic is declared ""over"", but I absolutely need some physical contact in my life, ideally daily. Should I form a covid bubble of people who mask, but don't distance? If so, how strict does it have to be, and how many people can I include? Can I get a roommate who isn't 'crazy' partying, but is  doing all the things I've been deprived of (ie wearing a mask while getting medical care, grocery shopping, and maybe they visit friends or family they see/touch)? I know I still have a risk of being an asymptomatic spreader, and I also know that there's a chance of the virus mutating / entering the community. I don't want to play a part in spreading that for others' health, nor do I want to risk catching a new variant the vaccine doesn't protect against. Many in my city are unfortunately being reckless, selfish assholes who are not masking *or* distancing, and it's a travel/tourist hub. However, my mental health can't sustain distancing.

On a related note, what's the etiquette for passing people on walks? Since I'm high risk, I've been avoiding people by a *long* distance--literally crossing the street or going down a different block altogether. Every single day, twice a day, I've weeped over all the people I otherwise could've met. My dog is also very sad that we haven't been able to meet people. I have a 15 foot leash my dog is on and would still be masked--would it be rude to walk just 15 feet-ish apart on walks instead of crossing the block? When will it be safe to actually meet the people we pass? Can I shout to ask whether people are vaccinated, and if they are, can we ""meet"" if they say yes? Would inviting people over to eat, outside, distanced, be okay? Is coworking with someone masked/distanced/outside okay? Just trying to figure out what I'll be able to safely, responsibly do.

Which is me, presently, through no fault of my own.

Their savings and income may have been directly impacted by becoming sick with Covid-19. Covid-19, due to it being an interaction with the infamous American Health System, has the easy capacity to bankrupt people.

&gt;Is the economy so fragile we it completely collapse unless we keep pumping trillions of dollars into it?

The economy depends on the vast majority of those involved in it (1) not declaring bankruptcy (2) are generating a **stable** income and (3) are putting money back into the system.

People are broke, some dead broke. Finding a job that's WFH that can support your debts can be near-impossible for many and for those which it is not, generally those WFH jobs are not stable. Many people are staying home to try and stop the spread of this virus. Necessarily, that means they're putting less money back into the economy.

The economy does not like depressions. Not paying money to get out of depressions as fast as you can only leads to those depressions lasting longer and strife and apathy being generated as a result, which can result in negative effects such as increased crime, decreased trust in police/government apparatuses, people refusing to have children, people not pursuing higher education, and folks generally starting to see about moving elsewhere in the world if they can.

It's possible that experts are looking at modeling based on the variants from other countries and extrapolating. We should listen to experts. That being said, US data alone isn't yet pointing to such a dramatic conclusion.

- The lowest 7-day moving average of cases during the storm was 63,000 cases. We are now reporting a 7-day average of 60,600 cases. There's a bump in cases in the week inbetween that are delayed reporting + later testing. There's no other reasonable explanation for a one-week bump that has now disappeared.
- Cases bottomed out at around 35,000 cases per day in September (the first non-surge where we had ample testing capacity). Right now, cases are roughly 60,000 per day. However, in September we were conducting roughly 800,000 tests per day. We are currently averaging 1.4 million tests per day.
- The lowest 7-day average during the storm for deaths was 1,919 per day. The 7-day average now is 1,745 per day. Deaths had a similar reporting delay dip and surge.
- The most stable statistic, hospitalizations, continues its steep decline. 2 weeks ago, the 7-day average for hospitalizations was 60,144. 1 weeks ago, it was 51,036. Today, it is 42,137. The current 7-day average of new hospitalizations is 5,125. One week ago, it was 6,229. So new hospitalizations and total hospitalizations are dropping week-over-week by 15-18 percent.
- Calculated R0 across the country is still less than 1. Texas cities *are* seeing a high R0 (1.1 or higher). A couple other metros are now above 1 (Detroit, Miami).

Conclusion: We are still coming out of the peak. Cases are higher than our lowest point last fall, but we are also testing much more now, so it's possible they are much more similar. Hospitalizations most likely need another 3-4 weeks to reach their lowest point since the first wave 1 year ago. Deaths will probably take even longer to clear out.

Could we be plateauing? Maybe. I think the evidence points to that we are not, but rather than decline in cases has slowed some. The next 7 days will give us a clearer picture. 

Are we on the tipping point of another surge? The evidence is less convincing on this. It's possible these variants will lead to another surge, and it's possible it could be just a few weeks away, but the US data doesn't point to it *currently* happening.",,,1615134952,{},gq3ymw6,False,t3_lzsgp2,False,True,t3_lzsgp2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lzsgp2/us_is_at_a_tipping_point_of_another_covid19_surge/gq3ymw6/,1615134968,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],

The number of hospitalizations has dropped 20% in a week: from 49,000 to 41,000. You can find that in the source CNN cites. 

By juxtaposing “infection numbers plateau” and “hospitalizations remain high” CNN is clearly implying that progress has stalled. 

20% drop in 7 days is cause for celebration. And it’s actually like 90% in 8 weeks. That information is cause for optimism, but CNN has conveniently left the rate out.

About 8.5% of the $1.9 trillion, at most, goes to direct containment measures such as vaccines and testing. The total is somewhere between $100 billion and $160 billion, depending on whether one includes items like $10 billion in medical supplies and $24 billion in child care for essential workers, as the White House does in arriving at the larger figure.

22% of the total bill comes from the $422 billion set aside for $1,400-per-person stimulus checks.

Another 13% ($246 billion) is for extending additional unemployment funding of $400 a week.

A combined 12% is going to:
Subsidized COBRA for laid-off workers. 
Affordable Care Act subsidies for the next two years. 
Expanded nutrition assistance to replace school lunch programs during the pandemic. 
Funding for testing and contact tracing. 
Disaster Relief Fund increases and covering COVID-19-related funeral expenses. 
Grants to airlines and contractors to freeze layoffs through September. Defense Production Act funding for medical supplies. 
Grants for restaurants and bars that have lost revenue in the pandemic. Economic Injury Disaster Loan Advance grants of up to $10,000 per business.

Then there is money to do things like open schools, there is money to state and local governments which will help them pay salaries in the face of reduced tax receipts.

Yes there is some truly unrelated items like : $1.5 million bridge connecting New York and Canada; a $100 million underground rail project in Silicon Valley; $480 million for Native American language preservation and maintenance; and $50 million in environmental justice grants.

But there are minisscule
POLITICAL FACT RATED THIS CLAIMS FALSE:
We rate this claim FALSE because it is not supported by our research. There’s room for debate over exactly how much of the $1.9 trillion is related to the pandemic. It's surely not all of it. But this claim bungles a widely circulating 9% stat.
More than 99% of the American Rescue Plan is going to Americans, though some of that falls in the category of political “pork.” An analysis by a nonpartisan group found that about 85% of the bill is related to the coronavirus pandemic.

About 8.5% of the $1.9 trillion, at most, goes to direct containment measures such as vaccines and testing. The total is somewhere between $100 billion and $160 billion, depending on whether one includes items like $10 billion in medical supplies and $24 billion in child care for essential workers, as the White House does in arriving at the larger figure. 

22% of the total bill comes from the $422 billion set aside for $1,400-per-person stimulus checks. 

Another 13% ($246 billion) is for extending additional unemployment funding of $400 a week. 

A combined 12% is going to: 
Subsidized COBRA for laid-off workers. 
Affordable Care Act subsidies for the next two years. 
Expanded nutrition assistance to replace school lunch programs during the pandemic. 
Funding for testing and contact tracing. 
Disaster Relief Fund increases and covering COVID-19-related funeral expenses. 
Grants to airlines and contractors to freeze layoffs through September. Defense Production Act funding for medical supplies. 
Grants for restaurants and bars that have lost revenue in the pandemic. Economic Injury Disaster Loan Advance grants of up to $10,000 per business. Then there is money to do things like open schools, 

there is money to state and local governments which will help them pay salaries in the face of reduced tax receipts. 

Yes there is some truly unrelated items like : $1.5 million bridge connecting New York and Canada; a $100 million underground rail project in Silicon Valley; $480 million for Native American language preservation and maintenance; and $50 million in environmental justice grants.

Second, hospitalization numbers are not stabilized. They are collapsing at an insane rate. In fact, there has not been a day where the hospitalization numbers have creeped up at all: every single day the total hospitalized goes down. That’s insanely good. 

Were now at 41,000 hospitalized. We were at 49,000 a week ago. That’s a 20% drop. In what world is that “stabilized”?

Deaths are on a lagging pace, but still average daily deaths were 2,100 a day a week ago. To about 1800, so another 15% drop. 

You won’t find this data on CNN, but in no way have we “plateaud”. The rate of decrease has slowed, but that isn’t a plateau.

Further supplemented by Novavax, followed by talks with Valneva… And Sanofi stating that they would make other vaccines.

See, the problem here is that hindsight is always 20/20. One of Sanofi's candidates was an mRNA vaccine, not unlike Pfizer and Moderna. The latter two could've failed all the same. Fortunately, they didn't – so we have a potent and frankly amazingly efficient vaccine that will – I dare say – change the way the general public views vaccine efficacy for years to come.

The purchasing strategy was pretty sound. There are about 380 million adults in the EU as a whole – by initially ordering 2.3 billion doses (now about 3 billion) from 6 manufacturers, the EU made sure that even if some failed to make a viable candidate, they would essentially still have enough to vaccinate everybody, and then some.

It's quite easy to sit here in March 2021 and say that the EU should have done this or that. It's easy to criticize decisions made a couple of months into the pandemic, when there were no clear winners and superior technologies. It's easy to lambast the EU for betting on AstraZeneca, but at that time:

•	⁠Although the virus is mutating, there are a limited number of mutations that it can perform which will still allow it to attack a human cell.  Over time, antibodies or vaccines will be able to handle these mutations and the virus will live on as a very weak version of its former self.  It will essentially just cause a “common cold”.
