There are going to be different strains of Covid because of how badly we (the world) have handled things. That's a given.

College students are fine most of the time. That's not the same for the people that they infect. We also don't know what the long term consequences of them getting infected with Covid will be. Shingles 2.0 maybe or maybe sterility.

Pressure can be put on people through other means. For example, sporting events can require vaccines as can restaurants. Employers can require that their employees get vaccinated and as we see here, the colleges can require them too. All of that can put pressure on people. At some point the schools will start requiring them.

What pisses me off is this. It's the people who get the vaccines that are protecting the brain dead people who aren't getting them. The same thing with the people wearing masks, and those who stayed at home. Can you imaging if everyone had acted like the people throwing their apples out of their carts in shops?

If people acted in the past like they are acting now, then we would probably have been wiped out by some virus. It's irresponsible.

For the record, I would have agreed with shipping over vaccines voluntarily to the EU once the tides turned over here. However it would have been politically difficult to do so given how demanding and threatening they had been whilst Britain was still suffering more.

Reasons as to why blame for CoronaVirus 2nd wave is completely on Modi Government


1.  They didn't allow foreign vaccines. Said we're self sufficient with Indian. Didn't allow private firms to manufacture COVIDSHIELD or COVAXIN. 


2.  Following above they didn't increase manufacturing capabilities. SII was under contractual obligation ; they had to send 100 million vaccines but only were able to send 18 million. Following which UK filed a lawsuit against them. For imported vaccines took praise on themselves. 


3. Age cap blunder by allowing only 45+ citizens to get vaccinated. Indian Boomer population will bang thalis rather than getting a vaccine. The disinformation campaigns have been huge.


4. They didn't increase oxygen production since last year. 


5. Having paid media works wonders in dissing the ground reality but when actuality spreads like fire in form of cremations, whom will you blame then? 



6. Just imagine the first stock deal of vaccines India did was in Jan 21; while other nations did it back in May 20.



7. Organized election rallies with thousands and thousands of people.


8. Allowed the Hindu festival gathering to happen and called it ""a blessing for corona"".

Students should not be forced to endure these immunizations until there are more significant long-term studies and examinations of the various implications and side effects of these drugs.

I had GBS 35 years ago.

I was also told not to get the flu vaccine because it could cause a flare. So, I have never been vaccinated for the flu and haven’t given much thought to that horrible time in my life until now. I desperately want the Covid vaccine and have tried to do some research, including talking to my doctor because I’m terrified of developing GBS again. She recommended I wait for more data, after more of the population is vaccinated and more data is available. I’m a white 55(f), with hypertension and RLS and I don’t take any medications.

&gt; Unanimous decision was taken after 14 states requested authorization for emergency importation of almost 30 million doses;

&gt;Three technical management s of the agency (medicines, inspection and monitoring) gave opinions against importation;

&gt; Anvisa pointed out that IT DID NOT receive a technical report capable of proving that the vaccine meets quality standards and could not locate the report with authorities from countries where the vaccine is applied;

&gt; Anvisa says that most countries that have authorized the application of the vaccine have no tradition in the analysis of medicines; moreover, in 23 countries with contracts, vaccination has not begun;

&gt; Drug Management pointed out several safety flaws associated with the development of the immunizer. In the most serious, he explained that the adenovirus used to carry the genetic material of the coronavirus should not replicate, but it is able to reproduce and can cause diseases;

&gt; Inspection and Inspection Management reported that Anvisa technicians were unable to visit all vaccine manufacturing sites during inspection in Russia; of the seven points provided, technicians were able to visit only three locations;

&gt; Russian Fund tried to cancel face-to-face inspection and did not authorize access to the Gamaleya Institute, which does quality control;
Anvisa was unable to identify the manufacturers of the vaccine's raw material.

&gt; The director Cristiane Joudan Gomes argued that safety is a key factor.

&gt; ""The presence of adenovirus (replicant) can lead to a series of consequences, until an emergence of manifestation and autoimmune diseases,"" Cristiane said.

&gt; ""The presence of a replicating adenovirus can have an impact on our safety when we use this vaccine. This virus, which was not to be replicating, can accumulate in specific tissues of the body, such as the kidneys"", explained Gustavo Mendes. In his exhibition, Mendes presented a document from the vaccine developer herself that admits the replication of the adenovirus.",,,1619493750,{},gw0e8bm,True,t3_mzcsf9,False,False,t3_mzcsf9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mzcsf9/brazil_health_regulators_technical_staff/gw0e8bm/,1619506378,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The president of the Association of Municipalities and Cities and mayor of Cluj, Emil Boc, participated, on Monday, in the meeting of the Government at which the strategy for accelerating the vaccination campaign was discussed. He announced that cultural activities had reopened, but access would be based on vaccination.

The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Cîțu, Minister of Health, Colonel Valeriu Gheorghiță and Secretary of State Andrei Baciu who met with the Association of Romanian Municipalities, the Association of Communes and the Association of County Councils.

"" There were two messages from the prime minister: you have all the support from the Government to support the measures at local or county level of vaccination. If you want drive-thru centers, mobile centers, if you want to organize vaccination marathons, if you want other campaigns to get closer to the community, you have the door open and the support of the Romanian Government "", said Emil Boc.

"" Also, from May 4, there will be an important campaign through family doctors. They are not obliged, but through the partnership with the mayors they can gather more family doctors in this campaign. The campaign will be voluntary, you can't force family doctors.

Johnson &amp; Johnson doses will also be available from May 4. That gives us the opportunity in drive-thru centers to make a single dose and in disadvantaged communities a single dose , ""he added.

""The economy needs to reopen gradually. Events, cultural activities, theaters, operas, cinemas, festivals, must reopen, with one condition: vaccination . ""

"" A horizon announced as soon as possible for the reopening of these activities will help us to better support the vaccination campaign, For example for festival-goers, if we tell them from now on"" it will be UNTOLD from August "" .  We will succeed only vaccine to fell COVID-19.

I am convinced that we will have festivals this year, both in Cluj and throughout the country.

1) WA reopened quite a lot a month ago; and 

2) Variants have finally become dominant in Washington State. Looking at a screenshot of a graph the governor showed while speaking last week: B.117 (the more infectious UK variant) is now \~60% of all new cases. P.1 (the Brazilian variant) grew from near zero cases at the start of April to \~20% of cases now. My personal guess is that P.1 crossed south from Canada after it swept through BC. The rest is mostly the B.1.429 (California) variant.

So the significantly more infectious variants combined with nice weather and a relaxing of Covid restrictions has led to an increase. Seattle isn't doing ""bad"" relatively as cities like Denver and NYC still have 50%+ higher cases per capita. It's just bad for Seattle/Washington State where we have kept cases levels relatively low all year.

As noted further down, our deaths have remained low. In King County ( [Summary of COVID vaccination among King County residents - King County](https://kingcounty.gov/depts/health/covid-19/data/vaccination.aspx) ) we have vaccinated 95% of 75+ and over 90% of the 65+ age group. P.1 does seem to hit younger folks hard and we are seeing a bump in hospitalizations among that group.

In King County only 51.3% of the 18-49 age group has been vaccinated (though this is increasing by more than 1% every day!). This is where we are seeing most of the spike as variants, nice weather, and 20 year olds no longer worried that they may kill their parents loosen up.

The recommendation for non-medical settings varies from 3 to 6 ACH, and the recommendation for medical settings dealing with COVID is about 8 ACH. 

Airplanes come pretty close to eliminating the risk. They have an ACH of 10-20 with 75% of air being replaced with air from outside. Apparently, that reduces viral load in the air by 99.7%.

The drug is called PF-07321332 (a very poetic name, I know) for now until it gets a formal generic name.  It belongs to a class of drugs called protease inhibitors.  Specifically, this drug inhibits a coronavirus protease called the 3CL-protease (3C-like protease)

**What's a protease inhibitor?**

Enzymes, which are like little molecular machines that catalyze reactions in living systems, are all named with the suffix ""-ase"" to indicate that they are enzymes.  A protease is an enzyme that breaks down proteins.  So this molecule stops a viral protease while (hopefully) leaving the other proteases in the body--the ones we need for normal function--alone.

**Why do viruses have proteases?**

In cells, one gene codes for one protein.  This makes sense.  We can turn certain genes on or off in certain cells and independently control the amount of protein that we make from each gene.  

For viruses, and particularly RNA viruses, this poses a problem.  Each gene carries a certain amount of genetic ""overhead"" and so having a whole bunch of genes stuffed into a single RNA virus of 10-30,000 bases is not something that an RNA virus can really sustain.  

One way around this problem is to take the genes for all the proteins and smash them together into one huge gene.  This makes a big, long *polyprotein* kind of like a string of pearls.  Each ""pearl"" is a viral protein and there are linkers between them like a string.  One of these ""pearls"" is the protease, which can snip itself out of this huge polyprotein and then break the polyprotein into smaller pieces.  Protease inhibitors block this  process.  As the first thing a coronavirus does after entering a cell is to produce an enormous polyprotein that is then clipped apart into pieces by two proteases that are part of this polyprotein.  One is called the PL (papain-like) protease and the other is the 3CL (3C-like) protease.  The 3C protease is classically found in polioviruses and the coronavirus version is similar.

**OK, but now we'll have a cure!**

Well, not so fast.  Let's say that we get through the safety and efficacy trials without a problem, antivirals for acute viral infections still aren't all that effective.  This is because the onset of symptoms signifies the onset of the immune response to the virus.  So right when you get sick from a virus, your immune system is kicking in and the viral load stops going up and starts to fall.  An antiviral only pushes it down faster.  

So while this pill might make people feel better faster and while this pill can be taken at home without an  IV, and the sooner we can get it on board, the better it will work.  But I don't expect this to be a silver bullet any more than oseltamivir (TAMIFLU) is.

The other thing is that this will be a pretty narrow-spectrum antiviral, really only effective against SARS-like betacoronaviruses (sarbecoviruses).  It's doubtful it will be very effective against future pandemics, though.

So this is a promising candidate drug.  We'll see if Pfizer can get it through its Phase III clinical trials fast enough.",,,1619496782,{},gw0j35m,False,t3_mz2t66,False,True,t3_mz2t66,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mz2t66/pfizer_is_testing_a_pill_that_if_successful_could/gw0j35m/,1619508885,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Businesses who still require masks will realize people, if given the choice, will just shop at a business that doesn't require them.

Now lets look at the actual polls in Iowa that it's referencing:

 * Quinnipiac said +1 with a MoE of 2.8, so that's as much as 3.8 Trump
 * DM Register +7 and 3.4 = 10.4
 * Emerson +1 and 3.9 = 4.9
 * InsiderAdvantage +2 and 4.9 = 6.9
 * PPP unknown MoE, so lets leave that out.

(3.8+10.4+4.9+6.9)/4 = +6.5 Trump is fairly close to the actual result of +8.2

But the result was the same either way, predicted Trump and Trump won it.

The only two states on the list that didn't go as predicted, were Florida and Georgia with a tiny +0.9D and +1R. But the margin of error for those ranged 3-3.5%, so the results changing weren't at all unexpected.

“According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, a total of 21 cases were confirmed in the country, of which 20 were found in airport quarantine and one was confirmed among domestic cases,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato, the government’s top spokesman, told a news conference Monday.

The government acknowledged for the first time last week that it had detected five cases of the ""double mutant"" variant, which has the features of two different viral mutations. India has also detected a “triple mutant” variant, and Kato said that the health ministry was looking into the situation.

The double variant, officially known as B.1.617, was first detected in India in October. India has become the global COVID-19 hot spot in recent weeks, setting world records for daily case numbers.

Although it's unclear whether the new variant has fueled the explosive spread of cases, the existence of the new strain has unnerved many observers, who fear it could impact the effectiveness of vaccines.
But Kato said there had been no definitive conclusion regarding the efficacy of vaccines against the double variant.

“The health ministry is working with other countries, the World Health Organization and experts to collect, evaluate and analyze information pertaining to variants, not just the one found in India,” Kato said, vowing to bolster quarantine arrangements as part of border control measures and screening for variants inside the country.

One senior administration official did acknowledge that stifling the variant completely within Japan would be “difficult” if it began to spread more widely.

I feel like this helps my point more than yours because they did ban the exports now, and they still won’t stop complaining about raw materials being blocked by the US. They just want to have their cake and eat it too. Also, if this is a valid justification for export bans in your conception, then I’d like to remind you that the US was getting crushed way harder than India for way longer than India when the US admin instated the export ban.

Covid 19 spreads more easily and is more deadly then the FLU. If it mutates again by being allowed to circulate it could become even worse then what it is now. the fact that flu deaths in the UK have plunged 95% during the winter lock down but COVID took weeks to stop it spreading shows just how more spreadable this virus is. 

The fact other diseases might mutate is not an excuse to ignore a current problem. My car has a flat tyre, I dont ignore it on the bases the other 3 might go flat at some point in the future. The flu isn't currently destroying India, it hasn't taken the parent of 40,000 American children in a single year.

South Atlanta and some of its more Black suburbs, New Orleans, the inner core of Baltimore (the suburbs should be fine), parts of Chicago, and others will likely fail to get close to herd immunity. 

The South is struggling the most with vaccine demand because on one hand you have the Republican anti-vaccination nonsense in the rural areas and more conservative parts of the suburbs/exurbs sand on the other you have a large Black population that is also vaccine hesitant and distrusts the medical system as a whole (partly because of atrocities committed in the past, also likely for modern reasons of seeing others bankrupt themselves through the broken medical system we have today). 

While most folks here like to beat up on nonsense Republicans have created (and rightfully so), we don't spend enough time talking about the Black vaccine hesitation problem. While the political perspectives and underlying justification for vaccine refusal could not be any different, ironically, much of it is the same underlying issue: low-education, low-income White rural Republicans have a lot of similarities to low-education and low-income Black populations that are most likely refuse vaccines. They're both on the bottom rung of the socioeconomic ladder and have been failed by our education and medical systems holistically.

Six people tested positive within 14 days of attending the gig in Barcelona, but the incidence was lower than that seen in the general population.

Around 5,000 music fans took part in the experiment after testing negative for Covid-19.

Revellers wore masks but did not have to socially distance.

Of the six people who tested positive, researchers concluded that four of them were infected elsewhere, not at the event itself.

Spanish authorities let the show, featuring band Love of Lesbian, go ahead as part of a research project.

The rate of infection among attendees was half the rate of people of the same age in Barcelona, researchers found.

""There is no sign that suggests transmission took place during the event,"" infectious disease specialist Josep Maria Llibre told a news conference on Tuesday.

The band involved in the experiment, Love of Lesbian, thanked the event's organisers and scientific advisers.

""We hope that from now on, after these excellent results, the world of culture will be listened to as it deserves to be,"" it tweeted.

They don't really understand why this virus works in waves and doesn't exponentially grow (as they feared). They don't know how this vaccine is going to hold up. I'd argue it's less political than it is moral for them. They are damned if they do open up early and damned if they don't. I'd love thresholds and algorithms to open up but I think the people making them would know they are bullshit. UK made a super slow lockdown reopen and already people are complaining because cases are doing better than expected.

There is a possibility that manufacturers may be able to replicate Moderna's vaccine based purely on the patents and either experience (which is not something most developing countries would have when it comes to mRNA technology) or significant trial and error in the development process.

Being from a developing country with the ability to manufacture vaccines locally, I'm fairly certain that our primary local manufacturer would go with the first option, simply because I am well aware that they have not produced an mRNA vaccine before. I have no doubt they would be able to do so with a tech transfer. On the other hand, I cannot see them being willing to waste time and money if there is any degree of guesswork involved in the formulation.

I think the jury is still out on that. There's a hypothesis that natural immunity won't last as long as the vaccine, but in the 0-9 month window the efficacy of real infection vs vaccine is roughly the same. 

The vaccines have a 90-95% reduction rate in symptomatic disease. People who have had symptomatic cases of covid are very close to the same. (note: symptomatic disease is the way the vaccines are measured for efficacy. asymptomatic infection rates for the vaccines are not known)

The new case is an Indonesian woman in her 40s who is the wife of a CAL cargo pilot who tested positive for COVID-19 in Australia on April 20. She was required to go into quarantine on April 21, the CECC said.

She tested negative for the disease on her first and second day in quarantine, but began to have coronavirus symptoms on April 26. A third COVID-19 test came back positive on Tuesday, the CECC said.

The woman is the second domestic COVID-19 case Taiwan has seen in the past week. The first case was the son of the CAL pilot.

As of Tuesday, a total 11 cases of COVID-19 linked to CAL, one of Taiwan's largest carriers, had been reported in the past week. One of these cases was reported in Australia and is not included in Taiwan's case count.

The 11 cases include two Taiwanese cargo pilots who flew to the U.S. together, two Indonesian pilots (one of whom was confirmed with COVID-19 in Australia) who visited a mosque in Taipei together, two family members of one of the Indonesian pilots, and five other Taiwanese pilots.

Besides the domestic case, Taiwan also reported five new imported COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, bringing the total number of cases reported in the country to 1,110 since the outbreak began.

Straight from the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Pfizer-BioNTech.html).

&gt;	Based on evidence from clinical trials, the Moderna vaccine was 94.1% effective at preventing laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 illness in people who received two doses who had no evidence of being previously infected.

Oh look, [Moderna too](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/moderna.html).

For the masking, I have one question for you: how is it that masking is all that big a deal, when multiple states have lifted the mandates/never had them, yet there haven’t been “major outbreaks” like everyone predicted? If they were that good, they should have at least seen a decent rise.

Not everyone can. But they’re the outlier. [85% of people over 65 (who are more at risk than anyone else) have gotten at least one shot](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations). Almost 70% have had both doses. And part of that is due to the anti-vaxxer Dr. Fauci who’s spread so much fear about the vaccine (not as good as wearing a mask, still can’t gather in groups, continue to social distance) that people are wondering why they should even take it if nothing will change.

&gt;	Although children can be infected with SARS-CoV-2, can get sick from COVID-19, and can spread the virus to others, less than 10% of COVID-19 cases in the United States have been among children and adolescents aged 5–17 years (COVID Data Tracker). Compared with adults, children and adolescents who have COVID-19 are more commonly asymptomatic (never develop symptoms) or have mild, non-specific symptoms.4-11 Similar to adults with SARS-CoV-2 infections, children can spread SARS-CoV-2 to others when they don’t have symptoms or have mild, non-specific symptoms and thus might not know that they are infected and infectious. Children are less likely to develop severe illness or die from COVID-19.6,12-15 Nonetheless, 203 COVID-19 deaths among persons ages 0–18 have been reported to the National Center for Health Statistics through January 27, 2021.

According to the 2010 census, there are 74.2 million people younger than 18 in the US. 203 people in that age range have died of covid. Please explain how a 0.00000274% chance of death is concerning? They’re more likely to die on the way to school than at school of covid.

&gt;	For example, several population screening studies found lower incidences of SARS-CoV-2 infection among children under age 10 compared with adolescents or adults.18,21,24 Studies that traced household contacts and tested all contacts of index cases, regardless of symptom status, have also found lower rates of infection among children compared with adults.19,20,23,25 The questions of susceptibility and infectivity among children and adolescents require further study to explore potential explanations and mechanisms.

[Sounds like the jury’s still out on if kids are super-spreaders](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/transmission_k_12_schools.html).

They’re going to have to move on eventually though. It’s not the job of everyone in the country to stop a relative few amount of people from being scared. They can mask up, social distance, all that. But everyone else can get on with their lives.

&gt;Your son or daughter may not be able to attend their first day of school until they are fully vaccinated. While these regulations were established to help protect all children, the amount of unknown risks associated with vaccinations will have you seriously second-guessing whether this policy should be upheld.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rather than helping children’s immune systems, there is a large belief in the United States that the excess of mandatory vaccines is actually damaging them. In fact, in the past 20 years, U.S. statistics prove that children are experiencing doubled rates of Attention Deficit Disorder and learning disabilities, doubled rates of asthma, tripled rates of diabetes, and a rise in autism in every single state at the rate of 600 percent.  
&gt;  
&gt;A lot of kids are suffering and it is up to us as a Miami international school community to rule out any and all possibilities contributing to the rise in chronic diseases and disabilities for our students. Before we, as a school, mandate anything that could possibly be causing so much harm to our students, studies need to be urged to be conclusive as to whether common mandatory vaccinations lead to various common health disorders. Families and children should have medical freedom. Students should not be forced to endure these immunizations until there are more significant long-term studies and examinations of the various implications and side effects of these drugs.  
&gt;  
&gt;At CA we believe in health freedom. We know that every child and family at our school is unique. There is no one size fits all to vaccines. This is why we follow the Florida law and allow our parents to complete a medical or religious exemption form to opt out of the school vaccination program. If you need any support in understanding the process further, please complete our contact us form and we will further assist you with this process.

Roselle Monestime Noel, a 68-year-old home healthcare aide from North Miami, tried to get a coronavirus vaccine for two months.

It shouldn’t have been so hard, Noel thought. Her age and job made her among the first group eligible under Florida’s vaccine rollout. But the odds were against her from the start.

herd immunity is essentially a game of probability. Getting vaccinated lowers your chances of getting infected. Say for the sake of argument, if a sick person runs into a non-vaccinated person that person has a 5% chance of getting sick, but if they run into a vaccinated person that person has a 0.1% chance of getting sick. Obviously these aren't the real numbers, but it makes the math easier and it shows what's going on.

Now say a sick person runs into 100 people. If no one is vaccinated, you'll expect a single sick person to infect 5 people. Each of those people will then turn around and run into more people and the virus will grow and grow.

Instead, lets assume that 90% of the population is vaccinated. So the sick person runs into 10 non vaccinated people, 90 vaccinated people. Then you expect only around .59 people to get sick. Most of the time, either just one more person gets vaccinated or no one else gets vaccinated. Thus, instead of growing and growing the virus eventually dies off because it just isn't able to infect enough people. 

However, using these numbers, if only 70% of the population is vaccinated you'd expect ~1.57 people to get virus. While that is still certainly better than the virus spreading uncontrolled, it means the virus will continue to spread exponentially putting everyone at risk.

Thus, in order allow herd immunity to work and ensure the virus is defeated as soon as possible there is a moral imperative for everyone to get vaccinated and anyone who refused to do so is a amoral determent to society.",,,1619482894,{},gvztp7q,False,t3_mytxmq,False,True,t1_gvzoo88,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mytxmq/gen_z_millennials_are_becoming_americas_biggest/gvztp7q/,1619495724,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

No...that is very very bad because it is a confession that the vaccine is a population extermination tool.

The only question now is how long before the vaccinated start dying from the delayed reaction that they were all designed to cause.

By the time that the news media can no longer censor the vaccine death toll and Big tech fails to censor it via social media, it will be too late for millions of gullible people.

My only question is what new form of government will prevail after this population IQ test has been completed and all that are left alive are the ones who passed by declining to obey the TV talking heads and social media peer-pressure.  Only the ones smart enough to escape this global version of the Jim Jones kool-aid will get to find out.  One thing is sure.

I personally think that the study should be taken with a grain of salt. For starters, I find it strange that the authors didn't perform any formal hypothesis testing--From what I can tell, they're comparing percentages/prevalence without any statistical rigor in their analysis. It just feels strange to make definitive claims without having hard analysis to back it up.

&amp;#x200B;

Second point; The cases that the authors have data on may not even be representative of the population that they are comparing them to (see the asterisk \* in table 4 of the paper). Their goal it seems was to prove that pregnant/new mothers who were vaccinated did not experience a higher incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes, relative to the general population. However, the women they do have data on (from VAERS and V-safe) may not be representative of the general population, so it really hinders their ability to draw firm conclusions.

This is the key factor. The virus is new to humans, we have no immunity. Bats have not only immunity but other mechanisms like repairing cell damage and suppressing inflammation. Vaccines are a way for humans to build immunity. That’s why vaccinations are so important. The biological mechanisms are very different between humans and bats so you can’t cross correlate what works in bats would work in humans in the same manner. Instead you have to look to how the virus behaves in humans and extrapolate from what other viruses that are known to affect humans to unravel a response.

If they were smoking a cigarette and you could smell it, the aerosols from their mouth could reach you and infect you. Fleeting contact is whatever and negligible risk, but that's a very different thing from outdoors in general.

Even if you take the pessimistic end of the CI in the first study, ~58x less likely to spread is a ton of covid cases originating from outdoors, and of course the US's entire second wave occurred because of the 4th of July, an outdoor holiday.

Also, it's a piece of cloth. It is LITERALLY the least you can do.

&gt;  We've known since early on that given proper air flow you can sit in the same room as someone who is sick and not get infected.

India actually exported a lot of vaccines until the shit recently hit the fan.

Reasons as to why blame for CoronaVirus 2nd wave is completely on Modi Government

1.	⁠They didn't allow foreign vaccines. Said we're self sufficient with Indian. Didn't allow private firms to manufacture COVIDSHIELD or COVAXIN.
2.	⁠Following above they didn't increase manufacturing capabilities. SII was under contractual obligation ; they had to send 100 million vaccines but only were able to send 18 million. Following which UK filed a lawsuit against them. For imported vaccines took praise on themselves.
3.	⁠Age cap blunder by allowing only 45+ citizens to get vaccinated. Indian Boomer population will bang thalis rather than getting a vaccine. The disinformation campaigns have been huge.
4.	⁠They didn't increase oxygen production since last year.
5.	⁠Having paid media works wonders in dissing the ground reality but when actuality spreads like fire in form of cremations, whom will you blame then?
6.	⁠Just imagine the first stock deal of vaccines India did was in Jan 21; while other nations did it back in May 20.
7.	⁠Organized election rallies with thousands and thousands of people.
8.	⁠Allowed the Hindu festival gathering to happen and called it ""a blessing for corona"".

&gt;The Covid-19 vaccine being made by Valneva in Livingston, West Lothian has entered phase 3 trials, with a call for 4,000 volunteers.

&gt;The trial, set to begin this week, will compare Valneva’s vaccine against the already-approved jag made by AstraZeneca.

&gt;It comes after positive results from Valneva’s phase 1 and 2 trials, with the vaccine well-tolerated and no safety concerns identified.

&gt;The UK has ordered 100 million doses of the Valneva vaccine, which are set to be delivered at the end of 2021 and beginning of 2022.

&gt;With all adults due to have been vaccinated by the end of the summer, Valneva hopes its vaccine will be used as a booster jag or as a modified vaccine which is more effective against new variants of Covid-19.

SNIP

&gt;Valneva’s candidate is an inactivated whole virus vaccine, which contains virus that has been destroyed so cannot infect cells, but can still trigger an immune response.

&gt;The technology is used in flu, polio and rabies vaccines, and it’s a more traditional approach than the Pfizer (mRNA) and AstraZeneca (adenoviral) vaccines.

&gt;Because the vaccine doesn’t contain any live virus, it may be especially suitable for vulnerable people, such as the elderly or those with weaker immune systems.",,,1619521090,{},gw1buf5,True,t3_mzltxp,False,True,t3_mzltxp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mzltxp/call_for_4000_volunteers_as_valneva_begins_phase/gw1buf5/,1619524217,2,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Navo Covax is developed by the Nanogen Pharmaceutical Biotechnology JSC.

The second stage trials of the vaccine were conducted on 560 volunteers divided into four groups, with 80 people injected with a placebo and three other groups administered with 25mcg, 50mcg, and 75mcg doses. However, only 554 received second shots because six people withdrew from the trial.

All of the vaccinated volunteers have developed antibodies against COVID-19 at different levels.

Regarding the antibody index to neutralise the virus, people injected with 25mcg dose got the highest index with more than 90 percent at 14 days after the second shot and 42 days since the first jabs.

The research team is expected to submit a report to the Research Ethics Committee of the Ministry of Health on April 27 and propose a plan for the third phase of human trials, possibly on May 5.

The third phase of human trials is expected to involve 10,000-15,000 people in both Vietnam and Asian countries with severe coronavirus outbreaks. Volunteers will be administered with 25mcg – the only dose for this stage. Each person will receive two jabs. They are set to get second shots of Nano Covax 28 days after the first one.

Navo Covax vaccine started testing on humans on December 17 last year and has completed the second phase. It is prepared to enter the third phase, the final stage of testing before mass production.

The first-stage trials of Nano Covax showed the vaccine was safe and vaccinated volunteers had antibodies against the UK variant (B117).

Based on the results of the first and second phases, experts are optimistic that if the tests are successful, the third phase of the trial will be completed at the end of the third quarter, shortening the research by three months compared to previously planned.

Meanwhile, more than 209,600 Vietnamese people have been vaccinated against COVID-19 so far.

The Ministry of Health said that by 4pm on Sunday, the 209,632 vaccinated people included frontline doctors, medical staff, sample collectors, contact tracers, members of community-based anti-COVID-19 groups as well as members of the Steering Committees for COVID-19 Prevention and Control of localities./.",,,1619526630,{},gw1k1rb,True,t3_mzndde,False,True,t3_mzndde,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mzndde/vietnam_completes_second_stage_of_homegrown_nano/gw1k1rb/,1619528913,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

He made the request during a Cabinet meeting on COVID-19 prevention and control on April 26 morning, which was held amid the complex developments of the pandemic in the world.

According to a document on the meeting outcomes, issued by the Government Office, the PM pointed out the high risk of pandemic resurgence in Vietnam as its neighbouring countries are facing spikes in cases.

Given this, it is hard to complete the dual tasks of socio-economic development and pandemic combat, he said.

The leader urged ministries, agencies and localities to get updated on the COVID-19 situation at home and in foreign countries, and seriously implement prevention and control measures.

He reiterated the need to follow the Ministry of Health’s 5K message: khau trang (facemask), khu khuan (disinfection), khoang cach (distance), khong tu tap (no gathering) and khai bao y te (health declaration).

Any violations should be strictly punished in line with regulations of the Party and law of the State, the PM noted.

The Ministry of National Defence, the Ministry of Public Security, provincial-level People’s Committees and relevant ministries and agencies need to step up inspections over the observance of quarantine regulations, he continued.

He ordered limiting mass gatherings and wearing masks in public places, especially in festivals.

Northwestern border provinces should coordinate with the Ministries of National Defence and Public Security, and closely cooperate with neighbouring countries in controlling immigration via roads and sea routes.

Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health should enhance international cooperation to expand the access to COVID-19 vaccines and quick testing techniques, while facilitating vaccine production at home, the PM said./.",,,1619526512,{},gw1juld,True,t3_mznbsi,False,True,t3_mznbsi,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mznbsi/pm_vietnam_not_allowed_to_ease_guard_against/gw1juld/,1619528794,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I think next pandemic (which hopefully is far far far away), the EU will know they need to have that kind of articles in the contract (basically we order x doses, with a guaranteed delivery of y doses for example) and that pharma companies will also be more cautious in how much product they can deliver (eg Pfizer).

There was a negligible difference in the number of positive cases between the two groups, and the vaccination had a minimal effect in reducing the severity of the infections that were recorded.   


That study was specifically designed for the prevailing epidemiological conditions in SA and the effect of our second wave. You should remember that a 28-day gap between doses was implemented to determine whether it was possible to gain a measurable degree of protection from (a) the first shot, and (b) the second shot after a less than optimal interim period. The primary intention was to begin to use vaccines to halt the progression of the surge that was raging at the time. Had the vaccines we received from SII not been due to expire in April, we might have been able to investigate the efficacy if a longer period was employed between the administration of the doses. Even if we had had started administering the doses immediately, that expiry date would have forced us to apply a truncated period between doses or prioritise first doses to more recipients. That study established that AZ did not offer adequate protection in either of these cases, irrespective of its small size.   


You can't simply translate the results of an SA study that was designed for a very specific situation, against a different variant, into the current situation in India. At this stage, the point is not to prevent infection altogether but to prevent severe illness, hospitalisation and death, and consequently reduce the massive pressure under which the Indian health care system is currently operating. South African scientists conducted their own study **because** the nature of the variant made it impossible to rely on foreign data or early clinical trial results. None of the other variants have, to date, exhibited the same degree of evasiveness as B1.351 despite having similar mutations. Countries need to conduct their own studies when variants arise, under their own unique conditions, before they make a decision as important as rejecting a vaccine. As it is, infection is still possible between the doses of the mRNA vaccines - even if it is asymptomatic - but if a vaccine, any vaccine, is effective in preventing severe disease, hospitalisation or death, **it should absolutely be used**. Together with the antibodies provided by fighting a COVID infection, this should be sufficient to provide a significant degree of immunity.   


On that note, the fact that people can, and do, get infected after being vaccinated, or during the vaccination process, public health measures such as masks and social distancing should still be universally respected for at least as long as it takes to fully vaccinate the targeted number of recipients + the period until they are regarded as fully vaccinated.",,,1619526276,{},gw1jgan,False,t3_mzil5k,False,True,t1_gw15ibj,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mzil5k/daily_discussion_thread_april_27_2021/gw1jgan/,1619528556,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

That's a very emotional subject for me. So many stories. He refused to engage with bribes period, and had zillions of opportunities - he was an engineer/manager at a government power plant, and because of his relentless integrity, he was put in charge of purchasing and contracts for many years. During festivals (especially Diwali), we used to receive 'gifts' - sweets, cloth, firecrackers - from people bidding for business - we were taught to return them all. I distinctly remember getting scolded for opening up a box of sweets that showed up at our door. People would file frivolous lawsuits against him to harass him endlessly when he refused to do shady stuff. But over time, the fact that he always always always did the right thing, never picked favorites and deeply cared about others more than himself came through. I was finally able to visit India this Jan-March, and it was heartening to receive condolences from former colleagues, factory workers, former drivers and servants, slum-dwelling kids he taught after retirement at a non-profit - all of them went out of their way to emphasize how much they missed and respected him. Lots of tears.

When I was around 13-14, we had traveled to Bihar for some exam I wanted to take. He and I couldn't get tickets on the train back, but the conductor had hoarded a few and discreetly offered them to us for a surcharge. My dad refused, and we ended up having to spend the night huddled on the cold railway platform. I was pissed off! It broke his heart (he was sad about it for many years) to have me suffer that, but that's the kind of person he was.

He was highly inspired by American values - the elementary school he attended was founded by an American expat lady, perhaps that's where it came from. I am so happy that he was able to visit here a couple of times.

Really goes to show that one's deepest inner character never really stays hidden, even if there might be no immediate consequences or rewards. It shapes everyone around you and connects with others at a purer, subconscious level. We were very middle class - couldn't afford a car - in the boondocks of India - the only English newspaper came 2.5 days late. But it really always felt like we were doing something right. And my sister ended up getting into the best law school in India, first ever from our town. I went to the best engineering school in India - and an Ivy league grad school. Much more importantly, we are sensible, well adjusted, empathetic individuals. My dad's honesty and integrity is truly the gift that keeps on giving.

&gt;**When can we expect a resolution to the case?**  
&gt;  
&gt;By opting for an interlocutory proceeding, the European Commission hopes for a swift resolution.  
&gt;  
&gt;The spokesperson told Euronews that the executive expects the judge to issue a judgement ""within three to seven weeks from the filing of the claim"", a timeline that Van Calster also considers feasible provided the judge believes there is merit in the case.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The idea is to go in \[for\] a quick procedure for measures that can be quickly delivered because there is also a possibility of a long-term procedure which will rule on the whole contract,"" the scholar said, noting that Belgian courts tend to be slow when it comes to in-depth examinations.  
&gt;  
&gt;""That's precisely why the Commission \[has\] gone for the interlocutory proceeding. The downside of such an interim proceeding is that you cannot ask a judge to go through the onset of the contract. You're going to have to ask the judge to only come to conclusions that are clearly easy to make on the basis of provisions which you would argue are without any doubt.""  
&gt;  
&gt;The Commission believes it has enough good arguments to make the judge rule in its favour. Meanwhile, AstraZeneca has said it will ""strongly defend itself in court"".

I'll just link to [this review](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/223/4/550/6009483?login=true).  The short of it is that the authors largely agree with your point.  Even though, every study that they look at finds ~20x more cases associated with indoor transmission than outdoor, they don't actually control for anything.  Everything points to dramatically reduced outdoor transmission; however, it is still possible to counteract that with behavior.

&gt; Because when most of the large outdoor components have a strong indoor component with people shoulder to shoulder at some, then what is the point in differentiating in this example?

I would argue that there isn't, in that case?  You would have to add the indoor risk and the outdoor risk, to find your total risk.  That said, I think it would have made more sense to just ban things that would require this altogether (large, outdoor events) than to require outdoor masking.

I will also note that I would have also cited the BLM protests as an example, since there was no measurable increase in spread after them, but [that has been studied, too](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27408/w27408.pdf) and there are alternative explanations.  This paper is really interesting!

Don’t worry though, the CDC is about to announce guidance for no outdoor masking for vaccinated people today and then you can keep this illusion up that you’re actually following the science rather than offloading your ability to process information to a body whose only goal is disease elimination rather than a more holistic view of life and its inherent risks.

As a case example, Mississippi is probably the worst state in terms hesitant populations (lots of rural Republicans and lots of Blacks - and overall it is a very low education / low income state). They're at only 30% of the population vaccinated. That's only 38% or so of adults. And it's crawling up at best: first doses have only risen by 2 percentage points over the past two weeks. Second doses are clearly not being taken (only 29% of adults are fully vaccinated; if all had gotten their second dose it should be at 34%). Mississippi will not achieve herd immunity, at least not without a significant push campaign to get them there.

As a healthcare worker with a knowledge of viruses and presumably a pretty good idea about isolation rooms, wouldn't you agree that isolating organisms even under ideal conditions is VERY difficult?

Wouldn't you agree that keeping a workplace truly safe from droplets is a next to impossible task unless it is being operated with the same kind of careful adherence to procedure as we use in isolation rooms?

If your answer is no then you must admit that you are truly living in fear.

We're ALL going to be exposed to some variant of  this virus eventually because it's impossible to effectively lock it down.  You can't lock down a virus anymore than you can air condition your backyard.

All that lockdowns and masks and social distancing do is slow the rate of infection at best.  At worst they just delay the inevitable, destroy economies, delay other forms of healthcare delivery, and create general misery for the general population.  

That, my friend is living in reality.  Anything else is akin to leaving a stack of $20 bills on your front steps overnight and expecting nobody to steal them.

Hell, I'm gonna die one of these days from something because I'm gettin' old. Probably won't be COVID but if it is, fine.  I'm not going to blame buddy next door for not wearing his PPE while walking the dog outside or the grocery story patron who's mask drops under her nose.  That's just being unreasonable.  That's not being realistic.

Natural selection is a process that operates on an INDIVIDUAL level.  IOW, collectives may support each other on the basis of shared values, but the general population has few if any shared values.  People have to be coerced even to not steal your shit and rape each other.

And viruses go viral.  Imagine that.",,,1619530451,{},gw1r540,False,t3_muqahf,False,True,t1_gw0px0n,/r/Coronavirus/comments/muqahf/some_dealing_with_reentry_anxiety_as_covid/gw1r540/,1619533188,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The idea that ""vaccines don't stop transmission"" is just another way of saying ""vaccines reduce your symptoms but you can still be an asymptomatic spreader"", more or less.

The way you test this hypothesis is by randomly testing people every week, rather than just testing people ***with symptoms***. This way you can catch ***asymptomatic*** covid.

I agree with this in general but the situation here is just so absurdly lopsided. We’re not talking about killing one person so we can give their organs to save 5 other people.

I’d say the most important thing to consider with the CDC is that they are simply not sure. That doesn’t mean they are being dishonest. They just aren’t sure enough to give you concrete dates, times, and concrete guidance. So instead the guidance they give is based on the data the data they have on hand.

But what you're describing (if you want to take your mask off outside / want to know when they'll no longer be needed inside, it can only be because you're *one of them*) is an example of all-or-nothing thinking. And all-or-nothing thinking just sucks.

Again, hopefully keeping it within the confines of what's politically kosher here: this type of thinking pretty much always crops up when you have a pandemic. People need villains and scapegoats. If you look through history, pandemics are associated with accusing and blaming ""unclean"" subgroups of the population. In a really twisted way, I guess it's sort of an improvement that social media has allowed people to take out all their aggression along politically tribal lines on Twitter, whereas in the past you'd see stuff like auto-da-fes and beatings.

But none of that makes all-or-nothing thinking any less fallacious. We're not children here. If somebody chooses to perpetuate the all-or-nothing fallacy, it's on them.

Black hesitancy towards vaccination is not monolithic. The issue of vaccination doesn’t take into account whether vaccine centers are being located in neighborhoods that have high minority populations.  Access to the vaccines is a big issue.  

In Philadelphia, I had to drive over an hour outside of my city to the rural parts of Pennsylvania to get vaccinated because it was impossible to get an appointment in Philly.

I think maybe the difference is that they can't store as many vials relative to a mass vaccine site, but on the other hand, those pharmacies don't have as much staffing to give nearly as many shots in a day as the mass vax sites either so it kind of evens out. 

I agree in theory that going into the communities is going to be how we get more people moving forward. For the most part, the people who have the willingness and/or ability to schedule their day around taking a special trip to get vaccinated have done so. 

So now we need to try and meet people where they are - the easier we make it for people to get vaccinated without disrupting much of their daily life, the better off we'll all be. I think there should be mobile vaccination sites that drive into the communities where people are more likely to be reliant on public transportation, where people are more likely to work jobs on shifts other than an office 9-5, etc.

&gt; Inactivated Vaccines: Effectiveness
&gt; Except for inactivated influenza vaccine, vaccination during chemotherapy or radiation therapy should be avoided if possible because antibody response might be suboptimal. Patients vaccinated within a 14-day period before starting immunosuppressive therapy or while receiving immunosuppressive therapy should be considered unimmunized and should be revaccinated at least 3 months after therapy is discontinued if immune competence has been restored. Patients who have quantitative B-cell deficiencies and are receiving immunoglobulin therapy should not receive either inactivated or live vaccines while receiving the immunoglobulin therapy because of concerns about effectiveness of the vaccines.  Patients on chemotherapy with anti-B cell antibodies (e.g., rituximab) should wait at least 6 months after therapy before being vaccinated with inactivated vaccines. Some experts recommended longer than 6 months for some anti-B cell antibodies. For other forms of altered immunocompetence, if inactivated vaccines are indicated, the usual schedules are recommended. However, the effectiveness of such vaccinations might be suboptimal (1).**

 

&gt; Live, Attenuated Viral and Bacterial Vaccines: Effectiveness
&gt; The same rationale regarding effectiveness that exists with inactivated vaccines also exists with live vaccines.

 

&gt; Live, Attenuated Viral and Bacterial Vaccines: Safety
&gt; Severe complications have followed vaccination with certain live, attenuated viral and live, attenuated bacterial vaccines among persons with altered immunocompetence (18-26). Persons with most forms of altered immunocompetence should not receive live vaccines (MMR, varicella, MMRV, LAIV, yellow fever, Ty21a oral typhoid, BCG, smallpox, and rotavirus). However, exceptions exist, and are discussed in this section ...




https://primaryimmune.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Immunization-Of-The-Immunocompromised-Host.pdf


&gt; Assessment of vaccine efficacy in immunocompromised patients is further complicated because efficacy is often assessed indirectly by measuring antibody responses rather than protection against infection and disease. In the normal population, there often appears to be a correlation between antibody level and protection. Although this would imply that immunization of patients unable to mount an antibody response would have no benefit, this assumption has never been verified.

...

&gt; Vaccine safety, efficacy and potential benefit are critically dependent upon the nature and degree of immunodeficiency in an individual patient. Not all immunodeficiencies are alike, and broad recommendations for the vaccination of immunocompromised persons may not be universally applicable. The risks and benefits of vaccination should be considered in the context of the specificity and magnitude of the immune deficits within the individual patient.

In short, it depends on the way that their immune system is compromised and how severe it is, as well as how the vaccine functions. Best case you can assume a weakened effect, at worst some vaccines are outright dangerous to administer to immune compromised individuals.",,,1619533940,{},gw1ynye,False,t3_mz7aqe,False,True,t1_gw1x1gw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mz7aqe/a_texas_hospital_system_will_require_employees_to/gw1ynye/,1619537826,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Why would you make doses that could expire before they get used? That would be monumentally stupid. Part of the reason behind the donations to Mexico and Canada was because said doses would expire before the US approved them.

It makes sense to either get FDA approval or confirmation those doses will be exported eg. the announcement today, before bottling them up. That process will take a couple of months. So May or June as expected.

AZ has also been kicked out of one of their main production facilities by the US government and a lot of it's failures are down to the subcontractor Emergent Biosciences who also screwed over J&amp;J. A lot of the issues aren't necessarily the fault of AZ.

It's bullshit, because it confuses the issue to imply that the moment you're vaccinated you're no longer accountable to anyone but yourself, which isn't true. It takes a good two weeks post-second dose to establish maximum immunity, it's not clear if vaccinated people can still spread the virus, and it's essential to continue the general policy masking indoors because otherwise people without vaccinations would also go maskless. 

There are numerous valid reasons why having an approved vaccine doesn't mean we can immediately reopen. It doesn't mean we can *never* reopen--nobody is saying that.

The State Supreme Court ruled that religious vaccine exemption was unconstitutional under the Mississippi state law. There was a case in 1979 (Brown vs. Stone):

&gt;In Brown v. Stone, the court heard the case of Chad Brown, a six year old about to enter the first grade. His family were members of the Church of Christ, and his father was a chiropractor and strong opponent of vaccination. The family sought a religious exemption from the state, and were denied, as the state only allowed religious exemptions if the request came from a “recognized” denomination whose teachings require reliance on prayer or spiritual means of healing. They challenged the law, and the court agreed that the law was unconstitutional – to restrict a religious exemption to a list of “recognized” religions was discriminatory. But instead of agreeing with the Browns that a broader religious exemption was what was needed, the Court said the health of children, and the public’s health, were too important to allow people to opt out of based on personal beliefs. [Source](https://blog.petrieflom.law.harvard.edu/2015/02/05/rdsilvermanmsvax/#:~:text=In%20Brown%20v.,to%20enter%20the%20first%20grade.&amp;text=They%20challenged%20the%20law%2C%20and,%E2%80%9Crecognized%E2%80%9D%20religions%20was%20discriminatory.)

So yes, Mississippi leads the country on childhood vaccinations because only medical exemptions (signed off by a doctor AND reviewed by the State board on an individual basis) exempt folks from vaccination. 

Mississippi has a great vaccination record not because people voluntarily get their kids vaccinated. They have a great vaccination record because the state has a no-nonsense policy to vaccination - mostly because in the 70s there were so many kids *not* getting vaccinated that it was a big public health issue (coincidentally around the very topic of herd immunity which was referenced extensively in the case) and meaning that inherently equal protection was not being granted to religious and non-religious sects (non-religious / vaccine-supporting sects were being implicitly discriminated against because they were being put at harm for other's religions).

Up until a few years back, Mississippi and West Virginia were the only two states that did not allow religious exemption.

A couple of days after that, my father had a cough and body ache; however, these symptoms are normal side effects of the vaccine and he thought nothing of it. Since we were going to travel together, on Wednesday (31st of March) we got tested for covid and my father tested positive. However, his CT value was 31 and he was completely asymptomatic for the next 10 days. The only indication that he had covid was that his DDimer levels were elevated. These remained elevated for the next week and then came back down to normal. He tested negative around 10 days after he tested positive and never showed any symptoms.On Thursday (22nd of April), my father got a fever, cough, and weakness. So, he tested for covid, and his test came positive again, this time with a much more severe CT level of 15. He's been showing symptoms for the past 6 days - coughing, weakness, and fever. However, his Oxygen levels are fine and he has not lost his sense of taste or smell.Since we are in India, hospitals are fulls and doctors are completely unavailable. However, we were able to talk to a doctor who recommended a SARS-COV-2 SPIKE ANTIBODIES test and a CT scan. My father's bloodwork is completely fine and his CT scan is clear.

2. we have learned more; please wear a face covering and keep distancing, this is the most important thing because we've learned this is aerosolized, and not as touch-dependant as we feared. no need to keep wiping down the groceries.

3. we are developing vaccines using new-ish mRNA technology. the science is not new, but we are close to producing a vaccine in record time with the new process.

4. the vaccines are here, and tested as 'safe and effective' for emergency use. we promise we have tested it, and you should take it. if we can immunize enough people we can reach herd immunity and avoid future outbreaks.

5. We are steadily vaccinating, great job everyone. once we reach a level of immunity in your community, we should see much less viral transmission around your city, and any outbreaks should be generally contained, rather than spread via unvaccinated people using spaced around other unvaccinated people.

\&gt;It is one of three factories that The Associated Press found on three continents whose owners say they could start producing hundreds of millions of COVID-19 vaccines on short notice if only they had the blueprints and technical know-how. But that knowledge belongs to the large pharmaceutical companies who have produced the first three vaccines authorized by countries including Britain, the European Union and the U.S. — Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca. The factories are all still awaiting responses.

Across Africa and Southeast Asia, governments and aid groups, as well as the World Health Organization, are calling on pharmaceutical companies to share their patent information more broadly to meet a [yawning global shortfall](https://apnews.com/article/europe-immunizations-coronavirus-pandemic-united-nations-611ca364df6235099be95548c3c22c4d) in a pandemic that already has claimed over [2.5 million lives](https://apnews.com/article/gobal-death-toll-coronavirus-2-million-19c7f4611df0a8635ebb83f833c7b89f). Pharmaceutical companies that took taxpayer money from the U.S. or Europe to develop inoculations at unprecedented speed say they are negotiating contracts and exclusive licensing deals with producers on a case-by-case basis because they need to protect their intellectual property and ensure safety.

&amp;#x200B;

Critics say this piecemeal approach is too slow at a time of urgent need to stop the virus before it mutates into even deadlier forms. WHO called for vaccine manufacturers to share their know-how to “dramatically increase the global supply.”

All over the world, the supply of coronavirus vaccines is falling far short of demand, and the [limited amount available ](https://apnews.com/article/poorer-countries-coronavirus-vaccine-0980fa905b6e1ce2f14a149cd2c438cd)is going to rich countries. Nearly 80% of the vaccines so far have been administered in just 10 countries, according to WHO. More than 210 countries and territories with 2.5 billion people hadn’t received a single shot as of last week.

The deal-by-deal approach also means that [some poorer countries end up paying more ](https://apnews.com/article/business-honduras-coronavirus-vaccine-coronavirus-pandemic-central-america-16d7d06f031c89aaf37a4306747b9128)for the same vaccine than richer countries. South Africa, Mexico, Brazil and Uganda all pay different amounts per dose for the AstraZeneca vaccine — and more than governments in the European Union, according to studies and publicly available documents. AstraZeneca said the price of the vaccine will differ depending on local production costs and how much countries order.

“What we see today is a stampede, a survival of the fittest approach, where those with the deepest pockets, with the sharpest elbows are grabbing what is there and leaving others to die,”

In South Africa, home to the world’s [most worrisome COVID-19 variant](https://apnews.com/article/us-news-anthony-fauci-infectious-diseases-coronavirus-pandemic-6839fde8261b404ef995c682017b5a84), the Biovac factory has said for weeks that it’s in negotiations with an unnamed manufacturer with no contract to show for it. And in Denmark, the Bavarian Nordic factory has capacity to spare and the ability to make more than 200 million doses but is also waiting for word from the producer of a licensed coronavirus vaccine.

Governments and health experts offer two potential solutions to the vaccine shortage: One, supported by WHO, is a patent pool modeled after a platform set up for HIV, tuberculosis and hepatitis treatments for voluntary sharing of technology, intellectual property and data. But no company has offered to share its data.

The other, [a proposal to suspend intellectual property rights](https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-technology-global-trade-international-agreements-india-c65a718f35f40cb50402f67018efb8e5) during the pandemic, has been blocked in the World Trade Organization by the United States and Europe, home to the companies responsible for creating coronavirus vaccines. That drive has the support of at least 119 countries and the African Union but is adamantly opposed by vaccine makers.

Advocates of sharing vaccine blueprints argue that, unlike with most drugs, taxpayers paid billions to develop vaccines that could help end the world’s biggest public health emergency in living memory.

“People are literally dying because we cannot agree on intellectual property rights,” said Mustaqeem De Gama, a South African diplomat involved in the WTO discussions.

Paul Fehlner, the chief legal officer for biotech company Axcella and a supporter of the WHO patent pool board, said governments that poured billions of dollars into developing vaccines and treatments should have demanded more from the companies they were financing from the beginning.

“A condition of taking taxpayer money is not treating them as dupes,” he said.

\&gt;It is one of three factories that The Associated Press found on three continents whose owners say they could start producing hundreds of millions of COVID-19 vaccines on short notice if only they had the blueprints and technical know-how. But that knowledge belongs to the large pharmaceutical companies who have produced the first three vaccines authorized by countries including Britain, the European Union and the U.S. — Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca. The factories are all still awaiting responses.

Across Africa and Southeast Asia, governments and aid groups, as well as the World Health Organization, are calling on pharmaceutical companies to share their patent information more broadly to meet a [yawning global shortfall](https://apnews.com/article/europe-immunizations-coronavirus-pandemic-united-nations-611ca364df6235099be95548c3c22c4d) in a pandemic that already has claimed over [2.5 million lives](https://apnews.com/article/gobal-death-toll-coronavirus-2-million-19c7f4611df0a8635ebb83f833c7b89f). Pharmaceutical companies that took taxpayer money from the U.S. or Europe to develop inoculations at unprecedented speed say they are negotiating contracts and exclusive licensing deals with producers on a case-by-case basis because they need to protect their intellectual property and ensure safety. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Critics say this piecemeal approach is too slow at a time of urgent need to stop the virus before it mutates into even deadlier forms. WHO called for vaccine manufacturers to share their know-how to “dramatically increase the global supply.” 

 All over the world, the supply of coronavirus vaccines is falling far short of demand, and the [limited amount available ](https://apnews.com/article/poorer-countries-coronavirus-vaccine-0980fa905b6e1ce2f14a149cd2c438cd)is going to rich countries. Nearly 80% of the vaccines so far have been administered in just 10 countries, according to WHO. More than 210 countries and territories with 2.5 billion people hadn’t received a single shot as of last week. 

 

The deal-by-deal approach also means that [some poorer countries end up paying more ](https://apnews.com/article/business-honduras-coronavirus-vaccine-coronavirus-pandemic-central-america-16d7d06f031c89aaf37a4306747b9128)for the same vaccine than richer countries. South Africa, Mexico, Brazil and Uganda all pay different amounts per dose for the AstraZeneca vaccine — and more than governments in the European Union, according to studies and publicly available documents. AstraZeneca said the price of the vaccine will differ depending on local production costs and how much countries order.

“What we see today is a stampede, a survival of the fittest approach, where those with the deepest pockets, with the sharpest elbows are grabbing what is there and leaving others to die,”

 In South Africa, home to the world’s [most worrisome COVID-19 variant](https://apnews.com/article/us-news-anthony-fauci-infectious-diseases-coronavirus-pandemic-6839fde8261b404ef995c682017b5a84), the Biovac factory has said for weeks that it’s in negotiations with an unnamed manufacturer with no contract to show for it. And in Denmark, the Bavarian Nordic factory has capacity to spare and the ability to make more than 200 million doses but is also waiting for word from the producer of a licensed coronavirus vaccine. 

 

Governments and health experts offer two potential solutions to the vaccine shortage: One, supported by WHO, is a patent pool modeled after a platform set up for HIV, tuberculosis and hepatitis treatments for voluntary sharing of technology, intellectual property and data. But no company has offered to share its data.

The other, [a proposal to suspend intellectual property rights](https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-technology-global-trade-international-agreements-india-c65a718f35f40cb50402f67018efb8e5) during the pandemic, has been blocked in the World Trade Organization by the United States and Europe, home to the companies responsible for creating coronavirus vaccines. That drive has the support of at least 119 countries and the African Union but is adamantly opposed by vaccine makers.

 

Advocates of sharing vaccine blueprints argue that, unlike with most drugs, taxpayers paid billions to develop vaccines that could help end the world’s biggest public health emergency in living memory.

“People are literally dying because we cannot agree on intellectual property rights,” said Mustaqeem De Gama, a South African diplomat involved in the WTO discussions.

Paul Fehlner, the chief legal officer for biotech company Axcella and a supporter of the WHO patent pool board, said governments that poured billions of dollars into developing vaccines and treatments should have demanded more from the companies they were financing from the beginning.

“A condition of taking taxpayer money is not treating them as dupes,” he said.

But Wisconsin and Minnesota are [both doing well](https://old.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/myg3kf/us_administers_2287_million_doses_of_covid19/gvven1m/) in terms of first doses delivered and continued demand. Michigan is a bit worse but nowhere near as bad as the Deep South. 

Assuming Wisconsin and Minnesota can maintain pace for another few weeks, they will likely hit at least the ""Israel-level"" of herd immunity sometime in May. Michigan may struggle to get there until sometime in the summer (e.g. mid to late June). 

Regardless, every additional shot in an arm reduces the Rt. So it's not entirely binary. It's a mix of immune population combined with preventative measures (voluntary or mandated) that determines the Rt and ultimately the rate of spread. For example, we talk about Israel's ""herd immunity"" but people miss the fact that Israel still technically has a mask mandate for indoors and select other restrictions. 

Israel's Rt - with their current rate of vaccinations combined with voluntary and mandated prevention measures - is below 1 and, therefore, the virus is dying out. But it's entirely possible that without any measures at all, Rt could creep up above 1.
