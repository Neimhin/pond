[],,masasin,,,[],,,,text,t2_8y0z9,False,False,,"China (actually, Taiwan and South Korea being worried about China) was also the big warning for me. I bought my first ever car in the second or third week of January (to avoid public transport because people don't math right), ordered my reusable mask (and a bunch of disposable ones) etc in early Feb and had bought a few months' worth of long-term supplies by the middle of February.

By the end of the second week of January, I thought there was a high enough risk of person-to-person transmission (you were getting sick people who hadn't been to the market, close contacts, and more; not to mention the sheer speed of the increase in cases). When the Diamond Princess happened, I thought there was a high probability of airborne transmission as well, which is why I made the reusable mask very thick, and got goggles.

I wrote a report on 4 Feb on whether my long-distance SO should fly over to live with me before the end of Feb, or whether to wait until May. I explained that if she waited, there was a 5% chance of seeing each other before September, and about a 30% chance of seeing each other that year. She came, but lockdown happened so we couldn't do her papers, and flights back were drying up, and she didn't want to be here illegally in case it affected the legal stuff later on, so she left less than a month after coming. It's been 540+ days, but she's coming in 7 weeks, so we're almost done!

Obviously, I'm very happy about the vaccines. in 2019, I thought that mRNA vaccines were still about a decade out, so getting them ahead of schedule was amazing.

For the most part that was true, but Catholicism still has a lot of the country in a vicelike grip. I encountered general bad vibes at work and occasional outright hostility for being gay. I had some good coworkers, but a lot of people were weird about it.          
Ireland just had its first gay prime minister, which is obviously a pretty big deal, but the way some of my coworkers would talk about him‚Ä¶the resentfulness, the offensive jokes, the off-colour remarks, and these weren‚Äôt isolated incidents.          

I was hatecrimed (to the point of filing a police report) on the streets twice, both times while coming out of a gay pub.              

They only recently held a referendum on their insanely misogynistic divorce law.             

Dublin is a lot more diverse than the rest of Ireland, it gets more conservative/less accepting the further into the countryside you go. My experience living there was that it‚Äôs noticeably more religious/conservative than the UK, and Dublin isn‚Äôt anywhere close to the cosmopolitan progressiveness that London has which is where I live now.            
I feel so much more comfortable here. 

If you‚Äôre not someone affected by these issues then the only problems you‚Äôd have to worry about are extortionately high rent prices and landlords who don‚Äôt want to rent to foreigners/immigrants. It was a nightmare trying to even view a place, many landlords would hang up the phone as soon as they heard my accent.             

I think a lot of people on Reddit view Ireland as a sort of socialist utopia, but it‚Äôs not that.

[],,ProfessionalParty,,,[],,,,text,t2_qh560nv,False,False,,"This is being done through OSHA rather than an act of state/local legislature. This means that the authority for enacting and enforcing the mandate falls under the doctrine of Chevron Deference rather than through an act of legislative authority. Chevron Deference arises from a Supreme Court case in 1984 and allows for the executive branch to have broad interpretation of laws when directed upon by the legislative branch - think about a law that states ""X is to be implemented by the methods imposed by the Y secretary"" or a law that has an interpretable definition.

Multiple supreme court justices have already written dissenting opinions on the doctrine Chevron Deference and want to get rid of it (prior to having a clear conservative majority). These supreme court justices have written opinions in the past stating that Chevron Deference takes away the constitutional authority of the judicial branch to interpret laws and gives it to the executive branch which is unconstitutional despite being part of the law from the legislative branch. The argument being that it is unconstitutional for the legislative branch to give legislative interpretation authority to the executive branch because the judicial branch has the explicit authority to interpret laws under article 3 of the constitution.

As such, an act of legislative interpretation from the executive branch in modern times effectively relies upon a single Supreme Court decision that has criticism, and even dissenting opinions, from 3 of the current 9 justices (not including the new 3). This is not legally comparable to a vaccine mandate created from an act of local/state legislature (as is the case in Jacobson v. Massachusetts).

If this goes to the Supreme Court it could not only shut down this mandate but rewrite how modern administrative code is written by revoking the prior precedent of Chevron Deference - this mandate is not very comparable to precedent surrounding vaccines as the historical precedent relates to legislative authority. Legislative authority is not comparable to executive authority granted under Chevron Deference.

In my personal opinion, I would not be surprised if this mandate has negative consequences for every Federal agency from OSHA to the EPA through the re-writing of Chevron Deference once it gets to the Supreme Court.",,,,1631430631,{},hcjbhao,False,t3_pl59ch,False,True,t1_hc9nu12,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pl59ch/sweeping_new_vaccine_mandates_for_100_million/hcjbhao/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,c68e77b7b184d6cfc7174dac9a8186538cce4216,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1631430645.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

The FDA had originally wanted a four to six months followup for the pediatric trials out of an abundance of caution, on top of asking for a larger trial cohort.

The FDA also said that they are going to try to conduct the data review in a matter of weeks instead of months.  So lets say they expect to be able to throw enough resources to conduct a rigorous review in under/up to 8 weeks-ish?

With the ‚Äúnew‚Äù at least two month followup and an authorization request, Pfizer expects to have the data to submit later this month for 5 to 12 and will submit for EUA shortly after.  Pfizer has said that they expect the 2 to 5 to be submitted shortly after the 5 to 12, and has previously said that the infant data to be submitted after that.  They believe they will have the data for six months to two years in early Oct / Nov.  Pfizer has also said that they are adjusting the final production steps for the pediatric dosing, so once the approval is given they can start production shortly after.

If the data review is done in weeks instead of months and EUA request is sometime later this month, based on Pfizer and FDA published statements, we could be VERY SPECULATIVELY be looking for a late November / December EUA for 5 to 12 fo Pfizer, Dec-ish for 2 to 5 and Dec / Jan for infants.  Then add few weeks to produce and distribute the first runs.

Moderna on Thursday said that they just finished enrolling the numbers needed for their 6 to 15 cohort, and are still performing dosing selection studies for younger ages, so we are months out from then being able to submit an EUA request.

But this said, the FDA always has to compare the chance of adverse events with the risk of the disease being prevented. The chance of adverse events is, of course, very low.

But the ""problem"" is that that the risk to kids under 12 from COVID is also very low. There have been ~5 million known child cases, and less than 400 deaths. The case fatality rate for children is about 0.008%, or less than one in 12,500 cases. The rate for the age group in questions -- kids 5-11 -- is the lowest of the child cohorts (0-4, 5-11, 12-17) as well, being only about 1/3 the rate of the other two and thus closer to 0.003%. Hospitalization rates are similarly low (under 2% of all child cases, and about 1/3 of that for 5-11s.)

What this means from a public health perspective is that prior to Delta coming along, it really might not make sense to vaccinate kids, as much as we parents want to. If COVID kills only 0.003%, and say 20% of kids get COVID, then a vaccine with a 1-in-200,000 chance of life-threating side effects might be worse than the disease. Because the base rate is so low, it makes some sense for the FDA to require thorough safety and effectiveness data.

All that said, though, there's two significant things that make vaccination still make sense. The first is Delta -- at this point, it's pretty safe to say *100% of all unvaccinated people will get COVID*, though it might take them a year or two. So the hospitalization &amp; death rates can be applied to the whole population. 

The second is that there's not a 1-in-200,000 chance of life-threatening side effects from these vaccines. While VAERS shows 0.0019% of people have died after a COVID vaccine (i.e. 2/3 as high as the child death rate from COVID), VAERS results simply mean ""a person got the vaccine, and then that person died afterward"" -- given that the vaccine was initially given primarily to the elderly (who die of all kinds of things) means that these were expected. The number of deaths directly attributed to the vaccines is *zero*; during the Moderna and Pfizer clinical trials, some severe (hospitalization) side effects were observed, but *at the same rate in the vaccine and placebo groups*. The vaccine risk appears to be so close to nil that even comparing with the low COVID risk to children in the relevant age group, it's going to come out way ahead once the numbers are crunched.",,,,1631428003,{},hcj7xat,False,t3_pmi9vq,False,True,t1_hcic61l,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pmi9vq/parents_of_young_children_desperately_seek/hcj7xat/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,58856cdb926a28c73a4efa72ca3f87ec5d7d4c22,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1631428013.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

To provide a proof of vaccination for each of these individuals, Co-WIN is already issuing a digitally verifiable certificate. This certificate can be saved on a digital device (smartphone, tablet, laptop etc.) or stored in Digi Locker from where it can be digitally shared as and when required as a proof of vaccination. Similarly, at entry points where such certificate is required (e.g., in malls, office complex, public events etc.), it may be shown in both the digital and physical forms.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, there may be instances where an entity does not need to see the certificate in full and would just need to know whether an individual has been vaccinated or not. A few of such possible use cases could be as follows:  
&gt;  
&gt;An enterprise/employer may like to know the vaccination status of its employees to resume functions in offices, workplaces etc.  
&gt;  
&gt;ii) The Railways may want to get the status of vaccination of the passengers who are getting their seats reserved in the trains.  
&gt;  
&gt;iii) Airlines may want to get the status of vaccination of the passengers who are booking their flight tickets, and/or airports may only want to allow vaccinated passengers to pass through.  
&gt;  
&gt;iv) Hotels may want to know the vaccination status of the residents at the time they are checking into the hotel, or at the time of making online bookings.  
&gt;  
&gt;As the socio-economic activities are being gradually revived while maintaining everyone‚Äôs safety, there is a need for a way to digitally convey the status of individuals‚Äô vaccination to entities with whom they may be engaging with for any or all reasons, as employees, passengers, residents etc.  
&gt;  
&gt;Therefore, there is a need to enable an Aadhaar like authentication service for the status of vaccination through Co-WIN. To take care of these cases and others that may come up, Co-WIN has developed a new API called ‚ÄòKnow Your Customer‚Äôs/Client‚Äôs Vaccination Status‚Äô or KYC-VS. To use this API, an individual needs to enter his/her mobile number and name. Thereafter, they will get an OTP which they have to enter. In return, Co-WIN will send a response to the verifying entity on the individual‚Äôs status of vaccination, which will be as follows ‚Äì  
&gt;  
&gt;0 - Person is not vaccinated  
&gt;  
&gt;1 - Person is partially vaccinated  
&gt;  
&gt;2 - Person is fully vaccinated  
&gt;  
&gt;This response will be digitally signed and can be shared instantly with the verifying entity. A real-life example could be when at the time of booking a railway ticket, an individual will input the necessary details for buying the ticket and if required, the concerned entity will also get the vaccination status in the same transaction, with the due consent of the individual.  
&gt;  
&gt;KYC-VS will facilitate all such use cases and more. It is both consent-based and privacy preserving. Additionally, in order to facilitate quick integration and faster adoption, the Co-WIN Team has prepared a webpage with the API, which may be embedded in any system. This will allow for a seamless integration with any system in no time.  
&gt;  
&gt;Besides the use cases pointed out, this service may be utilized by any service provider, private or public, for whom verifying an individual‚Äôs vaccination status is critical for facilitating a service requested.

Yes I did, I literally said I tried to find the Mississippi's student testing data and couldn't find it. That is why I asked you and you said you don't want to do the ""legwork."" And as I mentioned, I didn't know looking on Google was hard for you.

&gt;Where do you find those stats on that page? I see nothing showing numbers that low, not even the fatality rate.

*Sigh.*

Click the hyper link &gt; scroll down a bit &gt; Click ""Trend view""   
This shows the average daily cases out of 100,000. Divide the number on the trendline with 100,000 to get the rate.

&gt;You incorrectly divided the number of sick students by the whole student population. That tells you the percentage of the student population that got sick in August. 

I already noted this in my original comment, and in my replies to you, and in other replies. I am using the best available data (as the [CDC](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-seeks-discredit-fauci-amid-coronavirus-surge-n1233612) does). Again, if you can provide the Mississippi student testing data, I am happy to update my calculation. And *again*, I have already tried to find it, so if you can - and I know this may be difficult so you don't have to - try to find it by doing some Google searches that'd be great.

&gt;So dividing the number of sick students by the largest number possible gives the bare minimum positivity rate possible, 10.2%.

While nowhere does it specifically state that unvaccinated nurses have been linked to an infant getting invented with and subsequently dying of Covid, there was this interesting price of information:

&gt;Our results support the findings of similar research. A smaller study of 231 parents with infants hospitalized in NICUs in the UK and the USA showed that a large percentage (41%) reported to be unable to bond and only 37% were able to be present with their infant as often as desired [[10]]. Comparisons of the pre- and pandemic status in one NICU clearly link limited parental presence abilities to the COVID-19 pandemic [[5]]; and a large global survey of 1120 neonatal care providers, from 62 countries, concluded that restrictions during the pandemic have led to a general separation between the mother-infant dyads [[4]], which was also suggested for the entire family [[6]]. Our results confirm this limited ability to be present with the hospitalized newborn now on a global level and show the magnitude of the impact of implemented restrictions.

Which leads to believe that if the parents aren't taking care of the newborns, *the nurses are*. Thus, an unvaccinated nurse *can* be dangerous.",,,,1631412393,{},hcifrjg,False,t3_pmetow,False,True,t1_hcib8gp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pmetow/ny_hospital_to_pause_baby_deliveries_after/hcifrjg/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,False,c50d87c430be971caffee0d38acff3ab7b1908fd,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1631412407.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

Everyone is hating unvaccinated people and saying horrible things about them. And wishing them dead, shame on u for even saying this, have some empathy, compassion.

The rate of spread for covid is coming from both vaccinated and unvaccinated people. So why are people pushing this hatred for unvaccinated and saying it is their fault?

Yes they get sicker when unvaccinated, but both are spreading it to everyone.

This is totally missing the point -- look at my original comment to you; I said I wanted to see the evidence for your claim, and was already apologizing in my first post to you if it existed and I just wasn't aware. Had you cited anything that any of those posters had said, I would have thanked you for educating me and that would be the end of it. I was literally, and politely, I might add, asking you to explain how you knew what you were claiming, as it was news to me. 

At that point, all you had to say was, oh, I wasn't talking about the mRNA spike interacting with pericytes or not, instead I was talking about how the vaccine is safe and getting covid isn't or whatever. It wasn't at all the huge deal you made it out to be, where you argued with me back and forth for a ton of posts. Then, it got weird, where you literally edited just about all your responses to me (and they were not nice, btw), so that when I responded it looked like I was talking into the void or crazy. Then, you deleted all your comments, I presume because they looked insane. Personally, I've never seen anyone go through all this trouble over the most minor thing, especially when right at the beginning I was just asking for a citation, politely I might add.

And the fact that you stood by your claim, without having any evidence of your own, is how the problem continued. You thought you caught me by asking me to cite my own claim, which I did.

&gt; You‚Äôre literally the only person here who suggested it can‚Äôt.

Can't what? You don't even have your facts straight. Those other posters are the ones all citing it *can't* bind, I was saying it *probably could* bind. And it's great to have them discussing it here (recall, I was asking for this very evidence, so I don't know why you're so thrilled that you ""won""), but there is more discussion on /r/COVID19 for this link and going back to winter 2020 that dissents from those opinions, like I pointed out in this thread.

Rhetoric like this when repeated creates a feedback loop in which people genuinely don't trust vaccines with the overwhelming burden of reducing infection, severe disease, transmission and death, while simultaneously overstating the efficacy of masks as a supplementary precaution for vaccinated individuals. At this stage in the pandemic, the last thing we need is to make people doubtful of how powerful vaccines are. At the same time, these talking points become pressure for officials to act and create mandates, on top of that providing fodder for anti-vaxxers to say ""oh well why should I get it my life won't change"", which is something that they most certainly do.

For the second and third paragraphs, this is incredibly location- and situation-dependent. I live in NYC and our case growth is ~17.9/100,000 per day and declining by 16% over the week, so a 1% reduction is pretty marginal, particularly when considering that hospitalizations are firmly below 100 per day in a city of 8.8m people, with deaths under 20 per day. High-risk environments either have venue-specific mask mandates (schools, clinical settings) or vaccine passports (bars, restaurants, events), but that's about it.

Firstly this has absolutely nothing with being anti-vax.

Lumping in the overly cautious with people who are actively complicit in spreading COVID is both incorrect and insulting. Also, I'm confused as to what you're ""genuinely worried"" about. Even if people are wearing masks unnecessarily, what does it matter to you?

Secondly, while the points you make about the efficacy of the vaccine in reducing spread are valid, you are ignoring countervailing factors which *increase* people's chances of spreading COVID: 1. we are in the middle of a huge spike in cases, so your chance of any given person you interact with being infectious is hugely increased. 2. there are very few limits left on social contact, so the chance of contact with both infected people *and* vulnerable people you might infect is also increased.

Even if the vaccinated wearing masks only reduces infections by 1%, that's worth doing when hospitals are near breaking point and thousands of people are dying.

With that said, a vaccine's job is to train the immune system to recognise and neutralise certain proteins, which are present on certain microbial agents such as viruses and bacteria. By pre-training the immune system in this way, some antibodies will be present when the real agent comes along, or, if they're not, the body should remember how to produce them and therefore react quicker to eradicate the microbial invaders.

In the case of the mRNA vaccines, the proteins we've chosen to train the immune system on, are expressed on the spike protein. It's possible (but remember I don't know for certain) that we're training using only a subset of the proteins that the real spike contains. Alternatively, perhaps the spike protein the mRNA vaccines cause our cells to create aren't exactly compatible with the original. They look the same, but they're counterfeit and don't create the same functionality when they meet the cardiac pericytes.

So again, i can't say for certain if any of this is the case without digging much deeper (and probably to the point where I'd be in above my head anyway) but it is certainly believable that the mRNA proteins produced are sufficiently similar to provoke an immune training session, but sufficiently different to not have the unwanted inflammatory side effect.

The data I've seen seems inconclusive about how effective the virus is at preventing transmission (as opposed to symptoms).   
  
To be clear, It probably does slow transmission somewhat at the surface level. This may be offset by the fact that tranmission is still possible in vaccinated people and will only be more and more likely with the new strains. Vaccinated people who contract the virus are less likely to know they have it, therefore probably more likely to unknowingly pass it on to others. Someone with symptoms is less likely to come into work and spread the virus.   
  
I don't think vaccine mandates will work. Variants are already coming out to circumvent the vaccine and I can picture things getting to this uncomfortable place where we are required to boost every 6-24 months for the rest of our lives.. Things would devolve quickly under these conditions.

Let's also assume that there's perfect overlap between those vaccinated and those infected - in other words, 50% of the unvaccinated have been infected, 50% have not (this again is probably not entirely accurate, but just trying to keep this estimate simple).

That would mean that, in addition to the 54% of the population that's immune through full vaccination, half of the remaining 46% (or 23%) has been infected.  Meaning approximately 77% of the US has immunity.  This is actually in line with some seroprevalence studies that have been released (I think I remember one that said 80% had antibodies).

However, this doesn't take into account the fact that immunity from either infection or immunity wanes over time, or that Delta can cause reinfection in those previously infected with wild type COVID.  I also don't think that 50% of the US has been infected; in reality, it's probably more like 30-40%.  Personally, I would guess that about 60-65% of the US has ""strong"" immunity, and about 70-75% has some level of immunity, but I am not a scientist.

I think we will see another ""wave' starting in early December through early February, but it will be smaller than the current wave we're seeing.  After that, as more people get vaccinated to keep their jobs, kids are approved to get doses, and a significant chunk of the population gets natural immunity, COVID will burn out.

With greater total overall infection, the ""undercount"" is reduced because there are fewer people left to get an unnoticed infection.  So 4X back then could be 2X now, but that data doesn't exist, so you can't base a calculation off it.  You obviously can't properly track that which you don't know.

Second, you can't just add infected people to vaccinated people and subtract from the total population.  Millions of people have been infected and later vaccinated so you would be counting them twice.  You would have to allow for the overlap, and once again we don't know what that is.

The way to get the number you want is called seroprevalence surveillance.  You randomly test great numbers of people to see who has no antibodies -- neither previously infected nor vaccinated.  Those are the people still at risk.  Unfortunately only regional surveys are being conducted and they vary greatly.  Can't predict an accurate national total.

All that said, you're right.  At risk numbers have to be going down.  We just can't track it.  FWIW I heard the number 80 million mentioned a couple times recently as the number left in the US without antibodies.  But for the reasons I mentioned, that can only be an estimated guess.

The vaccines have overwhelming uptake in older americans and pretty good uptake in the severely immune compromised of all ages (cancer patients, transplant  patients, autoimmune disorders, etc). These are people who are more at risk in general and for whom the vaccines may not be as effective. So you're right, we need to consider that those variables might skew the data a bit. 


The vaccines are amazingly effective even against Delta, especially considering that Delta is both more transmissible *and* more severe than previous variants. Data like this that is not demographic adjusted ends up underselling the effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines (and j&amp;j too).



I do think it will end up being a 3 shot series (for mRNA) and that will generate enough antibodies to prevent infection from Delta in most people. A lot of our immunizations are 3 shot series over a period of months. People who were previously infected, especially by Delta may only end up needing 2 or possibly 1 shot to generate the same antibody titers.

[],,hu6Bi5To,,,[],,,,text,t2_nudum,False,False,[],"Throughout the whole pandemic there's been a lot of very confident voices from across the political spectrum (many of whom were citing their scientific credentials, but were 80-90% of the time being political rather than scientific) claiming one and only one thing was the answer.

This has ranged from everything from (in the early days):

* It's just like the flu, no need to do anything.

* We just need to shut everything down for two weeks.

To (over the past six months):

* The new normal means facemasks forever.

* Vaccines will be the end of Covid.

The difference between Denmark and Israel seems to be that last point. Israel seems to be adopting a policy of vaccinating and re-vaccinating until the virus goes away, which isn't going to happen, and to continually reintroduce other measures at the first sign of trouble as though trouble was proof of vaccine failure. Denmark, on the other hand, realises that the end of the story isn't ""defeating Covid"" it's reducing the risk of serious harms, which is something the vaccines do very well, and does well enough to remove other mitigations.

The two lessons the world needs to learn for the next crisis (and at least one of them is on the horizon already - climate change) are these:

1. The world is inherently complex and every problem that affects it is inherently complex as a result. (Although not so complex to be a complete mystery, some commentators have ascribed almost mystical traits to Covid ""why isn't it doing what we thought it would... maybe it's smart enough to be immunity proof!... wooohhoohh!"", it's still ""just"" a virus that's behaving exactly like viruses do.)

2.

&gt;It‚Äôs difficult to predict how many COVID-19 cases might develop from a single event. That depends partly on infection rates where the venue is located and how many people are vaccinated.

&gt;The highly contagious delta variant has triggered a surge in infections this summer that just recently started to taper. The seven-day rolling average for daily new cases in the U.S. sits at about 150,000 after starting September above 167,000, according to Johns Hopkins University.

 &gt;At those rates, it is ‚Äúbasically a certainty‚Äù that there will be at least one infected person at any gathering of a thousand people, epidemiologist Ryan Demmer said.

&gt;Many football stadiums seat 60,000 fans or more.

&gt;‚ÄùAt any sort of large event like at a football stadium, without question there will be many infected people there,‚Äù said Demmer of the University of Minnesota School of Public Health.

Yes, more antibodies needed with Delta to prevent infection. I'm not sure about fighting infection, if the viral load in the body is higher overall -- it certainly is in the places that shed virus, and given that it's more severe than classic, I would imagine this would be the case. However, the T/B cell immunity generated by the vaccine and previous infection *is* relevant and helpful once infected -- the vaccines are still pretty good against severe outcomes from Delta overall, though there is some debate there I believe around waning immunity in some people, thus boosters.

&gt; May I ask if you have a source for your statement that the delta variant is requiring higher antibody levels than the ""classic"" variant?

This article summarizes it well, and cites a research paper: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/08/210817131425.htm?fbclid=IwAR17QxJYzQ9Xh-nHw89-7igm5dH3vjKdLItOp7zkuTYeaDCZ_VsWnjryLyM

&gt; Why is there currently a big push to vaccinate the young

Young will not have antibodies unless they have already been infected, which a lot of them are. While it is true that they are less likely to need care, like adults a non-negligible proportion of them are ending up with long covid, so many people are arguing they should be vaccinated to help avoid this. Because covid is a new disease, we don't know the long-terms effects, and that's one reason why people are trying to get them vaccinated. While the argument can also be made that we don't know the long-term effects of the vaccine, we understand vaccines, including mRNA vaccines, much better than we do covid, so that's the risk calculus there. A larger, perhaps more contentious, argument to vaccinate the young (I'm talking now 30 and under) is that they are now the primary sources of infection, and therefore spread. They are spreading it to everyone else in society, and due to the long covid I mentioned (1-5% of people who catch covid suffer debilitating long covid according to a UK study), it is important to keep case counts low. While the vaccine has been shown to help reduce the chances of long covid, there are many unknowns still out there, so many people feel vaccinated adults are also not ""[virtually] fully protected"" from severe outcomes if they get breakthrough cases. **TLDR the risk to young people is low, but they don't live in a bubble and are infecting older people around them and driving the rates of infection really high right now.**",,,,1631408337,{},hci73xg,False,t3_pmgq4m,False,True,t1_hci3hi4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pmgq4m/estimated_covid19_burden_in_the_usa_see_comment/hci73xg/,1631515321.0,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our case numbers aren't great but we'd be screwed without vaccinations. It doesn't need to be made complicated and anyone who makes it so is trying to cause confusion and hesitancy.

Basically because supplies were low we needed everyone to mask to have both source control and personal protection to improve the overall effectiveness, compared to nothing.  People including experts keep saying that cloth is enough if everyone wears them or at least for source control.  When they are actually not great (just better than nothing) for both and people are absolutely getting infected because of poor fitting and/or filtering masks.

This isn't perfect, but it illustrates the concept relatively well.  The contact time is way down with the Delta varient and to be fair this is based on the hardest to filter particle sizes.  Cloth should've been a temporary measure.

Then they did it. Basically built a quarter of NYC's total hospital capacity within a week.

That was what caught my attention. Five thousand hospital beds is a lot; all the 62 hospitals in NYC equal about 26,000 beds. After that Chinese press release, I started to prep my clients for a WFH future (I'm an IT consultant), and got them all migrated and ready with a week to spare before Virginia issued its lockdown order. I cut my on-site hours, essentially telling people that it had to be an emergency for me to be on-site, since I would only visit one client a day, and showered both before and after a visit. Any office that had a reported office worker that caught COVID, or had a member of their household that was infected, and I wouldn't physically visit their office for two weeks. Fortunately, 98% of my job could be done remotely. My concern was that while I personally thought I could handle COVID (not that I wanted to test that theory), I couldn't stand the thought of potentially dragging a disease between my clients and their offices. Those fears were why I took those particular measures.

Even today, I don't visit my clients' offices (except for one, but even with them I work from home more than I did before) unless necessary.

There‚Äôs just so much wrong with this line of thinking. [Vaccination reduces the chance of infection upon exposure by 80% with respect to Delta](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/24/health/delta-covid-vaccine-infection.html), so the baseline of concern for viral transmission in vaccinated individuals only 1/5 that of unvaccinated people. On top of that, the 90-95% reduction in severe illness means that mild or asymptomstic breakthrough cases come with lower viral loads. Even more? Just because viral loads can be similar irrespective of vaccination status, [viral loads decrease faster in vaccinated individuals](https://mobile.twitter.com/sailorrooscout/status/1429443873974235147), which adds an additional point of reduction in terms of potential transmission. Once you start multiplying all of that out, the equation is radically different than the overly broad refrain of ‚Äúvaccinated people still spread so wear a mask‚Äù. 

At some point or another, people really need to start acknowledging 1) just how powerful vaccines are even in the face of variants and 2) that much of their masking in high-vaccination-rate environments is mostly feel-good rather than really decreasing spread as much as they think it is.

[],,bolshe-viks-vaporub,,,[],,,,text,t2_141v0mm0,False,False,[],"Ok, so here's the actual deal with religious ""exemptions"", which is a bit of a misnomer because they're not actually exemptions as much as they are a path to an accommodation...

Religious exemptions must meet 2 criteria:

1) The belief in the religion must be sincere and deeply held, and 

2) The religion must specifically call out abstaining vaccines as one of its core beliefs.

The religious exemption process actually works like this:

First, in order to claim a religious exemption, you must disclose of which religion you are a member.  There are a very, very small number of religions that actually hold abstaining from vaccines as a core tenet, and they make up far less than 1% of the population.  As an example, if you claim religious exemption and then say you're Catholic, it's going to be denied because the Pope has said all Catholics should be vaccinated; claiming you disagree with this would be essentially saying that you do not believe the Pope is the messenger and representative of God on Earth, which is a core belief of Catholicism, and is grounds for dismissal of your claim.

Second, you must demonstrate that your beliefs are sincere and deeply held.  This can include your employer finding out whether you're actually a member of the religion and for how long you've been a member of the religion.  If you joined a religion that doesn't vaccinate within just a few months, that is grounds for dismissal of your claim.  Your employer can also request your prior vaccine records.  If you've ever been vaccinated previously, that can be grounds for dismissal of your claim.

Third, you must demonstrate that the core functions of your job can be performed with reasonable accommodation without being vaccinated.   For example, if you are a salesperson at a car dealership, you are not able to do that job without regularly interacting with other people in-person.  Therefore, even if you meet the first two criteria, your employer may STILL deny your religious exemption request on the basis that you cannot perform the core functions of your job with reasonable accommodation.

In other words, this hurdle isn't just a matter of saying ""nah cuz religion"".  There are serious qualifiers for it to actually pass muster, and even if you do, it's not business as usual.",,,,1631468474,{},hcl59jf,False,t3_pmu4ec,False,False,t3_pmu4ec,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pmu4ec/a_religious_group_gives_tips_on_avoiding_the/hcl59jf/,1631573797.0,29,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two of my friends, are unvaccinated and constantly downplaying the severity of COVID-19, they have now officially been exposed. My friends' partner has been informed that his parents (along with many aunt's and uncles) are both positive with one showing mild symptoms and the other experiencing a nasty case of the virus (after a large family gathering). They and their preschool aged children have spent a good deal of time with his parents prior to them being tested, but after the large gathering.

My concern is that my 5 year old attends school with one of their children, and they play together everyday. I am realizing that they plan on continuing to send their child to school without being tested even though she was exposed and is currently dealing with a mild cough. My friend believes that everyone will get it eventually and that there is no need to make a big deal out of it. However, our school requires you to fill out a Covid exposure/symptom questionaire each day at drop off. 

Should I simply suggest to my daughter to keep extra distance from their child, should I be informing the school of this exposure? I have informed my friends of various local places that are administering rapid tests for free but feel there's not much else I can do other than look out for my child, and try to limit her exposure.ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

It has since been acknowledged, with hindsight, that the JCVI's expertise and bold strategy in this regard was the right choice because it improved immunity and means we might not need boosters as often.

https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n2179

The BMJ article about young people getting vaccinated said the guidance is welcome and we have already opened up vaccinations for at risk young teens and those living in at risk households for a while, as recommended by the JCVI.

What is wrong with the statement about AstraZeneca? The BMJ is stated it is right they are being honest. They review data and analyse it as an ongoing thing, sometimes new data changes things? Same as advice about J&amp;J in the US.

[],,thezerothmisfit,,,[],,,,text,t2_kbxu7,False,False,,"Vaccine bioworker here. The answer is no. The spike protein is normally in a ""closed"" shape that opens up when it comes in contact with the ACE2 receptor on the outside of your cells. The Spike proteins produced by the vaccines have a point mutation that keeps them stabilized in the closed shape. This does two things. 

1. The immune system is not going to come in contact with the open shape because that only happens when it's binding to cells that it's infecting, otherwise we need to train the immune system to respond to the closes shape, which is how the virus will look when it's floating around and coming in contact with immune cells.

2. The closed shape doesn't allow it to bind to cells. So the inflammation response doesn't occur.




The severity of infection in tissues is dependent on which ones express the highest levels of ACE2 (which is responsible for lowering your blood pressure in a normal setting) and a few accessory proteins that the virus also hijacks (e.g. TMPRSS2, ADAM17). These are the tissues in your body that are most responsible for blood pressure regulation, and they are mainly in the nasal mucosa, lungs, instestines, liver, kidneys, and heart. 

In the disease, the lack of blood pressure regulation causes an overall increase in BP, which causes leaky vessels (leading to pneumonia, and leaky vessels cause clotting factors to release (resulting in clots) and release of bradykinins and cytokines (which lead to inflammation). And as predicted the organs with those specific receptors are the ones most likely to fail. 

The damage done to these tissues during disease can be permanent, or reversible depending on severity. The heart relies on good blood pressure regulation and tissue flexibility. The less forgiving the tissues are, the harder the heart has to work, which is obviously pretty bad.


If anyone tells you that this is somehow the same as the rare mild myocarditis cases, which is a reversible and treatable condition linked to the vaccines don't believe them. Those are related to an overactivation of the immune system which can happen with literally any vaccine, allergen, or virus.

&gt;	In England, between February 2020 and March 2021 inclusive, fewer than 30 persons aged less than 18 years died because of COVID-19, corresponding to a mortality rate of 2 deaths per million. During the second wave of the pandemic in the UK, the hospitalisation rate in children and young people was 100 to 400 per million. Most of those hospitalised had severe underlying health conditions.

&gt;For children and young people without underlying health conditions that put them at high risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19, the direct individual health benefits of COVID-19 vaccination are limited. 

This data clearly precedes the Delta variant, which was not prominent in the UK by March 2021.

If we are rigid in our response then we get nowhere.

 We have found the current sweet spot for interval dose for the current circumstances,  but that might change again if a new variant comes in or the virus dies down. Data is reviewed constantly. The decision was based on lack of supply AND expertise about how vaccine dosing intervals worked. It was a brilliant decision, while risky and saved lots of lives. I've probably now got longer lasting immunity because of it.

 You also keep stating that they are preventing vaccinations for young people. The government have said they are introducing them, so that's clearly not the case. The JCVI make recommendations based on individual health risk to each person, which they have spelt out in their statement, saying that the government may wish to look at wider considerations. That certainly isn't blocking vaccinations for teens.

They have also said further data may change their decision. They are evidence based and apolitical in their stance.

""Overall, the committee is of the opinion that the benefits from vaccination are marginally greater than the potential known harms (tables 1 to 4) but acknowledges that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the potential harms. The margin of benefit, based primarily on a health perspective, is considered too small to support advice on a universal programme of vaccination of otherwise healthy 12 to 15-year-old children at this time. As longer-term data on potential adverse reactions accrue, greater certainty may allow for a reconsideration of the benefits and harms. Such data may not be available for several months.
JCVI¬†has considered commentary from stakeholders on the benefits of vaccination on the operation of schools and the educational impact of the pandemic on children and young people.¬†JCVI¬†is constituted with expertise to allow consideration of the health benefits and risks of vaccination and it is not within its remit to incorporate in-depth considerations on wider societal impacts, including educational benefits. The government may wish to seek further views on the wider societal and educational impacts from the chief medical officers of the 4 nations, with representation from¬†JCVI¬†in these subsequent discussions. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the impact of vaccination in children and young people on peer-to-peer transmission and transmission in the wider (highly vaccinated) population. Estimates from modelling vary substantially, and the committee is of the view that any impact on transmission may be relatively small, given the lower effectiveness of the vaccine against infection with the Delta variant.""

* The kid is out for a day or two with no explanation.

* Our grade level gets called to the front office after school to inform us of another exposure. Originally we had to contact-trace and figure out who was within the student for 15+ minutes in a space of six feet or less, but our spread was so great regardless of this that they have just decided to count the whole grade as a close contact.

* That afternoon/evening, parents get a close contact exposure letter written in legalese that some of them cannot understand.

* The following day, anywhere between a quarter and half of the class is out because of the COVID scare. They will continue to be out for several days until they can get a test. If any of them test positive, go back to Step One.

* The student out with COVID will be out for two weeks if not more.

* All students who are out will fall well behind in their classes. We have work they can do online, but it does not compare to the work done in-class. We do not have the time to teach virtually and in-person at the same time. We do not have dedicated virtual teachers because the state defunded virtual ed for the year in an effort to make everything look normal; they have since re-instated *some* funding, but it's only for up to 10% of kids in the district (and most districts only let kids enroll/unenroll from virtual at the start of a grading period--it's not something kids can hop on while they're out). All of this is without mentioning the fact that kids who are legitimately sick *should not* be working and should be focused on getting well.

* When the students return, we are often miles ahead of where they were when they left because of the ridiculous pacing guides the state and district are making us adhere to in order to compensate for ""learning loss"".

* We do not have the time we need to get these students caught up, so they fall further behind. I would love nothing more than to be able to meet with these students in small groups to get them caught up--but I cannot. A new state law demands that we meet with small groups of students who did not pass the STAAR (state end-of-year test) at least one hour a week for every subject they did not pass the test in last year. These groups are legally required to be less than three kids. A ton of kids did not pass the test last year, either because they were already behind or (most infuriatingly) because we were told last year that STAAR would not count AND that students who were virtual last year did not have to take STAAR. We are also legally barred from using recess, lunch, or specials time to have these small group sessions. Unsurprisingly, this large number of students meets the poorly-designed legal framework and creates a massive hullabaloo.

* Therefore, the vast majority of our class time is spent meeting with groups of 3 or less for roughly 15 minutes apiece in an effort to fit as many students in as possible each day so they can all get their minutes by the end of the week and we will be in legal compliance as a school. This is interspersed with extremely brief bursts of highly-accelerated whole group instruction at a pace many of the kids are very uncomfortable with even if they *aren't* missing two or three days of school randomly every other week. Those who *are* absent fall further and further behind.

* While all of this is going on, our school board meetings are growing increasingly erratic and violent as anti-maskers (many of whom do not even live in our districts) flood the meetings en masse screaming about oxygen deprivation, vaccine conspiracies, and freedoms. Several districts have acquiesced to them, only to see a spike in cases afterward--and the further perpetuation of the cycle. And now the state AG is suing several districts with mask mandates in an attempt to overturn them...

The whole thing is a completely unsustainable mess, and I guarantee despite all of the ""effort"" test scores are still going to be ridiculously low at the end of the year. To this end, teachers and schools will largely be blamed, and the state government will turn around and say ""See, we told you public schools don't work, it's time to privatize everything.""",,,,1631470554,{'gid_2': 1},hclases,False,t3_pmv76o,False,False,t3_pmv76o,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pmv76o/more_public_school_students_are_getting_covid_in/hclases/,1631576668.0,169,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,2,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The vaccines produce this fused form. Basically the spike protein can be thought of as 2 subunits, S1 and S2.

S2 is where the binding domain is, and Is protected by S1. When you get infected with the virus, it uses a different membrane protein of yours to remove that S1 part. As soon as that happens the entire structure changes and exposes the S2 to the receptor which latches on. And the rest of the process of fusion occurs (I could explain but I don't want to get away from the point)

The other thing about it all is, that what makes spike protein bad for the most part is that it is usually attached to a virus. The other genetic information In that virus downregulate ACE2 through multiple
processes. The lower the ACE2, the higher the blood pressure.

Most of the vaccines using prefused spike will never open because the ability to be cleaved is dependent on other interactions with the virus it's self. Not just the one protein. Even if they were open, just having spike bind to the receptor doesn't really do too much. 

Spike doesn't fit ACE2 very well, it's outcompeted by things that fit better (namely Angiotensin)

The binding of Spike to ACE2 outside of the context of the virus, may technically cause downregulation (the cell wants to bring it in cus it thinks it's getting the right signal, so it will suck it in to the cell with the receptor still attached) which technically could have some effect on blood pressure, but the amount of Spike needed for the vaccine to work is minimal in comparison to what you would get in a covid infection, so likely wouldn't do much even if it did bind

But since vaccine spike doesn't bind, either way, nothing happens",,,,1631477092,{},hclrm7h,False,t3_pmszpf,False,False,t1_hclpaae,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pmszpf/covid19_spike_protein_binds_to_and_changes_cells/hclrm7h/,1631585420.0,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

So we know that vaccinated people are less likely to catch or transmit covid. But we also know that being vaccinated doesn't guarantee that you can't catch it or transmit it. So given that that's the case, and given that because of mandates, vaccinated people will be forming much larger groups than unvaccinated people (because unvaccinated people can't go to concerts and restaurants and what not), can we actually ascertain who will be spreading the virus the most? Say the vaccine makes you 5 times less likely to catch or transmit covid. If vaccinated people are able to form groups that are 5 times larger due to mandates (just saying 5 times larger as an example), could it potentially negate that benefit of the vaccine? Is there any data on this right now? I think the vaccines are great, but it does strike me as pretty disingenuous when I see people saying ""the pandemic is still a thing because unvaccinated people are selfish"" but then those same people go out to restaurants, bars, sporting events, etc, being around tons of people in the process, knowing they can still be spreading the virus despite being vaccinated.",,,,1631479714,{},hcly6ue,False,t3_pmnxm5,False,True,t3_pmnxm5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pmnxm5/daily_discussion_thread_september_12_2021/hcly6ue/,1631588843.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

A transcript of the 9/11 phone call from United 93

Todd: Hello‚Ä¶ Operator‚Ä¶listen to me‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt speak very loud. ‚Äì This is an emergency. I‚Äôm a passenger on a United flight to San Francisco..  We have a situation here‚Ä¶.Our plane has been hijacked‚Ä¶..can you understand me?

Lisa: (exhaling a deep breath to herself) I understand‚Ä¶ Can the hijackers see you talking on the phone?

Todd: No

Lisa: Can you tell me how many hijackers are on the plane?

Todd: There are three that we know of.

Lisa: Can you see any weapons? What kind of weapons do they have?

Todd: Yes‚Ä¶. they don‚Äôt have guns‚Ä¶.they have knives ‚Äì they took over the plane with knives.

Lisa: Do you mean‚Ä¶like steak knives?

Todd: No, these are razor knives‚Ä¶like box cutters.

Lisa: Can you tell what country these people are from?

Todd: No‚Ä¶..I don‚Äôt know. They sound like they‚Äôre from the mid-east.

Lisa: Have they said what they want?

Todd: Someone announced from the cockpit that there was a bomb on board.  He said he was the captain and to stay in our seats and stay quiet.
He said that they were meeting these men‚Äôs demands and returning to the airport‚Ä¶ It was very broken English, and‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm telling you‚Ä¶it sounded fake!

Lisa: Ok sir, please give me your name.

Todd: My name is Todd Beamer.

Lisa: Ok Todd‚Ä¶.my name is Lisa‚Ä¶Do you know your flight number? If you can‚Äôt remember, it‚Äôs on your ticket.

Todd: It‚Äôs United Flight 93.

Lisa: Now Todd, can you try to tell me exactly what happened?

Todd: Two of the hijackers were sitting in first class near the cockpit.  A third one was sitting near the back of the coach section. The two up. front got into the cockpit somehow; there was shouting. The third hijacker said he had a bomb. It looks like a bomb. He‚Äôs got it tied to his waist with a red belt of some kind.

Lisa: So is the door to the cockpit open?

Todd: No, the hijackers shut it behind them.

Lisa: Has anyone been injured?

Todd: Yes, ..they‚Ä¶they killed one passenger sitting in first class. There‚Äôs been lots of shouting. We don‚Äôt know if the pilots are dead or alive. A flight attendant told me that the pilot and copilot had been forced from the cockpit and may have been wounded.

Lisa: Where is the 3rd hijacker now Todd?

Todd: He‚Äôs near the back of the plane. They forced most of the passengers into first class. There are fourteen of us here in the back. Five are flight attendants. He hasn‚Äôt noticed that I slipped into this pantry to get the phone. The guy with the bomb ordered us to sit on the floor in the rear of the plane‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.oh Jesus.. Help!

Lisa: Todd‚Ä¶.are you ok? Tell me what‚Äôs happening!

Todd: Hello‚Ä¶..We‚Äôre going down‚Ä¶.I think we‚Äôre going to crash‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Wait ‚Äì wait a minute. No, we‚Äôre leveling off‚Ä¶.we‚Äôre ok. I think we may be turning around‚Ä¶..That‚Äôs it ‚Äì we changed directions.  Do you hear me‚Ä¶.we‚Äôre flying east again.

Lisa: Ok Todd‚Ä¶. What‚Äôs going on with the other passengers?

Todd: Everyone is‚Ä¶ really scared. A few passengers with cell phones have made calls to relatives. A guy, Jeremy, was talking to his wife just before the hijacking started. She told him that hijackers had crashed two planes into the World Trade Center‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Lisa is that true??

Lisa: Todd‚Ä¶..I have to tell you the truth‚Ä¶..it‚Äôs very bad.  The World Trade Center is gone. Both of the towers have been destroyed.

Todd: Oh God ‚Äîhelp us!

Lisa: A third plane was taken over by terrorists. It crashed into the Pentagon in Washington DC. Our country is under attack‚Ä¶.and I‚Äôm afraid that your plane may be part of their plan.

Todd: Oh dear God. Dear God‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.Lisa, will you do something for me?

Lisa: I‚Äôll try‚Ä¶.if I can‚Ä¶.Yes.

Todd: I want you to call my wife and my kids for me and tell them what‚Äôs happened. Promise me you‚Äôll call..

Lisa: I promise ‚Äì I‚Äôll call.

Todd: Our home number is 201 353-1073‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.You have the same name as my wife‚Ä¶Lisa‚Ä¶.We‚Äôve been married for 10 years. She‚Äôs pregnant with our 3rd child. Tell her that I love her‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.(choking up)..I‚Äôll always love her..(clearing throat) We have two boys.. David, he‚Äôs 3 and Andrew, he‚Äôs 1‚Ä¶..Tell them‚Ä¶‚Ä¶(choking) tell them that their daddy loves them and that he is so proud of them. (clearing throat again) Our baby is due January 12th‚Ä¶..I saw an ultra sound‚Ä¶..it was great‚Ä¶.we still don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a girl or a boy‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Lisa?

Lisa: (barely able to speak) I‚Äôll tell them, I promise Todd.

Todd: I‚Äôm going back to the group‚Äîif I can get back I will‚Ä¶

Lisa: Todd, leave this line open‚Ä¶are you still there?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Lisa: (dials the phone..) Hello, FBI, my name is Lisa Jefferson, I‚Äôm a telephone supervisor for GTE. I need to report a terrorist hijacking of a United Airlines Flight 93‚Ä¶.Yes I‚Äôll hold.

Goodwin: Hello, this is Agent Goodwin.. I understand you have a hijacking situation?

Lisa: Yes sir, I‚Äôve been talking with a passenger, a Todd Beamer, on Flight 93 who managed to get to an air phone unnoticed.

Goodwin: Where did this flight originate, and what was its destination?

Lisa: The flight left Newark New Jersey at 8 A.M. departing for San Francisco. The hijackers took over the plane shortly after takeoff, and several minutes later the plane changed course ‚Äì it is now flying east.

Goodwin: Ms. Jefferson‚Ä¶I need to talk to someone aboard that plane. Can you get me thru to the planes phone?

Lisa: I still have that line open sir, I can patch you through on a conference call‚Ä¶hold a mo‚Ä¶..

Todd: Hello Lisa, Lisa are you there?

Lisa: Yes, I‚Äôm here. Todd, I made a call to the FBI, Agent Goodwin is on the line and will be talking to you as well.

Todd: The others all know that this isn‚Äôt your normal hijacking. Jeremy called his wife again on his cell phone. She told him more about the World Trade Center and all.

Goodwin: Hello Todd. This is Agent Goodwin with the FBI. We have been monitoring your flight. Your plane is on a course for Washington, DC. These terrorists sent two planes into the World Trade Center and one plane into the Pentagon. Our best guess is that they plan to fly your plane into either the White House or the United States Capital Building.

Todd: I understand‚Ä¶hold on‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I‚Äôll‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.I‚Äôll be back..

Lisa: Mr. Goodwin, how much time do they have before they get to Washington?

Goodwin: Not long ma‚Äôam. They changed course over Cleveland; they‚Äôre approaching Pittsburgh now. Washington may be twenty minutes away.

Todd: (breathing a little heavier) The plane seems to be changing directions just a little. It‚Äôs getting pretty rough up here. The plane is flying real erratic‚Ä¶.We‚Äôre not going to make it out of here. Listen to me‚Ä¶.I want you to hear this‚Ä¶.I have talked with the others‚Ä¶.we have decided we would not be pawns in these hijackers suicidal plot.

Lisa: Todd, what are you going to do?

Todd: We‚Äôve hatched a plan. Four of us are going to rush the hijacker with the bomb. After we take him out, we‚Äôll break into the cockpit. A stewardess is getting some boiling water to throw on the hijackers at the controls. We‚Äôll get them‚Ä¶.and we‚Äôll take them out. Lisa, ‚Ä¶..will you do one last thing for me?

Lisa: Yes‚Ä¶What is it?

Todd: Would you pray with me?

They pray: Our father which art in Heaven

Hallowed be thy name,

Thy kingdom come, thy will be done

on earth as it is in heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread,

And forgive us our trespasses

As we forgive our trespassers,

And lead us not into temptation

But deliver us from evil

For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory

Forever‚Ä¶..Amen

The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want‚Ä¶

He makes me to lie down in green pastures

He leads me beside the still waters

He restores my soul

He leads me in paths of righteousness

for His name‚Äôs sake

Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death

I will fear no evil, for thou art with me‚Ä¶..

Todd: (softer) God help me‚Ä¶Jesus help me‚Ä¶.(clears throat and louder)

Are you guys ready?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..

I apologize, I didn't know doing simple Google searches was difficult for you.

Maybe this would be better:

[Here](https://www.mayoclinic.org/coronavirus-covid-19/map/mississippi) is the trend data of daily COVID-19 cases for Mississippi (provided by Mayo Clinic). In the last 2 months, you can see case-positivity reached its peak of 0.1% in mid-August, and is currently trending downward, residing at 0.07% as of today. 

With this data, I can *assume* (as you did) that this is ""evenly distributed through the population"" and the case-positivity rate is 0.07% as of today, right?

&gt;I am going to assume  
&gt;  
&gt;Also going to assume

So why do I get downvoted for making assumptions using the best available data, but you get upvoted for making assumptions as well?

&gt;the positivity rate is still **10.2% at a minimum.**

Why?

Often to the point that they hardly come in contact with ‚Äúgood‚Äù information at all - folks that profit on fear and distrust invest a lot of money to drag &amp; keep people down their rabbit holes.

The #1 goal of bad actor propagandists is almost always to sow distrust and/or apathy.  Targets are usually told over &amp; over not to believe journalists, CDC, ‚Äùothers,‚Äù etc., so they become somewhat impervious to mainline sources.

Vaccines do prevent transmission but not 100%, it is completely possible to have a mild or asymptomatic virus infection with a vaccine, but these infections aren‚Äôt packing hospitals. In fact, if covid was this mild in the first place none of this would be happening. 

The problem is that the unvaccinated are having serious cases, and because there are so many from a lack of herd immunity this absolutely packs the hospitals. In Houston the wait time for the ER is over 24 hours. This is really bad for people who are there without covid. 

Look now and in every single hospital over 90% of the covid patients are unvaccinated. While it is scary hearing we might have to catch SARS-COV-2, there is a higher likelihood of dying to an antibiotic resistant bacterial infection. Only 1,587 vaccinated individuals died from the virus ( as of August 28, 2021). Compared to more than 35,000 people who died to antibiotic resistant infections in 2019. 

Right now in hospitals, 17% of the breakthrough infections were found to be asymptomatic and were hospitalized for reasons other than a viral infection and presumably caught the virus in the hospital.

You are using the wrong data, which leads to your results being artificially deflated. The chart you are looking at is labeled ‚ÄúAverage daily cases per 100,00 people.‚Äù  At no point does it refer to the rate of positivity. It is used to normalize data, that is to say it reduces the data down to a form that universally fits everywhere and allows you to compare two populations that are not equal. State A might have more cases than State B, but State A also has a lot more people. By looking at the rate per 100,000 people, we can see which of the two populations has a higher rate of illness.  This uses population data alone, and has nothing to do with testing. Testing positivity rate only uses testing data, and does not use any population data. 

You don‚Äôt have to believe me, [here‚Äôs how the CDC does it](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/resources/calculating-percent-positivity.html). For the third time, positivity only relates to the number of people testing positive divided by the number of people tested, the sum of all of the positive and negative tests. Absolutely no population data is required. For example: if only ten people in the state are tested, and nine test positive, the positivity is 90%. Likewise, if only 1 tested positive, the positivity rate would be 10%. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many people live in the state. It only matters how many were tested, and how many of those tests came back positive. 

If look again at [the Mayo Clinic link you cited](https://www.mayoclinic.org/coronavirus-covid-19/map/mississippi), and scroll down to the heading ‚ÄúMore trends for Mississippi‚Äù you will see a trend line. It is literally labeled ‚ÄúAverage positive test rate‚Äù.  It shows that the average rate for August was approximately 20% positivity. You don‚Äôt even need to do the math, they‚Äôve done all of that for you so that it‚Äôs done correctly. Again, you don‚Äôt have to believe me, simply look at the evidence you provided.

When I was young and really stupid about 22 yo (free health care here) and really broke, I caught a virus that turned into pneumonia. I never went in, so not sure what it was but it's the only time I've ever felt like I was ""losing"" the battle.

I was by myself delerious and propped up in my bed for a couple days. I'd wake up terrified, gasping for air every time I'd doze off laying down. My lungs felt wet, even more than wet. Like an overfilled sponge but every time you squeeze it, it's full again. I was fucking drowning when I laid down, but too stupid to know what was going on. I'm not sure I was thinking straight. 

Fever. Sweats. Cold. 

I was so exhausted, kept telling myself it'll turn around. I had barely any meds barely any food, lost at least ten pounds off my already thin frame, in the end. The coughing got me. It was savage never ended. Relief was when I got about ten breathes before an itch and a cough. 

The real scary part was when I was getting so weak there was no way I was getting help if I needed it, at least I felt that way. It took so much work to breathe. There was a point at which I was accepting the reality of how fucked I was. That I could die. And I truly felt this, that I was losing. Like oh shit, I'm dying, fuck. My life force draining. 

I feel asleep that night, woke up about 6 hours later. 

I started recovering. Was weeks before I was close to normal. In many ways. 

I smoked cigs at the time, didn't even THINK about that for about a week before I caved and was getting better ( quit years later).

They show hospitalization rates MUCH higher that the numbers you have provided.  And this is cumulative and isn't delta specific.  Delta numbers presumably would be at least a little bit higher, perhaps as high as 4% for some states.

They‚Äôre not difficult, but you still didn‚Äôt do them. 

Where do you find those stats on that page?  I see nothing showing numbers that low, not even the fatality rate. The positivity trend shows an approximate 20% positivity rate throughout the month of August. Assuming even distribution through the population means that school-aged children also had a positivity rate of 20%. 

You incorrectly divided the number of sick students by the whole student population. That tells you the percentage of the student population that got sick in August. THAT IS NOT THE POSITIVITY RATE. The positivity rate is the percentage of tests that returned positive results.  If a student wasn‚Äôt tested, they don‚Äôt count in the calculation. 

I determined a 10.2% positivity rate by taking the number of students that had positive tests (18,825) by the total number of tests administered across the state of Mississippi in the month of August (183,334).  183,334 is the largest number you can divide by because there are no more tests to include on that number. That‚Äôs it. It gets no bigger. So dividing the number of sick students by the largest number possible gives the bare minimum positivity rate possible, 10.2%.  That is if, and only if, every single test in the state was administered to a student. Fewer tests given to students reduces the denominator, thus giving a higher positivity rate. And we know the number is lower because teachers and staff also tested. It‚Äôs very safe to assume they weren‚Äôt the only adults tested. The result is that the positivity rate for students goes up from 10.2%.",,,,1631406638,{},hci3mhz,False,t3_pm7ouk,False,False,t1_hchsu6u,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pm7ouk/mississippi_teachers_beg_for_mask_mandate_after/hci3mhz/,1631513429.0,20,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

But classrooms probably aren‚Äôt the main culprit ‚Äî experts say locker rooms and fields are more to blame.

&gt;North Carolina has seen a ‚Äúsharp increase‚Äù in clusters of covid-19 in middle and high school sports teams, the state‚Äôs department of health and human services announced Wednesday.

&gt;Between July and September, 45 percent of all clusters in North Carolina middle and high schools stemmed from sports teams, according to the department, with a spike in August at the beginning of the school year.

&gt;Experts have been studying the risks of youth sports since students returned to their courts and fields last year. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, pointed to youth sports as a high-risk activity for coronavirus spread in April.

&gt;We‚Äôre finding out that it‚Äôs the team sports where kids are getting together, obviously many without masks, that are driving it, rather than in the classroom spread,‚Äù Fauci said on ‚ÄúGood Morning America.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhen you go back and take a look and try and track where these clusters of cases are coming from in the school, it‚Äôs just that.‚Äù

&gt;Outbreaks associated with sports have been tracked across the nation, from hockey practices in Minnesota to football games in Florida. Experts say sports-related clusters were common last year, so it‚Äôs no surprise they‚Äôre back ‚Äî especially amid the spread of the highly transmissible delta variant and pandemic fatigue.

&gt;And though children generally experience less-severe symptoms of covid-19, the delta variant has driven up pediatric hospitalizations. Some experts have said this part of the pandemic could be the most dangerous time for children so far.

&gt;North Carolina reported that last week, children 17 and under comprised more than 30 percent of the state‚Äôs new covid-19 cases ‚Äî the highest percentage of the pandemic.

""The three most advanced vaccines (from Oxford/AstraZeneca,
Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna) all work by inducing human cells to make copies of the S protein. The
expression of the vaccinal S protein is likely limited to the site of muscular injection. However, the
accidental passage of the adenoviral vector or mRNA-containing nanoparticles into the circulation may
lead to systemic expression, which could be harmful in predisposed individuals. Reported side effects,
including fatigue, muscle and joint pain, headache, severe fever, and anaphylactic reactions are likely
to be due to a transient reaction to the vehicle. However, more investigation is necessary to determine
if the occurrence of side effects may be associated with systemic levels of the transduced S protein"" from https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.21.423721v1.full.pdf",,,,1631458886,{},hckijuv,False,t3_pmszpf,False,False,t1_hckho9g,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pmszpf/covid19_spike_protein_binds_to_and_changes_cells/hckijuv/,1631561307.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Residents work extremely long hours 80 hours+ per week. I've heard of some specialty doing 100+ hrs plus per week. After a while, your clinical knowledge will become second nature and mentally demanding task become muscle memory.

The problem arises when you have these petty hooligans unknowingly spreading coronavirus wherever they go.

I've taken saliva tests numerous times, and they are a minor inconvenience at their absolute worst.

I firmly believe a negative COVID test should also be required for larger gatherings or said college campuses.

I expected to need a booster. Many vaccines come in series - hep A and B, rabies, MMR. The flu shot is annual. Tdap every 10 years and with each pregnancy.

No reason to be concerned.

But the people talking about it on the news/fda/cdc/feds KILL me. Do we need one? Is it 6 months? 8 months? Only immunocompromised people?

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, since its initial outbreak in Wuhan, China has led to a worldwide pandemic and has shut down nations. As with any outbreak, there is a general strategy of detection, containment, treatment and/or cure. The authors would argue that rapid and efficient detection is critical and required to successful management of a disease. The current study explores and successfully demonstrates the use of canines to detect COVID-19 disease in exhaled breath. The intended use was to detect the odor of COVID-19 on contaminated surfaces inferring recent deposition of infectious material from a COVID-19 positive individual. Using masks obtained from hospitalized patients that tested positive for COVID-19 disease, four canines were trained and evaluated for their ability to detect the disease. All four canines obtained an accuracy &gt;90% and positive predictive values ranging from \~73 to 93% after just one month of training.",,,,1631466636,{},hcl0kyz,True,t3_pmwpas,False,True,t3_pmwpas,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pmwpas/preliminary_accuracy_of_covid19_odor_detection_by/hcl0kyz/,1631571340.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The more people are vaccinated (or gain natural immunity) the less likely they are to get Covid, but the more likely they are to not notice when they do. Short of mandatory testing for everyone every two days, you can't kill-off a virus if the majority of carriers aren't even sure they have it. Given that a large percentage (40% according to some studies, like Imperial College's REACT survey) of people with no immunity had asymptomatic infections it's even more difficult.

My personal experience: I'm fairly sure I had Covid fairly early on, but there was a shortage of tests at the time so I will never actually know, but I definitely had something and Covid was the most common virus in circulation at the time. More recently I've been vaccinated. But in the intervening period I had no fewer than three weird episodes that were basically exactly the same as your example - sniffles, chills, etc., which would only last six hours or less. I didn't get tested then either as the form I needed to fill in said ""not the right symptoms"".

It was when I was vaccinated I realised how the vaccine side-effects were exactly the same. It made me think... what if that was my immune system fighting it off again? Did that count as ""an infection"", was I contagious? I have no idea...

The decision was based on gut intuition and a panic response attempting to get first doses to more people, not on data.  A decision to perform a controlled study with the goal of fostering greater immunity would have been welcome, but instead they made a decision to involuntarily experiment on the British people.

Notably, the JCVI walked back the 12-week interval to 8 weeks as more data became available indicating the depth of their error:  

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/three-quarters-of-uk-adults-vaccinated-with-first-dose

&gt; The move follows updated advice from the independent experts at the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which has considered the latest available evidence and has recommended reducing the dosing interval to counter the threat of new variants of concern.

There is widespread outrage at the decision to exclude 12-15 year olds from being offered immunizations against COVID-19, as it is not backed by the latest available data.  The risks to this population from COVID clearly exceed the risks from vaccination, even ignoring the huge community benefits of vaccination, and preventing them from being immunized borders on negligence.  The BMA (not BMJ, as you incorrectly state) statement is responding to the first walk-back that occurred in August, where the JCVI conceded that counter to their original advice, 12-15 year olds sharing a household with immunocompromised adults should be offered a vaccine.  

The UK was the slowest country to react to AstraZeneca blood clot concerns, and the regulators attempted to conceal the growing reports during late March.  The Financial Times [(non-paywalled mirror)](https://presslasvegas.com/news/uk/slow-uk-response-to-astrazeneca-side-effects-alarms-experts/) said:

&gt; Because the MHRA is generally held in very high regard in UK medical circles ‚Äî and praised for its speed in reviewing new Covid-19 therapies and vaccines for clinical trials and emergency use in the pandemic ‚Äî experts have been unwilling publicly to criticise its response to AstraZeneca side-effects.

These cases are extremely rare in the population. This is not to say that it's a non issue, any adverse  reaction known to be caused by a vaccine should be taken very seriously. But in sheer numbers it is still extremely extremely low. The groups at most risk for this are males between the ages of 18-35, especially those who have a high cardiovascular fitness like athletes. Essentially all of the cases of this have been mild (given even a mild case of myocarditis sucks and can be pretty impactful on wellbeing) and cleared up with basic therapies and rest. Still takes a while to clear up, like 2-4 weeks. But there's no evidence to say that it would cause long term complications. 

Also the risk of this exact same kind of myocarditis is higher in regular covid infection, while on top of it you would also have the virus actually infecting the heart tissues too. It's also reported in handfuls of people from other vaccines, autoimmune diseases, allergen responses, and other viruses as well. Nearly all vaccine injury is caused by the immune system doing its job, and just doing it a bit too hard.

So normally they would  be 666 dead statistically who died this month, who had  covid,  so instead of 3600 reported covid deaths , they have in fact 3000 deaths. So they have only 100 deaths a day.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the problem is how many people do tests, if we suppose that only 1 of 2 people who has covid actually does the test.  We can conclude that they only have 50 deaths a day.

The probleme is I have I have no idea of of  how much many ""unconfirmed cases"" there ? Do some people have some numbers ?

We all have ACE2 in our lungs, because we all need to regulate blood pressure. It's most concentrated in the Kidneys though because they are most in charge of blood pressure regulation, along with your heart. 

Your ACE2 concentrations are different depending on sex, age, ethnicity, health etc. 

Smokers, old people, diabetics, anyone with hypertension have higher levels of ACE2 overall

Males have higher concentrations than females, and that increases with age (and is actually mediated by testosterone)

People of African descent (this includes black americans) tend to have higher concentrations of ACE2 in the nasal mucosa  Which may or may not affect the outcome of the disease, but may increase how likely someone is to get infected (this is only a single factor as to why communities of color have been hit the worst, especially in the major cities)

Children don't have blood pressure regulation issues normally, so they have very low levels of ACE2.

How a person gets infected can also have a big impact on where that infection leads. Most people are first infected through the nasal lining, which would start with headaches and sinus pressure, and the spread of the virus basically moves downward. Because of immunomodulatory properties, in early infection the virus can suppress pain and immune response which will allow it to replicate without causing symptoms, at least until the viral load is too high and immune activation is inevitable. If you are in those groups that has a lot of ACE2 the amount of infected cells that you have as soon as your immune system kicks in is also a lot higher. Thus you're more likely to have worse symptoms. 
Obviously if you just direct inhale into your lungs, this is much worse

Some people are able to clear the virus successfully before the lower respiratory damage becomes too bad, and therefore will likely not experience pneumonia.

The Court held that the First Amendment's protection of the ""free exercise"" of religion does not allow a person to use a religious motivation as a reason not to obey such generally applicable laws. Citing Reynolds v. United States (1878), Scalia wrote, ""To permit this would be to make the professed doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the land, and in effect to permit every citizen to become a law unto himself.""[4] Thus, the Court had held that religious beliefs did not excuse people from complying with laws forbidding polygamy, child labor laws, Sunday closing laws, laws requiring citizens to register for Selective Service, or laws requiring the payment of Social Security taxes.",,,,1631453155,{},hck67l3,False,t3_pmi7vg,False,False,t1_hcjm3fc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pmi7vg/vaccine_resisters_seek_religious_exemptions_but/hck67l3/,1631553803.0,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt; A top Pfizer executive has called Israel a ‚Äúsort of laboratory‚Äù for the COVID vaccine in comments that were seized on by local anti-vaxxers, rejected by Israeli health officials, and later clarified by the pharmaceutical company.

&gt; Philip Dormitzer, the chief scientific officer at Pfizer, made the comments to a Zoom gathering of academics last week. They were first reported by Channel 12 news on Friday night.

&gt; ‚ÄúEarly in the pandemic we established a relationship with the Israeli Ministry of Health where they used exclusively the Pfizer vaccine and then monitored it very closely,‚Äù Dormitzer told the gathering, ‚Äúso we had a sort of laboratory where we could see the effect.‚Äù

&gt;He added that Israel ‚Äúimmunized a very high proportion of the population very early ‚Äî so it‚Äôs been a way that we can almost look ahead: What we see happening in Israel happens again in the US a couple months later.‚Äù

&gt; On Sunday morning, Health Ministry Director General Nachman Ash rejected the claim that Israel had any sort of exclusive deal with Pfizer. ‚ÄúThere is no exclusivity with Pfizer in any shape or form,‚Äù he told 103FM radio. ‚ÄúCurrently, those over 18 who are getting vaccinated are prioritized to receive the Moderna vaccine.‚Äù

&gt; Ash said that Israel is ‚Äústudying the statistics, and the world certainly learns from them, but I am not prepared to use the word ‚Äòlaboratory.‚Äô Yes, the company is learning from us about the [effectiveness] of the third dose, but there is no connection to harming the interests of Israeli citizens.‚Äù

&gt; Israel was an early leader in COVID vaccinations after having cut a deal with Pfizer to receive a large number of vaccine doses before many other countries. It also purchased a smaller number of Moderna vaccines, which it began using more widely in July and August when its Pfizer stockpile neared expiration. Israel rolled out its vaccines rapidly to large portions of the population, vaccinating 50 percent of all residents by March, then began an unprecedented rollout of third booster shots in August. As of Sunday, more than 2.8 million people had received a third dose.

&gt; Prominent anti-vaccine activists both in Israel and around the world seized on Dormitzer‚Äôs comments over the weekend. Eldad Yaniv, a vocal critic of the government‚Äôs COVID approach, shared the Channel 12 report and said it provides further support for the decision of those Israelis ‚Äúwho do not agree to take part in the Pfizer experiment being operated in Israel.‚Äù

&gt; Others claimed that Dormitzer‚Äôs comments had been taken out of context and improperly translated and sensationalized by Channel 12. The Pfizer scientist did not say that Israel and Pfizer had an exclusive deal, but rather that Israel ‚Äúused exclusively the Pfizer vaccine.‚Äù He also didn‚Äôt call Israel a laboratory but said its vaccine rollout provided an opportunity for ‚Äúsort of a laboratory.‚Äù

&gt; Pfizer later clarified Dormitzer‚Äôs comments in a statement to Channel 12 news.

&gt; ‚ÄúPfizer is aware of a video clip featuring an interview with one of our scientists who unfortunately misspoke on a key point we wish to clarify: We are grateful for the cooperation between Pfizer and the Israeli Health Ministry. It is not a clinical research study. This is a non-interventional ‚Äòreal world‚Äô evidence data collection collaboration.‚Äù

&gt; The pharmaceutical company also noted that it had no exclusive deal with Israel and ‚Äúthe country does not serve as a laboratory, but rather, as the first nation to achieve significant rates of vaccine uptake, it was able to evaluate real world vaccine and duration of protection, and share data with the world.‚Äù

LOL, in December we had an exposure scare where both myself and my wife were in proximity to one of our workers who later tested positive for covid-19 after exhibiting symptoms.  They and we all wore masks and we would distance at work, so the risk was low but still there, and one of our kidless friends was telling us how we need to keep away from our son while at home so we wouldn't risk spreading it to him.  We all eventually tested negative, but the ridiculousness of that almost had us laughing, if we hadn't been so freaked out.",,,,1631457113,{},hcken7m,False,t3_plz5gl,False,True,t1_hcj61se,/r/Coronavirus/comments/plz5gl/pfizer_to_seek_fda_eua_for_covid19_vaccine_for_5/hcken7m/,1631559021.0,2,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,
