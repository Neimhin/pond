I think the coming waves will likely become more and more regional, as we move to an endemic stage.

The reason why it’s impossible to predict is because, well, it’s really hard to predict people. How many will get vaxxed? Wear masks? Avoid holiday travel? How many are sick of taking precautions and are done with it? Ready to throw that long overdue wedding? Have a birthday party?

That being said, there are still a ton of factors that can affect spread which vary greatly from location to location:
- population density / urban crowding
- climate
- public health infrastructure 
- poverty 
- immunity status of individuals
- health of population / comorbidites
- age of population
- behavior of people
- sex of population
- genetics
- restrictions &amp; policies I.e. mask mandates, and how strictly are the followed 
- timing of vaccines or initial exposure (assuming immunity wains)

The list could go on and on. I would love if we could wrap it all up in a bow and make more accurate predictions, but time and time again we have proven ourselves incapable of modeling this virus. It’s incredibly complex and easy to get wrong.

?Healthcare workers who did not test positive for COVID-19, despite heavy exposure to infected patients, had T cells that attacked a part of the virus that lets it make copies of itself, according to a report published Wednesday in Nature. Researchers who studied the 58 healthcare workers found their T cells responded more strongly to a part of the virus, called the RTC, that is very similar on all human and animal coronaviruses, including all variants of SARS-CoV-2. They suspect the T cells recognized the RTC because they had ""seen"" it on other viruses during other infections. That makes the RTC a potentially good target for vaccines if more research confirms these findings, study leaders Mala Maini and Leo Swadling, both of University College London, said in a joint email to Reuters.

However, +90% of people in Delhi have antibodies to the Delta variant and they seem to have reached herd immunity. Look at the graph here:

https://www.google.com/search?q=dehli%20Covid-19%

I know that's a dangerous thing to say, it's been said before and new waves happened. 

What seems to have caused new waves, after herd immunity was possibly achieved, were the emergence of new more contagious variants, with higher herd immunity thresholds, and an ability to reinfect people. 

27% of people in Delhi were reinfected during the Delta variant outbreak (40-60% had antibodies, mostly Alpha variant and Wuhan). If there isn't a new more contagious variant that circumvents immunity, and can reinfect people, then this might last. 

As for other countries, I wonder if they might be able reach herd immunity if large percentage of their populations develope immunity to the Delta variant, via breakthrough infections and via boosters, which scientists think can confer increased immunity against variants, including Delta.

Then they said oh well you catch it just not as bad..lmao.. I literally knew said elementary school about natural immunity because I got sick alot. So I was curious. Some how you can't figure that out when literally I could give you over 1000 doctors that actually work in the icu for covid.. One thing you should realize is the vaccine wears off way faster then any other vaccine. To already get a booster shot in not even a year? I'm trying to actually help people by giving them medicines that actually help you. Having a strong immune system is key. You don't die from covid you die from the inflammation it causes. Which there's ways to treat that. We have special doctors who treat the lungs and heart.. I name call when someone ignorant as yourself literally attacks first.  I didn't say not to take the vaccine did I? Just because I speak truth you get upset. So do you not know that covid attacks your immune system? The problem is I listen to many doctors who communicate with each other and people like yourself just listen to the mainstream bs. Before this covid started doctors actually would communicate and now for some reason someone finds ways to treat covid and the get banned are shammed because it's not what the mainstream wants to hear. When everything I say is all backed up by evidence and data. So if you actually want to learn something let me know. We can show data and see what information is good. Also most places with really high vaccination rates have really high cases. How does that make sense? One thing your kinda right on is the vaccine helps your immune system but the problem with that is once you take it you might have to keep taking the vaccine few times a year are you'll have a weak immune system. That's up for debate so you can't claim you know that.

The innate immune system of a *school age (5-11)* child is generally more agile at responding to new viral threats and they create immune memory faster. The immune system becomes less agile with age, just like adults become more achy and slow as they get older.

So while children can get COVID and transmit the virus, a theory is that it doesn't spread as much with young children as 18+. 

This isn't to say an almost entirely unvaccinated population in schools isn't a vector for transmission into otherwise fully vaccinated households.

The legislation:
&gt; There should therefore no longer be a new lockdown or school closings. Instead, it should be **possible to introduce distance requirements in public spaces, the wearing of masks and 3G for companies and events**. Corona rapid tests should be free again. The regulations should initially apply until March 19, 2022

Wearing a mask merely protects others from you for a short period of time.

A vaccine helps prevent mutations in the virus, it also reduces transmission rate by a large amount.

""Oh no it doesn't, you can still infect others"" I hear some idiot without any common sense cry.

But no, you DO reduce transmission by being vaccinated. Because first, you are going to suffer the effects of Covid less. This means you will cough much less. How does Covid travel? By water droplets expelled from your breath, that are projected much farther when you shout or cough. So by reducing the coughing you reduce the transmission by a lot.

In addition, you beat the infection much faster. You therefore are infectious for much less time.

So getting the vaccine is provably better for everyone.

""But it's not safe, it's too new!!!"" I hear more idiots scream.

But no, that's also bullshit. The vaccine is based on stuff that is many years old. It just needed minor tweaks, in exactly the same way a flu jab is based on stuff from previous research with just minor tweaks.

""But it was rushed out!!!"" No, it wasn't, and stop proving you know nothing about how vaccines are researched. A vaccine requires funding, and when it comes to researching these things they usually have a lot of delay in getting funding and people to trial the vaccine on. So it takes many years to get the funding and do all the tests. The difference here is they got the funding basically overnight as many businesses and governments threw money at multiple researchers to find a vaccine or cure, and they had test subjects lined up to help the research. So no, it wasn't rushed, it took the same amount of time to trial.

""What about the long term effects of the vaccine! We don't know them!""

To an extent true, but first, it's still based off previous work where we do know there are no long term effects. Then there's the fact that what few minor side effects we've heard of are so few and far between that they're not worth thinking about.

""Aha, but dying of Covid is rare too!""

Yes, but the side effects from the vaccines are rarer. What's more, you now ignore all of the long term side effects from Covid, which are always conveniently ignored in the ""Covid isn't that serious"" rhetoric.

And in addition, those side effects of the vaccines are all basically not proven. Just because someone gets a blood clot after the vaccine, there is zero evidence it was the vaccine that caused it. It's much more likely that it comes from them smoking, or taking birth control, or many other things that have a higher provable chance of getting a blood clot than any vaccination has. The amount of people suffering severe side effects (as in, not a headache or sore arm, or feeling nauseous) is so small that it's actually more likely to be something else causing it than the vaccine.

Based on a national survey of U.S. adults conducted six weeks into the COVID-19 pandemic, this article investigates how crisis affects religious faith. Almost no Americans reported losing or a weakening of faith in response to the pandemic at this time. By contrast, nearly one-third of believers indicated that the coronavirus outbreak had strengthened their faith. We theoretically develop and empirically test three religious factors—theodicy, practices, and tradition—to explain variation in the strengthening effect of the COVID-19 pandemic among believers. Results from statistical models show that two theodicic interpretations—believing that God: is using the pandemic as a way to tell humanity to change; and will personally protect you from the virus—significantly increased believers’ reports of faith strengthening, controlling for other factors. We also found that Black Protestants were more likely to report these interpretations, which in turn strengthened their faith in response to the pandemic.",,,,1636893020,{},hkkx2fo,True,t3_qtounm,False,True,t3_qtounm,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qtounm/theodicy_and_crisis_explaining_variation_in_us/hkkx2fo/,1637185757.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,PokeCaldy,,,[],,,,text,t2_10adkt,False,False,,"To be honest, 3G is a bad joke in the current situation and he literally says ""Weil diese Maßnahmen nach wissenschaftlichen Untersuchungen keine Wirksamkeit haben und weil auch deutsche Gerichte solche Ausgangsbeschränkungen ja bereits verworfen haben"" ([source](https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/politik/corona-lindner-kontaktbeschraenkungen-100.html)) which means - since we're in an english subreddit that distancing measures ""have be scientifically proven to be without effect and have been recalled by courts"". The first point is simply false (and don't pull that Ioannidis study on me I have argued about that a few times too many) and the second point is technically true since in the Saarland a court found the rules ""unclear"" and lifted them temporarily to have the state government clarify them (which took about 4 days after which they were deemed legally correct and were put back in place).  
After a completely disbelieving Ingo Zamperoni asked to hear this again, he then added something about studies with vaccinated people - which is also summarily untrue since while vaccination reduces transmission, it is no where near zero in vaccinated people (see here for a recent study from [last month in NEJM](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2106757) )

So he either is very uninformed - or he was using a dogwhistle, something he has done in the past.  (I think we can agree on him not being too stupid to understand the things he was saying.)

Also, let's not forget that there are several specialist in state legislation that call their claims of ""legal necessity"" to remove the ability for several measures a false claim (with the notable exception of the curfew rules).

Also even other members of his own party are now declaring their legislation insufficient for example the secretary of health in Schleswig-Holstein who is arguing that the ""Ampel"" aka traffic light coalition (still forming, no real government yet in Germany) should rescind previous statements and keep the laws for exceptional pandemic situations in place instead of lifting them end of November.

Lastly, you either need to look at the complete definition of social distancing measures (I recommend [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing#Measures) ) and realize that they are taking away almost all effective measures except for the hardly controllable physical distancing in public.

So yes - you can get a correction from me as follows since I might have formulated a tiny bit too broadly:

""his party is planing legislation which will forbid closing of schools and any social distancing measures except physical distancing in public places even for the regional governments.""

It finds a vulnerable population, burns through it, then crashes when it runs out of hosts because the pool of those once susceptible people is surrounded by an immune herd. 

In the US for example, the population is so heterogeneous in behaviors and immunity and travel is so common that the virus has lots of opportunities to find new susceptible pools.

So if a virus finds a pool of susceptible hosts it will surge in that pool. It does not matter how many people outside that pool are vaccinated once it’s gotten in. ￼Herd immunity just limits a viruses ability to travel so you get *some* herd immunity even after the very first infection but of the virus is wide spread and being moved around a lot then herd immunity will be less effective. 

It’s possible that if we eliminated spread for a little while we might find that we are already passed the thresholded needed for herd immunity to reliably protect us but we never even stopped the spread from the first wave so we’ll probably need a much larger percentage to become immune before we’ll benefit as much as we might have otherwise from herd immunity.",,,,1636876896,{},hkkb46x,False,t3_qt7tqo,False,False,t1_hkjeo9k,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qt7tqo/analysis_with_boosters_masks_and_green_pass/hkkb46x/,1637173707.0,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,billatq,,,[],,,,text,t2_4lsvi,False,False,[],"I agree with you that it's not the answer in this specific case, but I think the reason for that is a bit more nuanced.

I think there's two things going on here:

* The actual system of units
* The convention of the system of units

I'm talking less about the actual system of units and more about the conventions that come along with it, even though most of the time folks mean the system or both.

I pointed out above that for weights and measures, we don't actually use fractions in the US. Eliminating fractions solves the burger-confusion problem, which is precisely why you never see fractions at the grocery store at the point of sale.

NIST Handbook 44 (2020) has this to say about that:

&gt;S.1.8.4. Customer’s  Indications.  –  Weight  indications  shall  be  shown  on  the  customer’s side of computing scales when these are used for direct sales to retail customers. Computing scales equipped on the operator’s side with digital indications, such as the net weight, unit price, or total price, shall be similarly equipped on the customer’s side. Unit price displays visible to the customer shall be in terms of single whole units of  weight and **not in common or decimal fractions of the unit**. Scales indicating in metric units may indicate price per 100 g.

Any unit can be decimalized, and this is what is done in the US when it needs to be unambiguous to the customer without requiring math (also see fuel pumps). If we got rid of all the minor units and standardized on a few that would then be decimalized, that would nicely solve this issue. I'd be pretty happy if we just used pounds and gallons with prefixes so that I don't have to think about unit conversion too hard. About 90% of my use of voice assistants is checking my US customary unit conversions, which is kind of absurd when you think about it.

To your point, smaller units such as ounces do let you represent these weights without fractions, but due to the way that the US customary system works (and how burgers are sold, specifically by the pound), those are just sneaky fractions. An 8oz burger (albeit delicious) is just a 8/16 -&gt; 1/2 lbs burger, and now we're back to the original problem.

And let's be honest, even if we did use metric everywhere in the US, a quarter-pound burger would likely still be advertised as that for some time to come because of inertia, so the confusion wouldn't disappear anytime soon.

This is a long way to say that I don't think the metric system per-se solves the problem, the metric convention solves the problem. If we adopted more of those conventions with US customary units (like we already do at the grocery store, or while filling up a car with fuel for example), then that also solves the problem.",,,,1636902682,{},hklfiw0,False,t3_qslkee,False,True,t1_hkl8hqz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qslkee/covid_misinformation_spreads_because_so_many/hklfiw0/,1637195913.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study itself says:

&gt; Clinical studies have indicated that **patients with severe COVID–19** exhibit delayed and weak adaptive immune responses; however, the mechanism by which SARS–CoV–2 impedes adaptive immunity remains unclear. Here, by using an in vitro cell line, we report that the SARS–CoV–2 spike protein significantly inhibits DNA damage repair, which is required for effective V(D)J recombination in adaptive immunity. Mechanistically, we found that the spike protein localizes in the nucleus and inhibits DNA damage repair by impeding key DNA repair protein BRCA1 and 53BP1 recruitment to the damage site. 

So, this is rather about people with severe Covid, which the vaccines protect against, and not a bashing of mrna vaccines. The jump to this conclusion seems disingenious. Furthermore there seem more problems with this study, i link to this discussion:

https://old.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/qkq3qp/sarscov2_spike_impairs_dna_damage_repair_and/

I recommend reading the comment starting with:

&gt; TL;DR - the findings are of questionable physiological relevance since they use a completely irrelevant cell line (kidney cells), rather than using lymphocyte progenitors (immune cells that actually engage in VDJ recombination) and airway cell lines.

Furthermore you delete all your comments, which usually is a red flag.

Oh and yes, vaccines for flights are totally a thing since decades to enter certain countries.

I feel your base of thought comes from a wrong premise.

As society we don't strive to attain absolute freedom. Hell, no one advocates that people should be free to do mass murders, almost all countries on earth have laws against guns and people agree with it, stealing is also something we agree people should not be free to do, etc...

Point is, we as society are constantly looking to improve safety and security in place of freedom, not the other way around. Even when you look at cars and how dangerous they are, you realize that 99% of accidents happen because people broke the law and regulations we have in place, that remove freedoms from drivers but improves safety. For the other 1%, governments are constantly trying to find solutions that will improve safety.

This is seen in all sectors, from aviation to food to healthcare. From the past to present and will continue on following the same trend on the future. 

Summing up, don't use excuses of freedom because that's wrong in every level. Just admit instead that you don't want vaccine mandates for personal reasons, it's ok to admit that, I also don't agree with vaccine mandates (mainly because I don't believe vaccines are the way to get us out of the pandemic).

Yeah.  So ideally we'd know the deaths/hospitalizations figures, but cases already lag 1-2 weeks behind infections.  If we try to follow hospitalizations it's weeks, and following deaths would mean we're looking at a snapshot of the pandemic from as much as months ago.

You have [76% 2-dose vaccination rate](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations), better than a lot of places, but nowhere near Mumbai's 87% seropositivity at which point the Delta pandemic ended there.  As far as I know you're not giving any third doses so nobody is fully vaccinated against Delta - only 11% of the population would currently be eligible, but that number is going to rocket up over the next few months.

The problem is cases [are currently growing](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/netherlands/) about 42% a week.  With a 5-day serial interval that's R(t)~1.28.  All you really have to do is slow that rate and be fine, but a 42% weekly growth isn't sustainable for long.  It means that today's hospitalizations, if they're from 3 weeks ago on average, are already on pace to increase nearly 3-fold from infections that have already happened.  R(t)~1.28 implies a final attack rate of [40%](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/5bl3dzrys3) of the remaining susceptible.  

How many susceptible there still are I have no idea.  The highest it could be would be around 40% (everyone unvaccinated and a decent portion of the 2-dose vaccinated), which would imply 70,000 total hospitalizations and 8,000 deaths in an unmitigated wave.  But it could easily be a third of that, in which case flatting the curve a bit is all you'd really need to do.

The thing is you *cannot* isolate a group of people from the virus. And this is true also in the case of unvaccinated people. So if you do not want to reduce the spread, you accept that they get infected in huge numbers, that many of them - arund 100,000 perhaps - die, and that the health system collapses.

In terms of R0, you only have three options:

R0 &gt; 1: This is the case described above. It is utterly unacceptable.


R0 &lt; 1: Here you would need to sustain measures which lower incidence numbers. Many deaths as well as the collapse of the health system can be prevented. And this can be relaxed once enough people are vaccinated - I personally do not believe now that we will get any further without vaccine mandates

R0 = 1.0: This would mean to have enough measures so that the cases just do not raise further. It requires a much higher level of control than the previous alternative. It also means that you have to deal with very high case numbers *all the time*. This it is *harder* than the R &lt; 1 strategy, *and more costly on top of that*. It is like Sisyphus not only rolling the stone again and again up the hill, but carrying on his arms and balancing it on his head.

You could also allow rising incidence numbers for some time, and then spend considerable effort to lower them again for other periods of time. This is akin to that firemen get to a burning refinery plant, almost put the fire out, and then pack their equipment and leave when the fire is smaller, just to return at a later time. This is nonsense. And this is exactly what we have been doing, and why the handling of Covid in Germany lacks any strategy and vision.

I don't know of anyone who is claiming that cold-chain transmission is a major contributor to the pandemic. In a zero-CoVID environment, however, you care about any route by which the virus could re-enter the country. Countries that have tens of thousands of new cases a day don't care about rare transmission routes. Countries that have zero local infections a day do care.

&gt; You do have a point with the poor vaccines China has come up with

The vaccines in use in China are similar in efficacy to AstraZeneca, and somewhat better than Johnson &amp; Johnson. In fact, some of them are technically very similar to the AZ and J&amp;J shots (adenovirus vector vaccines). They're not as effective as the mRNA vaccines, but they still reduce hospitalization and death by 90%.

Vaccine quality is not the issue. If China were to abandon its zero-CoVID policy, it could experience the same sort of large-scale outbreak that Europe is going through right now (despite relatively high vaccination rates, using mRNA vaccines). That prospect is viewed as unacceptable in China.",,,,1636844571,{},hkiis6u,False,t3_qsb3he,False,False,t1_hkg3y2s,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qsb3he/aiming_for_zero_covid_china_focuses_on_frozen/hkiis6u/,1637139026.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

“With age, a person’s social circles expand, so the ability to tell people apart—a cognitively difficult task—becomes more important. New research suggests that brain areas involved in recognizing faces grow as children develop and that the growth spurt may heighten our face-recognition faculties.

The findings, neuroscientists said, could have implications for understanding not just normal brain development in children, but also disorders like dyslexia, schizophrenia, autism and prosopagnosia, or face blindness—a condition that prevents people from recognizing others.”

It was believed that diabetes was a metabolic disease, but research has upended that misnomer and has revealed that it's actually an autoimmune disease. Please look things up before you try to correct someone, especially if it's related to medicine/health.

&gt;Type 1 diabetes is an organ-specific [autoimmune disease](https://www.virology.ws/tag/coxsackievirus/) that is characterized by the loss of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. The loss of these cells leads to decreased insulin production (hypoinsulinemia) and increased levels of glucose in the blood (hyperglycemia). While it is still unclear what exactly causes the loss of beta cells, experts agree that it is likely a combination of genetic and environmental factors. An increasing body of evidence suggests that Coxsackievirus strain B4 is an environmental trigger, because it specifically targets beta cells, causing them to die.

However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data.

scroll down to where it lists the statistical analyses. you'll see HCQ performing the exact same as placebo on most of those points with the exception of death by day 15 where it performs 25% worse than placebo.

and by day 28 they added up the deaths and the ECMOs (since they are basically dead, sad to say, at that point) and HCQ was the same as placebo

you can keep going past that and see the HCQ folks having seizures, more Afib, double the cardiac arrest, much higher rates of anemia, more thrombo, and overall longer to recover.

if you look under each section of that statistical analysis where it says ""estimated value"" you'll see a number, usually 1.1, 0.95, 1.2 that kind of thing and it shows how much better or worse the HCQ is compared to the placebo. below that is a confidence interval, where if they could have increased the study by large numbers of people they would expect the given results 95% of the time. so you'll see numbers like 0.5-1.5 or 0.9-1.1 or something along those lines.

I don’t know, but I just believe that humans are intrinsically selfish and also easily manipulated through fear, neither are fantastic and I believe we have seen manipulation from both sides of the spectrum. COVID, at least for me just opened the divide further.

That’s why ultimately, it is selfish for either sides to determine what they’re limited to through their choice.

Pros and cons exist, people have weighed these up and have stuck to what they believe is best for them. Why should this restrict them?

But the moral idea behind this is what sticks with me. If someone drink drives and kills someone, theoretically if they’re released from prison and have had the vaccine they have their full freedom, they can obtain another car? But a normal tax paying citizen, who has never committed a crime but is against the vaccination, how are we to restrict them? It can somewhat become a prison, from freedom of choice? 

A chance to do harm others exist, with and without the vaccine, yes it’s slimmer with the vaccination, but tallying this against the everyday roll of the dice, who really gives a fuck deep down in side.

I think a lot of this has been overblown, for power grabs, for the progress of science and a whole other heap of shit. Lots of positives and lots of negatives.

&gt;The city said across all departments 41,423 workers were now fully vaccinated, or about 77% of LA's 53,600-plus member workforce. Another 875 employees received their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine since the mandatory vaccination deadline on Oct. 19.

&gt;About half of city workers said in September they'd been vaccinated. That rose to about 70% in mid October. 

&gt;More detailed information about the rates within various city departments were expected Monday. The officials said some data collection and analysis issues had clouded the information  reported in the last three weeks.

&gt;LAPD Chief Michel Moore said Tuesday that 78% of police employees, including both officers and support staff, were now at least partially vaccinated. 

&gt;More than 2,000 LAPD employees indicated last month they intended to seek religious or medical exemption from the vaccine, and Moore told officers in an internal video message he intended to grant as many exemptions as possible.

&gt;Also Friday an LA Superior Court Judge in Downtown refused to grant another temporary restraining order to stop the implementation of the city's mandatory vaccine program.

&gt;The union that represents most LA city firefighters argued the city violated labor relations rules and forced the terms of the program on firefighters. The judge agreed to hear the complaints Dec. 2 but said the allegations made by the union did not meet the legal standard for an emergency court order.

&gt;During a hearing an attorney for the firefighters' union said more than 800 firefighters were unvaccinated. 

&gt;The same judge denied another temporary restraining order request from the union that represents most police officers, the Los Angeles Police Protective League, but agreed to hear the League's complaints about labor relations and other issues in early December. ﻿",,,,1636843423,{},hkig3m7,True,t3_qtbyet,False,True,t3_qtbyet,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qtbyet/la_covid19_employee_mandate_pushes_up_vaccination/hkig3m7/,1637137744.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the meantime, computed models deliver best-case scenarios with 50,000 and worst-case scenarios with 200,000 deaths, more than twice the number of deaths so far. A collapse of the intensive care system is nearly inevitable, in spite of that Germany has among the highest number of UCI beds per capita in OECD countries.

And many of the politicians think that it is possible to separate vaccinated and unvaccinated, which is not well supported by previous experiences with at-risk groups to put it mildly. The current idea is that partial restrictions for unvaccinated people (2G rules) would solve the issue, while allowing them general access for example to supermarkets and public transport. 

And what helps even less is that school closures have been turned from something undesirable into a fundamental issue. So, we have extremely high incidence numbers in the age group between 5 and 14 years, in some places more than 1000 per 100,000 inhabitants.

It is not only anti-vaxxers, but politicians in general have failed to communicate the reality of the situation and return to ""normality"" in a somewhat ham-fisted manner.

Objective: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) threatened not only people’s physical health but also every aspect of their psychological well-being: from their struggle to avoid contracting the disease, to their coping with the disruption of the normal course of their lives, to the trauma they endured when the virus took the lives of those they loved. The objective of this article is to consider the group-level processes that sustain people’s physical and psychological well-being during COVID-19. Method: Applying group dynamic and group therapy theory and research, we explore why COVID-19 spread so rapidly. We also explore how people cope with prolonged social isolation, distress, and social inequities, as well as how people deal with the psychological trauma of the disease, which includes heightened levels of depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and complicated bereavement. Results: Researchers and theorists suggest that human beings are fundamentally social, and the need to gather with others is extremely important, especially during times of distress. The need to belong as well as the importance of reducing loneliness during uncertain times often encourages people to connect, despite recommendations to remain socially distant. Conclusions: Group treatment options developed by group psychotherapists are effective at reducing depression, anxiety, complicated grief, and stress. We conclude by examining the growing impact of online groups and the many ways that these groups help people improve their psychological well-being during the COVID-19 crisis.

Aktuelle Corona-Lage mit Jens Spahn (CDU) &amp; Lothar Wieler (RKI) | BPK 12. November 2021

Prof. Dr. Wieler, head of RKI:

&gt; ""Yesterday we had for the first time ever over 50.000 infections on a single day. Out of these 50.000 cases 3.000 will need to see hospitalisation. Out of these 50.000 cases at least 350 need to be admitted to ICU. Out of these 50.000 people at least 200 will die. [...] It is important to me to make you realize what these numbers mean. This is the result of a single day of 50.000 cases. It is clear that the incidence will rise further. There are hard weeks and months ahead for us. [...] To disarm this dangerous developement everyone needs to change their behaviour. Reduce your contacts. Wear masks. [...] 2G is not enough anymore. [...] Bars and clubs should be considered to be closed. Everyone should get tested, even the vaccinated before meeting risk groups. We publicized these recommendations since September, they need to be taken into action now.""

You have to take action *before* an infection blitz gets going. Once it's started, it's too late, and you won't be able to stop it, even if you can somehow slow it down. Second reason: a whole lot of spread happens in households, which are mostly beyond the reach of public health measures both legally and practically. If people are going to spread at home or in other private settings, there's basically nothing you can do about it. You can try to lay down some rules, but again, that's too little, too late, like throwing down sandbags when there's already a raging flood.
