This is ok, the human body doesn’t just have 1 single antibody per pathogen so if one stops working we have backups. The types of antibodies are classified according to their target on the virus, ie class 1 to class 3.

The worry now is that all 3 classes of antibodies can potentially be affected due to all the needed mutations being found in the Mu variant.

If this is true, then we need an updated vaccine specific to this Mu variant immediately. Else it’s going to be a renewed wave of infections again.

However there is some evidence that this won’t happen, not all antibodies from each class are made ineffective. We don’t have enough research to know what is going to happen yet.

The good news is that we have the sequence for the Mu variant and the production plant for mRNA vaccines, we can easily swop out the current DNA template for a new template for the Mu Variant and start production within weeks.",,,,1630653386,{},hbf47u4,False,t3_pgco9t,False,False,t1_hbbjs49,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pgco9t/daily_discussion_thread_september_02_2021/hbf47u4/,1630743097.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_9wimhx4b,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ivmay have just convinced my mom who is trying to convince my dad to get the shot. I am fairly confident that over the last 18 months I have been trying to convince my mom for over 7 actual days of back and forth debate.

Most of the conversation wasn't from me.  It was mom posting, quoting, or citing bullshit blogs, or poorly sourced articles.  So I would spend 75% of the time just trying to keep up with whatever shit she read as billions of doses are administered world wide.   Finally. Last week the FDA approved finally made her crack.  

My mom and dad are (R).   Dad has to fly a lot and travel out of country.  The vaccine isn't required yet where he works, but all signs point to get a shot or you are too expensive to pay for the travel you need to do.  So Dad said  ""Fuck that.  Im going to quit.""  Mom said, ""No you fucking are not."", and that was that.

Mom tells me this, and I ask her why she hasn't gotten it yet if she's going to make dad do it.  She says that she's gonna get it with my Dad.  She's mad that ""everyone is bullying her"" to get the vaccine.  

Honestly I'll just take the W... my mother legit was scared.  She said ""You'll be the first one by my side if I get sick from this shot?"".  I didnt take the bait.  I told her mom you don't have anything to worry about.  I dont know how or why but I wonder if some of these anti vaxxers aren't just deathly afraid of this.

When studied with scientific rigor, Chiropractic practices are shown to either be not helpful or significantly harmful. Just because you go to them and you feel better does not mean that they caused it. It was almost certainly the placebo effect. 

No matter how you slice it, it does not pass anything remotely like scientific merits.

It’s fine if you don’t know how that works, but you need to understand we have a very powerful system for determining things that are true, and things that are false. Thats science. Thats what it does.

Anecdotally, I can say that chiropractic treatment helped me because a few years ago my lower back was hurting and I was feeling numbing in my upper leg. This was more than likely caused from me sitting for long periods of time, how I sat, and the office chair I was sitting in. I went to the chiropractor, and after 3 sessions, the numbing in my leg went away, as well as the pain in my lower back. Haven't had that kind of pain since then.

Also, a coworker of mine was feeling similar pain and numbness, except it was in his shoulder area. He goes to the MD several times and they inject him with muscle relaxers and prescribed him medication that makes him drowsy. It kind of helps the pain but it never truely solved the problem.

[],,CruderCrane5655,,,,,,[],"MLB player pay is so convoluted when you get into the details. Every year, there is a salary cap for all teams MLB. This year (2021), it is $210 million. This is the total amount you can pay all your players. If a team goes over it, they pay a tax (22.5%). If they go over the cap two years in a row, the tax increases(30%). Every year they are over in a row, the tax goes up to a max of 50% by year 4 I believe. So that is the first limiter, and why it is effective. 

Players get signed for contracts. What you hear on ESPN is Babe Ruth Jr. was signed for $15 million over 3 years. Sweet, that's $5 million a year... well not exactly. To stay under the salary cap, the team might make a deal with the player that says Babe Ruth Jr. gets paid $3 million a year for 3 years, and then a million every year after. Thats still pretty good, but less at a time than that $5 million number. I believe the Yankees signed someone for some insane number like $70 million for 5 years but the majority will be paid over time. 

Players also get cool performance bonuses written into their contract. There are obvious team wide deals, like getting into the play offs or World Series. For the better players, they get performance incentives. Say our Babe Ruth Jr. Is the best base stealer in the league. Naturally, in his contract, would be a clause about ""if BRJ steals 20 bases this year, he gets a one time season bonus of $200,000. If BRJ steals 30 bases, he gets the aforementioned $200k and an additional $400k."" Now the excellent players get all sorts of mini clauses for home runs, base hits, batting average, ERA, excellent fielded plays total, and more. 

And lastly, minimum wage for any MLB player in 2021 is 570,000 dollars. Yeah they are all paid extremely well but not how you might think. It's pretty convoluted and there is a high potential for tons more money since those clauses sometimes don't count towards salary caps. I hope this answered your question.

[],,JillandherHills,,,,,,,"Equally offensive? I highly doubt that. 

""Medical doctor"" and ""doctor, holder of a doctorate degree"" are distinctly different. If you search the definition of doctor, there are separate entries for both:

1. a qualified practitioner of medicine; a physician.
2. a person who holds a doctorate.

Claims to etymological arguments aside, phd holders in chemistry will never refer to themselves as medical doctors, and medical doctors with just an MD or DO will never pretend to hold a doctorate degree. Each holds claim to their title but in their respective field. 

Many chiropractors, however, are granted the title of doctor by their degree but present it as if they are medical doctors. Therein lies the offense since people will go to a chiropractor for medical advice and treatment for medical issues when chiropractors are neither trained nor legally qualified to offer either. In ethics, if you have a sham drug and offer that in lieu of an actual treatment it constitutes endangerment. In much the same way, chiropractors allow clients to believe they are receiving medical care when in reality they are not. 

Of course someone is bound to plays devils advocate and say ""they aren't trying to mislead their patients. Maybe they write Dr. on their white coats (and even wear white coats in the first place) and scrubs to indicate their doctorate degree."" But seriously, no. It's simply good for business, and everyone knows that. 

Now don't get me wrong, I have known a wide range of chiropractors and even taught one who was changing careers in medical school. Some are great. Some are respectful of the distinction, but many, many use Dr. to make themselves appear to be medical professionals. If holders of doctorate degrees want to dig into the etymology and complain that the currently defined term of doctor should not apply to us, that's fine. But at least we don't pretend to have qualified for it in ways other than what we have.",,,,1630657362,{},hbf8wq3,False,t3_pgpu4o,False,True,t1_hbf59s0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pgpu4o/florida_school_district_no_longer_accepts_mask/hbf8wq3/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_mzhpzzx,False,False,,False,c4c2a5ceca649c8f4498d3b5e8bfa092b82fd1e4,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1630657375.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

He wouldn't crack my back for fear of making things worse. He mostly just used a tens unit, which worked alright.

On the opposite end of that, I saw another chiropractor after I moved. I went to him based on Google reviews. The first red flag was noticing he was treating children. Then came the consultation. He brought me back into his office &amp; started rattling off about how all of my problems were caused by ""subluxations"". He then handed me a pamphlet covering all of the things that chiropractors can cure. One of them was autism. I'm autistic. I know a lot more about autism than this scammer... like the fact that it's a neurological difference that's hard wired into your brain. There's no ""cure"".

Some chiropractors claim that turning someone's neck around will cure covid, and they'll also sell you unlicensed supplements and rub a healing crystal on your face and no licensing or professional standards board can stop them. 

Then there are other chiropractors who limit their scope of practice to muscular skeletal issues and actually follow the science... But in this case the **best** and most scientifically based chiropractors on earth are basically using the same science as a physical therapist, just without the training and licensing. 

So if you want ""real"" chiropractic care, see a PT or maybe a DO.

*The caveat is that some studies show some benefit to ""cracking"" of the thoracic spine (middle back), using short, gentle but firm pressure on that area. This can apparently improve mobilisation of inflamed joints.

This was something that chiropractors traditionally did. However, because of that evidence, many physiotherapists are now using this type of treatment where appropriate. On the other hand (based on anecdotal ""evidence"" I've seen), chiropractors are now increasingly moving away from doing any cracking of the spine at all. Instead they are using little metal ""hammers"" to tap on back joints. I assume this is because too many chiropractors got sued for breaking people's necks or severing their arteries with harsh manipulation (there are multiple case reports on this kind of injury from all over the world). 

Needless to say, there is no evidence tapping on your spine with a little metal hammer helps anything in any way.

I often walk for 15-20 minutes before work and it really feels like getting out and preparing myself for the day ahead. Since I have flexible hours I sometimes walk more like 1-1.5 hours, but then I am very relaxed and actually able to sit for so long without going crazy. You can probably time it a bit more consistently if it is just your ""walk to work"".

[],,GreunLight,,,,,,,"Endemic and pandemic aren’t exclusionary concepts, fwiw. They aren’t either/or. 

They’re two entirely different things. 

For example, *endemic* disease isn’t necessarily less dangerous or less contagious. It also doesn’t mean “safer.” But it can be. 

Similarly, *epidemic* and *pandemic* disease isn’t determined by virology or even immunity, for that matter. 

Influenza is endemic. We also have seasonal flu epidemics. Occasionally, we also have flu pandemics. Similarly, obesity is practically endemic in the United States. But the disease isn’t contagious, nor is it more or less dangerous simply because it’s common. 

[What is endemic?](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/public-health-now/news/epidemic-endemic-pandemic-what-are-differences)

&gt; **An endemic is a disease outbreak that is consistently present but limited to a particular region. This makes the disease spread and rates predictable.**

&gt; Malaria, for example, is considered an endemic in certain countries and regions.

I mean, simply, 18 months of this sh-t could essentially mean endemic. Doesn’t change the fact that we’re also in the midst of a deadly pandemic. 

[What is a pandemic?](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/public-health-now/news/epidemic-endemic-pandemic-what-are-differences)

&gt; The World Health Organization (WHO) declares a pandemic when a disease’s growth is exponential. This means growth rate skyrockets, and each day cases grow more than the day prior.

&gt; **In being declared a pandemic, the virus has nothing to do with virology, population immunity, or disease severity**. It means a virus covers a wide area, affecting several countries and populations.",,,,1630704039,{},hbhu18l,False,t3_ph0vxq,False,True,t1_hbgs85a,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ph0vxq/three_doses_of_covid19_vaccine_are_likely_needed/hbhu18l/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_bz91eiwq,False,False,,False,589b81c2f8f6d91f1473058ae9fb183065a70d40,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1630704053.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

From 6am on September 6 until 6am on September 21, Directive 16 will continue to be implemented in these areas for at least 15 days.  
  
They are: Tây Hồ, Ba Đình, Cầu Giấy, Hoàn Kiếm, Đống Đa, Hai Bà Trưng, Thanh Xuân, Hà Đông, Thanh Trì and Hoàng Mai.  
  
Sections of five other areas on the outskirts of the capital, Nam Từ Liêm, Bắc Từ Liêm, Hoài Đức, Thanh Oai and Thường Tín, have also been classified as red zones, or Zone 1.  
  
These are deemed to be high risk locations and urban areas with high population density and concentrated with agencies, businesses and services establishments.    
  
People living in red zones must follow Directive 16, which means no gatherings of more than two people in public and asks people to only leave home for emergencies, buying food and medicine, and working in factories, production facilities and businesses that involve ""essential"" goods and services.  
  
Regulations could be tightened depending on future scenarios.  
  
Meanwhile, Zone 2 areas are made up of five other districts which are classified as orange and green zones.  
  
They include Long Biên, Gia Lâm, Đông Anh, Sóc Sơn and Mê Linh districts.  
  
Zone 2 will be separated with Zone 1 by the Hồng and Đuống rivers and will promote safe production to facilitate industrial zones’ operation.  
  
Those living in areas designated green or orange will at the very least be required to adhere to Directive 15 which requires suspension of social events, bans gatherings of 20 people or more in one place and of 10 people or more outside workplaces, schools and hospitals. A minimum distance of two meters between people in public places should be ensured.  
  
Directive 15 rules may be tightened, depending on individual circumstances of particular zones.  
  
Zone 2 areas will be divided into smaller sections to ensure smooth operation of big industrial zones. In areas with industrial facilities, residents are asked to implement the “three on-site model”, meaning people in those areas must eat, sleep, and work without leaving the zone to keep production going while ensuring COVID-19 control and prevention measures are met.  
  
Zone 3 will be for areas housing agricultural production companies and industrial zones. Parts of this zone can include urban areas, but only those with a low population density.  
  
They include the whole administrative boundary of 10 districts: Ba Vì, Sơn Tây, Phúc Thọ, Đan Phượng, Thạch Thất, Quốc Oai, Chương Mỹ, Ứng Hòa, Mỹ Đức, Phú Xuyên and parts of five other districts which are classified as Zone 1, Nam Từ Liêm, Bắc Từ Liêm, Hoài Đức, Thanh Oai and Thường Tín.   
  
Hà Nội authorities have unveiled an online Hanoi COVID-19 Epidemiological Information Map to help people easily search and detect problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic around their areas or at any locations in the capital city.

I would love to know what you think the problems with virtual are that can be solved. Virtual learning is different across the board depending on the grade. My son started kindergarten last year and it just wasnt something that would work. Kids that age struggle to learn via zoom calls, and all elementary students do as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Those older struggle as well, and you can see the results in the state testing, scores in reading/math/science dropped by sometimes HALF since 2019 in my state alone ([https://www.doe.virginia.gov/statistics\_reports/sol-pass-rates/index.shtml](https://www.doe.virginia.gov/statistics_reports/sol-pass-rates/index.shtml)). Virtual does not work.

&amp;#x200B;

There are ways to make in person possible and safe. Several schools in my area have masks policies and plexi glass set up between seats. Students also dont move rooms often and the teachers are the ones that move around, so the students have less interaction. None of these schools have had a covid case this school year (they opened mid august) or last year.

&gt; **But the emphasis remains on increasing vaccination rates among the US population to help overcome the pandemic.** 

See what I mean? The reporting isn’t the problem. Context matters. 

Further,

&gt; The risk of Covid-19 spread at schools and campuses remains critical, and recent research demonstrates how unmasked behavior among the unvaccinated can lead to outbreaks.

&gt; A study published Thursday described a Covid-19 outbreak among more than 150 students at a Chicago university after many unvaccinated students traveled during spring break, despite university policies that advised against it.

&gt; To prevent similar outbreaks, some universities have instituted mandates to attend classes in-person.

&gt; Virginia Tech disenrolled 134 students for failing to comply with the university's requirement that students be fully vaccinated against Covid-19, and ""did not submit vaccination documentation or receive a medical or religious exemption,"" according to a statement on Monday.

&gt; The University of Virginia has also disenrolled more than 200 students for failing to comply with their vaccine mandate, according to a statement last month.
Vaccinations in teens and adults can not only stave off infections at schools but can also protect children under 12 who are ineligible for the vaccine.

&gt; ""**Communities with high vaccination coverage are seeing lower pediatric cases and hospitalizations**,"" CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said.

&gt; **Along with vaccinations, mask-wearing is also beneficial to curbing Covid-19 spread**, evidence shows.

&gt; The state of New York will require weekly Covid-19 testing for teachers and other school employees, with an opt-out for those who are vaccinated, and will continue their mask mandate for everybody in a school building, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced Thursday.

&gt; In Florida, districts will be able to institute mask mandates following a judge signing a written order Thursday that ruled against Gov. Ron DeSantis' ban on such mandates in schools. DeSantis said he will appeal.

[],,heliumneon,,,,,,[],"Short answer: yes, the vaccines work, still extremely well against hospitalization and death, but less well against moderate sickness from delta than the original Covid Classic virus. And delta variant is what's going around now in most countries (e.g. 98% of US cases).

So vaccine effectiveness is no longer the 95% that most people planned their lives and a lot of policy decisions around (which is the vaccine Phase 3 trial results from last year), but instead, against delta variant, more like 80% against getting minor to moderately sick (maybe 90-95% against hospitalization/death). Furthermore, there is a gradual erosion of effectiveness as the body's immune response wears off over a long term, like ~12 months. Where to draw the line and give people a booster shot is an open question (6 months? 8 months? etc.).

The other thing that was previously assumed was that fully vaccinated people who got a breakthrough positive Covid case were probably going to be less infectious than an unvaccinated person who got Covid. Now there were some measurements that suggest breakthrough cases can be as infectious as unvaccinated cases.

So we’ll just agree they’re still at least 40% effective at preventing infection, meaning [unvaccinated folks](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02261-8) are at least ~2.5x to ~5x [**more likely** to become infected with sars-cov-2](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2108891) than folks who have had [both doses.](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0806-vaccination-protection.html)

The hardest part for me is that he's not dumb. He's wildly mislead by social media, living in some filter-bubble that's downplaying everything about the pandemic. His whole world view is carefully shaped by algorithms designed to re-enforce that view. Everything he sees and reads is about how much the pandemic is overblown, how much the media is scare-mongering, how small the threat actually is, how the ICUs aren't really full, how doctors are profiteering by inflating the COVID19 numbers.

I want to raise awareness of this Phase 3 clinical trial for mild/moderate COVID-19 since more enrollments are needed. Bucillamine is a promising repurposed rheumatoid arthritis pill with a 30+ year safety history from its widespread use in South Korea and Japan.

If you or someone you know has COVID with mild/moderate symptoms and are not vaccinated, check to see if one of the study locations is close to you. Most of the locations can be called to confirm they are still looking for new patients in the trial.

Here is the scientific rationale for using Bucillamine to treat COVID:

1. Bucillamine and its metabolites [have anti-inflammatory properties](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8440072/) that calm B-Cells and suppress cytokine signaling.

2. Bucillamine [helps generate glutathione](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16806086/) which is [necessary to prevent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC7263077/) the worst outcomes of infection.

3. Bucillamine is [confirmed to inhibit](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33330868/) the spike protein of COVID-19, thus blocking viral cell-entry.

4. As a thiol-based drug more potent than N-Acetylcysteine, Bucillamine is [thought to inhibit](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/ars.2020.8247) the RdRp of COVID-19, thus interfering with viral replication.

While all these mechanisms are promising, the trial is still ongoing.

1.	SARS-CoV-2 is much more easily spread than the flu 
2.	The virus is more deadly than the flu, not Ebola deadly but many times more deadly
3.	Even if you don’t die, there’s a high chance of hospitalization. That risks overwhelming the healthcare system and then everyone starts dying of things that were previously manageable. With delta people are staying in the ICU for like 55 days compared with 7-15 days with alpha. That makes it worse. 
4.	A large number of people do not get symptoms but are still infectious. This is different than flu also, and is part of why COVID spreads so fast, people literally don’t know they’re sick and nobody can tell by looking.

They gave me an mri and sent me to physical therapy. After a month and a half I noticed my back and leg hadn't got any better and possibly was worse. I stopped going to physical therapy and my sister and my doctor asked if I had tried a chiropractor so I went (this last April). He cracked my back in 3 seconds and told me it may take a couple weeks to heal and to come in a that friday and the next couple of mondays and fridays. I went back that Friday and he asked me to take off my mask itll only be a minute, I reluctantly did, got cracked again and on my way.  Following Monday I get a call from the office saying they were closed for an emergency and didnt follow up that friday either because I was busy with work. I had also made am appointment as a last resort to get back injections the following week but just 2 days before my injections my back and leg pain miraculously started getting better and I canceled my injections. It's now been all summer and no issues. I was dealing with unimaginable pain that kept me up for nights all winter and this dude cracked me and I was better.

A couple months later I decide to open some old mail from the chiropractor  office and it was a letter explaining how the chiropractor died (covid) and his last day in office was the day he last fixed my back, he died like a week later.

However, it's pretty strange to me to hear about chiropractors and physical therapists coexisting. My father-in-law is a chiropractor and I have several friends that are physical therapists. What I gather from talking to them is that chiropractors and physical therapists don't really respect each other. My FIL has kind of a holier than thou vibe when talking about PT's and my PT friends think chiropractic is BS.

After spending a good amount of time with people in both worlds, I wholeheartedly agree with PT's. The whole business model of chiropractic is basically this. ""Adjust"" people so they a very temporary feeling of relief, knowing that you aren't actually fixing anything so you can sell them on the importance of regular chiropractic visits. ""Doctor, I saw you two days ago and my neck already feels bad again.""  ""Well that's because your neck was so out of alignment that you'll need to come in 2-3 days a week. Eventually it'll get better. But then you'll also need to continue coming in for preventative adjustments twice a month. Also if you buy all of these supplements that I'm selling at the front desk you'll become a super hero.""

The good ones normalized basic therapies that are now mainstream like ultrasonic therapy, therapeutic massage, and orthotics. (Pillows, shoe inserts.)

I wonder what kind of regulation they have for their schools?

A chiropractor will manipulate you, often without much history taking or evaluation and send you in your way. A Physical therapist will take a thorough history, examination, and evaluation and treat you based on the pathology or deficiency they find. PTs can absolutely do what a chiropractor can, Chiropractors cannot do what a PT can. Our practice acts even back that up.

A PT can treat and manage conditions affecting the Neuromuscular, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, pulmonary, integumentary (skin), and cognitive systems. A chiropractor can treat conditions relating to the spine, intentionally broad but in essence back crackers. 

Now I won’t say all chiropractors are bad and all PTs are good, but in general a chiropractor will manipulate you and send you out the door. They do nothing to treat or diagnose underlying conditions. In fact chiropractors are not formally trained in therapeutic exercise and will do nothing to address the underlying musculoskeletal origin of pathologies.

I suggest reading what is on the CDCs website before going to the doctor, and even perhaps visiting the websites of health authorities in other regions to get some comparative information.

The only reason you could want your child for health related reasons is to avoid negative health conditions, so I assumed that was what you were saying. Unless you’re saying that parents with genetic conditions want to pass down their genetic diseases and that’s a justification for having children. 

The biological “tie” is not a justification, it’s a reason. And blood is also not as powerful as people claim it is. If you swapped a child at birth and allowed both the child and the parents to believe they are related, it has no impact on how much they should be able to care for each other. And it is certainly not “valuable to the child” which you claim I ignore. The child doesn’t exist until you created it. It’s not valuable to them. It’s like saying “it’s not selfish to have a child because they’ll be hungry and I’ll feed them.”

If you mean it’s valuable to the children up for adoption their blood bond, I can at least kind of understand you. But you then going ahead and just make your own child will not help them in any way. The only way to help them is to adopt them. 

I’d say your arguments aren’t grounded in logic but fantasy. Without spirituality and religion the things that you say is has no basis. 

Maybe you should open your mind up. You have no idea how much I wish to be wrong, but it is simply a selfish act to bring a child into this world.

Chiropractic is great for what its actually great for, working bone structure back into alignment so that you feel better and can work on better posture, which can improve many other aspects of the way you feel.  
  
That being said, of the literal hundreds I worked with via equipment sales and service there were only about a dozen I'd let work on me. I don't think chiropractic is inherently dangerous by any means, no more than many medications we take on a daily basis, but you certainly have to know who you're dealing with which can be hard before your first patient visit.  
  
I've had a chiro unfreeze my neck. I've had them help level my hips which took immense daily pain out of my mid back. But if a doctor I was seeing (or even selling equipment to) was writing mask exemption notes that would be the end of our relationship.  
  
Too many of them give the profession a bad name, but I don't think I've ever met a chiro just out there killin' people for sport. I've had my friends who are chiros and I fall out over vaccine science. I've had others outright scoff at people for refusing basic vaccines and watched them explain why they're safe and effective.

Breastfeeding is the best thing you can do for your little one, with or without the vaccine. With the vaccine, it has been shown to pass along antibodies. Breastmilk works this way with other sicknesses, too. Keep breastfeeding until at least 1. 

You can get a 6 month old vaccinated for the flu and they appear to be out now.

Make sure that you are getting enough vitamin D. Spending time in the sun is the best way, but you can take a supplement or give drops to your baby. 

If you want, you can consider babywearing versus a carseat or stroller. People are way less likely to touch your baby or be up in her face without being up in your face. It has worked very well for me.

I’m not a scientist, but my understanding is that age (being young but not 0-4) is highly protective, and you are pretty far on the young side of the spectrum there. Vaccines are also highly protective against a severe case or hospitalization. Absolutely no one has a zero risk, but you have two major factors on your side. 

Or looking at Oklahoma’s data for the past 30 days on page 10, just 4 fully vaccinated people between 18-35 were hospitalized for COVID in their state. And that doesn’t necessarily mean ICU, let alone a ventilator or death. Again, there are no guarantees, but I would guess that at least a couple of them have worse underlying conditions than you have. 

I suggest you (like everyone) should exercise reasonable caution.

We live in SC, and he goes to a school without any mask mandates.

And my son was masked the whole time, which we all know only provides a base level of protection. He is unable to get vaccinated, he’s only 8. 

His exposure happened on Friday August 27, and we were notified Wednesday September 1. He was at school the 30,31 and 1st- although only half a day because I literally had to leave work to go pick him up from school after finding out a classmate tested positive. 
There is no way they can stop the spread with this type of system. There’s no system. Just send your kids to school and hope and pray they don’t get covid, meanwhile when they do get covid they’re still potentially spreading it for days. 

The school nurse told me that they aren’t even reporting things directly to SC DHEC anymore, they report to the district and I guess the school district then shares info with the health department. I have no idea.

They aren't that vaccinated.

They've given a lot more doses in the last month, both boosters and first doses to younger people, but those will take time to have an effect.

Their cases have risen so quickly it's unclear what their CFR is.  In the UK this is under 0.2%, because they have 95% adult seropositivity along with a similar low immunity rate in under-18s.  In the US it's 1-2%, because we have many times more seronegative vulnerable people, more vaccinations among 12-17s, and less testing.  But Israel cases have risen too quickly to guess.

Israel gave everyone their second pfizer dose at exactly 3 weeks, which is possible to simply give a bad result and require a later booster.  This is unlike the US, where many doses were at 4+ weeks, or the UK where they were all at 8-12 weeks (far superior).  They are giving those boosters now.

1. I mean you really have to be willfully ignorant to science, or just not give a shit to have classes run in person still.

2. They want to continue traditional schooling because they are terrified that we will figure out a better way to educate our kids and therefore not have a ignorant. population (which they want)

3. When you get rid of traditional ideologies, you start to break a lot of other barriers like...work from home (which companies seem to HATE even though there are studies that provide a positive correlation to mental health, work productivity, and the environment).

Honestly, I think all this has to do with refusing to change in order to keep a stagnant population. We are literally working against ourselves here...it makes no sense right? But the issue is these people aren't that dumb, they KNOW what they are doing. And if they really are that dumb, then we have a bigger issue..either way, it requires a change that they are unwilling to do. So better hold on to our ""tradition"" of industrialized schooling system to teach kids not rhetoric, but that they need to work 8 hours a day 5 days a week and expect to do work on their down time as well.

[],,RiverFriend,,,,,,[],"I consider myself a centrist (no party) and agree with you on the need for transparency and releasing backup documentation and/or stats with this data. Covid is very real and deadly, but you're right about the fear factor. That's what drives high ratings for 24 hour news, fuels division and anger on social media, etc.  

As an example, my 4th grader was exposed to 4 positive kids last week. Is now quarantined until Tuesday.  The school did a weak job of giving us information other than someone in his class tested positive. And the letters that go out to the parents of the entire school don't even mention positive cases on campus.  That gets brushed over with them patting themselves on the back about implementing new safety measures, while they were openly against these same measures just weeks ago. I would appreciate a transparent weekly letter from the school breaking down the number of positive students by class, total students out positive, total quarantined, number asymptomatic, number sick, and number in hospital.

I think by doing nothing the school believes they are helping to avoid fear/panic, but in my little life experience, I feel it's best to give people real transparent information to do with as they will.  Personally, my active imagination and anxiety can scare me more without actual facts and data.

Anyway, glad to see you're on board with Vax and masks, beyond that we're just all trying to do our best and not sure why you were down voted heavily.

Now, with a more contagious variant going around, and with *all* of our kids returning for face-to-face classes, the school has relaxed their rules around cleaning. Disinfecting once per week is good enough, they say.   


I feel like there's a huge sense of futility among staff. Even if they clean and sanitize constantly, masks come off for snack time and lunch, and kids are only required to be about 3 feet apart. And then you have the masks kids wear, which are often just little, loosely-fitted cotton masks, rather than surgical masks.   


It seems inevitable that school will be forced to shut down within the first month of school, and hourly staff get no pay if school shuts down, so many are looking toward other industries.

That said, it was relatively small spread considering the conditions, and it is the worst case scenario. Real world spread would be harder to sustain when you literally aren't sleeping on top of each other. 

I do believe boosters will make a massive difference. Many highly contagious diseases require three doses to mute infection for a decent period of time, and even then may require boosters every 5 years or so. Pragmatically I think we will have a 6 month booster, and then annual boosters for a couple of years while the world is still dealing with COVID as a novel disease, and then switch to a 5 year schedule except potentially for the elderly or high risk. SARS-CoV-2's ability to mutate is much more limited than than the family of flu viruses so annual shots may not be required like for the flu.

Alternatively, it is also possible that after the initial set of mRNA vaccines, in a few years an inactivated COVID virus will be added to the annual flu shot.

Priorizing the production and acquisition of more of these vaccines seems to be the most sensible approach. While many people in the general public would prefer a traditional vaccine, in many places in the world that is only a tiny sliver of the population. In Canada we have something like 80%+ of the eligible population willing to take this vaccine. In my province, it's nearing 85%. I don't imagine that even the majority of the remaining 15% are going to be swayed with a less efficacious vaccine. Maybe a few, but the big holdouts are much more stubborn than that.

In the end, even without children yet being eligible, the value of having the entire population utilizing a highlight effective vaccine can't be discounted. China, with their billions of the traditional vaccine, are feeling the pressure to augment those with some of the shiny and new. 

The value proposition is just too low. Time and effort, to convince a few percentage of the population to take a less effective vaccine.

[],,imoutofnameideas,,,,,,[],"I don't doubt you honestly believe that chiropractic helped you. And, to give it the benefit of the doubt, maybe it did. 

However, most injuries they claim to treat (and indeed most minor injuries in general) tend to be self resolving. In other words, whether you go to a chiropractor, a physio, a doctor or your local witch doctor, chances are whatever you had may have resolved by itself.

So it's hard to know what was the effect of the treatment and what was the effect of your body's natural healing mechanisms. 

In addition, any sort of ""medical"" treatment - including genuine, evidence based, scientifically backed treatment, as well as utter quackery - has a placebo effect. The clinical setting, the reassuring words of the practitioner, even simple things like the wearing of a lab coat - all of these things have been shown to improve *perceived* outcomes for patients.

So unfortunately, with all these confounding factors, a story like ""well, it helped me"" tells us absolutely nothing about whether it is a useful or warranted intervention. I'm not saying it didn't help you, I'm just saying that there are ways it might have helped you that have nothing to do with what the chiropractor actually did.

[],,NashvilleHot,,,,,,[],"A few other things to consider: 

1.	Relative risk— with delta, you are not going to be able to avoid it forever. Which carries higher risk of bad outcomes? Vaccination? Or COVID? 
2.	One way to think about the risks: more than 2 BILLION people and 5 BILLION doses have been administered worldwide of all the different vaccines. How many have had issues much less died? Nearly none. 220M COVID cases worldwide. 4.56 MILLION deaths. Probably 10-20x of that with lasting effects and organ damage. 
3.	96%+ of doctors in the US are vaccinated. 
4.	Almost all politicians are vaccinated. Even the ones that push anti-vax stuff. The ones that didn’t get vaccinated are sick or dead. 
5.	Almost everyone in the Provincetown outbreak were vaccinated. This was as perfect an environment for transmission as you can get, lots of very crowded indoors events, no masks. But only 7 hospitalized and no deaths among the vaccinated out of 1,000 known cases and 60,000+ attendees. If nobody was vaccinated, we would have seen at least 10-20 deaths with dozens if not hundreds in the hospital. 

In my opinion, the overwhelming evidence is that vaccines are safe, they work amazingly well for preventing death and hospitalization (and even infection, which vaccines were never designed to prevent).

[],,Dougmw1337,,,,,,[],"Since I see this getting politicized, I will throw some information out there. This drug has enough evidence that it helps that any high risk person should call their doctor at the first suspicion they may have covid. The reason is that in the clinical trials, the earlier a person was given this treatment, the better their outcome and the less chance of hospitalization. By the time a person was already hospitalized, it was already too late for the Monoclonal antibodies to have any positive effect. My parents both got covid before the vaccine was available and I believe getting this infusion significantly helped them both. They were very high risk and turned the corner a few hours after their infusion. It was very difficult to go through the tests and approvals in time and the infusion took hours. If they didn't start the process the moment they got symptoms, it would have been too late, so you have to be very proactive and an be an excellent health care advocate for yourself.

I am not sure if this treatment will help a vaccinated person. I have not seen any studies and it's possible there are none yet. Given the difficulty of getting approved and doing the infusion, I would assume your doctor would only recommend it if you were at extreme risk or immunocompromised. Though I am not a doctor, I know there is just no way a person would go to all that trouble to get this treatment at the first hint of sickness when they were expecting mild disease, as most vaccinated are. If you are vaccinated, if there is any question in your mind how you will fare, call your doctor.

This particular subreddit has a number of 'flairs' to guide the reader to particular geographical areas or subjects. 'USA' accounts for the majority of the items. España would fall under 'Europe', the second most common flair. Much of the scientific items end up being published in English including those en España. That's the world we live in. I believe it is a great failing. For myself I post (elsewhere) items in French, Spanish and German with the translation of the title in the comments. In the case of Russian or Ukrainian, and very occasionally Greek, I will post the full translation. Translation takes time - time that I don't have. All of this will be political rather than scientific. If you are particularly interested in matters relevant to say Spain, I would suggest filtering for the tag 'Europe' even though a lot of the 'USA' items have global implications.

**The inmates' comments contradict assertions by the sheriff and the jail's physician that the use of the drug was voluntary.** The drug's use at the jail has prompted an investigation by the state Medical Board.   

**The drug's manufacturer, Merck, said in February that it had found no evidence that ivermectin is an effective treatment for patients with COVID-19.**

The American Medical Association, the American Pharmacists Association and the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists on Wednesday called for an immediate end to prescribing and using the drug to treat the coronavirus outside clinical trials.

Washington County Sheriff Tim Helder, a spokesperson for his office and jail physician Dr. Rob Karas did not respond to calls or emails on Wednesday. Karas last week released a lengthy statement defending the use of ivermectin, saying he had been prescribing the drug to inmates and patients at his clinics since late last year.

Edrick Floreal-Wooten, an inmate, said he was given ivermectin at the jail after he tested positive on Aug. 21.

""I asked what are they, and they'd just tell me vitamins,"" Floreal-Wooten said. ""With me being sick and all of us being sick, we thought that they were there to help us. I never thought they would do something shady.""

Floreal-Wooten said he refused to take the drug last week after seeing a news article about ivermectin being prescribed to inmates.

Asked whether he would have taken the drug had they told him at the outset it was ivermectin, he responded: ""Never. I'm not livestock. I'm a human.""

When I went searching for data I wasn't sure if I'd see a marked increase in mortality.  According to https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm, it appears that over the timespan of May, June, July and August a total of 83 children aged 0-17 have died from Covid out of almost 10,000 from all causes.  83 deaths is fewer than the number of children who died from pneumonia during that timeframe.

It goes without saying that any children deaths are bad.

Should the government give parents enough of a stipend, or subsidize childcare so that parents don't have to shoulder that burden alone especially now? I think so. Before you tell me we shouldn't expect something that like that, why not? Other weathy countries do it and have increased support for families during the pandemic. You can read more about it [here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/hechingerreport.org/how-7-countries-are-supporting-child-care-and-families-during-the-pandemic/)

The point I was getting at is this: 

For the kids, is the risk worth it? Are there ways that make the most of the risk/benifit ratio? Do we put the rest of the healthcare system at risk by starting school back without doing the utmost to prevent spread? What about kids long term non-fatal health impacts? Should having kids go half time (ie half of the school population in the am, half in the pm, no meals on site, take home only) make a huge positive impact on limiting transmition?

[],,DiabolicallyRandom,,,,,,,"&gt;By the book,

There is no ""book"" that says chiro's have to be quacks.

The good ones are just highly skilled ""massage therapists"" IMO. Some musculoskeletal adjustment can be helpful and good for the body (See Osteopathy Doctors for example).

Most formalized Osteopathic training, especially bodies who certify such doctors, have done away with the classical quackery associated with it.

&gt;n the United States the training of osteopathic physicians is similar to that of Doctor of Medicine (MD) physicians.[10][11] Osteopathic manipulation is still included in the curricula of osteopathic physicians and is considered a unique aspect of Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) training. In the United States, graduates of osteopathic medical schools have the option to sit for both the osteopathic physician-specific COMLEX medical licensing exam and the allopathic USMLE licensing exam.

Just for reference.

So... musculoskeletal manipulation is still accepted as valid medical treatments.

But unfortunately, Chiropractics has just hung on to the quackery of it too.

One example is muscle cramps. It was a chiropractor who told me 27-ish years ago that muscle fibers need magnesium to function correctly so if I'm having those painful leg cramps I may want to be sure that I am not deficient as it is a common one. Last year I had a major abdominal surgery and as the anesthesia wore off the biggest discomfort was my back cramping up like crazy. I had no idea to expect that, but simply begged for a heating pad (which is another trick I learned ages ago and use all the time for my neck.) The doc approved - back only - and the next morning told me he was going to add it to his normal routine. Nice. How did he not already know that?? Haha. Damn, he does these weekly, and he's old and celebrated in his peer community. (He had also not bothered to test my iron so I was dangerously low prior to surgery.) In the meantime the nurse practitioner on the floor heard my comment and had them draw labs - and then ordered a potassium/magnesium infusion because I was low and that was the potential cause of my back cramps.

If you're worried about *safety* effects cropping up at some undefined point in the future, you should know that no vaccine of any type has had adverse effects show up more than six weeks after administration.

If you're worried specifically about the mRNA type vaccines, keep in mind that the mRNA itself disintegrates and goes away after a couple of days. There's nothing in the vaccine that hangs around in your body which could have a mechanism to cause damage later on. (And ""never been tested?"" Kaiser was recruiting participants for the Moderna clinical trials around where I live in March of 2020. They got their first shots almost a year and a half ago!)

If you're worried that the vaccine might not be *effective* after three years.... Scientists are still uncertain about that, but the worst-case scenario is that we'll just need annual COVID shots to get with our annual flu shots.

But you should keep in mind that the virus is endemic at this point. You're either going to get vaccinated and get some immunity that way, or eventually get a natural infection and run the risk of severe COVID and/or long COVID. Getting the vaccine actually gives you more control of the situation!

For some sources which are more reputable than my anonymous random Redditor self:

This Week in Virology has a great [interview with Dr. Paul Offit](https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/twiv-720/) from February about vaccine safety. Offit worked on a vaccine against Rotavirus and has spent a couple of decades studying and writing about vaccines in general. (Side note: the show host, Vincent Racaniello, has done several AMAs on this sub, [including this one from the other day](/r/Coronavirus/comments/pfa3va/im_dr_vincent_racaniello_a_virology_professor_at/).)

The CDC has a [good writeup](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/concerns-history.html) of both known and suspected vaccine safety issues.

If you're okay with somewhat more technical reading, [this post](https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/might-go-wrong) by the medicinal chemist Derek Lowe from June of 2020 goes into great detail about what might reasonably have gone wrong with a vaccine or antibody drug. (He hasn't developed a vaccine, but he's worked in other areas of drug development for a couple of decades.)

That's a great way of putting it. It's like the original efficacy of 95% was immediately assumed to be equal to 100% for so many people (""do whatever you want!""). And now that it's like 80% the same people scream WTF IT DOESN'T EVEN WORK! A lot of confusion out there. And there's worry because cases are now way up -- delta is about 2x more infectious than original Covid, so mitigation that used to work before is not holding back infections as well.

&gt; Any advice for reliable/not alarmist sources of news and info?

It's hard to say, usual good journalistic sources are usually good in general (NY Times, etc.). Though a lot of information goes out of date quickly. If anything is on the news portions of these sites https://www.science.org/news or https://www.nature.com/news (Science magazine and Nature, the top 2 science journals in the world), it's about as evidence based as you can get.

The reason that 70%-90% is thrown around for vaccination is that if you reach that level the virus cannot really spread, i.e. ""herd immunity"".

Background: Mask usage remains low across many parts of the world during the COVID19 pandemic, and strategies to increase mask-wearing remain untested. Our objectives were  
to identify strategies that can persistently increase mask-wearing and assess the impact of  
increasing mask-wearing on symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections.  


Methods: We conducted a cluster-randomized trial of community-level mask promotion in  
rural Bangladesh from November 2020 to April 2021 (N=600 villages, N=342,126 adults).  
We cross-randomized mask promotion strategies at the village and household level, including  
cloth vs. surgical masks. All intervention arms received free masks, information on the importance of masking, role modeling by community leaders, and in-person reminders for 8 weeks.  
The control group did not receive any interventions. Neither participants nor field staff were  
blinded to intervention assignment. Outcomes included symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence (primary) and prevalence of proper mask-wearing, physical distancing, and symptoms  
consistent with COVID-19 (secondary). Mask-wearing and physical distancing were assessed  
through direct observation at least weekly at mosques, markets, the main entrance roads to  
villages, and tea stalls. At 5 and 9 weeks follow-up, we surveyed all reachable participants  
about COVID-related symptoms. Blood samples collected at 10-12 weeks of follow-up for  
symptomatic individuals were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies.  


Results: There were 178,288 individuals in the intervention group and 163,838 individuals  
in the control group. The intervention increased proper mask-wearing from 13.3% in control  
villages (N=806,547 observations) to 42.3% in treatment villages (N=797,715 observations)  
(adjusted percentage point difference = 0.29 \[0.27, 0.31\]). This tripling of mask usage was sustained during the intervention period and two weeks after. Physical distancing increased from  
24.1% in control villages to 29.2% in treatment villages (adjusted percentage point difference  
= 0.05 \[0.04, 0.06\]). After 5 months, the impact of the intervention faded, but mask-wearing  
remained 10 percentage points higher in the intervention group.  
The proportion of individuals with COVID-like symptoms was 7.62% (N=13,273) in the  
intervention arm and 8.62% (N=13,893) in the control arm. Blood samples were collected  
from N=10,952 consenting, symptomatic individuals. Adjusting for baseline covariates, the  
2  
intervention reduced symptomatic seroprevalence by 9.3% (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) =  
0.91 \[0.82, 1.00\]; control prevalence 0.76%; treatment prevalence 0.68%). In villages randomized to surgical masks (n = 200), the relative reduction was 11.2% overall (aPR = 0.89 \[0.78,  
1.00\]) and 34.7% among individuals 60+ (aPR = 0.65 \[0.46, 0.85\]). No adverse events were  
reported.  


Conclusions: Our intervention demonstrates a scalable and effective method to promote mask  
adoption and reduce symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections",,,,1630672246,{},hbft5wf,True,t3_ph466j,False,True,t3_ph466j,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ph466j/the_impact_of_community_masking_on_covid19_a/hbft5wf/,1630755194.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_67vr4xq3,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Covid will never disappear and even if we stopped transmission there are many animal reservoirs for this virus so it will keep mutating forever.  The key is to force the virus to become an endemic disease that is generally mild.  There is no evolutionary pressure for the virus to become more deadly.  So you will need to tell me what your plan and end game is because if we say we need to keep extreme measures in place because of mutations than you are effectively saying that kids should never go to school again and we should take them out of all in-person social activities forever.

Again, because people are behaving as if this is over when it’s not. I’m not sure what you don’t understand about this point? Just because people’s behavior is one of normality doesn’t change that Delta is spreading at the same rate as Alpha was in Dec ‘20. The 7 day average for the UK is about 34k cases. **That’s not normal.** 

&gt;	ICUs are not full, ERs are not full, people are not dying at a high rate like in the US

I imagine this is because there’s a higher vaccination rate per capita in the UK than the US. Again, vaccination (or natural immunity) will give you a level of immunity that prevents hospitalization and death. In the US, it’s something like 80-90% of the hospitalizations and deaths are unvaccinated people.

&gt;	so the US has 11X the death rate of UK, but only 5X the population.

See above point. Also, adjust per capita and you have similar numbers, so again, **not normal**.

[COVID-19 cases and deaths per million in 203 countries as of September 3, 2021](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/) 

&gt;	UK Deaths total (per million): 1,983.95

&gt;	US Deaths total (per million): 1,951.55

&gt;	UK Deaths (per million last 7 days): 10.11

&gt;	US Deaths (per million last 7 days): 20.96

So, per capita, the UK is actually worse than the US in terms of total deaths and the US is only about double the UK per capita the last 7 days. Not 11x the death rate you claim.

However, keep in mind that even the pandemic plans that we *did* have (from both the GWB and Obama administrations for pandemic flu) weren't keen on mass PPE for all. The CDC still has those plans archived [here](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/planning-preparedness/national-strategy-planning.html). From the 2006 ""Pandemic Influenza Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Guide for Critical Infrastructure and Key Resources"", this is the *only* mention of masks in the entire document:

&gt; Although officials have not documented the efficacy of surgical/procedure masks or N95 respirators, workers may wear one as part of an individual protection strategies.

&gt; Even with proper PPE and training, and employing all other appropriate infection control procedures, symptomatic workers should only be allowed in the workplace under the most extreme circumstances to sustain essential business continuity.

The HHS updates from 2006 and 2009 mention that the government had bought millions of N95 and surgical masks in a stockpile along with plastic face shields, gowns, gloves, and respirators; in context it looks like they were only intended for healthcare workers.

The HHS update from 2017 doesn't mention masks at all, not even in their list of NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions):

&gt; NPIs that all people should practice at all times are particularly important during a pandemic. These everyday preventive actions include staying home when sick, covering coughs and sneezes, frequent and appropriate hand-washing, and routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces. Community-level interventions can be added during pandemics and implemented in a graded fashion depending on the severity of the pandemic; these include measures aimed to reduce social contacts between people in schools, workplaces, and other community settings.

(What I'm not able to find right now is the pre-2020 pandemic plan document which flat-out stated that the general public should not use N95 masks; that may have been from the WHO.)

I remember people frantically searching for studies of mask effectiveness around March/April 2020 and there wasn't much of anything in the literature.

[],,chocoholicsoxfan,,,,,,[],"You can't unilaterally say that COVID is worse than the flu. The structure of the influenza virus makes it highly suspectible to antigenic shift and drift. Each year, there's a new strain of the influenza virus that has essentially a clean slate of naive hosts, and it can burn through all of them, killing dozens to hundreds of kids year over year.


Meanwhile, SARS-CoV-2 is a more stable virus. Yes, it has spouted some variants, but the integrity of this specific virus is largely maintained season over season, and exposure to the virus confers longer lasting/more durable protection against future infection. It has a bunch of naive hosts to burn through, but then there will be some level of sustained immunity. We don't see this with the flu. For this reason, one would expect higher morbidity/mortality initially, but then it would come to a steep drop off once more kids have some level of immunity. And yet, despite that, the rate of death isn't particularly higher than the flu. This is all an apples to oranges comparison though because you're comparing just one subtype of a species of coronavirus (SARS) to an entire species of influenza viruses, which mutate every year. A more apt comparison would be comparing one strain to one strain, so SARS-COV-2 to H1N1, as an example. Although it's hard to draw a true comparison since they're completely different classes.

Every decision you make in life is a balance between your need to live your life and potential risks to your life.  A child is more than tens times likely to die by auto accident or a firearm then they are to die of Covid.  Do you claim that a parent who drives in a car with their children must care very little about them?  

326 school aged children (5-18) have died of Covid over the entire course of the pandemic.  Given that the pandemic is now 21 months old, that is an annual death rate of 186 school aged children.  Flu kills on average between 37-199 children per year.  The 2009 flu season killed 358 kids in less than a year.  According to your logic, parents have been irresponsible for sending their kids to school forever because some will die of a disease.  

I don't like the current situation and I would like to see options for kids until the vaccine is approved for them, but these extreme attitudes that are not based in reality are not at all helpful to the situation.  And I love how you think you are the worlds leading expert in education and can just snap your fingers and fix all problems with virtual learning.

[],,michaelthecoder,,,,,,,"From what we know, it seems that Delta response pretty well to vaccines and the breakthrough cases are less about the vaccine not being tailored specifically to Delta and more that antibodies have either faded or weren't high enough in the first place. The vaccines do still help with B and T cells that help protect against hospitalization and death, but my understanding is that they are slow while Delta is fast, so they don't protect much at all against infection, protect somewhat but not perfectly against hospitalization, and protect a lot against death.

Tailoring a vaccine can theoretically be done quickly, but practically would take half a year to a year between making it, testing it, and getting it stocked.

Yeah, you chew and swallow this thing and it'll relieve your pain.

Am I talking about a pain med there or eating food for hunger pains?

I will say that it's pretty conclusively proven that the cracks from your joints provide no real relief and there isn't enough study about deep tissue massage (except that the ""pushing out toxins"" thing is total bullshit).

The evidence for the long term benefits of deep tissue massage is **slightly positive but weak**. The studies that have been done are targeted to a specific set of pain circumstances (low back, headache, fibromyalgia, etc...) and are usually short in duration. 

I've got personal anecdotes but those are worthless from a scientific data perspective. I've used chiropractic in the past and stopped when I realized that the ""relief"" from the adjustments only lasted about 15 minutes. I've used deep tissue massage for treating specific fucked up things (when I couldn't life arm above shoulder for example) and then stop when goal achieved. I've been going lately for fucked up knees because muscle tightness is pulling my kneecaps out of alignment and neither the injection or the physical therapy did jack shit, I've been slowly getting the mobility back with the massage (I'm 2 years into the knee pain with no changes but only 3 months into the massage just to dispel the inevitable comment about ""would have fixed itself if you had waited"")",,,,1630677114,{},hbg377b,False,t3_pgpu4o,False,False,t1_hbfez2s,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pgpu4o/florida_school_district_no_longer_accepts_mask/hbg377b/,1630760349.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_4bva8,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why tho?

Virtual learning has a ton of advantages once implemented earnestly. Even putting aside the obvious benefit during a pandemic, virtual learning allows slow students to go slow and fast students to go fast, all at their own pace. 

It saves gas, saves money, saves time. 

It isolates and controls learning experiences that schools are responsible for while allowing more control of social learning by making it a bit separate from the other aspects, allowing sharper focus.


it also encourages tech literacy which is only going to be needed more and more as time goes by.

[],,rychan,,,,,,[],"But note that the 400 Covid deaths were during a time when schools were closed, when people were masking, etc. There were serious mitigations in place. It was also before the Delta variant was widespread.

Also note that Flu deaths are usually between 37 and 199 per year. 2018-2019 was a bad year.

Also note that the numbers you're giving are extrapolated from actual reports, but for Covid we're limiting the numbers to actual reports. See https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/children.htm

&gt; Also of note, even though individual flu deaths in children must be reported to CDC, it is likely that not all deaths are captured and that the number of actual deaths is higher. CDC has developed statistical models that account for the underreporting of flu-related deaths in children to estimate the actual number of deaths. During 2019-2020, for example, 199 deaths in children were reported to CDC but statistical modeling suggests approximately 434 deaths may have occurred.

To be clear, Covid is worse than Flu for children.

You know what more adults can do to help protect kids? **Get vaccinated**. We also must prioritize safety in schools — especially proper ventilation and other public mitigation tools. 

From the article: 

&gt; Kids are heading back into the classroom for yet another pandemic school year, but this time with the more contagious Delta variant getting more people sick. Navigating school safely will be trickier than ever.

&gt; ""Everyone keeps reflecting back on last year and saying: 'Oh, we got through it with school last year, so we'll get through it this year', but this year is drastically different,"" Dr. Aaron Milstone, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins Children's Center said as he was on his own child's first-day-of-school event.

&gt; **Between the Delta variant and more people going to restaurants, weddings and large events without masks than at this time last year, he said, kids face a higher risk of getting sick.**

…

&gt; ""A lot of people didn't send their kids to school last year,"" Milstone said. ""This year there's just a lot more activity and there's a lot more density of people getting together, and a lot of those people are unvaccinated and are susceptible to a virus that's spreading quickly through that population.""

&gt; **Masks and better classroom ventilation can help protect kids, but to reduce risk further, adults will have to step it up, experts say. More people need to get vaccinated, and more adults need to reduce their exposure to the virus.**



&gt; **As Covid-19 surged across the population recently, cases and hospitalizations among kids ""increased exponentially."" They are at their highest numbers since winter**, the American Academy of Pediatrics said Tuesday.

…

&gt; **Hospitals expect not just more Covid-19 patients, but also an increase in flu cases and patients with other respiratory illnesses. They're already treating an early wave of patients with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), after all of these illnesses were largely absent last year when more people were staying home.**",,,,1630675713,{},hbg04ri,False,t3_ph2sqp,False,True,t1_hbftb72,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ph2sqp/its_the_same_pandemic_but_now_its_drastically/hbg04ri/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_bz91eiwq,False,False,,False,c4302103f5161e9f0444ea37d1dac7e849ff97b1,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1630675729.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

When the schools were “closed” they were actually still open and functioning as daycares for all the families where both parents had to work to provide food and shelter for the family.

So instead of having a bunch of kids in classes being taught by teachers, they had a bunch of kids in classes on laptops remotely connected to teachers at home, and an additional staff member hanging out at the school watching them on their laptops. Sound stupid? It is!

That outcome *isn’t any better* than just having in-person classes, and in some cases is actually worse than just having in-person classes.

Yes there were exceptions where some of the better off parents could afford to have their kids stay home and for *those* (aka rich) kids they were offered protection from COVID. But the rich can afford to do this anyway if they care, so again, it doesn’t really matter.

Nobody’s saying “full protection” anymore. They haven’t for months. It’s a strawman. 

The evidence clearly shows unvaccinated folks are about **five times more likely** to be infected with sars-cov-2 than vaccinated folks.

To answer your original question, why even perform maintenance therapy in the first place? What is the underlying pathology that needs to be addressed in the first place? This was born out of the ""subluxation model"" [which to your point has been condemned by fellow chiropractors since then](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3238291/). However, if we look at the above evidence that the techniques that a chiropractor uses is ""meh"" at best, why keep going to a chiropractor for those techniques? 

Finally, it seems that maintenance therapy shows poor evidence for the above techniques. While [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6868774/pdf/12998_2019_Article_283.pdf) seems to suggest that maintenance appointments can be an appointment to ensure that the patient is maintaining healthy habits and continuing to exercises, are we sure that chiropractors are the best practitioner to be doing that?

[],,PayterLobo,,,,,,[],"No of course, I definitely think your comment is needed and I whole heartedly agree with you. I also want to add Im not some militant atheist so I dont ""hate"" religion by any means, I just think that so few people (such as yourself) actually understand their religion and what it really means to an individual. Just like you said its personal to you. I went to catholic school and was raised in a catholic household (loosely lol). I was always confused how the teachings of Jesus were just never followed by those who believed in the faith. I was like Jesus was just a great person, he didnt judge, he didnt persecute, he literally accepted everyone and treated everyone with respect, honesty and love. For some reason its like people want to be like God in the old testament and not Jesus (who God literally sent down to show people how to be?) 

 I dont think religion is an identity but more so a way of thinking and life. If only more people were like you. I think no matter what you believe, as long as you're a good person, moral and ethically, thats all that matters. Whatever you decide to believe is not important (i dont mean that disrespectfully just generally).

People take religion like this identity and when someone disgrees or has another perspective the launch into combat mode and then it becomes ""I'm right and your wrong because my God said so"". I feel like somewhere along the lines religion was manipulated past the point of what God would have intended. If that makes sense? 

All in all Im sorry for the rambling, but I fully agree with you and your practice. If more people could practice like you I think we would have a better world. In the end no matter who or what you believe in, we only have eachother. We need to help and protect eachother, and treat eachother with kindess and love..no one person is inheritantly better than the other.  I'd like to think any God would surely agree that is the right sentiment.

Many of them, after weeks or months, are quitting.

This right here, tells me you don’t understand science, and you don’t understand the placebo effect. You cannot judge the placebo effect yourself. It requires a double-blind study by its very nature.

Now, if you are interested in really understanding, I have two things to offer.

First, familiarize yourself with the history of Chiro: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiropractic_controversy_and_criticism

Learn about it, and what it really is.

Second, and this is truly more important. Find a copy of **The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark**. Read the chapter titled *The Fine Art of Baloney Detection*. Then if you want, read the chapter titled *The Dragon in my Garage*. Don’t read the other chapters unless you are really into the book. These two are the most important and they are not very long.

They tell you what science really is, and how to use it for your own purposes.

However, I warn you in advance, if you really understand these chapters it will very likely trigger some cognitive dissonance and really screw up your view of the world for a while.

I don't really consider that to be a problem except for the ones that were known to have issues (and those have apparently been retracted), but most people aren't going to look at each and every study to see how valid it is because most people have no idea how research works (which is honestly fair). Those people really should be questioning why the scientific community doesn't see those positive studies as carrying as much weight as the ones with more ambivalent or negative results though.

However, I still think that the people endangering themselves with ivermectin aren't reading those studies. At least some of the people who are vocal proponents online probably did, but aren't qualified to disseminate that sort of information. People would actually find dosing info in the studies. Then again, lots of people can't do basic math either.

The way I see it: using ivermectin to treat covid itself, or as a prophylactic treatment, is an experimental use of the drug. It's not approved to be used that way, and the stronger clinical trials did not support using it that way. Using the FDA approved Pfizer shot is not only drastically more effective per research (and free), but also *not* experimental.

No, the system is “ensure they’ll get Covid. Pray it’s mild”.

Which as an individual choice is not outrageous: Covid (even the Delta version) is statistically not that threatening to kids. The risk to unvaccinated kids is about the same as to their vaccinated parents, and much lower than the risk to their unvaccinated grandparents. Many things in our society (e.g. cars) are much more threatening to children.

As social policy it’s pretty terrible though.

[],,woody94,,,,,,[],"The surge in COVID-19 cases nationwide has led to highly charged debates on the efficacy of vaccines and whether they should be required in certain social settings.

The Idaho Statesman reached out to almost 70 elected county and city officials around the Treasure Valley to ask if they had gotten the vaccine, and why or why not. Twenty-five responded. 
The respondents include mayors, city councilors, county commissioners and others. Many of them differed in background, political party and position. Most said they chose to get the vaccine, while one chose not to.

Just one said he was unvaccinated: Darl Bruner, a Nampa city councilman. He said he got COVID-19 along with his close family members and is confident they have developed “natural immunity.”

Idaho has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the nation. Only 48.7% of eligible Idahoans — those 12 and older — are fully vaccinated, according to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare.

Here’s what we found:

ADA COUNTY
Ada County Commissioner Rod Beck was among the first to get a vaccine. Beck said he received his shot during an AstraZeneca study last November. Some participants received a placebo, while others, like Beck, received the actual vaccine.
“I wanted to contribute to the research on a vaccine for the COVID-19 virus,” Beck said, adding he believed people should consult with their doctor before getting vaccinated.

Commissioner Kendra Kenyon also received the vaccine.
So did County Prosecutor Jan Bennetts.

Sheriff Matt Clifford did too, saying he thought getting the vaccine was the best way to protect himself and his family. Assessor Robert McQuade gave similar reasons.
“While I won’t make recommendations, I don’t understand why others are not protecting themselves against this deadly virus,” McQuade said.

Clerk Phil McGrane said his wife is a pediatric nurse, and their frequent contact with medical personnel persuaded them to get vaccinated.

BOISE
Boise Mayor Lauren McLean said one reason her family got vaccinated was so her children could have more protection before returning to school.
“It meant that they had a layer of protection when in the classroom that they hadn’t had until then,” McLean said.

City Councilor Lisa Sanchez, who has Type 2 diabetes, said she got the vaccine for more protection, since her health background puts her at greater risk for the worst effects of the virus.

In total, four Boise councilors — Sanchez, TJ Thomson, Patrick Bageant and Elaine Clegg — replied, all saying they were vaccinated.

MERIDIAN
Meridian Mayor Robert Simison said conversations with health care providers got him thinking that getting vaccinated was the right move.
“People need to take personal responsibility and weigh their choice and options, practicing the safety precautions we have all experienced over the last year, while understanding that our individual decisions have potential implications on our health system and our community, not just ourselves,” Simison said in an email.

As a mother of young children, Meridian City Councilwoman Liz Strader said it was important for her to get the vaccine as soon as she was eligible.

“I am a mother with young children counting on me, and my worst fear is not being here for them,” she said in an email.

Strader said she recommended that constituents get the vaccine.

“My message to them is I care about each one of you, including those who have decided not to get vaccinated at this time,” she said. I will respect your health choices, but I hope you decide to get it when you feel comfortable so that you will be safe.”

She also asked Meridian residents to think about health care providers.

“They are overwhelmed by this surge, so we all need to roll up our sleeves to make a difference,” she said.

EAGLE
Eagle City Councilman Charlie Baun said he is vaccinated, along with his family. He said he recommends people get vaccinated, but says he is also an advocate for personal choice. He is not in favor of vaccine mandates, he said.


“While some are comfortable with the level of risk with existing vaccines, others are not,” Baun said in an email. “It should be the individual’s choice what happens to their body; however, you should also keep in mind that your choices can impact the health of others.”

Councilman Kenny Pittman replied but declined to answer the Statesman’s questions, saying his health choices are “not open for public discussion.”

Pittman also provided a statement saying: “Our Federal and State Government has overstepped their powers given by the people that have elected them. Some of our Constitutional Rights and Freedom of choice have been taken away. Our only choice now is to prepare to defend our God given rights as Americans and uphold the Oath of office we all took when we were elected.”

STAR
Star City Councilman Kevin Nielsen has been vaccinated. He said vaccines have played an important role in protecting people from serious diseases for over 200 years and in some cases have been solely responsible for completely eradicating diseases, like polio.
“My father was a biochemist and microbiologist who worked in immunodiagnostics and developed methods for medicine delivery such as insulin and vaccines,” Nielsen said in an email. “My grandfather was a boy in a town where typhoid fever killed more than 70% of its residents, and became a pioneer in research of methods such as hand washing, pasteurization and public water sanitation as a means of controlling the spread of disease or bacterial infection.

“His research was met with suspicion and intense resistance at that time, yet those methods are commonly known for their efficacy today. Thanks to vaccines, my family hasn’t had to deal with the chicken pox, typhoid, polio, tetanus and many other diseases that still ravage communities and individuals in places like India and Africa. “

Nielsen said his opinion doesn’t matter in other people’s choices whether or not to get vaccinated. “Do what you think is best without judging others for their choices,” he said.

“In general, I hope we learned during this pandemic that the most important things in life center around our family and friends,” he said. “It’s how we treat each other, even those who we disagree with, that is in large part the measure of our civil society and individual character.”

Councilman Michael Keyes said he was on the fence about the vaccine for “quite a while” since it had not been fully approved by the Food and Drug Administration until earlier this month.

“Then a dear friend contracted COVID,” Keyes said in an email. “While he did not require hospitalization, he did end up being on disability for five and a half months. By the time my age group came around for vaccination eligibility, millions had received the vaccine and there were not widespread reports of deleterious side effects.”

He then decided to get the vaccine, he said.

Keyes also said he believes it is not the role of government to protect people’s health but to protect their liberty.

“I believe my constituents should manage their own health and make their own decisions,” he said. “I believe they should then enjoy the rewards, or own the consequences, of those decisions. Having said that, on a personal level, I do recommend that people include vaccination as a viable and effective option in their decision-making process.”

WHERE OFFICIALS GET VACCINE INFORMATION
The Statesman asked officials where they get information about the vaccine and COVID-19.

Many said they talked to their health care providers and listened during meetings with local agencies. Others mentioned local news outlets and guidance issued from organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Bruner said one his sources is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, a government-maintained database where anyone can submit information about adverse reactions to the vaccines. The database has often been cited by those who claim falsely that the vaccine has killed thousands, although its website says the data it collects cannot be used to determine if that’s the case.

Nielsen, the Star councilman, said he got his information from his doctor and from friends and family in the medical field. He has stayed away from reading the news and listening to elected officials talk about vaccines.

“I recommend that people get informed through reputable sources who, to the best of their knowledge, are not influenced by any political position,” Nielsen said.

Strader, the Meridian councilwoman, said she, too, obtained information from her doctor. She also has relied on information from Dr. David Pate, the former CEO of St. Luke’s Health System, and Dr. Jim Souza, St. Luke’s chief physician executive.

Garner, the Middleton councilman, said a lot of information “isn’t being covered by the main news sources.” He said he prefers to get his information from Dr. Ryan Cole, Ada County’s controversial nominee to the Central District Health board. Cole has incorrectly said that the vaccine has killed thousands of people and promoted alternative COVID-19 treatments such as ivermectin, an anti-paracitic drug.

HOW WE ASKED, AND WHO DID NOT REPLY
The Statesman emailed at least one request to each elected city and county official in Ada and western Canyon counties, including some through mayors or city or county spokespeople who were asked to relay the requests to council members or county officials.

[],,negative_mancy,,,,,,[],"There's a gigantic overlap in the education of MDs and DOs. They both do 4 years of med school which include 2 preclinical years (classic education of lectures and tests) on subjects like anatomy, pharmacology, biochemistry, etc., followed by 2 clinical years where they rotate through different specialities (e.g. Internal Medicine, Surgery, Ob/Gyn, etc.). After medical school, they both do residency in their speciality of choice. At the residency level, MDs and DOs are often in the same program and the difference between the two becomes less apparent.

In terms of differences, the major one is that DOs learn osteopathic manipulation treatment (OMT) in addition to the standard medical education. This involves movement of the patient's body for diagnosis and treatment of some illnesses. This is much less backed up by clinical data and is closer to the realm of pseudoscience (and ironically enough, similar to what chiropractors do). Many DOs view OMT in the same way and few practice it though some swear by it. Admittedly, I'm an MD so my opinion may be somewhat biased. Additionally in terms of differences, DOs have their own set of board exams though many sit for the MD boards as well as residencies look more favorably upon those scores. Finally, the entrance requirements are a little more lenient for DOs, with lower undergrad GPAs and MCAT (admissions test) scores needed.

It's really fucked up what is going on with our schools. Basically, our county's school administrators put out a very heart-felt request for everyone to wear masks but also said that they can't force anyone to because the Governor is holding their funding hostage. It also turns out their contact tracing is garbage. We got a letter on Wednesday saying ""we have had a positive case in the buiding. If you were a close contact you have been contacted"" I later learned that the positive case was in my daughter's class. My daughter started showing symptoms on Saturday morning. She got her positive result on Sunday and we contacted the school. About 6 hours later we were notified that 6 more positive cases had been reported in the building.

It's more so the same people who choose not to get vaccinated also don't want to wear masks and continue to live their life like it's 2019.

One person was vaccinated, but trusted that her adult son was also vaccinated and eased up on wearing a mask, all the while her son was hosting maskless parties, was anti-vax and infected the whole family, including his own toddler and pregnant wife. 

I'm sure many others have similar stories, so please excuse the lack of patience we have for people who have yet to take the vaccine.

The recent report, cases by age 

If you look in the last few weeks, you see a continued drop in ages 10-40, while other age groups rise in cases 

From a mathematical perspective, you only expect cases doubling in one group to result in cases doubling in another group if a person from a group is equally as likely to infect their own group as they are any other group 

Let's say the average child infects 1.5 children, and .5 elderly 

Let's say the average elderly infects 
.8 elderly 

If there are 1000 infected children and 100 infected elderly today, then this gen of children will infect 1500 children and 50 elderly. 

This gen of elderly will infect 80 elderly. 

Tomorrow's generation will have 1500 infected children and 130 infected elderly -- an increase in 50% for child population, but just 30% for elderly population 

Those numbers are bogus, but I'm trying to illustrate that your statement assumes that children are equally as likely to infect the elderly as they are other children.

[How do doctors make a medical diagnosis?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK338593/)

&gt; The diagnostic process proceeds as follows: 

&gt; **First**, a patient experiences a health problem. The patient is likely the first person to consider his or her symptoms and may choose at this point to engage with the health care system. 

&gt; **Once a patient seeks health care, there is an iterative process of information gathering, information integration and interpretation, and determining a working diagnosis.**

&gt; Performing a clinical history and interview, conducting a physical exam, performing diagnostic testing, and referring or consulting with other clinicians are all ways of accumulating information that may be relevant to understanding a patient's health problem. The information-gathering approaches can be employed at different times, and diagnostic information can be obtained in different orders. 

&gt; **The continuous process of information gathering, integration, and interpretation involves hypothesis generation and updating prior probabilities as more information is learned.** Communication among health care professionals, the patient, and the patient's family members is critical in this cycle of information gathering, integration, and interpretation.

&gt; The working diagnosis may be either a list of potential diagnoses (a differential diagnosis) or a single potential diagnosis.

This part’s important: 

&gt; **Typically, clinicians will consider more than one diagnostic hypothesis or possibility as an explanation of the patient's symptoms and will refine this list as further information is obtained in the diagnostic process.**

&gt; The working diagnosis should be shared with the patient, including an explanation of the degree of uncertainty associated with a working diagnosis. Each time there is a revision to the working diagnosis, this information should be communicated to the patient. 

This part is key: 

&gt; **As the diagnostic process proceeds**, a fairly broad list of potential diagnoses may be narrowed into fewer potential options, a process referred to as diagnostic modification and refinement (Kassirer et al., 2010). 

&gt; **As the list becomes narrowed to one or two possibilities**, diagnostic refinement of the working diagnosis becomes diagnostic verification, in which the lead diagnosis is checked for its adequacy in explaining the signs and symptoms, its coherency with the patient's context (physiology, risk factors), and whether a single diagnosis is appropriate. 

&gt; When considering invasive or risky diagnostic testing or treatment options, the diagnostic verification step is particularly important so that a patient is not exposed to these risks without a reasonable chance that the testing or treatment options will be informative and will likely improve patient outcomes.

2. All of the variants are part of the conspiracy and are being released back-to-back to keep us down.

3. Masks don’t work, are giving kids RSV, and causing them to become suicidal. And masks are gross and impossible to clean and/or replace. And they caused a kid in China to have a heart attack.

5. Public meetings about masks are being conducted during the day to keep people from attending them (there were literally hundreds of people at this publicly announced meeting)

Yeah, Bessemer is “rough” (as you know) and is chronically listed as one of the most dangerous cities in the US with about a 1 in 34 chance of being a victim of violent crime compared to the overall rate of 1 in 196 for the state of Alabama. There are a lot of problems in Bessemer/Birmingham and the surrounding areas that contribute to it being “rough” but this is a COVID sub, not social sciences or the like. 

Point being, yeah, you’re probably partially right in that some of them probably couldn’t care less about COVID and just want to fuck off and get out of school. After all, they’re kids and even if you do care it’s an added bonus. But just because these young people live in an impoverished, high-crime area in a very red state etc. etc. doesn’t mean that they aren’t aware or do not care. That gives them all the more reason to. They are seeing for themselves how history, bad policy, and now this virus and the ways it’s been handled has disparately affected their communities. All the renegades and social change-makers of the past were young once too. 

I have my doubts sometimes about younger people (am a parent, around kids a lot, have eyes), but we need to stop discounting them because of their youth and other things they can’t help, such as where they come from or who their parents are. Maybe they saw this as an opportunity to have a day off, sure. But even so it’s making headlines about their concerns, be they “genuine” or not. We gotta have more faith in our young people. We haven’t exactly shown them high priority as a country in the past year and a half. And as another poster said, being eligible for something (like the vaccine) is not an automatic guarantee that a person can or will get it for various reasons or barriers.

I figured you go to a back doctor, aka, the chiropractor. For two years I felt “relief” but I couldn’t sit properly in a chair or airplane seat. I had to favor one hip. And each time I’d get a treatment he’d shove that hip back into my pelvis. Then one day I was stretching and my sneaker heel got caught on the rug pulling my leg OUT and I heard an audible POP. But it didn’t hurt, in fact it felt better. I sat down and I had NO problem sitting on both sitz bones. I went to the chiropractor and told him that the hip being pulled *out* felt better than pushed in and he said Oh those are freak things that happens to people but it can’t be reproduced just like the patient of his who felt better after his kids jumped on him. (Again, I was stretching) So he shoved the hip back in and I limped home. I never went back again. I managed to pop the hip back out and was fine for years. I hurt it again and this time went to PT.

[],,rychan,,,,,,[],"&gt; The decision by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation not to recommend Covid vaccines for all 12 to 15-year-olds is ""out of step"" with the stance taken by most other high-income countries, a scientist says.

&gt;Christina Pagel, a professor of operational research at University College London, says the World Health Organization, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have all recommended vaccinating 12 to 15-year-olds.

&gt;Pagel, a member of the Independent Sage group set up to scrutinise decisions made by the government on coronavirus, says a recent ONS report estimated one in 1,000 children have had long Covid for more than a year.

&gt;She also pointed to a study

&gt;""It doesn't really make any sense to me that we're not trying to protect children from Covid.""

Yet the point doesn't change. Israel doesn't have a such high % of people vaccinated. It's perfectly comparable with European rate. Even lower in some cases.

This means they all had to stock up to last through the impending lockdowns, as a matter of course completely independent of any real or perceived shortages in supply.

The problem was that people saw that toilet paper was being bought at a much higher than normal rate as a result of this.

[],,GlitterBombFallout,#46d160,,02cc5c36-ae80-11eb-a76b-0e911ea99c5d,I'm fully vaccinated! 💉💪🩹,light,[],"A few years ago, I developed a bad *bad* trapezius strain, like crying at work because I couldn't lift anything without debilitating pain. Felt like my shoulder was on fucking fire. It covered my entire shoulder blade, to the side of my back, to over the top of my shoulder. I *also* developed a torn cervical disc around that time, too (my body hates me)

My physical medicine doctor wanted me to see a physio and said we should try dry needling. I'd never heard of it before, and it sorta sounded like acupuncture to me, so I was extremely skeptical. Before I had my appointment, I did a lot of searching online about it to find out what kind of science was behind it and whether it's had clinical trials, and how it differs from woowoo stuff. I read a bunch of dry needling VS acupuncture articles too, and honestly I was still extremely skeptical because it honestly just didn't sound like something that actually did anything. I specifically looked for anything showing it as better than placebo. It's been a while and I really can't remember much about it now, but everything I read did support it being a valid treatment.

So I see him, he does a little massage and shows me some stretches, and asks if I wanted to try dry needling. I said okay, we did it, and I really didn't feel anything different, and no changes over the week. We do the same at my next appointment, and *still* I don't feel any different during that week. Third time, I explained how I wasn't seeing any improvement at all and I was really frustrated. He said we could skip it, but I was still in agonizing pain, so said I'd give it one more try.

That third one actually started to help. I was still concerned about placebo effect and figured it'd only help for a couple weeks. We did a session every week for... A long time. Like 12 weeks? Lol my trapezius strain was seriously bad. But it did actually continue helping and improving to the point I looked forward to it. Some of the muscle twitches were really goddamn painful and I could barely stand it.

But since we finished, I have not had a recurrence of that strain or the knots all over my shoulder. I honestly expected it to do nothing at all, but was happily surprised.

I'm not really sure what I'm getting at here, other than tested and studied treatments with better than placebo results are 1000% better than ""here, let me pop your spine"" 😑",,,,1630693847,{},hbh72na,False,t3_pgpu4o,False,True,t1_hbe37j5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pgpu4o/florida_school_district_no_longer_accepts_mask/hbh72na/,1630782332.0,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_3n0gm3ey,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
