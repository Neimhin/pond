&gt;Progress is being made on all three fronts:  
¬∑ In the next month, Beigel expects results from studies of people who got sick despite being vaccinated in clinical trials, findings that could help establish an immunity baseline ‚Äî what scientists call a ‚Äúcorrelate of protection.‚Äù Those studies could help researchers establish a threshold ‚Äî such as a minimum antibody level ‚Äî that signals whether someone is immune or whether that person has become vulnerable to infection.  
¬∑ Scientists are analyzing blood samples from the first people who were vaccinated a year ago in trials, hoping to determine whether antibodies continue to stick around or if they vanish. Earlier research found that the disease fighters remain at robust levels for at least six months following Moderna vaccination, although variants can complicate that, with antibody protection that fades faster. A recent Nature study found that antibodies do decline after people recover from infection, but they don‚Äôt keep plummeting ‚Äî they plateau and persist nearly a year later.  
¬∑ The clinical trial being launched by NIAID will systematically test whether people who received one brand of vaccine in January ‚Äî a single shot of Johnson &amp; Johnson, two shots of the Moderna vaccine or two shots of Pfizer-BioNTech ‚Äî ***need to get the same brand of vaccine, or whether there might be benefits to mixing and matching.***",,,1622159032,{},gzp5hkg,False,t3_nmj3yp,False,True,t3_nmj3yp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nmj3yp/yes_well_probably_need_coronavirus_booster_shots/gzp5hkg/,1622264674,2,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

How many times do people need to be told this?  Companies will not just give other countries the methods for creating their vaccines, that is a massive liability, no company is going to allow another country to produce their vaccine without that country being held to the very same standards they are held to here in USA.  Thus means facilities and staff, months and months of twsting/trials, its insane how much time, work, effort is required to make this happen.

It is actually cheaper and faster if other countries just buy the vaccine from the companies here in USA.  These companies aren't just going to give the production of their vaccines out to random foreign countries purely because if they fuck up the vaccine and it starts causing deaths or other major side effects it could completely botch the entire idea of using vaccines and they won't want to be held liable for shitty vaccine production.

Basically.

The EDTA is introduced here because they need a mechanism where the activated platelets can get into circulation to form the clot. EDTA chelates calcium pretty well and we know that cahderins are cell glue proteins whose interaction is calcium dependent. EDTA sequestration thus could increase this capillary cell interaction and allow the complex to escape.

In blood collection you are using EDTA to prevent clotting at a higher concentration in a blood sample removed from the body. Coagulation depends on calcium so this is effective. In this case it cannot work since the concentration is too low and the clot is distal (far away) from the injection point so clotting can still effectively occur.",,,1622175204,{},gzpzjwf,False,t3_nm43t0,False,False,t1_gzo60u2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nm43t0/german_scientists_say_they_can_help_improve_covid/gzpzjwf/,1622281427,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

In NSW what would be considered level one restrictions in NZ is the equivalent of no community spread. Everything is normal with no masks anywhere. The only thing you need to do is sign in at restaurants, pubs, gyms and basically anywhere you are going to be inside for any length of time. All the restrictions are to help contact tracers get ahead of an outbreak but barely effect day to day life.

The NSW equivalent of NZ level two restrictions is when there is an outbreak. Limits on gatherings in indoors settings and masks on public transport and indoors public spaces. 

NSW has not needed a level three type lockdown since the initial lockdown.

Comparing this with the NZ system, level one provides no help to the contact tracers as venue login isn't required and isn't enforced.

&gt;Kroger officials say its new giveaway campaign called the #CommunityImmunity comes after a collaboration with the Biden administration to get more Americans vaccinated.

&gt;""The faster we reach community immunity, the sooner we can all get back to enjoying backyard barbecues, live music and gathering for special occasions,"" said Rodney McMullen, Kroger's chairman and CEO. ""We greatly appreciate President Joe Biden's leadership and partnership with the private sector to increase vaccinations among the U.S. population, especially people of color and individuals under age 30. As an employer, grocery provider, and community partner, the¬†#CommunityImmunity¬†giveaway is another way we are doing our part to help America recover from the public health crisis and safely return to normal.""

&gt;Kroger Health will be announcing prizes, official rules and eligibility for the giveaway next week. WLWT will provide updates on how you can enter.

I expect it‚Äôs a similar story in the countries mentioned above. 

Expect that riskier socialization will happen. And then be prepared to lock down *as soon* as cases begin to increase. Don‚Äôt hesitate, lock it down.

And in a country where vaccine supply is low, be prepared to be flexible in your rollout plan. 

If your priority category is 60+ and they‚Äôre hesitant, switch it up and allow a period where other high risk categories can be vaccinated.

* Australia's own vaccine didn't work out. It looks like it might have been effective against Covid, but it also had a side effect of making HIV tests false positive.
* Took a long time to spin up local AZ production, then the blood clots caused Pfizer to be recommended for people under 50. All of which has to be imported and was in low supply until a few days ago.
* Even people eligible for AZ have been complacent or reluctant, just sitting around saying there's no Covid here so why bother. And the decision to stop recommending AZ for under 50s meant some eligible people started to make a fuss they want it too and will wait around for it. sigh.
* The government's done a shit job of promoting the vaccine. Boring ad campaigns, politicians jibber-jabbering about it, no creative messaging.
* Logistics have been slow and confusing. It was meant to go to GZs, but GPs didn't have doses. Took months to set up big centres, apparently no real planning or urgency. People who became eligible yesterday reported they had to call a phone line dozens of times.

Also a huge part of it could be that Sinovac only has a 3% effectiveness with 1 shot (based on studies by the Chilean government) hence getting people protected takes in total 42 days since the first shot (28 days between doses and 14 extra days after the second shot for secured antibodies), so obtaining antibodies and protection is slower than other vaccines (Pfizer is also used in Chile but it‚Äôs like about 10% of vaccinated people, the large majority being Sinovac) which could explain why Chile is still on the rise.

Right now we‚Äôre on 26 year olds being vaccinated, but it won‚Äôt be another 42 days until they get protection. Now thanks to the green card people between 30-50 that decided not to get the vaccine months ago are JUST now getting their shots, so I think Chile has another month or two of cases, based on what I‚Äôm seeing here.

So another person (traveler B) who was also staying at that quarantine hotel, opened their door for a short duration (1 min) apparently the air from the traveler A's room blew into traveler B's room. This was at the end of traveler B's hotel stay, so when traveler B got tested before they left the hotel, traveler B tested negative (either false negative or was too early to give exact reading).

This happens because when a person such as traveler A is infected/positive, they will emit viral load into the air. This can build up quite a bit in an enclosed room. Now if traveler A used the aircon or anything like that, this air with high density viral load can easily infect someone if breathed in.

Anyway... traveler B tested negative and was released from the quarantine hotel. He then flew to Melbourne, Victoria and shortly later on, developed symptoms.

But comparing it to birth control or any other risk is stupids and misses the point of most people that are cautious of or against vaccines. 

People take birth control pills for a reason. They want to have sex without risk of becoming pregnant or to help regulate hormones because of bad period experiences. People are willing to take a risk for some benefit. 

If people don‚Äôt fear the virus, why would they take any risk to avoid getting sick from it? There is no perceived benefit. 

At a certain age and case rate the balance may well shift. In the U.K. a healthy 30 year old woman is unlikely to die from the virus. That may have been higher in January but now, the case rate is so low, hospitals are not at capacity and the general risk of hospitalisation is so low that the risk of dying from covid is very very low for that group. That‚Äôs true even those that agree the virus is dangerous and have been actively avoiding it as much as possible.

Supply is an issue, Australia is producing AZ at home and importing Pfizer. Pfizer supply is constrained by how much and how quickly we can import from Europe. It's in demand worldwide.

Pfizer supply is increasing, but AZ is not recommended to Australians under 50 because the risk of clots is higher than the risk of disease in an Australian context. And there's some hesitancy about AZ from the population. We seem to have plenty of AZ.

Our federal government is handling our vaccination program and haven't been doing a fantastic job.

People are complacent about receiving the vaccines because for most people Covid is basically a non issue. Melbourne have had a terrible year, and some individuals are struggling elsewhere, but pretty much everyone else in the country has experienced very little impact from the pandemic.

Our vaccine (UQ) caused a false positive for HIV and so was abandoned in 2020.

We started our vaccination program later than the rest of the world because we didn't get emergency approval for use from our TGA.

Hopefully the situation in Melbourne will be a wake up call. The federal government is diverting extra vaccines to them now.

&gt;The extension is needed as people are increasingly roaming in public, especially in Tokyo and Osaka, when they should be doing the opposite, and it‚Äôs feared that lifting the emergency would cause an instant rebound in infections, Economy Revitalization Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said.

&gt;The current emergency in the capital and eight other metropolitan areas was to end next Monday, but hospitals in some areas are still overflowing with COVID-19 patients and serious cases hit new highs recently.

&gt;Nishimura told reporters the government proposal of a 20-day extension to June 20 in the nine areas received preliminary approval from experts ahead of an official announcement later Friday. The southern island prefecture of Okinawa is already under emergency status through June 20.

&gt;Olympic organizers have to decide around that date whether to allow any fans at all, after overseas spectators were banned months ago. A plan to prioritize vaccinations for Japanese athletes also is being delayed to around that time, according to media reports.

&gt;The Olympics are scheduled to start on July 23 after a one-year postponement due to the pandemic, and worries about the new variants and Japan‚Äôs slow vaccination rollouts have triggered calls from the public and medical experts to cancel the Games.

&gt;Experts have warned that more contagious variants are infecting more people, leaving them seriously ill and flooding hospitals.

&gt;Meanwhile, Japan has lagged on vaccinations due to bureaucratic and planning missteps and shortages. Only 2.3% of the population has been fully vaccinated, and the current phase targeting older adults is not scheduled to finish before the Games.

&gt;Still, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and his government are determined to host the Olympics. The International Olympic Committee has also said the Olympics would go ahead even if the host city Tokyo is under emergency measures.

Pfizer did not develop the vaccine by itself, but rather another company called BioNTech created the original formula, which went through Pfizer's clinical trials and became the vaccine we use these days.

Many people who got the vaccine refer to it as the Pfizer vaccine, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine which is widely used today is often called ""Pfizer"", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the vaccine initially developed by BioNTech.

There really is a Pfizer contribute to the vaccine, and these people should partly thank that corporation, but it is just a part of what allowed them to be vaccinated. Pfizer is the distributor and responsible for clinical trials. Clinical trials are an essential part of a vaccine, but useless by itself; they can only be done once somebody developed the vaccine in the first place. So, the Pfizer vaccine can only be used because it was developed in the first place by BioNTech: the whole system is basically BioNTech with Pfizer contributions, or BioNTech/Pfizer.

There is a group of people who absolutely refuse to listen to the government. Very much 'you die, I die' attitude. Sinovac is absolutely out of the question with this group. 

Hong Kong government is highly unlikable by its general population, no surprises there. The only thing it has quantitatively has done well is control the spread of covid through strong border lockdown. So significant chunk of the population is very much 'why take vaccine risk when covid is well controlled? I'll take the vaccine when I can go on holiday'. But people can't go on holiday until almost everyone gets vaccinated.

Local media is also incredibly irresponsible. They have been reporting every bad medical event post vaccination with no professional ever saying it has links with vaccination. So people get the impression that vaccine = death.

I've finally convinced my parents in Hong Kong to get their vaccination after bugging them for 2 months.

The problem isn't people saying we should ignore any other factors. That's not what is happening.

With these numbers of COVID still being 10x deadlier than recent flu, 25k cases a day is going to result in almost twice the number of deaths as the annual flu burden.

There are tons of studies saying certain variants can bypass past infection acquired immunity (e.g https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/03/210323131203.htm).

Also, you dont need to be well-read on these studies. Guidance from CDC, health professionals on TV, etc, has consistently been that you need vaccine even with past infection.

&gt; [...]

&gt; One limitation of our study was the relatively small sample size and the predominantly young population, which lessen generalization of the results. Also, because of the cross-sectional design, we could not obtain baseline or longitudinal serum samples. For the 7 asymptomatic participants in our study, we evaluated antibody responses at 2 and 5 months after infection; 5/7 (71%) had positive ELISA results at 2 months after infection, 4/7 (57.1%) had positive ELISA results at 5 months after infection, and all had neutralizing antibodies at 2 and 5 months after infection (1,7). Last, we could not assess the individual possibilities of reexposure or reinfection. However, it is unlikely that humoral immunity was boosted because in Daegu, where the study participants reside, during April‚ÄìOctober 2020, the daily incidence rate for COVID-19 was &lt;0.5 cases/100,000 population (14). In conclusion, despite concerns of waning immunity, appropriate immunoassays can detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at 8 months after infection in most asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic persons.

My SIL adopted her oldest son and their daughter and I honestly CANNOT imagine our family without those two. :) GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!

SIL felt very strongly about wanting to adopt vs having a child, because MIL was adopted. SIL and her SO ended up having a child of their own, but only after they'd adopted Oldest Nephew. Pregnancy and childbirth were so traumatic for SIL that she was like, ""Fuck this shit. I am NOT putting myself through this again."" and they were just going to have the two boys.

Then one day, when Middle Nephew was like, IDK, about 18 mos old or so, this lady from another dept at my SIL's husband's work comes up and asks if it's OK if they discuss what adoption is like, how it worked with the adoption agency they went through, etc. He's like, ""Sure. No prob.""

Turns out the lady's daughter is pregnant and wants to give the child up for adoption. SIL and her SO talk to the birthmom, walk her through what it was like for them going through the adoptive process, etc and in the end, Birthmom falls in love with SIL and her SO.  She wants THEM to adopt her baby. 

SIL was like, ""Uh....Hubs and I need to discuss this first."" 

Which they did. They weren't planning to adopt again but they talked about it and stuff and decided, ""Yeah. We gonna DO THIS.""

Because... less illness spreads to others, as they spread less viral particles when sick.

We know when you say youll stay home you still gotta stop for 10 mins at the store, you prob still will go to work, can't miss, and really you probably go to work when feeling better but still have some symptoms.

Pre covid sure that was acceptable, but afterward if others and hell even if you yourself just wear a mask when your sick say stopping at the store, or when you go back to work to early, or whatever excuse puts you in contact with others, is it really that big of an inconvenience for 5 or 10 mins? Or a couple days at work?

We effectively eliminated the flu, which does kill 60k people yearly in the states alone. Colss suck to.

I don't think anyone is being unreasonable going forward if you are sick stay home, but there will be a time people will be back at work sick and going shopping etc sick. By simply wearing a mask the rare time you are sick maybe once a year(and if everyone does it maybe once every 3 years!) For a couple days that bad?

I got the vaccine because I wanted antibodies for my baby on day 1 of my baby's birth. Since the vaccine is unlikely to be approved for babies for a while, this seemed like a good option for me. I was also fearful of the increased likelihood of complications that might occur if I became covid positive because pregnant women are higher risk. (I miscarried in the past. My miscarriage is unrelated to covid)

**Here's my ongoing list of what I've gathered. Maybe it will help:**

* This website is a really good summary of everything about the covid vaccine: https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/vaccinating-pregnant-and-lactating-patients-against-covid-19 The ACOG expects based on the mechanism of mRNA vaccines that the safety and efficacy profile for pregnant individuals would be similar to that observed in non pregnant individuals. ACOG also mentions how the covid vaccines are not live vaccines. Live vaccines are not recommended for pregnant women as those are increased risk to the baby. It's worth noting that other vaccines (like flu and tdap) are highly recommended during pregnancy.
 
* Studies in animals receiving moderna, pfizer, and J&amp;J vaccine before or during pregnancy found no safety concerns according to the CDC. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html
 
* The vsafe app is how the CDC is tracking pregnant women. So far, they are finding no correlation with pregnancy complications of women who were vaccinated compared to the general background rates of what is typical. 30,494 pregnant women have registered on the app when this report came out: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-02/28-03-01/05-covid-Shimabukuro.pdf No unexpected pregnant or infant outcomes have been observed related to covid vaccination during pregnancy. You can also see these findings summarized here as well: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2104983

* Because of the above findings in the New England Journal of Medicine, the CDC recommends that pregnant women should get vaccinated. https://www.wsj.com/articles/cdc-recommends-pregnant-women-receive-covid-19-vaccine-11619217983

* As of April 19, 2021, there's 94,000+ pregnant women vaccinated who have self reported on the Vsafe app. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafepregnancyregistry.html
 
* This one person study indicated that if a women gets vaccinated then she can pass the antibody to the baby. They found antibodies in her cord. She had one shot of the vaccine. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.03.21250579v1
 
* Here's another report of 20 women who got the vaccine and found antibodies in the cord. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.11.21253352v1
 
* Here's a report of 131 reproductive-age vaccine recipients (84 pregnant, 31 lactating, and 16 non-pregnant) and they found Vaccine-generated antibodies were present in all umbilical cord blood and breastmilk samples. These women had similar immune responses to the vaccine as nonpregnant women, suggesting that the vaccine would be just as effective for them. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.07.21253094v1
 
* And here's a report from Florida of a vaccinated pregnant woman who they found antibodies for the baby as well. https://www.cbsnews.com/news/baby-born-covid-antibodies-moderna-vaccine/?ftag=CNM-00-10aag7e
 
* The mRNA vaccine is extremely fragile (thus it's stored in cold temperatures) and short lived. It is extremely unlikely that any mRNA will be able to get into the baby or placenta. https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/mrna-covid-19-vaccine-pregnancy-breastfeeding
 
* Conversely, there are multiple studies showing that contacting covid while pregnant and being symptomatic puts you at higher risk for cesarean delivery, preterm birth, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and postpartum hemorrhage. https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/severe-covid-19-pregnancy-associated-preterm-birth-other-complications

* For example, here's a case study of how it's possible for covid to transfer to the baby via vertical transfusion. In this particular case study, the mother was ""moderately sick"" with covid at week 21. Two weeks after illness, an ultrasound scan detected abnormalities in the fetus, as described in the paper: ""Specific conditions included critical blood flow in the fetal umbilical artery, fetal growth restriction (1st percentile), right ventricular hypertrophy, hydropericardium, echo-characteristics of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (leukomalacia in periventricular area) and intraventricular hemorrhage at the 25th week of gestation."" The mother delivered at week 26 prematurely and the child passed away at 1 day and 18 hours. https://www.technologynetworks.com/proteomics/news/proteomics-confirms-vertical-transmission-of-sars-cov-2-from-mother-to-fetus-347012

* A study of more than 2,100 pregnant women across 18 countries worldwide has revealed that COVID-19 is associated with a higher risk of severe maternal and newborn complications than previously recognised. Women with COVID-19 during pregnancy were over 50% more likely to experience pregnancy complications (such as premature birth, pre-eclampsia, admission to intensive care and death) compared to pregnant women unaffected by COVID-19. Newborns of infected women were also nearly three times more at risk of severe medical complications, such as admission to a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ‚Äì mostly due to premature birth. https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-04-23-research-uncovers-high-risk-pregnant-women-covid-19
 
* Pfizer and Moderna have been studied to be effective against the NY variant. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are only marginally less protective against the variant that devastated Britain. https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/22/health/covid-ny-variant-vaccine.html

* If you're interested in vaccine safety over long term periods, I found this https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/concerns-history.html pretty eye opening. Vaccines have overall been very safe with very few recalls. It's also worth mentioning that we don't question ""long term effects"" of other vaccines. Yes, I know about the history of thalidomide. It's worth stating though that thalidomide wasn't approved by the FDA for pregnant women in the US as well as it forced drug companies to be even stricter in regards to their clinical trials.

Fomite transmission of flu suffers from the same bad science that was exposed in this past year, based on an error in droplet size that carried forward for decades.  Any respiratory disease classified as one primarily transmitted by droplets should now be assumed by default to be spread primarily by aerosols, mostly at close range.  Fomite transmission is very inefficient.  That aside, it was not thought to be a primary mode of transmission even prior to exposing the bad science at play.  [CDC says](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/spread.htm):

&gt;People with flu can spread it to others up to about 6 feet away. Most experts think that flu viruses spread mainly by droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze or talk. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Less often, a person might get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes.

At that point me and my partner we both were feeling fine (we live together and both work from home). After another two days that person messages my partner saying he took another test and it came positive. Now at this point my partner started feeling a bit ill (I mean nothing serious just some cough here and there). However, one night it was very cold and I accidentally left the window in our bedroom open so when we both woke up it was freezing. My partner woke up feeling a bit ill. For some reason I didn‚Äôt really think about that contact he had and thought he caught a cold. After that my partner‚Äôs health started to worsen. By the end of the week his fever rose to 37.5 C and he kept coughing. 
But approximately on Saturday the fever went away and only came back on Tuesday this week, however, now it was 38.5 C. We finally took two covid tests each on Wednesday and they came back positive. 
We didn‚Äôt have any direct contact with anyone so that is not an issue. What bothers me though is that tomorrow will be 14 days since that contact he had and I have been asymptomatic this whole time. How much longer should I wait till I can leave self isolation? I was thinking waiting till Monday but he is thinking of doing an official testing today and that will put another 14 days of isolation for both of us. 4 weeks of self isolation does not seem very logical to me.

""From June 3 will give the opportunity to the regions and autonomous provinces, a letter will soon leave, to open on all classes following the plan, using all points of administration, including those companies. This was said by the extraordinary commissioner to the emergency coronavirus Francesco Paolo Figliuolo during the visit to the vaccine center of Umbria Fiere.

In the plan I had already provided in March and then we are able to proceed on this class.

OVER 60 - ""To date we have administered nearly 33 million doses, of which 21 million and 800 thousand first dose and the remainder, about 11 million and 200 thousand people vaccinated - Figliuolo added - On the over 80 we have exceeded 90%, and Umbria is on target, over 70 we are above 80 percent, and Umbria is on target, over 60 on a national level we must all grow because we are around 62-63%.

[],,malleablefate,,,[],,,,text,t2_mg1r3,False,False,[],"There is a difference between ""we lose immunity over time to the SARS-CoV-2 variants which we were exposed to either by infection or vaccination"" and ""the virus mutates in such a fashion that the antibodies we have or can readily produce no longer can effectively bind it to signal for our immune system to neutralize it"". What she is talking about is the latter (which is not a guaranteed thing to happen), but it seems like a lot of people are confusing it for the former.

You can think of the antibody like a lock, and a specific virus variant (or variants) is like a key. When antibody (lock) and virus (key) bind sufficiently to each other, it signals an immune response that leads to neutralization of the virus. This article shows that the specific ""locks"" we have for the variants we were exposed to (through infection or vaccination) do not appear likely to go away. However, if the virus mutates enough, you can think of it like a ""key"" changing its shape enough that it no longer fits into the particular ""lock"" we have, and therefore our immune system isn't primed to neutralize it.

The question is how likely is the virus ""key"" able to mutate sufficiently enough that it no longer is bound readily by the antibody, i.e., that the ""key"" no longer fits into the ""lock"". And the answer to this is ""we don't know"". Many researchers have suggested that coronaviruses mutate relatively slowly, so there is a possibility that we can get enough of the population immunized before it can mutate in a way that evades our defenses (which would mean it's eliminated). Or a new variant could pop up suddenly that our vaccines and prior immunity are no match for. But again, we don't know what will happen.

I'm not sure what the argument against that is.

Anyway, there's a lot of pressure from those who have spent the last decade training to get there to be able to attend.  All of those people have been vaccinated (or possibly will have been by the time  the games begin).

There's also the small army of support staff that travel with every competitor, who will need to be vaccinated also, and everyone in Japan who is involved in the production.

This means that it's actually *fairly* safe for the games to take place, on the basis that everyone involved is vaccinated, but it would also be sensible to err on the side of caution regardless and isolate the olympic village from the rest of Japan, and not allow anyone to watch live.

Actually, it's already very unlikely that there will be anyone watching it live.  From what I've read, tickets have been sold, but nobody wants to do that because of the risk involved.

As long as the ability exists to be able to isolate the facility, so that everyone working or competing there stays within the boundaries, and does not interact with anyone or anything outside of the village, and in the event of an outbreak, they agree to wait it out and stay isolated for 14+ days, then...

&gt; Long-lived bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs) are a persistent and essential source of protective antibodies1‚Äì7. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) convalescent individuals have a significantly lower risk of reinfection8‚Äì10. Nonetheless, it has been reported that anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies experience rapid decay in the first few months after infection, raising concerns that long-lived BMPCs may not be generated and humoral immunity against this virus may be short-lived11‚Äì13. Here we demonstrate that in patients who experienced mild infections (n=77), serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) antibodies decline rapidly in the first 4 months after infection and then more gradually over the following 7 months, remaining detectable at least 11 months after infection. Anti-S antibody titers correlated with the frequency of S-specific BMPCs obtained from bone marrow aspirates of 18 SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients 7 to 8 months after infection. S-specific BMPCs were not detected in aspirates from 11 healthy subjects with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We demonstrate that S-binding BMPCs are quiescent, indicating that they are part of a long-lived compartment. Consistently, circulating resting memory B cells directed against the S protein were detected in the convalescent individuals. Overall, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a robust antigen-specific, long-lived humoral immune response in humans.",,,1622214411,{},gzrluqp,False,t3_nmwajk,False,False,t3_nmwajk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nmwajk/had_covid_youll_probably_make_antibodies_for_a/gzrluqp/,1622316667,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Your choice"" is pretty much the reality now with dominated variant B.1.617.2 that  has roughly estimate of R0 = 6, according to Dr. Norman Swan, ABC Covid Podcast.  That is very high R0 number.  No country can isolated itself away with a virus with that high R0 number.  I hope Japanese government can convey this message to its people and get everyone vaccinated over there.

""I noticed that the British government SAGE group, which is the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies with the British government, there has been emerging analysis on this over the weekend. So what they are saying is that the R0 for B117, so that's the Kent variant, is between 4.1 and 4.7, so that's the number of people without any immunization, without any control, you are likely to infect. When the Wuhan variant or what's called the ancestral virus is probably around 2.3, 2.4. So it's about double the ancestral virus.  And there's been various modelling going on in the UK by various groups, and it's estimated that at this stage, on current evidence, the 617.2 is around 40% to 50% more transmissible than B117. So that makes its R0 about 6 rather than what we were speculating on last week, which is 8, so I hope that clarifies it.""

&gt;It's true that the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines have emergency use authorization from the FDA and not full approval yet.
But that's only because not enough time has passed to show how long the vaccines stay effective, Offit said.

&gt;""Frankly, the only real difference was in length of follow-up,"" he said. ""Typically, you like to see efficacy for a year or two years.""

&gt;He stressed that the vaccines' EUA status doesn't mean they're less safe. As a member of the FDA vaccine advisory committee, Offit said the vaccines are reviewed with the same level of scrutiny as they would to get full approval.


&gt;Dr. Paul Offit, is director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia and a member of the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee.

I also miscarried in the past, so I understand your fears. (The miscarriage was not due to covid. It was due to chromosomal abnormalities which is very common in the first trimester.)

I am fully vaccinated and got the vaccine after hearing about all the complications and deaths from covid infected pregnant women. (Deaths to both the mother and child.)

I also got the vaccine after hearing about the likeability that vaccinated moms give antibodies to their baby. Considering how it will be a while before a vaccine is approved for babies, this seemed like a great option for me.

It's worth noting that the sterility rumors were debunked by the ACOG. There's no scientific evidence of this. https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/vaccinating-pregnant-and-lactating-patients-against-covid-19

**Here's my ongoing list of what I've gathered. Maybe it will help:**

* This website is a really good summary of everything about the covid vaccine: https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/vaccinating-pregnant-and-lactating-patients-against-covid-19 The ACOG expects based on the mechanism of mRNA vaccines that the safety and efficacy profile for pregnant individuals would be similar to that observed in non pregnant individuals. ACOG also mentions how the covid vaccines are not live vaccines. Live vaccines are not recommended for pregnant women as those are increased risk to the baby. It's worth noting that other vaccines (like flu and tdap) are highly recommended during pregnancy.
 
* Studies in animals receiving moderna, pfizer, and J&amp;J vaccine before or during pregnancy found no safety concerns according to the CDC. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html
 
* The vsafe app is how the CDC is tracking pregnant women. So far, they are finding no correlation with pregnancy complications of women who were vaccinated compared to the general background rates of what is typical. 30,494 pregnant women have registered on the app when this report came out: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-02/28-03-01/05-covid-Shimabukuro.pdf No unexpected pregnant or infant outcomes have been observed related to covid vaccination during pregnancy. You can also see these findings summarized here as well: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2104983

* Because of the above findings in the New England Journal of Medicine, the CDC recommends that pregnant women should get vaccinated. https://www.wsj.com/articles/cdc-recommends-pregnant-women-receive-covid-19-vaccine-11619217983

* As of April 19, 2021, there's 94,000+ pregnant women vaccinated who have self reported on the Vsafe app. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafepregnancyregistry.html
 
* This one person study indicated that if a women gets vaccinated then she can pass the antibody to the baby. They found antibodies in her cord. She had one shot of the vaccine. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.03.21250579v1
 
* Here's another report of 20 women who got the vaccine and found antibodies in the cord. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.11.21253352v1
 
* Here's a report of 131 reproductive-age vaccine recipients (84 pregnant, 31 lactating, and 16 non-pregnant) and they found Vaccine-generated antibodies were present in all umbilical cord blood and breastmilk samples. These women had similar immune responses to the vaccine as nonpregnant women, suggesting that the vaccine would be just as effective for them. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.07.21253094v1
 
* And here's a report from Florida of a vaccinated pregnant woman who they found antibodies for the baby as well. https://www.cbsnews.com/news/baby-born-covid-antibodies-moderna-vaccine/?ftag=CNM-00-10aag7e
 
* The mRNA vaccine is extremely fragile (thus it's stored in cold temperatures) and short lived. It is extremely unlikely that any mRNA will be able to get into the baby or placenta. https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/mrna-covid-19-vaccine-pregnancy-breastfeeding
 
* Conversely, there are multiple studies showing that contacting covid while pregnant and being symptomatic puts you at higher risk for cesarean delivery, preterm birth, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and postpartum hemorrhage. https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/severe-covid-19-pregnancy-associated-preterm-birth-other-complications

* For example, here's a case study of how it's possible for covid to transfer to the baby via vertical transfusion. In this particular case study, the mother was ""moderately sick"" with covid at week 21. Two weeks after illness, an ultrasound scan detected abnormalities in the fetus, as described in the paper: ""Specific conditions included critical blood flow in the fetal umbilical artery, fetal growth restriction (1st percentile), right ventricular hypertrophy, hydropericardium, echo-characteristics of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (leukomalacia in periventricular area) and intraventricular hemorrhage at the 25th week of gestation."" The mother delivered at week 26 prematurely and the child passed away at 1 day and 18 hours. https://www.technologynetworks.com/proteomics/news/proteomics-confirms-vertical-transmission-of-sars-cov-2-from-mother-to-fetus-347012

* A study of more than 2,100 pregnant women across 18 countries worldwide has revealed that COVID-19 is associated with a higher risk of severe maternal and newborn complications than previously recognised. Women with COVID-19 during pregnancy were over 50% more likely to experience pregnancy complications (such as premature birth, pre-eclampsia, admission to intensive care and death) compared to pregnant women unaffected by COVID-19. Newborns of infected women were also nearly three times more at risk of severe medical complications, such as admission to a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ‚Äì mostly due to premature birth. https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-04-23-research-uncovers-high-risk-pregnant-women-covid-19
 
* Pfizer and Moderna have been studied to be effective against the NY variant. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are only marginally less protective against the variant that devastated Britain. https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/22/health/covid-ny-variant-vaccine.html

* If you're interested in vaccine safety over long term periods, I found this https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/concerns-history.html pretty eye opening. Vaccines have overall been very safe with very few recalls. It's also worth mentioning that we don't question ""long term effects"" of other vaccines. Yes, I know about the history of thalidomide. It's worth stating though that thalidomide wasn't approved by the FDA for pregnant women in the US as well as it forced drug companies to be even stricter in regards to their clinical trials.

It‚Äôs not just Chinese virology labs that screw up the handling of potentially planet-altering pathogens. All over the world, virology labs have similarly overseen security breaches with the potential to infect millions.

In 2014 it emerged that labs connected to the U.S. Centres for Disease Control were guilty of, among other things, accidentally exposing a bunch of researchers to anthrax and losing vials of smallpox, the now-extinct virus that ranks as the deadliest disease in human history.

Lab leaks have caused several verified disease outbreaks. In 1977, a strange flu began surging through the Soviet Union and China. Subsequent analysis of the virus concluded that it was exactly the same as a 1949 flu strain, raising suspicions that the outbreak had been caused by an escape from a laboratory freezer. History‚Äôs last victim of smallpox, British woman Janet Parker, was killed by a 1978 lab screw-up at Birmingham University.

There have even been two lab leaks of SARS in the months after the disease‚Äôs 2003 outbreak had been contained. One was a student who accidentally picked up the disease in August, 2003 at a lab at the National University of Singapore. The other was a SARS researcher who fell ill after handling biohazardous waste without gloves or a mask.In March, Robert Redfield, former director of the Centres for Disease Control, became one of the most prominent early backers of the ‚Äúlab leak‚Äù theory when he told CNN that ‚Äúthe most likely etiology of this pathology in Wuhan was from a laboratory.‚Äù

It sounds like Australia made the mistake of relying on just one major source for vaccines and that was AZ because they have manufacturing there for it.    Then here was the blood clot issues and recommendations were made that only over 50s use it.  They then had to scramble to secure more doses from other manufacturers.  So unlike Canada, that very early on secured supply from almost all the major manufacturers, Australia had to pivot and then up it's order of other vaccines because of the AZ issue.   And they did do that so that doesn't sound like they are being the good guy here.   But now with much of the worlds production secured for the near future they have to wait.    I mean it sounds like it has been a massive shit show.    It looks like they relied on AZ so heavily that they didn't even bother to get contacts with Moderna and it hasn't even been approved for use by Australia.    Meanwhile in Canada AZ, Moderna, Pfizer, Janssen are all approved  and supply of all of  them was secured way before approval was done.

Currently circulating coronaviruses do not.  Novel coronaviruses do.

Once the coronaviruses circulate through a human population, they continue to infect children with mild disease, who then have long-term immunity to severe disease.  Waning antibodies is a feature of this dynamic.
