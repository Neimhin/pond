1) At the gate with the auxiliary power unit off and engine off - air is provided by an external air conditioning unit sitting on the apron (aka tarmac). This air is typically drawn from the outside, conditioned in the pack, and then brought to the plane via a big yellow tube you can see lying on the ground. 
2) At the gate with the APU or engines on - this air is cooled by the plane and typically primarily recirc with some external air. 

The only time the air is not fresh outside air or going through recirc is the brief period of time that they are disconnecting the external air and starting up the APU and/or engines. This is typically a couple of minutes at most.

young people particularly kids are expected to have such a strong innane response to infections that they may only respond innately and not form any humoral response and therefore not seroconvert.

a low infectious dose of virus may also not produce high enough viral loads initially and the humoral immune system may be able to prevent the progression of the infection so it remains asymtomatic and the humoral response to the infection is never stimulated.

vaccination doesn't stimulate any innate response and that allows the humoral memory response to form and antibodies to be created, and that is consistent.  there's nothing particularly unusual there in that some people exposed to the virus enough to be positive on rtPCR would not form antibodies and that was expected.  and those aren't likely people who *cannot* form a humoral response to natural infection -- send them into a COVID ward without any PPE and they'd get naturally infected, possibly quite severely, and then have a humoral response and form antibodies -- but it is safer for them to just get vaccinated.

We aren't though and we never will be. There are plenty of people that have already proven that they would literally rather die than get vaccinated. The US is currently under 60% vaccinated and there is no shortage of vaccine available. Lots of anti-vaxxers have already been caught trying to fake vaccination status. There is no federal database connected to an easy to use app or website to verify vaccination status. Many places that are supposed to check either don't do more than glance at the card or don't even bother to check. Enforcement just isn't reliable.

Then there are the immune compromised for which vaccination does very little. There are also all of the children who are too young to be vaccinated, or whose parents won't let them.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Given that cloth masking has an estimated efficacy of around 10% and those vaccinated with Pfizer showed a 20% decrease in covid transmission after infection..

Cloth masks aren't the only kind of masks and N95 and KN95 masks have been readily available for a long time and are substantially better at both preventing spread and infection. If everyone wore a KN95 or better mask correctly it would be far better than vaccination.

Vaccination protection also wanes significantly, thus the need for boosters. The article you linked even explicitly states that they saw a significant rise in transmission over time. Some people have been ""vaccinated"" for almost a year at this point and I'm sure that their decrease of covid transimission is no longer at 20%.

Point being, it isn't clear cut at all that vaccines prevent spread better or worse than masks. The example you picked was the worst quality of masks compared to vaccine efficacy before it starts to wane, which isn't a great comparison. We are nowhere near the level of vaccination or case numbers where we don't need masks anymore. Yes it is almost exclusively due to anti-vaxxers, but unfortunately that doesn't seem like it is changing any time soon. Which brings me to a very important reason to keep mask mandates; even in places where they are ""required to check vaccination status"" I still can't be confident that it is actually being enforced, but I can see if someone is wearing a mask or not.",,,,1637128146,{},hkyf2o5,False,t3_qvcejk,False,False,t1_hky2qrq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qvcejk/dc_to_lift_indoor_mask_mandate_next_week/hkyf2o5/,1637455716.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I also forgot exactly what sterilising immunity was when I posted but would I be right in saying that my post is correct if it were referring to non-sterilising immunity. ie. we all ultimately have to develop a Memory B and T Cell response to the 50 or so 'Cold' causing viruses and that my 10 years without a single symptomatic respiratory infection is an indication that I have crossed that 50+ threshold?

&amp;#x200B;

WRT to repeated Asymptomatic SarsCov2 infection that my deleted paragraph was about. I certainly stopped worrying as much in Summer 2020 when I read about the experts theories about why kids were invariably asymptomatic. The theory being that they are exposed to many more pathogens in the school environment and much more recently than most adults and that perhaps there was some level of cross immunity to SarsCov2 due the kids recent exposure to one or all of the Cold causing Coronoviruses. Studies over the last year have shown that rather than cross immunity to the actual virus spike protein it was likely cross immunity due to Memory B and T cell response to certain protein expression on the surface of infected cells that were common to both the Cold causing corona viruses and SarsCov2. A recent thread here was actually about Gen 2.0 Covid vaccines also targeting these expressed proteins on the surface of infected cells. 

Anyway, I reasoned that despite being an adult, my job likely meant I too had repeated exposure and much more recently to most or all of the Cold causing Corona viruses nevermind all the Rino and Adeno's. Hence an immune system ready to fight off SarsCov2 once infected before I became symptomatic. Add to that likely repeated infection with the original, Alpha and Delta variant topping up my B/T and Antibody response, then the vaccines and soon a booster, and in all likelihood by blood is thick with antibodies. LOL

I did succeed in calming the nerves of most of my family back in Summer 2020 except my mother who lives with us and only now that what I said above has been confirmed in studies and mentioned on the news, has my mother relaxed...and said, ""OMG, thats what you were saying back in Summer 2020!!"".

No one had ever been able to prove a last side effect of any vaccine, ever. They're designed to get in, deliver their ""instructions"" for making anti-bodies, and then quickly get flushed from your system. Vaccines don't stick around in the body long enough to cause long-term health complications.

*Treatments* are another story, however. They're designed to build up to a certain level in your body, stay there for the duration of the treatment, and then get flushed out according to whatever their half-life is.

[],,Elephonitron,,,[],,,,text,t2_5c29l,False,False,[],"Although this research study is still awaiting peer review, its findings are quite interesting. A few key findings that stood out to me:


- Cannabidiol (CBD) is a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.

- Results showed limited or no inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection by Cannabinoids **other than CBD.**

- Analysis of over 93,000 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 at the University of Chicago Medical Center showed that 10.0% tested positive overall, but only 5.7% of the ~400 who had any cannabinoid in their medical record tested positive.

- Patients taking CBD versus other cannabinoids had an even lower rate of testing positive (1.2% in 85 CBD patients versus 7.1% in 113 patients taking other cannabinoids, p=0.08).

The most interesting finding to me was how they matched patients in their sample to account for variance:

- Since multiple potential confounding factors could explain these findings, including age, race, clinical morbidities, and sex, we matched 82 patients who were prescribed oral, FDA-approved CBD (Epidiolex¬Æ) before COVID-19 testing to patients who had no indication of taking any cannabinoids but had comparable other characteristics including similar demographic characteristics, clinical comorbidities, and records of other medications in the two years before COVID-19 testing. 

- Of the patients prescribed oral CBD before their COVID-19 test, the most common morbidity categories were hypertension and conditions with immunosuppression. Strikingly, **only 1.2% of the patients prescribed CBD contracted SARS-CoV-2 whereas 12.2% of the matched, non-cannabinoid patients tested positive** (p=0.009), suggesting a potential reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infection risk of approximately an order of magnitude.

Hope y'all find this interesting. 

As I've understood this preliminary study, the results suggest that high doses of CBD are significantly correlated with a reduction in COVID-19 positivity and may block infection at early stages. However, the inability to source high-quality CBD products due to a lack of regulatory oversight makes it hard to recommend taking a bunch of CBD to reduce one's chance of contracting this virus.",,,,1637106539,{},hkx5l7c,True,t3_qvlewm,False,True,t3_qvlewm,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qvlewm/cbd_inhibits_sarscov2_replication_and_promotes/hkx5l7c/,1637430197.0,25,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;""**Face masks protect against COVID-19.** That‚Äôs the conclusion of a gold-standard clinical trial in Bangladesh, which backs up the findings of hundreds of previous observational and laboratory studies.1.Critics of mask mandates have cited the lack of relevant randomized clinical trials, which assign participants at random to either a control group or an intervention group. But the latest finding is based on a randomized trial involving nearly 350,000 people across rural Bangladesh. The study‚Äôs authors found that surgical masks ‚Äî but not cloth masks ‚Äî reduced transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in villages where the research team distributed face masks and promoted their use.***‚ÄúThis really should be the end of the debate,‚Äù says Ashley Styczynski, an infectious-disease researcher at Stanford University in California and a co-author of the preprint describing the trial. The research ‚Äútakes things a step further in terms of scientific rigour‚Äù, says Deepak Bhatt, a medical researcher at Harvard Medical School*** in Boston, Massachusetts, who has published research on masking.""

&gt;Data was collected throughout Armenia between April 8 and May 4, 2021 through phone interviews, with respondents selected by automatized random digit dialing (RDD) probability sampling of mobile phone numbers. The national sample consisted of 1,203 permanent residents of Armenia aged 18 and older, plus an additional 299 oversample respondents in specific regions. It is representative of the population aged 18 and older with access to a mobile phone. The margin of error does not exceed plus or minus 2.5 points for the full sample. The response rate was 37 %. The Survey was funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development.

Many of us have been concerned that people will forgo wearing masks because they fear that they won't protect without a professional fit test.  A non-fit tested mask can fit tight enough to give better filtration than a procedure or cloth mask.  Even NIOSH allows some degree of leakage in masks that become N95 authorized.

Yes, because people usually do breaks to do chores and because of that stay a little late. And companies never asked their employees to work overtime before, right?

Yeah, because food from restaurants around offices are very healthy.   


\-People aren't collaborating!!!!

This never happened before in most offices.   


\-People are depressed!!!!!

Yes, it's all home office's fault, not because of a pandemic.

\-People use the time in the office to move around and exercise!!!!

You can do that in your home.

The Leuven Rega Institute team, led by virologist Johan Neyts, is working on a ‚Äúvaccine version 2.0,‚Äù which Neyts is said to be effective against the alpha, beta and gamma variants, as well as the newer and more dangerous delta variant.  
‚ÄúWe administered the coronavirus to hamsters via the nose. In the animals that were not vaccinated, we subsequently found a lot of virus in the lungs,‚Äù Neyts told De Morgen.  
‚ÄúBut in the vaccinated hamsters, we did not find a single virus particle in the lungs. It didn‚Äôt matter which strain they were infected with. Our candidate vaccine works against the four main variants,‚Äù he said, adding that, as far as he knows, this is the first time a vaccine that works against all variants has been developed.  
This announcement is especially promising as many European countries are in the midst of a fourth wave driven by the delta variant, which has become the dominant strain in most countries. In Belgium, more than 95% of infections are from the delta variant, which is infecting an increasing number of people ‚Äì even some who have been vaccinated.  
Meanwhile, a recent study analysing the effectiveness of the existing vaccines against the delta variant showed that the Pfizer vaccine offered better protection against the particular mutation than the AstraZeneca vaccine, but that both vaccines were less effective against the delta variant than against the alpha variant.  
Relying on another virus  
Neyts‚Äô vaccine is a so-called viral vector vaccine, similar to the AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines. It uses a modified version of a virus (a vector) to deliver genetic instructions to the body‚Äôs cells, which in turn produce harmless pieces of the virus called antigens to trigger an immune response in the body.  
This latest development uses another transmitter, namely the yellow fever vaccine, which consists of a highly reduced version of the yellow fever virus, and of which the vaccine load is the spike protein of the coronavirus, resulting in antibodies being created not only against the coronavirus but also against the yellow fever virus.  
Neyts stressed that this does not mean that the current vaccines do not work ‚Äì despite the infection rate being as high as in November last year, hospitalisations and deaths are still lower ‚Äì  but added that ‚Äúwe could do even better with vaccines version 2.0, which are adapted to the delta variant and other variants.‚Äù  
The team now hopes that companies will invest in the vaccine candidate, as hundreds of millions of euros will soon be needed to produce it on a large scale and to test it on humans.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I have no doubt this vaccine will be safe and effective, but getting it funded through mass production will be a challenge given the myriad other options available and updated/new vaccines coming next year (including Novavax). The Yellow Fever aspect, though, may make it interesting for distribution in Africa and South America.

It‚Äôs been almost two years since the pandemic began and our numbers have consistently shown that we‚Äôve done miles better than major western countries.

From what I understand Japan was very loose with any kind of covid mitigations, it sounded like they pretty much let everything run as normal through most of 2020 and 2021 up until the Delta wave.  Given that we've generally seen massive outbreaks in other parts of the world that were this hands-off with their strategies, it doesn't seem to make sense that Japan would somehow have just sailed through the pandemic with hardly any effect while not even having to try very hard to stop the virus.  I know masks are more commonly used there but I can't see that alone being the difference-maker; we've seen that mask-wearing alone with few or no mitigations hasn't been enough to stop the virus from surging, especially with Delta.  There were countries in Europe with very high mask acceptance in addition to strong restrictions that would have reduced mingling, and those countries still were overwhelmed.  

I think the numbers from Japan so far seem to look legit, but I also don't think it can be explained by saying Japan was just that great at handling the pandemic; I would strongly suspect that there are other factors involved that aren't well understood yet.  It's also notable to me that we tend to see the same relatively low numbers across pretty much all of Asia, which comprises a wide range of cultures and different covid strategies.

[],,helembad,,,[],,,,text,t2_s0xb5,False,False,[],"New Covid-19 restrictions in the Republic of Ireland are due to ""another surge"" of the virus, the taoiseach (Irish prime minister) has said.

Miche√°l Martin said the ""advice is now that everyone should work from home unless it is absolutely necessary"".

Workers began to return to offices in September when restrictions were eased.

Mr Martin also confirmed an earlier closing time of midnight for bars, restaurants and nightclubs from Thursday.

Ministers made the decision as senior government figures fear further restrictions may be needed.

Mr Martin, speaking in a TV address on Tuesday night, said if the number of Covid infections continues to grow at the current rate ""no health system would be able to cope"".

""This is the fourth surge - but it is different - and the vaccination programme has allowed us to keep society open,"" Mr Martin said.

He also announced that Covid-19 close contacts who are fully vaccinated and showing no symptoms should restrict their movements until they have three negative test results within five days.

Covid-19 vaccine passes will be required for entry to cinemas and theatres but not for gyms and hairdressers.

Another 4,570 cases of coronavirus were reported in Ireland on Monday, up from 3,805 on Sunday.

The total number of deaths linked to Covid-19 in the Republic of Ireland since the start of the pandemic is 5,566.

The earlier closing time for all restaurants, pubs and nightclubs will come into effect from Thursday at midnight.

That reverses the return to normal opening hours on 22 October, which had brought an end to an 23:30 curfew that had been operating since Covid-19 restrictions were lifted in July to allow hospitality premises to serve customers indoors.

Pubs and nightclubs are ordinarily able to serve alcohol until 00:30 on Fridays and Saturdays, while those with a late licence can serve alcohol up until 02:30.

The head of the Licensed Vintners Association (LVA) said the decision would be ""will be extraordinarily difficult for those working in late bars, nightclubs and the rest of the late night sector and will place considerable pressures on livelihoods in the run up to Christmas"".

The Restaurants Association of Ireland called for business supports for the hospitality industry to be re-introduced.

Its chief executive, Adrian Cummins, told Irish broadcaster RT√â that antigen testing needs to be ramped up and the message to reduce socialising is hurting hospitality venues, with more cancellations in restaurants and bars.

With about 90% of over-12s fully vaccinated against Covid-19, the Republic of Ireland has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world.

There are plans to give boosters to all over 60s.

In a social media post, Ireland's chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said: ""In the last 14 days, we have been notified of almost 55,000 cases of Covid-19.

""The only time we have had more cases in a 14-day period was in January this year, and, unfortunately, we do expect this figure to increase in the coming days.""",,,,1637132361,{},hkylcmy,True,t3_qvtg6u,False,False,t3_qvtg6u,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qvtg6u/pubs_curfew_and_working_from_home_return_in/hkylcmy/,1637459124.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I agree that the federal government has never mandated a vaccine before. I‚Äôve agreed like 5 times about that now.

Up until this post, you keep arguing that because it‚Äôs never happened before, it must be illegal, which I contend is not true as all of the requisite parts have happened before, just not in this particular combination.

The irony of accusing me of acting like a kid while having tunnel vision. So narrow that you believe you just saying flatly that you know beyond the shadow of a doubt  and being condescending about it is somehow on the same as me saying that neither of us truly knows but being happy to have differing ideas is staggering.

There are plain facts in this world that would be stupid to argue over. This is not one of them. The legality of a federal vaccine mandate is not the same as gravity. 

I insist that you have no idea what you are talking about because literally anyone who speaks with such confidence on a political issue that is so clearly objectively grey means you‚Äôre either a political hack job or ignorant, and I like to give people the benefit of the doubt.

In retrospect, maybe you‚Äôre just applying your personal politics to the matter and can‚Äôt fathom that there are more options than the one you like.

- To get a good seal, I need to pull the straps really tight, digging into my face. If I wear the mask for a full day, I get a pressure sore on the bridge of my nose. Possibly my mask is the wrong size.
- I have a big bulbous schnozz, so the mask presses down on the tip of my nose, crooking it.
- This is very vain, but I don't like having to shave my beard off for a good seal.

In a statement on Tuesday, the association of regional health services in the Netherlands called the increase in demand for new testing appointments ‚Äúexplosive,‚Äù adding that it was taking the approach of ‚Äúall hands on deck.‚Äù

Officials said that they aimed to reach up to 120,000 tests a day, depending on workers‚Äô availability. On Monday, at least 116,000 new appointments were scheduled and 91,000 people were tested ‚Äî new daily records ‚Äî according to Jaap Eikelboom, a Covid program director for the health service association.

‚ÄúWe are reaching the maximum of our capacity on all sides,‚Äù he said.

Virus cases have been rising in the Netherlands, with more than 110,000 people testing positive over the past week, an increase of almost 44 percent compared with the week before, according to official figures. Last week, the government announced a national partial lockdown for three weeks, including limited operating hours for restaurants, bars and shops.

It is also now largely impossible to book most Covid testing appointments online because of the high demand, the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant reported, saying that there was only one place in the Netherlands ‚Äî in the southern province of Zeeland ‚Äî where people were able to do so.

Speaking at a news conference this month, Prime Minister Mark Rutte hailed the importance of testing to stop the spread of the virus, even for people who are vaccinated.

The investment is the first step in a new plan, to be announced on Wednesday, for the government to partner with industry to address immediate vaccine needs overseas and domestically and to prepare for future pandemics, said Dr. David Kessler, who oversees vaccine distribution for the administration, and Jeff Zients, Mr. Biden‚Äôs coronavirus response coordinator.

‚ÄúThis is about assuring expanded capacity against Covid variants and also preparing for the next pandemic,‚Äù Dr. Kessler said. ‚ÄúThe goal, in the case of a future pandemic, a future virus, is to have vaccine capability within six to nine months of identification of that pandemic pathogen, and to have enough vaccines for all Americans.‚Äù

The idea for the new public-private partnership is still in its early stages, and the price tag is uncertain. Dr. Kessler, who has been working on the proposal for months, estimated it at ‚Äúseveral billion.‚Äù The money has been set aside as part of the American Rescue Plan, the $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package that Mr. Biden signed into law in March.

The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Agency intends to issue a ‚Äúrequest for information‚Äù to solicit ideas from companies that have experience manufacturing vaccines using mRNA technology. Mr. Zients said that officials wanted responses ‚Äúin a very short period of time, 30 days, to understand how most efficiently, effectively and reliably we can increase manufacturing.‚Äù

Activists, many of them veterans of the AIDS epidemic, have been demanding for months that Mr. Biden do more to scale up global vaccine manufacturing capacity. Some, furious with what they regard as the administration‚Äôs slow progress, turned up at the home of Ron Klain, Mr. Biden‚Äôs chief of staff, in September and deposited a fake mountain of bones on the sidewalk in protest.

At the same time, the administration is offering booster shots to millions of vaccinated Americans, despite criticism from World Health Organization officials and other experts who say the doses should go to low- and lower-middle-income countries first. The Food and Drug Administration is aiming to authorize booster doses of Pfizer-BioNTech‚Äôs Covid vaccine for all adults as early as Thursday, according to people familiar with the agency‚Äôs plans.

Whether the new Biden plan will satisfy the administration‚Äôs critics is unclear. Many activists have demanded that the administration build up manufacturing capacity overseas, particularly in Africa, but the Biden plan is focused on building capacity among domestic vaccine makers.

‚ÄúThis effort is specifically aimed at building U.S. domestic capacity,‚Äù Dr. Kessler said. ‚ÄúBut that capacity is important not only for the U.S. supply, but for global supply.‚Äù

It is genetically very distant from any previously discovered sequence, which led to speculation that it was the result of a chronic infection. However, since then, more samples have been found with a much higher level of genetic variation than you'd expect if that was the case -- it seems this variant is likely pretty widespread in an area of Africa that doesn't perform sequencing.

There's only a small number of cases at the moment, with no evidence of sustained growth in any country that performs much sequencing, so this is absolutely one that is only getting attention because of its genetic makeup. However it's also been imported quite a few times in the last 3 weeks, so it's definitely not extinct or anything.

The short-term effectiveness of a two-dose regimen of the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine was widely demonstrated.

Leveraging the centralized computerized database of Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), we assessed the correlation between time-from-vaccine and incidence of breakthrough infection between June 1 and July 27, the date of analysis. After controlling for potential confounders as age and comorbidities, we found a significant 1.51 fold (95% CI, 1.38‚Äì1.66) increased risk for infection for early vaccinees compared to those vaccinated later that was similar across all ages groups. The increased risk reached 2.26- fold (95% CI, 1.80‚Äì3.01) when comparing those who were vaccinated in January to those vaccinated in April.

Background: Respiratory protective equipment recommended in the UK for healthcare workers (HCWs) caring for patients with COVID-19 comprises a fluid resistant surgical mask (FRSM), except in the context of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs). We previously demonstrated frequent pauci- and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection HCWs during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, using a comprehensive PCR-based HCW screening programme (Rivett et al., 2020; Jones et al., 2020).  
  
Methods: Here, we use observational data and mathematical modelling to analyse infection rates amongst HCWs working on 'red' (COVID-19) and 'green' (non-COVID-19) wards during the second wave of the pandemic, before and after the substitution of filtering face piece 3 (FFP3) respirators for FRSMs.  
  
Results: Whilst using FRSMs, HCWs working on red wards faced an approximately 31-fold (and at least 5-fold) increased risk of direct, ward-based infection. Conversely, after changing to FFP3 respirators, this risk was significantly reduced (52-100% protection).  
  
Conclusions: FFP3 respirators may therefore provide more effective protection than FRSMs for healthcare workers caring for patients with COVID-19, whether or not AGPs are undertaken.",,,,1637161641,{},hkztjyw,True,t3_qw19r2,False,False,t3_qw19r2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qw19r2/efficacy_of_ffp3_respirators_for_prevention_of/hkztjyw/,1637482462.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Styczynski and her colleagues began by developing a strategy to promote mask wearing, with measures such as reminders from health workers in public places. This ultimately tripled mask usage, from only 13% in control villages to 42% in villages where it was encouraged. The researchers then compared numbers of COVID-19 cases in control villages and the treatment communities.

The team found that the number of symptomatic cases was lower in treatment villages than in control villages. The decrease was a modest 9%, but the researchers suggest that the true risk reduction is probably much greater, in part because they did no SARS-CoV-2 testing of people without symptoms or whose symptoms did not meet the World Health Organization‚Äôs definition of the disease.""

Then you need a molecule that binds to it, is efficient to permit for low enough dosage, is tolerated well by humans, and ideally is shelf-stable in pill form.

A similar tactic may eventually lead us to a universal coronavirus vaccine.

I wore a mask, and I got so many bizarre looks from my coworkers- Covid wasn't on people's radars here at the time. I ended up with Covid about a month later, and again in December of 2020, so I had pneumonia three times in a calendar year.

I used to work on pediatrics and I never got RSV despite so many kids coming down with it- as an adult, it's not super easy to get, but when you do, it's so rough. I remember a bunch of my friends who also got it swore they had Covid, but RSV was sweeping through that area pretty intensely at the time.

I got the full dose of Pfizer as a third shot a few weeks ago because I'm immune compromised from the medications I take for my lungs that Covid damaged.

But you have some seriously fundamental misunderstandings here about Japan. 

Firstly: SARS never hit Japan. They were entirely spared SARS in 2003. I should know, I was living there at the time. No SARS. It did cause them to think some policy stuff through, but Japan never got hit with SARS like HK or Singapore or Taiwan. Zero cases. 

Secondly: Japanese aren't blind rule followers. The fact is that even the LDP (and the various ministries there) aren't entirely sure why Japan is largely being spared. Nor do actual health officials. Arguing that it's some inherent cultural trait misses a LOT, and as anyone who's lived there knows, they aren't always super pro-elder, either. Lots of old people in Japan die alone and lonely. 

Finally: I'm stressing that we just don't know. And that's okay. But for instance I can tell you that it wasn't lockdowns. It wasn't masking per se. We just don't know. We do know that testing in Japan has been much lower per capita than other countries, and Japan has largely forbidden travel without quarantines. But masks and elder respect? Super doubtful if you know about how things work there.

This pill, in order for it to be effective, must be taken within 2-3 days after knowing you have COVID and recognizing onset. That would require you to recognize symptoms, get tested within 48 hours of testing, and then be able to get the pill in your system immediately. 

If you wait a week, it's too late. So if a prescription is required, the pill certainly will not reach those most in need on-time. Most doctors don't write prescriptions immediately upon request or even diagnosis, and even if they did it could days after getting the prescription to actually get the medicine at your local pharmacy, shortages aside. So unless this pill is going to be over-the-counter, I doubt it will have any noticeable impact other than emotional encouragement that the means for improved therapeutic is there, but just not in wide use yet. 

I'm guessing another several months before it will be approved for wide-use, then another few months before it'll be available for prescription, then another few months before it'll be available as a over-the-counter. Hope I'm wrong.

No.  Immunity wanes in 10-18 months typically.  Repeat infection is absolutely a thing with COVID.  And ""natural"" immunity is vastly less consistent and robust than vaccinated immunity.

For example people lost their shit over me saying that vaccines don't prevent the spread of covid. However, would you feel comfortable with people being told that getting the vaccine will prevent them from spreading covid?

Even you said ""stop the spread"", but that's not really correct. It will on average slow the spread. It will not in every instance stop covid spreading from one person to another, because breakthrough cases are a thing and people with breakthrough cases are in fact contagious.

The argument you are making is also super over-simplified. The background infection rate of the population makes a huge difference in how effective just being vaccinated versus just wearing a mask is.

The point being that saying vaccines don't ""stop the spread"" isn't a narrative, it is a factually true statement, because saying they ""stop the spread"" is an overstatement. Overstatements are dangerous because they cause us to become ill-informed as well as giving anti-vaxxers ammo; ""If it stops the spread why are there high case rates in highly vaccinated areas?"" or some other dumb shit.

IMO this is a stupid argument to be having. Most places in the US, and the world as a whole, are not doing well enough to be considering not pushing on both mask and vaccines. Still some places are getting rid of mask mandates or ""easing"" them as they are actively experiencing surges (New York).",,,,1637114598,{},hkxnwe2,False,t3_qvcejk,False,True,t1_hkx9owd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qvcejk/dc_to_lift_indoor_mask_mandate_next_week/hkxnwe2/,1637440632.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FedEx said that it would continue delivery services as usual in Hong Kong, and did not specify where its crew would move. The South China Morning Post, citing a FedEx memo, reported that the routes would be flown by workers based in Oakland, Calif., where 180 Hong Kong-based pilots had relocated early this year.

Hong Kong has been successful at controlling the spread of the coronavirus, with just 213 deaths in a city of 7.5 million. But the tough restrictions on travel have grated on many and spurred criticism from some businesses that rely on the swift movement of goods and people.

This week Hong Kong ordered 130 Cathay Pacific cargo pilots to undergo three weeks of quarantine because they had stayed at a hotel near Frankfurt where three crew members who tested positive for the coronavirus had also resided.

Carrie Lam, Hong Kong‚Äôs chief executive, acknowledged on Tuesday that the quarantine orders put strains on freight companies and highlighted the city‚Äôs dependence on goods brought in from overseas and mainland China.

‚ÄúIf there are one or two more such incidents, our freight planes will have no pilots,‚Äù she said.

Also on Wednesday, Tara Joseph, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, said that she was stepping down, a decision that she partly attributed to the difficulties created by the city‚Äôs coronavirus control measures.

‚ÄúI think the quarantine rules are a huge red line for many people, including myself,‚Äù said Ms. Joseph, who is currently in the United States. She said she planned to stay in her role until the chamber found a replacement.

Earlier this year, Alan Beebe and Ker Gibbs, the presidents of the American chambers of commerce in Beijing and Shanghai, said they were resigning from their roles.

Hong Kong‚Äôs quarantine rules have weighed on global companies with a presence in the city. The restrictions were making it hard to retain talent, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said this week during a short visit to the city. He was one of a small number of executives who have been granted a quarantine exemption.",,,,1637158627,{},hkzmslx,True,t3_qw07om,False,True,t3_qw07om,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qw07om/fedex_citing_quarantine_rules_will_close_its_crew/hkzmslx/,1637478997.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pasting this from my comment on another thread, because I'm too lazy to paraphrase:   


Efficacy likely declined ""fast"" because of two (hopefully) one-time factors: a big change to viral fitness (delta) \*and\* a very sub-optimal initial vaccine interval. It's looking like 3/4 weeks was just not enough time in between doses to get optimal long-term immunity. We'll obviously have to wait and see how things pan out, but getting a 3rd dose 6 months out is fundamentally different than getting your second dose a few weeks after an initial one. Plenty of vaccines have multiple doses spread out over a year or two, and then you're set for life. Not to mention, incidental exposure in vaccinated individuals is likely to act as sort of a 'natural' booster. The only scenario in which I can see us needing boosters that frequently is a zoonotic spillback event (from deer, most likely) where we get another mutation on the scale of delta, but we'll have to wait and see what happens with that situation.",,,,1637164067,{},hkzzet3,False,t3_qw0hqh,False,False,t1_hkztkh7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qw0hqh/fauci_says_3shot_vaccine_should_be_standard_warns/hkzzet3/,1637485481.0,66,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whats more likely now is that were going to see variants of the delta variant itself start popping up since it already accounts for 60-90% of new Covid infections. 

Like I said, I agree that there isn't a Zero Covid scenario with the virus already being as virulent and infectious as it is. Its going to eventually be treated like influenza, with yearly vaccines and always the risk of more severe strains/variants than the average popping up once in a while.

 The biggest risk factor i see is how so many different animals can contract and spread covid due to the virus using the ACE-2 receptor to gain entry into cells. Even if by some miracle, we do get to zero or virtually zero human cases of covid, it can find its way back into circulation due to it being able to have so many animal hosts around the world. 

Another big threat with that is the threat of hybridization. There are hundreds of known animal coronaviruses, many of which were only isolated/discovered in the last 20 years thanks to enhanced interest and research into them due to the 2003 SARS-1 outbreak. There are likely thousands of animal coronaviruses in bats, birds, deer, rodents, etc that remain unknown. With SARS CoV-2 being able to infect such a large amount of species, there's a chance that it can infect an animal which is simultaneously infected with a known or unknown animal borne coronavirus similar enough to covid that the two viral strains replicating in the same cells swap some genes through antigenic shift and out comes a new Coronavirus with traits from the animal strain that didn't really harm the mouse, bat, pig, or deer it usually infects, but causes more severe illnesses in humans who have less immunity towards it.

Yeah here it is:

‚ÄúMany of these mutations were found to expand the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses by allowing infection of cells expressing the human, mouse, or rat ACE2 receptor. In addition, pseudoviruses containing the Spike amino acid sequence of these lineages were found to be resistant to many different classes of receptor binding domain (RBD) binding neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. We offer several hypotheses for the anomalous presence of these mutations, including the possibility of a non-human animal reservoir. Although wastewater sampling cannot provide direct inference of SARS-CoV-2 clinical sequences, our research revealed several lineages that could be relevant to public health and they would not have been discovered if not for wastewater surveillance.‚Äù

So I think these people complaining about the messaging are just not that bright. Or else they'll cling to any reasoning, however shoddy, to bolster whatever it is they *want* to believe. Which is patently disingenuous, and I honestly don't know how these people sleep at night. Except that they're probably not bright enough to realize how dumb they are.

Yes, I agree that the messaging has been frustrating to follow, but there's only so much we can control in a situation where we really just don't know what we're dealing with, and learning as we go.

I maybe wrong but it isn't as 'set' as something like chicken pox or measles where one vaccine cures it.
  
At the same time I saw a few theories that our bodies could develop the memory cells to protect us from 'any' form of covid in about 18months or longer from an initial infection.  I haven't dug into to see what if any data supporting/investigating that has been done recently (September or August would be about 18 months from initial infection but most people weren't getting it until march or later so september/october to start a study.
  
I think what lends more credibility to an annual covid vaccine is that it is being helped to mutate by those unwilling to get vaccinated.  We know from recent history that people opting out of vaccines brought back measles, mumps, tb so that's another factor in thinking without any investigation (and I may be wrong on what I read vs what is current) that covid is going to need a yearly booster/shot etc.

Lots of vaccines require boosters.  For instance, tetanus is every ten years.  Flu is every year, but part of that is because it mutates and different strains predominate at different times. 

We are almost certainly looking at needing annual boosters for this type of coronavirus indefinitely and probably even twice-yearly for the foreseeable future.  Of course, future mutations may change that for better or worse.

My concern is the fact that Fauci is covered regularly, given a massive platform and every media outlet covers every word he says like he‚Äôs the President. 

I fear that too many people hang on his every comment, and those people are loud enough to force business and public spaces to cater to their low risk tolerances and fear. 

We have that too where I live. In Ontario, we have ~ 500 cases per day in a province of 14M (funny enough, still not low enough per capita for normal under Fauci‚Äôs criteria‚Ä¶). We have Doctors on TV telling everyone to panic, telling government to re-impose capacity limits. We have something like 90% of the eligible population vaccinated with at least one dose. What does this do? Well, it causes the 10% or the population who are extremely risk averse to start writing to their government officials *begging* for more restrictions. We *already* have universal mask mandates. What happens? The government listens and pauses re-opening, and I bet they reimpose capacity restrictions by Christmas.

This virus *is brand new*.  Frankly, it's a god damn miracle that we have a multitude of effective, working vaccines this quickly.  If this had hit fifty years ago it would have taken years and years (and perhaps a decade) to develop a vaccine.

And they \*never\* said the vaccine would make you ""immune"".  For the very start the standard for the virus was protection from severe symptoms, hospitalization and death.  Period.  They didn't even *test* for whether it would prevent infections initially because those tests take longer.  They have since discovered that most of the vaccines reduce transmission and infection by about 8X+ versus someone who is non vaccinated, but that is relatively new information.

It took *time* to figure out the main way(s) the virus was being spread.  Was it by touch?  Was it via the air?  Via aerosoled virus or droplets?  As they narrowed it down to it mostly being spread by droplets in public situations, then masks became an important tool.   As they learned that most infected people are spreading the virus before they even have symptoms, the need for wearing it even if you felt fine was added.",,,,1637169663,{},hl0djxr,False,t3_qw0f3o,False,True,t1_hkzv3kh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qw0f3o/the_definition_of_fully_vaccinated_is_changing_to/hl0djxr/,1637492748.0,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We knew from the trials before any were rolled out that they immunity they offered wasn't full sterilising immunity. The word ""fully"" should have been avoided due to the risk of confusion as we've been seeing lately, it was foresight obvious not just hindsight obvious.

There's probably a good psychological/sociological explanation why so many things in this pandemic, all of which have been about playing the percentages, have ended up being presented as all-or-nothing things.

The major recurring theme with very outspoken conservatives is that they'll declare that since they are using facts to back up their feelings, anybody who disagrees with them must not be using facts at all.

There's the myocarditis risk which is pretty small, and possibly mitigated by something as simple as aspirating the needle on injecting.

It could be that in the next six months protection against severe disease or death is still high and we will not need more boosters. Or it could be that Covid will evolve to be. Ore dangerous and to evade vaccine induced immunity and we will need variant-specific boosters. 

The point is that all we know is what we have data for. We don‚Äôt know what will happen in the future. Right now, cases are high heading into winter, which is not great. The fear is that cases will skyrocket, and so the prudent thing to do is to get boosters, which should significantly improve our protection against infection and also increase our protection against severe disease and death.",,,,1637185525,{},hl1hhaa,False,t3_qw0f3o,False,True,t1_hl1gc89,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qw0f3o/the_definition_of_fully_vaccinated_is_changing_to/hl1hhaa/,1637515151.0,-1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you have a strong reaction to the delta variant then you're absolutely correct.

You will provide a strong antibody response to a variant that doesn't have a vaccine yet.

However, we see a non-linear response in antibody creation during mild covid cases and a number of interesting papers have been published here.  

You can just google to find them. 

Basically, if you have a mild case of covid, you're going to have a mild antibody response. We're still not sure why this is happening and I'm fascinated by this subject as it's proven to be the main reason that covid was such a problem.

The strongest antibody response (but a bit dangerous) would be to get vaccinated for covid, then get a strong delta response.

The incident speaks to the kinds of complications that could arise at next year‚Äôs Winter Games, which are scheduled to begin on Feb. 4 in accordance with strict health protocols. For training and other events in the prelude to the Games, athletes and team officials are not allowed to move about freely until they have spent 21 days inside a bubblelike training and competition zone.

The luger, Mateusz Sochowicz, 25, hit a barrier and fractured his leg on Nov. 8 while training on the track that will be used during the Winter Games. He was hospitalized near Beijing, and the International Luge Federation said that it and the local track operator were introducing additional safety measures for the Games after the accident.

But when organizers tried to arrange for Mr. Sochowicz to travel back to Poland on a commercial flight, they were told that Covid regulations prevented him from doing so for another two weeks, according to Janusz Tatera, the head of Poland‚Äôs luge federation.

Instead, Mr. Sochowicz traveled on an Air China cargo plane from Beijing to Milan on Monday, before taking another flight to Warsaw, Mr. Tatera said in a telephone interview.

The cargo plane‚Äôs interior was just like that of a passenger jet, Mr. Tatera said, adding that Mr. Sochowicz had described his journey from Beijing as ‚Äúvery comfortable.‚Äù

Mr. Sochowicz remains optimistic, Mr. Tatera said, that he will compete in Beijing 2022 after recovering from the injury.

The measures, which the country‚Äôs leader, Micheal Martin, announced on Tuesday night, also include a request that people work from home when possible and a requirement that they show a vaccine pass before entering theaters.

‚ÄúThe surge that we are now experiencing is a dramatic reminder of what this virus can do and the threat that it continues to represent,‚Äù Mr. Martin said. ‚ÄúWe need to act now to deal with this surge.‚Äù

In the last week, Ireland has experienced its second highest rate of hospital admissions in a2021, Mr. Martin said, a situation that is putting hospitals nationwide under significant pressure.

But even as the measures were announced, Mr. Martin acknowledged that ‚Äúcontinued progress in the journey to normal conditions is not inevitable.‚Äù

He said that he could not rule out further measures to curb the spread of the virus, but that the country‚Äôs successful vaccination program meant that a large-scale lockdown could be avoided at least for now.

Stephen Donnelly, the health minister, said that ‚Äústark new modeling‚Äù on the number of predicted cases was behind the rationale for the new measures.

Speaking to RTE Radio, the public broadcaster, he said on Tuesday that the models showed that without mitigation measures, Ireland‚Äôs intensive care units would see an influx of 200 to 450 patients by Christmas. The country has just over 300 permanent intensive-care beds.

In terms of performance nothing beats PCR tests. The antigen quick tests are for a shorter time and generally less reliable. Usually they perform well only for sick people at their height of virus load. Then it depends how well you test yourself, professional testing sites may filter out more positive people. There was a review where they tested many antigen tests and sorted them by how good they work:

I'm sorry to hear this brings you such anxiety.  I can't say I understand so well as I have a differing outlook. 
 
I have also had a ""breakthrough infection"".  I just call it an infection.  Happened about 5 months into my 2nd Pfizer dose.  Funnily I only thought to get tested because I had a close contact, but it turned out that contact's test was negative.  I just coincidentally got infected somewhere else around the same time.
If I was a betting man my bets would be on the gym.  
I knew the gym was a high risk location pre-vaccine so I'd stayed out then.  After I got vaccinated I decided to return because IMO the benefit outweighed the risk.  Covid being permanent now I viewed my infection as inevitable.  
My policy is ""exercise is the best medicine"".  Generally supported by physicians too.
I of course still exercised at home pre-vaccine but just couldn't get the same level of intensity I wanted.  

Risk evaluation is something everyone does differently.  Just as you may view my risk evaluation as crazy, I did view those still going to the gym and other dense public places pre-vaccine as crazy.

Excruciating, whole body, to the point I couldn't sleep; all I could do was lay there as everything hurt. My only relief was a hot shower and the pain immediately started up again as soon as I left the water, except worse because I was then cold.
To give some context (I'm not exaggerating)- my pain threshold is high enough that I was walking on- and even dancing with- a torn tendon for two months and using a broken wrist (for writing, school, etc) for three weeks; and would have kept doing, except I asked my mom to help me brush my hair and she thought that was weird (so sent me to Dr for x-rays).

It will look more like Wu1 than Delta.

It may achieve partial immune escape and so cause more infections than the currently circulating human variants/strains, but it is very unlikely to be more virulent or to escape T-cell memory.

There's precedent for this with influenza and the 2009 pandemic where the human circulating H1N1 seasonal influenza from 1918-1957 was displaced and disappeared in humans.  It then mutated in pigs for 50 years and the human-derived H1 gene recombined with a bird-derived N1 gene to produce the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.  That pandemic fizzled because people born before 1957 had cross reactive T-cells to the H1 protein, even after all that mutation and recombination.

Spillback from deer doing some kind of rewinding of the clock to 2019 (or worse) is very, very unlikely and is something more like sci-fi.  It is, however, how the virus certainly becomes endemic and we'll never get rid of it, and eradication is completely off of the table.

While googling around for some information, I found [this crappy article](https://www.riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/modern-day-censorship/most-covid-deaths-in-sweden-and-uk-in-september-involved-fully-vaccinated-individuals/) about breakthrough infections. 

In it, the author says:

&gt;	Between Sept. 6 and Oct. 3, 70 percent of Covid-positive deaths occurred among fully vaccinated persons, according to UKHSA data, with 2,281 deaths among the ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù and only 611 among the unvaccinated within 28 days of a positive test. Partially vaccinated individuals accounted for 98 deaths.
&gt;	Covid deaths among ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù Britons have increased dramatically since August, The Expose noted. Last month, Public Health England reported 600 coronavirus deaths in the unvaccinated population between Aug. 9 and Sept. 5 and 1,659 in the dually vaccinated population.

Seems scary, right? And they even [link to the study](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1023849/Vaccine_surveillance_report_-_week_40.pdf) so it must be true. Right? Right?!

Wrong. 

They are correct about raw hospitalization and death numbers‚Äîbut only because such a large portion of the population is vaccinated. When you look at hospitalization and death as a function of 100k of the vaccinated or unvaccinated population, vaccines prove to be highly effective. All you have to do is look at the per 100k numbers on pages 14-16, or the graphs on pages 17 &amp; 18 to prove that.

It is so depressing that people are actively attempting to mislead the public. This article I found clearly attempts to scare people away from the vaccine and make them think it isn‚Äôt effective when the raw data shows it is.

Moderna booster gives higher antibody titers compared to the previous 2nd dose. 

https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/moderna-covid-19-booster-may-protect-against-variants

&gt;A team led by Drs. Barney Graham and Robert Seder of NIH‚Äôs National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) studied booster vaccines in rhesus macaques. Macaques are a good model of how vaccines perform in people. The animals were given either a booster of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine or a slightly modified version tailored to the beta variant, which partly evades the immune response induced by the vaccine. Results appeared in Science on October 21, 2021.

&gt;The macaques were immunized with the two-dose Moderna vaccine series. About six months later, they received a booster dose. Some received a booster that had been altered to match changes to the virus‚Äô spike protein in the beta variant.

&gt;The researchers analyzed antibody responses at points before and after the boosters. They also measured T and B cells‚Äîimmune cells vital to protecting against the virus and forming an immune memory in case the virus is encountered again.

&gt;Both boosters increased levels of neutralizing antibodies against all known SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. The increases lasted for at least eight weeks after the boosters. Antibody levels were significantly higher post-boost than after the first two doses. While it‚Äôs unknown what antibody levels are needed for immunity, higher levels indicate greater protection.

&gt;The researchers also saw evidence that the boosters improved immune memory. Boosters rapidly restored memory B cells and T cells important for long-term protection against COVID-19. 

&gt;Nine weeks following the boosters, macaques were exposed to the beta COVID-19 variant. The boosters protected the animals, limiting the virus‚Äô ability to replicate in the lungs and nose. Viral levels were low or undetectable in the lungs and significantly reduced in the nose. This suggests that boosters may help limit the spread of infection in addition to protecting against disease.

&gt;Lastly, a measure of how the immune system adapts over time and increases the quality of the antibodies it produces continued to rise during the months after initial vaccination. Boosters caused a further improvement in this measure. Taken together, the results suggest that boosters can help to ensure strong and lasting immune protection against SARS-CoV-2. Both forms of the booster performed equally well at inducing neutralizing antibodies and preventing infection.

&gt;‚ÄúOur results suggest that COVID-19 booster vaccines may significantly increase immunity against the virus,‚Äù Seder says. ‚ÄúBoosters may prevent severe illness or death, particularly among older adults and those with pre-existing health conditions. They could also potentially limit mild infection and transmission.‚Äù

An antibody titer is a type of blood test that determines the presence and level (titer) of antibodies in the blood. This test is carried out to investigate if there is an immune reaction triggered by foreign invaders (antigens) in the body.

Serological responses were observed in over 93% and almost 99% of those who received a booster dose and after the two-dose primary vaccine regimen. When the Delta variant is considered, the neutralizing antibody titer before the booster was 42 and 800 before and 28 days after the booster, respectively, which is a 19-fold rise.

In the booster group, a four-fold rise from the baseline anti-Delta antibody titers was observed before the booster dose. However, titers against the D614G strain were 2.4-fold higher compared to the Delta variant, which reflects the trend seen after primary immunization as well.

At six months after full vaccination, the neutralizing antibody titers against the Delta variant were lower than at 28 days. In half the cases, neutralizing antibodies were undetectable. However, at two weeks from the booster dose of 50 Œºg, the anti-Delta antibody levels rose to the same level as anti-D614G antibodies had risen at 28 days from the second dose.

The authors of the current study suggest that this route could result in long-term vaccine efficacy and a return to neutralizing capacity against multiple circulating and newly emerging variants. A third dose of the booster could enhance protection against the Delta variant, in particular, which is causing havoc across much of the world",,,,1637184590,{},hl1f75h,False,t3_qvoo80,False,True,t1_hky5q74,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qvoo80/dr_fauci_says_us_covid_cases_need_to_fall_below/hl1f75h/,1637513811.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,
