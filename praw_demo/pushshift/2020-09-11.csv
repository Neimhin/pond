This is not a bargain between humans and virus. Virus doesn't negotiate and rewards your nice social distancing. 

I honestly believe that it is against our nature to stop the spread. If it was made in the lab, it was brilliantly thought through. 

You have a virus which spreads asymptomatically, a lot of mild cases so it can move in stealth mode. If 8/10 is like that, you can social distance for a week, have no symptoms, meet one person, and 5 weeks of that, you end up with 1 case keeping virus alive without detection for a period long enough that no one believes it is there still. Other viruses can hide in animals, this one hides in people, way easier since you relly on social distancing for very social creatures.

If you wear mask all the time, you still need others to wear it, so it rellies on human cohesion, which historically speaking, happened never before.

It spears kids, but they are super spreaders technically, with much higher viral load. 

It spears animals.

It kills more old and sick, but also fat. I don't remember I ever read about the virus which kills fat people more. There is obesity pandemic, driven by many factors, but somehow it sounds sinister to me.

Higher CFR in peple who are not white. I also never heard of D vitamin influence to how a virus will affect you. 

Higher CFR in poor due to jobs they have to do to survive, lack of proper life basically (poor diet, obesity, underlying conditions, lack of medical care).

I don't see polititians being to scared for themselves. I see Trump with 2 different delegations, all without the mask. 

We all live on credit and shit, but rich don't. We are told that ""economy would collapse"", but the truth is that they have so much money and we are so much in dept that yes, we can't stop working because they will take our food and home. Inequality is not about ""they have more"". They have everything and there is no added value that we can all sit at home for a fckn month, because those dragons sit on our billions.

The chain of infection was extremely difficult to trace because the woman was at several locations in the town. In her accommodation alone, which belongs to the American armed forces, 33 other people tested positive for corona. In addition, she and other infected persons had been in contact with numerous other people several times - around the last weekend and last Tuesday, presumably in a cocktail bar on Marienplatz and in an Irish pub on Rathausplatz.

District Office: contact tracing difficult

The employees of the Health Department are working flat out to clear up the chains of infection - but according to Stephan Scharf, spokesman for the District Administrator's Office, it is extremely difficult to determine with whom the infected American woman had contact.

It cannot be ruled out that other people have become infected. Persons who were on the road in Garmisch-Partenkirchen on Tuesday evening are urgently requested to go to the Garmisch-Partenkirchen Health Office to be tested voluntarily for Covid 19. Free coronate tests are possible, after prior registration, throughout the weekend in the test center at the Alpspitz wave pool.

Restaurants in Garmisch have to close at 10 pm

Since the critical threshold of the market community was exceeded with 54 infected persons, consequences are now being drawn: With immediate effect, the District Office has issued a partial restriction for the Garmisch-Partenkirchen market: all restaurants and bars must close at 10 pm for the next six days.

Contact in public spaces will be limited to a maximum of five people and the number of participants in private parties has been set at a maximum of 100 people outdoors and a maximum of 50 people in closed rooms.

On the part of the district administration office, the demonstration should have taken place. According to Stefan Scharf, spokesman for the district administration of Garmisch-Partenkirchen, the right of assembly would have continued to apply despite the increased Corona Falls in the market.

It was not known at first whether the increase in new infections would also have an impact on schools and daycare centers.

&gt;*The survey has been ongoing for the past two weeks. Students and employees at Ume√• University and SLU in Ume√• have participated by submitting self-tests.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*So far, the results are from the samples that have been submitted until Wednesday this week.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*- We see no increase compared to the first week. We still maintain a low spread of infection, says Anders Johansson, project manager and chief physician in the V√§sterbotten Region.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*He emphasizes that a large proportion of those tested were born in 1990 or later, ie an age group that in other countries has been designated as a group with a high spread of infection recently.*

Article is in Swedish, could't get it to load in google translate, so I translated the first part. They results won't come back until next week as the study ends on Sunday and there will take a few days to get all the results back.

In the multiplicity of Ume√• 1 per 100.000 is being tested positive, so there is not really any community spread. But this could mean that if your city/region does not have a community spread opening universities or schools might not have a significant impact on the spread. These are just my own comments and are not backed by the article.

""Covid-19: we no longer want to be governed by fear"": the forum of researchers and doctors  


In a forum for Le Parisien, 35 researchers, academics and doctors, including Jean-Fran√ßois Toussaint and Laurent Mucchielli, criticize the government's communication on the Covid crisis, which they consider too anxiety-provoking.  


In this collective forum, 35 scientists, academics and health professionals criticize government policy and communication. According to them, they are more a display of a ""protective posture"" than a specific health strategy.  


‚ÄúWe, scientists and academics from all disciplines, and health professionals, exercising our free will and our freedom of expression, say that we no longer want to be governed by and in fear. French society is currently in tension, many citizens are panicking or, on the contrary, laughing at the instructions, and many decision-makers are panicking. It is urgent to change course.  


We are not at war but facing an epidemic that caused 30 deaths on September 9, compared to 1,438 on April 14. The situation is therefore not at all the same as 5 months ago. Moreover, if war can sometimes justify a state of emergency and exceptional restrictions on the rule of law and public freedoms which are the basis of democracy and the Republic, this is not the case for an epidemic. Today as yesterday, this crisis must unite us and empower us, not divide us or submit.  


This is why we call on the French political and health authorities to stop instilling fear through anxiety-provoking communication that systematically exaggerates the dangers without explaining the causes and mechanisms. We must not confuse enlightened accountability with moralizing guilt, nor civic education with infantilization. We also call on all journalists to no longer relay without distance a communication that has become counterproductive: the majority of our fellow citizens no longer trust official speeches, conspiracies of all kinds abound on social networks and extremisms in profit.  


General confinement, an unprecedented measure in our history, had sometimes terrible individual, economic and social consequences which are far from having all been manifested yet and having all been evaluated. Leaving the threat of its renewal is not responsible.  


We must obviously protect the weakest. But just like the imposition of the wearing of masks in the street, including in regions where the virus does not circulate, the effectiveness of containment has not been scientifically demonstrated. These general and uniform measures, imposed under police surveillance, stem more from a desire to display a protective posture than from a precise health strategy. Hence their great volatility for six months. Many other countries are acting with more consistency. European coordination would be necessary.  


We also call on the government not to exploit science. The sine qua non of science is transparency, pluralism, adversarial debate, precise knowledge of data and the absence of conflicts of interest. As the Covid-19 Scientific Council does not meet all of these criteria, it should be overhauled or deleted.  


We would also like to point out that the first to treat the sick are general practitioners. Removing them from the fight against Covid, by not providing them with tests or masks and by suspending their freedom to prescribe the authorized drugs of their choice was an error that must not be repeated. On the contrary, all caregivers must be mobilized, equipped and united in order to improve our reaction capacities and not restrict them.  


Finally, the imperatives of protection against contagion must not lead to betraying medical ethics and fundamental humanist principles. Isolating the sick and protecting those at risk does not mean depriving them of all rights and all social life. Too many elderly people have died and are still deteriorating in abandonment motivated by unjustified health reasons. Too many families suffer from not being able to provide them with the affection essential to their happiness and their health.  


We urgently need to get back to thinking together to democratically define our health strategies, restore the confidence of our fellow citizens and of the future to our youth.

Why is this?

I think, because of winter weather vs. summer weather.

There are A LOT of theories about why the flu is worse in the winter, and I've personally learned that actually a lot of scientists aren't quite sure. That said, COVID is crystal clear in my mind.

Animal studies have shown that cold weather affects cellular (T-cell) immunity. This is because T-cells are resource intensive, and so is keeping your body warm. Neutralizing antibodies are small molecules that pack a huge punch, if effective. So it's cellular immunity (as opposed to antibody/humoral immunity) that takes a big hit due to cold weather. Cold weather also weakens - physically - the membranes of the respiratory system. Physically, these membranes are a weak link, the boundary between the body's protected insides and the shield-outsides. The immunity that occurs in the respiratory system affects a lot of infections and that's why there's so many respiratory diseases. So there's that.

However, recent studies have shown that COVID actually inhibits antibody immunity. There's a few reasons. First, the spike protein has an open and closed position. While closed, the protein can hide from antibodies. It may also be true that the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 actually turns off some antibody functions. We're not sure yet.

So, you hear all about ""T-cell"" immunity. It's true. We're learning from THIS particular virus how important T-cell immunity and memory is. But, it's not unique for this virus. All pathogens deal with T-cell immunity. T-cell immunity is like the slightly less effective cousin to antibody immunity.

Antibody immunity causes fever and symptoms. These are signs of your body fighting off an illness.

So, SARS-2 turns this off to a degree, so you only have mild symptoms while the virus spreads all over from your lungs to heart and kidneys and nervous system. It's bad. Eventually, most healthy people see their T-cells kick in and fight it off. In the meantime, their cells get a widespread infection MUCH WORSE than normal common colds and flus. Thus, there's an immune overreaction which manifests either as Long Covid or severe symptoms which can lead to death. Most critical COVID cases start mild for 10 days then SUDDENLY get very bad. Most non-critical cases are so mild, some people don't even have symptoms. That's because antibody immunity is downregulated.

WELL.

In the winter when the body is prioritizing staying warm over producing T-cells? Yeah, COVID in particular is bound to be worse. Worse than the flu is during cold weather, because COVID leans super heavily on T-cells and cold weather affects those in particular.

So, do you get the idea?

 The solution isn't unsafe school openings.  It's supporting the working class and closing unnecessary operations.  Does anyone need to go to a bar, sit down restaurant, theme park, movie theater, etc? The argument is ""the economy"" but the economy is a made up construction that the government and society can absolutely control. The extra $600 per week unemployment did more for the economy than movie theaters opening does frankly.  I'm even against grocery stores being fully open. Emergency funds could be given to expand delivery and pickup services, minimizing exposure. Surface transmission isn't nearly as big a concern, sharing air / being in the same interior space is the risk. 

Then you open learning labs / childcare minimally and safely  with additional staff (can be teachers who volunteer, young people who take these jobs) that you pay, protect, and benefit appropriately for this service.  These are only for extreme needs. To support the very few ESE kids who can't work online (not all ESE) and young children of truly essential workers who facilitate supply chains for food etc or give necessary medical care.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if I'm positive and I'm trying to avoid the anxiety from dictating things, but I have had zero typical symptoms but have been dealing on and off with fairly bad headaches (behind the eyes, but also sort of dully radiating around the head) for about eight days. 

It's been usually once or twice a day that the headache will come and then go but they last for at least an hour or two and then slowly dissipate around my head and towards my cheekbones and down my face. I take one dose of panadol (paracetamol) which doesn't do much to stop it, but maybe helps a bit.

Today I felt a somewhat out of it mentally after a headache had gone away. I was still able to have a conversation for several hours but some of the words were a bit hard to find and i just felt sluggish. Granted, I had done about a three hour hike (and had two small beers at lunch), so maybe that was connected to being a bit out of it plus some anxiety, but I didn't feel totally like myself. 

My other symptoms have been a fairly regular, but not super intense pain in the bottom of my feet and in my hands. And even right now as I lay in bed, a bit in my hips. 

I have dealt with some venous insufficiency problems in the past which led to some neuropathy, so hopefully its just this as the season changes a bit, but the headache and pain scares me a bit, as I've been told it may be symptoms without the need for respiratory symptoms to appear.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone here have some stories or personal experience about only headache/some random body pains being part of Covid? If so, any elaboration on how long for it to go away and also how it was treated?

The real fix is a combination of a highly effective vaccine which will take several years of trial and error, and effective therapeutics. In combination. We have neither so far. We only have the hope of a moderately effective early vaccine to lower the infection rates at this point.

Case numbers are increasing now due to there being a greater focus on testing, yet deaths from the virus have remained at a steady level. 

The economic fallout and overall negative toll on mental health that these lockdowns are causing is doing far more damage than this virus ever could.

 Schools have so severely mismanaged their endowments and tuition dollars that they absolutely need to hold in-person classes so that they can collect more money. They're endangering the students so much more severely by bringing them together than the actual students who are doing the gathering. It's not like nobody expected college students to do dumb things like throwing parties right now, and acting surprised that they did and punishing students for their indiscretions is an intentional move to defer blame from the administrations that chose to assemble them in the first place. 

&amp;#x200B;

Similarly, the US government won't roll out any further unemployment, UBI, or small business support to incentivize people to stay home and incentivize businesses to stay closed. Instead, businesses reopen to stay financially solvent and their employees go back to work thereby providing spaces for those dreaded *young people* to congregate. Blaming young people is again a tactic to shift blame away from the people in power meant to keep us safe. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, blaming young people is a way to assign the blame for these activities to one specific group. Sure young people might be partying, but people in their 40's and 50's are having dinner parties or sitting on coffee shop patios all day long. Young people are just a convenient, seemingly homogeneous, and much maligned group to place blame on when there are people with more power and more responsibility to blame. Those same groups are *intentionally* constructing the ""kids are to blame"" narrative to prevent you from blaming them instead.",,1599951344,{},g4zugz6,False,t3_ira840,False,False,t1_g4x9hwa,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ira840/us_tourist_becomes_superspreader_in_germany_54/g4zugz6/,1600017339,15,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

**Corona in Garmisch-Partenkirchen: A superspreader goes partying despite symptoms**

An infected vacationer has caused the Corona Falls in Garmisch-Partenkirchen to rise sharply. According to BR information, the 26-year-old was celebrating despite symptoms and, as a ""superspreader"", probably infected many more people.

A vacationer was probably a so-called ""superspreader"" in the nightlife of Garmisch-Partenkirchen and infected many more people with Covid-19. According to BR information, the woman from America had celebrated the night despite corona symptoms. In the district of Garmisch-Partenkirchen, the number of new infections has risen to 54, exceeding the critical number of 50. Restrictions have been imposed and health department employees are trying to track down more infected and sick people. Presumably, more people are still infected - especially partygoers between 18 and 35 years of age could be affected.

**Infected people celebrated in several restaurants**

The corona detection team is working flat out to trace infection chains. However, as District Administrator Anton Speer told the Bavarian Broadcasting Corporation, this is proving extremely difficult. The highly infectious 26-year-old American woman was on the road in several locations in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. She and other infected persons had been in contact with numerous other people several times during the past weekend and last Tuesday, presumably in a cocktail bar on Marienplatz and in an Irish pub on Rathausplatz.

**According to the District Office, the woman entered Germany ""at the beginning of September or the end of August"". Whether she brought the virus with her from the USA and possibly disregarded quarantine rules is still unclear. According to the report, 23 people have tested positive so far in an accommodation on the premises of US forces alone, where she had stayed overnight.**

**Partygoers should get tested**

District Administrator Speer appeals to all citizens who have been out and about in the nightlife of the market town in the last few days to report to the health department in Garmisch-Partenkirchen and to have themselves tested voluntarily. ""Free coronate tests are possible after previous registration, the whole weekend over in the test center at the Alpspitz wave pool. From a medical point of view, a further significant increase in the number of infections in the district is to be expected, the District Office announced.

**New restrictions in force**

To prevent further infection, further restrictions were imposed yesterday with immediate effect. For the next six days, for example, all venues in the market town will close at 10 p.m., contact in public places will be limited to a maximum of five people, and the number of participants in private parties has been set at a maximum of 100 outdoors and 50 indoors.",,1599906494,{},g4x22wq,True,t3_ira840,False,True,t3_ira840,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ira840/us_tourist_becomes_superspreader_in_germany_54/g4x22wq/,1599906505,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

If you want a snapshot of what France will look like in 2-3 weeks, watch Spain. 

Another factor is that the death rate is not 10% like France‚Äôs stats show, it‚Äôs probably closer to 1%.

**No credible evidence supporting claims of the laboratory engineering of SARS-CoV-2**

[**https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7054935/**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7054935/)

[http://virological.org/t/tackling-rumors-of-a-suspicious-origin-of-ncov2019/384/4](http://virological.org/t/tackling-rumors-of-a-suspicious-origin-of-ncov2019/384/4)

SOURCE OF FURIN SITE IN SARS-CoV-2 IS COPY CHOICE ERROR FROM MIXED INFECTION OF BATS

I have found a probable source of the putative insert that adds the RRAR furin site to SARS-CoV-2.

Ten  of the 12 nucleotides in the RRAR insert are identical to a sequence in  the spike protein gene of Bat Coronavirus HKU9 isolated from a  Rousettus fruit bat in Guangdong province in 2011.

In  HKU9 they code for TSAG in the loop region known in the Gao terminology  as SD3. The first CT of the putative insert is still orphan, but there  is a relevant possible source for the rest, albeit out of frame.

The ‚ÄúInsert‚Äù is CT CCTCGGCGGG, the last ten identical to the sequence in HKU9.

The sequence context has other similarities, i.e the ‚Äúcagac‚Äù upstream and a ‚Äúc‚Äù downstream of the ‚Äúinsert‚Äù as aligned here:

HKU9 gcatttgta **caga------cctcggcgggc** ctctgt

CoV-2 tatcagact **cagac** ttgct **cctcggcgggc** acgtagt

Total of 14 of 19 identical nucleotides in two runs with one gap. That‚Äôs a lock.

Copy  choice errors in mixed infections do not have to be in an exact  context, since it is not a recombination, but RNA polymerase hopping  from one template strand to another. In this case the two templates code  for the same gene, between regions about a thousand nucleotides from  one another, out of a genome of 30,000 nucleotides. There could easily  have been evolution of the site since the mixed infection, over a period  of years.

This cannot be a coincidence.

The  natural range of the host for Bat RaTG13, closely related to  SARS-CoV-2, the microbat Rhinolopus affinis, overlaps that of the  Rousettus fruit Macrobat in Yunnan province. The latter is used for bush  meat. Also, Microbats and Macrobats are known to co-habit the same  caves. An alternate source of virus for a human infection could be mixed  bat guano from such a cave with a mixed population.

So  the definitive source of the pandemic is a mixed infection of viruses  similar to SARS-CoV-2 and Bat HKU9 ‚Äì copy choice error resulting in an  insert in SARS-CoV-2. Could occur in bats, intermediate animal or human.

Human  in incubation with SARS-CoV-2 could hop a max speed train, direct line  from Kunming in Yunnan Province and disembark in Wuhan train station  6.5-8 hours later, sometime last fall. The line began service in 2017.

Infected  in Yunnan, does not spread it there, but goes to Wuhan, where he/she  either falls ill or spreads it asymptomatically to another person,  initiating the pandemic there. The initial outbreak occurs a short  distance from the Wuhan train station for good reason ‚Äì that is where it  arrived.

This accidental mixed  infection in the wild, and infection of a human by some form of bush  meat or bat guano, who carries it by high speed train to Wuhan ‚Äì this is  the most likely series of events leading to the pandemic.

The only laboratory required is the natural laboratory of the bat cave with multiple species of bats and bat coronaviruses.

Found it.

If this works like the flu (and based on all the droplet stuff, I don't see why it wouldn't) it may be easier to have super spreader events as humidity drops.

In *PLoS Biology* on February 23, 2010, the researchers reported that there were often significant drops in absolute humidity in the weeks prior to a flu outbreak. ""This dry period is not a requirement for triggering an influenza outbreak, but it was present in 55-60% of the outbreaks we analyzed, so it appears to increase the likelihood of an outbreak,"" Shaman says. ""The virus response is almost immediate; transmission and survival rates increase and about 10 days later, the observed influenza mortality rates follow.""

A 2-dose vaccination regimen of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates was administered in 20 rhesus macaques (divided into four groups equally).

One group was administered with placebo, while three groups were immunized with 3 different vaccine candidates at 0 and 14 days. All the macaques were exposed to viral challenge 14 days after the 2nd dose.

The results showed protective efficacy, increasing SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies, reducing replication of the virus in the nasal cavity, throat, and lung tissues of monkey.

No evidence of pneumonia was observed by histopathological examination in vaccinated groups, unlike the placebo group

Adverse events were not seen in animals immunized with a two-dose vaccination regimen.

and you can see that they have had excess deaths for 5 of the last 6 weeks with the only one not being excess is the last one.

&gt;If you're interested, you should play around on that CDC page.

dude, I am not new to the cdc website nor the excess deaths page, but thanks.

I understand that Nebraska has geographic advantages and thus most of the shutdown in the nation happened before there was much spread in Nebraska.

I understand that Nebraska is at ""only"" 224 deaths per million and that it is relatively less effected by covid19.

I also know that 5 of the last six weeks do show excess deaths, so in spite of a lockdown that has been going on for months to varying degrees around the nation and in spite of the Nebraska being in the middle of nowhere, it looks like you are getting those deaths now, so it isn't a great time to open up.

Nothing you say will change that objective reality.

https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/states/nebraska/nebraska.htm

Here is another cdc page.

There were 393 combined Flu/Pneumonia deaths in 2017 and 342 in 2016 and 397 in 2015 and 350 in 2014.

per worldometers Nebraska has 434 deaths from covid.  so if they have counted every single covid death, there have been more already than the entire year for flu.  If no one with it currently dies and no new infections occur, covid has already killed 20 percent more people than flu and pneumonia does.  I

and that's with the lockdown such as it was and the social distancing.

so I don't know exactly what you are looking at when you vaguely refer to excess deaths, because you don't quote numbers or make specific verifiable claims.

Pretty tough to compare a pandemic 100 years ago to now. A lot has changed. The point is 300k deaths this early into a pandemic is a large death toll.

When the H1N1 seasonal flu was displaced by H2N2 in 1957 under 100k Americans died. When it rearranged and made H2N3 in 1969 (worst flu year post Spanish Flu) 100k Americans died. 300-400k deaths from a new virus is a lot even for today's population. Don't kid yourself.

As for white supremacists, one would hope that the next President will crack down on white supremacists like how we went after Al Qaeda, i.e. extraordinary rendition, black sites, Guantanamo Bay.

Anyways, they put the worst case scenario out there because that's how decisions are made, you don't or at least should not assume anything will be moderate or less than. 

Yes there will be starvation, but that has less to do with lockdowns and more to do with behavioral changes from the pandemic. Most of the lockdowns were over quite a while ago, but joblessness is on the rise and businesses are still closing.  The financial hardships caused by the pandemic were unavoidable, they didn't just happen because we locked down a couple months. In fact the nations that have weathered the financial storm the best have had aggressive containment strategies. We've seen it hurts a national economy a lot more to be undergoing continuous, uncontrolled surges than it was by aggressive containment early followed by proverbial whack a mole with the virus.

People try to put all the hardships on the lockdowns to fit a narrative, but it doesn't fit really. The experts made it clear early on: take the hit now, or take it later and for an extended period. 

Now why can't we just protect the high risk people? Well that doesn't work in today's society. Everyone is too interconnected, we can't just lock the elderly away, and even if we could, who is to take care of them then? How do they take care of themselves if shut out? If the virus is spreading through the population it will work its way to the at risk groups, we have seen it play out already. Not to mention over 1/3 of America fits into the high risk group due to obesity and diabetes being so prevalent. It would be impossible to lock away 1/3+ of the country while the rest of us go on until its over. And once released the virus would begin to spread through their immuneless population.

People will die of COVID, yes. But no one is really dying of ""lockdowns"". Again, that is made up nonsense to fit a narrative. Some governments were able to lockdown meanwhile provide for their people, we weren't so lucky here in the US, but that is on our govt, not the idea of lockdowns. A lot of the worldwide starvation due to COVID is just because the state of the global economy now, and it was unavoidable. A pandemic of this nature will cause economic hardships whether you lockdown or not.

Lastly, we also don't know enough about the virus to let it infect everyone while they go about their business. We don't have long term data yet of course, but what we do have is very concerning. Multiple organs are taxed and damaged in many survivors. The reason people may tell you to ""google it"" is because its such old news and we're tired of digging up links for people who haven't been paying attention to the science behind the virus. We don't know how long term the damage will be in all cases, but some look dire. And some of the immediate stats like studies showing heart inflammation in 60% of survivors is very worrisome (that study did 1/3 hospitalized patients and 2/3 at home, so it may skew a bit high, but still, very concerning). Most of the early studies are showing some kind of noticeable organ damage in over half of patients 2-3 months later. Again, I realize not all of this is permanent, but those stats are more severe than a standard viral infection and should bring pause and caution. A population of people with increased rates of heart defects and decreased lung capacity would be more detrimental to the economy and society in general than any lockdown.

I do think the end of the world mantra on this sub can get old, and is definitely exaggerated. There is definitely some hope out there right now. This wasn't as bad as it could have been, and there are signs many areas may have seen the worst of it. But its an equally bad, if not worse take to just dismiss it as something we can just move on from before the virus is ready to ""move on"".",,1599882081,{},g4wbqiq,False,t3_ir1vd5,False,False,t1_g4w76ue,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ir1vd5/persistent_lung_damage_improves_gradually_after/g4wbqiq/,1599887688,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

We conclude that, from the available literature, the predictors of pulmonary fibrosis in COVID-19 infection are advanced age, illness severity, length of ICU stay and mechanical ventilation, smoking and chronic alcoholism. With no proven effective targeted therapy against pulmonary fibrosis, risk reduction measures should be directed at limiting the severity of the disease and protecting the lungs from other incidental injuries.

I think what they're saying is that Pulmonary Fibrosis CAN develop from Covid-19. My point was that lungs can heal themselves (former smokers) and other than morphing into Pulmonary Fibrosis or other fatal diseases e.g. lung cancer, it's too early to call it ""permanent"" damage.

From anecdotal experience, it has been frustrating to see how completely optional everyone has treated the guidelines this whole time. I consistently see like 1/3 of people not wearing masks everywhere I go or drive around. I'm sure that's better than in some other places, but with all the superspreader events we've seen it's pretty obvious that even a few bad actors can infect a lot of people.

I think criminal charges would be a reasonable punishment for endangering lives in clear-cut cases, but honestly it would go a long way to just start giving out a $200 ticket for anyone not wearing a mask.

If there's such a thing as ""herd immunity"" there would also be something along the lines of ""herd testing/isolation.""

I'm not saying anything to anyone unless this gets worse because I don't want to have to quarantine 2 weeks over a false alarm.""

I do appreciate you providing a source, wow, that site is dishonest as fuck.  or your use of it was.


It consistently takes out all nursing home deaths.  yes, if you don't count the people most likely to die, the IFR does look better.

but that doesn't mean the overall IFR is actually between .5 and .3.

To put this another way, the math that you agreed with used total dead and didn't exclude over half the dead who were in nursing homes.

If you want to do the math again and exclude half the deaths as your sources for IFR do, you have an IFR of .2 which is actually lower than even your ""optimistic"" sources.

Some foreigners entering Vietnam on commercial flights resumed this month will be required to undergo centralized quarantine from five to seven days.

Vietnam is expected to resume commercial flights from Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City to Guangzhou, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan from September 15, and Laos and Cambodia starting September 22.

Around 20,000 passengers are scheduled to arrive in the country each month, Government Office Chief Mai Tien Dung said at a meeting Friday.

Passengers would include Vietnamese citizens, foreigners carrying diplomatic and official passports, experts, managers, high-skilled workers, investors, and their family members. The flights are not opened to tourists yet.

Under the Transport Ministry's proposal, there would be two weekly round trips on the HCMC-Guangzhou route, two weekly services on the Hanoi-Tokyo and HCMC-Tokyo routes as well as four trips from Hanoi and HCMC to Seoul, and four weekly trips to Taipei.

Dung said passengers must furnish a certificate showing they tested negative for the novel coronavirus within five days before boarding the flight. Upon landing in Vietnam, they would have to undergo centralized quarantine from five to seven days and would be tested for Covid-19 twice using the real-time reverse transcription‚Äìpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

Those reporting negative results would remain at home or their place of work until they complete the 14-day quarantine period as per health ministry protocol under supervision of local authorities. Those showing signs of infection will have to continue the centralized quarantine.

Since the Covid-19 pandemic broke out in Vietnam last January, the country required those coming from abroad to be quarantined at centralized facilities for 14 days.


Foreign passengers, including Vietnamese returning from abroad would have to pay for all quarantine and testing expenses. Costs for PCR testing in Vietnam are proposed at VND 1.2 million ($52) per person.

During their stay, passengers will be required to install Bluezone, a Bluetooth-based app that helps determine if a person has come into close contact with a Covid-19 patient.

At the meeting, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said Vietnam had brought the second outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic under control since the country has experienced eight clean days without new domestic infections.

""It must be ensured that foreign arrivals cause no new outbreaks,"" Phuc stressed.

Vietnam suspended all international flights on March 25. Many foreigners who have been kept out of the country due to travel restrictions have pleaded with the government to reopen the borders and resume international flights so they could reunite with their families.

The country has recorded 1,059 Covid-19 cases, 128 of which remain active. So far, 35 people have succumbed to the pandemic, many of them elderly patients suffering underlying conditions like diabetes and/or kidney failure.",,1599949604,{},g4zoz3q,True,t3_irm5tf,False,True,t3_irm5tf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/irm5tf/vietnam_requires_sevenday_centralized_quarantine/g4zoz3q/,1600014709,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

‚ÄúTo test the variolation hypothesis, we will need more studies comparing the strength and durability of SARS-CoV-2‚Äìspecific T-cell immunity between people with asymptomatic infection and those with symptomatic infection, as well as a demonstration of the natural slowing of SARS-CoV-2 spread in areas with a high proportion of asymptomatic infections,‚Äù she told the Sunday Telegraph.

‚ÄúHowever, it is true that the proportion of asymptomatic infection being increased by masking might increase the proportion of the population who achieve at least short-term immunity to the virus while we await a vaccine.‚Äù

Dr Julian Tang, Honorary Associate Professor of Respiratory Sciences at the University of Leicester, has shared Dr Gandhi‚Äôs cautious optimism.

‚ÄúThis idea of 'variolation' - a term originally derived from the smallpox pre-vaccine era - is quite feasible and may add to the protective physical effects of universal masking - by low level stimulation of the wearer's immune system as it is exposed to low levels of airborne SARS-CoV-2, which can induce an immune response but without any overt infection and disease,‚Äù she said.

She added: ‚ÄúThis is after all the response to a typical vaccine - where the recipient's immune systems are stimulated, subclinically, to produce protective immune responses to combat the infection if exposed at a future date.

‚ÄúOf course, more formal studies are required to confirm this effect, and there are likely natural experiments ongoing around the world at the moment.‚Äù",,1599941544,{},g4yzois,False,t3_iri6a6,False,True,t3_iri6a6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iri6a6/face_masks_could_be_giving_people_covid19/g4yzois/,1600002117,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Like anything, testing reveals what's there, that's why with more testing, you can officially identify more cases. For statistic purposes, data gatherers aren't just going to take someone who thinks they have it as an official statistic. That would be really sloppy data gathering.

You are right, the majority of cases are very mild or asymptomatic. Probably 30% asymptomatic and another 40% are very mild, like not even like a weak cold. It's the remaining 30% that have a wide range of symptoms/severity. The 70% that are asymptomatic/mild might not realize they're sick and go about their business (thinking they just have allergies or something else) and interact with people--that's one way it spreads.

The NYT had an interactive map on excess deaths from summer recently.  It was significant in the US as a whole and many states. 

I'm not sure any CDC data will be 100% accurate anyway.  The CDC is muddling lots of data. Deaths are down from US peak possibly now, but cases, hospitalizations, and spread still pose concerns in many areas and excess deaths still pose concerns in areas. It's constantly changing hot spots, but the US doesn't have a solid Covid containment yet.  When a consensus of independent experts determines from all metrics that the health crisis has either ended globally or that the US is negligibly impacted by it and ready to strongly contain when outbreaks occur (think New Zealand), then that's meaningful. 

In my area, hospitalizations are not down to pre-pandemic levels though, and we're not publicized as a particular hot spot. Spread is still meaningful. 

Deaths lag and data lags further but the NYT had recently published data of excess deaths through August and it was still significant. I have heard of the haven't controversy of the CDC trying to muddle the death toll as they've tried to muddle who should get tested and school parameters. This pandemic isn't over.  I don't know if it'll end with a vaccine or some combination of things, but I think anyone creating recreational contacts during a pandemic is irresponsible unless their nation has a strong enough containment and response plan.

People like this don‚Äôt need any more education. They have enough. They just don‚Äôt care, and have already made the decision to disregard the health and well being of others.

""pleasure derived by someone from another person's misfortune.""

You know, I feel thst a little clarification is in order. 

I work at an Urgent Care that does COVID19 testing. We send out sympathy cards to the loved ones of the patients that we've sent to the hospital, who died. We get a report, and have to speak with the medical examiner about it. It's traumatizing when I pick up the phone, and I hear, ""This is Dr. Xyz, the medical examiner. Did you have a patient named ABC?"" This sort of thing is happening more and more often. You can't imagine the anger I feel when some poor, dear little old lady dies because little Johnny just *had* to see his grandma. And now she's dead. 

So each and every time I see someone exposing themselves and others around them to a deadly virus, I make it a point to tell them how to correct that blunder. 

If I were the person who took the picture of this grieving fiance of a fireman, I would have asked her to adjust her mask. And I certainly would not have published the above picture. 

I can't tell you about all the families that I have seen afflicted by this virus, because it'd take me 7 months of typing to tell you about all of them. (Not to mention HIPAA). But I can say that there have been way, way, way too many of them. And most of them could have avoided it.

It may not be the government's job to command, but it is the government's job to LEAD!  Unfortunately, instead of a real leader, we have a reality tv star that played a businessman...poorly.

&gt; I was conceding that he was correct and I was wrong...?

Well, you claimed you were incorrect about some ""semantics"", seemingly downplaying it as irrelevant and suggesting that it was not about a matter of fact. Besides, the false assertion in your earlier (and more prominent) comment is still there un-edited and un-corrected, continuing the spread of misinformation.

&gt;Please just one source. A single accusation. One thread of evidence. That is all I‚Äôm asking.

There was a video posted on reddit on Jul 27, which is where I had seen the data anomaly detailed. I woudl have already linked it in my prior comment, but the post was removed by mods (due to being ""political"" in violation of sub rules) and the YouTube video itself has since been set to private: https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/hz630h/astrophysicist_jeff_hester_speculates_hhs_is/fzhhkcg/?context=3

So I had to try to track down more info on it. I did now find a follow-up video by the same person, where he explains why he removed the other video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2O5ZG7g77s

He summarizes his motivation for the removal with 3 reasons:

 1] The anomaly was weaker, though still present, after he removed from the analysis two states (Texas and Florida) that did in fact have some new public health mandates implemented in the relevant timeframe that could rationally have contributed to a declined rate of new COVID cases that was seen, ...

 2] it was ""unclear to [him] whether there is a mechanism whereby the HHS system can influence total case counts"", and ...

3] ""The real reason, though..."" (he emphasizes) was that he ""didn't like the direction that a lot of the conversation was going"", because COVID-deniers/anti-maskers were latching onto his video and misusing it. (""Some interpreted my results as calling into question the importance of public health infrastructure or the efficacy of masks, social distancing, and non-pharmacological interventions."")

-----

That being said, the fact that this data issue/observation does not seem to have been raised by any other scientists or state-level authorities does give me hope that it has some benign/legit explanation. But really that is only because of my sheer hope and faith that people with better access than myself to the data sources (especially via channels separate from HHS's data collection, for comparison), would have already detected and raised alarm about such a grave data issue, if it were real and/or still uncorrected.",,1599888237,{},g4wkaj7,False,t3_iqq63e,False,True,t1_g4wenei,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iqq63e/fauci_depressed_us_cant_get_new_coronavirus_cases/g4wkaj7/,1599891798,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

&gt;**KEY BACKGROUND**  
&gt;  
&gt;With schools and daycare centers racing to reopen nationwide, some public health officials have warned that kids can become infected at school and bring the virus home with them. Research shows that children older than 9 are more likely to infect their parents than younger kids, but the CDC is now reporting that toddlers can spread the virus, too.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**CRUCIAL QUOTE**  
&gt;  
&gt;""COVID-19 is less severe in children than it is in adults ... but children can still play a role in transmission,"" the study's authors wrote.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Coronavirus spread through several Utah childcare centers earlier this year and eventually infected parents, the latest indicator that toddlers and infants can transmit the virus to adults, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found in a study released Friday.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**KEY FACTS**  
&gt;  
&gt;The CDC looked at three daycare centers and camps in the Salt Lake City area that saw small Covid-19 outbreaks between April and July.  
&gt;  
&gt;At least a dozen kids and 10 staff members contracted the virus across the three facilities, including toddlers and an eight-month-old infant, though none of the children showed severe symptoms.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, 12 family members of these children were infected with coronavirus, including one parent who needed to be hospitalized, the CDC found.  
&gt;  
&gt;Researchers said these outbreaks might have been halted if more kids had worn masks, or if children and staff had stayed home when their family members were sick.  
&gt;  
&gt;Another CDC study released last month offered evidence that public health officials can prevent Covid-19 from spreading in daycare centers as long as they remain vigilant about containing outbreaks.

# CDC Study Summary:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**What is already known about this topic?**  
&gt;  
&gt;Children aged ‚â•10 years have been shown to transmit SARS-CoV-2 in school settings.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**What is added by this report?**  
&gt;  
&gt;Twelve children acquired COVID-19 in child care facilities. Transmission was documented from these children to at least 12 (26%) of 46 nonfacility contacts (confirmed or probable cases). One parent was hospitalized. Transmission was observed from two of three children with confirmed, asymptomatic COVID-19.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**What are the implications for public health practice?**  
&gt;  
&gt;SARS-CoV-2 Infections among young children acquired in child care settings were transmitted to their household members. Testing of contacts of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in child care settings, including children who might not have symptoms, could improve control of transmission from child care attendees to family members.",,1599886838,{},g4wikj6,True,t3_ir5z1q,False,True,t3_ir5z1q,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ir5z1q/cdc_study_shows_young_kids_at_daycare_centers_can/g4wikj6/,1599890978,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Plus there‚Äôs an overarching federal law that protects healthcare information called HIPAA, and sharing health information without patient consent can result in incredibly massive fines. However, there‚Äôs a host of exceptions for law enforcement purposes when medical information is needed for law enforcement. However, what‚Äôs even a bigger barrier is that we don‚Äôt have a national health system, so there‚Äôs an ungodly mess of electronic health record systems used by thousands upon thousands of unaffiliated health providers from doctors, to labs, to hospitals, etc., and these combos of providers and their EHRs may or may not talk to each other directly or indirectly through health information exchanges. I work for a massive health care organization using one of the most connected and popular EHRs and even we can‚Äôt get a complete health record on a patient. So the odds that law enforcement can pull your health record from a common stop and ID search is extremely low.

The police can easily get your medical information without your consent under the various HIPAA exceptions, but this generally involves going to or calling all the places where the patient has been seen. For example the police might be just interested in a patient‚Äôs mental health condition and want the record, but  they would first have to figure out who the patient‚Äôs psychiatrist or psychologist is.

It sounds like this state has an enforceable law in place requiring people who test positive to quarantine, and has decided that COVID-19 test results need to be available to law enforcement for the sake of public health and quarantine enforcement. Notice the cop said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen this before. There‚Äôs an input on the compute that you tested positive.‚Äù Seeing medical info on an ID search sounded out of the norm for him.

In my state we have no state level mask law or quarantine law. The mask laws are again a mishmash of laws that may or may not be present at the county or city level. There is no state level quarantine law. I live in a county with a population in the millions, and our department of public health just says you should quarantine if positive. However it‚Äôs not mandatory or enforceable. Police in our area probably don‚Äôt have access to COVID results.

The Governor of Nebraska believes the curve was flattened enough to not overwhelm the hospitals, which was his primary goal.  The hospitals have a lot of capacity and available equipment and the state officials believe they can reopen without overwhelming their medical system. They might be right or they might be wrong.

 We've seen what the spread looks like with no mitigation. We can't afford to pay everyone to stay home until there's a widely distributed vaccine without major societal reform, which is extremely unlikely. And many people wouldn't want to anyway. Which is understandable. We're social animals, and if you're young and healthy, you might balk at being restricted for so long for basically the benefit of others. Yes, that's selfish, but it's the reality of the situation.

 Personally, I think the best way to proceed until we have a safe vaccine is to maintain enough measures that there's hospital capacity for all who need it, and maximize the ability of people to self isolate if they want to. So WFH allowed, online school allowed, strict measures in essential businesses like grocery stores or the post office.

[],,Jouhou,,,[],,,,text,t2_58z9t,False,False,[],"Every year there is ""flu"" not caused by influenza, known as influenza like illness (ILI). The viruses that cause these illnesses don't get as much attention because they aren't as likely to cause someone to be hospitalized (but they do hospitalize people and that's usually where the samples for this program come from). They are extremely capable of putting you on the severe end of ""mild"" illness, where ""mild"" illness simply means you don't require hospital care.

This surveillance data can pick up on unidentified novel pathogens when compared to US data on ""ILI"" provided with weekly CDC influenza data releases. ILI will usually correlate with spikes in influenza or viruses that cause illness that resembles influenza. SARS-CoV-2 causes an illness that is influenza like on the surface, and should cause a spike in ILI.

Many of us were watching for a spike in ""ILI"" that could not be explained by rises in Influenza or the other viruses being tracked. This occurred in the end of February to early March timeframe. This is why I'm fairly confident that if this virus was here before our first confirmed case, it was not seeing widespread transmission at that point in time.

https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm

Go here, scroll down to ILINet.

In the line on the chart for the the 2019/2020 season shown in red, it is very clear that ILI this past season was very unusual. There's 3 peaks, there's usually only 1. That's because outside of COVID-19 there were a couple of other unusual occurrences - the new variation of the influenza B/Victoria virus and an exceptionally severe RSV season. The first peak is explained by a combination of Influenza B and RSV. The second peak is explained by Influenza A H1N1 and Influenza B/Victoria. That third peak, that is SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19). It was explained by no other viral surveillance data.

This chart clearly delineates when this virus started spreading like wildfire in the US- Week 9. That means starting out about February 24, this is when it's possible and even likely that if someone had an influenza like illness it would be caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Not quite explaining it like you're 5, but I broke it down for you. Shortcut to understanding that is looking at that chart in the link I've provided.

She put at least 54 people at risk of dying or serious complications from COVID selfishly. She could end up being responsible for several deaths, dozens or hundreds if this cluster causes a massive spread of cases. This also hurts a region economically if places need to shutdown, all because of one asshole. You could be ending someone's career or destroying their business because of a selfish want to party.

This is just one case but when I see American tourists claiming they are going to Alaska to vacation in BC I get furious. Fuck these people are straight up evil, they need to be in prison... instead, we just give them a slap on the wrist like what they did isn't serious.

Is it that hard to wait another year or so for vaccines to hopefully be out and people vaccinated? Just pick up some home hobbies for a year, it's not that hard. Will these people feel remorse for all the death and damage they've caused? Probably not because these people are all about themselves with no regards for the others on this planet.

See, this is something that just kills me about German society.  I have lived here (in Germany) for almost 10 years and the thing that leaves me the most speechless (in good and sad ways- not a typo, I mean sad, not bad) is the fundamental trust that society and government have, that people will do the ""right thing"" pretty much just because it's the right thing.  Whether it's buying a ticket for the subway (there are no turnstiles, just occasional spot checks on transport to see if you have a valid ticket), or agreeing that after you've been busted by police for something that you'll cooperate with further action, or ""observing"" quarantine rules of one's own volition, etc...GAH!  It just kills me.  

It kills me because the current approach is so reasonable.  So non-cynical.  So beautiful.  And normally so effective!  to rely on the social contract among people to not be a complete ass.  It kills me because at some point people will see too many instances of those who don't do ""the right thing"" and lose that sense of trust in each other.  It kills me that cases like this will give other people the idea that the ""rules"" don't apply to them.  It kills me.

&gt; We were cheated. The lives of Mom and Dad were stolen by a virus that many joke about on a daily basis or just straight out believe it‚Äôs a hoax of some sort. Both of them took this pandemic seriously and still got sick, still died...

&gt; I told myself when I started this, I would not do so in anger, but for the love they inspired me to give.

&gt; So, let‚Äôs change course.

&gt; My parents weren‚Äôt just a blessing for me, my brother, my sister, our spouses, and our children. They were a blessing to every person that met them. My mom had the most beautiful soul of anyone you could have met. She was very generous with the love she had for everyone. If she didn‚Äôt love you or have love for you, something was wrong with you.

&gt; I‚Äôm not sure if my dad ever met a stranger, he could strike up a conversation with anyone and make them smile. He went years coaching youth sports and loved helping these children become better people.

&gt; They both loved their family very much and did anything and everything they could possibly do for them. Their love for family was greatest when it came to their grandchildren, nine of them in total. They wanted the best for their grandchildren, they would go out of their way just to make each one of them feel special. I had some pretty darn awesome parents.

&gt; I miss them so very much. I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôm going to deal without being about to talk to them every night on my ride home from work or not being able to send them pictures and videos of my family. I‚Äôll never be able to hug them, again. I‚Äôll never hear Mom sing happy birthday to anyone, again. I‚Äôll never see them smile when they see Liam and Ava come in the room. They won‚Äôt get to see their grandchildren grow up, or see many of their grandchildren graduate.

&gt; I know a lot of people believe they have/had the most loving, most caring, affectionate, and devoted parents, but they are wrong. That‚Äôs my parents. I only wish I could fill their shoes.

&gt; Hold your family close. Treat every moment with them like it‚Äôs your last, it could very well be. Love and keep on loving.

&gt; I just wish everyone could see them through my eyes. You would see the two most loving and caring couple, ever.

&gt;approval was briefly suspended for ponatinib, a medication to treat leukemia that had been approved just the year before on an accelerated basis. Emerging data showed that 24% of the patients who had been followed for a median of 1.3 years and 48% of those who had been followed for a median of 2.7 years had serious thromboembolic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke.1 The drug was allowed back on the market in December 2013 with more limited indications and a restricted distribution system.
&gt;Bedaquiline, a medication for the treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis, was approved in 2012 on the basis of the surrogate end point of sputum-culture conversion, even though the pivotal studies also showed an incidence of death (generally from tuberculosis) that was five times as high among patients given the drug than among those randomly assigned to receive standard treatment for MDR tuberculosis. The impact on individual patients must be further studied since there is a need for additional treatment options for this highly contagious disease. The confirmatory randomized trial that was mandated for bedaquiline was not required by the FDA to be completed until 2022.

Now you could argue what they said was *misleading*, but it wasn't *factually wrong*. 

Also you quoted ""You cant be infected in Sweden"" but nowhere was that being said in the article you linked. So that's just straight up wrong.

Regarding the ""peaks"", as far as I know those were predictions, and he was relatively spot on. Our peak was all the way back in April, and the links you posted are from March when he claimed we would soon see numbers start dropping. Now the only arguement here is he was off by a few weeks at most. Again those were predictions based on what they were seeing, they aren't from the future, so they have to make educated guesses. 

Regarding herd immunity, he clearly says in your video, the only way to truly get rid of Covid-19 is herd immunity is by **either** having people get infected and getting well again **or** vaccinating. I would also like to point out ""a level of immunity"" is wildly different from ""herd immunity"", he also never claimed ""herd immunity"" was part of their strategy. 

Regarding children being immune, here's what he said from the article you linked;

Until this year, it's been my ""dream job"" and the situation where we have 80%+ of students(/students' parents) electing to send them back to school (in an over-capacity building of \~8,000) has concerned me. We started remotely for about 3 weeks and just began back face-to-face about 2 weeks ago.

&amp;#x200B;

With my number of students, social distancing is impossible, period. My desks are less than five feet apart, and unless I move them back into place myself, they only scoot closer together by the hour every day. I have to clean the desks myself every hour, to the point where because I do not have enough time, I have to begin doing it during class (It's been expressed that having students do so themselves could be a health risk).

&amp;#x200B;

I have a few cloth masks I've put in a rotation for work, and a [3M facepiece](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008MCUULW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) with [some cartridges](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AEFCKKY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) I got off Amazon that I've been using in my classroom recently. The facepiece is actually more comfortable for shorter (under 1 hour) periods, but the weight with cartridges causes it to dig in to my nose a bit after a while. The cloth masks are all ""fine,"" but given the amount of talking I do in any given hour (combined with horrible seasonal allergies), can be a bit restricting (I find myself once or twice per class backing up toward the door to lift my cloth mask to take a few deep breaths). I'm cool with whatever covering I need, though, and I wash all of them regularly.

You'd think so but [the study](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6936a5.htm?s_cid=mm6936a5_x) doesn't really support that:

Community exposure 14 days before illness onset | Case-patients (Number, %) | Control group (Number, %) | Difference between groups (%)
-------------------------|----------:|----------:|----------:
Restaurant | 63 (40.9) | 44 (27.7) | **13.2**
Bar/Coffee shop|13 (8.5)|8 (5.0)|**3.5**
Church/Religious gathering|12 (7.8)|8 (5.0)|**2.8**
Gym|12 (7.8)|10 (6.3)|**1.5**
Public transportation|8 (5.2)|10 (6.3)|**-1.1**
Home, ‚â§10 persons|79 (51.3)|84 (52.5)|**-1.2**
Home, &gt;10 persons|21 (13.6)|24 (15.0)|**-1.4**
Salon|24 (15.6)|28 (17.6)|**-2**
Shopping|131 (85.6)|141 (88.1)|**-2.5**
Office setting|37 (24.0)|47 (29.6)|**-5.6**

Aside from restaurant visits, the Covid patients hadn't really engaged in risky behaviours much more than the control group. In fact, control participants were slightly more likely to have visited a salon in the previous 14 days, which I would have expected to be a marker for risky behaviour.

Restaurant exposure was the only statistically significant difference, partly because the study size was small (154 Covid patients and 160 control participants).

Differences in self-reported mask use were small and not statistically significant (p-value = 0.86):

The bar/coffee shop question was problematic. Uncontrolled numbers were 13 to 8 (sick, not sick).  Apparently 5x as many people ate in restaurants (107) than went to starbucks, which seems ludicrous.

Add in that they had to P-hack the 21 bar/coffee shop patrons to come up with something significant is a shame.

The public transport is an encouraging finding, at least until you look and see that only about 18 people rode it in the study, and the split between sick and control was pretty even (8 to 10, respectively).

There seems to be some research that shows that marital success is inversely correlated with how much you spend on your wedding (including rings, etc).   

My wife and I got married in the courthouse, with like 5 family members present.   It was awesome.   We didn't dress up, didn't make a big production of it.   We never even bought each other rings (we remain ring-less!).   It was my mom, her mom, her brother, her brother's wife, and their kid.    We went out for a nice lunch (10 dollar a plate kind of situation) and that was that.

In other words, if you WANTED to simplify how you handle your wedding, there is no shame in it, and some research seems to suggest that it could be good.   The added benefit is that, in addition to losing the stress of having a big production for a wedding, you also would lose the stress of having a particularly dangerous wedding.

It's a super personal thing, so again, I intend no judgment or criticism.   Whatever you folks end up doing, I wish you the best!   Getting married is stressful, but if you've laid the groundwork for it (compatible world views, good communication skills, a willingness to work on your problems together, trust, etc), it is one of the best things in life.

Edit: Yikes, gettin some downvotes here.    I really only intend to say that one could conceivably get multiple birds stoned at the same time: cheaper, less stressful wedding (yay?), which statistically correlates with a more successful marriage (yay?), and simultaneously is safer in terms of covid, because fewer people/festivities (yay?).   

Again, let me point out that I criticized no one!   There is a lot of pressure in our society to do things a certain way, and sometimes those ways are against our best interests.   It's good to point out alternatives.   I don't intend to pressure anyone, only to point out alternatives!

A closed-door agreement between individuals in power to band together against the interest of another group or individuals, usually for personal gain or some sort of pay off. Not all conspiracy theories are wrong.  


The difference between valid conspiracies and random, 'dumb' conspiracy theorists is; Journalists and people that actually have the necessary logical structure to 'investigate' things can back up their claims with facts and evidence that are not circumstancial, that are not open to interpretation, and that without the smallest amount of doubt reveal said conspiracies to the public.   


The logical person isn't going to trust some anonymous post on a dubious internet site that's actually known for trolling and riling up idiots with an opinion piece with no reference to any evidence whatsoever except blatant 'opinions'.  


The 'logical' person also isn't going to say something stupid like 'The Covid virus is man made'. Not without having actual evidence for this claim. He will either be a researcher himself and investigate this by inspecting the virus, or he will listen to said 'experts' knowing he is out of his intellectual depth to fully comprehend what would unveil this virus as being 'man made'.   


Instead, the average conspiracy theorist is for some reason so convinced of his 'logical abilities' that instead to be humble, he believes his 'instinct' is superior to specialists that sacrifice 20+ years of their life to even fully comprehend a very narrow, specific field of research. Instead, unable to let go of this arrogance (because it feels good to imagine you're privy to some big secrets on the virtue of your superior 'instinct), you default to believing that everything opposing your position is automatically 'in' on the conspiracy or of 'lesser' intellect, aka (Brainwashed sheep / NPC's).  


So in short, the difference between someone that logically assesses the possibility for a conspiracy, and a dumbass conspiracy theorist out of his depth, is that emotionally charged, fact empty response you just made more interested in painting an empty strawman argument filled with wild accusations of what someone thinks of your position based on one single line of text.",,1599948099,{},g4zkdz3,False,t3_irfvgs,False,False,t1_g4za40m,/r/Coronavirus/comments/irfvgs/even_conspiracy_theories_that_do_not_deny_the/g4zkdz3/,1600012409,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

It is a measure of the percentage of people in general that will require being admitted if they get covid. So when the title says that vitamin d supplements can decrease the covid ICU admission rate, it means it can lower that general statistical percentage. Not that you as an individual will definitely have a lower chance of being admitted. Chances are you would, but that's not what it means. It is not misleading, the words just don't mean what you're assuming they mean.

Second, did you read the article? Nowhere does it state what you're saying. The last sentence:

&gt;The study authors said in a statement, ""Our pilot study demonstrated that administration of a high dose of Calcifediol or 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the main metabolite of vitamin D endocrine system, significantly reduced the need for ICU treatment of patients requiring hospitalization due to proven Covid-19.‚Äù

This study specifically looked at people who had been admitted to the hospital for covid and the rate at which that group of people were then transferred to the ICU after they were given high doses of vitamin D. So if anything, the title is only misleading in that it doesn't mean Vitamin D supplements in general can reduce the admission rate, but that high doses of vitamin D supplements given to those that are already sick and in the hospital can reduce the admission rate of those people to the ICU.

It has been a complete joke, and causes nothing but stress yelling and chaos.  I have two kids who don't know how to read, kindergarten and first grade and a 1-year-old.  I also have an older child who is also in virtual School.

The kindergartner and first reader meet for 20 minutes in the morning with their whole class.  The first grader does nothing academic during this time, The teacher asks one question for the day and each kid gets to respond, done.

She then gets two live 15 minute sessions for 100% of her academics.  It's been 5 weeks and she's had two 15 minute math lessons.  

She then has to write three sentences in a journal each day and gets one assignment on Monday through Thursdays, but none on Fridays.

She's quite literally not learning how to read.  There are no sight words no phonics no blends no worksheets no books to read.  This is public school in Florida.

I could care less about teaching my kids from home, but I find it absolutely ridiculous that nobody has put together some kind of program at state, nation, etc..anywhere for these kids.  She can't read and nobody is teaching her to read.  

I have a one-year-old and the second I turn my head he is trying to climb onto the oven to turn the buttons on. He naps maybe one hour a day, so it is impossible for me to do all of the kids academics.

So for everyone think school is a daycare, I don't use it as a day care whatsoever I use it as an education for my kids.  I don't care where they are getting their education from, but it needs to be from somewhere.

I don't know why they won't have great teachers put together amazing lessons that kids can do from the TV.  We have so many resources and none of them are being utilized.  

There's also nobody to bring up these issues with.  I wrote the principal in email and said my daughter's regressing and reading what can we do, she literally responded with an email saying go to another school.  I followed up and said these are all my concerns, 30 minutes of live academics isn't enough for the entire day.  she can't read The main way to talk to her teacher is with text, so she can't even text her teacher because she can't write. The principal followed up with a second email that said did you not see my first email, please let me know if you would like to withdraw her.

So I'm getting really frustrating hearing people say, it's so easy to do these virtual programs or we're using the schools for daycares.  I'm not using the school at all, but my child is not getting an education.  So, If they don't want us in the schools why hasn't anybody put something good together for a kindergartner and a first grader.  they're quite literally are no consequences to not educating the children in the virtual program.

First or second wave, it‚Äôs semantics.

[],,guarea,,,[],,,,text,t2_1tbpy1el,False,False,[],"University of Alabama officials had been hinting all week at improvements in coronavirus testing numbers ahead of the Friday evening release.

UA System Chancellor Finis St. John was the latest to tease the positive news Friday afternoon after¬†Dr. Deborah Birx spoke on the Tuscaloosa campus.

The numbers went live a few hours later and they were down considerably. Only 294 students tested positive from Sept. 4-10 on the Tuscaloosa campus after recording 846 on the previous seven days, though Labor Day weekend had students away from campus until Tuesday.

The numbers represent positives identified through ‚Äúsentinel testing, point of care testing in campus health centers, common location exposure testing, and self-reported tests from private providers,‚Äù according to¬†the dashboard¬†on the UA System website.

‚ÄúThe testing we‚Äôve been doing at the University of Alabama has been working,‚Äù St. John said Friday afternoon. ‚ÄúI could not be more proud of our students.‚Äù

The number of daily positive tests dipped to 42 over the previous seven days after that figure sat at 125 last week. Occupancy in isolation/quarantine space was down to 15.18% on Friday after sitting at 39.97% last Friday.

Testing numbers had been considerably lower on the UAB and UA-Huntsville campuses. The new round posted Friday included 27 new cases at UAB and 11 at UA-Huntsville.
 
In all, 2,183 students on the Tuscaloosa campus have tested positive since classes resumed Aug. 19. That represents 6.9% of the student body attending classes on the main campus according to enrollment numbers released Friday.

The numbers still lack a degree of context to better understand the situation. AL.com asked Dean of UA‚Äôs College of Community Health Sciences Dr. Ricky Friend on Wednesday the breakdown of students who are showing symptoms verses those who were asymptomatic. He did not have the number on hand and requests for follow ups have not yielded an answer.

In terms of localized hospitalizations, DCH Hospital in Tuscaloosa reported 47 inpatients were being treated as of Friday. That‚Äôs up from the 38 reported Thursday, the lowest total in months. DCH also reported 3.5% of those 18-24 who tested positive required inpatient care at the hospital.

The Friday testing numbers followed an update to campus operations in a note from Vice President for Student Life Myron Pope to students. He is relaxing some of the restrictions placed on gatherings beginning Monday, Sept. 14 after putting the new guidelines in place two days after classes began Aug. 19.

 Dorm study areas can reopen along with dining rooms ‚Äúwith strict adherence to safety guidelines,‚Äù Pope wrote. Colleges and departments can also hold events with a maximum of 50 people indoors and 100 outdoors. And students living in the same dorm can visit each other‚Äôs rooms as long as masks are worn, and social distancing is observed.

Student organized events are still prohibited.

‚ÄúThe gradual loosening of moratorium restrictions will continue to be evaluated as we move forward,‚Äù Pope wrote. ‚ÄúWith your continued cooperation, and as our numbers for testing and student conduct cases continue to improve, we will consider longer-term plans for the semester.‚Äù",,1599866160,{},g4vlbrv,True,t3_ir090v,False,True,t3_ir090v,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ir090v/alabama_reports_large_dip_in_covid19_positives/g4vlbrv/,1599874310,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Lots to say here, I'm not sure how much of it will be helpful, but here goes... I'll offer my thoughts point-by-point on your dad's comments. 

&gt; ‚Äúwhy is it that corona is revealed only when more testing is done? Why aren‚Äôt people reporting it themselves? I mean, we don‚Äôt see people dying on the streets by not being able to breath. I don‚Äôt get how this can spread and people are still somehow ok‚Äù

I'm not sure what point he is trying to make by saying ""why is corona only revealed when more testing is done""... like, *of course* this is the case. Pregnancy tests confirm pregnancies. HIV tests confirm HIV. In both of these examples, people could (in theory) be walking around not knowing they are pregnant, or not knowing they are HIV positive, until the test confirms it. Similarly, COVID tests confirm COVID. If this is supposed to be a weird ""aha, gotcha"" moment on your dad's part that supports the theory that COVID is a hoax, that testing equals higher numbers, it just doesn't make any sense. Testing equals higher *confirmed* numbers. 

""Why aren't people reporting it themselves"": ...but dad, they are? In the hundreds of thousands? Where I live (Toronto), the lineups at hospitals are hours and hours long, because so many people are doing the right thing and getting tested, whether they have mild symptoms or whether they think they might have been exposed and have no symptoms. Again, this point of your dad's makes no sense. 

""We don‚Äôt see people dying on the streets by not being able to breath""... because they're in the hospital by that point. People get sicker and sicker, they begin to struggle to breathe and go to the hospital, and they either A) get lucky and recover and get out, or B) die there. 

I will admit, there is an element of ""out of sight, out of mind"" to COVID. It is hard, mentally, to gauge the gravity of the situation when you can't really *see* the body toll, the human face of it. Human brains are notoriously bad at comprehending and contextualizing large numbers, so it's easy for figures like ""190,000 Americans dead"" or ""900,000 dead worldwide"" to... not mean much of anything at all. To his point, if people were rolling around and passing away in the streets, zombie apocalypse-style, or if countries were digging massive open graves for the bodies, people like your dad might have an easier time ""getting it"" and cluing in. As is, it's hard for us to contextualize it. But that doesn't mean people aren't dying on a massive, massive scale. Or scarier, surviving with horrible affects (strokes, heart attacks, permanent lung damage) which isn't reflected in the death tolls, as these people are simply marked as ""recovered"". 

&gt; I tried explaining that it can be asymptomatic or mild, but still be covid-19

Like you say, and I'd hammer this point home to him, one of the scariest parts of this virus is that a lot of people may have it and be asymptomatic. Which is fine for them (maybe? long term effects unknown, we'll get to that in a minute), but NOT fine for the many people they come into contact with and unknowingly spread to, particularly if those folks are vulnerable. 

Did you ever do the ""double a penny, twice a day"" logic problem in school? It goes like this: you can take $1000 up front, or you can take $0.01, but it doubles every day for 30 days. To many/most it seems like $1000 would make most sense... but the doubled $0.01 ends up being over $5.3M by the 30 day mark. I guess the point I'm making is the spread, when things double, is pretty significant, and there's evidence to support that COVID has an [R0](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MTXqF6BAZt4zDAkBQCU5R9Ev718=/0x0:950x1757/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:950x1757):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19862327/Viruses_with_corona_update_high_res.jpg) (pronounced ""r naught"") of about 2, so similar to the penny problem (if no precautions taken). 1 people infect 2, infect 4, infect 8... and suddenly we're at a few million. 

If I were you, I'd leave your dad with two sentiments:

One, we don't know what this virus' long term effects will be. [This](https://www.facebook.com/wncamy/posts/10221028229648392) is a post that went viral over the summer and was initially misattributed to Fauci, but it wasn't him. Regardless, it's well said. TLDR, talks about how things like herpes, AIDS, stay in your system *for ever* and we still don't understand them fully, and we've had decades to learn. COVID is terrifying in this regard. 

Two, I forget who this quote came from, but it was making the rounds early in the pandemic, but it went something like ""success with COVID will look like an overreaction"". If we do well with this, it will look like everything is okay and we extremely overreacted. That's where we are at now. We need to keep it up.

I would get takeout and remove it from the package and put it on my plates then wash my hands. Refused to let my family touch anything until it was plated.

The virus must get into your lungs. Your nasal passages. There is zero way for it to get from your GI tract to your respiratory system.  

Currently NO evidence of transmission through FOOD.

It is simply not food bourne:  
https://www.consumerreports.org/food-safety/coronavirus-common-questions-about-the-food-you-eat-food-safety/   

Viruses don't spread through food. Ever. None do. Bacteria does.

Even the Canadian's agree:  
The virus is not believed to be transmitted by eating food because it is destroyed during digestion by the acids in your stomach.

And finally. I'm living proof bro/sis. I've eaten at a few restaurants lately, sure... But the amount of delivery and takeout I've eaten since this shit started and our restaurants opened would absolutely blow your fucking mind. It's damn near embarrassing. But we've done ok financially during this whole bullshit, we like to eat out and we want to help our local restaurants. If it was possible to get sick eating food there's no possible way I could be this lucky.

Did he deserve to die? Abso-fucking-lutely not. Neither do any of the people his fiancee will be coming into contact with as she breathes potential infection onto them.

One thing can be true (this is sad and unfair) while another thing is also true (that is a not a useful way to wear a mask) and pretending otherwise is just childish.

Blaming the government and supermarket employees for issues with food stamps or WIC. No one made you have kids.

Tests in some states have gone way down while tests in other states have gone up or remained high. It made me feel like the number of actual tests was no longer a good number to go by. So I created a quick Java utility to create a graph of estimated Covid-19 cases using current positive numbers adjusted using state by state testing data from mid-July.

\---

**Methodology**

Each data point is a leading 7 day average of positive tests. For adjusted numbers I took the leading 7 day average and multiplied it by the ratio of the 7 day average mid-july total tests to the 7 day average of total tests for that data point. The yellow line assumes the positive rate on tests above the reported number will only be 80% of the reported positive rate. I did this in an attempt to show the diminishing returns that testing can have.

This methodology is better than simply comparing national numbers because it compares each state to itself. Ensuring that increased testing in New York doesn't hide the decreased testing of Florida.

For the most part its fallen more in line with other viral infections than we initially expected.

The rate it goes after other organs is exceptionally high, however its still staying within the bounds of what you'd expect for the most part.

Many virologists and epidemiologists alike believe OC43 caused severe disease much like COVID when it first crossed from cows to humans. The theory that OC43 caused the Russian Flu Epidemic of 1889 being mistaken for an influenza is growing in support and evidence. Now OC43 just causes a rather nasty cold. 

Its likely a lot of what sets this virus apart is the fact its novel and we're seeing the what it can do before its had time to mutate downward and have humans gain immunity to it with all of the science world focused on it, we've never observed a novel virus like this cause a pandemic in the modern world. A novel influenza this contagious would likely be reeking havoc on the body as well. As SARS did, luckly that was mutating much more rapidly and due to the infection timeline between containment efforts and the virus dead-ending itself we managed to get out of that one.

Many virologists seem to think chances are good this will eventually be another low level endemic disease causing a rather nasty cold like the other coronviruses that have been around a while. Immunity through vaccination and infection will weaken it, as will the deleterious nature of RNA viruses which usually mutate downwards.

Our hope should have been that a worldwide scattershot approach with multiple candidates using different technologies, some proven, others experimental, could produce at least a single safe and effective vaccine. Instead, from the beginning the Anglo-Americans jumped on their geopolitical bandwagon and hyped first Moderna, then Oxford, while actively disparaging candidates like Sputnik V and the Chinese efforts, undermining any possibility those vaccines would be widely accepted. With hope fading on options A and B, now everyone's jumping ship to team Pfizer.

The facts are the mRNA candidates were always longshots and the published data on the Oxford/AstraZeneca candidate were among the worst even before this issue. It's time to drop the arrogance.

You can bet your ass all 4 of them have Covid after the first DAY of school.  The first DAY was Friday the week before, and then Sunday until now they are just sick.  Newborn also has it.  Yay us.

Luckily (???), the adults (husband and I) already had it in December (we were having to go to a major town to do my medical appointments, and got it from the OB in that town).  So, we aren't really sick like the kids are.  When we went to get the testing done, kids 1 and 2 saw many of their classmates in line, too.  So, definitely an outbreak...and we are rural.  Maybe 100 kids total in our school system here (K-12).

There are no online options, at all.  If the kids get sick, they get sick and have to go back to school.  They do require masks at the school, but kid 2 overheard one of the kids saying ""Thank God you all are wearing masks, so I don't have to!"" and was later caught spitting on other kids.  Before you think this was some like 6 yr old, nope kid is 12.  We ripped the kids out of school immediately (some teacher was complaining we did this today and it pissed me off), and told them we won't be back until there are better precautions and online schooling, or a vaccine.  I'm back to homeschooling them in the meantime, which is what we were doing before.  Not fun while trying to work and take care of a newborn, especially with 5 total kids.

Fuck.

Edit:  We only go into town and leave our property once a month, nowhere near when school started (3 weeks 4 days before they went).  We have strict regimes when it comes to going out into public and coming home, due to the baby mostly and not wanting her sick (didn't help much, I guess).  We work from home, and don't live near anyone - in the woods.

I'm not sure I follow what you're saying.  German kids never wore masks, even when they were getting 6-7k new cases per day.  

Germany decided to institute a mask mandate in late April, but to have kids under 6-7 (it varies by region) exempt from the mandate.

&gt;If the restrictions had been lighter to begin with, and damaged the economy less, then there would be more room to keep enforcing them, and maybe even imposing a lockdown if hospitals were close to being overwhelmed. 

The is still both money and room to enforce a lockdown, even though a ""total"" won't be necessary.

There is no herd immunity anywhere.

No - significantly. 

&gt;Compared to the trillions destroyed in the world economy this justification of lockdowns would be a colossal waste of money.

No. Sweden lost more money than us. It does not help the economy to just let is loose. 

It destroys your consumption that people by their own choice don't go out. If there are tons of sick people, many people simply will stay home and not go out and spend money, and that kills the economy.

I work in a tourist company and that place lost like 50% at least of turnover. And that is a place that did good. Talked to people who work for other places, and some have ost like 90% of their business and are off course firing scores of people.

This is long after the lockdown. It is FIVE months after the lockdown, plus it was also like like in the 3 months where we had virtually no cases. Like 1 a day and nobody in hospital for weeks at a time.

Tbh the only custumers are like ""crazy loosers with no money"" that only do tourist stuff because they are crazy and don't understand what corona is, plus the price is dumped to far down maybe it is the chance in their lifetime to afford it lol.

People just don't do tourist stuff atm, even though eveything is open. That would be even worse if there had been no lockdown.

Freshmen (first-years) are required to live in the dorms, for most of them this will be a single small room that two people share. The larger freshmen dorms hold almost 1,000 people. Bathrooms are communal and shared by around 40 people.

Downtown has been pretty packed and maskless on weekends despite last-call having been moved from 2am to 11:30pm and many off-campus parties have been documented. 

About 25% of undergraduates are involved with sororities and fraternities, which are known for huge parties and frequent socials, and while officially those events have been ended or socially distanced and many people are minimizing the role of those organizations in the spread of COVID-19 at UGA, there's been evidence to suggest that at least some are holding ""secret socials"" and taking socially-distanced pictures only for the IG while otherwise continuing as normal.

So all the pieces for it to be a disaster are there, then on top of that any COVID-19 testing is completely voluntary, reporting of a positive COVID-19 result to the university is ""required"" but there's no system in place to enforce consequences for not doing so (and there have been many testimonies from people whose friends have gone off-campus to get tested and avoid reporting a positive result or just not bothered to get tested because they don't want to go through the hassle of isolation housing or returning home), the isolation housing is apparently full anyway, lecturers and professors aren't allowed to inform students in their classes if another student reports a positive result because classes are ""socially-distanced"" and UGA is operating under the belief that a magical barrier exists at 6 feet that the virus can't penetrate.

I imagine you've been following recommendations while in Virginia as has your family (hopefully), and you have been avoiding situations that where you are at high risk of infection if exposed (i.e., you haven't been attending raves full of unmasked people), so it's unlikely you've been infected. Strictly speaking you shouldn't go out at all for 14 days, but realistically there's no enforcement mechanism, and if you're arriving by train you probably won't be instructed to fill out any forms like they do for people on direct flights from the restricted list (which I believe they use to text reminders about quarantine). When you get home just continue to play it safe and avoid unnecessary activities that put you in close proximity to other people, especially indoors. So go to the grocery store, but try to limit the number of trips you take (which you should be doing anyways), go for a walk or run outside, sit in a park and read if you want, just wear a mask and stay away from others, maybe hold off on going to dinner with friends for a little while, and do takeaway rather than eating in (even though eating in restaurants can be safe). You don't need to be tested, just be careful.

Of you look at hospital admissions and deaths, still around ten deaths a day.

The most recent estimate of IFR in the UK is 0.3%, but that's based on seroprevalence studies that we now know massively undercount the number of infected.

Mortality here is more likely to be 0.2% or lower, in places with very thorough testing it's hitting about 0.15%.

If you multiply our number of dead by 500 (0.2%), you get about a third of our population is recovered and at least strongly resistant or immune for a meaningful length of time as we've seen only a dozen or so cases of reinfection, and t cell responses look good.

Sweden which hasn't locked down has had around the nearly same number of deaths per capita, and admissions and deaths are just wanting away.

Sweden 573 per million

UK 625 per million (higher dark skinned population vulnerable to Covid).

In fact everyone seems to be stabilizing at the high five hundreds to low six hundreds, no matter what they did.

""Most of our deaths occurred in nursing homes"".  That's probably true, but 3574 people under the age of 60 died in Canada.  Not many of those were in nursing homes, perhaps none.  So even if you compare the 7 in Taiwan to the 3500 in Canada it still isn't even close.  We are only talking about deaths at this point, not infections.  If Taiwan had the same infection rate as Canada then all those old age people at home would be at statistically the same probability whether or not they were in a old age home or at home.  In fact, if we had controlled who entered these old age homes then we would have had an easy way to prevent infection from entering.  We didn't do that until to late. 

""Any country with low nursing home commitment rates would have much lower death rates."" You need to back this up with a fact, otherwise it is just speculation.  In reality we can compare those countries that had experience with Sars and other related infections and see what they did.  Canada did a report on the experience with Sars but the recommendations were not followed. Taiwan reviewed it's handling of Sars and did follow it's own report recommendations. 

The reality is that most of those 9000 deaths were preventable.  You know full well that our most populated (highest density) areas are where most of the infections rates have been the highest.  Taiwan's population density makes even our highest population density look trivial.  If you compare Taipei to Toronto as far as population density, Taipei is twice that of Toronto and their total populatoin is roughly the same 2.6 m to 2.9 million people.

So those 9000 deaths were more than preventable.  For god's sake, we were being told that masks made no difference.

The data is okay, its been determined as pretty safe, the efficacy hasn't been determined in humans yet. The Pfizer vaccine and the Chinese vaccines look the most promising to me out of ones in phase III. They appear to be hitting the right goals for preventing some combo of retransmission and severe disease. I highly doubt any from the first wave of vaccines will hit 70%. That would be a huge success at the pace they've been working at.

Oxford would actually be the one I would guess falls under 50% if any of them do. In the monkey trials it prevented severe disease more than retransmission. It seems like a ""safe bet"" to me, but I have doubts it will be as effective as other frontrunners.

Maybe, but it doesn't have to be.  Emergency authorizations exist and can be limited in scope.

We know that the virus is considerably more deadly for the elderly than for kids, for example.  For the elderly, it's truly terrifying - roughly half of the nearly 200,000 US deaths have happened in nursing homes and long term care facilities, despite the fact those facilities house only 0.6% of the population. For kids, it's not even as bad as a seasonal flu.  There's well under 100 deaths.

Logically then, it wouldn't make sense to apply the same degree of risk aversion to both.  For example, let's assume the vaccine outright kills 1 in 100 people that take it (way worse than is conceivable, but assume it for the sake of argument).  You would never give it to every child.  The losses don't close to make up for the lives saved.  You might still give it to all nursing home residents though.  5% of them have already died and people are saying another 200,000 people will die before the end of the year.  Having 1% die will save 5%.

The video digs into this exact topic, and just why it can be so catastrophic to release a vaccine too early. We are already taking the risks you are wanting us to take by releasing a vaccine if we make it in early 2021, we are already going ""well, this is a slightly risky crapshoot putting it out so soon, but it's worth the risk"" by putting it out with the current time estimates. This is rushing, right now, already. The goal is to release something that were 99% sure isn't going to kill you or be more damaging than the virus itself (but could still be damaging), and at least has some efficacy. 2021 is how long it takes to actually get to that point, at max possible speed.

If you throw whatever candidates out right now, it'd be rolling dice that could easily kill (yes, kill) just as many people, if not more, than covid. It'd be the equivalent of trying to inject yourself with random shit you read about on homeopathy Reddits to rid yourself of bad karma that is giving you the virus.

1. I don't think draconian enforcement of mask laws is the way to go. What we need is the availability of BETTER masks.

They are still wildly expensive and half the country believes that they only exist ""for healthcare workers"", but if the virus truly is airborne, this is what we need.

2. Like with the right masks, even if not everyone gets the vaccine, if ENOUGH people do, the spread will be much less significant. Forcing laws like this will just sow further distrust among the American people... that's the biggest problem we have right now.

3. You didn't address this one so I'm guessing you agree with it?

4. They have been doing this, and while I'm honestly concerned that all this ""free money"" will run out, it's really not something we can address while in the midst of this.

Restaurants came back really badly in the survey which is how the headlines are written.  Just as a point of comparison, this is [what CNN said](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/10/health/restaurant-dining-covid-19-cdc-study-wellness/index.html) about the other activities:

&gt;There were no significant differences between those who tested positive  versus negative when it came to shopping, gathering with fewer than 10  people in a home, going to an office, going to a gym, going to a salon,  using public transportation or attending religious gatherings, according  to the study. 

That's fine as far as it goes but the [CDC report](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6936a5.htm?s_cid=mm6936a5_w) also covers in home gatherings larger than 10 people, a point CNN omitted.

&gt;No significant differences were observed in the bivariate analysis  between case-patients and control-participants in shopping; gatherings  with ‚â§10 persons in a home; going to an office setting; going to a  salon; **gatherings with &gt;10 persons in a home**; going to a gym; using  public transportation; going to a bar/coffee shop; or attending  church/religious gathering. 

Also  interesting is the qualitative difference in restaurants in the infected vs control groups.

So, from this small sample, we don't see spread from churches, gyms, salons, household gatherings (any size), offices, or public transit.

This part about restaurants is interesting:

**Restaurant: others following recommendations such as wearing a face covering or mask of any kind or social distancing (n = 107)**   

||Sick #/%|Control #/%|
|:-|:-|:-|
|None/A few  |12 (19.0) |1 (2.3)  |
|About half/Most  |25 (39.7) |21 (47.7)   |
|Almost all  |26 (41.3) | 22 (50.0)  |

I had a friend whom I met on the bus. We chatted a lot. She worked to keep her welfare payments and childcare. She smoked a lot of pot, had issues with getting things like diapers and toilet paper, as do many on welfare. I gave her money, not a loan...just a helping hand. When a good job with the IRS came along, and she got it, I was elated for her. Jobs like this came with guaranteed retirement, excellent health benefits, and were hard to be fired from. She would be set for life. 

A month later, I saw her. She looked bedraggled. When I asked her what was wrong, she begged me not to judge her if she told me the truth. I agreed, so she explained rather sheepishly: She called in sick several times, and had a friend punch her timecard. They found out. She was fired. I was astonished. She had taken a secure future and thrown it in the toilet. Perhaps it was that she had lived with welfare for so long that she couldn't handle actual responsibility. Maybe it was the pot. Either way, I have learned that the welfare system does not help people to help themselves. It is a series of burning hoops to be jumped through, to stay alive. 

Additionally, the argument of homosexuality was one that hit home. I lived as a child and teenager in a completely heterosexual community. I never understood that my violin teacher was ""gay"". I knew he was a bit strange, but...so was Liberace, and everyone loved him!

When high school started, I was happy to find an enclave of writers to hang out with. One day, while discussing my friends in that group, an older alumni caringly and gently told me that the two matriarchs of the club were bisexual. I told him that he was doing it because her was jealous of my friendship with them, and I was angry. For days I kept it to myself, and then one day, inexplicably, the two jumped on each other in front of me, locked in a throat tickling kiss and embrace that no heterosexual would ever conceive of. I had time to ponder it. I accepted it, because the evidence was right before my eyes.

Is it though? It seems you may have been misled. The Wall Street Journal did publish an article with a headline saying that the hospital data reporting was switching back to the CDC's system, based on a (supposedly misinterpreted) statement from Dr. Birx, but that reporting was amended with an update less than a day later when the HHS released press statements denying any such policy reversion:

&gt;However, when reached for comment today, HHS denied the characterization of the WSJ article. The data collection system will reportedly still be processed through HHS, according to the agency, while the CDC‚Äôs involvement is said to be limited to the creation of an automated reporting process that will ease the burden on the daily reporting of this data by hospitals.

&gt;‚ÄúHHS made repeated attempts to explain to the Wall Street Journal that the process for COVID-19 data reporting has not and is not changing. This false reporting will sow more confusion and only undermines the public health response,‚Äùsaid Michael Caputo, HHS assistant secretary for public affairs.

&gt;The HHS spokesperson did not directly respond to a question about why Birx would have said that the new data-reporting system would be ‚Äúmoved back to the CDC‚Äù if indeed that is not the case.

Most people who get covid recover. Nobody on here will sit here and dispute that. Nobody on here is saying its incredibly the most dangerous disease around.

A fraction of those die.

All viruses are like this. However COVID-19 has a much larger chance of being in the latter two categories than most diseases. Especially for old people. 

This is compounded by the lack of prior immunity exponentially. If the R of this virus was smaller, it would probably have not been an issue.

If cases keep falling in Sweden as it enters fall then we'll know that the herd immunity threshold is closer to the 20-30% many projected. So far even as we transition into fall Sweden is seeing the virus fade away.

That's not why I did it.

&gt;Because right now you are toxic as fuck and no one likes you. 

Says the guy who is calling a stranger on the internet names and making assumptions about someone he has never met. 

&gt;You know nothing about me

Right, this should be a basis for not making assumptions about somebody.

&gt;I truly hope you grow out of this nasty disgusting phase of your life and become a better person. Because right now you are toxic as fuck and no one likes you.

Really weird thing to say about someone who you have never met WHILE ASSERTING that this same person doesn't know you and shouldn't make assumptions about you.

&gt;yet you still decided that you needed to start ranting about how much you despise me.

I never spoke about you personally, I spoke about Californians and how they are ruining all the other states. You took it personally. When I've commented on your behavior, I've only used the things you've said to me in this thread. Meanwhile you seem to think you have a read on who I am as a person, who in my life likes me, my mental state...

&gt;I hope you get the help you need.

Got therapy a while ago for moving past the shock of realizing the california leftist mentality was destroying my life. Now I have a great job, wife, dog, own my house, work from home, kid coming soon. My life is great man. Maybe you should take a look at your own life and see if you're projecting a little here. Not unlike how Californians need to take a look at what they did to their own state and not bring it to other places, since in my experience they tend to flee the burning wasteland they turned their state into, show up in a new place, demand sympathy, and start criticizing how they do things.

&gt;And you're welcome for making your 401k account grow. Without California's tech companies your retirement date would be pushed back 10 years. So damn ungrateful.

This is such a weird comment. Most of my assets are invested in home equity, and my wife has hers in real estate overseas, so as long as y'all don't show up and burn down my state, I'll be fine.

This is with vaccination. 

Because of heterogeneity the HIT via spread is lower.

How much lower?

No idea. Nobody does. It's insanely hard to model.

We won't know for sure for a few more months but places that were trying to get herd immunity seem to have reached it around 20%. The virus has been fading rapidly from Sweden for months and is now approaching de facto elimination.

States like Arizona and FL are probably around 20-30% and again the virus is rapidly fading away in both even without a lockdown.

Multiple serosurvey's in NYC places it around 25% infected by April which again is when the virus rapidly faded away.



Also:

&gt;230 million would be needed for herd immunity, at a 5% mortality rate that would be 10million+ dead


5% is not even in the general ballpark. You are by a factor of at least 10x. At least.

So yes. We should deal with racism.

How much inequality am I ok with? That is a good question. I think it matters how you measure inequality. I think the right way to go about the inequality problem is with a UBI. I don‚Äôt have as much of a problem with inequality as I do with absolute poverty. I don‚Äôt really get jealous when I see people with more stuff than I do. Part of why I have what I have is because of conscious decisions to give those things up to go after pursuits I personally find more meaningful. But I can understand how some people would be uncomfortable if they only had the amount that I have. And I plan on giving even more up to pursue another life which will put me technically below the ‚Äúpoverty‚Äù line. But I do know from living that way before that to me, that was a more meaningful way to live, so I will be more than happy with that. So being through all of the highs and lows myself through consciously made decisions, I realize the problematic nature of having other people decide what people should have. But by giving everyone enough that most people would reasonably agree that it is enough to survive on, then letting people set their own priorities from there. Different people in different situations have different needs, and people have different priorities.

In one of the nation‚Äôs sharpest clashes over school reopening, officials in Des Moines say Iowa‚Äôs Republican governor is pushing them to risk public safety.

No matter how much tension has surrounded the reopening of schools during the coronavirus pandemic, most state and local officials have found a way to arrive at some sort of plan by the first day of classes.

But not in Des Moines, where school began this week with local officials openly defying Iowa‚Äôs governor and a judge‚Äôs order by teaching remotely. The decision puts the district‚Äôs funding and administrators‚Äô jobs at risk, and leaves students locked out of athletics and their parents uncertain whether online classes will even count.

The conflict is perhaps the nation‚Äôs starkest example of the tension between Republican state officials, who have followed the lead of President Trump in pushing schools to reopen classrooms, and local administrators, often in Democratic-leaning cities, who fear that in-person instruction will put students‚Äô and teachers‚Äô health in danger.

‚ÄúIt kind of feels like science versus politics,‚Äù the Des Moines schools superintendent, Thomas Ahart, said. ‚ÄúThe last thing I want to do is make this political. What I desperately want to do is to be able to honestly tell my staff and my students and their families that I‚Äôm doing everything in my power to keep them safe.‚Äù


Gov. Kim Reynolds, for her part, argued on Thursday that by pushing schools to open classrooms, she was prioritizing the needs of the most vulnerable students. ‚ÄúWe just simply cannot afford to let our students be left behind even in these most challenging times,‚Äù Ms. Reynolds, a Republican, said at a news conference.

The dispute is playing out as Iowa remains hard hit by the pandemic. Over the past week, the state has had the nation‚Äôs third-highest number of new coronavirus cases per capita, according to New York Times tracking data.

‚ÄúI certainly would not feel comfortable sending my kids to school at that level,‚Äù said Dr. Ashish Jha, the dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, who has advocated opening schools in places like the Northeast that have significantly fewer new cases per capita.

Iowa officials have said that 15 percent of a county‚Äôs coronavirus tests must be positive over a two-week period before its schools can close their doors ‚Äî a threshold that is at least triple what many public health experts have recommended, and one that Dr. Jha called ‚Äúoutlandishly

Districts in counties that remain below the 15 percent test positivity threshold must offer at least 50 percent of their classes in person, the governor ordered in July. Polk County, which includes Des Moines, had an average positivity rate of about 8 percent over the past two weeks.
The clash between local and state officials escalated on Tuesday, the first day of school in Des Moines, when a state judge refused the district‚Äôs request to block the state order while the two sides fight a legal battle, leaving the district in defiance of both the governor and the courts as it has continued to teach online this week.

Early this summer, state officials and the district seemed to be on the same page. The state had approved a reopening plan for Des Moines, the superintendent said, under which its 32,000 students could choose between learning remotely or returning to school one or two days a week.


But things changed after Mr. Trump began a concerted push for in-person learning, tweeting on July 6, ‚ÄúSCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE FALL!!!‚Äù

CORONAVIRUS SCHOOLS BRIEFING: It‚Äôs back to school ‚Äî or is it?
Sign Up
Some states led by Republican governors began to put pressure on districts to meet Mr. Trump‚Äôs demands. The same day as the president‚Äôs tweet, the Florida state education commissioner issued an order requiring all schools to open classrooms five days a week, with limited exceptions, prompting lawsuits from teachers‚Äô associations. The Arkansas state education commissioner soon followed with a similar order.

In Iowa, Ms. Reynolds issued a proclamation on July 17 requiring schools to offer primarily in-person instruction.

At the same time, new daily cases in Des Moines were rising. The district decided it was no longer safe to offer any in-person instruction, and administrators applied to the state for a waiver to offer only virtual classes.

The request was denied because the county‚Äôs test positivity rate was below the state‚Äôs threshold, which also requires that at least 10 percent of a district‚Äôs students must be absent because of illness unless the positivity rate goes above 20 percent.

Iowa City, which is also fighting the governor‚Äôs order in court, has been granted a waiver to teach fully remotely for now because the case positivity rate there is currently 22 percent.

The governor has said that if a district offers only virtual classes without approval, those days will not count toward the required 180 days of instruction that a district must provide each year. She has also said that administrators who defy the state could face discipline from their licensing body, and that districts offering only virtual instruction must suspend sports teams and other extracurricular activities.

Ms. Reynolds declined to comment, but her spokesman, Pat Garrett, said the governor ‚Äúbelieves getting Iowa‚Äôs students and teachers back to school safely is an important part of our state‚Äôs Covid-19 recovery.‚Äù


The Des Moines district, whose school board is nonpartisan but is in a city that leans Democratic, sued the governor in August. On Tuesday, Judge Jeffrey Farrell of Polk County District Court denied the school district a temporary injunction while the case worked its way through the courts, saying state officials had ‚Äúmade a judgment call that the benefits of sending kids back to school outweigh the increased risks of illness and death.‚Äù

School officials in Des Moines are refusing to hold in-person classes, despite an order from Iowa‚Äôs governor and a judge‚Äôs ruling, risking school funding and their jobs because they think it‚Äôs unsafe.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign had one of the most comprehensive plans by a major college to keep the virus under control. But it failed to account for students partying.
College students are using apps to shame their schools into better coronavirus plans.
For some families, the pandemic has meant a return to their native languages.
He added, ‚ÄúWhether right or wrong, that is their decision to make.‚Äù

District officials continued to hold online classes on Wednesday and Thursday despite the judge‚Äôs decision. After a closed-door meeting between the school board and its lawyers on Wednesday and a conversation between the superintendent and the state‚Äôs education commissioner on Thursday, the board met publicly on Thursday evening to discuss options, with no resolution.

‚ÄúNothing‚Äôs really changed in terms of the safety of this virus in our community in the last three days,‚Äù Rob X. Barron, a Des Moines school board member, said.
The death of a longtime special education teacher, who fell ill after an out-of-state trip and died of coronavirus complications last week, before school started, further ratcheted up concerns among the district‚Äôs 5,000 employees. About 1,500 staff members have pre-existing medical conditions, according to a survey the district conducted this summer, and 34 percent are over the age of 50.


Mr. Ahart, the superintendent, said six bus drivers had quit this week over concerns about contracting the virus. And Joshua Brown, president of the local teachers‚Äô union, said several teachers had inquired about how to resign if the district agrees to comply with the governor‚Äôs order.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs scary as hell,‚Äù said Dave O‚ÄôConnor, 58, a middle school social studies teacher who has high blood pressure and other health issues. He added, ‚ÄúI always knew that my government could march me off to war, but I didn‚Äôt know that they could march me into a situation that‚Äôs this unsafe.‚Äù

Many of the district‚Äôs school buildings are aging ‚Äî the average is about 65 years old, officials said ‚Äî with poor ventilation and crowded classrooms. High school classes often have about 40 students, Mr. Ahart said, and even at half capacity, students could not remain six feet apart. ‚ÄúIt cannot be done.‚Äù

Dr. Jha at Brown suggested that the state should work with county health officials to try to lower the coronavirus caseload in the community, making it safer to open schools, rather than ‚Äútrying to essentially push the county to do something that most public health experts would agree is not wise.‚Äù

Parents and students are divided over the district‚Äôs resistance. Erin Willey, 48, whose younger daughter is a junior in high school, said she thought the district was being overly combative, rather than trying to work with the state.

She said she agreed that high schools were crowded, but said she thought the district could find other buildings ‚Äî either vacant ones it already owned, or ones it could rent ‚Äî to spread the students out.
She said she did not see the coronavirus as so different from other diseases that schools deal with regularly. ‚ÄúThe fact of life is that people get sick,‚Äù Ms. Willey said.",,1599871078,{},g4vtlyx,True,t3_ir1mdg,False,False,t3_ir1mdg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ir1mdg/science_versus_politics_school_district_defies/g4vtlyx/,1599878663,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Source: two of my kids play hockey.  There have been tournaments all month.  There‚Äôs not a lot of extensive social distancing out in the parking lots in-between games.  It‚Äôs becoming too lax.

So I so think it's worth celebrating that we have a city around the size of London ON, Surrey BC, or Quebec City QC, our province is centralized and small, and we have such low numbers.

We're doing something right.

We can't celebrate YET though. Only after this is all over. If you look at NS and NFLD's curve, it's has been flattened hardcore.
