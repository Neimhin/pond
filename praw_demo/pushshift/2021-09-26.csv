Chronic lung disease: not covered by current third shot policy, unless they have serious immune deficiencies (or live in nursing homes). Chronic lung disease covers a huge variety of diseases, including many with little or no reduction in the immune system and there's no reason to presume the vaccine is less effective in them than in ""ordinary"" people.

Cancer: third shot already covered in cancer types that result in immune deficiencies, or where the treatments result in immune deficiencies. Unless belonging to one of those groups, there's no reason to presume the vaccine is less effective than in ""ordinary"" people.

Multiple sclerosis: One of the diseases that already is covered by the current policy in cases where considered necessary (which is likely to depend on the exact variant, the progress of the disease and the medication the person receives). Unless belonging to that group, there's no reason to presume the vaccine is less effective than in ""ordinary"" people.

Dysfunctional immune systems: Already covered in cases where serious and/or necessary. Unless belonging to those groups, there's no reason to presume the vaccine is less effective than in ""ordinary"" people.

So, the groups you mentioned either are already covered by the current third-shot policy, or there is no reason to believe that they will have a faster reduction in vaccine protection than other people in the same age group. As they first said a couple of months ago, the Danish authorities are keeping an eye on reduction of protection in all groups through the national registry of positive cases, hospitalizations, deaths, breakthroughs, antibodies in blood donors, and the study initiated in February where thousands of patients (general patients, not just covid patients) in four hospitals are being monitored long-term (antibodies before first shot, before second shot, and at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months, with a recent addition of 8 and 10 months). As they also said on their page for third shot for people with serious immune deficiencies, the authorities are not expecting the vaccine to be less effective in people with only a slight/moderate reduction in their immune system. If they begin to observe a reduction in them compared to their age group, the data will come. Exactly as already happened for people with significantly reduced immune systems and nursing home residents. This is standard in the Danish system and entirely reasonable: You can presume that there has not been a change, *unless* informed by the authorities that there has been a change. In this, your two examples are the exact same: A healthy 35-year-old can expect to still receive reasonable protection from the first two vaccine shots (average similar to others in the same age group), unless informed that there has been a change. A 75-year-old with a slight/moderate reduction in the immune system can expect to still receive reasonable protection from the first two shots (average similar to others in the same age group), unless informed that there has been a change.

Not all deaths are equal...

An 80-year old has may be 2-5 years left ahead of him (and VERY likely not very pleasant years). A 30 year old has most of his life ahead of him, will be leaving behind children,spouse, parents..

At personal level, would YOU prefer to die at 80 or 25? We all know the answer. Or, to adjust it slightly: given a choice between flu-of-1918 at 25 and covid19 at 80 would you think twice what's a better option?

At the social level, would you prefer a pandemic where 100% of under 30 die or a pandemic where 100% of over 80 die?

&gt; Deaths among working-age men contributed the most to declining lifespans in the U.S., according to research led by demographers at the U.K.‚Äôs University of Oxford. Only Denmark and Norway, who have excelled at controlling their outbreaks, avoided drops in life expectancy across both sexes, the study published Sunday in the International Journal of Epidemiology found.

If COVID and all its long-term effects were to totally disappear on December 31, 2021, the measured life expectancy for 2022 would immediately return to 2019 levels.

However, cohort life expectancy (which measures the average age of death for people born in a specific year, say 1950) contains data for every year between the start of the cohort and its end (when the last member of the cohort dies). COVID would adversely affect cohort life expectancy in a permanent way.

One of the pitfalls of ""period life expectancy"" is that it fails to account for future changes in mortality (such as decreased mortality due to advances in healthcare). So even if the period life expectancy in a given year is 75, children born in that year will almost certainly live more than 75 years on average as long as healthcare continues to improve.",,,,1632715621,{},hefnw68,False,t3_pw7emp,False,False,t1_hefgklf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pw7emp/covid_has_wiped_out_years_of_progress_on_life/hefnw68/,,24,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_3za2e,False,False,,False,33b4476444a26deceb16602bad3fbe8d89cce918,True,False,,0.0,1632715838.0,0.0,1632758480.0,False,r/Coronavirus,public,

[],,HalflingMelody,,,,,,,"Our basic dinner is a plank of fish, baby potatoes, and some salad.  It's super easy because we just throw the fish and potatoes on a pizza stone in the oven.  We put olive oil and good balsamic on the salad.  We do various olives and sometimes feta on it, too.

For breakfast we'll often have a *little bit* of rice, some chicken, a bunch of greens, and maybe some soup.  The soup is usually just broth with some combination of squash, zucchini, potato, spinach, and random root veggies.  By a little bit of rice, I mean like 1/2 cup at most.  For the greens: spinach, kale, or chard.  I take an entire bunch per person (the size of a normal bunch you get from the grocery store) and put them in a pot and cook them up with a tiny bit water in the bottom so they don't stick or dry out. I'll put any of a variety of sauces on when they're almost done cooking for flavor.  They've become my favorite part of the meal.

I don't have beans at all because I have fodmap issues.

We drizzle good olive oil on everything.  Dairy is mostly out, except for maybe a little feta on a salad for flavor.  A big thing is that we have carbs, but in moderation.  Have a half cup of pasta on the side, instead of having it as the base of your whole meal.  We wouldn't have a whole bowl of oatmeal.  That's just straight up carbs.  Vegetables make up the bulk of everything.  Meat is mostly fish or chicken and not fried or breaded.

Your entire comment is predicated on the assumption that I'm saying a infection is more effective and reliable than a vaccine. I'm not saying that. I'm saying natural immunity induced by infection is better than vaccine induced immunity. 

The WHO article I linked says that natural immunity can last up to 8 months, and is far more recent than your source which was published in Nov 2020. The UK allows you to have an NHS Covid passport for up to 6 months after a positive PCR.

Even if it were true that vaccines provide longer lasting immunity, by 'longer lasting' they mean antibodies remain circulating in your body for longer. You still have immunity via memory cells regardless.

Obviously natural infection alone can't curb any recurrent waves. We can vaccinate much quicker than the virus can spread. In the UK we've had 7 million cases and 44 million vaccinations. This has absolutely nothing to do with my point. Survivorship bias means nothing either, cause I'm saying *given* you have natural immunity, is it better (conditional).",,,,1632693906,{},heefx52,False,t3_pvh7pj,False,True,t1_heebamy,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pvh7pj/new_zealand_pm_jacinda_ardern_considers_no_jab_no/heefx52/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_16yc3l,False,False,,False,3843ec7677886f717bf40d744ec90485f8ec348c,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1632693924.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

That's not what I'm trying to say - I'm saying that observational studies of asymptomatic/mild infections are unreliable, because people have different reasons to get tested (mostly, I'd assume someone who doesn't want a vaccine doesn't care about covid much and won't get tested if they have mild symptoms). For hospitalizations, behavioral patterns are less important - most people will go get treatment if they can't breathe. So, to get a good idea of vaccines, boosters and asymptomatic/mild infection, we would need an experimental study where participants get systematically tested, not when they want to.

It allows it to infect enormous numbers of people silently without the carriers taking precautions because they're often unaware. This person may or may not be in the symptomatic group and he may or may not need hospital care if he is in the 20%. That it made the news makes it more likely he is symptomatic, but it's far from a guarantee that he'll need hospitalization.

EDIT: The 80% rate was something I read long ago and did not keep up with as information improved. There are studies all over the map on the asymptomatic rate.

I've implied no such thing. If you have inferred that it's just your own bias.  

I've never said there is no cultural difference between Blacks and Whites in the US, that Blacks have been totally assimilated. I teach US history and social studies, so it's literally my job to know that.  I've just spent the evening preparing lessons on the black social movement of the last decade (I think actually naming the movement gets comments banned as political here, but you know the one I mean).  

I'm arguing there are degrees of cultural difference and recent immigrants present greater differences compared to older minority communities.  The original argument was that NZ is a homogenous society compared to the US, when it clearly is not.  I walk into a class of 30 students and there are at least 15 nationalities in the class with several more the children of immigrants.

[],,reader3488,,,,,,[],"Health care now is rigidly rule-based in most places, and those rules are for the institution, not the patient, as with every corporate entity. Hospital environments are patently unconcerned with patient stress and well-being. In most hospitals, even the good ones, no patient sleeps, and every patient starves; the food is inedible. Patients enter in pain, ignorance, and often helpless terror; rounding doctors show up once a day for ten minutes, and thereafter cannot be reached to discuss the orders that have been written, for which no rationale has been explained to the patient. The only option a patient has is to refuse them, at which point the patient becomes ""difficult"" or ""AMA,"" and the ward turns against them.

Under those circumstances, medical errors, waste, and needless pain and suffering are rife. Patients are now aware of this wasteland, so they question everything that is done. The whole process became adversarial. Doctors are no longer allowed their traditional professional freedoms: they are factory drones, completely at the mercy of their billing and scheduling and risk management departments. Nobody can surrender to the least humane impulse if it deviates from the rules an iota.

And that is what one would expect from a profit-based system. Tried calling Quest or Comcast lately? It's the exact same model in both cases: obscurantism, opacity, barriers to communication, leading to extra profits at the expense of those without the strength to spend their last bit of life fighting for themselves. Why do we need to listen to the message ""if this is a medical emergency dial 911; this is a fax line; here's our website address; etc etc etc"" for every single phone call to our doctor's office? With no way to skip it?

The whole enterprise is completely corrupted because it no longer has a basis in ethics or the common good. Whether it ever did, who knows; but everyone now knows it doesn't. Outside of a very few institutions, health care is a shark tank. The only real protection is to be a physician or, next best, to have a physician in the family.

Sorry to be so negative, but after being on the inside and the outside, that's how I see it now. And I can say that it's completely different in countries with civic-minded, publicly managed health care systems, where physician salaries are capped and no health-care institution is permitted a profit motive.",,,,1632756224,{},hehbxyw,False,t3_pwepso,False,False,t1_heh6s8d,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pwepso/nurses_are_in_short_supply_employers_worry/hehbxyw/,1632889638.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_drv5whb0,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But the controversy I can see arising from this is vaccine mandates in schools for healthy kids. I think people will want to see more real world data that the benefits outweigh the risk of covid in healthy children. Seems like the myocarditis risk only really applies to a very specific group(teenaged boys), and it's very clear that even in them, the risk of covid outweighs the risk of any vaccine side effects. 

That said, we have some really clear precedent for mandating vaccines in schools and for children, so I would be surprised not to see covid on that list with all the others at some point in the future - the question is when. 

That's my take on it. I'm sure some antivax people are going to scream bloody murder about this either way though.

If there's an argument for masks in public, it's more about other diseases like flu.

Meanwhile, people who are vulnerable can wear medical grade masks (N95) if they want to.  (Medical grade masks do protect the wearer.). 

So, right now, I'm thinking that we (less vulnerable) don't need to wear masks, even for old people.  There may be exceptions.

[],,GreunLight,,,,,,,"From the article:

&gt; **The coronavirus pandemic has become the deadliest disease outbreak in recent American history with tolls surpassing the estimated deaths of the 1918 flu. According to data from Johns Hopkins University, 681,253 individuals in the United States have died from Covid-19 infections, while over a century ago, the country lost an estimated 675,000 people during the 1918 influenza pandemic, reports Holly Yan for CNN.**

&gt; Many health experts suspect that the Covid-19 pandemic‚Äôs high death tolls are a result of America‚Äôs insufficient response to control the pandemic early on‚Äîdespite modern day scientific and medical advances‚Äîand consider the phenomenon a tragedy, reports Carla K. Johnson for the Associated Press. Currently, an average of 1,900 deaths are reported per day in the U.S. Experts suspect the recent surge is due in part to the persistence of the deadlier Delta variant, reports CNBC‚Äôs Berkeley Lovelace Jr.

&gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs generally known around the world that America didn‚Äôt do a very good job in the early stages of controlling the pandemic,‚Äù says David Morens, a medical historian at the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, to Helen Branswell for STAT News.

&gt; The 1918 flu, also known as the Spanish flu, spread worldwide during 1918 and 1919. In the U.S., it was first identified in military personnel in the spring of 1918 and mostly affected children less than five years old, adults between 20 to 40 years old, and seniors 65 years of age or older. Mortality rate was high in healthy people between 20 and 40 years old, making this a unique and devastating feature of the influenza virus, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

&gt; **When looking at two separate pandemics that occurred in different time periods, understanding the context of all technological, medical, cultural, and social advances that occurred over the past century is important, reports CNBC.**

&gt; American population numbers were vastly different. In 1918, the population was less than a third of today's at 103 million people living in U.S. right before the 1920s. Now, there are 303 million people living in the country. **So, while the 1918 flu killed one in every 150 Americans, Covid-19 has killed one in 500 people so far, per CNBC**. Globally, Covid-19 has taken the lives of 4.7 million people, whereas the 1918 pandemic killed an estimated 20 million to 50 million people. **When looking at the national population-level data during the two events, the 1918 influenza still tops Covid-19, per Stat News.**

&gt; Medicine was also not as advanced during 1918, and a vaccine against influenza was not available, according to CNN. To control infections a century ago, non-pharmaceutical interventions‚Äîlike isolation, quarantine, use of disinfectants, cloth masks and limits of public gatherings‚Äîwere enforced, according to the CDC.   

&gt; However, Covid-19 cases are still rising despite the availability of vaccines, and other modern medicine practices. Currently, millions of Americans have still not been vaccinated, per CNN.

&gt; ‚ÄúRemember, we‚Äôre still counting,‚Äù Morens tells STAT News. ‚ÄúIn 1918, the pandemic became not so deadly within two years. We have no idea ‚Äî I don‚Äôt, and I don‚Äôt trust anybody who says they do ‚Äî where this Covid-19 will go.‚Äù

&gt; Epidemiologist Stephen Kissler from the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health suggests that another reason for high rates of Covid-19 infection is from the misinformation that spread through the internet, per CNN.

&gt; **‚ÄúThe truth is we have no historical precedent for the moment we‚Äôre in now**,‚Äù writes Howard Markel, the director of the Center for History of Medicine at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, last month in the Atlantic. ‚Äú**We need to stop thinking back to 1918 as a guide for how to act in the present and to start thinking forward from 2021 as a guide to how to act in the future.**‚Äù",,,,1632704063,{},hef17e5,True,t3_pw5m2m,False,True,t3_pw5m2m,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pw5m2m/covid19_surpasses_1918_flu_to_become_deadliest/hef17e5/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_bz91eiwq,False,True,,False,87387b9ae8c42f8178752ce6673ae5c411cedcb4,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1632704079.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

[],,LiveTheLifeIShould,,,,,,[],"I've noticed that people who had to physically work during the pandemic are also the groups of people that have the lowest vaccination rates. Police, Fire, nurses, health care workers, nursing home workers, service workers, etc. They all have a lower vaccination rate.


There is something to be said about that. They have been heavily exposed for well over a year before the vaccine came out. When you are constantly exposed to something, you eventually become used to the risk and the risk no longer becomes a perceived risk but every day reality. It is a mental block and they can make all the justifications they want about it but I think at the end of the day, it's a perceived lack of risk due to constant exposure.


As for the people that have been locked in their homes for over a year, the perceived risk is huge and it's justified. They haven't seen people in over a year and they feel if they go to the outside world unvaccinated, they will get sick. They see the vaccine as a way to re-enter the world. As apposed to the front line workers, they have been in the outside world since day 1 without the vaccine. The vaccine doesn't change their every day life. It protects them from the virus but it doesn't change their day to day.


With all this said, I'm trying to dig into the psych of people. I think everyone should be vaccinated. The past year has been rough on people's mental well-being.


I also think there is a lot of resentment from front line workers. They physically went to work while people who could work from home, worked from home and people that didn't work got unemployment and stimulus money.

[],,ammoprofit,,,,,,[],"Several pieces all at once:

First, there are mutations.  Mutations happen *constantly* in viruses.  Mutations that make it more fatal also means less opportunity to spread because it kills the host quicker.  This usually *decreases* the fatality rate in the long run.

More contagious, however, means more people can be infected, and that usually overwhelms medical facilities.  The technical term is, ""triage,"" or deciding which people get resources and which people don't.  In pandemics and epidemics, triage kills the most people, and it's not just the infected.  It's the people who have heart attacks, strokes, asthma, and everything else that is usually treatable when you have available staff and resources.

Second, there is selective pressure.  The public usually hears selective pressure in the same breath as Survival of the Fittest, Evolution, and/or Darwin.  Modern examples are antibiotic-resistant superbugs, like [Tuberculosis](https://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/drtb/default.htm).

Selective Pressure means the bugs that survive the antibiotics and the likes get to keep living and reproduce.  If your body doesn't finish killing those off, your infection can spread to others.  COVID isn't a bacteria, but the same process applies, and it applies from all pressures.  Those pressures include everything from how well it survives outside the body in hot/cold, dry/humid, etc environments.  It includes which hosts it thrives in and which hosts it starves in.

Which brings us to our third point - the hosts.  The early waves of Pandemics and Epidemics don't always hit the hardest.  In fact, early waves are usually pretty weak but exploit their novel-ness.  They wind up killing the most susceptible hosts first.  If the initial waves are not contained, the subsequent waves are able to survive in healthier hosts through selective pressures, and those infectious vectors are typically more robust and harder to kill.

So you now have a, ""well-trained,"" virus spreading through a supply of healthy hosts where the vast majority of people remaining all fit into that category of, ""healthy hosts.""

And it's still at pandemic/epidemic strength because we half-stepped this every step of the way.


And the data you're seeing is akin to a percentage.  If you want to increase a percentage, you can decrease the bottom number and/or increase the top number.  We decreased the bottom number (total available hosts) when the weak, immuno-compromised, and unhealthy (""pre-existing conditions"") died.  And we're increasing the top (number of infections) because selective pressure and half-stepped measures have allowed this to continue to spread to the healthy hosts (who, oddly enough, go figure, *are* in fact susceptible).

So the real question is, ""How badly did we screw up every single step of managing COVID, including our expectations and media portrayal, that this is a surprising result?""",,,,1632708193,{},hefa3p7,False,t3_pvzgxw,False,True,t1_hedoyms,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pvzgxw/a_25yearold_who_had_to_get_a_double_lung/hefa3p7/,1632847787.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_cc189,False,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Why does it have to be collapse? 

Why is the alternative to ""Normal has changed"", ""Collapsed""? 

It is a fact, norms have changed, there is ""going back to normal"", there is ""returning to old habits, and dealing with the consequences"". 

People are going to keep dying to this, until it is ""Normal"" for someone to go to the movies and die 2 weeks later because of it. 

That's a fact of life that we aren't changing, and at best we can hope to reduce the incidence as much as possible, but our new norm is that people are risking their lives just a wee bit more when socializing, we'll have to wait to see the real effects of that down the road.

Immunity after a third shot appears to be at least as good as the original claims for the second shot (i.e. ~95%). Exactly how much you should worry about infection depends on more detail about your situation and medical history. Talk to your doctor.

&gt; Also, how long does it take until the booster takes effect? Two weeks?

I can't find any third-shot-specific answer to this question but [this page](https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/blog/how-long-for-covid-vaccine-to-work) says the two weeks is a rule-of-thumb that applies to any vaccine:

&gt; Regardless of which vaccine you get, you won‚Äôt reach full protection until two weeks after your second or final dose. That‚Äôs about how long it takes your immune system to mount an antibody response to the vaccine.
&gt;
&gt; All vaccines work this way. Think of it in terms of when you have a cold‚Äîit takes your body a good amount of time to rid itself of what‚Äôs making you sick. A vaccine is essentially faking out your immune system and triggering a similar response.

There are largely unsolvable political reasons that additional mandates and proof-of-vaccination restrictions aren't being done.  So, I'm not sure specifically what you are proposing to do in the U.S. to vaccinate more adults.  I'd love to hear it.  

In addition, I would be shocked if even half of 5-11 year olds get vaccinated anytime soon after approval.

With 2 doses each, we're talking about 10 million adult doses, or enough to vaccinate 5 million adults.

I don‚Äôt see sensationalism here. Journalists reporting what physicians and scientists are experiencing in real time isn‚Äôt ‚Äúpremature,‚Äù either, imho. It‚Äôs a snapshot. 

e: 

From the article:

&gt; Health experts in southern states are reporting an uptick in stillbirths among women infected with COVID-19.

&gt; ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing the numbers more out of Mississippi and Alabama. In Florida it‚Äôs hard to get hard numbers on these types of occurrences,‚Äù said Dr. Tiffany Wells, OBGYN from Baptist Health.

&gt; Nationwide, stillbirth deaths in pregnant women appear low.

&gt; The CDC reported 266 pregnancies have been lost since the start of the pandemic.

&gt; Wells said more data is needed.

&gt; ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt established true causation. Although when they reported on it out in Mississippi, they were relating the two things, the increase in the stillbirth rate and the increase in pregnant patients with COVID-19,‚Äù Wells said.

&gt; Mississippi has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country. Their state department of health reported 72 stillbirths among women with COVID-19 since the pandemic, more than doubling the expected average.

‚Ä¶

&gt; ‚ÄúThe vaccine itself is going to help, number one, prevent a pregnant patient from getting infected. You don‚Äôt get the drop in blood pressure, and oxygenation and the inflammation that seems to be occurring in pregnant patients and could be causing this rate in stillbirths to increase,‚Äù she said.

&gt; As more research develops, health experts have confirmed it is not unusual for viruses to affect pregnancies.

&gt; The CDC, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine all recommend pregnant women get the COVID-19 vaccine.

There‚Äôs no evolutionary pressure for this virus to get anything other than more transmissible, there are strict limits on the ways that it can do that, and we can always update the vaccines.

I think my least favorite thing is when they tell me ‚Äúwhat you have to understand is they‚Äôre really sick‚Äù.

Pending time, I'd tell them something like ""Oh they're really sick/have kids/etc? Well sure, I can put them to the head of the list, because all of the other people on the list ahead of them are just a little bit sick/have no kids/etc - WAIT OF COURSE NOT YOU IDIOT""

I mean, nurses/RT/doctors/etc are like gold right now, it's not like they can really afford to fire you..

Or just maybe something like ""What's their COVID-19 vaccination status? We can only accept people with proof of vaccinations.""

However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data.

Almost as many experienced ‚Äúcognitive impairment consistent with dementia,‚Äù and 12% screened positive for depression.
‚Ä¶

&gt;	Delirium, defined as a significant disruption of a person‚Äôs memory and ability to think, can include hallucinations, personality changes, agitation and even aggression. And it‚Äôs remarkably common among hospitalized COVID patients: researchers found 73% of those in the ICU experienced it, a frequency backed by other studies as well.
‚Ä¶

&gt;	At this point in the pandemic, with 56% of the US population and 52% of Michiganders vaccinated, people need to understand the real risk, Vlisides said. And studies like this show that just focusing on your chance of surviving COVID, doesn‚Äôt provide the full picture.

&gt;	‚ÄúIf you get COVID and...even if you don‚Äôt end up in the ICU, there is that risk of long term complications, where there‚Äôs a real risk of not getting back to your regular baseline day-to-day lifestyle before having COVID,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe hear so often in the news about mortality rates...but even if you get COVID and you‚Äôre lucky enough to survive...it‚Äôs not just this binary distinction of whether you may or may not die... There is still a very real risk to both mental health and physical health for weeks and months or longer to come.‚Äù

Best example is the early masking guidance from the WHO and national equivalents (CDC, Health Canada, etc) which basically amounted to: don't mask, it's not effective. That was based largely on the established size threshold between aerosol and droplet transmission (5 microns), set almost 60 years ago. But that threshold was [an accidental misinterpretation of a tuberculosis transmission study](https://www.wired.com/story/the-teeny-tiny-scientific-screwup-that-helped-covid-kill), and we're now understanding the actual threshold may be closer to 20x larger (100 microns), as proposed in an even earlier study.

There's also the idea officials may have lied to save masks for healthcare workers in the early days, but given the info in the link above, I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt here and say they honestly thought that, based on scientific consensus at the time, the larger COVID19 virus ""had to be"" droplet-based transmission, so if you kept 1-2m apart (an option NOT possible for healthcare workers) and sanitized hands and surfaces regularly, you were ok.

Anyway, evidence quickly showed that COVID clearly transmitted farther than existing knowledge would have it go, so science-backed guidance pivoted 180¬∞ to yes, mask the hell up goddammit!

&gt; If vaccination committees determine that they should be vaccinated, I would of course support it and hope everyone does it. But it is obvious that the answer isn't as clear-cut as it is with adults. Children aren't vaccinated against many viruses, including the flu at least here.

Yes it will be important to prove the benefit outweighs the risks. The data shows that the benefit outweighs the risks even down to age 12, so far. Since the 5-11 trial health data showed no significant side effects including no cases of myocarditis, I think it's pretty certain that the FDA/CDC, and whatever equivalent in your country, would give the green light to this.

Vaccines have never been intended to stop infection entirely. Vaccines don‚Äôt do that.

*Clinical* efficacy. The criteria of the EUA was to prevent disease, not infection.  It‚Äôs actually in the title of the EUA. 

&gt; Umm no, there are plenty of studies indicating this isn't true with delta.

No, there aren‚Äôt. Studies that show this always end up under heavy criticism for opaque or poor methodologies and as far as I know there‚Äôs only one study that directly looks at vaccinated shedding.  It showed it was reduced from vaccinated people. 

&gt; Bottom line is a ton of this is age and underlying conditions dependent. 

That‚Äôs not what we‚Äôre discussing though. 

&gt; All large scale studies, to date, show waning immunity and community spread amongst highly vaccinated populations over time, in the face of delta.

No they don‚Äôt. They show that spread slows within the vaccinated portions of those communities. 

&gt; No one has proven that any of the vaccines are a two dose regimen and basing public policy off assumptions that are already looking false is ridiculously unhelpful.

Related to #1, we are a few generations removed from seeing the actual devastation of many vaccine-prevented diseases (yes, we have COVID deaths, but the general perception is that they are mostly in the elderly. As much as they might be in a healthcare profession, elderly deaths aren‚Äôt as important. Nursing is dominated by younger women and mothers, so the situation would be entirely different if kids were dying and their own children were at risk).

3. Political persuasion. They‚Äôve been convinced by a particular side of the political spectrum that the vaccine a) doesn‚Äôt work or b) is dangerous. And they think, incorrectly, that there is more risk to them from the vaccine than from getting COVID.

4. Related to #3, a lack of understanding of safety, efficacy, and relative risk. Nurses have to take science classes, but they don‚Äôt necessarily understand science, as a method of study, nor does it mean that they are trained to think scientifically (tons of them love and sincerely believe shit like astrology).

5. They don‚Äôt like being told what to do (I‚Äôm not kidding). I work in infection prevention, and I‚Äôve had a few tell me that they take the virus seriously and that they think the vaccine works, but they just don‚Äôt like that they are being told they have to get it. But it makes no sense because they chose not to get it when it was voluntary, so the fact that it‚Äôs starting to be mandated really shouldn‚Äôt make any difference. 

6. Religious belief (they claim it, but it‚Äôs bullshit). There are very few religious sects actually against vaccination, and the major religion leaders are saying vaccination is acceptable since it helps to save lives. They might talk about vaccines having aborted fetal cells in them (they don‚Äôt, but some vaccines are made in immortalized cell lines originally derived from fetal tissue in the 1960s-‚Äò80s, which, to them, is just as bad). However, this would only be true of the J+J vaccine and not the mRNA vaccines, which are made through purely chemical processes. Pointing this out makes little difference. As for the religious exemption, they will cite arbitrary biblical verses to justify a choice they have already made (I‚Äôve seen the same 1.5 page passage cited, word for word, from at least 4 individuals, so some anti-vaccine website out there has a convenient copy-paste available as an non-ironic excuse to not take care of others). I‚Äôm not religious, although I grew  up in the church, and I know a lot of good religious people out there who live by their beliefs. But these people are using their religion as a shield for their own selfishness, which, as far as I‚Äôm concerned, makes their claim to their faith worthless. 

I‚Äôm sure there are more, but this is what I have seen most in dealing specifically with tracking infections and vaccination rates, and in providing education on COVID, the pandemic, and vaccines.",,,,1632765496,{},hehwq2f,False,t3_pw6kpp,False,True,t1_hefdwif,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pw6kpp/these_health_care_workers_would_rather_get_fired/hehwq2f/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_67mu0rvj,False,False,,False,90f7e9fe85cba1bdf20070b66200914983bb76c0,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1632765514.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

[],,Udub,,,,,,[],"1. It depends what you mean by effective. The risk of severe COVID and/or hospitalization is very low in children to begin with. A University of Minnesota article about the study is my source. One dose is 30.7 effective at preventing symptomatic infection (of Delta) in adults. No reason for it to be significantly different in children. Also see my link under 3 below regarding ‚Äòefficacy‚Äô of first dose. 

2. The longer you wait between doses, the better. Being that there‚Äôs so little risk to children in general with COVID (relative to at-risk adults) there‚Äôs no benefit in waiting *less* time. You have to wait between doses for a reason. In other words, by not waiting the appropriate time you risk the second dose doing nothing. You want LONG LASTING protection. You get this by waiting between first and second doses. Immediate protection doesnt matter as much in the context of children. 

3. 14 days post second dose is considered fully vaccinated but look at this chart for vanilla Covid. https://i.insider.com/5fcfaac2240ebd00126bdacf?width=1000&amp;format=jpeg&amp;auto=webp

If an artist doesn't feel comfortable with something, it doesn't benefit the show.

Sound engineer Casjan Berends about artists who refuse performances with corona passes
Sound engineer Casjan Berends also lost most of his income due to the closed theaters. ""I was at 30 percent of what I normally earn and I had to spend on pots that I had built up for the future. It was very tough, but I know that many colleagues had it much harder.""

He has had plenty of assignments for a few weeks now. ""It's a madhouse"". But now he has also lost a job because of an artist who refuses to perform with corona passes.

Understanding
Berends himself does not have that much trouble with the corona passes, but he does understand the decision of the singers and comedians. ""If an artist doesn't feel comfortable with something, it doesn't benefit the show. As a sound engineer, my job is to make the connection between the artist and the audience. If performing for an artist doesn't feel right, I can try as hard as I can, then it will be nothing.""

According to the sound engineer, it is part of the job to depend on the whim of an artist. ""It's the same as an artist without inspiration. In a normal job you can still say: you just bite through it. But for artists something like that really gets in the way.""

Yet Berends says he does not want to downplay the consequences. ""If such a canceled performance means the difference for a technician between being able to pay the mortgage or not, then there is a lot of suffering involved.""

Kunstenbond: pay technicians anyway
The Kunstenbond is concerned that more and more performances are being canceled because of the corona passes and calls on Douwe Bob and the other artists: ""If you really want to make a statement, you delete the performances, but you just pay the support you already have. had enabled.""

Sound engineer Casjan Berends calls the union's call sympathetic, but not very realistic. ""The margins in the sector are far too small for that. With the exception of a few large subsidized companies, nobody can afford that.""

He does hope that the rates for technicians will go up. ""Then it would be better for them to create a buffer for the next crisis and also take out decent insurance against incapacity for work. Now our income is a joke compared to the rate of the average plumber or handyman.""",,,,1632772092,{},heib7ky,True,t3_pwox7m,False,True,t3_pwox7m,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pwox7m/technicians_and_musicians_also_hit_by_boycott/heib7ky/,1632907868.0,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_l1izy,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The U.S. is [the world's largest donor of COVID vaccines](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/09/covid-us-is-the-worlds-largest-donor-of-vaccines-data-shows.html).  Clearly, we are doing our part and increasingly ramping up to do more to help other nations around the world that can't get the vaccines for themselves.

On the other hand, within the U.S. there is a significant number of adults that refuse vaccines, as well as politicians that are hostile not just to vaccines but to any sort of mitigation effects of COVID-19.  A lot of parents in the U.S. see these people as a threat to the health of their children and frankly just short of seeing them as enemies as you would someone trying to harm your children through any means.  These people are also standing in the way of anything close to herd immunity, so there's no way to protect your children by having all the adults get vaccinated.

It's completely logical to want vaccination to prevent your kids from getting COVID given the high instances of long COVID and potential for chronic health problems that are being reported.  Additionally there's not much in the way of reporting of the suffering going on globally, just that the U.S. news reports on the people getting sick locally and all the problems that brings.  Many Americans believe the world outside of the U.S. is in chaos at most times anyway.  So from a weighing of morals standpoint, other countries don't even really factor into it for the majority of Americans.  I'm not saying that's good, but it does explain things.

Personally, I'm in the group that just wants their kids to be vaccinated and don't really care what happens with the willfully unvaccinated in developed nations at this point.  I want to see the richer countries continue to expand their donations of vaccines but also to expand vaccine programs within their own borders as well.  The logistics of distributing vaccines globally aren't as simple as you seem to believe so the choice isn't between the U.S. donating more to Africa or give the vaccines to kids -- it's between throwing the vaccines away unused by the thousands upon thousands versus giving them to children.  Every individual vaccinated is a win, and while we should continue improving the fight against the pandemic globally, there's nothing wrong with starting locally.",,,,1632774897,{},heihfue,False,t3_pwg24r,False,False,t1_hehh8y8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/pwg24r/in_a_matter_of_days_pfizer_ceo_says_theyll_be/heihfue/,1632911006.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_foh8k,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If 20 in 1 million people vaccinated with 50ug end up hospitalized vs 16 in 1 million from the 100ug dose (hypothetical numbers, but a reasonable guess for people 19-29 assuming a third dose of moderna with 50ug is just slightly more effective than pfizer), then just 4 in 1 million hospitalizations from the vaccine itself actually matters. For young males using a data mix of pfizer+modera, the risk of hospitalization from the vaccine was more than 20 in 1 million, so have a difference in risk of hospitalization be more than 4 in 1 million is for that age group is pretty likely. Especially given those who got the 250ug dose in the trials did have much higher rates of severe outcomes and was not used because of that. 

OTOH, those 65+ have less than a 1 in a million chance of myocarditis, but have much more to gain in benefits from the vaccine (even with 3 doses, the risk is probably still several hundred per million).
