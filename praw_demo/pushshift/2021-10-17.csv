&gt; There is no data to suggest people are at increased risk of a rare, but serious, blood clot condition after receiving a second dose of J&amp;J's vaccine, executives told the committee.

But I'm not quite sure how I feel about it, since the same article says:

&gt; Participants in a J&amp;J trial for Covid boosters administered six months after the primary dose experienced no new adverse side effects, FDA medical officer Dr. Timothy Brennan told the agency's advisory committee. **Though the trial's sample size of 17 participants ages 18 to 55 prevented Brennan from drawing any conclusions on the data**

Only 17 people in the at risk age group and it's not clear how many were women...

But still there's this:

&gt;  Dr. Macaya Douoguih, head of clinical development and medical affairs for J&amp;J's vaccines division Janssen, presented data from the U.K. on second doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine, which uses a similar platform to J&amp;J's. The data shows the rate of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, or VITT, after a second dose was less frequent than the first. ""Although the vectors are not entirely the same, the data may provide some insight into potential risk,"" Douoguih said.

To grow them, they have to be grown in cell cultures where the host cells contain code for and produce the missing pieces.   

And this means that occasionally a recombination event can occur between the virus genes and the genes in the host cells where the virus will regains the missing piece (and usually loses the vaccine payload because there isn't room for both).

This is tested for during manufacturing and you have to toss batches when it happens.    There was a dispute between Brazil and Russia where it was alleged that a replication-competent batch of Sputnik V had escaped the factory:

I would be considered perfectly normal in USA with my BMI, but in Korea, I would at least be considered chubby.",,,,,,,,,1634521982,,,{},hh255j8,False,t3_q9xkk3,False,False,t1_hh0f0y0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q9xkk3/90000_us_covid19_deaths_since_june_were/hh255j8/,,3,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],,[],1634653220.0,

If we lived in Texas? We would move. 

However? If we lived in Texas right now? 

We could not afford to move. 

Unless we sold every single thing that we owned in order to make enough money to move out of the state and move as quickly as possible to a state that would offer things that our family needs. I would make a list of things that were important to our family an concentrate on those areas. For instance? 


We knew we needed to live in a state that was growing and ethically / morally matched out needs.

At the time we moved, Covid-19 did not exist, and we needed access to (alphabetically order):

‚Ä¢ affordable housing

‚Ä¢ food (farms in area)


‚Ä¢ health care


‚Ä¢ jobs

‚Ä¢ medical insurance (states where their governor's allowed the Medicaid expansion)


‚Ä¢ no state income taxes (our income was substantially increased per month).

‚Ä¢ out door things to do (hiking, camping, fishing, exploring)

‚Ä¢ people

‚Ä¢ public transportation

‚Ä¢ seasonal changes

‚Ä¢ schools

‚Ä¢ things for the elderly (our parents)


So what we did? We threw a dart at a map.

Not all of the attributes that we were looking for could be found in our new home state. However? The important ones were.


We loaded our car with our cat and dog and everything that would fit in it. We put the rest in storage. We moved.


 We were lucky the dart landed where it did.


If you do decide to move? Make a list of everything that is important to you and then go to the web page of that City / State and see what they have to offer you. Try to narrow it down to less than 10 so that you aren't searching every single one. Unless of course? You have the time to search for more than 10.

Then make a list of what you need to do in order to make the move feasible for you and your loved ones. 


You could apply for jobs in those areas that are on your approved list of places where you want to move to. 


Or? 


You can move to the state or city you want to move to without jobs and basically start over. Which is what my husband and I decided to do.


Even if it takes a while? 

You will be so happy that you moved from an area that causes you so much frustration, to an area where you see the all of the possibilities and light at the end of your tunnel.

I'm not familiar with the US statistics but that argumentation wouldn't have worked here in Sweden and probably many other countries. Yes initially people would have listened but when actual statistics were available some wouldn't consider their risk of dying being high enough to warrant vaccination.

Here is the Swedish Covid death statistic for example:

[https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/statistik-och-data/statistik/statistik-om-covid-19/statistik-over-antal-avlidna-i-covid-19/](https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/statistik-och-data/statistik/statistik-om-covid-19/statistik-over-antal-avlidna-i-covid-19/)  (official government website)

Total deaths 14321 and 78% of dead people had been hospitalized sometime in the previous 5 years.

Deaths according to age brackets:

0-9 years old: 5 deaths, 10-19: 4 deaths, 20-29: 16 deaths, 30-39: 37 deaths, 40-49: 103 deaths, 50-59: 417 deaths, 60-69: 1056 deaths, 70-79: 3227 deaths, 80-89: 5778 deaths, 90+: 3678 deaths.

Many many people who are not in the elderly age brackets would look at these statistics and not be convinced that ""if you don't want to die get vaccinated"" being enough of a reason on its own. Other reasons would for sure have to be given.

But like I wrote perhaps it's different in the US. I am not familiar with how the numbers have turned out there. I assume Covid has hit much harder among the young/middle aged because the population overall is less metabolically healthy, obesity and such.",,,,,,,,,1634539547,,,{},hh2xqm9,False,t3_qa0jib,False,False,t1_hh2fb46,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qa0jib/fauci_says_unvaccinated_create_danger_of_fifth/hh2xqm9/,,8,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],,[],1634669958.0,

[],,,michaelthecoder,,,[],,,,text,t2_llftk,False,False,"So this is relying on a study has only been out for a few days and used with a small number of people, so be aware there are significant limitations on what I am about to say as it is dealing with the forefront of scientific research. The study found that people who took J&amp;J have about 10x fewer antibodies than people who took an mRNA vaccine, and people who boosted with J&amp;J ended up with about 10x fewer antibodies than people who boosted with an mRNA vaccine. Out of the 9 combinations they tested, double J&amp;J was the only one that ended up below the antibody threshold that they had desired.

So what do antibody levels mean? Here's where it gets confusing and what most people don't understand. You have two main defense systems, your antibodies and your B and T cells. Think of B and T cells as your slow, heavy weaponry. As such, they take too long to activate to do much against infection and spread, so antibodies are much more important in regards to those. On the other hand, B and T cells help more with hospitalization and death, though antibodies can still play a role in preventing these.

My personal theory is that J&amp;J is okay with B and T cells but is terrible at antibodies, so it gives very little protection against infection and spread, some protection against hospitalization, and strong protection against death. However, be aware that although higher antibodies means better protection in theory, we do not have strong data on this with COVID, which means anything dealing strictly with antibody numbers is admittedly going to stay theoretical for the foreseeable future.

So here's where the controversy is, even among scientists: how important is high antibody levels if you are protected against hospitalization and death? The FDA and CDC have decided that they are not very important. However, there are many caveats to this that they are straight up ignoring.

First is the concern of long COVID, which some people don't mind taking the risk of and others are petrified of the risk even if they are vaccinated. At this point it is unclear how important antibodies are to preventing long COVID or if B and T cells are enough.

Second is spread. I don't have a medical degree but I do have a math degree and I can say that the FDA and CDC are mistaken when they ignore spread completely. You'll hear many people who think spread isn't important talk about how we aren't getting to 0 COVID. They are probably right that 0 COVID isn't going to happen, but this doesn't matter. Even a tiny decrease of 4% in spread could be enough to reduce cases, hospitalizations, and deaths by a quarter. When you reduce spread, you deal with a butterfly effect of erasing entire transmission chains so that people never end up sick that would have been. This is why you don't hear about Polio and Measles vaccines doing a good job by keeping you out of the hospital - they reduce spread to an insignificant number. Somewhere in the pandemic, all of the PR around vaccines got shifted from the communal herd effect that has protected us from numerous diseases during our lives to purely to a personal effect.

Spread is even more important if you are around unvaccinated people. Those who are worried about an immunocompromised roommate, unvaccinated kids, or even pets that could be at risk from your breakthrough infection infecting them should especially pay attention to antibodies.

One more thing to note: J&amp;J isn't actually a standard type vaccine. People don't want to admit this as it would discourage people from getting vaccinated, but adenovirus vaccines like J&amp;J is pretty much just as new as mRNA vaccines. The pandemic has given us far more info on both of these types of vaccines than we have ever had before. At this point, they have both passed with flying colors despite some risk, though mRNA vaccines consistently appear to be performing better than the adenovirus ones. Fortunately, even though they are new technology, both vaccine types are designed to clean themselves up within a matter of days, and so the vast majority of side effects should be immediate and obvious.",,,,,,,,,1634536489,,,{},hh2tuht,False,t3_qa095e,False,False,t1_hh2qicu,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qa095e/jj_vaccine_very_likely_should_have_been_2_doses/hh2tuht/,,5,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],,[],1634667748.0,

Cases of psychosis have soared over the past two years in England as an increasing number of people experience hallucinations and delusional thinking amid the stresses of the Covid-19 pandemic.

There was a 75% increase in the number of people referred to mental health services for their first suspected episode of psychosis between April 2019 and April 2021, NHS data shows.

The rise continued throughout the summer, with 12,655 referred in July 2021, up 53% from 8,252 in July 2019.

Much of the increase has been seen over the last year, after the first national lockdown, according to data analysed by the charity Rethink Mental Illness. More than 13,000 referrals were made in May 2021, a 70% rise on the May before when there were 7,813 referrals.

The charity is urging the government to invest more in early intervention for psychosis to prevent further deterioration in people‚Äôs mental health from which it could take them years to recover.

It says the statistics provide some of the first concrete evidence to indicate the significant levels of distress experienced across the population during the pandemic.

A study earlier this month found that anxiety and depression around the world increased dramatically in 2020, with an estimated 76m extra cases of anxiety and 53m extra cases of major depressive disorder than would have been expected had Covid not struck. Women and young people were disproportionately affected, the researchers said.

Psychosis can involve seeing or hearing things that other people do not (hallucinations) and developing beliefs that are not based on reality (delusions), which can be highly distressing. It can be a symptom of mental illness such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or severe depression, but psychosis can also be a one-off, potentially triggered by a traumatic experience, extreme stress or drug and alcohol misuse.

Despite the continued pressure on mental health services, Rethink Mental Illness is highlighting the importance of rapid access to treatment to prevent further episodes of psychosis and reduce people‚Äôs risk of developing severe mental illness.

Nice guidelines for people experiencing a suspected first episode of psychosis state they should receive an assessment within two weeks. However, the charity fears that if the increase in referrals is sustained, more people will have to wait longer for vital treatment.

Brian Dow, the deputy chief executive of Rethink Mental Illness, said: ‚ÄúPsychosis can have a devastating impact on people‚Äôs lives. Swift access to treatment is vital to prevent further deterioration in people‚Äôs mental health which could take them years to recover from.

‚ÄúThese soaring numbers of suspected first episodes of psychosis are cause for alarm. We are now well beyond the first profound shocks of this crisis, and it‚Äôs deeply concerning that the number of referrals remains so high. As first presentations of psychosis typically occur in young adults, this steep rise raises additional concerns about the pressures the younger generation have faced during the pandemic.

‚ÄúThe pandemic has had a gamechanging effect on our mental health and it requires a revolutionary response. Dedicated additional funding for mental health and social care must go to frontline services to help meet the new demand, otherwise thousands of people could bear a catastrophic cost.‚Äù

A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: ‚ÄúIt is vital everyone can get the right support when they need it and we are delivering the fastest expansion in mental health services in NHS history, backed by an additional ¬£2.3bn a year by 2023/24, benefiting hundreds of thousands more people.

‚ÄúOn top of this, we‚Äôve invested an additional ¬£500m this year to help people whose mental health has been particularly impacted by the pandemic. All NHS mental health providers have established 24/7 urgent helplines, which have answered around three million calls during the pandemic.‚Äù

‚ÄòMy head told me to deal with hearing voices‚Äô
Tom Dunning, 30, has a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, social anxiety disorder and PTSD.

‚ÄúI was about 22 or 23 when I first started experiencing symptoms of psychosis. It was pretty much overnight having after finishing my degree that my head told me to deal with hearing voices. Hearing them was a daily occurrence and it pretty much made me feel scared of myself because I didn‚Äôt think anything was wrong so I couldn‚Äôt tell anyone how I felt.

‚ÄúI had experienced bullying in my childhood and now I felt like my own mental health was bullying me by the voices telling me to do things. Everyone around me started to notice differences and knew something was wrong but I was scared to acknowledge that. I eventually saw my GP and it was the first time that I thought I needed support but it was also the first time that I knew it was something I could get through.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,1634549483,,,{},hh38rfx,True,t3_qaj1as,False,False,t1_hh38jw3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qaj1as/coronavirus_live_auckland_lockdown_extended/hh38rfx/,,5,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],,[],1634676385.0,

The decision from prime minister Jacinda Ardern comes as experts remain concerned that an early move out of lockdown could be disastrous, and risk overwhelming the health system.

Auckland is closing in on 90% of its population having had one shot; 89% of the region‚Äôs population has now had at least one dose, and 70% are fully vaccinated.

Across the country, 82% of the eligible population (those aged 12 and over) have had at least one vaccination, or 70% of the total population; 64% of the eligible population, or 55% of the full population are fully inoculated with both shots.

Ardern has not yet announced a specific point in vaccination levels where restrictions will be loosened, but has previously ruled out dropping public health measures before the country reaches 90%. She said on Monday afternoon that restrictions would be needed for a while longer to avoid a spike in cases.

‚ÄúIf we get this right, if we keep case numbers low while we vaccinate people then it makes it easier for us to keep control of Covid, while we ease restrictions in the future, and that is everyone‚Äôs goal,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe question for cabinet today has been how do we avoid a spike in case numbers, and hospitalisations, and protect vulnerable communities as much as possible in the coming weeks, while we keep lifting vaccination numbers.‚Äù

New Zealand announced 60 new cases of Covid-19 on Monday, with the total number of cases in the outbreak hitting 2,005.

Twenty-four of Monday‚Äôs 60 cases have not yet been linked to existing infections, and 140 cases are unlinked from the past 14 days, suggesting there could be wider spread in the community.

Ardern said that the government would roll out a new ‚Äútraffic light‚Äù framework for pandemic management, which will include a pathway out of lockdown, on Friday. It will include a high vaccination target. She also ruled out a short term level 4 ‚Äúcircuit breaker‚Äù lockdown to interrupt spread ‚Äì saying that noncompliance meant it was less likely to be effective.

Pandemic modeller for research centre Te Punaha Matatini Shaun Hendy told Stuff on Monday that ‚Äúrelaxation at the moment would be very dangerous‚Äù. While first doses hitting 90% was an important milestone, he said attention should be on the double-dosed figure. Hendy has been calling for government to consider a ‚Äúcircuit breaker‚Äù temporary return to level 4 to interrupt virus transmission as vaccination rates rise.

He said on Monday that while that would not take New Zealand back to Covid zero, it could ensure cases did not outpace contact tracing and hospital capacity. ‚ÄúThe goal of a circuit breaker would be to contain spread so we can relax with case numbers that are manageable by targeted public health measures. It is not another attempt at elimination, but to keep spread in check while vaccination coverage climbs,‚Äù Hendy said.

Prominent MƒÅori groups have strongly opposed the prospect of loosened restrictions, and said it would lead to more deaths and illness in indigenous communities. The National Iwi Chairs Forum released a statement on Monday strongly rejecting a new ‚Äútraffic light‚Äù system that the government has been considering to replace its existing alert levels.

‚ÄúMƒÅori and Pacific vaccination rates have to increase to the same level as other New Zealanders otherwise the infection and mortality rate will disproportionally affect our vulnerable communities,‚Äù said Lisa Tumahai, chair of the Pandemic Response Group. ‚ÄúOur focus is now giving priority to keeping our communities safe‚Äù

Mike Smith, a MƒÅori leader from NgƒÅ Puhi and NgƒÅti Kuri, said ‚Äúa strong joint statement was presented to the Crown last night to make it absolutely clear that we reject the Traffic Light Framework‚Äù.

‚ÄúThe vaccination strategy failed MƒÅori and Pacific communities,‚Äù Smith said. ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt recognise the different demographics in our respective communities, Pakeha have a high number amongst its elderly, for us the highest proportion of our population is our youth so when the Governments Tier approach targeted the elderly, it did not reach into our communities.‚Äù

Public health professor and epidemiologist Michael Baker said vaccination was not yet high enough to limit an outbreak size if restrictions were loosened up. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got only a small benefit coming from rising vaccine coverage, also the move into summer ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that will be enough to balance the effects of much more exponential rise,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWith a [case number] doubling time of two weeks, where will that put us in that pre-Christmas period? Will we be in danger of overwhelming the health system?‚Äù

Baker said the introduction of two new frameworks ‚Äì the ‚Äústeps‚Äù system introduced earlier this month in Auckland, and then the prospect of the traffic light system was ‚Äúconcerning‚Äù.

Too many frameworks were confusing to the public, and the two floated didn‚Äôt allow for the level of nuance needed for this stage of pandemic management, he said. ‚ÄúI find it really frustrating and unnecessary to move away from the alert level system ‚Äì [which] has now got a lot of science behind it and modelling,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThe biggest problem for me is just like the step system, the traffic light system assumes we will never need a strong lockdown ever again,‚Äù Baker said. ‚ÄúI think, given the pandemic is full of surprises ‚Äì we could get new variants of concern ‚Äì you would not want to have a go forward with [a] structure that didn‚Äôt allow for the possibility of needing strong responses in the future.‚Äù",,,,,,,,,1634549293,,,{},hh38jw3,True,t3_qaj1as,False,True,t3_qaj1as,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qaj1as/coronavirus_live_auckland_lockdown_extended/hh38jw3/,,3,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],,[],1634676267.0,

&gt;Police officers and others responsible for public safety should view vaccination against Covid-19 as a key part of their role, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation‚Äôs top infectious disease doctor, said during an interview on Fox News Sunday.

&gt;‚ÄùThink about the implications of not getting vaccinated when you‚Äôre in a position where you have a responsible job, and you want to protect yourself because you‚Äôre needed at your job, whether you‚Äôre a police officer or a pilot or any other of those kinds of occupations,‚Äù said Dr. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

&gt;Police unions in cities across the country are urging members to resist Covid vaccine requirements for their jobs. In Chicago, the head of the police union told officers to ignore a city order to report their vaccination status by the end of the day Oct. 15. Vaccinations are not required for city workers, but employees who are not vaccinated will be subject to twice-weekly testing. John Catanzara, the president of the Fraternal Order of Police in Chicago, released a video last week predicting that Chicago police officers would not report to work because of the vaccination policy.

&gt;In Seattle, the union said that the city‚Äôs shortage of police officers would worsen because of a vaccine mandate. On Sunday, Dr. Fauci said that employees in public service who resisted vaccination were misguided.

&gt;‚ÄùI‚Äôm not comfortable with telling people what they should do under normal circumstances, but we are not in normal circumstances right now,‚Äù Dr. Fauci said. ‚ÄúTake the police: We now know the statistics, more police officers die of Covid than they do any other causes of death. So it doesn‚Äôt make any sense to not try to protect yourself, as well as the colleagues that you work with.‚Äù

&gt;More than 460 American law enforcement officers have died of Covid, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page, making the virus by far the most common cause of duty-related deaths this year and last. More than four times as many officers have died from the virus as from gunfire in that period.

&gt;‚ÄùThings like mandating, be they masks or vaccinations, they‚Äôre very important,‚Äù Dr. Fauci said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not living in a vacuum as individuals. We‚Äôre living in a society, and society needs to be protected. And you do that by not only protecting yourself but by protecting the people around you, by getting vaccinated.",,,,,,,,,1634546604,,,{},hh35n32,True,t3_qaimg9,False,False,t3_qaimg9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qaimg9/fauci_urges_police_officers_to_get_vaccinated/hh35n32/,,14,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],,[],1634674555.0,

The adenovirus used is harmless and the body should not really care much about it at all.

Easier for me just to paste someone else talking about how they work:

&gt; Like the mRNA vaccines, the main idea behind adenovirus vaccines is to get genetic material that encodes SARS-CoV-2 genes into your cells and get your cells to make the virus proteins. The difference is in how they do this. Where the mRNA vaccine is just the mRNA protected by a chemical shell, adenovirus vectored vaccines use a virus we know is harmless to act as a Trojan horse. But instead of hiding Greek soldiers, or anything dangerous, the adenovirus releases genes that encode the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

&gt;Adenoviruses are a family of viruses that have dozens, maybe hundreds, of members. Most don‚Äôt cause any known disease, or they only cause mild ‚Äúcommon cold‚Äù-like symptoms. Scientists developed a way to use strains of adenoviruses that don‚Äôt cause disease as a delivery system for vaccines. So we‚Äôre using one virus to deliver the vaccine against another.

&gt;The genes for the protein that we want the immune system to respond to are inserted into the adenovirus genome as DNA. Then the person to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 is infected with this harmless adenovirus. When the adenovirus gets into your cells the DNA is turned into mRNA, causing the cells to make the vaccine proteins, which triggers the immune response. I‚Äôll also point out that when we insert these vaccine genes into the adenovirus, we also remove genes from the adenovirus so that it can‚Äôt replicate in the vaccinated person. This is done as an added safety precaution.

People often refer to the viral vector vaccines as old tech, but they really are not.  As of recent only six viral vector vaccines have been authorized for use in human at least one country: four COVID-19 vaccines and two Ebola vaccines.

I agree that it's a fact that older people have been dying more than young people of covid-19, but it's trending younger by the day, now that vaccination rates for people over 65 are so much higher than younger demographics.

This does boil down to the question, does it matter that older people are dying of covid-19 if they were going to die soon anyway, right? Or do you actually care about older people and want them to die of something less agonizing? Or even better, do you care about giving your parents or grandparents another year or two (on average) to live?

How high of a risk are you of severe infection? Are you immunocompromised? Do you have any of the [high risk underlying health conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html) which correlate strongly to severe illness?

If so, you're probably not the best person to be the caretaker of somebody known to be infected because you're at too high of a risk yourself.

If you don't have any of those underlying health conditions, then it's even more of an ""it's up to your risk tolerance"" situation. Knowing that she's infectious, you know you're maximizing your chance of infection more than you likely ever have before. Yes, the vaccine offers strong protection, but it also depends on how long it has been since you received your second dose. 1 month post vaccination is a very different story than 10 months. Have you had your booster if you're eligible? That's another thing to consider just in terms of how much protection you have from transmission.

Bear in mind that the vaccines remain extremely effective at preventing severe illness and death even as their protection against *transmission* specifically wanes. However, getting infected even if you don't have any severe effects or long term complications still comes with plenty of downside on its own. Being sick sucks, you have to isolate yourself and then somebody else goes through this whole song and dance of trying to decide if they should expose themselves to you, etc. etc. This is obvious, but I'll say it anyway, the more people infected the more risk there is to the population in general, so for relatively mild cases it goes a long way to not overreact and risk exposure yourself.

Finally, consider all the ways in which you can reduce the risk to whomever does visit your girlfriend, whether or not that's you. Do you have KN95 or N95 masks or are you just rocking the cloth masks? I personally wouldn't be around somebody known to be infected at all without a KN95 or N95 mask. For me this would mean I have to shave my beard to make sure it fights tightly against my skin, but I'd happily make that trade if I had no other choice. Also, can you get sufficient air flow in your girlfriend's apartment? This is one of the most overlooked aspects of reducing infection. The air should be circulated enough to recycle the entire volume of air in the space at least 5 times per hour I think is the guideline. At this time of year, you might be able to open up a lot of windows and use fans to push air around while still remaining comfortable and this can really go a long way towards reducing the chance of spread. And finally consider things like exactly how isolated your girlfriend can be within the apartment. Are you going to have to constantly be in the same stuffy room? That's obviously less than ideal.

At the very least you should be sure somebody regularly checks in on her since she has one of the underlying health conditions that puts her at higher risk of severe disease. Feel confident that the vaccine will do its job and she will most likely recover, but keep in regular contact regardless of whether or not somebody actually lives with her while she's infected. Don't hesitate to get her medical treatment if she's showing signs of more severe illness. Breakthrough cases are usually far less severe, but that doesn't mean bad things can't happen.

There are no good answers here unfortunately, it's a balancing act between leaving somebody sick alone to fight their infection and be bored out of their mind in isolation and increasing the risk to the community by risking infection yourself.

The general mental model is try to avoid exposure as much as possible, but monitor closely and act fast if things change course for the worse. When contact is necessary, do everything necessary to reduce the chance of spread even if it's hard. Good masks, air flow, limited time, limited contact. Assume you're infected until you know you're not if you've had contact, get tested and don't make assumptions, and keep yourself isolated in the mean time.

Hope this helps, good luck!",,,,,,,,,1634584246,,,{'gid_2': 1},hh55yrk,False,t3_qahelx,False,False,t1_hh52wbd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qahelx/daily_discussion_thread_october_18_2021/hh55yrk/,,14,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,1,[],,[],1634713811.0,

&gt;About 12.7 million of New York's 20 million residents are fully vaccinated, according to data released Saturday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

&gt;That's the seventh highest percentage of any state - below Vermont, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maine, Massachusetts and New Jersey.

&gt;Vaccination rates are highest in the southern and eastern part of New York state: more than three-quarters of residents in Hamilton County in the Adirondacks are fully vaccinated.

&gt;Roughly 73% of residents are fully vaccinated in Manhattan and Queens in New York City.

&gt;But vaccination rates are lowest in western and central counties: just 38% are fully vaccinated in Allegany County, which is home to about 47,000 people.

&gt;Meanwhile, the number of people with confirmed COVID-19 in New York hospitals is declining: 2,115 as of Friday.

&gt;That's down from a fall peak of about 2,476 patients on Sept. 13.

&gt;COVID-19 hospitalization rates are highest in the Southern Tier and Mohawk Valley.

&gt;Some communities with lower rates of vaccination are seeing higher rates of hospitalization.

Thank you for taking time to answer our questions. 

I'm really curious if you are aware of data which helps us better understand how pregnancy impacts the immunity one develops from the a first and second dose vaccine.

Specifically, I've heard that UNvaccinated pregnant women are 5x more likely to get COVID of exposed and 15x more likely to be hospitalized. 

But how do those numbers compare when you look at double vax pregnant women vs a double vax non-pregnant woman? 

And can you explain how boosters might change the above companions? 

Tldr: as a 2x vax pregnant woman not yet eligible for tbe booster, I have a sense that it's safer for my partner (also 2x vax) to engage in higher risk activities (i.e. go to a sporting match indoors) than it is for me, but is this actually backed by the science? And if its safer, to what degree?

We have additional worries too, like waning immunity, and folks that will not get boosters. Fortunately they will still have *some* immunity - but we'll all be capable of spreading what the unvaccinated propagate. 

I have to comment on ""the vilification of the unvaccinated, anti-vaxx, and vaccine-hesitant"".

I'm older. When I was a kid, Measles outbreaks were still around. I can recall my mother grabbing me by the collar and dragging me away from taking a sip from a public water fountain. Her fear was palpable, written all over her face as she wagged her finger at me and told me about all the sick children in our neighborhood. 

We grew up during at time when it was *smart and sensible* to *protect one's community*. We took pride in making sure that everyone in our small town was healthy and happy. 

Families that refused to abide by *common sense heath rules* were isolated and informed that they had a choice: vaccinate, or their children would have to home school. No outside activities, either. Girl and Boy Scouts, ballet and tap, bands, orchestras, and athletics were off-limits. Parents of unvaccinated children often found their employers were not happy with them. Some lost their jobs. After some persuasion, anti-vaxx families usually gave in or moved away...never to be heard from again. 

As a result of all this, as I grew up, I never heard of a child in my school who was hospitalized or died of an infectious disease. Not one. We were healthy kids, untainted by sickness until I was well in college, and AIDS invaded our world. 

As a kid I was thought in Girl Scouts to ""Always Be Prepared"". It's the Girl Scouts' motto. Doing things like getting vaccinated, washing one's hands, daily exercise, and eating a healthy diet were things that we were considered to be preventative - and part of being prepared. 

Over the years I learned that by taking one thing out of the layers of preparedness could topple one's safety: drinking and driving, over-eating, excessive sugar intake, fatty foods, failing to visit the doctor and dentist twice a year, lack of exercise, drugs, smoking, the list goes on. 

But there's one thing I've noticed over the years: lack of community preparedness, lack of social consciousness, lack of personal and professional care...I watched a thriving community break down.
 Neighbors who didn't care if the little old lady next door couldn't shovel her walk. Neighbors who refused to let childhood friends in their house for fear they'd ruin their carpets. Parents who stopped letting kids play in their backyard because they'd trample the grass. People who lived next door to each other who never spoke to each other for years. 

Finally we started to see a shift: a murder, then two, then three....beatings....break-ins, rapes. My little community is now a getto of millionaires, with cameras and alarms, all living alone...

This is where we are. Nobody cares about the public good. It's me and mine, and not *ours*. Societal breakdown. Psychosis. There's not much we can do about it. It's gone too far. I wonder if the best we can hope for is that those that *do care* about community and society can survive, if there is to be a society in the near future.",4755be2224af2962127ba0240951fa834ad20c00,True,False,,,,,0.0,1634508565,,0.0,{},hh1did5,False,t3_qa0jib,False,False,t3_qa0jib,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qa0jib/fauci_says_unvaccinated_create_danger_of_fifth/hh1did5/,1634508581.0,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,,,

[],False,,jdorje,,,[],,,,text,t2_ii7rl,False,False,"Note, this isn't news.  This is the final publication of a research from many months ago, looking in really great detail at something we've known since roughly Feburary: using a 3-month (well, 6-14 weeks in this study) interval between first and second doses is much better than a 1-month interval (normally 3 weeks for pfizer; this doesn't look at Morderna at all).

The highlights:

* ""BNT162b2 vaccine with an extended interval between doses is highly protective.""  Back in January, the UK and other countries really wanted to delay second doses so they could give more first doses.  So they really wanted to prove that doing this didn't make the efficacy any worse.  It's definitely not worse and this became clear very quickly.

* ""Antibody levels were higher after the extended regimen compared to the short regimen.""  [Neutralizing antibody levels are highly predictive of immune protection from symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01377-8) - at least in the short term, since antibodies do wane. This essentially shows that a longer interval is going to give better short-term (i.e. after the second dose, obviously not during that months-long gap) protection *against infection*.

* ""The extended regimen enriches for virus-specific CD4+ T cells expressing IL-2.""  This is where things start getting really interesting - and promising.  CD4 cells are the ones that scour the bloodstream looking for infection, and when they find it they release hormones that quickly scale up the immune system.  You can find on the internet with other studies such as ""cellular immunity against sars-cov-2 is mediated by CD4 cells"".  In short, they're really important, not because they fight off infection, but because your immune system is an army ready to mobilize and they are the scouts or generals (okay this may be a stretch).  This shows that the longer interval should give better medium-term results; it also predicts that another dose some time after the second could raise cellular immunity even further (something we completely lack research on).

* ""Antibody levels wane after each dose but B and T cell pools are maintained."" This isn't really news at all, but is of course good to know.  If B and T cells don't decay *at all*, then enough of them could give lifetime immunity.  If they decay ""somewhat"", then we could be looking at slower decay of immunity.  We already know that [antibodies decay pretty quickly](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2103916), which isn't surprising since they're just a protein sitting around and proteins break apart after a while.",ea329d914bbdcfd19575678b8e9c185d10412c0e,True,False,,,,,0.0,1634511903,,0.0,{},hh1koiv,False,t3_qa5h3l,False,True,t1_hh0pu52,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qa5h3l/immunogenicity_of_standard_and_extended_dosing/hh1koiv/,1634511914.0,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,,,

Many diseases spread in different ways.  Waterborne disease and vector diseases are usually a problem in poor and dysfunctional areas.

Because it is airborne Covid hits indoor air climates hardest where there is a built environment of displacement ventilation &amp; conditioning systems.

Most developed countries are entering the winter months with waning immunity in the population.  In addition &lt;12 year olds haven't been vaccinated.  While in many areas of the US, we're still seeing most infections in the unvaxed, several hi-vax counties in the USA already have more breakthrough infections than unvax infections.  Boosters will be needed in the middle ages and young adult ages to reduce spread.  Otherwise, the Delta disease is going to circulate amongst those with partial immunity from a vaccination.

Isn't your post, calling it a ""significant side-effect profile,"" a bit sensationalist?

Sure, you follow up saying ""merely an inconvenience for most people,"" but why can't we just say something like ""the overwhelming majority (99%+) of people who take it have nothing more than a sore arm for a day or to, and perhaps a mild fever for a few hours.""

Here is what is going to happen...  

In a couple of years, they are going to pull out a VERY long list of people that all died from heart disease or stroke in the previous two years.  Every single one of them will have been someone that got the vaccination.  They will then state THAT is the proof that the vaccination kills people.

Of course, LOTS of people (especially old people) die from heart disease and/or stroke, so if you have a 70% vaccination rate (which I hope you Americans get to, at least), then a VERY large (selected) portion of those that die from heart disease and/or stroke are going to be vaccinated.

But, the ill-informed/ignorant will only see a large list of people that took the vaccine and died within two years, and that will be the ""proof"" they need.

I haven‚Äôt seen any statistics on what percentage of people legitimately need to miss work due to the vaccine.

Heck, many of us are tired and or have headaches almost every day and we aren‚Äôt calling in sick because of it. 

My point is this:  we clearly have a vaccine hesitancy problem in this country. Side effects shouldn‚Äôt be ignored, for sure. But to imply they are ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù without first clearly specifying that the overwhelming majority of people have nothing more than sore arm, headache, mild fever, mild fatigue, unnecessarily contributes to the unjustified fear and hesitancy. 

And to call it an inconvenience?  To me, getting the vaccine and potentially saving my life or other lives is like winning the lottery.

The SARS-CoV-2 infection determines the COVID-19 syndrome characterized, in the worst cases, by severe respiratory distress, pulmonary and cardiac fibrosis, inflammatory cytokine release, and immunosuppression. This condition has led to the death of about 2.15% of the total infected world population so far. Among survivors, the presence of the so-called persistent post-COVID-19 syndrome (PPCS) is a common finding. In COVID-19 survivors, PPCS presents one or more symptoms: fatigue, dyspnea, memory loss, sleep disorders, and difficulty concentrating. In this study, a cohort of 117 COVID-19 survivors (post-COVID-19) and 144 non-infected volunteers (COVID-19-free) was analyzed using pyrosequencing of defined CpG islands previously identified as suitable for biological age determination. The results show a consistent biological age increase in the post-COVID-19 population, determining a DeltaAge acceleration of 10.45 ¬± 7.29 years (+5.25 years above the range of normality) compared with 3.68 ¬± 8.17 years for the COVID-19-free population (p &lt; 0.0001). A significant telomere shortening parallels this finding in the post-COVID-19 cohort compared with COVID-19-free subjects (p &lt; 0.0001). Additionally, ACE2 expression was decreased in post-COVID-19 patients, compared with the COVID-19-free population, while DPP-4 did not change. In light of these observations, we hypothesize that some epigenetic alterations are associated with the post-COVID-19 condition, particularly in younger patients (&lt; 60 years).

&gt;The memo states any civilian or sworn employee who disobeys a direct order to comply with the city's vaccination policy ""will become the subject of a disciplinary investigation that could result in a penalty up to and including separation from the Chicago Police Department. Furthermore, sworn members who retire while under disciplinary investigations may be denied retirement credentials.""

&gt;A separate memo issued Saturday informed officers their elective time off would be restricted.

&gt;""Until further notice, the use of elective time by sworn CPD members is restricted. Furthermore, the use of elective time will require prior approval from the Deputy chief or above within the requesting member's chain of command,"" the memo obtained by CNN said.

&gt;The memos were issued as the police union and Mayor Lori Lightfoot clash over the city's requirement that city employees be vaccinated and disclose their vaccine status. The deadline to do so was Friday. Up to half of Chicago's rank-and-file police officers could face discipline.

&gt;Chicago Fraternal Order of Police President John Catanzara has spoken out against the mandate to report vaccine status, telling officers they are not required to comply, and the police department has its own Covid-19 policy.

&gt;""If we suspect the numbers are true, and we get a large number of our members who stand firm on their beliefs that this is an overreach, and they're not going to supply the information in the portal or submit to testing, then it's safe to say the city of Chicago will have a police force at 50% or less for this weekend coming up,"" Catanzara said last week.

&gt;""That is not because of the FOP; that is 100% because of the mayor's unwillingness to budge from her hard line. So whatever happens because of the manpower issue, that falls at the mayor's doorstep.""

&gt;Lightfoot said Friday the city would take the weekend to check with officers who have not complied.

Since then, my husband and I have flown on three separate trips with two more scheduled before the end of the year. We've taken a few road trips, as well. We go out to eat on the weekends, though our preference is still to eat either outdoors or in a place with some good ventilation (windows open, fans going, etc), but we also don't have a problem eating fully indoors as long as the place isn't cramped and packed-in (meaning some of our favorite downtown restaurants are still on hold for now, but that's ok). 

I've resumed some in-person grocery shopping, something I did not do at all until I was vaccinated - though admittedly, my big shops are still done via pickup, but that's less to do with COVID concerns now and more to do with convenience. 

I will admit to very inconsistent masking. I live in an area with no mask mandates at all, and mostly I don't wear one unless mandated such as in an airport or on a plane. But - particularly when Delta was really ramping up - I did throw one on before going indoors most places, though I have somewhat stopped this again with numbers going down. 

However, as I am both vaccinated and also had breakthrough COVID\* (presumably Delta) about six weeks ago, I feel reasonably confident that I am not at risk from either contracting COVID again nor spreading it asymptomatically, so I feel fine going maskless for the most part. 

\*I guess I buried the lede a bit here, and this is probably the thing you're most worried about, a breakthrough case. Yes, I did have it, and I likely got it while traveling over Labor Day weekend. But it was a very mild case, and I still don't regret my decision to travel - the vaccine kept my symptoms easily manageable (and short), and we missed out on so much family time before we were vaccinated that the pros still outweigh the cons here for me.

Yes, overall you are better off going to college than not, as a whole, carried across the entire population.

1:  One in five (20%) COVID-19 deaths were people who were fully vaccinated. A COVID-19 antibodies researcher expects to see more deaths among fully vaccinated people as vaccine effectiveness begins to wane. ""The vulnerable are becoming vulnerable again,"" said Rodney Russell, a professor of immunology and infectious diseases at Memorial University of Newfoundland. He said research is showing that the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccinations begins to fade after six or seven months. And since older and vulnerable groups were vaccinated first, they're seeing the first signs of waning immunity.

2: France's High Authority for Health decided on Friday not to inject the inoculation developed by Moderna for the country's booster vaccination campaign. RFI looks at the reasons behind the move.  
The French health regulator decided on 15th of October to no longer allow the Moderna vaccine to be injected as a booster dose against Covid-19. Only Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine is used for the booster campaign henceforth for over 65s, immunocompromised people and their relatives, people at risk as well as health workers.

Eh, it's great if that belief helped overcome some vaccine hesitancy, but it's not really true. When you think ""traditional"" vacs, you're usually talking about some sort of direct antigen. The J&amp;J/Jansen vac is an adenovirus-based viral vector, which fundamentally works the exact same way as mRNA vaccines (inserting DNA/RNA snippet into host cells and allowing them to produce the antigen protein), just differing in the delivery method.

Forget about other aspects of breakthrough infections.  Lets talk masks.  Here is the current CDC guideline:

&gt; If you are fully vaccinated, to maximize protection from the Delta variant and prevent possibly spreading it to others, wear a mask indoors in public if you are in an area of substantial or high transmission.

Just to be clear, the entire USA is currently in substantial or higher transmission.  So, here we have the CDC telling us the vaccinated to mask up so we don't spread the virus.

Also FDA/CDC... breakthrough infections (and obviously subsequent spread) are irrelevant.  You don't need a booster.

At some point, even people that were the strongest ""follow the science, whatever CDC says goes"" proponents start losing faith.  IMHO their credibility is dwindling.

I have to say as a person that lives and dies by science, I've been so disappointed with WHOs crusade on boosters, and how swiftly many in the scientific community changed their tune to align with the WHO.  I find it so disingenuous that the same people that constantly preach to us that they are the professionals and we should leave scientific matters to them, are also the same people that are now dictating on matters that are outside of their sphere.

It's fair to come out and make a statement on bioethics with the cavate of it hinging on scarcity.  But if there is no scarcity, how is it ethical exactly?

Sounds like a ploy. Just when he will be substituted in office, he then is able to look back and say: See, if i was still in charge measures would be dropped. 

When in fact nobody can know by now how cases will develop in 4, 8 and more weeks. Cases will rise, that is clear, incidence isnt too great ATM either and hospitalisation rate is flawed as they do not recount data coming in later (situation is underestimated significantly according to RKI).

It was and still is RKIs statement that german vaccination rate is too low to drop every other measure like wearing masks indoors.

Lauterbachs opinion makes a lot more sense and is consistent with RKI and Drosten:

&gt; SPD health expert Karl Lauterbach assumes that central measures to combat the coronavirus will continue to apply even if the ""epidemic situation of national scope"" is not extended.

&gt; ""No federal state would be so crazy, given the current number of cases, to forego access restrictions for closed rooms or to bury the mask requirement in buses and trains,"" Lauterbach told the editorial network Germany (RND).

&gt; Lauterbach reacted to Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn, who called for the ""epidemic situation of national scope"" to expire. The time of this statement surprised him, said the SPD politician. ""We are in a situation in which the number of cases is increasing, vaccination progress is stagnating and significantly more cases are to be expected in schools in the cold months. Nobody currently knows exactly what to expect in the next four weeks, how high these will be Wave still will. ""

[],False,,blablahblah,,,[],,,,text,t2_3qimz,False,False,"&gt; Of those hypothetical 100 vaccinated and 1900 unvaccinated people, we should be looking at 100 of each to determine the death rate. If 1 person of those 100 vaccinated people died, you would expect 11 deaths among for every 100 unvaccinated people.

We're talking about two different numbers here. ""The risk of an unvaccinated person dying"" is different than ""the risk of an unvaccinated *hospitalized* person dying"" because dying and being hospitalized are not independent variables. 

So let's take a hypothetical 1000 vaccinated and 1000 unvaccinated people. Of those 1000 people, 10 vaccinated and 190 unvaccinated are hospitalized (19x unvaccinated), That is what the statistics say, yes? And of those 1000 vaccinated and 1000 unvaccinated people, 1 vaccinated person and 11 unvaccinated people die, as you mentioned above. 

So assuming every person was rushed to the hospital before they died, *given only people that are in the hospital* the death rate for hospitalized vaccinated people from our population of 1000 is 1/10 while the death rate for hospitalized unvaccinated people is 11/19.  

&gt; Of course, the numbers also vary by age group. In people 80 or older, unvaccinated people were 5x more likely to die. In people 30-49, unvaccinated people were 37x more likely to die.

That's my point. The reason the hospitalized:death rate appears worse for vaccinated people is [Simpson's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox)- for any given subgroup the risk of dying is not higher for vaccinated but because hospitalized vaccinated people are more likely to be in the higher-risk subgroups, the overall rate appears to be worse.",a910591ef127d04722b8edf345a2b033397f48c5,True,False,,,,,0.0,1634582482,,0.0,{},hh51n9v,False,t3_q8tfev,False,True,t1_hh4w309,/r/Coronavirus/comments/q8tfev/new_cdc_data_shows_the_risk_of_dying_from_covid19/hh51n9v/,1634582496.0,1,True,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],,,,

[],,,pegothejerk,,,[],,,,text,t2_38eke,False,False,"I'm not sure you read the article or the title, the title says their study produced evidence for, not proof of, biological premature aging. The title is fine. Also the study shows the markers for premature aging, about 5.22 years, particularly in younger people, but it's also present in older people. 

&gt;In this study, we took advantage of the prior indication that biological age, defined as DNAmAge, could be altered in the presence of viral or bacterial infections [[33](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8201243/#B33-ijms-22-06151),[36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8201243/#B36-ijms-22-06151),[39](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8201243/#B39-ijms-22-06151)], and the fact that shorter telomeres are associated with the risk of developing worse COVID-19 symptoms [[21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8201243/#B21-ijms-22-06151)]. In this light, we found that a consistently accelerated DeltaAge (5.22 years above the normal range) characterized the post-COVID-19 population, and particularly those chronologically under 60 years ([Figure 3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8201243/figure/ijms-22-06151-f003/?report=objectonly)A,B). This observation was paralleled by a significant telomere shortening ([Figure 4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8201243/figure/ijms-22-06151-f004/?report=objectonly)). Although the two parameters seem independent ([Figure 4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8201243/figure/ijms-22-06151-f004/?report=objectonly)B,C), both alterations coexisted in the post-COVID-19 population. All analyses were performed on blood with a minimally invasive procedure to obtain a source of genetic material exposed to critical environmental changes and associated with the ‚Äúbona fide‚Äù health state of an individual [[26](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8201243/#B26-ijms-22-06151),[31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8201243/#B31-ijms-22-06151),[40](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8201243/#B40-ijms-22-06151)].

&gt;However, much remains unknown about the effect of biological age on pulmonary and epithelial health following SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the lack of an appropriate algorithm and the invasive procedure that patients must undergo. The pathophysiology at the basis of these findings remains unclear; however, they may reflect a modified epigenetic environment, **particularly evident among the younger COVID-19 survivors** ([Figure 3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8201243/figure/ijms-22-06151-f003/?report=objectonly)). The progression of aging is associated with critical metabolic changes. Some of these changes occur at the level of metabolites regulating the function of essential epigenetic enzymes, such as the decrease in NAD+ levels, the cofactor of sirtuins [[41](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8201243/#B41-ijms-22-06151)], and the reduction in alpha-ketoglutaric acid [[42](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8201243/#B42-ijms-22-06151)], the cofactor for all dioxygenases [[43](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8201243/#B43-ijms-22-06151)].",,,,,,,,,1634585675,,,{},hh59h4n,False,t3_qanspc,False,False,t1_hh56png,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qanspc/children_with_covid19_carry_high_viral_loads_can/hh59h4n/,,7,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],,[],1634715592.0,

My museum job is about to require all employees to return to work. Unvaxxed or vaxxed. No vaccine mandate for employees. Though we were promised that would happen when the FDA approved it. Now they‚Äôre backtracking. 

Masks aren‚Äôt enforced around the office, but are enforced for visitors and employees in the museums. My specific job requires me to spend some time inside our museums, but for the vast majority, I‚Äôm in an open office area. All but two people on my floor are vaccinated. And the two hold outs aren‚Äôt budging or wearing masks. 

I‚Äôm in my 30s but at high risk for severe illness from covid (controlled diabetes, controlled hbp, fatty liver). Just got my third shot. I also love my job and the people I work with. So I feel like I can‚Äôt make an unbiased decision. 

Would you start looking for another, safer job? Or take the risk and try to avoid the unvaxxed coworkers like the plague, while still working in an open environment?

Let's flip the script real quick and take everything indoors.

""Hey, I found a study that suggests that in well ventilated buildings with people spread out 100 yards apart and inside for 9 minutes, there isn't any spread.""  

Okay, cool, that doesn't speak at all to what happens when we slam people in a tiny ass room with poor ventilation for 2 hours.  And, yes, I will admit that I've ""extremitized"" it, I'll get into more realistic scenarios later.

And that's what the above poster is doing.  Okay, cool, it ""doesn't cross the line of scrimmage.""  (Nevermind the discussion about how many times did the NFL actually experience those opportunities given how robust their testing and contact tracing protocol was.  Infected players on the field on gameday were few and far between).  It ""not crossing the line of scrimmage"" doesn't speak very much to what happens when you have 3 hours. It's like if we took a look at infection rates of gas station cash register workers and said ""Hey, look, these people interact with people all day long and they aren't getting infected"" so we must be good to have 2 hour long dinner parties.  Ignoring the fact that most people get in and out of a gas station in just a few minutes and we know that time is relevant.

Time matters and so if you want a study that is relevant we need to look at something with similar linger times to attendees at a football game.  Lollapalooza would be a good one, right?  They did a bunch of testing and tracking and were able to spit out pretty solid data, right?  That's what we should be looking at, not the spread from one football team to the opposing football team.

So at the opposite extreme of the lifespan, it stands to reason that a three-dose schedule may well need to be standard.  Younger adults may do better with the two doses.

But I did make myself stay.  It isn't necessary, but in the future I want to eat out, go to movies and do things like that, and I definitely want my kids to get those experiences.    


I also have had prior experience with health anxiety.  I developed emetophobia and monitored norovirus numbers compulsively for 2 years.  I friended my children's friends parents so I could see on their social media when they said someone wasn't feeling well.  I also tried to my kid from school for 2 weeks, when the stomach flu was in the school.  At that point I went to therapy and it was a hard battle to recover and be able to deal (it is still a struggle to be honest).  So I really am trying to balance the mental health and overall risk assessment, with the risk of Covid. It is really difficult calculation especially after the politicization of the response got involved and I had to add in my personal calculation.",,,,,,,,,1634568564,,,{},hh445qc,False,t3_qahelx,False,False,t1_hh3ry8n,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qahelx/daily_discussion_thread_october_18_2021/hh445qc/,,19,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],,[],1634693969.0,

There are over 50 designated sublineages of Delta, which you can notice with the AY at the start of their name. COVID accumulates around 2 mutations each month, and very few of these mutations are ever used to determine a new lineage. Usually lineages are designated because a lineage has achieved higher levels of prevalence in a particular region-- usually because it was the first Delta genome to arrive and achieve success in a region. Even though in a graph it will appear like the variant took over the country, that's only because it was the first one there -- this is known as the founder effect. 

The variant in this article is AY.4.2.  
Because it is almost exclusively in the UK, and it didn't appear until 100% Delta prevalence, it is one that appears to be native to the UK, and it's less likely that its increased prevalence is due to founder effect. 

It is NOT as much of a jump as Alpha was to its predecessor, or Delta was to Alpha.   
Its mutations are not known to have any advantage to the virus, but S:A222V has appeared in other variants. S:Y145H appears to be more unique to AY.4.2.  
It is a variant that is bring tracked due to its growth in prevalence, rather than due to any knowledge we have about its mutations. 

AY.4.2's growth can be estimated in the graph below.

Question  What are the short-term and long-term postacute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) infection?  
  
Findings  In this systematic review of 57 studies comprising more than 250‚ÄØ000 survivors of COVID-19, most sequelae included mental health, pulmonary, and neurologic disorders, which were prevalent longer than 6 months after SARS-CoV-2 exposure.  
  
Meaning  These findings suggest that long-term PASC must be factored into existing health care systems, especially in low- and middle-income countries.  
  
Abstract  
Importance  Short-term and long-term persistent postacute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) have not been systematically evaluated. The incidence and evolution of PASC are dependent on time from infection, organ systems and tissue affected, vaccination status, variant of the virus, and geographic region.  
  
Objective  To estimate organ system‚Äìspecific frequency and evolution of PASC.  
  
Evidence Review  PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, the World Health Organization Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease, and CoronaCentral databases were searched from December 2019 through March 2021. A total of 2100 studies were identified from databases and through cited references. Studies providing data on PASC in children and adults were included. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for abstracting data were followed and performed independently by 2 reviewers. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies. The main outcome was frequency of PASC diagnosed by (1) laboratory investigation, (2) radiologic pathology, and (3) clinical signs and symptoms. PASC were classified by organ system, ie, neurologic; cardiovascular; respiratory; digestive; dermatologic; and ear, nose, and throat as well as mental health, constitutional symptoms, and functional mobility.  
  
Findings  From a total of 2100 studies identified, 57 studies with 250‚ÄØ351 survivors of COVID-19 met inclusion criteria. The mean (SD) age of survivors was 54.4 (8.9) years, 140‚ÄØ196 (56%) were male, and 197‚ÄØ777 (79%) were hospitalized during acute COVID-19. High-income countries contributed 45 studies (79%). The median (IQR) proportion of COVID-19 survivors experiencing at least 1 PASC was 54.0% (45.0%-69.0%; 13 studies) at 1 month (short-term), 55.0% (34.8%-65.5%; 38 studies) at 2 to 5 months (intermediate-term), and 54.0% (31.0%-67.0%; 9 studies) at 6 or more months (long-term). Most prevalent pulmonary sequelae, neurologic disorders, mental health disorders, functional mobility impairments, and general and constitutional symptoms were chest imaging abnormality (median \[IQR\], 62.2% \[45.8%-76.5%\]), difficulty concentrating (median \[IQR\], 23.8% \[20.4%-25.9%\]), generalized anxiety disorder (median \[IQR\], 29.6% \[14.0%-44.0%\]), general functional impairments (median \[IQR\], 44.0% \[23.4%-62.6%\]), and fatigue or muscle weakness (median \[IQR\], 37.5% \[25.4%-54.5%\]), respectively. Other frequently reported symptoms included cardiac, dermatologic, digestive, and ear, nose, and throat disorders.  
  
Conclusions and Relevance  In this systematic review, more than half of COVID-19 survivors experienced PASC 6 months after recovery. The most common PASC involved functional mobility impairments, pulmonary abnormalities, and mental health disorders. These long-term PASC effects occur on a scale that could overwhelm existing health care capacity, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.",,,,,,,,,1634571283,,,{},hh4ahiu,True,t3_qap3bq,False,True,t3_qap3bq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qap3bq/shortterm_and_longterm_rates_of_postacute/hh4ahiu/,,3,,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,,,0,[],,[],1634697480.0,
