**Question:** 

&gt; Should I take ibuprofen \(e.g. Advil®\) or acetaminophen \(e.g. Tylenol®\) for side effects from the COVID-19 vaccine or will it change the effectiveness of the vaccine? If I took medications beforehand do I need to get the vaccine again or have antibody testing to make sure it worked?

**Answer:** 

&gt; For most vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, it is not recommended for adults to take pain or fever-reducing medications beforehand. Medications \(such as acetaminophen \(Tylenol\) or ibuprofen \(Advil, Motrin\) should not be given before or during the vaccine appointment. Adults can take these medications for fever or soreness after receiving the vaccine if needed. Please read the HealthLinkBC file and BCCDC vaccine after care sheet. Check with your health care provider if you need advice about medication.

I know that no medicine is without risk, and they way people see it is that they 'might' get covid and after that 'might' have issues, or they 'definitely' get the vaccine and then 'might' have issues, plus there is a small chance they 'might' still get covid and all of its problems.

It's difficult to get a good idea of how common this side effect is, sadly. Tons of people on the tinnitus forums I'm a part of have reported their tinnitus worsening after the first dose. Of course, that's not the most reliable sample since the only people that really post about their vaccine experience on the forum are people that have had a spike. It makes it seem much more prevalent than it likely is. 

Additionally, tinnitus tends to spike randomly/for no reason lots of the time so there's no way to know if it came from the vaccine or if it was a completely unrelated spike. Lots of people are getting spikes 2 or 3 weeks later and deciding it must have been the vaccine that caused the spike, which doesn't make much sense to me at all. 

Mine increased 45 minutes or so after I received the injection and got louder than it has even been before. I could hear it over pretty much everything.

Hard to pull the numbers apart from the diseases it is associated with, like heart disease and diabetes though. But it causes massive health and economic harms in this country. It was obvious that it was a major complicating factor for Covid from even the Italian mortality data coming out in March 2020. And yet, public health chose to say nothing about it until late 2020 and I don't think I've ever seen the CDC suggest that people lose weight to decrease their risks from Covid. It's a little baffling.

Losing weight is not that hard. After seeing the risks I chose to drop 60-65 lbs and went from a BMI of over 33 to under 25. That took about 9 months. At no point was I starving myself or eating food that I didn't enjoy. Weight loss can be achieved entirely through calorie deficit from diet and exercise is not needed (although has other health benefits). Regardless of Covid I added years to my life and feel better.

It's truly bizarre that public health agencies chose to not encourage people to lose weight if they are obese or overweight.

Welp, they simply died outside the hospital.

Even if they were hospitalized for other reasons, I think they should at least test these patients before allowing them into the hospital during covid time. Covid has a strong crowding out effect to other respiratory infectious diseases ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/n1v32r/flu\_has\_disappeared\_worldwide\_during\_the\_covid/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/n1v32r/flu_has_disappeared_worldwide_during_the_covid/) ), especially for Taiwan, a country with little vaccine and immunity to covid, which means that if a patient there has covid-like mild symptoms, there is a large possibility that he got covid. So it is better to test the patient before putting them into hospital to prevent nosocomial infection( there are a lot of nosocomial infection cases in Taiwan now [https://www.cna.com.tw/news/firstnews/202106060221.aspx](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/firstnews/202106060221.aspx)).

Obviously yes, this douchenoggin should have taken the plea. But there are many people caught in a system that discourages them to exercise their rights. Many, many people plead guilty to charges they may not be guilty of because that's what their lawyer tells them to do: the certainty of a slap on the wrist versus the uncertainty of a trial. 

It's exploitive. I have been through this process. I have never bought or sold drugs in my life and have never taken anything ""harder"" than weed. But I pled guilty to a felony possession charge. Why? I was driving a friend's car because mine was in the shop. I got stopped at a DUI checkpoint. I blew nothing (I had not been drinking), but for whatever reason the cop wanted to search my car. Being young and ignorant I said yes. Turns out my friend had lost a single Adderall pill (he did not have a prescription) underneath his seat many years prior. I didn't even know he took Adderall. The cop found it, and I got a felony possession charge. 

I voluntarily took a pee test and hair follicle test at my own expense as soon as I was out of jail. Came back negative for all drugs. 

I was offered 3 years probation with guaranteed expungement in a plea bargain. Or I could go to court and try to prove my innocence and potentially be charged with a 5 year prison sentence. Which one do you think I took?

2.

If there's no such criminal offence for this in international law, create one so that such leaders can be brought before the Hague if they fuck up so catastrophically in future. We've seen several variants including the current Delta variant that have come out of this.

3. Misinformation and propaganda has been almost weaponized by political groups and even entire nation states during the crisis. There needs to be some curbs on free speech during pandemic times to combat this.

4. As a society, we need to stop disregarding illness, especially in the workplace. I used to work in jobs that had draconian-as-fuck sickness policies where if you called in sick more than three times in a twelve month period (even for legit reasons), you'd be subject to an immediate disciplinary meeting and probably sacked.

While shopping for eyeglasses in Des Moines last year, Shane Wayne Michael was approached by a patron and asked what’s become a familiar question during the coronavirus pandemic: Can you pull your mask over your nose? But Michael, whose nose was exposed inside Vision 4 Less, did not take kindly to the question in November, according to a criminal complaint.

What happened next, police say, was a parking-lot fight in which Michael attacked Mark Dinning’s eyes and genitals. Dinning told authorities that Michael then pulled down his mask and began to cough and spit in his face.

“If I have it, you have it!” said Michael, referring to covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, according to the complaint.

Weeks after the Iowa man was convicted of willful injury causing serious injury, Michael, 42, was sentenced Wednesday to 10 years in prison for the violent attack stemming from the mask dispute. Michael’s sentence is among the sternest yet nationwide related to an argument over face coverings since the start of the pandemic.

The sentencing comes amid a continuing flurry of incidents and arrests at places like banks and polling places over masks. There’s been an unprecedented rise in unruly passenger behavior on planes, with the Federal Aviation Administration saying that a large majority of its incident reports this year have involved people who would not comply with the federal mandate to wear a face covering.

A maskless Florida woman was recently sentenced to 30 days in jail for purposely coughing on a customer at a Pier 1 store last year. A Family Dollar security guard in Flint, Mich., was fatally shot last month, authorities said, after telling a customer that her child had to wear a face covering to enter the store.

Neither Michael’s attorneys nor Iowa Assistant Attorney General Kevin Cmelik, who represented the prosecution in the trial, immediately returned requests for comment Saturday. Efforts to reach Dinning, 60, were unsuccessful.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidance on correct mask-wearing says Americans should “put the mask over your nose and mouth and secure it under your chin.”

The incident, first reported by the Iowa Capital Dispatch, unfolded Nov. 11, 2020, when Dinning noticed Michael’s mask was pulled below his nose inside the Des Moines store. After Dinning asked Michael to pull up his mask, the two “exchanged words” before exiting the store, the complaint says. At the time, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) had just signed an order extending the state’s public health emergency, in which customers and employees were required to wear masks at “establishments providing personal services.”

The men offered different accounts to authorities of how the fight came to be.

Dinning told police that Michael followed him out of the Vision 4 Less and began assaulting him, with both men falling to the ground. Dinning said he bit Michael’s left arm when the man had gouged him in his left eye, the Capital Dispatch reported. Michael responded by kneeing Dinning in his genitals several times, according to the complaint. Then, Michael allegedly pulled down his mask and made a reference to covid while coughing and spitting on Dinning.

Michael told authorities that it was Dinning who started the fight when he shoulder-checked Michael into a car and poked his thumb into his stomach. The 42-year-old claimed he was holding Dinning on the ground to try to defend himself, records show. His father, Dennis Michael, claimed to the Capital Dispatch in April that Shane Michael has asthma and that he was “not going to cover his nose and mouth because he can’t breathe.”

But multiple witnesses at the scene reported Michael to be the aggressor, and one employee described him to police as a “problem.” A photo submitted as evidence to Polk County District Court shows Dinning’s face red and badly swollen, with his left eye swollen shut. Dinning wrote on Facebook how he almost lost his eye, according to the Capital Dispatch.

Michael was arrested and booked into Polk County Jail, records show. He pleaded not guilty, but was convicted last month, reported the Des Moines Register. State attorneys say the charge, a class C felony, can result in a 10-year sentence.

Michael’s father downplayed Dinning’s injuries to the Capital Dispatch. “It’s like [Dinning] got a black eye in a bar fight, and now my son is getting 10 years in prison,” he said.",,,1623596547,{},h1mm5mi,False,t3_nyp1gx,False,False,t1_h1lad54,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nyp1gx/man_gets_10year_sentence_for_attacking_and/h1mm5mi/,1623865663,618,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The Health Ministry's night update listed 103 Covid-19 cases in HCMC (44), Bac Giang (33), Ninh Binh (16), Ha Tinh (9) and Binh Duong (1).
HCMC already registed 51 cases in the morning and noon announcements. Of the city's cases on Sunday, 53 are employees of the HCMC Hospital for Tropical Diseases and five are their close contacts. All the employees had been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 with the AstraZeneca vaccine. Other cases in the city had come into close contact with previously confirmed patients.

Cases in the northern province of Bac Giang are all associated with outbreaks in quarantined areas and industrial parks, while those in its neighbor Bac Ninh are linked to outbreaks in Khac Niem, Que Vo, Thuan Thanh and Dai Phuc Districts.

Of the new cases in the central province of Ha Tinh, two had come into contact with Covid-19 patients and seven were found through contact tracing.

The case in southern Binh Duong Province is a 32-year-old man who had come into close contact with a previously confirmed patient and been quarantined.

The health ministry also discharged 171 patients and recorded one death on Sunday, raising the number of recoveries since the beginning of the pandemic to 3,998 and fatalities to 59.

The country has recorded 7,333 local cases in 39 cities and provinces in the latest Covid-19 wave starting from April 27.

Bac Giang continues to lead with 4,045 cases, followed by Bac Ninh with 1,343 cases and HCMC with 789 cases.

&gt;Patients are becoming sicker and their conditions are worsening much more quickly, doctors told state-run television on Thursday and Friday. Four-fifths of symptomatic cases developed fevers, they said, although it was not clear how that compared with earlier cases. The virus concentrations that are detected in their bodies climb to levels higher than previously seen, and then decline only slowly, the doctors said.

&gt;Up to 12 percent of patients become severely or critically ill within three to four days of the onset of symptoms, said Guan Xiangdong, director of critical care medicine at Sun Yat-sen University in the city of Guangzhou, where the outbreak has been centered. In the past, the proportion had been 2 percent or 3 percent, although occasionally up to 10 percent, he said.

&gt;Doctors in Britain and Brazil have reported similar trends with the variants that circulated in those countries, but the severity of those variants has not yet been confirmed.

Vice premier Golikova: claimed, that if someone has a drop of alcohol after vaccination during 42 days - then probably would become incapacitated for entire life. People figured out - if vaccine is so much pressure, that even a single drop of alcohol would cause so severe health effects - better to keep away from vaccine.

officials behaviour: compare - Biden/Harris call to vaccinate on their social accounts every other day. Putin asked twice to vaccinate, no other official is active in asking people to vaccine.

vaccine producers: started social accounts to promote vaccine abroad and NO social accounts in Russian language

A non-coercive plea deal would be 30-40% less time in prison - not 100% less time in prison. Enough that an obviously guilty person that knows they will lose the case to plea to avoid using court resources but not so much that an innocent person will not take the plea out of fear of what a guilty verdict may result in. 

The system as it is today is designed to discourage people from exercising their rights. While in this case, the guy is clearly a douchenoggin, I'm not sure a 10 year prison sentence is reasonable either - but because he refused the plea, he is going to be ""made an example of"" with an extreme sentence. That way - the next person, regardless of guilt, will be convinced to plea guilty *even when innocent*.

&gt;VBA ""coding""

You say that like VBA isn't a programming language. You can write applications in VBA that would blow people's minds. People have even even written Flappy Bird in VBA. 

You want to learn to code properly then VBA is a fine place to start. My skills in vba have been transferable to C# and Python and Powershell scripts.  Programming is programming and the major concepts are lthe same across programming languages.

It attempts (and fails) to statistically correlate total number days that each state was under mandatory social distancing and the “peak mortality rate estimate” defined as:

But that aside, the more I look into it, the more I get confused.

|OWID|Netherlands|Belgium|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Population OWID 2019|17.1 million|11.54 million|
|Vaccination rate OWID|120,594|135,545|
|Rate per 100 OWID|0.7|1.17|

|National statistics|Netherlands|Belgium|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Population national statistics offices 2021|17,474,693|11,507,163|
|Vaccination rate national dashboard|205,668|139,459|
|Rate per 100|1.18|1.21|

It jut seems that my initial calculations with worldometer data was did not match up, because worldometer estimates for the Netherlands seem too low and for Belgium too high compared to 2021 from the national statistics offices. OurWorldInData figures also seem very bad. They are pretty old and do not match up with the data from the national statistics offices. The vaccination rate for the Netherlands is completely wrong and also the data from Belgium seems different. And the twitter user seems to end up with a different rate per 100 for Belgium than me, so he either used a different population figure, vaccination rate or both.

As always, you have to watch out with data I'd guess. I do not know which one is closest to the truth. But everyone can shape different figures by using different data. Data is messy.

It was wild. We went from being a busier branch to a *constant line down the street* open to close. There was no rest time at all, and the people became monstrous. We would have people coming in to yell at us about masks, about Trump, and especially about their 'Stimmies' and 'PPP' (which was like 80% fraud). I had to get loud with people daily about the masks, and was berated in some form probably every fifth person I helped. We literally had to have a police presence in the branch at all hours because we were getting threatened with violence so often.  


We were short workers -due to people quitting because of the stress, and people who got to take state-funded PTO to be with their kids who were stuck home- so it was even worse, and because we were short the manager kept cutting our lunches down and down...so we'd have sometimes a 10 or 11 hour shift...with a 30 minute lunch break at 10am.   


When covid inevitably made its way through the branch -due to the free-living assistant manager who kept going on vacation despite everything-, we came into work one day and noticed three people out sick...and an immediate email from HR saying 'there is no risk to you all, none of you were exposed', despite working in a tiny tiny branch up in each others hair constantly. A bunch of us said we didn't feel comfortable since obviously other people caught it and we made them send us home -unpaid, because it was in January, where an employer *could pay* for covid quarantines still, but they had to get reimbursed by the govt -as in, it was no longer *mandatory* to pay employees who had to quarantine-. Turns out two more of us, myself included, had caught covid off them.   


I started losing hair and breaking out in rashes from the anxiety and stress and eventually I had a mental breakdown and put in my notice for the end of that month.

Three of those affected had a history of capillary leak syndrome and one of them subsequently died. As of 27 May 2021, more than 78 million doses of Vaxzevria had been administered in the EU/EEA and the UK.

Given the safety signal has just been announced the ratio will likely increase as doctors now specifically look out for the issue but for now it’s less than 1 in 13 million risk. Or 1 in 26 million if you just take those with no history of it.

Things change. If you're not happy with how it is compared to ""the good ole days"", stay away and don't think about it. Is that so hard?

You learned it, you excelled at it, it was a tool to help you with your job, and it helped reveal your love of programming.  It's a good learning experience when you get started, but that's all it is.   You can build all sorts of forms and some integration with Office apps, but as you pointed out who is going to maintain it besides the developer?  It's also not in demand, unless you need to maintain existing Office applications. Even at our shop, we don't use VBA to extract data from Excel.  Apache POI is mainly used for any Excel processing we need. What's good about your skills is you can take the knowledge you have and study up on Apache POI, or review openpyxl, which is a Python library for reading/writing Excel files.  Build on what you have learned with VBA. With that knowledge you can learn other languages and use their libraries to integrate a web app with an Excel file, if you need. 

 Python or C# are great next languages to get started in, as is modern JavaScript, depending on if you are interested in learning web frameworks in demand, such as Angular, React, or Vue, or NodeJS if you want to work with it on the server side.  Learning these languages will give you a far better understanding of CS than VBA. I also recommend diving into data structures and algorithms on your own, because there aren't a lot of developers who have a firm understanding of it. Even intermediate skills in that area and you can run rings around most interview candidates.  You can find free resources on Khan Academy and real cheap courses on the subject on Udemy. Both provide a good foundation in theory as well as application.  

If you really want to shine as a candidate, learn a bit of DevOps. Jenkins pipeline, Docker/Kubernetes. Just enough that you understand what CI/CD is all about, how you can automate your own builds and deployments when you push code to github. If you have that on your resume, you'll stand out.  If not, study up on your own. There are a lot of free resources on CI/CD. Knowledge of it is necessary for employers to know you have full experience over the software development lifecycle.

Again, great job on using VBA to build tools and automate office work, and discover your love of programming using it. But please don't feel the need to apologize to people if you don't think much of it, because most of us don't. It's like buying a beater car.

Yes even the original variant was dangerous,  but if we take into account how unhealthy the lifestyle of many people is, basically being kept alive with blood pressure, cholesterol and blood thinning meds, together with insulin for hundreds of millions of diabetics, it is no wonder covid had such an impact even in early 2020.

But after a year and a half, the virus has evolved quite drastically, more than any other virus in history and more than even some pesimists expected. The delta variant is basically a brand new virus, more than twice as infectious (super quick spreading, it has replaced the british kent variant in like 2-3 months in Britain), more virulent (more serious disease causing trouble to younger and healthier people) and the main symptoms have changed a lot, it does not affect smell and taste anymore, not as much cough as the original wuhan variant, instead it disguises itself as more serious common cold with breathlessness in severe cases (headache, fatigue, sore throat and fever are the most common symptoms). Thank god we have the vaccines available because the way this virus adapts to the environment is crazy, it would be just never ending wave after wave after wave with hospital dealing with nothing else other than covid patients... Unfortunately I am afraid that the ease at which this virus adapts may mean it will cause many problems and deaths during the next winter, as way too many people are refusing vaccines ( right now  in most countries it looks like 60-65% of people will accept the vaccine, which wouod be probably enough for the original virus, but for the delta variant we need 80-90%, probably closer to 90% as vaccines lose effectivenes with new variants).

 I hate to be a pesimist after all the positive progress we have made in protecting people, but if we dont finish the meds for treating serious cases this year, I am afraid way too many people will still suffer.

It’s not a binary that vaccines ‘work’ or ‘don’t work’, it’s a spectrum of efficacy. You are imagining things and fighting a straw man if you think I said or implied that Sinovac ‘doesn’t work’ and does nothing. Chile can have different culture, seasons, and institutions, AND the vaccines can be meaningful different. It doesn’t have to be one or the other, and they can all be true at the same time.  

I also said there is ‘a limit’ to the power of hospitals to prevent deaths, not that it is irrelevant. All the oxygen and PPE in the world will not prevent hundreds of thousands of severe COVID patients from dying, as has happened in rich western countries with good hospitals. Nor is there any indication that Chile is currently significantly impacted from such problems.

[],,BonTempTucker,,,[],,,,text,t2_4lnjozzd,False,False,[],"Worked in grocery retail this whole time. For one of the companies that is generally considered the least shitty to work for. Honestly the company kind of did its best, and behaved themselves with as much integrity as you could reasonably expect from a big corporation. I had hazard pay from the beginning of the thing up until last month when they decided that enough people had the opportunity to get vaccinated, but that's still a better deal than some other grocery workers got. Fuck Jeff Bezos. 

Anyway, I am severely burnt out. It's not because my job is ass. Its never been ass, it got kind of ass over the last year and a half due to circumstances. reopening just means the job itself is less ass now. I'm not put out by restrictions getting lifted, since I'm vaccinated now. I'm happy to not have to wear a mask and I'm happy that we'll be able to have coffee in little sample cups again. I'm happy we got through the whole thing or at least the worst of it without losing a single employee. 

I'm burnt out because of customers. I just fucking hate 90% of them, and I even acknowledge how unfair a lot of that is. I think the whole pandemic enflamed a pretty deeply held sense of tribalism that I'd already picked up from my years working in restaurants and retail. ""Us vs. Them"" only now ""them"" were legitimate threats to ""us"" in a sense. You know, instead of just being obnoxious or pushy or condescending or rude, now they were all of that plus also wearing their masks wrong to prove a point, that their comfort is more important than our safety. Trying to negligently murder my elderly and immunocompromised coworkers. Or that's the way it felt. It's gonna take some time to deprogram that, I guess? Rationally I know that threat is over, but I still have an absolute white-hot rage reaction to seeing a strangers nose. Because of what their nose represented for a while. I've always been a little claustrophobic in crowds but now when I get boxed in by customers I just want to cyclone-punch my way to freedom and safety, and it's hard to switch that off. I think it'll just take time. 

I also hate new hires, and I also acknowledge how unfair that is. I know it's not their fault they missed the worst of it. I don't begrudge them their jobs or anything. It's hard to explain, but if you've ever seen Band of Brothers it's kind of like the episode towards the end where all the new recruits come in, all full of energy and ready for action, and all the old soldiers who've been through the whole campaign are just like ""...ugh, don't talk to me or look at me.""  I'm just so profoundly tired in a way that they aren't, which again, isn't exactly fair because they all went through a pandemic too whether they were working in my store for most of it or not. They've earned their exhaustion too, but I think it's just that tribalism again. 

All of this probably sounds a little dramatic. Maybe it is. I tend to lean towards the dramatic in most things, and this was one of the bigger things that has happened to me in my life. But especially at the start of this thing, there really was a lot of uncertainty, and pre-vaccination there was a very credible sense of danger. So I think my burnout is coming from the fact that I haven't had a vacation this whole time, customers still suck, I'm not really in danger anymore but since my vaccine I haven't really had a chance to slow down and really internalize that the danger has passed. I still have a lot of programmed reactions to things that are harmless enough now but were profoundly disrespectful and dangerous during the worst of things. And pretty soon society is gonna start gaslighting me out of thinking that I was ever in any danger at all, and people are gonna start rolling their eyes if I so much as imply that I took any trauma from this whole experience. You may even be rolling your eyes right now!

I think ""lock em up and throw away the key"" is bad for society. Prison doesn't rehabilitate. It creates even more screwed up people. I'm not saying abolish prison, I'm saying we have to remember that criminals are people too, members of our community, and we need to be just or we are creating worse problems.

I think punishment is warranted, but we should err towards leniency when the picture isn't clear.

Second, the same pattern showed up across all big states: On average, the ones with more stringent interventions had both better health outcomes and better economic outcomes.”


&gt;Two states bucked this trend, however, with New York and Michigan enforcing strict NPIs yet still ending up with poor showings financially.

&gt;”Michigan was all about supply chain interruption in the automobile industry,” Nickelsburg told Yahoo. “This had nothing to do with interventions. Factories were forced to close for part of the year.”

&gt;New York’s situation, he admits, is harder to explain.

&gt;”We don’t know the answer,” Nickelsburg said. “It may be that because of ‘work from home,’ many New York employees were working from New Jersey or Connecticut or even Florida, and spending their money there.”

&gt;As for why California’s unemployment rate is 8.3 percent while Florida’s is 4.3, Nickelsburg explained that people who dropped out of the job market due to COVID-19 aren’t counted in unemployment numbers, adding that “there’s evidence that states that opened up earlier may have reduced their employees’ hours because fewer people were coming through the doors; the reduction in hours per employee was 4.2 percent in Texas versus 1.1 percent in California. So unemployment is actually quite complicated, and you can’t really rely on it.”
