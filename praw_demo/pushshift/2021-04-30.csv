They’re giving the virus more opportunity to mutate, possibly making the few tools we have against it less effective.

https://www.minsal.cl/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/20210416_ESTUDIO-EFECTIVIDAD-CORONAVAC.pdf

First of all, for context, many latin maerican countries are delaying the second dose by months, and the ETA for second doses keeps getting pushed further, so first-dose protection is EXTREMELY relevant here. My grandpa has gone without a second dose for 2 months already, and we have pretty much the best private health insurance you can buy here. 

With that out of the way, the presentation states, assuming a 14-day period after the second dose has already ppased, that there's an 80% rate for preventing death, 85% for preventing hospitalization and 67% for preventing symptomatic infection. 

Slide 13 shows the efectiveness for people with 1, and with 2 doses. The single-dose efectiveness against symptomatic infection is, again, 16%. For preventing hospitalization, 35.7%. For preventing an ICU stay, 42.7% and for preventing death, 40%.

I can't stress enough that single-dose effectiveness in a place where doses are hard to get is critical, and Sinovac, in my honest opinion, doesn't go above a ""better than nothing"" in this area.

Compared to AstraZeneca's vaccine, which is the second most abundant vaccine around here, and isn't an mRNA vaccine, the difference is quite straggering anyways.

https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/971017/SP_PH__VE_report_20210317_CC_JLB.pdf

After about 21 days, the single dose infection prevention effectiveness of the AZ vaccine is around (hard to tell from the graph) 45%. After a month, it's up to around 60%. That's not too far from Sinovac's DOUBLE dose effectiveness, about ~7%.

*What are the current guidelines on NSAID use before and after vaccination?
Per CDC guidelines, it is not recommended that you stop taking any medications that you are currently on without first consulting with your physician. If you are taking NSAIDs daily for management of a chronic medical condition, you should not stop taking them before the COVID-19 vaccine without asking your physician.

The CDC recommends not taking additional medications beyond your daily medication regimen, including NSAIDs or acetaminophen (Tylenol), before getting the COVID-19 vaccine.

After getting the COVID-19 vaccine, the CDC does not have specific data or recommendations on whether NSAIDs or acetaminophen will reduce efficacy of the vaccine. However, the participants in the clinical trials for the vaccines were not told to avoid NSAIDs or acetaminophen after the vaccine, and there is not evidence suggesting that the vaccine was less efficacious in individuals that did take these medications. As such, unless you have a specific medical condition that prevents you from taking these drugs, most institutions recommend NSAIDs or acetaminophen for relief of side effects after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.*",,,1619842963,{},gwib5bt,False,t3_n1odmr,False,False,t1_gwiakrh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n1odmr/daily_discussion_thread_april_30_2021/gwib5bt/,1619872510,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I think it is important to know if variants impact young people harder than the virus did last year, but I don't think we can do that based on a doctor saying they're seeing more young patients without more information. Are they seeing more young people because they are seeing less old people who have largely been vaccinated and are noting a change in ratio? Are they seeing more young people because there are more cases and as a result more hospitalizations in their area?

It’s not that deadly for younger people compared to the older population, that’s true.  But some people have had lingering effects from the disease including respiratory problems.  It’s far more contagious than the flu.  And as far as I know young people are still far more likely to die from covid than from influenza.  

Second, getting the vaccine also makes it less likely that you pass the virus on to someone else, even if you’re not that concerned with getting sick yourself.  I wouldn’t call someone selfish for not wanting to get a vaccine that isn’t fully approved.  But I do think people should want to look out for others.  

I personally think the vaccine is worth it both to avoid the risk of developing long term complications from getting the virus and to reduce the risk that I spread the virus to my loved ones, especially the older people in my family.

I lost my smell completely, but not my hunger. All the foods I liked tasted strange and unpleasant with no sense of smell, and I found myself eating strange stuff - uncooked pasta, cans of peas, *anything* just to feel sated.

Sometimes, I’d eat something like an apple, and my brain would decide that since it didn’t smell like an apple, it was probably poison, and I’d get incredibly nauseated.

I got my sense of smell back after a couple months, and for a while all was well.

Healthy, wonderful foods like asparagus and eggs and grapefruit taste and smell like rotting meat.

During the 2019-2020 influenza season, CDC estimates that influenza was associated with 38 million illnesses, 18 million medical visits, 405,000 hospitalizations, and 22,000 deaths. The influenza burden was higher in young children (0-4 years) and adults (18-49 years) compared with a recent season with the 2017-2018 season, a recent season with high severity, and provides evidence to support how severe seasonal influenza can be at any age.*

The government did not react to the moral panic of the episcopate - or it still has little knowledge of virology (which is very likely) and did not know the arguments that could weaken Bishop Wróbel's phobias, or deliberately decided to remain silent, hoping that it would dry itself. 

Many older people, traditionally more sensitive to the teachings of the Church, have already been vaccinated with Pfizer and Moderna, and younger generations are more afraid of the risk of thrombosis (although its probability is minimal) than the fixations of fundamentalists, so they deny the Astra and Johnson vaccinations collectively anyway. We checked a dozen or so vaccination points in Silesia - out of ten people, three or four agree to it! Fake pandemic The latest changes in the vaccination schedule, opening it up to almost all comers, and the decision to allow unused doses to be given to anyone over 18 years old, is the government's reaction to the increasing signals that interest in vaccinations is declining in younger age groups and the lack of a second dose . 

Although the Ministry of Health updates the statistics daily, showing the number of vaccinations is constantly increasing, it does not say how many people who should have been immunized long ago have still not shown interest. Out of 157 thousand As of April 20, the second dose of authorized doctors received the second dose, and the first 86% - Does that mean that others would sign an appeal for ""improperly tested vaccines that can lead to gene modification"", or are they affected by other phobias? In other medical professions, the percentage of unvaccinated people is even greater, with only half of the nurses, midwives and pharmacists after the second dose. The first was accepted only by 70 percent. 

From the group of 16 thousand Laboratory diagnosticians were vaccinated with the first dose of 72 percent, and the second dose only 57 percent, although the stage ""0"" provided for them is long behind us. Moderate interest has also arisen among 60-year-olds, because less than a half of the five-million-strong representation of this age group has so far been instilled. Still waiting for the first injection of 1 million 475 thousand. people aged 75+. Apparently, the oldest seniors are currently the best vaccinated population in Poland, but the e-Health Center data shows that after 3,969,504 referrals were issued, 1,389,289 people received the first dose and the second 916,844 people. So also not even half of it has been reached. 

So what will be the answer of the younger age groups? 30- and 40-year-olds do not see many victims of covid among their peers, so they perceive the pandemic through the prism of restrictions and do not understand the relationship between the degree of vaccination of society and the date of return to a relatively normal life. Especially that after the sting it is still required to wear masks and respect sanitary rules - loosening of the restrictions should be expected only after achieving herd immunity, i.e. at the level of immunity of approx. the whole of society. 

And how is this going to happen? since the enthusiasm is clearly declining? The youngest age groups are most influenced by social media, where conspiracy theories are buzzing. And the system is constructed in such a way that it is enough to hit one anti-vaccine bubble to not be able to get out of it quickly - Facebook, Twitter or Instagram algorithms can perfectly read the emotions of a delinquent caught online and offer him friends and content tailored to his expectations. After reading the discussions on Internet forums, one can only confirm the belief that Bill Gates does want to depopulate the world through vaccination or that gene damage is one of the side effects. 

And even if someone does not believe this absurdity, he will certainly be convinced by the opinion of a neighbor or a peer, who will call a temporary pain in the arm or a fever of two days the worst suffering in life and advise against this ""experiment."" According to the sociologist Tomasz Sobierajski, anti-vaccination movements do their best to present their pseudoscientific assumptions, based on emotions, judgments and internal fears in a way that resembles the language of science. - It is a paradox because people who oppose scientific achievements try to pretend to be scientists by relying on both false research and questionable authorities. It is also a paradox that the media, and often scientists themselves, are more and more often defending these pseudo-authorities, referring to the need to maintain symmetry and freedom of speech. Thus, the repeated nonsense becomes truthful. And it spreads like a virus for which there is no vaccine.

[],,rdtm32,,,[],,,,text,t2_1kghf6,False,False,[],"I'll give my honest thoughts on a few fronts.

First of all, I don't believe that going into the ring with visions of elbow-dropping them with ""science says I'm right and you're wrong"" does anything good for persuasion. If persuading others is tangential and you just want to fluff up your own ego because their opinions annoy you, then go for it. (Their opinions *are* annoying, so I'm not even calling this illegit.)

Yeah, blood clots, and other weird freak reactions are a non-zero risk. They're pretty damn close to zero though.

Here is how I think about relative risk. Warning, it's morbid.

[These are the actuarial tables](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html). They predict the likelihood of dying within the next 365 days, for any reason, at any age. The actuaries tend to be terrifyingly good at their job; it's their analysis that life insurers lean on to decide whether someone's worth the risk of underwriting a policy to.

My age bracket falls in the rough range of 1 in 500 odds of getting wiped off the planet before making it to the next birthday for no reason other than shit luck. I tend not to think about this risk because there's always a risk of shit luck in life. It's a background level of low, but irremovable risk. It doesn't bother me because to let it bother me would make life unlivable.

If something is so low-risk that you have to move the decimal point to the left of your actuarial background odds of death more than once to describe it, it's likewise not something that I can let bother me, unless it's a dice I'm going to be rolling multiple times a day.

So they had, what, very low double digit occurrence of blood clots, out of millions of vaccines given? That's a *three* decimal point shift to the left from my background risk of death. On a one-time dice roll. An utterly meaningless level of risk.

In exchange, what do I get?

Well, if they're quoting Joe Rogan about how healthy young people are already at low risk from COVID even without the vaccine... that part isn't strictly wrong.

This is where I don't agree that we should scan the news for breakthrough or extreme outlier cases or anecdotes about young people who had bad COVID outcomes. For the same reason that it's wrong to do that with freak rare occurrences of damaging vaccination symptoms. We don't go through life judging risks by the rare outcomes at the tail end.

And that's what COVID severity for healthy young people is - a rare, tail-end outcome. All the people beating that ""fear of COVID is good ackshually"" drum are going to internalize that cognitively errant ethos and wake up flummoxed 20 years later that they've never been able to feel safe about anything and they've wasted their whole lives. It's stupid.

If you're young and healthy, you're extremely unlikely to die from COVID, or go to the hospital, or have lifelong damage. Variants or not. Misleading people about this doesn't help anyone. Yes, when something is as widely dispersed as COVID is, even the low-risk tail-end outcome of bad outcomes for young people could wind up higher than we'd like in aggregate, and that's a legitimate public health challenge. But a healthy young person evaluating their risks isn't wrong to say that they're exceedingly low.

I personally weighted the threat of lockdowns to my mental health and personal security to be higher than the risks I'd faced if I caught COVID, and I still leapt for the first vaccine appointment I could get like it was a chance to hi-five Jimi Hendrix. Why?

1) The higher the # of total vaccinations goes, the more likely the country will calm the eff down. I like being able to contribute to that.

2) While the chance isn't brought to zero (nothing is; see above; actuaries), the post-vaccination odds that I could ever unknowingly transmit COVID to someone at elevated risk are absolutely demolished. Some of our public health messaging has chosen to downplay that astounding feat of science because they feel like they can't say ""vaccines prevent transmission"" so long as the odds of transmission are 0.00001%. Eff 'em.

3) If your friends hate the restrictions like I do, then getting vaccinated emboldens you to push the envelope. Now I feel extra confident doing crazy things like going for a run outdoors without a mask in my home state (well, up until this week, when they finally came back to reality).

If every measurable indicator that tells you ""this be a pandemic"" goes back to normal and sticklers still insist on safety theater even though the COVID threat is demonstrably quelled, then it helps to be vaccinated. Because then you get to turn the tables on the people who want masks until 2026 and ask them why *they* don't believe in the science - of the vaccines.

Spite, baby. If it helps get someone off the fence and into the pharmacy for their vaccine, then load it up.",,,1619838955,{},gwi4ygz,False,t3_n1odmr,False,True,t1_gwhvsvl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n1odmr/daily_discussion_thread_april_30_2021/gwi4ygz/,1619869093,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

But people keep raising the point that we physically cannot have long term studies yet since it's so new. But at the same time, I've read that RNA has been studied for many many decades and that shifting vaccines towards mRNA has been looked at since roughly 2004 because it would be safer? As far as my basic knowledge goes, the idea is that the mRNA causes temporary production of ""dummy"" spike proteins, the mRNA is then degraded (not entirely sure what that means in this context) and is flushed out of the system along with the spike proteins once they've been destroyed over a number of hours after vaccination. Is this about right and, if so, would this mean that the likelyhood of this developing into, say, a Pandemrix situation down the line where people develop side effects years later is extremely low if not impossible since the ingredients are flushed out of the system over the course of roughly a day or so?

You can't have 1.4 billion people all squeezed in while Covid is running wild. They need to be properly educated on the crisis  and that's where the government fails. They have let their people die and the numbers are shocking but are likely much higher.

South Korea as well is virtually an island. It's on the bottom of a peninsula (ocean on three sides), and has the worlds most militarized border to its north. Plus (just like Vietnam) they have a healthy degree of skepticism about anything China says so naturally they took it very seriously.  

All-in-all, countries in the western hemisphere could've done WAAAAY more to stop covid but then again, we weren't as mistrusting of China, we're not out of the way islands, and are way more globalized than the aforementioned countries.

It gives us an indication of what to expect, but we still need the evidence to demonstrate it in the case of both these new vaccines. 

That’s particularly true for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines because mRNA vaccines are essentially a brand new technology. These are the first mRNA vaccines licensed for use in humans in the US - we don’t know whether this delivery mechanism will result in long term side effects because we’ve never used it in humans before. It’s not like mRNA is a harmless delivery mechanism. A quick look at the RNA vaccine Wikipedia page will tell you that mRNA delivery into cells can cause really serious side effects in animal models. We haven’t seen those yet with these vaccines, but to pretend that we totally understand them and that we know that the vaccines are completely safe long-term is disingenuous. I think they probably are safe, but the honest answer is that we don’t know.

When people decide to take the vaccines, they are guaranteeing their exposure to something that carries an unknown risk of long-term harm. If they decide not to, they have a less than 100% chance of catching Covid, which also carries a risk of long term harm (risk depends on age and pre-existing conditions). They can actually make the risk of contracting Covid pretty low if they are very careful. To some people, the guarantee of exposing themselves to the unknown risk of the vaccine may just not be worth protecting themselves against a that they already have highly effective ways to protect themselves from.

I got over it as an adult but for my entire childhood every time I needed to get a vaccine was panic city in the weeks leading up to it.

I didn't want my kids to feel that way so from the very beginning it was always very matter of fact, explaining what would happen in a calm voice even when they were infants too young to understand, slight amounts of distraction, immediate hugs and then some kind of reward for being brave after.

They are 4 and 6 now and vaccines have literally never been a problem for them. We talk about how it might pinch like a quick bee sting and the area might be sore for a little while after, but we explain WHY they get each shot so they feel like it's worth it. And then we go get to pick a prize or treat, very exciting! 

We always let them know ahead of time when they will be getting a jab so it's not a last minute unpleasant surprise, but not so far ahead that they dwell on it for too long.

At this point the 4 year old opted to get her kindergarten vaccines as soon as she could vs waiting until her next physical, and both kids are actually looking forward to their Covid vaccines when they become available because they know it means the world will be one step closer to normal.

I don't know if they are just naturally less anxious than I was or if how we've handled it with them has helped but I'm so glad they aren't traumatized by going to the doctor's like I used to be as a kid.

[],,ColonelBy,,,[],,,,text,t2_fiscj,False,True,[],"So, I've been trying to parse the meaning of the study itself rather than just of the reporting on it, and I have some questions.

1. I freely acknowledge that representative sampling is an important and useful tool, but should this study's sample size of only 51 people really be enough to justify the kind of sweeping claims a lot of the reporting on this is making?

2. Those 51 people are all healthcare workers, and so presumably at heightened risk of infection compared to many in the general population. How applicable are these results outside of that context?

3. The lower levels of resistance being reported are just that: low**er**, not non-existent. I don't think anyone would dispute that receiving both doses is going to produce a more effective response, and it would certainly seem that prior infection operates in much the same way. Is it actually fair to say that the single dose leaves people ""vulnerable"" when in fact it actually increases their protection but not by as much as two doses or infection plus a dose? This vulnerability is relative, after all.

4. As nobody among the 51 people evaluated in the study actually ended up getting infected during the course of the period surveyed, what weight should we place on claims of the inadequacy of the first dose when within the study itself nobody got infected, and within the vast petri dish of the UK's broader roll-out its effectiveness in halting the spread of the B.1.1.7 variant in particular seems impossible to dispute? I am far more ready to believe that a difference found between two cohorts among 51 people is insignificant or incomplete than that the predominant single-dose approach to the whole adult British population has succeeded only by a series of millions of flukes.

I have no doubt that there are elements of this that I don't understand as well as I should, and that's why I'm asking. The need for more science specialists who are also trained in producing accurate plain-language summaries has never been greater than it is now, and the gulf between the reporting and data in study after study is an important reason why.

Demographic changes are very rapid, 10 years is a long period for them. For example, life expectancy in Russia grew from 68 years in 2010 to 73 years in 2019. Averaging over 10 years negates this change.

Also, Russia has a pretty complex [demographic pyramid](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anatoly-Vishnevsky/publication/325944623/figure/fig8/AS:711285402517506@1546595063291/Russian-population-pyramid-at-the-beginning-of-2017.png) with huge ""echoes"" of WWII every 20-30 years. Currently, the relatively small ""war generation"" is dying out, contributing to lower overall mortality compared to 10 years ago.

[],,itsdr00,,,[],,,,text,t2_4aujy,False,False,[],"**Michigan is now hospitalizing more people under 40 than those over 80 for COVID-19**

Dr. Stacey Sensor says her 18-year-old son, a high school senior, is “one of the healthiest people I know.”

“He works out every single day at five o’clock in the morning,” said Sensor, a Gaylord physician. “He takes all these supplements. He only eats healthy. And he got COVID at the gym.

“He was quite sick for about eight days,” she said. “So I’m telling you that it doesn’t matter what supplements you take, what your age is. ... Even in the healthiest individual, they still can get it and they can still become very sick and then the effects can be there for quite some time.”

It’s a cautionary tale, she said, for people who see COVID-19 as a serious health threat for the elderly but a much more benign illness for younger, healthier people.

In fact, Michigan’s current coronavirus surge has turned that assumption on its head: Last week, the state was averaging more hospital admissions for COVID patients under 40 than patients age 80 or older. The former was about 78 a day compared to 50 for the latter, according to data from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.

The biggest reason for the demographic shift, experts say: The difference in vaccination rates.

About 74% of Michigan residents age 70 and older have gotten at least one dose of vaccine, and two-thirds are fully vaccinated. For those 16 to 49, the numbers are 36% who have gotten one dose and 23% fully immunized; there is no vaccine authorized for children under 16.

Also contributing to the surge of virus among young people is the spread of variants that are both more contagious and more lethal; the tendency of many younger adults to disregard COVID-19 guidelines, and the fact that schools have reopened.

“It’s definitely become more of a young person disease now, probably because they haven’t been vaccinated and they’ve been more likely than older folks to go out and about, be in close contact with others and go to gatherings,” said Dr. Mark Hamed, a physician who is medical director for Huron, Lapeer, Sanilac, Tuscola, Alcona, Iosco, Ogemaw, and Oscoda counties.

The numbers bear that out. In the first year of the pandemic, Michigan residents age 60 and older accounted for 23% of cases; it’s now 13%. Conversely, those under age 20 accounted for 13% of cases during the first 12 months of the pandemic; it’s now 25%.

The chart below shows the April case numbers by age group compared to the monthly average through March 2021, as well as compared to December 2020 during the fall surge.

In theory, that’s actually a welcomed shift from the standpoint that old age is easily the biggest risk factor for being hospitalized or dying of COVID-19.

But experts have been taken aback by the spike in COVID-19 hospitalizations among younger adults and children.

Compared to the height of the fall surge in early December, Michigan’s average daily hospitalization admissions for COVID-19 are up 33% for those age 18 to 29, 58% for thirty-somethings and 64% for those in their 40s. Meanwhile, hospitalizations for those age 80 and older are down 60% compared to December.

“It’s like, you take what we were seeing before and shift it down by one or two decades,” said Dr. Joel Fishbain, an infectious disease specialist for Beaumont Hospital in Grosse Pointe. “We’ve got 20-year-olds who are getting admitted, and 30-year-olds requiring oxygen, which we never saw before, and needing as much treatment as we can give them. We’ve got 40- and 50-year-olds ending up on ventilators.”

Pediatric cases also are up. Last week, the state was averaging almost 10 hospital admissions a day among pediatric patients with COVID-19, triple the number in mid-February.

Deaths among children and younger adults have spiked, too.

In the first 13 months of the pandemic, there were six deaths among children ages 10 to 19. In the past month, four deaths were reported. Another 65 deaths were reported in April for 20- and 30-somethings, quadruple the monthly average.

The chart below compares April deaths to the monthly average through March 2021 as well as to confirmed COVID deaths in December. The numbers show how deaths among seniors plummeted in April compared to December as a result of vaccinations while coronavirus variants spiked deaths among unvaccinated people under age 50.

Deaths and hospitalizations aren’t the only concern.

While most COVID patients under age 50 “don’t get severely ill, there are a growing number of people who have long-haul COVID symptoms,” said Dr. Liam Sullivan, an infectious disease specialists with Spectrum Health in Grand Rapids. “They have problems with smelling, with taste, with concentration, with memory, with fatigue, with night sweats.

“So even though they had a mild illness the first time around, they’re still dealing with these things month and months later, and that’s not something you want to deal with when you’re 25 or 35,” he said. “Of course, you don’t want to deal with it at any age, but especially when you’re in the prime of your life.”

And for women, the research is growing on the dangers of COVID-19 during pregnancy. Dr. Kurt Wharton, an Oakland County obstetrician, currently has four pregnant patients in intensive care units battling COVID-19.

All four are “fighting for their lives,” said Wharton, who works at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak.

While COVID-19-related deaths among pregnant women remain very rare, Wharton and others say the evidence is growing that coronavirus during pregnancy can put a woman at a much higher risk of preterm birth, preeclampsia and admission to the ICU and/or intubation, especially if the woman has pre-existing conditions such as high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes or heart disease.

Evidence growing on COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy: Virus is dangerous; the shots are not

Doctors offer several theories on why more younger people are getting significantly ill with COVID-19 in the current surge.

One is the spread of variants, which are both more contagious and more lethal. The variants are “stickier,” Hamed said, which means it takes less exposure to make someone severely ill or even symptomatic.

Wharton noted the same pattern happened during the 1918 influenza pandemic. The initial surge in the spring of 1918 primarily impacted the elderly and babies. But the virus mutated and came roaring back in the fall of 1918, and its primary victims during that surge were younger adults.

“History is repeating itself,” Wharton said.

Another issue, suggests Hamed and others: More unvaccinated people are gathering in groups without masks. That increases the risk of exposure to a higher viral load, which has been associated with more severe disease.

“The best mask you wear, the less viral load you inhale,” Wharton said.

On top that, many schools have reopened and children and younger adults in particular are resuming their pre-pandemic social lives.

“You can see it,” Wharton said. “Younger people are all out in groups again, walking down sidewalks, shopping, going to restaurants and bars together. They just think they’re invulnerable.”

The good news is that COVID-19 vaccinations have proven “wildly successful” in significantly reducing the chances of getting the virus and spreading to others, Sullivan said. And just as vaccinations have blunted spread of the virus among senior citizens, the spread of COVID among younger adults can be stymied through immunization shots.

Vaccination programs “really need to target the younger people right now,” Sensor said. “They’re the ones who are getting sick. We’ve done a really good job of vaccinating our older population, but to really move forward and get out of this pandemic, we really need our younger people to step up to the plate and get the vaccine to protect themselves and protect their families.”",,,1619873245,{},gwja6gl,True,t3_n2hns4,False,False,t3_n2hns4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n2hns4/michigan_is_now_hospitalizing_more_people_under/gwja6gl/,1619893427,102,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

But its also not an even split. Those that have natural immunity are probably LESS likely to get the vaccine (plus kids CANT get the vaccine). So it wouldnt be shocking once the US hits 45% vax rate that we are close to or over that 60% mark.

https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ko7nwi/daily_discussion_thread_january_01_2021/ghqki1y/

&gt;On May 1st:
1.	The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been approved and is just starting to be administered.
2.	The vaccine is available to anyone who wants one, and can be provided at your local pharmacy.
3.	2 million Americans are being vaccinated per day.
4.	Restrictions (mask use, distancing, etc.) are beginning to be loosened up. Large events (concerts, sports games, etc.) have strict limits on attendance (25% capacity and proof of vaccination are required, as is mask use). Smaller gatherings are permitted. Most stores still require masks in order to enter. Restaurants, bars, and movie theaters are largely open across the country, but have 25% to 50% capacity limits.

So how did I do?

Well for starters it looks like the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine will not be approved in the United States, so right away that’s one prediction I did not get right.
As for the others? I think I did a pretty damn good job.

The vaccine is currently available to anyone who wants one, and it can be provided at your local pharmacy.

The 7-day rolling average of vaccine doses being administered per day is about 2.6 million, which is a little above my 2 million prediction. However, on January 1st my assumption was that we would still be ramping up the number of doses administered per day by May 1st, not winding down.

And while I don’t know the level of restrictions in every municipality across the country, I think it’s fair to say that my prediction on the restrictions still in effect is on point. Large gatherings (such as sports games) are allowed, with some capacity restrictions in some states. Small gatherings are allowed across the entire country. As far as I’m aware, most stores still require masks to be worn in order for entry. And restaurants, bars, and movie theaters are open across the country.

Lastly, here are the predictions I had made for July 1st:

&gt;On July 1st:
1.	Restaurants, bars, and movie theaters are back to 100% capacity across most of the country.
2.	Parties and in-person gatherings are allowed.
3.	There are no restrictions on in-country travel. International travel is somewhat restricted however, and travel to developing countries that have not sufficiently vaccinated their population is discouraged or prohibited.
4.	Large events (such as sports games, concerts, and festivals) are allowed, but they are limited to 50% capacity, and you will need to show proof of vaccination to attend them. However, mask usage is largely not required.
5.	It’s somewhat common to see mask use out in public, but the masking requirements in most stores have largely been dropped. The main exception to this is public transportation (such as subways), where masks are still required.
6.	The Novavax vaccine has been approved and is just starting to be administered.
7.	4 million Americans are being vaccinated per day.

When it comes to these predictions, there are four points that I made that I would like to revise.

The first one is point #2. As far as I’m aware, there are currently no restrictions on private parties or in-person gatherings anywhere in the United States, meaning this prediction of mine was off by several months. Even the notoriously risk-averse CDC has allowed for fully vaccinated people from different households to congregate indoors without masks or distancing.

The second one is point #4. I no longer believe that you will need to show proof of vaccination to attend large events. While I think the idea of a vaccine passport will be around for international travel, I can’t say the same about domestic events. Ultimately, I think the nature of the American public means that this idea will never really gain traction outside of very limited circumstances.

I also believe that most large events (such as sports games) will be open to 100% capacity across most of the country. With NYC announcing an anticipated “100% re-opening” by July 1st, I think it’s safe to say that the country is rapidly moving in the direction of losing its capacity limits in all venues.

The third point is point #6. I think it’s clear by now that, much like the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, the Novavax vaccine will not be getting approved in the United States.
The fourth point is point #7. While I increased the number of Americans set to be vaccinated by May 1st, I am revising down my estimate for July 1st. By the time July 1st rolls around every person who wants to be vaccinated will be fully vaccinated, as will most people who are somewhat skeptical of the vaccines but ultimately decide to receive them. This means that by July 1st the bulk of people who aren’t vaccinated are the people who cannot be vaccinated (such as children), and the people who are steadfastly against vaccination. Ultimately, I would expect a pace of around half a million vaccine doses administered a day by July 1st. While this may seem like bad news at a first glance, it’s actually great news. It means that all the people who I believed were going to be vaccinated in June/July will be mostly vaccinated in April/May.",,,1619877720,{},gwjhjma,False,t3_n2d649,False,False,t3_n2d649,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n2d649/daily_discussion_thread_may_01_2021/gwjhjma/,1619897919,16,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

## Summary

### Background

Obesity is a major risk factor for adverse outcomes after infection with SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to examine this association, including interactions with demographic and behavioural characteristics, type 2 diabetes, and other health conditions.

### Methods

In this prospective, community-based, cohort study, we used de-identified patient-level data from the QResearch database of general practices in England, UK. We extracted data for patients aged 20 years and older who were registered at a practice eligible for inclusion in the QResearch database between Jan 24, 2020 (date of the first recorded infection in the UK) and April 30, 2020, and with available data on BMI. Data extracted included demographic, clinical, clinical values linked with Public Health England's database of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, and death certificates from the Office of National Statistics. Outcomes, as a proxy measure of severe COVID-19, were admission to hospital, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), and death due to COVID-19. We used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the risk of severe COVID-19, sequentially adjusting for demographic characteristics, behavioural factors, and comorbidities.

### Findings

Among 6 910 695 eligible individuals (mean BMI 26·78 kg/m2 \[SD 5·59\]), 13 503 (0·20%) were admitted to hospital, 1601 (0·02%) to an ICU, and 5479 (0·08%) died after a positive test for SARS-CoV-2. We found J-shaped associations between BMI and admission to hospital due to COVID-19 (adjusted hazard ratio \[HR\] per kg/m2 from the nadir at BMI of 23 kg/m2 of 1·05 \[95% CI 1·05–1·05\]) and death (1·04 \[1·04–1·05\]), and a linear association across the whole BMI range with ICU admission (1·10 \[1·09–1·10\]). We found a significant interaction between BMI and age and ethnicity, with higher HR per kg/m2 above BMI 23 kg/m2 for younger people (adjusted HR per kg/m2 above BMI 23 kg/m2 for hospital admission 1·09 \[95% CI 1·08–1·10\] in 20–39 years age group *vs* 80–100 years group 1·01 \[1·00–1·02\]) and Black people than White people (1·07 \[1·06–1·08\] *vs* 1·04 \[1·04–1·05\]). The risk of admission to hospital and ICU due to COVID-19 associated with unit increase in BMI was slightly lower in people with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease than in those without these morbidities.

### Interpretation

At a BMI of more than 23 kg/m2, we found a linear increase in risk of severe COVID-19 leading to admission to hospital and death, and a linear increase in admission to an ICU across the whole BMI range, which is not attributable to excess risks of related diseases. The relative risk due to increasing BMI is particularly notable people younger than 40 years and of Black ethnicity.",,,1619877026,{},gwjg618,True,t3_n2ipsn,False,True,t3_n2ipsn,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n2ipsn/associations_between_bodymass_index_and_covid19/gwjg618/,1619897108,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;	A new study involving researchers from the University of Oxford and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) has examined the change in overall and cause-specific death rates during the three months of the COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020. The results are published today in The BMJ.

&gt;In China, the emergence of COVID-19 was first reported during mid-December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province. Coinciding with the January 2020 festivities for the Chinese Lunar New Year, the virus spread rapidly across China. This led to a national lockdown on 23 January 2020, which continued until early April.

&gt;The study analysed data from official Chinese death registries for the period 1 January – 31 March 2020, and compared this with the same period over the previous five years. The researchers performed separate analyses for Wuhan city, the epicentre of the pandemic, and elsewhere in China.

&gt;The main findings were:

&gt;The overall death rate in Wuhan city was 56% higher than would be normally expected (1147 v 735 per 100,000). This was mainly due to an eightfold increase in deaths from pneumonia, most of which were COVID-19 related.
Deaths from certain other diseases also increased modestly in Wuhan city, including cardiovascular disease (29% increase: 408 v 316 per 100,000) and diabetes (83% increase: 46 v 25 per 100,000).
Overall, in Wuhan city, there were about 6000 additional deaths (4573 caused by pneumonia) in January-March 2020 compared with the expected rate based on the previous five years. Excess deaths were significantly greater in central districts (compared with suburban districts), in adults over 70 years old, and were higher in men than women.
Outside of Wuhan city, the overall death rate did not increase, and was in fact slightly lower than that expected (675 v 715 per 100,000). This was due to fewer deaths from non-COVID-19 related pneumonia (47% reduction), chronic respiratory diseases (18% reduction), and road traffic incidents (23% reduction), all of which coincided closely with the lockdown.

It appears that China is not an exception to the common knowledge among epidemiologists that swift reaction, strict lock downs, contact tracing, and PPE usage are effective at preventing deaths from SARS-CoV-2.",,,1619895351,{},gwkmmxm,False,t3_n27a73,False,True,t1_gwilj1t,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n27a73/russia_records_more_than_400000_excess_deaths/gwkmmxm/,1619921596,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Enschede had to deal with many German visitors, said city center manager Duco Hoek at RTV Oost . The terraces
 were full and the market was very busy. According to Hoek this was to be expected; it was the first weekend day that people could shop without an appointment again, the terraces were open again and it remained mostly dry. In addition, virtually all shops in Germany, including supermarkets, were closed due to Labor Day.

Earlier this week, the municipality of Enschede called on Germans to stay away, but many people did not respond to this. Yet there was no intervention. Crush barriers were installed in a number of places, so that shoppers could wait somewhat corona-proof until they could enter the store.

Many Germans were also on the move in Venlo. Traffic controllers were set up to spread the flow of visitors over the various parking garages. The crowds did not lead to major problems there.

That's what makes SARS-Cov2 so insidious to deal with (is that it's so hard to predict individual reactions). You could be a healthy 20-something and 3 weeks later you could be dead. 

I was 46 last year. March-April I spent 38 days in the Hospital (16 of those days in ICU on a Ventilator).. and while that was early in the pandemic, Doctors still don't know why it hit me so hard (I'm not in any high risk group and didn't have any pre-disposing medical history). 

I fought back from the very brink of death,. took many months of Rehab and physical therapy.. and I'm (thankfully) pretty much back to 100% with no ""long covid"" symptoms.

For now. That won’t remain the case for long. Mutations add up. The more it mutates, the more resistant it will be until not even boosters will be worthwhile. And as of right now, it’s outpacing vaccine roll-out. We’ll develop new vaccines for the variants but it will take months of testing before they’re rolled out. By then, the virus will have mutated enough to reduce their efficacy as well, and then they’ll be ineffective before long after that.

First: cases are a dependent variable. You’re asking people to make the connection that them getting vaccinated will reduce cases. While that sounds obvious, it’s not obvious to them. 

Second, covid is probably seasonal. At a low vaccination level, it exponentially grows in all seasons without extraordinary measures. And at a high vaccination level, it doesn’t grow in any season. But at somewhere in between, it probably grows in Winter and shrinks in Summer just like flu. Tying to cases means we hit a vaccination rate that protects us for now but then we might get hit with another wave in Winter.

Anti vaxxers are afraid of vaccines ""killing them or messing them up"" but definitely aren't afraid of masks since they're just cloth - in fact many will wear them if they're afraid of dying.

Those who hate wearing masks, on the other hand, aren't really 'threatened' by them - just really hate the inconvenience to the point that it gets to them, which is understandable after all this time, and WANT this to be over. The only thing they might feel threatened by is when they're exposed to crazies who entertain the idea of masks being 'permanent', and hearing that from time to time, even if it's bullshit, makes them want to resist that. In which case, I can't really blame them. Or hearing in 2020 that it will go until 2022. But anyway, none of that is really consistent with having an issue going to get a shot.

Research has repeatedly demonstrated that COVID can and does spread onboard aircraft, with many documented cases in places that actually are recording the data.

IIRC, this policy also applies to ground-based mass transit, where ventilation is significantly worse.

The reason this policy is being extended is because it is still needed, and because current conditions make it very clear it will be needed at least through the end of the summer.

I suppose one of the things that lead me astray, is this concept of the ""attack rate"". From the article:

&gt; But the numbers actually look like this: 100,000 people are vaccinated. Before the vaccinations, they would have expected an “attack rate” of about 1% or 1,000 COVID-cases in that population. After the vaccines, that 1% is reduced by 95% and now only .05% of the population is expected to get sick - or about 50 people.

My question is, how is the attack rate calculated? Are the people studied masking and social distancing? And if the rates are calculated with that in mind, how do the rates (of both vaccinated *and* unvaccinated) potentially vary if those people do not practice social distancing and mask wearing?

Like, will the 95% vaccine efficacy stay pegged relative to the attack rate? Or will it stay the number it is no matter what, masks and distance be damned? 

Using your example as a reference, if abandoning all safety precautions doubled the unvaccinated to 40 people, and vaccinated people acted the same way- then would 2 vaccinated people get it? Or would it still be only 1 vaccinated person?

I'm assuming the first, which is why I was thinking of it the way I was before.

Yes, the Vanity Fair article is about what I thought. The last 2 paragraphs I quoted are instructive. After reading that I don't know how anyone thinks the Biden administration is going to ask to be ""repaid"".

&gt;As to whether the Biden administration can overcome the Trump administration’s contractual restrictions against sharing globally, a senior White House official told *Vanity Fair,* “I am confident that we will overcome any obstacles, when we want to do something internationally.”  
&gt;  
&gt;President Biden himself has made it clear that he intends to take a leadership role in the worldwide fight against COVID-19. On February 18, he pledged $4 billion to COVAX (short for COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility), a collaborative international effort working to buy COVID-19 vaccines in bulk and distribute them to the world’s poorest countries. Biden’s pledge makes the United States COVAX’s biggest contributor. The administration is “walking the walk,” said **Gian Gandhi,** UNICEF’s COVAX coordinator for supply division.  
&gt;  
&gt;Meanwhile, a Quad Alliance among Australia, India, Japan, and the U.S. is looking to boost COVID vaccine manufacturing in India, partly to counter China’s push to distribute its own vaccine to the developing world.  
&gt;  
&gt;And then there is the Defense Production Act deal with Merck and Johnson &amp; Johnson, which could lay the groundwork for an ambitious plan to make the U.S. a global supplier of COVID-19 vaccines.  
&gt;  
&gt;On Sunday, March 28, the U.S. government took what appeared to be another small step toward that goal. A cargo plane touched down in Mexico City bearing 1.5 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine that is being manufactured here, but still has not been approved by U.S. drug regulators. Ten days earlier, the Biden administration had announced plans to “loan” 4 million AstraZeneca doses to Mexico and Canada, and this was the first installment.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Before the doses could be shipped, the two countries had to negotiate separate contracts to indemnify AstraZeneca. Even then, the use of the term “loan” was designed to end-run the language in the original Operation Warp Speed contracts.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Last Wednesday, when one attendee at the White House meeting referred to the AstraZeneca “donation,” several people immediately piped up, saying, “Don’t use that word.” Said the senior official with knowledge of what transpired, “If they use ‘donate,’ ‘sell,’ or ‘share,’ it would be a breach of contract.” The issue has made “a whole bunch of \[government\] lawyers very nervous,” said the official. “We, the United States government, have never broken contracts of that nature. This is not like DOD canceling an order for a plane.”**",,,1619824887,{},gwheqde,False,t3_n1g9tl,False,True,t1_gwgnwz1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n1g9tl/pfizer_begins_exporting_us_made_covid19_shots/gwheqde/,1619855383,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The day the Fletchers, the retired couple, spoke about the vaccine with their family physician, Dr. Daniel Lewis, was the one-year anniversary of the day he was put on a ventilator with a severe case of Covid.

Dr. Lewis, 43, remained hospitalized for over a month. He was so gravely ill that he recorded farewell messages for his five children.

Over his 13 years in Greeneville, Dr. Lewis, a volunteer physician for school sports teams and chief medical officer for four Ballad Health regional hospitals, accrued a wide community of support. During his illness, people dropped off meals and restaurant gift cards on his porch and kept up a surging prayer chain. They mowed his lawn, mulched his flower beds, fixed his truck.

When he left the hospital, 34 pounds thinner, weak and wobbly, he and his wife, devout Baptists, struggled to figure out God’s purpose behind the ordeal.

Patients kept telling him, “I didn’t take Covid seriously until you got sick.”

So Dr. Lewis began using that hard-earned credibility to speak about the vaccine, visiting nursing homes, addressing churches, making videos. He honed his pitch to meet every pushback, from faux-scientific to conspiratorial to spiritual.

Although many Appalachians used to resist seeing the doctor, family medicine practitioners like Dr. Lewis are becoming trusted figures. But discussing vaccines with patients takes time, which many doctors can’t afford, and an established relationship, which many poor patients don’t have.

Dr. Lewis gives a soft sell that sometimes works. A patient will say, “So are you going to give me the vaccine now?”

He has to respond, “I don’t have it here.” The patient shuts down. “Then I’m not going to take it.”

Could Dr. Lewis persuade the Fletchers to get the vaccine?

Mr. Fletcher doesn’t fret about long-term side effects. His prostate cancer has returned, one more blow in a Job-like year that saw the unexpected death of his younger son, a paraplegic, and the death of a nephew, an emergency room physician. A year in which dear friends severed their relationship with the Fletchers because of the couple’s Covid skepticism.

“When you get older, you think you have no more tears, but then something causes them to come back,” he said in a subdued voice.

Dr. Lewis patiently addressed the Fletchers’ questions, delineating between what researchers do and don’t yet know.

“How can we be sure there are no chips in the vaccine, like the things you put in your dog?” Mr. Fletcher asked.

“We can’t make microchips that small,” Dr. Lewis countered.

“Well, it’s like a grain of rice,” said Mr. Fletcher.

“I couldn’t inject a grain of rice with a needle,” Dr. Lewis said.

Dr. Lewis held up his smartphone. If you’re worried about being tracked, he said, all the technology is right here, in the very thing you pick up every day. Every hour.

The Fletchers looked abashed.

“It’s your decision,” Dr. Lewis said gently. “I just want you to be able to make an informed decision and I want to do the best I can to help you.”

Mr. Fletcher replied, “Well, we have to spend some time in discussion.”

Later, Dr. Lewis was optimistic: “I think I can eventually persuade them.”

So charged have the Covid shots become that many people have adopted a resigned silence. A vaccinated 20-something barista has given up trying to persuade her not-now, not-ever father. A retired postal worker just lets her doctor assume she’s gotten the shots, because he is a family friend. But she hasn’t — and won’t.

Mary Hayes, who drove into Greeneville for a reunion lunch with a large group of vaccinated friends, is accustomed to speaking her mind. But she has a moral quandary: should she advocate for the vaccine or keep quiet? She got the vaccine early, because so many doses went unclaimed. In her remote corner of the county, people already look at her warily.

“A lot of times I have to temper my opinions in order to fit in,” Ms. Hayes said, tears welling in her eyes. “I’m walking a line between people refusing to socialize with me or not.”

Ms. Hayes grew up here, left, and returned to care for her mother. Late in 2019, while teaching English online to students in China, she noticed that some were disappearing from her computer monitor. They were succumbing to a mysterious virus.

Later, when her family went into lockdown, neighbors dismissed her fears.

“Appalachians were raised to believe they must work and can’t get sick, no matter what,” said Ms. Hayes, who has a graduate degree in Appalachian studies. She wept in frustration as familiar names appeared on her prayer chain, deathly ill from the virus.

On the door of her church, someone recently posted a newspaper letter. It derided Covid mask mandates, “the Prophet Fauci” and vaccines “made in part from aborted children.”

The topic of the vaccine has even muted the most influential leaders in Greene County: evangelical pastors. There are many who have been vaccinated, like Mr. Smith at Tusculum Baptist, but won’t use the pulpit to support it. He doesn’t want to risk alienating anyone, he explained, at a time when he hopes people will return to the church itself to worship. After a year of Zoom services, which people call “pajama church,” he fears in-person attendance will drop.

Daniel Shrader, who leads a small Baptist congregation, is all in on the vaccine. He wants church to be safe for the older, hard-of-hearing ladies to whom he’s been preaching during the pandemic by shouting from their porch steps.

In conversation, he’ll share his vaccine views; in larger gatherings, he sticks to prayer.

The pastors’ perspectives run the gamut. Mr. Smucker, the Mennonite pastor, believes that natural herd immunity — let the disease run its course — is a better path than vaccination. But he won’t preach about it.

Chelsea Daugherty’s father, a Free Will Baptist pastor, is unsure about getting vaccinated. Ms. Daugherty, a sophomore at Tusculum University who got the shot, said her father tells worshipers: “The Lord gave us common sense, so we’ve got to use it.” Make up your own mind.

So which trusted person will speak for the vaccine? Eva Fields?

She is a nurse-practitioner who treated one of the first local patients to die from Covid. Greeneville-raised, she has 24 relatives who had the virus.

When she asks patients if they will get vaccinated, about half reply, “No and I’m not going to.” Assuming she’ll be angry, they add, “I’m so sorry if that upsets you!”

Miss Fields responds, “That’s OK, honey. I’m not planning to, either.”

Her gut tells her to believe a video someone sent her from a far-right misinformation group, in which a ranter said studies showed that vaccines caused plaque in the brain.

Like others here, she is suspicious of Bill Gates’s involvement in vaccine development. One evening at supper, Dr. Theo Hensley, a vaccine proponent in her office, retorted: “I don’t know Bill Gates but I do know that Dolly Parton gave a million bucks.” (Ms. Parton is northeast Tennessee’s favorite daughter.)

“Well, she’s probably OK,” Miss Fields allowed.

“When someone pushes something really hard, I sit back, because I don’t like people telling me, ‘This is what you need to do,’ ” Miss Fields said. Echoing many others, she added, “I need to do my own research.”

For now, she neither urges nor discourages patients to get the vaccine.",,,1619824508,{},gwhe0i7,False,t3_n25d68,False,False,t1_gwhdprc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n25d68/faith_freedom_fear_rural_americas_covid_vaccine/gwhe0i7/,1619854998,12,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Greene County is carpeted with hundreds of evangelical churches that range from steepled 19th-century edifices to backroads barns. People scrape by on subsistence farming, jobs in small factories, welfare checks and cash flow from retirees who are moving onto the cheap, vista-blissful land. Drug busts for heroin and methamphetamine sustain a humming cottage industry of lawyers and bail bonds services.

Covid smacked the region hard this winter. Eleven people in Jim and Rita Fletcher’s extended circle died from it.

But no, the Fletchers, lifelong Greenevillians, will not get the vaccine.

What’s the point, they ask? The government still wants you to wear a mask indoors. “I just don’t see any benefits,” said Mrs. Fletcher, as the couple waited to see their family doctor.

Neither the science nor statistics of the new vaccine daunt them. Now retired and in their 70s, Mr. Fletcher was a telecom engineer, Mrs. Fletcher, a secretary and accounting clerk.

But the Fletchers, Free Will Baptists, worry the vaccine includes aborted fetal parts (it doesn’t). They don’t trust the government, convinced it has long manipulated Covid case numbers.

“I just think we have been hornswoggled,” Mr. Fletcher said.

People don’t put much stock in pronouncements by politicians, but they do trust Walt Cross, the proprietor of the Mustard Seed, a shop in Newport just over the county line, that takes its name from the Gospel of Matthew and carries herbs, nutritional supplements and local produce.

Mr. Cross, who is also a volunteer fire chief for Cocke County, is a tall, lanky east Tennessean with a blue-eyed focus and a warm mountain drawl, whether he’s describing his preferred method to rouse people who have overdosed (ammonia rather than Narcan) or answering questions from Covid patients about how to treat their symptoms (hydrate, eat, take herbal extracts, apply hot and cold compresses).

Before going to the doctor, many people phone Mr. Cross. Or after the doctor’s medicines don’t seem to be working.

Although his father died of Covid, Mr. Cross won’t get the vaccine. “We jumped into bed with the vaccine too fast!” he said. While he won’t tell people to get it or not, he says pointedly, “Do your due diligence.”

Mr. Cross, who lectures around the country and in Rwanda about preventive wellness, is studying for an advanced degree in naturopathic medicine. His shop evokes themes dear to Appalachians, with people calling these early April weeks the “redbud winter” — the spring chill during which redbud trees swell with mauve-pink blossoms. A store wall is lined with Mason jars filled with herbaceous plants like jewelweed, passionflower and elderberry, which Appalachians were taught to use by the Cherokee.

He scoffs at the perception that people here are vaccine-hesitant simply because they, like him, are Republicans.

“That doesn’t make sense to me,” he said. “Trump brought the vaccine in.” If this was about political affiliation, he continued, “you’d jump and take it!” Instead, he said, people think the vaccine is too entwined with politics.

In Appalachia, Mr. Cross explained, the fervor with which people sidestep the vaccine is ratcheted up by history and tradition. For centuries, Scots-Irish settlers tucked into the mountains to evade army conscription and tax collectors.

Jeremy Faison, a longtime Republican state representative who grew up in the area, agrees: “Throughout the pandemic, there are a lot of us who are like, ‘It’s a serious situation but me and my family can take care of ourselves.’ ”

Mr. Faison, a libertarian and an evangelical Christian, added, “So we take exception with the government putting mandates on us, pressuring us to do something.”

That view is bolstered by a religious, near-joyous fatalism. People say that if they haven’t caught Covid a year into the pandemic, they will take their chances. True, they might get Covid and die. But either way, a win-win: longer life on Earth or, for the faithful, eternal life in Heaven.

“There’s a time appointed for every person to die,” said Reuben Smucker, a Mennonite pastor in Greeneville who works as a garage-door installer. “We should take care of our bodies physically, emotionally and spiritually, but if it’s my time to go and it’s by Covid, well then, it’s my time to go.”

After Mr. Cross, an elder in a Seventh Day Adventist Church, counsels Covid patients, he prays with them. “That’s the most important thing,” he said. “Because it’s God who does the healing.”",,,1619824351,{},gwhdprc,False,t3_n25d68,False,False,t1_gwhde9l,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n25d68/faith_freedom_fear_rural_americas_covid_vaccine/gwhdprc/,1619854835,12,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The question, a friendly greeting to Betty Smith, the pastor’s wife, lingered in the air as the four church women sat down for their regular Tuesday coffee and conversation at Ingle’s Market.

Mrs. Smith hesitated, sensing a chilly blast of judgment from a never-mask, never-vax companion. She fumbled through a non-reply.

Recalling the moment later, she sighed, “We were there to get to know each other better but the first thing on the table was the Covid vaccine.”

The subject makes her husband, the Rev. David Smith, even more uncomfortable. “Honestly, I wish people wouldn’t ask,” he said, chatting after Wednesday night prayer at Tusculum Baptist Church. “I think it’s none of their business. And it’s just dividing people.”

As the beautiful Appalachian spring unfurls across northeastern Tennessee, the Covid-19 vaccine is tearing apart friends, families, congregations, colleagues. “It’s a muddy mess,” said Meredith Shrader, a physician assistant, who runs an events venue with her husband, another pastor, and who notes that the choice has become about much more than health care. “Which voice do you listen to?”

Communities like Greeneville and its surroundings — rural, overwhelmingly Republican, deeply Christian, 95 percent white — are on the radar of President Biden and American health officials, as efforts to vaccinate most of the U.S. population enters a critical phase. These are the places where polls show resistance to the vaccine is most entrenched. While campaigns aimed at convincing Black and Latino urban communities to set aside their vaccine mistrust have made striking gains, towns like these will also have to be convinced if the country is to achieve widespread immunity.

But a week here in Greene County reveals a more nuanced, layered hesitancy than surveys suggest. People say that politics isn’t the leading driver of their vaccine attitudes. The most common reason for their apprehension is fear — that the vaccine was developed in haste, that long-term side effects are unknown. Their decisions are also entangled in a web of views about bodily autonomy, science and authority, plus a powerful regional, somewhat romanticized self-image: We don’t like outsiders messing in our business.

According to state health department statistics, 31 percent of the vaccine-eligible population in Greene County has gotten at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, still below Tennessee overall, which has one of the lowest rates in the country, and far below the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s national tally of 55 percent. While many older residents have been inoculated, now that eligibility is open to all adults, vaccination sites are almost desolate.

Still, conversations here show that for many people, resistance is not firm. Roiled by internet fallacies, many hunger for straightforward information from people they trust. Others have practical needs, like paid time off to recover from side effects, which the Biden administration has urged employers to offer, or the opportunity to get the shot from their own doctor.

What’s also lacking is a groundswell that might encourage the hesitant to make the leap: Many people who have gotten vaccinated are remaining tight-lipped.",,,1619824182,{},gwhde9l,False,t3_n25d68,False,False,t3_n25d68,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n25d68/faith_freedom_fear_rural_americas_covid_vaccine/gwhde9l/,1619854659,18,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

[],,hahai17,,,[],,,,text,t2_stfmu,False,False,[],"&gt;&gt; The United States has agreed to send 20 million Covidshield doses from its own AstraZeneca order to India and will divert sufficient multipore filters that would enable production of 18 million more doses. Also, the first tranche of 20,000 doses of experimental Covid-19 drug Remdesivir is expected to reach India this week.
Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said in a briefing Thursday that over 40 nations are pitching in with urgently needed resources and countries that India had supplied essential pharmaceutical products including hydroxychloroquine, paracetamol and Remdesivir have come forward to help.
Official sources said the United States has agreed to divert 20 million vaccine doses to India but a timeline for the same is yet to be specified. It is believed that the US has 10 million doses in stock while another 50 million are to be manufactured over the next two months.
India is also in touch with China to ensure cargo flights remain operational as a large number of medical supplies are being sourced. “A large number of cargo flights are operational. Sichuan airlines, that has 10 flights a day, suspended operations and that has had an impact on supplies from there. We will be in touch with authorities in China to have as much of this connectivity open,” Shringla said.
While over 22 tonnes of medical supplies, including oxygen plants, arrived from Russia on Wednesday, first supplies from the United States are expected to land on Friday morning, with three military aircraft set to bring in medicines and oxygen related equipment.
The United States will also send 20,000 courses of Remdesivir antiviral drug by early next week. In addition it will be supplying Millipore filters from its own stocks that will enable the manufacturing of 18 million AstraZeneca doses in India at the earliest. 17 oxygen generator plants are also likely to be sent across.
In all, India is expected to get 550 oxygen generating plants from partners across the world. Oxygen supplies have been tagged as the first priority for all Indian missions abroad that are coordinating relief efforts. The US is committed to send 1,700 oxygen concentrators to obtain oxygen from ambient air, these mobile units provide options for flexible patient treatment, a statement from White House said. India will also receive oxygen generation units, these are multiple large-scale units to support up to 20 patients each, and additional mobile units that will provide an ability to target specific shortages. A team of US experts will support these units, working hand-in-hand on the ground with Indian medical personnel, the White House said. 
Messages of support are pouring in from across the globe, including a statement by Italian PM Mario Draghi pledging medical supplies. “Through our Civil Protection Department, we are ready for sending an oxygen production system, made available by the Piedmont Region for supplies to a traditional hospital or a field structure. A team of specialised personnel is also ready to start for ensuring operation of the equipment,"" he said. The Indian Navy will help bring in a 40 mt og oxygen shipment that has been gifted by Bahrain while 185 mt is expected from Kuwait. India is also looking to procure Remdesivir from Egypt, besides exploring other options to import the medicine. Manufacturer Gilead has already promised 4.5 lakh doses of the medicine to India.

Here’s the entire article. Where does it imply ""we'll divert our order from there to stay in India.""?

The article clear states “It is believed that the US has 10 million doses in stock while another 50 million are to be manufactured over the next two months.” So at least 10m finished in stock in the US already.",,,1619819665,{},gwh4bpx,False,t3_n2101s,False,False,t1_gwh195w,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n2101s/us_directs_20_million_of_its_astrazeneca_vaccine/gwh4bpx/,1619849942,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

My impression was that you essentially pay for the reproduction number, i.e. cutting cases in half costs more or less a fixed price, independent from the total number of cases.  Except that tracing and tracking ressources are finite, so it should be slightly cheaper if the case numbers are low, that's why I support zeroish covid strategies.

That's agains my logic, as I would assume they saved some money in the first half of the second wave, where they allowed for a greater reproduction number, but then they crunched the numbers faster than Germany, so they should have spent more money in this timespan.

Herd immunity isn't supposed to be a goal in itself, it's supposed to prevent future infections and deaths by making sure the population at large is essentially unable to be a breeding ground for the virus. If just as many (or even more) people die in an attempt to gain herd immunity through natural infection, whom would we have protected? 

People need to stop thinking ""herd immunity good, therefore, letting the virus run rampant also good"". Herd immunity is only good if not many people die by getting there (I.e. if it's achieved by vaccinating people). 

So, yes, the country would probably reach herd immunity faster without restrictions, but at what price?

- If everyone gets sick at once, the Healthcare system can't take care of the people who have to go to the hospital, but survive if they get there. This means the death rate could increase by a lot, because all of the people in the ""will die without going to a hospital, but will survive once in the hospital"" category will die (which is like 5-10% of the population, depending on the age group). This is one of the most important reasons why we've been trying to keep cases as low as possible in most countries (with varying degrees of success). 

- Even if only 1% of patients died, 1% of 1.36 billion infected people is a fuckton of people (roughly 13.6 million). 

- With every infection, the virus has a chance to mutate. Having the virus run rampant would be an ideal way to breed more variants, because it would mean more people get infected and therefore the chances of mutation increase.

Actually i did in my last paragraph. You probably decided to not read my message. Too large? Who knows? Companies and individuals staying afloat is important.

Never claimed that there should be no response. Also, ""lockdown"" doesnt even remotely mean the same thing everywhere and not every place is the same.

To copy+paste myself from a different response:

What would be actually interesting to me would be the local specifics which are incredibly hard to know for any given country if you're a foreigner. They matter greatly and are often completely dismissed in favour of a idiotic (sorry, i feel that it is) pro or anti-lockdown blanket approach.

In the case of my own country (Greece) we have so far 6 straight months of lockdown (!), we cant go outside without sending an sms, arent allowed to move to the next municipality in a car and sometimes not even by foot, we have a curfew that sometimes starts at 18.00 but usually at 21.00, the majority of the economy is closed and here in Greece the economy is not highly industrialised so if you close the ""non-essential"" bits you close most of it, the police has been so authoritarian that there was a HUGE pro-democracy protest etc etc. The situation in the hospitals has various details worth considering too for example: Gov decided to not hire the necessary ammount of nurses, decided to divert people from completely different medical specializations into covid units and ripped hundreds of private general doctors (when most vocal doctors were arguing that the gov should organize and strengthen first line healthcare in order for people to not end up in the hospitals) and put them in hospitals in completely irrelevant to what they know positions etc etc.

I mean i feel that way too many people will see all of this and think...

The reason people are encouraged to wear masks is because around 25% of covid cases are asymptotic. If you don’t have any symptoms, you can go out in public and wear a mask in case you’re asymptotic. If you’re symptomatic, you shouldn’t be in public at all. 

PPE is different and includes more things than just a mask. Face shields, double mask, goggles, gloves, etc. 

If you come in contact with someone who has covid, simply wearing a mask isn’t going to drastically reduce your chances of catching it. 

“After 1 month, 42 people out of 2,392 in the group that wore masks, or 1.8%, developed a COVID-19 infection, compared to 53 people out of 2,470 in the group that didn’t wear masks, or 2.1%.”

https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20201119/how-much-does-wearing-a-mask-protect-you

So it’s about a 16% reduction in infections in people who said they wore their masks.

And because you were at the same restaurant, you get in a car crash 2 weeks later. And then your friends and family all get in car accidents over the following weeks.

3. I haven't found any long term effects possible after injection, as the vaccines have simply not been out long enough for those data to exist. Lack of data is not a sufficient basis to make any conclusions of long-term safety/efficacy.

Oregon has had COVID well controlled during the whole pandemic, so their effective seropositive rate is actually lower than almost any other state even with high rates of vaccination. 

For example, Alabama only has a 32% first doses (all residents) but they have had about 43% of their population infected with COVID (assuming a 4X undercount rate). Oregon has had less than 18% of their population infected and 44% first doses. 

Assuming COVID infection does not impact likelihood to vaccinate (it probably does with a negative correlation), this means that Alabama has (32%)+(68%\*43%)=**61%** of their population with antibodies. Oregon has (44%)+(56%\*18%)=**54%** of their population with antibodies. And this ignores the likely negative correlation between infection and vaccination and the two week lag before the first dose has any effect, and that first dose immunity is not as strong as immunity created from actual infection.

One of the cool things about my vaccine site was they kept it really cheeky and casual. It was at a basketball arena at a local state school, and there were many volunteers with pom-poms, a life size cutout of Dr. Fauci, alt rock music and a video screen playing, and there was just so much smiling going on. The waiting was pretty much non-existent, they moved you so quickly that you weren't thinking about it at all. I've seen plenty of pictures from other vaccination sites, and I see they weren't all like that.

In addition, you only ever hear from the people who had severe symptoms from the vaccine, and you see non-stop coverage about the literally fewer than one in million blood clots in one type of vaccine (which are treatable, by the way, and not automatically fatal). When people ask on Facebook how the vaccine was, the people who respond all had 104 fevers for three days. But when you ask people individually how the vaccine was, most of them say that it was no big deal. It's just there's so much amplification of negativity, and I don't know how we change that.

There are some people who like to know about even the one in a million chance of something happening, and then are able to rationalize it as a risk worth taking vs. the alternative (taking your chances with the disease and contributing to its spread). But there are people who really are best off not hearing about the one in a million chance over and over again.

I know it's a gross simplification to talk about the power of positive thinking with regards to people's anxieties, but a general positive vibe surrounding vaccination and what it's doing for all of us would be a really fine thing, wouldn't it?

We are told that ""anecdotes are not data.""  But what do these articles invariably start with?  An anecdote.  A very very carefully selected anecdote.  Only how pray tell is a very busy journalist supposed to will on the spot an anecdote that precisely fits the narrative?  No wonder some of these anecdotes turn out to be fabrications.

There is alleged vaccine hesitancy.  Only two facts immediately refute such an idea.  Even the article can't claim the elderly are refusing the vaccine in any significant numbers.  So why aren't they, the least technologically sophisticated, even more vulnerable to being influenced by social media posts by their friends?  Also for all the claims that there are open spots for doses that are not being used, if you ask any of the authorities involved in distributing and administering doses, they will all assert that there is almost no wastage.  No wastage means there is no significant vaccine hesitancy.

Then how can one explain the supposed data in the article that relatively high percentages of frontline workers are refusing to be vaccinated **at this moment**.  There is an obvious explanation -- because many of them have already had COVID-19.  They are simply waiting for additional data to show that getting vaccinated on top of whatever natural immunity they have will help them and not have some unintended side effect.

But that brings us back to the deceptiveness and the manipulation of the anecdote chosen for the story.

Looking at the U.K., we have almost complete vaccine cover for seniors but only 1 dose for most by last month. Cases have fallen 96% (mostly due to lockdown) and deaths 98% so deaths/cases have halved, and that’s only one dose. (Plus there’s a lag factor I haven’t accounted for here as cases have fallen again in the last month, it’s probably nearer a third)

By like the fourth or fifth time it just became normal again. Start small. Go to stores on off hours. Eat outside if you can and just build yourself up. 

A good way to calm yourself is to estimate the high end risk of infection. Take number of cases in your state. Multiply by 2 for unreported cases and multiply by 10 for days where they are infectious (this over estimates because most people aren’t infectious that long and a good percent probably won’t be out and about). Divide this by state population and multiply by 100 which is your odds of any person in public having covid. Now take the context your in like say restaurant capacity and multiply by number of people there. Then you can assume probably about a 20 percent attack rate and 95 percent efficacy which means you should divide that risk by 5 and 20. So for example in NJ right now.

2000 cases daily. Multiply by 2 so 4000 cases daily accounting for unreported/untested. Multiply by 10 day window of infectiousness so 40,000 cases daily. I think it’s fair to assume at least half the people will be home and you could probably assume even higher but let’s estimate worse case scenario. That’s 20,000 people out 9 million or about 0.2 percent. Now lets say in a midsized restaurant there are 100 people but people actually reasonably close to you are probably closer to like 20. So 0.2 percent multiplied by 20 is 4 percent. But there is only about a 20 percent attack rate so that 4 percent drops to 0.8 percent and then 95 percent efficacy means it drops 0.04% chance of contracting covid for most restaurant experiences. Keep in mind too I way overestimated this risk. Like on average more than 50 percent of people will naturally be at home and a lot of those people will be quarantined because they tested positive or they’re not feeling good.

Seemingly not. 

[Here’s what to do if you get covid-19 between vaccine doses](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2021/04/30/covid-infection-between-doses/)

&gt;	Health experts said that people who contract covid-19 in the middle of their vaccine series should still get the second dose, because the immune response from natural infection is so variable. But depending on when in the process individuals get sick, they may need to postpone it.

&gt;	The CDC recommends that people with mild to moderate infection isolate for at least 10 days after the onset of symptoms or until they have recovered and at least 24 hours after being fever-free.

&gt;So those who get covid-19 within the first week or so after their first dose may be fine to get the second dose on time, assuming they have complied with the recommendations. The second dose of the mRNA vaccines is supposed to be given 21 days after the first dose for Pfizer and 28 days for Moderna.

&gt;Those who start experiencing symptoms less than 10 days before the shot should reschedule.

The link says the core of his argument is this vaccine doesn't limit transmission, but that's not the meat of it and even if a vaccinated person doesn't shed virus, which they do, but if they didn't, his concerns are still worth thinking through. 

Secondly, the bulk of the citations and evidence are of very different situations.

I'm in Toronto, Ontario. I'm not frantically booking appointments to snag the vaccine that I want, so I'm not wasting slots. I wear my mask, work from home, see no friends/family, wash my hands, and am mindful of cross contamination.

I'm not anti-vax. I get my flu-shot every year.

In just a few weeks, most, if not all, people in Ontario ages 18 and over can get vaccinated with Pifzer/Moderna through the government booking system.

I got some comment downvoted badly and removed in my local subreddit for asking what vaccine was being offered at a mobile hotspot. I'm in my 20s and would prefer not to get AstraZeneca.

People said that I could be slowing down the vaccine rollout. But in Ontario, the plan was already determined at the start of the rollout and hasn't slowed down -- it has actually sped up not just due to demand, but also due to increase supply of Pfizer.

I don't want to downplay the seriousness of COVID-19, but if the pandemic was more urgent, and if it wasn't that safe to just stay at home, I would certainly be more inclined to take whatever vaccine is available.

The option to wait a few weeks for a more widely used vaccine just doesn't seem so bad to me.
