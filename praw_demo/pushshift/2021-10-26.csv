She said since the dosage is so small for the 5-11s that they would expect to get 10 vaccinations out of one vial, which meant she thought that it was more likely we would have luck at a higher volume hospital/clinic/pharmacy because if patient volume is low at a smaller office like hers, they'd end up wasting a lot of vaccine if they couldn't have all 10 tiny doses accounted for, which she didn't think was going to be the case for her particular office.

So I suppose it depends on your area, the population, level of vaccination uptake, etc but it might be a better bet to look outside your pediatrician's office for vaccine availability once it's officially been ok'd.

Almost every district around us doesn't have a mask mandate, our family (unfortunately, and we can't move) lives in a place where people don't care about mask mandates or even do much to try and keep this at bay. We live in a smallish town in Texas. You can imagine vaccination rates. No one wears masks in stores. Huge gatherings.

For whatever reason, and despite several protesting parents, some that threatened and had to be escorted by police and went kicking and screaming, and much debate our school board decided to vote have a mask mandate. 

If there wasn't one, because of the other lackadaisical actions of people around us, I was honestly going to pull my kids out. 

Our district has consistently had much fewer cases than the ones around us. We all shop at the same stores and go to the same gas stations, go to the same churches etc., but our schools have much fewer cases. We actually made the local news because schools were closing all around us because of cases all the time, but ours didn't. 

Yes, we've had cases, but not even close to the amount that other districts near us, some only streets away, have.

I got moderna booster and flu shot on Sunday, 10/24. I got JJ in march.

Up until now my only side effects were VERY sore shoulders, slight headaches, slight fatigue. very manageable. 

shoulders improved greatly day to day. on Monday, one day post shots, I could hardly lift my arms over my head. IDK why I get this so bad, my gf thinks its because im muscular but she could be buttering me up 

yesterday I noticed three small red spots on my flu shot arm. tiny bit raised, not itchy. 

This morning, they were much more raised, a little itchy when scratched, and looked similar to the ""measles-like"" reaction some people get from covid shots. However I only have three and its not all-body. 

I put some rubbing alc on them, left them alone and they look better actually. I am considering putting some hydrocortisone acetate 2.5%\pramoxine hcl 1% cream on them (left over from a hemorrhoid).

The last one is super open ended and more or less self determined so you just check ""high risk"" and that is it.

Then it lists some occupation as examples followed with ""This list does not include all potential occupations where a worker could have an increased risk for exposure.""

An endemic virus is one that doesn't go away. [From the journal Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00396-2),

&gt; In January, Nature asked more than 100 immunologists, infectious-disease researchers and virologists working on the coronavirus whether it could be eradicated. Almost 90% of respondents think that the coronavirus will become endemic — meaning that it will continue to circulate in pockets of the global population for years to come (see 'Endemic future').

If it wasn't clear in February, I'd say it's clear now. *Nature* goes on,

&gt; Influenza and the four human coronaviruses that cause common colds are also endemic: but a combination of annual vaccines and acquired immunity means that societies tolerate the seasonal deaths and illnesses they bring without requiring lockdowns, masks and social distancing.

I'd say that's about where we are.

With endemic viruses, there's little to be done collectively. We're not all going to take collective action indefinitely. If you want to avoid being in the ICU, *and you should*, get the vaccine. If you're still worried after being vaccinated, wear an N95 mask and it doesn't much matter whether anyone else is wearing theirs; unlike these cloth masks, an N95 affirmatively protects the wearer.

&gt;The seven-day average of infections stood at about 69,000 this week, figures show, reflecting a 58 percent drop from the latest surge’s peak around Sept. 13, when the average for that week was 164,475.

&gt;The impact of vaccinations is clear in regions with the highest uptake. Puerto Rico recorded a seven-day average of 1,121 new cases on Aug. 23 as it wrestled with delta; that figure had declined to 105 as of Tuesday. About 73 percent of Puerto Ricans are immunized.

&gt;But a handful of states are still struggling to turn the tide, especially as colder weather brings more people indoors again. In Montana, 45 out of every 100,000 people are hospitalized due to covid-19 — the highest rate in the country. Just over half the state’s population is fully vaccinated — below the national rate of 57.5 percent. Colorado, Michigan, New Mexico, Utah and Vermont have not yet stemmed the initial increases in cases and deaths triggered by the delta variant surge.

&gt;A physician, medical examiner or coroner fills out the cause of mortality on the death certificate. That specialist is instructed to include only conditions that caused or contributed to death, Anderson says. One field lists the sequence of events leading to the death. “What we're really trying to get at is the condition or disease that started the chain of events leading to the death,” Anderson says. “For COVID-19, that might be something like acute respiratory distress due to pneumonia due to COVID-19.” A second part of the certificate lists other conditions that may have contributed to the death yet were not part of the sequence of events that led up to it, he says. These are called comorbidities, and although they can be contributing factors, they cannot be directly involved in the chain of cause and effect that ended in death. Medical conditions such as diabetes or heart disease are common comorbidities, and they can make a person more vulnerable to the coronavirus, Anderson says, “but the fact is: they're not dying from that preexisting condition.”

&gt;“When we ask if COVID killed somebody, it means ‘Did they die sooner than they would have if they didn't have the virus?’” Lessler says.

But the scientific seal of approval is still critical: It makes millions of people eligible for booster shots based on their mental health diagnosis alone and gives vulnerable groups more reason to protect themselves.

&gt;”This is a population that is really, really at risk due to the way that covid-19 interacts with the diagnoses,” said Lisa Dailey, executive director of the Treatment Advocacy Center. “Until the CDC put this group of disorders on their list, they would not have known that.”

&gt;The CDC on Oct. 14 added “mental health conditions” to a long list of mostly physical conditions that make someone likely to be hospitalized, need a ventilator or die of the coronavirus, including cancer, diabetes and obesity.

&gt;The change means it is important for people with “mood disorders, including depression, and schizophrenia spectrum disorders” to get vaccinated — with initial doses and boosters — and take preventive measures, such as masking, social distancing and hand-washing, according to the CDC.

&gt;Public health experts say these precautions are critical for people who are older or have multiple conditions on the list, which is not intended to be comprehensive and has been updated frequently throughout the pandemic.

They are at this point pretty interchangeable. I'd say moderna is slightly ahead... Except they threw us a real curve ball with the booster being a half size dose now, and there being a real possibility that the only reason moderna is better than Pfizer is because moderna was such a huge honkin shot.

So with all that taken into account, if you got moderna or Pfizer for all your shots up until now, and you've been relatively happy with the side effects you got, and the shot you got has kept you from getting covid and dying, then there's zero reason to change the game.   

Don't anecdotal evidence logical fallacy at me.  When you have two different shots from two different companies that science has basically told us are both really really really good, then often the best evidence you have is how those shots have behaved when you have put them into your own personal body and those shots have interacted with your own personal immune system.

If I read it correctly it really depends on the total amount of cases. If the overall cases drop then the side effects will rise. 

I'm pretty sure my kids got it (we only had my wife tested and she was positive). We don't truly know long term effects on children just because it hasn't been around very long. It's the same thing for the vaccine. We don't truly know if there are other side effects because it hasn't been around long enough. Literally everything we know can change as the days/months/ years path. I like that there is hesitation to not instantly approve something like this. With all the comments I read here on reddit I see a huge percentage of people that would jump at the chance even with the Emergency Use Action.

The doctor in question at the medical centre even said that she was hesitant to vaccinate her own son with Pfizer after seeing the vaccination injuries occurring in young males. It is a very large clinic with multiple doctors and hundreds of patients. The group we have been in touch with has many young men who have had a similar reaction. The 'fanaticism' of the debate is concerning. People making death threats to anyone who speaks out about Pfizer vaccine injuries in young males is happening. Today Noam Chomsky has said that vaccine hesitant people should be forcibly held down and vaccinated against their will. Lets have a more open and nuanced stance and try to find out if any other young men have also experienced problems with the Pfizer vaccination. I would love to hear from them.

https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/organ-transplant-recipients-remain-vulnerable-to-covid-19-even-after-second-vaccine-dose



About organ transplant recipients (who require immunosuppressants to live), 46% show no detectable antibodies after dose 2. 

&gt;In the most recent study, the researchers found that only 98 of the 658 study participants — 15% — had detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at 21 days after the first vaccine dose. This was comparable to the 17% reported in the March study looking at immune response after only one vaccine dose. Pretty rare for you to qualify for this

&gt;At 29 days following the second dose, the number of participants with detectable antibodies rose to 357 out of 658 — 54%. After both vaccine doses were administered, 301 out of 658 participants — 46% — had no detectable antibody at all while 259 — 39% — only produced antibodies after the second shot.

They also won't get ""sick"" since everything is just based on the natural response to something foreign in the body and not something that is physically attacking or harming your cells such as poison/venom, a virus that destroys cells by replicating itself, or a bacteria that excretes toxins AND THEN your body tries to get rid of it making you feel worse. So pretty much at worse they feel kinda bad for a few days but nothing physically harmful...again that is if their body actually responds properly instead of doing nothing.

The UK (which is being, in general, quite cautious about who is issued a booster -- vulnerable groups only) is also doing this. It sounds like a similar approach to the CDC recommendation that the OP has linked in the comments.

[You can read the evidence given for it here.](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/jcvi-issues-advice-on-third-dose-vaccination-for-severely-immunosuppressed)

Here, most vulnerable people (including, but not limited to: over 50s; people with diabetes or severe respiratory or heart problems; on lower-dose immunosuppressants) are eligible for **one booster of an mRNA vaccine 6 months after our second dose**. (I, due to getting slightly unlucky in the genetic lottery, am in this group).

People who are more severely immunosuppressed (including, but not limited to: on higher-dose immunosuppressants; received a stem-cell transplant; recent organ transplant recipients; have leukaemia) are eligible for **one 'third primary dose' 8 weeks after their second dose. 6 months after that, they get one booster**. 

This is because there is [some evidence from a reasonably hefty trial](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/news/octave-trial-initial-data-on-vaccine-responses-in-patients-with-impaired-immune-systems/28529) that about 40% of people who are more severely immunosuppressed have a much smaller immune response to the first two doses than *either* people who are low-risk, or who are (like me) just bog-standard high-risk. 

The third primary dose seems to help 'catch up' their antibody levels to about what everyone else's are after two doses, and then the booster after 6 months is more likely to work *as an actual booster* on them.

The people who are going to be imminently eligible for a fourth dose are *the* most vulnerable people to COVID. They're the ones who rolled a natural 1 in constitution. They're not only more likely to die if they get it, they are far more likely to catch it in the first place, since many of them had minimal antibodies even when their vaccines were fresh. This is an attempt to bring their level of protection up to speed with everyone else's.  

It is mildly infuriating to see people in the comments here suggesting this is some sort of pharmaceutical scam, when statistically it will apply to very few people (including me, a high-risk person). I would like my colleague who has had a kidney transplant, and my cousin who was on a bunch of steroids when she got her second dose, to have comparable protection to mine, thanks.",,,,1635342347,{},hi8vnpp,False,t3_qgn69x,False,True,t3_qgn69x,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qgn69x/immunocompromised_may_need_a_fourth_covid19_shot/hi8vnpp/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,False,3dd7577d84b34c658291bafee7df439b9352f58c,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1635342364.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

No evidence this is needed or going to happen for the general population.  Your memory B/T cells are long lasting and protect against severe disesase.  We don't know how long those last, but it is more than 6 months.  At that point--given that you won't be taking up a hospital bed--it can be an individual choice whether to get boosted or not.

A single booster--what we are doing right now for many people (effectively anyone who wants one, given the criteria)--is also easily justified.  The three/four week spacing for the first two doses is very non-standard and was chosen to speed up the trials, not for any scientific reason.  It is very likely (especially in light of data from countries that extended the spacing out of necesity) that a larger spacing gives a more durable response.  Hence, a third shot after 6 months.  We will see what this does.  It is very possible that the immune response will be long lasting enough that boosters can be spaced every couple of years, possibly more in response to variants than waning.

In any case, I don't see why boosters are a big deal.  They take basically no time at all and they barely hurt.

Since mandates for this age group aren't even really being widely discussed I don't that think that's going to be a factor in the near term.

We do have historical data to make some educated guesses about what might happen.

Ultimately it took nearly 3 months to go from the EUA being granted to having 30% of 12-15 year-olds vaccinated. So you are right, people were bad at predicting what they'd do, far fewer parents actually got their kid vaccinated immediately despite what they said in the poll.

**Study Title:** Caregiver’s willingness to vaccinate against Coronavirus and motivated helplessness 

**Study Description:** Link to pre-registration:  https://aspredicted.org/49H_GK6 

This study is related to a new theory called “motivated helplessness” and is focused on the potential protective psychological effects of feeling helplessness in reducing fear and anxiety. In this study, we wanted to examine how the extent to which people think they have a choice to vaccinate their children will affect the degree of anxiety people feel towards vaccinating their children as well as how these affect people’s willingness to vaccinate their children. The hypothesis of the study is that the more people perceive that they have no choice but to vaccinate their children, the lower the levels of anxiety related to the vaccine and its health consequences. In addition, we hypothesized that the more people perceive that they have no choice but to vaccinate their children and the lower the degree of anxiety they exhibit about vaccinating their children, the more willing they will express to vaccinate their children. To examine this question, participants filled out questionnaires about the degree of choice/lack of control they have in vaccinating their children, questionnaire about the consequences of the vaccine, a questionnaire examining the concept of vaccine effectiveness and additional demographics questions. Participants may be parents of children from any country.

**Study Title:** The PATCH (Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19 with hydroxychloroquine) trial

**Study Description:** The purpose of this study is to evaluate various doses of hydroxychloroquine in treatment (vs. placebo) for COVID-19 in patients in self-isolation at home and in those who are hospitalized. Additionally, an arm investigates the ability of hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19 in high-exposure healthcare workers. **We are recruiting adults aged 40+ within 30 miles of the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania who are experiencing fever and cough or fever and shortness of breath who have not yet been tested for COVID-19.** Participation is voluntary and involves maintaining a daily symptom diary, self-reporting temperature checks, and receiving daily phone calls from the study team.

Also the size of this country is huge in comparison to the UK. And there are densely populated areas here, while others are very rural. In more densely populated areas, even thou there r more hospitals, they fill quicker. And in rural areas, there are fewer hospitals and it can take hours to get to some depending where u live. So there r multiple factors to why it is so different in this country compared to others. Not just obesity, or health issues.

Also we have horrible food, if u buy organic it costs way more, and most cannot afford to be selective with their food choices due to income level or lack of understanding. Also we have high fructose corn syrup in everything, or sugar is found in almost everything we buy, and that is a main cause of inflammation, which covid causes. So realistically, we r eating ourselves to death, regardless of covid, but in general.  Cancer, autoimmune diseases, and a ton of other diseases are fueled by sugar, they survive and thrive because of it. But we continue to eat it without concern.  

(Sorry nutrition means so much to me, my son taught me about it all, and he’s healthier than I’ll ever be. But I keep trying for him.

**Study Title:** Center for Innovation COVID-19 Survey

**Study Description:** The Center for Innovation seeks to utilize this unique moment in history to study issues related to public information integrity and trust, along with access to medical needs and opportunistic industry behaviors in a pandemic. This research is designed to analyze the events and ultimately provide lessons that can strengthen both governmental responses and the institutions responsible for public health and safety. In particular, commentators are suggesting that economic, social, and political characteristics of the nation may change substantially as a result of Covid-19. This study seeks to create effective recommendations for policymakers as these changes occur. Previous studies have documented the important role of trust in institutions when attempting to translate institutional policy into ground level action, and this study seeks to expand and build on this work through surveys examining micro levels of trust in various institutions and public health responses. This research will then seek to place this micro data into the context of institutional responses to the pandemic. **Anyone living in the United States who has reached the age of majority can participate in this study. Note that you will be expected to be able to respond to questions in English.**

CURE-19 is a dedicated platform for running at-home COVID-19 clinical trials. **Via CURE-19, any patient in the United States, no matter where they live, can sign up for the platform and start participating in our studies right at home.** There is no travel needed, and patients can be part of driving scientific discoveries, get free genomic and microbiome testing.

**The registry is intended to give researchers data on real-world disease progression, treatment, and healthcare utilization data for COVID-19.** This data closes the gap in what is publicly available today, which lacks information about patients prior to testing positive, and how they are treated, such as with off-label prescriptions and various bedside techniques.

Could you tell me where you got your numbers for everyone else/ immunocompromised people? I'm sorry, but it sounds like you made up the numbers-- which makes the opinions you have built in false information. So your conclusion doesn't hold up as well as you'd like. 

It's true if you're vaccinated, you are less likely to have Covid. But you can still get it, especially to new variants. That means that you could easily infect someone else by accident. 

It's also not just duration that causes infection. It's the amount of airflow, if people are talking or shouting, if you're indoors or outdoors. Also for example, if you sneeze, [the intensity of your sneeze](https://youtu.be/9qqHOKUXY5U) could send particles far across a space and easily infect others. And since sneezes travel 75 miles per hour, it spreads particles into the air quite intensely. So if you're maskless, you could easily walk into a space where someone has sneezed covid particles and not know it.

TL;DR version of article: threshold was accepted half a century ago as 5 microns (smaller than 5 microns = aerosol which is airborne since it stays in air a long time, larger = droplet that falls to ground quickly). COVID-19 was around 40 microns, therefore it ""had to be"" carried by droplet, which falls to ground within 1-2m... guess what, precisely the distance we were told to keep away from others.

Based on that, it was infection via surfaces (fomites) and you wouldn't need masks if you kept that distance and washed your hands all the time, so messaging was ""masks don't work"" and/or ""save masks for frontline workers"" who obviously can't maintain that distance.

The problem was, that size threshold was specific to how tuberculosis spread, and how it couldn't effectively infect if inhaled via more coarse mist larger than 5 microns. This was misinterpreted to mean *all* aerosol transmission maxed out at 5 microns, even though that study itself was based on research suggesting the threshold was closer to 100 microns.

It's important to separate data which clearly supports something from correlations that occur under different conditions.  IOW, the data is clearly in that supports vaccinations reducing infections and transmissions (as well as hospitalizations and deaths).

However, that's independent of what might be observed if we cherry-pick data from elsewhere while ignoring causation-correlation.

Singapore had very strict pandemic measures.  It's an extremely different culture than here in the US.  As such, there were relatively few cases.  Even with the current spike, there have only been 329 deaths and less than 30K cases per million.  This compares to about 140K cases per million for the US.

So... to date, Singapore has been strict and had relatively far fewer cases and deaths.

Along comes the vaccine.  Singapore isn't the most vaccinated country but it's in the top 10 (I believe at #6) in terms of doses per 100 people.  It's doing great with vaccines, but it's still at about 80% fully vaccinated (of eligible).

Singapore lifted restrictions on masks, social distancing, venue capacities, etc...

So now you have Delta, and relatively very few with natural immunity and 20% still not vaccinated (plus those not eligible yet) while people fully returned to pre-2020 behavior.

Also consider this from Reuters:

*Of Singapore's 1,096 locally transmitted infections in the last 28 days, 484, or about 44%, were in fully vaccinated people, while 30% were partially vaccinated and just over 25% were unvaccinated, Thursday's data showed. While seven cases of serious illness required oxygen, and another was in critical condition in intensive care, none of the eight had been fully vaccinated, the health ministry said.*

Considering that 80% are fully vaccinated, the thought that only 44% of cases were fully vaccinated may seem misleading, but remember that as vaccination approaches 100%, the percentage of breakthroughs will as well, and of course the outcomes show a very significant difference.",,,,1635288319,{},hi6c1de,False,t3_qgcxsa,False,False,t1_hi5t9p0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qgcxsa/united_says_vaccinated_pilots_and_flight/hi6c1de/,1635452454.0,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's not exact because they use different groupings, but it looks like about 0.4% of kids with COVID get hospitalized. Another way to approximate that is to use the [case surveillance data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data-with-Ge/n8mc-b4w4)... I get about 0.5% hospitalized recently. Anyway, take a 37 per 100k, multiply by the 62 million 5-19 year olds in the country, multiply by 0.4%, and it's 91.

I'll help you.

Let's pick the number 25 (per capita) because on the graph, that is where the 3 colored lines are closest together, before the growth we see in the graph begins. 

25^1 is where that is, in mathematical notation, which means 25 to the first power, which equals exactly 25.

For this to be ""exponential"" growth, the chart would have to show 25^2, or 25 to the *second power*, which equals exactly 625. 

Instead, the chart shows numbers at maximum about 85 or 90, and that's being generous.

When designing experiments it is important to have groups which rule out confounding factors, in case of looking for immune response, that means excluding people who have had covid at some point and therefore their immune system may be primed.

If the official phase study included children who already had covid at some point, the observed effectiveness of the vaccine may be inaccurate, which means it probably won't pass peer review. 

Research is expensive and time consuming, I have no doubt that somebody is looking at effectiveness of vaccine for children who had covid at some point, but it is probably difficult to first get volunteers who have the prerequisite paperwork that details when they caught covid, which specific strain, how long were they infected, and regular antibody test results following their fight against covid.

Amazingly, these memory B cells will actually produce antibodies adapted against the COVID variants if they see a variant in the future, rather than the original antibodies directed against the ancestral strain. This is because memory B cells serve as a blueprint to make antibodies, like the blueprint of a house. If a house needs an extra column (or antibodies need to evolve to work against variants), the blueprint will oblige just as memory B cells will!

There was a protest a hundred yards from my office door with about 300 people.

I'd guess about a third of the people in attendance were close to retirement age males, with the balance being age representative of staff members at the laboratory.

The conversations then and in later days to the organizer for the event, I got the book of Revelations quoted to me six times, someone who un ironically told me about chips in the vaccine.

By the estimates of some of the more sane organizers of the event, roughly half of the vaccine refusers have already had a proven diagnosed case of covid. 

Now I'm fully vaxxed and will definitely be getting a booster hopefully today, but as a rational analysis, having a provable prior covid infection is way more protective than any vaccine combination.

This requirement also applied to remote only workers who never set foot on lab property.

This isn't about protecting the workforce, this is about bend the knee, kiss the Ring. 

The thing that's probably going to get the lab to lose at least portions of the various lawsuits, is that they solicited applications for medical or religious exemptions, then granted some of them, and then place those people on unpaid leave. Unpaid leave at this laboratory means that you're automatically terminated after 30 days.

The Judge was not impressed.

I personally believe that religious exemptions are bullshit and shouldn't be allowed. But there are people with legitimate medical exemptions and they're being fired as well.

I'm fully of the mind that private employers are well within the rights to require vaccination for continued employment.

**Study Title:** Early Predictors and Longitudinal Course of Covid-19 Related Grief: A Longitudinal Online Study

**Study Description:** The Complicated Grief Program at Massachusetts General Hospital is conducting a research study related to grief following the death of a loved one to COVID-19. We understand that this is a very difficult time for those who have lost loved ones to COVID-19 and offer our condolences.

By participating in a brief internet-based survey research study, you can contribute to understanding the impact of losing a loved one to COVID-19 to better address the needs of those who are grieving.

We invite interested participants to complete now an online survey about the circumstances of the death and your experience of bereavement that will take less than 30 minutes. In addition, we will send you follow-up surveys that will take about 15 minutes to complete, up to 8 times over the course of the next two years. **Adults aged 18 or older living in the United States, who has lost a loved one to Covid-19 in the past 24 months (according to their report), with Internet access and minimal reading skills will be eligible to participate.**

**Study Title:** COVID-Cog: Cognitive Outcomes after COVID-19 Infection

**Study Description:** There is an urgent need to understand the neurocognitive impact of COVID-19. As there are millions of people globally surviving COVID-19 there are key questions remain: does COVID-19 infection result in significant cognitive impairment? Is the burden of cognitive impairment greater in those who require ICU stay vs. those hospitalized outside the ICU vs. those in the community?  And are there interactions with sex, age and medical risk factors that result in greater impact in some populations? To answer these questions, we need thousands of people from around the world, who have tested positive at some point for COVID-19, to participate in our study. The study itself consists of a survey that asks questions about COVID history, demographics, lifestyle, and general health, followed by a series of online games that measure different aspects of cognitive functioning; altogether, this takes less than 1 hour. We will also invite participants to complete the study again after 3 and 12 months, to examine how COVID-related impacts on cognition and general health change over time. **Individuals who have had a confirmed positive test for COVID-19, are over 18 years of age, and are fluent in English, French, or Spanish are invited to participate.**

**Study Title:** Coronagenes – An international population cohort to investigate genetic susceptibility to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)

**Study Description:** Data from popular home genetic-testing kits could help scientists shed light on why some people who catch coronavirus have no symptoms while others become very ill. **Researchers are asking people from around the world who have used DNA testing services – such as Ancestry DNA, FTDNA and 23andMe – to gain ancestry or health insights to join a study that aims to identify key genes involved in the body’s response to the infection.**

Understanding the effect genes have on susceptibility to Covid-19 could aid efforts to tackle the pandemic, and help combat future disease outbreaks, researchers say. More than 30 million people worldwide have used genetic testing services. Researchers are urging them to share their DNA data to help speed up discoveries that could help fight the virus.

By providing these data, volunteers will help the team avoid the costly, time-consuming task of collecting the hundreds of thousands of DNA samples that would otherwise be needed to map the genes involved. Volunteers who have not used these services will also be able to provide the project with DNA, once current lockdown restrictions have been eased.

The team aims to identify genes that influence the risk of developing Covid-19 and those that affect disease severity, by comparing volunteers’ symptoms – or lack of them – with their DNA.

Those taking part in the University of Edinburgh study – called Coronagenes – will complete online questionnaires about their health, lifestyle and any symptoms they have experienced, such as fever or a persistent cough.

Updating the survey before, during and after an infection will help scientists detect any patterns that might indicate how the virus progresses.

Researchers also aim to analyse the long-term health consequences of infection and self-isolation.

**Study Description:** While there was a necessary initial focus on physical health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is becoming increasingly clear that many have experienced significant social and mental health repercussions as well. Investigators at Boston College initiated a daily survey study in mid-March to better understand the impacts of COVID-19 and the culture of living though a pandemic. They hope to not only reveal new information about potential risk and protective factors regarding COVID-19, but also hope to better understand how many of the large-scale measures being taken will impact us as individuals and a society. **We are seeking all adults (18+) regardless of whether they have been diagnosed with COVID-19.** With over 1,900 individuals already enrolled in the study with representation from 60 different countries across 6 continents and 20 different time zones, we are re-opening enrollment for continued assessments to get as comprehensive and diverse a look as we can at the global impact of COVID19 on sleep, mental health, and well-being.

**Study Description:** The world is suffering from a pandemic called COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The different national governments have problems evaluating the reach of the epidemic, having limited resources and tests to their disposal. Hence, any means to monitor the number of persons with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 with reasonable level of accuracy is useful. The objective of this study is the collection and publication of data concerning the number of people that show symptoms compatible with COVID-19 in different countries. This data is useful to estimate the number of infected persons with the COVID-19 virus at a given point in time in these countries, and the evolution of this number over time, using techniques like the Network Scale-up Method.

**Study Title:** Coronavirus and Autism Behavioral Study (CABS)

**Study Description:** Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may be potentially vulnerable to the effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. We are conducting a national study on the impact of the coronavirus on children with autism spectrum disorder and their families, with a particular interest in demographics and diversity. Broadly, we want to track the development of children with autism throughout the quarantine period of the pandemic, and learn about the emotional wellbeing and structure of the family during this time. Results from this study are hoped to help clinicians and practitioners improve treatments and services over time, supporting educational, behavioral, and social health in both children with autism and their families. Having a greater understanding of the development of children with autism following a pandemic should benefit care and enhance success in meeting the needs of these patients and their surrounding community.

**This study might be a good fit if you:**

No the number certainly doesn't seem insignificant to me but you have to extrapolate it over two years and be a realist about things.  367 children dying over a two year period is miniscule.  Compare this number to any other disease and it's peanuts.

Where I believe we differ is on the potential side effects of the vaccine.  The VAERYS numbers tell a large story.  Sure not everyone of those reported numbers may actually be associated with the vaccine, but we all know the COVID numbers themselves are greatly exaggerated as well with many, many deaths being grouped in simply because they contracted COVID while lying in their death bed with a terminal diagnosis.

In the video the FDA released yesterday they themselves even admitted on tape that they do NOT know the potential long term side effects of the vaccine on children and we will only know after we start administering it.  That's blatant evidence to me of the fact that they're simply willing to experiment on children.  I am certainly NOT.

A virus that already has a 99.7% survival rate, coupled with the very low total death count number of 367, does not justify us experimenting on children with an mRNA vaccine.  The creator of the mRNA technology itself says we shouldn't even be using it on human beings.

**Study Title:** Probiotics To Eliminate COVID-19 Transmission in Exposed Household Contacts (PROTECT-EHC)

**Study Description:** The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and the effect of COVID-19 on the microbiome (the microorganisms that live in and on the human body) in exposed household contacts of COVID-19. Exposed household contacts (EHC) are people who live with someone with COVID-19  and therefore have an increased chance of contracting the virus. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, meaning subjects will be randomly assigned to receive LGG or a placebo (an inactive substance given in the same form as the active substance) and will not know which product they are receiving. Participation in this study entails taking LGG/placebo for 28 days, responding to questionnaires, and providing stool and nasal swab samples. 

**To participate, individuals must be asymptomatic, at least 1 year old, live with a household contact who has tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within the previous 3 days, and be willing to stop taking any current probiotics/not take any other probiotics while on the study.**

&gt;Children ages 5 to 11 may be eligible for the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid vaccine by early next month: two shots spaced three weeks apart. But unlike kids 12 and older, who get the same dosage as adults, the kids in the younger age group will receive 10 micrograms of vaccine per dose, or one-third the amount that a 12-year-old would get.

&gt;This has created some confusion for parents of 11-year-olds on the cusp of turning 12. Is it best to hold out for the larger dose? Or is it better to get the smaller dose right away? Does the weight or height of the child make any difference?

&gt;Five experts in immunology and infectious diseases agreed: The appropriate dosage is best determined by a child’s age — not their size. So if your 11-year-old is able to get the shot starting in November, do it right away rather than waiting for your child to turn 12.

&gt;The virus isn’t going away anytime soon, they said. And different variants could potentially make the virus more infectious or dangerous, said Donna L. Farber, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.

We significantly flattened the curve on Delta, leading to a high plateau that's now steadily rising again as the weather gets colder.  Note that only 0.15% of Colorado has died to Covid, much lower than the national average and that of many other states that had a large Delta wave that's now over.  But if you compare to places that suppressed their Delta wave, I would assume they will need a lot more vaccinations or cases will rise soon.  Third doses and 5-11 vaccination can certainly end the pandemic even if no additional republicans get them.

There is a correlation by region, but it's not entirely promising.  Denver and Boulder are very highly educated and vaccinated, and case rates are much lower there - but they're still rising at about the same rate.  Colorado Springs, Fort Collins, and Grand Junction are far more conservative and under-vaccinated; they account for the large majority of hospitalizations (which are at a critical level) and have higher case rates overall.  But again, the rate of growth is similar between the two regions.

Colorado is now asking the general population to get third doses at 6 months, basically using the vagueness of the occupation qualification for the booster EUA.  But only 5% of the population has gotten them so far (over the next 6 weeks the 6-month eligibility will be reached for a lot more people).",,,,1635355032,{},hi9qhdd,False,t3_qgqofi,False,True,t1_hi9oso1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qgqofi/daily_discussion_thread_october_27_2021/hi9qhdd/,1635518528.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

**Study Title:** How Does Background Noise Affect Hearing?

**Study Description:** Researchers at the UW are looking at how children learn to hear sounds like speech and music in noisy real-world environments, such as classrooms or playgrounds. *We are hoping to recruit children between the ages of 4 and 18 years of age who wear hearing aids, and also who do not wear hearing aids.* We have two options of studies: 

1. In-person study, taking place at the University of Washington Virginia Bloedel Research Center. Your child would come into the lab for an EEG recording and be asked to complete various listening tasks.

2. Online study (via Zoom). Your child will be asked to do online listening tasks on Zoom.
