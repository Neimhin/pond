These updates key on different parts of the computer virus for better recognition, and better recognition of computer viruses derived from the original. Code updates can also cue different places to look for the patterns.

My understanding is that the mRNA vaccines are somewhat like that. By taking the key proteins in the virus and associating them with signals most peoples' immune systems recognize as threats they give your immune system a set of recognition patches. Your own system then takes over and deals with the threats. In OG Covid and natural immunity that turns into long haul symptoms a person's system might not have recognized all of the key parts of the virus, but only a few, and so not responded strongly enough to banish the virus completely throughout all the major organs in the body, but just enough to knock down the level in say, the lungs. With the recognition patches keying on all the key proteins in the virus the reaction is more diligent and thorough, and the person rids themselves of the virus in those hidden corners.

WRT testing, there are 3 types of tests:


- **PCR: won’t test positive after vaccination**.   The up-the-nose, expensive, and most accurate coronavirus test finds the virus itself. A vaccine won’t make a PCR test return positive because vaccines don’t inject viruses. (Ok, some do, but they're altered and can't cause a positive result.) 

- **Antigen: won’t test positive after vaccination** the vast majority of the time: These are the rapid tests. Antigen tests return positive when they detect a protein created by the virus.  A vaccine won’t cause an antigen test to return positive because vaccines don’t inject viruses so there’s no virus in the body to create the proteins that the antigen tests detect.   Antigen test edge case:  Some vaccines do insert the antigen itself but these are only around temporarily (right after the shot), don’t increase in number over time, and tend to be local to the injection site.  

- **Antibody: will test positive after vaccination**: This is a blood test. Antibody tests tell if you’ve been infected in the past by detecting antibodies to the virus.

I think you meant to say a 12% risk relative to someone who is *unvaccinated*? 

I would concur on pure stats, but disagree contextually based on the life impact. An 88% decrease in chance to have any symptoms relative the control population is extremely good when you considered the vast majority of the control population already has no symptoms. And the stats get even better when it comes to hospitalizations rates for vaccinated people.

The Deets and normal questions:

I got fully vaxed in March (Pfzier). I have been wearing my Mask since the beginning of the pandemic and even after getting vaccinated. 

I work in a pretty risky industry though. I see thousands of people a week in the hospitality industry and they are often intoxicated and not wearing masks. 

I am in Oklahoma. While I am quite close to some noted hotspots of the delta variant (Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas), it isn’t yet known if that’s what I caught. The state health department did test me with a PCR and for variants. Pcr came back positive, but variant testing here takes 10 to 30 days. So I can’t say if I got Delta or not, yet. 

My symptoms have been very mild in the beginning (sore throat). I wouldn’t even have gotten tested if a coworker or two hadn’t tested positive themselves. 

I did lose my sense of taste and smell about four days into my quarantine. This has been the worst part of the ordeal. I hope that these senses come back, however, I am grateful that I did not suffer like my coworkers have. One hospitalized and one who almost was. 

I am 38, male, a non smoker (of either), bmi is 27.3, and I drink twice a week. Those two days of drinking are about 5 to 10 drinks each day (I’m trying to cut that down).

More insurers are starting to charge patients this year

&gt;Most folks who became gravely ill with COVID last year didn't face crushing medical bills because nearly all insurance companies agreed to waive cost-sharing for coronavirus care during the height of the pandemic, explained Dr. Kao-Ping Chua, a health policy researcher and pediatrician at the University of Michigan.

&gt;But some people did get a big bill because their insurer refused to waive cost-sharing, and their debts provide a good idea of what many hospitalized COVID patients will have to pay this year, Chua said.

&gt;""We've had some really big insurers abandon their cost-sharing waivers this year,"" Chua said. ""Insurers seem to be acting like the pandemic is over, and we feel that it's premature for them to be acting in that manner.""

That’s why it’s imperative to lower the transmission rate so we can extinct the virus. All tools should be investigated for use in lowering transmission. Vaccines (*with informed consent), testing, social distancing, masks in close quarters, getting outside, vitamin D, test existing (well-tolerated, with long safety track-record) treatment medications such as ive rm ectin, whoops talk to type. 

There’s a bitter pill here though. There still is a possibility a mutation arrises (evolves) /because/ of the vaccine. There are no oracles here, just probabilities—of which we are all welcome to research and debate in public forums. What better way to hone your understanding (and position) than to shape it against a competing ideas? 

One hypothesis is, this could be very similar to antibiotic resistant “superbugs”. When people use antibiotics, they start to feel better and stop taking them. But if enough bacteria isn’t killed, the remaining bacteria can “learn” to defeat the antibiotics. These resistant strains can spread from person to person, now official variants. 

In the case of covid. What if people are exposed to Covid before second shot? They will not necessarily have full strength resistance. Just like the superbugs… Show the enemy your hand, and you better extinct it. This would need to be investigated. But it doesn’t seem like an unreasonable question to ask?

Certain lineages of SARS-CoV-2 might not be able to adapt to the changing circumstances enough to survive, but others will.

&gt;There are only so many changes this protein can undergo before it no longer fits onto these receptors.

While there's a limit on the rate of mutation; theoretically, there isn't a limit to how many changes a gene can go through, and therefore by extension how many configurations the spike protein can attain.

&gt;If the spike protein mutates enough for it to fully evade our vaccine-induced immunity, it may not be able to bind with the receptors on our cells anymore...

We do know that breakthrough infections do occur, so it's certainly possible that certain configurations are capable of evading both the vaccine and still bind to the receptors on our cells. It's not a perfect process obviously, but the vaccine does act as an incredibly strong selective force and it makes perfect sense that the virus will only improve on its ability to infect fully vaccinated individuals going forward. The biggest factor again, is time.

The virus is certainly never going to go away, but we hope that with the vaccine, we build up enough immunity against it in short enough of a time frame that we ""co-exist"" with it in a way that doesn't kill us.

Everything I've said is just the points that have been made from NSW Government and their Health Officers, and to try and clarify why they believe it's been this case of fleeting transmission.

&gt;If you're asking people to change their understanding of how COVID is transmitted, something which has probably been the single most studied topic in all of science for the last year

I'm not asking anyone to do or believe anything? I'm just trying to clarify Australia's contact tracing because I have noticed a lot of misunderstanding around it on this subreddit. 

This is specifically about the Delta variant, which was only identified a few months ago. There has already been a lot of discussion on changes in Covid transmission due to variants, that's not new. Also, at this stage, very few countries are analysing each individual case and transmission as closely as Australia does (particularly any newer variants), because most in most other countries the community transmission is too high to create a clear enough picture. Additionally, this is just one example of evidence showing that the virus transmitted with fleeting contact. It doesn't mean it's typical. 

&gt;""COVID can be transmitted by a glance"" 

I mean, by the sounds of it, it was still a close interaction. They were facing each other as they crossed by, closely, while not wearing masks. The main concern is how brief the interaction was. 

&gt;Nothing is 100% reliable

I agree. Contact tracing is not 100% reliable. Our current understanding of how Covid transmits is also not yet 100% reliable either.

Like in India, many people here are informal workers who depend on daily wage to provide food on the table, so strict total lockdown is impossible to implement unless the government can guarantee to provide the daily needs of these people. Even if it is provided, there's also a chance that the goverment aid will not reach the intended recipient because corrupt officials are everywhere. 

Meanwhile, business owners are complaining that they'll go bankrupt if another strict lockdown is implemented (which is true, but still), so the goverment need to make some sort of compromise to please them. 

There's also the lack of trust to the health system (because again, corruption is everywhere), particularly in the less educated population. Some people would rather stay at home than go the hospital due to fear that ""they'll make a covid case out of me eventhough it's actually something else"".

We have vaccines which are working great, but I'd agree that vaccines are unlikely to eradicate the virus. We will live with this forever. How bad will be is anybody guess. It's probable that the world will see a decrease in life expectancy and increased deaths among the vulnerable. At the same time I don't like the continuing eroding of freedoms and human rights that slice-by-slice is being taking away by different policies as well as increasing surveillance. 

Zero Covid has the appeal that it can eradicate the virus at the cost of few weeks of harsh measures. Think on New Zealand where if it wasn't for imported cases they are living as we all lived before. Unfortunately I don't think is practicable. You need the world behind it and there are places where it cannot be done. Think on India slums for example. There is no political will to pursue that policy, in part because the message that ""vaccines will take out of this""

my mind is absolutely fucken blown by this. there's a disease that kills one in a hundred people and leaves significantly more with long term health problems vs a vaccine that hasn't killed one in a million and people are choosing the disease?

absolutely zero sympathy. they should be locked up. even if there actually was a small risk to taking the vaccine you still have to take it because the other risk far outweighs it, and bonus, if we don't vaccinate the virus out of the entire population it will just mutate and come back stronger **as it's already done 4 times in 18 months**",,,1625476521,{},h442b8r,False,t3_ody4lt,False,False,t1_h43rof5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ody4lt/fauci_says_he_would_wear_a_mask_in_communities/h442b8r/,1625690705,43,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],[],text,t2_nxt1l,False,False,,

For me it's simple: if you don't vaccinate and catch covid, then all health care costs are out of pocket. In a country such as France where it is all covered, that'll get things moving. 

It is hard to make jabs mandatory yes, but we already do it for a number of illnesses, at least with healthcare staff. 

One of the common things I've noticed is that when people say they are anti vaxx and anti covid, and then end up at deaths door in hospital, for the most part they regret their decision. 

I'm still certain there is a huge correlation between IQ, Emotional Intelligence, and vaccine acceptance. The same people screaming that vaccines are bad are those that would have chased witches around back in the day because a woman sneezed funny 🤣😝

Since no info on deceased age was provided in the article, it's probably impossible to have a conclusion. But it does make you wonder. 

I know Sinopharm is different from Sinovac. But since the first commentator started with the shit Chinese ones. I'm just doing a Chinese vaccine vs AZ comparison I guess.

The timing of the change in effectiveness also corresponds with the ending of restrictions. Further, no evidence they controlled for previous infection in calculating this statistic. 

It's also easy to see a situation where school based outbreaks can bias this number (which is what is happening so far). Most unvaccinated adults in Israel are younger (I am guessing).

Information is collected within a smartphone app (or a paper printout) which presents a QR code that can be scanned at the door. The system is similar to the EU Digital Covid Certificate that is used for travel, except that the QR code for use within the Netherlands shows less personal information. For a valid scan, the scanner app will only display the birthdate (w/o the year) and initials of the person. It doesn't show how the certificate was obtained (vaccine, test or recovery).

The first major point of failure was in establishments not correctly checking the certificates. Once the app shows the green signal, you're supposed to check the birthdate and initials against an ID to ensure that the person in front of you is showing you their own certificate. In several places, guards at the entrance didn't do this and just allowed anyone with a green checkmark to enter. This meant that people could simply copy the QR code from someone else and use that to enter.

Then in the first days of the system going live, many testing sites were overloaded and couldn't deliver the results on tiime. In some cases, people simply got a negative result generated manually for them if they went back to ask why they hadn't gotten their result yet.

The problem that this article is writing about revolves around a test center not correctly entering the results into the system. Automatic barcode scanning failed, so an employee manually entered the results and made an error, causing someone to receive a negative result while he had actually tested positive. The error was only corrected the next morning, after the man had gone to several bars.",,,1625494328,{},h44ozx8,False,t3_oe5awt,False,False,t3_oe5awt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oe5awt/netherlands_covid_positive_adam_man_in_full_bar/h44ozx8/,1625703427,12,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_a4fbm,False,False,,

Covid mutates far slower than flu, we have extensive evidence that vaccinations for it are more effective than previous flue vaccines and covid is far more dangerous than flu. Both in lethality and in long term damage. 

It’s not the same. A long term vaccination campaign could really crush covid.

&gt; Anyone over 18 can now book their appointment for a vaccine, long covid only affects a small portion of people and yes more people will die that’s life

Can book their first dose. Said dose which takes ~ 3 weeks to have efficacy and then is only of limited effectiveness until the second dose, which is again months away.

And according to TvT, they are not advising people that were positively tested to be retested at GGD's. The positive test from TvT is enough to isolate, no need to confirm it at GGD's.

(First shot) 💉💪🩹,dark,[],"Of course I immediately had to go to my country, the Netherlands, as I know most about things here, to see if it makes sense. And it did not. They had quite an extensive methodology page, but some of the data was either wrong or heavily outdated and some metrics/calculations they used just do not make any sense in my opinion.

1. Their way of calculating vaccine coverage does not make sense. They just take total doses used and divide that number based on the type of dose used. Of course this does not make any sense. By far the best metrics is the % of the total population fully vaccinated for 2 weeks. But number of total pop./adults partially/fully vaccinated with or without the 2 weeks would each be a better metric than they used. For example the Netherlands has 62% partially and 38% fully vaccinated of the total population and 77% partially and 47% fully vaccinated of all adults. All could've been used, but instead they went with the vague total doses divided by vaccine type metric which resulted in 43.2% (by the way, my calculations with government data comes back to &gt;50% using their metric...).  Also, if the type of vaccine given is not known, they just divide the entire number by 2, which is another flaw in the metric.
2. The lockdown severity seems totally inaccurate, unless it takes into account the lockdown the Netherlands had 6 months. But if the list would make sense it would look into the current situation, and if that's the case it just seems totally wrong. Basically the only rules that exist are that festivals are limited to 1 day and 25k capacity, 1,5 meter is required unless you have corona free proof (e.g. from test, vaccination or tested positive recently). Everything is open with no set capacity, time and reservation limits. No mask mandate, only in public transport. All education and offices are opened and it is not advised anymore to always work from home whenever possible. Also no travel restrictions nationally and internationally based on the risk level. And that scores 68 on lockdown severity? Alright... Must be outdated or Oxford University has gone crazy.
3. Is flight capacity even fair for countries that do not have domestic air travel. For countries like the Netherlands local public transport together with air travel would be a lot more realistic to measure. By the way, public transportation in the Netherlands is back at the regular pre pandemic schedule for a while now with no travel limitations/advise for any kind of travel. Air travel here is strictly international, and it has nothing to do with how things are going here, but how strictly other countries like to keep their borders closed or how risky it is in other countries.
4. With vaccinated travel routes I'd like see the actual data. Where is the huge disparity from EU countries coming from, who generally have the same international travel rules as a block. For example Spain with 365 and Romania with 371 are at the top, while Finland and Sweden are near the bottom with 142.5 and 167.5 respectively. Everyone is allowed the EU when fully vaccinated unless considered very high risk with variant of concern. This means all fully vaccinated people from all safe, EU, high risk and very high risk can travel to the EU. This is the same for all of the EU. The Netherlands specifically only requires mandatory quarantine when coming from a very high risk country with or without variants of concern. High risk is only advised but not mandatory, and everything else no quarantine.
5. In COVID status, wouldn't it be good to have hospital data as well, as that is perhaps the most reliable metric, as it is often counted well and unless the system is overloaded and limited by capacity, shows well how much COVID is going around. The other metrics are explained well by Bloomberg and make sense. They're also aware of the huge inaccuracies that comes with these metrics. So fine overall.
6. With QOL, only the 2021 GDP growth seems out of place. My main problem is you also have to look with how much the GDP changed due to COVID before 2021. Because an economy that was hit extremely hard bounces back more extremely. If in country A the GDP fell with 10% in 2020, and increase with 5% the next year, your still behind 5%. And if in country B GDP fell with 2% in 2020 and increased with 3% in 2021, your ahead 1%. But according to this list, country A would score significantly better while realistically doing much worse. Bloomberg is trying to argue this is better because: ""the Ranking aims to show the best places to be right now, not just how well they’ve deflected the economic blow from Covid-19."" So with this they are saying that if your GDP will grow a lot this year, it is automatically a lot better place to be right now, no matter what happened last year during the pandemic with the GDP. So economies that did relatively well last year and thus do not have to rebounce their economies to a worse place from a collapse are being punished? For example the Dutch GDP fell by 3.7% last year. The latest economic estimates from major Dutch banks, Dutch Central Bank and CPB all estimate that the Dutch economy will fully recover from the pandemic within a year with all showing a growth &gt;3% and 2022 growth of \~4% for 2022 after which it normalises again assuming some form of pandemic measures will still be need in the rest of 2021. Spain, as a comparison, rebounces more extremely with \~6% growth, after falling 10.8%. The Spanish economy will only recover by the end of 2022/early 2023. That is a year later than the Netherlands. Would you say that Spain would be a better place to be now in relation to the economy?

Overall a fun list with tons of data and beautifully made. But looking at more deeply and at the Netherlands specifically I see to many flaws to say it says anything useful. As a whole, I wouldn't know if these set of metrics are the right ones to make such an evaluation, that's too complex matter for me. I can just look at the individual data and check if they are up to date, accurate and make sense.",,,1625520154,{},h463esq,False,t3_oe81iy,False,True,t3_oe81iy,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oe81iy/us_tops_list_of_the_best_places_to_be_as_covid/h463esq/,1625730330,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_meeqp,False,False,,

(b) The flu is a known illness that rarely has long term effects.  We still don't know whether covid is one of these things like chicken pox that can give you shingles 50 years later.

(c) COVID is more contagious, so they're also more likely to \*catch\* covid than the flu without precautions.

People also seem to think that parents have never in the past taken precautions against kids getting the flu.  We do!

In the US and in my city subreddit, I see people saying that they can get vaccinated because of these conditions.  But every single professional medical society I have seen reccomends vaccination.  The American Cancer Society says this:

&gt;Although we don’t have specific information yet on how effective the vaccines might be  in people being treated for cancer, it’s possible that the vaccines might not be as effective in people with weakened immune systems19 as compared to people with healthy immune systems. Despite this, experts still recommend that most cancer patients get the vaccine because those with a fragile immune system are at risk for severe COVID-19 disease, so getting even some protection from the vaccine is better than not having any protection.

While one swallow doesn't make a summer, there are studies that show cancer patients do develop antibodies at lower levels for example https://www.annalsofoncology.org/article/S0923-7534(21)02075-5/fulltext.  Yes healthy people got 3-10x more in the study but it wasn't nothing and with a third dose it could get much higher.

It beggars belief that I see people regularly claiming they cant get vaccinated.  Just a few days back I got this from a person talking about her daughter.  I asked, and the mother said the daughter had been in remission for five years, but isn't vaccinated at all.

N95 and KN95 respirators are almost as effective, and certainly more effective than any available vaccine. I agreed with you that they are helpful.

No vaccine is perfect but I agree with you that the ones available are very good at preventing symptoms, especially death, from the variants known to be circulating. They are good, but not *as good* at preventing infection and silent spread by the vaccinated. Viral evolution being as open ended as it is, I can't assure you this batch of vaccines will cover every variant of Covid to emerge, and I don't think any epidemiologists have promised us that. Should a virus thoroughly escape immunity the teams that gave us these vaccines will provide an update. If you read far enough back in my post history you will find where I post that I think this booster will conclude the issue as there is are a limited number of mutation bands in the viral RNA and that limits potential escape modes. ""The thing is plastic, not rubber."" So no, I don't believe in Forever Covid - for the people who get their shots. I suspect you would agree with that last.  However Coronavirus is 1/3 of the common cold, we have never eradicated one and this one will never be a candidate for eradication. SARS-CoV2 will be with us forever, increasing global infant mortality and finding the rare victim on a level that is personally tragic but not socially actionable.

The Deets and normal questions:

I got fully vaxed in March (Pfzier). I have been wearing my Mask since the beginning of the pandemic and even after getting vaccinated. 

I work in a pretty risky industry though. I see thousands of people a week in the hospitality industry and they are often intoxicated and not wearing masks. 

I am in Oklahoma. While I am quite close to some noted hotspots of the delta variant (Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas), it isn’t yet known if that’s what I caught. The state health department did test me with a PCR and for variants. Pcr came back positive, but variant testing here takes 10 to 30 days. So I can’t say if I got Delta or not, yet. 

My symptoms have been very mild in the beginning (sore throat). I wouldn’t even have gotten tested if a coworker or two hadn’t tested positive themselves. 

I did lose my sense of taste and smell about four days into my quarantine. This has been the worst part of the ordeal. I hope that these senses come back, however, I am grateful that I did not suffer like my coworkers have. One hospitalized and one who almost was. 

I am 38, male, a non smoker (of either), bmi is 27.3, and I drink twice a week. Those two days of drinking are about 5 to 10 drinks each day (I’m trying to cut that down).

A little [table](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/DLZNg/13/) there which compares the current situation across the UK and USA, for anyone interested.

Case rates in the UK are far far higher, although vaccination coverage is better in the UK, and the UK is seeing fewer deaths. Just looking at test figures, the USA has done 3.24 million PCR tests in the past week (975 per 100k pop) and the UK has done 2.55 million (3,870 per 100k pop). So about 4x as many tests and 8x as many cases here in the UK, per capita

I think the USA might be less susceptible to a Delta wave, due to having higher levels of natural immunity from previous case numbers, and also having more spread out vaccination coverage. Unlike the UK, they won't go into the third wave having barely anyone under the age of 40 fully vaccinated. Which is where the cases are highest in the UK right now, by some [distance](https://i.imgur.com/PgwQsdd.jpg). 

When it does hit there though, I reckon they will see a lot more deaths than what the UK is seeing. [This](https://i.imgur.com/5Y6nKez.jpg) is the US vaccination coverage by age group. And [this](https://i.imgur.com/B5cK4u1.jpg) is Englands, which I imagine is similar to the UK as a wholes. And of course the UK aren't vaccinating people under 18, so the children in the UK are far more susceptible to it and likely to keep spreading it around in schools.",,,1625480189,{},h4469vq,False,t3_oe1quy,False,False,t3_oe1quy,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oe1quy/daily_discussion_thread_july_05_2021/h4469vq/,1625692948,16,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_zqoqr,False,False,,

By Alisa Odenheimer  
July 5, 2021, 8:59 AM GMT+

&amp;#x200B;

Israel has recorded a steep drop in the efficacy rate of the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE in preventing coronavirus infections, due to the spread of the delta variant and the easing of government restrictions, Ynet news website reported, citing Health Ministry data.  
  
At the same time, the decline in protection against serious cases and hospitalization is considerably milder, the website said. There was no immediate comment from the ministry.  
  
The figures show that between May 2 and June 5, t**he vaccine had a 94.3% efficacy rate.** From June 6, five days after the government canceled coronavirus restrictions, until early July, **the rate plunged to 64%**. A similar decline was recorded in protection against coronavirus symptoms, the report said.  
  
At the same time, protection against hospitalization and serious illness remained strong. From May 2 to June 5, t**he efficacy rate in preventing hospitalization was 98.2%**, compared **with 93% from June 6 to July 3**. A similar decline in the rate was recorded for the vaccine’s efficiency in preventing serious illness among people who had been inoculated.  
  
  
These figures are in line with ministry data that show that many of the new cases are among people who have been vaccinated, while the number of serious cases is rising much more slowly, Ynet said. Last Friday, 55% of the newly infected had been vaccinated, the website said. As of July 4, there were 35 serious cases of coronavirus in Israel, compared with 21 on June 19.  
  
The government is considering reinstating additional coronavirus-related restrictions after restoring a mandate to wear masks indoors in public spaces. Officials are also discussing whether to recommend a third dose of vaccine, the report said.  
  
Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla has said people will “likely” need a third dose of a Covid-19 vaccine within 12 months of getting fully vaccinated.  
  
Israel had one of the world’s most effective coronavirus inoculation drives. Some 57% of the general population is fully vaccinated, including 88% of the population above the age of 50 -- the group considered most at risk for serious cases.",,,1625479224,{},h445b1t,True,t3_oe46gq,False,False,t3_oe46gq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oe46gq/israel_sees_decline_in_pfizer_vaccine_efficacy/h445b1t/,1625692387,45,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_137n6z,False,False,,

They have been studying it for decades and are quite familiar with how it works but the reason there haven't been long term human trials is because until recently, the mRNA was breaking down too fast for the body to even acknowledge it. In recent years, they discovered the correct lipids(aka fat) to coat it in so it breaks down slower.

But how about 4 years? That's pretty long term. Plenty long enough for any long term side effects to show up. Moderna has a CMV vaccine in human trials since 2017.

In HCMC, 248 cases were detected in quarantine zones and other locked down areas and 22 others are being contact traced.
In the southern province of Binh Duong, 110 cases are related to a company in Thu Dau Mot Town and four are being contact traced.

Eight cases in the Mekong Delta province of Tien Giang are linked to the My Tho fishing port in the eponymous town, two to a bank in the same town and one linked to HCMC’s Binh Dien Market.

Two cases in the southern province of Binh Phuoc are associated with its Binh Dien Market and two others are being contact traced.
The cases in the central province of Binh Dinh Province are being contact traced and as is the one in Nghe An.

All the cases in the provinces of Dong Thap, Phu Yen, Khanh Hoa, Dong Nai, An Giang, Ba Ria-Vung Tau, Tay Ninh, Bac Giang, Quang Ngai and Bac Ninh are those that came into close contact with previously confirmed coronavirus patients.

The latest additions marks Vietnam's daily tally of Covid-19 cases crossing 1,000 for the first time.

The health ministry also announced the discharge of 203 patients Monday evening, taking the total number of recoveries since the beginning of the pandemic to 8,022.

They would not disclose where the first batch of vaccines they used were produced (they were exported from the UK, the EU had to raid AZ factories to get that information). The aus government also made pubic statements that they would receive 3m AZ doses (in Q1) from European factories, because they had better contracts, in effect because the paid AZ more than the EU for those doses.

It's far from an ""obvious conclusion"". A possible outcome, sure, but anything stronger than that is uncertain.

Not every species is able to adapt to changing circumstances enough to survive. The same is true for viruses. In case of SARS-CoV-2, all vaccines used in the west specifically target the spike protein of the virus. This protein is also what the virus uses to enter our cells.

If the spike protein mutates enough for it to fully evade our vaccine-induced immunity, it may not be able to bind with the receptors on our cells anymore. There are only so many changes this protein can undergo before it no longer fits onto these receptors.

Whether a configuration of the spike exists that is different enough from what the vaccines are protecting against yet still allows the virus to easily enter our cells, is unknown.

[],,IcyAssist,#dadada,,edffbab4-ae7f-11eb-8598-0ebaf885ceb5,I'm vaccinated! (First shot) 💉💪🩹,dark,[],"With the number of daily infections that do not diminish and increasing questions to the current strategy, the government is evaluating the incorporation of a new ""vaccine platform"" that seeks to achieve ""herd immunity"", something that seems more distant than initially expected.

This analysis within the government does not leave aside a complex economic scenario. Although some sectors -such as free shops, clubs and gyms- reopened in the last days, the authorities are worried about the sanitary situation and the possibility that it may be necessary to postpone the normalization of others or, even, that they may have to take steps backwards, political sources told Búsqueda.

In the case of education, which only partially returned to normality, it is not clear now that it will be able to continue advancing towards normality in the immediate future. Its authorities have not received any news on the matter from the Executive Branch, according to what they told Búsqueda. On the other hand, in the teachers' union there are opinions against receiving students in classrooms in all educational establishments because they understand that the health situation makes it very risky.

On Wednesday 26th, President Luis Lacalle Pou held a virtual meeting with members of the Honorary Scientific Advisory Group (GACH) in which the progress of the disease and the vaccination plan were evaluated with concern.



Other vaccines
From the GACH they point out that it is necessary to rethink aspects of the strategy, particularly in terms of vaccination.

""We are vaccinating a good part of the population with a vaccine with an effectiveness in the neighborhood of 55% and 60%,"" Rafael Radi, coordinator of the advisory group, told Búsqueda. ""It's going to be difficult to achieve herd immunity with the vaccine platform we have and thinking about scenarios of possible new variants"" of Covid-19, he added.

""Looking to the future, thinking about the acquisition of new vaccines to achieve herd immunity, vaccination will surely have to be reinforced. This is being studied both in Public Health and in the GACH,"" he informed.

One ""possible scenario"" is to inoculate the population with a third dose of a vaccine with messenger RNA, ""of the Pfizer type. Vaccine mixture trials are being carried out in the world. There are already published clinical trials with Astrazeneca-Pfizer and Pfizer-Astrazeneca. Nothing has been done with CoronaVac-Pfizer. Uruguay could be, and we are handling this within the GACH, a spearhead in this sense, carrying out clinical studies and demonstrating that this is safe and that it offers greater protection. What the experience indicates is that it is a path that one visualizes as one that can be interesting to follow. It will be necessary to reinforce the immunity to inactivated virus. This requires a medical and bioethical approach that needs to go through certain stages. Little do we know how often it is necessary to revaccinate. Perhaps it is like a new vaccination,"" said Radi.



""Avoid deaths"".
Meanwhile, among the population there is majority support for the overall strategy followed by the government in the face of Covid-19 and its consequences, although the recent trend shows a growing disagreement. In its last survey, broadcasted this week on Channel 4, Opción Consultores showed a decrease of 10 percentage points -from 72% to 62%- in the approval of the health management. The director of Public Opinion and Social Studies of this pollster, Rafael Porzecanski, said to Búsqueda that the citizenship has a ""special contemplation"" due to the coronavirus and that is why the negative economic data have a low impact on the overall popularity of the government, although he warned that this may change in the post-pandemic period.

In the political arena, the tone of the messages of the opposition is being critical. For the health advisors of this coalition, there is a ""situation of alarm"". It is ""crazy"" how ""the government continues without taking measures"" to ""avoid deaths"", said to Búsqueda the president of the Frente Amplio, Javier Miranda.

They propose ""21 days of radical reduction of mobility throughout the country, maintaining only essential activities"", as well as an ""economic and social rescue of the sectors most affected"" by the crisis.

With the intermediation of the pro-government senators who are members of the Special Commission for the Follow-up of the Sanitary Emergency, the Executive Power will formally analyze the measures proposed by the Frente Amplio.

At the same time, the Executive Committee of the Medical Union approved a declaration in which it demands the government to adopt more measures to fight the pandemic in view of the ""tragic"" and ""extremely serious health situation of the country"". The union also urges citizens to ""make a new and maximum effort"" to reduce their mobility and requests a meeting with the President of the Republic.

Second, a study in Canada just showed Pfizer is almost as good at preventing symptoms as much as Alpha. Not peer reviewed either but at least is a study. Other studies in the UK and Qatar also show higher efficacy.

Third, if the Delta variant is more contagious and has more viral load, does it really make sense to track asymptomatic infection? Can it really spread from an asymptomatic person if the vaccine is actually doing its job perfectly? Is the “positive” just a result of Delta’s high viral load being present in the body rather than a real infection?

Alpha rose dramatically to became the single most prolific strain, but still spent a long time co-existing with other strains with large ""market share"", from which Delta ultimately emerged.

I see. So it is not currently the case that we know that vaccination provides a 79% reduction in transmission, though everything seems to be pointing at a significant reduction in transmission. 

&gt; To be clear, I am absolutely arguing that going from 80% to may be 95% efficacy against spreading a disease is not worth arguing for. You should be arguing to get everyone vaccinated or to mandate vaccines.

Fair enough. Though the two are not mutually exclusive. You could argue for masking and vaccination. If I had to mandate one it'd be vaccination for sure. 

From what I understand of the cdc's decision, the benefits of masking and other preventative measures for fully vaccinated individuals are seen to diminish in models as vaccine coverage increases, but I think it's fair to say that they still help especially in places with low vaccination rates.

&gt;  
&gt;Israel's ministry of health ~~just~~ announced that the Pfizer vaccine's efficacy (against infection) ""dropped to only 64%"" (source: [https://m.ynet.co.il/articles/rJQ1O5kp00#autoplay](https://m.ynet.co.il/articles/rJQ1O5kp00#autoplay) \- it's in Hebrew but you can use Google Translate ~~to translate the page~~).  
&gt;  
&gt;The ability to stop severe infections remains high but they're ~~apparently~~ reconsidering nationwide mask mandates ~~again~~ even for vaccinated people. This casts ~~a lot of~~ doubt on how well the vaccine works at blocking transmission.  
&gt;  
&gt;UChicago data from May 2021 says: ""more than 50% of community transmission was from asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases."" ([https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/asymptomatic-coronavirus-infections-contribute-to-over-50-percent-of-spread](https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/asymptomatic-coronavirus-infections-contribute-to-over-50-percent-of-spread))  
&gt;  
&gt;~~Thus, if~~ The vaccine is good at protecting you from serious covid symptoms, but you're still infected and passing it around, if you live in a population with a high rate of unvaccinated people then it seems like vaccinated people should still be masking and social distancing ~~given this news, as~~ because being asymptomatic ~~doesn't mean you're not~~ means you can still be infected and therefore spreading the virus.

I don’t think you understand the nuance of the situation and are just applying binary logic to it. It’s not “wear a mask” or “don’t wear a mask”. It’s about minimizing your risk. 

I don’t wear a mask at a restaurant with my friends because we often hang out together, we are all vaccinated, and like me my friends also try to minimize their risk. When there is a slightly larger event or when I’m meeting new people, I wear a mask unless I decide their risk is low. 

I do wear a mask when going grocery shopping since I’m in a crowded indoor space, with hundreds of people, poor ventilation, and not knowing who is vaccinated or asymptomatic. By doing so, I further minimize the risk to my friends when I do meet them without a mask. 


Why is this so hard to understand? We’ve had a year of this virus circulating, thousands of deaths, billions of dollars in economic loss, further trillions over the next 70 years or so…. And here you are without the capability of thinking with nuance.

[],,NewShooterComingOut,,,,,,[],"From the article:

In March 2020, global health leaders all generally believed the same thing about SARS-CoV-2: It was spread through what is known as large-droplet transmission.  
When people talk — or cough, or sneeze, or exhale, or sing — lots of microscopic spittle of various sizes comes flying out. In large-droplet transmission, the virus hides in the biggest globs of spit, which, because of their size, can’t fly too far. Instead, they land on tabletops and door knobs and, perhaps, the faces of other people who are standing very close by. People touch those surfaces with their hands, then rub their eyes or wipe their noses and unwittingly usher the virus into their bodies.  
This is how health experts have long believed other common viruses, such as the flu, are spread. And it gave rise to common recommendations for protecting yourself from COVID-19, such as sanitizing surfaces.  
That run on bleach wipes last spring? It was because everyone was told that SARS-CoV-2 spreads primarily through large-droplet transmission.  
There’s another way that viruses can spread, though, and it plays to Jimenez’s and other atmospheric chemists’ strong suit. Alongside the big droplets of spit that come flying out of mouths are tiny droplets called aerosols. They don’t plop to Earth within a few feet. Instead, aerosols hang in the air for minutes at a time. They ride the wind.  
Viruses that hide within aerosols can float through the air and be breathed in by the next person on the transmission chain. And it’s possible they can jump between people standing farther than 6 feet apart — the oft repeated distance global health leaders have recommended for physical spacing to prevent spread. (Jimenez, however, believes keeping distance from others does help control coronavirus spread because it creates space for aerosols to disperse.)  
Measles, tuberculosis and chickenpox all spread via aerosols, though Jimenez said health experts were slow to recognize airborne spread for all three of those viruses. To him, the COVID-19 pandemic was history repeating itself.  
In late-March 2020, less than three weeks after the Washington state choir practice, the World Health Organization posted a message on Twitter rejecting the idea that SARS-CoV-2 was spread through aerosols.

I assumed this... Driving isn't as risky as many people make it out to be. I worked out the stats, the risk of needing medical help is like 1/120,000 trips on average. The risk of death was like 1/15,000,000 trips on average. I'm pretty sure the risk of covid is a wee bit higher than that. 

Winter sports is an interesting one I haven't thought about... 

&gt;And the stats get even better when it comes to hospitalizations rates for vaccinated people.

No it's not. This isn't even concern trolling anymore, you're literally just parroting antivax bs now.The mRNA in the vaccines gets consumed and eventually destroyed by the cells and it cannot be transcribed back into your DNA. Same goes for the DNA in the adenoviral vaccines.

And even if it could (which it can't), then it would mean that literally every single time you catch a cold it would *also* alter your DNA anyway, so what would be the point of worrying about it if it happens all the time?

[Is Covid’s Impact on the Brain as Alarming as It Sounds? Even mild cases can cause significant brain changes, research shows, making “living with Covid” a risky and dangerous strategy.](https://archive.is/2Fafz)

&gt;Even mild cases of Covid led to loss of volume in certain areas of the brain, specifically those involved in processing smell and taste. But they also found statistically significant brain volume loss in the gray matter — the thin layer on the surface of the brain that contains most of the neurons — in other areas involved with memory formation. The authors speculate that this raises the possibility that even mild cases of SARS-Cov-2 infection can have deleterious effects that may last long past the period of infection.

The paperwork required to provide Taiwan with the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines was completed Monday, Hsieh said in a Facebook post.

It will be the second batch of AZ vaccines donated by Japan to Taiwan after a first shipment of 1.24 million vaccine doses of the same brand were sent to Taiwan on June 4.

Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said June 25 that Japan will made a second donation to Taiwan of 1 million COVID-19 vaccines that will be delivered by mid-July.

Taiwan has signed contracts to purchase about 20 million vaccine doses from abroad, including 5.05 million doses of Moderna, 10 million doses of AZ, and 4.76 million of unspecified brands through the international COVAX vaccine-sharing scheme.

To date, Taiwan has taken delivery of three shipments of the AstraZeneca vaccine -- 117,000 doses purchased directly from AZ in March, 199,200 doses obtained through COVAX in April, and another 410,400 doses obtained via COVAX on May 19 -- in addition to the 1.24 million AZ vaccine doses from Japan.

It has also received 800,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine doses ordered and another 2.5 million Moderna doses as a donation from the United States.

The UK and Canada spaced their doses further apart, because they were prioritizing first doses over second dose. I was wondering if that longer spacing confers a different level of immunity, resulting in the higher efficacy reported from the UK vs. Israel against Delta specifically.  
  
That would not explain the relative decline that Israel has experienced with respect to Israel.  
  
&gt; Or if it's waning immunity over time, since Israel's population was fully vaccinated before the UK even started second doses, i.e. the UK's antibodies are more recent.  
  
Could be, but just a few weeks should not make such a difference, unless there is a soft threshold level.  
There does seem to be several soft thresholds, both on infecting others, on having symptoms and on hard hospital cases.

It isn't completely irrational for her to have some concerns.

She might want to consider an mRNA vaccine which does not have the associated risk of blood clots if she can find them. It was the J&amp;J that had issues with rare blood clots.

&gt;**If I'm currently using hormal birth control, should I use a different type of birth control method or consider a differen vaccine?**

&gt;People using hormonal birth control can receive any FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine. There are no recommendations to stop taking hormonal birth control (birth control pills, implant, patch, ring, or shot) before or after receiving the J&amp;J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine.**Although the risk of blood clots is increased with some hormonal birth control methods (for example, certain types of birth control pills, patch, and ring), based on the available data, experts believe that these factors do not make people more likely to develop thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) after receiving the J&amp;J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine.** As noted above, TTS is a rare condition that involves blood clots with low platelets. All women younger than 50 years old (regardless of their birth control use) should be aware of the rare but increased risk for TTS following vaccination with the J&amp;J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. **Other COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna) are available where this risk has not been seen.  If you are concerned about your current method of birth control, please talk with your healthcare provider.**

The debate in other countries right now is that before reopening we need to get more vaccinations done and up our numbers. This debate is irrelevant in the US, because the US has already hit saturation point with vaccinations. The vaccines have been available for months so anybody who doesn't have them already is either a) refusing or b) under 12 years old or c) unable to take it for some other legit medical reason (very small number of people, one notable group would be people who just did chemo I think).

Secondly, this epidemiologist has made wild projections [last year about at least50,000 to 250,000 dead by end of 2020.](https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/03/31/bappenas-ui-modeling-shows-grim-projection-of-covid-19-spread-in-indonesia.html)

Thirdly, Indonesia only has been decentralized for about 20 years.  And the epidemiologist till thinks the central government can step in and take over. It can't. Almost all the hospitals are under the control of regional governments.

Some regional government have handled it better than others, and its not necessarily down to money.

The capital, Jakarta, has about 9000 cases a day with positivity at about 25-30%. Surabaya the second largest city, Surabaya, with 3 Million, a population 1/3 of Jakarta, has about 60 cases per day and positivity rate of 1-2%  Jakarta prior to the surge the positivity rate was between 5-10%, in Surabaya it was under 1%. Last year, Surabaya experience a serious surge where the heath care system collapsed, but it refused to do lockdowns like Jakarta. So it focused on testing, contract tracing. and micro lockdowns. Surabaya over time has managed to boast its contact tracing from 1:3 last year to 1:40 today

However, Surabaya hospitals are still overrun today, because of cases flooding from the rest of the province of East Java. About 70% of the Covid 19 cases are for people living outside Surabaya..

Lastly is the Indonesian government stupid for not doing so?  Even last year Indonesia only had relatively light social restrictions. Had it done what its neighbors had done, and exhausted itself in the process,  Many Indonesian government officials are more scared of social unrest that hard lockdowns will bring than people dying of covid-19. While Westerners might take pity and at the same time mock the Indonesian government, your financial markets don't, they will go right for the jugular like they did in 1998.

Israel's initial success seemed to create hope that vaccination could simply create herd immunity, and though it's still an open question exactly how evasive Delta really is, it's clear that it spreads easily. Vaccinating more children might create herd immunity against Delta, but it won't be the last variant, and the nature of this thing seems to be that it will keep spreading until everyone catches it at least once.

So now that herd immunity seems unlikely, the question is how much we want to do to keep R0 under 1, along with questions about whether mild/asymptomatic cases (like kids mostly get) can have long-term health consequences (I don't think so, but it would be hard to prove for such a new virus).

1. the percentages we have, especially when vaccines just started rolling out, aren't like, failproof numbers applicable to every situation. That feels obvious to state, but a TON of people don't think about it like that. And the rates we had for different vaccines in the US when things started rolling out weren't really comparable to the other vaccines, and the rates themselves were significantly affected by how bad covid was in that area at the time the trials were done, etc... Which was one reason the J&amp;J efficacy rate was so much lower than Pzifer/Moderna at the time, because they started trials later when things were worse. [the vox video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3odScka55A) was an easily digestible explanation of most of that for regular people
2. that led to tons of people in the US, say, refusing to get a J&amp;J vaccine and waiting longer because they wanted a pfizer/moderna vaccine. when that just continues to make it worse for everyone.

But while being dismissive about the risk from mild cases of Covid-19 makes sense if a mild case is really no more dangerous than the common cold, there's more and more evidence of significant long term health risks from even mild cases of Covid-19:

[Is Covid’s Impact on the Brain as Alarming as It Sounds? Even mild cases can cause significant brain changes, research shows, making “living with Covid” a risky and dangerous strategy.](https://archive.is/2Fafz)

Everybody is vulnerable, moreso to Delta. Just less vulnerable than others. It's just a matter of what amount of vulnerability you are willing to tolerate. Are you willing to accept that after full saturation 1/1000 kids may die, and a higher rate for people 18-40? Because that's what'll happen. Some people might be okay with that -- I understand that -- doctors are not because they don't want to see the system overwhelmed again. At this point, we are pretty much having to accept that 1/1000 risk in kids until they can get the vaccine, because the reopenings are happening and they are not/cannot be put on pause forever.

We don't want to hit that saturation point or anything close to it. The point is to slightly delay restriction-lifting by a few weeks, because 2nd doses are going out *rapidly* right now. 

&gt; This actually looks to be wholly incorrect, looking at the new data from Canada, Israel, etc. AZ is infact better than Pfizer.

It is correct. I'm from Canada, we aren't administering AZ anymore and this is one of the reasons why. It has been recommended for maybe a month now that anybody who got AZ for their 1st dose should get Pfizer or Moderna for their 2nd dose instead because that combined regimen is more effective than AZ-AZ (the combo seems to be almost as good as Pfizer/Moderna for both - I think the numbers were 94% and 96% against hospitalization for them respectively).

&gt; Stay inside for the next 400 years if you want. Not stopping you.

Nobody is even close to suggesting that, you only derail the conversation by falsely throwing that around which is not helpful.

To reiterate: *nobody* is suggesting ""stay inside forever"". They are suggesting not lifting restrictions for another 2-3 weeks (or even just doing so much more selectively) so that a much larger proportion of the country can get their shots.

The other side of this is that people need to know that as soon as kids are eligible for vaccines, they need to get vaccinated IMMEDIATELY because there is a real risk for them, even if it is 1/1000.",,,1625514611,{},h45slcs,False,t3_oe47ut,False,False,t1_h45rpig,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oe47ut/uk_pm_to_confirm_19_july_end_to_covid_rules/h45slcs/,1625724805,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_6sqa1,False,False,,

Delta is causing MIS-C at a rate of about 1/1000 in children. That rate is higher in people ages 18-40. The govt is basically saying we're willing to sacrifice those people to open up, rather than waiting a few weeks when many more can be vaccinated.

I dunno what the rates are in the UK, but here in Canada we just opened up big time for 2nd vaccinations and are having similar debates. We are currently giving about 1% of the country its second vaccination every day. That means Ontario's 3 week delay between stage 2 and 3 of reopening will allow an additional 20%+ of people to get that second vaccination before then which makes a huuuge difference in slowing Delta.

Left uncontrolled by restrictions, Delta will likely make its way to every unvaccinated person within 18 months. This is assuming we don't run into some even more transmissible variant.

Many people haven't had their second doses, much of the UK has also had AZ-AZ which is less effective against Delta (still very good though in the grand scheme of things). 

&gt; If an exit wave is to happen, better now in the height of summer, than at the same time as a potential surge of the flu in winter.

The point is that with a few more weeks, many more people could have their second doses. Here in Canada we are in the same position. We just ramped up second vaccinations BIG TIME (just opened up to 18+, I am 31 and just got my second vaccine on Thursday) but they are still relatively low; we did 7% of the country's second vaccinations in the last week. In Ontario we have 2 more weeks until the next stage of reopening, many other provinces are fully open now. But every day we can delay means 1% or even more of the country will get that second dose. That makes a huge difference in slowing or stopping the spread of Delta. 

We know x2 vaccinations are very good against Delta, we can feel comfortable with that. But the problem is that many many people haven't got them yet so by opening up we're exposing many people to the virus (left uncontrolled, each Delta infection results in 7-8 new infections).

It isn't an exit wave now vs. an exit wave in the winter. It's an exit wave vs no wave at all, but a longer stretched out series of smaller outbreaks (this will always exist to some degree, because not everybody will get vaccinated).

Most importantly, kids are not vaccinated. Everybody has a different level of damage they are willing to accept. Right now the science seems to show that MIS-C appears to happen in 1/1000 children, and it happens in greater rates to adults ages 20-30, most of whom in the UK have not had their second vaccines yet.

The UK reports do track how much the vaccine protects you from hospitalization, and how much it protects you from catching COVID at all. 

Last I saw, they had it around 80% reduction in chance of getting COVID, and if you get it, then 80% reduction in chance of being hospitalized.  

The point is though, that's the reduction in hospitalization risk if you're catching it -- 80%.

The Ministry of Health confirmed 307 new covid cases on Wednesday, the highest since April, with at least one case in 256 locations. The number of serious cases rose to 29 from 22 on Tuesday, with 17 on ventilators. Over 16,000 children aged 12-15, received their first shots in a race to use up a large stock of Pfizer vaccines whose expiry date falls later this month. Aside from facemasks indoors, PM Naftali Bennett decided against restoring restrictions to combat the highly contagious Delta variant dominating the new figures.

Per the [most recent PHE data from UK, page 2](https://khub.net/web/phe-national/public-library/-/document_library/v2WsRK3ZlEig/view_file/479607329?_com_liferay_document_library_web_portlet_DLPortlet_INSTANCE_v2WsRK3ZlEig_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fkhub.net%3A443%2Fweb%2Fphe-national%2Fpublic-library%2F-%2Fdocument_library%2Fv2WsRK3ZlEig%2Fview%2F479607266)

Someone with Pfizer vaccine who is infected is, with 95% confidence, 10-118% as likely to be hospitalized as someone who is infected but not vaccinated. They found 30% as likely to be the most likely value. 

Keep in mind that delta is 2x as likely to hospitalize as alpha was. Which means that if you're infected, you're really more like 60% as likely to be hospitalized as if you caught alpha without being vaccinated. 

The reason we aren't seeing rising deaths in the UK is due to the largely vaccinated populations not catching COVID to begin with. It's why a rise in cases or a return to normalcy is still concerning. If it's just unvaccinated young people catching COVID then that's ""fine"", there won't be many hospitalizations.
