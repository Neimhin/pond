[],,meridianbobcat9,,,,,,[],"Also here's a couple things from the CDC. Below are quotes from the page but basically if you are vaccinated and you have a break through infection you are less infectious because you are producing less virus and the time you are infectious is shorter so that further reduces the risk of spreading it to someone that is vulnerable. The virus transmits more easily in communities with lower vaccination rates because people that get infected produce more virus and are infectious for longer periods of time leading to more opportunities for it to spread.  More spreading means more disease, endangering those that are vulnerable, and also gives it more opportunities to make more varients which is how you get things like delta.

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/fully-vaccinated-people.html#infections-fully-vaccinated

the U.S. COVID-19 vaccination program has substantially reduced the burden of disease in the United States by preventing serious illness in fully vaccinated people and interrupting chains of transmission.These findings, along with the early evidence for reduced levels of viral mRNA and culturable virus in vaccinated people who acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggest that any associated transmission risk is substantially reduced in vaccinated people: even for Delta, evidence suggests fully vaccinated people who become infected are infectious for shorter periods of time than unvaccinated people infected with Delta.¬†

Vaccinated people can still become infected and have the potential¬†to¬†spread the virus to others, although at much lower rates than unvaccinated people. The risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection in fully vaccinated people are higher where community transmission of the virus is widespread. Current efforts to maximize the proportion of the U.S. population that is fully vaccinated against COVID-19 remain critical to ending the COVID-19 pandemic.",,,,1636255040,{},hjmsq8z,False,t3_qob75w,False,True,t1_hjmnoui,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qob75w/health_care_company_cuts_ties_with_aaron_rodgers/hjmsq8z/,1636513717.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_2c2jbl7v,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Might toss in long-covid for kicks. But then you're not here to learn anything, are you?

Bold claim there.

&gt;coming from when most schools were closed last year so wasn‚Äôt apparent how much of a problem Covid can be in kids.

Weird, because we've had close to half a school year now during a record surge in COVID cases, and kids aren't exactly keeling over dead.

And places like Texas and Florida had their schools open last year, and kids weren't dropping over dead.

The vast majority of kids that died ""from COVID"" over the last two years were either extremely immuno-compromised or already dying from something like leukemia.  You haven't seen perfectly healthy kids dying from COVID.

OTOH, we have seen perfectly healthy kids dropping dead from the COVID vaccine and others suffering from permanent heart damage from the vaccine.

On Day 9, all symptoms gone except for intermittent asthma-like symptoms with a cough. I had asthma as a child.

Day 11, out of quarantine per CDC.

Day 24, got JnJ vaccine.

&gt; Patients with treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis were reported to possess specific HLA alleles, which retain the ability to present this autoantigen (Gross et al., 1998; Trollmo et al., 2001). **Such HLA alleles, however, were not found more commonly in persons who developed arthritis after taking the OspA vaccine, calling its etiology into question** (Ball et al., 2009). Less than 10% of vaccinated individuals reported side effects, including mild, local reactions and mild arthralgia (dose incidence 0.2%) from three different formulations of the vaccine; this result was not significantly different from the placebo group (Van Hoecke et al., 1996). Nonetheless, reports emerged suggesting that the vaccine could be arthritis-inducing (Rose et al., 2001; Lathrop et al., 2002). This led to anti-vaccine sentiment and class action lawsuits, along with reduced support amongst physicians for the vaccine and eventually enough of a decline in use for its voluntary removal by the manufacturer.

[],,wombatstuffs,,,,,,,"The article describe well the situation. I add a few bits below to describe situation in Here (Hungary), less 'scientific', but like a briefing (I'm a native Hungarian speaker, but less in English, pardon for spelling):

* 'Forecast' not good
   * maybe a week from now and reach the 2nd wave worst times
   * maybe 2+ week and the 3rd wave worst
* Near zero restrictions (at least now)
   * Mask mandatory ONLY in the public transport (and hospitals off course)
      * So, no mask used nowhere else (in generic life)
      * Maybe 10% of peoples wear mask at general
   * All shops open, all restaurants/nightclubs open, etc.
   * Near no restrictions in education (like elementary school). 
      * Some University start mandatory mask
      * Near zero 'distance learning' 
   * Very-very few event (near zero) require 'green card' (vaccination/recover/test)
   * Near 'unbelievable' if you come from another (like Western European) country... 
      * Its like 'no tomorrow country'...
* Vaccination campaign 
   * Near zero progress on new vaccinations (as the article also mention) for months ! 
   * Vaccination mandatory for healthcare workers
   * Some mandatory vaccination started for government workers
      * Eg.: Military, Office worker, but progress not know, its just announced 
   * 3rd dose: in here: 4 months after the '2nd dose', everyone allowed to get it 
      * Usually Pfizer used for that, not bad progress on that 
      * Note: you get as 3rd only 1 dose! 
      * May (usually) you can choose what can be a 3rd dose (also depend on stocks, etc.)
   * Vaccination requires previous registration
      * So, no 'walk-on-by' vaccination today
      * However, you can get vaccination like 'next day', no issue 
      * You can 'freely choose' vaccine (really!) However, maybe vaccination point at this time has only Pfizer and Astra, or GP may has only Moderna and Janssen, but no biggie.
* Vaccines in here
   * Pfizer; Moderna; Janssen (JJ); AstraZeneca; Sputnik (the Russian one); Sinopharm (China)
   * Practically most of the new vaccinations is Pfizer, less Moderna (as we have less of that)
      * Sinopharm (China) practically not used anymore ('no one wanted'), some same regarding Sputnik (not too much Sputnik left, seems 'works' 'around like' AstraZeneca), OX/AZ also not used too much this days
* Testing
   * Testing ONLY free if Doctor 'approve' it (like if you have symptomes)
      * In some other nearby countries government provide (or provide in the near past) free testing 2-6 times a month
* Government communication
   * Government practically provide only very basic data's, like daily: Sum of all 1st doses, sum of all 2nd doses, sum of 3rd doses, daily new cases, cases in hospital, cases in 'ventilator', daily new deaths, sum of deaths
   * And practically near nothing else... No overview, no graphs, no query's, nothing. [Here](https://koronavirus.gov.hu/cikkek/5-millio-968-ezer-beoltott-6804-az-uj-fertozott-elhunyt-83-beteg) one 'daily government publication example'. No new data in weekends 
      * Off course news sites provide this some form of this informations, like [this](https://atlo.team/koronamonitor/)
      * No real official information's about areas (counties) and similar breakdowns, so on. 
      * No real information about 'breakthrough' cases, etc.
      * No real information ICU cases, they just provide 'Hospital' and 'on Ventillator' cases
   * Government popularize (but with relatively low efforts) the Vaccination only
      * They don't think about Masks, restrictions, lockdowns or similars
      * I guess: mainly because elections in next spring

The previous all in 'briefing' style (some details is missed out of course). If you like to ask something, please reply, and i try my best.

I would like to make a slight correction here because your comment really understates how serious those diseases are.

The data you reference does not account only for cases in children, but cases in the total population (edit: in white western countries). The majority of those would not kill an adult, but if a child for example contracts polio the chances of it resulting in death are astronomical and the children that do survive have to live their lives with debilitating consequences in the form of amputated limbs and organ damage.

Another reason I'm choosing to wait is due to a few relatives/friends of mine who *coincidentally* (or not) are experiencing some side effects still months after getting their shots (and no, they were never skeptical about the shots). 

One has hard time breathing just going up the stairs - doctor said has nothing to do with the shot and she is just ""anxious"". One got diagnosed with high blood pressure only after taking the shot - doctor said she's drinking too much coffee (even though she drinks 1 cup only per day and has been doing so for decades). Strange stuff. Another has numbness/pain in her leg and could barely walk the first week after getting the 2nd shot. Fortunately she is good now but still has random spasms of not being able to walk. Why are all these weird things happening only after the shot?

Not denying that the shot works, the data is there. It's just that there CAN be some bad side effects, and requiring everyone, even healthy kids who have a very low chance of dying from covid to begin with, is a bit much.

However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data.

I was on a boat that broke out with the virus before the vaccine was available.  A boat with about 130 people onboard and about 45 tested positive.

So naturally, I'm going to take a guess here.

It looks like the Delta wave got really concentrated in the south through Texas and Florida, and ever since, there's been a wave permeating out from those two locations. First it was the whole south (who got rocked hard because of low vaccination rates), then the mid-Atlantic and lower Midwest, now it's the upper Midwest and mountain area, and you can even see the beginning inklings of spread into California.

It's much less common (1-2%) for someone who is vaccinated not to seroconvert.  Now, antibodies aren't the whole of immunity, but still, vaccine derived immunity is much more reliable, especially for those who already had an infection:

As far as randomness goes I remember reading one article making a decent argument that viruses should be studied in parallel with/relates heavily to chaos theory. For instance, a double pendulum (look up a video on youtube) will start flipping almost randomly compared to another double pendulum that started in almost the same starting condition, just with a slight difference. The correlation to Covid is that slightly different initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes. So even in places with similar NIP's, vaccination rate, populations etc. it may be possible that merely by chance one group gets statistically ""unlucky"" so to speak (superspreaders, abnormally high (yet statistically accounted for) higher transmission in certain situations)) that leads to different caseload/pandemic trajectories.

Also, kids can still carry it to their parents and their parents can die from it -- over 140,000 kids in the U.S. have lost a parent or caregiver, many have lost both parents. It's great that little Timmy won't die from COVID, but I bet he'd be happier if he had parents.

&gt; Also, you dont need indefinite amount of shots, 

You mean like the yearly flu shot that over half the population of the U.S. gets every year? You act like vaccines are some newfangled thing that we don't know anything about. There are a dozen vaccines that practically every child gets before they turn 2 years old, and several that require boosters every few years.

The raw CDC data now has more than 100% of those 65-74 receiving a first dose.  I assume this is a combination of second/booster doses being incorrectly as first doses, and inaccurate population counts.  There are also other small inconsistencies in the data such the total of first dose decreasing for those 16-17 in late October.

The CDC has not yet split out the 0-11 age group into 0-4 and 5-11, like they did when those 12-15 became eligible.

""Men are also more likely to develop certain rare complications from some Covid-19 vaccines and to experience a faster decline in measures of immunity once vaccinated. The reasons remain unclear.

Historically, women have been largely excluded from medical studies, and health issues that predominantly affect women have been under-researched. This is both morally wrong and medically foolish because it limits physicians' ability to deliver optimal care.

The opioid epidemic was created in the wake of a literal letter to the editor which was then billed as rigorous evidence that mu-kappa receptor agonists were not addictive due to the dysphoric effects of kappa agonism. People in the early 90s didn't question it, and regulations weren't in place to handle it. You could walk into a doctor's office, say you have back pain, and get 30mg of oxy three times a day for 90 days with refills. This led to the crisis we're still in now, which was then studied rigorously, regulations were put in place, and we're working on backpedaling it. 

Worthy of noting, this was largely perpetrated by the Sackler family and Perdue Pharma, neither of which were involved in the development of covid vaccines.

Covid vaccines, by contrast, were developed under extremely rigorous, open data, peer reviewed circumstances, and their efficacy has been verified in countless third party studies at this point. The n on doses administered is now in the *billions*, with side effects remaining infinitesimal, especially as compared with long term side effects of contracting covid, which we actually are still learning about. mRNA technology for medicines has been in development for 25 years, and their mechanism within the immune system is extremely well described.

[],,pegothejerk,,,,,,,"So I'll take a shot at boiling this down for those coming to comments to get a jist of things: 

There's a ton of different antibodies that have been identified by scientists that people they've studies produced to fight infections they had, in this case they studied people who has Covid-19, and particularly this one person who had both covid-19 and the original virus that cause SARS, SARS-CoV-1. He developed a unique antibody that is particularly good at attaching to and disabling both Sars-cov-2 and SARS-CoV-1, along with a bunch of other coronaviruses that exist in other animals. That's very good because we worry about coronaviruses that sit in other populations of animals in particular and their potential to jump into humans to cause a pandemic, exactly like this pandemic. More of that will happen in the future, that's a guarantee. So this antibody is particularly unique because it isn't just good at reducing the severity of illness, like most antibodies, but is also particularly good at stopping infection, antibodies don't usually do both, and this one stops infection in the deep lung tissue of mice, hopefully humans, too, so that's particularly great, as it appears our vaccine induced antibodies don't do such a great job at that the further out from a challenge to your immune system you get. 

So this antibody can be cloned and delivered both before you might expect to be infected, like in the early days of a pandemic, or when a loved one gets confirmed with an infection but before you fall sick, AND after you get sick to limit how sick you get. Probably as a monoclonal antibody treatment, so perhaps as an IV, but pill form versions of monoclonal antibody treatments are close to being developed and released. Out of 1700 antibodies, 50 were identified that were of interest for being good at their job, and this one was the only one that seems to do an amazing job, even against many other coronaviruses, so it's a good candidate for mass production and stockpiling for future pandemics.",,,,1636242894,{},hjm3s41,False,t3_qoc09j,False,True,t3_qoc09j,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qoc09j/scientists_identify_new_antibody_for_covid19_and/hjm3s41/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_38eke,False,False,,False,cc389144c0d26899a31d022174895b921986167f,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1636242906.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has precipitated a global health crisis of unprecedented proportions. Because of its severe impact, multiple COVID-19 vaccines are being rapidly developed, approved and manufactured. Among them, mRNA vaccines are considered as ideal candidates with special advantages to meet this challenge. However, some serious adverse events have been reported after their application, significantly increasing concerns about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines and doubts about the necessity of vaccination. Although several fertility societies have announced that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are unlikely to affect fertility, there is no denying that the current evidence is very limited, which is one of the reasons for vaccine hesitancy in the population, especially in pregnant women. Herein, we provide an in-depth discussion on the involvement of the male and female reproductive systems during SARS-CoV-2 infection or after vaccination. On one hand, despite the low risk of infection in the male reproductive system or fetus, COVID-19 could pose an enormous threat to human reproductive health. On the other hand, our review indicates that both men and women, especially pregnant women, have no fertility problems or increased adverse pregnancy outcomes after vaccination, and, in particular, the benefits of maternal antibodies transferred through the placenta outweigh any known or potential risks. Thus, in the case of the rapid spread of COVID-19, although further research is still required, especially a larger population-based longitudinal study, it is obviously a wise option to be vaccinated instead of suffering from serious adverse symptoms of virus infection.",,,,1636300260,{},hjoow76,True,t3_qor7lz,False,False,t3_qor7lz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qor7lz/effects_of_covid19_and_mrna_vaccines_on_human/hjoow76/,1636549025.0,15,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_67vr4xq3,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,RepublicSuperb7057,,,,,,[],"I caught something from work a little over a week ago. When I felt bad starting last Tuesday AM, I texted my boss that I was going to WFH that day as we just had someone come back from being in the hospital and I didn‚Äôt want my germs to get more people sick. A few hours later he sent me a negative sounding text telling me I had to come in, I‚Äôm not following proper procedure, and my WFH request was denied. I was furious and was like ‚Äúok, if he wants my germs, I‚Äôll be sure to stand in his office without my mask on.‚Äù (I wore a mask everywhere else) When I got to the office, he commented about how horrible I sounded and sent me home to WFH. He explained that ‚Äúhe was an ass‚Äù because I needed to physically call him and ask for permission to WFH instead of just sending him a text explaining how I felt &amp; that I was going to WFH. What??

At the very least, during the ‚Äúdiscussion‚Äù, I got to call him out for a double-standard he was using (as he had let another employee WFH the week before without having to jump through hoops) to his face before I went home.",,,,1636316897,{},hjpv95g,False,t3_qob75w,False,True,t1_hjngkx9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/qob75w/health_care_company_cuts_ties_with_aaron_rodgers/hjpv95g/,1636574178.0,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,[],text,t2_7sy3jkb6,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,
