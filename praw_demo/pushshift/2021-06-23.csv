The issues are these:

  
Britain has done vaccinations according to age group, which has been extremely successful at reducing hospitalisations. However, because most people socialise with those who are their own age, it means that the virus can still cause significant outbreaks among younger sections of the population, since it's spreading through completely unprotected groups of people. As I understand it, a lot of the outbreaks are now in neighbourhoods with a lot of student housing.

Britain also has a large South Asian population with strong links to their home countries and substantial travel back and forth from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. That means delta variant cases were seeded in higher numbers than in other Western countries. This demographic is also substantially younger, more likely to live in crowded housing and slightly more likely to refuse the vaccine when compared to the British average.

Vaccination has now been opened up to all adults, and there have been special efforts to increase vaccination in areas that have been particularly badly affected.

Some good news is that the outbreaks of the delta variant that we're seeing seem to end quite quickly. Bolton was the first town to have a big outbreak of the variant, and cases there have been going down for some time now. Nearby Blackburn is also seeing a drop-off.

Roughly around the time the general public was able to be vaccinated. To the vast majority of armchair scientists in this sub, that translates, somehow, into 'pandemic over'. Now if you even mention thinking about keeping masks but open *everything else* you get downvoted to oblivion for 'fear mongering'.

It's just basic science. Shit I learned early on in high school. In other countries individuals mask up just fine when they're not feeling too good and have for years. But tell 'muricans to wear masks until everyone has a chance to get vaccined (even if you explicitly say to *literally* drop every other mandate) and they get all pissy because that's not 'normal' enough for them. 

A pathetic opinion from a bunch of selfish children imo; masks really are nothing to complain about. Especially since the people that are still advocating for them at least just want them in places people have to go to. Like grocery stores so if they need to bring their kid they don't need to worry about them getting infected. Which is also why we should be pumping a fuckton more money into our education system. It's sad so many people don't understand the basic properties of any virus.

Essentially to mostly everyone in this sub: availability of vaccines + declining numbers = pandemic over. *Anyone* who says otherwise is just 'fear mongering'.

It's slightly more effective at evading vaccine (or previous infection) neutralization but both still prevent it ~88% of the time.  The S.African variant (beta) was significantly more effective at evading neutralization cutting efficio down to ~60% or so.  Luckily, that variant doesn't spread nearly as quickly as the UK (alpha) which has been prevalent for while so it has been outcompeted. Only about 2% of positive cases in the US are beta/W.African.
  
The main prob w delta then, is that it spreads QUICK.  It's picking off the vulnery people and spiking numbers. That's what's going on.  Once it's become dominant things will settle.  
  
  It remains to be seen if the mRNA protection the USA has  rolled out will hold off Delta from becoming a major problem for those who won't get vaccinated.  But it's really not a game changer for those vaccinated.  Based on efficiency we should expect ~1 vaccinated person to become infected for ever 20 or so unvaccinated.

The decision followed a warning by Prime Minister Naftali Bennett on Tuesday over new outbreaks caused by the Delta variant, with daily infections rising after weeks of low plateau credited to Israel's record mass-vaccination drive.


Under the updated Health Ministry directives, vaccinated or formerly infected people can be ordered to self-isolate for up to 14 days if authorities believe they may have been in ""close contact with a carrier of a dangerous virus variant"".

Such proximity could include having been passengers on the same plane, the ministry said - a possible dampener on Israel's gradual opening of its borders to vaccinated summer tourists.

Addressing parliament, Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz said fines of ""thousands of shekels"" would also be levied against Israeli citizens or residents who travel to countries blacklisted as high COVID-19 risks.

On June 16, the Health Ministry listed Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, India, Mexico and Russia as off-limits to Israeli citizens or residents unless they receive special permission.

Some 55% of Israel's 9.3 million population have received both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech (PFE.N), (22UAy.DE) vaccine, and a steep drop in cases had prompted most economic restrictions to be lifted.

Eligibility for the shots was extended to 12- to 15-year-olds last month but turnout in that age group has been low. Alarmed by contagions in two Israeli schools last week, Bennett urged parents to vaccinate their adolescents.

The Health Ministry said on Wednesday that parents of children who violate quarantine would face fines of 5,000 shekels ($1,540).

Bennett said a new ""corona cabinet"", or ministerial task force to deal with the pandemic, would be established as part of the new government sworn in this month.

($1 = 3.2523 shekels)

Sequencing is a slow process where you end up making a thorough analysis of the virus sample you have to determine if you’re facing a genome you’ve already encountered or if it’s a new one.
On that matter yes, the U.K. is pretty much leagues ahead of everyone.

The screening on another hand is the process of adding an extra step to a positive PCR test to classify which kind of Covid we already know, it belongs to with simple reactives.
This could be made within hours and applied for basically all tests.
And when it comes to screening, France is pretty much on par with the rest of European countries and does screen the vast majority of tests coming to the labs.

So in a nutshell, yes we suck at sequencing, but that’s more relevant when you’re watching for new variants not those we already familiar with.

You've seen it yourself; when there has been a rise in cases in certain cities, precautions have been put in place to slow down those numbers.

Also, you state that I'm misrepresenting your argument followed by the suggestion that I'm enjoying how life is right now - of course I'm not.

The Parlament is currently investigating the handling of the Federal goverment over Covid, and so far it seems like Bolsonaro has bet on contaminating people with covid to get herd immunity, while ignoring the companies trying to sell him vaccines. The president is also firing any Health Minister that tries to prevent people from getting sick, like [this](https://youtu.be/bru1ffScY-g) comedy sketch shows (turn on English subtitles). Bolsonaro is also angry at the Parliment for investigating him, accusing them of persecuting him.

He is incentivizing people to go against social distancing and wearing masks, the state governors are trying to help their people but Bolsonaro is seeing that as the state goverments going agaisnt him, so this has turned into a political fight. He is using that to fuel the narrative that he is being persecuted and that lockdowns and social distancing is what is causing the economy to go down and that makes his followers be mad at these health measures. São Paulo's governor and the former Governor of Rio are particularly angry at him and Bolsonaro is fighting them for political power. Rio's former governor has even said that he was imp34ched as a result of going agaisnt the president's wishes, so I think the presindent has gone too far now on his narrative and can't back down without looking like he is surrendering.

But here's the thing, Bolsonaro has a lot of followers, you can even see that the places that had the most votes for him are also the ones that have been affected the worse. He has been incentivising public demonstration of support from his followers ([without masks or social distancing](https://www.businessinsider.com/bolsonaro-fined-sao-paulo-skirting-local-mask-guidelines-2021-6)) and using the narrative that anyone who speaks agaisnt him is trying to tear him down and are being anti d3mocratic, and his voters eat it all up.

The state governors were the ones who did the bigger job at securing vaccines for their states, Bolsonaro is now accepting to buy vaccines from Pfizer (who tried selling us vaccines, but [Bolsonaro ignored](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/pfizer-got-no-response-offers-supply-vaccine-brazil-last-year-exec-says-2021-05-13/) them for months) due to political pressure, but too many lives have already been lost needlesly.

[],,LeafsInSix,,,[],,,,text,t2_49mmyaur,False,True,[],"It's not the vaccines themselves but which combinations would be accepted. Canada has been a true outlier (renegade?) when it comes to mass vaccination.

It's been only a few weeks ago since the default recommendation for inoculation in Canada is to stick to the manufacturer's instructions. That is to say, any Canadian getting a first shot of Pfizer or Moderna this month is eligible to get the second shot of it 3 to 4 weeks later. Before this month, the standard policy was to extend the gap to 16 weeks to stretch inadequate inventory and shield politicians from uncomfortable questions about a potential slowdown in vaccinating people.

This means that a lot of Canadians who will be ""fully vaccinated"" with Pfizer or Moderna will have received their two doses between 8 and 16 weeks apart. By the time the latest change in dosing gaps was announced several million of Canadians had already passed at least 8 weeks since getting their first shot. There's currently a Hunger Games-like scramble for us to rebook the appointments for our second shot. I'm currently scheduled to get my second dose of Pfizer in late September after getting the first one early this month. As of next week, I can try to rebook and might/should be able to reschedule it so that I'll get the second shot by the end of July (\~9 week gap) if not middle of August (\~12 week gap).

Another complication is in the combinations allowed. Because of our chaotic rollout which grossly prioritized giving first doses, Canadian health officials didn't reserve any shipments for giving out second doses. The whole program assumes that vaccine deliveries will be stable and predictable for the duration, so we're using Just-In-Time inventory modelling to run the process. Of course, this is very vulnerable to disruptions like the latest one where Pfizer has to reduce deliveries over the next few weeks because of production problems.

Like many European countries, the Canadian government allows for people who got a first shot of AZ to get a second one of Moderna or Pfizer. Didn't Merkel get a second shot of Moderna just yesterday after getting a first one of AZ?

However, the recent cutback in Pfizer's deliveries means that a lot of Canadians with the first dose of Pfizer and who expected to get the second dose of Pfizer this week or next are suddenly offered only Moderna for that second shot. The Canadian government and public health authorities have declared this kind of mixing to be safe only as of a few days ago, but they keep ignoring that no other country is doing this kind of mixing of mRNA vaccines on a wide scale. They have no answer at all for whether this mixing will be acceptable for full vaccination when travelling internationally over the next 12-18 months.

In the meantime, a lot of Canadians aren't taking any chances and cancelling their appointments this week or next because they do not want to get Moderna and find out later this year that their ""full vaccination"" as defined by the Canadian government is meaningless according to some government or border guard in Europe, Asia or anywhere else.",,,1624553280,{},h2wikl8,False,t3_o6dba6,False,True,t1_h2srft0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o6dba6/european_union_vaccine_passports_issued_in_17/h2wikl8/,1624843302,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

(First shot) 💉💪🩹,dark,text,t2_meeqp,False,False,[],"But the UK has fully vaccinated more people as a % of the total population for over 2 weeks now and they've been at quite a similar levels even longer compared with the US. On top of that, the UK has vaccinated significantly more overall, which helps as well. In the end, a large majority of states fare significantly worse than the UK when it comes to vaccinations for both partially and fully vaccinated. Cases are dropping now in these areas, but as delta becomes more and more dominant, how will the share of people fully vaccinated protect from a rise in cases, hospitalizations and deaths if the UK was not able to stop it with similar, if not higher, share of people fully vaccinated.

I am not saying that precautions should be taken. But I am saying that in an overwhelming majority of states there's basically nothing preventing from cases, hospitalisations and deaths rising as delta increases its share of infections. Perhaps only seasonality, but that should affect the UK as well.

There's a line break between them. And if you're going to respond like that to overlooking a link, I suppose there's not much left to guess about how rational the rest of your response is going to be.

&gt; Getting rid of symptomatic infection is not the goal with vaccines nor was it ever. People getting a running nose is not an issue, hospitalisation and death is.

Completely wrong on all counts.

Sterilizing immunity is the goal with many vaccines, though unfortunately, if it's unattainable in some cases -- like COVID, for the time being. When it's attainable, however, it's a great way to permanently wipe out a disease or at least safeguard regions against epidemics.

As for people getting a runny nose... that isn't an issue, right up until the moment they spread the disease to someone who's immunocompromised or isn't vaccinated. Then, it becomes an issue.

Not to mention that last week, 10% of hospitalizations in the UK were for fully vaccinated patients (2 doses and 14+ days). Because although the effectiveness against hospitalization is very good, it's not complete -- which means that large enough epidemics can still do plenty of damage even when a large portion of the population is vaccinated.

[Here's a study from last year on the effectiveness needed to prevent epidemics.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749379720302841) Quoting:

&gt; *""This study found that the vaccine has to have an efficacy of at least 70% to prevent an epidemic and of at least 80% to largely extinguish an epidemic without any other measures (e.g., social distancing).""*

The numbers will be different right now as the delta variant is more infectious, but the study shows quite well why a vaccine's effectiveness in preventing infection (rather than just hospitalization) is important: it actually helps stop the epidemic.

Moreover, let's not forget that large epidemics in regions with high vaccination rates form a perfect breeding ground for variants that do a better job at bypassing vaccine-conferred immunity. Which isn't a problem if vaccines help prevent the epidemic, rather than soften its consequences.

&gt; As the conclusion of this study says

As the numbers in the study say:

&gt; ""*With ChAdOx1 2 dose effectiveness reduced from 66.1% (95% CI: 54.0 to 75.0) with B.1.1.7 to 59.8% (95%CI: 28.9 to 77.3) with B.1.617.2.*""

&gt; 135 (17%) were more than 21 days after their first dose of vaccine

&gt; 84 (10%) were more than 14 days after their second dose

&gt; As of 14 June, there have been 73 deaths in England of people who were confirmed as having the Delta variant and who died within 28 days of a positive test, and of these:

&gt; 34 (47%) were unvaccinated

&gt; 10 (14%) were more than 21 days after their first dose of vaccine

&gt; 26 (36%) were more than 14 days after their second dose

These are actually very encouraging figures. You have to keep in mind that the demographics of those with two doses is vastly different to those with zero or one.

Those aged 50+ or with high-risk health conditions previously represented 80% of hospitalisations and 99% of deaths in the pre-vaccine waves.

The fact that people with two doses only make up 10% of the hospitalisation and 36% of deaths (rather than something much closer to 80% and 99%) is great news.

The Huanan market is not the prevailing narrative.

From the WHO covid origins report:

&gt;Many of the early cases were associated with the Huanan market, but a similar number of cases were associated with other markets and some were not associated with any markets. Transmission within the wider community in December could account for cases not associated with the Huanan market which, together with the presence of early cases not associated with that market, could suggest that the Huanan market was not the original source of the outbreak. Other milder cases that were not identified, however, could provide the link between the Huanan market and early cases without an apparent link to the market. No firm conclusion therefore about the role of the Huanan market in the origin of the outbreak, or how the infection was introduced into the market, can currently be drawn.

continuing with your comment

&gt;since it's fairly clear that those cases had mutations already compared to other samples from other places in Wuhan

It was already known from the WHO report that there were already other mutation variants outside of the market in Wuhan early in the pandemic:

&gt;To analyse the viral genomes and epidemiological data from the early phase of the outbreak, the team reviewed data collected through the China National Centre for Bioinformation integrated database on all available coronaviruses sequences and their metadata. All sequence data from samples collected in December 2019 and January 2020 were subjected to deeper analysis to see the diversity of viruses in the first phases of the outbreak. For the cases detected in Wuhan, data on samples from cases with illness onset before 31 December 2019 were linked with epidemiological background data. Several samples from patients with exposure to the Huanan market had identical virus genomes, suggesting that they may have been part of a cluster. However, the sequence data also showed that some diversity of viruses already existed in the early phase of the outbreak in Wuhan, suggesting unsampled chains of transmission beyond the Huanan market cluster. There was no obvious clustering by the epidemiological parameters of exposure to raw meat or furry animals.",,,1624491035,{},h2tr0za,False,t3_o6le5o,False,False,t1_h2ta1qz,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o6le5o/scientist_finds_early_virus_sequences_that_had/h2tr0za/,1624787431,27,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The biodistribution data on it has been clear for a short while now. The LNP-DNA complex does not exclusively stay at the injection site and it's very good at passing the body's compartmentalization barriers, including the blood-brain barrier, many sites have been observed to have both LNP-mRNA complex presence and the subsequent expression of the protein on the cells of the organ (checked through luciferase expression). The liver seems to have the second-highest concentration. The second link I've posted shows that this is acknowledged and currently being studied by the British Health Authorities. It's a gov PDF assessing the current studies on COVID Vaccines, if you search for biodistribution you can see what I'm talking about. 


The research is ongoing of course. but I personally think biodistribution research should have been done quicker. I didn't like how the CDC cancelled the June 18th emergency meeting on the increase in morbidity caused by the vaccine in younger populations.

""When we examined the death table, we saw that the number of deaths in citizens over the age of 65 was twice as high.  
We are witnessing that vaccines significantly limit deaths.  


We lost about 50 thousand people during the epidemic. Although heart attack diagnoses decreased by 50 percent during the epidemic, deaths due to heart attacks increased by more than 10 percent.  
We run one of the fastest vaccination programs in the world. They didn't believe me when I said, 'We can make 1.5 million doses of vaccine a day'. Thanks to their souls.  
We found that the number of deaths over the age of 65 increased more than 45 days after suffering the disease. The next 3 years will pass by compensating for this damage.  
Although it is not possible to predict what kind of side diseases will occur during the next three years, 3-4 times more deaths are expected. This is an extremely sad painting.  
Especially in this period, we want to rapidly vaccinate our citizens aged 18 and over. The sooner we can do this, the faster we will achieve herd immunity.  


As of Friday, we will have defined the vaccinations of all our citizens who have reached the age of 18.  


100 million doses of Sinovac vaccine were supposed to arrive. The amount received is 34 million. 4.5 million doses of vaccine came from Biontech. It may take the first 4 days of July to reach 30 million.  


400 thousand doses have arrived Sputnik V vaccine has arrived.

In the next period, we can reduce the 6-week period between the two vaccines to 4 weeks.

The phase 3 study of the domestic vaccine will be carried out on 40,800 people in 29 centers.

Until now, we were supposed to receive 100 million sinovacs. The amount of vaccines received so far has reached 34 million. Biontech has received 24.5 million vaccines so far. Another 5 million doses will arrive on Monday and Tuesday. Uğur teacher is trying to focus on it sensitively.  
We apply quarantine to some countries for 14 days. As of July 1, we will have detailed this a little more, maybe it may be necessary to impose a ban in some countries.  
We intend to vaccinate people under the age of 18 with chronic conditions. However, there is no clarity.

Wanting to manage your own risk engagement is not unreasonable, especially when it comes to medical interventions administered to an individual.  Safety concerns ARE valid.

I got my first shot of moderna in January.  As a healthcare worker, it was offered to me early and I was literally the first person I know to take it.  I remember at the time, being first in line-ish, doing a bunch of research on the safety and health implications of the vaccine.  At the time, all the news articles, include every single one posted in this sub, said the vaccines were totally safe and only carried a slight risk of anaphylactic response for people who are allergic.  But, I read, that would occur within the first 15 minutes and could quickly and easily be treated.  And after those 15 mins, you were 100% safe, and there was no risk of side effects after.  I know for a fact that blood clots and myocarditis were never mentioned.  I would have remembered if that was the case.

Now that we are gradually seeing these side effects being reported as “blood clots/myocarditis rates higher than expected post vaccination” it’s obvious not all safety concerns were known, even during the time when I was assured by everyone in the news and everyone in this sub that the only possible side effect would be anaphylactic shock and nothing else.

It’s not unreasonable for the hesitant to want to wait a bit longer to see what else we discover about the vaccine before they decide to get jabbed.  That’s their decision to make, based on their own health history, susceptibility, etc, and whatever they decide is 100% valid and totally reasonable.  

The pharma corps that manufactured the vaccines have requested and been granted full immunity from liability before they even sent out the first batch to the public.  Insurance companies do not cover adverse effects or death resulting from vaccines.  There is a teenager who nearly died and incurred half a million dollars in hospital bills from being treated for a vaccine-induced blood clot.  They can’t afford to pay that and have put up a go-fund-me, but have only raised $50k.  No one pushing for everyone to get vaxxed is publicizing her go-fund-me to urge everyone to donate and support a teenager who got vaccinated “for the greater good” even though she personally had nearly zero risk from covid, probably because we believed the mantra that “we are all in this together”.  Except none of you covid vax pushers are supporting her now.  Nobody is even talking g about how to support people who suffer side effects from the vaccine.  The people who take the jab (myself include) assume 100% of the liability that insurance companies and Pfizer and moderna are unwilling to assume, and can’t depend on anyone else in society — not even you who urge everyone to take on the risk of vaccine side effects.  If the risks are the individual’s to bear alone, then the choice must be his/her alone as well.  Unless you’re offering to pay up, shut up.  You’re out of line trying to dictate choices for others unless you’re willing to put your money where your mouth is.",,,1624521054,{},h2v2s56,False,t3_o5yzio,False,True,t1_h2qtscy,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o5yzio/cdc_nearly_every_adult_covid19_death_is_now/h2v2s56/,1624814053,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Of course you have to be careful and have to consider the benefits and risks. But directly refusing any and all vaccines isn't reasonable, be it for religious or other reasons besides medical reasons. What YOU describe are medical reasons.

Also, another reason why you are on the wrong tangent... I'm not from the us. I'm German and we actually have a working healthcare system. None of the cases you describe would result in financial problems for the patient. That's why we have such a system. If everything is fine and you are healthy, you don't need anything. But the moment shit hits the fan, you and your life are f*cked without health insurance. Insurances are there for the situations when things are NOT okay, and that's why the absence of such a system is based on pure egoism. Here, we all pay for the few that get unlucky. That's fair.

And what we pay is based on the income we have, but all get the same treatment (unless they use private insurance, which is much more expensive overall, and it mostly addresses convenience things, like a room in the hospital where you are alone, not with another patient). That's also fair. It even has an upper limit, where you can debate if it's fair or not, i think it is fair because the treatment costs are already covered (average).


Another thing you apparently didn't realize: a scientist or doctor (particularly when involved in studies) will not tell you ""there are no complications"", because he doesn't know what. He will add ""that we know of"". 
The statistics for the events you describe are so low that for every (!!) age group, the risk of harm from COVID-19 it's higher than the combined risks of all relevant complications (beyond your immune systems normal activity and a sore arm) .

The rolling weekly average of new cases increased from 376 last week to 418 on Wednesday.

During the same period, other key figures — the number of patients with severe symptoms, those who required hospitalization, the percentage of test results that came back positive, among others — have largely plateaued or increased.

In general, increases in foot traffic in large cities across Japan have correlated with an uptick in new cases since the start of the pandemic.

The movement of residents in Tokyo, while momentarily wavering in the days before and after the capital’s emergency expired Sunday, has been increasing throughout this week, the capital’s infectious disease advisers said Thursday.

Hiroshi Nishiura, an epidemiologist at Kyoto University, said during the meeting the delta variant could account for almost 70% of new cases across the country by July 23, the day of the opening ceremony of the Tokyo Olympics.

The delta variant could account for half of all new cases in the greater Tokyo metropolitan area by early July, according to projections by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases.

Weeks after the central government began to incrementally lift the country’s second state of emergency in March, replacing it with quasi-emergency measures, an uptick in new cases quickly grew into a nationwide surge. The country’s fourth wave of infections overwhelmed hospitals in Osaka and Hyogo prefectures and pushed health care systems elsewhere to their limits, forcing officials to declare yet another state of emergency.

Experts fear another repeat.

“New cases have been increasing steadily despite the enforcement of quasi-emergency measures,” said Tokyo Deputy Gov. Mitsuchika Tarao on Thursday. Gov.

&gt; The Delta variant may be twice as transmissible as the conventional strain. But California and the rest of the nation are far more protected against COVID-19 than ever before. California has one of the highest vaccination rates in the nation, and the U.S. has one of the highest per capita rates of inoculation in the world.

&gt; And vaccines available in the U.S. are believed to be effective against the Delta variant, as they have been for all known variants. But that still leaves tens of millions of unvaccinated people still potentially vulnerable.

&gt; “If you’re vaccinated, it’s nothing,” UC San Francisco epidemiologist Dr. George Rutherford said of the Delta variant. “If you’re not vaccinated, you’re hosed.”

&gt; Officials don’t expect another deadly COVID-19 surge on the order of those that walloped the nation three times in the past 15 months. Rather, the risk is more that the Delta variant will take root in pockets of unimmunized communities that haven’t been previously been infected with the coronavirus.

&gt; This is the kind of future experts expect: one in which most of the population, who are vaccinated, are well protected against the world’s worst pandemic in the last century, while risks remain for those who aren’t vaccinated.

&gt; Now, “nearly every death due to COVID-19 is particularly tragic,” said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “because nearly every death — especially among adults — due to COVID-19 is, at this point, entirely preventable.”",,,1624557092,{},h2wrbbv,True,t3_o764vk,False,False,t3_o764vk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o764vk/delta_variant_is_spreading_in_california_as/h2wrbbv/,1624847970,15,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

""Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) is a relatively new field of study that looks at the interactions between your central nervous system (CNS) and your immune system. Researchers know that our CNS and immune system can communicate with each other, but they only recently started to understand how they do it and what it means for our health.

  


The nerves in your brain and spinal cord make up your CNS, while your immune system is made up of organs and cells that defend your body against infection. Both systems produce small molecules and proteins that can act as messengers between the two systems. In your CNS, these messengers include hormones and neurotransmitters. Your immune system, on the other hand, uses proteins called cytokines to communicate with your CNS.""

  


In theory this sounds solid, but if it's a legitimate field then how the hell does such a field legitimize the fact-free stance of the husband?

Yeah, EUA allows you to do all studies concurrently, which is how it gets the vaccine delivered faster. It does mean taking on some additional risk to the study volunteers, which they heroically took on.

But after that, the risk is precisely the same, as all animal testing as well as Phase I, II and III must be completed before EUA approval.

In Germany, the numbers of vaccinated are not that high (roughly 30% have two doses, &amp; roughly 50% have one shot). I personally know many people with some immune concerns who have only had one shot, and I'm sure there's plenty with none. I've only had one shot of Astra myself.

The Delta variant is particularly easy to spread, and it is apparently particularly good at infecting young people and those with only one shot. ""In the U.K., 31 percent of all confirmed Delta variant patients who needed emergency care had received at least one vaccine dose."" The second article cited below also says we single-Astra-shot people in Germany only have a 33% protection against the Delta variant. And the virus is much more effective at infecting and transmissible than every other variant seen so far. I'm glad Merkel is concerned about my health &amp; safety and is forcing at least a quarantine of those from the UK.

The vaccines are FREE in the US.  FREE FREE, not like ""Copay free"", like fuckin FREE. You don't need insurance. Go get one. Now.  Is there something stopping you from going to get one today? Talk to me about it, we'll get it worked out.  

If your doctor offers to give you the vaccine, take it, right away. It *will be absolutely free*. If you get a bill for the vaccine, call the cops or something, [it's *ILLEGAL* to charge you for the vaccine.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/nvzofq/government_warns_doctors_and_insurers_dont_bill/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

[Dose intervals might increase efficacy if extended past 3 or 4 weeks,](https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/mudvjd/questin_about_vaccine_intervals/gv58byt/) CDC says you have up to 42 days between doses (but that may be extended at some point).

**More variant stuff:**

Please don't say ""strain"" when you mean ""variant"". 

There [might not be much room left for SARS-CoV-2 to mutate](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/mpcc5k/weekly_question_thread_april_12_2021/gui5xn3/) into.

CDC [doesn't think](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n94zxm/no_evidence_that_pfizer_vaccine_needs_updating/) we'll need boosters/updates/etc for the mRNA vaccines.

Pfizer/Moderna work on the [Double/Triple/Indian Variant](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/n9q3q8/infection_and_vaccineinduced_neutralizing/).

Pfizer (and Moderna, probably) [works on B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 Variants](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/n5r2ry/effectiveness_of_the_bnt162b2_covid19_vaccine/)

And [B.1.617, the Indian/""double/triple mutant"" variant.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/nit1sr/covid19_pfizer_vaccine_nearly_90_effective/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

REMINDER: Every time we do a neutralization assay on a variant vs Pfizer/Moderna, we get the same result. [The vaccine wins.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/mwpijo/daily_discussion_thread_april_23_2021/gvkm64h/)

T-Cells are really important.  Probably [more important than antibodies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/n5015i/highly_functional_cellular_immunity_in_sarscov2/)

Moderna works great against variants, even [seven months out from the second dose.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ne0wx8/durability_of_mrna1273induced_antibodies_against/)

**The vaccine is better than the disease:**

[Penis issues from Covid](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/nbh3ez/covid19_endothelial_dysfunction_can_cause/) (but [not the vaccine\).](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/narbhn/researchers_report_covid19_found_in_penile_tissue/)

[Neurological problems](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/na1eri/82_of_people_hospitalized_with_covid19_develop/) from Covid Infection (but not the vaccine).

[Loss of smell](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n88qwv/daily_discussion_thread_may_09_2021/gxiiusd/) is both [common](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n6sj6g/daily_discussion_thread_may_07_2021/gxb6wah/) and way [more devastating](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n1efrf/joe_rogan_walks_back_antivaccination_comments/gwcvd0m/) than you'd think.  This does not occur with the vaccines.

Loss of smell [really sucks.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/nqkiz5/cdc_touts_smell_training_after_covid19_but_it/) There's a whole subreddit about it ([anosmia](https://www.reddit.com/r/anosmia/comments/nkcta1/3_months_and_minimal_recovery/)), and the people who didn't lose their sense of smell from Covid are tired of everyone asking Covid-loss-of-smell questions.  

[Fewer symptoms = less spread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/n6sj6g/daily_discussion_thread_may_07_2021/gxbfbt1/)  Vaccines make you have fewer symptoms (*if* you get an infection after vaccination).

If you got infected, recovered, and then got at least one dose of Pfizer, you have immunity not only to multiple variants, but also SARS-CoV-1, the virus for which we named SARS in 2003.  Turns out much of [the ""breadth"" of that immunity is from the vaccine.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/net65c/sarscov2_mrna_vaccines_induce_a_greater_array_of/)

[Truly asymptomatic people don't spread the virus much.  People who are pre-symptomatic, and do go on to have symptoms, can be really good spreaders.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ncsstr/daily_discussion_thread_may_15_2021/gy7idau/)

Another Pfizer vs Variant round. [Pfizer works on the Indian variant.

Yes, there's a risk of a Super Duper variant emerging from this pool of infected, although that risk shrinks as the pool of potential victims is far smaller than it would be if it was raging through an entirely unvaccinated population. 

For the unvaccinated adults out there, there's really not much that can be done outside of maybe employer vaccine mandates. They've been pleaded to with science, they've been offered cash/guns/chances at 1 million dollars, but that video they watched on Facebook that says that the vaccines will ""remove God from your DNA"" sure did sound convincing, so they won't be getting it.

**People with progressive MS,** those who are older, those who have a higher level of physical disability, those with certain medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, heart and lung disease, pregnancy), and Black and Hispanic populations are among groups with the highest risk for hospitalization due to COVID-19. Individuals in these **high-risk groups are especially encouraged to get vaccinated.**

&amp;#x200B;

**COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS**  


[https://www.nationalmssociety.org/coronavirus-covid-19-information/multiple-sclerosis-and-coronavirus/covid-19-vaccine-guidance](https://www.nationalmssociety.org/coronavirus-covid-19-information/multiple-sclerosis-and-coronavirus/covid-19-vaccine-guidance)

This guidance applies to people with MS ages 12 and older and only for the vaccines authorized for use for their age in the United States, Pfizer BioNTech, Moderna and Janssen/J&amp;J.  
**People with MS should be vaccinated against COVID-19**  
The science has shown us that the COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. Like other medical decisions, the decision to get a vaccine is best made in partnership with your healthcare provider. Most people with relapsing and progressive forms of MS should be vaccinated. The risks of COVID-19 outweigh any potential risks from the vaccine. In addition, members of the same household and close contacts should also be vaccinated against COVID-19 when available to decrease the impact of the virus.  
***People with progressive MS, those who are older, those who have a higher level of physical disability, those with certain medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, heart and lung disease, pregnancy), and Black and Hispanic populations are among groups with the highest risk for hospitalization due to COVID-19. Individuals in these high-risk groups are especially encouraged to get vaccinated.***  
The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna) require two doses and you need to get both doses to be maximally protected. The vector vaccine (J&amp;J) requires a single dose. Whether you receive the Pfizer BioNTech, Moderna or J&amp;J vaccine, it takes two weeks after being fully vaccinated before you are considered protected.  
If you’ve had COVID-19 and recovered, you should also get the vaccine. We don’t know how well protected people are after COVID-19 infection, or how long this protection might last. People who have had COVID-19 infection in the past can get infected again.  
**The COVID-19 vaccines are safe for people with MS**  
None of the available vaccines contain live virus and the vaccines will not cause COVID-19. The vaccines are not likely to trigger an MS relapse or have any impact on long-term disease progression. The risk of getting COVID-19 far outweighs any risk of having an MS relapse from the vaccine. Learn more about how mRNA vaccines (Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna) and vector vaccines (J&amp;J) work from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  
    
Any vaccine can cause side effects, including a fever. A fever can make your MS symptoms worse temporarily, but they should return to prior levels after the fever is gone.

We should be looking at this from as many angles and possible treatment methods as possible using all of the tools in our toolbox.

Why on earth wouldn’t we look into this possibility further? If Ivermectin needs more testing/data, why wouldn’t we pursue it?

Like it or not, these vaccines have no long term data to refer to when it comes to possible side effects.

If you get vaccinated, you are choosing to put something into your body that you cannot take out.

You can choose to get vaccinated whenever you’d like, you cannot choose to get unvaccinated.

I’d rather wait and see more data, more long term results, and for more effective, possibly safer alternatives, and because of the area in which I live, I’m confident that I have the privilege of being able to safely wait a little bit longer than some other folks.

I know I’ll get downvotes for this opinion, but there has been a censorship of true discussion and debate regarding the mRNA vaccines, and of the therapeutic and prophylactic use of Ivermectin, which is being used in Slovenia, North Africa, Brazil, and Mexico among other countries with very promising results.

Why on earth would we decide to shun and censor any discussion about the possibility of an alternative treatment, one with decades of use and data that many anti-vaxxers would be more comfortable with using, if we truly and honestly cared about crushing this virus as quickly as possible?

Again I suggest you read the article - it is doing no such thing. The point it's making is that the pandemic no longer affects the US and other wealthy countries because they've taken advantage of their wealth and widely distributed vaccines among their own people while poorer countries are struggling. Maybe you interpreted that as ""shaming them back indoors,"" but there's really nothing in the article to suggest that. 

&gt;In the global scramble for Covid vaccines, high-income countries, predictably, have sought to secure stocks for their own populations first. It has created a situation in which millions of people have received doses in countries such as the U.S., the U.K. and China, largely thanks to the domestic development of vaccines and by striking advance purchase agreements with manufacturers.

&gt;By comparison, parts of Africa, Asia and the Pacific Islands have recorded low vaccination rates to date. Less wealthy countries are relying on Covax, the WHO’s vaccine-sharing initiative.

If you watched the CDC presentation yesterday they said in summary that a lot of the information provided on the heart risk was just first shot stats at this time. Also as stated males have higher rates of it.

I think what people aren't focusing on is one of 4 things in my opinion and pro vax or anti vax the CDC should still provide guidance

1. Is the death rate higher than the seasonal flu for the 0-16 age group? If it is or isn't is flu more harmful to that age group? If so we should mandate a flu vaccine.
2. If point 1 is off then is the associated health risk because of young adults being carriers? For example do we accept the risk because we are in a pandemic? (they partly answered this)
3. Why do females have a lower risk? There wasn't a concrete answer.

(Many people mistakenly believe that children literally can’t catch COVID-19—in reality they can and do, and though the rates are lower than adults many children are hospitalized, need ICU care, and/or die, and it looks like rates of *long-term health problems* following infection are nearly as high for children as for adults.)

Here’s an up-to-date article on [UK vaccination rates](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55274833); no one under 18 is vaccinated, and few under 50, and they’ve been using a modified schedule for 2nd shots so people have been going 2-3 months with only 1 shot.

Then you have people in urban centers who had vastly different experiences depending on how big their city was, what state in was in, and their state's response and restrictions. 

Here in the midwest, we had *very* few cases when we followed the lead of other states and locked down. We all know why we did it, the virus was unknown and we thought we could stop it in its tracks. Instead it just made everyone fed up with the situation from the beginning. Once the lockdown ended, many people thought the worst was already over. When that turned out to not be the case, they waited for the vaccine. 

The media has done more harm than good. THe politics on the issue as well. Republicans claimed Trump was responsible for the vaccine, then when it came time to take one most Republicans I knew were more skeptical than anyone on taking it. 

 Where I live most of our covid restrictions ended last month. People arent social distancing, wont use a mask since its not required, and have moved on with their lives.

But that 0.6% greatly undersells its effect on life expectancy.  These are deaths that could otherwise live for 70 or 80 years.  Someone dying in their 50s or 60s would only have 15 or 20 years remaining.  Each one of those infant deaths is weighted much heavier.",,,1624557984,{},h2wtc0b,False,t3_o6rqdu,False,True,t1_h2wpnst,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o6rqdu/us_life_expectancy_decreased_by_an_alarming/h2wtc0b/,1624849043,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt; Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today affirmed its position regarding use of ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

&gt; * No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

&gt; * No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;

&gt; * A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.

&gt; We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.

This has already affected vaccination policy with e.g. the UK delaying vaccinating under 18s because they intend to reduce R0 below 1 with other measures so that doses can go to more vulnerable people in other countries first.

Some countries will get there, and beyond, using vaccines alone, others will get there via immunity by infection on top of vaccinations, other countries will be kinda fucked.

The advantage with this now is that increasing R0 has diminishing returns. R0 increasing by 50% again to 9 would require 88.9% immunity, a 5.6% jump compared to the 8.3% necessary between alpha and delta. To an extent that 5.6% may end up being easier to convince because a virus with an R0 of 9 would absolutely decimate unvaccinated communities whilst vaccinated people would be left relatively untouched.

&gt;More than 177 million people have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine in the United States, and CDC continues to monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines for any health problems that happen after vaccination.

&gt;Since April 2021, there have been more than a thousand reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) of cases of inflammation of the heart—called myocarditis and pericarditis—happening after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (i.e., Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna) in the United States.

&gt;These reports are rare, given the hundreds of millions of vaccine doses administered, and have been reported after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, particularly in adolescents and young adults. View the latest information.

&gt;CDC and its partners are actively monitoring these reports, by reviewing data and medical records, to learn more about what happened and to understand any relationship to COVID-19 vaccination.
&gt; Most patients who received care responded well to treatment and rest and quickly felt better.

&gt; Confirmed cases have occurred:

  * Mostly in male adolescents and young adults age 16 years or older
 * More often after getting the second dose than after the first dose of one of these two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines
 * Typically within several days after COVID-19 vaccination
 * Patients can usually return to their normal daily activities after their symptoms improve. They should speak with their doctor about return to exercise or sports.

&gt; CDC continues to recommend COVID-19 vaccination for everyone 12 years of age and older, given the risk of COVID-19 illness and related, possibly severe complications.

They should definitely let people know of any and all potential risks, just like any medicine, but people are fearmongering like any young male is going to end up dying from the vaccine rather than the VERY small chance of even having the vaccine combine with the even smaller chance of having it be more than a mild, treatable issue.",,,1624563351,{},h2x5ax2,False,t3_o6zl7y,False,True,t1_h2x3i4u,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o6zl7y/benefits_of_covid_vaccine_far_outweigh_rare_small/h2x5ax2/,1624855472,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Ash said that the government is working on bringing more Pfizer vaccines to Israel. If Israel is unsuccessful in attaining new vaccines, it will run out in July, when Israel's store of vaccines is set to expire.

Ash added that Israel is investigating new ""technological tools"" to enforce coronavirus quarantines, citing Israel's previous attempts to employ electronic tracking bracelets. ""We will bring forward new proposals in the technological arena. The Shin Bet tracking did not deal with enforcing quarantine, and so, for the time being, we don't plan on implementing it,"" Ash said.

Despite the dangers of the new COVID variants, the government doesn't plan to prohibit Israelis from leaving and entering the country, Ash said. ""We are trying to avoid that (scenario) by testing and isolating"" people, he said.

""The current outbreak started as a local one, and we have seen several of those, but I can't say for sure that we are in a general outbreak. We will see if we can put out these small fires or if it will ignite a bigger blaze,"" Ash added.

Israel's Health Ministry registered 148 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, the highest daily increase since May, as the infectious delta variant makes further headway across the country.

Also on Thursday, a senior official with Pfizer Israel said that the company's vaccine is 90 percent effective in preventing symptomatic coronavirus cases, and 95 percent effective in preventing serious cases that require hospitalization. However, the effectivity of the vaccine in preventing infection and transmission is still unclear.

The northern city of Binyamina has been declared ""red"" on Israel's so-called traffic light system, reflecting a relatively high rate of coronavirus infection, amid a new uptick in cases.

Prof. Ran Balicer, the chief of the professional coronavirus cabinet which advises the Israel's coronavirus cabinet, told Kan public radio that he believes that there will be more localities to face restrictions in the coming days, but played down the prospects of a further lockdown.

Earlier, Prof. Chezy Levy, the director general of the Health Ministry, told the radio station that the ministry will soon know the breakdown of the numbers – how many of those diagnosed had returned from abroad, for instance, and how many were unvaccinated children. But, he added that ""the wave of infections is continuing regardless.""

When asked how many of the new coronavirus patients have been vaccinated, Levy said that ""We're looking at a rate of 40 to 50 percent,"" and said that the figure is concerning.

""Even though the numbers are low, the fact that this is reaching vaccinated people means…that we are still checking how many vaccinated people have also been infected,"" Levy added.

The increased infection is attributed to the spread of the delta variant of the coronavirus in the country – a strain first identified in India.

According to the agency, the plant called Pharmastandard-UfaVITA had a chance of cross-contamination, was not sterile enough, and did not place enough emphasis on traceability of individual doses. In the factory, agents made elsewhere are poured into vials.  
According to the operator, the problems that have arisen have already been rectified and they would be happy to have another inspection.  
""We will continue to strive for full transparency and continue the WHO licensing process""  
\- states the factory statement.  
According to a spokesman for the Russian government, all problems have been eliminated. Nevertheless, the Russian population is not particularly enthusiastic about the vaccine: five months after the start of the vaccination campaign, 18 million of the 144 million received at least one dose of the vaccine.

**I think we can relax in some situations (vaccinated people, somewhat limited contacts) until the picture is clearer**.

I'm not sure whether there is clear data on how infectious Delta is to vaccinated people. **People with 2 shots, though, have had to visit the hospital very infrequently.** My understanding is that most vaccinated people who catch Delta tend to be asymptomatic or have minor symptoms BUT (it's a big one) that does not totally prevent you from having consequences from it. Of course, I would guess that the worse it hits you, the worse those consequences would be. This part is the reason why we have to be cautious, I think.

The problem is that all nuance seems to be lost, now it's suddenly a ""numbers are low, we can afford some to get sick while everyone vaccinates"". That's my beef. The criteria to open should be more people vaccinated, not less people sick/dying.

4 days ago German TV was talking about a 8% spread in Germany, now it's 15%. Also, we are starting to hear about a Delta+ variant. Why are we being so hasty?

The risk of myocarditis only really comes up for males at age 16 and decays from there.  This shows a strong correlation with male sex hormones.  

A reasonable expectation is for the lower rate of myocarditis for both sexes ages 12 to 15 will hold for younger children.  This points to a strategy of preferential vaccination of younger children.  

As there have been no deaths associated with myocarditis from mRNA vaccines, the risk of vaccination is lower than the risk of getting COVID19.

tl;dr: Most of the COVID-19 vaccines are great! This wasn’t assured from the beginning or even on the basis of the trial data alone. 

RNA therapeutics appear to be safe, effective and powerful, but history is littered with drugs/interventions that made their way through clinical trials only to be discovered to be of little benefit (Zetia) or actually more dangerous than disclosed (Vioxx). 

Further, the vaccine trials weren’t designed to identify &gt;4 sigma harms (1 in ~15k) and that matters when a population on the order of a billion will receive the intervention. 

Additionally, prior infection and autoimmune disease were exclusion criteria for Pfizer and Moderna’s trials. Very few folks with positive COVID-19 IgG slipped through into these trials (on the order of 100s of patients). For a disease where antibody enhanced disease was a reasonable theoretical concern and it is likely that the true rate of prior infection is likely much higher than the observed rate,  generalizability of the trial was by no means assured. 

As the dust has settled with widespread vaccination, these vaccines appear quite safe (though associated with unpleasant systemic adverse effects for a sizable minority of patients) and _might_ even be therapeutic for COVID long haulers.

There are a couple of issues surrounding this:
1) the COVID vaccines are still under an emergent use approval from the FDA, which is different than other vaccination requirements that health providers are requiring as a condition of employment
2) The DOL (department of labor) has not had any guidance surrounding the legality of requiring an emergent use vaccine as a condition of employment…until a few weeks ago. 

There are legal cases already surrounding this issue where courts have already sided with healthcare facilities and businesses that are early adopters of requiring the COVID vaccine as a condition of employment around the country. It is moving the correct direction. 

We should see at least the Pfizer full FDA approval in the next month or two. There is enough actual world data to support approval and they have submitted their full application for governmental approval. This will enable businesses to require vaccination as a condition of employment. 

Also, OSHA just came out with their new rules surrounding COVID precautions this week (yeah, it’s a year late) and it does require organizations to create a policy response surrounding COVID mitigation. Some of the requirements are too old and science/evidence has borne out that some of the requirements are no longer needed if you’re vaccinated. Organizations will need to policify their response to the new rules and either accept or have science based evidence to support whether or not they will follow the rules (ie you don’t need to socially distance if your vaccinated). This is a big step in putting in vaccination requirements in at organizations without legal repercussions from employees. 

Ultimately, once the FDA gives full, unconditional approval for the vaccine(s) there is enough legal protection for employers to require vaccines as a condition for employment. (IMO).  Until this happens, I don’t think we will see widespread requirements around vaccination status.  (FYI, my hospital organization is working on a plan to require staff to submit proof of vaccination that will be rolled out in the next couple of weeks to our internal employee health department, we are anticipating this change and moving towards it).",,,1624546117,{},h2w2eno,False,t3_o6zjam,False,False,t3_o6zjam,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o6zjam/florida_hospitals_dont_require_and_often_arent/h2w2eno/,1624834391,22,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Get to go maskless pretty much anywhere.

&gt;According to the latest figures from Public Health England (PHE), four weeks after one dose, either vaccine offered almost 50% protection against the Alpha variant. However for the Delta variant this protection was lower, with one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab offering about 36% protection against symptomatic disease. For one dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine this figure was about 30%.

&gt; Two weeks after the second dose, the differences in vaccine effectiveness by variant were more modest, with the Pfizer/BioNTech jab offering 88% protection against symptomatic disease with the Delta variant, compared with 94% protection against the Alpha variant. For the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, the figures were 67% and 74% respectively.

With the mRNA vaccine--such as Pfizer's--when injected into the arm, the assumption and intention is that the lipid nano particles encasing the mRNA will express the mRNA on cells within the injection site. But the reality is that studies have been coming out showing that the lipid nano particles along with mRNA are being found concentrated in basically all the organs including the brain. So the question I have is this: is that evidence of mRNA being expressed on cells outside the arm injection site? Because if so, that would be problematic as I don't want mRNA being expressed on my brain cells, for example. Because then my brain cells would express the coronavirus spike protein per the mRNA instructions, thus provoking an immune response and causing my immune system to attack and kill those cells.

I'm worried that something like this could, THEORETICALLY, contribute to some degenerative mental disease like Alzheimer's many years down the road, for example.

If the answer to this is, ""No, that's not what happens; what you're seeing are just the inactive remnants of liquid nano particles and mRNA being flushed out system""--or SOMETHING--that would solve that issue for me.

&gt; It does look like it will rapidly become the dominant variant in the US. I don't know however how much of a surge to expect due to it. We've had steady decline in national case counts. I'd expect this decline to at least slow and have more of a tail or follow the UK and reverse.

We're currently seeing the start of a surge in Israel and a more pronounced surge in the UK. We haven't seen the same in the US yet, and the short version is that no one is quite sure if it's just in the future or won't happen due to conditions being different somehow.

The worrying early data in the US is charts like [this](https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1407466058617737219/photo/1) showing Delta (purple) clearly increasing quickly when you filter it out of the rest of the COVID cases... but it's hard to tell for sure how much it's adding cases that wouldn't have happened as opposed to just replacing cases that would have been a different variant if Delta weren't around. But looking at other countries we can guess there's enough of the former to matter.

Vaccine evasion doesn't seem to be a major issue at the moment (Pfizer is claiming 88% against Delta as opposed to 95% from the original study, so do remember that vaccines work well but they aren't 100%), but it doesn't have to be as there's no vaccines approved for children under 12, so there's plenty of unvaccinated hosts available for the virus.",,,1624566171,{},h2xbi5p,False,t3_o6vle3,False,False,t1_h2wjnzf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/o6vle3/daily_discussion_thread_june_24_2021/h2xbi5p/,1624858737,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,
