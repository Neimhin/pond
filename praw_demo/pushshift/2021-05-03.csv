first question i answered: why would someone with covid related anxiety avoid indoor dining at first even if they're vaccinated?

my answer: because, in terms of risk of infection, for the past year or so, before the effects of vaccine rollout, it's been a dangerous setting. so someone with anxiety is pretty likely to avoid it at first, probably depending on factors like community spread (and hospital pressure) or restaurant specifics (say, some place widely known for not caring about restrictions during the past year). even if maybe someone in their household hasn't been vaxxed yet or can't be vaxxed.

&gt;We’re talking about treating very, very large populations, which means that you’re going to see the usual run of mortality and morbidity that you see across large samples. Specifically, if you take 10 million people and just wave your hand back and forth over their upper arms, in the next two months you would expect to see about 4,000 heart attacks. About 4,000 strokes. Over 9,000 new diagnoses of cancer. And about 14,000 of that ten million will die, out of usual all-causes mortality. No one would notice. That’s how many people die and get sick anyway.

&gt;But if you took those ten million people and gave them a new vaccine instead, there’s a real danger that those heart attacks, cancer diagnoses, and deaths will be attributed to the vaccine. I mean, if you reach a large enough population, you are literally going to have cases where someone gets the vaccine and drops dead the next day (just as they would have if they *didn’t* get the vaccine). It could prove difficult to convince that person’s friends and relatives of that lack of connection, though.

[],,rman18,,,[],,,,text,t2_afjae,False,False,[],"*The Biden administration is supporting Pfizer Inc.’s move to begin exporting U.S.-made doses of its coronavirus vaccine, as the White House starts to unleash production for shot-starved* nations abroad.

“We are glad to see that they are working with other countries to help them meet their supply needs,” Jeff Zients, President Joe Biden’s Covid-19 response coordinator, told Bloomberg News in a statement. He said the company is ahead of schedule in its commitments to supply the U.S.

The governments of Mexico and Canada said last week that they expected to begin receiving doses of Pfizer’s vaccine from the U.S., the first time the company’s American-made shots are known to have been delivered to any buyer other than the American government.

Zients’s statement is the first indication that the administration won’t stand in the way of exports of Pfizer’s product that doesn’t pass through their hands directly.

Pfizer said in a statement that it has started exporting U.S.-made vaccine, but declined to specify when or to which countries. “We will continue to use our global supply chain to ship vaccine doses to governments, delivering on our commitments and ensuring a continued reliable and equitable rollout,” according to the statement

Pfizer rose 3% in New York trading on Monday, while its vaccine partner, BioNTech SE’s American depositary receipts rose about 11%.

Vaccine shortages worldwide have spurred some countries and blocs to impose export restrictions, limiting the ability of manufacturers to send their product across borders in some cases.

Early U.S. production wasn’t subject to an export ban but was gobbled up entirely by the government, which used wartime powers to prioritize its orders, cornering the market on domestic production. That allowed the U.S. to race ahead of peers, but spurred calls to do more to distribute doses in countries without their own production.",,,1620094896,{},gwuzi07,True,t3_n4dots,False,False,t3_n4dots,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n4dots/white_house_backs_pfizers_move_to_begin_vaccine/gwuzi07/,1620134066,29,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

*pp are* [*percentage points*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point)*, the arithmetic difference between today's percentage and a prior date.  For example, if a group was 55.0% today and 50.0% before, this is a 5.0 pp difference.*

Notes:

* The raw data can be downloaded exact totals for every age group can be downloaded from the [CDC vaccination demographic trends page](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-demographics-trends) as a CSV.  The CDC indicates the data is by ""Date Administered"", but it actually appears to be by ""Date Reported"".
* Texas (about 9% of US population) is excluded from CDC demographic data, so the tables do not match national totals.
* The CDC reports vaccinations for the 0-17 age group. The 16-17 age group is calculated using 2019 Census estimates that about 11.4% of those aged 0 to 17 are ages 16 and 17, assuming that all 0-17 age group doses were given to those ages 16 or 17.",,,1620094556,{},gwuytr2,False,t3_n4bj6b,False,False,t3_n4bj6b,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n4bj6b/us_administers_2468_mln_doses_of_covid19_vaccines/gwuytr2/,1620133675,25,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

So I can understand how some people might think, well, maybe I will just keep wearing it, because they like that feeling of security and they want to envision themselves remaining safe and secure in the future. 

But in reality, I think that as the world returns to post-pandemic normal (which is going to happen regardless of social media naysayers), mask mandates will eventually be discontinued and the majority of people will stop wearing them on a regular basis. (Maybe people will still wear them when sick, which I would consider an overall positive.) People will not need the masks to feel secure/safe from covid anymore and I think even a lot of the hardcore ""I WILL WEAR A MASK FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE"" people will quietly put them away.

Most continued going to restraunts, traveling, and going to bars. Seeing how many people werent willing to make sacrifices in their lives for the good of everyone else ruined my perception of people. I don't want to be around those people. Its infuriating to see them live so care free when so many have died.

Change of social routine incurs a cost- a social cost specifically.

Our system of neofeudal hypercapitalism ties these activities you mention to social legitimacy. In fact, neofeudal hypercapitalism erects paywalls on every path to social legitimacy; whereas before profit meant expanding outward into new markets, eventually as hypercapitalism saturated the easy to conquer markets *Foucault's boomerang* took effect (also known as the Imperial Boomerang): tools used to expand an empire outward (weaponized finance and corporatocracy) is eventually turned inward. This is why so many ""services"" now focus on disruption of a former accepted standard in order to insert paywalls wherever possible.

When COVID comes a long, people were suddenly supposed to be less social. This is already a hard sell given that human beings are social animals, but it's even harder when social venues tied to consumption and $$$ have been *relentlessly advertised and normalized as imperative activities* (because profits).

And then you add that a *lot* of America is a service economy. Given that America has brutal healthcare costs, virtually no safety net, etc people are even more at the mercy of having employment... which is being destroyed due to lockdowns. What to do? Enter 2 favorite quotes of mine:

&gt; Man is not a rational animal, he is a rationalizing animal. -- Robert A. Heinlein

...

&gt; Most human beings don't *follow* moral systems, principles, or ideologies; instead they *use* or *pull from the ether* whichever moral system, principle or ideology will justify or rationalize actions performed on behalf of self interest. -- unknown redditor (paraphrased)

So faced with financial/economic/social destruction and lacking the mental or societal tools to adapt in a way that would allow them to thrive in a new situation, they rationalize instead any way they possibly can. In some cases this fiction is broken by *calamity* in the form of COVID itself- when they or a loved one get *really* sick or die due to it. 

In effect in order to rationalize behavior they *socially or financially need*, they will descend into rationalizing complete absurdity if that's what it takes. There is a term for this: *hypernormalization.* It was coined by Alexei Yurchak in his book *Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More* which covered the last Soviet generation. The term hypernormalization means the rationalization of absurdity- the belief in fiction.

Translation ([deepl.com](https://deepl.com)):

The corona-related cancellation of the Oktoberfest should not automatically mean the end of all German folk festivals, according to the German Showmen's Association (DSB). The Wiesn is world-wide the figurehead of the German people celebrations, communicated the federation. It is to be feared that no other folk festivals will follow its example. But the Oktoberfest is not representative of the 9750 other German folk festivals and fairs, the DSB said. It is ""a festival of superlatives"". No other German folk festival attracts so many visitors - six million. No other festival is a similarly strong magnet for millions of tourists from all over Europe, Southeast Asia and the USA, with up to 400,000 guests on a single day, it said. The family-oriented German folk festival, on the other hand, is aimed at locals and guests from the surrounding area with a diverse range of offerings. Organizers should take these differences into account. ""The cancellation of Oktoberfest should not be an indicator for rashly canceling other folk festivals in Germany,"" argued DSB President Albert Ritter.

Organizers should use the last possible moment for unavoidable cancellations. ""We are ready to go at any time, can usually appear at the festival site within a few days and set up the festival.""

I think you overestimate the amount of planning that goes into Oktoberfest. It is just a big fair (ok it is the world's biggest fair) and here every small village holds its own fair every year (normally). There are spots for the carnies and spots for the tents, they are mostly rented in advance for years. Then there are some clubs that are involved in the parades and are some special things you have to plan for but for the Oktoberfest organization itself it is not that big of a deal.

From my point of view the biggest time constraint is the construction of the beer tents. These are more or less wood construction with partial concrete foundation. They start building it around July (if I remember correctly). However, as there is a pandemic going on the carnies have nothing to do anyway and the beer tents are used for the Oktoberfest exclusively. Bigger attractions like the big roller coaster maybe do not need more than a month to set up.

All the tourist part is not centrally organized, it is just visitors that come to Munich.

The problem with Oktoberfest is that you have crammed beer halls, colder weather which makes the perfect place for a super spreader event. I hope that, if vaccinations go well during the summer, they could set up something smaller for the locals (like Frühlingsfest) by inviting the carnies and having smaller beer tents.",,,1620110714,{},gwvnuf3,False,t3_n3x7ok,False,False,t1_gwsk33d,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n3x7ok/germanys_oktoberfest_canceled_again_in_2021_due/gwvnuf3/,1620148863,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

But I was working from home and fairly isolated.

A few weeks out from being double-vaccinated I went on a solo vacation to Pigeon Forge. I ate in restaurants and did indoor things along with outdoor things. Indoors I wore a mask, except not at restaurants. Outdoors, I only wore one at a show when people were in a crowd in bleachers and cheering and shouting a lot. And that was perfectly fine in my comfort zone. It was nice milling around in public spaces and stopping to chat with people, meet their dogs, just chit-chat while hanging out, without worrying about them murdering me with covid.

I have a friend who has an autoimmune disease and he's been double-vaccinated but he still hasn't gone out anywhere. He and his wife weren't hugely active socially before but they would go out to eat, maybe see a movie, visit friends at least on occasion.

Holy mother of God: again.

NB this is not ""10 times more infectious"" in the sense that it transmits 10× more easily (i.e., that the R0 has gone from 3-5 to 30-50), but in the sense that viral loads are 10× higher. This is still huge cause for concern, and may also indicate some immune escape, but neither is it quite as bad as the headline makes out.

Edit: In fact, here's some epidemiological data that makes me think it may be much, much, much less bad than the headline suggests.

These articles need to stop getting clicks and parents like this don’t deserve a platform to complain about not being allowed to skirt the rules, but apparently awareness still has to be spread that restrictions are still in place and we’re not 100% out of the woods yet. What has it been, a year since stories like this started showing up? Have people still not learned, or are they just that entitled and arrogant? I see no indication that these parents did any pre-travel research to clarify the airline’s mask policies. If you can plan a “fun vacation in Florida,” then you can certainly double-check Southwest’s website (the policies and instructions are clear, if you actually look). If this kid’s conditions are truly as the parents describe, then there would’ve been no issues obtaining a proper medical exemption before the flight.

If your family members aren’t able to follow the current travel rules, and you don’t take the necessary pre-travel mask exemption qualification steps, then be prepared to drive to/from your destination. It’s really not that complicated.

Probably was horrific for the kid, all of these situations are. But it’s 100% on the parents, and good for Southwest for standing their ground. They owe no apologies.


DES MOINES, Iowa (KCCI) - An Iowa family is challenging Southwest Airlines after they say they were turned away from their flight because their 5-year-old son, who has autism, couldn’t wear his face mask.
After a fun vacation in Florida, Cody and Paige Petek and their two children were set to fly back to Des Moines, Iowa, on Sunday. During their layover in St. Louis, their 5-year-old son, who is nonverbal and has autism and a sensory processing disorder, was struggling to wear his mask.

The Peteks say the Southwest Airlines crew refused to let them into their connecting flight.
Dr. Vince Hassel, who was also flying to Des Moines, says people started lobbying to get the boy on board after the crew refused.

“They weren’t going to let the kid on the plane if he didn’t put this mask on. He kind of had a bandana around his neck, and he just wasn’t having it and throwing a fit. Just to watch this play out was absolutely horrible,” Hassel said.
As the scene was playing out, the family says the 5-year-old had a seizure, but his medication was on board the flight to Des Moines.
The Petek family says they had to drive home from St. Louis in a rental car. What should have been an hourlong plane ride turned into a nearly six-hour drive.

Anthony L. Marchetti Jr., the Peteks’ lawyer, believes Southwest violated the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Transportation Security Administration’s policy states that people with disabilities who cannot wear a mask because of the disability are exempt from having to wear one.

Will some things linger? Probably just like with the TSA as you pointed out, some things linger, but they are mostly mild annoyances not huge shifts on ways of life.

So you're going to have to prove you're vaccinated to get into most countries and that even might take a while, some places are going to require vaccine passport, some people might not go to the same places as before because it stresses them.

But do you really think people going to big ass clubs or bars, gatherings, travel, huge weddings, other public activity, is going to change dramatically once this is over? That's like saying after 9/11 we weren't going to fly anymore, some maybe, but for nearly everyone it just added a few extra steps.

In 2019 my friend group had a big ass trip to Vegas for a weekend. 3-4 to a hotel room, clubbing, drinking, doing shit around town, went to a day club where you couldn't even see the pool with how many people were in it. Guess what kind of environment a city like Vegas is trying to have again post covid? Beyond that, there are a lot of us willing to go back and do that (once we're vaccinated).

I'm basing on what I have available. What you provided does not have a case fatality rate by age as far as I looked.

&gt;You overlook that over 60% of (Danish) deaths in those age ranges were amongst risk groups who are already vaccinated in Denmark. 

That is incredibly low and will results in a large amount of deaths. I'm not overlooking anything. Vaccination is obviously not adequate at this time.

&gt;You overlook that the vulnerable older age groups will not have the virus passed on to them, as they are also already vaccinated.

Again by your own admission they are not. If you look at the daily death statistics the virus is absolutely still being passed onto older people.

&gt;And you overlook that in July and August there will be far fewer cases per day than the 700 we get now. 

Today is May, and the AZ vaccine decision was made even earlier. It's not July and August. 2-3 people are dying every single day right now. Try and focus on reality here.

&gt;The Danish authorities estimate that using the J&amp;J vaccine will save one person from ICU at the cost of 12 to 30 people with severe complications from the vaccine. They do not estimate cancelling the use of the vaccine will cost any deaths and it will not postpone reopening.

I don't know how they could have possibly made this conclusion when 700 people are being infected every day and 2-3 are dying every single day.

Those fully vaccinated not only have a lower rate of contraction (90-95%), but a much lower rate of hospitalization (94% reduction) and a near-zero fatality rate from covid.

You could argue that the benefits of minimizing spread through vaccinated individuals, while cases are high, is still enough reason to minimize high-transmission settings, but from a selfish standpoint the risk of hospitalization and death is objectively quite low in almost any circumstance. Keep in mind that most of the statistics for hospitalizations and deaths of vaccinated people is for the most vulnerable and at-risk populations, which make the numbers look worse than they would for lower-risk segments of the population.

At some point the indirect health and direct economic impacts of strict lockdowns &amp; restrictions will outweigh the risks of covid spread as cases drop and the population approaches herd immunity. I’m not sure if the US is past that point or close to it, but that calculus is being done and should be used to influence government policy.

The Da Nang case, 28, resides in the central town of Hoi An in Quang Nam Province but has come to live and work in neighboring Da Nang since April 29.

He started to show Covid-19 symptoms of fever and fatigue last Sunday and tested positive for the new coronavirus the next day.

The source of transmission has not been determined for this patient, who is now tagged ""patient 2982.""

The Hanoi case, 26, lives in Bac Tu Liem District.
He was a passenger who sat near a group of Chinese experts, who had come to work in Vietnam and one had later been confirmed to have Covid-19 after returning back to their country, on Vietnam Airlines flight VN160 from Da Nang to Hanoi on April 29.

After entering Vietnam, the Chinese experts were sent to Nhu Nguyet 2 hotel in northern Yen Bai Province for 14-day centralized quarantine from April 9 to 23. They had their samples taken for coronavirus testing thrice, with all results negative.

After completing their centralized quarantine period, the group came to Trung Bac A Company in the province and continued to have their health monitored for 14 days at another hotel under supervision of local medical staff.

Yet those experts had left their hotel and visited many localities in northern Vietnam from April 23 to 25. On April 28, they returned to China through Huu Nghi border gate in Lang Son Province. A day later, one of the five experts was confirmed positive for the virus by Chinese authorities.

The group had so far infected 14 people, including 13 in northern Vinh Phuc Province and one in Hanoi.

For the ongoing community outbreak, Vietnam has also recorded 20 other cases in northern provinces of Ha Nam, Hung Yen, Hanoi and HCMC, counted from April 29.

They are all linked to a Ha Nam man who had returned from Japan on April 7 and tested positive after completing his two-week centralized quarantine in Da Nang on April 21. This man had also failed to quarantine himself for another 14 days at home as required.

By April 29, Vietnam had gone for more than one month without recording any new locally-transmitted of Covid-19.",,,1620097858,{},gwv553m,True,t3_n4emzl,False,False,t3_n4emzl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n4emzl/vietnam_reports_two_more_local_covid19_cases_in/gwv553m/,1620137300,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Where I live in TX, our county leaders made it known from the beginning of the pandemic that all Covid prevention measures were to be considered voluntary within the county. Individuals could choose whether or not to follow any of the guidelines in public places or on their own property. And business owners were free to enact and require customers to abide by any prevention measures they wanted to in the confines of their business locations. Or not... it was entirely up to them. And when the governor enacted pandemic mandates, county leaders made it clear that none would be enforced within county limits, they were completely voluntary here. So, for a great many people living here, nothing changed at all.

&gt;Or rather, before “everyone,” you hit a point where enough people are immune that it can’t be spread to those who aren’t immune easily.

So far, the variants occasionally infect vaccinated people, so like other coronaviruses it's not inconceivable that one appears that can spread widely through the vaccinated population causing very little hospitalization, but widespread mild illness. If such a variant ever arrives, it will dig out more people who have no immunity, who will get very sick.

I'm not really sure what it is you're looking for. Nobody thinks we're going to be stuck in permanent Covid hell or anything, and nobody thinks any of what I'm saying here is cause to keep permanent lockdowns in place. It's just that once we open up, people are going to be getting sick and dying of covid for years while the virus finds its way into unvaccinated pockets of the country. From that same article:

&gt;“What we want to do at the very least is get to a point where we have just really sporadic little flare-ups,” said Carl Bergstrom, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Washington in Seattle. “That would be a very sensible target in this country where we have an excellent vaccine and the ability to deliver it.”
&gt;
&gt;Over the long term — a generation or two — the goal is to transition the new coronavirus to become more like its cousins that cause common colds. That would mean the first infection is early in childhood, and subsequent infections are mild because of partial protection, even if immunity wanes.

There really is a shift into a more community-centered view of herd immunity. I'm in Michigan and have been watching our outbreak unfold, and it was driven largely by the Thumb, a conservative section of the state that had for some reason dodged both of our previous outbreaks. The virus went nuts on those counties. That seems to be happening again in the eastern halves of Washington and Oregon.

Then, we got really good at fighting fires and started putting them out whenever we could as a matter of federal and state policy.  

So, all the debris and undergrowth built up, so now that if a fire comes through there’s so much heat it devastates everything.  

We’ve finally (mostly) recognized the error of our ways, but because of a variety of factors (lack of funding and support, people not liking smoke from planned burns, too many houses, etc) we’re so far behind on prescribed burns.

Vaccines create a cell response, which educates our immune system to create the right antibodies when we get sick quickly. For this education the active ingredient in a vaccine is not very large, so the dose is small already. As far as I know, there might be different vaccine sizes for different age groups, my best guess is that in case of this vaccine we didn‘t have the time to test it extensively.

Four HCV drugs that work synergistically with remdesivir ""are especially interesting,"" said Gaetano Montelione of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York.

The drugs - simeprevir, grazoprevir, paritaprevir, and vaniprevir - inhibit a protein in the coronavirus called PLpro, while remdesivir, which is given intravenously, targets viral polymerase proteins.

In test tube experiments, these HCV drugs increased remdesivir's antiviral activity as much as 10-fold, according to a paper published in Cell Reports by a 13-member team that included Montelione, Robert Krug at the University of Texas at Austin, and Kris White and Adolfo Garcia-Sastre at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.

Drug companies are developing oral drugs that target the same viral proteins as remdesivir. If those become available, Montelione said, it may be possible to offer them in combination with a hepatitis C drug for use at home, before COVID-19 patients become so ill that they need to be hospitalized.

The Imperial College-led study, which looked at immune responses among healthcare workers in Britain after their first dose of the Pfizer shot, found that those who had previously had mild or asymptomatic infection had enhanced protection against more infectious mutated variants that emerged in Britain and South Africa.

But the immune response after a first dose of the shot was weaker in people who had not previously been infected, potentially leaving them at risk from such variants, researchers leading the work said.

""This study highlights the importance of getting second doses of the vaccine rolled out to protect the population,"" said Rosemary Boyton, a professor of immunology and respiratory medicine at Imperial who co-led the study.

""People who have had their first dose of vaccine and who have not previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2 are not fully protected against the circulating 'variants of concern'.""

The research, published in the journal Science, analysed blood samples for the presence and levels of immunity against the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the so-called UK variant, known as B.1.1.7, and another known as B.1.351 that emerged in South Africa.

It found that, after a first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, a boosted immune response in the form of enhanced T-cells, memory B-cells, and neutralising antibodies that were effective against the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants was associated with prior infection.

In people who had not had COVID-19, however, a single vaccine dose produced lower levels of neutralising antibodies against the variants, as well as ""increased, abrogated or unchanged T cell responses depending on human leukocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphisms.""

Danny Altmann, an Imperial professor of immunology who co-led the study, said this meant there would be a ""window of vulnerability"" for people between their first and second doses.",,,1620113510,{},gwvqykc,True,t3_n4ihkv,False,False,t3_n4ihkv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n4ihkv/risk_from_virus_variants_remains_after_first/gwvqykc/,1620154149,17,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Yes, the holidays were prolonged - the days between 1 May (Labor Day) and 9 May (Victory Day) were declared as holidays (non-mandatory) due to the request from Respotrebnadzor. The reasoning being to decrease the amount of intermingling of people (not sure how it's suppiosed to, as humans don't tend to spend holidays alone, but I'm no epidemiologist).

As for the empty vaccination stations, yes. In some regions the government even started to offer monetary incentives to old people to get vaccinated, IIRC in Moscow they offer a certificate worth 2000 RUB (you can't cash it but you can use it as payment in a number of stores and restaurants), two regions in the Far East offer hard cash (2000 RUB and 1000 RUB, I think), and, more imaginatively, in one region people who got vaccinated before Easter would get 10 eggs.",,,1620123302,{},gww1st4,False,t3_ms3r19,False,True,t1_gwsup24,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ms3r19/only_8_million_russians_vaccinated_against/gww1st4/,1620160643,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Here is a link, directly from the CDC on how mRNA vaccines work.

 TL;DR: The mRNA never enters your cell's nucleus, which is where your DNA is. All it does is instruct a cell to make particular protein (the Covid spike protein), which then gets targeted by your immune system, training it to detect that spike protein. It does not modify your DNA at all. 


Further, there was mRNA research well before Covid-19. Here's an article from 2018 on the technology: https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243

It's just that the players involved don't necessarily have that interest at heart due to both sides having fought about IP laws for ~50 years and both seeing this as an opportunity/threat. 

While sharing IP costs little in terms of expense to the initial production line, just saying help in production doesn't make more production. The number of engineers who are trained to make these novel vaccines  are limited so it comes down to: would greater doses have been made if those engineers spread themselves more thinly  rather than concentrate themselves on a few production lines to boost production. This is true for pretty much all of the western vaccines as they are all using novel methods. Given all the problems that have already been experienced across all of the vaccines production, can we be sure that spreading the engineers thinner would lead to more production? I'm not sure. Additionally, since certification of vaccines is for the process of production, more factories means more waiting time in certification, where larger factories don't as you are just expanding what is already approved. This leads to changes in the most effective way to scale. It is complex enough that you could probably have goods studies claiming both that not spreading thinly reduced supply and increased supply. 

On the other hand, vaccines that could be made with little technical assistance already exist, most notably in the Cavaxin vaccine, which my understanding places it as already open for use with royalty.

And that the two vaccines are very, very similar.

So based on the above, with my limited biochemistry knowledge my best guess is that Moderna is just decided that they'd rather use higher temperatures and don't mind that the mRNA starts to break down, as they put enough in one dose anyway.

Let’s say that community transmission was such that if you went back to “normal” and weren’t yet vaccinated, you would have a 50% chance of catching Covid within the next 3 months. But you are vaccinated! So are 19 of your friends! You all go back to completely normal. 10 of you will be exposed to Covid in the next 3 months. The vaccines will prevent 8-9 of you from getting infected, but the other 1-2 will get infected and have a good chance of passing it along to others. Since you’re not wearing masks or distancing, you will probably pass it on to several people before you have symptoms. Since less than half the population is vaccinated, you’re likely to give it to 2-3 people. Therefore you group of 20 vaccinated people might directly cause 6 cases.

Once the case numbers are lower, we can reduce restrictions more safely.

(I’m vaccinated and I still wear masks and distance. I do a home rapid test twice a week as my employer requires it. I have started allowing select family and friends into my house, but we distance and mask where possible, and ventilate the house after each visit.

## Abstract 

#### Introduction

Hypercoagulability and thrombosis caused by COVID-19 is related to the higher mortality rate. Because of limited data on antiplatelet effect, we aimed to evaluate the impact of aspirin add-on therapy on the outcome of the patients hospitalized due to severe COVID-19.

#### Materials and methods

In this cohort study, patients with a confirmed diagnosis of severe COVID-19 admitted to Imam Hossein Medical Center, Tehran, Iran from March 2019 to July 2020 were included. Demographics and related clinical data during their hospitalization were recorded. The mortality rate of the patients was considered as the primary outcome and its association with aspirin use was assessed.

#### Results

Nine hundred and ninety-one patients were included that 336 patients of them (34%) received aspirin during their hospitalization and 655 ones (66%) did not. Comorbidities were more prevalent in the patients who were receiving aspirin. Results from the multivariate COX proportional model demonstrated a significant independent association between aspirin use and reduction in risk of in-hospital mortality (0.746\[0.560-0.994\], P=0.046).

#### Conclusions

Aspirin use in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is associated with a significant decrease in mortality rate. Further prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the efficacy and adverse effects of aspirin administration in this population. This article is protected by copyright.

In this family’s case, they mention disability exemptions but there’s no indication that they did the legwork necessary to comply prior to flying. I’ve also seen statements from pediatricians in various parts of the country, essentially telling parents to not even ask them for a medical exemption.

Right now we have under 2% positivity rate, added 41 hospitalizations since Friday (342 total) and 15 deaths over the same period. Our case number is accumulated based on both probable and confirmed cases, so a positive test isn't required to be added to the total; this screws up analyzing our rate vs. other states. 

Iowa, with a slightly smaller population and less population density, has a 4% positive average over 7 days, 231 new cases since the weekend and 12 deaths in the same time frame (showing zero for the weekends and Monday, so I think they have a reporting lag).  Iowa is showing something around 44% with one dose of vaccine and around 35% fully vaccinated. A note here: Iowa runs far fewer tests than CT does and only counts lab-confirmed cases in their totals. These reporting differences are probably skewing numbers a bit.

Overall, we have a high vaccination rate, low positivity, still require masks in retail outlets statewide while Iowa's governor pulled back restrictions in February, but didn't restrict localities from instituting mask requirements; several cities there still have mandates in place, which is probably suppressing further spread in more populated areas. As to the disparity between new cases and deaths, CT had a number of people in the hospital already (I'm having trouble finding Iowa's total hospitalizations in that time frame), and COVID cases usually take one to two weeks to go from symptoms to death. It's very possible CT won't see another major spike in deaths until whatever immunity vaccines offer wears off.

Later, when her family went into lockdown, neighbors dismissed her fears.
“Appalachians were raised to believe they must work and can’t get sick, no matter what,” said Ms. Hayes, who has a graduate degree in Appalachian studies. She wept in frustration as familiar names appeared on her prayer chain, deathly ill from the virus.
On the door of her church, someone recently posted a newspaper letter. It derided Covid mask mandates, “the Prophet Fauci” and vaccines “made in part from aborted children.”
The topic of the vaccine has even muted the most influential leaders in Greene County: evangelical pastors. There are many who have been vaccinated, like Mr. Smith at Tusculum Baptist, but won’t use the pulpit to support it. He doesn’t want to risk alienating anyone, he explained, at a time when he hopes people will return to the church itself to worship. After a year of Zoom services, which people call “pajama church,” he fears in-person attendance will drop.
he Covid shot.
Daniel Shrader, who leads a small Baptist congregation, is all in on the vaccine. He wants church to be safe for the older, hard-of-hearing ladies to whom he’s been preaching during the pandemic by shouting from their porch steps.
In conversation, he’ll share his vaccine views; in larger gatherings, he sticks to prayer.
The pastors’ perspectives run the gamut. Mr. Smucker, the Mennonite pastor, believes that natural herd immunity — let the disease run its course — is a better path than vaccination. But he won’t preach about it.
Chelsea Daugherty’s father, a Free Will Baptist pastor, is unsure about getting vaccinated. Ms. Daugherty, a sophomore at Tusculum University who got the shot, said her father tells worshipers: “The Lord gave us common sense, so we’ve got to use it.” Make up your own mind.
So which trusted person will speak for the vaccine? Eva Fields?
She is a nurse-practitioner who treated one of the first local patients to die from Covid. Greeneville-raised, she has 24 relatives who had the virus.
When she asks patients if they will get vaccinated, about half reply, “No and I’m not going to.” Assuming she’ll be angry, they add, “I’m so sorry if that upsets you!”
Miss Fields responds, “That’s OK, honey. I’m not planning to, either.”
Her gut tells her to believe a video someone sent her from a far-right misinformation group, in which a ranter said studies showed that vaccines caused plaque in the brain.
Like others here, she is suspicious of Bill Gates’s involvement in vaccine development. One evening at supper, Dr. Theo Hensley, a vaccine proponent in her office, retorted: “I don’t know Bill Gates but I do know that Dolly Parton gave a million bucks.” (Ms. Parton is northeast Tennessee’s favorite daughter.)
“Well, she’s probably OK,” Miss Fields allowed.
“When someone pushes something really hard, I sit back, because I don’t like people telling me, ‘This is what you need to do,’ ” Miss Fields said. Echoing many others, she added, “I need to do my own research.”
For now, she neither urges nor discourages patients to get the vaccine.
The day the Fletchers, the retired couple, spoke about the vaccine with their family physician, Dr. Daniel Lewis, was the one-year anniversary of the day he was put on a ventilator with a severe case of Covid.
Dr. Lewis, 43, remained hospitalized for over a month. He was so gravely ill that he recorded farewell messages for his five children.
Over his 13 years in Greeneville, Dr. Lewis, a volunteer physician for school sports teams and chief medical officer for four Ballad Health regional hospitals, accrued a wide community of support. During his illness, people dropped off meals and restaurant gift cards on his porch and kept up a surging prayer chain. They mowed his lawn, mulched his flower beds, fixed his truck.
bbly, he and his wife, devout Baptists, struggled to figure out God’s purpose behind the ordeal.
Patients kept telling him, “I didn’t take Covid seriously until you got sick.”
So Dr. Lewis began using that hard-earned credibility to speak about the vaccine, visiting nursing homes, addressing churches, making videos. He honed his pitch to meet every pushback, from faux-scientific to conspiratorial to spiritual.
Although many Appalachians used to resist seeing the doctor, family medicine practitioners like Dr. Lewis are becoming trusted figures. But discussing vaccines with patients takes time, which many doctors can’t afford, and an established relationship, which many poor patients don’t have.
Dr. Lewis gives a soft sell that sometimes works. A patient will say, “So are you going to give me the vaccine now?”
He has to respond, “I don’t have it here.” The patient shuts down. “Then I’m not going to take it.”
Could Dr. Lewis persuade the Fletchers to get the vaccine?
Mr. Fletcher doesn’t fret about long-term side effects. His prostate cancer has returned, one more blow in a Job-like year that saw the unexpected death of his younger son, a paraplegic, and the death of a nephew, an emergency room physician. A year in which dear friends severed their relationship with the Fletchers because of the couple’s Covid skepticism.
“When you get older, you think you have no more tears, but then something causes them to come back,” he said in a subdued voice.
Dr. Lewis patiently addressed the Fletchers’ questions, delineating between what researchers do and don’t yet know.
“How can we be sure there are no chips in the vaccine, like the things you put in your dog?” Mr. Fletcher asked.
“We can’t make microchips that small,” Dr. Lewis countered.
“Well, it’s like a grain of rice,” said Mr. Fletcher.
“I couldn’t inject a grain of rice with a needle,” Dr. Lewis said.
Dr. Lewis held up his smartphone. If you’re worried about being tracked, he said, all the technology is right here, in the very thing you pick up every day. Every hour.
The Fletchers looked abashed.
“It’s your decision,” Dr. Lewis said gently. “I just want you to be able to make an informed decision and I want to do the best I can to help you.”
Mr. Fletcher replied, “Well, we have to spend some time in discussion.”
Later, Dr. Lewis was optimistic: “I think I can eventually persuade them.”

Faith, Freedom, Fear: Rural America’s Covid Vaccine Skeptics

"" “So have you gotten the vaccine yet?”

The question, a friendly greeting to Betty Smith, the pastor’s wife, lingered in the air as the four church women sat down for their regular Tuesday coffee and conversation at Ingles Market.

Mrs. Smith hesitated, sensing a chilly blast of judgment from a never-mask, never-vax companion. She fumbled through a non-reply.

Recalling the moment later, she sighed, “We were there to get to know each other better but the first thing on the table was the Covid vaccine.”

The subject makes her husband, the Rev. David Smith, even more uncomfortable. “Honestly, I wish people wouldn’t ask,” he said, chatting after Wednesday night prayer at Tusculum Baptist Church. “I think it’s none of their business. And it’s just dividing people.”

As the beautiful Appalachian spring unfurls across northeastern Tennessee, the Covid-19 vaccine is tearing apart friends, families, congregations, colleagues. “It’s a muddy mess,” said Meredith Shrader, a physician assistant, who runs an events venue with her husband, another pastor, and who notes that the choice has become about much more than health care. “Which voice do you listen to?”

Communities like Greeneville and its surroundings — rural, overwhelmingly Republican, deeply Christian, 95 percent white — are on the radar of President Biden and American health officials, as efforts to vaccinate most of the U.S. population enters a critical phase. These are the places where polls show resistance to the vaccine is most entrenched. While campaigns aimed at convincing Black and Latino urban communities to set aside their vaccine mistrust have made striking gains, towns like these will also have to be convinced if the country is to achieve widespread immunity.
Betty Smith and her husband, Pastor David Smith, of Tusculum Baptist Church, worry the vaccine has become a divisive issue in the community.
surveys suggest. People say that politics isn’t the leading driver of their vaccine attitudes. The most common reason for their apprehension is fear — that the vaccine was developed in haste, that long-term side effects are unknown. Their decisions are also entangled in a web of views about bodily autonomy, science and authority, plus a powerful regional, somewhat romanticized self-image: We don’t like outsiders messing in our business.

According to state health department statistics, 31 percent of the vaccine-eligible population in Greene County has gotten at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, still below Tennessee overall, which has one of the lowest rates in the country, and far below the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s national tally of 55 percent. While many older residents have been inoculated, now that eligibility is open to all adults, vaccination sites are almost desolate.

Still, conversations here show that for many people, resistance is not firm. Roiled by internet fallacies, many hunger for straightforward information from people they trust. Others have practical needs, like paid time off to recover from side effects, which the Biden administration has urged employers to offer, or the opportunity to get the shot from their own doctor.

What’s also lacking is a groundswell that might encourage the hesitant to make the leap: Many people who have gotten vaccinated are remaining tight-lipped.

A matter of trust

Greene County is carpeted with hundreds of evangelical churches that range from steepled 19th-century edifices to backroads barns. People scrape by on subsistence farming, jobs in small factories, welfare checks and cash flow from retirees who are moving onto the cheap, vista-blissful land. Drug busts for heroin and methamphetamine sustain a humming cottage industry of lawyers and bail bonds services.

Covid smacked the region hard this winter. Eleven people in Jim and Rita Fletcher’s extended circle died from it.

But no, the Fletchers, lifelong Greenevillians, will not get the vaccine.

What’s the point, they ask? The government still wants you to wear a mask indoors. “I just don’t see any benefits,” said Mrs. Fletcher, as the couple waited to see their family doctor.

Neither the science nor statistics of the new vaccine daunt them. Now retired and in their 70s, Mr. Fletcher was a telecom engineer, Mrs. Fletcher, a secretary and accounting clerk.

But the Fletchers, Free Will Baptists, worry the vaccine includes aborted fetal parts (it doesn’t). They don’t trust the government, convinced it has long manipulated Covid case numbers.

“I just think we have been hornswoggled,” Mr. Fletcher said.

Walt Cross, the proprietor of the Mustard Seed, a shop in Newport just over the county line, that takes its name from the Gospel of Matthew and carries herbs, nutritional supplements and local produce.

Mr. Cross, who is also a volunteer fire chief for Cocke County, is a tall, lanky east Tennessean with a blue-eyed focus and a warm mountain drawl, whether he’s describing his preferred method to rouse people who have overdosed (ammonia rather than Narcan) or answering questions from Covid patients about how to treat their symptoms (hydrate, eat, take herbal extracts, apply hot and cold compresses).

Before going to the doctor, many people phone Mr. Cross. Or after the doctor’s medicines don’t seem to be working.

Although his father died of Covid, Mr. Cross won’t get the vaccine. “We jumped into bed with the vaccine too fast!” he said. While he won’t tell people to get it or not, he says pointedly, “Do your due diligence.”

Mr. Cross, who lectures around the country and in Rwanda about preventive wellness, is studying for an advanced degree in naturopathic medicine. His shop evokes themes dear to Appalachians, with people calling these early April weeks the “redbud winter” — the spring chill during which redbud trees swell with mauve-pink blossoms. A store wall is lined with Mason jars filled with herbaceous plants like jewelweed, passionflower and elderberry, which Appalachians were taught to use by the Cherokee.

He scoffs at the perception that people here are vaccine-hesitant simply because they, like him, are Republicans.

“That doesn’t make sense to me,” he said. “Trump brought the vaccine in.” If this was about political affiliation, he continued, “you’d jump and take it!” Instead, he said, people think the vaccine is too entwined with politics.

In Appalachia, Mr. Cross explained, the fervor with which people sidestep the vaccine is ratcheted up by history and tradition. For centuries, Scots-Irish settlers tucked into the mountains to evade army conscription and tax collectors.

Jeremy Faison, a longtime Republican state representative who grew up in the area, agrees: “Throughout the pandemic, there are a lot of us who are like, ‘It’s a serious situation but me and my family can take care of ourselves.’ ”
Mr. Faison, a libertarian and an evangelical Christian, added, “So we take exception with the government putting mandates on us, pressuring us to do something.”
That view is bolstered by a religious, near-joyous fatalism. People say that if they haven’t caught Covid a year into the pandemic, they will take their chances. True, they might get Covid and die. But either way, a win-win: longer life on Earth or, for the faithful, eternal life in Heaven.
“There’s a time appointed for every person to die,” said Reuben Smucker, a Mennonite pastor in Greeneville who works as a garage-door installer. “We should take care of our bodies physically, emotionally and spiritually, but if it’s my time to go and it’s by Covid, well then, it’s my time to go.”
After Mr. Cross, an elder in a Seventh Day Adventist Church, counsels Covid patients, he prays with them. “That’s the most important thing,” he said. “Because it’s God who does the healing.”
A topic too volatile
So charged have the Covid shots become that many people have adopted a resigned silence. A vaccinated 20-something barista has given up trying to persuade her not-now, not-ever father. A retired postal worker just lets her doctor assume she’s gotten the shots, because he is a family friend. But she hasn’t — and won’t.
Mary Hayes, who drove into Greeneville for a reunion lunch with a large group of vaccinated friends, is accustomed to speaking her mind. But she has a moral quandary: should she advocate for the vaccine or keep quiet? She got the vaccine early, because so many doses went unclaimed. In her remote corner of the county, people already look at her warily.
“A lot of times I have to temper my opinions in order to fit in,” Ms. Hayes said, tears welling in her eyes. “I’m walking a line between people refusing to socialize with me or not.”
Ms. Hayes grew up here, left, and returned to care for her mother. Late in 2019, while teaching English online to students in China, she noticed that some were disappearing from her computer monitor.

Then, when we went out to do grocery shopping before the movie she said ""can we go eat before the movie?"" We've been outdoor dining the entire time when we can, and indoor on occasion when there's hardly anyone else in the restaurant. So, we went and ate at a sushi place before the movie.

[source](https://www.fiercepharma.com/manufacturing/pfizer-s-mcpherson-plant-filling-covid-19-vaccine-dinged-for-repeat-offenses-last) Doesn't sound like a license suspension to me - sounds like a case of Pfizer bringing manufacturing and quality control expertise to rescue a plant that had significant issues.

In other words, that's exactly proving my point:  vaccine manufacturing isn't a game, and just saying ""make some fucking products"" isn't sufficient:  you need actual experience and expertise.

Which brings us full circle.  The whole thing we're talking about here isn't whether we should forge partnerships and expand manufacturing - we should, and we are.  It's whether a forcible IP waiver gets us there, and nothing you've presented demonstrates that it would:  you've only provided a single example of one company without relevant expertise who thinks they can reverse-engineer a vaccine.

There are plenty of candidate manufacturing partners who could build up facilities over time, and the vaccine makers have been working with many of them in a licensing arrangement to produce enough doses to expedite the vaccination effort.  But that direct partnership is needed to make sure the production process is done correctly - a mere waiver of intellectual property rights is wholly insufficient without the production expertise.

You haven't presented a single scrap of evidence that an IP waiver is what's needed to expedite vaccine manufacturing.  I think it's far more likely that you're advocating for this position because you work in the pharmaceutical industry and believe an IP waiver would benefit your employer.",,,1620163406,{},gwy87xr,False,t3_n3if3j,False,True,t1_gwy38xw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n3if3j/gates_foundation_who_help_launch_go_give_one/gwy87xr/,1620204355,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;	“C-Tap is an innovative initiative and has potential for the middle to longer term, but we were aware from the outset that it would take greater efforts and a longer timeframe to bring the different interest groups together,” a WHO spokesman said.

&gt;	Other global-access initiatives such as Covax, a vaccine-sharing scheme, were being relied on “to deliver results more rapidly”, he added.

You keep focusing on C-Tap, but seem to forget it isn’t even an IP waiver scheme - it’s intended as a voluntary information sharing effort, not a forced one, because an IP waiver wouldn’t include all the manufacturing know how needed to actually use the patents.  From your article:

&gt;	Even if a waiver were granted, intellectual property lawyers said there could be long delays until production because the patents don’t include the details of the manufacturing process, leaving developing countries to reverse-engineer the formulas.

And finally, parents are already voluntarily not being enforced during the pandemic:

&gt;	Moderna, another vaccine developer, has agreed not to enforce its patent for the course of the pandemic

I’m glad you’ve acknowledged that manufacturing partnerships have expanded, although I disagree that these were “slow and cumbersome” - actually, they’ve happened historically quickly.  

None of the articles you’ve shared identify a single manufacturer who has a factory ready to make mRNA vaccines and simply needs an IP waiver to do so.

But perhaps your employer is in this position and hoping to get access to produce vaccines?  You carefully didn’t acknowledge that part of my reply, but I find it suspicious that a few days after a post celebrating a new job in pharmaceutical regulatory affairs, you suddenly began spending your full workday on Reddit vehemently advocating for a policy that primarily would benefit less-successful companies in the pharmaceutical industry…",,,1620150412,{},gwxlkb6,False,t3_n3if3j,False,True,t1_gwxjinw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n3if3j/gates_foundation_who_help_launch_go_give_one/gwxlkb6/,1620192191,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

There is Zydus Cadila’s **ZyCoV-D**. It’s an Indian based vaccine, which uses DNA (not RNA!) to deliver instructions to cells to create antigens and an immune response. It holds numerous unique advantages: it is a skin patch instead of a shot, and can be stored at room temperature. The downside is that it needs three doses so it’ll take over three months to be totally vaccinated. Phase 3 is ending soon, so hopefully it will be approved by India by June or July! Production has already begun, although only a few hundred million is expected this year.

Russia has a protein-based vaccine called **EpiVacCorona** by Bektop and the Vector Institution. It’s actually already in use in Russia and Turkmenistan, but phase 3 studies are technically still going on so I’m including it in one coming out (it isn’t being widely used like Russia’s Spunik). Technically, phase 3 should be done in a month or two and the vaccine could see wider usage then, but there were some concerns with the phase 1 and 2 data so we will see. 

China has a LOT of vaccines that don’t have phase 3 data readily available but are being used in a lot of countries. CanSino Biologics’ Convidecia, Sinopharm’s BBIBP-CorV and Sinovac’s CoronaVac all have emergency use in many countries. Another one coming out is Sinopharm’s inactivated virus vaccine that is in phase 3. Hard to consider what is “coming out” and what is “out” 

Canadian based vaccine maker Medicago has a realllly interesting vaccine called  **CoVLP**: a plant based vaccine that uses plant cells to create protein shells that mimic Covid. The plant is a close relative of tobacco!! Phase 3 started in March so it won’t be too much longer for data to be revealed (phase 2 had really good results) and Canada has already ordered 75 million doses. 

Cuba has a vaccine from the Finlay Vaccine Institute, and the trial should be done by June... it’s another protein based vaccine. Not a lot is known about it, but there are trials going on in Iran which should add a bit of legitimacy. It could be out by the end of Q3 or Q4.

There’s been a lot of meme articles about it so you probably already know, but **QazVac** from Kazakhstan is ending phase 3 and could actually be available for the world by early Q4 if it works well. It uses deactivated virus to get an immuno response. 

French vaccine maker Valneva is using Dynavax technology to produce an inactivated viral based vaccine called **VLA2001**. It should be out in Q4, and the French have already placed an order for 100 million. 

There’s another protein based vaccine on the horizon that has all types of groups with their hands on it: it started as a SARS vaccine made by Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children’s hospital. They saw it could be tweaked to be effective against Covid. India’s Biological E took it up and bought the license and used technology from Dynavax to turn it into a full fledged Covid-19 vaccine. CEPI joined in on funding, and now the Biden administration is donating money for its production too. I don’t even think it has a name, but it’s moving at lightning paced, is well funded, and phase 3 trials started last month, so not only could it approved by Q3/Q4 but could have a lot of manufacturing power behind it. 

AnGes’ **AG0302-COVID19** is another DNA based vaccine that can be room temperature stored. It’s being produced by a few Japanese companies, and may be ready at the end of Q3 or Q4. 

Italian biotech company ReiThera worked with Lazzaro Spallanzani to make a viral vector vaccine using a harmless gorilla virus as the cell hijacker. It just started combined phase 2/3 but MIGHT be approved by the very end of the year. 

Iran’s Shafa Pharmed Par pharmaceutical company has a vaccine in phase 3 too, although almost nothing is known about it outside of it being a deactivated viral vaccine. If it finishes up before June, it could come out by the very end of Q4. 

There are dozens of vaccines in phase 2, but none of them are likely to come out this year.",,,1620150216,{},gwxl3xr,False,t3_n4dots,False,False,t1_gwvh2n0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n4dots/white_house_backs_pfizers_move_to_begin_vaccine/gwxl3xr/,1620191945,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,

**Interim findings from first-dose mass COVID-19 vaccination roll-out and COVID-19 hospital admissions in Scotland: a national prospective cohort study**

Between Dec 8, 2020, and Feb 22, 2021, a total of 1 331 993 people were vaccinated over the study period. The mean age of those vaccinated was 65·0 years (SD 16·2). The first dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was associated with a vaccine effect of 91% (95% CI 85–94) for reduced COVID-19 hospital admission at 28–34 days post-vaccination. Vaccine effect at the same time interval for the ChAdOx1 vaccine was 88% (95% CI 75–94). Results of combined vaccine effects against hospital admission due to COVID-19 were similar when restricting the analysis to those aged 80 years and older (83%, 95% CI 72–89 at 28–34 days post-vaccination).",,,1620087666,{},gwukr4b,False,t3_n43hgm,False,True,t1_gwtas8q,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n43hgm/analysis_confusion_over_masks_sparks_new/gwukr4b/,1620125578,1,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The U.S. recently announced 100 million people were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. But other dynamics are also in play, from new COVID-19 variants to the loosening of restrictions on school activities.

&gt;It's also worth noting that for the vast majority of the pandemic, the age group with the highest case rates has been 18 to 24 in the U.S., as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes.

…

&gt;We should note that kids still represent a really small proportion of the worst-case outcomes.

&gt;Yeah, that is true. It's a somewhat nuanced conversation though. In Michigan, they've been reporting higher rates of hospitalizations in kids than they had [been]. It's unclear to me if that simply represents intense transmission versus actually increased severity. I think that's not entirely clear yet. Here in Colorado, we have a little surge going on. In most states actually, cases are going down. We're still kind of in a plateau, maybe increasing a bit here in Colorado. We have seen a slight uptick of kids hospitalized with COVID-19 here at Children's Hospital, but it's not dramatically so, not like what we were seeing in November, December or January.

&gt;Now, the part where that conversation about severity gets a little bit more complicated is yes, it is absolutely true that it's less severe in kids than it is in adults, and particularly older adults. But it's also not true to say that it's completely benign in kids. Fortunately, pediatric death is a fairly rare event. But when you look at the top 10 causes of death, on an annual basis, this year, we've had, depending on whose numbers you use, somewhere between 300 and 600 pediatric deaths from COVID-19 so far. That's probably an undercount. And that would fit it somewhere in the top 10, somewhere between like No. 6 and No. 9 in terms of causes of death for children.

&gt;So the point I'm making, there is that yes, it's less severe, but it's still potentially a very severe disease. We've seen tens of thousands of hospitalizations already. So we do need a vaccine for children, not just to protect, not just to achieve herd immunity, but also to protect the children themselves.

Basically the other guys point was the data is too young and the sample size not enough.

Why wouldn't they just wait? Why wouldn't any company just wait for another to go first and fail or succeed?

Last Wednesday night, the night of getting vaccinated, he played frisbee outdoors with a group of his friends. Today he just learned that one of the player's brothers had confirmed COVID.

From [CDC on vaccine breakthroughs (Yes, I saw the limitations)](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html):

* 96,000,000+ US people were fully vaccinated as of 4/26/21
* 6,720 (0.0071%) had symptomatic COVID
* **594 (0.0006%) were hospitalized due to COVID**
* **112 (0.0001%) died from COVID**

Compare to: 

Est. deaths per million, IFR as %

* 0-17: 20         0.002%
* 18-49: 500     0.05%
* 50-64: 6,000  0.6%
* 65+: 90,000   9%

And on cutting down transmission, vaccinations have been HUGE. [A nationwide study from Israel's Ministry of Health saw a 94% reduction in transmission (see bottom table)](https://hividgm.ucsf.edu/covid-19-vaccines). More and more studies have been verifying cutting down transmissibility. 

These are incredible wins from the vaccination and deserves a ton of celebration.

That it's better to save face and have *no* vaccines when you need them than to lose face and have *some* vaccines when you need them?

If the EU had waited until AZ had better production capacity, it would have done fewer vaccinations and more people would have died. But it would *look* better, because no one would have under-delivered.

All those statements can be proven wrong with official statistics from, among others, Statistics of Sweden and the Swedish intensive care register.

The earlier goal was that this would be achieved in the end of June. It is the new official Swedish goal, not something [/u/nivenkos](https://www.reddit.com/u/nivenkos) pulled out of their ass.

The reasons cited for this delay are:

* Changed vaccine delivery prognosis
* Janssen's vaccine being suspended
* Persons under 65 that has been given one dose of AstraZeneca being able/recommended to choose an mRNA vaccine for their second dose
* Shorter intervals between doses (6 -&gt; 5 weeks for mRNA and 12 -&gt; 9 weeks for AZ)",,,1620083772,{},gwuclmc,False,t3_n3rx7h,False,True,t1_gwt39oq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n3rx7h/sweden_donates_1_million_oxfordaz_doses_to_covax/gwuclmc/,1620121156,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Removing the ability to get paid for building more factories means fewer factories are built.  It does exactly the opposite of what needs to happen.

Everyone wants to accelerate the worldwide vaccination effort - including all the vaccine makers.  We’re in a race to save lives, and we’ve seen unprecedented collaborations and massive investments in production.  

An IP waiver is simply not relevant to that process, because the manufacturing expertise and quality control processes are far more important to successfully producing vaccines.

In both families, the far-right people are somehow offended that the kids' parents are treating other people's vaccination status as a health risk for their kids.

There's already a massive conflict brewing and beginning to bubble over. Most people want to get vaccinated, but we're about to **slam** into a brick wall on those numbers once everyone who wants to be vaccinated has started their process.

I think there's a hope that social pressure and societal pressure will push people over the line into getting the vaccine. The moment the government really starts pushing hard on pro-vaccine messaging is the same moment a ton of those people will become vehemently anti-vaccine. If they can instead be passively convinced to get it by all the people they know then that's a big win.

More than that, there is a pretty difficult quagmire up ahead. Kids can be refused from public school without a vaccination record, but adults have a lot more protections and are likely to just lie if it suits them.

The statement is meant to be provocative. But at the same time there's a truth to it, a truth of the status quo. Ugly, unacceptable truth. 

Obviously putting it that way is not meant to accept that situation, it's meant to try to provoke more of a reaction, to wake people up. It's a kind of quiet, dark, everyday apocalyptic vision. I'm sure there's other ways of putting it that are similar. They're worth exploring, I think.

I do think there's a small segment of people who are still like the COVID morality police out there though.

Presenting real-world data on a subset of hospitalised COVID-19 patients in the UK, the researchers said the findings showed some level of ""vaccine failure"" but that this was ""not unexpected.""

""It's mostly occurring in the group which are most at risk of severe disease anyway, which is the elderly. These people are very frail and very elderly,"" said Calum Semple, a University of Liverpool professor of child health and outbreak medicine, who co-led the research.

""We're not saying the vaccine doesn't work,"" he told a briefing. ""In fact this is good real-world evidence of it working. But it also shows that the vaccine isn't perfect.""

The data, presented to the UK's Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies last week and published online by SAGE on Friday, showed that among just over 52,000 hospitalised COVID-19 patients studied, 526 had been vaccinated with a first dose of either the AstraZeneca or Pfizer shot at least three weeks earlier. Of those, 113 died.

The vast majority of the post-vaccination COVID-19 cases and fatalities were among vulnerable, elderly people, the researchers said.

AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine has been shown in clinical trials to be 76% effective against severe disease, while trials of the Pfizer shot found more than 90% efficacy.

Using first the Pfizer and then also AstraZeneca vaccines, Britain has one of the fastest COVID-19 vaccine rollouts in the world - with more than 33.8 million first doses given so far and a quarter of adults receiving two doses.

Earlier this month, Public Health England said the rollout had prevented more than 10,000 deaths of people aged 60 and older by the end of March.

Peter English, a specialist in communicable disease control, said the findings released on Friday confirmed ""that the vaccine is not 100% effective"" and were consistent with other data showing the overall positive impact of Britain's vaccination programme",,,1620113247,{},gwvqogo,True,t3_n4ifji,False,True,t3_n4ifji,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n4ifji/postvaccine_covid_infections_and_deaths_rare_uk/gwvqogo/,1620154020,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Then they pushed a low-ball herd immunity figure (going from 60-70% and steadily moving it up).  To quote the NY Times ""In a telephone interview the next day, Dr. Fauci acknowledged that he had slowly but deliberately been moving the goal posts. He is doing so, he said, partly based on new science, and partly on his gut feeling that the country is finally ready to hear what he really thinks.""

Now we're seeing an unwillingness to say fully vaccinated people can go back to normal life without masks because doing so will lower the social stigma and unvaccinated people will stop wearing masks as well.

Josie Lepe / Special to the Chronicle
Stanford Medicine on Wednesday began administering shots to children ages 2 to 5 in a trial for the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine, marking another step forward in getting younger children vaccinated.

&gt;	Stanford’s trial is part of a larger, nationwide Pfizer study that is testing the vaccine in children as young as 6 months old. The advancement of pediatric vaccine trials is important because even though children are at lower risk than adults of developing severe disease and dying from COVID-19, many have nonetheless fallen ill and died. It will also be critical to inoculate children in order to reach higher immunity levels in the overall population, since they can spread the virus to others even if they themselves do not become ill.

&gt;	“We need to make sure that children are protected,” said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a pediatric infectious diseases expert who is leading the trial at Stanford. “There’s been over 3 million children infected, thousands hospitalized and almost 300 deaths. Even though it’s not the half a million-plus adult deaths we’ve seen, we’ve seen an impact in children and we want to make sure they’re protected. And they can transmit to others so we want to make sure they can protect the community as well.”

&gt;	About 3.5 million children in the United States have been infected with COVID-19, representing about 13.5% of overall U.S. cases, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. And 347 children have died, representing less than 1% of overall U.S. COVID-19 deaths.

&gt;	Coronavirus vaccines are slated to be tested, authorized and rolled out in descending order by age. Currently, the Pfizer vaccine can be given to people as young as 16, and the Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines can be given to people as young as 18. Younger groups are expected to come next, starting with adolescents and younger teens, followed by children, toddlers and babies as young as 6 months old.

&gt;	Pfizer last week applied for Food and Drug Administration authorization for its vaccine to be used in youths ages 12 to 15, after clinical trial data showed it is 100% effective at preventing COVID-19 symptoms in that age group. The FDA could authorize that soon, and vaccines could start being administered to that age group by summer. Locally, Kaiser Permanente was part of that trial, enrolling teens in Santa Clara as well as in Sacramento.

&gt;	Results for Pfizer’s trial for people under 12 are expected the second half of this year.",,,1620104640,{},gwvg5v1,False,t3_n3u6kx,False,True,t1_gwuvgmf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n3u6kx/coronavirus_vaccine_updates_fda_expected_to/gwvg5v1/,1620144038,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;It's true that the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines have emergency use authorization from the FDA and not full approval yet.
But that's only because not enough time has passed to show how long the vaccines stay effective, Offit said.

&gt;""Frankly, the only real difference was in length of follow-up,"" he said. ""Typically, you like to see efficacy for a year or two years.""

&gt;He stressed that the vaccines' EUA status doesn't mean they're less safe. As a member of the FDA vaccine advisory committee, Offit said the vaccines are reviewed with the same level of scrutiny as they would to get full approval.


&gt;Dr. Paul Offit, is director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia and a member of the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee.

“Fauci responded that ""yes, absolutely,"" indoor dining is more dangerous than outdoor dining.

""If you’re going to go to a restaurant, try as best as you can to have outdoor seating that is properly spaced between the tables,"" Fauci recommended.

However, he added: ""I am not going to restaurants right now.""

MarketWatch reporter Quentin Fottrell said he's in Ireland, and thought about Fauci on a flight across the Atlantic.

""I wondered whether Dr. Fauci would get on a flight at the moment?"" Fottrell asked.

Here's how Fauci responded:

""Well, the answer is 'No' for the following reason: I am in a risk category. I don’t like to admit it, but I’m 79 years old. I can’t think of a reason to go trans-Atlantic. Right now, I’m very sequestered. “

Sure, some big guys stayed away from it, but maybe that's because they knew they didn't have the tech.

Oxford's vaccine appeared to be well on it's way before this thing hit big time.

And I can imagine Pfizer is going to be making healthy profits for the foreseeable future.

&gt; As the pace of U.S. vaccination slows, President Biden will announce a shift in federal strategy on Tuesday afternoon in an attempt to boost the campaign to get more shots in arms.

&gt; He will say that he is directing tens of thousands of pharmacies to offer walk-in appointments for coronavirus vaccine shots, creating more pop-up and mobile clinics and shipping more doses to rural clinics, all aimed at vaccinating 70 percent of American adults at least partially by July 4.

&gt; The federal government has also decided that if states do not order their full allocation of doses in any given week, that supply can be shipped to other states that want more. States previously were able to carry over to the following week doses that were available to them but that they did not order.

&gt; In an afternoon address, the president plans to pledge more funding for outreach campaigns designed to convince those reluctant to get shots of the need to protect their own health and that of others. Despite a flood of vaccine available, providers are administering about 2.29 million doses per day on average, about a 32 percent decrease from the peak of 3.38 million reported on April 13, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

&gt; Senior health officials have decided that herd immunity — the point at which the virus dies out for lack of hosts to transmit it — will likely remain elusive. But if 70 percent of the population is at least partially vaccinated, the nation can keep gradually removing restrictions that impede normal life, one senior administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity at a briefing for reporters.

&gt; The president will call for about 160 million adults to be fully vaccinated by Independence Day. As of Monday, more than 105 million Americans were fully vaccinated and at least 56 percent of adults — or 147 million people — had received at least one shot. That has contributed to a steep decline in infections, hospitalization and deaths across all age groups, federal officials said.

&gt; To increase availability of shots, the White House informed states that if they choose not to order their full allocation of vaccine each week, the doses will go back into a federal pool so that other states can draw on it, according to state and federal officials.

&gt; States that do not claim their full allotment one week will not be penalized because they will still be able to request the full amount the next week, officials said.

&gt; The shift, reported earlier Tuesday by The Washington Post, makes little difference to some states like Virginia that have routinely drawn down as many doses as the federal government was willing to ship. But it could help some states that are able to use more doses than the federal government allotted to them based on their population. They will now be allowed to ask for up to 50 percent more doses than the government allotted them.

&gt; Until now, White House officials had been unwilling to shift doses to states that were faster to administer them out of concern that rural areas or underserved communities would lose out to urban or richer areas where residents were more willing to get shots.

&gt; But with the pace of vaccination slowing nationwide, officials have determined that freeing up unused doses week by week will not exacerbate equity concerns. Some state officials have been arguing for the change for weeks.

&gt; Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said on Tuesday that the move offered governors more flexibility.

&gt; “Even just a few weeks ago we were in a different phase of our vaccination effort, when supply was more constrained and states, for the most part, were ordering at or near their full allocation,” she said.

&gt; Virginia is a case in point. Dr. Danny Avula, the state vaccine coordinator, said, “This past week was the first week when we didn’t need every single dose that was allocated to Virginia.”

&gt; Now, he said, “supply is exceeding demand across the state, and the work will be much slower and harder as we find ways to vaccinate a few people at a time.”",,,1620154084,{},gwxmqx8,True,t3_n4urwq,False,True,t3_n4urwq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n4urwq/biden_announces_a_strategy_change_as_the_pace_of/gwxmqx8/,1620192830,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Manufacturing isn’t easy, and that’s precisely the point:  if even a government backed facility like Emergent can’t get it right with direct assistance from the manufacturer, how exactly is a tiny company with no expertise in the field going to successfully reverse engineer and produce a vaccine at scale without support from the vaccine developer?  An IP waiver alone is entirely insufficient:  you need significant institutional knowledge to do this properly, because the manufacturing process is the most complex part of the whole effort.  There’s a reason the Emergent facility was turned over to J+J.

I don’t believe for a second that Biolyse is capable of safely reverse engineering and producing a COVID-19 vaccine in the way they claim they are - certainly not in the next 6-9 months.

To your second point, I think it’s important that all vaccines used the world over are produced in facilities that comply with GMP, wouldn’t you agree?  The developing world deserves vaccines made to the same high standards as everywhere else, and I think it’s offensive to suggest otherwise.

I think theres a good amount of people waiting for exams to finish.

Now, it's those who think the vaccine is the end-all cure-all, and they can gallivant to their heart's content because they can't take another aching day inside the house or wearing a simple little mask.

The social butterflies are suffering, so they are using the vaccine as their catalyst to do whatever they want now. Not realizing that we aren't even close to herd immunity (or ever will be, according to experts), and that there are tons of cases of breakthrough infections despite being fully vaccinated (and the more you're exposed to people, the more chances you have of getting it over time). Vaccinated people can also pass on the virus. Variants keep piling up and are already chipping away at vaccine efficiency. Eventually one will just punch through all vaccines like they don't exist, because people wanted to 'party hard'. There are still so many unknowns to Covid, yet people hang to the every word of the CDC, Fauci and other officials. Guess what, they still aren't 100% sure either. But they're willing to follow these 'experts' right off a cliff without hesitation.

Our way of life has changed drastically, and weak-minded people can't cope with the loss of their precious little social lives. We are basically in wartime right now, except the enemy is microscopic. Our ancestors handled way worse in the previous two world wars.

This can mean that you never show any symptoms, its highly likely if you are exposed to an early strain that you won't. Think of a bell chart with everything from no symptoms to flu like symptoms to hospital admission to ICU admission to death along the X axis. The vaccine drags the peak of the curve heavily left but significant mutations drag it back to the right bit by bit. A vaccine isn't so much a shield for your body as a thors hammer for your immune system and the difference is important, at least if we end up with 30 to 40% unvaccinated. The initial numbers do show that the vaccine is great at reducing the spread but that obviously only affects vaccinated people and there was only 1 significant variant in that population. Other studies show a significant reduction in efficacy of the vaccine against certain variants depending on the criteria, i.e. they still stop you dying but you are more likely to end up in the ICU. 

If we can manage to get herd immunity across the entire world it can be all but eradicated and the rate of mutation will be so slow that vaccines will remain highly effective.

Well that's not true. People have died from COVID after being fully vaccinated, so it is most certainly NOT 100%. 

Do you know where that 100% number came from ? It was from the trials, but the trials weren't designed to look for the effectiveness for that.  As such, that number is misleading (and now proven to be wrong.)  

For the trials, they sample size for deaths in the PLACEBO group was incredibly low. In fact, some of them had zero deaths in the placebo group (so would you say that the placebo was 100% effective in preventing deaths?)

[https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/03/pfizer-moderna-and-johnson-johnson-vaccines-compared/618226/](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/03/pfizer-moderna-and-johnson-johnson-vaccines-compared/618226/)

 

&gt;The two vaccine trials that did explicitly report hospitalizations as an efficacy outcome make this latter issue very clear. For the [AstraZeneca](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-epar-public-assessment-report_en.pdf) vaccine, one person in the control group had severe COVID-19, but eight people were hospitalized; for [Johnson &amp; Johnson](https://www.fda.gov/media/146217/download), 34 people in the placebo group had severe COVID-19, but only five people were hospitalized. It’s true that zero vaccinated people were hospitalized in either study after the vaccines took effect. But with numbers that small, you can’t draw a reliable conclusion about how high efficacy may be for these outcomes. As Diana Zuckerman of the National Center for Health Research [pointed out](https://www.center4research.org/testimony-of-dr-diana-zuckerman-of-nchr-before-the-fda-advisory-committee-on-j-j-covid-vaccine/) about the Johnson &amp; Johnson trial, **“It’s misleading to tell the public that nobody who was vaccinated was hospitalized unless you also tell them that only 5 people in the placebo group were hospitalized.”** She’s right. And you can’t be confident about predicting effectiveness precisely in a wider population outside the trial, either. For example, some of the vaccine trials included relatively few people older than 60 as participants.  
&gt;  
&gt;You can see how fragile these numbers are by looking at those compiled for severe disease. **In the** [**Pfizer trial**](https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download)**, for example, just one vaccinated person developed severe COVID-19 versus three in the placebo group—which meant that a single bout of disease made the difference between a calculated efficacy rate of 66 percent and one of 100 percent.** For the [Novavax](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-demonstrates-893-efficacy-uk-phase-3) and [Oxford-AstraZeneca](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-epar-public-assessment-report_en.pdf) trials, there were zero people with severe disease in the vaccinated group versus only one in the control group, so adding or subtracting one would have been even more dramatic. **The problem is even greater for deaths. For that efficacy analysis, only two of the vaccine trials—for Moderna’s and Johnson &amp; Johnson’s—reported any COVID-19 deaths at all in the control groups.**",,,1620088054,{},gwuljzr,False,t3_n406w1,False,True,t1_gwu8xbf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n406w1/vaccinated_but_wont_go_out_the_rise_of_covid/gwuljzr/,1620126018,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Furthermore, waiving the IP for a new vaccine which is only approved under an EUA is totally unprecedented and there is no regulatory road map at all for it. Anyone telling you they know how it would go or how long it would take does not know what they are talking about.

I shared my story in the hopes that people who are happier with more introverted things that they discovered during COVID don't feel alone - that's a normal response, too.

I think even the anti-maskers are dealing with this by strongly desiring a very rapid return to pre-COVID ""normalcy"" (as normal as 2019 life was, anyway) because changes to that normalcy make them uncomfortable and even anxious and this is their way of handling it.  You see that in the heavy count of drinking-oriented things on Meetup, as those types of events represent a social ""normal"" to some that they strongly desire to return to, particularly strong extroverts (and some who become strong extroverts with social lubricant and really like feeling that way) who feel most ""normal"" in social situations like bars.

&gt;I think if this was still a major risk, that would be a huge deal and we'd be talking about the vaccines totally failing. But anxiety's favorite phrase is ""But you never know..."" The only way I know of to really put anxiety to bed comes from Buddhism: Detachment, which basically means not just being okay with loss, but expecting it and loving what you have anyway, like enjoying summer even though there will always be a winter ahead.
&gt;
&gt;Follow your train of thought to the end of your fears, and then imagine what you would do in response, and what you'll find is that your life would be just fine. Having to live at 80% lung capacity might be a major problem if you're an athlete, but otherwise your life will not really change. And if you are an athlete, you'll lose something precious to you and have to learn to live without it, which is so common a human experience that we can just say ""That's life."" And I mean that in a positive way; life's beauty includes loss and all the pain and subsequent renewal it entails. 

This doesn't totally help you, though, because I also checked and there are no conversations about loss of arm use by the vaccine.

During a meeting in Hanoi on May 4, Dam, who is also head of the National Steering Committee for COVID-19 Prevention and Control, said this outbreak is different from the previous three ones due to pressure from the southwestern border and quicker spread of new variants from India.

He also reiterated a need to prepare for a plan in response to a scenario of having 30,000 infection cases, adding that all must strive to not make it happen.

Dam ordered that from 0:00 on May 4, all who have finished 14-day quarantine in concentrated facilities and tested negative for the coronavirus twice must temporarily stay there.

It is a must to enhance the monitoring of the pandemic in the community, zone off affected areas and wipe it out as soon as possible, he said.

Warning of illegal entries across the border, he called on border guards, authorities and mass organisations from border provinces to keep a close watch over immigrants.

Speaking at the event, Health Minister Nguyen Thanh Long urged localities to seriously follow directions of the Party Central Committee's Secretariat, Government, Prime Minister, the National Steering Committee for COVID-19 Prevention and Control as well as guidelines of the Health Ministry, ministries and agencies concerned because the transmission risk is very high.

He underscored a need to continue following the 5K principle, including compulsory mask wearing in public places.

According to him, the Health Ministry is stepping up negotiations to bring vaccines to Vietnam and facilitate technological transfer to produce vaccines at home.

The ministry reported that as of May 4, the world recorded more than 153 million COVID-19 cases, including over 3.2 million deaths.

sometimes, something happens and a replicating thing may lose the ability to replicate things perfectly, or at all. 

these imperfect replications, be they from natural variance or existential factor, are called mutations. 

mutations can do pretty much anything. or nothing. a mutation can kill a replicating thing. it can make a replicating thing not replicate (GMO mosquitos!)

It can enhance a thing that a replicating thing does as well. sometimes it can even enhance a replicating things ability to replicate. 

when these mutations help a replicating thing to replicate, chances are it will also help the next replicating thing also to replicate. so these mutations get passed on to the next generation. 

this works for everything, from thumbs to protein hooks. how well you smell to where your smell detector is. 

for viruses however, evolving to kill your host isnt always the best practice. 

Eventually you run out of hosts to kill, and you end your own blood line. 

so, sometimes a virus may evolve to be less ""deadly"" (meaning it loses whatever trait harms the host, or does it less effectively) simply because it has more places to live when it doesn't kill things. that doesnt mean it stays that way, it can always re-evolve other deadlier mutations, or simply re-activate older, inactive mutations.

 this isnt something the virus knowingly does, its just how evolutionary statistics work.",,,1620130108,{},gwwbb55,False,t3_n4ld3d,False,True,t1_gww7unt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/n4ld3d/n440k_covid_variant_mutant_n440k_10_times_more/gwwbb55/,1620166239,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,
