There have been real studies showing that ivermectin can inhibit the COVID-19 virus on cells in a lab - just no reliable ones that suggest it works just as well in the human body.

Here's the appropriate paper: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2793536/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2793536/)

My summary: Yes, protein synthesis errors occur, at a rate of about one per 20,000 amino acids.  When they do, the ribosome slows down new synthesis of that protein, new errors accumulate (we don't know why), and the protein is terminated by peptides that break it down before it finishes (we don't know what triggers the termination).  Synthesis has to reach the stop codon at the end of the mRNA molecule to trigger a specific process that releases the protein from the cell, so incomplete or erroneous proteins never make it out

As I read the article what has been noted is that there are variations in the rna sequence of the µ that have correlated with 'antibody escape' in other variants. Here's the trick. Each of these changes either does or doesn't result in a change in the amino acid sequence of a final viral protein. Each 'codon' (sequence of three) in the rna codes for an amino acid, but sometimes changing one nucleotide in the code doesn't change the amino acid. 

But let's assume it *does* change an amino acid. It isn't so simple. Here's [an article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02039-y) with a 3D representation of the worrisome 'spike protein'. Antibodies recognize not a sequence so much as a 3D part of this structure. A change in the amino acid sequence may or may not alter the final shape and the part the antibody recognizes. It may change the shape of this part so that the antibody fails to recognize it. 'Antibody escape' - which has been noted in studies of other variants. 

But here's the final complication. The 3D shape of the protein and the sites antibodies recognize vary not just with one amino acid substitution but with the other amino acids in the final protein. Whether an antibody recognition site becomes inoperative depends not just on one amino acid but on what other amino acids, both nearby and sometimes far away, are. Substitutions may result in no change, slight change or massive change in the final shape. Think of it as a complicated 3D jigsaw puzzle. 

So, while people have found substitutions that affect antibody affinity in other cases, these are 'other cases'. Whether this is the case with µ awaits further binding studies on the variant itself. It's a clue not a conclusion.",,,,1630712363,{},hbibcv8,True,t3_phej5o,False,False,t1_hbhyatp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/phej5o/heres_what_we_know_about_the_mu_variant/hbibcv8/,1630803928.0,12,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;She had hoped that might happen by now. Instead, she is scrambling to find a tutor.

As someone having had 3 total of Pfizer, #1 was just a really sore arm, but #2 and #3 were almost identical in side effects.  I didn't mind the side effects at all though since they were just sore arm, fever, and malaise which helped reassure me that I was getting a good immune response.

If getting children vaccinated doesn’t reduce transmission/spread by any significant amount, and the chances of poor outcomes in children are astronomically low, the benefit of them getting vaccinated vs the chance of known side effects/risk (small as it may be) from the vaccine itself becomes much less of a straightforward, or easy, decision.

There are other options with vaccinations, like one dose of mRNA (as opposed to two), that may be better options for children, which aren’t even being addressed.  Given what we know about the risk to children from SARS-CoV-2, there is a strong argument for not being hasty about rolling out vaccinations to children yet and waiting a little longer to do more studies, get more data, and make the most rational response.  

There is lots of finger pointing at the anti-vax crowd for being irrational, and justifiably so.  However, I see lots of irrational behavior from the pro-vax crowd as well. One of the most recent examples being everyone going along with bad advice from the CDC earlier this year related to ditching masks once you have been vaccinated.

Vaccines aren’t some magic solution to the Covid problem. This isn’t smallpox, measles, polio, etc… Vaccines play a helpful role, but we need to be reasonable about addressing their efficacy as well as their safety, especially as it relates to children who aren’t able to make a decision in as an informed a way as an adult is.

It reduces your chances of developing serious illness--for now. But now we find out that boosters are needed at 5 months. Will the next booster be required at 4 months? Who knows? With delta, vaccines don't prevent infection. And vaccinated people are spreading it now, either because delta creates higher viral load or because of partial resistance or waning antibodies. Countries with much higher vaccination rates than the US are still seeing a big delta surge. Fauci said we have to accept the possibility that a strongly resistant mutation will emerge. Your summation seems overly rosy or based on hope. Speaking of hope, our CDC director, Walensky, said that booster strategy is inspired by hope, and that the evidence  for success is thin. That's because Israel is just a few weeks in and it's basically a big study with no control group.

It is entirely unclear that the vaccine strategy is going to work. As the rest of the world is vaccinated, it's going to go just as it has gone in wealthy countries: a slow and incomplete rollout that combines the rampant spread through unvaccinated pockets with the selective pressure toward resistance applied by vaccinated groups.

[],,nicolettesue,,,[],,,,text,t2_54i3o,False,False,[],"Uh, I would not say we are doing well even if we are doing better than FL or TX on a per-capita basis. Our peak for the current surge (3,983) is about 72% of the peak for our summer surge last year. Hard to say if we have peaked or if we’re simply plateauing; we’ll have a better view in a few weeks. 

Differences between this year and last year:
* Last year we had some mitigation strategies in place (many schools were virtual, mask mandates were in place, many businesses were still working remotely, etc.)
* This year our only mitigation strategy is the vaccine. There are some businesses still working remotely and some schools districts defying the governor’s no mask mandate order, but life is by and large back to “normal” for many. 
 
It’s clear that the vaccines are working well, but surges like this should be times that we reach for additional mitigation strategies (e.g., masks) and our governor has gone out of his way to remove that option from public (not private) schools and local governments. 

We aren’t really set up to handle this long-term as covid becomes endemic. Our ONLY strategy is to recommend vaccination, even though kids under 12 can’t currently get it and a huge chunk of our population just doesn’t want it. We won’t even incentivize vaccination like other states. Our state health department will not recommend masks on ANY of their daily communications regarding case counts; only vaccination. 

Make no mistake, Ducey is just as bad as DeSantis and Abbott on covid; it just doesn’t look that bad because he got lucky. I think we’ve got a fair amount of herd immunity (~50% of our population is vaccinated and ~15% of our population is confirmed to have covid). Even though “only” 15% of our population has been confirmed to have covid, the actual number is likely higher, probably significantly higher due to people just not testing for whatever reason. 

I worry about what happens when snowbirds return to the state. I hope they’re all willing to get their vaccine boosters, otherwise we’re gonna have a hard time in hospitals again this winter.",,,,1630765597,{},hbkld5b,False,t3_phiap2,False,False,t1_hbje84l,/r/Coronavirus/comments/phiap2/mu_covid_variant_los_angeles_officials_say_first/hbkld5b/,1630844789.0,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Heart inflammation is mainly observed after the second dose, agreed Dr Han Woong Kim, associate professor of medicine, Department of Cardiology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina.  


  
In people who have experienced myocarditis after the first dose, they appear to have previously had COVID-19 infection, Kim noted. This suggests that myocarditis following mRNA vaccination requires an initial exposure, either from COVID-19 infection itself or from the first dose of an mRNA vaccine, he added. It is possible that in people who received a different technology for their first dose, and then switched to an mRNA vaccine for their second dose, these people could also experience heart inflammation issues, though more data is needed, de Lemos noted.  


  
According to a 10 June CDC presentation detailing US vaccine safety data collected through 31 May, most heart inflammation events were observed after the second dose (573 events) compared with the first dose (216 events). Also, these side effects were primarily observed in younger men, particularly in the 16–39-year-old age group.

&gt;Tomorrow, CDC will publish two new studies in the MMWR [Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report] that specifically look at COVID-19 and children....  
             
&gt;...one thing is clear: Cases, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations are much lower among children in communities with higher vaccination rates.  Vaccination works.  
          
&gt;The first study analyzed data from hospitals in 99 counties across 14 states and found that the hospitalization rate against — among unvaccinated adolescents, those aged 12 to 17, was nearly 10 times higher than that among fully vaccinated adolescents during the month of July.  
       
&gt;The second study looked at national cases, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations and found that in August 2021, the rate of hospitalization for children was nearly four times higher in states with the lowest overall vaccination coverage when compared to states with high overall vaccination coverage.   
          
&gt;Both of these studies included data from the past two months, when the Delta variant became the predominant variant across the country. As cases were increasing throughout July and August, the number of children getting sick with COVID was also increasing. From late June to mid-August, in the context of low community vaccination coverage and the rapid spread of the Delta variant, cases for children and adolescents 17 and under increased by nearly tenfold, which aligns with the increase seen for the general population.      
         
&gt;What is clear from these data is community-level vaccination coverage protects our children. As the number of COVID-19 cases increase in the community, the number of children getting sick, presenting to the emergency room, and being admitted to the hospital will also increase.  
    
&gt;We know what we need to do to protect our children: get vaccinated, wear masks, and follow CDC guidance. We must come together to ensure that our children, indeed our future, remain safe and healthy during this time.

&gt;Tomorrow, CDC will publish two new studies in the MMWR [Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report] that specifically look at COVID-19 and children....  
             
&gt;...one thing is clear: Cases, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations are much lower among children in communities with higher vaccination rates.  Vaccination works.  
          
&gt;The first study analyzed data from hospitals in 99 counties across 14 states and found that the hospitalization rate against — among unvaccinated adolescents, those aged 12 to 17, was nearly 10 times higher than that among fully vaccinated adolescents during the month of July.  
       
&gt;The second study looked at national cases, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations and found that in August 2021, the rate of hospitalization for children was nearly four times higher in states with the lowest overall vaccination coverage when compared to states with high overall vaccination coverage.   
          
&gt;Both of these studies included data from the past two months, when the Delta variant became the predominant variant across the country. As cases were increasing throughout July and August, the number of children getting sick with COVID was also increasing. From late June to mid-August, in the context of low community vaccination coverage and the rapid spread of the Delta variant, cases for children and adolescents 17 and under increased by nearly tenfold, which aligns with the increase seen for the general population.      
         
&gt;What is clear from these data is community-level vaccination coverage protects our children. As the number of COVID-19 cases increase in the community, the number of children getting sick, presenting to the emergency room, and being admitted to the hospital will also increase.  
    
&gt;We know what we need to do to protect our children: get vaccinated, wear masks, and follow CDC guidance. We must come together to ensure that our children, indeed our future, remain safe and healthy during this time.

In this study, filtration efficiency of different respirators, face masks, and a 2-ply cotton handkerchief bandana was compared for particles in the size range of 60 nm-4 μm under a “perfect fit” condition. The filtration efficiency at the most penetrating particle size of 0.3 μm on average ranged from 83-99% for N95 and KN95 respirators, 42-88% for surgical masks, 16-23% for cloth masks, and 9% for bandana. We also investigated the effects of using double surgical masks or layering a cloth mask over various surgical masks in terms of their filtration characteristics. In most of these combinations, the filtration efficiency improved by ~25% for particles 0.3-1 μm in diameter without any substantial change in the filter quality factor when compared to the highest of the individual mask results. To investigate the reusability of cotton cloth masks, 2-layer cotton fabric sample coupons were machine washed and dried for 52 cycles leading to an increase in inhalation resistance (~20 Pa) without affecting size-resolved filtration efficiency. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that washing and drying led to the gradual deconstruction of cotton fibers at the scale of several micrometers to hundreds of nanometers in the form of delamination of the fiber wall and fibrillation of the nanofiber constituents. Results indicate that cloth masks may be layered over surgical masks for additional benefits, and that cloth masks made out of cotton fabric can be washed and reused numerous times without a significant loss in filtration efficiency.",,,,1630711821,{},hbiaa32,False,t3_phg0xd,False,False,t3_phg0xd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/phg0xd/filtration_performance_of_layering_masks_and_face/hbiaa32/,1630803377.0,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,True

[],,Obelisp,,,[],,,,text,t2_qftde,False,False,,"You're really desperate to be right about something, but you don't get to win by shutting off your eyes and brain. So let me explain this simple concept to you one. last. time. OP muddied the waters with the meaning of current and future funding. So I quantified the amount of years of funding provided by the current trust fund and also future inflows. That's it. You repeatedly ignored the future part and pretend like I only said the current trust fund will be used. Converting dollars to years is extremely commonplace. Like when you hear the rule of thumb to have 6 months of savings, the trust fund provides 2.6 years of ""savings."" Now don't try to claim I'm assuming future revenues could vanish--they won't. IT'S JUST A QUANTIFICATION. If inflows were equal to outflows it would never become insolvent. But since they're falling and will create a deficit the answer is somewhere between 0 and infinity. The answer is projected to be 12 years, and that's INCLUDING the current trust fund. Get it? 

You must need a good rest after all that goalpost-moving. First you claim inflows will be enough, then that they won't be worse than they were 50 years ago (lol), then that all the actuaries are wrong and exaggerated clickbait proves it, then that it won't hit -300B at some point, then that it'll just have one bad year due to COVID and if there's a problem then let future generations deal with it. All I've been advocating for is the facts--and you've been staunchly opposed every step of the way. 

I don't care about news and clickbait headlines. What matters is The Office of the Chief Actuary. The news just references the annual trustees report anyway and spin it. So [let's look at the 2004 report](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR04/IV_LRest.html#wp265723) and see for OASI the projected first year of  deficit was expected be 2018. Guess when the OASI first ran a deficit? [Yep, 2018.](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2021/IV_A_SRest.html#307256) 2019 and 2020 have had razor thin margins as well--hardly reassuring. Note that 2018 was the intermediate ""best estimate"" projection--the best case was estimated to be as late as 2022. That's how projection work: you input assumptions using the best data available and you get an answer that you know will not be exactly right, and will vary because the future will not match expectations exactly. But an estimate HAS to be made so we can prepare for the future. 

 More importantly, in 2004 it was projected that the trust fund would be depleted in 2044. Then 2008 happened and in 2009 it dropped to [2037](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2009/IV_LRest.html#239829). Waddya know, the economy is hard to predict and it changes projections! In [2016](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2016/IV_B_LRest.html#378399) it was 2035. In 2020 it was 2034 and now it dropped to [2033](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2021/IV_B_LRest.html#378399). This all is completely contrary to your drivel that they're making it all up and moving back the big date.

They're also downplaying that Israel's trends are showing up in data here. The issue is many studies are failing to recognize that delta decreased antibody efficiency on top of it waning, and that *has* reduced protection. They mix in pre-delta data to create a misleading picture of where things stand today. You could *maybe* argue for more conclusive data for boosters for the young and healthy, but seniors and high risk people clearly need them at 5-6, not 8, and now, not a month or two from now. The link between antibody levels and effectiveness, and that boosters help both, is a lot better established than they suggest.

Notes:

* NBC and Civiqs polls were of adults

* NBC poll was conducted Aug 14-17, 2021

* Civiqs poll is from Sep 2, 2021.

* CDC and KFF data were adjusted to represent the rate for people 12 or older using data [here](https://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/8446-child-population-by-race-and-age-group?loc=1&amp;loct=1#detailed/1/any/false/1729/68,69,67,12,70,66,71,13|62,63/17077,17078) and [here](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-kits/2020/population-estimates-detailed.html).

* CDC and KFF demographic data are missing for many vaccinations. In the case of the CDC, only 63.8% of vaccinations had associated race/ethnicity data.

* CDC and KFF data do not include some states that do not report race/ethnicity data.

The reason for the discrepancy between the CDC/KFF race/ethnicity vaccination rates and the vaccination rate of all individuals 12 or older is that the CDC and KFF rely on state reporting for their demographic data, and many of the reported vaccinations do not include demographic data. For example, only 63.8% of vaccinations reported to the CDC had associated race/ethnicity data. It's possible (I would say probable) that the missing CDC and KFF demographic data are not proportional to the known data (i.e., vaccinations among black people may be undercounted by more than among white people). This could explain why polls show higher vaccination rates for black people than white people, while the reported data show the opposite.",,,,1630727936,{},hbj4sb2,False,t3_phbwew,False,True,t1_hbi7kbb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/phbwew/brazil_overtakes_us_in_firstdose_count_after/hbj4sb2/,1630818913.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,True

The district is focused on their metrics and results.  In normal times, this is great, but they have already failed by failing to adapt.
I have a feeling that if they transition back to virtual education, they will fail to meet their objectives and key results, and this probably why they went all in for in person.  

I'll admit the state didn't help, but there were districts that bootstrapped and prepared in the absence of state leadership / guidance.

Personally, the worst part is the messaging they put out. It always feels alienating.  This may have been unintentional, but it didn't feel that way.  For example, they held up high people who stuck to tradition and attended in person, and they made no effort to acknowledge the extra effort or sacrifice parents faced with virtual education.

[],,Synonyms26,,,[],,,,text,t2_10wdsu,False,False,,"1) The paper who linked was about modelling for **incidence rate**, not **peak prediction in the context of widespread community spread**, which is the topic of discussion at hand. Vietnam does use modelling for incidence rate. It just doesn't use peak prediction in the context of widespread community spread, which is what I'm actually calling complete idiocy, not the modelling.

&gt;What's idiotic about knowing when your hospital system would be the most strained and then prepare for it? Like you said, total recorded infections in Vietnam has crossed 500000 so why not create a model to understand when will things peak? 

2) It's the peak prediction in the context of widespread community spread that's idiotic, not the incidence rate modelling. You're conflating 2 entirely different things: one is a mathematical tool for people to make the right policies to contain and eradicate the virus, the other is snake-oil originally peddled by politicians and snake-oil salesmen in the west to open everything up in the middle of widespread community spread for the sake of the economy instead actually eradicating the virus.

3) The basis of ""peak prediction"" in the context of widespread community cases as has been touted by the snake-oil salesmen and politicians in the west was 1) the pseudoscientific take on herd immunity without vaccine, and 2) wishful thinking about the virus by people who probably thought that the theory of evolution is just an unproven hypothesis:

* The first international mention of peak prediction was in a series of advice by WHO to the old Wuhan leaders (who had been fired for a year now) back in Jan-Feb, where the WHO advisors told the old Wuhan leaders that the virus will ""run its course and then die out or grow less lethal in time because else the virus will run out of hosts and can't survive"". This narrative was proven wrong when the old Wuhan leaders followed the stupid advice and blew up Wuhan, and proven wrong again when leaders in the west followed it and blew up their own countries, and the proven wrong the third time when the old HCMC leaders (now fired) followed it and blew up HCMC. Meanwhile, anyone with some basic knowledge of critical thinking and/or natural selection would detect that the virus doesn't have a brain and therefore can't know that it ""should"" grow less lethal or it will run out of host (which is also false). They people who backed this ""will grow less lethal"" hypothesis reasoned that since humanity hasn't died out yet from a pandemic, it means that humanity won't ever die out from a pandemic ever, which doesn't make sense at all. Furthermore, in real life, HIV has been around for decades and has shown no sign of weakening at all, tuberculosis even longer, and then there's the Black Death that almost wiped out Europe and scores of human population/civilizations that were really wiped out for real by pandemics (i.e. native Americans). From the ""POV"" of the virus, there's also nothing that distinguish humans from the forest mice populations that are routinely wiped out by diseases. **The virus doesn't have a brain** for it to know that it ""should"" grow less lethal to continue existing. Peak prediction is only useful when it's used in the context of **ZeroCovid** strategies to judge how effective eradication policies are.
* Secondly, the herd immunity without vaccine idiocy was initially created based on the (blatantly racist, groundless, and politically-charged) assumption that China was underreporting by 5 times of the actual case count. You can go check the early articles back in Jan-April posted in this very sub for the progression of this herd immunity stupidity. Then covid hit the west and the snake-oil salesmen changed their tune to say that it was the healthcare systems of their countries that were fucking up the numbers, not their ""peak prediction"" that was wrong. And because to the snakeoil salesmen, the actual numbers are always 5 times the reported number, **it means that secretly everyone in the community was already infected, just asymptomatic or immune, and therefore they had reached ""herd immunity"", so the epidemic has secretly ""peaked"" and would go down any moment now**! Only for the reported number to increase again over their ""peak"" and proved them wrong (last I counted the ""peak predictions"" were wrong around 4 times in 2020, hence the habit to count waves when realistically speaking, the US never eradicated the first ""wave"" in the first place for there to be a distinction for a ""second wave""). While it's true that to some extent, every country is miscounting, but jumping from ""miscounting is inevitable"" to ""we have all been secretly infected and therefore we're magically immune"" is a leap of logic fueled purely by wishful thinking (and a great amount of sunk cost fallacy).
* Thirdly, both the herd immunity and the ""less lethal"" hypothesis are fundamentally based on the false premise that the virus will run out of hosts, which, as real life has proven wrong several times over now. This outcome should have been easy enough to see because the world has **10 billion** people, and that's not counting the variants, which are a lot because the world has 10 billion potential incubators. Herd immunity is only useful when vaccination is being discussed.

4) Zero Covid countries use cluster model, not wave model. Fundamentally, covid spreads not in wave but in clusters, with its spread highly dependent on environmental factors and the social structure of the community. Vietnam, despite no longer being Zero Covid at the moment, is still aiming at Zero Covid goal and continues to cluster model (aside from the old HCMC leaders who used the wave model and blew up HCMC to the point of widespread community spread in the first place). It only looked like ""waves"" in the west because people in charge were trying to justify their proven false ""peak predictions"". The only reasonable use of waves is for Zero Covid countries, where each wave originated from different original F0 and primary clusters for each wave, with clear cut ZeroCovid space in between the different waves. Even in the west, modelling of covid spread has moved on from wave model to cluster model since March this year: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00466-021-01999-2",,,,1630737225,{},hbjidiv,True,t3_ph67vg,False,True,t1_hbja58u,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ph67vg/việt_nam_reports_record_high_number_of_covid19/hbjidiv/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,422fac61f7f208c583016c910d87ffe60a8aee0f,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1630737238.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

You're still not acknowledging that the NIH has strong reason to believe it's worth the time and money effort to study ivermectin and that you made that expert-sounding statement that it would be absurd to think a drug for parasites could work for a virus. Of course, when a proven treatment (monoclonal antibodies) is available,it makes much more sense to prescribe that. The evidence for ivermectin is, so far, inconclusive, and awaits the conclusion of a standard double blind study.

There have been three published metastudies on ivermectin, two of which showed a high certainty of strong efficacy. In the study that showed doubtful benefit, there was still no harm shown to patients using it for covid. The risk is nil. 
Many countries are waiting for vaccines and, for poor countries, monoclonal antibodies will likely never be an option. So it makes perfect sense for a doctor in Mexico City to prescribe ivermectin as either prophylaxis or treatment. It's cheap and has been dropped into African countries for decades because the risk is so low. And even in Japan, the Tokyo medical association made an open call for doctors to prescribe ivermectin. See, everything in the world doesn't revolve around the US political divisiveness that surrounds covid and ivermectin.

Even in the US, monoclonal antibodies are not always easy to get. A friend of mine was sick with covid and went to the hospital when his blood oxygen started dropping. He asked about antibody treatment and they said it wasn't conclusive that he had pneumonia, so they refused.

Notes:

* NBC, Morninig Consult, and Civiqs polls were of adults

* NBC poll was conducted Aug 14-17, 2021

* Morning Consult poll was conducted Aug 17-23, 2021

* Civiqs poll is from Sep 2, 2021 (not sure what date range this represents)

* CDC and KFF demographic data are missing for many vaccinations. In the case of the CDC, only 63.8% of vaccinations had associated race/ethnicity data.

* CDC and KFF data do not include some states that do not report race/ethnicity data.

* The CDC and KFF data appear to be for total population, so I adjusted the numbers using estimated 2019 population data from the US Census Bureau available [here](https://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/8446-child-population-by-race-and-age-group?loc=1&amp;loct=1#detailed/1/any/false/1729/68,69,67,12,70,66,71,13|62,63/17077,17078) and [here](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-kits/2020/population-estimates-detailed.html). My calculated rate is a*r/b where a is the total population of the given demographic group, r is the vaccination rate given by the CDC or KFF, and b is the population 12 years of age or older for the given demographic group.

It seems like the missing CDC and KFF demographic data could be biasing those results in unkowable ways. The Morning Consult poll also gives a very different picture from the NBC and Civiqs polls, especialy for the vacination rate among black people. One thing I haven't accounted for is the [huge difference in age distributions by race/ethnicity](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/30/most-common-age-among-us-racial-ethnic-groups/). I wonder how much these age differences could account for differences in vaccination rates by race/ethnicity.

[],,Delicious-Tachyons,,,[],,,,text,t2_clanjhww,False,False,[],"I want to give you comfort that it indeed does work - however it's no panacea. People get the idea that vaccines should stop everything dead before the person even gets infected with something - but it's more that it builds up your defence so next time you encounter it you kick its ass. It's unfortunate that this virus comes on like a champ.

I've been watching the daily numbers from Ontario, Canada (I'm in BC, Canada but our daily numbers don't include who's vaccinated, etc, we get that weekly only).

Anyhow, so the majority of people there are fully vaccinated. 76.72% of all people over the age of 12.

So, looking at effectiveness, over a trailing week (a week is a good amount of data versus a day which can have a blip either way), the cases are 5.89x higher for unvaccinated people when you correct for the population difference.. so take all the vaccinated people, divide the number of cases by it, multiply by a large number so it's readable, and do the same for unvaccinated.  Being 5.89x higher means that the vaccine is 83% effective at preventing illness.  That's pretty good. Not super. But good enough for now aside from being a hermit that interacts with noone ever.

As for ICU cases, per million, Ontario has 103 unvaccinated people and 8 partial and 12 fully vaccinated people in the ICU. Corrected for proportions, an unvaccinated person is 24.91x more likely to end up in the ICU than a vaccinated person. That means the vaccine is 96% effective at keeping your ass out of the place where they stick tubes in you. Noone likes tubes.

That's pretty damn good. Because getting sick - yeah it sucks, hope that with a mild case you don't end up with long covid problems... but keeping you out of the ICU is key.

Note that the data there isn't stratified by age either and you know vaccines don't work great in 80+ year old people due to a lack of naive t-cells to program, so god knows if all 12 of those vaccinated people in ICU are senior citizens or not.`",,,,1630743429,{},hbjpq2s,False,t3_phhyye,False,True,t1_hbj3v5r,/r/Coronavirus/comments/phhyye/oscar_de_la_hoya_hospitalized_with_covid19_days/hbjpq2s/,1630829256.0,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) pose a threat to human immunity induced by natural infection and vaccination. We assessed the recognition of three VOCs (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1) in cohorts of COVID-19 convalescent patients (n = 69) and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine recipients (n = 50). Spike binding and neutralization against all three VOCs were substantially reduced in most individuals, with the largest four- to sevenfold reduction in neutralization being observed against B.1.351. While hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and vaccinees maintained sufficient neutralizing titers against all three VOCs, 39% of nonhospitalized patients exhibited no detectable neutralization against B.1.351. Moreover, monoclonal neutralizing antibodies show sharp reductions in their binding kinetics and neutralizing potential to B.1.351 and P.1 but not to B.1.1.7. These data have implications for the degree to which pre-existing immunity can protect against subsequent infection with VOCs and informs policy makers of susceptibility to globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.",,,,1630773352,{},hbl2j07,True,t3_phut9z,False,False,t3_phut9z,/r/Coronavirus/comments/phut9z/emerging_sarscov2_variants_of_concern_evade/hbl2j07/,1630854063.0,35,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,nerdpox,,,[],,,,text,t2_4bmqi,False,False,[],"Yeah, in India with less that 15 percent vaccination coverage in June. Of course people didn't think it had the potential for the headaches we're now experiencing with breakthrough. Globally, we had already been through more transmissive variants like Alpha and even the single mutations like D614G last summer (2020), so it's not like that was news with regards to higher transmission. Similarly in the midwest where the vaccination percentage by June (mostly) wasn't particularly encouraging either, why would anyone be surprised that the virus was still spreading, especially another variant? 

&gt;Of course it was going to spread all over the world.

I feel the need to debunk this, specifically. The crucial fact is that just because a variant gains prevalence in a particular region doesn't mean it's going to take over globally. Look at P.1, everyone was losing their fucking minds earlier this year over Brazil after the Manaus outbreak, and yet P1 never took over globally as Delta has. Same with the Beta variant from SA. They out competed the ancestral strain but did not attain global dominance as Delta has. Ancestral strain + D614G (which never got a name) took over globally by July 2020, so again, it's not like that hadn't been seen before. 

**We do not have the ability to predict which variants of concern will become global monsters until it's basically already happening.** Yes, India got fucking pummeled by Delta, but during a period with basically no vaccine coverage, so that naturally didn't raise concern that Delta might evade vaccines. Besides, at the time, it was promulgated (by lots of very smart scientists and researchers who people listen to and I respect) that above a certain percentage, immunity would quash outbreaks, so with _certain parts of the country_ already at 70 percent (the coverage number previously touted) in June, why wouldn't those areas move for rolling back restrictions? For god's sake, nationally respected doctors and scientists said it was prudent. Again, hindsight.

I will also state for the record, that I never (even months ago) said that places with low vaccine coverage should relax their rules. Highly vaccinated areas only. 

All due respect but your theory of the narrative doesn't hold up to the reality of the situation at the time. In hindsight, I do agree that relaxing rules may not have been the best move, but again, don't pretend like at the time it was a wholly bad decision.

OR you can definitely walk in to Walgreens, CVS, Target, Walmart Supercenters, or Publix and get it right then and there.  Done. Go back in 3-4 weeks if applicable. This is a GREAT option if you don’t want to deal with any online forms. 

I chose to make an appointment because I like to know details ahead of time - it’s just my personality.  With CVS/Walgreens, you enter your information on their website and pick a date/time/location. They tell you which vaccine you’ll be getting and if you provide a phone number they’ll text you a reminder.  

As far as choosing which vaccine, don’t sweat it. All the vaccines will protect you from serious illness and greatly reduce your chances of getting and passing on an infection.  Pfizer is the most widely available one right now.  It, like the others available in the US, has been studied extensively and has already been approved as a third or “booster” dose for some people with conditions affecting their immune systems.

Before they were so adamant about natural, god given immunity, but then once they were in the hospital it all changed. I believe they will or have gotten a vaccine after that incident.

With how much this virus and its many variants have affected us, I wouldn’t be surprised if at least every family in this country and maybe even the world will have that one family member case, whether it be through that member’s arrogance or them having an unlucky breakthrough case. 

My mind is starting to shift and compare all of these variants and the scenario we are in to life with the flu. Half of society was probably so-so on that virus’ vaccine, while others took it yearly. At least with that there are certain anti-viral treatments (Tamiflu) you can have prescribed to you if diagnosed early enough. I feel once something similar comes out for Covid that is **FDA approved** we may reach that similar time before March 2020. 

True, we can still try to push how great the vaccine is, but sadly there will just be people who won’t ever trust the vaccine but are quick to probably take stuff like Tamiflu.

Because you lack imagination (and are missing a few braincells) let me give you some example thoughts that might float through a 12 year old's head about covid that could make them anxious 

* Kids are going to the hospital. Could I go to the hospital?
* Could I give this to my siblings and they could go the hospital?
* Am I wearing my mask right? Who have I secretly killed when I took it off for a quick sec to eat/drink?
* If I don't do this right, could I kill my teacher?
* they say even old people who get vaccinated can still go to the hospital. I don't want to make my grandparents go to the hospital.
* My throat tickles, do I have covid??
* I hear the class other there had to stay home because half the class caught covid
* I heard one kid got it and it was fine, except now he can't taste anything and he hates it
* I keep hearing about people's parents being in thr hospital and on vents. My parents are vaccinated, but I don't know whose parents aren't. I don't want to hurt my friend's parents.

I could keep going, but there is a lot a 12 year can be stressed about with covid. They are 12, but living in a bubble disconnected from society. In many ways their fears are overblown and in some ways they are not, but being 12 they have no way to know.

[],,TrollfaceMcGee,,,[],,,,text,t2_44w7g,False,False,[],"I suspect the article is attempting to downplay the magnitude of difference in antibodies (neutralizing titers against SARS-CoV-2) before and after a third dose of an mRNA vaccine.  

Pfizer's booster trial's initially published data found that when comparing the difference between the peak/largest amount of antibodies after dose #2 was taken (usually occurs in 1-2 week of the dose), and the amount of antibodies   8 months after dose #2 is less than 20% of the original peak/largest amount of antibodies.  8 months is coincidentally the current suggested time to wait until getting the booster.

Now after getting the 3rd dose, the study showed the count of antibodies rose over 2000% from the low point found at 8 months, or compared against the dose #2 peak, it still rose around 400% or more.  

Now obviously it isn't guaranteed that getting a 400%/2000% boost in antibodies will prevent infection or symptoms, but there have been more and more studies correlating the level of antibodies/titers and the seriousness of symptoms.  Higher number of titers correlates to less severity or even being asymptomatic.  

I would guess this article is being pushed so that the poorer countries can be prioritized getting their first vaccinations before the wealthier countries give themselves boosters as the world health org has asked. 

I can't speak to other states, but in SC there are a couple of hospital systems that report the number of COVID cases and break it out by vaccinated vs unvaccinated.  The numbers I've seen over the past couple of weeks have been consistently reporting very close to 10% of their hospitalized as vaccinated aka breakthrough, with around the same percentages for those COVID patients in the ICU and those on ventilators .

Here are the numbers from the largest hospital system that were reported on 09/03:

The US situation is even more skewed because 12-17s have been eligible for full vaccination for a while, whilst the impact of vaccination in this age group in the UK will be much lower because the large majority are not eligible, and then the large majority of those who are eligible have only recently become eligible, with 16 and 17 year olds only eligible for one dose. So if we were using comparable patients I'd guess the hospitalisation rate is about triple in the US.

Everything you are worrying about is at least 100x more risky with COVID than it is with the vax. And if you get the vax you can stop worrying, whereas if you're just waiting to see if you get COVID (and there's a pretty high chance you will sometime this year with Delta if you aren't vaxxed), then you're just going to keep worrying.

Also, as far as side effects, you might realistically be prepared to not feel well for a day. I got common side effects, and I did feel wiped out with chills and a restless night. However, it was way better than even a cold because it was only for around 12 hours, whereas even a cold you feel bad for a week.

As far as what vaccine, there are three choices. I would personally recommend Pfizer to you, it's probably the best one to get by default. Moderna protects against COVID more but has more chance of side effects. Johnson and Johnson is still a great vaccine and is far better than nothing and if you really want one and done then I'd recommend it. However, it likely doesn't protect as well, has more dangerous side effects though mainly for young women, and worst of all there's a lack of data so we have less understanding how best to proceed forward.

It's media echo chamber bubbles filled with propaganda designed to make people reactionary. It really is that simple, and there is a compounding effect where the more you are exposed to it (without being aware of what it is), the more susceptible you are to its intended effect.

People who had side effects with either mRNA or adenovirus-vectored vaccines, even if short term, may be open to switching technologies if available, Thomas said.  


  
Currently, people are encouraged to stick with the same vaccine technology, even if it may mean waiting for several weeks for subsequent doses, said Edward Dougherty, a principal at his eponymous Washington DC-based healthcare consulting firm.

Many children have lost parents and caregivers to covid, not to mention how an order of magnitude more who will suffer because of long covid/ongoing post-viral chronic illness in their homes. Schools likely cannot return to normal until kids are vaccinated. It's not a simple equation. My sense is that authorities are being overly cautious about vaccinating kids -- not without reason -- while the risk/reward equation for child vaccination has been clear ever since delta took off. 

I understand it's far easier to make these calls as a casual observer than as an actual authority though. The stakes are extremely high, and the risk/reward equation for a bureaucrat always favours caution and certainty over fast action. That makes handling a fast-moving crisis very difficult.",,,,1630777712,{},hblcezp,False,t3_phmql9,False,False,t1_hbkjtj5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/phmql9/daily_discussion_thread_september_04_2021/hblcezp/,1630859648.0,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

As long as it's not more contagious than delta, it's basically kept in check by it, and may even eventually just disappear like some earlier strains. I would say, mu is something to keep an eye out for but not something to worry over right now.

“Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) prohibited employers from limiting employees’ activities related to “collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.” The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the body charged with enforcing the NLRA, has interpreted Section 7 to mean that employees have a right to discuss salary and wages. *See*, NLRB v. Brookshire Grocery Co., 919 F.2d 359 (5th Circuit, 1990). The NLRA applies to virtually all private-sector employers, only exempting federal, state, and local governments, employers subject to the Railway Labor Act, and those who only employ agricultural workers.”

Basically, the NLRA protects most employees’ right to discuss their salary. Some employers may enact restrictions on talking about it while at work, but employees can discuss salary on their own time.

Field Hospitals No. 4 and 11 and Củ Chi Field Hospital are treating children who cannot stay at home. If the cases become severe, the patients are brought to the City Children’s Hospital and Children’s Hospitals No. 1 and 2.    
  
Many of them have underlying health conditions such as obesity, leading to difficulties in treatment. Most of them, however, have recovered.  
  
On August 15, a 15-year-old male COVID-19 patient from District 8, for example, had acute respiratory distress syndrome, a life-threatening lung injury that allows fluid to leak into the lungs.   
  
The patient, who weighed 135 kilogrammes, was prescribed high-flow nasal cannula therapy that delivers oxygen. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and other medicines were also used for treatment. After two weeks of treatment, the patient no longer needed nasal cannula therapy and is now recovering.  
  
A 15-year-old girl with severe COVID-19 and obesity also recovered after four weeks of treatment at the hospital.  
  
Dr Trương Hữu Khanh, former head of the infectious and nervous diseases department at Children’s Hospital No.1, said: “More and more children are contracting COVID-19 in the city. However, most cases are mild and they recover rapidly. Only children who are overweight or obese can become worse when contracting COVID-19.”  
  
Children’s Hospital No.1 said that it also has admitted severe COVID-19 cases at various ages. A 21-day-old infant, for example, was hospitalised due to a fever and a SpO2 oxygen saturation level of 88 per cent. After being treated for COVID-19, the child is now recovering.  
  
Infants who contract COVID-19 should be closely supervised so that severe symptoms can be detected and treated in time. Doctors said that parents should take their children to health facilities for screening and testing if they have a fever, cough or other symptoms.

Getting a covid-19 vaccine is actually a great way to protect your health and protect yourself from getting very sick and missing a lot of work. Right now in the United States and the rest of the world, it's basically a choice between getting covid-19 while having a vaccine to protect you or getting covid-19 unvaccinated. When you are vaccinated, your chances of being so sick that you need to go to the hospital is much much lower than if you are not vaccinated. A vaccine basically teaches your immune system how to recognize a specific bad guy, such as covid-19, without also getting exposed to a dangerous virus. This way your immune system is prepared to fight and keep you healthy.

Some reasons to get vaccinated.
UAB doctor talks about which vaccines You can get why--If you are over 18, any of the three vaccines, Johnson and Johnson, Pfizer or moderna are a great choice!

But basically it went from around 10,000 cases in mid-June, then increased to around 45,000 new cases in mid-July, then jumped to around 150,000 cases in mid-August, and it looks to be lower than that in  mid-September, maybe significantly. Also, don't get me wrong, infecting 5% (or maybe more) of the population in a three month period, is not a job well done, it's part of the complete failure of the Southern U.S. to control this pandemic.

Those entering restaurants or bars in Jefferson and Clallam counties must provide proof they are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 beginning Saturday, the North Olympic Peninsula health officer announced on Thursday, the same day that three new COVID-19 deaths were reported both counties combined.

Two Jefferson County residents and one Clallam County resident were confirmed to have died from the novel coronavirus on Thursday. All had underlying health conditions and were unvaccinated.

That raises the total Peninsula death toll to 28.
Clallam County also added 105 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Thursday, raising its total number of cases to 2,899 since the pandemic began.

Jefferson County confirmed 22 cases of COVID-19 on Thursday, raising its total number of cases to 735 since the pandemic began.
The two who died of COVID-19 in Jefferson County include a man in his 60s who died Saturday, but officials were notified Thursday, and a woman in her 50s who died Tuesday, Berry said.
The Clallam County death was a woman in her 80s, Berry said.
“These are likely to come as a shock to the Jefferson County community,” Berry said regarding the recent deaths. “In Jefferson County, we’ve only had four deaths so far … and we’ve had two in the last week.

“There’s an unfortunate tendency I’m hearing when someone dies — especially when they’re unvaccinated — that we kind of blame them for their death, and I think it’s important to remember this is someone’s family member in our community, and someone is grieving the loss of someone they love Friday,” she continued

Let’s all be kind and focus on fighting the virus and not each other,” Berry said.
Input from business
The proof-of-vaccination requirement was decided after talks Berry and public health department staffers had with chambers of commerce representatives on the Peninsula and some businesses, Berry said.

They highlighted that the vaccination requirement would be less costly and less damaging to restaurants and bars than capacity restrictions or take-out only, Berry said.
“Indoor bars and restaurants are known to pose a high risk for COVID-19 transmission, as they encourage unmasking of large groups of people indoors,” said Berry in a press release Thursday.

“Our goal is to make these safer places to be and to reduce transmission in our communities, allowing our hospitals to keep functioning and our schools to open more safely.”
The delta variant has the capacity to spread farther than 6 feet when people are unmasked indoors, said Berry, who added that it was decided “that a vaccine requirement will be more effective and less costly than the capacity limitations we saw last year.

We want to keep businesses open while protecting the public,” Berry said.
“This is how we do it. The bars and restaurants have to enforce it, but they’re not the ones who wrote it.
“Be kind to the restaurant workers. They’re just trying to do their jobs.”

Virtual briefing Friday
The public health order will be discussed further during a virtual briefing at 10 a.m. Friday.
Due to a “high level of interest” in Friday’s Clallam County Emergency Management COVID-19 briefing, Berry and Undersheriff Ron Cameron will conduct it remotely with no in-person attendance permitted.
The meeting can be viewed at www.clallam.net/features/meetings.html and questions can be submitted to rcameron@co.clallam.wa.us.
Some residents have opposed the new order. Port Hadlock resident Jodi Wilke is frustrated with the change of the meeting from in-person to virtual, as she feels it limits residents’ ability to be involved in decision-making.
Wilke is urging residents to attend the virtual meeting and submit their questions, as she believes the public should have had a say in the mitigation measures that Berry mandated.

“Our public officials should take their job seriously as a servant to the public,” Wilke said. “There are a lot of people who are going to be hurt by this.”
Acceptable forms of proof of vaccination include a completed CDC vaccination card, a state Department of Health Certificate of COVID-19 Vaccination, a printed copy of a state Department of Health vaccine record, a photograph of any of those documents, or an app-based vaccine passport, the release said.

Those who are unvaccinated can still receive orders to go or use outdoor seating areas, Berry said.
A person is fully vaccinated after having received all the required doses of a vaccine for COVID-19 and 14 days have passed since the final dose, according to the order.
Both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines require two doses taken four and three weeks apart, respectively. Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine requires one dose.

Employees of bars and restaurants who mask continuously while in the building do not need to provide proof of vaccination. Additionally, children younger than 12, who are ineligible for vaccination, may enter without showing proof, the order said.

Case rates soar
Clallam County has a case rate of 964 cases per 100,000 for the past two weeks as of Thursday. Jefferson County calculates its case rate weekly and on Monday reported a rate of 247.65 per 100,000 for the two weeks prior as of Saturday.",,,,1630766440,{},hbkn68p,True,t3_phsnrs,False,False,t3_phsnrs,/r/Coronavirus/comments/phsnrs/proof_of_vaccination_required_to_enter_peninsula/hbkn68p/,1630845753.0,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are “several real-world studies,” says Mamtani, including from the Israel Ministry of Health and the Mayo Clinic which “point to the trend of waning vaccine efficacy (VE), including against hospitalization and death.” For example, according to the Israel Ministry of Health, for those vaccinated with Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine in Jan-Feb 2021, the vaccine’s efficacy rate by July had dropped to 42% against infection and 75% against hospitalization, factors which coincided with the spread of the Delta variant in Israel.

One was to determine Brilacidin’s Selectivity Index which helps to determine a drug’s safety profile and effectiveness. The second objective was to use this testing to validate and optimize dosage levels and frequency to be used in human CV19 trials. In the B-ABSSSI phase 2, Brilacidin was a 1 dose IV treatment protocol. One of the exciting things about the B-CV19 human trial was a 3 day dose treatment on the first 25% (30 or so patients) and after an extensive 3 week DMC review, a green light approval to expand the remaining 75% (90 or so patients) to a 5 day dose regiment. This highlights the safety profile of Brilacidin for CV19 and is consistent with the safety profile that was proven in prior Brilacidin FDA trials for B-ABSSSI, B-IBD UPS and B-OM using 3 different delivery mechanisms.  
The selectivity index (SI) is a ratio that measures the window between cytotoxicity and antiviral activity by dividing the given AVA value into the TOX value (AVA/TOX).  
From ScienceDirect “Selectivity index (SI) can be defined as the ratio of the toxic concentration of a sample against its effective bioactive concentration \[56\]. The ideal drug should have a relatively high toxic concentration but with a very low active concentration.”  
===========================================================  
From 7/20/20 IPIX PR  
“Additional RBL testing will assess Brilacidin’s inhibition against SARS-CoV-2 in the human lung epithelial cell line at even lower concentrations to allow for accurate determination of Brilacidin IC50 and IC90 values—the drug concentration at which 50 percent and 90 percent of the virus is inhibited. IC90 rather than IC50 values are considered valuable measures of drug potency as they are more likely to reflect in vitro results translating to comparable results in humans.”  
From 8/24/20 IPIX PR  
“In a new experiment at the RBL in a human lung epithelial cell line, Brilacidin, when directly incubated with the live (or wild type) virus, was shown to inhibit the virus by 50 percent (the IC50 value) at a mid-nanomolar concentration, while remaining non-cytotoxic to cells at high micromolar concentrations—establishing a SI for Brilacidin greater than 300 in this lung cell line. Additionally, this new testing in the human lung cell line showed Brilacidin’s IC90 value to be in the low micromolar range.”",,LOW_SCORE,,1630768543,{},hbkrpcl,False,t3_phmql9,False,True,t3_phmql9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/phmql9/daily_discussion_thread_september_04_2021/hbkrpcl/,1630848088.0,-9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

I left my wife and children in China just before the lockdowns to visit my grandparents in the USA for Spring Festival. A day after I arrived stateside lockdowns in Wuhan were mentioned and I was scared for my family. I was separated from them for 7 weeks due to fight cancellations and travel restrictions. The warnings for the world were plain and obvious to a bystander like me. 
Any shifting of blame to China for their bungling of the situation is, to me, a bit silly. Yes they bungled it, but what the hell does that say for regions as prosperous as the USA that still break COVID infection records.

We hurried to get tested once we started having symptoms, and somehow I never tested positive during or the weeks after. I had taken about four tests on separate occasions since.

She ended up losing her sense of smell and taste for a little over a week. She was definitely miserable eating. I know I like to eat and would be devastated if I lost my taste for that long, but I think she only just realized how much she enjoys food too. Everything was just bland and she didn’t even want to eat anything anymore.

Music isn't a commodity that can simply be replaced with other music of similar ""quality"" (even if music was something that could be considered to have or not quality). Music is a cultural phenomenon that we as human give or take value from based on many aspects from our lives, many that aren't even impacted by the possible quality of the music in question.

I can think that Dave Mustaine is a racist conservative asshole but playing Hangar 18 in Guitar Hero with a person back in 2011 will still be the reason we bonded over initially and we are best friends today. Steven Tyler might be another conservative and misogynistic asshole but Aerosmith is still my mother's favorite band, my childhood's soundtrack and my initiation into rock. Michael Jackson might be a child molester but Bad is still the song that was playing while I had my first kiss.

Are there bands of artists that produce equivalent or even better quality music than Megadeth, Aerosmith or Michael Jackson? Probably, but the cultural significance that they bring to me as a human is independent from their musical quality or even from the humans behind all the actual musician that produced it. 

I don't think I can simply stop listening to Aerosmith and simply change it for Cheap Trick or something, not because Cheap Trick is worse, but because it doesn't have any significant cultural value to my life. And at the same time, I don't think that stopping consuming their music will bring any change to anyone, Mustaine and Tyler won't become more progressive because I (or even a considerable portion of their fans) stop listening to them for their politics or actions and I think that I won't become just as racist/misogynistic/conservative as long as I can separate the cultural/musical product that is the songs that I listen to from the political ideologies or bad actions either taken by their creators of even spoken in the songs themselves (for example, the American nationalism and islamophobia sprouted in Megadeth's last album Dystopia).",,,,1630788142,{},hblzftx,False,t3_phspmt,False,False,t1_hblq7k8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/phspmt/neil_young_on_concerts_in_the_covid_age_these_are/hblzftx/,1630872469.0,99,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,1,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think this is a problem, because in situations where time is of the essence, you need to be able to deal with risks that, were they real, would be devastating, even if they’re not fully articulated or understood. And I’m aware that Long Covid notoriously evades classification or understanding, but the takeaway from some seems to be “leave it off the table” when thinking strategically about risk, which is why these kinds of recommendations continue to treat hospitalization and death as the only metrics worth worrying about.

And no it’s not necessarily “science” to deal with hypotheticals, it’s risk calculus and game theory, depending on if you consider those to be “science” or not.

What I read somewhere (sorry, no citation) is that once it's on a surface it doesn't really get airborne again without basically blowing on that surface to kick it back up, so you'd have to touch the surface, and then somehow get that touch into your lungs somehow. It'd have to be a pretty specific chain of events, compared to the normal airborne breathing thing.

I suspect that a vaccinated person might shed some small amount of virus, depending on how fast their body reacts to it, but it might not be enough to infect all but the most close contact compared to a more infected non-vaccinated or inoculated individual. Can it spread from vaccinated people? Sure, anything's possible.

Anecdote: I was at a wedding this summer, with a reception that was indoors but with a lot of open windows to the outside. High percentage of vaccinated individuals and only 4 or 5 kids. Probably 100-150 people. Someone a day after the wedding had symptoms and tested COVID positive despite having had the J&amp;J vaccine in the spring. Very mild case apparently. Confirmed Delta variant. The couple let everyone that came to the wedding know, and specifically told the people that they knew had close contact with that person to get tested. Something like 25-30 people reported back all tested COVID negative. There was no spread as a result of the wedding.

Even if that doesn't mean anything about how much the vaccines prevent transmission, it's clear that if most people are vaccinated, even without masks and spending several hours in the same room, the vaccines prevented the virus from spreading.",,,,1630780689,{},hblj0n0,False,t3_phs982,False,False,t1_hblhgzy,/r/Coronavirus/comments/phs982/more_kids_hospitalized_with_covid19_in_us_states/hblj0n0/,1630863361.0,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is why a new vaccine is needed for the seasonal flu each year. The virus mutates so that the previous vaccine no longer provides an effective immune response to the new strain of the same influenza virus.

finding out a classmate was hospitalized.

My son is vaxxed, the school quarantined 8 other students in the class who sat around this student who was in hospital. 

They told my son no need to test or quarantine as he is vaccinated.

Few days later he started getting mild symptoms (fatigue).  Shortly after (2-3) days we (mom &amp; dad) started getting mild symptoms as well. 

PCR testing confirmed positive. School stated it is our choice if we quarantine!

I told the school nurse we will quarantine as I am not gonna contribute to the spread of this virus.

They wound up having to quarantine 45+ students from this one confirmed positive. 

I will say this, i caught Covid last year in December and it was one of the scariest things I ever went through and I consider my case a light one.

The fatigue was incredible, there were times as I drifted to sleep, as it pulled me down, I was convinced if I gave into it, if I stopped fighting the fatigue, I was not gonna wake up. I still tear up when I think about my kids trying to wake me up,  worried I was dead or dying because I was not responsive to their shaking or calling my name.

It took 3 months for me to recover fully from brain fog and fatigue to point I felt like myself again.

I was vaccinated in May (Pfizer). I don't know if it is original antibodies,  the vaccine or a combination of both but this time around, I only got a mild sore throat,  a light intermittent cough, and a little congestion. 

If i did not know I was positive,  i would have thought it was just my allergies acting up.

I am convinced the vaccine works. My kids are both vaxxed and pretty much asymptmatic.  Wife and I have very light symptoms.  The student my son caught it from is unvaxxed and had to be hospitalized. 

I guess my point is, get vaccinated! I plan on getting the booster in November as well.",,,,1630762297,{'gid_1': 1},hbkepca,False,t3_phk53g,False,False,t3_phk53g,/r/Coronavirus/comments/phk53g/all_kindergarten_teachers_at_a_san_antonio_elem/hbkepca/,1630841462.0,477,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,3,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;	“Our study provides strong evidence that mask wearing can interrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. It also suggests that filtration efficiency is important. This includes the fit of the mask as well as the materials from which it is made. **A cloth mask is certainly better than nothing. But now might be a good time to consider upgrading to a surgical mask.**”

Here are some points from the [study](https://www.poverty-action.org/study/impact-mask-distribution-and-promotion-mask-uptake-and-covid-19-bangladesh) itself:

&gt;	Villages where cloth masks were distributed experienced a **5 percent** reduction in symptoms, while villages where surgical masks were distributed saw a reduction of **12 percent**.

&gt;	The materials used to make surgical masks have a higher filtration efficiency than the types of cloth typically used to make cloth masks, but cloth masks can be sewn without specialized equipment and can have less leakage because they fit the face more closely.

&gt;	“**If mask-wearing rates were higher, we would expect to see an even bigger impact on transmission**,” Luby said. “But even at this level, we saw the largest impact on older people who are at greater risk of death from COVID-19.”",,,,1630762005,{},hbke5ww,False,t3_phr82c,False,True,t3_phr82c,/r/Coronavirus/comments/phr82c/surgical_masks_reduce_covid19_spread_largescale/hbke5ww/,,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],False,0249183513877ca79054ea4c45063dc0b584bab4,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,1630762018.0,True,r/Coronavirus,public,

The point of lockdowns was to buy us time.  We used that time.

We figured out that masks work.

We developed and distributed several widely-available vaccines.

 They (management, HR) started to ask people, but we're not in healthcare.

We closed offices for in-person stuff in April 2020 and they set a target for reopening of October 2020. That got pushed back to January 2021, which got pushed back again and again. Currently, offices are to remain closed with all employees remote unless absolutely necessary (i.e. security and sometimes IT has to access the server room) until January 2022. They've also permanently closed at least 4 office locations and set those employees up to be permanently remote.

My condolences to the young adults in this story.

[],,Noisy_Toy,,,[],,,,text,t2_9c3wg,False,True,[],"SAVANNAH, Ga. -- Martin and Trina Daniel, married for over 20 years, both died of COVID-19 within hours of each other, leaving behind two teenage children facing an unimaginable loss.

The Daniels met at Savannah State University in the 1990s before Martin Daniel headed to Tuskegee University in Alabama for graduate school, their nephew, Cornelius Daniel, told ABC News.

The couple settled in Savannah, Georgia, where they raised two children: Miles, now 18, and Marina, 15.

Trina was a stay-at-home mom who loved supporting her immediate and extended family while Martin worked as a chemist, Cornelius Daniel said.

""He loved being a chemist,"" he said. ""One of the reasons I went to Tuskegee was because he went there.""

The Daniels' niece, Quintella Daniel, added that she went to Savannah State because of her uncle.

""He was just a very motivational person,"" she said.




When the COVID-19 pandemic erupted, Quintella, a nurse, headed to New York City, the first U.S. epicenter, calling it ""a life-changing experience.""

""You may have a lot of people, 10 or 20 people, waiting for one to die to get on a ventilator,"" she said. ""I thank God every day that about 35 tests I took there ... I never had COVID.""

Martin, 53, Trina, 49, and their teenagers -- all unvaccinated -- contracted COVID-19 in June, the family said.

Cornelius Daniel said his aunt and uncle were hesitant to get vaccinated in part due to the legacy of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, which charted syphilis progression in unknowing Black men from the 1930s to the 1970s.

Martin Daniel had ""a stubborn attitude toward vaccines in general,"" Cornelius said.

""He trusted the vaccines that had been around for awhile,"" like for polio, but felt the COVID-19 vaccines were developed too quickly, Cornelius said. (The quick COVID-19 vaccine development was possible because of decades of prior scientific studies demonstrating safety, as well as an unprecedented multibillion-dollar commitment by the federal government to accelerate research.)




The Daniels eventually came around to the idea and were scheduled to get the vaccine in mid-July -- the week after they died, their nephew said. The Daniels' symptoms hit at the end of June and quickly ""spiraled out of control"" around July 4.

Martin Daniel died at home on July 6. Trina was hospitalized and died that night, the family said.

""We were already taken aback by his passing, but to have to endure the passing of her ... was traumatizing,"" Cornelius said.

Miles and Marina, battling COVID-19 while their parents died, went to the hospital on July 7 for treatment. They were released hours later, Cornelius said, but had to quarantine for two weeks while dealing with the loss of both parents.

After a painful month, both teens are ""doing well"" and ""adjusting to the new normal,"" Cornelius said.

The family dropped off Miles at college this weekend and Marina is beginning her sophomore year of high school.

Miles and Marina now plan to get vaccinated, Cornelius said, adding that he hopes others who haven't yet gotten the shot will follow the teens' lead.

""The only bullets we have right now in our gun are the vaccines,"" Cornelius said. ""So I would prefer a vaccine over a ventilator every day. Too many families have already experienced the pain that we're feeling.""",,,,1630787367,{},hblxqbw,False,t3_phyazs,False,True,t3_phyazs,/r/Coronavirus/comments/phyazs/unvaccinated_couple_die_of_covid19_hours_apart/hblxqbw/,1630871548.0,15,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;	“It’s notable that even though fewer than 50% of the people in the intervention villages wore masks in public places, we still saw a significant risk reduction in symptomatic COVID-19 in these communities, particularly in elderly, more vulnerable people.”

…

&gt;	“Our study provides strong evidence that mask wearing can interrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. It also suggests that filtration efficiency is important. This includes the fit of the mask as well as the materials from which it is made. **A cloth mask is certainly better than nothing. But now might be a good time to consider upgrading to a surgical mask.**”

Here are two relevant points from the [study](https://www.poverty-action.org/study/impact-mask-distribution-and-promotion-mask-uptake-and-covid-19-bangladesh) itself:

&gt;	Villages where cloth masks were distributed experienced a **5 percent** reduction in symptoms, while villages where surgical masks were distributed saw a reduction of **12 percent**.

…

&gt;	The materials used to make surgical masks have a higher filtration efficiency than the types of cloth typically used to make cloth masks, but cloth masks can be sewn without specialized equipment and can have less leakage because they fit the face more closely.

It is important to note that less than half of those included in the study were wearing any mask:

&gt;	“If mask-wearing rates were higher, we would expect to see an even bigger impact on transmission,” Luby said. “But even at this level, we saw the largest impact on older people who are at greater risk of death from COVID-19.”",,,,1630761367,{},hbkcyio,False,t3_phiv4r,False,True,t1_hbk7l5l,/r/Coronavirus/comments/phiv4r/why_cloth_masks_are_on_some_airlines_nofly_lists/hbkcyio/,1630840570.0,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because even with the vaccine you are only 40% protected and you have a significant ability to spread the virus. 

What % of serious are you?

50% serious = you getting the vaccine and still going out

100% serious = you getting the vaccine and staying home by yourself
