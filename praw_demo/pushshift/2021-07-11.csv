Firstly, I personally think *death* by COVID is unnecessarily over-applied to the broader audience. Of course, there *have* been examples of younger people dying, and though they're extremely rare, especially compared to those of a certain age group/health condition, it can happen - but of course, purposely fear mongering on that isn't right.

But death isn't the only thing to worry about. The trouble I've had with people I know is that they're confident they'll survive COVID. Sure, they probably will, but survival isn't everything. Long COVID/damage after recovery has been shown to occur, more and more so (naturally we would never know about these effects until *later)* and I think that's hugely important. Plus, COVID puts you out of work for two weeks, perhaps longer. It could put your co-workers out of work. It then puts yours/theirs family members (who may also be working/at school) at risk/out of work/school. And, each time it passes, there's a chance of mutation.

Quick note - we've had four mutations since the beginning, with one being rather nasty. I'm not an expert by any means, and I try to use common sense to the best ability I can, but that's *four* mutations *with* supposedly lockdown/distancing/PPE applications. Is that normal? I know the mutations aren't crazy higher in lethality, but that's still not good. I know you're not advocating at all for restrictions to be lifted, it's just to reiterate the lesser dangers...

But to the vaccine - you're so right in that information isn't great to come by, and it has been muddled/messy (note I personally think this is down to *incompetence* rather than maliciousness - politicians are fucking dumb).

That said, I think one way to look at all this is risk management. You know as well as I do it's *really* hard to continue these restrictions. I personally have zero issue with them but the average person probably wants to have their life back. The world does need to continue, people need to work.

So, first, it comes down to what I initially commented (about this vs that). I agree, you can never bully people into taking something - it has to be given as information, as clear as possible, and then they can make their own decision. (Note I've not seen any bullying from countries nor have I felt the pressure to but then I don't read everything so I can't say it does/doesn't exist.) But how long can these restrictions be forced into place? Again, I'm more than happy to buckle down and continue on but the average person probably isn't.

Then it comes to the vaccine. First, as I understand, hasn't the mRNA been worked on for 50 odd years? I'm in no way an immunologist/science whiz (maybe you can tell) but isn't that *some* indication of knowledge of what could happen? Perhaps you're right, and I'm happy to say I don't know, that there *could* be side effects that are damaging in the future, but surely we know that COVID *will be* as opposed to the maybe/hopefully smaller chance of the vaccine going bad.

Bottom line, as I understand, is to nip this in the bud (if this can still be considered a bud to be nipped.) The more often COVID is passed, the more likely it'll mutate. If you just vaccine the older/at risk patients, COVID is *still* passed between those without like an ever growing hot potato. They may not be at risk initially, like you said, death rates are crazy low for low ages, but that's for *this* and *these* current variants.

In a perfect world, we'd be like NZ. They did a pretty damn good job. But that's an island, a small one, and the world isn't perfect. Would you think this is an *maybe* imperfect solution to an *most definitely* imperfect world?

I'm sorry if that's all over the place. I don't ever want to push the vaccine nor do I want to imply COVID isn't bad. Information is best and people can make their own decisions. You make some great points, and it's so complicated. That said, I think the vaccine does more than help prevent death/illness - it's to get the world back and running, even if it means taking a risk - because *a lot* of the world sadly won't wait.",,,,1626079254,{},h4wfcl8,False,t3_oi21of,False,True,t1_h4w0wu9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oi21of/its_not_just_about_you_experts_say_getting_a/h4wfcl8/,1626247374,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;What went wrong?

&gt;A joint investigation by The Kansas City Star and Columbia University’s Brown Institute for Media Innovation reveals how June became a lost month in the fight to slow the spread of delta across Missouri. Thousands of pages of internal emails and other documents from 19 local health departments trace the growing alarm and a sense of near-resignation among officials about their chances of halting the advance of the variant.

&gt;The consequences of the squandered month will last well into summer. CoxHealth, a major Springfield hospital, told The Star it’s bracing for hospitalizations to rise for weeks to come. Delta is still spreading and has now been found in the Kansas City and St. Louis areas, though state officials hope higher vaccination rates in those places will limit increases in cases. Schools will also begin next month with some parents in open rebellion against imposing mask requirements, even with delta all but certain to continue circulating.

&gt;The emails, obtained through records requests by the institute’s Documenting COVID-19 project and shared with The Star, paint a portrait of local health officials eager to vaccinate their communities but encountering resistance from residents, apathy from some politicians and a milquetoast state-level response. They document rising frustration with everyone from DHSS to elected officials to the public. An official in one county even privately mocked a video released by DHSS explaining the delta variant.

&gt;”I feel like we’re on an island, all alone in the COVID fight, but I know others in the state are feeling the same way,” Laclede County Health Department Administrator Charla Baker wrote to a DHSS official in late June. “With our community leaders and residents not wanting to take any remedial actions to protect themselves and others, we are just very frustrated and concerned with our current situation.”

There are examples of gatherings (super spreader events) which were alarming even with less infectious variants. Chickenpox and Measles don't kill many people either but we don't consider it acceptable to let them run riot through communities.

I'm not advocating remaining in lockdown (despite what the government says, there's not much of a lockdown left these days anyway). But I think it prudent to push a public health message which advocates being conscious of moments when we are sharing air with other people such as on tube trains or buses, in shops etc and recommending wearing a mask in those circumstances. Obviously this is less feasible in night clubs but choosing when and where you are sharing air with other people with and without a mask is still wise all things considered.

Asymptomatic: People who are infected, but never develop symptoms

Presymptomatic: People who are infected, and are the the stage of the virus BEFORE they develop symptoms (as in, they have no symptoms at the time, but they will develop them at some point).

The challenge with COVID (unlike many other diseases) is that you are contagious in both asymptomatic and presymptomatic states. Which means, even if you have no idea you have it, you are still perfectly capably of spreading it. This makes it super dangerous, because even if your population is vigilant about staying home at the first sign of any possible symptoms, you can still spread it pretty far.

Argument from government:

* People taking the health protocols more lightly.

Arguments from experts:

* The highly contagious Delta variant, which did not exist last year. The Delta strain is believed to have entered Indonesia from people who arrived from overseas, Indonesian migrant workers who returned from abroad for Idul Fitri. 
* Short quarantine period for people from overseas (including India, Pakistan and the Philippines). New arrivals only underwent quarantine for five days, while the incubation period of COVID-19 is 14 days. The government said that the quarantine period for new arrivals in Indonesia would be extended to eight days starting Jul 6. 
* The government has reduced the number of contact tracers at the end of March, after the infection rate started to decline. The tracing ratio is 1:10, while the standard should be at least 1:30.

First, it's stated,

&gt; VaST concluded that there are relatively few reports of myocarditis to date and that these cases  seem to occur:

&gt;    predominantly in adolescents and young adults,

It then goes on to say later,

&gt;Within CDC safety monitoring systems, rates of myocarditis reports in the window following COVID-19 vaccination have not differed from expected baseline rates. However, VaST members felt that information about reports of myocarditis should be communicated to providers.

I genuinely appreciate the last bit where they said they felt that the information should be communicated, which is great.  But my confusion is saying that the few reports of myocarditis seem to be largely in adolescents and young adults, but then go on to say reports of myocarditis seems to be in line with what's expected otherwise.  Is it reasonable to assume children have myocarditis more often than adults in that case?  I feel like I'm missing some key conclusion from those two statements because they sound ridiculous when read in the same article with no real context on this particular point.

I guess in short, if children and young adults have more reports of myocarditis despite the instances not differing from the norm, does myocarditis appear more often or not?

This is toxic, incorrect and shortsighted. Dr. Michael Osterholm is one of those that is critical of “mask” studies and the efficacy of “masks” (quotes because often times studies don’t differentiate or poorly differentiate mask types) has often called for improved access to N95 and KN95 masks because the science does support their overwhelming efficacy. 

You see, when studies show limited efficacy or efficacy exaggerated by the media, the skeptical public will be less willing to accept mask mandates. Anecdotally, nearly all of my far right leaning friends will not dispute the efficacy of a KN95 or KN95 mask but will laugh at you when you suggest that neck gaiter is going to protect anyone.

Good post. You deserve a gold. 

I don't think that healthy young people should worry much after receiving the vaccine. The question is what may help to your or my mom/dad who are in an age that vaccine might be less effective and their health is deteriorating.

Is there something that might help and prevent them to get to hospitals? There is really a dearth of information in that area. I've seen things of course, but often is focused in new promising high tech (and profitable) treatments and little of things that you could do at home.  Does extra Zinc help? Aspirin?

I am not sure whether you have ever been in Switzerland, but the differences in living conditions between the poor and the rich are very small in Switzerland compared to other countries in Europe. Even more so when compared to the US or developing countries.

There are many reasons why there is hesitancy along racial lines.  Black people are more likely to be offered the “inferior” J&amp;J vaccine while white people overwhelmingly have greater access to the “superior” mRNA vaccines.  This disparity in brand distribution alone is causing black people to be hesitant of vaccination efforts.

Of course, one of the reasons for this disparity is not racism, but the fact that the J&amp;J is one shot and doesn’t require specific  temperature storage and transportation, so it’s more easily accessible to get to places to deliver single full shots to places like prisons, homeless shelters, low income communities, etc.  It’s not racism, but the racial disparity makes it look racist because some advocacy groups have touted the claim for years now that racial disparities in outcome is PROOF of racism and racially driven ill-intent.

We need to tell black people that it’s not true what those groups say.  Racial disparity in outcome is not proof of racist intent and malice.

This is false. mRNA was conceptualized and research was begun on it as far back as the 1950's (source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982215006065). Various uses of mRNA from 1961 to present can be found listed here: https://the-dna-universe.com/2021/04/15/the-history-of-mrna-applications/ ). This is not new technology. 

&gt; "" that we do not know the long term effects of""

This is a fundamental misunderstanding of how the vaccine works. It's a TEMPORARY mRNA sequence that gets inside your cells and instructs your cells to produce ""dead"" spike proteins. That's it. It's not changing anything inside your body. Thinking that there could be ""long term effects"" is like thinking that receiving an Email somehow ""permanently changes your Email Application"". It just doesn't. It can't. That's not how its designed. Once the mRNA is all used up (or whatever parts are unused inside a cell).. is broken down and passed as waste from your body. It can't just ""do something else"" randomly to your body. The only code it contains is code to manufacture spike-proteins. That's it. It's like Emailing your friend a recipe for Chocolate Chip Cookies and worrying that somehow it's gonna ""cause their Wi-Fi to get slower"" (or some completely other unrelated thing). It's just nonsense. 

&gt; ""for a virus that has a 99.98% survival rate for most healthy people.""

The problem with this statement is:... Even if we acknowledge the mortality percentage is low,.. the thing we CANNOT accurately predict is each persons individual outcome. Someone very well could be young (NOT in any high risk group).. but SARS-Cov2 could still end up killing them. We currently have no way to accurately predict that. It's literally like playing Russian roulette with your life. .01 means that if you had 1000 people in a room,.. a random 10 of them will die. Except we have no way to accurately predict WHICH 10.

This is the specific area targeted by our antibodies for neutralization. Changes in this region are not good for maintaining neutralizing immunity….

Two different viruses.  As I said, Rhino viruses have a far lower rate of replication fidelity and a far higher rate of mutation than coronaviruses.

In addition, Merck, the original patent holder of ivermectin, has released the [following statement](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/):

&gt; Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today affirmed its position regarding use of ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

&gt; * No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

&gt; * No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;

&gt; * A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.

&gt; We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.

From a developmental standpoint I can absolutely see that. It is true torture to keep children from their school and friends. In fact, this is why it was extremely painful to have our district’s teachers’ union push back against reopening when ALL state and federal public health officials, even their own “team of experts” said it was safe to do so. It wasn’t a surprise to parents that children could follow the guidelines. Besides school, life had to go on for the rest of us so we’ve been asking our kids to wear masks for more than a year. Parents advocated that children could follow all the rules and we were deemed “impatient” because “of course kids won’t follow the rules, especially the little ones. How dare you not be willing to wait an unknown amount of time so teachers can be vaccinated.” So who is selfish when ALL health officials agreed it wasn’t unnecessary to require vaccines for teachers due to repeated data that they were in low risk situations? Who is selfish when holding out for vaccines meant continuing to withhold school from millions of children and getting to skip ahead of all the essential workers that had been working without a tenth of the support and protections the entire pandemic.

Of course I can only speak for myself and about my district. I’m in California where the teachers unions are very powerful. I feel for all essential workers, especially those with preexisting conditions, that were scared and unsupported throughout this pandemic. That said, in my corner of the world, teachers had everyone’s support and parents patiently trusted the district to follow the science and naively believed they were considering the children’s needs.

French article about our Health minister telling people to get vaccinated.

&gt; « La charge hospitalière pour l’instant n’augmente pas, mais il va se passer la même chose que l’été dernier, c’est-à-dire que les jeunes vont contaminer les moins jeunes, et, parce que tout le monde n’est pas vacciné, vous allez avoir une augmentation de la pression sanitaire, une augmentation des cas graves et des hospitalisations », a développé M. Véran.

Approximate quick translation by myself
&gt; The ICU occupency is not increasing at the moment, but the same thing as last summer is going to happen, that is the young population will contaminate the youngers, and since not everyone is vaccinated, we will have an increase of ICU load, and an increase in critical cases and hopsitalizations.

Making a sacrifice (not that it really is much of one) and getting the vaccine is not much different from what Americans have done during times of crisis in the past.  During WW 1 and WW2 food, fuel, metal, paper, and many other items were severely rationed for the war effort, and people changed jobs to work in factories to aide the war effort.  Not to mention the thousands and thousands who died fighting in the wars.

They were proud to do so, since they were Americans who knew what really mattered in life.  

Learn from this idea, because really being a patriot is being an American first not being Democrat or Republican.

&gt;Intelligence test scores follow an **approximately normal distribution**, meaning that most people score near the middle of the distribution of scores and that scores drop off fairly rapidly in frequency as one moves in either direction from the centre.

[https://www.britannica.com/science/human-intelligence-psychology/The-IQ-test](https://www.britannica.com/science/human-intelligence-psychology/The-IQ-test)

And also with normal distributions, mean and median are equal. So... u/Hannibal_Spectre is technically wrong, when they stated ""It’s true that 50% are below the median, but not necessarily true that 50% are below the average.""

&gt;A normal distribution has some interesting properties: it has a bell shape, the **mean and median are equal**, and 68% of the data falls within 1 standard deviation.

Vaccina-tions and prior infection might achieve long term herd immunity, but we will need a very broad application of vaccines worldwide combined with comprehensive disease surveillance by accurate and readily avail-able diagnostic assays or devices76.

&gt;A second and more likely scenario is the transition to an epidemic seasonal disease like influenza. Effective therapies that prevent progres-sion of COVID-19 disease (e.g., monoclonal antibodies reduce hospi-talization and death by 70-85%) may bring the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection to levels that are equivalent or even lower than influenza. However, we should remember that the annual mortality burden of influenza, in non-pandemic years, is estimated to be 250,000 to 500,000, with up to 650,000 all-cause deaths globally, comprising ~2% of all annual respiratory deaths (two thirds among people 65 years and older)77. This is an extremely significant health burden and equates to a relatively ‘optimistic’ view of the future of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

&gt;A third scenario is the transition to an endemic disease similar to other human coronavirus infection that have a much lower disease impact than influenza or SARS-CoV-2. There is, however, limited data on the global burden of disease by common human coronaviruses78 and as noted in earlier sections, it is not possible to predict with confidence whether further adaptations of SARS-CoV-2 to humans will increase or decrease its intrinsic virulence.",,,,1626095122,{},h4wzjmq,False,t3_oiqiav,False,False,t3_oiqiav,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oiqiav/after_the_pandemic_perspectives_on_the_future/h4wzjmq/,1626257631,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Abstract  
Registered cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in the German human population increased rapidly during the second wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in winter 2020/21. Since domestic cats are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, the occurrence of trans-species transmission needs to be monitored. A previous serosurvey during the first wave of the pandemic detected antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in 0.65% of feline serum samples that were randomly sampled across Germany. In the here-presented follow-up study that was conducted from September 2020 to February 2021, the seroprevalence rose to 1.36% (16/1173). This doubling of the seroprevalence in cats is in line with the rise of reported cases in the human population and indicates a continuous occurrence of trans-species transmission from infected owners to their cats",,,,1626094266,{},h4wy2iy,True,t3_oiqlov,False,False,t3_oiqlov,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oiqlov/viruses_free_fulltext_the_second_wave_of_sarscov2/h4wy2iy/,1626256833,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The high attack rates in this care home outbreak, especially among partially vaccinated residents, is consistent with lower protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in residents and staff who had received only one dose of the Vaxzevria vaccine within 3 months. Reassuringly, though, hospitalisation was uncommon and there were no deaths, providing some evidence that a single dose of vaccine may be protective against severe disease following infection with the Delta variant. Vaccination with the second dose was coincidentally arranged at the care home on the same day the index case tested positive and it is possible that this helped control the outbreak more quickly. Our findings are supported by recent research that reported VE against hospitalisation of a single dose of Vaxzevria vaccine for the Delta variant as 71% (95% CI: 51–83) compared with 76% (95% CI: 61–85) for the Alpha variant with effectiveness increasing to 92% (95% CI: 75–97) for the Delta variant after two doses of the vaccine \[16\].",,,,1626094114,{},h4wxt8v,True,t3_oiqk2k,False,False,t3_oiqk2k,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oiqk2k/eurosurveillance_an_outbreak_caused_by_the/h4wxt8v/,1626256700,9,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

There is a realistic expectation that the global effort in vaccination will bring the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic under control. Nonetheless, uncertainties remain about the type of long-term association the virus will establish with the human population, particularly whether the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) will become an endemic disease. Although the trajectory is difficult to predict, the conditions, concepts, and variables that influence this transition can be anticipated. Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 as an endemic virus, perhaps with seasonal epidemic peaks, may be fueled by pockets of susceptible individuals and waning immunity after infection or vaccination, changes in the virus through antigenic drift that diminish protection, and reentries from zoonotic reservoirs. Here, we review relevant observations from previous epidemics and discuss the potential evolution of SARS-CoV-2 as it adapts during persistent transmission in the presence of a level of population immunity. Lack of effective surveillance or adequate response could enable the emergence of new epidemic or pandemic patterns from an endemic infection of SARS-CoV-2. There are key pieces of data that are urgently needed in order to make good decisions. We outline these and propose a way forward.",,,,1626093880,{},h4wxf09,True,t3_oiqiav,False,False,t3_oiqiav,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oiqiav/after_the_pandemic_perspectives_on_the_future/h4wxf09/,1626256497,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Health authorities believe that could have been enough for the virus to spread from a man in one of the hotel rooms to a man in the other via airborne transmission.

The man who was believed to be infected at the hotel then traveled to Melbourne, leading to an outbreak and a lockdown of Australia’s second-largest city, health authorities say.

Cases like those and the spread of highly infectious new coronavirus strains are prompting officials in some countries to rethink whether hotels are the best place to quarantine returning travelers, even as the U.S. and Europe weigh easing travel restrictions as vaccination levels rise.

Australia and China are planning new, specially designed quarantine centers that public-health experts say will be more effective at stopping the virus from leaking out. Others, such as New Zealand, are considering similar steps.

All three countries have used hotel quarantines, among other pandemic safety measures, to keep case numbers much lower than those elsewhere. But the new variants are so transmissible that health experts are now worried the virus could leak out easier and require harsher lockdowns to control, particularly in places such as Australia and New Zealand where the vaccine rollout has been

I fall within the 0-29 group that has 0.49% of deaths in the US. I also fall within the group that has a newly added warning for potential adverse reaction of endocarditis. After this is my last post:


I've been lurking for a while here but here's my personal opinion on this. It is EUA, the threshold for EUA approval is suuuuuper low. You essentially just have to prove that it may work while also not causing any major problems and as long as you met your study goal you win, hence remdesivir.

Absolute risk reduction for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are 0.7% and 1.1% respectively. Those are abysmally low risk reduction numbers.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33652582/

On top of that, based on information from the CDC over the past few months, 78% of hospitalizations for covid have been obese or larger patients, with 79% of deaths being 65+. The 0-49 group represents only 4.7% of deaths or 28,263 deaths out of 596,740.

65+ group represents 79% of deaths or 473,864 of 596,740.

75+ group represents 57% or 340,853 of 596,740.

https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm

This was all originally based on this insane virus we had no idea about, hospitals were being overwhelmed, there were no treatments or standards of care. The insane fear mongering that started early on, about anyone and everyone regardless of risk factors, being at risk of death is just not the case and this is what is making people suspicious or hesitant.

The fact that the government and everyone else isn't being truly honest is really hurting the cause. ""The science says"" and ""trust the science"" has become the universal chant and people know that the science no longer shows that anyone and everyone is at risk of death yet they continue to make this sound like a literal life and death situation for everyone.

""Your child could die if you don't get the vaccine.""

Deaths in the 0-17 range account for 0.05% of deaths. Shoot deaths in the 0-29 age range only account for 0.49% of deaths. You are statistically more likely to have your child die by an unintentional accident or your teenager dying while texting and driving than they are covid.

This is also starting to look like it's going to be an influenza style virus where even getting a vaccine doesn't prevent you from getting covid, spreading covid, or becoming sick with covid. This again goes back to established science with influenza that suggest getting the flu vaccine if you are old or fall into the at risk category but is not mandatory for everyone regardless because ""think of the greater good.""

Add in other misc things like the fact that covid is the only disease burden we are keeping track of cumulatively instead of yearly or seasonally, the fact that there literally just has not been enough time to evaluate the long term potential problems of the vaccine, and the fact that it has turned into a big brother ordeal and you've lost your audience.

One of the very first things I learned in my 10 year healthcare career is that you cannot bully people into making lifestyle or health changes and choices. You need to present the information in a non-biased and non-threatening way and allow them to make the choice and that is ABSOLUTELY not being done in the slightest.

Now back to your question, 

I am definitely not against vaccines, I am fully vaccinated and plan to vaccinate my children, but this is a whole different ordeal. The vaccine literally hasn't even been available for an entire year. There literally just has not been enough time for information on any potential long term effects to be gathered and organized. The venous sinus clots with J&amp;J and the endocarditis with Pfizer and Moderna are perfect examples of what I mean.

I worked covid ICU for a full year. Never had any symptoms, never had a positive test, even participated in a serology study and every serology test I had was negative. I'm not overweight and don't have any comorbidities. I'm not old. I dont fall into the high risk group.

When you factor in the whole evolving situation, like I said above this is starting to look like an influenza situation where we are going to have seasonal boosters and even then you can still catch, transmit, and become sick with covid.

I'm just personally not seeing the benefits of a vaccine with such abysmally low absolute risk reduction rates while also having no long term risk information being available.",,,,1626066631,{},h4w0wu9,False,t3_oi21of,False,False,t1_h4unnqv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oi21of/its_not_just_about_you_experts_say_getting_a/h4w0wu9/,1626239943,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Another friend went to an 18K maskless indoor UFC fight. Our hospitalizations are at February levels.

""As the highly transmissible Delta variant has taken hold across the United States, Nevada, and, in particular, Clark County, has quickly emerged as an epicenter of the latest surge of the virus. As of Friday, Nevada had the fourth highest case rate in the nation per capita over the last seven days; for many days last week, it was first.

The uptick in Clark County, in some ways, comes as no surprise. The county has a low vaccination rate, high population density and an economy built on bringing millions of domestic and international tourists together..""

The good news is, FEMA lands next week to help us out.

Thhhhaaat’s around 0.0009%-0.003% of those that could theoretically contract long covid.  Which makes it very very rare.

With the vaccines, the data is proving that (so far) the stats of that hasn’t changed significantly.

[],,ShiftLeader,,,[],,,,text,t2_gpzr1,False,False,[],"Posted this above to someone who asked basically exactly what you are asking, so here's an honest answer:

I've been lurking for a while here but here's my personal opinion on this. It is EUA, the threshold for EUA approval is suuuuuper low. You essentially just have to prove that it may work while also not causing any major problems and as long as you met your study goal you win, hence remdesivir.

Absolute risk reduction for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are 0.7% and 1.1% respectively. Those are abysmally low risk reduction numbers.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33652582/

On top of that, based on information from the CDC over the past few months, 78% of hospitalizations for covid have been obese or larger patients, with 79% of deaths being 65+. The 0-49 group represents only 4.7% of deaths or 28,263 deaths out of 596,740.

65+ group represents 79% of deaths or 473,864 of 596,740.

75+ group represents 57% or 340,853 of 596,740.

https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm

This was all originally based on this insane virus we had no idea about, hospitals were being overwhelmed, there were no treatments or standards of care. The insane fear mongering that started early on, about anyone and everyone regardless of risk factors, being at risk of death is just not the case and this is what is making people suspicious or hesitant.

The fact that the government and everyone else isn't being truly honest is really hurting the cause. ""The science says"" and ""trust the science"" has become the universal chant and people know that the science no longer shows that anyone and everyone is at risk of death yet they continue to make this sound like a literal life and death situation for everyone.

""Your child could die if you don't get the vaccine.""

Deaths in the 0-17 range account for 0.05% of deaths. Shoot deaths in the 0-29 age range only account for 0.49% of deaths. You are statistically more likely to have your child die by an unintentional accident or your teenager dying whole texting and driving than they are covid.

This is also starting to look like it's going to be an influenza style virus where even getting a vaccine doesn't prevent you from getting covid, spreading covid, or becoming sick with covid. This again goes back to established science with influenza that suggest getting the flu vaccine if you are old or fall into the at risk category.

Add in other misc things like the fact that covid is the only disease burden we are keeping track of cumulatively instead of yearly or seasonally, the fact that there literally just has not been enough time to evaluate the long term potential problems of the vaccine, and the fact that it has turned into a big brother ordeal and you've lost your audience.

One of the very first things I learned in my 10 year healthcare career is that you cannot bully people into making lifestyle or health changes and choices. You need to present the information in a non-biased and non-threatening way and allow them to make the choice and that is ABSOLUTELY not being done in the slightest.",,,,1626070769,{},h4w625c,False,t3_oi21of,False,False,t1_h4tvf5o,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oi21of/its_not_just_about_you_experts_say_getting_a/h4w625c/,1626242577,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

You may have been reading incorrect information. Current studies show that our vaccines are still highly effective against Delta.

Do you realize how little effect on a global scale the spread by unvaccinated people in one country has?  Everyone could get vaccinated in the US tomorrow and the already very small chances of a some variant popping up that makes vaccines obsolete would be almost unchanged.

&gt;This shit isn't going away because we suck. We could definitely manage it, but people are selfish assholes who don't want to be even slightly inconvenienced.

If i want to travel to another country, and they require some kind of proof of vax, that makes total sense. As they already do this and thats what the country requires.

But no. I disagree with the thought that our government should be asking questions when we want to move from place to place within my country. Thats where the China example comes in. Most cant move without some kind of question from government (in China)

The variants reduce the efficacy of the antibodies that are circulating in your system. Over time, the ""active"" antibodies that can immediately bind to cells wanes if your body hasn't ""seen"" the offending protein lately. 

These numbers are made up, but assume that there 'needs' to be 100 effective antibodies per unit of volume to neutralize an infection before it begins. If you started with 1000 antibodies shortly after your second dose that means you're highly protected. Over time, that has slow exponential decay down to 200 antibodies per unit of volume 6 months after you got vaccinated. Against the original virus? Plenty to protect you. But if Delta or another variant then reduces the number of those antibodies that are effective by 50-70%, then now you only have 60-100 ""effective"" antibodies and are potentially vulnerable to get infected. 

The reason why the vaccines still help with severe disease is because once your body sees the infection, there are other immune cells that say ""oh, hai, I remember you!"" and help attack the infected cells and pump out massive quantities of antibodies relatively early on in the infection as opposed to your body having to ""experiment"" with different antibodies to neutralize a truly novel virus (this is all an oversimplification of course but is directionally correct).

I'm saying that the only scientific evidence she gave in support of vaccinated people wearing masks is wrong, wrong in a way that has a significant bearing on its use in support of that point, and in a way that I'm fairly certain she herself would admit if it were brought to her attention. Given any scenario in which vaccinated people represent a non-miniscule percentage of the population, the reduction in cross-infection due to the non-linear nature of R-values means that vaccinated peopled are ""risk-equivalent"" to unvaccinated people at a much higher ratio than the individual protection percentage would suggest.

Earlier in the chain, she talked about a hypothetical 5% reduction in R-value (from 2 to 1.9) from wearing masks would translate into a 60% reduction in cases after 20 ""generations"". But using the same ""risk equivalent"" rules she used for vaccinated people would be to say that 20 people wearing masks would be equivalent to 19 people not wearing masks. I think it's pretty clear that that's not true at all, and for the same reason it's not true about vaccinations, either.

An argument that vaccinated people should wear masks for social reasons, to promote hygiene responsibility in a volatile time, is fine.

The reason we haven’t had vax passports before because we’ve never faced these conditions. I don’t mean we’ve never had a pandemic. We’ve never had one in a world as mobile as the one we live in now. That means transmission is a much bigger and widespread problem. 
This isn’t about the health of the person being vaccinated. If it was only their health I’d have no problem with it. But like second hand smoke, it does not just effect them. It only takes one person to start a new wave. Ensuring that not only do we prevent unnecessary deaths, but also many times more long term effects is perfectly reasonable. One of my friends had her heart damaged by covid. Now she can’t really work or do anything strenuous. 
As to the actions of the government, it’s us. It’s we the people. To quote Spock, “the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.” Despite being a fictional character it is something most people live by. 
If a person doesn’t want to wear a mask or get vaccinated that’s fine. If they want to interact physically with others or visit places that other people go, that’s a problem. Most Americans who have a maximalist view of personal rights usually haven’t had much interaction with our legal system. Both civil and criminal. Many people are shocked to find out the things they were sure they were guaranteed simply aren’t. Or if they are have a much tighter scope than what they imagined. 
There is even a specific framework in law to answer the question of how big of an interest does the government need to override personal rights of specific groups.

First, there were prio groups, but as soon as the ""important"" people got vaccinated, they dropped it.
So then, most normal people couldn't get vaccinated with Biontech/Moderne whole June, because the states would save these for people working for the government/state/city.

Now, they wonder why people are upset and the speed is slowing down. Again, I know several people who wanted to, but now changed their mind.

My second shot is going to be tomorrow, not because my GP called me, but because I tried hard to get it.

World Health Officials have signaled the “Lambda” variant as the latest version of the virus, and though it hasn’t been categorized it as a “variant of concern” yet, that could change as experts learn more.

“Tentatively speaking, it appears the Lambda variant is covered quite nicely by our current vaccines,” encourages OhioHealth’s Dr. Joseph Gastaldo.
 
COVID-19’s super-spreader, Delta variant still remains the dominant strain in the United States, but the newest version of the virus is popping up increasingly around the globe.

“With so much infection happening worldwide, it should surprise nobody that we are going to continue to have further evolution of this virus into variants,” Dr. Gastaldo warns.

According to the World Health Organization, 81% of the COVID-19 cases reported in Peru since April were associated with the Lambda variant.

The newest version of the virus taking over fellow South American countries like Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Ecuador as well.

“We really don’t know yet too much about how the Lambda variant behaves. The Lambda variant is thought to be more transmissible,” says Dr. Gastaldo.

It’s also thought to be more effective at fighting off current therapies used to treat symptomatic COVID-19 patients.

But with more people looking to get away as travel restrictions ease, South America remains on the do not travel advisory. Meaning more trips to places like Mexico, and the Caribbean.

“[ I ] received one request to go to Peru. Once we discussed the situations, they felt it was best to lay back and hold off on that trip,” admits Brian McGee, a Travel Agent with Uniglobe Travel Designers. “The regulations change constantly. You know, the recommendations change. It’s a 24-hour job right now, it really is.”

Health experts say with more COVID-19 variants forming, genetic sequencing — the process used to identify a particular strain — efforts are increasing.

“The lambda variant is not the last variant,” Dr. Gastaldo reaffirms.

With those experts warning the vaccine, for now, is still our best defense.

“That’s the canary in the coal mine for vaccines not working anymore. If all the sudden we get a bunch of breakthrough infections ending up in the hospital,” warns Dr. Gastaldo.

Dr. Gastaldo adds that while we know the vaccines are highly effective in preventing hospitalizations or deaths in those breakthrough cases, what we don’t know is the level of protection from asymptomatic infection from those fully vaccinated.

[],,EvanWithTheFactCheck,,,[],,,,text,t2_1420qr,False,False,[],"I never said conservatives shouldn’t change their messaging.  They should. But that doesn’t mean liberals shouldn’t change their own messaging too.

Like, let’s say, in a purely hypothetical scenario, conservatives changed their messaging and saw higher rates of vaccination in conservative demographics.  This would leave ONLY black people to die of covid at far higher rates (and they are already more likely to die of covid than white people by 3-4x) because you refuse to acknowledge liberals also need to fueling vaccine hesitancy with their own messaging.  Are you more in favor of saving conservative lives than black lives?  Don’t Black Lives Matter to YOU?

I live on the borderline of an Asian enclave and black enclave so I get to interact with members of both neighbors a lot.  I’m Asian and nearly everyone in the Asian neighborhood who is eligible to be vaccinated are vaccinated.  The black enclave next to me have a far lower rate of unvaccinated.  When I ask them why, they say they don’t trust the government to suddenly care about black lives when it didn’t care before.  They say there hasn’t been studies to show if the vaccines have the same effects on people of different races, in terms of efficacy as well as risks of side effects.  They say if the risks of vaccine side effects was greater to black people than white people, the government would not release that data if they wanted black people to endure greater risks of vaccination to save more white people, so they will hold off until race-based studies are released.  They say the Tuskegee experiments showed how willing the American government and scientific community was to intentionally subject black people to harm “for the greater good” of science without informing black people of the harm imposed on them (in the Tuskegee experiments, scientists and researchers purposely withheld life saving treatment syphilis from an exclusively black experimental cohort to study how untreated syphilis affected the human body, knowledge they gained “for the greater good of science” at black people’s expense, and the subjects were never told this was happening, but rather they were told they were receiving treatment for syphilis).  They cite the fact that the vaccine trials were done on cohorts where black subjects were underrepresented, and racial data was simply not collected in most cases, which is a plain fact of truth.  The black people in my community who refuse vaccination are working class people who had been working in factories, warehouses, kitchens, construction, public transportation, and other public facing jobs throughout the entire pandemic that already saw outbreaks and they either already caught covid and recovered, or they believe since they never got sick they are immune, and thus see no reason to vaccinate now and incur an additional risk of vaccine side effects to protect against  a virus they feel they are already immune from, especially given all the points of uncertainty I listed above.  They notice black people are more often offered the J&amp;J vaccine while white people are offered the mRNA vaccines, and feel suspicious that black people are being treated differently than white people.  

It’s easy to believe the vaccine hesitant are just stupid selfish conservative mouthbreathers, but there are smart, analytical, risk-conscious black people who are hesitant and naturally distrustful because they have been told over and over again that black lives do not matter because we live in a racist society that does not care whether black people live or die.

Yes, conservative messaging needs to change — but that would mostly result in saving more white lives.  If we wish to save black lives, then liberals need to change their own messaging too.  Unless you don’t care about black lives.

And here’s the thing. Even if you believe conservative messaging poses a greater proportional risk to society as a whole, the fact still remains that black people are for more like to refuse vaccination, and that disparity in and of itself has a greater injurious impact on black people, even though it doesn’t affect white people or the greater society as much.  We should care about a disproportionate number of black people dying preventable deaths from covid enough to try to understand WHY there is so much hesitation in black communities, because merely fighting conservative messaging, which they are unlikely to subscribe to in the first place, and ignoring the concerns of black people won’t move the needle for them.  Unless you think these black people are likely to be conservatives who can be saved by a positive shift in conservative messaging, we need to try to at least understand the unique reasons for black hesitation to know how to specifically address them.  Beyond saving black lives, many states are now requiring vaccination to attend institutions of higher learning or to access employment opportunities, which would effectively shut out black people at a higher rate if their rates of hesitation remain the same and unaddressed.

It’s insane to me that I have to explain in such depth why it’s important to address race based vaccine hesitation to people who claim they care about black lives and care about giving greater access of education and employment to black people.  It’s insane to me that people think conservative hesitancy is worth addressing, but black hesitancy should be ignored and dismissed.",,,,1626049542,{},h4v862b,False,t3_oi5t52,False,True,t1_h4v1s9m,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oi5t52/fauci_criticizes_partisan_gap_for_holding_back/h4v862b/,1626224609,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

It was very scary being forced into a situation where I was seeing 100s of kids everyday in a small poorly ventilated classroom. Now that most teachers have been vaccinated things are different. I think kids were compliant because in many situations they felt like if they weren’t they’d end up back doing virtual school. I saw a definite decrease in ALL problematic behaviors this year. It’s the first year in my teaching career where I had zero referrals or behavior issues for the entire school year. After being virtual the kids were grateful to be at school which I think impacted how they responded to wearing masks. Things did go way better than anticipated and teachers now have the opportunity to be vaccinated. So yes, I would categorize the parents who were pushing for schools to reopen when there were so many unknowns and the virus was surging as impatient and selfish in many cases.

&gt;Yes, you should be vaccinated regardless of whether you already had COVID-19. That’s because experts do not yet know how long you are protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19. Even if you have already recovered from COVID-19, it is possible—although rare—that you could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 again.

This is barely even an argument, certainly not a persuasive one.  Experts don't know how long vaccinated immunity lasts either.  There are several indications that both vaccinated and natural immunity are long-lasting.  The Cleveland study is an example.  

&gt;COVID-19 did not occur in anyone over the five months of the study among 2579 individuals previously infected with COVID-19, including 1359 who did not take the vaccine.

If you're willing to blind yourself to this and other observations because ""peer review,"" but you support contrary conclusions and guidance from the CDC based on nothing more than an assertion that ""we don't know,"" you may as well be shouting campaign slogans. 

The CDC goes on to say:

&gt;Studies have shown that vaccination provides a strong boost in protection in people who have recovered from COVID-19. Learn more about [why getting vaccinated is a safer way to build protection than getting infected.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/vaccine-benefits.html)

You don't need a ""boost in protection"" when the reinfection rate is near 0%.  Nor is this boosted or ""super immunity"" concept supported by anything.  Antibodies are but one component of immunity, which is a complex phenomenon that we don't fully understand.  The hyperlink goes to a page that explains why being vaccinated is safer than acquiring natural immunity, to someone who is not immune.  This is irrelevant to someone who already recovered from COVID.

Nobody can point to anything beyond purely speculative theories with little-to-no precedent that suggests people who have recovered from COVID benefit from vaccination.  

At no point during my 2 weeks of having COVID did I ever experience symptoms as bad as many of the vaccine side affects people describe.  I'm not anti-vaxxer.  I'm not republican.  I'm not uninformed or unconcerned with the health of those around me, all of whom are vaccinated.

The 16% figure is wildly out of date, it's currently 55% for 18-24 year olds in England and higher in Scotland and Wales. 


&gt;I’m in Canada where around 60% of our 12 to 17

Our stupid vaccine regulator in the UK still won't let 12-17 year olds get vaccinated. 


&gt;18 to 24 as high as 90% in some areas .

I am 21y old healthy? female (I am a student so I drink occasionally and smoke cigs sometimes too but I am a good weight and rarely get sick ever actually)  
So on Tuesday night I saw a friend who was positive and didn't tell me (nice right?) and Wednesday morning at 8 am I got my first dose of Pfizer. yesterday (Sunday), I tested positive but I see now my symptoms started Friday night.  It started with a sore throat, followed by a little cough and a stuffy nose. Now the couch and sore throat are mostly gone but for 3 days now (Monday) I have a wicked migraine behind my eyes. it feels like someone is also squeezing my head. I am really nervous since I have HA which produces psychosomatic symptoms anyways here are some of my questions.  
1. is it normal that I still have a migraine, like a really really really bad headache?  
2. is it normal that when I stand up I feel heavy-headed and dizzy and just want to lay back down? is dizziness normal?  
3. my main concern is that I googled like crazy and saw something called long-covid? this really freaks me out. what is the chance that I will have this? does this mean ill have covid symptoms forever?  being dizzy is a fear of mine.. does this mean ill be dizzy forever?

Sure, a spokesperson said it, but they're allowed to say anything- I'd rather have it written into the law.
Which begs the question, why isn't it?

If you want to argue that they made the law just to get the ball rolling with a placeholder, that's fine- they did that by saying ""they'll make a survey later"" in the text. 

But they could've easily said ""Participation in this survey will not be mandatory nor will universities be required to fulfill a survey quota; The specifics will be further discussed and deliberated"".

If we go by what policians and spokespeople said, we'd have seen Trump's taxes, his healthcare plan, Mexico paying for a border wall, Obama's ""if you like your current physician/plan you can keep 'em"", etc.

Until these words are reflected in legislation, I don't see how you can jump to conclusions. 

Even if they DO add the ""optional"" verbage later on, it doesn't mean that it's crazy to approach with apprehension at this point. 

I do agree that people are framing it like ""Ok you're gonna have to line up and name your politicial affiliation at gunpoint"", which is media sensationalism. But you're free to look at the law:

No one is saying it's ""only one side.""  But it is absolutely a majority of one side.  If you are unvaccinated then statistically you are far more likely to be a republican rather than democrat.  The 80/20 rule is very much in effect.

When such a strong majority is present it's common in the English language to just refer to it as a problem of the whole.  If a strong majority of unvaccinated Americans are republicans then it is acceptable to say it's a systemic problem within the republican party.

Only one party celebrates being unvaccinated while the other party is strongly encouraging the vaccinations.  I bet you can guess which is which.

Unfortunately, the Phillies are one of just a handful of teams who have not been able to reach the 85% threshold. It’s unclear how many of these guys are just close contacts, but I would bet not all of them tested positive, particularly since it’s just Bohm being reported. Hopefully having to miss time like this unnecessarily will be a wake up call to the Phillies and whichever other teams have not yet reached 85%, although based on some boneheaded, disheartening comments I’ve read from various players on the team, I’m not exactly optimistic that they will.

You're not accounting for the known high R0 dispersion of SARS-CoV-2.  A ""superspreader"" event with very fleeting transmission is not indicative of all cases, and is expected given what we know about coronaviruses and their R0 dispersion.

As a another real-life example, a SARS1 superspreader in Hong Kong infected *hundreds* (yes, hundreds) of people in a high-rise apartment complex, including people in adjacent buildings via aerosols.  This doesn't mean that SARS 1 had a high R0, though.

This was all originally based on this insane virus we had no idea about, hospitals were being overwhelmed, there were no treatments or standards of care. The insane fear mongering that started early on, about anyone and everyone regardless of risk factors, being at risk of death is just not the case and this is what is making people suspicious or hesitant.

The fact that the government and everyone else isn't being truly honest is really hurting the cause. ""The science says"" and ""trust the science"" has become the universal chant and people know that the science no longer shows that anyone and everyone is at risk of death yet they continue to make this sound like a literal life and death situation for everyone.

""Your child could die if you don't get the vaccine.""

Deaths in the 0-17 range account for 0.05% of deaths. Shoot deaths in the 0-29 age range only account for 0.49% of deaths. You are statistically more likely to have your child die by an unintentional accident or your teenager dying whole texting and driving than they are covid.

This is also starting to look like it's going to be an influenza style virus where even getting a vaccine doesn't prevent you from getting covid, spreading covid, or becoming sick with covid. This again goes back to established science with influenza that suggest getting the flu vaccine if you are old or fall into the at risk category.

Add in other misc things like the fact that covid is the only disease burden we are keeping track of cumulatively instead of yearly or seasonally, the fact that there literally just has not been enough time to evaluate the long term potential problems of the vaccine, and the fact that it has turned into a big brother ordeal and you've lost your audience.

One of the very first things I learned in my 10 year healthcare career is that you cannot bully people into making lifestyle or health changes and choices. You need to present the information in a non-biased and non-threatening way and allow them to make the choice and that is ABSOLUTELY not being done in the slightest.",,,,1626060718,{},h4vs75s,False,t3_oi21of,False,False,t1_h4uv5yi,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oi21of/its_not_just_about_you_experts_say_getting_a/h4vs75s/,1626235349,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Viruses (and everything else) mutate to stay alive. They don't care how mild or severe the illness is that they cause. Even if it kills a lot of people, as long as it can spread and infect enough people before it kills the host, it doesn't matter.

I was concerned that mask-wearing would encourage the evolution of a strain that can be transmitted more easily, despite wearing masks. Wearing masks only reduced transmission, which allows for the ""tittest"" viral mutations to become more airborne. It's similar to antibiotics and if you don't finish your treatment and kill them all, the ones remaining are more likely todevelop antibiotic-resistantance. I am pro-mask, but the tool that (unfortunately) makes to most sense to stop the virus is reducing actual human-to-human contact. 

The reason viruses actually appear to become ""milder"" is because once it's gone through the population once, pretty much everyone has been exposed and has either died or has some level of immunity. When the virus mutates, you may get re-infected, but in most cases it will be milder. Then when it comes around the third time, milder still. It's our **immune system** that makes viruses appear to get milder over time, not the evolution of the virus.

You could even say that Fosun isn't clever with this right purchase, because the mRNA vaccine still isn't granted pass in China, creating difficulty for them to get back their investment. Therefore the Taiwan market isn't negligible to Fosun.

If the Taiwan government tried to buy from Fosun and they refuse, I think you can blame China for politicizing the issue.

In bringing up R values I think you are fallaciously assuming that the 20 vaccinated people exhaust the population. If we think along those lines, then the virus will also be *completely eliminated* in the population of 1 - they will catch it and then it goes away.

This tells us the reproduction number is quite steady at around 1. We have 56% of the total population vaccinated with the first dose, and 29% fully vaccinated. 

When we are done fully vaccinating the adult population we will end up at around 75% of the total population vaccinated. This means 20 percentage points increase from today. I've seen estimates of first dose efficacy from 4 to 40%. Since virtually all the infections are happening in the unvaccinated groups a 4 percentage point reduction will be enough to bring R under 1, and the virus will die out. This is with the lowest possible estimate for efficacy. And even if you do get infected while vaccinated, you are less likely to spread it to others.

In about 5 weeks we will be done with the first dose and a few weeks after we will see the effects. I am curious how we will fare compared to Israel. One big advantage here is that there is few people denying the vaccine, and they aren't religious communities, so we aren't directly comparable. We are also likely to have a much higher rate of vaccinations.

&gt;Exactly! A year ago people kept saying that viruses tend to ""mutate so that they're milder"" which I've been saying is wrong! Viruses (and everything else) mutate to stay alive.

Indeed, there's not necessarily selective pressure for any given virus to be less harmful.

It may further illustrate your overall point about selective pressure to think about mutations as something that happen *to viruses*—mutations are merely random errors in replication.

Time and time again througout the pandemic enough of the general public have shown scant regard for social distancing principles, mask wearing and isolating when ill to drive infections.  I find it depressing to hear people declare their own personal rights more important than basic civic responsibility and the welfare of everyone (including them, their families and loved ones). Nobody's saying it's been anything other than a shit 16 months but dropping all restrictions while paying lipservice to ""personal responsibility"" is not going to work.

“PCR amplification is an s-shaped curve. There's a lead-up phase where the fluorescence of the assay is below the limit of detection for the instrument, and you get a flat line. There's an exponential section where you're amplifying your target....exponentially and a final section where it hits a ceiling due to consumption of all the reagent/degradation of enzyme. If you run any PCR enough cycles, you'll hit that final section. We didn't have any way of seeing these curves in 1992, when Mullis was making those comments. All we had was guesswork. Sometimes you'd stop your PCR after cycle 20 and hope that you stopped it in the middle of the exponential cycle and you could run a gel to see different band intensities. If you ran 45 cycles of a PCR and ran a gel you'd always see a dark band. But it's all guesswork. Real-time PCR changed things by allowing us to see exactly how the target (if any) was amplified. You notice how in the image I linked, all the curves hit the maximum? That's the point. You run a qPCR until the curves are all saturated. Then you measure the Ct difference between samples (called the ddCt method). qPCR doubles per cycle, so for e.g. a ddCT of 2 means there's a 4-fold difference in abundance of nucleotide. The test works like this in that it's not measuring if there's amplification using covid primers, it's measuring when there's amplification. Based on a comparison of when the amplification occurs, they can make a scientific assessment of whether there's viral RNA in the sample or not. “",,,,1626109949,{},h4xvtr5,False,t3_oiqg9x,False,True,t1_h4xugyv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oiqg9x/onethird_of_young_travellers_who_tested_negative/h4xvtr5/,1626275658,-4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Secondly, you can't get your second jab until at least 8 weeks after you got your first.

GBS is a rare disease. It happens very rarely in the general population of healthy people, it also happens very rarely to people who catch the flu, Covid and probably other diseases too. So you don't eliminate or even necessarily reduce your lifetime chance of getting GBS by not getting the J&amp;J vaccine.

And if you believe the chance of GBS is 1 in 128,000 then you must also understand the chance of catching Covid out in your neighborhood when unvaccinated is significantly higher than that.

That's not true. I can only speak for Ontario but we have 80% with 1 dose and 50% fully vaccinated and we are still the most restricted region in North America.

We are moving to stage 3 this Friday which was only announced last Friday. We were suppose to wait until July 21 for stage 3. Even stage 3 still requires social distancing, indoor capacity capped at 50%, masks etc.

We currently have no indoor dining allowed, no gyms, no movies, no theaters, no organized sports we have nothing even though we've obliterated vaccine targets and have our lowest case counts, hospitalizations, and percent positive in 10 months.

The majority of people did not want a NINE WEEK PLAN just to get to stage 3. We STILL don't have a plan for a full reopening. We wanted restrictions removed quicker based on all of the above. Very few people wanted a full-on let 'er rip reopening.

'According to an estimate from the Office for National Statistics in May, 1.1 million people in the UK were reporting long Covid symptoms in the four weeks to 6 March 2021. These were defined as symptoms that had lasted more than four weeks from initial infection, though for more than two thirds of these people the symptoms had lasted more than 12 weeks. A fifth said their symptoms limited their daily activities a lot.

Other studies suggest the numbers could be considerably higher. A study published in June by Imperial College, London, of half a million adults in England who reported having Covid illness found that over a third still had at least one symptom 12 weeks later. When these findings are applied to all the people in England who have been ill with Covid, this could mean more than two million people may have experienced long Covid.'",,,,1626105799,{},h4xkzxv,False,t3_oingfz,False,True,t1_h4x875r,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oingfz/lack_of_covid_awareness_at_euro_final_devastating/h4xkzxv/,1626269485,-1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The US is a big place with many local differences, and while they may have had that where you are for 3 months now, over here in MD, we've only gone masks optional for 2 months for the state (May 15), my county for slightly less than that (May 28) - and still required for public transportation, schools, health care and childcare.  

It's actually a funny difference.  Folks around my area are still masking in stores, but when I went over one county, very few were.

I wouldn't exactly call a 95% effective vaccine ""limited"". It's more than we have for almost any other infectious disease.

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Honestly, I accept and agree with the argument that ultimately we are going to have to live with the virus. But the Delta variant is really, really infectious and the numbers in the UK are quite alarming. Daily deaths have gone from 5-8 to around 25-30 in the space of about a month. All of that said, I'm still accepting of the facts but it is a gamble to let infection rates soar like they are doing. Double jabbed people can still be infected and ill (my sister is currently positive and unwell but OK).

Yes, the Delta variant is really infectious. And there's probably going to be an even more infectious variant in a while, and one after than, etc etc. Once everyone has had the choice to be vaccinated, there is little more we can do if we don't want to continue to yo-yo in and out of lockdown indefinitely. For context, there is somewhere between 300-1200 people dying in the UK each week from pneumonia and the flu (depending on the season and on how you attribute cause of death).

 [Scientific skepticism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeptical_movement#Scientific_skepticism) 
 
 &gt;Scientific skepticism or rational skepticism (also spelled scepticism), sometimes referred to as skeptical inquiry, is an epistemological position in which one questions the veracity of claims lacking empirical evidence. In practice, the term most commonly references the examination of claims and theories that appear to be beyond mainstream science, rather than the routine discussions and challenges among scientists.

Yeah I live here 

&gt;but the differences in living conditions between the poor and the rich are very small in Switzerland compared to other countries in Europe. Even more so when compared to the US or developing countries.

You‘re ignoring all other factors. Low wage workers are low wage workers for a variety of reasons. Take as an example low education resulting in low wage work, the person will nake worse choices for their own health due to lacking education. Or cultural differences, e.g. certain migration backgrounds (which is also linked to low wages) much more likely to dismiss mental health issues resulting in worse health outcomes. 

&gt;As for law suits against employers, these are actually rather quick due to their special nature and being handled by a special court. Besides, even if you lose your job, unemployment and social welfare exists and props people up very well.

Did you ever have to deal with the situation? The social security net is nice and all, until it isn‘t (e.g. see nurses who were denied coverage because „they couldn‘t prove they were infected with covid at work""). It‘s pretty mentally exhausting, and now imagine you barely speak the language or work a very demanding job + have kids or are single with kids and have to deal with this bs on top. Not easy. 

&gt;I would rather attribute the difference in Covid outcomes to differences in culture and education. My rich friends are much more likely to see a doctor for even minor things where my ""poorer"" friend are more likely just taking a few days off and then going back to work.

&gt;Deaths caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in New York City (NYC) during the spring of 2020 have vastly exceeded those reported in China and many other countries. What were the early events that led to such a severe outbreak? Gonzalez-Reiche et al. sampled some of the early patients seeking assistance in February and March of 2020 at the Mount Sinai Health System. Phylogenetic analysis of virus sequences in these people, who were drawn from across NYC, showed that the virus had been independently introduced many times from Europe and elsewhere in the United States. Subsequent clusters of community transmission occurred. The focus of infection in NYC is a marker of the role this city plays as a two-way hub for human movement.

&gt;July 16[2020] (UPI) -- Up to 75% of the coronavirus strains circulating in New York City in early March shared genetic similarities with those seen in Europe and other areas of North America, according to an analysis published Thursday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

*Officials are monitoring the lambda variant because it carries a number of mutations that could potentially aid its spread. The variant has seven mutations in the virus’s “spike protein” compared with the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 detected in Wuhan, China.

Some of these mutations have the potential to increase transmissibility of the virus or to **reduce the ability of certain antibodies to neutralize, or inactivate, the virus, according to the WHO**. For example, lambda has a mutation known as F490S located in the spike protein’s receptor-binding domain (RBD), where the virus first docks onto human cells. A paper published in the July issue of the journal Genomics identified F490S as a likely “**vaccine escape mutation**” that could both **make the virus more infectious and disrupt the ability of vaccine-generated antibodies to recognize the variant.***

I think your point about how suppression is now vaccination will be more arguable once that 51% does get into the 70 or 80 percentile range. 

As for being unable to financially or mentally continue with lock down: Firstly, the virus doesn't care about financial markets or the state of your mental health....It takes root in vulnerable communities wherever it encounters them and kills people. Breakthrough infections are still more likely and dangerous for elderly or immuno-compromised people and the more virus there is in the community, the more dangerous it is for them. 

Secondly, I'm not advocating for continued lockdown anyway....I'm advocating for stronger messaging around the wearing of masks in public spaces as a default behaviour, with places like night clubs being the exception instead of the rule. Any measures to reduce transmission of the virus are of value and it makes public spaces where more vulnerable people are breathing the same air safer, whilst allowing those who want to risk exposure in a night club to do so. As things stand now I guarantee you at least half the population will not be wearing masks indoors on the 19th July in the UK because ""they don't have to anymore"".

Finally....Who knows where we will be in the winter. If a new and more dangerous variant is going to emerge, it won't announce itself immediately at birth so it can be contained....It will quietly spread through the community wherever it can and be considered ""Normal Covid"" until it starts killing people.
