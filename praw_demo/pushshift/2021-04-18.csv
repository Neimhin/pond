The 5/7 part doesn't really do anything; just looking at week-over-week growth gives you the same exponential rate on a weekly basis instead of a 5-day basis.  But if you want to figure out how many more vaccinations we need to get to a certain level it's the actual R value we'd want to know.  5.0 day serial interval remains the best estimate I've seen.

Israel's R has been slowly rising.

I hear it over and over. I was one of the few people sticking to masking and occupancy rules (until I and my family were vaccinated) but at this point I literally only know of one couple even remotely conscious of any rules. The refusal to create exit metrics has also dramatically increased vaccine apathy, since people don’t really see how getting vaccinated will change anything for the better. The problem is that OHA has created messaging and rules by and for only the absolute most risk-averse people in society, leading otherwise influenceable people in the “middle” to roll their eyes and stop paying attention altogether.

When I say it’s not complicated, I mean it’s not that complicated to understand that we’re still averaging like 70k new cases/day and it’s only tomorrow, April 19, that all adults nationwide become eligible to receive the vaccine. That means we’re not quite out of the woods yet, despite things definitely heading in the right direction. The risk of transmission from a vaccinated person to an unvaccinated person is low, but not zero, and it will still be a few more weeks before everyone has had a chance to get both doses of the vaccine, and cases are still plateaued at a fairly high number.

And I think most adults understand why the CDC would be hesitant to give a hard metric on such a novel and dynamic situation. When was the last time we vaccinated hundreds of millions of Americans for a novel coronavirus that killed over a half million people in our country? Never. There is ambiguity in this situation and most people understand that.

That said, my main point is that I’m not convinced that the messaging from the CDC is actually what’s driving reluctance to take the vaccine. Vaccine reluctance is seriously concentrated in certain demographics—mainly conservatives, and conservative men in particular. I don’t think this is because conservatives are literally incapable of understanding the nuances of what I described above.

&gt;  
&gt;**EMILY BRINDLEY** APRIL 19, 2021  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The state plans to move forward in two stages, Lamont announced, both contingent on declining coronavirus metrics and rising vaccination rates.  
&gt;  
&gt;First, on May 1, the state will lift all outdoor restrictions, including allowing bars to operate outdoors without serving food. Then, on May 19, the state will do away with the remaining restrictions. That means bars will be able to open indoors, event venue and stadium capacity limits will be removed and social distancing requirements will be dropped. In addition, gathering restrictions for private events will be eliminated.  
&gt;  
&gt;The one exception is the indoor mask mandate, which will remain in effect. The state also said that the Department of Public Health will be issuing recommendations for indoor gatherings and large outdoor gatherings.  
&gt;  
&gt;Throughout the pandemic, Lamont has opted to keep bars and night clubs closed, due to concerns that their close quarters could trigger significant COVID-19 spread.The state also still has gathering restrictions in place currently — at private residences, gatherings are capped at 25 people indoors or 100 people outdoors; at commercial venues, gatherings are capped at 100 people indoors or 200 people outdoors.  
&gt;  
&gt;The announcement comes as the state pushes forward with its vaccination effort — about half of Connecticut residents have now received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, according to The New York Times, placing Connecticut among the top three fastest states for per capita vaccinations.  
&gt;  
&gt;Even so, the state’s cases, hospitalizations and deaths are not as low as they were over the quiet summer months, when the virus seemed to temporarily loosen its hold on Connecticut.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dr. Ulysses Wu, the system director of infectious diseases at Hartford HealthCare, said that he understands the impulse to reopen now — and that there are ways to reopen safely.  
&gt;  
&gt;The key to a safe reopening, Wu said, is for residents to continue masking, social distancing and hand washing, even after vaccination.""",,,1618867717,{},gv4p5aj,True,t3_muay0j,False,False,t3_muay0j,/r/Coronavirus/comments/muay0j/connecticut_to_lift_all_covid19_business/gv4p5aj/,1618876917,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

That means that unfortunately, everyone who wants the pandemic to end has to work to get people vaccinated by having those uncomfortable discussions.

I have personally had to repeatedly have the discussion about how it doesn't cause cancer. People hear mRNA and think that means the vaccine is altering their DNA or something like that. It drives me crazy. I'm pretty paranoid about cancer, but in short, to cause cancer something must be mutagenic (cause DNA damage or alter DNA). The vaccine and its ingredients do not.

So now, I'm stuck in this position where when someone says ""I'm not getting it because..."" what the people who want the pandemic to end must do is ask ""Why."" 

It's unfortunate, but we aren't going to reach herd immunity at the current rate, and the spread of misinformation as well as the mutation of current variants means that there is a real risk that the vaccines are rendered useless anyway.

Or maybe we just run things as is and make vaccines as easy as walking in to the local drug store again like we did with the flu so there probably won’t even be a reason to run the system as getting sick would then be on you.

After this past year, I wouldn’t mind the first even though I’m halfway vaccinated, but I feel reality will shift towards the second option, at least in the states.

I get that you personally don't want to keep having the conversation, but in my own friend group about 10-15 people are refusing to get vaccinated because they think there is some magical ingredient that's going to cause birth defects or cancer or some unknown problem later on. There's nothing in the vaccine or its mode of action that would cause those problems. It's not like Zantec or any other pill, actually, in that regard. 

The CDC has actually said they don't think there is a risk to pregnant women who get it, but you're 100% correct that there is not enough data. The probability of impact from the clotting issue on the J&amp;J vaccine was so rare that it took about 6,000,000 people getting it to determine that it even happened. They are looking now to determine if 1/1,000,000 is statistically significant and what other factors might come into play. 

I get that you aren't wanting to get it because of your specific issue, but the recommendation for everyone who wants the pandemic to end is to keep pushing vaccines, and to do that, unfortunately, we have to have the uncomfortable conversations to determine who isn't getting it and why.

Canine presence is already normal at airports where dogs search for weapons, explosives, drugs or other dangerous materials. But they have been gradually making appearances at large events to sniff out COVID-19 following research that revealed their powerful noses could detect if a person was carrying the virus.  
  
**They’ve perused Miami Heat basketball games, scanned NASCAR races and inspected nursing home residents.**  
  
But just how accurate are they? A new “proof-of-concept investigation” by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania adds more evidence to the pile.  
  
In its study, nine dogs were able to identify positive coronavirus samples with 96% accuracy on average after three weeks of training.  
  
Researchers say using dogs can help catch people who are infected and don’t know it — otherwise known as asymptomatic carriers — before they spread the virus to others. This method is also cheaper than traditional testing practices. The study was published Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE.

3 months ago: Well, what a shitty Christmas and New Years. It would've been better if they'd just said from the start that the lockdown was going to continue to the end of the year. At least then I could've planned around it a bit better. Not that it matters, because the cases are booming anyway.

Now: Fucking hell. Either do a real lockdown or don't, but stop pussyfooting around. If it's dangerous to meet people, then shut down offices. If tourism is dangerous, then don't let people fly to fucking Mallorca. If it's so urgent to remain calm and roll out the vaccine, then why did you fuck up the vaccine acquisition instead of  paying for priority? And why does every decision to do anything with the lockdown seem to take weeks of discussion, only to end up with ""eh, let's keep doing what hasn't been working"" every few weeks. There's only so many times you can tell me that the lockdown will be for ""just a few more weeks"" before I realize that you're bullshitting me and have no intention of lifting the lockdown in a few weeks.",,,1618824883,{},gv2aoo0,False,t3_mtvskr,False,True,t1_gv29lqw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mtvskr/germany_looks_back_on_a_year_of_loss/gv2aoo0/,1618824894,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

As to how we find them, if they're big enough they can block blood flow causing a back-up behind them leading to things like a swollen arm or leg. They can be very dangerous if they're a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) as these can become dislodged and travel through your heart into your lungs, where they become stuck, forming a pulmonary embolus.

The National Institutes of Health will fund a large, randomized, placebo‑controlled Phase 3 clinical trial to test several existing prescription and over-the-counter medications for people to self-administer to treat symptoms of COVID-19. Part of the [Accelerating COVID‑19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV)](https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/activ) public–private partnership, the ACTIV-6 trial aims to provide evidence-based treatment options for the majority of adult patients with COVID-19 who have mild-to-moderate symptoms and are not sick enough to be hospitalized. NIH will provide an initial investment of $155 million in funding for the trial.

“While we’re doing a good job with treating hospitalized patients with severe disease, we don’t currently have an approved medication that can be self-administered to ease symptoms of people suffering from mild disease at home, and reduce the chance of their needing hospitalization,” said NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D. “ACTIV-6 will evaluate whether certain drugs showing promise in small trials can pass the rigor of a larger trial.”

Several drugs currently are [recommended](https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/therapeutic-management/) for the treatment of hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, including the antiviral drug remdesivir, the anti-inflammatory baricitinib, and corticosteroids. Additionally, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized emergency use of intravenous monoclonal antibodies in non-hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk for severe disease. However, medications that can be self-administered at home to reduce COVID-19 symptoms are critically needed.",,,1618850728,{},gv3lk5z,True,t3_mu4s0y,False,True,t3_mu4s0y,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mu4s0y/large_clinical_trial_to_study_repurposed_drugs_to/gv3lk5z/,1618854293,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Google Translate should work fine for this article. But in summary: this 'experiment' is no real science; it's just an excuse so people can have a festival after 1.5 year of restrictions.

There's no clear research plan, the sample size is unjustifiably big and all of that being said: there are allegations that the organisers (AKA the people that are selling tickets and making money of drink sales) have shady links to the 'researchers'.

Not only that, the entire thing is a super spread event waiting to happen. Currently we have anywhere around 160,000 people still infectious (total population = 17 million); so at any time roughly 1% of the population is a potential spreader. Right now the R value is hovering around 1.

The event will only be accessible if you get an antigen test, but I think that if you read my points below, it should become apparent as to why this 'experiment' is bound to result in increased cases: 

A. People who have tickets are extremely lucky (10k tickets, 1 million applicants), so they might even go with symptoms and fake their test or have a false negative somehow and get in.

B. People who attend these kinds of festivals tend to also be the most over represented group of covid cases: Young people. So not only do we have a high number of cases, the people most contagious are the ones going to this event.

C. The tests used aren't perfect, and with 10,000 attendees you are going to have multiple false negatives.

D. No covid restrictions apply once you're in.

And finally: E. People are going to be travelling there mainly via public transport.",,,1618785717,{},gv0oczb,False,t3_mtd1t4,False,True,t1_guyyaz2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mtd1t4/petition_against_kings_day_fieldlab_experiment/gv0oczb/,1618789030,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Hence why you figure out who, if anyone, should avoid J&amp;J before letting anyone else take it again.

It is a sign of how greatly manufacturing capacity has expanded over the past six months that the next billion doses could be produced by May 27th, according to Airfinity, an analytics firm (see chart). Yet this ambition is at risk from American export controls on raw materials and equipment. Production lines in India, making at least 160m doses of covid vaccine a month, will come to a halt in the coming weeks unless America supplies 37 critical items.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; On April 16th, Adar Poonawalla, the chief executive of the Serum Institute of India (SII), the world’s biggest vaccine-maker, put out a tweet begging President Joe Biden to “lift the embargo of raw material exports out of the US...Your administration has the details”. Suresh Jadhav, SII’s executive director, says “we are absolutely concerned,” and that in the next four to six weeks the production of two vaccines will be affected: AstraZeneca’s, of which SII makes 100m doses a month, and Novavax’s, of which it expects to make 60m-70m doses a month. SII says it first alerted the American government to the impending problem two months ago.
&gt; 
&gt; That was shortly after the Biden administration announced, on February 5th, plans to use the Defence Production Act (DPA)—legislation that grants the president broad industrial-mobilisation powers—to bolster vaccine-making. This legislation has helped American pharmaceutical companies to secure raw materials and equipment needed to make more vaccines. But American firms that supply products essential to vaccine production say the DPA hinders their ability to export them. They must seek permission before exporting goods, which requires time and paperwork, and if America’s government decides they need the goods, firms may be barred from exporting them at all. Some are also concerned about pharma companies outside of America stockpiling goods because of concerns about delays caused by American export controls. Together, export controls and stockpiling risk gumming up the global supply chain.
&gt; 
&gt; Vaccine production requires an array of special materials, including plastic tubing, raw goods, filters and even paper. Because all these items have to be specially approved by regulators to be used in medicine production, finding substitutes quickly can be impossible.
&gt; 
&gt; SII is not the only company to be concerned. Export controls also affect European vaccine producers, who need special bags from America in which to make their products. At a vaccine supply-chain meeting in early March, one European pharmaceutical company complained of 66-week delivery times for the supply of bags, commenting that it would be quicker to make a steel container to manufacture them in.
&gt; 
&gt; On March 24th, Micheál Martin, Ireland’s prime minister, warned that export bans (and not just from America) would undermine global vaccine production, and noted that the Pfizer vaccine involves 280 components from 86 suppliers in 19 countries. Richard Hatchett, head of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a global partnership to develop vaccines, says his organisation is “extremely concerned about constraints on global supply chains”.
&gt; 
&gt; CEPI is part of a new task force working with industry on this problem, and has also appealed to the World Trade Organisation for support. Its new head, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, held a high-level meeting this week, which concluded that stronger supply chains were critical to addressing global vaccine inequity.
&gt; 
&gt; If all goes swimmingly, the world could produce as many as 14bn doses of vaccine this year. But if vaccines and raw materials do not arrive where and when needed, production will fall grievously short of that estimate. Shortfalls in India will hinder its own vaccination programme, which is ramping up amidst an alarming second wave of infections—the country is recording more than 1,000 deaths per day from covid-19. And since India has banned the export of finished vaccines while it serves domestic needs, Mr Jadhav says that SII cannot fulfill its commitments to Covax, a global vaccine-sharing programme, and cannot deliver supplies to Europe and Britain.
&gt; 
&gt; At a time when many American states have a surplus of vaccines, with as many as one in three doses going unused, American export restrictions are not just galling. They may soon derail the plan to vaccinate the world.",,,1618785136,{},gv0n76u,True,t3_mtmmh7,False,True,t3_mtmmh7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mtmmh7/american_export_controls_threaten_to_hinder/gv0n76u/,1618788432,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

You don’t need sports to exercise, and there is nothing stopping any community from starting rec soccer or basketball leagues.

If I see someone working out, that proves they aren’t lazy. When I did cross fit we had overweight people join up all the time and they were just as welcomed as the lifelong athletes or the skinny minis.  

But your friends refuse to work out because they might be seen as lazy? That’s some really backwards thinking. Guess what? No one can judge them if they are getting a workout in at home, no one.

I mean I guess I can turn on my camera on my peloton, but I don’t because I’m sweaty as hell on a ride on that thing.

The real solution is to stop making excuses and put in the time now, so you get more time later. That’s it. The time for “have you thought about working out” has past.

1. Israel's numbers point to a major dent in cases a few weeks after they hit the 50% of the total adult population, so we should hopefully see a reduction in cases begin over the next 2-3 weeks (though this is understandably not guaranteed).
2. While the current USA COVID numbers aren't great (led by states with new surges), the severe cases and hospitalizations are way down, and certain regions that had major waves in the past (Texas) are now seeing their case numbers AND hospitalizations (the latter is important) plummet despite having no real restrictions.
3. Natural immunity does offer some protection, though likely less than what the vaccine does (especially against variants), but some is better than none in terms of reducing the rate of transmission (r0 number) and slowing the spread overall.
4. Less spread = less opportunities to mutate. Half of all adults in the US now being able to resist COVID will begin making it a lot harder for the virus to spread very soon, and it will only get better from here.

Strict lockdown = more restrictions than most of the world for a longer period of time.

While I could have been clearer, I guess I am stating that the vaccine significantly reduces the risk of transmission, but doesn't stop it. Perhaps it is an argument over semantics, but I equate the term ""stops infection"" with a nearly 100% rate of prevention in subsequent transmission of the virus; similar to what we've seen in the reduction of severe outcomes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everything that I've read suggests that the Moderna/Pfzier vaccines can reduce transmission in up to 90-95% of individuals post-vaccination and somewhere south of that for the other manufactures (see, e.g., this [summary](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/covid-19-vaccine-comparison) from Yale).  That's great progress. But I don't define that as ""stopping"" transmission of the disease and that may be where we differ.  Now, it may be that the remaining 5-10% risk of infection, when extrapolated across the population is truly nominal.  You suggest the risk of infection post-vaccination - even at that 5-10% - is ""extremely, extremely, extremely low"". I haven't seen any hard data on this point to help me reach the same conclusion, but would love to read up on the matter if you have a reference.  (As an aside, I'd agree with your assessment as to the risk of severe outcomes following administration of most of the vaccines because that has been a nearly 100% reduction.)

&amp;#x200B;

Moreover, children under 16 cannot yet be vaccinated. That means there are still A LOT of potential vectors out there for current and new variants to continue circulating and create additional opportunities to chip away at that 90-95% effective rate. And while there has been a lot of focus of the original strain being most harmful to seniors/those with certain comorbidities, there is evidence that the newer variants are more contagious amongst children. As a parent, this absolutely informs my continued assessment of risk and helps explain why I may be more cautious than a 20-something itching to resume their social life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I understand that no vaccine is 100% effective, but context matters, too. It's okay that many of our current vaccines are less than 100% effective because we've obtained herd immunity with respect to those diseases. That isn't the case for COVID. At least not yet. So it's completely rational to me that we would need to continue taking additional precautions (i.e., masking) for COVID that we do not for, say, measles.  Once a greater percentage of the population has been vaccinated - and I have no idea what that number is - then by all means, let's open things back up.

&gt; The vaccines have nearly eliminated death, hospitalization and other serious Covid illness among people who have received shots. The vaccines have also radically reduced the chances that people contract even a mild version of Covid or can pass it on to others.

&gt;Yet many vaccinated people continue to obsess over the risks from Covid — because they are so new and salient.

&gt;To take just one example, major media outlets trumpeted new government data last week showing that 5,800 fully vaccinated Americans had contracted Covid. That may sound like a big number, but it indicates that a vaccinated person’s chances of getting Covid are about one in 11,000. The chances of a getting a version any worse than a common cold are even more remote.

&gt;But they are not zero. And they will not be zero anytime in the foreseeable future. Victory over Covid will not involve its elimination. Victory will instead mean turning it into the sort of danger that plane crashes or shark attacks present — too small to be worth reordering our lives.

&gt;That is what the vaccines do. If you’re vaccinated, Covid presents a minuscule risk to you, and you present a minuscule Covid risk to anyone else. A car trip is a bigger threat, to you and others. About 100 Americans are likely to die in car crashes today. The new federal data suggests that either zero or one vaccinated person will die today from Covid.

&gt;It’s true that experts believe vaccinated people should still sometimes wear a mask, partly because it’s a modest inconvenience that further reduces a tiny risk — and mostly because it contributes to a culture of mask wearing. It is the decent thing to do when most people still aren’t vaccinated.

Every time you get infected with a virus its genetic material (DNA or RNA) goes into the cell, and makes the cell produce the proteins that the virus needs to make more viruses. This is pretty much true for every virus, even the ones that cause a regular cold. Happens to all of us all the time.   


The 'external molecule telling the cell to make a protein' is pretty much how all the cells in your body communicate, and figure out what's going on outside of the cell. You eat something sugary, the cell notices the sugar outside, and starts to produce insulin. The difference here is that the cell already knows how to make insulin, because that information is stored in its own genome.   


As far as vaccines go, we traditionally mass-produce something that looks like the outside of a virus, and inject it into people to get an immune response, which is a lot of work and takes a long time. Now we can use mRNA, and give a few cells in the body instructions to build that stuff for us.

The bartender (around 23 or 24 years old) and I went down the list until we found a pharmacy with availability for yesterday (Saturday) so he could make an appt. He's off Sat Sun Mon, so it worked out well.

Sometimes it just takes a friend (or good customer) to help move things along and get the motivation going.

Checked in with him earlier and thus far just the ""who punched me in the arm"" discomfort.

It helps that someone in /r/Orlando made a simple Google Docs spreadsheet with all the pharmacies and county sites offering, and included direct links. So we were able to start at the top of the list and move down until we found availability.

Another friend of mine around the same age just used the same spreadsheet to find and make him an appt as well.

It'll be good when the FEMA sites gear up first doses again during the J&amp;J pause... They had moved to second only Pfizer by appt and J&amp;J walk-up.

I'd say, then, that it's a combination of (a) an extra willing populace, and (b) a federal formula that favors smaller states.

Expanding on (a): NH is one of the better educated, older, whiter, least evangelical, least ""hippy enclave"", and (contrary to popular belief) least ""libertarian enclave"" states out there. All of those details would point towards a state that is going to be disproportionately pro-vaccine. The state republicans didn't take to Trump in the same way national ones did, so there'd even be less (but not zero) adoption of his pandemic-downplaying that commonly causes anti-vax sentiment too.

I hear a lot of people saying this, seems weird. Let's maths it out.  I'll include both the drive there and back, to be fair. 

Vaccine: 20 deaths in 20m, say. So that would be about 66 deaths scaled up to the UK population.

A) https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/922717/reported-road-casualties-annual-report-2019.pdf

B) https://www.nimblefins.co.uk/average-car-journey-uk  (source: dept of transport)

A) 1800 people each year die in the UK to traffic accidents. 

B) average 1.1 car journeys per day. Sounds low to me but OK. Though this is only 'car journeys'. Road accidents would also include bikes, pedestrians, ...

Anyway, that's 1800/365*1.1 = 4 people die in traffic accidents, statistically, if the whole country does 1 car journey there and back.

So from trips to get vaccinated we'd expect 4 people to be lost and from vaccination we'd expect 66 based on what we know.

All the trials combined had something like 3 deaths and 50 hospitalizations, and of course all were in the placebo arm.  Even taking that 50-0 split gives something like a [97.5% lower bound for efficacy under a reasonable bayesian prior](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/sca8jouz8f).

74/77M is roughly a 10^-6 chance of death.  Meanwhile among the other 251 million unvaccinated people, there have been 30,000 deaths over the last month (a dubious proxy for vaccinated versus unvaccinated risk, but sufficient to make the point), a 10^-4 chance of death.  That puts the efficacy at somewhere around 99%.

But this actually vastly understates things, since the first people vaccinated are overwhelmingly those with higher risk, 10-100x so.  The news we're getting about efficacy against death is overwhelmingly good.

In addition to all that, some of these cases were infected prior to vaccination.  In Colorado, 20% of deaths happen more than 30 days after symptom onset.  We don't believe vaccines do anything for ongoing infection (sadly) so this surely accounts for some of the deaths.  The US is trying to exclude those, as the recent news from Michigan shows.  In other countries, such as Chile where they claim vaccination is only [80% effective at preventing death 42 days after the first dose](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/big-chile-study-finds-chinese-vaccine-slashes-covid-77120616), this could easily account for nearly all of the deaths.

Cellular immunity is believed to be the backbone of protection against hospitalization and death.  People infected with SARS in 2003 are believed to [still have good protective immunity against COVID](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2550-z).  Helper T cells recognize infected cells by the spike protein they are emitting, giving off hormones to ramp up the immune system and activating killer T cells to eat those cells.  Even if severe flu-like symptoms result, the cytokine storm or autoimmune problems that result in really severe outcomes should be avoided.  Even partial efficacy at preventing contagiousness should greatly reduce rate of spread.

It is unlikely any state is going to be meaningfully supply constrained in 3 weeks (especially if the JnJ pause is lifted on Friday). 

All the current supply constrained states are chugging along at ~4-5% of eligible population incremental first doses per week. Three more weeks of that and about 65-70% of the eligible population is vaccinated in the supply constrained states. 

The challenge of maintaining pace of vaccination when you get to 65-70% vaccinated increases. You're asking 15%+ of the remaining unvaccinated population to show up and get vaccinated when this is the very population that has applied the least effort to get vaccinated. 

It would have meaningfully helped if the re-allocations started 3-4 weeks ago when it became clear that some states were not able to consume all supply, but at this point it is water under the bridge. 

In states - they have power to allocate however they see fit. There is definitely an opportunity to get better intra-state allocation. That said, there is a strain of thinking around rural populations are both most vaccine hesitant and most COVID-vulnerable (less self-protective behavior, poorer health, and more limited healthcare options) and, therefore, over-saturating those areas may be the better public health policy in terms of aggregate harm reduction if it makes it easier for this vaccine hesitant population to get vaccinated.

I don't think OPs description is entirely accurate, but I dont understand this take either.

The point is that vaccines make things *better*. They're not a time machine to 2019. They reduce the number of dead people, they prevent hospitals from being overrun, they help prevent variants. They *aren't* a magic wand.

Fauci is doing what he should be doing, telling Americans to keep wearing masks and social distance until the numbers drop.

You want Fauci to treat Americans like rational adults that listen carefully to recommendations and would understand the importance of people who aren't fully vaccinated to keep wearing masks, but if the CDC said that fully vaccinated people didn't need to wear masks (which they probably don't), then you know a bunch of asshole who aren't vaccinated would just not wear masks while claiming to be vaccinated.

Is masking and social distancing THAT bad? Genuine question.

If 10% of the population (kids 11 and younger) is still at risk, and the only thing the other 90% has to do is wear masks and social distance (stay 6 ft away from people not related to you), is that really something we dont wanna do in 2022?

I scour scientific info for vaccinations for kids (i have a toddler) every few wknds. Everything i see lately points to vaccines for as young as 6months old infants by early 2022, best case 2021 but more realistically the very beginning of 2022.
So if that’s remotely close to reality, and i think they’re being conservative with these estimates, then we’re talking about maybe 3 months of masking and social distancing into 2022 for 10% of the population.

Is that really that bad? Not for me.


Now, i’m by no means saying keep restaurants closed, sport events closed, no outdoor concerts this summer. No, i’m not advocating that.

That is the key word here. We do not really know. Other widespread human coronaviruses can reinfect you, but they only cause a relatively mild disease (common cold), so maybe the end game is similar for Covid? Less harmful after several bouts, but not to be eradicated?

Also, if someone gets three Covids in two years, they might be less vaccine hesitant after they get out of the third one. I am not saying that everyone will learn, but some deniers probably will.

Last thing - a historical remark. Those common cold coronaviruses entered humanity a long time ago.

I haven’t paid attention to any of the state government legislation on this, so if the republicans said that stuff I don’t care and still don’t, it’s not like I thought of republican politicians as rational human beings to begin with. My work started remote work late February, and by March almost no one came in. When the state order came in March to stay home, it wasn’t really a change for me.

Masks? As soon as the first case was detected in our area we put them on. I really didn’t care what the state had to say. Luckily we had a few n95s at home so shortages didn’t affect us. 

I don’t know, I might be a minority here, but I never gave a shit about what the state government was saying. Governor extended lockdown? Good they’re doing the right thing and I commend them but it wasn’t going to affect my life. Lockdowns are lifted? I’m still not going to eat at a restaurant for a while. 

My understanding is that a lot of places still require masks regardless of state orders. And there were violators despite state orders as well. So I think it’s an individual action as opposed to government action*

[],,BE_MORE_DOG,,,[],,,,text,t2_mn8te,False,False,[],"Thank you for pointing this out. Here in Canada we are getting the same messaging around this virus now impacting youth at higher rates and more severe outcomes. The problem is that the evidence behind this claim is entirely anecdotal. Nothing showing weekly admissions by demographics has been released to the public, so we must take our officials at their word. However the trust between the people and those in power is particularly strained and good will towards them is low. 

Some of this turns on the definition of ""young"". In my province of Alberta our chief of public health includes anyone under 65 within the definition of young. By this definition, there is some truth to the claim that more young folks are winding up in the hospital. But so we're clear, it's basically people between the ages of 50 and 65 that are seeing this. Are these folks young? Not by the standards of most. But it's all relative, and they are certainly younger than people in their 70s and 80s. If we're saying that people 40 and younger are being sent to the ICU in droves, that seems highly dubious. The severe cases of 20 and 30 somethings getting extremely sick and even dying still occur--but they seem like extreme outliers. 

My more skeptical side is wary of these claims around younger people entering the hospital at significantly higher numbers because I have yet to see convincing evidence. And this should be a very simple thing to prove with weekly age banded hospital admissions. The real question is why would health experts stretch the truth about how many young people are entering hospitals? What do they gain? Are they assuming it will happen, therefore this is all pre-emptive?",,,1618845966,{},gv3a7w9,False,t3_mtyz7s,False,True,t1_gv3298b,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mtyz7s/covid_once_spared_the_young_now_more_are_going_to/gv3a7w9/,1618847710,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I believe the 'virtually 100%' which they all appear to have is about medical intervention which is probably the most important factor anyway. 

If you read through these sources you'll also see a lot of other big differences in the trials overall and even their end point definitions. So it's just hard to draw a direct comparison. Or to put it another way I think we're making a gross over simplification to just compare the overall efficacy numbers obtained with different definitions and under different test conditions. 

And you might say the other day after dose ranges say 100%. Which is true but also proves the point that they just reported data differently. We can sit here and slice and dice this data all day long to get different % results. 

And this isn't binary. It's not so simple that you either have covid or do not. Or that you are exposed or are not. There is also a factor of viral load or how much you're exposed to. And what variants are you exposed to and so on. 

And to your point about there would be less cases in the placebo also then. You're correct there was less cases in the Placebo group in the Pfizer trial as well.

One of my issues starts with this point, as well.

Essentially, I feel kinda ""invincible"" in that after I get the vaccine, even if I do contract covid (a much rarer instance post vaccine of course), it most likely won't be serious in any way. Theres a decent chance I might even not know I got it, due to the vaccines effect on my immune system.

So am I ""invincible""? Essentially, if I dont mind getting a cold... effectively... yeah.

But it isn't about me.

I could spread it to those immunocompromised people you mentioned. Or just someone who hasn't gotten vaccinated yet.

Eventually, we'll need to accept that people who are stridently anti vax are just going to have to take that risk. But we're not at that point yet, purely numbers wise.

Every expert has said that removing restrictions is going to be heavily dependent on how many people have gotten vaccinated and the local case counts/hospitalizations—which are affected by the vaccination rate. There are multiple companies offering incentives to employees and patrons, although that has been controversial at least in the case of vaccine passports. The CDC has also released relaxed guidelines to people who are vaccinated but those aren’t going to matter to the people who didn’t bother with following them to keep from spreading a deadly disease.

The people saying there is no reason to get vaccinated are not being honest with you or themselves since public health and the government have made it very clear getting vaccinated is our best pathway forward to normal life. Their resistance to getting vaccinated is prolonging the very things they are complaining about. I’m all about incentivizing and making it as easy as possible for people to get vaccinated, but the messaging that restrictions will go away once enough people have been vaccinated has been crystal clear from the experts and the government.

In stats you see on hospitalization rates for children that use confirmed COVID cases are going to be massively inflated because most children have very mild symptoms or are asymptomatic and as a consequence testing rates on kids are very low.

This is nothing like the HIV drugs that target multiple proteins at multiple spots which makes it unlikely to evolve mutations in those proteins simultaneously. You fundamentally misunderstood what ""work in different ways"" for these vaccines means.

You have a selective pressure on the virus in vaccinated people that doesn't exist in unvaccinated. In vaccinated the virion progeny best suited for survival are those that can evade the antibodies and t cells that person has from the vaccine. Every infected vaccinated person is a chance for the rare mutation to develop. They're more likely to be infected by an unvaccinated person.

I assure you it's more likely that a mutant would out-pace our ability to vaccinate. Yes, we can do things insanely fast now. But no where near as fast as a virus can spread.

The hope I have that escape mutants won't be possible is that the RBD can only change so much before it can't bind ACE2. the fear though is several mutations that change the binding receptor(s) targeted could arrise.

Mate, what are you talking about? It isn't even available to everyone over the age of 16 everywhere until tomorrow.

The rollouts are called rollouts because they are staged processes. The earlier stages prioritize older people, so even in places where everyone is eligible now, **older people have been eligible for longer**. 

As such, it seems very intuitively obvious that younger people would be less vaccinated at the current point in time. At best, they have only had appointments available to them recently, and they have to compete with the people from higher tiers who couldn't find an appointment or didn't bother. I don't know what you're confused by. 

&gt;Meaning the percentages of the new people vaccinated should average out between all ages that weren't eligible before

That is where we're at now. Give it a few weeks.

First of all, you’re mischaracterizing what he has said on this topic by the pretense that he supports your assertion. Second, this is an appeal to authority, a type of logical fallacy. Third, a source is a work you can cite, not the author of it and certainly not just a person whose statements you can mischaracterize to mean what you claim. Fourth, press conferences serve a vital function in democratic oversight of public agencies, but they’re not how scientific consensus is established precisely because the medium lends itself to statements that present certainty where none exists. Off-the cuff statements or answers to questions from reporters on scientific questions can form a baseline to form an understanding from but should not determine an irrefutable stance you must defend even when new information emerges that contradicts it",,,1618784170,{},gv0l9jg,False,t3_msuohq,False,True,t1_gv0jffy,/r/Coronavirus/comments/msuohq/us_coronavirus_cases_rise_8_in_two_weeks_as_more/gv0l9jg/,1618787417,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The Spanish flu is a good example of a disease that killed healthy young people. Health does not necessarily dictate survivability but generally there is a correlation in most cases.

&gt;The long list of raw materials that SII imports from the US include filters, bags, and adjuvant. Large, sterile plastic bags are used to grow vaccine cells. An adjuvant is a substance that is used to increase the efficacy of a vaccine and helps the immune system generate antibodies.

&gt;While vaccine manufacturers can establish a fresh supply chain for raw materials like filters and sterile plastic bags, the disruption in the supply of adjuvant could hamper production for a longer period. Authorised vaccines are made with a certain adjuvant and any change in the vendor of that adjuvant would lead to fresh clinical trials and approvals.

&gt;“Developing new suppliers in the eleventh hour will take a bit of time. We will do that. We will not be dependent on the US after six months. The problem is we need it now,” Adar Poonawalla was quoted by India Today as saying.

I think Fauci has been a particularly good messenger. Although there are times when both administrations suppressed him from saying good or bad news or advice because it would be misapplied. 

Fauci absolutely knows that masking once vaccinated doesn't help enough to make it worth it. If he says that, people will listen to half the message and not vaccinate or wear masks because the pandemic will be over in their minds.

It was the same in the beginning when they chose not to emphasize mask wear so there wouldn't be a run on it and hospitals wouldn't be able to get PPE. Fauci knew masks helped before he said they helped.

The thing is, the reason why they are developing these booster shots and will probably make them yearly is because they want to make sure the vaccine stays effective against these variants. The vaccines we have right now are already very effective against variants and its very likely that this will be the same for this new variant. Plus new vaccines are being made and tested at the same time.
Look, I know this won’t be over globally for quite a while, but in some places it’s starting to be(like Israel) As people get vaccinated there are less and less opportunities for the virus to mutate(and some animals are being vaccined as well) Vaccines ARE THE END GOAL. They have always been. This ain’t delusional hopium about vaccines, this is real proof that vaccines do end pandemics validated by tons of research and studies. And do you know how much of a miracle MRNA vaccines are? Remember everyone would pray for and accept a 50% efficacy vaccine. We got some at 90-95%.

Why did you choose that rather than the combined set of numbers which show 70.4%? Bias? A desire to prove your point? Not sure but next you use the US trials which are a summary, not the specific breakdown that the article from Lancet had so can we assume that the single number they give is an aggregate? I mean, it would make sense, yes? If so that 76% is more comparable to the 70.4% from the Lancet, not the lowest number that you provided. That makes them pretty close, to be fair to the data. Now the last one... it's a look at how the vaccine fares against specifically the South African variant. But that's not the same as the other comparisons, is it? 

To my eye the data (ignoring sample size which seems pretty small for the most part) looks like a reasonably consistent set of results 70-76% with the vaccine not being very effective against the South African variant. Is that an unreasonable conclusion? Now, how does the Sinovac compare? It's hard to get accurate data. [This article is interesting](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/01/14/johnson-and-johnson-sinovac-and-more) and also highlights the lack of data issue.

No agenda on my part. Just want the most truthful and accurate information. My issue with Brazil isn't whether or not it's ""the truth"". It's that it's wildly different from other numbers... that all of the numbers are wildly different. I did not ""misrepresent"" the Chinese CDC claim (and in general you cannot trust the Chinese government on anything of political substance, that is simply a fact that gets repeatedly hammered home anytime something happens that might be viewed negatively and concerns China). Then I moved on to the point you brought up, that the results have a huge range. A range much larger than anything seen by the other vaccines, as I have demonstrated to you using your own data. 

Do you trust the Chinese government to tell the truth in matters that might reflect poorly on China? I have spent enough of my life in China to have a pretty well informed opinion of the government there (particularly as it has changed under Xi Jinping) and a quick look at just the first page of your post history shows me that you are almost certainly a Canadian 小粉紅.

However, some form of this virus will likely become endemic. It won’t likely ever be eradicated. I hope for the best there, but I do think we need to plan for a future with some form of COVID being like the flu. It seems we already are with booster shots.

So this brings up an interesting question: what is “negligible” spread of a disease that will never go away? I don’t think we’re there yet, but I also don’t think it’s zero COVID. It’s vague words like “negligible” that make people loose patience with restrictions because it’s not a concrete goalpost like a certain vaccination % or a certain hospitalization metric. It’s one of those words you can throw around to keep restrictions forever. Even when you talk about cases being “negligible,” you say we can “probably” drop all restrictions. This is where the push for full normalcy comes from, in many cases. I don’t want to go to a nightclub—it wasn’t my thing before COVID, either—but I am looking at a future where that kind of activity is restricted indefinitely.

As far as kids, I don’t think they should be factored into this calculus considering the flu is more dangerous for them. The main concern with kids is that they’d spread it to more vulnerable people.

[],,tossup8811,,,[],,,,text,t2_hgovmm,False,False,[],"I am not a scientist but honestly the vaccines seem relatively straightforward to me. We get injected with something that makes our body produce proteins that in turn our immune system learns to fight off, in the same way that it fights off actual viruses and other things. Once trained, the immune system recognizes this threat for probably many years and so we are much safer against that threat.

My interpretation is that the weird and dangerous (and very rare) side effects stem from the immune system going into overdrive for a short time while it responds to the threat. Which is something that it would do if we were exposed to the actual virus. Some vaccines stimulate the immune system in different ways (slightly different proteins) so this effect is more or less in different people. But the virus itself can cause blood clots, I am guessing in much the same way, because it puts the immune system into overdrive. When the body is under stress from the infection there can be severe (but very rare) side effects like blood clots. It's actually far more likely to get blood clots from the virus, if you get it, than from the vaccine.

Even though the mRNA vaccines are a new technology, it's just a new way of delivering the same thing and generating the same response. In fact so far statistically the mRNA vaccines are safer than the adenovirus vector vaccines like AZ and J&amp;J, perhaps because they can target different proteins more easily (or perhaps just by chance). The vaccine is not a drug, it doesn't linger in your system for years, it just triggers the immune system and is gone.

This is probably an oversimplification but this is why I didn't hesitate to take the vaccine. I have probably taken 10-15 vaccines in my life and the risk/reward is very clearly in favor of the reward.

We are all under very unlikely risks in day to day life, like flying in an airplane statistically increases your chance of blood clots, but we all fly anyway because the risk is very very small. At any moment in time, statistically we all have a 1 in 400,000 chance of dying on a particular day, but we don't obsess over it.",,,1618864966,{},gv4iuf1,False,t3_mtv2x4,False,True,t1_gv4e3uu,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mtv2x4/daily_discussion_thread_april_19_2021/gv4iuf1/,1618873513,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

- PPP loans are keeping thousands of affected small businesses afloat.
- Three rounds of stimulus checks totaling $3100 per adults, plus unemployment benefits paying at least $300 a week (was $600) until September of this year.
- COVID testing, treatment, and vaccines are all free in the US.
- The federal government and many states are freezing evictions. Some Republican states are only beginning to restart them again.
- The recently passed American Rescue Plan gives hundreds billions more to educational institutions and state governments

As a result, US household finances on the whole are actually in great shape:

- [Bank deposits](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DPSACBW027SBOG) gained $3.3 trillion from the start of the pandemic 
- [Home prices](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPINSA#0) gained 10%, [65.8% of Americans](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RHORUSQ156N) own their homes
- [Household debt service payment as a % of disposable income](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TDSP) is near all time low 
- [Household net worth](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TNWBSHNO) at all time high, not surprising considering how well the US stock market is doing. 54% of American household own stocks 
- [Real disposable personal income](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DSPIC96) is up significantly in 2020, but with far fewer venues to spend, [Personal saving](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A071RC1A027NBEA) spiked

- On the other hand, due to declining interest rate, [federal government interest expenses as % of GDP](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYOIGDA188S) is significantly below levels reached during the late 1980s and early 1990s

Two of the new cases are women from the Philippines, both in their 30s. They traveled to Taiwan to work on April 4 and tested positive just before finishing quarantine at a government center, the CECC said.

The third case reported Monday is an Indian man in his 20s who came to work in Taiwan on April 2. He tested positive just after finishing quarantine, and two people he came into contact with have been asked to observe self-health management protocols.

To date, Taiwan has recorded 1,076 cases of COVID-19, 960 of which have been classified as imported. Of the total, 1,034 have recovered, 11 have died and 31 are in hospital, according to CECC statistics as of Monday.

Globally, COVID-19 has infected over 140.9 million people in 193 countries and regions, with more than 3 million fatalities, CECC data shows.

Checked it using the Canadian vaccine dashboard and the EU-wide vaccine dashboard. Because the EU dashboard only gets updated twice a week (on Thursdays and Tuesdays), you have to compare it to Canada's Thursday figure.

So that's 9,205,307 doses administered in Canada on a population of 38 million.

And 103,457,179 doses administered in the EU on a population of 450 million.

So that's 23 doses per 100 people in the EU and 24 doses per 100 people in Canada. Thus a minimal difference.

Green, AKA low risk, is less than 1 care per hundred thousand per day.  The US is at about 20 right now, putting us solidly in orange.

&gt; At the green level, jurisdictions are on track for containment so long as they maintain maintenance levels of viral testing (i.e. this is not a reference to antibody testing) and contact tracing, sufficient to control spikes and outbreaks. Viral testing should be used both for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, with the latter need for testing flowing from exposure, role in a congregate setting or other critical context (e.g. elective surgery), or requirements of disease surveillance programs. It is not enough to get to green; one also has to plan to stay green.

&gt; At the red level, jurisdictions have reached a tipping point for uncontrolled spread and will require the use of stay-at-home orders and/or advisories to mitigate the disease. 

&gt; At yellow levels, there may be some initial community spread. At orange levels, community spread has accelerated and is at dangerous levels. At both yellow and orange levels, jurisdictions can make strategic choices about which package of non-pharmaceutical interventions to use to suppress the disease. One jurisdiction may choose stay-at-home orders; another may choose more intensive use of viral testing and tracing programs.

If you've been fully vaccinated, and you're two weeks out from having been fully vaccinated, meeting people who are also fully vaccinated and are also two weeks out from having been fully vaccinated is something that the authorities say is reasonably safe. I still wouldn't take off my mask in their presence unless I absolutely had to, and it still comes down to how much you trust these people and how they behave with respect to the pandemic.

Vaccines aren't going to make it safe to travel, because you can't account for the number of people inside the plane and the airport who aren't vaccinated.

Vaccines aren't going to make it safe to eat in a restaurant, largely for the same reasons.

If you have a job, your employer is likely going to force you back into work at some point during this year, if they haven't already. Vaccination doesn't really change how you should still be wearing the best mask you can for the duration of your shift, and how you should still be eating by yourself, outdoors if possible.

 Example, a friend of mine became ""fully vaccinated"" a few days ago (two weeks after his second dose). He's counted in that number of someone who is fully vaccinated and didn't get COVID because of it.

Which makes no sense. Lets assume that he got COVID the very second that he was considered ""fully vaccinated."" Well, he would still count as someone who was protected from getting COVID, because two days is not long enough for the symptoms to show, then get tested, and for that result to be counted. And again, that's if he got infected the very first moment.

Obviously, the short time scales we are looking at haven't allowed a lot of people to get COVID even if the vaccine did nothing. Most people who are fully vaccinated haven't been so for very long, due to the time that it takes to become fully vaccinated and that daily vaccination numbers are higher now than a few months ago.

And that's not even taking into account other stuff like that the demographics of people who got early vaccines are different than the general population, etc.

We'll see if I have anything else after my second dose. I haven't heard of severe nausea; I suspect that's not at all common. But actually, I'm kind of looking forward to some brief side effects, if I have them. It's almost like a rite of passage.

As for long-term effects--it's true that we don't know absolutely *everything* about these vaccines. But the mRNA technology (used in Pfizer and Moderna) has been under development since the 1990s. Moderna entered clinical trials in March *2020*, over a year ago. And almost a *billion* doses have been administered worldwide: https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/

More importantly--vaccines aren't like pills. They aren't a thing that you keep taking long term. That's one reason why long-term side effects are very rare with *any* of the vaccines out there. According to vaccine scientist Deborah Fuller, PhD:

&gt; Fuller said the chances of long-term complications are extremely unlikely because of how vaccines work.

&gt; “Most of their job is done in the first few days, then the vaccine is gone from your body. So what’s left is that immune response to the vaccine,” Fuller said.

This is an incredibly dumb argument. We know there are long-term effects to COVID, so you're willing to take the chance on getting COVID instead? If you're afraid of long-term effects you should absolutely get vaccinated. 

&gt; Well the extreme short term risk seem to range anywhere from no side effects to dibilating nauseau for up to a couple days, so i would like to not risk that if at all possible.

""Extreme"" short-term effect is called your immune system working, and most people (like me in my 20s) had a mild sore arm and nothing more. 

Lastly, you're missing the point that vaccination is meant not just to protect yourself, but those around you.

1. Everyone uses the argument that it was tested during more mutations, and while this is true this isn't even the main argument. Pfizer and Moderna have since been tested against the variants and have done well. So this is a moot point.

2. Page 94-96 in Janssen's report state that they reported their numbers after 28 days, that's where their the 66-72%, 85%, and 100% efficacy against mild, severe, hospitalization/death come from. But if you continue to read these pages you see that after day 49 post-vaccine the numbers rise to 95%, 100% and 100%. The B and T cell response increases over time with just 1 shot. 49 days isn't that much longer than the 5 and 6 week wait for the 2 shot mRNA ones, and they have the same efficacy at that point. 

3. On pages (24-27\* i think, let me verify in a second the exact page #s) they dictate what they classified as moderate covid... it included 1 or more symptoms such as gastrointestinal issues, coughing, sneezing, fever etc. Which is how the mRNA trials classified mild cases. So the metrics aren't exact. 

It's for the above reasons that you cannot compare the two\[3\] vaccines.   
Thankfully the US has done a good job at administering vaccines in general, the current J&amp;J hold doesn't impact us as much because the mRNA ones are rocking out here.

So at any given time, only a little over a hundred people out of a hundred thousand have active covid here (very rough estimate based on a ~2 week infectious period).  And some of those people are going to be feeling sick and staying home.  So I've got probably worse than a thousand to one odds of any person I encounter to be currently infected.  And if I do encounter an active case, there's no guarantee I'll actually catch it (since you don't automatically catch covid just by encountering it, not even close).  And if I would catch it, well I'm fully vaccinated, so that's a 90+% reduced chance that I'll be infected in that situation.  And If I DO get infected, new findings are showing that my viral load should be 75% reduced, giving me a 90+% reduced chance of infecting anyone else with it.  And if I would infect someone else with it, they might (or I think it's far to say at this point in my state, they *should*) be vaccinated as well, giving them a 90% reduced chance of catching it from me.  

And then even if ALL those hugely unlikely events all occur in a row and I actually manage to infect another person with coronavirus... there's still a huge probably that they're asymptomatic, or at least won't have a severe case.

Walking is the first step, and it’s all some can do, but plenty don’t even do that much, and that’s the issue.

30 minutes of activity, 10,000 steps in a day.

You might not see it, but when I go to a theme park it’s just 8 hours of wondering who my wife is going to have to save because for the first time in years they’ve been active and their body can’t keep up.

If you exercise then you’ll have less inflammation, body types do strong trend with physical activity though, and being overweight is still an issue even if you are active.

You can continue to try and play the PC game, but COVID DOESNT CARE WHY A PERSON IS OVERWEIGHT OR DOESNT WORK OUT.

We’ve given decades of compassion and support, now it’s time for personal responsibility.

Cause again, COVID19 DOESNT CARE ABOUT PC, pretending big bones or bad thyroid or tough life is not helpful, and you already said there are plenty of reasons why someone can’t work out, trying to take the blame off those who aren’t doing anything.

Not to mention our student loan payments aren't tax deductible and we also pay tens of thousands in malpractice and licensure fees. 


Where I grew up, teachers made more per hour than most non surgeon doctors. Granted, I lived in a place where the average teacher made 120k, so it was a bit of an outlier. 


In the 80s, doctors used to be able to not work that hard and still earn enough to drive around in a Benz. Now, most doctors are in Hondas/Toyotas and solidly upper middle class, but still taking home probably the lowest % of their paycheck than most major professions. If I make 170k as a pediatrician (average salary in my area, which you get at the age of 32-34 after completing residency/fellowship), I might get to take home 80k of that.

Sinopharm is probably the worst vaccine of the bunch. It works fairly well against the OG strain of Covid but it isn’t working well against variants. Still, even against the Brazil variant which appears to be the worst— it has a 50% chance of preventing symptomatic Covid and an 80% chance of reducing severe infection and death. That’s about as good as a flu shot. If the entire world got that, we’d be in a pretty good state. The *worst* part of it is how long it takes to become effective. Most shots work after just one dose— AZ, Pfizer, Moderna, they all give you strong protection two weeks after one dose. It doesn’t look like Sinopharm works at all after the first dose, according to the Chilean data just published... so you really need to act like you aren’t vaccinated until two weeks after the second dose. 

Sputnik is where things get complicated. Because if you believe the one single study that has been published, it has a ludicrously high efficacy rate— higher than even the mRNA varieties. This is likely primarily against the OG and UK strains but it’s still unbelievably good. The issue is if you BELIEVE the study... cause it comes from Russia. From a state run organization. The Chinese vaccine now has several other countries that have studied it and published results. We know the Chinese vaccine works, there are independent studies. We only know the Russian vaccine works from the people who make it. 

Personally, I think Russia’s vaccine works, if only because the first shot is verrrry close to how J&amp;j’s vaccine works (which makes sense since AZ and J&amp;J were supposedly hit hard by hackers during the vaccine process) and it’s entirely possible Russian scientists really perfected the second shot to make it much more effective. But there are more unknown risks with Russia’s vaccine than anyone else.

I've even gone over my own experience with her and how little it did to me; first shot felt like a small bruise on my arm, second shot was aches and chills for 8 hours but nothing too bad, and it really didn't do much to change her mind because 5 other people were talking about how badly they got knocked by the ""dreaded second dose."" 

It's ridiculous but baby gloves need to be on at all times with just about everyone with regards to vaccinations because even people you would expect a little better of might have an irrational fear that they're always looking for ways to justify.

As for your theory, I think you're way overthinking that. Not everything's some facebook conspiracy level thing, basic people can have basic fears, and any form of pain is often one of them.

I'm going to assume I had covid at some point in time, although I never tested positive.  I stopped getting tested after so long and just said If I get it I get it.  I was sick a couple of times throughout the year but nothing major.  Def had some flu like symptoms.  So.  That said.  Heres why based on what I know.  

Covid is hard to get a second time or can be less dangerous in most cases.  This is obviously not true 100% of the time but it seems to be a reasonable popular opinion.  So if I already had it, and it ddn't affect me much, why would I get vaccinated?

Also, the vaccine is already calling for a booster, and recently Phizer announced people will likely need a 2nd booster a year later.  So, is this a vaccine in the sense like Polio?  Or is it a yearly shot like the flu that might or might not help?  Or is it something in between and we just don't know enough?  

If we just don't know enough, I'd rather not be in the trial run of this vaccine.  Its not conspiracy, its just concern.  I dont think 5g laser Bill Gates mind control chips are going to be downloaded into my blood stream.  I have also been personally fully vaccinated (until covid), as has my family.  I fully believe that being concerned about the covid vaccine doesn't make me an anti vaxer.  And still, no one has answered my questions or concerns.

They are well-informed as to how safe and effective the vaccines are, but there also isn't a lot of data on how the current slew of variants react to the vaccines. Given how rapidly these variants surfaced after the original covid-19 virus appeared, we should also be wary of things that are not in the data pool yet, such as new or double-variants of the viruses. And the long-term efficacy of the vaccines is also something we don't have a lot of data on yet. Even Pfizer's CEO is messaging now that adults may need a 3rd shot before the end of the year, and seasonal boosters may be likely. There are good, rational reasons why the CDC still recommends vaccinated people to wear masks and remain socially distant when in public, because the epidemiological landscape for COVID is not completely set in stone.

I'm not sure they have conducted any extensive studies (maybe they are now?) to determine mRNA half life once injected. Also, besides the muscle cells (myocytes), where else might the vaccine be traveling in the body? It just seems like a big unknown right now.

Around this time last month, the state of things in Israel was that 60% of adults had received at least one shot. Hospitalizations had cratered for the elderly, but there was a small spike among young people. Sound familiar?

Today, Israel is almost fully reopened and has removed its outdoor mask mandate, and they are on a trajectory to further relax restrictions in the coming weeks.

The US should be there too in a month - the vaccines really do work. If we are behind the curve, it will be because we encounter too much vaccine hesitancy or because an unexpectedly bad variant starts to spread despite vaccines (possibly the Brazilian P.1 variant, by way of British Columbia).

When I was in my teens I had a very bad allergic reaction to something, basically my whole face swelled up to the point of not really being able to open my eyes and I got these disgusting, burning hives all over my body. My mom took me to the urgent care where they gave me a steroid shot in the ass. About ten minutes later I stopped being able to breathe right, then proceeded to start hyperventilating because I was panicking I couldn't breathe, then passed out. This was all while the nurse who was observing me post shot was telling me that I most definitely could breathe and was being dramatic. There was more to it then that which ended with the nurse losing her license but the upshot is that needles terrify me. On the day my puppy was getting her first round of puppy shots I passed out in the vets office. I am well aware that a steroid shot is not the same as any kind of vaccine but that's not how anxiety works

The vaccine is no harm no foul though, and would still likely protect an individual from severe symptoms as long as the strain isn’t too much different than the strain they’re vaccinated from (read more about protein spikes on viruses-interesting stuff). It’s a guessing game but scientists are pretty damn good at predicting and modeling every year and deserve a lot of thanks and appreciation.

On your assumptions about having Covid: I and a family member both had a very Covid-like illness about a month before Covid was declared state side. I got it from her. We were pretty convinced we had actually already had it based on our symptoms until she had antibody test which was negative. The point is, you can’t assume that without proper testing and factual evidence.

For those of us who were worried about the virus, the benefits of vaccination were obvious, but for those more worried about restrictions, between news articles that say getting vaccinated won’t stop transmission or only lasts 6 months (neither of which are true) they look at it and say “Why should I bother getting two shots that will make me feel like shit to protect me from a disease I don’t care about getting, especially if the vaccine won’t stop me from spreading it, and I have no indication that getting vaccinated will directly help make these restrictions go away?” This is why I suggest tying the removal of restrictions to the number of people vaccinated.

I don't think testing asymptomatic kids is practical, so I understand why schools aren't doing it, I'm just saying that I'm skeptical of claims that are missing key pieces of information. 

A lot of the early studies that said ""Nah, covid definitely doesn't spread among kids,"" were lacking the same data, plus their methodology in the studies was kinda sloppy. For example, some schools reported data based on theoretical policy, not real world conditions, and they included results from private schools (which are vastly different from public schools) and schools with attendance as low as 5%. 

I'm not an anti science weirdo, and I do want kids to go back to school, but I think some of the claims and policies in place are super sketch and may be missing key information. 

For example, in my area, the schools have made zero adjustments in their policies/practices in response to the new variants, even though we know that they've become the predominant strains in our community, and they make no distinction between elementary school children and middle/high school students who are known to transmit covid at vastly different rates.

[],,burnerburneronenine,,,[],,,,text,t2_39zduyrd,False,False,[],"Although I don't accept the premise (that I am fearful) of your rhetorical question, I'll give you a good faith response:

1. The vaccine only prohibits death/hospitalization from COVID; you can still contract the disease if you are vaccinated. Sure. It's a relief I won't die from COVID, but that doesn't mean I'm chomping at the bit to go out and catch it. 

2. There are still A LOT of people that have not been vaccinated. Estimates range from 70-90% of the adult population needing to be vaccinated to end the pandemic. (Note: this isn't to eradicate COVID. That's no longer possible.) That number will undoubtedly decrease as more children are eligible for the vaccine, but we aren't even close to reaching those numbers right now. (And may not ever if the polling numbers about those who refuse to ever be vaccinated are true) And so, it seems premature to start living my life as though there is no pandemic just because I am personally, fully vaccinated. 

3. Related: I live in a ""red"" area. There are A LOT of people here refusing to ever be vaccinated. Couple this with reports that people are forging vaccine cards, and you will have to forgive me if I distrust that the people running around my local Walmart are actually vaccinated and not just taking advantage of loosening restrictions. Which is related to the points above. Because of these people's actions, we are still going to have significant community spread here, particularly when the variants are added into the mix. So I continue to double mask in public because I don't want to get sick - even if I'm not going to die from it.

4. I live in a society and (I believe) I ought to respect my impact on others. There just isn't good data on whether vaccinated individuals that contract COVID can then transmit it to others. It requires literally no effort for me to don a mask in public to protect those in my life (including my own children) who have not yet been vaccinated. Why not take such a small step to be safe until community transmission has been reduced?

5. I have no problem congregating indoors with friends and family that are also fully vaccinated. But I live amongst too many selfish people to trust that I can behave the same way in public. ... Yet.

I think I'm acting cautiously, not fearfully. It has been a long year, but it has only been a year. A blip in what is hopefully a long, fruitful life. At the end of the day, I'm willing to put up with an absurdly small inconvenience for just a while longer to do my part to bring this to an end faster. 

(Also: this is anecdotal, but the vaccine hesitant I've spoken to express hesitancy not about the efficacy of the vaccine, but about the safety. And I'd say the safety concern relates to either the use of mRNA, which is relatively new, and/or the speed with which the vaccine was developed. I don't know that asking people to continue to wear a mask (or not) for some undetermined, but not indefinite, amount of time changes someone's mind about the safety concern.)",,,1618846763,{},gv3c4mr,False,t3_mu1fbv,False,False,t3_mu1fbv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/mu1fbv/why_do_so_many_vaccinated_people_remain_fearful/gv3c4mr/,1618848821,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

https://www.bts.gov/statistical-products/surveys/national-household-travel-survey-daily-travel-quick-facts

So 328 million people taking 4 car journeys a day vs 66 million taking car 1.1 journeys per day.

We would expect 328 deaths from CSVT in the US if everyone used AZN and assuming it's 1 death per million from the vaccine. 

38000 annual US deaths (from the source I just looked up) from road traffic accidents, 4 journeys per day.

That's 38000/4/365 = 26 deaths from the journey to get the vaccine.

326 for the vaccine, 26 for the trip.

In the UK it's 66 for the vaccine, 4 for the trip.

326/26 = 12.5

66/4 = 16.5

Almost exactly the same risk profile, the vaccine is over 10x more likely to result in death (assuming only 1 in 1 million die) than the car journey to take the vaccine.

But as you note: there is no evidence of excess deaths directly attributable to vaccination. And this is probably due to use of Moderna/Pfizer which don't seem to have the same (slight) risk profile of the AZN vaccine.

Which would make the car journey more risky in the US than taking a typical US vaccine.

Why?  


Fuels antivax sentiment, regulatory authorities and public health have said the vaccine isn't rushed and has been tested appropriately, yet they promptly do a reverse causing chaos.  


Many countries wouldn't do the risk benefit correctly, erring on the side of caution and more people would die of COVID.  


Richer countries and those with more access to vaccine would pass the vaccines off to poorer countries where vaccine hesitancy is already high and it would fuel the idea of a 2 tier world, many of those in poorer countries would refuse a vaccine that isn't allowed in richer countries even though the risk benefit was clearly in favour of taking the vaccine.  


It's also very sad this has happened to AZ and J&amp;J who make up the bulk of the production for poorer countries.  


It's all well and good the USA saying they'll stick to mRNA but of the 2 billion + doses pledged to COVAX (the main way the poorest countries get the vaccine) only 40 million are mRNA (Pfizer), AZ and J&amp;J make up over half. They literally can't not use those vaccines.

The people who should be getting vaccinated not for themselves, but for the common good. They’re the ones taking the risk with this vaccine. If the government kept administering that vaccine to those people, knowing the risk, then the next time a pandemic comes around, very few people would trust the government when they try to get people to take the new vaccine. Vaccine hesitancy is bad enough after the swine flu vaccine, but people say it was a fluke, a one time thing, and many are still willing to take a leap of faith and get vaccinated.
