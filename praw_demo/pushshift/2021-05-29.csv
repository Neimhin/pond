Mine's booked for the 9th, so I have a bit more time to consider. I've thought about speaking to my doctor about a different vaccine, but I guess there's so little known about the risk of *that* that I may as well stick with AZ.

&gt;	India has now blocked vaccine exports in order to prioritize vaccinating its own citizens—simply grabbing the vaccines meant for others. This is threatening to wreck the global COVAX program meant to ensure equitable vaccine distribution to help poor nations, creating the risk of a prolonged pandemic for the whole world.

And, even then, bought little. The result: by the time the second wave hit India with full intensity in April, just 0.5% of Indians had been fully vaccinated. No national leader has talked so much about vaccines and done so little about it, and Indians are not the only ones paying the price for it.

&gt;SII, maker of the Oxford-Astra Zeneca vaccine that accounts for 90% of Indian COVID-19 doses, was **slotted to supply half of the 2 billion vaccines for COVAX this year**. But it has stopped shipments since March and says it can’t restart supplies until the end of the year. With Serum Institutes’s global supplies on hold, **uncertainty looms for 92 low-income and lower-middle-income countries that were depending on COVAX**. Even if they find new suppliers, it will be months before the vaccines materialize. Serum Institutes’s cop-out means COVAX will be short of 190 million doses by the end of June.

SII has been rendered is such a dire state, thanks to Modi. He didn’t even help Poonawalla scale up his capacity, the man had to put his own money on the line here. 

At a time where the US, Canada and UK had acquired around 700 million doses India still only had orders placed for 10-12 million doses. For world’s 2nd most populous country. Let that sink in. 

Who’s to be blamed here? INC? Uddhav? Nehru? Pappu? Pakistan? Muslims? 

Who’s gonna be your new scapegoat this time?

[],,superjudgebunny,,,,,,[],"To more accurately sate this, all US mainstream media runs interference for politics.  Depending on who the major donors are, or which donors decide to speak out.  They speak out by bully tactics, pulled funding and what not.  As the media requires funding from big players, they have to cater to these players and keep them in a good light. 

It really breaks down to big players, big business.  They need to keep their income flow, so they can still be in the league of big players.  In order to do this, the media is used as a way to keep face.  As long as these companies don't get negative publicity they keep face.  

A good example is the ""made in america"" campaign. Lets look at the construction industry for that.  You'll have many ""American"" brands, such as Dewalt.  Upon closer inspection you may see those companies boast ""made in america"". Only recently have they added to their label, ""made in america with global materials"".  It's a cheeky way of saying ""assembled in america"". While certain supplies don't even say where they are made.  Using the same molds as they did when they were made in america.  Such as bits, screwdrivers, blades.

So the companies that keep these facades do not like media attention on the aspect that almost every part of their company isn't made in america.  It's either made in Hong Kong (china\*), China, Korea, or more recently Brazil. I would be shocked to see any major media outlets doing an exposé on where our power tool internals are made.

This is just a slice of how biased the media is and how it's run.  It's extremely more complicated as these are also global players now.  With globalization being the major driving force of markets today, most of these players are no longer patriotic or country bound.  They hold no responsibility for their country of origin, although some do exist you end up paying a massive premium. 

US examples would be Morse Tools, Klien tools, Proto Industrial, some pretty expensive stuff when you consider alternatives.  Stanley, one of the biggest brands, I'm not sure they make anything US anymore and if so it's very little. Most, if not all tools you will find in the trades are made overseas. Look up what Stanley Black and Decker owns, it's pretty crazy to think ALL those companies have been bought up by a parent company.  That's what I mean by big players who manipulate the media.

Now, in case somebody misunderstands what I'm about to say, *I do support kids returning to school* when it can be done safely in their district. For some areas, that benchmark was met a while ago. Some areas may still be in the thick of it and thrashing out the logistics. 

I also recognize that the isolation kids have experienced in the pandemic has been just fucking horrible. Kids need other kids. 

However, and this is the big one, it drives me nuts when I hear people implying that just putting kids back in school will magically solve the mental health crisis that kids are facing right now. 

I have a relative who keeps flogging the line about how everything will be fine when the kids can just go back to school and *everything will be back to normal*. 

It's not a magic wand. 

First of all, I'd bet a box of popsicles (the good kind) that in person school isn't exactly going to be back to normal. There will be adjustments in policies and routines. There will be increased anxiety when kids have random coughs from colds or allergies. Covid is probably still going to have a long shadow. 

But even setting that aside, the kids whose mental health have taken a hit during the last year and a half need *help*. Just putting them back in school won't erase the stress and trauma. 

There are a shit ton of kids who have developed legit mental illnesses that their families may not have been equipped (financially or in some other way) to handle. Pediatric therapists and psychiatrists have had long waiting lists during quarantine. There are probably a ton of younger kids with delays or undiagnosed ADHD that might have been caught by teachers or counselors, but their parents just didn't notice. There are undoubtedly a fuck ton of kids who didn't get necessary school-provided services (speech therapy or OT).

Possibly more since it's reasonable to assume that those who refuse the vaccine are also more likely to have adopted risky behavior and have gotten infected already and/or those who have been infected already are more likely to believe they don't need the vaccine.

No. But I would definitely say it’s going to be very difficult without real consequences. Those consequences don’t have to just be “laws” either, a deadlier pandemic would also wake some people up and naturally get rid of those still sleeping on it. The bigger problem in the US is that both the economy and the pharmaceutical industry are all too powerful and actively manipulate basic human practices to their favor. It would have been far cheaper and far more effective to send a two week supply of MRE’s (meals ready to eat) to every man woman and child in the US, along with 2 weeks pay and 2 week forgiveness of loans and told them to stay home for 2 weeks than to have followed the heavily politicized route that was taken.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-57214596

&gt;	The Pfizer vaccine was found to be 88% effective at stopping symptomatic disease from the Indian variant two weeks after the second dose, compared with 93% effectiveness against the Kent variant.
The AstraZeneca jab was 60% effective against the Indian variant, compared with 66% against the Kent variant.

The numbers look lower for AZ but this is likely due to the fact that it was measured sooner after vaccination (ie this is not a comparable study between vaccines):

&gt;	Public Health England (PHE) said the difference in effectiveness between the vaccines after two doses might be explained by the fact that rollout of second doses of AstraZeneca was later than for the Pfizer vaccine, which was approved first.
Other data shows it takes longer to reach maximum effectiveness with the AstraZeneca vaccine, PHE said.

What’s more informative is to look relative to the Kent variant, where they each show only a small relative reduction.

We have good data on the Kent variant efficacy where both Pfizer and the Oxford AZ vaccine show high and not significantly different efficacy:

&gt;Compared to unvaccinated, vaccine effectiveness for 1 dose was estimated at 54% (95% CI 50-58%) for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 53% (95%CI 49-57%) for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Compared to 4 to 13 days post vaccination, this was 57% (95%CI 53-61%) and 58% (95%CI 54-62%) respectively.
After 2 doses, effectiveness was estimated as 90% (95%CI 82-95%) for the Pfizer- BioNTech vaccine and 89% (95%CI 78-94%) for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine compared to unvaccinated. Compared to 4 to 13 days post vaccination, this was 91% (95%CI 83-95%) and 90% (95%CI 80-95%) respectively.

https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/990089/Vaccine_surveillance_report_-_week_20.pdf

This study doesn’t specifically filter by Kent variant, it’s just the U.K. population, but at the time of the study the Kent variant was the dominant strain.

1. The CDC still would have muddied waters early on about masks, and I think it would have been even harder for the other candidate in 2016 to convince the anti-mask crowd of anything.

2. There would still be enormous pressure from businesses to keep the economy open and reopen quickly to trade lives for profit. I think this was the biggest driving factor in our lackluster lockdown.

3. The science still would have taken a year to find out warmer climates fair better (outdoors makes transmission incredibly difficult) and the US has a super varied climate. Smaller countries closer to the poles (like Sweden) quickly found that lockdowns were effective and had a direct effect on the curve, where in warmer US states this was different than colder states, again muddying the waters on response and further provoking the more scientifically illiterate (not understanding the iterative process of science).

4. We lack a nationalized or even public healthcare system. While the national health organs (CDC, NIH, etc) can direct, and state health departments can enforce, the federal system means even hospitals didn't have a complete plan in place and new guidance was slow to roll out.

5. Hell, I'd even argue if he wasn't president he would be less constrained to say false things about the virus, running his rallies with that shtick for all of last year.

It's been happening ""forever"", yes, but it still has a noteworthy connection to climate change:

&gt; According to the United Nations Environment Programme the Coronavirus disease 2019 is zoonotic, e.g., the virus passed from animals to humans. Such diseases are occurring more frequently in the latest decades, due to a number of factors, so, as for now, 75% of all emerging disease are zoonotic. Large part of the causes are environmental. One of the factors is climate change.

The paragraph also links to a video by the UN environment programme which also highlights the connection between Coronavirus and climate change: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rr7u04m5Nc

My personal view on this: Climate change is destroying natural habitats for various animals, which in turn come in more contact with humans. This increases the chance for zoonotic diseases to jump over to us. There are many more climate change related pathways, but I don't want to write a book now.

You can go back and read my comment again, but I'm not extrapolating further until you at LEAST come up with an argument other than ""NO NO NO NO NO"".

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Anyway, even if it was, which it isn't, that would just be in terms of fixing up a problem that shouldn't have gotten so big in the first place. It's like congratulating someone who gained a ton of weight for losing 100 pounds, when everyone else just stayed slim.

Again, when the subject of discussion is current effectiveness of covid countermeasures, trying to muddy the waters by bringing up how the pandemic began and how individual countries treated it months ago is completely irrelevant and bordering intellectual dishonesty.

Furthermore, I think you would find yourself GREATLY in the minority by believing it wrong to congratulate a person for losing 100 pounds. That's a massive accomplishment that takes staggering willpower. This was a terrible analogy that, in my opinion, completely dismantles your own argument and highlights a very abnormal and potentially concerning worldview.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You're actually comparing the USA to India? That's the problem with the USA. They always find the worst case places to compare to, then think they're so great. How about comparing yourself to the best once in a while?

Absolutely, I am. You said the US would probably be one of the last countries in the WORLD to eradicate it, so why wouldn't I compare it to some of the countries in the world that are currently having the worst go of it? Would you have me omit all countries that are doing worse than the US so that it becomes the worst in the world to fit your worldview?

Yet again, the US IS leading the world currently when it comes to battling covid. Was it leading in the past? No. Will it be leading in the future? We'll see. You keep trying to gloss over the last year and a half as if its one singular time with no changes so that you can safely say ""US BAD"", but it isn't that simple. Ignoring the major advancements the US has made since January is laughable at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Look at all of the deaths in the USA, all of the money wasted, when countries like Taiwan or New Zealand just took care of things in the beginning, so are doing pretty well, and nowhere even near the catastrophic USA?

Yep, already covered. Completely irrelevant to how the US is currently handling the pandemic. Best in the past? No. Best now? Arguably, yes.

&gt;\*\*Are adverse reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine recordable on the OSHA recordkeeping log?\*\* DOL and OSHA, as well as other federal agencies, are working diligently to encourage COVID-19 vaccinations. OSHA does not wish to have any appearance of discouraging workers from receiving COVID-19 vaccination, and also does not wish to disincentivize employers’ vaccination efforts. As a result, OSHA will not enforce 29 CFR 1904’s recording requirements to require any employers to record worker side effects from COVID-19 vaccination through May 2022. We will reevaluate the agency’s position at that time to determine the best course of action moving forward.

In most Western countries, the average elected politician is only about a decade or so older than the average citizen, and a large portion of the citizens are significantly older than the vast majority of politicians. Parliamentarians/congressmen etc are usually not much fatter than the average person in the West, or even thinner in some cases.

In a lot of African countries, the average age for a politician seems to be about three or four times higher than the average citizen (in fact, the average citizen isn't even old enough to vote in a lot of countries). And obesity levels are much higher too. That's easy to see just by looking at photos of parliamentarians.

There could be a bad death toll amongst the elderly sections of many African populations, and the death toll in those countries would still be low compared to the developed world simply by virtue of how small the elderly population is. for example, in DR Congo (the country mentioned here, only 2.5% are over 65. A country like that is inevitably going to have a *much* lower death toll, even with poorer health care.

btw, Iran had a very high death toll among its politicians around February/March. Of course, Iran has older demographics to most sub-Saharan African countries.

It's not my company either. That attitude and the message it attempts to convey never makes its way up to the ""evil"" owner or CEO, it just creates work for mainly me, but also those who do take on the responsibility for whatever reason.

At the end of the day, I need to make sure shit keeps moving. ""not my company, not my problem"" just creates problems and work for me. Why can't I adapt that attitude? Oh, that's right, if I did that, things would suck for my employees. Maybe I shouldn't care about the wellbeing of my employees. Perhaps I should say ""screw them, not my company, not my problem""

That's right! I forgot, ""you signed up for it and took on that responsibility"". Damn, I sure wish that could apply to everyone. That way, I wouldn't need to work so damn hard. Oh well. I guess the 50-60 hour weeks are all worth it for that five - figure salary. Bling bling!

I hope to God you never work for me. I would love to spend more time with my family instead of having to deal with pispoor attitudes. Just remember, when your ""sticking it to the man"", you're really just sticking it to some poor sap who decided working hard has value. I bet you are the type to leave a carton of milk in a non-refrigerated isle because you decided you didn't want it. Sticking it to the man!

The vaccine protects yourself from those grave consequences - which most younger people don't have anyway. It's not yet known whether you can still pass it on to others, but then again, they will likely not suffer grave consequences unless they're older, in which case they should get the vaccine.

That’s fine, people are free to jump off cliffs if they want to, even though we’ve been warning them not to do that.

https://www.healthline.com/health/leading-causes-of-death


So, your  fat ass and every other fat ass cost me money, personally. Our healthcare system cannot keep up with the fatness. Insurance pays out and raises rates. You go on FMLA, disability, call in sick. 

Added: so as a business owner.. I’m gonna not hire fat people. They cost to much. Is that ok??

Also, Covid has huge correlation with poor outcomes and obesity. 

And, the marketing for shitty foods to low information people and children is huge and should be regulated. 

However, you make a fantastic point, leave me alone and stay out of my business. I’ll eat McDonalds if I want. I know the risk. 

I know the risk for Covid and don’t want to put the vaccine on my body. Not your business to know why. My body my choice. I get it that the vaccine isn’t 100%, but spare me the lame argument that you might still get it, or you can’t get the vaccine. Not my problem. 

And.. your fat ass should be vaccinated thus immune , so why care what others do? Honestly? 

Lastly, I can’t help but distrust the big pharma complex. Ya know.. opioids not being addictive and all. Sorry to say I personally sold that line to my patients for YEARS. Turns out it was a lie, and it was known to be a lie. How many lives were ruined? Forever. They LIED. The government covered and pharma got rich. Who got blamed? Pill mills and poor people.

What you said is the equivalent of saying ""how do we know that car won't be going lightspeed within a couple hours?"".  It's a really weird heuristic, because you would then have to wait longer than a person's entire lifespan before deeming medication safe—possibly not even then, since lifespans are increasing over time.

There are constraints on what is possible and we have hundreds of years of direct and indirect data/research to lean on. The US Vaccine Agency has been around since 1813—predating the first car by 73 years. Most side effects for vaccines emerge within days, rarely they'll emerge by about 3 weeks, extremely extremely rarely it'll take up to 8 weeks or so. Pfizer began human trials 04/23 (after doing some trials with rodents and macaques), so we've had an extra 49 weeks after that first 8. The larger the sample is, the greater the likelihood of catching extreme outliers, as well.

The ingredients of the vaccine don't hang around in your body waiting to have some weird interaction. For example, mRNA breaks down on a timescale of minutes to hours if not translated (read and used to assemble a protein from your body's nearby 'ingredients'), and if it *is* translated, your cell shoots out an enzyme that destroys it.

You can literally ask any stranger you pass by if the world is complicated. You’ll get an answer very quickly that way. 

My point is simple. If we think we have any control in this situation, we must exercise it. Allowing employers to require vaccines makes sense for numerous reasons. Refusing to allow them to require it because you’re afraid of future hypotheticals is not a valid reason in my mind. 

Again, put in safeguards. When they step out of line, put them back in line.

[],,hwy61_revisited,,,,,,[],"Terrible article for a number of reasons:

1) Absolute Risk Reduction is useless in comparing different vaccines because it relies entirely on the attack rate. The attack rate on the unvaccinated population isn't going to vary because of what vaccine the vaccinated population has, so it's introducing an irrelevant variable. All the vaccines are going to see similar real-world conditions so it's the efficacy that matters.

2) They're using interim report numbers from the trials. More effective vaccines can achieve statistical significance with fewer cases; a 95% effective vaccine will show a strong divergence between the two arms very quickly, while a 50% effective vaccine will take much longer. The end result of that is the less effective vaccine will tend to have a higher attack rate (because the length of time to the interim readout will be longer) which will increase the ARR. Conversely, a more effective vaccine will have a lower attack rate at the interim readout and thus have a smaller ARR.

3) They used outdated and incomplete numbers. If they had used the latest Pfizer numbers from late March/early April (which were released prior to when this was a preprint), the ARR would have been about 3.3%. Moderna's would have been similar. AstraZeneca's US trial (which ran over the same time period of summer 2020 -&gt; winter/spring 2021 and in the same location) would have had an ARR of approximately 0.7% based on their case numbers (190 of 32K with a 76% efficacy).

ARR is useful for a rarer disease and when you're balancing side effects vs. risk reduction. Someone taking an Ebola vaccine in North America is going to see virtually no risk reduction, because they'll almost sure never encounter it. But someone in West Africa would see a higher risk reduction, so that informs whether it makes sense to vaccinate.

None. 

This is the part that you’re missing:   Whether vaccinated people wear a mask or not doesn’t effect them at all. So the cdc really doesn’t give a shit what they do. It’s not their job to hope that people take an action (dropping masks) that has no effect on them.

As an example, I could see a single parent, without family or friends helping them out, having to work 2-3 jobs at minimum wage to raise their two kids. And they maybe don’t even have a car to get to a vaccine site (substantially increasing the time needed to commute to a vaccine site). Additionally, in order to have the job(s), they gotta put their kids in daycare (especially as many schools are still closed), which is a substantial amount of money on top of their normal expenses. Daycare would, naturally, take a heavy toll on their mental health, furthering the issue. 

For some, it isn’t a matter of just doing it on the weekend or evening, a typical downtime for many. Some people simply do not have downtime and/or the physical/mental energy or financial resources or assets to get the vaccine.

This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions. However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data.

[],,reddit0r_,,,,,,[],"Modi fucked up big time. The government's fuckup started last year when they failed to buy vaccines upfront although it's stupid to compare what countries like US, UK or other Advanced Economies did and what what people expected India to do. It's extremely unfair. We lacked a solid strategy for vaccination and here our government and policy makers just didn't think through, there was and still is no white paper detailing national vaccination plan. The most disastrous thing about our vaccination program was mismanagement of our vaccination portfolio, where we had an over reliance on vaccine like Novavax which didn't pan out and I don't know if government can be entirely blamed for it because this sort of stuff is bound to happen under uncertain environment. They hedge their bets on one thing, if it delivers you look like a rockstar and if it doesn't you look stupid. The over reliance on Novavax in government portfolio was indeed a very foolish and grave miscalculation. US ban on exports of raw materials didn't help the case. Government is entirely to blame for not updating their Bayesian model when it became clear that Novavax was going to be a flop. The government also failed to understand the severity of second wave and misjudged the demand/supply of vaccination and how severe the supply side shortage would be under the distress of second wave and urgency caused by it.

Disclaimer for what I'm about to write next, it's not an apologia of government  but to give people an idea about ground realities, which are absolutely useless details for western consumption, maybe that's the reason they don't find any mention in these op-ed pieces written for western publications. My view on how and where our Union government fucked up are written above and pretty clear. I want to present political realities of my country to make people give context to some of the decisions the union government made. It doesn't abdicate Union government of its administrative and moral responsibilities, Modi administration is extremely incompetent but the political opposition of this country is absolutely vicious and self serving. The whole  of pandemic right from the start has been extremely politicized and vaccination has been made a political issue in the same trend. One fact, the opposition tries to paint government as government for cronies. Had Modi administration pre ordered x amount of vaccine and paid for it upfront, this would surely have become something to attack government with. Since this did not happen, the opposition leader used vaccine pricing as an issue to label vaccine makers as cronies and attacked government. Another fact, opposition screamed at government for the decentralized approach when it comes to vaccine procurement. They asked that if they were willing and capable of paying for the vaccine, why is only Union government doing the whole exercise when it makes sense for states to do it. They wanted liberalization in procurement of vaccines and now they want a centralized procurement. The commentariat and their fascination for decentralization, federal structure of governance and States being a key player in decision making is nauseous beyond belief. They'll write long, sophisticated pieces about these issues, in fact this whole experimentation of decentralized procurement was made a big agenda before it happened and now that opposition has done 180, the commentariat stands exposed and embarrassed. Another fact, key opposition leaders fuelled doubts about homegrown vaccine, labelling it BJP's vaccine and criticizing government for giving it emergency use authorization. The decision on whether it is suitable to use any vaccine is not made by government, it's made by technocrats advising them and clearance is firstly provided by technocratic bodies. The opposition didn't care about any of these facts. There are whole lot of another political issues but I don't know if they'll interest anyone here.",,,1622377863,{},gzywdkb,False,t3_nnq0lr,False,False,t3_nnq0lr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nnq0lr/india_modi_never_bought_enough_covid19_vaccines/gzywdkb/,1622470212,8,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_l0ict,False,False,,

I think the real point of contention is some people think China did this on purpose, like they made a disease they wanted to spread quickly and then released it, which is absurd because it hurt China tremendously and they had to have known that would happen. Occam's razor says this happened the way most diseases spread to humans, China did the normal China thing and covered it up while simultaneously watching their hospitals overflow and building tent hospitals to try and keep it under wraps, then finally admitting something horrific was happening and they'd lost control.

A lot of money and time is going to be spent on this, but it'll come down to closing wet markets and excoriating China, with an outlier possibility of it being a lab issue and demanding higher standards for containment.

&gt; The State argues that the intent of the current version of the statute is to remove the former requirement that a person be upon a highway to be prosecuted for drunk driving.[6] The earlier version of W.Va.Code 17C-5-2 [1957] said:
It is unlawful and punishable as provided in subsection (c) of this section for any person who is under the influence of intoxicating liquor to drive any vehicle on any highway of this State . . . .

&gt; However, penal statutes must be strictly construed[7] and notwithstanding our own inferences with regard to the Legislature's intent in changing the language of this particular section, we must find that W.Va.Code, 17C-2-1 [1972] requires that if chapter 17C is to apply elsewhere than upon streets and highways a different place must be specifically set forth. In the criminal law the question is never what the Legislature intended, but rather what a person of ordinary intelligence would infer from a plain reading of the statute involved. In this regard W.Va.Code, 17C-5-2 [1976] does not specifically refer to another place. **Consequently, we must hold that the charge of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquors cannot be sustained against the appellant because the State was unable to show that he was drunk while on a street or highway.**[8]

It was a  March 8th interview. 

In the clip, Dr Fauci says “There’s no reason to be walking around with a mask. When you’re in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet, but it’s not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is. And, often, there are unintended consequences — people keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face.” 

Prior to this statement he said:

“ right now people should not be walking around with masks” 

Now to be fair, he did say infected people should wear them but at that time in March we had no idea who was or wasn’t infected. 

The next guidance didn’t come out till April 3rd

“The interview predates the CDC’s updated guidance on the use of face coverings. On April 3, 2020, the CDC updated its previous advice and recommended people wear cloth face coverings “in public settings when around people outside their household, especially when social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.”  “

Look I understand in early March thru April there was a lot of not knowing things about this virus. 
And things changed very quickly. 

Also, in an undated interview he admits he originally said  no need for masks but did say he said that may change in the future. 

Which of course did happen. 

I also believe that the ppl hanging onto the “he said no masks then flip flopped” are idiots, 
There’s is no logical reason to not change with the time as info became available.

Some countries are currently higher, others much lower as well. Also, because Europe just came out of a third wave, it saw higher than normal test positivity, which is normal. All countries, including the US, had a higher test positivity during all of their waves.

And even the worst country in the list, the Netherlands, has enormous test capacity and testing sites everywhere, it is just that there is no demand. You can get an appointment the same day and get results back within a day as well. There is much more testing capacity than being utilized here. Also, there are lots of testing sites everywhere. Most could just cycle to a nearby testing site. All of this is sperate from at home testing, testing at private test locations or testing for travel/events. This just has to do with low demand of testing.

 In any crisis, there are multiple phases: 

* identifying a possible threat, 
* understanding the nature of the threat, 
* understanding the impact of the threat to various resources and the relative risk, 
* identifying possible methods (mitigations) to alleviate these threats to resources, 
* choosing the right methods (mitigations)
* forming these methods into a set of policies or laws
* communicating with the population the above steps
* monitoring the effects of the policies and adjusting where necessary

Each of these phases 'kind of' happen in parallel and involve many different parties. The time it takes to go through each phases and the level of complexity depends greatly on the preparedness. 

As you can imagine, when a state is insufficiently prepared, the complexity can turn into chaos. The structured approach goes out the window and we see contradictory advice, insufficient communication with outside parties, muddled accountability, cohesion is lost, decision making becomes inefficient and ineffective, moral judgement is lost, state laws are broken.

Chaos in itself is not inherently bad, but it requires a completely different approach than the 'usual' crisis management. 

There is quite some evidence that the Dutch policy making became chaotic. Contradictions w.r.t. aerosols. Insufficient threat analysis within nursing homes. Steering on the wrong measurements (# infections / day instead of Rt). Wrong communication strategy (RIVM / OMT communicated directly at first, instead of via cabinet). 

It is important to understand that these failings have occurred in the decades leading up to this crisis. For example, we have institutes such as the NCC (Nationaal Crisiscentrum), and the ICCb (Interdepartmentale Commissie Crisisbeheersing). Where were they? Did they setup international connections in order to tackle continental or global threats in a prepared fashion? And if so, why did they not become operational?

Lastly, the RIVM should have known better to downplay the risk in January and Februari 2020. There were two important metrics which define the risk and impact of any transmissible disease: R0 (basic reproduction number, that is the speed of spread) and IFR (infection fatality ratio, number of people dying of the disease). Both were already estimated to be high in January and February.",,,1622397887,{},gzzwi4o,False,t3_nnzbbc,False,True,t1_gzzb755,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nnzbbc/we_need_to_know_how_covid19_emerged_so_we_can/gzzwi4o/,1622493470,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_30p79l,False,False,,

All staff should be up to date with their routine immunisations, e.g. tetanus, 
diphtheria, polio and MMR. The MMR vaccine is especially important in the 
context of the ability of staff to transmit measles or rubella infections to 
vulnerable groups. While healthcare workers may need MMR vaccination for 
their own benefit, they should also be immune to measles and rubella in order to assist in protecting patients. Satisfactory evidence of protection would 
include documentation of having received two doses of MMR or having had 
positive antibody tests for measles and rubella. 

Selected vaccines 

BCG 

BCG vaccine is recommended for healthcare workers who may have close 
contact with infectious patients. It is particularly important to test and 
immunise staff working in maternity and paediatric departments and 
departments in which the patients are likely to be immunocompromised, e.g. 
transplant, oncology and HIV units (see Chapter 32 on TB). Hepatitis B 
Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for healthcare workers who may have direct contact with patients’ blood or blood-stained body fluids. This includesany staff who are at risk of injury from blood-contaminated sharp instruments, or of being deliberately injured or bitten by patients. Antibody titres for hepatitis B should be checked one to four months after the completion of a primary course of vaccine. Such information allows appropriate decisions to be made concerning post-exposure prophylaxis following known or suspected exposure to the virus. 

Influenza 

Influenza immunisation helps to prevent influenza in staff and may also reduce the transmission of influenza to vulnerable patients. Influenza vaccination is therefore recommended for healthcare workers directly involved in patient care, who should be offered influenza immunisation on an 
annual basis. 

Varicella 

Varicella vaccine is recommended for susceptible healthcare workers who have direct patient contact. Those with a definite history of chickenpox or herpes zoster can be considered protected. Healthcare workers with a negative or uncertain history of chickenpox or herpes zoster should be serologically tested and vaccine only offered to those without the varicella zoster antibody.

Breakthrough cases are massively undercounted because of non-test bias (""I got vaccinated, so it must not be COVID"") and under-reporting bias (test sites typically don't ask if you've been vaccinated, and there is no state DPH clearinghouse after testing either). Breakthrough reporting is entirely voluntary with only a few large providers participating. 

Breakthrough risk as reported is also a bad metric overall because it is a constantly changing metric (over what duration? over how many person-days? what's the community case load?). That is why vaccine efficacy is measured.. with efficacy statistics. Which we know to be ""about 95%"". 

This is not meant to be a ""the sky is falling post"".

[],,toontje18,,,,,,[],"My country has been seeing around half the level of deaths since our vaccination program began compared to the US (per Capita). While seeing 2 to 3 times as many cases as the US per Capita. So we were doing something right (low deaths) but also something wrong (high cases) in my country compared to the US. My guess would be using the scarce vaccines more efficiently than the US. Here, they managed to get the most vulnerable (like seniors and people with comorbidities) vaccinated very quickly with limited supply and more importantly, get a much higher vaccination rate within this group. But on the other hand, here they death less vaccines overall compared to the US, and that is why we still had a third wave in terms of cases (but not deaths). 

Now, everything is going well luckily. They have given around 53 doses per 100 people. We are reaching the lower 40's in terms of age groups with around 48% of adults at least partially vaccinated. And it seems we will have at least partially vaccinated 85% by early/mid July. Vaccination readiness in the adult population is around 85 to 90%. After that, vaccinations in teens should start. Deaths (were already very low, now even lower), cases, hospital/ICU occupancy are all dropping very quickly. Reproduction number is sitting around 0.8 now. And they have been letting go of restrictions for months now, and the the coming weeks this will accelerate even further. So it is all going well.

My country in terms of vaccinations is similar to the rest of the EU, but they have been one of the worst in terms of cases, but one of the best in terms of deaths (and it is not as if my country does something fishy with the numbers or undercounts deaths excessively, it is just average). So a EU-US is a better comparison (just wanted to throw in my country, because that is what I know most about, and why not). Just looked up the OWiD figures, deaths in the EU are now lower than in the US per capita and the trend downward in the EU is much steeper than in the US. Cases are just a bit higher in the EU, but they are very similar now, and the downward trend in the EU is much steeper than in the US.",,,1622342344,{},gzxq6t7,False,t3_nnzbbc,False,False,t1_gzxo6jh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nnzbbc/we_need_to_know_how_covid19_emerged_so_we_can/gzxq6t7/,1622445391,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_meeqp,False,False,,

You'd rather travel restrictions remain until everyone has had a chance to be vaccinated out of some twisted sense of fairness That's a big slap in the face to younger people who want to take a vacation now that it's possible and have no problem with getting a test so I don't think you should talk about slaps to faces.


And you keep talking about it being unfair that unvaccinated people are at a higher risk of having to cancel/postpone a vacation than unvaccinated people, but you forget that no one is forcing them to book a vacation and that if travel restriction were in force until everyone can be vaccinated they wouldn't even have the option to go on vacation.",,,1622329226,{},gzx48je,False,t3_nn1cyx,False,True,t1_gzwy706,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nn1cyx/greece_ready_to_use_covid19_pass_before_july_to/gzx48je/,1622433147,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],[],text,t2_tmohk,False,False,,

You're actually comparing the USA to India?  That's the problem with the USA.  They always find the worst case places to compare to, then think they're so great.  How about comparing yourself to the best once in a while?

Look at all of the deaths in the USA, all of the money wasted, when countries like Taiwan or New Zealand just took care of things in the beginning, so are doing pretty well, and nowhere even near the catastrophic USA?
