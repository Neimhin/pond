Right, and I'm saying it's not, because despite the apparent correlation, herd immunity doesn't work that way.  The virus needs X number of people available to it to keep spreading, and as long as X people are available, it can keep spreading, accelerating as it finds pools of people to infect, and spreading more slowly when mostly immune people are exposed.

Imagine one of the cruise ships that was originally infected..  if it had 1000 people on it, and 500 were vaccinated what do you think would be the difference in how many were eventually infected, and how fast would they be infected?

The former number is easy to guess - 500 people would eventually be infected.  The amount of time it would take, however, does not depend on the number of immune people... rather, it depends on how many of the non immune people are sharing air, how often, are they in close quarters with each other, etc.

Your hypothesis would be correct if immune people were distributed in such a way that it was 100% random whether they or non immune people were exposed to the virus.

There's a comment I made in /r/covid19 back in March/April saying I'd volunteer to get it to contribute to herd immunity since I have a pretty ideal situation for quarantine, that got pretty upvoted. I think I wasn't afraid because when I first started hearing about it, I only looked at the raw data and studies, and it was known even then that this was a very age stratified disease. I'm 30F and pretty fit overall. I also assumed I would get it since in normal times, I take public transit to work. Obviously that changed to WFH. 

I distinctly remember having some zoom chats with friends in March/April. A third were panicked and another third had the attitude of ""I'll get it eventually, wouldn't mind getting it over with."" This changed a lot over time, now it's a social death sentence to get covid. None of those groups have gotten it, btw. 

Idk, I've just never been afraid of it *for myself*. Yes, even when long term damage was the hot button topic. I've witnessed friends and family get weird long haul symptoms from other sicknesses, so it didnt strike me as odd that covid would have instances of that. However, there are at risk folks in my life who I *am* afraid of getting covid - and they will hopefully get vaccinated this month!

I've also had a lot of time to think about death/life and what it means so me this year. I'm not really afraid of death. I'm afraid of lying on my deathbed with regret though. I want to make the most out of life. I know I have it so much better than most, but damn it has been a tough year if you have that kind of outlook. Definitely feel like I'm failing myself at life sometimes :/

&gt;Post your sources

If I can jump in here...

Your argument is certainly sound, but the problem I have with it is context.  If what we're talking about are things like how can a specific office or school be open and how dollars should be allocated towards construction, renovation, or cleaning/maintenance, certainly the priority *by far* should be about the air.  I don't think anyone is denying that.

Now if an infected person coughs into their hands, shakes mine, and I wipe my eyes, nose, mouth without first washing them, am I taking a risk?  If an infected kid spit shines an apple before handing it to me and I go ahead and eat it, am I taking a risk?

When you're asking for the other commenter to post their sources, I think that's valid in a debate, but before I stop washing things or using hand sanitizer after I pump gas, I'd like to see data showing that Covid can not be transmitted via fomites, not that it's ""rare"", ""less likely"", ""reduced risk"", etc...

Oh, and I'd also like to see the data showing that no mutation of Covid could result in increased transmission capability through fomites.  I don't think that's possible.

FTFA:

Nobody, myself included, is demanding that any American willingly take the risk. Outside the Empire that sort of 'demand' would be recognized for what it is - a grand example of lack of morality. In the USA there is a surfeit of propaganda that says such selfishness quite OK in this as in many other ways. Because that attitude is so common in the USA Americans tend to suspect it of others who have no such idea in mind. Just like they leap to cough up the 'argument' about agendas and subtexts wshen someone else is merely presenting facts, facts they don't like. It's not the only strange thing about the American mentality and it's not universal, but it's very common. 

If you care to bother you can search my recent history for what I posted on the WHO's COVAX program which aims to protect everyone - whether they are blind to the **fact** that such a thing is necessary for their OWN protection as well or whether they are not. All that the USA has to do is repent of its recent few years of being a deadbeat and send MONEY NOT VACCINES. The COVAX program doesn't require a single vial being shipped to Burkino Faso or anywhere else. 

The inapplicable 'argument from hypocrisy' that you are trying to use in this case is ridiculously off the mark, AND it is, of course, a grand example of how collective responsibility has been erased from the daily consideration of Americans by constant propaganda promoting a distorted 'individualism'.  

That 'individualism' has the characteristic of an overabundance of *spite*. Americans are obsessed by a constant comparison of their situation to that of others, and they are overly willing to hurt themselves in order to hurt others whom they consider 'undeserving'. Often the 'undeserving' mutates into a fantasy that the good things that happen to others are actually brought about by taking the good things from them - *no matter how false and even ridiculous this is in reality*. But resentment becomes a way of life and even an unthinking reflex - no cerebral cortex required.

Their moderate-severe efficacy is in line with what was published by the other firms. Nothing about J&amp;J history or actions raise suspicion for alternative motives. The trial makes sense, the sample size is big enough, and they're presenting a straightforward case for the vaccine. So that's the number I'm comfortable with accepting until new evidence or data suggests otherwise. 

I'm sure SA is in the same boat and came to the same conclusion. J&amp;J's vaccine data presented an acceptable outcome (~57% at preventing moderate-severe). AZ's is most likely ineffective, and even given the best benefit of the doubt its unlikely to be better. The clearest conclusion drawn from the AZ data is that its inconclusive. 

When the data is inconclusive, you can't just cherry pick the parts you like (100% preventing severe) and throw away the parts you don't (10% efficacy for symptoms). If you err on the side of inconclusive, than the hospitalization prevention is also inconclusive. If you accept the numbers as they are, then it doesn't work satisfactorily for a major case you care about. 

I think the pharma firms are watching the situation seriously, that's why they're developing boosters and doing tests against the strain. It's pretty clear with the data presented that none of them will hit the 70%+ pandemic ending efficacy goal. 

As for public policy, we've already seen one country make a pretty serious leap of faith off technically high error inconclusive data.

The \*mRNA\* delivery method would not have that same complication.

\- I asked my mother, a chemistry phD, to read everything available on Moderna and Novavax manufacture and phase 1/2 trials. She wasn't at all excited about my volunteering but saw no issues as far as methods, delivery, probability of harm.

\- I live with a healthcare worker who I would like to protect even though she is too stupid to ever get vaccinated herself.  I would also like to protect myself from her.

The vast majority of people will probably only catch COVID once, but each individual will have varying degrees of severity of symptoms.

Ultimately, it comes down to viral load. If an individual inhales few virus particles, the body would be able to mount an immune response to suppress the virus quickly, and symptoms would probably be mild for this individual. Perhaps they have for some reason, pre-existing immunity that prevented them from experiencing severe symptoms. Another major factor is the quantity of ACE2 receptors an individual has in their body, which increases with age. As for the latter point, children experience mild to no symptoms because they have relatively few ACE2 receptors in their body.

In this sense, everyone who gets the virus can be considered infected, with symptoms ranging to none (i.e. asymptomatic carrier) to severe disease requiring hospitalization.

The AP biology answer, is that memory B cells directly correlate to antibody production. And it still does take a second viral infection to create a higher and longer lasting amount of those memory B cells for what we truly consider “immunity,” which also happens to correspond to higher concentrations of antibodies in the blood as well. 

covid is highly unpredictable in part because it can trigger the immune system to overreact in dangerous and sometimes deadly ways. I think most reinfections of covid are likely fairly mild cases just based on how rare diagnoses of reinfections occur (in the absence of the newer variants at least), which means the relatively lower concentration of memory B, preformed antibodies, and T cells are probably pretty good. but there’s been cases of people with more severe illness upon reinfection — I think in part due to those unfortunate overactive immune responses — that it’s better to get a vaccine even after covid recovery  to truly boost your antibodies and memory b/t cells to levels that prevent a secondary infection from establishing itself in the first place.",,,1612866252,{},gmon4py,False,t3_lfqi4t,False,True,t1_gmoidn2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfqi4t/modernas_covid19_vaccine_effective_against/gmon4py/,1612866262,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

If you're going to make a claim, you've got to source it my dude. Otherwise I'm just going to ignore it.

&gt;Also as someone who was involved in the design of a couple of clinical trials a long enough time ago, a pretty good rule of thumb was that if you’re clinical trials results are radically different than your lab data something usually went wrong. We would have been pretty hesitant to push something that has a totally unexplained affect in human trials that is directly contradictory to what lab data showed unless we could at least postulate why it was the case

There's lab data that shows a ~6-7x increase in antibodies required to reach neutralisation against the SA variant for both the Moderna/Pfizer vaccines in a test tube. So there's actually a lot of evidence they aren't going to work particularly well either. Source:

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.15.426911v1.full

Because the Moderna/Pfizer jabs induce a stronger immune response that the Oxford jab, there is a fair assumption that efficacy will be slightly higher. But how much higher? Who knows.

Truth is we don't know how effective even the Oxford jab is overall. There's a huge question mark over prevention of severe cases, and the efficacy in higher age groups. But at for the Moderna/Pfizer jabs there simply is no data yet. Taken from Pfizers own press release:

1. It jumped from animals in the wet market in Wuhan on humans
2. The lab in Wuhan. Possibly through someone breaching safety protocols, carelessness, or a simple human error.
3. A foreign government trying to destabilize China (and it going terribly wrong for the entire world). 
4. Powerful entities from around the world wanting to cause a crisis to implement their agenda to mask the imminent collapse of financial systems. 
5. It's simply a virus that existed in the animal world and jumped from them onto humans, unrelated from the wet markets and just found its way over there and it maybe didn't even start in Wuhan. (Probably the most likely thing that happened. A convoluted conspiracy seems as the most unlikely thing that happened. It's more likely that the virus started naturally of course and that China wanted to cover that up because they don't want to be responsible).

China also has had loads of time to cover things up. So I wonder how accurate this investigation can be. It's probably just gonna be a bunch of obvious revelations. ''So yeah, it's natural but we don't know where it came from specifically.'' Because duh, China had all the time in the world to cover things up. 

The virus is still here, no matter through what origins it went through. We still need to combat it through all the medical and lockdown measures we got worldwide. New medicine, vaccines, wearing masks etc. are all needed to get through this mess. There are still a lot of people that need to wake up and that's tragic as hell, a year into a Pandemic. Still calling it ''just a flu.'' I'm pro a new normal, but also against a new normal. It all depends on what kind of new normal comes after this. 

A new normal where we treat the planet better? Give people more tools to work on their health? Accessible healthcare worldwide? More focus on mental health and restructuring the way we approach work? Where we take measures against climate change and the high possibility of a new virus that breaks out because of how much we fuck with nature? Yes please, bring me to that new normal. A new normal were we just fuck around and corporations/governments/elite try to take advantage of the situation? That will be hard to swallow and if such a situation wasn't even the case, it would be a feeding ground for all kinds of destabilizing entities to take advantage of and make people think that was happening, while it wasn't.

I’m backing up everything that I say, but you’re so jumbled up with your echo chamber and “tHE MedIA” that you don’t seem to be able to think critically and see the difference of the scientific method playing out in real time as reputable scientists study these new variants, and the source isn’t “the media” , the media is just reporting it (and they are reputable sources that properly verify their information) it’s the universities doing these studies, and it ISN’T being presented as absolute, that is made clear (if you actually read the articles) they are forthcoming that these aren’t peer reviewed, and they are still testing. The POINT (there are those caps you don’t like, at least I can spell) is that these variants are mutating, getting stronger, and vaccines may not protect. Some people have already had these vaccines, data released like this early on let’s those people know we/they are NOT safe against these new variants just because they’ve had the vaccine.

## Abstract

COVID-19 patients may exhibit neuropsychiatric and neurological symptoms. Here we found that anxiety and cognitive impairment are manifested by 28-56% of COVID-19 convalescent individuals with mild respiratory symptoms and are associated with altered cerebral cortical thickness. Using an independent cohort, we found histopathological signs of brain damage in 25% of individuals who died of COVID-19. All of the affected brain tissues exhibited foci of SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication, particularly in astrocytes. We also found that neural stem cell-derived human astrocytes *in vitro* are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection through a mechanism that involves spike-NRP1 interaction. SARS-CoV-2-infected astrocytes manifested changes in energy metabolism and in key proteins and metabolites used to fuel neurons and in the biogenesis of neurotransmitters, and elicited a secretory phenotype that reduces neuronal viability. Our data support the model where SARS-CoV-2 reaches the brain, infects astrocytes and consequently leads to neuronal death or dysfunction. These processes are likely to contribute to the structural and functional alterations in the brain of COVID-19 patients.",,,1612900469,{},gmqg2uk,True,t3_lgbujp,False,True,t3_lgbujp,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lgbujp/sarscov2_infects_brain_astrocytes_of_covid19/gmqg2uk/,1612903833,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Or think of ways you can help struggling &amp; homeless foster adolescents who've aged out of government programs. Maybe an Americorps type of service program with free room &amp; board? Or how about targeting homeless college kids? Maybe set up incentives so that local alumni of their respective universities will add granny/mother-in-law additions to house them, rent-free.",,,1612900182,{},gmqfe4h,False,t3_lfxpir,False,True,t1_gmqayzj,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfxpir/daily_discussion_thread_february_09_2021/gmqfe4h/,1612903489,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

It took him months to recover from the worst of it. Now, almost a year later, he still has not fully recovered. He can no longer run or do strenuous workouts. He regularly sees a cardiologist and pulmonologist because of damage to his heart and lungs. While the heart damage isn't as bad, the lung damage appears to be permanent and pretty life-changing. He has cysts all over his lungs and significantly reduced lung function. 

And then there's my colleague who got COVID. Health 50-something woman, no health issues. While she largely physically recovered, she has been dealing with extreme fatigue and ""brain fog"" every since she was sick back in April. Her brain fog is so bad that she had to reduce her workload because she found she can't keep track of more than one project at a time.

However, my thought is that the same people who go to Superbowl events have likely also been meeting up for New Year, Christmas, Thanksgiving, and countless private backyard parties, so it's likely that a large percentage of them have already gotten COVID.

Quite commonly, when one member of a household gets sick, he/she gives it to everyone in the household, but only the most vulnerable (e.g. the elderly) get sick enough to require hospitalization. With vaccinations being prioritized for the elderly, it's possible that this group won't be as heavily impacted as before.

Finally, there's the fact that many people have been strictly isolating throughout the pandemic. As long as they continue their previous course I don't expect their risks to go up. But what I worry is that a subset of them will get careless and unnecessarily expose themselves, and the damage can be quite severe because most members of this group hasn't been exposed to COVID in the same way that members of the more reckless group has been.

&gt; The vast majority of the city in which the Brazilian variant emerged already had recovered from covid, and thus had antibodies. Despite this, there is currently a large reinfection rate in Manaus.

&gt; This may be due to waning antibodies in the population, but it may also be due to the new variant there being resistant to these antibodies [(1)](https://amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/617891/), [(2)](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/01/new-coronavirus-variants-could-cause-more-reinfections-require-updated-vaccines). While the possibility of the Brazilian variant being resistant to natural antibodies is still being explored, the confirmed increased infectivity is the primary concern of experts [(2)](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/01/new-coronavirus-variants-could-cause-more-reinfections-require-updated-vaccines).

&gt; This reinfection by a new variant in individuals who've recovered from the original strain is a very real risk with the South African variant [(3)](https://www.newsweek.com/dr-fauci-south-africa-covid-variant-reinfect-recovered-1566097?amp=1). It's reasonable to assume this may continue to happen as more variants emerge.

&gt; Furthermore, the more cases of covid (regardless of variant), the more opportunity for further mutations and new variants to emerge [(4)](https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-mutations-rising-f471eca388965ee95cd1e324c4e239d8).

This isn't what is being done here though  It's not about trying to make the case for AZ, I don't think it should be used in SA given the data.  And whilst I think Novavax, Moderna or pfizer would be superior I'm not trying to cheerlead them either.  It's just not at all clear that J&amp;J is *really* '60%' protective vs AZs ""10%"" and those numbers keep getting thrown around as if they're concrete without a solid grasp of the limitations behind how either or those numbers were calculated. 

I'm not the only one that's pointed this out either, here's a prominent scientist touching on it. 

https://mobile.twitter.com/EricTopol/status/1358574806409515008

 we can't compare study results against mild disease with results against only moderate to severe unless the criteria is suitably matched. In this case it's not enough.  


Ultimately there's a reason J&amp;J has chosen to limit it's efficacy coverage to moderate to severe, and why this press release doesn't talk about how It will protect against mild it doesn't take  sherlock holmes leveI of deduction to work out why.

If the numbers were compared like for like, same criteria, with adequate sample size we'd expect to see closer similarities given the wide CI and that 2/3rds of cases in the AZ study were mild

&gt; As far as I'm concerned, my mental buckets are 70%+ (ends the pandemic), 70-40% (good enough to use in the meantime if nothing better is available), and &lt;40% (start planning a pivot to a different approach asap).

I agree with you about the % figures you express and their impact on the pandemic,  but the point I'm trying to say here is that's J&amp;J is likely *not* '57%' protective against SA variant compared with 10% of AZ which may change the calculation of whether or not its really such a good decision vs alternatives  . Now it could be that the calculation still ends up in J&amp;J's favor vs alternatives  but  it doesn't seem as cut and dry as presented on reddit,  and I'm curious as to whether this decision was implemented mostly because there isn't a more viable option and it's more palatable (many in SA won't want to even take AZ after the news, pretty much neccesitating a shift regardless )  is this partially papering over cracks or is the science really strongly supportive J&amp;J is the best candidate to immunize the people? 

yes, you're right as armchair analysts we won't get too specific granular data but  by repeating on the back of such limited published data that one vaccine is horribly ineffective whilst the other is quite effective, despite them otherwise having similar results against ancestral strain I fear we are not scrutinizing this situation properly and it's something that can affect the world. I want SA to get the best protection possible, and the rest the world benefit from seeing if this variant problem is surmountable.

If you actually understood the history you’d know that Singapore only became a wealthy country as of pretty recently. It was able to achieve so much because of government investment in economically mobilising sectors such as education and social infrastructure. Anyone who’s spent any time there would know how homogenised the culture is in regards to prioritising education, health, and diversity — which is a cornerstone in Singaporean policy. 

Your mistake is in thinking that Singapore had it easier than other “real” countries with “significant chunks of impoverished areas” rather than as a country that effectively managed to pretty much eradicate poverty within their own society in a matter of decades. Remember, Singapore was a British colony before it was ravaged by WWII, then separated from Malaysia — which despite being part of the same land mass is nowhere near as developed. Look into HDB housing programs, the different government subsidy programs, the free world class public schools. It isn’t just a country full of rich people, it’s a country that helped its citizens become rich through effective governing policy DESPITE not being able to produce any commodities to export on their own. All these factors produced a cause and effect of Singapore honing in on professional expertise and service, which THEN lead them to be a global financial powerhouse and trading station. Look into Hong Kong’s history prior to 1997 and you’ll find much the same. 

I’m not sure why you so strongly believe the US is a paragon for melting pot of cultures when you’ve clearly never been anywhere truly international. I am a dual citizen, have lived in multiple countries around the world, with family across different continents and spanning multiple nationalities (immigrant life for you), and I can tell you you are wrong. While the old US adage of being a country built on immigration is nice, the sad reality is that racial ignorance and divisiveness in this country is appalling. People of colour are treated as second rate citizens here compared to Caucasian immigrants. The melting pot may be true for immigrants of polish, German, British descent who get to call themselves American, but everyone else is relegated to hyphenate. Most people in America only speak one language (and not very well at that), which is even worse when you consider that that status quo is enforced by people who consider speaking anything other than English to be offensive. In comparison, most other countries I’ve lived in have predominantly bilingual or trilingual populations, even the poor ones. 

But the worst is your belief that there is repeated, extensive cultural mixing here. You want to know what kind of “extensive cultural mixing” my parents got when they first immigrated into this country in the 80’s? In progressive California no less? How many times they were refused service for speaking Chinese, or being “yellow”? How many times they were spat at for just existing? You mention black and white Americans, but somehow you neglect to acknowledge that other minorities exist in this paradigm. Cultural coexistence does not equate to “cultural mixing,” especially when animosity exists. Learning about other cultures together alongside people of other cultures, fostering respect and understanding of other cultures isn’t a trivial or superficial endeavour. Don’t put down the importance of “learning about other cultures in school” when you clearly don’t understand the importance of it, although why would you, it isn’t even offered in the US.",,,1612855593,{},gmobxnb,False,t3_lezwyq,False,True,t1_gmo6snu,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lezwyq/culturally_tight_societies_like_singapore_fare/gmobxnb/,1612855604,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Of course I have to ask where the N-glycosated Asn's are located.. are they evenly distributed throughout, or are they mainly in RBD?  I'm guessing RBD.

The other thing that stood out from prior articles you linked was that the coronavirus is the longest RNA positive-sense genome.. period.  Do you think that length of ~27kb makes it more mutable?  The analogy I have is that a V12 engine (DNA) and straight 6 engine (RNA) have equally long crank shafts, which happen to be the longest found in civilian cars.  Each shaft is subject to a similar degree of twist, but the V12 runs much more smoothly because any errors are balanced and also distributed across a larger number of cylinders, meaning more stability.  Does the long RNA length naturally lend to more ""twist""?

Never said that. Didn't use the past tense at all. Not remotely relevant to anything I said.

Rich micronations like Singapore (or Luxembourg, etc.) simply do not exist without the patronage of real nations. This isn't a value judgement; just an observation--do they grow enough food to feed themselves? Do they quarry the steel from their own lands to build those skyscrapers? No, no they do not. They are ultimately dependent on the vast lower classes toiling away in other countries.  

For that reason, your endless attempts to shame the USA about issues involving its lower classes is ironic. Irrelevant to what I was saying, but deeply and profoundly ironic.

&gt;Most people in America only speak one language

And there you go, displaying your ignorance  and nonsensical take on this for all to see.  

A common language (spoken at home, not just in the public sphere) is the **cornerstone** of the melting pot. This isn't a value judgement; it's a fact. (You're free to believe the melting pot model is inferior if you wish, but this is still a fact.)

Separatist, respectful multiculturalism, as practiced in many other countries, is not the same as the melting pot.  Singapore is more of separatist philosophy and less of the melting pot, in comparison to the USA. (Though less so than other countries I could think of.)

Multicultural systems where each language is respected and held up as equal, like say Quebec-Canada or the former union of Czechia and Slovakia, are obviously NOT conducive to the melting pot.

Again, you can consider that bad or good but it's just a fact.  It's extremely obvious that emphasizing and respecting the differences between cultures and having less of a motivation to converge on a common language (for home as well as school/work) results in less cultural mixing and often/eventually separatist sentiments. It's happened again and again and again, particularly in Europe. Though those separatist feelings are much less likely to arise under prosperity or authoritarianism... so Singapore is undoubtedly safe from that.

The rest of it is just race-baiting virtue signal crap that has nothing whatsoever to do with what I'm talking about. (Oh yeah and you claim studying other cultures ""isn't even offered"" in American schools, ahaha. That's just Russia-level propaganda there.

The 1st paper is mostly devoted to proving the nasal administration of this vaccine provides sterilizing immunity. It almost barely compares IM injection vs IN. The data it does produce shows a difference in IgA and apparently detected virus (I was not able to determine what they were talking about there as I looked at their figures 3x and do not see the data they are talking about). The vast majority of this paper also seeks to establish IN vaccination and barely looks at IM vs IN. Also maybe a 10E10 viral exposure illicits a response that allows some replication of the virus in a IM vaccinated individual. That doesn't really convince me though because A) that's an unnaturally high exposure B) it doesn't really look at if the virus is actively replicating or not C) it doesn't look at if the virus was alive or what level or virus the people were expelling.

For example, ignore covid altogether.  Person A has breast cancer, eventually dies in hospital from pneumonia.  Both are important.   It should count as both a pneumonia death and a breast cancer death.

It’s not weird/dodgy for the same thing to happen with covid.   It’s how you find links.   If people with covid are more susceptible to dying of sudden strokes, we can only prove that if their cause of death mentions both stroke and covid.

Their argument is then usually “but they died in a car crash?! It’s obviously not related!!!”   But it could be.  Took cold meds then operated heavy machinery.   Or had a coughing fit behind the wheel.  Including covid on the death certificate could help researchers see whether driving is a risk.   It’s probably not a big one, but how can you tell unless you have a way to count?

The next argument is probably “okay, but what if it there wasn’t a link, the car crash was absolutely non-related, and they’re still counted as a covid death”.   Yeah.

600k people over 18 months sounds like a lot but in a normal year pre-covid, 300-350k people die in nursing homes, 30-60k die from the flu, and about 2800k people die from all causes. So 600k sounds like a lot but needs to be kept in perspective. Statistically during any 18 month period, 488k people will die in nursing homes on average from non-Covid causes (infection, sepsis, etc).

I have never understood how anyone thinks that the fatalities are counted even remotely accurately, and that could be either high or low. It is a new disease that no doctor had ever seen before and the people who die have on average 3 other serious comorbidities (cancer, heart disease, diabetes, etc).

We can use testing, tracing and quarantine to eliminate community spread in the US.

\[...\]BioNTech said in October that it's vaccines for China's market would be manufactured entirely in Germany, but BioNTech told *Fortune* that's only the case for BioNTech's first vaccine shipment to China. Starting with the second shipment, BioNTech will send vaccine materials to Fosun to ""fill and finish,"" meaning Fosun will fill the vials and package the vaccines for distribution. Both companies told *Fortune* that Fosun may eventually manufacture the vaccine start to finish in China\[...\]

I doubt BNT will ship 100 mil from Marburg in the first shipment.

&gt;All doses from Pfizer/BT production facilities in the US, stay in the US... all doses from AZ production facilites in the UK, stay in the UK...all doses from the new Fosun production facility stay in China, so that's not true. 

I was implying their Belgium facility, not the one in US.

&gt;But if they get even less than 75 m out of 250 m from Marburg, that's even worse. 

BNT hasn't disclosed anything about Marburg apart from a rough estimation of 250 mil per Q. Once production starts, I'm sure we'll get some accurate estimations, BNT is so far really careful/ conservative with their estimations, maybe to avoid things that happened with AZ &amp; EU. Again Math doesn't really add up if BNT doesn't supply more doses to EU from Marburg.

There is no indication ""herd immunity"" is going to be reached in the next few months, or what that threshold even is.  Even with theoretical herd immunity there are localized outbreaks/illness/hospitalization, additionally so because you run into issues of vaccine uptake, and vaccines for children.

So, I'm not sure what your argument is besides a ""wait a few months!"" - that's a poor message, and one that's not rooted in any discrete milestones for health.

1. Reform Society

We can reform society to be technologically-oriented, with all work being done online for the rest of our lives. Things like grocery stores would turn into grocery distribution centers, with drivers delivering food directly to homes. Masks would never be needed, since people would almost never leave their homes in the first place. There would be no more dating, no concerts, no movie theaters, nothing that requires being physically close with strangers for an extended length of time. Life as we know it would be completely changed forever.

This would never actually happen, ever, but it IS one of the options.

2. Open Everything Up

The deadliest of the options, this involves throwing caution to the wind and restoring 2019 normals immediately. Millions would die in the deadliest single event since World War 2, and again, it would never happen, but it's another option.

3. Vaccine Whack-a-Mole!

This is by far the most likely option right now, and it looks like this is actually what's going to happen. We'll reopen partially, and then get stuck for many years on critical issues such as masks, indoor dining, and concerts because of the variants. And because new variants will keep mutating infinitely, new vaccines will have to be developed every few months to a year to respond to said new variants. Ideally in a pill format, since people will get tired of shots every few months. Very slowly, the cases will start to drift down, and the time span between variants will begin to widen. In 3 to 5 years time, or possibly even 10, cases will be low enough, tracing will be good enough, and sequencing will be fast enough to reopen and keep close checks on any potential new variants. There might be a few more year long lockdowns after that to tie up any loose ends.

4. Miracle Breakthrough

This is what you refer to when you say people on here ""so blindly push your head into the sand in regards to these variants"". They're hoping that the current vaccine will be able to keep up with the variants, so we can fully return to normal with minimal loss of life by summer.

A lot of people who were reporting symptoms were looked at for a lot of other potential factors like post-viral syndrome, PTSD, or were simply ignored because their symptoms didn't seem particularly dangerous.

Some of the other variants, like the ones in South Africa and Brazil, present theoretical problems to the United States for many months in the future.  The B117 variant, however, presents a fairly credible threat in the immediate future.

Does that mean we are doomed? Absolutely not. Many experts agree that if the US maintains its current behaviors and continues to vaccinate on schedule, the cumulative benefits of vaccination should outweigh the increased transmissibility before the B117 variant can become prevalent enough to cause another large wave of cases.

There! Cherry picking argument solved. Florida sits somewhere in the middle of the list, South Dakota sits somewhere closer to the top. Of course there are multiple variables at play here my guy, but I'm just talking about one: **lockdowns**, and there doesn't seem to be much of a correlation between locked-down states and non locked-down states in terms of the spread of the virus. Therefore, I would much rather trade say California that is heavily locked down for Florida that isn't locked down and suffer the same consequences from the virus according to just the numbers.",,,1612829972,{},gmn52kd,False,t3_lf744r,False,True,t1_gmn22bl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lf744r/daily_discussion_thread_february_08_2021/gmn52kd/,1612832526,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt; 611 cases of the B.1.1.7 variant first identified in the United Kingdom, which research suggests is both more transmissible, potentially more deadly, and possibly less susceptible to vaccines than earlier variants of the virus;

&gt; Five cases of the B.1.351 variant first identified in South Africa, which research suggest is more transmissible and less susceptible to vaccines than earlier variants of the virus; and

&gt; Two cases of the P.1 variant first identified in Brazil, which research suggest is more transmissible and less susceptible to vaccines than earlier variants of the virus.

Let's address this piece by piece.

""Suggests"" is a term that scientists use when something looks like it *might* go in one direction but more information is needed.

So if you're going to post this to fearmonger about the rise of new variants (which I know is what you're doing. I recognize your username, you've been posting links here fairly often that all have the agenda of ""variants will prolong this, get used to it.""), then you have to agree that [some of the data is suggesting that Moderna is effective against the U.K. variant \(B.1.1.7\)](https://www.news-medical.net/news/20210208/Modernas-COVID-9-vaccine-effective-against-emerging-variants.aspx), and that it's not worth fearmongering over yet. And I've found studies that say Pfizer works against the UK variant as well.

There's also data suggesting that [Moderna is effective against B.1.351 \(South Africa\)](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-retains-neutralizing-activity-against). And I've found studies that say Pfizer works against the South African variant as well.

Vaccines are being offered to all.  If you don't trust the vaccine being delivered to your community is the same as being delivered to a white community, simply go to the white community to get your vaccine.

I've been really hard on myself lately about trying to host a wedding in June. Looks like our venue is giving us agreeable parameters, so the only thing holding me up is the social pressure (will I get ostracized from society for having a wedding? Etc). So in the most recent call I had with a couple friend groups, I asked - ""how would you guys feel about us having a somewhat normal-ish wedding?""

The response was really supportive. And these are some of the most covid-cautious people in my life - most of them live in the bay area. They agreed that we already took a lot of steps to make things safer (postponing, outdoor, spaced tables plated food, etc) and that postponing again would probably be a disproportionate amount of hassle. Some of them can get a little gloomy, but they even sent me links to articles about vaccinations ramping up and were being optimistic for me. It was really sweet.

I think the reason you're getting so many comments about postponing again is because you have twice already. Once we spread the word that we are doing June and we will tweak it as needed to work, the comments on postponing stopped. Now we get more comments from people saying that our wedding is the one thing that have to look forward too. Like a beacon of light at the (hopefully close to) end. 

I agree with the poster below, at this point, if people come, they come. If they don't, they don't. You postponed twice already, you're doing the best you can. But also you do you - people tell other couples what they should do with their wedding wayyyyy too often. But that's a tale as old as time lol.

As we saw with cruise ships early in the pandemic that sort of environment is a recipe for very high rates of transmission.

&gt; If you want to compare mild to mild, you're comparing 1 symptom J&amp;J against 2 symptom AZ (AZ doesn't have track 1 symptom which would fall below their mild rating).

Agree with the jist of your comment about overlapping criteria and different words for more or less similar things,   however we can see above cough OR fever **alone** in the AZ study is enough to qualify as mild, (see twitter screenshot attached to above post) 

also we can consider perhaps a smaller point, that symptoms aligning with suspected reactogenecity in J&amp;J trial had discretion of not being forwarded for PCR test for a period of days.  Of course that would exclude more covid specific symptoms like cough or loss of taste/smell, but for simple fatigue, headache it's more likely to miss some cases in vaccine arm. The study was blinded , but placebo was saline in J&amp;J,  not AZ. j&amp;J had a criteria for mild in study protocol,  but it's not something we have seen measured or have access too. 

&gt; So I would say moderate+ J&amp;J is comparable to mild+ AZ. If regulators have raw individual data, they should be able to compare the two.

They do, we won't see raw data but I hope some subset of this data that gives us better breakdown of symptoms  will come up in the FDA review minutes to the public",,,1612847478,{},gmo1a12,False,t3_lfqv6b,False,True,t1_gmnt5y4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfqv6b/south_africa_to_start_covid19_vaccinations_with/gmo1a12/,1612847505,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt; Dr. Charles Chiu, a virologist and professor of laboratory medicine at UCSF who, in concert with state authorities, has been genetically sequencing test samples to identify new variants said early indications are the CAL.20C might be less susceptible to the currently approved vaccines, but more investigation is needed.

&gt; “This variant carries three mutations, including L452R, in the spike protein, which the virus uses to attach to and enter cells, and is the target of the two vaccines that are currently available in the United States,” said Dr. Chiu. A spike protein mutation could, then, interfere with the vaccine’s efficacy. Given that spike protein’s importance, L452R is another name sometimes used for the West Coast Variants.

&gt; Asked about vaccine resistance, Ghaly was more circumspect saying he was, “Unclear about its exact role in either making people sicker or its impact on things like vaccine.”

&gt; The West Coast Variants also have been detected in Los Angeles, Mono, Monterey, Orange, Riverside, San Francisco, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Luis Obispo, Humboldt and Lake counties. Because genomic sequencing is sparse, it is currently unknown exactly how prevalent L452 is statewide, nationally or globally.

&gt; Dr. Chiu said L452R grew from about 3.8% of the samples he tested in late November 2020 through early December to more than 25.2% in late December through early January 2021.

...

&gt; At the beginning of January, the state had administered over 30 million Covid-19 tests. Of those tens of millions, only about 7,000 had been analyzed genomically, according to the San Jose Mercury News. It should be said that the nation as a whole is **woefully behind** in such analyses.

Seems we understand why California exploded in cases. Sadly, we continue to make light of the importance of sequencing in the US as a whole.

The President is supposed to be a trusted authority. When any President makes fun of their own guidelines around, say, masks and suggests completely untested cures those claims have added weight because of their position. They are coming from someone that should be trusted. It makes the lie that much more effective.

Our huge challenge going forward is to put a lid on rhetoric like this because it has very dangerous outcomes and we're seeing how it affects the country and is literally leading to unnecessary deaths.

Overall, 20 percent of the COVID-19 patients were found to have blood clots in the veins, and among patients in the intensive care unit, that statistic increased to 31 percent. Blood clots in the vein, or deep vein thrombosis, can reach the lungs and develop into pulmonary embolism, resulting in higher risk of death.   https://health.ucsd.edu/news/releases/Pages/2020-11-23-study-covid-19-infection-combined-with-blood-clots-worsen-patient-outcomes.aspx#:~:text=Overall%2C%2020%20percent%20of%20the,in%20higher%20risk%20of%20death.

&gt; The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has made deployment of an effective vaccine a global health priority. We evaluated the protective activity of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine encoding a prefusion stabilized spike protein (ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S) in challenge studies with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and mice expressing the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Intramuscular dosing of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces robust systemic humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and protects against lung infection, inflammation, and pathology but does not confer sterilizing immunity, as evidenced by detection of viral RNA and induction of anti-nucleoprotein antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In contrast, a single intranasal dose of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces high levels of neutralizing antibodies, promotes systemic and mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) and T cell responses, and almost entirely prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Intranasal administration of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S is a candidate for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission and curtailing pandemic spread.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7437481/

&gt; The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for effective preventive vaccination to reduce burden and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in humans. Intranasal vaccination is an attractive strategy to prevent COVID-19 as the nasal mucosa represents the first-line barrier to SARS-CoV-2 entry before viral spread to the lung. Although SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development is rapidly progressing, the current intramuscular vaccines are designed to elicit systemic immunity without conferring mucosal immunity. Here, we show that AdCOVID, an intranasal adenovirus type 5 (Ad5)-vectored vaccine encoding the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, elicits a strong and focused immune response against RBD through the induction of mucosal IgA, serum neutralizing antibodies and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with a Th1-like cytokine expression profile. Therefore, AdCOVID, which promotes concomitant systemic and local mucosal immunity, represents a promising COVID-19 vaccine candidate.

The other poster is correct that IM vaccines don't produce sterilizing musocal immunity.  And it just isn't expected based on what immune response happens after an IM jab, the antigens aren't going to be taken up to the upper respiratory tract to form immunity there.  People will get infected, some will get symptomatic, there will certainly be some level of transmission.

I'd add the word ""negligible"" though which I think might be what the other poster is missing.",,,1612851058,{},gmo6f8q,False,t3_lff1cw,False,True,t1_gmnku0o,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lff1cw/ron_wright_republican_congressman_dies_after/gmo6f8q/,1612851069,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Some assumptions first: that the OP is in the United States and that they are under the age of 54.

Dividing covid deaths/cases in the states gives about a 1.71% death rate. These numbers are obtained using Google's numbers that are posted with the embedded plots that come up when you search ""covid cases united states"". These are the least nuanced numbers that you can get.

Using data obtained here: https://www.heritage.org/data-visualizations/public-health/covid-19-deaths-by-age/ we can determine that 93% of those 1.71% of deaths occurred in people 55+ years of age. 

So this means that if you're below 55 you can bank on a 1.71*(1-0.93)% chance of death. That's 0.11% - one in one thousand. Of course, people are dying of this. Statistically though, if you're below the age of 55 and have taken good care of yourself, you're probably fine. I apologize if this sounds insensitive, and I want to reiterate that you truly do have my condolences for your loved one who passed away, but the stats are the stats and I'd rather tell someone that they have little to be concerned about based on hard numbers than tell them that they do have something to worry about based on anecdotes.",,,1612826627,{},gmmyiny,False,t3_lf744r,False,False,t1_gmmt3m1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lf744r/daily_discussion_thread_february_08_2021/gmmyiny/,1612829450,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

&gt;The country was scrambling Monday to come up with a new vaccination strategy after it halted use of the AstraZeneca vaccine — which is cheaper and easier to handle than some others and which many had hoped would be crucial to combatting the pandemic in developing countries. Among the possibilities being considered: mixing the AstraZeneca vaccine with another one or giving Johnson &amp; Johnson’s single-dose vaccine, which has not yet been authorized for use anywhere, to 100,000 health care workers while monitoring its efficacy against the variant.

&gt;The abrupt change in strategy was prompted by preliminary results in a small study that showed the AstraZeneca vaccine was only minimally effective against mild to moderate cases of the disease caused by the variant.

&gt;There is reason to hope the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine may fare better in the country. Initial results from an international test of the vaccine showed it is 57% effective in South Africa at preventing moderate to severe COVID-19. That was less than in other countries — the rate was 72% in the U.S., for example — presumably due to the worrisome variant. It was even more effective — 85% internationally — at preventing the most serious symptoms.

&gt;“We can’t wait. We already have good local data,” said Dr. Glenda Gray, director of the South Africa Medical Research Council, who led the South African part of the global trial. She stressed that clinical trials show that the J&amp;J vaccine is safe. Like AstraZeneca’s, it is also easier to handle than the super-frozen vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna.

&gt;South Africa appears to be heeding her call. She said the country is making urgent plans to “roll it out and evaluate it in the field.”

&gt;South Africa’s inoculation strategy is being watched globally because the variant first detected and now dominant here is spreading in more than 30 countries. Officials say this form of the virus is more contagious, and evidence is emerging that it may be more virulent; recent studies have also shown it can infect people who have survived the original form of the virus.

&gt;After a second surge, cases and deaths in South Africa have begun to fall recently, but it is still battling one of Africa’s most severe outbreaks, with more than 46,000 deaths. It is worried that another spike will come in May or June, when the Southern Hemisphere country heads into its winter.

&gt;“Our scientists must get together and quickly figure out what approach we’re going to use,” Health Minister Zweli Mhkize said Sunday night, announcing the suspension of the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is currently the only one available in South Africa. Deliveries of others, including the one made by Pfizer and BioNTech, are expected soon.

&gt;The suspension threw South Africa’s vaccination plans into disarray just one week after the country received its first 1 million doses of the vaccine. It came after the early results of a small clinical trial showed that the shot offered only minimal protection against mild to moderate cases of COVID-19 in young adults, according to an announcement by the University of Witwatersrand, which conducted the test.

&gt;The AstraZeneca study involved 2,000 healthy volunteers with a median age of 31. Scientists generally like to see larger studies before drawing conclusions, and experts say the vaccine may still prevent severe disease — and that would go a long way in slowing the pandemic and avoiding hospitals from becoming overwhelmed with patients.

&gt;“Vaccines that are effective against the more severe forms of disease may not affect milder forms, so there is optimism that severe disease will still be prevented by vaccines,” said Peter Openshaw, a professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London.

&gt;But the results were disappointing enough that South African officials decided to postpone the rollout of the vaccine, which was supposed to be given to front-line healthcare workers starting in mid-February.

&gt;The preliminary study has not been peer-reviewed — the gold standard in scientific studies — but was still “a reality check,” said Professor Shabir Madhi, who conducted the trial. “We were euphoric. We must recalibrate our expectations.”

&gt;Now, the country is looking to switch gears. It may end up continuing with giving at least one dose of AstraZeneca in the hope it will protect against severe disease and death from the variant. It is also considering combining the shot with one from another vaccine. Most of the vaccines being tested require two doses; Johnson &amp; Johnson is an exception.

&gt;An experimental study began last week in Britain testing whether doctors could safely mix and match doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine with the shot made by Pfizer.

&gt;An added complication is that the AstraZeneca doses in South Africa have an April expiration date, making it difficult to administer two doses within such a short period.

&gt;Last week, Sarah Gilbert of Oxford University, who helped develop the AstraZeneca vaccine, said researchers were currently working to tweak their vaccine by inserting a genetic sequence from the new variant.

&gt;South African experts have been conducting clinical trials on the effects of the variant, known as B.1.351. That variant quickly became more than 90% dominant here.

&gt;The variant has reduced the level of protection offered by virtually all the vaccines, but most vaccines show satisfactory efficacy in protecting against severe cases and death caused by the version, said Madhi. Trials of the Novavax vaccine, for instance, showed diminished but still good protection against the variant, he said.

&gt;“It is not all doom and gloom … we do have vaccines that work,” said Madhi.

&gt;Still, he added, “This virus is likely to be with us for the course of our lifetimes. It is unlikely that it will be eradicated soon.”",,,1612854745,{},gmoay48,False,t3_lfftz6,False,True,t1_gmlu5va,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfftz6/s_africa_seeks_new_vaccine_plan_after_halting/gmoay48/,1612854756,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The seriousness of COVID, the impact it will have, questions regarding variants and mutations, questions regarding re-infection, questions regarding children being able to catch and spread covid, the potential benefits of masks.... yet all along a positive spin has been put. Any articles with more negative outcomes, any article questioning for instance re-infection, have been down voted as were articles giving support to closing schools. All this has led to over half a million deaths and counting. By far the worst outcome of any country. People pushing a more  positive outcome just because they want it to end and they want to 'go back to doing whatever they were in the manner that they were ' before covid came along.

Vaccines are another one of those subjects. Not the conspiracy theorist, chipping people, controlling people narrative but rather any narrative that does not support the idea that vaccines will come along and then it will all be quickly over. What about the narrative that it may well be some quite substantial timeframe before the full effects of vaccines can be seen in the impact of covid on our daily lives. Maybe we will have to continue wearing masks even after being vaccinated? Maybe mutations will arise requiring further vaccine development? 

If people really want to reduce the impact of covid on their lives then they need to start assuming some responsibility and through careful measures slowly reduce the risk drip by drip. That there are 25 million cases in the US is giving 25 million opportunities for development of mutation. 

But that's not going to happen. We want the problem to go away. We are not willing to accept any responsibility. We want it to be magically disappeared so that we can go back to our normal lives. In the meantime we can blame the WHO, blame the Chinese, blame our governments, blame out neighbors, blame the scientists, blame the Brazilians, or South Africans or British.

It felt like the worst flu I've ever had and lasted a couple days, but no comparison at all to the hell I went through with covid.

I'd hate for someone that had a severe case to be scared away from the vaccine because they expect it to feel like what they went through with the disease.

Still worried about variants? Check [this out!](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/01/27/vaccination-against-the-new-variants-real-world-data) *

Ignore news stories or blogs or comments that use “strain” instead of “variant”.  [There are currently no Covid19 “strains”, only variants.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC8ObD2W4Rk)

Many variants aren't that great at being viruses.  [Some have already gone extinct](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/19/danish-covid-mink-variant-very-likely-extinct-but-controversial-cull-continues).

Reinfections are rare, but some studies show [less than 1 in 1,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kyj0bx/sarscov2_reinfection_in_a_cohort_of_43000/) (maybe in the 1 in 10,000 range).  Reinfections tend to be much milder than previous infections, even those new variants. 

Milder cases, especially asymptomatic cases [are worse at spreading the virus](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kcy2e0/weekly_question_thread_week_of_december_14/gg8tp7n/).  

Speculation time: Say you get vaccinated and then get one of the variants, what happens? Well, you probably don't have symptoms, or if you do they're mild.  And your immune system just learned how to deal with another swath of potential variants, probably for a long time, if not forever.

Multiple [studies using monkeys](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03041-6) show both strong immunity, or [sterilizing immunity](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/la4fud/immunogenic_bnt162b_vaccines_protect_rhesus/) from multiple vaccine types.  

Immunity from the vaccine is [comparable to](https://www.verywellhealth.com/antibodies-from-vaccines-and-from-natural-infection-5092564), or even [considerably better than](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l5whhu/increased_resistance_of_sarscov2_variants_b1351/) immunity from a previous infection.

Immunity from clearing an infection lasts [*at least 8 months*](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/koxkm1/sarscov2_infection_induces_longlived_bone_marrow/), though [probably a lot longer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/klpvp7/sarscov2specific_t_cell_memory_is_longlasting_in/)  Again, [*at least* 8 months, though you may not even really need very many antibodies,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ldj06f/immunological_memory_to_sarscov2_assessed_for_up/) duration of immunity is looking pretty stellar, since other types of immunity seem to be driving the bus.  It's too soon to say ""lifelong"" but [that is a possibility.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l4nkco/the_immune_system_mounts_a_lasting_defense_after/) Also, it looks like those who have recovered *may* only need [one dose of an mRNA vaccine](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/labst4/robust_spike_antibody_responses_and_increased/). There are some people who don't develop lasting immunity from infections. 

Immunity from the vaccine [lasts *at least 6 months*,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/l9nfu8/stable_neutralizing_antibody_levels_six_months/) probably a lot,[ lot longer,](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/k6a6pq/durability_of_responses_after_sarscov2_mrna1273/)  probably many years. 

The OG SARS virus, the one from 2003, gave detectable immunity [both 6](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/186/12/7264) and [12 years later.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kvbz9y/weekly_question_thread/gizs32j/)   

Covid19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, OG SARS was caused by SARS-CoV. Looks like both of them came from bats.  [They’re 79% the same.](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2930251-8) (PDF)

It's just a quite plausible and mundane way for a bat from a remote cave to find its way to the middle of a city, and I remain skeptical of the motives of the people who continually refuse to entertain it as even remotely plausible, but instead appear determined to explore far more complex theories. 

If you find a high amount of radiation laying around on the ground, and you're right next to a reactor, the first theory you're chase is not going to be the one where a unique natural confluence pushed it out of the ground.

No, you're first going to be looking for holes in the reactor. It's right fucking there. The most likely place it came from was in *there*. Then the question is how did it get from in *there* to out *here*. So you get to work investigating the most obvious possibility to prove or **rule it out.**

Having your head investigator swear black and blue that it was more likely to have emerged from a faraway deposit and travelled naturally along an underground river before being leeched by sunflowers just seems really fucking shady.

[],,chilladipa,,,[],,,,text,t2_6z8harzu,False,False,[],"MISSION, Kan. (AP) — Mortuary owner Brian Simmons has been making more trips to homes to pick up bodies to be cremated and embalmed since the pandemic hit.

With COVID-19 devastating communities in Missouri, his two-person crews regularly arrive at homes in the Springfield area and remove bodies of people who decided to die at home rather than spend their final days in a nursing home or hospital where family visitations were prohibited during the pandemic.

He understands all too well why people are choosing to die at home: His own 49-year-old daughter succumbed to the coronavirus just before Christmas at a Springfield hospital, where the family only got phone updates as her condition deteriorated.

""The separation part is really rough, rough rough,"" said Simmons. ""My daughter went to the hospital and we saw her once through the glass when they put her on the ventilator, and then we never saw her again until after she died.""

Across the country, terminally ill patients — both with COVID-19 and other diseases — are making similar decisions and dying at home rather than face the terrifying scenario of saying farewell to loved ones behind glass or during video calls.

""What we are seeing with COVID is certainly patients want to stay at home,"" said Judi Lund Person, the vice president for regulatory compliance at the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization. ""They don't want to go to the hospital. They don't want to go to a nursing home.""

National hospice organizations are reporting that facilities are seeing double-digit percentage increases in the number of patients being cared for at home.

The phenomenon has played out Carroll Hospice in Westminster, Maryland, which has seen a 30% to 40% spike in demand for home-based care, said executive director Regina Bodnar. She said avoiding nursing homes and coronavirus risks are the biggest factor behind the increase.""

Lisa Kossoudji, who supervises nurses at Ohio's Hospice of Dayton, pulled her own mother, now 95, out of assisted living and brought her home to live with her after the pandemic hit. She had gone weeks without seeing her mother and was worried that her condition was deteriorating because she was being restricted to her room as the facility sought to limit the potential for the virus to spread.

Her mother, who has a condition that causes thickening and hardening of the walls of the arteries in her brain, is now receiving hospice services. Kossoudji is seeing the families she serves make similar choices.

""Lots of people are bringing folks home that physically, they have a lot physical issues, whether it is they have a feeding tube or a trachea, things that an everyday lay person would look at and say, 'Oh my gosh, I can't do this,'"" she said. ""But yet they are willing to bring them home because we want to be able to be with them and see them.""

Before the pandemic, hospice workers cared for patients dying of heart disease, cancer, dementia and other terminal illnesses in long-term care facilities and, to a lesser extent, home settings. Many families hesitated to go the die-at-home route because of the many logistical challenges, including work schedules and complicated medical needs.

But the pandemic changed things. People were suddenly working from home and had more time, and they were more comfortable with home hospice knowing the alternative with lack of visitation at nursing homes.

""What happened with COVID is everything was on steroids so to speak. Everything happened so quickly that all of a sudden family members were prepared to care for their loved ones at home,"" said Carole Fisher, president of the National Partnership for Healthcare and Hospice Innovation. ""Everything accelerated.""

""I have heard families say, 'I can care for my aged mother now very differently than I could before because I am working from home,'"" she added. ""And so there is more of a togetherness in the family unit because of COVID.""

Dying at home isn't for everyone, however. Caring for the needs of a critically ill relative can mean sleepless nights and added stress as the pandemic rages.

Karen Rubel recalled that she didn't want to take her own 81-year-old mother to the hospital when she had a stroke in September and then pushed hard to bring her home as soon as possible.

She is president and CEO of Nathan Adelson Hospice in Las Vegas, which has designated one of its in-patient facilities for COVID-19 patients.

The decision on who to vaccinate first is tricky, since it is a question of logistics, vulnerability, and spread. Older and more ""at-risk"" people are more likely to get sick, which fills up the ICU. But people who work with the public are more likely to contract COVID, and are more likely to spread it. Schools in particular are guaranteed to become superspreader sites, and vaccinating teachers can mitigate that. There have already been a number of schools that had to quarantine high numbers of students and staff after reopening.

There is also a question of fairness and access. I personally don't see why an ""at-risk"" individual who has the ability to work from home should be given priority over workers who are being asked to return to work.

There’s a chance, Bieniasz explains, that people waiting for their second dose may have a sub-optimal level of immunity that places selective pressure on the virus. If someone were to become infected during the interval between jabs, that pressure could allow for the emergence of a mutant version of SARS-CoV-2 able to shake off a person’s immune response—a so-called escape variant.

## Abstract

**STUDY QUESTION**

How is the semen quality of sexually active men following recovery from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection?

**SUMMARY ANSWER**

Twenty-five percent of the men with recent SARS-Cov-2 infections and proven healing were oligo-crypto-azoospermic, despite the absence of virus RNA in semen.

**WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY**

The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in human semen and its role in virus contagion and semen quality after recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still unclear. So far, studies evaluating semen quality and the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen of infected or proven recovered men are scarce and included a limited number of participants.

**STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION**

A prospective cross-sectional study on 43 sexually active men who were known to have recovered from SARS-CoV2 was performed. Four biological fluid samples, namely saliva, pre-ejaculation urine, semen and post-ejaculation urine, were tested for the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Female partners were retested if any specimen was found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Routine semen analysis and quantification of semen leukocytes and interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels were performed.

**PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS**

Questionnaires including International Index of Erectile Function and Male Sexual Health Questionnaire Short Form were administered to all subjects. The occurrence of virus RNA was evaluated in all the biological fluids collected by RT-PCR. Semen parameters were evaluated according to the World Health Organization manual edition V. Semen IL-8 levels were evaluated by a two-step ELISA method.

**MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE**

After recovery from COVID-19, 25% of the men studied were oligo-crypto-azoospermic. Of the 11 men with semen impairment, eight were azoospermic and three were oligospermic. A total of 33 patients (76.7%) showed pathological levels of IL-8 in semen. Oligo-crypto-azoospermia was significantly related to COVID-19 severity (p &lt; 0.001). Three patients (7%) tested positive for at least one sample (one saliva; one pre-ejaculation urine; one semen and one post-ejaculation urine), so the next day new nasopharyngeal swabs were collected. The results from these three patients and their partners were all negative for SARS-CoV-2.

**LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION**

Although crypto-azoospermia was found in a high percentage of men who had recovered from COVID-19, clearly exceeding the percentage found in the general population, the previous semen quality of these men was unknown, nor is it known whether a recovery of testicular function was occurring. The low number of enrolled patients may limit the statistical power of study.

**WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS**

SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in saliva, urine and semen in a small percentage of men who recovered from COVID-19. One-quarter of men who recovered from COVID-19 demonstrated oligo-crypto-azoospermia indicating that an assessment of semen quality should be recommended for men of reproductive age who are affected by COVID-19.",,,1612882756,{},gmpb35u,True,t3_lg51yn,False,True,t3_lg51yn,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lg51yn/semen_impairment_and_occurrence_of_sarscov2_virus/gmpb35u/,1612882778,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-020-0479-4

The receptor binding domain on the spike protein (binds to host ace2), is a dynamic region of the protein and can adopt various conformations. This isn’t novel by any means in the protein world, antibodies undergo induced fit conformational changes as well. In fact, protein dynamics is the next frontier as structural determination technology such as CryoEM advances. Proteins exhibit these fluctuations in the unbound state more-so than the bound state (although I could note some interesting exceptions in the literature with unrelated to covid19 enzymes). So yes, this area is mobile in solution relative to say the core of the spike protein where water is largely excluded (the hydrophobic effect; aka the fear of water is the driving force for protein folding).

Back to your question about generating an autoimmune response with a “cocktail” mRNA vaccine. There is risk here and potential upside, it would need to be run through clinical trials of course. The risk is really associated with the vaccine technology, which has your host cells surface displaying spike proteins for a somewhat short duration. If you have a “cocktail” of cells inside you coated with different spike proteins, the immune response could be revved up such that your immune system “accidentally” begins building immunity to some native surface receptor neighboring the spike proteins. Then you have B cells producing (constantly) antibodies for proteins that are native to your own cells (autoimmune disorder). 

I try to be explicit when I go from explaining things with citations to my own hypotheses or potential solutions. The above is a hypothetical scenario for a “cocktail” covid19 mRNA based vaccine. By all means, much like in the lab, in vitro work does not always translate (pun intended) to what goes down in vivo.

As far as “how many mutations can we expect”, this depends on a lot of factors. The spike protein has to maintain its folded state such that it is stable for some degree of time. So many areas are probably immutable, as they compromise the structure. Mutations that draw my concern are those where an asparagine (Asn; N) mutates on the spike protein. Specifically, the Asn’s that are N-glycosylated (sugars attached to the protein). These mutations could confer resistant strains, opening the door for reinfection and having to mount a full response by the immune system. A good read for you, if you find the structure interesting:

Unclear.  I think there is a lot of undeserved cynicism about J&amp;J's decision to use moderate to severe cases to gauge efficacy. They chose to measure efficacy in terms of moderate and severe cases in [their protocol](https://www.jnj.com/coronavirus/covid-19-phase-3-study-clinical-protocol) ahead of the phase 3 trial in December, and cleared it with the FDA, just like Pfizer and Moderna chose to include mild cases in their protocols ahead of their phase 3 trials. We don't really know how many moderate and severe cases become mild cases vs asymptomatic, nor do we know how many mild cases become asymptomatic.

That’s why I think you’re looking at somewhere around July or early August. People here don’t want to hear that though because they want to be able to stop wearing masks and end all restrictions. The question becomes when should we stop restrictions and which ones. I say personally around early summer we can loosen most business restrictions but should keep masks in groceries, department stores, etc until late June or July so workers and customers mostly have had a chance to vaccinate and the percent vaccinated makes spread indoors much less likely. If cases are low enough by April we should probably be reopening schools.

Pfizer/Moderna have said they’ll have 200 million doses by end of March and another 200 million doses by end of may and June respectively. J&amp;J said 100 million doses by end of June. Let’s say the production schedule is linear and J&amp;J is in distribution by mid March 

End of March: 200 million mRNA + 14 million J&amp;J (114 million people)
J&amp;J rate: 100 million/3.5 months = 28.5 million/month
Pfizer rate: 100 million/2 months = 50 million a month
Moderna rate: 100 million/3 months = 33 million a month
April: 283 million mRNA, 42 million J&amp;J (180 million people)
May: 366 million mRNA, 70 million J&amp;J (253 million people) (Pfizer done)
June: 400 million mRNA, 100 million J&amp;J (300 million people)

Very rough estimates but you have to keep in mind that there is a major lag between production and distribution. On top of that there is a major lag between first dosage and actual immunity. The estimates I used assumed zero lag between production and distribution which is a crazy assumption, and that the production schedule is linear when we know it’s ramping up and accelerating. Meaning my numbers are way overestimating the actual doses that will be administered by end of April. I would wager we’ll be much closer to 120 million people vaccinated by April than the 180 million I referenced which would only happen under perfect conditions. For sure workers are going to be the ones least likely to be able to vaccinated due to less schedule flexibility. If cases keep decreasing to very low levels than maybe but that remains to be seen. I’m not saying masks forever and certainly not past the summer but people here’s expectations of the vaccine timetable are not based in reality. Most people will not be able to get vaccinated by April on a meaningful sense. By may is a much better estimate. Because while you may be eligible to get a vaccine it may be very hard to actually procure an appointment. And it may get easier to find them but the demand will also greatly increase as more people become eligible.

The only way to stop all deaths is elimination of it....the will isn't there for that because it'd take intense Lockdowns for literal years to a decade.

The time in which the British variant of the virus has not yet gained the upper hand is crucial to get the infection figures down with all our might, Merkel said at an online meeting of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group in the Bundestag on Tuesday, according to information obtained by Deutsche Presse-Agentur from several participants.

However, one could then make opening steps ""with a better conscience."" There are still differences about that, the chancellor conceded ahead of her consultations with the state premiers this Wednesday. Merkel said she expected the British version of the virus to be the dominant one in Germany as well in a few weeks.

Let’s take the ‘ugly’ assumption that covid can mutate into something that - not just bypasses the neutralizing antibodies - but into something that bypasses all other arms of the human immune response and doesn’t reduce the severity of the virus. This is the assumption you make when you say that mutations could overwhelm the hospital system. 

1) is there any evidence right now support that mutations could do this? The answer is no, so I really don’t know why this scenario is being used as the null hypothesis 

2) What other respiratory virus in history ever mutated into a version of itself that is more dangerous, more severe than it’s novel strain with respect to the effect that is has on our immune system? Why do we get the flu every year? Because it mutates into something that can get past our neutralizing antibodies and become re-infected. Why is it never as severe as  the first time a population is exposed to the strain even though then population can be reinfected? Because our immune systems have learned how to fight this type of virus without needing to go into overdrive.

Yes. Covid *could* mutate into a strain that not only infects post vaccination but also yields a more severe bodily response. But, there is about as much evidence to this as suggesting that 2022’s strain of influenza *could* mutate into something stronger that completely blows past all previous immunity. Should we monitor for this? Absolutely. Should it be the assumption that this is what will *definitely*  happen and take all precautions to prevent it?

Zero transmission isn't going to happen. It's a friggin *cold virus.*

Making moderate to severe Covid disease rare *is* possible. It's been done many times in 2020 with decisive emergency action, and vaccine trials show that mass vaccination will be able to replace masking and contact tracing.

But you're a selfish fool if you're saying that mask mandates, testing, tracing, and isolation destroy what makes life worth living. *We are at war,* humanity vs disease, and wars are worth surviving. 

And, concretely, *that* is [what ZCA is advocating for](https://zerocovidalliance.org/community-actions). Fight the damn war to victory. 

It really, really bewilders me that conservatives have such a problem with this. I was raised by cultural conservatives. *Do you not believe that the common defense is a civic duty?* 

If war with other humans can be justified, why not war against a virus that has *no human dignity* to be respected? 

So that's why I judge you as selfish. This war invaded the homeland. Civilians and the private sector had to make sacrifices, and governments had to mobilize their economies by command (our ancestors did it to win WWII). 

And as conscriptions go, this one is really mild. No sergeant yelling at you, no getting shot or gassed or huddling in trenches with only a tube of M&amp;Ms as the highlight of your day.  A little bit of indoctrination, a little bit of discomfort, some direct economic aid needed, some risk of being called up to sew masks or to learn how to make swabs or to keep the food sector operating. 

And when we make the last push to victory, report twice for a shot.

Researchers have come to the conclusion that the anti-lockdown demonstrations in Leipzig and Berlin in November were superspreader events for all of Germany.

On this November day, people push their way through the center of Leipzig, mostly without any distance or mask. Many of the so-called “lateral thinkers” (Querdenker) make themselves comfortable on picnic blankets and folding chairs in the middle of the streets, the central Augustusplatz is not big enough for the crowd. The police lost control. Police officers ended a demonstration with 20,000 to 40,000 people, but hours later thousands of demonstrators march unhindered through the city.

A similar picture emerges a few days later in Berlin. Opponents of the corona measures want to prevent the new infection protection law in the government quarter on November 18. Stones, bottles and firecrackers fly - 77 police officers are injured. Water cannons drive up in front of the Brandenburg Gate.

Here, too, the mixture of “lateral thinkers” and other conspiracy ideologues, as well as esotericists, right-wing extremists, citizens of the Reich and general critics of the corona policy do not adhere to the obligation to wear mouth and nose protection or to keep their distance. The police dissolve the gathering of 5,000 to 9,000 people after three hours and dozens of warnings, and the eviction lasts until the evening.

It is now clear that these two anti-lockdowns demonstrations were Corona Superspreader events. Had the rallies been canceled, between 16,000 and 21,000 Covid-19 infections could have been prevented by Christmas.

This is the result of a current study by ZEW Mannheim and the Humboldt University in Berlin. The scientists examined how the seven-day incidence has developed in districts with a high proportion of corona deniers.

Three factors were superimposed: The proportion of AfD voters in an area, as the party consistently denies the dangers of the virus. These were compared with the measles vaccination rate at the district level and with the bus stops of the ""Honk for Hope"" network.

Many lateral thinkers (Querdenker) use the buses of the network of the self-styled Corona critic Thomas Kaden to come to demonstrations from all over Germany. This bus network differs significantly from the lines of comparable bus operators. ""Honk for Hope"" stops all over Germany, but many smaller cities are also served. One focus is in the south of Saxony, in the north of Bavaria and in the east of Thuringia.

With these factors, the authors of the study come to the conclusion that after the two demonstrations in Leipzig and Berlin, the seven-day incidence increased significantly more in districts in which there are cities served by the “Honk for Hope” network.

Compared to counties without stops, it was around 40 higher on average until Christmas. For example, if the incidence rose from 60 to 100 in city A without a stop, it rose from 60 to 140 in the same period in city B with a stop.

""We see in our data that ten to twelve days after the demonstrations that the incidence in the bus stop counties is increasing sharply,"" says study author Martin Lange to Tagesspiegel. ""Because there were even more people in Leipzig than in Berlin, we assume that the Leipzig demonstration also had the greater effect on the number of infections.""

Lange does not want to single out individual districts by name on the phone. But it is clearly recognizable that the incidence is increasing more strongly, especially in small towns with such a bus stop. “We interpret this to mean that a place that is quite small, but still has a bus stop like this, must have a particularly high proportion of corona denier demonstration participants and it is therefore also plausible that the infection numbers there increased after the demonstrations, ” explains Lange.",,,1612889730,{},gmpqsj3,True,t3_lg7mab,False,True,t3_lg7mab,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lg7mab/study_two_antilockdown_protests_in_germany_are/gmpqsj3/,1612890665,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

As far as healthcare workers losing their jobs due to lack of patients, please quote your references as that is ridiculous. There is no  hospital except maybe in remote areas of Alaska or very small rural areas  that laid anyone off during the pandemic. Right now one of the reasons they can't vaccinate alot of people is because they don't have enough nurses. Many states have contacted nurses, vet and chiropractic clinics asking for volunteers and saying they will train any clinical health care provider to give injections. I know this for a fact as I'm an RN.  There were many hospitals that were overloaded and went on diversion (diverting EMS to other hospitals) across the country. I have nurse friends and acquaintances across the country and every single one of them knew about closures and overloading. In fact this occurred even though doctors and surgeons were restricted to only necessary surgeries, elective surgeries being cancelled for months and surgical nurses being floated to work on medical floors. Even now, I have been waiting for a serious neck surgery for two months. The hospital is still at 30% Covid occupancy so they had to double up post surgical patients for inpatient rooms. As I am high risk for Covid my surgeon doesn't want to operate until they go back to private rooms due to the risk of infection in having a roommate. Most hospitals will not post how overcrowded and understaffed they are both because they don't want to panic people but also as it can be used against them for lawsuits.

For me, it's obstacle course racing. I was registered for six races in 2020 and busted my ass putting in the miles in the cold winter and the hours in the gym to get ready. I pr'd my deadlift in February of 2020 and was probably in the best shape of my life and ready for a spring, summer, and fall of taking on these races. I've been able to keep running this whole time which has kept my grounded mentally, so it's not like I've truly lost much progress or anything. But running the actual races are some of the most fun I have in my life and I still hate that I wasn't able to do them. 

Clearly people have bigger problems. People have lost loved ones, jobs, houses, etc. I don't mean to minimize any of that or compare my first-world problem to those.

The COVID-19 vaccines as a whole are excellent at preventing severe disease, and this level of protection so far seems to hold even against a new coronavirus variant found in South Africa that is causing reinfections. This, rather than herd immunity, is a more achievable goal for the vaccines. “My picture of the endgame is we will, as fast as we can, start taking people out of harm’s way” through vaccination, says Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at Harvard. The virus still circulates, but fewer people die.

I’m pretty sure this is what most people have been expecting. We can predict that as the most vulnerable are protected by vaccine and hospitals won’t risk being overrun, the world will be able to open.

Yes, they are the initial doses (of many millions to come, maybe)

&gt; **Initial supply will be delivered from BioNTech’s production facilities in Germany.** 

This doesn't still explicitly say that all of the 100 mil doses will come from Marburg. It might be **initial** 20 mil and the rest from Fosun's facility in China. It's not cas onclusive from this press release as you're implying. 

&gt; The Marburg facility will be able to produce &gt;200 Million doses in Q2, the EU gets 75 million doses, the rest will be exported.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fact that the whole output from this (taxpayer funded) facility, isn't going to the EU and that the EU, wasn't able to secure more doses from this facility much quicker, is just pure insanity.

EU didn't sign the 300 mil contract to get the vaccines solely from Marburg, it'd be stupid for them to do so. They signed with BNT/ Pfizer, which means EU gets both from Belgium and Marburg. No company will sign a contract/ promise based on an under constructed facilities, they surely made sure (I'm guessing) that they can keep their promises based on their existing facilities.

Yes, they said they can supply 75 mil in Q2 from the later contract because they can now estimate their global production capabilities more decisively (increased production in Belgium and Marburg), but it doesn't say that this 75 mil is *explicitly* coming from Marburg, can be both from Marburg and Belgium. Maybe we'll get more, who knows. BNT/Pfizer is supposed to produce 1 bil doses until June and they have so far 836 + 100 (Fosun) mil doses of definitive contracts worldwide according to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/contracts-purchasing-agreements.html), including EU's earlier contract. 

&gt;they get only 1/3 of the Marburg production and nothing from any production facility outside of the EU, that's quite a shitty deal if you ask me (negotiated by incompetent people) .  

Again, I doubt EU's deal is solely based on Marburg. But you're absolutely right on EU's negotiations, EU's deal is shitty and made by incompetent people. And from what we learned from AZ deal, EU tends to get their vaccines from EU and around, so there's that!",,,1612893882,{},gmq0l26,False,t3_lfjucx,False,True,t1_gmmtlyw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfjucx/eu_finalises_second_deal_with_pfizer_for_300/gmq0l26/,1612895727,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I personally don't about whether fever was present, especially not at the 37.8-38C range which is really boarderline normal. Because fever, fatigue, and headache are normal immune responses that can be caused by the vaccine itself, so I don't think its a particularly big deal if those symptoms are missed. 

I'm more interested in the COVID exclusive symptoms like loss of smell and vomiting. You can argue AZ is more sensitive to fever, but I'll counter that J&amp;J had a bigger list of actual COVID symptoms (eye discharge, bluish lips, red toes). 

Either way, we'll likely never see the actual data to do our own armchair analysis. None of the vaccines have released data that detailed. Best we can possibly hope for is FDA/EMA numbers after they normalized the raw data and do the calculation themselves. Arguing over a couple of single digit % difference between vaccines using public data that's only 95% CI is just vaccine cheerleading for cheerleading purposes.

The allocations to states have been barely inching upwards.  Last week we had 5.1 mil first doses allocated to states/territories combined.  So in 2-3 weeks we MIGHT hit 1.5 mil/day weekly avg (assuming a moderate climb in 1st doses).

I'm not saying distribution isn't a concern, but why would we need ""national guard deployment"" or ""NFL mega sites"" or ""Dentists giving vaccines"" if states aren't getting enough doses to warrant needing that kind of extreme measure?  Most states have opened up eligibility to the point where they can't fulfill demand due to lack of doses, not lack of nurses to give a shot.  Scheduling is the real nightmare, some clinics don't even know how much they will be getting/can book.

I know they have POs they say they will fill, but I just don't see how pfizer and moderna go from delivering 5 mil each a week in February to finishing out 200 mil each by may/june.  Yes J&amp;J will be one shot, if approved, but from what I've heard their manufacturing is ""still coming up"" whatever that means.

I'm just worried that all the people saying ""I will give up masks once the elderly and high risk are vaccinated, because then anyone can get it."" don't realize that there will still be shortages for months after ""anyone"" could theoretically get it but the public is having to refresh like they're trying to buy a ps5 for Christmas and be willing to drive to Kalamazoo to get it.  Time, money, and privilege will all weigh heavily in who gets it when.

I'm just so tired and I want this to be over, but ""things are looking up"" sounds hollow when the data of what we've been getting shows a painfully slow trickle of doses actually coming to states.  CDC allocations [pfizer](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccine-Distribution-Allocations-by-Juris/saz5-9hgg) and [Moderna](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccine-Distribution-Allocations-by-Juris/b7pe-5nws).  I am reluctant to get my hopes up when people were saying in November ""vaccines for all by March"" and now it's ""June"" and in April they will say ""August"" and the reality is some of us will be waiting til January.... 2022.

I never had paid any attention to the air returns before, but they're down at your feet in every row. So you have an air supply above your head, you can blast it at yourself straight down, creating a current going right into the filtration system. If the filtration system is as good as they say, at least you're not going to get covered by germs if someone sneezes in the row ahead of you. 

Masks, and rapid testing, will hopefully let air travel return full force eventually.

Actual thing that happened: one town issued restriction two weeks ago (23rd of January). And then revoked it a day later. [https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/halland/halmstads-kommun-vander-i-fragan-om-munskydd](https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/halland/halmstads-kommun-vander-i-fragan-om-munskydd)

**Halmstad Municipality is turning its back on the issue of protective equipment for school staff.** **They write in a press release that their own protective equipment can be used by employees in the municipality who are concerned, despite the fact that there are no recommendations on the use of masks in schools.**

On Saturday, criticism was directed at Halmstad municipality by, among others, the National Union of Teachers as the municipality did not allow school staff to use protective equipment. According to Pauline Broholm Lindberg, head of administration at the children and youth administration in Halmstad, the reason for the ban was that infection control equipment could mean false security if it is handled in the wrong way.

\- Our previous position was based on us following the Public Health Agency's recommendations, but after consultation internally in the municipality, we have come to the conclusion that we allow our own protective equipment, says Pauline Broholm Lindberg in a press release sent out by Halmstad municipality on Saturday night.

## ""There is nothing that forbids it""

In the press release, they also write that there is still no recommendation from either the Public Health Agency or the infection control doctor to use protective equipment at school. But that there is also nothing that forbids it.

\- If an individual employee wants to use their own masks, it is important that it is done in the right way and taken care of so that no one else is at risk of infection, says municipal director Mattias Rossköld in the press release.",,,1612834205,{},gmnd78z,False,t3_lfpit2,False,True,t3_lfpit2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lfpit2/covid_why_are_swedish_towns_banning_masks/gmnd78z/,1612836305,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

We are in the middle of a pandemic, players obviously might have less access to certain facilities, time away from their families etc. There are a multitude of reasons they might have a decreased performance along with a selection bias from your side but you are jumping the gun and labelling them as long haulers.

Generally speaking though you're right, surging cases can mean more deaths. My only point was that this is not always the case and over the summer when testing increased, we saw more mild cases picked up. We shouldn't be looking at positive PCRs to make every decision that affects livelihoods. Milder cases picked up don't necessarily translate to overburdened hospitals and bodies in the streets. If you want to argue that we should be implement lockdowns every time there is a slight uptick in hospitalizations or deaths ""just in case"", I disagree.

The post I responded too said: ""but the fact is the virus will evolve to evade the vaccine - so we need to be prepared"" and that is just simply false. You cannot say that a virus will definitely mutate to avoid a vaccine. As a scientist I would assume you would know that. The reason I bought up this idea of consciences was because it sounded like you were insinuating that a virus cell would purposefully look for a way to avoid being destroyed which is not true.

&gt;I asked about creationism as you don’t seem to grasp how evolutionary pressure forms populations. I think I understand what I’m saying pretty well - I’m a scientist. You seem to have done some basic background reading and now see yourself as an expert. And where did you pull ‘viruses have sex’ from? There are different paths to genomic variance.......

I was using the outlandish example of ""viruses have sex"" because you used humans as an example of how purposeful selection plays in a role in evolution (which no one is disputing, it of course occurs in procreating organisms). Even someone who is not a virologist should be smart enough to understand that natural selection is not always a purposeful choice, but is instead a result of the environment around the organism. A viral cell does not **purposefully** choose a certain replication mutation that will survive in a host, the mutation occurs via a copying error and then that new viral cell is left on its own to continue to replicate because the bodies immune response IS NOT targeting a cell with that particular mutation, thus creating an ""evolution"" of the virus which can continue to spread. But if the viral cells (however many millions) continue to replicate and mutate but none of the mutations are able to evade a vaccine induced immunity then it will eventually disappear. To insinuate that the virus WILL versus may one day evade immunity is a stretch at best and downright lie at worst. If that was true then vaccines would be essentially useless because every virus would just be evading immunity in every host.",,,1612886486,{},gmpj8t0,False,t3_lft2al,False,True,t1_gmpg8tr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/lft2al/half_of_la_covid19_samples_analyzed_show_mutant/gmpj8t0/,1612886817,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Dude you want to to talk about distorted history when you’re still citing only citing American history relevant to white immigrants. Where was the push to ever integrate with Chinese speaking minorities? Vietnamese? Hindu? These communities are not less insular, they are less accepted. 

It’s not at all race baiting when you make the claim that all races are better integrated in the US. That is not true, and for you to claim so would be “glossing” over the current reality of this country. 

When you are forced to speak one primary language and belittled for speaking another, you’re not forming a singular culture, you are erasing part of people’s identities. This is the kind of backwards international education the US teaches. Erasure. No more saying merry Christmas, only happy holidays. Don’t acknowledge or take part in other cultures because it’s appropriation. This kind of /insular/ mindset is unique to the US. You may have been taught about other cultures, but the approach is just wrong. It isn’t “separate but equal” it’s “different but equal”. That is how multiculturalism works. 

Instead in America, you have ‘MURICA first types like you who like to espouse all the virtues of being an immigrant in America without having ever dealt with the associating hardships or stigma. Anyone who’s been educated outside the US can probably attest to the abysmal and embarrassing system that passes off as education in this country (primarily k-12)—it is why I jumped at the chance to send my children to school abroad. 

Honestly your whole mentality doesn’t even offend me as much as it makes me sad. You sit there, making assertions and strong arming your opinions about a country, a system, a culture when you’ve never even been just to compare it to America is just so...American.

I don't think you even understand what you are saying... First, your use of ""selected"" and your continued disagreement appears to indicate that you think viruses have sex with each other and that how they replicate, similar to humans and that is where the selection comes into this discussion? That is not the case... I am happy to be wrong in my assumption and maybe this come to down to a simple terminology misunderstanding.

But I digress, the virus variant that spreads will be the one that evades antibodies (either through vaccination or natural immunity) and thus is not destroyed inside the host. That is a natural process and occurs because (obviously and like you said) the ""fittest"" of the viruses will be able to survive and replicate. What I am saying is that a viral cell does not ACTIVELY seek mutations that evade immunity, instead they occur due to replication errors and if the mutation successfully evades immunity it is left to replicate (as is the natural process of the cell) unabated until the body recognizes it and begins to kill it. In the meantime that particular mutation is spreading to other hosts where further mutations can occur and it is possible to evade further immunity through **even more** mutations.

&gt;In a later analysis mainly based on infections by the new variant, there was only a 22% lower risk of developing mild-to-moderate Covid-19 versus those given a placebo.
