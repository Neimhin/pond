You're trying to say ""*that's not how it works*"" instead saying *""that's not how it used to work before online teaching was needed to stop people from dying.""*

I understand if what I'm saying seems unpalatable or harsh. But you're saying they rely on the assumption they will pass - I am telling you they now need to learn to fail. And to keep going.

Another advantage you can use in online education is that students can truly go at their own speed (specially if you're recording lectures). So let them fail. They can take it again at whatever speed they can manage. They have even more opporitunities to catch up than the standard maybe-available remedial classes face-to-face.

You have to let them fail and they have to know they can fail and its' going to have to shift to students and parents realizing their responsibility in all this.

And honestly, at this point many doctors and scientists in the U.S. have to take some responsibility for constantly saying ""there's no evidence"" - they did it with masks (b.s. they did it to conserve PPE, Osterholm and others cited highly suspect studies in early March), aerosolized spread, asymptomatic spread (which really meant presymptomatic, but our way of testing screwed this up too), and now I feel like they get out there and shit all over the benefits of possibly using pool and rapid testing. 

There's a giant gulf between admitting you just don't know, but evidence points that way and saying ""there's no evidence"" which, by scientific standards and depending on the scientist (cause science is also conducted by imperfect humans), could have a hundred different meanings that exist on a continuum between ""anyone with common sense and two brain cells can see that it 99.9% is likely to be true"" and ""there's not even any circumstantial evidence to prove it true."" 

The second one would be true of transmission via surfaces, but that doesn't stop some scientists and doctors from STILL insisting that it's a primary route of transmission over airborne and aerosolized spread.

These phrases - ""no evidence, not causative, the studies were imperfect or biased"" - all the usual suspects here in the U.S. mostly, have become nauseating in the current atmosphere because in a situation like this, it has repeatedly let good (and even, in some cases BETTER) become the enemy of ""perfect"" while nearly two hundred thousand people have died who may have had more of a chance if some in science and health in the U.S. had admitted they were a little less certain than they portrayed at the time.

I remember hearing all of the above phrases over the contact traced outbreak studies mentioned in the article below on MSNBC back in MARCH. Why were they shit? Cause they weren't funded here in America by big pharma and done at MIT? Countries like South Korea worked with what they had, which was data, provided you catch it in time, which they did. And when they saw 1,100 people in a building of mixed use where it appeared that nobody outside of about 90 people in a single area on one floor on one SIDE of the building became infected, they made the REASONABLE ASSUMPTION that surface transmission in the elevators and common areas was unlikely and that airborne spread was.

Christ, does the fuckery in the U.S. ever end? Here's that article...

Because that's how making claims work. If you make a claim, especially one as wild as the mortality rate somehow increasing **16-50x**, you have to back that up with evidence. 

&gt;your shitty math? 

Show me the mistakes in my maths then. I cited all the figures. You can check the maths for yourself. 

&gt;The article clearly states it’s as deadly if not deadlier

No it does not. The article states that it increased the number of deaths in New York by a greater percentage than the Spanish Flu did because far less people are dying in general in 2020 than were in 1918. If a city has 100 deaths per year and a virus kills 100, then the # of deaths has doubled. If a city of the same size has 10 per year and another virus comes in and kills 50, the # of deaths has increased 6x despite the virus being only half as deadly.

The kids who need the most help, the majority of the time, don't want it or don't care. They don't like school, they don't enjoy learning, it just isn't for them. I don't personally see that as the giant tragedy others do. Not everyone is going to be doctor or lawyer, and that's perfectly fine. My own personal goal is that at the very least these kids enjoy the experience of *being* in school from a social standpoint. 

The kids who DO enjoy learning will suffer more, of course, but will be able to catch up relatively quickly. There's a lot more ""down time"" in elementary school than people realize.

Your argument is that there is more resources being thrown into a covid vaccine which is why it will be faster.  I gave you a link to the FDA that shows the typical time a stage 3 trial takes years to observe. No matter how much resources you throw at the problem, you cannot speed up the observation time.

I’m wondering if the school experience should be more autonomous and coordinated at a national level.

Or elementary school teachers reading stories. Or even teachers with a small group of kids working together, and students can watch that.

It just seems so silly to me that local classroom teachers would bust their asses to provide an ok experience, when we can easily pull together resources and know-how from all teachers to give kids something engaging and interesting.

It should be easier but there are a lot of hurdles. They're also having us do all sorts of time consuming assessments to star the year that are tedious in person, but a tad difficult in the current system.

Worse still our district had some fantastic digital learning tools and programs two years ago for adaptive learning. But we cut them because the district is stupidly cheap.

Thing is...we knew that. I know because I made that (similar) claim in a paper I wrote in February. Point is we still did nothing. Even with an altered announcement it was unlikely to have a significant impact due to the abundance of misinformation right out of the gate other than what fauci said.

I just disagree. There was an enormous amount of alternate misinformation at play that this would have a very minor impact.

To give a bit of background, my school had already been looking into distance learning options before shit hit the fan. They were doing so because the winter before caused us to miss like 3 weeks to a month of school, so they wanted to look into options so that we didn't have to pile on days at the end of the year.

The plans were accelerated along when the pandemic started because schools were about to be shut down and forced into distance learning.

Now to detail the distance learning plans.

The base requirements were pretty simple. Each class should assign enough work for the average student to be able to finish in about 30 minuits resulting in about between 3 to 4 hours of work daily. 

That's it. Those were the requirements. It was up to the teachers to decide how they spent those 30 minuits and what they would do in them. This resulted in a great diversity of learning and teaching styles. For instance, one of my math teachers put out 20 minuit videos detailing what we were learning followed by him showing us a couple of practice problems. This was then followed by a Google doc that had some problems to answer. 

In my geography class was essentially made to be done online with all of the activities that we did. Our teacher had us do research into a country of our choice that is located in one specific region (Asia, Africa, South America, ECT.). Normally we would have presented this presentations, but instead we just turned them in to be graded. Most of the other activities were things like planning international trips or other things that would be done mostly online either way.

I would detail my other classes, but I can't really remember them after everything that happened this summer.

All I can say is that I am very thankful that my school gave most of the control over how teachers taught to the teachers, and did not require teachers to teach in one way (Zoom).",,1598765729,{},g3bqgpy,False,t3_ij18dx,False,True,t1_g3baddr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ij18dx/teachers_who_are_resigning_and_retiring_across/g3bqgpy/,1598765739,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

One can imagine populations in confined settings where everyone interacts with one very frequently (prisons, crowded long term care facilities) and thus it's relatively easy for everyone to get infected.

Other situations more appropriate to real life demonstrate much more heterogeneity in social interactions. For instance, people living in Boston rarely interact with people living in San Francisco. Locally, you  don't interact with your neighbor's parents for instance, or with someone who attends a different university.

The previous model that estimates a HIT of 60-70% explicitly assumes everyone interacts with everyone else equally. That is, someone in NYC is as likely to bump into someone living in Tampa as they are to their neighbor across the hallway. That obviously is not true. These more realistic models that take these facts into account arrive at much lower herd immunity thresholds.

Finally, these new models take into account that the very social, connected people tend to get infected first. Once they are infected, they either die or become immune and do not transmit the virus any longer.

You can break these down further to find that information.

If you read the papers describing such models the authors state their results should not be taken as estimates.  

Example: https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6505/846?_ga=2.209051024.389266352.1598772525-1281018191.1594323587  
From abstract:  
&gt;Our estimates should be interpreted as an illustration of how population heterogeneity affects herd immunity rather than as an exact value or even a best estimate.  

You can find other models in PubMed. 

The seroprevalence measured in non-clinical settings involves more socially active members of the population, people who either know they had SARS-CoV-2 and are thus immune or those who at lower risk of developing severe cases of the disease. Even just anecdotally on this sub you see plenty of people saying they're taking heavy precautions because they are at higher risk for mortality, and we see those at lower risk taking fewer precautions. Additionally, if you look at the geographic distribution of seroprevalence you quickly see that within states, within cities, there is a ton of spatial heterogeneity, meaning protection is not equally distributed in an area.  

What's the goal of herd immunity? To myself and many of my colleagues the goal includes protecting the most vulnerable people from contracting the disease. Relying on seroprevalence and some benchmark figure based on disjointed serosurveillance will not achieve that, in fact it is likely to increase risk of disease in vulnerable populations. Which, actually, the authors of models acknowledge. It will be more dangerous for high risk groups if we rely on seropositivity and declare herd immunity because members will go back to associating with others who are at higher risk (i.e., elderly people gathering together) because if one of them becomes infected you're looking at an outbreak right there.",,1598776492,{},g3c2cqk,False,t3_iisq73,False,True,t1_g3b90ps,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iisq73/daily_discussion_post_august_29_questions_images/g3c2cqk/,1598776503,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

My ped got angry at me for bringing kids in late (home schedule issues). I have one person in the circle who is an absolute nutcase with all things conspiracy. He is a sahd (stay at home dad) yoga teacher. But his wife, who even with doubts leaning towards his, still got their kids vaccinated because doctors &gt; husband. So as far as I can see, they still respect doctors and experts. 

I think there is this huge amount of suspicion with anything non-organic, the traditional way. But the modern wacko movements of anti science stream had caught waves because it aligned with their original pro farmers, pro local consumptions. Remember when it made the news when a farmer dumped manure at a McDonald's? The idea of global food distribution had always been a thorn in this culture.

If you were to ask some average French, sure, I'll get the high percentage of the board sounding alarms full of doubts. How could mass production of anything can be healthy? Vaccines doubts get through to some of these borderline activists, the yoga scene, anti GMO, pro ""bios"" (their organics), all the way to the government conspiracies, depends on how simple the persons you talk to are. And they find each other, or grow doubts. .y MIL and my SIL are like this. They are nice as pies but get huffy about bio products. They will be first to get hooked on the idea that manufacture products from elsewhere are likely not safe as default. They think it's healthy to doubt, hence the answers in such surveys. Yet push come to shove they 1. can not cite any evidence yet, 2. schools still require all kids to be vaccinated too be able to enroll, and 3. doctors still prevail, so far.

I do get nervous of how social media toxic will roll out. In some ways by the French are a bit behind on anglosphere trends, good and bad. Mostly bad.

Establishing a whole system, method, and routine takes A LOT of trial and error. I doubt the districts spent any time coming up with really interactive and thought-out ways of helping teachers teach. 

My son's school basically just handed out Chromebooks, gave the students all the workbooks and stuff, and said ok watch zoom and learn. I'm homeschooling him now and I've never taught anything to anyone before and it's taking a lot of trial and error to see what works and what doesn't. It's pretty stressful. 

So I can't imagine having a whole class of kids on a freaking zoom lecture trying to get them to learn and do their work. 

There are a lot of tools like Adobe meeting rooms, poll software, that thing with the pen so you can hand write on a digital whiteboard, etc. But I don't think they thought out and prepared all that.

Significance Statement

This study demonstrates how a wide class of epidemiological models can be adapted for applications to heterogeneous populations in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic. It is shown that a persistent heterogeneity, rather than bursty short-term variations in infection transmission is responsible for self-limiting epidemic dynamics.

Compact generalizations of the classical results for the herd immunity threshold and the final size of an epidemic are derived. The degree of persistent heterogeneity is estimated from data on real-life face-to-face contact networks, and on age variation of susceptibility to COVID-19.The estimate is further supported by the analysis of the empirical data from the epidemic in NYC and Chicago, as well as in 50 US states.  The results suggest that by the end of the first wave of the epidemic, the hardest-hit areas, such as NYC, have been close to the heterogeneity-modified herd immunity, thereby limiting their vulnerability to a potential second wave of the epidemic.",,1598801589,{},g3d3jkw,False,t3_ijczc1,False,True,t3_ijczc1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ijczc1/persistent_heterogeneity_not_shortterm/g3d3jkw/,1598801821,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

I'm  saying that there are reports that say that the disease is very mild to younger population. so maybe someone that deals mainly with people who seek medical care for otherwise mild disease can be a bit biased.

&gt; You're trying to argue that correlation isn't causation.

I don't think I did imply that (sorry if there's confusion I'm not English). The friend I knew actually had the flue badly affect his eyesight.

The flue can cause horrific complications, and can also cause a little sniffle.

&gt; Not true. Those who get infected with SARS-Cov2 **will** have one or more of the symptoms 

You say that with so much conviction, yet other sources don't agree with what you say. see:

 [https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/prevention-and-screening-articles/wuhan-coronavirus](https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/prevention-and-screening-articles/wuhan-coronavirus) 

&gt; Most people who become infected with the virus have mild symptoms and may not know they are sick. Others get flu-like symptoms. Some patients — particularly adults over 65 and those with underlying medical conditions — develop a severe form of pneumonia, which can lead to death.

&gt; About 15.6% of confirmed COVID‐19 patients are asymptomatic. Nearly **half** of the patients with no symptoms at detection time will develop symptoms later. Children are likely to have a higher proportion of asymptomatic infection than adults 

and many many others.

&gt;  And secondly, most people are able to ride it out at home but they're in contact with their own doctors via telemedicine 

Most people who are infected are in contact with doctors?

So even in that ridiculously generous scenario, the mortality rate still only be 0.1568%. Still **16x** lower than the Spanish Flu.

&gt;Each and every one of those pillars have rules that need to be followed, even the one about Faith requires you to admit that there is no God but Allah, and that Mohammad is the central messenger of God.

Anyone who rejects the Shahada is automatically not a Muslim. That's like a Christian saying ""God doesn't exist"", or a Buddhist saying ""Desire is good"".

&gt;The ruling deity is an omnipotent and omnipresent being whom you have to worship.

&gt;Islam has five fundamental pillars; Prayer, Ramadan, Zakat, Hajj, and Faith.

You're just listing down the tenets of the religion and saying that Islam is monolithic. Like, what does that even mean? 

1. That all Muslims practice Islam in the same way? You just said they don't.

&gt;Muslims may not be monolithic

2. That Islamic institutions are rigid? But there isn't a global mosque that a majority of practitioners belong too, unlike say Roman Catholicism which has like a billion members all explicitly belonging to the same one, holy, catholic and apostolic church. The Muslim community is much more decentralised in all aspects and there isn't a governing body, a ""supreme council of imams"", or a Holy See.
3. That the practice of the religion is rigid? But the history of Islam is one of constant change, adaptation, and innovation (a loaded word!). You have the split between Sunni and Shia (which occurred, like, the second Muhammad died), the schools of jurisprudence and the veneration of saints, not to mention the different ways Islam is practiced in different cultures and how it intermingles with nationality/ethnicity (eg. Hui Muslims in Gansu/Ningxia vs. Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang/East Turkestan vs. Palestinian Muslims in Gaza vs. Turkish Muslims in Istanbul). I mean, Wahhabism (a small sect of Islam) is a rejection of all perceived ""innovation"" in Islam (which is ironic because the practice of Islam has never been standardised since its *inception*). For Wahhabism to be, like, a thing, requires that innovation exists, no?
4. That the Qur'an is unchanging? But of course it's unchanging. It was written down a millennium and a half ago, and ink on parchment can't morph into new words. If that's the case, then every religion whose tenets were ever written down anywhere is ""monolithic"": Christianity, Buddhism, Taoism, Sikhism, Islam, Judaism, you name it.

If you want to look historically before say the 1960s complaining usually got you executed or persecuted by the law.

Anyway going back to the historical points.
I studied the protestant reformation so I won't go into it too much as I might bore you but enough to say although the impetus behind  the points nailed to the door may appear to be corruption, the schism was not due to ""complaining""  There were many theoretical reasons for the Protestant reformation, one of which was transfer of power from Rome to individual states.  I wouldn't introduce the dynamic as ""complaining"" but we can may beg to differ on that one..

 I don't view the French revolution as ""complaining"". The famous expression that resounds from the causes of the French Revolution was ""Let them eat cake""... It depends on your viewpoint. This says to me that complaining about their lot got the French no where. It took direct action. If you want to assimilate food riots combined with  revolutionary theory aided by the new development of the printing press with ""complaining"" then maybe you could shoe horn that one in there...

Similarly the over throw of a colonial Empire in the Americas is a stretch on the limits of the use of the word ""complaining"" The American forces were well armed and had arguably more intelligent millitant commanders. They didn't complain the British out of America

I am not going into the Slavery one I don't see how it is relevant. Slaves were unable to complain anyway. I dont see what good it does to complain when you have a gun to your head? The abolition of slavery was accredited by many historians to be reliant on the changing fortunes of the northern forces in the civil war ie it was a tactical decision which aided the north at a tricky time.  I really dont see why abolitionists are ""complainers"" either. Having an opinion on moral matters does not make a person automatically a ""complainer"". I would argue that slavery was ended by economic shifts in America that made the system less profitable in an era when labour was needed in the north in the factories. ie slavery and capitalism are not good bedfellows. If you think slavery in the States was ended because of a few abolitionists who were nice people then you should do a bit more study.

Hitler? Now on  a personal level he did get things done by complaining but that was due to a certain fear factor perhaps? That really is a stretch to try and suggest 7 million jews died because Hitler was a complainer

I agree with a lot of what you say but your examples fall short...

Employees Work at Multiple Nursing Homes and Spread COVID-19
https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty-and-research/anderson-review/nursing-networks-covid

&gt;In a working paper, the researchers estimate that if workers had the incentive to stay put at one facility, outbreaks at nursing homes could be reduced by an estimated 44%. That would obviously have an impact on the alarming death toll at nursing homes. The CMS reports that more than 30% of nursing home residents in New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts had contracted the virus through late June, and that nearly 10% of nursing home residents in those states had died.

snip

&gt;**The culprit here is a system that effectively encourages (if not outright forces) workers to shuffle among multiple facilities. Many nursing homes rely on staffing services to deliver workers on a just-in-time/just-as-needed basis, rather than directly hire full-time staff. At a median hourly pay rate of $14.25, making a living wage can require patching together work at multiple facilities.** Even then, the essential work of nurses’ aides and orderlies at skilled nursing facilities provides a median salary below $30,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

SNIP

&gt;The researchers found that 7% of individuals who entered one facility also showed up inside another facility. On average, they found, one facility is connected to 14 more by a traveling worker. In rural settings (Montana and Vermont, for example) the cross-facility job hopping was far more muted, with a smartphone showing up in fewer than two facilities. In Florida, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey and Texas, a single smart phone was pinging from an average of 20 other facilities.

&gt;The researchers’ analysis estimates that expected COVID-19 cases at the most highly connected facility within a state is more than 190% higher than the expected outbreak at the least-connected facility.",,1598814557,{},g3dwzok,False,t3_ijepbd,False,False,t1_g3dchlx,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ijepbd/japan_has_the_worlds_oldest_population_yet_it/g3dwzok/,1598816679,5,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],1598816529.0,,

&gt; Most notably, the American
Recovery and Reinvestment
Act of 2009, signed into law
by President Obama in February, includes more than $70
billion in direct spending and
tax credits for clean-energy
and transportation programs,
including:

&gt; - $11 billion towards “smart grid”
&gt; - $6 billion to subsidize loans for renewable energy projects
&gt; - $6.3 billion in state energy efficiency and clean-energy grants
&gt; - $5 billion to weatherize modest-income homes
&gt; - $4.5 billion to make federal buildings more energy efficient
&gt; - $2 billion in grants for advanced batteries for electric vehicles
&gt; - $8.4 billion for mass transit
&gt; - $9.3 billion for construction of high-speed railways
&gt; - $20 billion in tax incentives and credits for renewable energy, plug-in hybrids,
and energy efficiency

&gt; To back up these investments, a number of recently passed policies are poised to
&gt; support the growth of clean-energy sectors in the U.S. These include:

&gt; - an 8-year extension for the investment tax credit (ITC) for solar
&gt; - a 3-year extension for the production tax credit for wind
&gt; - new rules that allow utilities, for the first time, to participate in ITCs
&gt; - a new provision that allows renewable energy developers to receive up to a
&gt; 30 percent government grant instead of a tax credit

Raccoon dogs?” Raccoon dogs are tree-climbing canids with black masks, native to East Asia and also sold as food. “Bamboo rats?” Confession: I’ve eaten those, in China, myself. “Who the hell knows?” Holmes said. “But until we go there and sample them we’re never going to know.

LOL, it is not a typical ""human"" response.

For the uneducated maybe, there are plenty of examples made by the author, where at community level throughout history, groups are prone to scapegoating. Generally speaking this is a default reaction due to a lack of information and a misplaced sense of tribalism.

On an individual level humans start life very self-serving, but as we develop into adulthood (something some never achieve) humans have evolved towards empathy and altruism, because there is safety and prosperity in numbers. However, there is a constant struggle between developed adults, underdeveloped adults and adults that are prone to both nature and nurture behavioural variations such as sociopathy and narcissism, where scapegoating can be regularly found. Which is why most religious and civil ideologies offer laws and moral guidance. I would put forward that a well developed human adult, as an individual would seek to resolve a problem without resorting to scapegoating, as it is not only the ethical option, but it is the option that brings order and knowledge to chaos, and gives us power over our environment (something most of us seek).

In contrast civilization and it's governance have and are still actively using ""scapegoating"" or reinforcing perceived scapegoating by the populous as a tool to achieve secondary agendas. The last 8 months has seen a deluge of misinformation, and changing government strategies, because the original direction was attempting to maintain economic dominance rather than solving the problem. We have even seen evidence of attempts by governments to name the pandemic the ""\*\*\*\*\* Flu"", to which the ""human"" response in academia has been to ignore.

The author mainly discusses prejudices and xenophobia's of the uneducated, and goes on to attribute scapegoating to human evolution. While scapegoating for capital and political gain were identified, they were not included in the expanded problem description after the list of ""Global Sampling"". Why did the author not expand on how governance and money are also responsible for scapegoating. I find this odd because while the humanistic input into the problem clearly exists, the greater influence which causes more harm is being caused by politicians and industrial interests.

I think the author is attempting to use humanity, and the victims of this pandemic as a scapegoat for failings in governance and the economic interests that they work and compete with.",,1598782462,{},g3c7ylz,False,t3_ij6ezl,False,True,t3_ij6ezl,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ij6ezl/why_scapegoating_is_a_typical_human_response_to_a/g3c7ylz/,1598782474,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

It's bloody well hard enough to keep up with all of the paperwork and other nonsense around teaching when we see kids in the controlled environment of a school.

This would be especially true if, like me, you have a degree in a STEM field that has much more remunerative and less dangerous alternatives readily available.

For me, I was a chemistry teacher in the US, and I made a mid-career move pre-COVID after my wife went from a job in hospitality (which paid a little more than my job with a Bachelors degree and 3ish years of experience on her part) to almost a year of hospitalization for an eating disorder (which built up A LOT of debt for us, especially with shitty health care plan options as a teacher) to a position at half of her prior salary as a graduate student. Under all of this financial pressure, my MS in chemistry let me more than double my salary in the private sector so that we didn't spend our entire adult life screwed over by medical and credit card debt, all while working about half as hard as I did as a teacher. I went from being an engaged and enthusiastic teacher (that built two brand-new AP course programs for the school in under 3 years of working there) to a very successful cube dweller, and if I was just slightly less screwed by the way we treat teachers in this country, I would still be inspiring kids with science rather than absorbing fluorescent light within carpeted walls (or, during COVID, spending 40ish hours a week sitting in the home office in our apartment).",,1598763569,{},g3bnran,False,t3_ij18dx,False,True,t3_ij18dx,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ij18dx/teachers_who_are_resigning_and_retiring_across/g3bnran/,1598763580,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

They had no ""official"" lockdown at any point in time - like you could go grocery shopping, exercise in the park, etc. but coming and going out of your apt was tracked. The only people allowed into the apt were delivery people and residents. By late January, people were panic buying masks and seldom left the house. My mom went to buy an iPad for my grandma, and she was the only person in the mall. At this point in time, there were less than 100 cases in the city of 34 million. Schools and workplaces were already closed for the holidays and remained closed until April/May. Temperature taking and hand sanitizer usage were mandatory at the entrance of every building and mask-wearing was enforced (my dad got scolded by police officers multiple times). The first time my parents saw their friends face-to-face in 2020 was in June. 

I was living in the Bay Area until earlier this year. There was a huge testing shortage while offices were still open, people were AND STILL ARE throwing parties, not wearing masks, etc. The Bay Area was praised for reacting ""early"" while I was freaking out at how slow we had reacted compared to Shanghai. I packed up my bags and ran to China at the beginning of March. 

There is no way China could have covered up tens of millions of deaths or an uncontrolled pandemic. The city is just too dense: most people live in apartments, everyone takes the subway, air-conditioning is on full blast, people are eating out at restaurants like crazy, and most people don't even wear masks anymore. If there was just one person sick with COVID, it would have spread like wildfire (like Korea rn). I also got an anti-body test out of curiosity recently. There was no line at all, and I got my results straight away. 

I assume that there will eventually be an outbreak in Shanghai the same way we saw clusters in other Chinese cities. I expect to be in involuntary lockdown at some point. But meh, it's vastly superior to sheltering-in-place at months. I much rather be in China watching movies at the cinema and going to Disneyland in the meantime.

I have seen it firsthand over the last few years.  Teachers have been begging parents to front the cost of school supplies for many years.  They’re paid not even the cost of living, but they’re still expected to teach our children out of their own pockets.  Teachers are expected to get sick or die now?

From just a glance teachers make an average of 45k-75k. Police make an average of 49-65k. Hardly double. Like any other place, there's departments that pay crap and others that pay well. Same with schools. 

But what difference does it make what police make compared to teachers in the first place? Do police just not deserve to get paid well? Is it because they don't require a masters degree? Do only people who you deem educated enough deserve to make a good wage? 

Police also work a shit tonof over time too. And sacrifice a normal work schedule as well. They miss all kinds of important events just due to the nature of their work. Got a court date on your day off? Too bad guess who's going to court. Get a dwi 20 minutes until clock out? Better hope he's a nice drunk or you're going to be there for a few more hours. And so on and so forth for an unlistable amount of things that keep police at work when all they want to do is go home as scheduled. 

And are you seriously saying police salaries and retirement plans aren't threatened? Police are effected so much by politics the job is almost literally defended each time a new party is voted in in their respective jurisdictions. 

Which is why having a strong union is so important. But Reddit hates unions that actually have teeth and represent their clients to the fullest. Or maybe police just shouldn't be defended adequately because.... i don't even know. Maybe they aren't human and don't require fair representation or something. 

Again, no idea why you'd compare the two. Teachers should absolutely be represented more and be paid fairly of they aren't already. But this whole bs rhetoric of ""police get paid good when they shouldn't"" is honestly hilarious. Reddit as a collection will scream about fair living wages but if it's someone they don't like all of a sudden those fair wages, good union, and job incentives are evil.

No. 

Remote learning is what most of us want. It’ll take retraining, which is annoying, but it’s the option that puts our safety paramount. 

What most of us are asked to do right now is the worst of both worlds. Plan content for two modes of instruction, make it individualized and engaging, and do it all on a contract that only pays you for about 40% of the time it will actually take you to do it. If I could focus 100% on virtual, this would be cake. If I need to work harder, fine, just pay me for it. 

But no, I have to do virtual but also figure out how to socially distance 25 kids in a space large enough for 12 and still incorporate social learning practices. And do this all in 4 hours plus another 4-6 working from home unless I want to sacrifice time with my family and personal care. 

Most of us are in risk groups, have close family in risk groups, or have kids that are also being sent into this IDEAL environment for disease communication. And all these shithead parents and their elected officials are forcing the hands of school boards by demanding schools reopen face to face or risk losing already insufficient funding. These same parents who continually elect asshats who reject budget increases because they don’t want to pay higher taxes make appeals to our emotions by crying about how much they NEED their babies back in school no matter who it puts in danger. And yes, these are those same parents who did that virtue signaling back in March/April about finally seeing how hard we work.

As for COVID cases, I can definitely say it’s not cultural, unless you’re saying disobeying authority is iconic American culture. 
The whole world had to take reluctantly take part in this COVID ordeal. The ones that are doing well (Taiwan, New Zealand, Korea, Singapore) had decisive and quick action when the pandemic hit. They consulted experts, made informed, smart decisions, and as a result, protected their people. Good leadership.

The ones that are doing bad are the ones that lagged behind on decisions. America, Brazil, UK; they have leaders that spent a good portion of time denying the pandemic or denouncing scientific advice. The virus had a good amount
of time to spread during that window, and thus put their countries in a disadvantageous situation to weather the storm as time went on.

But there are also a lot of other problems that need to be fixed and saying that good teachers can fix everything is part of that horrible myrtyr story everyone loves. Like teachers need more supports (i.e. teaching emotional well-being and all is great but it does not replace social workers and councilors needed in schools), teachers have too high workloads and too many preps decreasing productivity and successful teaching, schools and teachers should not be responsible for feeding and clothing the students in their communities, students' parents often work too much and can't parent as much as they need to, don't even get me started on the weird property tax funding of schools in the US, the school to prison pipeline, systemic racism and a failing of US infrastructure causing urban decay and a lack of community space for kids that breeds crime, a general culture against school and teachers in the US, a total disconnect between admin and teachers, not trusting or listening to teachers when it comes to their profession, the list goes on and on and on.

Saying good teachers could solve the problem is discouraging af to a lot of teachers who struggle because they're doing the job of 10 people and getting paid as half a person and end up thinking they're just not good enough even though it's not their fault. So yes pay teachers more, but don't blame teachers for everything by recognizing the many factors that lead to failing schools.

I know all that.  I've done my research and I have a background in molecular biology. Have you done yours?  It doesn't sound like it as you're reporting individual cases of younger people dying as part of an overall pattern. Read the breakdown of the IFR by age.

&amp;#x200B;

And reinfection? No point in waiting for a vaccine is there? What you don't seem to realise is that reinfection will lead to a mildly symptomatic/asymptomatic infection the second time round due to a T-cell response. Actually between 30% and 60% of people already have a T-cell response because they've already had another coronavirus.

I think you don't understand risk. The stats don't lie.  Of course, some young people have died of the virus (thought NOT a single healthy child has died from Covid 19 in the UK) but a tiny number (much like the flu). The flu is more dangerous for children than Covid 19.  And the diabetes statistics haven't been adjusted for age and the worst thing is that people don't realise they're diabetic.  The best thing you can do if you're obese is actually lose weight and get tested for type 2 diabetes.  I'm not locking down because some obese people can't lose weight. It's already well known that obesity increases your risk of dying.

In fact, those polyester stretchy face wraps actually scatter the virus into smaller particles if you're infected.

As a mask test, I'd do a lighter test or sprinkle some salt. See if you can blow on it through the mask. The less you can, the more air is encountering resistance and losing momentum from the mask to your face, which is what you want. Ideally, any infected particles should be getting stuck in the fabric weave as they pass through the mask, like a motorcycle trying to go in a straight line through a forest.

[],,greatguysg,,,[],,,,text,t2_9b0kt,False,False,[],"SINGAPORE - Tighter regulations on what constitutes a mask and how it should be worn also came into effect on Saturday (Aug 29), according to a notice gazetted the day before.
It comes as the Ministry of Health (MOH) reiterated on Saturday that makeshift face coverings such as bandanas, scarves and neck gaiters should not be used as masks.
MOH's recommendation is also in line with those by the multi-ministry task force tackling the Covid-19 pandemic.

The definition of a mask has been revised to mean a covering made of paper, plastic or textile solely designed to be worn over the nose and mouth as protection against infection or air pollution.
Previously, a mask was defined as ""any paper or textile covering designed or made to be worn over the nose and mouth to provide the wearer protection against infections or air pollution, but excludes a face shield"".
A mask is now also required to touch the wearer's nose, cheeks and chin when worn.

The previous legislation only stated that it needed to touch the wearer's nose and cheeks.

The amended regulations under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act come after an incident earlier in August where a bus driver [refused to allow a man wearing a neck gaiter to board.](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/covid-19-no-excuse-to-abuse-bus-drivers-ong-ye-kung)

A Health Ministry spokesman said at the time that neck gaiters and bandanas were not recommended to be used as masks.

[A study published by Duke University in the United States](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/medical-masks-best-cotton-good-bandanas-worse-droplet-study) earlier this month looked at 15 types of masks and found that wearing a single layer neck gaiter made of 92 per cent polyester and 8 per cent spandex is worse than not wearing a mask at all.

In a statement on Saturday, MOH noted that there have been recent queries on the efficacy of makeshift coverings in preventing disease transmission.
The ministry said that they may not perform as well as purpose-built masks as they may not have a good fit around the wearer's nose and mouth and are made from materials that are not specific for disease prevention.

""A mask should be worn such that it closely and completely covers the wearer's nose and mouth, without leaving a gap between the mask and the face,"" the ministry added.

Senior criminal lawyer Rajan Supramaniam said that the amended regulations mean that there is more clarity over what constitutes a mask and are ""more decisive"".

Commenting on what are possible repercussions should a member of the public be caught wearing face coverings like scarves or neck gaiters instead of a face mask, he said: ""They can be reprimanded or be given a warning, or could be prosecuted, which means they could be fined.""

Regulations state that those who are caught not wearing a mask can be fined $300.",,1598778426,{},g3c47zo,True,t3_ij9tze,False,True,t3_ij9tze,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ij9tze/tighter_regulations_on_what_constitutes_a_mask/g3c47zo/,1598778436,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

What they do at my kids school is that each class have a designated area to play/hang out on in the school yard. So not allowed to hand out with students from other classes.

Good teaching is a little more complicated than that. I don't worry about online teaching for my own sake, I worry about the learning outcomes of the children.

As an example one of the best moments from my last math class was when the students all separated into pairs and worked on a small set of problems. Each group has a whiteboard, so it's easy for me and anyone else to see what they're doing. The setup facilitates working together and in-depth discussions about what the kids are doing and the reasons why they think their actions make sense. Towards the only one group hit upon the 'best' way to solve a particular problem, but it was easy to then have that group explain it to everyone else.

Now in theory it's possible to replicate all of that with the right tools, but we don't have those tools and even if we did it'd take time to get used to them. And there'd still be a host of other issues, like older siblings having to take care of younger ones, the difficulty of picking up on social cues, the lack of motivation because being at school with your friends is more fun for your average student than staying at home, and how keeping attendance and assessing who's working and who's slacking off is so much more time consuming when you can't just glance around the classroom.

The average student at my school suffers from a lack of motivation, social learning opportunities, and a lack of any kind of learning activity of an experimental or practical nature.",,1598778109,{},g3c3x7l,False,t3_ij18dx,False,True,t1_g3bl1kk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ij18dx/teachers_who_are_resigning_and_retiring_across/g3c3x7l/,1598778120,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Because the wages they are paying teachers is to attract the best. If a private school can pay 50-100% more for the same job with a smaller class size it's an attractive offer for many people.

All of those things play a part but I think teaching can change views on education. There is undoubtedly success stories from disadvantaged neighbourhoods as well. If anything those kids need a role model and a champion more than anyone else.

They do change, both for the better and for worse. For example, china has been much more transparent about covid than they were about other problems. Not perfect, not transparent enough, but more transparent than ever before. 

On the negative end, china has took more than a few lessons from america's way of suppressing muslims through ""anti-terrorism"". Internally, there were several attacks happened in western china and the government swiftly build re-education camps, taking a lesson out of guantanamo bay. Terrible and shitty stuff. 

India has its own problems though. Caste system for example. While officially abolished, continues to affect indian society today. Some indians treating fellow indians like trash. Some treat non-indians like trash. Their muslims are also facing discrimination and suppression: https://www.hrw.org/report/2020/04/09/shoot-traitors/discrimination-against-muslims-under-indias-new-citizenship-policy All in all extremely unfortunate. 

The workers are also not as brainwashed as u think either. Don't u see the kind of discrimination u are displaying right now? ""Oh, all black people are savages."" ""The educated ones are more civilized but the rest are savages."" No. The worker class is not brainwashed. Billions of them were lifted out of poverty in their lifetime. If u started ur life finding it hard to have a proper meal only to have the government step in to help u, won't u love ur government?

It is the same for the working class everywhere. If they believe that the government has or will make their lives better, they will support it. Why is MAGA so successful among the less educated? Because the usa government has been telling the less educated that ""it is ur fault to be less educated"" for a long time. But trump says ""it's everyone else's fault"" instead.

Your statement is therefore a strawman as I never argued that people would “magically stopped being sick because they stop testing” - that’s your addition. 

Poeple don’t magically will show up in statistics without being tested. 

They would remain undetected, especially as many covid cases are mild or completely asymptotic. 

With less tests, less people would be detected and get into the statistics.


Let me demonstrate it with a game: 
you have 100 balls in a sack. 
90 are yellow
10 are purple

If you dig into the sack 3 times what is your chance that you get 1 purple ball given that you don’t put back in the sack what you already picked? 

If you dig into the sack 50 times do you have more chance of getting a purple ball than trying to grab one in 3 tries?

Look at Disney. They successfully created a bubble for the NBA, which still has *zero* cases. They are extremely strict about masks and have gotten a lot of heat for not making medical exemptions at the parks.

I’m a three times Teacher of the Year, exceeds on 23 years of evaluations, have a masters plus in Ed, ESOL endorsed, bilingual/bicultural, decent with tech and like virtual teaching, and I’m now willing to throw away much of my expected pension for a change. I’m also, like so many others, deeply entrenched in this profession and the bubble of being a teacher so it’s hard for me to imagine doing anything else. My spouse and most of our friends were/are teachers. I was raised by two generations of teachers. It has been my passion and my calling. 

Any ideas? I’m looking at online teacher/tutoring jobs, corporate training jobs (I’m not a great public speaker with adult crowds but awesome in the classroom and can do better than any of the professional trainers the ed companies have been sending my county for virtual teacher trainings.), and voice work for audio books (No acting background but I’ve been praised for my engaging read alouds). I’ve also considered a collection of gig jobs, like InstaCart. I need to clear $2500-3K a month for my animals (left over from raising kids/hobby farming days) and to beef up our savings. My husband and I have TriCare because he’s 100% disabled veteran so I’m lucky not to need healthcare. He can cover our mortgage and basic bills but there’s not much left after. We live in an expensive area but don’t want to downsize and move until after our eldest pets die in 1-2 years and after COVID, which will likely be around the same time. We’d planned for me to early retire at that point, dramatically cut our household expenses by moving to a smaller home in a cheaper area, and live off his pension until mine kicked in at 65. We also are looking at moving abroad. 

At 48, I am finally at a decent pay grade in teaching and this was going to be the year I banked it away to finally save for a retirement outside of my pension (sold all our stocks &amp; cashed in investments when swamped in debt from medical and raising a family on a two teacher income but mostly debt free now). The first two weeks of bungled preplanning from my large district has just about broken me. Now, there’s talk we have to go back into the classroom by mid fall and all virtual teaching will phase out by mid winter. We haven’t even begun to have time to plan for actual instruction and school starts early Sept. My last planning week is booked with professional trainings (mostly useless) and individual meetings with families.

&gt;The 2-meter guideline has been around for a long time. In 1897, German bacteriologist Carl Flugge demonstrated that pathogens contained in large droplets expelled from the respiratory tract could spread disease. Flugge recommended a 1- to 2-meter safe distance, which over the years became entrenched scientific belief.

This is not some old foundational formula pertaining to fluid dynamics, it's just an old guideline that wasn't proven in any way even at the time. Carl Flugge was not studying the details of how virus particles propagate, he didn't even know what a virus was or that it caused the respiratory illnesses he was studying. He was literally just trying to convince people that exhaled gasses were related to the reason catching a cold happens more often with proximity to a sick person, because that was not an established fact at the time. By the time we figured out that viruses are particles, Carl Flugge was dead.

Math and physics are fundamentally different to fields like biology and medicine. Math isn't just a working theory based on limited observations about the natural world, it's a way of describing fundamental truths that can actually be proven. Medicine is a best guess attempt at keeping ourselves from fucking dying, and we often discover that the assumptions we were working with were straight up wrong.

This article makes it sound a bit like they could be stopping and starting cycle to check to for base threshold of found virus, which doesn't seem reasonable.

I agree 40 cycles seems a bit high, but I think a more sensitive setting made a lot of sense initially given how the samples are acquired. I have no idea how the virus is distributed in the nose, and then transferred from swab to tube, but I have to assume sometimes a person is positive but the swab misses some virus. Yes they could probably lower the cycles, but what could that mean for people genuinely early in incubation?

The ""solution"" they are proposing - to test people again 6-15 hours later to catch the virus when it has replicated further seems really logistically difficult. Between having a more sensitive test and asking people to isolate out of an abundance of caution versus having them come back again to run a different test - it's cheaper and easier to do the former. 

We're barely managing to get a handle on testing as it is.

[],,CoffeeContingencies,,,[],,,,text,t2_77fbl50z,False,False,[],"One other big reason teachers are being required to be in the buildings teaching remotely is equity with their special ed teachers.  Some of us SPED teachers have students in with us 5 days full time even if the rest of the school system is remote because many of our students really can’t do distance learning. Also, states are terrified of lawsuits from parents when the IEPs aren’t being met.

SPED teachers are in the exact same teacher unions, on the same teacher salary scales and won’t get extra pay for working in person. It is just not equitable to have to put our lives on the line while regular ed teachers get to teach from the comfort of their living rooms. Also, our students are gross- many require high levels of personal care and will not tolerate masks (which aren’t required due to their disabilities). Many school districts are now requiring all teachers to work from their classrooms in an attempt to level the playing field. 

In my state, new guidance urged district to allow teachers to bring their personal children in with them to their classrooms OR their children are now considered part of the higher risk group of students (special ed, ELL....) who are getting first priority of in person teaching so their parents can work.  However, IMO this makes the special ed staff and students even more vulnerable to COVID because now there are more people in the building, the janitors need to clean all the rooms and not just the few being used for in person learning and it potentially takes away PPE resources that we could be using to keep ourselves and students safer while teaching in person.  None of this is mandated so many districts have said fuck it (either to teaching remotely from their rooms or allowing their children in with them).

There is no good answer to this issue. But know I am salty and getting more bitter by the day that regular ed teachers are fighting having to go in because they think that the buildings aren’t physically safe or that they need childcare without even stopping to think that a small % of the school is in person either way. It’s disheartening to know I am in the same Union and essentially being ignored because it’s what is best for my students. If I don’t teach them who will?  But at the same time, why  is my life being put in jeopardy while Karen is teaching English from her living room when we are supposed to be equal in the school district’s eyes!?",,1598773499,{},g3bzcb7,False,t3_ij18dx,False,True,t1_g3b9klu,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ij18dx/teachers_who_are_resigning_and_retiring_across/g3bzcb7/,1598773510,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

The US and Brazil are gaining around 4 deaths/million every day whilst most of the countries above them in the table are static. There are five countries ahead of the US within 60 deaths/M. If all those countries remained static the US would overtake them in 15 days.

If that continues in September Brazil and the US will be 5th and 6th worst for death rate by end of Sept.

Here are key anchor points to the extensive scientific literature that establishes that wearing surgical masks and respirators (e.g., ""N95"") does not reduce the risk of contracting a verified illness:

• Jacobs, J. L. et al. (2009) ""Use of surgical face masks to reduce the incidence of the common cold among health care workers in Japan: A randomized controlled trial,"" American Journal of Infection Control, Volume 37, Issue 5, 417 - 419.
N95-masked health-care workers (HCW) were significantly more likely to experience headaches. Face mask use in HCW was not demonstrated to provide benefit in terms of cold symptoms or getting colds.

• Cowling, B. et al. (2010) ""Face masks to prevent transmission of influenza virus: A systematic review,"" Epidemiology and Infection, 138(4), 449-456. DOI:10.1017/S0950268809991658
None of the studies reviewed showed the benefit of wearing a mask in either HCW or community members in households (H). See summary Tables 1 and 2 therein.

• bin-Reza et al. (2012), ""The use of masks and respirators to prevent transmission of influenza: a systematic review of the scientific evidence,"" Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 6(4), 257-267.
""There were 17 eligible studies. [...] None of the studies established a conclusive relationship between mask/respirator use and protection against inﬂuenza infection.""

• Smith, J.D. et al. (2016) ""Effectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks in protecting health care workers from acute respiratory infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis"", CMAJ Mar 2016, cmaj.150835; DOI: 10.1503/cmaj.150835
""We identified 6 clinical studies ... In the meta-analysis of the clinical studies, we found no significant difference between N95 respirators and surgical masks in the associated risk of (a) laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, (b) influenza-like illness, or (c) reported work-place absenteeism.""

• Offeddu, V. et al. (2017) ""Effectiveness of Masks and Respirators Against Respiratory Infections in Healthcare Workers: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"" Clinical Infectious Diseases, Volume 65, Issue 11, 1 December 2017, Pages 1934-1942, https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/cix681

• Radonovich, L.J. et al. (2019) ""N95 Respirators vs. Medical Masks for Preventing Influenza Among Health Care Personnel: A Randomized Clinical Trial"", JAMA. 2019; 322(9): 824-833. DOI:10.1001/jama.2019.11645
""Among 2862 randomized participants, 2371, completed the study and accounted for 5180 HCW-seasons. ... Among outpatient health care personnel, N95 respirators vs. medical masks as worn by participants in this trial resulted in no significant difference in the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza.""

• Long, Y. et al. (2020) ""Effectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks against influenza: A systematic review and meta-analysis"", J Evid Based Med. 2020; 1- 9. https://doi.org/10.1111/jebm.12381

No RCT study with verified outcome shows a benefit for HCW or community members in households to wearing a mask or respirator. There is no such study. There are no exceptions. Likewise, no study exists that shows a benefit from a broad policy to wear masks in public.

Furthermore, if there were any benefit to wearing a mask, because of the blocking power against droplets and aerosol particles, then there should be more benefit from wearing a respirator (N95) compared to a surgical mask, yet several large meta-analyses, and all the RCT, prove that there is no such relative benefit. Masks and respirators do not work.
Many potential harms may arise from broad public policies to wear masks, and the following unanswered questions arise:

• Do used and loaded masks become sources of enhanced transmission, for the wearer and others?
• Do masks become collectors and retainers of pathogens that the mask wearer would otherwise avoid when breathing without a mask?
• Are large droplets captured by a mask atomized or aerosolized into breathable components? Can virions escape an evaporating droplet stuck to a mask fiber?
• What are the dangers of bacterial growth on a used and loaded mask?
• How do pathogen-laden droplets interact with environmental dust and aerosols captured on the mask?
• What are long-term health effects on HCW, such as headaches, arising from impeded breathing?
• Are there negative social consequences to a masked society?
• Are there negative psychological consequences of wearing a mask, as a fear-based behavioral modification?
• What are the environmental consequences of mask manufacturing and disposal?
• Do the masks shed fibers or substances that are harmful when inhaled?

How on Earth could they not have at least made a plan B if we were to distance for a long time? My district didn't and the Superintendent even admitted ""I thought it was going to end in May."" Meanwhile... Here we are. I've been teaching online for two weeks. Personally it's fine for me. I'm comfortable with it. But there's no direction from district or build admin. Our staff meeting next week is to brainstorm how to teach online?! WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING THIS IN FUCKING MARCH!

The district promised parents that we'd have comprehensive training. On paper, during our PD week we did it. But in reality, we didn't. We had no training. We have our same ol' bullshit PD we have every year. I blew the whistle. Or at least tried. I set up an anonymous e-mail and e-mailed my Principal's boss and a couple others including the Superintendent. I got no response. I got no online training. 

In the macro realm of things. If COVID has taught me anything it's that this country has no leadership. Leaders get paid more because they supposedly are best equipped to handle such things. They aren't. The have no clue and aren't even willing to risk bending the status quo. They all seem to think they can shuffle papers around until this is over. From schools to districts, to politicians (both parties, Trump nor Biden will effectively address the looming health and economic crisis). The idea that we have social organization is a farce.

You're right. Children who grow up fat from eating the shitty food their parents fed them don't also go on to produce children who have poor eating habits

*Even a child can decide to not eat hot dogs and areas where there is secondhand smoke.*
Kids don't choose their homes.  Think of how stupid you sound here.

*2% of the population of my town is about 60 of my neighbors.*
COVID doesn't kill 2% of the population. It is 2% of those infected.  Which if you add up current aggregate positive case counts in the USA is 2% of the population.  2% of 2% of your town of 3,000 is 1 person. Math is hard

*These sick and dying people are your fellow Americans and you are trying to conflate consuming hot dogs and cigs with a deadly, highly contagious virus rather than acknowledge the fact that people who attended Sturgis contracted and spread COVID. What the fuck is wrong with you?*

Well, Secondhand smoke kills 40,000 Americans every year and an estimated 13M children in the US are obese.  Few in those populations actually have choice to avoid the behaviors that put them at serious risk of health complications.  I get it. Covid is bad. but it isn't ebola and the country has a dozen other major public health crises to tackle which all have sky-rocketingly higher mortality rates than COVID.

So in fact, it is you who is the problem because you lack a fundamental understanding of how numbers work and rather than rationally look at the situation and realize that in a country of ~350,000,000 people that some of them are going to die from time to time and occasionally, they'll die of something other than a peaceful passing in their sleep at 99 years old.  I've heard your type before.  ""lets lock down the entire country and not go anywhere and if it saves 1 life, it will be worth it""  Do you feel the same way about cigarettes?  booze? cars? boats? Airplanes? People get food poisoning from processing mistakes or their own carelessness so should we just all be forced to eat Soylent? I mean, fuck, why should we even be allowed to leave the house?  Do you know that even before COVID, if you had the sniffles, you could get an older person sick and kill them? It is painfully obvious who we need to protect at this point but doomers like you are actually stopping the progress because you think tens of millions of kids are going to die if they return to schools despite &lt;20 kids under the age of 18 dying of COVID to date and still, there's a dozen other mortality factors that kill children at higher rates.",,1598803696,{},g3d80xe,False,t3_ij60vl,False,True,t1_g3d6bei,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ij60vl/colorado_lists_20_virus_cases_from_sturgis/g3d80xe/,1598804083,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

A clinical trial is only ethical in a state of clinical equipoise — basically, if you don’t know whether the placebo or the treatment (in this case, the vaccine) is going to have better outcomes. However, because you don’t want to unnecessarily expose either group to increased risk, the trials will have a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) that monitors the data at regular intervals as it comes in to evaluate whether the trial should continue.

Think about it this way: if the initial data showed that the vaccine was killing people, would you want to keep the trial going and administer more of the vaccine, or would you want to stop the trial immediately and communicate that to the FDA for rejection? Obviously, you’d do the latter — it would be unethical to keep administering one arm of the trial if you have data showing that the other is better.

It’s a very similar concept here; if you have data that shows that the vaccine is protective to both a clinically significant and statistically significant level without significant incidence of significant side effects, it is unethical to continue administering placebos because you have data showing the vaccine is better than placebo. At that point, the trial is ended prematurely, and the data is reported to the FDA as an application for authorization.

I’ll be honest, when Hahn made these comments, my first reaction was to be startled that this *wasn’t* always very clearly the plan. He’s probably just explaining it because for the first time in a while, the entire country is very interested in the results of a clinical trial, and people are just now learning about how it actually works.",,1598816522,{},g3e1krz,False,t3_ijeogh,False,True,t1_g3d5yo1,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ijeogh/fda_commissioner_says_hes_willing_to_fasttrack/g3e1krz/,1598818952,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

That means only 10,000 people in the USA died of Coronavirus—not 183,000. That means only 50,000 WORLDWIDE have died from Coronavirus. NOT 844,000. 

94% of the reported deaths are from completely different unrelated underlying health conditions from the host. 

WE ARE BEING PLAYED. 

We need to open the world economy back up these numbers in the grand scheme of things does NOT warrant a worldwide shutdown and worldwide economic collapse. WAKE UP.

&gt;So you're going to arbitrarily draw the line and risk human lives just because it'd cost money to produce goggles?

Nope. I did not say the price was too high. I said the cost was too high. As in we don't have the facilities or materials. Why are you pretending I did not already say this?

What do you want to stop making so we can make these goggles? And we have not even started on the suits, gloves, tape, etc.

&gt;What retarded logic is this? You could say the exact same of masks. ""hurr durr if you can't produce enough of one thing, you mustn't be able to produce enough of another thing"". 

Yes, because we live in a world with finite resources, time, and engineers.

You are demanding that everyone wear goggles and hazmat suits when we *still don't have enough to properly outfit health care workers.*

What stops so that we can ma ufacture all of this PPE for you?

&gt;This coming from the guy who's been yelling and screaming about joggers not wearing masks because you're too wilfully ignorant to read any scientific literature on the subject. You don't give a fuck about what the science is, just about satisfying your paranoid delusions.

Still waiting to hear where you got your CBR and MOPP training from since you are pretending to know everything about these advanced PPE systems.

Still waiting to hear how you are going to will all of this extra stuff into existence since you don't seem to understand that this stuff does not just appear out of thin air.

Qur'an condemns apostates without allowing them redemption or forgiveness;

&gt;But those who reject Faith after they accepted it, and then go on adding to their defiance of Faith, – never will their repentance be accepted; for they are those who have (of set purpose) gone astray.

- Qur'an [3:90](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2002.02.0006%3Asura%3D3%3Averse%3D90)

Qur'an promotes the killing of apostates if they do not peacefully reconvert;

&gt;You will find others who desire that they should be safe from you and secure from their own people; as often as they are sent back to the mischief they get thrown into it headlong; therefore if they do not withdraw from you, and (do not) offer you peace and restrain their hands, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them; and against these We have given you a clear authority.

- Qur'an [4:91](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2002.02.0006%3Asura%3D4%3Averse%3D91), the Arabic version is even more brutal.

Here's more:

&gt;Make ye no excuses: ye have rejected Faith after ye had accepted it. If We pardon some of you, We will punish others amongst you, for that they are in sin.

- Qur'an [9:66](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2002.02.0006%3Asura%3D9%3Averse%3D66)

And here's a verse literally saying that Allah will unleash his wrath on you if you reject your faith;

&gt;He who disbelieves in Allah after his having believed, not he who is compelled while his heart is at rest on account of faith, but he who opens (his) breast to disbelief-- on these is the wrath of Allah, and they shall have a grievous chastisement.

- Qur'an [16:106](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2002.02.0006%3Asura%3D16%3Averse%3D106)

And before you start with the usual apologism, the Arabic versions are linked below the English translation, the message is as clear in Arabic as it is in English, there's no such thing as ""lost in translation"" here, the Qur'an explicitly encourages violence against atheists, there's no ""context"", no ""misinterpretation"", the message is as clear as day; Islam wants me dead.

As a result, many apostate Arabic philosophers of the 11th and 15th century were banished, imprisoned, or killed off, so if you're wondering why the Islamic world never went through an age of enlightnement; this is one of the reasons why.

In addition, as of 2013, the [overwhelming majority](https://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/) are in favour of the death penalty for apostasy.

-

The measure was a pledge made by Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's leftwing coalition government, which took office in January, bringing together his Socialist party with far-left Podemos as the junior partner.
   
The scheme -- approved in late May -- aims to guarantee an income of 462 euros ($546) per month for an adult living alone, while for families, there would be an additional 139 euros per person, whether adult or child, up to a monthly maximum of 1,015 euros per home. It is expected to cost state coffers three billion euros ($3.5 billion) a year.
   
The government decided to bring forward the launch of the programme because of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has hit Spain hard and devastated its economy, causing queues at food banks to swell.
   
Of the 750,000 applications which were filed since June 15 when the government started accepting requests, 143,000 -- or 19 percent -- have been analysed and 80,000 were approved, according to a social security statement issued on August 20.
 

 
'Months of waiting'
-
 
But Spain main civil servant's union, CSIF, paints a darker picture. ""Nearly 99 percent of requests have not been processed,"" a union spokesman, Jose Manuel Molina, told AFP.
- 
The social security ministry has only really analysed 6,000 applications while 74,000 households that already receive financial aid were awarded the basic income automatically, he added.
   
For hundreds of thousands of other households, the wait is stressful. Marta Sanchez, a 42-year-old mother of two from the southern city of Seville, said she applied for the scheme on June 26 but has heard nothing since.
   
""That is two months of waiting already, when in theory this was a measure that was taken so no one ends up in the streets,"" she added.
   
Sanchez lost her call centre job during Spain's virus lockdown while her husband lost his job as a driver. The couple has had to turn to the Red Cross for the first time for food.
   
""Thank God my mother and sister pay our water and electricity bills,"" she said, adding their landlord, a relative, has turned a blind eye to the unpaid rent.

 
'Rushed everything'
-
 
A spokeswoman for the ministry acknowledged that the rhythm ""was perhaps a bit slower than expected"" but she said the government was working to ""automate many procedures"" so processing times should become faster from now on.
   
""The launch of a benefit is always difficult ... and this situation is not an exception,"" she added.
   
But Molina said this was a new situation, that was made worse by years of budget cuts to the public service which has lost 25 percent of its staff over the past decade.
   
""The problem is that they rushed everything, did it without training and a huge lack of staff,"" he added.
   
The social security branch charged with the basic income scheme has only 1,500 civil servants, who also process most pension applications, Molina said.
   
These officials are facing an ""avalanche"" of requests, which already match the number of pension requests received in an entire year, he added.
   
About 500 temporary workers have been recruited as reinforcements but their assistance is limited because they do not have the status of civil servant, so they cannot officially approve requests for financial aid.
   
Demand is expected to increase. The government has said the measure was expected to benefit some 850,000 homes, affecting a total of 2.3 million people -- 30 percent of whom were minors.
   
When the scheme was launched the government said all it would take is a simple online form, but this is a problem for many low-income families without computers and internet access, especially since the waiting time for an in-person meeting to apply is about two months, according to the CSIF union",,1598805516,{},g3dc3th,True,t3_ijfnd5,False,True,t3_ijfnd5,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ijfnd5/spains_basic_income_scheme_hits_backlog_deadend/g3dc3th/,1598806113,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

I hate to sound this bad but have you heard the reports of children dying from it or having long lasting issues like breathing problems after they recover? The vaccine is due to be out by the beginning of the year. Your kid can’t wait until then? You really don’t want to get this virus.

It makes learning about money and it should be enough by itself. 

All of this, ofc, course back to funding education as a whole. If there was enough to go around, schools wouldn't be fighting over it/competing for who gets paid.

Even assuming not a single child will die -- the fact that they don't know that..that we're sending 6-12 year old's back to school with a non-zero chance that they'll be killed by a deadly virus they have no way of properly understanding -- is so completely reprehensible imo. 

No matter what we do as teachers or administrators, there's no *way* school will be normal this year. Kids have that horrible prospect hanging over their heads. At our building they have to wear masks the whole time.  *All day.* Their desks are socially distanced and all are surrounded by plexiglass. They can't get within 6 feet of each other. They don't leave the room under any circumstance except to use the bathroom. Only one kid can be in the hallway at a time. On *some* days they can go outside for recess. Same for PE. 

All ""special"" classes (Art, Library, etc) will take place in their regular classroom. They can't visit the library, or the gym, or the art room. They'll be eating their lunches in the classrooms as well. They can't sit together on the bus. 

And this is better than staying at home a few more months until we're at least *more* sure that we've got this under control? I've been saying from the beginning that kids, at least elementary, should *not* go back to school until they can do so in a way that represents some kind of normalcy. Anyone who has ever taught elementary will tell you that it's difficult to get some/most kids cooperating and working even on a good day. Now? Do you really expect these kids to do their work under the above circumstances?

And people will say that it's important because of socialization. I agree in a way. Socialization is actually what I believe to be *the* single most important aspect of elementary school. But what kind of socialization do you expect them to get in the aforementioned environment? I think this may actually become a *negative* influence on the way these children socialize going forward.

First, your claim that you want to work... when it's safe... is ridiculous. 

We know the odds of a young child getting seriously sick with Covid. It's not any worse than a dozen other things they do everyday (well maybe not kids these days - seems like their parents are walking them to the bus stop even when they're juniors in high school, lol). 

This is about the same for most teachers under the age of 55 or so. 

For older teachers or those with some actual health problem,  I don't have a good solution. I would slowly make them realize that no magic vaccine is probably going to be ready soon, if ever, and Covid is just a part of life now for the next few years, at least.

 If they don't want to take the risk, it's time to early retire them at a reduced pension if they're within approx. 7 years of it, or tough shit if not.

A pandemic is essentially an act of God like a hurricane or tornado.  The private sector lower and middle class workers  have already taken the vast brunt of the pain, but now public employees are up. Based on the collapse of almost all state and local tax revenue, this pain isn't going to be isolated to teachers. And even if Biden wins, I don't see Congress passing a huge bailout to most states.",,1598759748,{},g3bibbf,False,t3_iil8me,False,True,t1_g3b8cxd,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iil8me/andover_teachers_refuse_to_enter_school_buildings/g3bibbf/,1598760739,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Because men were more susceptible than women, and because women at that time were not breadwinners in a family setting, many dependents were thrust into widespread poverty in the wake of the pandemic flu. Countries that were more adapted to science and the scientific method felt disillusioned at the widespread death and devastation and for an amount of time, became slightly less scientific in their approach and embraced alternative medicine much more readily. Conversely, countries that had been slow to adopt the scientific method accelerated that adoption.

The divot the Spanish flu put in the economies of first world countries was massive. The economic devastation lasted for more than a generation. However, in the wake of the devastation, widespread pandemic and epidemic surveillance rose to the fore and socialized healthcare became much more popular.

Those were massive sea changes. The world after the Spanish flu was not the same as the world before the Spanish flu in both good and bad ways. Laura Spinney lays this out very well in her 2018 book Pale Rider, which talks about the Spanish flu of 1918 and the positive and negative long-lasting effects.

I think this actually illustrates an important point very well. Trying to get people not to go to the beach indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of what makes a situation dangerous. A beach is about as good as it gets for ventilation and the ability to spread out. 

I strongly agree that consistency in messaging is critical, and has been handled very poorly so far. This isn't just an effort to optimize though, they're trying to course correct. Some of messaging (and by that I mean things like the photo of a beach at the top of basically every article about quarantine since May) has been consistent, but misleading when it comes to forming useful conclusions about how to effectively manage risk without total isolation.

Personally I think they just need to get the point of the importance of ventilation across, not try to mess with distance requirements. The real takeaway from this chart is that there isn't really a safe distance in a poorly ventilated space. That messaging, combined with trying to shift stigma away from being seen outdoors in public spaces, would accomplish everything that this chart does.",,1598746127,{},g3avon4,False,t3_iioc3o,False,True,t1_g3903rx,/r/Coronavirus/comments/iioc3o/the_6foot_rule_is_outdated_researchers_devise/g3avon4/,1598749550,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2768952](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2768952)

This was their conclusion: 

""Our analyses suggest children younger than 5 years with mild to moderate COVID-19 have high amounts of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in their nasopharynx compared with older children and adults. Our study is limited to detection of viral nucleic acid, rather than infectious virus, although SARS-CoV-2 pediatric studies reported a correlation between higher nucleic acid levels and the ability to culture infectious virus.[5](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2768952#pld200036r5) Thus, young children can potentially be important drivers of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the general population, as has been demonstrated with respiratory syncytial virus, where children with high viral loads are more likely to transmit.[6](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2768952#pld200036r6) Behavioral habits of young children and close quarters in school and day care settings raise concern for SARS-CoV-2 amplification in this population as public health restrictions are eased. In addition to public health implications, this population will be important for targeting immunization efforts as SARS-CoV-2 vaccines become available.""

&amp;#x200B;

Just because a specific age group has a lowered imuno-response/less complications from a specific virus, doesn't mean that age group can't be great spreaders of that virus. 

Chicken Pox is a milder form of Shingles: Shingles s is significantly more aggressive in older adults, but doesn't spread as well in adult populations. However Chicken Pox is very contagious among children, but exhibits often in a mild rash, fever and a bit of a cough.

Not only may children actually be *more likely* to spread it than adults *physiologically*, but children are also more likely to be spreaders *socio*/*psychologically*.

The risk-behavior of children and teens is significantly higher than the average adult population. Children may not have the faculties to understand the importance of social distancing measures; or if they can understand they may not have the willpower, discipline, or social-maturity to take social distancing measures seriously. Risk-reward analysis on such an inter-personal, socially complex level doesn't usually come in until 23 - 25 years old, with the development of the frontal cortex.

There are ""adults"" in this nation having boarder-line psychotic breaks over having to put on a piece of cloth over their face while entering a store for the 15-30 minutes they are shopping; and yet somehow we as a society (US centric here sorry) came to the conclusion that scholastic institutions full of under-developed, hormonal human brains would be able to maintain proper social distancing for upwards of 7 hours a day, multiple days a week, for multiple consecutive months. *No potential problems there at all:* **Adults can't be made to wear masks for an hour; but making children social distance for 7 hours, and there won't be an issues!**

The cognitive dissonance in this nation is truly alarming.

The idea that the transmission of SARs-CoV-2 would be less in areas where the population skews towards younger people (i.e schools) is laughable and insane.

Children are massive viral/bacteria carriers and spreaders; there is a reason we say ""*Children are germ factories*"". Throughout history and into our modern day, young people have been tremendously effective vectors for all kinds of illnesses and plagues.

This is especially true since there is a coordinated effort in some states to keep case counts and deaths from the public, i.e., Florida, Georgia, and a few others. There was also the completely transparent attempt to try to divert CDC data to another agency. From the New York Times,

&gt;“If we only counted lab-confirmed deaths, we all agree that we will undercount the number of individuals that have died,” said Janet Hamilton, the executive director of the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists, a group that helps the C.D.C. [define cases and deaths](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/) from disease.

Again, if you are trying to paint a rosier picture, and it's clear that you are, you're the one in denial, not me. So along with idiot doctors and politicians, there are still plenty of run of the mill idiots.

As my father has always said no matter how much you try to assimilate and think of yourself
as an 'American', you'll always be an Asian in the eyes of most Americans. It becomes crystal clear
when you travel overseas too other Asian countries. You're a novelty, people look at you weird if you tell them you're an American, and you definitely do not get treated the same as Americans(Whites). You come too the realization you being a Korean-American is a rarity. You're a part of a very small % of people.

Also FYI you should look up the history of WW2 and what they did too the Japanese Americans.

Either way, we need all information about PCR results in order to make better public health policy decisions. It doesn't require massive changes to existing infrastructure when it comes to public health policy, I'm not sure why you're acting as if nothing can be done with what we know now. 

&gt;This thread. Bottom line: If we are stuck w pcr we should use all of the data it produces (ct values) to make smarter decisions about whether a person is infectious and should quarantine or not. 1/2

First off, a lot of these secondary conditions are caused by the bodies immune response to COVID, like respiratory failure. Middle aged adults don't just randomly get respiratory failure out of nowhere.

Second, notice how a lot of these secondary conditions aren't deadly. Obesity? Extremely unhealthy but again, most people don't just randomly die from it. There's millions of Americans living with heart conditions that don't die.

Finally you can look at excess deaths for the year to get a good indicator of how many people have died from COVID. There's been around 200k excess deaths, meaning 200k more than a normal year adjusted for population size, so if people were dying with these conditions regardless we wouldn't have 200k excess deaths.

Prices haven increased because of the football program. In case you missed it, tuition prices have skyrocketed everywhere and Alabama's football program won its first national championship in 1925. Not exactly a new phenomenon.

The athletic department has literally given millions of dollars back to the university. Like just handed them a check. The school has more money because the football program exists.

I understand and agree that the school has problems, but the football program is not the cause. And because the athletic department turns a profit (unlike almost every single other university in the country!), there's no need to change the investment in the football program at Alabama. Why not go yell at Stanford for spending over $50M from the university budget on athletics?

I'm not looking for a school to go to. I already have my bachelor's and masters from Alabama, from one of those highly ranked programs. It would have been significantly more expensive (3x or more) for me to go out of state to somewhere like GA, for no gain in rankings in my degree program. And uab doesn't offer the degree I got. Not sure why I'd consider them.

&gt;Finland has tested all children with mild symptoms since April 15 while Sweden almost never tested them even in schools where teachers were infected and died. It is therefore fallacious to conclude the number of positive cases was the same in Finland and Sweden at the time of the study.

If you read the actual report:

&gt;*There is no difference in the overall incidence of the laboratory confirmed covid-19 cases in the age group 1-19 years in the two countries and the number of laboratory confirmed cases* ***does not fluctuate with school closure or change in testing policy in Finland****. In Sweden, the number of laboratory confirmed cases is affected by change in testing policy.*

I'm confused. Don't you think both Finnish and Swedish scientists considered these differences in their conclusions? Why don't you ask Dr Hanna Nohynek, and Dr Otto Helve from Finnish THL if they thought this was an accurate comparison? 

Coincidentally, Dr Hanna Nohynek was involved in this recently published [fairly rigorous study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343329234_Transmission_of_SARS-CoV-2_following_exposure_in_school_settings_experience_from_two_Helsinki_area_exposure_incidents) on a couple of outbreaks in schools in Helsinki. Its conclusion:

&gt;Interpretation: When the index was a child, no school transmission was identified, while the occurrence of an adult case led to a 16% AR. Further cases were evidenced in 3 families, but other transmission chains were plausible. It is likely that transmission from children to adults is limited.

I'm sure it means nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Sweden has started to test more in June, which is exactly the time period where the report stop. Today the numbers of positive cases for the 0-19 years old is 4478 in Sweden vs 792 in Finland.

Yeah. I'm guessing they were only interested in comparing the period when school policy was different in Sweden and Finland. Remember that schools opened again in mid May in Finland. It's right about that time. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;3) Sweden has had 14 kids in ICU compared to 1 in Finland. That number is now 31 in Sweden. Fewer tests, more ICU cases. How strange...

More infections overall would lead to more ICU cases right? Or how do you think it works?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;4) Sweden has 50 kids with MISC-C caused by COVID19 while Finland has 0. Not mentioned in the study.

Of course not. That *magazine article* only came out on August 5. Again, does not change the conclusion. However I agree that it is worrying. So far, nobody has died from this condition I believe.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;5) In Sweden, at least 1 death in the 0-9age group. Not mentioned in the study.

If you read what was written about this case it seems like this child was already very sick, probably very young, and it is not clear if this child attended school.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;7) Sweden's experts of the FHM urged for keeping schools open in order to reach herd immunity more quickly. Which means they knew children helped to spread infection.

No they didn't. They made their decision to keep schools open based on data from China and other places.

Look, I get that you don't trust conclusions drawn by FHM but would you accept conclusions drawn by [ECDC](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19-risk-assessment-paediatric-inflammatory-multisystem-syndrome-15-May-2020.pdf)? Check page 7, ""Infection and transmission"". They say the same thing as FHM. It's not a conspiracy dude.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;8) For a long time we didn't know what role the kids had in the spread of infection. Now, we know that asymptomatic children have higher viral loads than hospitalized adults. We also know that children do get sick and sometimes die of covid.

Nobody ever disputed that kids can get sick or die from COVID-19. Maybe Trump, but I don't really consider him a trusted source. The ECDC paper also mentions these newish findings. If this changes anything related to the infectiousness in children is unclear.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;9) In several countries (France, Israel, Germany...) the reopening of schools have led to outbreak of covid. I know all this doesn't matter because the one and only information that can be trusted is the one coming from the official authorities of Sweden. That's why I give you this

Again, nobody is saying it cannot happen. Evidence of a child getting infected by another child does not disprove the general conclusion here.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;10) According the FHM this is NOT a peer-reviewed study, it was ""just a quick situation-report and nothing more"".

I understand your objections to this report from FHM. It is very unscientific and the data probably needs more work. However it supports what was already known from the outbreak in China and across the world at this stage, Children are not a driver in this pandemic. That was my fundamental point. It was never ""they don't get sick or die"".",,1598795707,{},g3cqw9u,False,t3_ii9zz5,False,True,t1_g39zfmv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ii9zz5/severe_or_fatal_covid19_very_rare_in_children/g3cqw9u/,1598795828,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Actually there are. There’s a lot of different ways we approach this in education research but here are a couple:

1.	If a teacher adopts a new teaching style and scores on a standard metric improve while other teacher’s (who did not adopt that teaching style) scores remain constant, than it is safe to conclude that the new teaching style (and therefore the teacher) “made a difference”.
2.	We can also trace this from institutions. We can track how the scores of students belonging to teachers who went through a specific teaching program compare with similar teachers who did not attend the teaching program. These studies often include lots of data, but can be a really strong case for that program. For instance, my program had research studies indicating that my education would, on average, lead to a 10% improvement of scores over other teachers.

In fact, your claim, that teachers do not “make a difference”, or that there is no correlation between student improvement and teacher actions, is disproved weekly by education research. There are so many thousands of factors that can effect the improvement of students in the classroom that it’s honestly overwhelming. If you want to get started I suggest you just google any topic that interests you in education in google scholar.

After the Saab GT 750 was introduced at the New York Motor Show in 1958 with safety belts fitted as standard, the practice became commonplace. **Seatbelts were not popular at first, with only 2% of Ford buyers choosing to pay for a seatbelt in 1956.**

So no, for about 30+ years after seatbelts were invented, people were actively not using their seatbelts and some were doing it completely out of defiance.  That's why the government had to make it mandatory.  Because people were being fuckwads then like you're being now.

Basically the school level admin has been pretty quiet because their “hands are tied” and also we are in a state of constant flux as our district is in state receivership so we didn’t really have a principal until last week.  The superintendent (who came to us from Hillsborough County Fla after “turning the district around”, as well as the commissioner and the governor all adamantly want schools open in person.  This is likely because funding money is tied to that happening. 

For context, our buildings are crumbling, windows and hvac are ancient or nonexistent, bathrooms rarely have soap, mold and leaks... families in low s.e. strata, multigenerational homes, parents who have to keep working because they have no other options. The perfect storm.  

There have been rallies, open forums, surveys, etc. but they doubled down and said ok well push back the start of school by 2 weeks and then definitely be in person. They said 70 percent of families want it but can’t produce the dataset to show it.  

Then, after moving the contractual start date forward two weeks, the added 4 PD days into the end of our summer with less than 2 weeks notice.  In person PD.   

The Union pushed back. The gov/sup/commish asserted that Union is doing all of the complaining but they’re not hearing anything from the actual teachers. (What the?) We all wrote letters up the admin chain requesting that the in person PD be made remote. They said no. 

That’s about when I was like “ok this is ridiculous and I’m not so many years in that I’m losing too much ground” and I noped the eff out.

I’m in an environment where there’s no choice but to be within 6 ft of someone without barriers at various points through out the day.

My husband in a situation where people have been testing positive nearly every time they’re tested.

We’ve been masking since late March or early April even though it wasn’t mandatory in our state until about a month ago.

Our daughter is currently unemployed as her industry was hit hard by Corona. But we’re grateful for that because her being home is one of the few ways we’re able to reduce our exposure risk (besides observing the guidelines of course).

I have ptsd which built to a Crescendo over the course of the thirty years I likely had it before I was diagnosed. It’s from abuse, neglect, witnessing crimes, catching fire, and nearly dying more than once. There’s more but that’s a story for another day.

But this is the single most terrifying thing I’ve ever dealt with.

It’s because I worked so hard to get to where I am now and my life is once again in the hands of people incapable of basic human decency.

I can’t express properly through words just how infuriating that is.

We’re diligent in our mask wearing and following social guidelines but if one person who doesn’t mask or wash their hands exposes us to that illness they don’t believe is real or are intentionally willfully ignorant about

There goes our livelihoods, our savings to purchase a house, our financial health for the rest of our lives, and probably with all that a bit of our sanity.

I was released from therapy and unmedicated for months (close to a year) before all this happened and now I can’t say that anymore.
