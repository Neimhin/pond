You can't solve this through pure technology, because the option for nightclubs to simply not check people coming in always remains.

The nightclubs have been lobbying the government for quite a while to be allowed to reopen, stating that they could do so safely. The government provides them with pretty simple instructions to follow and they fail at doing so.

It's not like checking ID at the door of a nightclub is a new concept. This has been necessary for age checks for an eternity. 

Finally, I'd challenge you to come up with a technological solution that removes the requirement for the ID to be checked along with the QR code. Keeping in mind that the QR code also has to be available in paper form (for people without a compatible smartphone) and that the same QR code should be usable (by the same person) multiple times within the validity period (40 hours after the test).

The system that is in place is fine. It is accessible to anyone, it could be developed rapidly without needing complex physical infrastructure to be rolled out.

You're right that any criticism seems to elicit defensive responses in my experience, both on reddit and in real life. Friends back home act personally insulted if I say ""what's the actual plan?"" Answers like ""Well we don't have covid so the plan is we're just going to keep it that way"". 

All totally ignoring the fact that zero covid is an unstable equilibrium that is not going to be possible to maintain without permanent isolation. People have been successfully terrified by the government to a hysterical degree, and don't want their safety bubble popped.

Companies are recognizing that they can function just fine without extensive travel expenditures and at least reducing those costs is in their best interests.  Meanwhile remote work is here to stay, with many companies keeping it in place for the majority of employees, or moving employees to a hybrid schedule allowing them to reduce overhead in terms of office space.  

Both of those things will make ripples throughout multiple industries, and that will change many lives.  Meanwhile employers are struggling to find workers willing to suffer through pre-COVID conditions, meaning low wages, terrible hours, and general inflexibility or poor working conditions.  They've moved on and found other jobs in other industries after being laid off early in the pandemic, and have no intention of coming back.  This will force small businesses in particular to find ways to pay more while staying afloat, will likely bring about some changes to the way the service industry in particular operates in many places, and those things will also change lives (mostly for the better one would imagine though).  

Other industries will take longer to come back, if they ever reach pre-COVID levels again.  Are you going to be comfortable packing into a movie theater on opening night for a new Star Wars movie?  I'm not sure I will be.  Every cough or throat clear will make me jump.  Small venue indoor concerts?  Sketchy.  Massive cons?  Shit I think I've been to a con that I didn't get sick at once out of a dozen or more that I've been to.  Used to call it nerd flu.  The thought of that now makes me shudder.  I wasn't much of a germaphobe before.  I am now.  I hated flying, but tolerated the shitty conditions because I loved travel.  Now?  I'm paying a lot more attention to what's within a day's drive from me because I don't know how soon I'm going to be excited about being sardined into a metal tube with a few hundred strangers for a couple of hours ever again.

After only 100 ""rolls"" you'd be at a 7% chance of hospitalization - which is roughly the case hospitalization rate over the past year for the US (while people were unvaccinated, and only counting confirmed cases which are universally regarded as being a large underestimate of actual infection totals).

The effectiveness is just 93% drop relative to baseline risk if unvaccinated. From August 2020 to July 2021, the CDC has tracked about 2.3M hospitalizations. That's about 0.7% of the US population hospitalized over the course of one year. A 93% reduction from 0.7% would be 0.05% chance of being hospitalized over the course of a year - but with hospitalizations more common among older people and me being in my 30s, my risk of hospitalization is substantially less than the population average, let's say 0.02% chance given that CDC hospitalization trackers showed my age group with less than half the hospitalization rate of the all ages average.

That would estimate my hospitalization risk over the next year at 1 in 5000. Considering the crude *death* rate for someone my age is about 1 in 500 per year, covid's risk to me at this point is background noise.

For example, Public support for the death penalty is very similar in the two countries, but it's a complete no-no for politicians.

On those issues:

Guns, as I said, are an American oddity that don't fit anywhere on our spectrum.

Abortion only became legal in Northern Ireland in 2019. That fact is probably surprising to a lot of people from England. Attitudes towards religion and gay marriage are also pretty similar in NI to the US Bible belt.

In fact, support for gay marriage is fairy equal across the UK and the US, and it was legalised in both countries at around the same time.

""Socialised"" (lol America) healthcare is something I'd put into the ""economic"" category. It's about the spending of taxpayer money. Additionally, the NHS is often framed as a ""national pride"" issue over here, much like the vaccines.

As for issues where we're to the right of the US, immigration is the one that sticks out the most. In the US, the standard claim on the right is ""I'm against illegal immigration, but I have no problem if people do it the legal way"", and even that attracts some pushback. Over here, people can talk about massively reducing legal immigration to 100k or lower without being seen as outside of the mainstream, and Tory politicians often do so. That would make you a real hardliner in the US.

We're also quite far to the right of the US on drugs. We just legalised medicinal weed under very strict conditions, whereas some US states have had very liberal laws (de facto legalisation) since the 90s. Many states also have de jure legalisation. Public support for it is also much higher (67% vs 52%) in the US.

In terms of idpol in general, we tend to *follow* the US rather than leading it (this sometimes results in blatant nonsense, like protesters shouting ""hands up, don't shoot"" at unarmed British police).",,,1625609757,{},h4advgd,False,t3_oe54nq,False,True,t1_h49uh05,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oe54nq/96_of_british_adults_surveyed_reported_positive/h4advgd/,1625815688,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Let me elaborate a bit on what I meant by the ""at risk"" aspect, yes New Zealand has done exceptionally well at protecting itself from the virus and they've been working tirelessly to catch every possible contact to every case but human nature and the experience of other nations who previously had a handle on the pandemic shows that the delta variant is a different beast given its increased transmissibility, it won't take much for it to quickly spread given the relatively low vaccination rates and the tiny number of people who've recovered due to the stellar work that's been done. But the fact that dispite all the success of keeping the virus out they've still been finding cases on a daily basis.

Of course I hope they don't experience what we've been through over here, we've just decided to let covid rip through the population many of whom are still not vaccinated.

Would I prefer to be in New Zealand's position, of course the death and disruption we have seen here in the UK has been devastating.

&gt;The new screening approach, referred to as Phone Screen Testing (PoST), has been developed by University College London (UCL) researchers at Diagnosis Biotech. By analysing swabs from smartphone screens, as opposed to directly from people, the team found that individuals who tested positive by the regular nasal swabbing PCRs were also positive when samples were taken from phone screens. The findings have been published in eLife.

**A low-cost, non-invasive method**

&gt; This method detected the COVID-19 virus on the phones of 81% to 100% of contagious people with a high viral load, suggesting it is as accurate as antigen lateral flow tests. As PoST is an environmental test, rather than a clinical test, it is both non-invasive and less expensive that a traditional nasal swabbing PCR.

&gt; This means that, not only is it suitable for rollout in lower-income countries, but it also removes the discomfort of current COVID-19 testing options, potentially increasing uptake of regular testing among the general population. In addition, PoST sampling takes less than a minute and does not require medical personnel, which eases mass adoption in big facilities and large-scale applications.

""Canada‚Äôs most representative study to date investigating how many Canadians have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, reveals a mere 2.6% of Canadians tested between November 2020 and April 2021 had developed antibodies resulting from a past infection. Another 1% of Canadians had antibodies due to vaccination, reflecting the fact that vaccination was not widely available during the survey period. This brings the total percentage of Canadians with some form of immunity before the third wave to 3.6%.

...

""About one in three (30.3%) Canadians who had antibodies due to a SARS-CoV-2 infection had never taken a PCR test ‚Äì a nasal or throat swab test for an active infection,‚Äù reveals Mr. Gravel. Among those, 3 out of 4, (76.6%) indicated that it was because they never had symptoms.

‚ÄúAsymptomatic infections are very real,‚Äù comments Dr. Hankins. ‚ÄúMany Canadians who tested positive for antibodies from a previous infection did not know they had COVID-19 and could very easily have spread it to others, although the numbers don‚Äôt tell us how much transmission there was. This reinforces that physical distancing measures and mask- wearing have been the best ways to control the virus, especially before the widespread distribution of vaccines.‚Äù

...

‚ÄúAnother really interesting aspect of this study is the use of dried blood spot (DBS) kits, also known as finger prick tests,‚Äù explains Dr. Hankins.

I stand by my original point.  Catastrophes and disasters often have indirect downstream effects. Some of those are deadly, and some might actually save lives (for example, fewer people got seasonal flu last year.)

If you look at death rate for a county like the US, and subtract COVID attributed deaths, it looks like the deadly downstream effects outnumbered the positive ones.

&gt; The study, published in¬†eLife and led by Dr. Rodrigo Young (UCL Institute of Ophthalmology), analyzed swabs from smartphone screens rather than directly from people, and found that people who tested positive by the regular nasal swabbing PCRs were also positive when samples were taken from phone screens.

&gt; The new method ‚Äî known as Phone Screen Testing (PoST) ‚Äî detected the COVID-19 virus on the phones of 81 to 100% of contagious people with a high viral load suggesting it is as accurate as antigen lateral flow tests.

&gt; Globally active screening for COVID-19 is still a priority as new variants keep emerging and the vaccination rollout is not guaranteed in many countries. However, testing is expensive and can be physically unpleasant, both of which are significant hurdles on the road to an effective test and trace system.

&gt; **As PoST is an environmental test, rather than a clinical test, it is both non-invasive and less expensive [about 5-10x less] that a traditional nasal swabbing PCR. This means not only is it suitable for rollout in lower-income countries, but it also removes the discomfort of current COVID-19 testing options, potentially increasing take-up of regular testing among the general population**. In addition, PoST sampling takes less than a minute and does not require medical personnel, which eases mass adoption in big facilities and large-scale applications.",,,1625618520,{},h4autkh,True,t3_of7zri,False,True,t3_of7zri,/r/Coronavirus/comments/of7zri/move_over_uncomfortable_nasal_swabs_phone_swabs/h4autkh/,1625824442,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Breakthrough infections are still rare enough that I think any data wouldn't be strong enough to draw definitive conclusions just yet, but because vaccination isn't 100% eventually I think we'll be able to say that vaccines reduce risk of long term symptoms by x%.  Of course, with the variants I'm sure long covid %s will still be a moving target in unvaccinated individuals for a while, so we'll have to take that into account as well.   
One of the theories of the cause of long covid is autoantibodies  possibly caused by the immune disregulation aspect of the virus.  Hypothetically you would see this a lot less in vaccinated individuals because of the quicker immune response and not relying on waiting for the innate immune system to start recognizing the virus, so you shouldn't be seeing it get into all the nooks and crannies like the lymphatic, cardiovascular, and central nervous systems.   


All this is to say that I completely understand the logic of the argument that  ""since long covid isn't exclusively tied to severity and chances of getting mild / asymptomatic infection are still somewhat significant with vaccination, are the odds of getting long covid somewhat significant as well?""

Wow, I didn't know the USD lost that much in value :-)

Anyway, I don't think ""vaccine fatigue"" actually exists. Maybe we do have some sort of ""trying to get an appointment"" fatigue because the solution to that issue of finding an appointment in Germany was absolutely ridiculous. Calling every doctor's office in your city just to hear ""uh no"" over and over again, and not having any luck at the mass vacination sites because politicians decided that we should send most doses to doctor's offices, that's very frustrating and could certainly lead to fatigue.

The high rate of cancellations might simply be because people find better appointments at other vaccination sites, not because they have suddenly turned into anti-vaxxers or believe they don't need the second dose for some reason.

There is an issue with anti-vaxx sentiment in Germany, but that's nothing new and it is certainly not ""fatigue"", it's just ""being dumb"".",,,1625653649,{},h4c8cbz,False,t3_offu3y,False,False,t3_offu3y,/r/Coronavirus/comments/offu3y/germanys_fight_against_vaccine_fatigue/h4c8cbz/,1625852939,36,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

It's really bad, specially in Menorca. Since this is being fueled by beach parties, boat parties and such, I don't see this subsiding soon.

I have checked the local news and no mention of closing up, but if things escalate, then I wouldn't be surprised if it happens. I really would advise you against even being near other people, since Delta is incredibly contagious and I wouldn't be surprised if it is on open air if people are close for a long time, even with ventilation.

Due to this sudden increase of cases that originated in Mallorca that has expanded to the rest of Spain (literally thousands of cases) I'm considering myself not to fly to a different part of Spain as the incidence got really high and I'm not sure my residence country will not declare it a risk area and mandate again forced quarantine on return (despite being vaccinated).

- Those in a highly vaccinated area, where cases are incredibly low, people aren't getting sick in significant numbers, and restrictions have all been lifted, feel like it's over because as a matter of localized reality, it really is. I live in MA and besides having to wear a mask on the train (a national CDC policy), there really aren't any signs of the pandemic. We've vaccinated our way back to normal, and barring a true escape variant that sends people back to the hospital, that's not going to change. 

- However, those in an area with minimal vaccine penetration, with people who don't believe in vaccines or that COVID was really a threat, feel like it's over because they never actually believed in it in the first place. Unfortunately these people are going to bear the brunt of the next wave, and it's entirely preventable. 

I don't feel bad for the people in the latter group, they made their own decisions, even if they were led astray by their leadership. It doesn't necessarily change anything for my situation though.

And *even if* we assume that studies will be on par with those preliminary findings (they probably won't, as studies on Delta from multiple other countries show much higher effectiveness), the chances of catching covid while fully vaccinated with an MRNA vaccine are still a tiny fraction of what you suggested above (the odds you suggested are actually worse than the odds of catching covid while completely unvaccinated). 

A drop from 91% to 64% sounds scary, but in reality that could be a difference of one or two people testing positive in these studies.

We‚Äôre reaching a point in the U.K. where I think learning to live with it is the right course of action. Is it too early to drop all legal mandates? Yeah, I think so personally. I think we should be waiting until the start of August so we get another month of vaccinations under our belt. But there we are. 

I do think it‚Äôs right to transition into a new phase of everyone taking responsibility for themselves now. The legal mandates are going‚Ä¶ but you can still do what works for you to keep you and your loved ones safe. I‚Äôm under 30 and double vaxxed. So are my parents, my grandparents, almost all my extended family members, some of my friends and my work colleagues. Everyone else I personally know and care about are single dosed and expecting their second in the next month or so. They‚Äôre also all smart, and decent people, and won‚Äôt knowingly put people at risk, so will still follow self-imposed mask wearing and other restrictions. I‚Äôve had these discussions, and I trust them.

What else can we do? NEVER try get back to normal because COVID isn‚Äôt going to go away, people won‚Äôt or can‚Äôt get vaccinated and we need to constantly live in fear? Vaccines have shown a clear weakening of hospitalisation and deaths with the current strains in circulation. That‚Äôs the point of them; not to eradicate it, or save everyone. And of course that might change with a new strain and I wholeheartedly agree to go back into legal mandates if a killer strain negates our vaccines.

And to the point around flu, whilst I feel like the ramifications of COVID are greater than flu for human beings, I understand the point. Flu circulates every year and it does just kill people. New strains develop, new vaccines are brought out, and people still die. Vaccinated or not, there‚Äôs death. I get the flu vaccine every year not for me (although flu is fucking awful!), but to protect my parents and grandparents, and others, as I don‚Äôt want to spread it. If we get the population into a good state where we can ‚Äòhandle‚Äô COVID as there‚Äôs some immunity in enough people, boosters will be enough for those that need it, to keep hospitalisations and deaths down. But people will still die. That‚Äôs awful, but it‚Äôs life, right? 

If it‚Äôs a few thousand, or doesn‚Äôt stray too far from typical flu deaths over winter, is that really something we need to continually shut our lives down for? Maybe it does just become the norm that we see x% more deaths every winter from now on because of flu+COVID complications?

Anyway, you and your loved ones keep safe, and you keep doing what is right for you.

People with underlying medical conditions actually need them more than anyone else and there is no reason they should not be getting them. 

The main group of people that I am most concerned about are those that got the first mRNA vaccine but were allergic to it or had severe reactions and couldn't get the second. There is no protocol in place for them at this point to get a different vaccine.

There are also many people that get the shot(s) but for whom they are not effective or less effective, including immunocompromised people, those on immunosuppressants, with weak immune systems.

But the thing is that this is exactly why everyone ELSE needs to get the shot. These are the reasons why when people say getting a vaccine is a personal choice its really not a personal choice.

But out of all of the people that are hospitalized and/or dying from covid, the vast vast vast majority are those that chose not to get vaccinated. There will always be a very small percentage of people that got the vaccine but for whom it was ineffective.

We couldn't say that covid causes insomnia in 12% of people, because 10% would have it regardless of infection. In reality, based on those numbers, covid causes insomnia in about 2% of people.

It also threw off your heart rhythm and you'll be in cardiac arrest shortly if nothing is done about it. Also, you're choking on the hotdog. 

So in this awfully unlucky scenario, which issue is going to kill you first. The answer is hotdog.

The cardiac issue, that's much more pressing, but it's monitored, and for right now, you're alive. But if I don't do anything about that hotdog, you'll be dead in the next 2 minutes.

Also younger people without any risk factors could get vaccinated earlier if they decided to get AstraZeneca despite no official recommendation for that age group in Germany.

For a while AstraZeneca was especially pushed on the 60-70 years old. But it didn't have the best reputation in Germany. So it wouldn't surprise me if some of those 60-70 years old rather decided to wait longer until they could get Biontech or Moderna.

As long as people remain unvaccinated, in the US more than half have yet to be double jabbed, it poses a massive risk to you that's half the population who you depend on for everything from stocking shelves to policing to making sure water and electricity flows. The covid case that occupies the doctor, nurse, emt or hospital bed might be needed for someone you love for something completely unrelated to covid. 

&gt; The people with vaccinations are not spreading the disease,

They are far far less likely to spread it but they still can.

&gt; The people with vaccinations are not typically succumbing to the disease

Yet they still can odds are against it but if underlying conditions exist it's a possibility.

&gt; meeting up with other vaccinated people has no significant chance of impacting anyone in a negative way.

Absolutely just try to do it in the safest possible manner during the summer outdoors etc. I'm incredibly frightened of newer variants appearing that may be more robust against the vaccines and at the moment most of the world is still in the middle of this. I like to look at it like our neighborhood is on fire some houses have been devastated but have managed to save most of their belongings, some houses the fires still rage and other houses have managed to keep fire at bay but have to worry about embers floating through the air risking their house. 
 
The vaccines have give us all a way out but it won't work until we all have it.

I know I sound preachy and I didn't mean to come across that way. I wish it was all back to normal my nephews live on the other side of the world and until everyone from here to there is vaccinated I can't see them so there is a part of me doing this out of selfish reasons.

Your statements are... Irrelevant at best.

Most of your symptoms during infection are your own immune system response. If you catch this thing, you might find yourself on steroids to suppress your immune system.

Guess what vaccine side effects are? Your immune system. Immunosuppressants, like ibuprofen, are really good at managing side effects.

It stands to reason that the tiny number of people that get tough vaccine side effects would likely have fared much worse with an actual virus.

On one hand you have a bit of protein that starts degrading rapidly above -40 degrees, can't replicate, and is cleared from your body in a couple days.

On the other you have a self replicating, mutating monster of natural selection that's been discovered replicating in penis, heart, and lung tissue to name a few, for up to a year in some people.

This is why when you say ""natural immune response does not require a vaccine,"" you're spreading harmful half-truth. It's not the same. The vaccine is far better and safer, for yourself and for your fellow humans.

I hate the misinformation about UK. For starts vaccines are amazing and no this post isn't supposed to or intended to be fear mongering but people suck with numbers.

I am not claiming you are, but for example you said:

&gt;Cases wise the last time we were in a similar place (case numbers and trajectory) was mid December and we were admitting &gt;2000 people into hospital a day.

That isn't true. The only real data would be if you had a lull or move back to effectively zero spread for a few months, then a new wave begins.

That wasn't December, that was Early September &gt; Late October.

There was a small reduction, then the wave got worse in December. Moreover the more cases and higher positivity, the more cases missed.

Anyway it wasn't until October - end of October when deaths spiked. Nearly 2 months after the beginning of the surge. Before then it was 20-50 people daily, then around October 20th it jumped to 70, then following week hundreds.

Will that happen with this wave in the UK? Well no, like I said it's not meant to be fear mongering. But I keep seeing ""30k cases but only 9 deaths, back in December it was 1700 deaths"" but if you look at the actual data, and compare it to when the last wave actually started... (End of august/beginning of September) it had a lag of roughly 1- 1.5 months before deaths started to skyrocket.

Deaths also increase with hospitalization, because hospitalized are overburdened. People who would otherwise live, will die in a crowded hospital. 

The wave in the UK started End of May/Beginning of June.

Like I said this is not meant to be fear mongering, but we are starting to see an uptick in deaths. While the most vulnerable are safer due to vaccines, and we won't see waves of 2k dead daily, it does not mean the upcoming wave is going to be tiny. We haven't even seen the deaths from it yet.

I hope to be wrong, but people pointing at UK right now really have to wait until at least July is over and August is half way through. I would love to be wrong, and like I said it won't be as bad as previously but people forget the more cases the more missed cases(if you get 10k positives, likely 12-15k were actually infected, in the UK if you are getting 70k cases, likely 300k were actually infected, and if COVID death rate is 0.6%... Well 1700 deaths * 166 = 282,000 cases).

Also in October 2020 they were admitting about 300-600 people to the hospital daily. 

Kinda like the 3-4 hundred now! Won't be the same as previous waves, but can we all cool it on UK numbers for like 2 more months before using it as some example it hasn't proven itself to be yet?",,,1625611435,{},h4ahaxo,False,t3_oeyim0,False,False,t1_h4993x3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/oeyim0/uk_reports_highest_number_of_new_covid_cases/h4ahaxo/,1625817426,13,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

That having been established, we don't know the risk yet for long covid in breakthrough cases. Most people haven't been vaccinated very long and breakthrough cases are pretty rare, considering it can take months before Long Covid symptoms even surface, we simply haven't had the time to analyze risk levels yet. So we can't just dismiss it and assume there's no risk yet.

You've been making statements that claim a lack of risk to things we simply do not, and can not know about.

For you, people that keep seeing ""world is ending"" type of headlines and articles eventually become immune to them. We keep seeing news about different variants and new breakthrough cases. But from what I've seen, those cases aren't resulting in death or hospitalizations. 

To the person you're replying to, we should still follow science and if there is a variant that crops up, or we discover vaccines only last for a certain amount of time, we need to be ready to adjust our behavior.

(First shot) üíâüí™ü©π,dark,text,t2_meeqp,False,False,[],"It is kind of a stretch to call 55-65% of total population fully vaccinated as herd immunity. Most of the very highly vaccinated states are around this number. Only Vermont is at 66% I think. By the way, if you want to be correct, you'd need the figure from 2 weeks ago, because it takes 2 weeks to get full protection.

On top of that, variants also plays a factor. Whereas the Pfizer vaccine (the most effective vaccine) showed that it could prevent 94% of infections (asymptomatic + symptomatic) previously according to Israeli data. However, delta changed this to 64%. So what probably previously was enough to prevent cases, is not enough anymore. On top of that, the virus has become much more contagious with each variant. The new delta variant is almost 2 times as contagious as the original variant. So the original 70% herd immunity threshold is not even enough anymore. Herd immunity is just not going to happen anywhere with the current vaccination levels, efficacy and contagiousness of the virus.

The only thing is to keep spread lower than before and make sure the vulnerable are protected. As the vaccines still work near perfect against severe disease, hospitalisation and death. And that goes both for vaccines like Pfizer and AstraZeneca. So to keep deaths and hospitalisations low, you need extremely high vaccination levels in the vulnerable population. And with this most Euro countries including the UK are doing as well or better than the highly vaccinated regions of the US. Just look at the hospitalisations and deaths in come of these countries. NL: 1.9 death per day on average and 109 currently hospitalised on a population of 17.5 million and the UK: 20 deaths per day on average and 1,905 currently hospitalised on a population of 69 million. The US fares worse overall. But looking at the highly vaccinated states, like Massachusetts, it looks similar. MA has around 1.5 deaths per day on average and 81 currently hospitalised on a population of 7 million.

In addition, Merck, the original patent holder of ivermectin, has released the [following statement](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/):

&gt; Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today affirmed its position regarding use of ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

&gt; * No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

&gt; * No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;

&gt; * A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.

&gt; We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.

&gt;On page 12 of the briefing, it shows that 26 people have died since February 1 after testing positive for the Delta variant of the virus, having also been fully vaccinated for more than two weeks. In total, 4,087 tested positive more than two weeks after their second dose. Meanwhile, 35,521 people who were unvaccinated tested positive for the Delta variant and 34 people died.

So it's not most people and it's not statistically likely that out of  a state with 30% vaccination that they should completely relax all safety measures because70% of the populations fears vaccinations and refuses to get one right now .  


and for some reason the idea that this strain is MORE infecitous than the last one we DID lock down for is going over peoples heads  


Think about how bad covid was before with lockdowns now we have fewer restrictions , fewer safety protocols, it's summer so more people roaming  and visiting each other  AND a new dominant  strain  spreading like wildfire .   


I wish people would stop making the rest of us out to be crazy  for masking and generally being concerned . Just because I'm bored of quarantine doesn't mean I'm willing to risk my life to pretend I'm safe form COVID which is also killing some vaccinated  I am still gonna play it safe because i value my and others lives .

For example, if VE = 0.8 (expressed differently as 8/10)

- RU-RV = 8 

- RU = 10

We can write that as (10-2)/10= 8/10 = .80. 

Further we can split the equation (10/10)-(2/10)= 8/10 =  .80

This gives us RU-RV
1. Risk unvaccinated (RU) is 100% or  10/10 (makes sense no vaccine, 100% risk)

2. Which leaves the other term to reduce the effectiveness measure from a perfect 100%:
Risk vaccinated (RV) is 20% - 2/10

Only UK has an advanced wave with high vaccination levels. What I can see in UK is that average daily deaths have increased from 6 to 20. In previous waves, deaths lagged cases by 3 weeks, and in the last 3 weeks, cases have increased 3.5x, so we could expect 70 daily deaths in 3 weeks from now. Cases are still 40% of what they were in the peak of the January wave, so if cases were to go as high again, it would mean about 170 daily deaths. However in the January peak there were 1200 daily deaths. So the ratio cases/deaths might have increased 7-fold. I would say that is actually a huge improvement thanks to vaccines, but if UK gets 100+ daily deaths, it's still the equivalent of a bad flu season (and the flu does put (or used to) a lot of strain in health systems every year). Now, that is in UK, where most older people got vaccinated. In The Netherlands vaccine uptake is good but not great, and somewhat lower than in UK. Other countries with current waves like Portugal or Spain have amazing vaccine uptake (+97% in older populations), so I would expect the cases/deaths ratio to be different in each of them.

I do think your numbers paint a much rosier picture than reality would hold. Simply because there‚Äôs so many variables unique to region (vaccination %, mask mandate, masking in general), livelihood (grocery store worker, office worker in complex or large building, doctor, farmer), individual risk mitigation (masking, social distancing, how often they go into public), and primary means of transportation (public, private).

The unvaccinated farmer in the middle of Kansas isn‚Äôt wearing a mask and going about their daily life as if nothing is going on (can confirm), their risk is much different than a vaccinated office worker in LA taking a park and ride to a large building downtown but wearing a mask. Population density and population exposure also should be included. It‚Äôs MIGHT be possible to calculate an aggregate risk percent, but it‚Äôs a massively moving target taking into consideration variants, masking, regional vaccinated %, and the exponentially of transmission. Rolling the numbers up to cover almost 4 million square miles reduces their meaning.

However we do know that vaccines reduce the risk of infection by 80% (or 64% is what Israel is saying). So whatever the baseline risk is, there‚Äôs still a 20-36% relative risk of infection if inoculated.

Your numbers essentially say that the chance of getting Covid (long or short) in aggregate for the US is 14% over six months if vaccinated.

I love that since spring I've been to a wedding, my grandma's bday (she also just beat lung cancer), and a 4th of July gathering at a park knowing we're all vaccinated and outdoors. It's been a hard-earned victory after a year of being responsible and not seeing anyone except the masked grocery store strangers. 

Sure, freedom means being able not to take the vaccine. However, two of Roosevelt's four freedoms are freedom from want and freedom from fear. It's not that anyone should force you, but maybe if you realize the beast you're fighting creates a want of health, you'd be afraid. The best way to counter that fear is to make yourself impervious to this plague. After this hellish time, I no longer fear this virus, not unless another mutation avoids our vaccines.

Horse shit. You don't get to be leader, tell people to jump off a cliff and claim it's their own fault for following your commands. That's the excuse of a conman, not a leader. You only get to pull that card if you admit you're just a conman and was never a leader. People put their faith in you as a leader, especially since you claimed to be looking out for their best interests. You are literally blaming the victims.

&gt;This is why I feel people (in masses) were arrogant and lacked common sense to just stay at home.

Yes. And this is why it's the job of the leader of a nation to stop their people from doing stupid shit. You're a leader because you're supposed to be smarter and could see the bigger picture and have a vision on improving the lives of your people. Why do you think they got elected in the first place? If you can't even do that, then you failed in the job you applied and got appointed for.

Of course it's more complicated than even this. Look at a state like Colorado which has a fairly high case load right now.

For starters, in your insomnia example, you can't just look at a difference of 2% in your test and control groups and declare that the difference between them is all that Covid is responsible. There are always natural variations between test and control groups, so it's a ballpark figure, not an exact one.

Secondly, you seem to be assuming that the medical professionals involved in these studies don't know that symptoms can come from other sources. In the study I linked, everyone involved was classified as a long covid sufferer. While I admit we don't know the details,  I highly doubt that they were designated as Long Covid sufferers at the first step. If, to use the allergy example, some people developed insomnia weeks or months after a covid infection, that the doctors treating them aren't  likely to instantly assume that a runny nose is a result of Long Covid. Chances are very high that some of the common causes of the associated symptoms were ruled out before it was classified as Long Covid.

I will agree with you that more complete data is needed to determine actual levels of risk for Long Covid, as there's too much we still fail to understand about it, but you seem to be taking the approach of assuming that doctors are immediately assigning these symptoms as Long Covid without ruling out other alternatives.

(wrote this above):
  
Delta plus doesn't spread like Delta...it won't be a problem. There was an ""Alpha Plus"" - where'd that go? Yes, it was better at evading vaccines/immunity, but in having certain mutations for evasion, ability transmission was slowed. People got infected by other variants first, developed some immunity, and limited the spread of these more evasive variants.

Beta (S. African) is still the best at lowering neutralization at the moment. That's been stuck in the 2% of overall cases in the US for many months.

The idea that we're going to constantly be seeing worse and worse variants is fearmongering. There are a limited amount of advantageous mutations. Many of these mutations are popping up independently in different areas. It's not like the virus is ""learning"" - they arise by chance. Speed seems to be the biggest danger.

This thread is so interesting, I had no idea vaccination systems were so different.

I am in Portugal, we got a very no frills system. Vaccination centers, two ways of setting up an appointment (health centre calls people and this was done mostly for the elderly or vulnerable) or a site which opens up according to age group. 

You pick the date and centre, they send you a sms with the hour, and you get what you get, no picking what vaccine you get. The second date is fixed, it will be 4 weeks after the first dose for mrna, or 8 weeks now for AZ. No payment ever, for nothing.

I would argue that even if it is a small benefit it is such low effort it shouldn't even be a question until we hit those tipping points of vaccination rates.That minority of unvaccinated people still have an expanded range of influence with their infection if vaccinated people can still spread it and refuse to wear masks. 

I'm sorry if you feel called out by this but you are literally skipping out of helping because of a minor inconvenience. We all have to do our parts even if they are small parts.

How these studies work is a single population (Israeli citizens) is broken out into cohorts (vaccinated/not vaccinated) which are then [if it's a good study] controlled for demographics (age/employment/health/etc). Then they look at how many in each group: 1) tested positive for COVID; 2) had COVID symptoms; 3) were hospitalized with COVID (aka severe COVID); 4) died from COVID.

So when we measure efficacy and see a number like 95% efficacy, that means they observed 20 times more cases (controlled for size) in the unvaccinated group. Most people understand this pretty easily, but when we look at severe COVID people get a bit mixed up.

If they hear the same vaccine is 95% effective at preventing hospitalization/death, they might think that's **on top** of the protection from symptomatic COVID. It's not, that's a similar comparison at how many deaths/hospitalizations were there in the unvaccinated control compared to the vaccine cohort. 

So what happens if you get COVID while vaccinated with a vaccine that's rated as 95% effective (generally) and 95% effective at preventing severe COVID? You'd expect your symptoms to be just as bad and likely to hospitalize you as those who are unvaccinated, your protection against severe COVID would be solely coming from the reduced chance at getting any form of COVID.",,,1625681617,{},h4dpq1l,False,t3_ofdpk5,False,True,t1_h4dkkvw,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ofdpk5/full_covid19_vaccination_provides_69_protection/h4dpq1l/,1625882466,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

TOPOL: Not at all. No, this was silent. They had no idea. So when they got the results of their CAT scan of their lungs, they were so surprised because they felt perfectly well. And the same thing for the people who had heart inflammation - they had no idea.

If delta is more transmissible and takes only minutes (or even seconds as some of the Australia reports indicate) to transmit, then I think it stands to reason that more viral particles circulating around and that can transmit easier through the air might end up in more people‚Äôs bodies and therefore lead to more positive tests, but not really be a ‚Äútrue‚Äù infection. And even if so, probably keep the viral load way lower and clear the infection faster.

What we should really keep focusing on is symptomatic disease, especially with the mRNA vaccines since that‚Äôs what the trials focused on.

Yeah, it would be nice for them to be 90% against any type of infection, but 64-79% is still quite good and may even be what the number really was all along and the 90%+ against any type of infection that the cdc study found may have been more a function of relatively lower transmission rates and viral prevalence.",,,1625674356,{},h4d957o,False,t3_ofel5c,False,True,t3_ofel5c,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ofel5c/now_for_the_big_covid19_test_how_well_do_vaccines/h4d957o/,1625873687,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I get what you are saying, but your point of contention has an interesting twist in how you describe it.

""...my personal risk depends on the behavior of others"" vs  ""...my personal risk is very low regardless of others.."" is proof in itself that this is personal.  The fact that you can nearly eliminate the chances of death by choosing to get vaccinated is a very powerful choice that you have taken.  It could be argued that others who choose to not get vaccinated don't care about their own health.  So, if they don't care about their own health, why should you... especially since you are still protected?  


Granted, this does assume that you are in the US and everyone has access, which I believe to be the case.  If not, please do correct me.

Here's some light reading about the effects of asymptomatic and mild/moderate cases. It seems that there's a lot we're still discovering about the effects of Covid-19 and their duration. Asymptomatic doesn't equal an absence of ill effects.

‚ÄúThe researchers found elevations of C5b9 in patients with severe COVID-19 and MIS-C, but to their surprise, they also found that C5b9 was elevated in patients with minimal or asymptomatic disease. Of the 22 patients for whom complete data were available, 19 (86%) met the criteria for TMA [thrombotic microangiopathy]. Additionally, sC5b9 levels were elevated both in patients who did and did not meet criteria for TMA. Although most children with COVID-19 do not have severe disease, our study shows that there may be other effects of SARS-CoV-2 that are worthy of investigation.‚Äù

‚ÄúMethods: We retrospectively investigated patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 but who did not show any symptoms. Among the 139 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized in Yeungnam University Hopistal in Daegu, South Korea, 10 (7.2%) were asymptomatic. Their chest CT and radiographic findings were analyzed. Results: In the results, all patients (100%) had ground-glass opacity (GGO) on chest CT. Further, the GGO lesions were predominantly distributed peripherally and posteriorly in all patients. In 9 (90%) patients, the GGO lesions were combined with reticular opacity.‚Äù

Really?  Isnt the risk for under 12 in the same ballpark as flu?  Not zero, but back of the envelope you might be at more risk driving them to/from the airport than from covid.

Looks like 82 deaths from 0-10 in 2020.
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7003e1.htm#T1_down

So lets say 35M kids, and 82 deaths.  Thats a 1:427K  chance, in basically  year, with MUCH higher covid rates than wed expect the next year.  

https://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/101-child-population-by-age-group#detailed/1/any/false/1729,37,871,870,573,869,36,868,867,133/62,63,64,6,4693/419,420

Now the morality rate for driving is roughly 2:100M miles.  So if you drive 234 miles to get your kid vaccinated (plausible to and from airport on both ends), your kid would be more at risk from the drive.

That's not quite accurate. For a doubling exponential rate, you would jump from 33% to 66%. It follows the same growth as your initial drops: 1, add 2 = 3, add 4 = 7, add 8 = 15, add 16 = 31 (close to your 33%), add 32 = 63. Each increment is basically the running total to that point + 1 of whatever your starting unit was. So from 33%, the next increment would be 33% + 1 drop, giving you 66% + 1 drop.

If you were at 50%, then it would jump to 100% (+ 1 drop).

Perhaps, and I get my kids flu shots too.

&gt; Looks like 82 deaths from 0-10 in 2020.

Deaths from COVID are fairly rare in general.  What's much more common is long-lasting or perhaps permanent problems due to long COVID.  Here's [one fairly known paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7927578/) that states:

&gt; Evidence from the first study of long covid in children suggests that more than half of children aged between 6 and 16 years old who contract the virus have at least one symptom lasting more than 120 days, with 42.6 per cent impaired by these symptoms during daily activities.

In general though, there isn't enough research to know exactly what symptoms and what likelihood there is for kids to face in terms of long covid.  On a personal level, I know a kid that was an athlete in high school, got COVID early this year, and he still has breathing problems.  I know adults that got it last year and still have things like near constant headaches, breathing problems, etc.

So for me, just like with anything else there are vaccines for, it seems like the best course of action is to get children vaccinated as soon as it's possible.

1.  You are right about your article and the symptoms. The non-PDF version of the 'full text' omits all the tables, but once I looked at the PDF version I found them. 

2. There's still a critical distinction between the two studies. The one I linked did take steps to screen out as much as they could of non-covid symptoms. To that end, they required the symptoms to persist for 50 days or more, and:  ""...symptoms that were reported within the year prior to testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 were excluded from the analysis,"".  This study used existing medical records, yours was purely self reported. This is an important distinction.

3. Your point that there could be confusion or contamination from Non-Covid sources is valid. The claim that the two articles rely on the same methods for information gathering is not. There are some important distinctions, but I will admit that the 32% number isn't one I'd consider to be unquestioningly accurate.

4.

But a new study of what happened after people‚Äôs birthdays suggests that people we trust were also a common source of viral spread.

Private gatherings have been harder for researchers to measure than big public events ‚Äî they‚Äôre private, after all. And there has been¬†[a fierce debate](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/23/health/coronavirus-holiday-gatherings.html)¬†for months among epidemiologists about just how big a factor they have been in how coronavirus moved from person to person.

But researchers from Harvard, the RAND Corporation and Castlight Health used a creative method for finding them: Using health insurance claims data, they looked at the Covid rates of families in the two weeks after one of them had a birthday. Overall, their¬†[paper](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2781306), published in Jama Internal Medicine, found that a recent family birthday increased Covid risk by nearly a third in counties where the virus was widespread.

Their theory is that the increased risk is almost certainly explained by birthday parties. Though the insurance claims don‚Äôt show whether any individual Covid patient had actually held a birthday party, several aspects of the data strongly suggest a connection.

For one, when researchers looked at other days of the year by randomly assigning birthdays instead of using actual birthdays, or examined diagnoses in weeks before birthdays, they found no such pattern. But, perhaps more significantly, they found the biggest infection risk in the weeks after the birthday of a child.


‚ÄúMy wife and I, we certainly didn‚Äôt see the need to gather indoors for our birthdays,‚Äù said Anupam Jena, a professor of health policy at Harvard Medical School and one of the paper‚Äôs authors, who said the study was inspired by his own daughter‚Äôs birthday. ‚ÄúOur kids might be more disappointed.‚Äù

Birthday parties, of course, often involve groups huddling in close quarters, perhaps to watch a child blow out candles on a cake.


July 5, 2021

The study considered data from last year, when Covid was much more common and fewer Americans were vaccinated. But its conclusions are still relevant for Americans who are unvaccinated today ‚Äî a group that includes all children under 12. That may be especially true as the new, more contagious Delta variant begins to circulate in more states.

Many political debates about managing the pandemic have centered on what to do about public spaces ‚Äî like whether restaurants should be allowed to open, or whether masks should be required. Public officials have had a harder time policing people‚Äôs behavior at home. They‚Äôve also struggled to measure its effects.

K.J. Seung, the chief of strategy and policy for Partners in Health‚Äôs Massachusetts Covid response, who helped set up the contact tracing system, said it has been hard for contact tracers to clearly demonstrate that people were contracting the virus in small private gatherings.

Public exposures, like at a factory or a wedding, were easier for them to track. Individuals often didn‚Äôt share the nights they had a cousin over for dinner or drove a friend home from work, whether out of shame or forgetfulness ‚Äî and if they did, they were reluctant to name names.

‚ÄúSmall social gatherings are the most difficult locations to trace,‚Äù he said. Yet ‚Äúwhen we talked to contact tracers around the country, they were like: Yeah, people are getting infected at these small gatherings.‚Äù

So much behavior around the pandemic ‚Äî including¬†[mask use](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/17/upshot/coronavirus-face-mask-map.html)¬†and the¬†[uptake of vaccines](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/04/17/us/vaccine-hesitancy-politics.html)¬†‚Äî appears to differ by people‚Äôs political party. But the study found that birthdays led to increased Covid infections by similar levels in Republican and Democratic areas of the country. This suggests that although Democratic-leaning households may have been more likely to wear a mask while walking the dog, they may have differed less than Republicans in their comfort having a trusted friend over to visit.

‚ÄúThere was definitely this element of your home is a safe place and therefore when you have your friends and family over in your home, it just doesn‚Äôt feel risky,‚Äù said Dr. Ashish Jha, the dean of the School of Public Health at Brown University, who described the paper as ‚Äúcreative‚Äù for finding an unusual way of capturing disease transmission that is otherwise hard to measure.

For many Americans, birthday parties have gotten much safer in recent months. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it‚Äôs safe for fully vaccinated people to gather indoors without wearing face coverings.

But for those who remain unvaccinated, the study is a reminder that even activities that feel the most safe pose a threat of infection. In many parts of the country, unvaccinated people are clustered by region or social group, meaning that birthday parties ‚Äî and other such festive, private occasions ‚Äî can still be risky.",,,1625628587,{},h4bdvbg,False,t3_of8jwm,False,False,t1_h4bbb1n,/r/Coronavirus/comments/of8jwm/birthday_parties_as_virus_vector/h4bdvbg/,1625834942,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

That's not how global pandemics work, American ideology aside.

This sets us up for dealing with the ongoing consequences of the vaccine tearing through the half of the country that's unvaccinated and being ill-equipped to deal with any new developments, domestically or globally.

Nguy·ªÖn Th√†nh Phong, Chairman of HCM City, made the statement during Wednesday's meeting with the National Committee for COVID-19 Prevention and Control, as the outbreak in the southern economic hub is worsening with hundreds of new community infections a day and total caseload topping 8,000 today.  
  
The 13-million-population has stayed under social distancing order in line with Government Directive No.15 ‚Äì including closures of non-essential services and businesses ‚Äì for 38 days (starting on May 31), but the outbreak seems to have not improved, with about 17 per cent of registered cases since late May detected through community screening or when hospitalised.  
  
Directive 16, which was enforced nationwide during the early days of the pandemic last year, prescribes the closure of non-essential services and businesses, people are asked (instead of just advised to under Directive 15) to stay at home and only go outside for essential trips (buying food, medicines, emergency care, going to work at essential businesses and factories), not allowed to gather in more than two people outside of hospitals, schools or workplaces or in public areas, and must maintain a distance of 2m in public. Public transport would be halted and movement between different areas will be limited to a minimum.  
  
The order will take effect the day after the national high school exam concludes (Thursday, July 8).  
  
Phong said the complicated developments of the pandemic, the high population density, the high volume of trade, and especially the presence of the highly transmissible Delta variant of coronavirus, have posed serious challenges for the city.  
  
‚ÄúTo soon contain the outbreak, the city needs to be committed to more resolute and stronger measures and needs to accept the sacrifice of short-term interests to ensure long-term development and people's health and safety,‚Äù the city‚Äôs leader said.  
  
Phong asked the city's residents to trust, support, and cooperate with the leadership during the lockdown. He believed that the outbreaks could be put under control if the measures are strictly implemented.  
  
Phong reassured that the supply chain in the city remains stable ‚Äì despite closures of several markets with clusters of infections ‚Äì in the lockdown period, with goods stocked up to 120,000 tonnes a month and a push for online shopping.  
  
Up to 106 markets, 124 traditional markets, and over 2,000 mini markets and convenience stores across the city will be utilised to ensure sufficient essentials and food for residents.  
  
In addition, the city's transport department has prepared plans for transportation activities on roads and waterways in the city, in which public transport will be halted and a number of vehicles (including a fleet of taxis) will be tasked with carrying people to hospitals and medical centres in case of necessity.  
  
Railway and airway travels will likely also be halted.  
  
Ride hailing services using motorcycles and traditional xe √¥m will be suspended, but shipping services will continue to be operational.  
  
Deputy transport L√™ Anh Tu·∫•n asked HCM City and neighbouring localities to coordinate to ensure uninterrupted flow of goods and facilitate COVID-19 testing for the drivers operating the vehicles transporting goods between localities.  
  
The city assigned the health department to prepare a plan to control the pandemic at a higher level with the support of the Ministry of Health in terms of human resources (10,000 medical staff and doctors) and equipment, establish contact tracing teams and strengthen efforts to suppress local outbreaks.  
  
The city is also told to prepare for up 20,000 treatment beds and quarantine space for 30,000 direct contacts of infected patients (F1 cases), ramp up testing to collect 1.3 million samples a day and process 400,000 samples.  
  
The focus remains on increasing testing capacity in high-risk areas to make sure that results are returned to people within 12 hours.  
  
The city‚Äôs leader said that currently the group testing method will continue to test mixing of 10-15 samples, and ruled out larger sample mixture.  
  
The city has completed the appraisal and arrangements for 43 enterprises in export processing zones, industrial parks and high-tech zones with 56,000 employees to be ready to implement on-site isolation while continuing to carry out production at factories in line with the guidance of the health ministry.  
  
Deputy health minister ƒê·ªó Xu√¢n Tuy√™n asked HCM City to strictly enforce social distancing measures from household to household, neighbourhood to neighbourhood, residential area to residential area.  
  
Deputy Prime Minister V≈© ƒê·ª©c ƒêam, Chair of the National Steering for COVID-19 Prevention and Control, said the Government has agreed with HCM City‚Äôs proposal on the implementation of the Directive 16, and be ready to even go further with stronger measures to stamp out the outbreaks as quickly as possible.  
  
ƒêam urged the city to fully use the lockdown days to quell COVID-19 outbreaks.  
  
‚ÄúHCM City‚Äôs anti-COVID-19 units possess high level of expertise compared to the general level, so it is necessary to promote the city‚Äôs creativity in preventing and controlling the outbreaks. The ground situation could certainly be different from the hard regulations or guidelines, the city should feel emboldened to pilot and implement \[creative measures\] in the spirit of prioritising effectiveness,‚Äù Deputy PM ƒêam said. ‚Äî VNS",,,1625668648,{},h4cwcy5,True,t3_ofk5ng,False,False,t3_ofk5ng,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ofk5ng/vietnam_hcm_city_to_enforce_lockdown_measures/h4cwcy5/,1625866592,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

H√Ä N·ªòI ‚Äî The Ministry of Health announced 1,007 new infections, ten imported and 997 locally transmitted on Wednesday.  


Of the new locally transmitted cases on Wednesday, HCM City, the country‚Äôs current largest COVID-19 hotspot, recorded 766 cases followed by B√¨nh D∆∞∆°ng (60), Kh√°nh Ho√† (41), Vƒ©nh Long (24), Long An (19), Ti·ªÅn Giang (18), Ph√∫ Y√™n (14), Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i (13), B·∫Øc Ninh (6), and B·∫Øc Giang, Vƒ©nh Ph√∫c, H∆∞ng Y√™n and ƒê·ªìng Th√°p with five each, Tr√† Vinh and H√† N·ªôi with three each, ƒê·ªìng Nai, B√† R·ªãa-V≈©ng T√†u and Ngh·ªá An with two each, and H√† Tƒ©nh, C√† Mau, ƒê·∫Øk L·∫Øk and Thanh Ho√° with one each.  
  
Of the total, 968 cases were discovered in quarantine and sealed-off areas.  
  
The new infections brought the country‚Äôs total domestic cases to 21,180.  
  
Twelve localities recorded no new community cases for the last 14 days including YeÃÇn BaÃÅi, QuaÃâng TriÃ£, TuyeÃÇn Quang, SoÃõn La, Ninh BiÃÄnh, ThaÃÅi NguyeÃÇn, ƒêieÃ£ÃÇn BieÃÇn, HaÃâi DuÃõoÃõng, PhuÃÅ ThoÃ£, Nam ƒêiÃ£nh, QuaÃâng Nam and KieÃÇn Giang.

Social distancing in Long An Province  
  
The southern province of Long An will impose social distancing from midnight on July 7 to control the spread of the virus.  
  
Accordingly, T√¢n An City and districts of ƒê·ª©c Ho√†, B·∫øn L·ª©c, C·∫ßn ƒê∆∞·ªõc and C·∫ßn Giu·ªôc will be under the Prime Minister's Directive 16, while Ki·∫øn T∆∞·ªùng Township and the remaining districts will follow the less restrictive Directive 15.  
  
Under directive 15, non-essential services will be shut down, and so will entertainment, cultural and sports activities in public. Gatherings of more than 10 people in public will be banned and events and meetings with more than 20 people in one room will not be permitted. People must keep a two-metre distance from others in public, and transportation from COVID-19 hit areas must be limited.  
  
Directive 16 also requires people to keep a distance of at least two metres from others. Gatherings of more than two people in public are banned. Factories must ensure a safe distance between workers and disinfect their working space. Workers must wear masks.  
  
Also, from midnight on July 7, those who do not have permanent and temporary residential permits in the province will not be able to enter the province if they do not have certificates proving they are negative for COVID-19 (PCR or rapid test) issued by a competent authority within five days from the time of entering Long An.  
  
Experts, managers and labourers working outside the province are required to stay at home from July 8 and notify the COVID-19 community teams and local health authorities to take samples for testing, except for cases who have negative test results via PCR or rapid tests granted by the competent authority within 5 days.  
  
The social distancing measures will be imposed until further notice. ‚Äî VNS",,,1625668560,{},h4cw699,True,t3_ofk4ky,False,False,t3_ofk4ky,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ofk4ky/vietnam_total_of_997_community_cases_reported_on/h4cw699/,1625866496,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Flipping restrictions on and off like a light switch at every minor increase in mild cases just will not fly with the American public. Even if it has the result of stopping asymptomatic spread, it would ALSO have a much more intense effect on suppressing vaccine uptake by the hesitant. As soon as we start proclaiming that vaccinated people need to take additional precautions, the chance of getting these people on board goes out the window. 

From a risk/reward perspective it isn't worth the effort to stop what is effectively a non-issue or mild cold for a vaccinated person in nearly all circumstances. 

As for Australia and New Zealand, they're in for a rough year. Unless they can get their vaccination rate up, their constant lockdowns are going to wear real thin (they already are).

""It is already known that Sars-CoV-2 can continue to spread among partially-vaccinated individuals ‚Äì although the risk is much lower than in unvaccinated people ‚Äì but in recent weeks, new information has appeared which suggests that Delta is still capable of being transmitted by those who have had both doses. Doctors at Clalit Health Services, Israel‚Äôs largest health care organization, found that around half of adults infected in a new outbreak of Delta had been fully inoculated with the Pfizer vaccine. This news has prompted Israel to re-impose an indoor mask requirement and reassess its Covid-19 regulations.  
At the same time, a study released by a team of infectious diseases specialists at the University of Cambridge has found antibodies in blood samples taken from individuals who have received two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine were much less responsive to the Delta variant than the original strain of Sars-Cov-2. This is thought to explain how the virus has continued to spread among healthcare workers in hospitals across India, even though they have been fully vaccinated with the AstraZeneca jab. One report in the eastern state of Odisha, reported 274 cases in fully-vaccinated healthcare workers between March 1 and June 10.""",,,1625689733,{},h4e893s,False,t3_ofifyt,False,False,t3_ofifyt,/r/Coronavirus/comments/ofifyt/covid_infections_imperil_indonesias_vaccinated/h4e893s/,1625892164,5,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

[],,NetLibrarian,,,[],,,,text,t2_34wn6,False,False,[],"&gt; The point I'm making about the 0-10 days is that that isn't exactly a long time period. I think you're conflating the analysis that they do for the 60+ days with the statistic from 0-10.

I'm not certain what point you're trying to make. They HAVE to look at the 0-10 time period after the initial test results, because that's the time in which the person is going to continue to have the active infection. Day 0 is the day of the test. If someone goes through the 10 days following a test without showing symptoms, it means they are an asymptomatic case.  After 10 days the individual is almost certainly in recovery from the disease, and it's in the weeks or months that follow that ""Long Covid"" symptoms show up, which is why they check again at 61 days. One set of symptoms from the active infection, another set from after the virus has run its course. Where's the confusion here, what's the issue you have with this?

&gt;You drew the conclusion that the paper you linked meant that a significant portion of asymptomatic cases result in long covid.

Once again, you have that backwards. The study I linked exclusively looked at Long Covid sufferers and found that 32% of them had no symptoms during the period of initial infection.  I made no claims about the percentage of asymptomatic cases that then turn into Long Covid except to say that it was greater than zero.

 &gt;Antigenic escape (alternatively called immune escape, immune evasion or escape mutation) occurs when the immune system of a host, especially of a human being, is unable to respond to an infectious agent, or, in other words, the host's immune system is no longer able to recognize and eliminate a pathogen such as a virus. This process can occur in a number of different ways of both a genetic and an environmental nature. Such mechanisms include homologous recombination, and manipulation and resistance of the host's immune responses. Different antigens are able to escape through a variety of mechanisms.

Someone not having symptoms DURING their primary infection period is what DEFINES asymptomatic cases, so **of course** I understand the statistic.  Why are you even bringing this up?

&gt; I don't see how medical records of self-reported symptoms is any different from self-reported symptoms - can you clarify? 

It's the fact that they've gone back over a prior year's medical history, found the people who had matching symptoms that existed pre-covid, and removed them from the pool being analyzed.  So that way, the lifetime allergy sufferer isn't getting counted as having long covid.

As far as we can tell, the study you're relying on did not do that. So for it, the lifetime allergy sufferer is being counted amongst the number reporting symptoms without ever having had covid. Accepting people who match that profile is going to skew the data in a way that's going to make the 'symptomatic but never infected' pool be larger than it needs to be.

I'm not saying that your insistence on a control group is a bad thing, you're right to want one. I'm just saying the study you picked has significant *other issues* that make me question if the methodology used got the most accurate result. The fact is, both studies have flaws.

1) Even with the long COVID health issues of my BIL and his diagnosis of an ""upper respiratory infection"" that week from his doctor, they participated (without masks) in a large indoor event before getting tested/having their results -- even though it was live streamed for people with health concerns. I know because I was watching the live stream.

2) They caught it at church, where multiple people are out with COVID currently and no one wears a mask. Most attendees are of the same mind that it's just a flu.

3) They only got 2/3 tested this time (although all three had active symptoms) because they didn't want to interrupt my nephew's activities. When the test came back positive, they were only going to inform those at the indoor event and no one else in the 2 weeks prior.

4) When my sister developed the low heart rate (30 bpm), she went to the local ER and didn't warn them of her current COVID positive state until after the doctors tested for it, exposing all the staff and other patients.

Her reaction to everything has essentially been ""no big deal"" or irritation at being forced to quarantine again. They mocked us June '20 when we wouldn't go out to dinner for my nephew's birthday, which is where they caught it the second time. They make it really hard to have sympathy for their predicament, ngl. I love them but I'm really glad we live 3 hours away.

&gt;Almost half of children who contract covid-19 may have lasting symptoms...

&gt;Evidence from the first study of long covid in children suggests that more than half of children aged between 6 and 16 years old who contract the virus have at least one symptom lasting more than 120 days, with 42.6 per cent impaired by these symptoms during daily activities. These interim results are based on periodic assessments of 129 children in Italy who were diagnosed with covid-19 between March and November 2020 at the Gemelli University Hospital in Rome (medRxiv, doi.org/fv9t).

I'm not as gloomy about this issue as this article, but given that chickpox lives in the body until it pops up as a debilitating affliction decades later, I'm open minded as to whether children will get off scot free.

 &gt;Sexual selection is a mode of natural selection in which members of one biological sex choose mates of the other sex to mate with (intersexual selection), and compete with members of the same sex for access to members of the opposite sex (intrasexual selection). These two forms of selection mean that some individuals have greater reproductive success than others within a population, for example because they are more attractive or prefer more attractive partners to produce offspring. In general, males benefit from frequent mating and monopolizing access to a group of fertile females.
