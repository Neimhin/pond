&gt;Are people not still dieing in the EU?

Answering for the Netherlands here. The answer is yes. Would they have not died if they were vaccinated earlier? Possibly.

But then I do not understand what the US is doing with their vaccinations. Something must be going wrong. And this is not a data abnormality, the Dutch spring 2020 wave saw higher deaths than in the US, the Netherlands had no wave during summer 2020, the US fall and winter 2020 waves were higher than the Dutch waves. And then the 2021 winter and spring wave. The Dutch had one, the US did not. These waves were the first ones with vaccines. But deaths stayed much lower in the Netherlands while it had a third wave compared to the US without that wave. Also, excess mortality has been around the expected level of death or even below since the end of January this year. And just as a comparison, the UK had vaccinated a lot as well, and they had an even lower amount of deaths than the Netherlands. So what went wrong?

Yes, it was in fact pointed out that covid is far more dangerous than a vaccine and more plausibly could give her long term health effects. It was pointed out that the vaccine cannot change your DNA or make you infertile. It was pointed out that neither covid nor the vaccine have been around for multiple years and so if she really feels we are in the dark about the long term ramifications of the vaccine, than we are equally in that position regarding the virus itself.

Clearly names based off geography have always unfairly posed a stigma, and I believe organizations like the WHO were trying to move away from this before 2019, but it was really China that singlehandedly caused the normalization of the COVID-19 moniker over a regional name because unlike say Sudan, they had the political clout to pull it off. Obviously they were doing it for selfish reasons, but ultimately they weren't wrong - we shouldn't be naming any diseases after geographic regions at all.

Of course, Trumpist types had a knee-jerk reaction to this and tried to double down on ""Wuhanvirus"" or worse names because they hate China but ostensibly because ""that's how it's always been done"", but this is a terrible argument.

When all this started, I felt the term ""Wuhanvirus"" really did make sense based on previous convention, but after reading fair arguments on it I changed my mind and embraced the term ""COVID-19"" - not out of deference to the authoritarian government of China, but because it seemed right to use a neutral, technical term.

But then variants started popping up, and they kept getting referred by their regions rather than their more technical names, and so it really does make us all look like hypocrites... so I'm glad we have this simplified Greek letter system now.

That caused near a thousand cases of narcolepsy, primarily in young people. That vaccine may have actually cost more life-quality-days than it saved.

It's not very common, but it does happen. As I recall, the swine flu itself, or if it was other vaccines based on the same particle, could also cause the immune system misfire, but this particular vaccine, likely due to the adjuvant, made it far more likely.

The vast majority of vaccines are without a doubt safer than the diseases, but the issues with Pandemrix makes me more interested in figuring out which vaccines are better than other vaccines. And a bit concerned about the apparent desire for vaccines to give a strong immune reaction - it may be a good indicator that you're getting a lot of immune system effects, but as you say, the actual side effects are also due to the immune system.

Foxconn (2317.TW) and its billionaire founder Terry Gou sought permission from Taiwan's government on Tuesday to buy COVID-19 vaccines from Germany's BioNTech SE (22UAy.DE) after the island was hit with a rise in infections.

The proposed purchase of 5 million doses, which would be distributed among the general population, comes after the government ceded to pressure from opposition parties to allow companies, religious groups and local governments to arrange imports.

The Taiwanese government's own deal with BioNTech fell through earlier this year - a problem Taiwan has blamed on pressure from Beijing. China has denied the accusation.

BioNTech declined to comment.

Gou, who has retired from the world's largest contract manufacturer, said on Saturday they hope to airlift the shots from Germany to Taiwan without going via any middlemen.

Taiwan Health Minister Chen Shih-chung expressed his gratitude to Gou and said the government was reviewing the application.

After recording just a handful of daily infections for months, Taiwan is now dealing with relatively large numbers of community transmissions.

It has vaccinated less than 2% of its 23.5 million people, but has almost 30 million shots on order from AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L), Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) and two domestic firms.

While it welcomes help in obtaining vaccines from companies and religious groups, Taiwan's government has stipulated that only it can distribute the shots. Companies and other groups must also provide letters of authorisation from the original manufacturer.

Gou's office said they had provided all the documentation the government had requested.

Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd (600196.SS) has a contract with BioNTech to sell the vaccines in Greater China, including to Taiwan, but Taiwan's government says it has and will only deal with BioNTech in Germany and that it does not trust vaccines from China.

Fosun did not respond to a request for comment on Foxconn and Gou's plans.

China's Taiwan Affairs Office, in a statement to Reuters, reiterated that it was Fosun's commercial right to sell the BioNTech vaccine to Taiwan and that China's government was coordinating with ""relevant parties"" on the island to talk to Fosun. It gave no details.

Outside of Greater China, BioNTech has partnered with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N).

Taiwan's Buddha Light International Association has also proposed importing up to 500,000 shots of Johnson &amp; Johnson's (JNJ.N) vaccine.

Chao Yi, the association's president, said they would be seeking to get in touch with the U.S. pharma giant this week after it had previously expressed willingness to sell the group vaccines. The association is working on the documentation required by the government.

However, Johnson &amp; Johnson said it was only negotiating with government bodies and supranational organisations like the European Commission for vaccine purchases.

""We are not working with or through third parties for vaccine access during the current emergency pandemic period,"" it said in a statement to Reuters.

Taiwan's infection numbers are starting to retreat, but Chen said the island could not be complacent. Numbers have fallen for the past six days, with 327 new cases reported on Tuesday.

If rate is similar for dose 2 then it’s even worse. The above doesn’t even factor in 3 more things: 1) supply of other vaccine and 2) the actual risk of even catching Covid in the first place and 3) the fact that efficacy is not 100% so even if you were vaccinated there is still a risk of catching and dying from Covid. 

There’s a good reason that it’s restricted, it’s not some political game by the world against AZ. There’s also a reason no country is using it in children and also why most countries are pivoting away, even here in the UK we bought 60m Pfizer boosters and no extra AZ. I wouldn’t be surprised if AZ doesn’t really see the light of day in the UK after this first round of vaccinations and that’s fine. Shit happens and safety signals occur but now it’s correct for countries to make the relevant adaptations in the future to protect their populations.

“Currently, no data exist on the interchangeability of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines… at this time there is no reason to believe that mRNA vaccine series completion with a different authorized mRNA vaccine product would result in any additional safety issues or deficiency in protection,” NACI stated.""

They have been waiting in the UK study to officially endorse mixing Pfizer (D2) with AZ (D1). 


1. You can't expect anyone to have the 'right answer from day 1' during a pandemic with a novel virus, where new information is available every day 

2. Your interpretation of what they said is incorrect. Like I said above, they recommended the same vaccine when available, and if it isn't available they recommended (May 21) matching mRNA with mRNA. Soon they will recommend using Pfizer as D2 when AZ is not available.",,,1622574968,{},h086cyp,False,t3_nps3sw,False,True,t1_h07i0j9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nps3sw/canada_to_recommend_mixing_and_matching/h086cyp/,1622675795,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Worst case you may not get a vaccine until crossover round 2. Who knows when that will occur! And they may not tell me which one I received. What the heck?!?!

After my 2nd shot I got my butt kicked! Fever and headache for 2 days. After 2 days of rest I was back to normal! I'm pretty sure I received a legit vaccine! Placebo was stated to be saline solution which wouldn't have done that. I hope the blood draws gave the clinic enough data. After my final blood draw, I got a j&amp;j vaccine in order to have a vaccine card as proof I'm fully vaccinated.

[],,jdorje,,,[],,,,text,t2_ii7rl,False,False,[],"Vaccine ""efficacy"" is always measured as reduction in positive tests or symptomatic positive tests.  But this isn't really an important thing in itself.  The important things are sterilizing immunity (the best) and protective immunity (secondary target).

Sterilizing immunity is a reduction in how well you can transmit the virus.  We basically just can't measure this without challenge trials or some other shenanigans.  But we can estimate it from the reduction in positive tests + reduction in viral load after a positive test + reduction in time you're contagious, all of which we can sort of measure.  We know that two-dose mRNA vaccines against B.1.1.7 give very nearly 100% sterilizing immunity, but other vaccines may be much worse and still let you spread the virus.  If you have sterilizing immunity then not only are you protected, but everyone around you is protected from you.  Good sterilizing immunity requires a lot of antibodies, since you need to kill off the virus before your immune system starts really ramping up.

Protective immunity is often touted as ""the most important thing"", but it's basically just worse than sterilizing.  We actually can measure this, as efficacy against hospitalization or death of the vaccine, but the sample sizes are just far too low to get good numbers in the trials and real-world data has confounding factors that make it really inaccurate.  But it seems quite clear that a single exposure or vaccine dose is going to give good protective immunity, and a two-dose regimen will send it nearly to 100%. Protective immunity probably lasts years or decades due to the creation of T and B cells that can reproduce to stay around indefinitely in your bone marrow and ""ramp up"" when you are exposed in future.",,,1622574063,{},h084cgi,False,t3_nox6m6,False,True,t1_h07zceg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nox6m6/daily_discussion_thread_may_31_2021/h084cgi/,1622674429,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The 13 fatalities were 10 men and three women, aged 60-90, who died between May 24 and 31, the CECC said.

One of the patients who passed away did not die of COVID-19, however, but drowned, CECC spokesperson Chuang Jen-hsiang (莊人祥) said at a press briefing.

The patient, a man in his 60s, was only confirmed to have been infected with COVID-19 after a test was conducted postmortem, and the circumstances surrounding his death are being investigated, Chuang said.

When asked by reporters why a COVID-19 test was performed, Chuang said that tests have been conducted in cases where police officers are uncertain over the cause of death, including when someone passes away at home.

Of the 327 domestic infections reported Tuesday, 262 were newly confirmed infections and 65 were from a backlog of test results confirmed over the past week, according to the CECC.

New Taipei reported 166 cases, the highest of any locality, followed by Taipei with 87, Taoyuan with 23, Changhua County with 12 and Taichung with 10.
Keelung confirmed eight, Yilan County five, Chiayi County four, and three each were reported in Hualien and Taitung counties.

Miaoli County reported two cases, while one each was reported in the cities of Tainan and Kaohsiung and Penghu and Hsinchu counties.

The CECC said 18 of these cases had unknown sources of infection.

In addition to domestic cases, Taiwan also reported five imported cases on Tuesday, all involving Philippine nationals who had come to work in Taiwan.

Taiwan has confirmed 8,842 cases of COVID-19 since the outbreak began early in 2020, of which more than 7,500 are domestic cases reported since May 15, when Taiwan first reported over 100 domestic infections in a single day.

The country has reported 137 deaths from the disease, including 123 in the past two weeks.

And to add onto that, there's documentation where a reporter brought the subject of the ""gay plague"" up in a white house press briefing during Reagan's tenure, and he's absolutely laughed at for even having a modicum of interest in the story:

&gt;Q: Larry, does the President have any reaction to the announcement—the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, that AIDS is now an epidemic and have over 600 cases?    
MR. SPEAKES: What’s AIDS?    
Q: Over a third of them have died. It’s known as “gay plague.” (Laughter.) No, it is. I mean it’s a pretty serious thing that one in every three people that get this have died. And I wondered if the President is aware of it?    
MR. SPEAKES: I don’t have it. Do you? (Laughter.)    
Q: No, I don’t.    
MR. SPEAKES: You didn’t answer my question.    
Q: Well, I just wondered, does the President—    
MR. SPEAKES: How do you know? (Laughter.)    
Q: In other words, the White House looks on this as a great joke?

Some hospitals still report deaths on public holidays and weekends, but not all of them (it probably depends on whether there is anyone doing admin on those days, or if registration services are open).

So here in the UK we always have lower than average death figures on weekends and public holidays, and then a higher death figure on the first full working day after.

Daily deaths are really low right now. Yesterday's count was 1 death, today's count 0. That was the first weekend or public holiday day where we've had 0 deaths reported, which just shows that the general situation  is going well. It really is good news.

But tomorrow there will likely be some further deaths from the public holiday reported. I really really hope its 0 again, but it seems unlikely given the usual trend.

&gt;

&gt; * A person has a disability if he or she is subject to an adverse employment action and is believed to have a physical or mental impairment that is not transitory (lasting or expected to last six months or less) and minor (even if he or she does not have such an impairment).

However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data.

While COVID is a local phenomenon so every city or even area within a city is different, taking the national numbers, an average person was 7-10X more likely to get COVID in the month of January than in the month of May. Even accounting for the fact they are unvaccinated, they were 3-5X more likely to get it in January than May (since almost all cases were un the unvaccinated so you have to ""subtract"" the vaccinated population from per capita risk). 

Exposure risk trumps vaccine efficacy any day of the week. By late summer, in areas that are highly vaccinated (e.g. New England) it will be safer to be unvaccinated in Massachusetts than vaccinated in Mississippi because cases will be almost nonexistant in Massachusetts due to (near) herd immunity. If exposure risk is 20X higher, the benefit of the vaccine is effectively neutralized (unfortunately moreso in the most vulnerable populations where efficacy is lower). 

This is why vaccinations are so important. Pawning off and saying ""the unvaccinated are taking their own risk"" is true, but they are also impacting others. The good thing is that these vaccines are so effective that for most age groups the risk becomes trivial, but it doesn't change the fact that anti-vaxxers affect everyone living around them - they get the benefit of being around vaccinated people (lower exposure risk) but contribute to there being any exposure risk at all.",,,1622552268,{},h06sgra,False,t3_npbcbb,False,False,t1_h05q1dk,/r/Coronavirus/comments/npbcbb/us_covid_cases_near_pandemic_low_as_travel_picks/h06sgra/,1622642235,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Sounds scary, right? Does the COVID vaccine teach our immune system to attack the placenta?

Not at all. Its the same principle as us sharing about 60% of our DNA with bananas - while we share DNA, there's still a very obvious fundamental difference between a human being and a banana. It's the same thing for this protein - while they share code, its like the fact that balloon and ballerina share the fist 4 letters in their word. This doesn't mean that a ballerina will confuse themselves with a balloon!

People get tired of them, some people -- in countries without decent government support -- literally face starvation if they can't work. So in this sense, they don't work forever.

1. But even if a country *can* keep it going and going and going, there is the problem of more contagious variants. So Vietnam basically eradicated covid within their borders, with a certain *level* of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Let's say that level brought the R-value down from 1.4 to 0.8... Even if they could keep it up for years, the rest of the world is busy incubating variants, and lo! Something gets into Vietnam that has an R of 2.2.

Science is empirical.  Observations have to be made to justify hypotheses, even if the hypotheses are eminently reasonable, and even if they turn out to be right.

In my field, before I prove a theorem, I can't say that I *know* it to be true, even if I strongly suspect it is and then it later turns out to be (say, because I proved it).  My belief can be right, but it needs to be justified.

I'm not saying that all justified true belief is knowledge, but even true belief that is not yet justified cannot be called knowledge, and scientific beliefs that have not been empirically verified are (almost?) never justified to the degree that we can call them knowledge.  Not in this sort of context, anyway.

That's why the experiments and analyses are done.

So it doesn't matter if I'm as smart as a medical researcher or not.  What matters is that I can't claim to know the result of research that hasn't been done yet, even if it's a case where an educated guess is likely to turn out to be right.

I'm trying to understand what this means precisely.

Are you aware of any evidence that one dose reduces severity against this variant specifically?

However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data.

I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Pfizer vaccine, is in fact, BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine, or as I've recently taken to calling it, BioNTech plus Pfizer vaccine. Pfizer did not develop the vaccine itself, but rather another company called BioNTech came up with the original formula which was then trialed by Pfizer to become the vaccine we know today.

Most people who have been injected the vaccine refer to it as Pfizer vaccine every day, without realizing it.
Through a peculiar turn of events, the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine which is widely used today is often called ""Pfizer"", and many of its recipients are not aware that it is basically the vaccine BioNTech developed initially.

There really is a Pfizer contribution to the vaccine, and these people have been injected with it, but it is just a part of the vaccine they were given. Pfizer is the distributor and responsible for running the clinical trials. The clinical trials are an essential part of a vaccine, but useless by itself; it can only function if it was developed in the first place. Hence, the Pfizer vaccine can only work if it was developed in the first place by BioNTech: the whole vaccine is basically BioNTech with Pfizer contributions, or BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine.

UK taxpayers also funded the development of a vaccine via Oxford university which it was stipulated had to be sold at cost to help developing countries.

Also your ""educate yourself"" link doesn't even mention that phsyical force is violence, it simply states, that states have a monopoly on the use of physical force. I'll speak in simple terms,

Not all phsyical force is violence, violence only occurs when their is an intention to harm someone, but all violence uses physical force. Understand? Or are your gonna try linking garbage again that literally doesn't prove your point.

Weber claims that the state is the ""only human Gemeinschaft which lays claim to the monopoly on the legitimated use of physical force.""

Violence: 
Behavior or treatment in which physical force is exerted for the purpose of causing damage or injury. - https://www.wordnik.com/words/violence

The contents of your ""educate yourself"" link:

While the monopoly on violence as the defining conception of the state was first described in sociology by Max Weber in his essay Politics as a Vocation (1919),[1] the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force is a core concept of modern public law, which goes back to French jurist and political philosopher Jean Bodin's 1576 work Les Six livres de la République and English philosopher Thomas Hobbes' 1651 book Leviathan. Weber claims that the state is the ""only human Gemeinschaft which lays claim to the monopoly on the legitimated use of physical force. However, this monopoly is limited to a certain geographical area, and in fact this limitation to a particular area is one of the things that defines a state.""[2] In other words, Weber describes the state as any organization that succeeds in holding the exclusive right to use, threaten, or authorize physical force against residents of its territory.

There was an order for an Australian developed vaccine, but it didn't work out.

There is Australian produced AZ (plus some AZ imports), but that is delivering slower than planned for and is for over 50s. The supply of that will continue to increase.

There is also Pfizer, but that is currently in short supply. The order didn't get signed until somewhat late, so Australia is further down the delivery list.

I recall some Moderna has been ordered too.

Also slow uptake even when vaccination became available. I was able to book in at my GP a few days after I first became eligible.  Now the wait list at my GP has increased to 2 or 3 weeks, but there are plenty of times available.

The latest outbreak saw the number of vaccinations per day increase 2 or 3 fold very quickly, so I don't think supply was too constrained. 

Some eligible for AZ may have been waiting for Pfizer since there is no international travel and local transmission was low or zero.

In addition, Merck, the original patent holder of ivermectin, has released the [following statement](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/):

&gt; Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today affirmed its position regarding use of ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

&gt; * No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

&gt; * No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;

&gt; * A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.

&gt; We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.

While I know you're probably just lamenting your situation I would actually argue that no that may not be the best way to handle it. Herd immunity (or effective herd immunity where R&lt;1 and cases go on the decline) requires a very high level of immunity within the population. So lets say for example that we vaccinate the world equally and ever country has about 30% of their population vaccinated. That would lead to no reduction in cases anywhere since no country would have enough immunity to drive the R value below 1. The actual best case scenario would be to over-vaccinate the hardest hit areas where the virus is spreading in order to drop the R value in those places before focusing on other areas with lower case loads. While that's not what we are doing either since everything in our world is based on money it could make an argument that vaccinating the US quickly is not a bad thing for the world. Though yes now you would want to send the vaccines to India, Brazil, etc (which is exactly what is going to happen)",,,1622580657,{},h08iq4a,False,t3_nq1qom,False,False,t1_h08828a,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nq1qom/vermont_nearing_80_of_eligible_residents_getting/h08iq4a/,1622683715,11,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Right. Considering something as fact requires high quality evidence to confirm. 

This is a fundamental tenet of critical and scientific thinking. It is foundational to building a reliable and accurate base of knowledge.

If you find this confusing, may I direct you to read Carl Sagan's ""A Demon-Haunted World"" particularly Part 1 as I think this may help to explain it a little better. The example of the dragon in the garage really gets at it.

Example: If I tell you there is a teapot orbiting the sun between the orbits of mars and earth do you believe it?  I can not provide high quality evidence (or even low quality evidence) proving it is there. Without proof, there is no reason to believe it actually exists. Otherwise we would have to believe every statement, no matter how ridiculous.

And we would be unable to tell fact from fiction and we would have been unable to build the body of knowledge that has led to scientific advancement in so many areas.

&gt; So all those people who felt COVID wasn't confirmed as a threat 

Well, let me interrupt right there. 

What people ""feel"" isn't a reliable source of knowledge; feelings do not constitute evidence. 

High quality evidence about COVID-19 was obtained through the scientific method and subject to the process of scientific peer review and it quite clearly established as fact that COVID-19 was a threat.

[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9)  


Scripps is a reputable institution and I have no reason to doubt the quality of their research.   
""It is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through laboratory manipulation of a related SARS-CoV-like coronavirus. As noted above, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is optimized for binding to human ACE2 with an efficient solution different from those previously predicted. Furthermore, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one of the several reverse-genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would probably have been used. However, the genetic data irrefutably show that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone.""

He then goes on to state reasons why natural emergence is more likely.  


\---

Improbable isn't the same thing as impossible.  
There are also several scenarios not considered.  
\* The virus was partially adapted to humans but further bred or enhanced.  
\* The Wuhan Institute of Virology is more advanced than we realized and used techniques not fully understood.  
\* The WIH may have learned that there are multiple coronaviruses already adapted to humans that haven't managed to cause an outbreak. They collected these, found a candidate that they believed could would cause minimum damage to China and maximum damage outside of their country, and intentionally released it.",,,1622509514,{},h05577w,False,t3_nnzbbc,False,True,t1_gzyddnn,/r/Coronavirus/comments/nnzbbc/we_need_to_know_how_covid19_emerged_so_we_can/h05577w/,1622607359,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

You're not wrong about less testing = less chance of finding a positive case, but in UK's case, that isn't the case. Rather, the easing of restrictions and less masking is what caused it - which means there were enough unvaccinated people to cause an increase in daily cases, even after 70+% of the UK is partially vaccinated.

Fourth, the UK has used *mostly* AZ vaccine, which we know has poor sterilizing immunity compared to mRNA.  

Despite all the above, they're still giving 500k vaccine doses a day while new infections are at most 10k.

We've never done variant-naming for the general public before. Influenza A, B, etc... are different viruses within the same family, not different variants of the same virus.

Until covid-19, there has never been any media attention for virus variants. Partially because rapid mass sequencing is becoming more and more available and partially because there's never been a good reason to report about variants.

There are naming schemes for variants that work fine for experts. Schemes that use names like ""B.1.1.7"".

1) I never said anything about people putting their lives on hold, I said people who won't get vaccinated put people who can't get vaccinated at risk. Herd immunity only works when enough of the population is vaccinated, so those who are fit to get the shot should get the shot as it protects them AND others who can't get the shot.

2) 'put their life on hold' - cry me a River sweetheart, we've all spent the last year with our lives on hold for exactly that reason. Most of us who get covid will be fine, but enough of is won't that everyone had to lockdown and businesses had to close. Things are opening up now, but if people don't get vaccinated then the pool of hosts remains high and so does the risk of further mutation. There are always going to be terrible people who won't get vaccinated, won't wear a mask and won't do anything at all to preserve a life other than their own, but unless that's you you'd understand why it's important for everyone to do EVERYTHING THEY CAN not to fuck over the vulnerable.",,,1622542908,{},h06f3lc,False,t3_np3ht4,False,False,t1_h06d4d4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/np3ht4/universal_orlando_masks_no_longer_required/h06f3lc/,1622633922,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

HIV has many many strains that make it difficult to create a single vaccine, and there are even more [fundamental issues](https://www.verywellhealth.com/hiv-vaccine-development-4057071) that hamper vaccines from being effective: 

&gt;Fighting HIV demands a robust response from the immune system, and this again where systems fail. Traditionally, specialized white blood cells called CD4 T-cells initiate the response by signaling killer cells to the site of the infection. Ironically, these are the very cells that HIV targets for infection. By doing so, HIV hobbles the body’s ability to defend itself as the CD4 population is systematically depleted, resulting in the eventual breakdown of defenses called immune exhaustion.
&gt;
&gt;Finally, the eradication of HIV is thwarted by the virus’ ability to hide from the body’s immune defenses. Soon after infection, while other HIV is circulating freely in the bloodstream, a subset of virus (called provirus) embeds itself in hidden cellular sanctuaries (called latent reservoirs). Once inside these cells, HIV is shielded from detection.

It is possible that the mRNA vaccines will create such a strong response that it will be neutralizing before HIV can take hold. But there is no guarantee, especially given that HIV attacks the very immune cells meant to detect and stop it.

&gt; Approval takes longer. They need at least six solid months of data and then it will take at least another six months for the FDA to review it all.  So if the Pfizer Biontech vaccine gets approved it would happen later this year.
&gt; 
&gt; ""The only difference really between the emergency use and the licensure is that volunteers are observed for a longer period of time to see the duration of protection, and if there might be rare adverse events that occurred down the road,"" explains Dr. William Schaffner from Vanderbilt University.

&gt;It's true that the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines have emergency use authorization from the FDA and not full approval yet.
But **that's only because not enough time has passed to show how long the vaccines stay effective**, Offit said.

&gt;""Frankly, the only real difference was in length of follow-up,"" he said. ""Typically, you like to see efficacy for a year or two years.""

&gt;He stressed that the **vaccines' EUA status doesn't mean they're less safe. As a member of the FDA vaccine advisory committee, Offit said the vaccines are reviewed with the same level of scrutiny as they would to get full approval**.

The incident of mortality is certainly NOT due to the vaccine, its very likely due to the disease killing them before enough of an immune response is generated.  

If there was a reaction to the vaccine, it would happen right away.  Anaphylaxis is something that could definitely kill you, and it's a known side effect of the vaccine (small % of people get it) - which is why it's administered in a medical setting with trained personnel.  Anyone can jab a shot into arms, but treating the anaphylaxis is the trick.    I have no doubt SOMEBODY has died due to this, but it must be so incredibly low that it's a near non-event.  Maybe 1 in a million, maybe lower.  We know what happened with the JnJ vaccine, there was concern over blood clots being a side effect, so they stopped dosing while they figured it out (again a very very rare event).  

The article mentioned COVID mortality which is probably fairly accurate, lower in young people, quite high in the elderly.  

All this to say - there is no way you can really compare the mortality of the vaccine to the mortality of the disease, it's easily 1000x higher.  It's like driving a car vs flying.

The problem I'm having with my sister's reasoning, as clearly stated the first time, is NOT that she's stupid for not trusting pharmacy completely and blindly, but rather that she is selective about this solipsistic ""you can't know"" reaoning. OK, fuck it, we can't know the long term years-later effects of a covid vaccine. By equal measure, we can't know the long term years-later effect of *getting the damned virus*. For the first, she says she's not willing to take any risk with what she can't know. For the second, she's suddenly willing to take the risk. I asked her to explain the basis on which she is making this distinction, and she could not tell me. 

I put ""long term effects"" in quotes in the original comment not to mock the very idea of them being possible in general, but rather because I'm exasperated at her selective care for this supposed risk of chronic issues or fertility loss. These long term effects matter when taking about the vaccine, but immediately stop mattering to her when taking about the virus. She has done precisely nothing to ask if covid could cause fertility issues, for instance. 

Given that the vaccine somehow became political and a good swathe of my family scream constantly about whatever FOX news has said, I'm going with that being the actual reason she's against the vaccine. If her concern for long term effects is selective and she can't explain why, than its probably not the genuine reason. Hence, quotation marks.

I'm also not seeing any articles about India's rapidly-declining COVID cases. The 7-day average in India is half of what it was three weeks ago. It still is bad there, but the situation is improving rapidly. Everyone I tell this to doesn't know that because the media doesn't seem to be covering this. They just want to report stuff that scares people. This is why no one trusts the media anymore. It's really sad.

I'm not concerned about ill-effects from getting Moderna as the second dose but it'd piss me off to no end to find out that being immunized via mix-and-match will bar me from hassle-free international travel compared to other travellers who had been vaccinated per Big Pharma's instructions all along (i.e. no mix-and-match *and* on timelines used in the trials rather than hunches from Bonnie Henry and/or recommendations from NACI). It simply doesn't/didn't have to be this way, no matter what proponents of our chaotic vaccine rollout insist.

If for the purposes of unrestricted/hassle-free international travel I'd need to be vaccinated per Big Pharma's prescriptions, and somehow I couldn't get Pfizer for my second dose then I'd try like hell to get J&amp;J instead. At least that's one-and-done with its administration impervious to public health shenanigans involving dosing. In the eyes of border guards, that one shot of J&amp;J should/would be less questionable than being immunized using Pfizer first and Moderna second.

In the bigger picture, it's as if Canada as a whole has deliberately struggled with administering any two-dose vaccine as instructed. No matter if the instructions had been given in English or French and seeing how the rest of the world has been doing it consistently while facing the same problem of demand far outstripping supply.

I think that the first inkling we'll have on the second-order effects of institutionalized mix-and-match will come after Trudeau comes back from the G7 meeting later this month.

&gt; a single exposure or vaccine dose is going to give good protective immunity

This seems like good news for my personal decision-making, as I'm in that awkward period between one-dose and two-doses and the Delta variant is rampant around here.
