Those go away for me once every adult *who wants it* has been given the opportunity.

Furthermore, if we don’t reach herd immunity purely because of recalcitrant anti-vaxers, then the rate we are at now doesn’t really matter as you implied... getting to 4 million a day a few weeks earlier doesn’t convince those who are eligible but won’t accept to relent, so your comment on how “we should be at 4m” still doesn’t make sense.

On that I understand it is as good as any other vaccine. So, before this latest speedbump I was pretty much onboard for my part.

Perfectly young and healthy people should not die from vaccines though. They just shouldn't. You will never get anyone to trust the system with that risk. And if they do, it should be a ""it was an undiagnosed something"", ""She had taken some medication we did not know of, and it caused an effect"", ""her something something was weakened due to y"" ... and so on. It has to be a reason other than the vaccine, and I think it is the right approach to halt. Show that you value individuals as much as the common good.

But I understand too why someone would disagree, and I think it's just a variant of the same overall theme. Like you do not only look at the total number of participants in a test. You have of course also people representing every group of ages, sexes, place of birth, race etc. So the individual or group of certain individuals is weighed in. Maybe you are confident in that then, or you can have a threshold which determines if something happens that you don't expect, you stop, look at the data and reevaluate. Some may say ""lets do this, but keep vaccinating"" and some will think even that is too high risk.
It should not be such a big fuzz that a single country might chose this approach and another want to continue. It isn't a nation vs nation vaccine fight.

&gt; The document, released in January, drew little attention at first. But that changed on Monday when the official Twitter account for the Sputnik V vaccine posted a screenshot of the previously overlooked claim and criticized the United States for effectively blocking Russia’s attempts at vaccine diplomacy.

&gt; “We believe countries should work together to save lives,” the tweet read. “Efforts to undermine the vaccines are unethical and are costing lives.”

...

&gt; Initial skepticism toward Russia’s coronavirus vaccine was rooted in more than just politics: The shot was released before it could undergo the extensive vetting that most countries require.

I think because often the metrics you tie to green/yellow/red when infections are ramping up are much different than the metrics you would use to ramp down.

When ramping up, hospitalizations, deaths etc were lagging metrics and not what you want to use because by the time they move, it's too late.  So use % positivity, case counts per 100k, etc.  But when ramping down, those ARE the metrics you want to use because they're showing that you've accomplished what you set out to accomplish, whereas case count per 100k will always have a relatively high floor until children are vaccinated.",,,1615916822,{},gr59tnc,False,t3_m6as44,False,True,t1_gr4zipg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m6as44/wyoming_lifts_mask_mandate_and_opens_to_full/gr59tnc/,1615918948,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Booster shots won't come in until immunity wanes which might be a year, might be two... we don't know yet. But when it does, since coronavirus is pretty assuredly endemic, we'll want a booster.

«In a woman from the province of Novara we discovered a 'special' mutation of the virus which is an unusual combination of known and new variants». The virologist of the University of Milan-Bicocca, Francesco Broccolo, reported this to the Adnkronos Salute agency. ""This mutation includes the characteristics of the English and Nigerian variants, plus four mutations so far not associated with any particular variant"", the virologist specifies, ensuring that ""the patient is well and is in quarantine, the husband is negative. These - he says - are interesting and reassuring elements that must be reiterated ».

The sequencing of the ""special"" case highlighted ""a very rare mutation described only in very few samples, less than 20 in the world - warns Broccolo - These peculiarities tell us that the mutation could be immunodominant and could change the efficiency of vaccines, but that's all to be seen.

It's a little bit of both, perhaps.  Or put more precisely, good in moderation and bad for those who are naturally physiologically inclined to overproduce it:

&gt;The overproduction of NO as an inﬂammatory mediator can lead to tissue destruction such as in inﬂammatory autoimmune diseases. Thus, depending on the concentration of NO, it can process pro- or anti-inﬂammatory effects. As a result NO is called ‘double-edged sword’ or ‘Jekll and Hide’(Pfeilschifter et al., 1996)

However, it seems like the main difference between those cases and the German ones is that the six German cases had thrombocytopenia as well as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (from my understanding) whereas the US cases were primarily just thrombocytopenia.

Here's the relevant part of the NY Times article:

""Hematologists with expertise in treating immune thrombocytopenia said they suspected that the vaccine did play a role. But they said that cases after vaccination were likely to be exceedingly rare, possibly the result of  an unknown predisposition in some people to react to the vaccine by developing an immune response that destroys their platelets. The disorder has occurred, rarely, in people who received other inoculations, particularly the measles-mumps-rubella one.

“I think it is possible that there is an association,” Dr. James Bussel, a hematologist and professor emeritus at Weill Cornell Medicine who has written more than 300 scientific articles on the platelet disorder, said in an interview. “I’m assuming there’s something that made the people who developed thrombocytopenia susceptible, given what a tiny percentage of recipients they are.”

He added: “Having it happen after a vaccine is well-known and has been seen with many other vaccines. Why it happens, we don’t know.”

Dr. Bussel said it was important to share information about the cases, because severe thrombocytopenia can be serious, and physicians need to know how to treat it. Sometimes the condition resists standard therapies, and if very low platelet counts persist, the patient faces an increasing risk of severe bleeding and even brain hemorrhage.

A few of the patients had previously had platelet disorders or other autoimmune  conditions that might have made them vulnerable, Dr. Bussel (pronounced Bew-SELL) said. People can have low platelets without symptoms, and it is possible that in some, a vaccine reaction could drop the level further, to a point where it becomes apparent by causing bruises or bleeding, Dr. Bussel said.

Dr. Jerry L. Spivak, an expert on blood disorders at Johns Hopkins University, also said the connection to the vaccine appeared real, but predicted that cases would be exceedingly  rare and called them “idiosyncratic,” perhaps related to underlying traits in individual   patients.""",,,1615934330,{},gr6bulz,False,t3_m6ii4p,False,True,t1_gr5ze7c,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m6ii4p/the_damage_is_done_europes_caution_over/gr6bulz/,1615938677,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

The EU is dropping the ball a lot on vaccinations, same with Japan.  Even if you guys in the states get everything ""under control.""

My guess is there is going to be the odd country in the late summer that is going to accept travelers but not most of them.  You could probably get away with doing some bullshit like traveling to a country that wasn't hit hard by COVID and traveling out of there but if you are that much of an ass you could probably do that now.

So in that corner case, I would then find the policy non-discriminatory.  


One of the facets of discrimination is that it is unjust, and so I believe that with a large enough difference in risk, the disqualifying of someone on the basis of their sexual habits is not discrimination.

Why? Because you say so?

Obviously, since the point under discussion here is the effect of supposedly overcrowded hospitals in the overall outcome.

&gt; that are high for Brazil with an average age of 30 years. the average age in Germany is 45 years.

That's an argument, but you need to show how strong that correlation is. The simple fact is that Brazil is doing better than most Latin American countries with similar demographics, so I doubt there's a very strong correlation there.

&gt;Manaus has 8x more deaths than Hamburg, even if they have a similar pop size.

We're talking about the country ratio, which averages good and bad decisions . If you're going to single out locations and make comparisons without context, you're just desperately trying to support your political argument.

&gt;The numbers will only get worst every week for Brazil and more variants wil appear thanks to Bolsonaro and his no-action policy.

What ""no-action"" policy? The Supreme Court ruled the state governors had autonomy to decide how to handle the pandemic. Why are you putting all blame on the federal government, which had their hands tied, and not on the governors and mayors who made bad decisions?

&gt;disgusting

&gt; JONES: The whole next week was a lot of manipulating things and a lot of back and forth with the epidemiologists, who were extremely uncomfortable with the way that this was being managed. And then eventually the night before the first phase of reopening, I was asked to actually delete and then hide data from the public. I said I wanted in writing that directive from my boss telling me to do that before I would do it. I said it was the wrong call, and it was a mistake to have this information that was available to the public and just take it away. I mean, I had set up the data feeds to report directly to the CDC, to Johns Hopkins. Our department emergency management depended on this data feed, every press outlet in the state and country. I worked very hard to make sure that everybody had access to this data and that it was right every day. And as soon as we took it down, all of those links essentially broke and crashed all of their websites. So less than an hour later, I was asked to put it back up, and then the next day, I was told I was no longer working on the dashboard.
&gt; 
&gt; MARTIN: Is it your understanding that you were dismissed from the project because you refused to manipulate the data?
&gt; 
&gt; JONES: Yes, absolutely. I think that as soon as I said no to one of the many things that they were doing that weren't ethical, they realized that the data wasn't so much the problem as the data keeper. And by moving me out of the way, they could do whatever they wanted, show whatever they wanted, create this image that things were improving or that it was safe using a tool that I built, which was extremely disappointing.

I agree with you, It truly is an unfortunate situation, the deaths of these people. I think attributing any strange death without seeing any pattern in the data or even providing more information to suggest there's an issue is just reckless reporting(which is what this bbc report is saying and as I said before what the norwegians said as well, that it wasn't above average incidence of blood clots vs the non vaccinated population just a rare and unusual occurrence). In these times with misinformation, misquotes and mistrust in science and medicine being so rampant in every day society, I think the reporting not the caution is what's been terribly reckless as the headlines sometimes didn't even reflect the information in the articles. I think the actions don't fit, and this situation could have been handled better considering other vaccines have had similar claims laid against them more specifically, pfizer, but that's just my opinion.

As for the trials I think that's standard, the issues with AZ was the number of participants no in the age groups? It was the smallest of all the trials. Pfizer and moderna were roughly 20,000 people in each group(vaccine and placebo) vs the 12,000 per group in AZ, but all trials are done across multiple countries and multiple ethnic groups both AZ and pfizer were done across 4 countries the Jand J was done across 8 including south africa with parts of the trial concluding in december so there are in the same boat as there data wouldn't be fully out. Both pfizer and AZ started trials in may iirc and concluded around October I want to say but the news of vaccines started breaking around November but anyway this isn't really the issue.

Absolutely. We kind of have to,. as this is a global thing that hasn't been seen for decades or longer.

Yep. Not only is it all very tricky,. but the dynamics and numbers can vary from State to State (or even City by City.. based on things like demographics.

(there wasn't any ""simple or easy answer"" when we 1st discovered this.. and we're even (exponentially) further away from ""simple or easy answers"" now that we've bungled our response for so long.

By the time we even realized what was going on.. the virus was already ""4 to 14 days"" ahead of us. (if not longer,. it had probably been circulating in the US since Dec or Jan)

Convincing people to ""do the right thing **BEFORE** a problem arises"".. is a notoriously difficult thing to do. It's like trying to convince people to ""save for a rainy day"" or ""eat healthier so you don't get heart-disease 30 years from now."".

But let’s go question-by-question.

What will the essential workers do when the schools shut down with COVID outbreaks? Probably just what they’ve been doing now—put their kids in low-quality online classes—but only for two weeks. And most schools don’t shut down fully for every COVID case. They only quarantine the infected student and those they’ve had contact with. And with the way schools are re-opening, student contact with other students is fairly limited.

What will these essential workers do when their child comes down with COVID? Their children are highly unlikely to have severe COVID—it’s less of a risk for children than the flu. So they’ll probably do whatever they do when their kids get the flu. Do we need better leave policies? Yes, but we don’t shut down school during flu season.

Parents who are still concerned or who have high-risk kids can choose to keep their kids out of school—almost everywhere offers a fully-remote option. But at least give the parents the choice. Let them decide if their kids’ education is worth the COVID risk to their family. Keep in mind essential workers have been prioritized for the vaccine.

“A pile of essential worker corpses.” Well according to the CDC mortality statistics, over 80% of COVID deaths have been in people over 65. And people who are in the older part of that age group are at the most risk. So the corpses have been from retirees, not essential workers. And elderly people and essential workers have all been prioritized for vaccines. 20%+ of the US has received at least one dose of the vaccine, and we vaccinate over 2M people per day (and improving). So what pile of essential worker corpses?

All of the issues you discuss are improvements that will take months or years to implement. Re-opening schools can happen in a matter of weeks.

At least let working class families make the cost/benefit analysis themselves. They can choose to keep their kids remote or send them back to school.

**Millions of people have already been vaccinated with the Astra Zeneca vaccine - without any major abnormalities.** **There are now reports of very rare cerebral vein thromboses.** **Is there a connection?** **Answers to the most important questions.** 

**How is the vaccination break justified?**

The Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI), which is responsible for the safety of vaccines in Germany, recommends ""after intensive consultation"" to temporarily suspend vaccinations with the Astra Zeneca vaccine. The reasons are ""serious thrombotic"" events that have occurred in Germany and Europe. The experts are concerned about the noticeable accumulation of very rare sinus vein thromboses, i.e. blockages of the cerebral veins, also known as cerebral vein thromboses. The decision concerns both initial and follow-up vaccinations. The data are analyzed and evaluated by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

**What should people watch out for who have recently been vaccinated with the Astra Zeneca vaccine?**

Overall, the complications described are extremely rare. The Paul Ehrlich Institute nevertheless advises that people who receive the vaccine from Astra Zeneca and who still have symptoms more than four days after the vaccination should consult a doctor. Severe, persistent headaches or punctiform skin bleeding (petechiae) can be typical symptoms.

**How high is the risk of thrombosis in connection with vaccinations and in general?**

Thromboses and pulmonary embolisms after vaccinations, i.e. blood clots that tend to form in the leg and pelvic veins, have been reported for days. If such a plug loosens and gets into the lungs with the bloodstream, it can cause life-threatening blockages there. These thromboembolic complications can be caused by *any* corona vaccine, but are rare. In addition, the reported frequency is many times lower than that of Covid-19 disease, in which up to 15 percent of patients get a thrombosis.

**What are cerebral or sinus vein thromboses?**

However, the PEI did not suspend vaccination with the Astra-Zeneca vaccine because of the general risk of thrombosis, ===&gt;but because of the very rare sinus vein thrombosis. So far, around 1.7 million doses of the Astra Zeneca vaccine have been inoculated in Germany. Six women between the ages of 20 and 50 suffered sinus vein thrombosis four to 16 days after vaccination. Another case of cerebral haemorrhage due to a lack of blood platelets was medically very comparable, the Paul Ehrlich Institute announced on Tuesday. Three of the seven people affected died, this is an ""overly accidental"" signal.

I don't think so. I'm not as entrenched in the EU vs GB war though so I might not be getting all the news/propaganda.

As far as halting vaccination goes, I think the problem is that the discussion has become political, and that both politicians and media are using false information or at least taken out of context / not properly analyzed information in their narratives.

Take the AZ efficiency case. As I understood, the trials were not the same / had the same kind of people in them, or even done on people from the same countries, so there could be a chance that people who got Covid after being vaccinated with AZ and Pfizer/Moderna vaccines got infected with different strains. So, which vaccine was actually efficient against what strain isn't really known from the initial trials.

They could have just said ""okay, while we wait for this data, we vaccinate only young people"". End of story. But tabloids and even some politicians are allowed to play games with that and spin it out of context.

Then we get this case, which may or may not be random events. It may be that because it is mostly young, and possibly also mostly female HCW who have got the vaccine, statistics are being thrown off, which means in their specific group, the chance of it happening is non-random/above random compared to the regular population. I think if this is the case, it is wise to halt vaccination tbh. It is just part of the process, and as we agree on, boosts confidence in vaccines in the end.

It is unfortunate for the people who are waiting for vaccinations, but I think at least in Norway, there is enough Pfizer/Moderna arriving to get old people vaccinated and people at higher risk. Then for the rest of us, we just got to wait a little bit longer.
I'm fine with this, but I can see how someone who aren't getting any other vaccine than AZ might not be, or someone not getting vaccines at all.

I read this quite often, but i'm sure, it is the other way round.

The news about the cases has been out for days. 

People have already been very concerned about AZ.

Stoping the use of AZ now until the cases are investigated shows that the government takes it seriously. This helps building trust in the other vaccines directly. And even trust in AZ will get better, if the inverstigation shows no connection to those cases.

On the other hand, not stoping the use of AZ would have crippled trust in all vacines, because the government would look like not caring about those cases.

CJD is a prion disease, essentially a protein that became infectious to the body. Once this occurs, it's simply unstoppable - it can't be controlled with medicine.

Sporadic CJD is thought to occur naturally when a perfectly harmless protein in the body ""misfolds"" and turns in to this prion. Think, like, a malignant tumor: it started as a perfectly organic cell (compound) that ""went rogue"" and now can't stop perpetuating itself. This is **by far** the most common type of CJD, and as best I can tell it fits with the profile of what he had. Symptoms onset around age 60.

Variant CJD is probably what you're thinking of. This is where the person acquires that prion through consuming tainted meat (i.e. BSE aka ""mad cow"") or through a transfusion. This is, as best I can tell, very rare but still does occur.

Inherented CJD is exactly what it sounds like. Most similar to Sporadic CJD, but it's ""hard-wired"" in the person's DNA.

Then there's Iatrogenic CJD. This is where the person acquires the prion through surgery or another medical procedure (e.g. a tainted scalpel used in brain surgery). This one is particularly unnerving because typical sterilization techniques don't affect the prion at all.

&gt;In seven cases (as of 15.03.2021), **a special form of severe cerebral venous thrombosis associated with a lack of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia) and bleeding** has been diagnosed in connection with vaccination with the AstraZeneca COVID 19 vaccine \[...\]  
The number of these cases after the AstraZeneca COVID 19 vaccination is **statistically significantly higher than the number of cerebral venous thromboses  that  normally occur in the non-vaccine population**. For this   purpose, an observed-versus-expected analysis was performed, in which the number of cases expected without vaccination in a time window of 14 days was compared with the number of cases reported after about 1.6 Million AstraZeneca vaccinations in Germany. **About one case would have been expected, seven cases had been reported. \[...\]**  
All  experts were unanimous in their opinion that a pattern could be  identified here and that a connection with the AstraZeneca vaccination  was not implausible.

In addition, Merck, the original patent holder of ivermectin, has released the [following statement](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/):

&gt; Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today affirmed its position regarding use of ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

&gt; * No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

&gt; * No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;

&gt; * A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.

&gt; We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.

The rollout has been abysmal because a certain manufacturer has been delivering a fraction of what they promised.

The UK can vaccinate quickly on just AZ. The EU is seven times bigger and needs multiple suppliers. The only 3 vaccines available in Q1 are Pfizer, Moderna and AZ, where Moderna is the same technology as Pfizer.

Logically, that means the EU was always going to end up relying on AZ to some degree.

AZ has taken that trust and pissed on it. They flagrantly broke all of their promises. I don't think ""best effort"" would hold up in court when they basically lied about their UK plants being available and haven't even bothered to submit their Dutch plant for approval.

Because of that, the EU vaccination effort can only proceed at half speed until J&amp;J comes online.

This of course is fodder for the brexit camp, forgetting that their vaunted British vaccine is the reason why the EU is behind in the first place.

&gt; I think they would ""shoot themselves in the foot"" over this 

It's not shooting yourself in the foot when you are getting no vaccines to begin with.

If there is any political influence, I imagine it is less along the lines of inventing issues where there are none, and more along the lines of being less lenient with AZ than with Pfizer because AZ is a write-off anyway.

The Q2 cuts mean most countries simply scrapped AZ from their vaccination schedules and any vaccines that fall off the truck on their way out of Europe are considered a bonus rather than anything you can rely on.

This means there isn't much downside to investigating a potential issue.",,,1615851165,{},gr2exu7,False,t3_m5m3d8,False,True,t1_gr11jzh,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m5m3d8/germany_suspends_astrazeneca_vaccine_over/gr2exu7/,1615857184,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

It's about 3-4 months in between each of our peaks; roughly 2 months down from one peak, then building a new one in about 6-8 weeks from the bottom.  We're currently only at roughly that 2 month mark down from the peak, and at least so far, the pattern appears to be holding - we're bottoming out and levelling off at roughly the expected time.

This is from the link on that site about the second paragraph that mentions the fda. Microwave Oven Safety Standard
Through its Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), the FDA sets and enforces standards of performance for electronic products to assure that radiation emissions do not pose a hazard to public health.

A Federal standard (21 CFR 1030.10) limits the amount of microwaves that can leak from an oven throughout its lifetime to 5 milliwatts (mW) of microwave radiation per square centimeter at approximately 2 inches from the oven surface. This limit is far below the level known to harm people. Microwave energy also decreases dramatically as you move away from the source of radiation. A measurement made 20 inches from an oven would be approximately 1/100th of the value measured at 2 inches from the oven.

The standard also requires all ovens to have two independent interlock systems that stop the production of microwaves the moment the latch is released or the door is opened. In addition, a monitoring system stops oven operation in case one or both of the interlock systems fail.

All ovens must have a label stating that they meet the safety standard. In addition, the FDA requires that all ovens have a label explaining precautions for use. This requirement may be dropped if the manufacturer has proven that the oven will not exceed the allowable leakage limit even if used under the conditions cautioned against on the label.

To make sure the standard is met, FDA tests microwave ovens in its own laboratory. The FDA also evaluates manufacturers' radiation testing and quality control programs at their factories.",,,1615855595,{},gr2m6hl,False,t3_m5vb8q,False,False,t1_gr2jskb,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m5vb8q/mrna_vaccines_spur_lymph_nodes_for_longerterm/gr2m6hl/,1615860602,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

You're right about that as a limitation but your assumption that we've since somehow skyrocketed ourselves to *1 in 3 people having been infected by SARS-CoV-2 or a related variant* requires a mountain of evidence to show. That number is far too high and I've seen people repeatedly do this for a year now where they pull numbers out of nowhere without considering how difficult it is to sample an entire population accurately for something like this. If ~100,000,000 people had actually been infected in the US you'd see something like 1,000,000 dead. Unless you believe that we've undercouted almost 500,000 deaths caused by COVID-19. Think of it in this way: there are countries throughout the world where we can be reasonably confident that they've detected almost every actual case. Not 100% but close. In other words the number of confirmed cases approaches that of the total actual number which is hard to estimate. For example the total number of deaths in New Zealand has consistently matched that of a 1% IFR (incidence fatality rate). That could vary from region to region but it at least sets a value that provides some check of the serology data. So with a rough estimate of 500,000 to 600,000 deceased in the US you're looking at somewhere between 50-60 million total cases. That's plausible. 100 million or more?

But recently Marta Green, an official with the entity tapped to oversee the state’s third-party vaccine distribution administrator said, **“It’s really challenging. When we look at the concrete information we have…that 3-week projection from the CDC, I hate to tell you this, it is entirely flat. There is not a single [additional] dose. Not one.”**

It was a startling admission made during a live video presentation — archived here — from a little-known state entity called the Community Vaccine Advisory Committee. Green works for California Government Operations Agency, which is a state entity overseeing the Blue Shield roll out. Her assessment conforms with those from many sources around the state that there would be no great new wave of vaccinations in the near future.

Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said today that the county received its largest vaccine allocation to date last week, administering 312,000 doses. It expects to administer only about 260k doses this week due to supply issues. That, just as millions more residents are eligible.

**Ferrer explained the drop is because the county will not be receiving any of the new single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine for the next two weeks, due to a “manufacturing and production issue.” Reuters reported that production would only resume “later in March.”**

“Essentially, Johnson &amp; Johnson gave out everything they had right away and now we’re going to be waiting a little bit until they have more to distribute,” said Ferrer. The logic of shipping every bit of the single-shot vaccine is sound: Get more people vaccinated sooner. And to be fair, the lack of J&amp;J vaccine in the coming weeks is a nationwide issue not unique to California, with Reuters reporting that no doses of the one-shot treatment will be shipped nationwide next week. But the timing of the shortage is maddening for some Californians.",,,1615859185,{},gr2t1te,True,t3_m5wqxx,False,False,t1_gr2ss5s,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m5wqxx/california_expands_vaccine_eligibility_to/gr2t1te/,1615863797,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

I’m on a trial that started in October and I still have to report any illness via an app (even headaches or runny nose) and go to the hospital for checks every few weeks.

They are rigorously investigating this stuff, have been for months, still are now. Tens of millions of people have had each of these vaccine by now, some of these people die in the same way if you take any random sample of tens of millions of (largely older) people and track them over time. The number of people suffering from blood clots in the uk who have had the AZ vaccine is actually lower than the background rate at the moment, but the numbers we’re talking about are so low it isn’t statistically significant. It seems very much like something similar is happening in the EU; the number of people with clots is above the background level, but again we’re talking 10s of people with side effects out of 10s of millions vaccinated. It’s likely to be statistically insignificant, and even if not then it’s likely to be at a similar level of risk as the rare side effects you see listed on almost all medications.

I don’t really understand why those countries are doing it, the WHO is recommending to continue vaccinating, the EU regulators haven’t suspended the rollout, but a few countries are based off seemingly 1 incomplete study and some anecdotal evidence. In terms of harm reduction it’s absolutely the wrong decision, in terms of being honest with the public and not fearmongering it’s the wrong decision. Maybe it’s the right decision if you focus on this single study and ignore the meta analysis of all the studies, maybe it’s the right decision if your vaccine rollout has been completely mismanaged and you need a way to spin the news that you’re not going to be able to vaccinate your population any time soon.

Yes, it is. I'm talking about overall ratios, not the absolute numbers in the current time period, which might be a different period in each country.

&gt;The core issue is that MOST hospitals in Brazils are at capacity or close to capacity with an actual increase in numbers with record numbers happening right now. 

If that were the case, the current numbers would be pulling the average up, yet it's keeping up with the past average.

On the other hand, people don't think in statistics and people will always put their lives before the lives of others. If there's a chance that you get serious health problems (or even die) and those health problems are linked to the vaccine, I understand that people who are healthy are reluctant to get vaccinated at the moment.

Let's take the following situation: you're a young, healthy person following all the guidelines/precautions not to get COVID (social distancing, wearing masks, testing ...). First, you'd need to contract the virus, which is already not that likely if you're careful and then you'd also need to develop serious symptoms, which afaik is rather unlikely with younger people. There is a high probability that as a young, healthy person you can avoid getting COVID and dying of it.

On the other hand, if a number of people suddenly die in various countries after getting vaccinated and there is any connection to the vaccine, it's understandable that people start doubting the vaccine. If there's a chance that your health is affected by the vaccine, as a healthy (young) adult, you're not going to think ""well, let's take the shot anyway because otherwise I might get COVID, I might develop serious symptoms and I might infect others."" 

As long as there's doubt and as long as these cases haven't been thoroughly analyzed to counteract these doubts, people won't get the AstraZeneca shot and rather wait for the moment when they can get a Pfizer or Moderna shot.

Your account also isn't even old enough to have been active at the first peak of the pandemic, when like I said the strategy got lots of critique from both foreign and domestic media. This, and the previously discussed agenda that you clearly have, makes me question your knowledge of the situation.

I never said Swedish press was well functioning. But it is among the most open and accepting in the world. Odds are it is more free than the one where you're from. As long as you're not racist or sexist you can pretty much write about anything, critique or not.

In addition, Merck, the original patent holder of ivermectin, has released the [following statement](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/):

&gt; Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today affirmed its position regarding use of ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

&gt; * No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

&gt; * No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;

&gt; * A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.

&gt; We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.

&gt; We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 samples collected from various regions of Slovakia between November and December 2020 that were presumed to contain the B.1.1.7 variant due to traveling history of the virus carriers or their contacts. Sequencing of these isolates revealed that although in some cases the samples were indeed confirmed as B.1.1.7, a substantial fraction of isolates contained another ΔH69/ΔV70 carrying mutant belonging to the lineage B.1.258, which has been circulating in Central Europe since August 2020, long before the import of B.1.1.7. 

&gt; We have described a B.1.258∆ variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that contains the S:N439K
mutation shown to enhance the binding affinity of the Spike protein to human ACE2 receptor
and facilitating escape from immune response, the S:∆H69/∆V70 mutation, which is known
to increase viral infectivity, as well as several other non-synonymous mutations in NSP9,
NSP12 and NSP13 likely affecting viral replication. RT-qPCR analysis on random samples
collected during a mass testing campaign indicate that B.1.258∆ samples carry higher viral
loads compared to other strains, similarly as in the case of the B.1.1.7 variant.

&gt; Interestingly, the B.1.258.17 sublineage of B.1.258∆ has accumulated a higher number of
mutations compared to other B.1.258∆ samples, including additional substitutions in the
Spike protein (L189F, V772I) and helicase NSP13 (P53L). It also has a substitution Q185H
in the second B cell epitope of ORF3a protein involved in apoptosis induction (Ren et al.
2020).

&gt; Our characterization of a novel B.1.258∆ variant that has emerged in several European
countries and appears to result in higher viral loads highlights the importance of vigilant
genomic surveillance methods in properly identifying and tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants that
display the potential to derail worldwide efforts to mitigate the pandemic.

That's right, anyone who criticises the European rollout must be a brexiteer...

You realise AZ didn't deliver its agreed doses to the UK on time either? The UK was meant to receive 20 million doses by the end of 2020. They failed to meet their target because they encountered unexpected problems with production, something they, the UK and EU all anticipated when they agreed that they would still make their best reasonable effort to get the doses, for which they aren't taking any profit, manufactured on time, but that if AZ failed the EU and UK wouldn't hold them responsible.

Nobody in their right mind would sign a contract they don't stand to make any profit on but which would still subject them to legal liability for not completing. It wasn't a gotcha, it was exactly what the EU (and UK) ordered.

&gt;In the real world and in civil courts, the letter of the contract is less important than the spirit of it. 

Holy shit no, this is a dangerous misconception to have. The courts will always side with the wording of a contract over anything else except in extreme ambiguity. Society would collapse if people could renegotiate contracts based on what they feel it should have said. The cardinal rule of contract law is that if you want something from the contract you must write it that way. 

If AZ had not had confidence that the contract would protect them, AZ would never have agreed to sign it and the EU would have to look elsewhere for vaccine doses. A company that has never made vaccines before, that can only hazard a guess at how quickly they could get production up and running, could never agree any other kind of contract.

Like it or not, this is what both the UK and EU agreed with AZ. That AZ would do their best effort to produce, at no profit, the vaccine for which Oxford university created for free and partnered with AZ to deliver. It's a truly great think AZ has done, they're true heroes of this pandemic.

&gt;And if AZ is ""the UK"" as you claim, then that means ""the UK"" is directly responsible for deliberately sabotaging the EU's vaccine effort. Which would be a hostile act and may even be an act of war. So better hope AZ is not actually ""the UK"", hm?

You sound like a brexiteer. Talking about war with the UK rather than accepting the EU messed this up. I just don't get it, why this is so hard for people to accept and why it makes them so furious? Nobody is saying the EU is bad, only that they fucked up this thing. Ursula Von Der Leyen on the other hand...

No, I didn't know what you meant. That much was obvious by how I initially responded. You didn't leave yourself much room with this statement:

&gt;The **only** sexual health related disqualifications are if you yourself have actually contracted an STD and then yes, there’s a deferral period for treatment.

That's pretty cut and dry and coming right off a ""This is unequivocally untrue"" makes it very hard to think you are trying to say anything other than ""Even straight people having sex with prostitutes won't DQ them unless they actually get an STD.""

&gt;now it seems like you just want to vilify me for accidentally using imprecise language.

Yeah, because imprecise language is exactly why we went down this rabbit hole of me thinking you thought prostitution wasn't a disqualifying condition.

English Translation: 

&gt; Paul Hunter from the Norwich School of Medicine at the University of East Anglia, for example, is not convinced by the PEI’s calculation. He cites at least two clinical – pre-pandemic – studies since 2012, one Australian and one Dutch, that indicate a higher incidence of the specific sinus vein thrombosis in the general population: The two to five cases per million population per year is an outdated figure, he said. “It underestimates the incidence by a factor of four to eight.” The Australian study assumes 15.7 cases per million and year, the Dutch study 13.2 cases per million inhabitants and year. And these studies also showed that the incidence was even higher in people under 50, he said. Hunter: “With that, we would expect one to two cases per month. So sinus vein thrombosis is likely to be at least more common in Europe than previously expected

these numbers cited from studies above were derived pre-pandemic.  Covid infection itself is strongly associated with various vascular disorders, and has been associated with SVT in the literature--  so the true background number now might be  expected to be higher, there was even one such case of  cerebral thrombosis observed in the J&amp;J  trials, from a sample of thousands vaccinated  (turned out to be unrelated)",,,1615915834,{},gr57kl4,False,t3_m6ccz1,False,True,t1_gr4vg07,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m6ccz1/pei_update_why_has_vaccination_with_astrazeneca/gr57kl4/,1615917775,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

For urban vs rural distribution, a major problem is that it's hard for people to reach rural vaccination sites because travel times are much longer and there are fewer transportation options. You see the same thing in New York, where vaccination sites located far away from NYC are easier to get appointments at, but they're soooo far apart. I'm hoping that we can fix that by moving beyond the centralized ""vaccination site"" model required right now due to logistics of mRNA vaccines to a distributed model where small amounts of J&amp;J are kept in stock at huge numbers of pharmacies and urgent cares and doctor offices so that rural folk have an easier time getting vaccines. Obviously that doesn't really speak much to how vaccines should be allocated in urban vs rural areas right now, but I would be surprised if states are just throwing doses at sites that aren't using them, so much as encouraging people to sign up for more appointments so they can then be induced to send more doses out to those sites in order to address urban-rural disparities.

I think it's best if officials are proactive and take steps like you're saying, setting realistic benchmarks that people can work towards and that are in line with how people actually behave.

I may be wrong (I haven't paid attention to AZ since it's not approved in the US), but I thought the issue with AZ is that they tested for infection (weekly tests) and not just symptoms.

The two added that to stay protected, people may need a third dose of the vaccine to bolster immunity and efficacy against emerging COVID variants.

In addition to regular yearly boosters, this vaccination cycle may become part of the new normal.

""We believe it's becoming increasingly likely that an annual re-vaccination is going to take place,"" said D'Amelio, noting that the company did not see the pandemic or the resulting vaccination drives as a ""onetime event.""

The company is planning to accelerate the number of vaccine doses it can deliver by the end of July by ramping up production and supply chain capabilities.

D'Amelio said Pfizer was initially supposed to deliver 100 million doses of the vaccine to the US government by the end of March. The company is now on track to deliver 120 million doses by the end of the month and 200 million doses by May.

Execs told the company's investors that people may also need a third dose of the COVID vaccine, as well as regular yearly boosters.

- Pfizer execs told investors there was a ""significant opportunity"" to hike the price of its vaccine.

- They said to cope with emerging COVID variants, people may need a third dose of the vaccine.

- Regular yearly ""booster jabs"" against COVID may also become routine.


Pfizer execs have informed the company's investors of a ""significant opportunity"" to hike the prices of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

Speaking at the virtual Barclays Global Healthcare Conference last week, two high-ranking Pfizer employees - CFO Frank D'Amelio and Chuck Triano, senior VP of investor relations - said there would be a chance for Pfizer to raise prices for the vaccine when COVID moves from a pandemic state to an endemic situation and the virus circulates continually in pockets around the globe.

""If you look at how current demand and current pricing is being driven, it's clearly not being driven by what I'll call normal market conditions or normal market forces... it's been driven by the pandemic state we've been in, and the needs of governments to secure doses from various vaccine suppliers,"" said D'Amelio.

He added that with the resumption of ""normal market conditions"" over time, there would then be a chance for the company to take advantage of opportunities from ""a demand...and pricing perspective.""",,,1615901339,{},gr4bzuq,True,t3_m691sx,False,True,t3_m691sx,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m691sx/pfizer_execs_say_theres_a_significant_opportunity/gr4bzuq/,1615901349,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

All this situation mentioned by you (courts dismissing measures, ordinary people completely lost in dozens of anti-epidemic systems \[red/yellow/green zones? how much space allowed this week in my shop? national lockdown or regional? Do I have to take a week off because my child has to stay in home this week, or not? will I be fined because I must repair my necessary car, thus leaving home?\] is because of eternal dumbness of politicians. Despite having all the necessary tools on their table, like calling out the emergency state, they decided to impose new, ever-changing restrictions by the press conferences which have zero value for a law order, or by government's ordinance which is faulty if not in line with the acts (faulty by definition without emergency state). It would be harder (i.e. there would be compensations necessary) but at least there would be any kind of order.

But I do not believe in this, everywhere now you'll find memes of a one-year jubilee of two-weeks lockdown, there were so many restrictions, so many changes that I am not sure if anyone knows what now is compulsory and what not. The ideal example would be a new year's eve. The opposite political parties are no way better; instead of pushing the order and sanity, they prefer to argue if abortion should be legal or not.

The result is like you can see - a complete mess.

I do not support ignoring the basic rules for avoidance of pandemic spread, but I understand people who are against a complete mess. 

Law order here seems to be dull and not having any matter. However, it needs to be preserved. One day a health minister's spokesperson (having no right to announce the new rules, by the way) issues the closure of public schools with a ""legal basis"" of a conference press. OK. But if making law basing on ""what Prime Minister will came up"" can conclude with much more dramatic consequences. Law is in general for an order, and also - to limit people's greed and demolition of society. No matter if this demolition is done by a politician who decides to ruin up lifes of barmans or a moron who walks around with covid symptoms ""because he does not believe in virus"".",,,1615900990,{},gr4bcab,False,t3_m5j1kz,False,True,t1_gr0anff,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m5j1kz/poland_over_10000_new_infections_on_sunday_almost/gr4bcab/,1615901002,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

AZ is acting in bad faith. In the real world and in civil courts, the letter of the contract is less important than the spirit of it.

[],,KinnerNevada,,,[],,,,text,t2_m76zflk,False,True,[],"Millions of people in dozens of countries have received the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine with few reports of ill effects, and its prior testing in tens of thousands of people found it to be safe.

But recently, blood clots and abnormal bleeding in a small number of vaccine recipients in European countries have cast doubt on its safety, although no causative link has been found between the patients’ conditions and the vaccine. The reports have prompted more than a dozen countries to either partly or fully suspend the vaccine’s use while the cases are investigated. Most of the nations said they were doing so as a precaution until leading health agencies could review the cases.

The AstraZeneca vaccine has not been authorized for use yet in the United States, although a review of its U.S. trial is expected soon.

What types of problems caused the countries to take precautionary steps?

The cascade of decisions to pause the use of AstraZeneca’s vaccine, mainly by European countries, followed reports of four serious cases in Norway, which were described among health workers under age 50 who received the vaccine. Most developed clots or bleeding abnormalities and had low platelet counts, health authorities there said. Two of them have died from brain hemorrhages, and the other two are hospitalized. The death of a 60-year-old woman in Denmark and of a 57-year-old man in Italy also fueled quick decisions, although none of the deaths have been fully investigated to determine whether there is any link to the shots they received.
What is a blood clot and what causes them generally?

A blood clot is a thickened, gelatinous blob of blood that can block circulation. Clots form in response to injuries and can also be caused by many illnesses, including cancer and genetic disorders, certain drugs and prolonged sitting or bed rest. Clots that form in the legs sometimes break off and travel to the lungs or brain, where they can be deadly.

Can the vaccine cause blood clots?

Vaccines have not been shown to cause blood clots, said Daniel Salmon, director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins University.

Blood clots are common in the general population, and health authorities suspect that the cases reported in vaccine recipients are most likely coincidental and not related to the vaccination.

“There are a lot of causes of blood clotting, a lot of predisposing factors, and a lot of people who are at increased risk — and these are often also the people who are being vaccinated right now,” said Mark Slifka, a vaccine researcher at Oregon Health and Science University.

From 300,000 to 600,000 people a year in the United States develop blood clots in their lungs or in veins in the legs or other parts of the body, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Editors’ Picks


Based on that data, about 1,000 to 2,000 blood clots occur in the U.S. population every day, according to Dr. Stephan Moll, a hematologist and professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina.

[],,_BarryObama,,,[],,,,text,t2_jue7ne6,False,False,[],"""Why has Europe done so poorly? There are three main reasons.

Too much bureaucracy

While the U.S. and other countries rushed to sign agreements with vaccine makers, the E.U. first tried to make sure all 27 of its member countries agreed on how to approach the negotiations. Europe chose “to prioritize process over speed and to put solidarity between E.U. countries ahead of giving individual governments more room to maneuver,” Jillian Deutsch and Sarah Wheaton write for Politico Europe.

The result was slower regulatory approval of the vaccines and delayed agreements to buy doses, forcing Europe to wait in line behind countries that moved faster.

Penny-wise and pound-foolish

Europe put a big emphasis on negotiating a low price for vaccine doses. Israeli officials, by contrast, were willing to pay a premium to receive doses quickly. Israel has paid around $25 per Pfizer dose, and the U.S. pays about $20 per dose. The E.U. pays from $15 to $19.

The discounted price became another reason that Europe had to wait in line behind other countries. Even in purely economic terms, the trade-off will probably be a bad one: Each $1 saved per vaccine dose might ultimately add up to $1 billion — a rounding error in a trading bloc with a nearly $20 trillion annual economic output. A single additional lockdown, like the one Italy announced this week, could wipe out any savings.

“The price difference is macroeconomically irrelevant,” Münchau writes. The E.U. “tried to lock in a perceived short-term price advantage at the expense of everything else.”

Vaccine skepticism

“Europe is the world’s epicenter of vaccine skepticism,” Deutsch and Wheaton of Politico Europe write. That skepticism predated Covid, and now its consequences are becoming clear.

In a survey published in the journal Nature Medicine, residents of 19 countries were asked if they would take a Covid vaccine that had been “proven safe and effective.” In China, 89 percent of people said yes. In the U.S., 75 percent did. The shares were lower across most of Europe: 68 percent in Germany, 65 percent in Sweden, 59 percent in France and 56 percent in Poland.

The skepticism helps explain Europe’s latest vaccination problem. About a dozen countries, including France and Germany, have suspended the use of one of the continent’s primary vaccines, from AstraZeneca, citing concerns about blood clots.""",,,1615905776,{},gr4l1bv,True,t3_m6ale7,False,False,t3_m6ale7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m6ale7/new_coronavirus_cases_are_declining_in_countries/gr4l1bv/,1615905980,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Here is the summary from more recent work,

&gt;Substantial immune memory is generated after COVID-19, involving all four major types of immune memory. About 95% of subjects retained immune memory at \~6 months after infection. Circulating antibody titers were not predictive of T cell memory. Thus, simple serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies do not reflect the richness and durability of immune memory to SARS-CoV-2. This work expands our understanding of immune memory in humans. These results have implications for protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and recurrent COVID-19.

&gt; Germany's health minister, Jens Spahn, said Monday that pausing the AstraZeneca rollout was a precautionary measure following advice from Germany's vaccine regulator, the Paul Ehrlich Institute. The institute advised the halt after seven cases of blood clotting were reported following the administration of 1.6 million doses in the country.

&gt; The number of incidents in Germany and across Europe was small and authorities were trying to establish whether they were related to the vaccine, Mr. Spahn said. Germany is looking to the EMA for advice, he said.

&gt; The blood clots reported in some people who received the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine are known generally as venous thromboembolic events, and are relatively common.

&gt; They involve the formation of a thickened clump of blood in a blood vessel, which can cause fatal blockages. Health officials in the U.S. have included thromboembolic events among various types of adverse events of special interest they are monitoring as Covid-19 vaccines get deployed widely.

&gt; In a large trial of Johnson &amp; Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine, which was authorized for use in the U.S. in late February, there were slightly more blood clots among vaccine recipients than among those who received a placebo. The Food and Drug Administration said it couldn't exclude the possibility that the vaccine contributed to the higher number, and plans to monitor for clots as the J&amp;J shot gets deployed in the larger population.

&gt; Venous thromboembolism also can occur in people with Covid-19. The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, whose members include medical professionals who treat blood clots, issued a statement Friday recommending that all eligible adults continue to get a Covid-19 vaccine because the small number of reported thrombotic events relative to the millions of vaccinations doesn't suggest a direct link.",,,1615907678,{},gr4p669,False,t3_m65inx,False,False,t1_gr4m361,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m65inx/suspension_of_astrazeneca_shots_is_political/gr4p669/,1615908141,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

How exactly am I supposed to take what ""this"" refers to if not my post?  Some statement I never made?

None of your post really had any relevancy to what I was saying because I was only disputing the above posters issue that having sex with prostitutes is ""better"" than having sex with men who have sex with other men.  Which is false.  Both make one inelgible.

But I will dispute this statement:

&gt;Nothing I said was wrong

It is incorrect to say:

&gt;There are no eligibility limitations for sexual contact in place for straight people at all.

Yes, there are. For one, you can't have sex with prostitutes.  You also can't be a prostitute.

It is also incorrect to say:

&gt;The only sexual health related disqualifications are if you yourself have actually contracted an STD and then yes, there’s a deferral period for treatment.

Similar story as above.  If you're having sex with a prostitute, you're ineligible regardless of whether or not you contracted an STD.

[],,sudospectral,,,[],,,,text,t2_56yv9n5n,False,True,[],"There's at least three different theories as to why this would happen:

1.  Persistence of the virus in a reservoir.  The vaccine promotes a very strong response to the spike protein and that immune response targets the 'stealth' virus and eliminates it.

2.  Persistence of viral debris in a reservoir.  Cells aren't pumping out virions, but pumping out various proteins which don't assemble into whole virions, but produce an inflammatory response.  This is basically the terminal phase of the disease dribbling on.  The vaccine training on the spike protein would eliminate the cells pumping out spike, but if cells are pumping out other proteins the vaccine might not clear those.  Maybe inactivated virus vaccines that include the whole genome would be better?
3. Autoimmune antibodies.  So there's no virus left but there's a broad immune response caused by the infection which has been left.  The introduction of vaccine causes a narrowing of the autoimmune response, increasing the response targeted more specifically at the virus proteins and decreasing the broad autoimmune response which is causing disease.

All three of those may be taking place and it is probably a multispectrum disorder.  The viral persistence / viral debris cases are less likely to be long-term on their own since it just isn't expected that this coronavirus will persist in the body like herpesviruses.  The vaccine treatment will also be more likely to help those cases though.

The most likely case of long COVID that resembles ME/CFS and may last years is going to be autoimmune, but that is going to be less likely to be fully resolved by vaccination.  This is likely to be happening given how long COVID seems to affect women more than men, and women have a higher susceptibility to autoimmune conditions.

And the idea that its only anxiety and that's the reason that the vaccine eliminates the symptoms is just straight up gaslighting.  This happened for Gulf War Syndrome.  Happened for 9/11 responders.  It happened from the medical community to ME/CFS sufferers.  People posting and upvoting that shit should be ashamed of what they're doing.

That's not how this works.

We *know* that vaccines can kill people. It happens occasionally, usually an allergic reaction. Most of the time we spot it before it gets bad, give them a hit of epinephrine (which disables allergic reactions), and call it a day. But bad things do happen. Or there are side effects, like the Pandemrix vaccine for H1N1 that caused narcolepsy in a small subset of patients. Simply put, when you're injecting something into an entire population, sometimes you hit on a bit of unexpected chemistry.

The question isn't ""will some people die"" but rather ""will a statistically significant number more people live"". If the vaccine has a mortality rate of 1 in 1,000,000 and protects you from a disease that kills 1 in 100, we distribute the vaccine and mourn the one person who dies knowing that 10,000 who didn't die was as good a trade as we could get. Death is inevitable on a population scale. It's unfortunate, but it's also reality.

So the question they have to ask in response to the AZ vaccine is twofold: ""did the vaccine cause the clots"", and if so ""will more people die from COVID while waiting for alternative vaccines than would die from the AZ vaccine"". Because if it's a choice between a hypothetical 2% chance of dying of COVID (depending on your risk factors) or a .002% chance of dying from a pulmonary embolism, that may be a fair trade.",,,1615920439,{},gr5hxpv,False,t3_m65bza,False,True,t1_gr4rj79,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m65bza/doctors_baffled_as_countries_suspend_use_of/gr5hxpv/,1615923180,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

With that said, I'm hoping they loosen some grip on the AZ supply (and note, Canada just wants the US to allow AZ to export from the plant that Canada has it in their contract to supply them with AZ vaccines, not to actually donate or loan supplies from them) when Pfizer and Moderna both show reliability in hitting their Q1 targets and J&amp;J production picks up.

&gt; Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today affirmed its position regarding use of ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic. Company scientists continue to carefully examine the findings of all available and emerging studies of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 for evidence of efficacy and safety. It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:

&gt; * No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;

&gt; * No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;

&gt; * A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.

&gt; We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.

Agreement with Germany only comes in **September 2021, by which time they already had a successful candidate** and were conducting late stage trials. No German money was spent on the actual development of this vaccine, that was all Pfizer money.

Any German money that BioNTech may have received for this vaccine went to ""market authorization"" (applying for a license) and for manufacturing facilities (which came online only back in February 2021). 
Source 1 (April 2020):

&gt;“We have already started working with Pfizer on our COVID-19 vaccine and are pleased to announce these further details of our ongoing collaboration, **which reflects both companies’ strong commitment to move quickly to bring a safe and efficacious vaccine to patients worldwide,” says Co-Founder and CEO of BioNTech, Ugur Sahin, M.D.**

&gt;Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer will pay BioNTech $185 million in upfront payments, including a cash payment of $72 million and an equity investment of $113 million. BioNTech is eligible to receive future milestone payments of up to $563 million for a potential total consideration of $748 million. Pfizer and BioNTech will share development costs equally. **Initially, Pfizer will fund 100 percent of the development costs, and BioNTech will repay Pfizer its 50 percent share of these costs during the commercialization of the vaccine.**

Source 2: September 2020

&gt;the funding is an important contribution to **accelerate the development and scaling-up of our COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing capacities in Germany.** It highlights the tremendous importance of our mission to efficiently find a lasting solution to control the pandemic,” said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech.

So German money was used for a factory in Marburg and not for developing a vaccine.

We have shortages of all three vaccines right now, so it's not like the vaccine you don't take won't end up in someone else's arm. There's nothing wrong with choosing one you prefer unless it means you will be waiting a long time for a different one. Assuming you live in the US:

Pfizer is a two-shot vaccine. It is nearly completely protective against all symptomatic COVID (95% efficacy). The second vaccine is intended to be taken three weeks after the first vaccine. You are considered by the CDC to be fully vaccinated two weeks after the second shot, which is five weeks after the first shot if you get it on time. There have been some reports of extremely rare allergic reactions, but overall is considered extremely safe. Side effects such as fever, arm pain, tiredness, and body aches generally clear within 48 hours.

Moderna is a two-shot vaccine. It is nearly completely protective against all symptomatic COVID (94% efficacy). The second vaccine is intended to be taken four weeks after the first vaccine. You are considered by the CDC to be fully vaccinated two weeks after the second shot, which is six weeks after the first shot if you get it on time. There have been some reports of extremely rare allergic reactions, but overall is considered extremely safe. Side effects such as fever, arm pain, tiredness, and body aches generally clear within 48 hours.

Johnson &amp; Johnson is a one-shot vaccine. It is fairly effective against symptomatic COVID (72% efficacy in the US), and is nearly completely protective against hospitalization and death. You are considered by the CDC to be fully vaccinated two weeks after the shot, although immunity continues growing for another two weeks, so you might want to continue being somewhat conservative with risks until 4 weeks out. Overall is considered extremely safe. Side effects such as fever, arm pain, tiredness, and body aches generally clear within 48 hours.

As I understand it phase III trials of a completely new vaccine usually has to run for minimum 6 months and until a statistical significant number of cases have tested positive.

Some of the bureaucracy was accelerated though. For example a vaccine I'm waiting for, for Crohn's disease took more than a year just to get approved for the first trial, sitting in a pile of applications somewhere. Same for the second trial which then got put on halt due to Covid.

Even if the vaccine does have a rare and dangerous side effect as reported, It’s the choice of a small amount of high profile deaths in a young and healthy population which are directly attributable to the vaccine vs a large amount of deaths in an older less healthy population which you can’t directly attribute to not being vaccinated.

So that's the real decision: Open now and kill X number more people (many of whom would take the vaccine if they could get it but waited their turn), or open in two months when the population will be as protected as it's realistically going to be.

48 million doses administered to date, 62 million distributed. If (and that's a big if) AZ delivers their remaining 15 million doses and we get 40 million more in total by the end of Q1, that's 50 million people vaccinated.

Add 100 million vaccinated with Pfizer, 17 million with Moderna (35M doses), 55 million J&amp;J (if they deliver), and 35 million with AZ (if they manage to deliver their 70M out of the 270 they will still owe to the EU if they manage to get 30M by end Q1) – that's 50+100+17+55+35 = 257 million.

Out of a total population of 445,8 million, out of which about 380 million are adults over the age of 18. If we assume that we need to vaccinate 70% of the adult population, that's 277 million. 

In other words, assuming that delivery = vaccination, early Q3 should be doable (with the EU trailing the US and the UK by about 2 months) - however, some people will not be fully vaccinated until late Q4 (12 weeks between AstraZeneca doses). New vaccines and approvals might speed up this process, but not by a lot.

This of course leaves 123 million adults and 65 million children unvaccinated – meaning that any vaccination campaign will extend well into Q3; however, if deliveries go well the EU should be able to achieve 70% by July. ;)",,,1615900296,{},gr4a3dm,False,t3_m65er2,False,True,t1_gr45cpu,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m65er2/commission_statement_on_biontechpfizer_topup_for/gr4a3dm/,1615900307,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,

Supporters of total lockdowns, in my opinion, miss this point. If one country makes a lockdown it does not matter when other ones won't do that. El Salvador closed its borders entirely when they had 0 confirmed cases, yet this did not stop bringing covid there. Sometimes just one super-spreader coming from the business trip abroad is sufficient, what happened during covid as well. Coming further with his logic, So I can see two options. 1 - wield 8 billions of people in houses for those four months, or 2 - let life go for its own, but prepare for the hygiene standards (i.e. disinfection put on public places, securing the supplies in hospitals etc). Everything between those two points is a half-measure.

It just feels like such wasted time, just playing video games, applying to jobs and maybe some outdoorsy stuff like hiking every now and then. It's a catch 22: without the pandemic I would have never been laid off, but because there is a pandemic, I can't use my free time however I please.

I get that this sounds a bit selfish for wanting to go out and do stuff when the world was burning down, but it's so incredibly frustrating feeling like Squidward in the meme while everyone is at their beach house, skiing or touring breweries across the country.

&gt;As the Federal Institute for Vaccines and Biomedical Medicinal Products, the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI) is a higher federal authority in the portfolio of the Federal Ministry of Health (BMG). The institute, located in Langen near Frankfurt am Main, researches and evaluates biomedical human drugs and immunological veterinary drugs and approves these drugs. It is responsible for the approval of clinical trials as well as pharmacovigilance (recording and evaluation of possible side effects).

I can only speak for what they found here in Norway, and that was some weird combinations of symptoms they haven't seen before. The common factor was that they had just taken the Astra Zeneca vaccine. So we are not talking about the ""statistically speaking 1 in N will experience these symptoms anyway""-argument, which is the first thing I also always ask myself. 

The professor and chief physician at Rikshospitalet Pål André Holme said he had never seen this particular combination of symptoms, and it happened to occur in three patients that just had received this vaccine. He said that it ""wasn't improbable"" that there was a connection to the vaccine here.

[https://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/i/wenlan/behandlende-lege-om-blodpropp-funn-ikke-sett-noe-i-denne-gaten-foer](https://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/i/wenlan/behandlende-lege-om-blodpropp-funn-ikke-sett-noe-i-denne-gaten-foer)

What they described actually did look like a side-effect, extremely rare, but still a side effect of the vaccine. Lots of pills too have very rare side effects that can be lethal, but we still use them because the expected positive effects justifies the tiny risk.

So of course they need to investigate it. If they didn't, they would be helping the anti-vaxxers. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I'm just going to label... 

You absolutely have no idea what you are talking about. Anti-vaxxers aren't a problem among politicians, doctors or other health officials in Norway. On the contrary they urges everyone to take vaccines. 

And this weird anti-British conspiracy theory is completely crazy. Norway isn't a member of the EU, Brexit isn't much in the news anymore, people here don't really give a shit about EU-British relationships. It is is seriously so completely off the mark, the suggestion is just so utterly bizarre. And Norway was among the first to pause the use of this vaccine, so our decision has nothing to do with what EU-leaders has done.

Susie Neilson | on March 15, 2021

Since California first rolled out its four-tier, color-coded coronavirus reopening system last August, the least restrictive level has been yellow, for “minimal” spread.

The system had no green tier — by design, officials said.


“We don’t believe that there’s a green light that says, ‘Go back to the way things were,’” Gov. Gavin Newsom said at a news conference announcing the system — which preceded a devastating winter surge that ended with more than 50,000 Californians dead.

But on Wednesday, with case and hospitalization rates plummeting statewide and thousands of vaccine doses administered daily, Newsom acknowledged the state had changed course.

“We are working, quite literally, on a green tier,” Newsom said during a visit to a Southern California vaccination site, “and have been now for a number of months, in anticipation of this bright light at the end of this tunnel.”

Newsom did not elaborate on what a green tier might look like or what its requirements would be, and when asked to elaborate, the California Department of Public Health referred back to his Wednesday comments.


But several experts told The Chronicle what they thought a green tier might look like, and when a region could enter it.

Some restrictions still likely
“I think the only definitive thing that can be said right now is that a green tier would be less restrictive than the yellow tier but still have some restrictions,” John Swartzberg, a professor emeritus and infectious disease specialist at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health, said in an email.

“The yellow tier includes most indoor business operations with modifications. Therefore, I imagine a green tier would allow for all business operations to open (this would include concerts, etc.) without modifications.”

Swartzberg said that much of the state could possibly enter into a green tier when Californians reach community or herd immunity — which could happen this summer.

Still, he said, Californians in green tier counties would likely have to wear masks and practice social distancing in public spaces.

And if the coronavirus pandemic ends, and California transitions from green to … no tier?

“While this sounds appealing, we should give careful consideration to learning from this pandemic and changing our long-term behavior,” Swartzberg said. “For example, we would be much better off in the future if [we] adopted the culture of wearing a mask if one has the least indication of a respiratory illness (this is common in Asia). Further, restructuring our society where we are not crushed together with other people should become the norm.”

‘It better be very safe’
Robert Siegel, a professor of virology and immunology at Stanford University, said he’d prefer an even stricter definition of green tier than Swartzberg’s “widespread immunity” metric — if only because of the positive connotations of the color green.

“Green means go,” Siegel said. “So it better be very safe.”

Siegel said that a green tier should exist as a goal, something for counties to work toward. And it should be implemented when case rates in a county reach zero — i.e., the county has no community spread.

At that point, the virus could still spread to Bay Area residents from other regions of California or from elsewhere in the U.S. But a region with zero community transmission could more effectively contact-trace new cases and use technology like wastewater monitoring to hunt down new cases in a targeted way.

“The risk won’t go to zero unless it’s zero in the world, but if green means go, it should mean we basically are controlling this,” Siegel said.

Under Siegel’s green tier, most pre-pandemic activities would resume, including massive group activities like concerts and football games.

“Until there’s eradication, there’s so much flow in and out of California, you’ll still need to wear masks and things like that in certain situations,” he said.

Still, Siegel believes a green tier county could operate close to what would have been considered “normal” in 2019 — right before he challenged the idea of normalcy altogether.

“Elsa has a line in ‘Frozen’ where she says, ‘The past is in the past,’” he said. “We never go backwards, we always go forwards. There’ll be a time where people will be able to have family gatherings and graduations and weddings, and that’s coming soon, but we’ll never go back to the way things were.”

“Each test detects one to three different parts of the virus,” Van Gucht explained, adding that different tests can detect different parts.

The relevant parts translated through DeepL: 

&gt;In seven cases (as of 15.03.2021), **a special form of severe cerebral venous thrombosis associated with a lack of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia) and bleeding** has been diagnosed in connection with vaccination with the AstraZeneca COVID 19 vaccine \[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;The number of these cases after the AstraZeneca COVID 19 vaccination is **statistically significantly higher than the number of cerebral venous thromboses that normally occur in the non-vaccine population**. For this purpose, an observed-versus-expected analysis was performed, in which the number of cases expected without vaccination in a time window of 14 days was compared with the number of cases reported after about 1.6 Million AstraZeneca vaccinations in Germany. **About one case would have been expected, seven cases had been reported.**

They also state that the patients (6 female, 1 male) are all between 20-50 and thus wouldn't be in the high risk group Covid. They also mention pulling in other specialists ("" thrombosis, haematology and an adenovirus specialist."") to look at the cases in detail who have concluded that there ""is a recognizable pattern and that a connection between the reported diseases mentioned above and the AstraZeneca vaccination is not implausible.""

What they're doing now is 1. figuring out whether there can be any connecting issues (medicine cross reactions, same charges, etc.) and then reevaluating the risk/reward. They bring up the comparison to contraceptive pills which have been going around in Germany and essentially state that for those medications, the risks are well documented and available to you in the package leaflet so you can make an informed decision.

Do we know how many AZ vaccinations have been given across the whole of  the European Union? If you add these on to the German numbers, it would seem that it may well be the case that the average is lower than I thought, since, presumably, the Euro wide figure for AZ vaccinations will be more than double that of Germany whilst the number of people with this disease elsewhere in the EU are less - about 5 I believe.

Not that it matters any more: the stories today about politicising the decision plus statements by the EMA that the benefits of the AZ vaccine far outweigh the risks make it clear that the danger is not so much from the vaccine itself as from the perception of the vaccine in Europe. This is a great pity for the EU - especially when Pfizer have started to rub their hands together at the thought of significantly increasing the price of their vaccine. But, from my (selfish) point of view, it looks like the AZ vaccine will continued to be used in the UK with little danger of the vaccination programme being halted. Meaning, with a bit of luck, we may be free of most restrictions by July.

There are no eligibility restrictions specifically targeting straight sex.

Prostitution is not a sexuality or a sexual orientation. Both gay and straight people engage in prostitution. Not sure why that has to be said. It does bring up an interesting point - what is the material difference between a prostitute and an exceptionally sexually active straight person? Is it just a numbers game at that point? How many people should straight people have sexual contact with before they’ve hit “prostitution levels” which would preclude them from donating blood? If the only difference between a straight person’s sexual activity and a prostitute’s sexual activity is that one accepted money, should the policy be changed to reflect that?

I’m not trying to pick a fight, and please do not dismiss this as something I “feel” is discriminatory. It’s beyond condescending. I’m trying to point out that a policy is harmful and needlessly targets a group of people in a way it does not do to others.

Thank you. I had read where they had announced that 

https://www.pei.de/EN/newsroom/hp-news/2021/210315-pei-informs-temporary-suspension-vaccination-astra-zeneca.html

But still as far as I know there is no clinical confirmation of this yet, although I'm sure they know more than they are letting on in the press release otherwise they maybe would not making such statements with such powerful words like ""striking accumulations"" of ""special forms "" of ""very rare""  -- it's said the EMA will provide more details later, so will will learn more then I guess.

&gt; There's a huge criticism in the media on PEI's decision here in Germany. But they are an independent institute that advises politicians. If they say this needs to be investigated before resuming vaccinating again, politicians have to listen. Opposite of that would have been a political decision even though it would have saved more lives.

Surprised, I expected there would be support for it. I thought the perception of the AZ vaccine was very low there. I'm Not in Germany but I agree with the decision. not the biggest fan of how this situation has been handled overall and the way it's covered on the news in some places in Europe. I think many are worried and concerned from some media running hourly stories about side effects and rare outcomes, but the alternative of doing nothing once the stories came out in other countries wouldn't help either so they were pretty stuck anyhow. 

 PEI are respectable organization with expertise, not a gaggle of morons, and it's prudent to investigate the situation.

It's a dynamic situation, depending on knowledge about the virus, the immune reaction, and on political influence from lobby groups or competitors, like Curevac delaying readout to get more cases with the new SA strain, or Biontech/Pfizer expanding their phase 3 trial late last year for US identity politics.

In any case, for each vaccine, many trials are running in parallel, and many are not really known to the public. I know that just recently new trials for low- and single-dose Biontech vaccine started, based on other largely unknown trials last year, where they found identical or maybe even better titers in the 10 µg low-dose group. They also recruit older or younger people, or people with HIV, under the original protocol, to extend approval or further their own R&amp;D.

Through the failure of governments and people, we have freaking SARS running wild and threatening that it's becoming endemic. It's not a situation where one can choose the 1:100000 safe and ""let's wait a bit longer"" approach, not even a fifteen year old has that low risk profile, by orders of magnitude. 

It has to go fast, and the main risk of vaccination is the interaction of the spike protein with the immune system. That is a risk nearly everyone living outside of Asia will have to face in the next few months, and repeatedly with all kinds of new strains.

That said... I don't think the average doctor is qualified to make a determination here. Like the rest of us, the average doctor does not have any more access to the data, or the specifics of these cases that are raising some eyebrows. 

I'm in big data analytics, and for years have been focused on the life sciences sector. My very first client engagement was to develop an iPad app to be used by pharma sales reps (you know, the cute 22 year old who brings you all the brochures and takes you for a fancy steak dinner?). The app analyzed a given target doctor's prescribing habits vs those of his colleagues, figuring out who they work with through a variety of means then providing the sales rep with a nice dashboard. This would then empower the rep to have conversations like ""hey, I see your colleague Dr. Gupta is prescribing xxx for condition yyy...have you seen the latest studies blah blah.""

Bottom line is, the AVERAGE doctor doesn't have the time nor the motivation to do first-hand research to to critically review studies. They get guidelines and summaries...often provided by the Pharma companies. Couple that with (at least in the USA) various ways the Pharma companies bribe doctors...such as free trips to seminars, dinners, etc, and basically the Pharma companies are able to push the medications they want to have prescribed...often over suitable generic alternatives. Interesting.

Any conclusions they come to may be slightly better informed than your average redditor... but in the absence of being able to analyze the data directly they have no grounds to make an informed decision.

But I would argue that the governments who outright stopped the AZ rollout have acted far too strongly, much too early. If they followed the science and said ‘We are immediately halting this batch and carrying out urgent investigation, but there is no evidence that the AZ vaccine is dangerous’ that would have let people know they take it seriously, but avoid spreading the false idea that the AZ vaccine caused these blood clots.


I believe the amount of people with blood clots after the vaccine is actually lower than you would get if you surveyed a random group of the same amount (17 million people). So what is the possible logic for saying there is a link? I’m genuinely baffled by the reaction, especially since these countries already have issues with misinformation and lack of trust in vaccines. But I understand what you’re saying - the governments are probably afraid the population will turn against them if they look like they are ignoring this.

These reports are mentioning usual blood clots but PEI (in Germany) is investigating the increased number of sinus vein thrombosis/ cerebral venous thrombosis + lack of platelet which is extremely rare, happen 3-4 times per million per year.

There was a case of Sinus vein thrombosis resulting in cerebral hemorrhage even in the J&amp;J US trial, (that's why the trial was paused in October) and that was in a sample size of thousands vaccinated. Ultimately It was ruled by FDA as not in connection with vaccine and related to the individuals pre-existing conditions

&gt; Even though normal blood clots are usual, these are not. And if 7 out of 1.6m people encounter these with 3 possible deaths, there are reasons to concern according to PEI. 

AFAIK there is no clinical confirmation yet this is even is SVT, could also be something else like ITP--  in a sample size this large, we would expect  even uncorrelated events and not vaccine related adverse events to pop up at this sort of frequency, we know that covid has been associated with thrombotic events (incidence rate has been suggested to be roughly 25% in hospitilazed patients) and low platelets were reported earlier by chinese researchers in clinical reports to be present in around 35% of covid patients, and been observed as delayed onset too 

Low platelets ( immune thrombocytopenia ) has popped up several times in connection with other covid vaccines too; for example here's an article last month which talks about 36 reported cases in the US and one death (out of 30 million vaccinations). This got no attention or furore at all, rightfully.

Milder cases, especially asymptomatic cases [are worse at spreading](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kcy2e0/weekly_question_thread_week_of_december_14/gg8tp7n/).

This [suggests](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/lfnipv/initial_real_world_evidence_for_lower_viral_load/) a great reduction in ability to spread the virus. [Maybe even with just one dose!](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2036242) You should [get both doses though.](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/m2mtnv/immune_response_to_sarscov2_variants_of_concern/)

Any answer you get that is either ""yes"" or ""no"" is wrong, for now. We have only ""maybe, probably not"", and it's going to be that way for a long time.

Challenge studies with monkeys and the results look [*really good.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03041-6) They show strong immunity, or [sterilizing immunity](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/la4fud/immunogenic_bnt162b_vaccines_protect_rhesus/) from multiple vaccine types.  We're still figuring out if and how much sterilizing immunity can be expected from the current vaccines, though it's starting to look really good.

Also, you'll notice that any reputable person talking about this subject always says ""may be able to spread"", or ""maybe"", or ""we don't know if"". And that's because there is a small chance that vaccinated people will be able to spread the virus. But it's not a big chance. Doctors, scientists, and regulators are being very careful with their language on this subject, some would argue they're being too careful. That said, if they were to say that ""vaccinated people cannot spread the virus"", and then we find out that in some situations that vaccinated people have spread the virus, [that would end up worse for them than if they hedge for a while.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/los8r9/daily_discussion_thread_february_21_2021/goa8cu0/) So at least to me, the way they're framing it seems pretty reasonable, you just have to put yourself in their shoes.

That said, they seem to be [saying what I've been saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2On6TTGdixc#t=7m59s). 

**Additional Thoughts/Cool Stuff**

Testing and the Positivity Rate: It's been said a lot in other subs that the positivity rate should go up over time as more people are vaccinated and don't require testing. Last year, it was *the* metric to watch, but it will likely wane quickly in importance as overall testing drops.  Don't necessarily worry about sudden high positivity rates, as mass testing will likely drop off pretty quickly, particularly as testing sites are converted to vaccination sites. 

We may want to use our newly found testing and sequencing capacity to test and sequence a higher proportion of flu samples.  This might give us a head start on which flu genetics are circulating, and help eliminate a flu or two.  We're in the single digits of flu cases most places, which is awesome!

**Which vaccine should I get?**

When someone asks me what my favorite beer is, the answer is always the same.

It's the one in front of me.

So get the first vaccine you can, the differences are pretty minor.


[**Conclusions**](https://gfycat.com/cleantalkativedassie)

Okay, so the vaccines reduce infections, and if someone gets an infection after getting vaccinated, they have fewer and reduced symptoms.  This currently seems to also be true with post vaccination infection with any of the known variants. We are pretty sure this reduction is an indication that they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure that they reduce spread because people who are truly asymptomatic barely spread the virus, and people with mild symptoms spread only slightly more, and people who go on to develop severe symptoms spread the virus really well. 

In other words: A reduction in symptoms is at least correlated with a reduction in the ability to spread the virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections and symptoms in those who do get infected. Therefore, vaccines should reduce spread.

Regarding side effects of the vaccine:

Nobody is saying there aren't side effects. There are clearly side effects. I'm not even saying there aren't side effects from the vaccine that could last for years.

I'm saying that we'd find out about all the side effects within a few months. There won't be side effects that suddenly show up six months after vaccination that haven't already shown up in some people.

If you have an example of a side effect from any vaccine where side effects not seen within the first four months were suddenly found over four months post-vaccination, I'd change the wording in my post.

I'll tell you though, I've still not gotten an example of a vaccine side effect that didn't show up in at least some people until way after the vaccine was administered.

Also because it only requires one shot you need to be at a vaccination clinic 50% less of the time, and the protection starts (suspected) 2x as fast as the other vaccines do as it doesn't require that other shot.  We are also in the most dangerous time in the pandemic (post vaccine release) so having protection faster is also going to make up a bigger difference that way (as you are more likely to come into contact with more covid carriers, if more people have covid)

LTDR: The best option for a COVID vaccine is whatever vaccine you can get first.  Getting it faster is going to massively outweigh the slight differences between the vaccines.

Keep in mind you can get another vaccine in the future if it turns out we are going to be dealing with COVID for a long-ass time.

The vaccine was developed with Pfizer money, not German tax money. And it was a joint venture between Pfizer and BioNTech. Please stop posting falsehoods. 

**Back in April 2020**, Pfizer and BioNTech announced their partnership for which Pfizer paid 100% of the development costs. Agreement with Germany only comes in **September 2021, by which time they already had a successful candidate** and were conducting late stage trials. No German money was spent on the actual development of this vaccine, that was all Pfizer money.

Any German money that BioNTech may have received for this vaccine went to ""market authorization"" (applying for a license) and for manufacturing facilities (which came online only back in February 2021). 
Source 1 (April 2020):

&gt;“We have already started working with Pfizer on our COVID-19 vaccine and are pleased to announce these further details of our ongoing collaboration, **which reflects both companies’ strong commitment to move quickly to bring a safe and efficacious vaccine to patients worldwide,” says Co-Founder and CEO of BioNTech, Ugur Sahin, M.D.**

&gt;Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer will pay BioNTech $185 million in upfront payments, including a cash payment of $72 million and an equity investment of $113 million. BioNTech is eligible to receive future milestone payments of up to $563 million for a potential total consideration of $748 million. Pfizer and BioNTech will share development costs equally. **Initially, Pfizer will fund 100 percent of the development costs, and BioNTech will repay Pfizer its 50 percent share of these costs during the commercialization of the vaccine.**

Source 2: September 2020

&gt;the funding is an important contribution to **accelerate the development and scaling-up of our COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing capacities in Germany.** It highlights the tremendous importance of our mission to efficiently find a lasting solution to control the pandemic,” said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech.

So German money was used for a factory in Marburg and not for developing a vaccine.

[How VAERS is Used](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html)

VAERS is used to detect possible safety problems – called “signals” – that may be related to vaccination. If a vaccine safety signal is identified through VAERS, scientists may conduct further studies to find out if the signal represents an actual risk.  
The main goals of VAERS are to:

* Detect new, unusual, or rare adverse events that happen after vaccination
* Monitor increases in known side effects, like arm soreness where a shot was given
* Identify potential patient risk factors for particular types of health problems related to vaccines
* Assess the safety of newly licensed vaccines
* Watch for unexpected or unusual patterns in adverse event reports
* Serve as a monitoring system in public health emergencies",,,1615914630,{},gr54ts7,False,t3_m2ob6x,False,True,t1_gr51x4r,/r/Coronavirus/comments/m2ob6x/six_european_countries_suspend_use_of_astrazeneca/gr54ts7/,1615916352,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,
