These comments show that this is one area he has no fucking clue what he's talking about, and he should stick to virology.

Social distancing is NOT POSSIBLE in a school. I don't give even a half of a shit what your theories or hopes are, the kids can't, won't, and shouldn't even be asked to social distance in a school. Anyone who thinks reducing a class of 25 to 12 students is a solution to this problem is completely ignorant of what actually happens in a classroom, and the effect that would have on teachers and their ability to teach. Are we just trying to get the kids out of the house, or do we actually want them to learn? Because the second thing isn't happening in that scenario. We can keep to a curriculum remotely, but in this disastrous, convoluted logitisical nightmare of a scenario, curriculum goes out the window because you can't spend 5x the amount of time and stay on pace. For the uninformed: 5x comes from the absurd idea of splitting classes in half, which would mean that most teachers who have 5 classes a day would would have to teach each of the 5 classes twice. It's not simply 2x just because the class numbers would be cut in half.

If it kills at .26%, the lowest estimate I've seen from the CDC, and it infects 70% of Americans as models indicated it would based on known infectious index, that's  600,000 deaths. Immunity only lasts for 6 months and perhaps not even that so if the pandemic lasts for 1 year, January 2020 to January 2021 like Dr. Fauci is saying optimistically might happen, then we might easily see 1 million deaths. Right now we've seen 110-170,000 deaths and we're getting an extra 1000 deaths/day, so we'll see an additional 2-250,000 deaths. So we're looking at a total of about 400,000 deaths unless we get a second wave. 

This is assuming that the Stanford antibody results. from some very small groups are predictively reliable, and it's only .26% not 6% like the testing numbers indicate now. This would mean that tens of millions of Americans have had COVID-19 and didn't know they did, and that tens or hundreds of millions of humans have had it without knowing it. That's alot to hope for. Either way the CDC response hasn't really been a failure; we got hit hard in 2020 with this new virus and hundreds of thousands if not hundreds of millions of people's lives were saved.

I didn't say who cares, I said you* should care and deal with the issue to stop the protesting - And as much as I wish this wasn't the case, in other instances in your countries history when this exact issue has been brought up and protests occur, the president comes out and gives some limp statement regarding how it'll be different now and how it will change, which quells outrage and stops protesting. Obviously nothing changes, and those with a memory will know that, but it still works.  Trump could have done the same, now I don't think in the slightest this would have made a difference as Trump is the first president to encounter this issue with a well connect populous and networking solutions that allow for a transfer of evidence of these continuing police crimes.  Obama was president during the last memorable set of internationally covered protests, who as a black man has almost certainly encountered these issues during his own life, probably was believed when he gave the claim that things would change.  But, like I said, Trump being an exceptionally privileged white man is unlikely to be believed, but he could have at least tried.  Not everything can be dominated, especially the belief that you should be able walk home from the shops without being blinded by a police officer firing a stun bullet at your head, trampled by a horse, tased for driving home, tear gassed for using your First Amendment right to peacefully gather and of course being strangled to death by a police officers knee due to an unproven accusation that you attempted to spend a forged $20 note? 

You're currency is laughably counter-fitted** party due to it being useful in a large amount of the world, but also because certainly older, but still circulated, currency is woefully easy to copy.  So yea, if the US treasury says 1/4-10k notes in circulation are counterfeit, you may be given one at some point, not notice and slip it in your wallet.  HE DIED FOR THIS - I'm not saying he didn't grab a packet of green crayons and a bog roll and make them himself, but as he didn't have a chance to stand trial before being murdered, I will assume him innocent

""Rioters don’t have the right to destroy things that don’t belong to them"" - nor do police, but as they have spent the last week showing, they don't really care about what they should or shouldn't be doing.  It's almost like accountability is the reason for the protesting or something... hmm... 

""You haven’t seen it or dealt with watching people be put on ventilators"" - Incredibly assumptive.  Correct, but assumptive.  But largely speaking, my personal view is generally nihilistic.  It's entirely irrelevant if people die, we all will anyway so a few weeks of coughing/temperature etc to me is better than a lifetime's persecution and assumed villainization due to the colour of your skin.  However, I  also love the mental gymnastics of creating and argument and then debating it, and this one's an easy one given the completely obvious reason for the protest, worryingly dangerous responses of those who to an extent were voted in to protect people, and then the continuation of police doing the act for which people are protesting.  Combined with the lack of compassion for people I have never been in contact with (COVID patients, or potential future patients), whereas even at an incredibly basic level I have watched and therefore have interacted with people who are getting shot in the face by tear gas canisters.  

In addition, it's amazing how many American's now seem to care about the health of others when there could be an issue that affects them.  Most countries think they should protect the health of citizens all the time, not just during pandemics.  But then again social health systems are expensive, I mean the NHS*** costs the UK $3,377 per person, whereas the US has it super cheap at only $9,403 per person... waiiiiit a second, you could save money AND provide health care to all?   Yes, maybe give it a go after this.  

""They don’t have the right to harm the police or other innocent people or kill them"" - From what I've seen from live feeds and videos there has been at least 1 instance (I'm kidding, it seems to have happened in virtually every video I've seen so far) of the police attacking peaceful protesters - or in other words instigating the proceeding violence. In which case ""When a person has reasonable grounds for believing, and does in fact actually believe, that danger of his being killed, or of receiving great bodily harm, is imminent, he may act on such appearances and defend himself"".***  

""They don’t have a right to burn down a building while a kid is inside and make it hard for the fire department to get to the building to save the child.""  Yes this accusation is abhorrent, but I haven't seen any convictions or evidence regarding this yet, other than the Chief accusing it. But again this goes back to the issue, every protester has now been painted with this brush despite no one being convicted of anything and they are now vilified.  The Police murder someone/attack people etc ON CAMERA and nothing happens until people start protesting - Almost as if it's effectively enacting change. 

""Yet out destroying people’s lives and killing some people."" - again abhorrent and almost as if they should be criminally charged before being chastised for it.   But still, characterisation through profiling (must be doing x because 1 did the thing) is again a reason for the protest.  So unless you have evidence that all protesters are doing these acts, its unfair and exceptionally prejudice to accuse them all, which you did 8 times in your one post.  Which I should point out, makes you one of the people who protesters are protesting and as you are clearly annoyed at them, good, it shows the protests are working. 

*as a country, but more specifically the majority of your government as Trump never shown a jot of morality so I seriously doubt he cares about anything at all.  Possibly even as far as to say I'm not sure he has the capacity to care full stop

For you maybe, but calling people ""Chicken Little"" for being proactive and precautionary is insulting and diminishes the important work we are doing here in /r/Coronavirus.
HIV has killed 32 million people since it's discovery in 1981.  That's roughly 750k per year averaged out.

I'm glad you have found the information interesting! 

Yes, that video was very well done, glad you liked it! For me, it pulled together a lot of things I'd heard here and there into one coherent narrative. In Europe most everyone thinks of Sweden as this shining Utopia, better ethically than even its Nordic neighbors. I used to somewhat uncritically buy into that image (they actually have a word for it: Sverigebilden or image of Sweden). But yeah, this situation ripped those blinders off my face something harsh. Seriously, if you were to go back to January and tell me that Sweden has the highest death toll in the Nordics and has had the highest death rate per capita in the world I just would not have believed you since I bought into the Sverigebilden quite far before this. 

And yep: there is a [""mass psychosis""](https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/forskargral-om-sveriges-coronastrategi-en-masspsykos) going on in Sweden right now, as one expert put it. But you put it better: it is mass self-delusion and denial. Which is yet another aspect that fascinates me since I've intensively studied delusion and denial as they relate to climate change for many years now.
If that's not something you've looked into, I highly recommend this interview with Dr. Ajit Varki: https://www.ecoshock.org/2017/01/climate-denial-is-human.html tbh it's better than his book which even he admits needed more editing. I think his basic premise is sound, though: that denial is integral to  human consciousness. So seeing it erupt in Sweden re: this issue has just been so fascinating and so horrifying since I bought into the Sverigebilden that they were oh so rational and science based. 

And yeah, I've been thinking of Sweden as ""the America of the Nordics"" since this situation got bad. They are small and relatively powerless economically and militarily, and thankfully that whatever power the Sverigebilden had didn't help them export this grotesque strategy, even though it did look for a while in some Nordics like they may have been leaning towards adopting it (Denmark wavered at one point, and Finland has been even closer). 

But now even that power is waning, as the rest of Europe and the world wakes up to how awful this situation has been. 

As, thankfully, do more and more Swedes! Like the guy in the video concludes 'Sweden is a good country that has made some mistakes' like any other country and it can turn this situation around! I just hope the waking up is swift, and the turnaround is dramatic. I think it is possible it may be (though most of my Nordic friends disagree so I am prepared to be very disappointed lol).

People are not going to travel to a dangerous place. So let's say even without a lockdown tourism in spain or italy would have suffered anyhow.
From this point of view (safety) it is much better to lockdown for 2 months and then reopen when the virus is circulating less and effective measures of containment are in place (masks, social distancing, testing, etc.).

Another problem is in times of crisis people are less willing to spend money. With or without a lockdown you are less likely to sell new cars for example. People will tend to keep their old cars if they are still running.

If the virus is circulating then you might go less to a pub or restaurant.

In general some shops might run at a reduced capacity because they have less customers. Factories might have huge stocks they cannot sell. Others might have issues importing goods because somebody else is in lockdown. And so on.

So in the end you will always have side effects.

Oh, you got a hero complex. That explains why you would want it to be “the biggest biological threat” of all time. Plus, exaggerating doesn’t help anyone.


&gt;HIV has killed 32 million people since it's discovery in 1981. That's roughly 750k per year averaged out.

Almost like averaging it out completely mitigates the severity of it. Even with some treatments, it was almost 2 million (if not more) in 2004 alone. Do that math, Einstein. I guess I would be stupid to believe that there’s been an effort to reduce that number by some time. 


&gt;Your post didn't actually provide any evidence to challenge my claim, just individual opinion.

TIL its my opinion that HIV, the plague and the spanish flu killed 32 million, 100m+ and roughly 20m respectively. I gotta say, I love how you didn’t even bother comparing the last two. It would be a lot harder to fudge those numbers, eh?

Yeah, everyone took extreme considerations for HIV back in the day. I’m glad people were more educated about these things back in medieval england and 1918. If your understanding of the science is anything like your understanding of statistics and history, you’re probably pretty ignorant.


&gt;Until you can bring evidence, sources, links-to-click-on into the conversation, your input won't be worth considering.

Okay, I’ll list a bunch of sources for you that make it obvious HIV is worse, of course you’re just going to ignore it because you would rather pretend to be Iron Man or some shit than think about things rationally.

&gt;While Moderna blitzed the media, it revealed very little information — and most of what it did disclose were words, not data. That’s important: If you ask scientists to read a journal article, they will scour data tables, not corporate statements. With science, numbers speak much louder than words.

&gt;Moderna's preliminary Phase 1 vaccine-trial release soon came under scrutiny from the medical community.
For one, clinical trials for vaccines typically happen in three phases for safety and efficacy; the process usually takes years. Moderna released partial results from the first phase, which began in mid-March.

&gt;During an early 4-week interval in the COVID-19 pandemic, ED visits were substantially lower than during the same 4-week period during the previous year; these decreases were especially pronounced for children and females and in the Northeast. In addition to diagnoses associated with lower respiratory disease, pneumonia, and difficulty breathing, the number and ratio of visits (early pandemic period versus comparison period) for cardiac arrest and ventricular fibrillation increased. The number of visits for conditions including nonspecific chest pain and acute myocardial infarction decreased, suggesting that some persons could be delaying care for conditions that might result in additional mortality if left untreated. Some declines were in categories including otitis media, superficial injuries, and sprains and strains that can often be managed through primary or urgent care. Future analyses will help clarify the proportion of the decline in ED visits that were not preventable or avoidable such as those for life-threatening conditions, those that were manageable through primary care, and those that represented actual reductions in injuries or illness attributable to changing activity patterns during the pandemic (such as lower risks for occupational and motor vehicle injuries or other infectious diseases).

Basically, much of the decrease may be attributable to fewer people presenting with conditions that don't really necessitate an ER visit (ear infections, cuts and scrapes, sprains and strains) combined with reduced exposure to risks because of changes in activity, or staying home in other words. A lot of this reduction is in ER visits that really don't need to happen outside of a pandemic environment either. A lot of more serious conditions saw little change. There are specific numbers in the [report](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6923e1.htm?s_cid=mm6923e1_w).

The decrease in nonspecific chest pain and acute myocardial infarction (heart attacks) is really the primary concern I can see identified. People with signs and symptoms of a heart problem should seek immediate medical attention.

There is also no mention of things like cancer or other diseases generally diagnosed outside of an ER, as this is focusing only on ER activity.",,1591302925,{},fswe24m,False,t3_gwmtt8,False,True,t3_gwmtt8,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gwmtt8/coronavirus_leaves_behind_42_percent_plunge_in/fswe24m/,1591309085,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

As I see it, this ia a horrible situation and the lag is however only the reports of confirmed cases that ended in death, all still from within the latest days so many deaths have  likely also been missed as seen in all other countries, so no matter how one chooses to view these data the sad fact is roughly 1000 people (mostly the elderly and frail) are actually very likely to be dying every day in this current week 
in Mexico from a single cause. 

People are dying fast enough that it's a continuous cycle of uncomfortably high numbers that lag and the people who die today will be counted by next week so there must be enough dead each day right now for the numbers to become so catastrophically high on a day to day reporting. So this means the lag will also be there tomorrow and next week and the next couple of months (hopefully not this bad) It won't stay like this forever but right now is super shitty and there's no way around it.

The official reporting from Mexican media outlets could be saying there is a lag and this might just be what you're referring to and nothing more, but as I see this it is just a governmental formality that as a result in some way or other obfuscates the delivery and perception of bad news to the regular people in a society which doesn't benefit from undue anxiety. 

Hope to hear from you as it could be an insightful view and I would love to know how you are dealing with this and it would help me and others understand internet societies a bit better, as I've observed a persistent pattern online of initial skepticism or dismissal with regards to bad news and difficult change and would like to understand these view as they are expressed, shared and up- /downvoted on a public yet anonymous forum

Now I see the pressure already building that everyone should have the flu shot this fall so that health care providers don't deal as much with the flu when they need to deal with the virus.  I had found justification for my belief that the flu shot has little to no effect on getting the flu, but I've also always wondered if it didn't do more harm than good.

Now I've come across an article which quotes Dr. Fauci as saying this:

 “I must warn that there is a possibility of negative consequences where certain vaccines can actually enhance the negative effect of the infection,” he told lawmakers. ""

1: They can destroy properties
2: Burn down buildings with children inside. 
3: Assault officers, business owners trying to protect their property and other civilians. 
4. They can kill officers on purpose. 
5. They can leave civilians laying their to die. 
6: They will block emergency personnel from getting to house fires to save people.

Look it up BAME communities are more likely to have adverse effects of coronavirus. Just look it up ffs.


I never said they don't have doctors or scientists. China has some very good doctors and scientists.  I said the common man there has little to no knowledge of Viruses etc, Boomers in China didn't grow up with lessons in biology class. Bacteria and virus spread are not as common knowledge. They typically use traditional medicines, teas, herbal remedies and more outragous treatments we wouldn't even entertain here. They don't typically consult doctors and infact many in China have distrust for medical workers. 

Again. I never said they didn't take plenty of action to cull the spread later. But there is no fucking way they have so few deaths when for near three months they did little to cull it. there were five million trips in and out of Wuhan by families during the holidays, There were huge public celebrations and family gatherings as late as the end of Jan before any lockdowns and after China started stripping the shelves in the west of all PPE. 

At least you're open to the possibility the CCP could have lied about their numbers. But seriously. There is no way in hell they're being honest. If they were about transparency they wouldn't have arrested and threatened the doctors who whistleblew",,1591253248,{},fsu310s,False,t3_gvruyf,False,True,t1_fstlzf7,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gvruyf/wuhan_doctor_whose_skin_turned_dark_from_virus/fsu310s/,1591256752,0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

We know that at the height of the local spread Minnesota, which is ground zero for the protests, got 1000 cases a day. This occured over a month after stay at home orders.

Since then it has trended downwards hard including in the 9 days since the protests started.

The virus has a median incubation period of 5-6 days [1]

Minnesota is having mass gatherings daily of about 60k just yesterday according to the governor.

Given this perfect storm, we should already be seeing an increase given the earlier fact about the incubation period. But let me give you more days for fairness sake. 

Given the amount of active cases being far higher than 1 month before the peak AND gatherings being extremely large, one would assume a peak would have to minimally reach 1k cases a day in Minnesota for your theory to prevail.

See Section on Incubation Period. I picked a government source from a trusted government so you can gladly not question it.

Back in March when things really ramped up, testing was still very poor. How do you catch asymptotic cases and the newly infected when you aren’t even testing the families of those you know are infected? The official guidance before lockdown was “stay home and isolate if you have symptoms”, when we *know* many cases are contagious before symptoms appear (if they do at all).

For the last week, testing has been good enough that nationwide they are testing around 20 people for every positive case they find... in my state it’s more like 50 tests per positive case. That means proactively testing health workers and high risk groups that have been exposed. That means testing a coworkers and friends and casual contacts from the last few days when someone shows up positive. 

My friend’s coworker woke up with mild symptoms in early May and was able to get a test result back within 8 hours which was a huge step up from March. But even then none of her coworkers could get tested despite having had very close contact with her (they were all fine fortunately)... Just a month later and now people in some states can get totally free testing for any reason, exactly what my friend would have done after being in close contact with someone who developed symptoms the next morning. My state now even has contact tracers who will go proactively interview positive cases and go back and warn people or businesses they were in contact with to get themselves tested.

This is how the successful Asian countries fought off the virus without lockdowns. We know it works and it just took far too long to get the infrastructure in place with poor leadership, contradictory guidance, public misinformation, and fragmented independent responses from all 50 states rather than a unified national response.",,1591256307,{},fsu6jea,False,t3_gw8a56,False,True,t1_fsto7o3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gw8a56/no_new_covid19_cases_from_lake_of_the_ozarks/fsu6jea/,1591258467,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

RCTs are the gold standard for all clinical trials. Phase III is high scrutiny. Your presumption that the random assignment phase is not cross-sectional is completely baseless. In scenarios where you believe you cannot achieve proper sample size, you stratify the sample set to ensure you represent all populations, and randomize from there. All this is in the FDA guidelines, but stratification is essentially statistics 101.

&gt; The appropriate dosage for monkeys, sure.

I said approximate and there are statistical models easily capable of estimating the dosage (which is why the levels have such great variance in animal trials, to find the lowest effective dose and the highest, sometimes LD, to make for a more accurate human projection). Additionally, many small mammal tests utilize transgenic mice to replicate certain disease pathways, however less relevant in infectious disease and more pertinent to congenital issues, which brings me to your next topic: rare disease.

&gt;  If you're developing a vaccine for a rare disease

These are known as “orphan” diseases and hardly anyone makes vaccines for these because case management and tracing is orders of magnitude more cost effective. In fact, an EU study found Only 14% of rare disease trials had more than 100 patients compared to 36% of the next tier or rarity. And this is not limited to rare vaccine trials which almost never happen. The prevalence of corona is huge. Your rare disease example is completely different statistically. In some areas antibody tests reveal a 20% SARS-CoV-2 infection rate. And trials for rare congenital diseases are YET another entire conversation. If you want to see what’s being done in the field of rare congenital diseases, I’d look into the drug Spinraza by Ionis to treat SMA. Ionis is the only major player attacking prevalence &lt; 1 / 10k and 100k congenital diseases.

&gt; All the same arguments you're making apply to other vaccines like HIV. 

No. Just no. HIV is unlike any other virus. HIV can make a protein called Nef, which helps the virus hide. Nef interferes with one important part of our defences which helps our immune system recognise infected cells by displaying pieces of the infecting virus or bacteria on the cell surface, forming a target for our bodies' killer cells. When HIV infects one of our cells, the protein Nef binds to this helper system and alters it in such a way that the cell believes it belongs in the cellular trash bin rather than on the surface where our main defences can see it. Corona is far-far easier to develop because our immune system recognizes the spike. We’ve even identified some prior SARS patients having immunity because of the similar protein spike.

""According to the findings of a case-control study published online in the ICMR's Indian Journal of Medical Research (IJMR) on Sunday, consumption of four or more maintenance doses was associated with a significant decline in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the study participants.

The study highlighted that health care workers (HCWs) performing endotracheal intubation had higher odds of being SARS-CoV-2 infected.

It was identified that simply initiating HCQ prophylaxis did not reduce the odds of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs. However, with the intake of four or more maintenance doses of HCQ, the protective effect started emerging, and in the adjusted multivariate model, a significant reduction (&gt;80%) in the odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the HCWs was identified with the intake of six or more doses of HCQ prophylaxis.

This dose-response relationship added strength to the study outcomes,"" the study stated.
It is worth mentioning in this context that the National Task Force for Covid-19 in India recommended a once-a-week maintenance dose for seven weeks (400 mg once weekly), following the loading dose (400 mg bd) for HCWs.

The three most common side effects of HCQ as reported by the cases and controls were nausea (8%), headache (5%) and diarrhoea (4%). While none of the controls on HCQ complained of palpitations, only one case reported the same.

Gastrointestinal symptoms such as acidity and vomiting following HCQ intake ranged from 0.6 per cent in cases to about two per cent in controls. Very few cases (0.6%) and controls (1.4%) had skin rashes after consuming the drug.

ICMR Dr Balram Bhargava had said that no major side-effects of the anti-malarial drug Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been found in studies in India and its use can be continued as prophylaxis for Covid-19 under strict medical supervision.""

[No improvement in death rate for COVID-19 patients who received hydroxychloroquine](https://neurosciencenews.com/hcq-coronavirus-death-16449/)

&gt;Source: Brigham and Women’s Hospital

&gt;Summary: Coronavirus patients treated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are significantly more likely to experience ventricular arrhythmias than those who were treated with other medications. **The study also revealed that out of 100,000 COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized, the 15,000 who received hydroxychloroquine were more likely to have worse health outcomes than those treated with other drugs.**

&gt;Conclusions

&gt;In this observational study involving patients with Covid-19 who had been admitted to the hospital, **hydroxychloroquine administration was not associated with either a greatly lowered or an increased risk of the composite end point of intubation or death.** Randomized, controlled trials of hydroxychloroquine in patients with Covid-19 are needed. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health.)

Source: FDA

&gt;The warning is related to the potential for the drugs to prolong the QT interval—a cardiogram measurement used to assess some of the electrical properties of the heart—and **cause abnormal heart rhythms**, particularly in patients with cardiac conditions. Those risks may increase when the drugs are combined with the antibiotic azithromycin, which can further increase the risk for sudden cardiac arrest.

Source: early results from a clinical trial in Brazil

Mind you, their crazy president is as misguided about this drug as Trump.

&gt;After 11 patients died across both dosage groups, the team halted the high-dose arm of the trial on day six, citing more heart rhythm problems in the high-dose group, and ""a trend toward higher lethality"".

I can only speak to my experience, but pretty much every dispatcher i know has some kind of pyschological trauma.   Its not just the fact that we rarely ever get closure,  its that the nature of the work is very socially isolating. We have the same scheduling issues of shift work that make having an outside life challenging that cops  firefighters and EMTs do, but we don't have nearly as much on-job downtime as they do to help build supportive relationships between coworkers.

Their treatment period of FIVE DAYS is likely to be too short for a prophylactic effect. In India, the risk of infection among healthcare workers taking HCQ was reduced after FIVE WEEKS.

""According to the findings of a case-control study published online in the ICMR's Indian Journal of Medical Research (IJMR) on Sunday, consumption of four or more maintenance doses was associated with a significant decline in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the study participants.

The study highlighted that health care workers (HCWs) performing endotracheal intubation had higher odds of being SARS-CoV-2 infected.

It was identified that simply initiating HCQ prophylaxis did not reduce the odds of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs. However, with the intake of four or more maintenance doses of HCQ, the protective effect started emerging, and in the adjusted multivariate model, a significant reduction (&gt;80%) in the odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the HCWs was identified with the intake of six or more doses of HCQ prophylaxis.

This dose-response relationship added strength to the study outcomes,"" the study stated.
It is worth mentioning in this context that the National Task Force for Covid-19 in India recommended a once-a-week maintenance dose for seven weeks (400 mg once weekly), following the loading dose (400 mg bd) for HCWs.

The three most common side effects of HCQ as reported by the cases and controls were nausea (8%), headache (5%) and diarrhoea (4%). While none of the controls on HCQ complained of palpitations, only one case reported the same.

Gastrointestinal symptoms such as acidity and vomiting following HCQ intake ranged from 0.6 per cent in cases to about two per cent in controls. Very few cases (0.6%) and controls (1.4%) had skin rashes after consuming the drug.

ICMR Dr Balram Bhargava had said that no major side-effects of the anti-malarial drug Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been found in studies in India and its use can be continued as prophylaxis for Covid-19 under strict medical supervision.""

Another study on HCQ for prophylaxis is underway in Australia. I'm not sure if the trials in the US were also prematurely halted due to the flawed study (Surgisphere's fake database analysis) which was published by the Lancet?

Japan erased covid19 without a lockdown at all.

All the data suggests that blacks and whites consume drugs at the same rate, but blacks are much more likely to actually get caught and actually get prosecuted for drug charges. And across the board, blacks receive higher sentences for the same crimes with the same priors as whites. Black neighborhoods are over policed, which is why we have so many interactions with cops. The more cops you put in an area, the more arrests you're gonna have. Then that cycle just perpetuates itself forever. We know most police departments were racist in the 1960s right? They hosed black protestors down with fire trucks and tear gassed them and let their canines loose on peaceful protestors routinely. Then throughout the 70s 80s 90s 00s and 10s they just kept adding more cops and keep making more arrests. But crime peaked in the early 90s and has been falling since. So there's no reason to continue to police neighborhoods the same way anymore (if ever). But they do because it keeps their budgets high. But it also endangers the public.

But you're probably right. They've been murdering black (and white) people in the streets forever and nothing has ever changed. Biden is at least paying lip service to the issue, which is exponentially better than trumps racist response.

As I responded to another comment, teachers were simply not equipped to do this right. Even someone like myself that has been using blended learning, flipped classroom models and various forms of electronic work for many years, stuff was absolutely different once it became the ONLY option, and I myself struggled trying to convert lesson plans, design curriculum and track students without ever seeing them in person. Even if the majority of teachers had been prepared for something like this, districts literally told teachers they were not allowed to give 0's for missing work, not allowed to give late penalties, 4th quarter grades don't count, pass/fail only, etc., because districts themselves had to come up with policies on the fly as well. I teach in a very well funded and functional district in MA and all of those things I just mentioned happened to me personally.

To your first point that kids aren't learning anything - that WILL change, because now teachers are going to be given the guidance, training, permission and literal equipment to do it the right way. 

And as far as the ""getting the kids out of the house"", I completely understand that nothing can even come close to feeling ""normal"" until parents can freely go back to work, which can't happen unless child care and schools are open. But you made a lot of the points I was going to make, and I'll remind anyone else reading this that every single year on like October 3, one kid comes in with a sniffle, and then over the next 2-3 weeks students and teachers start calling out sick because no matter how clean you keep the school, germs, bodily fluids and general sicknesses can not be stopped from spreading among school-aged kids. I don't want to hear any shit about masks, younger kids won't wear them, and older kids will constantly be taking them off for ""reasons"" (""I was *just* kissing my gf"", ""I was *just* hitting this vape”), and I would like to remind everyone how well kids ages 4-18 follow rules in general. 

I don't know what the solution is, and there are a lot of things that can happen in the next few months, but getting kids out of the house and getting them learning in a useful way again are unfortunately two separate issues right now. What I do know is that the amount of time districts will have to spend to come up with extremely complex schedules (seriously, if you've never seen a master schedule for a school, please look one up), it to essentially expose students and staff to a spike in coronavirus spread, is not worth any possible positives that could come from it. Until we have some semblance of scientific data from guys like Fauci that it's safe for humans to occupy the same enclosed space without social distancing and masks, it's not safe to go back. And he really shouldn't speculate when he very obviously doesn't know what he's talking about in terms of how schools run. I'll listen to his advice on virus spread but he should refrain from making suggestions about how to run schools and just give the virus advice.",,1591270935,{},fsummy3,False,t3_gw9wja,False,True,t1_fsufdgq,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gw9wja/fauci_weighs_the_pros_and_cons_of_reopening/fsummy3/,1591270935,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

The news pushed up the company's stock price 30% to an all-time high of $87.

### First 

""We observed 5 younger-than usual patients who had strokes. Some reported having prior issues but refusing to come into the hospital due to Covid fear. We found Covid to be present in these 5. We are experiencing higher than usual stroke cases at the moment. **We conclude by saying 'The association between large-vessel stroke and Covid-19 in young patients requires further investigation.'** Social distancing, isolation, and reluctance to present to the hospital may contribute to poor outcomes. Two patients in our series delayed calling an ambulance because they were concerned about going to a hospital during the pandemic.""

### Second 

""The present report describes a case of cardiac involvement in a patient affected by COVID-19. Herein, we describe a patient without a history of cardiovascular disease admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 and severe LV dysfunction and acute myopericarditis. **As endomyocardial biopsy was not performed, limitations of this report are the lack of the histological demonstration of myocarditis and the absence of viral genome search in the heart.*""

### Third 

""In our analysis, the clearest risk factors for the development of AKI were indicators of severe COVID-19, *specifically the need for ventilator support or vasopressor drug treatment*. The etiology of AKI in COVID-19 cases has not been fully elucidated. **The present study has limitations. First, because this is an observational study, we cannot make inferences regarding causal relationships between exposures and AKI**. Second, although we have adjusted for potential confounders, **there may be potential unmeasured confounders.**""

I couldn't give a shit what colour your skin is, it makes no difference to anything, but thanks for confusing the shit out of me with your family history.  By all means refuse to answer any of my queries below, I honestly don't care it was just such a mess of a sentence that I'm now curious.  

""I may be* white but we’re** from Africa*** and half of my family is Black from Africa and the USA**** and parts of Asia""   

*It's either, I'm maybe white, or I may be white.  ""I maybe white"" doesn't function correctly as a group of words. So that's just a grammatical thing, but could have aided in my confusion.
**I'm assuming the we is your biological family
*** Is that European invader in South Africa kinda white but from Africa?  Because wouldn't you still be from English/Spanish/French/Dutch descent
****Native American?  Or EU Americans? 

""Him and all of the governor’s and mayors should be on the news or coming out to the protests and saying we need to make a change and I’ve said in another post that all officers should have their body cams evaluated every single day by a psychologist not linked to the police department and if they’re showing discrimination then they should be instantly kicked off the police force.""  
So would you agree that as not one of these things are happening its justifiable to protest, given that it's been centuries of asking, and like you say we've got the technology now so at least decades where they have had the chance to do something.  And currently the protesters have a biological weapon to use as leverage against those in power (Trump's thick but he's not thick enough to not understand that, I hope), which is unquestionably more impactful than burning a building police station down or looting an insured Target - all of which potentially could have been done by the police, government, racists or opportunists due to the peaceful protest and would then be used to vilianize the protesters, delegitimizing the protesters efforts.  - For example, me, I'm an asshole, I'd 100% take advantage to destroy some government buildings and/or steal things, partly due to white privileged making me fairly sure I won't get caught in the first place, and if I was caught I know I would have more relaxed sentencing, other white people that also have had generations of privilege would likely help me out etc.  ANNND I'm still a nihilist, so why not, could get a new set of bedsheets out of it.",,1591280558,{},fsv2b4m,False,t3_gv6l8z,False,True,t1_fsuxeko,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gv6l8z/demonstrators_choose_protest_over_pandemic/fsv2b4m/,1591280559,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

# Leading Journals Sound Alarm on COVID-19 Studies

Batya Swift Yasgur, MA, LSW

June 03, 2020

*Editor's note: Find the latest COVID-19 news and guidance in Medscape's* [*Coronavirus Resource Center.*](https://click.mail.medscape.com/?qs=7897e8a8050f0da1a345a147e757604d439270761e530622e197de61cb64e9adb9e4594cdbe82495699a14c29cec36a51be5888f278d6e8e)

Major journals are raising concern about the database underlying recent studies of patients with COVID-19.

The editors at *The Lancet* issued an ""[Expression of Concern](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31290-3/fulltext)"" today regarding data reported in [a large observational study](https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(20)31180-6.pdf) that showed an association between the antimalarial drugs hydroxychloroquine and [chloroquine](https://reference.medscape.com/drug/aralen-chloroquine-phosphate-chloroquine-342687) — with or without the antibiotics [azithromycin](https://reference.medscape.com/drug/zithromax-zmax-azithromycin-342523) and [clarithromycin](https://reference.medscape.com/drug/biaxin-xl-clarithromycin-342524) — and dramatically increased in-hospital mortality and cardiac arrhythmias in patients with COVID-19 treated vs those not treated with these agents.

*The Lancet* editors state that ""important scientific questions have been raised"" about the data reported in that paper. The expression of concern followed [an open letter](https://zenodo.org/record/3871094#.XtevCC2ZP3B), penned by more than 200 scientists, ethicists, and clinicians and posted on May 28, questioning the data and ethics of the study, [as reported by](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/931539) *Medscape Medical News.*

A similar ""[Expression of Concern](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2020822?query=featured_home)"" was issued by the *New England Journal of Medicine* June 2, noting ""substantive concerns"" regarding the ""quality of information"" used in a study [published May 1](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2007621) that analyzed cardiovascular disease and mortality in patients with COVID-19, noting that there was no increase in in-hospital mortality with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in the setting of COVID-19.

The statement was likewise a response to a [June 2 open letter](https://zenodo.org/record/3873178#.XtcIyi2ZP3C) carrying 174 signatures.

The May 28 and June 2 open letter signatures were spearheaded by James Watson, DPhil, a statistician at the Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research in Thailand.

The *New England Journal of Medicine* has ""asked the authors to provide evidence that the data are reliable,"" stated Eric J. Rubin MD, PhD, editor of the *New England Journal* and author of the comment.

### Far-Reaching Implications

On the basis of the findings reported by Mehra et al in *The Lancet*, the World Health Organization (WHO) halted enrollment in the hydroxychloroquine component of the [SOLIDARITY](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/solidarity-clinical-trial-for-covid-19-treatments) trial, an international randomized trial of medications being used to treat COVID-19.

However, in light of the new critique of the data that appeared in *The Lancet,* a safety monitoring committee evaluated the mortality rates in the WHO's SOLIDARITY trial as well as the [RECOVERY](https://www.recoverytrial.net/) trial — a United Kingdom-based trial also studying hydroxychloroquine — and ""recommend that there are no reasons to modify the trial protocol,"" stated WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus today in a press conference.

#Translation:

#This weekend, test coordinator Harriet Wallberg jumped off her assignment. 
#Now she points out the Public Health Agency's strategy as one of the explanations behind Sweden's high death toll. 
#- The countries that started testing broadly and early in early years have managed to keep the numbers of deceased at low levels compared to countries that have not tested widely.


After months of tangling with the tests, the government had to try something new. On May 8, Harriet Wallberg, professor at the Karolinska Institute, was appointed test coordinator to identify problems in the test chain and map the regions' work. 

But the title, which would become a symbol of the government's ability to act, was something else. After only three weeks, she left her mission on Sunday and canceled her visit to Parliament's Social Committee on Wednesday.

- I came to the conclusion that we need to enter a new phase, where everyone with symptoms should be tested and if you are positive you should be isolated in combination with a broad infection tracking. To save lives and be better prepared this fall. I am not the one who is going to start it operationally, it is the Public Health Authority that makes recommendations and the regions follow these. When I take on an assignment, I really want to feel that I can contribute something. If I were to remain, it would mean double command.

On the second command bridge stood the Public Health Authority's Karin Tegmark Wisell and Harriet Wallberg believes that in one authority two branches cannot work with the same thing.

- You could think that I was like the spider in the net and could tell people what they would do. But I did not have that mandate. Rather, my role became an adviser and surveyor. As I see it, I have already made great use. I have contributed to the steps taken by the Public Health Authority in May to increase the testing in elderly care and among health and care staff, she says.

In 2016, Wallberg was fired from the position of university chancellor for KI in connection with the Macchiarini affair after an investigation identified her as responsible for recruiting the scandal surgeon. An investigation she considers herself contains errors.   

Since then, she has had an ordinance at the Government Offices and has, among other things, devoted herself to conducting the investigation. When Wallberg's employment expired on May 31, she felt that both the government and the Public Health Authority wanted her to continue.

- But I did an analysis of what I could contribute and if I could add something more than what I already did. In that situation, I had a dialogue with the Director of Public Health Johan Carlson about what I could do: will it not be a strange role if I continue? Isn't it a double command? We concluded that it is actually a strange situation,” she says.

You have had the opportunity to continue working on a crisis to an extent we have never seen before, yet do you not think you can do any good? 

- You have to have a decision mandate in order to achieve something. I did not have that role. I have helped to do a job and to pass on recommendations. 

State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell tells DN that Harriet Wallberg's assignment can be regarded as completed as the procedure for testing has become different when the regions have taken over much of the responsibility.

- It was to get to that cooperation that was the test coordinator's task. Now it is a place and therefore the need falls away right now, he says.

Anders Tegnell opened in a well-publicized interview with Swedish Radio on Wednesday that there are things Sweden could do better during the crisis. He tells DN, among other things, that the tests should have started earlier. 

**Harriet Wallberg agrees. She says that the Public Health Agency changed its strategy when the infection began to spread widely in the country - people stopped testing for symptoms with symptoms that would not be admitted to hospital and ended the infection wounds. Wallberg sees the changed course as one of several explanations for Sweden's high death rates.**

**- WHO has said that we will respond to the pandemic by testing, testing. And if you look at countries that managed to keep the infection down, you have tested and had great capacity for infection detection. The numbers speak for themselves.**

How do you mean? 

**- The countries that started testing broadly and early in early years have managed to keep the numbers of deceased per million inhabitants at low levels compared to countries that have not tested widely. Examples of countries that have been successful are Germany, South Korea and Iceland.**

But there is also another explanation for what Wallborg calls a Swedish failure. 

- We knew from China that the elderly were at risk. We talked about protecting the elderly but no efforts were made to ensure that the elderly care had protective equipment and education. It is the unclear responsibility that lies with it. 
Harriet Wallberg now returns to his full-time position as professor of physiology at the Karolinska Institute. Afterwards, she leaves a clear message to the Public Health Authority and the regions: 

**- We are at a stage when we still have relatively high death rates and large spread of infection. Now that we go into the summer and the infection will go down a bit, it is time to start testing broadly, isolate the infected and the infected ulcer. The most important thing for our country is to bring down the infection so people do not have to get sick and even die.**",,1591289276,{},fsvkha2,True,t3_gwl4u9,False,True,t3_gwl4u9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gwl4u9/the_test_coordinator_on_why_she_quit_didnt_have_a/fsvkha2/,1591291447,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Go to college. I dropped out 10 years ago and am finally back. You know why? Because I can't find a decent job without a college education. The only work I can find is retail + minimum wage jobs. They suck. You do not make enough to live on. Even management jobs now want at least an associate's degree. 

It is not 1950 anymore grandpa. Without an education, you are screwed. Unless you get lucky, you will end up living in poverty.

Do not believe all the bs about ""the trades"" you read on Reddit. I have plenty of family members in ""the trades."" They are not making 6 figures a year + living in a mansion like Reddit wants you to believe. It is middle-class income for a lot of work. Unless you own the company, you are not going to be making 6 figures a year. Job security doesn't exist. Layoffs are often. You are sometimes competing against 1000 other people for a job.

I am from italy and the last thing they will reopen here are schools. You can go to the gym since may 25th, you can go to a pub or restaurant since may 18th. On public transportation customers are required to wear mask and gloves.

But schools? No way.

The reasoning is the following: teachers are usually old, classes are full, most kids are asymptomatic and it is hard to determine if they are infected, when they play together they can easily spread the virus and in addition they spend time with their grandparents (let's say they live with them or if their parents are working the grandparents take care of them).

This is anything but rational when you are willfully ignorant like Tegnell or Giesecke who never stop failling in their predictions, just because they didn't pay attention to other scientists.           
This anything but cold-headed when you're driven by the panic of economic downfall or worst, the simple fear of changing your habits (Is it so hard to stop going to restaurants and hairdressers for 3 months?).

Great! They did ""panic-shutdown"" schools, but they didn't panic because they kept the elementary schools [opened](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/gbhdsv/parents_tell_about_the_unreal_situation_at_kåge/).      
It's not ""driving the pandemic""? So what? You think you can stop a pandemic if you ignore everything that's not the main factor? Do you know what's the definition of a **pan**demic?

The protests are not even close to a normal day in our country.  Not. even. close.

If there is zero spike from the protests then it shows that outdoor gatherings with mild social distancing aka most wearing masks will not cause a spike.

We won't know for at least a month.  This thing is exponential so it will take time.  Very possible it will have a small increase but won't go further due to self isolation.

I personally think that while before we would go about our daily lives feeling a little under the weather, now, if you are sick even mild you self isolate.  That combined with not going to restaurants and bars and other indoor facilities is suppressing spread drastically.

A game-changing technique for imaging molecules known as cryo-electron microscopy has produced its sharpest pictures yet — and, for the first time, discerned individual atoms in a protein.

By achieving atomic resolution using cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), researchers will be able to understand, in unprecedented detail, the workings of proteins that cannot easily be examined by other imaging techniques, such as X-ray crystallography.

The breakthrough, reported by two laboratories late last month, cements cryo-EM’s position as the dominant tool for mapping the 3D shapes of proteins, say scientists.

An influential study which found anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine raised the risk of cardiac issues has been retracted by its three authors.

The study, published on May 22 in the UK's prestegious Lancet medical journal, relied on bogus data from a company called Surgisphere, which would not transfer the full dataset for an independent review, and ""can no longer vouch for the veracity of the primary data sources.""

Notably, the World Health Organization halted trials of the drug, only to reverse course after the Lancet issued a major disclaimer regarding the study.

It wasn't just the WHO who used it to knock HCQ either - as the study was heavily relied upon by the left to mock President Trump for taking the drug.

[],,Coherent_Tangent,,,[],,,,text,t2_1pzq4re,False,False,[],"Just for some context; Florida averaged about 3,000 pneumonia deaths for the entire year from 2014-2018. From the beginning of February through the end of May, Florida already has had over 5,800 ""pneumonia"" deaths. They are only counting 2,600 COVID deaths thus far. Only 1,125 of the COVID deaths are counted as having pneumonia. 

Of the 5,800 ""pneumonia"" deaths, only 1,125 are considered to have COVID. This means there are already approximately 1,600 (5,800 - 1,125 - 3,000 = 1,675) more ""pneumonia"" deaths than would normally be expected for the entire year. This is after backing out COVID deaths, and this is just since just February.

One could reasonably conclude that more than the 1,600 excess deaths are attributable to COVID. This is because we haven't even gotten through October, November, and December (flu season).

 I am aware that the COVID deaths listed on the second link are behind the [2,600](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/usa/florida/) I quoted. The notes near the bottom of the CDCindicate that COVID deaths are about a week behind. This would not account for the full 1,600 missing deaths, and that number is likely to climb by the time the COVID deaths catch up.

Make of the data what you will.

A large component of that was making it seem like the danger had passed, that the first wave was over when it wasn't and the only thing we needed to worry about was if it would come back in the fall.

I still remember sitting in my car, it was April 22nd if I'm recalling it correctly, I had to take my dog to the vet and hadn't really been out of the house much.  While I waited I listened to the daily briefings (remember when those were a thing).  The new cases and new death stats had been holding steady since about April 4th, but they weren't going down at all.

That briefing though they came out and the entire first part was about whether or not we would have a second wave in the fall.  It struck me as odd because they just kept talking about it ""coming back.""  I thought, ""Did I miss something, did it go away? How can it 'come back' if it's still here?""

But they plowed forward and from that moment forward, the messaging from the top was, ""First wave is over, time to reopen, maybe we will have to deal with a second wave in the fall.""  

People were hungry to get back to normal, and so like a parched man in a desert, I think a lot of people chugged down the ""First waves over, time to reopen"" kool aide.

It depends on a lot of factors. 

Does it spread outdoors? 

Are asymptomatic people less likely to spread it simply because they aren't coughing like people with symptoms would be? If that's the case we have large crowds getting hit with tear gas causing them to cough while also gasping for air in close proximity to one another.

How are people getting to protests? Will they be taking public transportation? Car pooling with friends or groups who organized protests on social media?

Then there is possibly the most important factor. How long will the protests last? Will people catch the virus the first week or two and continue protesting, spreading it even further.

There's no way to predict an accurate number but I fear it won't be good. 

Then we have to worry about what happens if there is a huge spike in cases and states try shutting things down again to control it. Will there be anti lockdown protests and more riots? Will there be counter protesters who think we should lock down fighting with the people who don't want another lockdown?

Our center still uses hardline phone systems, so to push our 911 calls to our backup center Bell has to actually flip a switch in their building to redirect the calls.  It’s not just a simple call forward or VOIP system.

Third.  Our Intranet for our medical data isn’t just behind a firewall, its physically isolated without a connection to the internet as a whole.  
Fourth issue, the software we use is one of the more popular (like top 3) programs, and the licensing cost is expensive and we pay per copy installed.  (Five figure for each type expensive) With 5 platoons of employees,  that operating cost would rival their salaries.

And the the $500k homes 2 miles away can only get dish options.  Personally, I wouldn't pay half a million dollars for a home unless I could get reliable internet because, oh yeah the dish options here are down more than not. 

My brother is 35 minutes from Albany Oregon. In a heavily forested area. So he has no line of sight. Hence no reception for even pocket internet (cell phones). Having worked for the local internet company, he even climbed 100 ft up and ran a tower relay hoping that would boost signal,  but no such luck. (Im not sure I used the right terminology there).

Rural internet options, or lack there of, is a horrible problem in this country.  According to report results on the FCC website, 19million american (6% of America)  still dont have access to broadband speed that are reliable and fast. And to top it of, nearly a quarter of Americans in rural areas, 14.5 million people, lack access altogether. Tribal areas are at an alarming rate of one third without access.

In a developed nation like the USofA, it just doesn't make sense to me that we are still struggling to provide internet access to NINETEEN MILLION AMERICANS. Underdeveloped nations often prioritize internet access and phones over water. So this just doesn't make a lick of sense when we are so technologically advanced.

Obviously there's a difference in that here, if you don't have health insurance, you'll have to pay out of pocket.

Testing in and of itself doesn't lower hospitalizations and deaths. You are correct that we may *have* fewer cases even while testing for more, but testing itself doesn't cause anything. 

As far as distancing goes - as I explained above, we *know* movement was down as low as it got around the end of March or beginning of April. After that point, people started moving around and interacting again (note that this isn't to previous levels, but you would have expected to see an associated spike).

Since then, you've only gotten less and less social distancing as time goes on. My city only just started to reopen today, but I can guarantee that there have been more and more gatherings in homes as time has gone on. On top of that, places like GA have now been open for 6 weeks (with several others at ~a month) and we haven't seen any spikes in hospitalizations or deaths. This is even true for countries in Europe - the Netherlands has basically released a statement saying that they have no idea why reopening didn't cause them problems, but it didn't. 

So unless your argument is that currently open states are somehow distancing better than they were when everyone was locked down, I don't see how social distancing can explain the drops in deaths and hospitalizations we're seeing in most places.",,1591232220,{},fst6ep7,False,t3_gvrw34,False,True,t1_fst5615,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gvrw34/coronavirus_hospitalizations_keep_falling/fst6ep7/,1591239839,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Been reading about dark winter. And how covid-19 was pretty much predicted since 2001. 19 years. And because of racism....trump won. Then because of racism he ignored any and everything attached to obama. Even dark winter.

Then. When things hit the fan it was racism that allowed white people infected with it to come back to america untested, untreated and generally unquarantined. While trump blamed china, chinese people and asians in general. Leading to even more spread.

He then let racism dictate who could get what and when. Leading to even more spread. Sure, churches spread it even more but it wasn't until white guys with guns started screaming freedom that all of a sudden whether people should be allowed to go out or not was debatable. Spreading it again.

And then a white cop murdered a black man. People wanted to protest it. And because it was a cop. Cops all over the country made matters so much worse. With the help of mayors and politicians and all kinds of people.

So instead of one peaceful protest on one day. Where people would do their best to respect social distancing. We end up with cops literally spraying people so they have no choice but to take off their masks to breath. Spreading it further.

When covid-19 was killing people left and right. No curfew. But since people want to protest against a black man being murdered...the harshest curfew we've ever seen in american history in generations. And the most expansive.

And the dumbest too. Rioting and looting is still happening of course. Don't ask me how considering protesters are damned near afraid for their lives so they stick together which you'd think would make looters and rioters easier for cops to spot..but nope..cops go after protesters specifically. While blaming the rioting and looting on protesters.

And now because of racism..rioters, looters, protesters and people who are just trying to get from a to b are all now considered the same people. Making it so even more places close out of fear. There's much less communication. Cops now know they can get away with even more than before. Trump now knows he can get away with more than before.

Yeah, there is.

&gt;I think its just far more likely you might just not understand basic statistics. 

Here is a simple statistic... between April 2 and May 24, only 36% of the deaths were reported within 3 days of occurring. On average, each day's total turned out to be three times higher than the number reported two days after they happened.

For example, on May 6, the Swedish government reported that there was 28 deaths on May 4. The latest official figures say that there were actually 84 deaths on May 4.

Want to see something interesting?

[Here is a graph showing what percentage of each day's deaths were reported within 3 days of occurring.](https://i.imgur.com/6ffId2h.png)

There is a very clear downward trend in the percentage of deaths reported within three days of occurring. Why? Why is it taking longer and longer to report so few deaths?

I think the statistics back up my argument.

&gt; So let me get this straight. The week after we had the highest deaths he said that this weeks numbers were lower than last weeks higher numbers? Yeah...... Thats kinda what highest means. 

Nope. Check those statistics you seem to understand so well. Here. let me help.

    Date		Deaths
    Apr 11		103
    Apr 12		97
    Apr 13		85
    Apr 14		91
    Apr 15		115
    Apr 16		111
    Apr 17		82

Then, on April 18, Tegnell said:

&gt; Anders Tegnell says that the figures are stable and somewhat under their level of the previous week, with the number of deaths averaging at around 70 a day. 

He was totally, utterly, wrong.... or he was lying his ass off.

Oh wait... surely you're not trying to say he was predicting the future? I mean you can't seriously be claiming he was talking about the week AFTER he gave the interview? No one is that stupid.

&gt; Why the hell would you make people go work extra during weekends, in a pandemic, when medical staff is stretched thin as is. 

Two points: First, the people that compile the figures are not ""medical staff"", they are administrators. Second... thousands of people are fucking dying. Understanding what is happening *in real time* is critical to dealing with the emergency and preventing as many deaths as possible. You seriously expect me to believe no one was working on the weekends? 

Oh wait, it turns out they actually were... they just waited until the middle of the work week to report most of the numbers.

May 14 was a Sunday... they still managed to report 3 deaths that had occurred that day. Of course there was actually at least 46 deaths that day... but clearly they were compiling and reporting some of the numbers on that weekend and every other weekend.

Don't fool yourself. They are perfectly capable of compiling the statistics on a weekend. They just choose not to report most of them.

&gt; There is absolutely nothing to be gained here by making the death stat have less delay. 

Maybe not, but there is everything to gain by under reporting deaths until two or more weeks after they occur. That's how they get the curve to flatten.

Of course, a month later it becomes clear the curve didn't actually flatten, but by then the gullible are already looking at the latest figures and swallowing the same bullshit all over again.",,1591262752,{},fsude8n,False,t3_gvp6r4,False,True,t1_fsu47w2,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gvp6r4/swedish_expert_admits_mistakes_in_countrys/fsude8n/,1591262752,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

The Blitz was a dark and terrifying period that actually began with the Tories not wanting Londoners to go into the underground because they thought they wouldn't come back out again.

Londoners broke into one station and eventually the government began allowing them to use it as a shelter.

Years later, we are led to believe that the underground being used as a bomb shelter was part of a plan instead of at the demand and action of the people.

Just like every call this government has made with Coronavirus.

Businesses began social distancing and WFH orders before the government locked down.

We know the government locked down too late - other countries show that.

The government has started to open back up again because of the calls of the scum media who have financial interests at risk. They aren't following a scientific strategy.

The blitz is an appropriate comparison in this instance because:

- the scale of the blitz is something every UK citizen learns about at school, so we are familiar with its affect.

- the government were slow to provide adequate protection to Londoners, who decided to take action to protect themselves.

89% of the people who do require hospitalization from Covid have underlying conditions.

The most common were high blood pressure (49.7%), obesity (48.3%), chronic lung disease (34.6%), diabetes (28.3%), and cardiovascular disease (27.8%).

Takeaways -

- Covid only seriously affects a small portion of people who get it, from ""almost none"" at the young ages, to ""1 in 20"" when you are in your 40s, to ""1 in 5"" when you are in your 80s.

- If you are in that small group of seriously affected people, it is most likely because you have health issues and you are more vulnerable to things. Although there is a very very slim chance that if you are in that group even though you dont have health issues.

- Unhealthy people suffer more severely from various diseases and illnesses, healthy people suffer less. This is not strange.

- Fatality rate only hits 1% when you are over 60.

- 4 out of every 5 seniors over 80yrs old who get Covid dont need to go to the hospital for it.

So far I havent been able to get anyone to link me to a single concrete example of permanent long term effects from Covid.

Lot of articles use language like yours does-

&gt;Physicians report that patients hospitalized for Covid-19 are experiencing high rates of blood clots that can cause strokes, heart attacks, lung blockages, and other complications, Parshley reports.
&gt; 
&gt;For instance, physicians are seeing an uptick in strokes among young patients with Covid-19.
&gt; 
The blood clots also can travel to other organs, leading to ongoing health problems. For instance, pulmonary embolisms, which occur when the clots block circulation to the lungs, can cause ongoing ""functional limitations,"" like fatigue, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, and discomfort when performing physical activity, Parshley reports. Similarly, blood clots in the kidneys can cause renal failure, which can cause life-long complications. 

That is basically saying .. Covid can cause blood clots, which could travel to other parts of the body, which could cause pulmonary embolisms, which could result in ongoing functional limitations.

So I really wish some of this was actually &gt;documented&lt; before people say things like -

But if I was to take your ""morality"" to its obvious conclusion, it would be far better to reduce taxes on the wealthier so that they can enjoy their lives more, at the expense of the poorer living without healthcare, food or shelter.

The percentage is calculated based on the number of deaths for that day that were reported on June 3.

So, for example, on May 12 it was reported that there was 19 deaths on May 10. On June 3 it was reported that there were actually 59 deaths on May 10. That means 32% of the total number of deaths on May 10 was reported by May 12.

[Now here is the graph showing the trend for that percentage.](https://i.imgur.com/6ffId2h.png)

The downward trend is undeniable. Fewer and fewer of the deaths that occur on a single day are being reported within three days of occurring.

I can not think of any rational reason for this delay to be increasing as it so obviously is. They can't argue that the number of deaths is overloading their ability to compile the data, because they are also claiming there are fewer deaths each day.

So what other possible reason could cause such and obvious increase in the lag?

It still travels in the air outdoors, but if it's windy it can be dispersed fairly well. Although sitting right next to an infected person outside (sharing a beach blanket, for example) is still risky.

A lot of the earlier recommendations and local regulations came from earlier times, when transmission was more mysterious. But now we know it's somewhat unlikely to get it from surfaces, and pretty unlikely to get it from randomly passing somebody on a sidewalk for 10 seconds.

Wtf are you talking about??? Chinese people have a ""genetic predisposition"" to have worse effects? WHERE did you get that???

&gt; People who have less common knowledge of Viruses than Europeans. 

So you're saying that a country with more than a BILLION people have NO biologists and NO scientists?

&gt; People who largely believe in Alternative medicines as a treatment before they consult a doctor 

Have you EVER tried to see a doctor in Asia??? By just the sheer number in population, it takes forever to see a doctor because every doctor's office is crowded because there are so many people. Even in Hong Kong, you can expect very long waits to see any doctor. 

China handled the virus with a very draconian lockdown. People weren't allowed out. Period. They have the population size and manpower to do half-assed deliveries to households. People had dwindled supplies but no one was allowed out at all. We didn't have those kinds of lockdowns in North America. Like shit, people were still going to Walmarts and Costcos in droves during our ""lockdowns"". We didn't even do a proper lockdown. And then we had people gathering and protesting lockdowns. We still had our public transit and liquor stores and dollar stores and takeout all running during our lockdown. China shut EVERYTHING down. 

Do I believe anyone's numbers are totally real? No. But do I think China effectively handled the outbreak? Absolutely. And if Karen's start crying saying they can't breathe with a mask on...do I think the CCP would hesitate for even one second give Karen a well-deserved backhand bitchslap? Absolutely NOT.

If the median incubation period is 5-6 days, and large scale protests have been going on for 9 days, then presumably people who contacted the virus at the start of the protests would have only very recently started showing symptoms? As the people protesting are generally in the very low risk part of the population, if there is a second wave due to the protests, surely we wouldn’t see it until these people start infecting more vulnerable people?

There is no manupulation. I think its just far more likely you might just not understand basic statistics.

So let me get this straight. The week after we had the highest deaths he said that this weeks numbers were lower than last weeks higher numbers? Yeah...... Thats kinda what highest means.

Yes guys you need to work weekends or KiwibattlerNZ WONT BELIEVE. /s

Why the hell would you make people go work extra during weekends, in a pandemic, when medical staff is stretched thin as is. 

Just so the statistics will look better?

That difference between their annual budget and the actual, total dollar number they were receiving to prevent and detect outbreaks of infectious diseases is why you’re seeing seemingly contradictory statements about their budget remaining flat but also their epidemic prevention programs being defunded.

Their annual budget has remained flat, but at the same time the amount of funding they received specifically to “prevent infectious-disease threats from becoming epidemics“ (funding that was in addition to their annual budget) was greatly reduced from prior levels.

From Feb 2018:

&gt;	The CDC programs, part of a global health security initiative, train front-line workers in outbreak detection and work to strengthen laboratory and emergency response systems in countries where disease risks are greatest. The goal is to stop future outbreaks at their source.
&gt;
&gt;Most of the funding comes from a one-time, five-year emergency package that Congress approved to respond to the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. About $600 million was awarded to the CDC to help countries prevent infectious-disease threats from becoming epidemics. That money is slated to run out by September 2019.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;	Countries where the CDC is planning to scale back include some of the world’s hot spots for emerging infectious disease, such as China, Pakistan, Haiti, Rwanda and Congo.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;	Global health organizations said critical momentum will be lost if epidemic prevention funding is reduced, leaving the world unprepared for the next outbreak. 
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;	On Monday, a coalition of global health organizations representing more than 200 groups and companies sent a letter to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar asking the administration to reconsider the planned reductions to programs they described as essential to health and national security.
&gt;
&gt;	“Not only will CDC be forced to narrow its countries of operations, but the U.S. also stands to lose vital information about epidemic threats garnered on the ground through trusted relationships, real-time surveillance, and research,” wrote the coalition, which included the Global Health Security Agenda Consortium and the Global Health Council.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;	“This is the front line against terrible organisms,” said Tom Frieden, the former CDC director who led the agency during the Ebola and Zika outbreaks. He now heads Resolve to Save Lives, a global initiative to prevent epidemics. Referring to dangerous pathogens, he said: “Like terrorism, you can’t fight it just within our borders. You’ve got to fight epidemic diseases where they emerge.”
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;The CDC has about $150 million remaining from the one-time Ebola emergency package for these global health security programs, the senior government official said. That money will be used this year and in fiscal 2019, but without substantial new resources, that leaves only the agency's core annual budget, which has remained flat at about $50 million to $60 million.

This is generally good, but it leaves us without a clear picture of the actual toll and spread of COVID-19, and under-reporting of COVID deaths can lead to bad policy decisions.

This likely under-reporting of deaths is happening in every state in the US - if you look at the reported deaths due to “unclassified viral pneumonia” and compare to the five-year historical average, we’ve seen a 300+% increase nationwide, and in some states the increase is as high as 500%. There’s a couple week lag in the CDC numbers as states send in death certificates, and so a couple days ago the CDC’s official tally sat at 77,000. At the same time, there were 39,000 excess deaths due to unclassified pneumonia (beyond what would be expected between February and May based on the last five years). If that ratio holds up, we likely have over 150,000 deaths directly due to COVID-19 (and this is just taking into account instances of excess pneumonia deaths - the same analysis needs to be done for stroke and heart attacks). Whether it’s mis-counting or under-counting, some states are likely mis-reporting over 80% of their COVID-19 deaths.

The current situation about testing in Sweden is absurd, though. An explicit part of the strategy of the Swedish COVID-19 management is to test at least 100 000 persons per week. It was announced that we should have reached that level in mid-may. In practice we are now, in early June, at about 35k per week. There is a huge, public and ugly fight about whose fault that is.

&gt;After participants read the consent form, their comprehension of its contents was assessed; participants provided a digitally captured signature to indicate informed consent. We sent follow-up e-mail surveys on days 1, 5, 10, and 14. A survey at 4 to 6 weeks asked about any follow-up testing, illness, or hospitalizations. Participants who did not respond to follow-up surveys received text messages, e-mails, telephone calls, or a combination of these to ascertain their outcomes. When these methods were unsuccessful, the emergency contact provided by the enrollee was contacted to determine the participant’s illness and vital status. When all communication methods were exhausted, Internet searches for obituaries were performed to ascertain vital status.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;The primary outcome was prespecified as symptomatic illness confirmed by a positive molecular assay or, if testing was unavailable, Covid-19–related symptoms. We assumed that health care workers would have access to Covid-19 testing if symptomatic; however, access to testing was limited throughout the trial period. Covid-19–related symptoms were based on U.S. Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists criteria for confirmed cases (positivity for SARS-Cov-2 on PCR assay), probable cases (the presence of cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing, or the presence of two or more symptoms of fever, chills, rigors, myalgia, headache, sore throat, and new olfactory and taste disorders), and possible cases (the presence of one or more compatible symptoms, which could include diarrhea).[15](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2016638?query=featured_home#) All the participants had epidemiologic linkage,[15](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2016638?query=featured_home#) per trial eligibility criteria. Four infectious disease physicians who were unaware of the trial-group assignments reviewed symptomatic participants to generate a consensus with respect to whether their condition met the case definition

So as i understand they are not confirming the PCR directly or with an institution, but with survey questions?

Looking at the appendix:

&gt;Clinical Criteria for Reporting

I'm not saying it's wrong, but that's pure speculation at this point. We won't know that for a long time. 

&gt; There are 67,254 confirmed recoveries.

Those are confirmed which means there was reason for them to re-test. Most cases that aren't hospitalized are probably not retested. Most states are assuming it is recovered after a 14 or 21 day period from initial testing and not hospitalized (and not dead, of course).

&gt;So is it possible that New York peaked a long time ago and it isn't showing up in the data

Looking at the graph a bit down in the link you provided shows a pretty strong peak mid March/early April as far as new cases. If you assume the non-fatal rate of people who had it more than 15 (or 20) days ago are recovered, the active cases are way lower.

New York is being very conservative with how many they are considering/presuming recovered. 308k of your total cases were tested OVER a month ago on 05.01. I'd say it's safe to assume half of that, which would be your tested 04.01 and prior, is recovered/dead.

And yes, it's not correct to say that many people absolutely will have long term effects on their lungs and organs. Also, the reports are out of Wuhan because they are the ones who have had those recovered the longest. Again, however I stress there is NO PHYSICAL WAY to find documentation of permanent damage until we have studies which won't exist for another 20 years at least. 

All we can do is look at similar diseases, and similar organ damage and extrapolate likely term effects from that. Any disease serious enough to require hospitalization can result in long term sequelae. Ebola also caused kidney damage in survivors which lead to later kidney disease and mortality. Even influenza A resulted in long term lung damage (at least 2 years after infection) to some patients. 

Looking at the most similar virus, a small percentage of SARS (1) victims had long term lung and kidney damage, it doesn't seem unlikely that a small percentage of victims here will most likely also suffer similar long term effects. 40% of SARS patient in a study experienced a type of lung dysfunction involving the transfer of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the lung and the blood, which never went away (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41413-020-0084-5) although almost all got their lung capacity back after 15 years. 


So, given the number of severely ill patients requiring icu stays, it's not unreasonable to think that many patients (not in terms of % infected, just like a largish chunk of people) will probably have some long term damage.",,1591269000,{},fsuk8kt,False,t3_gw9m3j,False,True,t1_fsugp1z,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gw9m3j/nick_corderos_wife_reveals_hes_still_fighting/fsuk8kt/,1591269002,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

I could not agree more. At a minimum we are expecting about a $150,000 cut from our state funding and yet somehow we are going to do all of this?

There are certainly churches that abuse the money - pastors or priests with BMWs and private helecoptors (really looking at you Joel Osteen) - but there are plenty of small and medium sized churches that need that money. My church, for example, feeds and assists over 700 people a month on average - a majority of them are the elderly and children. It's a somewhat small church, too. When I was having some really hard times, they've helped me pay my rent, and keep funds aside to do so for other people. They turn into an emergency shelter in the winter and allow the homeless a place to sleep when we begin getting to temperatures when they're going to freeze to death. They have a food pantry, and the priest gives out $100+ gift cards during Christmas from his own pockets to make sure families that are struggling can have a Christmas meal, or that the parents can get their kids SOMETHING. He only makes $30k a year, and lives in the rectory on site or the building. We can ask for the church's tax and income information at any point of the year we want, and they're incredibly transparent. 


My point is, there are a *lot* of good churches. To just lump them all together isn't fair. Many priests especially take ""vows of poverty"". They do plenty for the economy by giving people hope (I would have killed myself several times over if not for the love that I've felt from several church-goers, priestess, etc.) and by assisting the needy. I guess my church is pointless during the pandemic because they feed people who need it? We also subsist off of tithes and grants as a non-profit - my church makes 0 profit from anywhere else. Besides, everyone has a right to want their organization to continue (though I don't think corporations should be included in this).

You’re right that when the motivation is cost saving it’s a disaster because they do exactly what you say and hire cheap idiots. But even when the motivation is just availability of talent the communication and cultural issues are real.

About the only times I’ve seen it work are when you have onshore people from the same country that handle project management and can identify the remote slackers and idiots before they derail the whole thing. (Everywhere has slackers and idiots, but they can skim under the radar more easily when they’re thousands of miles away.)

By the time you’ve done that it can cost more than the entirely domestic solution. Cost saving alone just isn’t a great reason to ship work offshore. Availability of talent is a good reason, but it isn’t likely to be any cheaper in the end.

If you can dump the whole project entirely and turn it into a buy rather than build problem it might work, except you’re back to the offshore support problem - language issues, scripted responses, low cost poorly trained agents.

So what if their boomers didn't have a better education? At least China's boomer's listen to their government when their government tells them to put on a freaking mask so no one gets sick. 

And just look at the draconian lockdown right at Chinese new year...they shut down even supermarkets. People tried, as people will always try, to ignore rules and go on. What did the CCP do? Weld the goddamn door shut with anyone's inability to comply with stay at home orders. Was it brutal? Absolutely. But it was absolutely necessary. Do I think anyone violated stay at home orders after somebody got their front door welded shut? Fuck, no. China's greatest asset is high availability of human capital. If ANYTHING jeopardizes that asset by reducing the number of human capital or the stability within the social structure of their pool of human capital, the CCP gets draconian and being draconian in these situations just gets shit done more efficiently. Not saying it's morally right or wrong, but this is how the virus was controlled.

And do you really want to open the door about transparency? Most western countries have NOT been transparent about how bad the virus can be. We have fudged our numbers so that we can open our economies again. On top of that, we've fired and tried to discredit people who didn't publicly forge numbers to fit the narrative that we wanted to open our economies. We've fired doctors who went to the media to tell the public how bad things were inside hospitals. And let's not even get into Potus using federal press conferences as an infomercial to push pharmaceuticals that he likely has personal investments in. You want to talk about lack of transparency? Just take a look at that big orange glob of a president...that guy is about as transparent as giant slab of concrete.

Look at the attitude of western countries...

""oh it's *just 1%* that dies, who cares..."" 
""oh, it's *just old people* who die, who cares...""
""a mask only protects *someone else* and doesn't protect ME, who cares...""

I hear this shit every single day. ""Me. Me. Me. Me."" Asian culture doesn't think like this because people are taught from Day 1 about the importance collective wellbeing. In western countries, we are taught from Day 1 to only look out for Number 1 and always do what is only best for Number 1. This is why our response to this virus was an epic fail.

And don't give me this ""we art holier than thou"" about PPE...by March, everyone was clearing PPE supplies. China did what it needed to do facing an epidemic to source PPE. Everyone was trying to source PPE when covid hit their country.  We should've took the Wuhan lockdown as a cue back in January and ramped up our production significantly but we just went about our merry way and did nothing. We gave excuses like ""oh *the Chinese* have a genetic predisposition to the virus. It won't affect ME..."" (again, that Me attitude) and we did nothing.

I'm just tired of the ""it's China's fault"" and ""china is lying about its numbers"" arguments. We made some VERY big mistakes and we need to own those mistakes, learn from it and change our system to be able to respond better to future epidemics.

If you zoom in closer, the article does mention it, there is more too it than their swift and precise handeling of the crisis. Some huge factors just came down to dumb luck.  


&gt;*A lot of Germany’s relatively good performance was down to luck. “\[We\] had the advantage that we had more time to prepare,” he says. “We saw the images from China and Italy before the wave hit us too.” But it also reacted more quickly to those images than other countries, he says, with “consistent testing and track and trace”.*

The approach Germany took to the crisis actually isn't that different from a lot of other countries in Europe. I think we (The Netherlands) even had a similiar approach. The difference being that at the exact moment the virus hit  we had a national holiday called Carnaval in our southern provinces, which caused an incredible increase in cases in just a matter of days.    


&gt;More importantly, the health system never came under too much pressure. “We never reached the point where we had too many people in intensive care,” says Streeck. “That meant we were never faced with the need for triage — when you only treat those patients with a greater chance of survival. For us, triage was only ever a theoretical possibility, never a real one.” 

The other side to this story is that there is an ongoing debate in Germany about reducing the amount of hospitals/IC beds. Where in my country (The Netherlands) this debate led to the reduction of IC beds in Germany this discussion was still ongoing. Effectively meaning they still had their huge amount of IC beds amids the COVID-19 outbreak. They even took Dutch COVID-19 patients in and acted as a pressure relief for Dutch hospitles.

Tl;dr: an Italian scientist really does think he has found a weakened form of the virus — from a swab with a very high viral load from a patient who never had symptoms — and now he is publishing his results. This could also lead to a vaccine. 

Arnaldo Caruso: ""The 'good' variant of the virus is genetically different""
The president of the Italian virology society says that the isolated variant in Brescia is not only less aggressive, but its RNA has ""significant mutations"" compared to that of the sequenced virus in the hottest months of the epidemic

The 'good' variant of the new coronavirus isolated in Brescia is not only ""extremely less aggressive"", but is also ""genetically very different"". That is, its RNA has ""significant mutations"" compared to that of the Sars-CoV-2 viruses sequenced in the ""hottest"" months of the Covid-19 epidemic. The announcement was made to Adnkronos Salute Arnaldo Caruso, president of the Italian virology society (Siv-Isv), who in recent days has communicated the discovery of ""a much less powerful viral variant. While the more aggressive ones take 2-3 days to exterminate all available target cells in vitro - he explained - this takes at least 6 days just to start attacking them "".


Today the step forward: the 'Brescia variant' found by the Microbiology Laboratory of the Asst Spedali Civili, directed by Caruso - isolated from a swab which, unlike those that have come to the attention of the centers appointed to process them in recent weeks, "" strangely, it had a very high viral load ""even though it came from"" a completely asymptomatic patient ""- it also appears genetically changed. Before saying ""we were waiting to compare ourselves with the most experienced colleagues in this field - specifies the expert, ordinary of Microbiology and Clinical Microbiology at the University of Brescia - Now we have done it and finally we can report that we have obtained a complete sequence strongly trusted. ""


The work ""is ready for publication - assures the number one of virologists - I am sending it to an international scientific journal and, as you know, this is a process that has its time. But as of now, anyone in the scientific community interested in the sequence will be able to contact me because we are absolutely ready to share it. This is what I expected at the first announcement, when I informed of the isolation of the new variant: curiosity, certainly not controversy "", the specialist thinks that we are keen to highlight"" what is the real news for us "": to know that they exist weaker variants of Sars-CoV-2 ""may also pave the way for the development of attenuated vaccines against Covid-19"".

The differences found in the genetic sequence of the good variant do not surprise Caruso: ""I expected it,"" he says. ""I expected there to be a number of variations,"" of the 'novelties' in the viral RNA. “Very significant differences - he recalls - we had also identified them in other strains, although not modified in aggression, which we are studying and on which we will publish together with Massimo Clementi of the Vita-Salute San Raffaele University in Milan. Pure Massimo Ciccozzi of the Campus Bio-Medico in Rome confirmed to me that he had seen many interesting changes. There are at least 7,000 known in the world ""and"" anyone who knows about virology - points out the expert - knows that coronaviruses have a high mutation potential "", because"" they make mutation a strong point to replicate and propagate "".

Now it will be a matter of understanding ""the reason for these mutations, which are important for the pathogenicity of the Covid-19 agent and how widespread they are"". But future research may also help enrich the Sars-CoV-2 ""family tree"". In epidemiological jargon we speak of ""phylogenetic trees, groups within which neighboring viruses are classified, similar to each other. The new coronavirus appears to have differentiated very recently from its other ""cousins"" and ""falls into a separate phylogenetic tree in which it is alone"", at least for now. A tomorrow, in fact, for Caruso it is not excluded that the 'branches' of his tree can be populated with “other very very similar coronaviruses. Close relatives ”, hopefully not 'explosive' like their breadwinner. ""We'll see"".

President Siv-Isv reiterates how the least bad variant of the new coronavirus was ""a lucky find, possible thanks to an exceptionally high viral load buffer for this epidemic phase"". But can it be assumed that other swabs, those ""with too low a viral titre to allow isolation and complete viral sequencing"", may actually contain this good variant too? The question is legitimate, Caruso confirms. ""In the past - the expert reasoned - the analyzes carried out have all concerned very virus-rich swabs, performed on patients who received the strongest insult from Covid-19, experiencing greater aggression. So we found similar viruses to each other. ""


In other words, somehow so far ""the analysis has been distorted"" by a technical limitation which at international level has led scientists to ""select"" and therefore to see ""probably the most aggressive variants"". Now, however, ongoing studies on the Brescia block could ""open new windows"": managing to identify specific key points of the viral genetic sequence, ""with different methodologies - the specialist predicts - we will be able to venture hypotheses on the basis of the sequencing of small fragments of the virus "", discovering elements"" that could approach our isolate or possibly others that will emerge in this moment of so weak viral circulation "".

Finally, the vaccine perspective, or the idea of ​​also reaching Covid to ""future attenuated vaccines such as those that are used effectively for example against measles or rubella. Knowing that there are attenuated variants of Sars-CoV-2 "", therefore"" that we have the potential for its attenuation - says Caruso - means that one day we can hope to develop an extremely attenuated viral variant, so much that it can be used as a vaccine "". From research on the virus, the weapons to win it.

[],,TenYearsTenDays,,,[],,,,text,t2_1xpuupza,False,True,[],"Oh yes, you are totally spot on. As a long time environmentalist, it's a pattern of behavior that is *extremely* familiar to me from back when I used to argue with climate change deniers. In fact, i was very very unsurprised to learn that many [who downplay coronavirus are also climate deniers](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/climate-science-deniers-downplaying-coronavirus-pandemic), and [that big oil has funded lockdown skeptical voices](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/21/groups-fossil-fuel-funding-urge-states-reopen-amid-pandemic) (and those are the types of people that often back the Swedish strategy). 

That said, sometimes (often!) the projection is unconscious. This happens in those who are genuinely in denial. And you are right that these often do not have the capacity for rational argument. There is awareness on some level that if they engage in it, they might end up having to change their minds so they very angrily reject it and opt for personal attacks instead. 

But it it sometimes projection is a purposeful tactic, employed to smear one's opponent with what one is actually doing oneself. When someone accuses another person of being a ""paid troll"" unprovoked, for me that's a giant red flag that *they themselves may be a paid troll*. A favorite tactic of the propagandist is to ""accuse the other side of that which you are guilty"".  

Back when I first started speaking about this issue, many accounts with very similar attack patterns were accusing *anyone* critical of Sweden (not just me!) of being ""paid trolls"" or ""russian trolls"", etc. These ridiculous accusations have actually become a bit of a meme on the r/Sweden megathread esp. now that the tide is turning.  After noticing this pattern, I looked into the posting history of those making said accusations and saw that in many, many cases the history was quite possibly in line with accounts that have been bought and sold in that it had a large gap in between the last time it had been used, and then it *only* posts on this issue after reactivation. I wrote a [bit about that here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/gjk7nw/swedish_health_minister_we_have_failed_to_protect/fqln86a/)

It's *fascinating* since this is exactly what we dealt with with climate change deniers: true believers that the earth was cooling who were deep in denial mixed in with paid trolls who were there to help foster that belief. It was often impossible to tell which was which, which is the same here. I am quick to say we can't know for sure what's going on here, but there are some red flags around. 

&gt;Often, the goal is to goad you into responding in kind. They know that people like you that are interested in discussion and debate will not simply report them and will try to address their accusations. Then they keep escalating, hoping to make you angry enough to violate a rule.


Oh yes, you are right this is *definitely* what they want. I truly want to engage in civil, rational debate and have stated that many times. But even if they start that way, they will escalate to personal attacks nearly every time. For a while when the harassment was at its worst they did get under my skin, but I've redoubled efforts to try to be more unflappable of late. 


&gt;Then they run to the mods with reports, knowing that the mods don't have the time to read an entire comment chain to see whether the angry response was actually justified. You get banned, they win. That's how these kinds of people work.

Yep, they have taken to mass reporting and mass downvoting everything I submit and comment on. Thankfully I've been a long term poster here, who has in the past a few times hit the 10/day submission limit on other topics (and probably passed it a few times before it was implemented) so anyone paying attention knows I'm just a huge nerd who spends a lot of time on corona, and became fascinated with the specific subject of Sweden for various reasons, not whatever they accuse me of being. 

&gt;It's one of the oldest disruption tactics on the internet.

It is.

SARS-CoV2 is very easily transmissible, YES.

Is it very deadly? No.

Everyday we find out more about what makes young people vulnerable. But the fact is that 50% of deaths in the USA have occurred in nursing homes. And less than 1% of Americans live in nursing homes.

The virus itself is normally mild, or even asymtomatic. The people who die of COVID-19 die from an immune OVER reaction. A very recent theory proposes that most deaths are caused by undiagnosed mast cell activation disorders (MCAD). If MCAS accounts for even half of the deaths, it would make this incredibly easy to render harmless to almost the entire population, as the treatments for MCAS are basically over the counter allergy medicines like allegra, claritin, zyrtec and Pepcid, and some prescription allergy meds like montelukast and cromulyn sodium.",,1591286745,{},fsvf205,False,t3_gw2vjw,False,True,t1_fstlp9n,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gw2vjw/a_mother_of_four_died_after_coronavirus_spread/fsvf205/,1591288181,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Judging by the comma in your percentage in several post in this thread, I'm gonna guess you're European and probably not Italian or one of the other countries that has been hit really hard, probably one of the countries that handled it well. I'm American and we desperately need this vaccine because too damn many idiots are still going to the grocery stores and everywhere else without masks or anything. Unfortunately our president has been pretty useless in handling this. I am glad he closed all of the borders and international flights as quickly as he did, but he really could be a better role model about wearing masks and trusting the quarantines to protect us. His supporters tend to be the ones that dont believe masks work or are infringing on their rights and are screaming to reopen as cases are skyrocketing around them. If he would publicly endorse masks (and not just wear them when the cameras are off)  and other safety measures the cases would plummet quickly. 

My parents and grandparents are all high risk due to health conditions, my sister in law is pregnant with and due soon, and I have a 3yo niece. There are so many close high risk people in my life I'm terrified of getting any of them sick. I do the shopping for my parents and split shopping duties for grandparents with other family. I wear gloves, a n95 and then spray my self down in disinfect and and use hand sanitizer after loading the groceries, then I wash every item when I get home to clean it before it comes inside the house. I do the same with any mail. I just dropped off groceries to my grandparents 2 days ago and I constantly worry about them and my parents. I would gladly take the shot and I know they are also eagerly waiting for it so we can finally have a somewhat normal life again.

I get my flu shot every year, even last year when I knew they had missed the mark on guessing which stains of the flu would be prominent. It still provides at least partial immunity.  The big difference between the flu and covid is that you don't have nearly 2 weeks of being asymptomatic but still potentially spreading it. You are generally contagious with the flu once symptoms appear, not so much with covid.  You or I could potentially be infected right now and not even realize it until symptoms appear and by then we've exposed dozens, maybe hundreds. We have a long history of fighting the flu and at least have some medicines that help with it, we don't have that with covid.",,1591290838,{},fsvnu9g,False,t3_gwfmpf,False,True,t1_fsvgogx,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gwfmpf/nih_director_some_vaccine_candidates_will_be/fsvnu9g/,1591293466,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

I'm also worried about the upcoming vaccines. I found the federal register doc I mentioned previously; 84 FR 49935 from 2019, an executive order that states that a task force is established to evaluate flu vaccines and specifically cites the use of chicken eggs for vaccine development as basically outdated and vulnerable to supply chain issues (??? Because we never have enough chicken eggs I guess, but really it's because of egg allergies that some people have that may have increased prevalence). There have been several flu vaccines used in the market the past few years, and Flublok was a newer one approved towards the end of 2019 I believe, which is a recombinant type. I also see a few thimerosal free flu vaccines listed as well!

If you look at the CDC's annual flu testing data for the past few years, it really seems like the seasons are vastly different each year, so there's gonna be some years where it isnt as effective as other years until they can figure out how to make a vaccine that can produce season-long antibodies for all of the common strains. Like we had a really bad 2017-2018 season, and looking at the CDC data, it looks like testing produced mostly influenza A, on average ~70-80%, and of those tests, the vast majority were H3N2. Then the next season was almost all A strains, but split about even between H1N1 and H3N2. And then this season up until they stopped tracking due to covid, we had about 50/50 split between A and B strains, and the best majority of A strains were H1N1. Kind of neat to see it change like that haha, will need to look back further and see if it always kind of cycles like that. Maybe the official flu season is actually cyclical and last longer than a year! Anyway I'm guessing they weren't expecting such a variation in the strains these past few years and kept making vaccines based on data from the previous year!",,1591292418,{},fsvra4s,False,t3_gqewhv,False,True,t1_fsfxmty,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gqewhv/us_scientist_behind_groundbreaking_research_in/fsvra4s/,1591295572,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

During the lockdown there were reports of people going around everywhere in italy. Then google data came out and compared to other countries in lockdown people moved a lot less. Other countries including germany which is usually a good example of people respecting rules.

It sounds good for media to depict the stereotypical italian that is not respecting rules. On the other hand there is no news if average joe wears a mask stays in line, shops with gloves and comes back home.

What I see around is people respect rules. Meaning they wear masks even when they are not required (open air with the closer human being 10 meters/30 feet away).

I'm sure it is. did they decide to continue to pay other team personnel like physical trainers, etc? That might make a big difference.  

Some costs are home game related and some are away game related. Let me define a travel cycle as: ""A 7 day home stand followed by a 7 day road trip to 2 cities."" This is a minimum of 3 flights and 12 games over 14 days. Six of these games are home games, and six are away.  

[Transportation/Lodging/Food expenses](https://www.bnd.com/living/liv-columns-blogs/answer-man/article205452579.html): Absent any discount, ~$36,000 a flight is $108,000 per travel cycle for first class. Food per day is $100 per player on the road: ~$20,000. Buses: $6,000. Lodging: private rooms at approved hotels. Should be $30,000 or so per travel cycle.  

Stadium expenses: I'm sure 80% of the stadium staff won't be needed if there are no crowds, like ushers, gate workers, and food related work, [This guy](https://www.quora.com/How-much-does-it-cost-a-MLB-team-to-play-a-game) says $10,000 a game, so roughly $2,000 a day when reduced by 80%? That's $12,000 per travel cycle. This might be low. Some stadium costs like maintenance of the utilities and the grass are not reduced by a lack of crowds.  

Consumable equipment: Balls themselves are at least $720 a day. lets round to $1,000 for bats, gauze...  That's $6,000 per travel cycle.  

I'm coming up with $15,000 per game day. I'm not sure who pays the umpires...  

So we're talking roughly $1,000,000 for the owner's plan and $2,000,000 for the players plan for the entire season. I guess I'm surprised its that low. wonder if im missing something.

It is probably due to the fact that more of the confirmed cases are coming from people who have mild symptoms or no symptoms and those people have a lower death rate (and maybe some survive longer before dying).

Could also be there there has been a recent rise in cases that precedes a lagging rise in deaths.

Also, where does the generator go? What about for those that live in apartments? At my center we have a huge diesel generator that, in theory, will keep us going for a week if the power were to go down for that long.

Another thing is cost. My agency has around 120 full time dispatchers. We have about 50 consoles that are continuously used. Each one costs well over 10k dollars. So now you need another 60, since there is going to be one for each dispatcher. And what about trainee dispatchers? The estimated attrition rate for new dispatchers not making it through initial training is around 50%. So how do you do that? Set up a console and space at their house, only to a month later come rip it all out because they didn't make training?

It's boring, costly and takes time, we will only have  a conclusive answer in years. HCQ is not the easy-obvious-cure for the thing, this we already know. But since it has effects on the virus.

Not true re:the 80% that don't require hospitalization. ""Mild"" just means not hospitalized. We still don't have a good breakdown of which are truly mild in the vernacular sense and which are walking pnuemonia that while it may not require hospitalization is quite bad. 

We don't know what the long term effects are but many in the 20% that are serious enough to go to hospital will have long term or even lifelong disability, which is probably why the US military barred COVID survivors from enrolling.

And worldwide - in the vast majority of all cases - this is a disease which kills people who are very old *and* very ill. Lockdowns, face masks etc may well extend the lives of these people for a short time, but as most of them are already very old and ill - that's all it is.. a short amount of time.

That is not to be callous - that is the simple reality. 

And the flipside of that reality is that the many extreme measures which governments have taken will - without any doubt - cause more deaths by their very nature than the virus will.",,1591299795,{},fsw7as0,False,t3_gwhsh2,False,True,t1_fsw0t4g,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gwhsh2/finnish_govt_not_issuing_specific_face_mask_use/fsw7as0/,1591305165,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

If you think being outside where many are wearing masks is worse than being in a crowded bar...well I don't know what to tell you except you are very wrong.

\&gt; Yes because most of those 100k dead are 70+ year olds who were already sick..so the solution should have been to isolate them instead of putting everyone on lockdown.

Please explain to me how you isolate part of the community but not others.

How do these old people get food? How do they go about daily lives? Go to the doctor?

If no one else is self isolating or wearing masks then how do these old people do survive?  Get money?

What about people who live with old people?  Do they not go to work? Do they not live?  Who pays them?

Sure, self isolating old people would be great.  I've not seen how it's possible.

A Phase I/II clinical trial of the Oxford vaccine began in April in the UK to assess safety and immune response in over 1,000 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 years across several trial centres in southern England. As the vaccine trials move to Phase III a larger population is being enrolled consisting of 10,000 participants in the UK with AstraZeneca enrolling 30,000 particpants in the US. On 2 June, the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) approved the inclusion of Brazil in the clinical trials conducted by Oxford University and supported by AstraZeneca, considering 2,000 volunteers to be tested in the country. 

“The most important thing is to carry out this stage of the study now, when the epidemiological curve is still rising and the results may be more assertive,” said Lily Yin Weckx, coordinator of the Reference Center for Special Immunobiologicals (CRIE) at the Federal University of Sao Paulo Unifesp.

“We are delighted to be working with the talented team of investigators in Brazil on the COVID19 vaccine trial, as researchers and scientists around the world collaborate on clinical development work with unprecedented urgency to combat the global threat to human health that is coronavirus.” Says Professor Andrew Pollard, Chief investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial at Oxford University.

Although the university is advancing fast on its ongoing response to address the unprecedented challenges of COVID-19,  it is working with AstraZeneca to define next steps on the supply of the vaccine widely to make it accessible around the world in an equitable manner.  The agreement includes a commitment to make the vaccine available on a not-for-profit basis during the pandemic and to ensure broad and equitable access around the world. To achieve this, Oxford University and AstraZeneca are collaborating with a number of countries and multilateral organisations, including organizations in Brazil to address local needs. Brazil is a priority for the study because of the ascendant curve of the COVID-19.

To date AstraZeneca has concluded agreements for at least 400 million doses and secured total manufacturing capacity for 1bn billion doses of the Oxford vaccine.""",,1591300667,{},fsw971s,True,t3_gwovj6,False,False,t3_gwovj6,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gwovj6/brazilian_health_regulatory_agency_approves_trial/fsw971s/,1591306293,10,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

&gt;	Unlike in the US, **e**thnic groups in China can always enjoy an equal test and treatment during the outbreak and their safety and health are a priority of the local government, said **h**uman rights experts.

&gt;China has always stressed rights protection for vulnerable groups, providing basic hygiene facilities to under-resourced communities, and caring for people who have a higher risk of being infected with COVID-19. 

&gt;Analysts said such care was evident in China’s strict measures reaching out to the most remote and impoverished areas in the country where the medical authority has sent experts to Southwest China’s **Ti**bet Autonomous Region, for example, to enhance **bo**rder administration and avoid imported cases from neighboring countries.

&gt;Village committees constantly promote the importance of virus prevention, sharing written and audio materials in **Ti**betan language through WeChat. 

&gt;When the situation improved, they visited the herdsman families in valleys, to give out medicine and share information.

&gt;The **Nati**onal Health Commission has sent batches of experts to provincial regions in Southwest China, including Yunnan, **Ti**bet and Guangxi where **mi**nority groups predominately reside. The experts helped each border port to make a unique strategy to decrease the risk of imported cases.

&gt;China saw very low infection rates in **et**hnicity areas including Northwest China’s **Xi**njiang **Uyg**ur Autonomous Region and **Ti**bet, which experts said is largely due to targeted pamphlets and videos promoting prevention measures with **et**hnic languages and cultures. 

&gt;Tibet only reported one confirmed case of the coronavirus, a tourist from Wuhan, Central China’s Hubei Province. 

&gt;Measures in **Xi**njiang follow a unified approach: patients are hospitalized for treatment which is case-specific at designated hospitals where medical experts and resources are assembled. In treatment, traditional Chinese medicine, including **U**ygur medicine, is equally incorporated.

&gt;In Northeast China’s Yanji, a **b**order city with North Korea, it is also common to see bilingual volunteers of university students participating in community screening, disinfection and material distribution.

&gt;Unlike American **m**inorities who are easily **discri**minated by some mask-phobic and **ra**cist people in the US, China’s ethnic groups have always been equally protected and respected, Du Fachun, a professor at Yunnan Agricultural University who studies the resettlement, told the Global Times.

&gt;The Derung ethnic people living along the deep gorges of the Dulong River in Dulongjiang Township, Southwest China’s Yunnan Province, is one of the country’s smallest **et**hnic groups that was lifted out of poverty in 2018. 

&gt;The ethnic group has been the envy of Myanmar’s **et**hnic **min**orities on the other side of the **bor**der for adequate food and free virus screening the Chinese government provided during COVID-19, Du observed in his recent visit to the township. “China’s **eth**nic policy is complete and comprehensive, which highlights its advantages especially in comparison with the US in the epidemic,” Du said.",,1591310280,{},fswt9iy,True,t3_gwrskf,False,True,t3_gwrskf,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gwrskf/chinas_ethnic_regions_see_far_fewer_covid19_cases/fswt9iy/,1591317304,4,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Confirmed and suspected covid hospitalizations went from 161 to 102 in the last 14 days, when it was over 300 in mid-April. 

Likewise, while testing levels aren't where they should be, it's increased dramatically since late March, and the daily confirmed infections are averaging at about 50 a day, which is the same as it was in late March... 

On top of that, over 3/4's of the new cases since May 15 are in Multnomah, Clack and Washington Counties, where Phase 1 reopening started the latest, and hasn't started for Multnomah at all. 

These headlines are getting fuckin ridiculous.

Still cant properly see out of that eye a month later and still a visible hole in my eyeball. Its a pretty serious and also obvious thing requiring urgent care but no chance of any help for love nor money.

2. I work in a care home and we have not had any COVID. The deterioration has been shocking to see.

* He has a tactic of calling everyone that disagrees with him and challenges him of being ""uncivil"" even if the posts themselves have no rudeness or impoliteness - just disagreement of opinion and challenge to his. 
* Then there is also the supposed ""harassment"" by ""russian-paid swedish trolls"" I believe was the theory that are downvoting his posts because they are under a ""mass psychosis"" for the situation in Sweden. 
* But if anyone suggests he is JUST a bit too focused on the subject to be okay for a healthy individual (or for a not-paid individual) it is smears. Even when he has bragged that he has 100+ bookmarks of various news articles about Sweden (current topic of focus) that he is slowly going through and posting on the sub. (I don't believe he is a troll, but I do believe he has an agenda or fixation)
* His post highlights will only show one part of the article, a very negative one if it is about Sweden's government, strategy or situation, very positive one if it is for its nordic neighbors immediately followed by a negative comparison to Sweden. 
* He likes to use other redditor's opinions as sources and anecdotal claims, rarely uses first-hand high-quality swedish media, rather goes for Aftonbladet and Expressen or a snippet from omni, more rarely DN, i guess the free-access articles are more difficult to get there since it requires subscription.
* He would ask for sources on everything, and even when the source provided is official site or the video from the official press briefing with subtitles in Swedish, usually it isn't good enough. Has to have subtitles that can be easily translated by a browser translator. He recently took this as another mark against Sweden - that it isn't providing the press briefings in English.
* Often official sources and raw data are not good enough to trump the interpretations and opinions written in newspaper articles - even when presented with the data and asked to look at it for himself, he refused to do so ""trusting the experts"" from his sources instead.
* When asked for sources, he ignores and moves along or provides low-quality ones and when challenged with their quality starts to evade the subject - goes into defensive mode that the discussion is being uncivil for example. 

At this point personally, I am trying to avoid direct contact, but I got to address some of his misinformation or misrepresentation comments. Cause it just ain't right.

For some perspective, here is the CDC guidelines

In cases where a definite diagnosis of COVID–19 **CANNOT** be made, but it is suspected or likely (e.g., the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty), it is acceptable to report COVID–19 on a death certificate as “probable” or “presumed.”

In order to believe this theory you have to believe that there is an organization that is seeking to make humans extinct, it makes for a great movie but it’s not realistic. 

Look, I feel for you, corona virus is scary and it’s easier to think there is a large conspiracy than it is to admit that we have no control. If someone is in control of it all then it can be controlled. But it’s not.

You’re making a choice. You are choosing to ignore the very clear scary things about a virus. Even though a small percentage will die from it, it’s still scary. Believing conspiracy theory with no sources and no science behind it is a bad choice. Spreading the misinformation about a global vaccine conspiracy is a bad choice and only serves to scare others.

&gt;Despite her best efforts, LeClerc has not been able to get a test, but “every doctor I’ve spoken to says there’s no shadow of a doubt that this has been COVID,” she said. 

So she says.

&gt;Yet support groups on Slack and Facebook host thousands of people like LeClerc, who say they have been wrestling with serious COVID-19 symptoms for at least a month, if not two or three. Some call themselves “long-termers” or “long-haulers.”

People who say they have been wrestling with symptoms.

&gt;I interviewed nine of them for this story, all of whom share commonalities. Most have never been admitted to an ICU or gone on a ventilator, so their cases technically count as “mild.” 

Have any of them actually tested positive?

&gt;Even though the world is consumed by concern over COVID-19, the long-haulers have been largely left out of the narrative and excluded from the figures that define the pandemic. I can pull up an online dashboard that reveals the numbers of confirmed cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and recoveries—but LeClerc falls into none of those categories. She and others are trapped in a statistical limbo, uncounted and thus overlooked.

The reason why they are ""uncounted"" is because they have not tested positive.

&gt;Some have been diagnosed through tests, while others, like LeClerc, have been told by their doctors that they almost certainly have COVID-19. 

But none of them have tested positive.

&gt;It “has been like nothing else on Earth,” said Paul Garner, who has previously endured dengue fever and malaria, and is currently on day 77 of COVID-19. Garner, an infectious-diseases professor at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, leads a renowned organization that reviews scientific evidence on preventing and treating infections. He tested negative on day 63. He had waited to get a COVID-19 test partly to preserve them for health-care workers, and partly because, at one point, he thought he was going to die. “I knew I had the disease; it couldn’t have been anything else,” he told me. I asked him why he thought his symptoms had persisted. ""I honestly don’t know,"" he said. ""I don’t understand what’s happening in my body.""

Notice he never actually tested positive.

This is an article about a bunch of people who are sure they have Covid, yet have never tested positive. Somehow their mysterious condition continues to affect them much longer than people who do actually test positive.

&gt;As many people reported “brain fogs” and concentration challenges as coughs or fevers. Some have experienced hallucinations, delirium, short-term memory loss, or strange vibrating sensations when they touch surfaces. Others are likely having problems with their sympathetic nervous system, which controls unconscious processes like heartbeats and breathing: They’ll be out of breath even when their oxygen level is normal, or experience what feel like heart attacks even though EKG readings and chest X-rays are clear. These symptoms wax, wane, and warp over time. “It really is a grab bag,” said Davis, who is a co-author of the Body Politic survey. “Every day you wake up and you might have a different symptom.”

Not sure how that failed? No hospital ran out of ventilators and budget wasn't really an issue anywhere. PPE was a failure, but PPE is talked about at the end of the document and there is no playbook there outside of the stockpile, which was used. 


&gt; page 31 - ""while states hold significant power and responsibility related to public health response outside of a declared public health emergency, the american public will look to the US government for action when multi-state or significant public health events occur

I think the most important thing here is the first sentence. Yes until Fauci/Birx were made figureheads the press conferences were a joke, but there's not really a lot of evidence there wasn't coordination nationally behind the scenes. I think this is an example of Trump trying to be a figurehead and failing vs. actual coordination failing.

&gt; page 36 - early coordination of risk communication through a single federal spokesperson

Agreed. 100%. Pence actually wasn't bad, tbh, minus the mask thing but that was later on. 

&gt; page 44 - are there approved drugs....if no,should the US purchase available drugs? 

When did they try and steal drugs? 

&gt; page 44 - working with affected countries to place restrictions -

I disagree here a lot - Barred people who had been to China within 2 weeks from entering, one of the first to do so. Barred travel from the Shengen Zone pretty early. Should've banned travel from Italy way earlier, but no one did.

Remember how big a deal it was when they barred travel to the Shengen Zone? It was somewhat unprecedented.

&gt; page 44 - screening for illness at ports of entry --- yeah this is still not happening very well

Because it isn't really possible, testing takes hours, they barred travel instead. This is part of the playbook. They did poorly with Italy, really poorly, before they started banning travel.

&gt; page 44 - redirection and coordination of resources as necessary --- i rescind what i said about stealing, apparently that's okay

Yeah if FEMA wasn't distributing the masks they ~~stole~~ bought on the tarmac I guarantee there'd be huge news stories about them. I think they were late to the game with masks, but they also shot themselves in the foot sending millions of masks to China.

There's also a bit that mentions testing to see if it was a labmade virus. Like of course they followed that one to a t! 

&gt; page 45 - (on the topic of non pharmaceutical measures) dismissal of schools, cancellation of large public gatherings, widespread use of personal protective devices --- still not happening at a federal level

Realistically it's not possible to do at a federal level, it's a state level decision - considering the speed at which states shut down schools I'd say there was decent coordination, outside of the DeBlasio vs Cuomo pissing contest. 

Them trying to host the convention is monumentally stupid, and I think they could be better about their opening message - safe, distance, masks, etc - but from a policy level I think the US did good here. We're seeing now even the worst of states are managing to open potentially safely. It's a weird country.

&gt; examples of a president belittling the virus, being a ""cheerleader"" instead of a truthteller,

Agreed 100%. They should've realized that freewheeling during press conferences was bad. Status update, promising message, hand it over to Fauci and team. This was a big failure to me.

I think they did a decentish job of reacting and getting things going, I think they did a horrific job at relaying the severity. This is mainly on Trump, but Fauci was saying things like it was super low risk deep into March. Just don't say probabilities guys.

&gt; none of that is in the playbook so again, more proof the playbook wasn't followed.

I think you have to separate Trump from the Task Force.

That’s the range the site gives you by default.

A spike has a distinct meaning. It means a deviation from normal. You’ve mostly described the standard progression of the virus. Starts out low then increases exponentially. Each week has more cases than the last, yeah. But a spike is something like 1 or 2 standard deviations from normal. In most of the month of May the average number of daily cases is around 150. Towards the end of May and into June it’s around 225. It’s still in the same ballpark. If there were 1000 cases per day, then you’d have a spike. But the numbers are so low that any aberration, especially after the lul in the middle of May, looks exciting. But smoothed out, thee is an increase, but the question is, is does that increase deviate away from normal. I’d say no, given the virus is not contained in the US. The progression in the number of cases will increase until the virus is contained, or it runs out unimmune of humans to infect.

If there was a spike the cumulative case count further down in the page would have a distinct hump in it. It doesn’t  have that hump. It just has a linear increase.",,1591238548,{},fsthmmb,False,t3_gw66qu,False,True,t1_fstgb68,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gw66qu/utah_is_seeing_a_statewide_sharp_spike_in_covid19/fsthmmb/,1591245793,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Canada is looking to participate in phase III clinical trial of Ad5-nCoV. Correct me if I'm wrong but are not the three phases of clinical trials exactly what constitutes ""properly tested""? In that case that's circular logic isn't it? Ad5-nCoV is not yet properly tested true, because Phase II trial is still in progress and Phase III trial has not yet started in Canada. When they are all completed and assume the result is good, then the vaccine candidate will become ""properly tested"" and graduate from vaccine candidate to a vaccine ready for mass deployment.

I don't know enough about vaccinology to say weather or not China is a world leader. But the fact of the matter is they have five vaccine candidates undergoing clinical trial as we speak, that's fully half of the global total, and the one with the furthest progress in terms if testing is one of those five.

Also another fun fact: Ad5-nCoV is a recombinant adenovirus vector vaccine, just like the Oxford ChAdOx1-S vaccine. Although the two vaccines target different serotypes of adenovirus.",,1591239847,{},fstjtmi,False,t3_gvzx37,False,True,t1_fsti3id,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gvzx37/the_global_race_for_a_coronavirus_vaccine_could/fstjtmi/,1591246944,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Not only is it just too much equipment and expense to be able to feasibly bring home, it's a huge security risk that they couldn't afford. Plus if there was any connectivity issue or a dispatcher's/operator's power went out it would send at least one frequency dark.

Regular phone operators or non-emergency telecommunicators can be done from home with much less hassle.

Evolutionary rates are dictated (largely) by generation time and genomic stability. A 4 % change in genomic identity in a short period is perfectly reasonable given how rapidly viri replicate and the fact that they're under a whole new set of selective pressures in the human body. 

&gt;And pangolian isnt the intermediary species.

Bats with an some intermediary are the most likely vector. The pangolin was cited because the virus generated very similar changes to the RBD domain in that particular strain. 

&gt; Anything is just a theory at this point until they prove otherwise and a lab accident seems just as likely as any other way of transmission 

They address this in the letter. It's not impossible, but it's certainly not ""just as likely."" All of our current evidence points strongly to a natural source and subsequent zoonotic transfer. 

&gt; ""In theory, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 acquired RBD mutations (Fig. 1a) during adaptation to passage in cell culture, as has been observed in studies of SARS-CoV11. The finding of SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses from pangolins with nearly identical RBDs, however, provides a much stronger and more parsimonious explanation of how SARS-CoV-2 acquired these via recombination or mutation""

&gt; ""The acquisition of both the polybasic cleavage site and predicted O-linked glycans also argues against culture-based scenarios. New polybasic cleavage sites have been observed only after prolonged passage of low-pathogenicity avian influenza virus in vitro or in vivo17. Furthermore, a hypothetical generation of SARS-CoV-2 by cell culture or animal passage would have required prior isolation of a progenitor virus with very high genetic similarity, which has not been described. Subsequent generation of a polybasic cleavage site would have then required repeated passage in cell culture or animals with ACE2 receptors similar to those of humans, but such work has also not previously been described. Finally, the generation of the predicted O-linked glycans is also unlikely to have occurred due to cell-culture passage, as such features suggest the involvement of an immune system""

&gt;Our findings show the presence of viral elements within endothelial cells and an accumulation of inflammatory cells, with evidence of endothelial and inflammatory cell death.

Ok. So there is that.

But then ..

&gt;These findings **suggest** that SARS-CoV-2 infection facilitates the induction of endotheliitis in several organs as a direct consequence of viral involvement (as noted with presence of viral bodies) and of the host inflammatory response.

And ..

&gt;In addition, induction of apoptosis and pyroptosis **might** have an important role in endothelial cell injury in patients with COVID-19. COVID-19-endotheliitis **could** explain the systemic impaired microcirculatory function in different vascular beds and their clinical sequelae in patients with COVID-19. This **hypothesis** provides a rationale for therapies to stabilise the endothelium while tackling viral replication, particularly with anti-inflammatory anti-cytokine drugs, ACE inhibitors, and statins.

Thousands of Thai citizens are stopped from traveling to Sweden for seasonal agriculture in the summer.

The country's government is worried about the prevailing Swedish corona situation - something that is likely to hit hard on the berry picker industry.

- It is a critical stage right now, says Ulf Hagner, CEO of the berry and jam company Blåtand.

Together with representatives from a number of large carrier and wholesale companies in Sweden, in a letter to the Thai Embassy in Stockholm, Hagner tried to reconsider the decision.

""We have ongoing correspondence to clarify how we work with our routines to make them change their attitude if possible,"" he says.

The letter includes measures to prevent the spread of infection, but also financial guarantees in cases where people become ill. The hope is that a new message can come as soon as possible.

- It is a very short time before the season starts, but there is still a possibility if a quick decision is made, says Ulf Hagner.
#""It's about survival""

Last summer, the Migration Board granted work permits for 7,200 foreign berry pickers. A large part of these came from Thailand and many Swedish companies depend on the labor force from the country.

But in a written directive, the Thai Ministry of Labor recently ruled that Thai pickers should not travel to Sweden or Finland this year due to the spread of the countries.

A decision that can be disastrous if it is not reviewed, says Sylve Björkman, CEO of forest berry supplier Ransäter Invest.

- A lot of companies will go bankrupt. The industry almost stands and falls with Thai pickers, says Björkman.

- We will not receive a fraction of the volumes during a normal season. It's about survival for the entire industry, he continues.
Calls for state aid

Ulf Hagner is in the same line.

- It would be a tough blow for the whole bear industry. Normally, Thai citizens pick around 80 percent of the Swedish berries, he says, calling for government support to resolve the situation.

- It would be a great value to many, says Hagner.

According to Sylve Björkman, a possible shortage of berries in the summer will eventually hit the consumer's wallets with higher prices in the grocery stores.

- There will be some berries but it will be expensive. Jam will be more expensive and strawberries until midsummer will be more expensive, says Björkman.",,1591277469,{},fsuwjrd,True,t3_gwhh8k,False,True,t3_gwhh8k,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gwhh8k/thailand_stops_berry_pickers_after_corona_worry/fsuwjrd/,1591277471,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Of course this is easier said than done, and Trump just wasn't thinking about that while getting impeached, which is..., well whatever it is things didn't work out well for any of us. 2020 has just been the right (wrong) combination of disasters.

Good morning. It is Thursday, there is news, and they are again today marked by the worldwide covid 19 pandemic. But not only.

We start with the dry figures, which in the Danish context develop so little that the experts find it difficult to say something wise about them, but it seems that the bathing season along the Zealand north coast has a little significance .
Today's figures:

Confirmed infected: 11,771 Hospitalized: 100

Hospitalized on intensive: 20

Number of dead: 580

Confirmed infected worldwide: 6,432,370

Deaths worldwide: 385,991

#More new infected in Skåne than in Copenhagen

Jyllands-Posten has taken a closer look at the Danish-Swedish border and asks the question: Is Copenhagen really harder hit by corona than Skåne?

The question is relevant because politicians on both sides of the Sound have used infection numbers as an argument for opening the border between the two regions.

The answer depends on the calculation method. If you look at the entire period of covid-19 infection in Skåne and the Capital Region, the Danish capital is almost three times as badly affected. **But if you look at the past 14 days, the picture is different, and Skåne is a little harder hit.** This will prompt Jan Pravsgaard Christensen, professor at the Department of Immunology and Microbiology at the University of Copenhagen, to warn against opening the border in the same way that the border with Germany has been opened.

“We must expect that guests from Germany will typically stay in a holiday home on the West Coast and thus pose no great risk of infection. Swedish tourists who come to Copenhagen - if they are allowed to do so - will gather for sights, places and cafes, go to museums and shop. All places where a lot of people come and where the risk of infection spreads is greater, ”he tells Jyllands-Posten here .

#The Corona crisis has been good for primary school

In Politiken, both an educational professor and SF have discovered that fewer students per student. teacher and fewer teaching hours during the corona crisis have actually been good for primary school. Therefore, SF is now proposing that the primary school be redone, again. This time saw the students being taught fewer hours. As during the corona crisis.

“We have now received the definitive proof that long school days do not work. There is a time before a vaccine arrives, so let's make a primary school with fewer students in the classes and more time for the individual, ""says SF's education mayor Jacob Mark.

#The students are allowed to celebrate the exams

The Covid-19 pandemic has been the youth's neglected spring. Deprived of schooling and socializing, the young people have had to find themselves in suspicion from Denmark's highest epidemic expert, professional director of the State Serum Institute Kåre Mølbak. As the tulips flourished and the trees burst out, Kåre Mølbak decided to say the following about the good youth of the time to DR :

“I know it's an age group that can sometimes be difficult to think about, but then they have to try to talk to themselves and their own conscience in relation to their responsibility to society. «

The character of the hard-pressed youth was recognized by the director of the National Hospital, so he defended the young people and praised them for their responsibility, and the same responsibility is now rewarded by a unified parliament that will allow the country's approximately 50,000 students to run around in horse drawn carriages, trucks and buses and celebrating the exam. With alcohol, well noticeable.

""For young people, student driving is by far the most important event, and it is therefore gratifying that the young people are allowed to set a festive mark for their education and, moreover, for a difficult spring in the corona's sign. It's so well deserved. Carriage driving is a great experience that you have only once in your life, ”says Pernille Rosenkrantz-Theil here .

AstraZenica is the sole international manufacturer of the Oxford vax, with the possible exception of the India based vax manufacturer who Oxford contracted with about 3 months ago.

The initial vax will go 300 million to the US, who has paid for all the research, 30-50 million doses to England, and I assume the next vax will go to Gates Foundation state designees.

AZ just recently expanded its subcontracting of vax manufacture to yet another smaller vax manufacturer.

Economics are a huge factor in getting this job done.  It's a win-win to the world to see the US funding this scheme.

By Oct/Nov, there will be possibly 30-50 million doses or even much higher.  By Dec/Feb, there should be the 300 million doses.

1. There was no means testing.  You didn't have to prove your business was impacted and there was no income/wealth testing on the actually business owners. So I am sure a pretty big percentage of those who applied stayed open anyway, and a nice chunk of the applicants were multi millionaires.  I mean Larry Kudlow's wife applied for a load and she is an ""artist"".  Jim Cramer applied for a loan for his restaurant and he is a multi millionaire who could have paid 25-50 grand in salaries out to take one for the team.

2. The salary limits were too high.  Why does the goverment need to pay someone 8000 a month to stay home and save the job?  No wonder Ruth Chris steakhouse applied.  Those waiters make really good money and we paid them 40 bucks an hour to stay home.  It would have been better, for the taxpayers, to just put them on unemployment.

3. There is zero oversight.  As it is the IRS has gutted the audit department.  i can;t imagine the level of fraud knowing that banks and the government have no audit structure in place

4. No one is going for the loans because the grants were easy money.  it should have been subsidized - like pay half the salary so the business owners keep skin in the game and are less likely to apply frivolously.  

5. the loans should have had conditions attached to protect customers and employees - like the requirement to supply masks to employees and the requirement for customers to wear them on reopening.  I'm looking at you airlines.

If people hadn't followed CDC guidelines or stopped following them now the deaths would almost certainly go up beyond 1 million in 1 year (2 waves because immunity period is short) even with a death rate of .26%, which is worse than any American disease outbreak ever with the possible exception of Native American smallpox outbreaks, even worse than Spanish Flu which was 675-850,000 deaths in 2 years.

Unlike boomers  millennials have not tried to make millennial into a slur.

[],,zonadedesconforto,,,[],,,,text,t2_3wu18stj,False,True,[],"&gt;Scientists are investigating links between coronavirus cases and high  altitude, after a study suggested that those living well above  sea-level were more resistant to the virus than lowland dwellers.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bolivian  researchers are seeking to understand why La Paz, the country’s capital  at 3,600 metres above sea level, has suffered relatively few virus  fatalities, while its low-lying second city, Santa Cruz, and the  surrounding province have been hit hard.  
&gt;  
&gt;One reason could be that  those living at altitude have developed a resilience to the low levels  of blood oxygen that the virus can cause — a condition known as hypoxia.  Mountaineers who are not acclimatised to oxygen-thin air can suffer the  same problem, but people who are used to living high above sea-level  have adapted.  
&gt;  
&gt;“At sea-level, when people get coronavirus and their  lungs get destroyed, it is as if they are climbing Mount Everest in  just a couple of days, without oxygen,” said Gustavo Zubieta-Calleja,  director of the country’s High Altitude Pulmonary and Pathology  Institute, one of the authors of the study published in the journal [Respiratory Physiology &amp; Neurobiology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7175867/).  
&gt;  
&gt;But  “the low rate of infection in Bolivia’s high-altitude population is  remarkable and clearly does not follow the often exponential infection  rates reported in many countries”, concluded the scientists.  
&gt;  
&gt;The  Bolivian team is one of thousands around the world who are racing to  understand a virus that has officially killed more than 369,000 people  and how exactly it affects the human body.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr Zubieta-Calleja  suggested treating virus patients with erythropoietin, a naturally  occurring hormone that stimulates the growth of oxygen-carrying red  blood cells, which some athletes use to improve performance although it  is now banned in professional sport. When people move to higher  altitudes, their EPO levels rise as the body responds to the oxygen-thin  air.  
&gt;  
&gt;But others urged caution and warned against drawing firm conclusions too early and promoting unproven treatments.   
&gt;  
&gt;Andrew  Luks, professor of medicine at the University of Washington, said that  while the proposed link was “intriguing”, it “by no means establishes  that high-altitude residence or high-altitude locations are protective  against coronavirus”. EPO was also linked to an increased risk of blood  clots, he added.  
&gt;  
&gt;A paper responding to the original study pointed out that during  previous pandemics, such as the 2009 Mexico flu outbreak, “high altitude  residence was linked to more adverse outcomes”. Another response said  it was premature to draw any conclusions without further interrogation  of “social, demographic, risk factors or health variables”.   
&gt;  
&gt;Limited  testing capacity in Bolivia means the true infection and death rates  are not fully known. According to official data, La Paz and its  surrounding area have 507 confirmed virus cases and 28 deaths. Bolivia’s  other highland provinces show similarly low numbers.  
&gt;  
&gt;By contrast,  Santa Cruz, 400 metres above sea level, and the surrounding province  have 6,711 confirmed cases and 149 deaths. The province is home to 15  per cent of Bolivia’s population but accounts for two-thirds of its  virus cases and almost half its deaths.  
&gt;  
&gt;A similar pattern can be  discerned in Ecuador, where the centre of the virus outbreak has been  the port city of Guayaquil. There have been far fewer cases in the  capital Quito, which is roughly the same size but sits 2,800 metres  above sea level.  
&gt;  
&gt;Outside South America, the Ethiopian Highlands  have registered few cases. The country, with a population of more than  100m, has recorded 1,257 cases of the virus and 12 deaths. Nepal, home  to eight of the world’s 10 tallest mountains, has 1,811 cases and eight  deaths.  
&gt;  
&gt;But there are exceptions to the rule. Colombia’s capital Bogotá,  at 2,600 metres above sea level, is home to about a fifth of the  country’s population but accounts for a third of all its coronavirus  cases.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Bolivian team also suggested another reason why the  virus had not spread in its capital: ultra-violet light. Sunlight is a  natural sanitiser and ultra-violet rays are particularly strong at  altitude. “This virus floats in the air but here in La Paz it gets  blasted by UV light,” Mr Zubieta-Calleja said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ewan Eadie, head of  scientific services for photobiology and optical radiation at Ninewells  Hospital in Dundee, Scotland, said that while this was partially true,  the UV rays would only have a germicidal effect on the virus if they hit  an infected surface directly. Anything in shadow or in enclosed indoor  spaces — where scientists think most people contract the virus — would  not be affected. Windows also prevent the sanitising UV rays from  getting through, he added.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sunlight was “definitely not a sort of magic pill” against the virus, he said.",,1591287707,{},fsvh3bd,True,t3_gwk9ni,False,True,t3_gwk9ni,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gwk9ni/scientists_probe_link_between_high_altitude_and/fsvh3bd/,1591289412,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

The WHO was lying to the populace because there wasn't enough PPE to go around. 

Later studies showed that they were more effective than we thought at preventing infection and much more effective at preventing spread - homemade masks protect you, but they protect others from you to an even greater degree.

We knew from the beginning masks were provided at least some protection. Why do you think doctors were rushing to secure PPE? Do masks only protect doctors and not the general population? You are buying into a line of bullshit.

Once again, everyone knew masks provided at least some protection from the very start. It is common sense. The WHO and CDC flat out lied to everyone so they could secure PPE for medical personnel.  If you are going to lecture me on science provide data.

Because honestly .. I am seeing *very little* solid evidence about a lot of the claims being made about Covid.

This is a far right lie, imo. I was unfortunately one of the loud/driving voices behind this narrative on social media early on because I was legitimately concerned but got calmed down by the involvement of the Health and Social Care Inspectorate and the fact that they increased the transparency of their reported numbers. At this point there's nothing to indicate that there's been systemic neglect and only the far right and a bunch of people they've managed to scare still clings to this narrative.  
  
As for the lack of preparations in the elderly care it's just awful but they've at least admitted they didn't take into account the many immigrants working there (speaking different languages, coming from different educational backgrounds, etc) and the for-profit culture that had developed in the privatized sector and that it was a blind spot to them. It's really stupid and naive but hardly malicious. And countries with much more stringent oversight in these areas haven't been spared so it's doubtful what measures could've been taken. The decline we're seeing not only in Sweden by around the world is probably an effect of the weak dying first, which happens in every flu or cold season, albeit not on this scale due to the greater number of susceptible hosts.          
  
Personally, after initially being very critical I am now really happy we didn't allow this thing to get as politicized as it has been abroad and that cooler heads prevailed. Yes, it's been a rough ride and will continue to be so but Tegnell &amp; co kept our curve under capacity and the IFR did turn out to be almost as low as they predicted, certainly not anywhere near the 4%-5% that caused the lockdown hysteria. And their main critics predicted deaths of tens of thousands by now, which is obviously not the case.   
  
Whether other countries do better remains to be seen but the more we've seen of the unpredictability of the spread and the infectious nature of the virus, the more it seems unlikely that they aren't just pushing the inevitable ahead of them. If it was really that easy to track and stop the spread then why didn't the countries who banks on this didn't do so initially? If the lockdown works why aren't they staying in permanent lockdown instead of opening up and moving closer to our model? There still isn't a cure or a vaccine in sight so it seems highly unlikely that they'll get more favorable outcomes, given the same number of infections. This is seasonal now - like the other coronaviruses that constitutes ~15% of all common cold cases and includes things like deadly pneumonia, kawasiki disease, etc - and whoever gets spared now will catch it sooner or later and will have a similar outcome, barring a cure or a vaccine (which isn't available for any of the other coronaviruses, afaik).       
  
Overall, I think we got it right. We're just in the unfortunate position of being used as a political bat by the far left on the other side of the pond and by the far right on our side of the pond. There's a ton of emotion and very little evidence. And I'm happy we're able to resist that. The riots in the US for example I see as a natural consequence of the pressure cooker that is a hardline lockdown. It's a ticking time bomb.

Nerve palsy’s/inflammation are somewhat common in viral infections. It’s possible olfactory nerve may get invaded by the virus, but we are not really seeing CNS infections with COVID 19 (I.e. no encephalitis caused directly by a viral attack on the brain). There have been some case reports of encephalitis due to COVID19, but it still seems the virus generally does not infect the brain.  It is probably more likely that there is so much inflammation in the nasopharyngeal space that it compresses the branches from the olfactory nerve, which basically blocks its function and your ability to smell until the inflammation subsides.

Much of the pathophysiology and progression of COVID is based on the location and prevalence of ACE2 receptors. The virus uses ACE2 receptors to enter human cells. In kids for example, almost all of the ACE2 receptors are in their upper respiratory tract with few to no in the lower, which is likely why they don’t tend to get severe infection. This changes with age. ACE2 receptors are also found in higher concentrations the gut and kidneys, which is what can cause the diarrhea often seen early in the illness and the acute kidney injury.

But then there are also effects from the over-activated immune system, which causes its own set symptoms. The hypercoagulability may be a result of the immune response or a result of a direct effect of the virus, and it is unclear if the blood vessels are primarily effected or the blood products or both.",,1591296610,{},fsw0eud,False,t3_gwjck1,False,True,t1_fsvw7yg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gwjck1/dream_street_singer_chris_trousdale_dies_of/fsw0eud/,1591301092,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

 [https://github.com/adamaltmejd/covid/blob/master/src/functions.R](https://github.com/adamaltmejd/covid/blob/master/src/functions.R) 

How this code works is that it looks for the point where there are three consecutive days were the number of deaths that are added is below a threshold, then marks that date as ""finished"".

So, if there are 4 days of no deaths being added then suddenly a dozen deaths are added, they will not count because the date is already ""finished"".

That last comment shows that the code can be falsely triggered simply because deaths are not added during a three day period, even when more deaths will be added later.

The code even captures its errors:

* **Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced state's second phase of reopening, Wednesday**
* **Bars and movie theaters will be allowed to open their doors at 50% capacity**
* **South Florida counties excluded from plan**

 

Bars and movie theaters across Florida will be able to open their doors for the first time in almost three months, according to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' second phase of reopening. Missing from the plan, however, are South Florida counties Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach.

At a news conference at the NBC Sports Grill and Brew in Universal Orlando, DeSantis said the plan would go into effect this Friday.

**Both bars and theaters will be able to open at 50% capacity, while restaurants can now allow seating at bars.**

**Gyms** will also be able to operate at **full capacity.**

During the second phase of reopening, individuals who are 65 or older are recommended to stay away from large crowds of 50 people or more.

While South Florida will not be included in the initial reopening date, county mayors can still send a written request to the governor asking to be added.

""Miami, Broward, and Palm Beach may seek approval, have a plan, submit it through the mayor or county administrator,"" DeSantis said. ""They're on a little bit different schedule.""",,1591307857,{},fswof4b,True,t3_gwr7qg,False,True,t3_gwr7qg,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gwr7qg/florida_gov_announces_phase_two_of_reopening/fswof4b/,1591314721,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Factors such as race, ethnicity, gender, and income, in combination with discriminatory attitudes, result in some groups of people taking the brunt of the pandemic to a disproportionate degree.

Emerging data show that in the United States, the COVID-19 pandemic is disproportionately affecting black and Latinx people, with some data indicating that [American Indians, Alaska Natives, and other ethnic minority groups](https://www.kff.org/disparities-policy/issue-brief/low-income-and-communities-of-color-at-higher-risk-of-serious-illness-if-infected-with-coronavirus/?utm_campaign=KFF-2020-Medicaid&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=87589305&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9ly9q6s_OMV22LCNVhznokIJcKXR3rwfKr83J8PtcmGxQjzFsCwa9MDWInk5xk1t6K2dEQDf84CVOUi_nJfE5novlsnw&amp;_hsmi=87589305&amp;stream=top) are also exposed to higher risks of serious illness from the new coronavirus.

A recent analysis that Yale University researchers led, for example, found that black people are [3.5 times](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.07.20094250v1.full.pdf) more likely to die from COVID-19 than white people in the U.S. and that Latinx people are almost twice as likely to die compared with white people.

Furthermore, a recent report by the nonpartisan APM Research Lab found that in the U.S., black people are [2.4 times](https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race) more likely to die from COVID-19 than white people.

In this context, we spoke to [Tiffany Green, Ph.D.](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nuAG4XUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao), assistant professor in the Departments of Population Health Sciences and Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, about racial disparities in healthcare during COVID-19, as well as what steps are necessary to correct racial bias in the COVID-19 response.

With health economics and health services research as her primary interests, Prof. Green’s previous work has tackled topics such as the relationship between income disparities and co-ocurring chronic health conditions, racial disparities in access to healthcare, and the role of feature-based discrimination in driving health disparities among black Americans, to mention just a few.",,1591307810,{},fswoboz,True,t3_gwr71x,False,True,t3_gwr71x,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gwr71x/a_nowin_situation_expert_weighs_in_on_covid19/fswoboz/,1591314669,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,

Germany's approach is similar, but infected do not have the possibility to voluntarily hand over their phones, They are being interviewed by contact tracers.

Also enforcing the quarantine: we have government employees checking on the quarantined in person. They visit them at home, they have to show their ID, step back, remove the mask and show their face.

florida doesn't report overall hospitalization just daily, so there's no way to track total hospital stay or current census as far as i can tell. they do report an overall total of 10k out of the 60k positive tests and similar positive percentage rates week to week, so we could make at least a rough guess that 1/6 positive cases will end up in a hospital. that's surely not accurate though, so hopefully one day they start reporting overall

(Because they have never tested positive. So they are not included as cases of Covid)

&gt;They also suggest that the true scope of the pandemic has been underestimated, not just because of the widespread lack of testing but because many people who are getting tested are receiving false negatives.

That entire article is a bunch of poppycock.

Where a new and deadly virus is concerned, I listen to the doctors. I listen to the scientists.

I'm disappointed that the media and politicians aren't talking about the virus more but frankly I think they're afraid. Saying mass protests should stop because of the virus is NOT a popular message right now.

It doesn't change the reality that a deadly and highly contagious virus is still out there and ignoring social distancing is one of the best ways to spread it. That's science.

The OP from the Danish article provided the following translated quote:

&gt;The analysis shows that the lock-down of Denmark during the Corona crisis has been so costly that society pays approx. four times as much to save a corona patient's life-year, than we would normally pay to save life-years of other patients. For example, cancer patients, who need an expensive, life-extending treatment. 

&gt;... 

&gt;""In the Danish health care system, we have to treat the citizens the same, and we are not do this when we prioritize spending so much money on Corona. You could have saved more lives by spending the money differently. Other patients, which now will have to do without expensive treatment, may rightly feel discriminated against.""

Epic is extremely shitty as a launcher as it's underdeveloped. Many games like KCD don't launch there and there are many issues and bugs you can read about. 

My own game I had there encountered technical problems there, until I tested it on Steam running perfectly fine to this day. 

Epic lacks a myriad of features Steam offers, such as a Modding workshop, streaming, friends list, neutral review system not bought by publishers etc

Epic doesn't even have a shopping cart ffs!

Reason is because Tim Sweeney invests all this Fortnite money into bribes to buy developers and fragment the pc market by holding games hostage. 

Furthermore he explicitly said in an interview that for Epic the customers don't count and only developers and publishers do. 
 It's anti-consumer even on paper.

Other concerns are with the involvement of China, aka Tencent companies owning Epic almost half. Plus theres been leaks of security issues where its likely your data is being sent on to Tencent, the Chinese top game consolidation. 

Also beware on r/totalwar not to criticize Troy or Epic too much because like I said, the Mods are bought and have personal stakes in Troy. So they will ban you like they did to me.

 It's blatant corruption and power abuse.

Here we go with more boomer nonsense. 

I know plenty of people that graduated with a liberal arts degree that is doing great. In my state, you can teach with any college degree. Some countries will allow you to go there and teach English as long as you have a college degree in something. When I apply for a job (no degree) and they apply too (degree), they are more likely to get it. So many jobs list a degree as a qualification. It doesn't even matter what the degree is in. You just need it to be qualified for the job. 

Don't ever let anyone tell you education is a waste of time. It is not. My grandfather use to tell me ""get a degree. Education is important and it can't be taken away from you."" He was right. He worked manual/trade jobs for years. That was the only job he could find without an education. They are hard work. 

You can believe whatever you want. I know from PERSONAL EXPERIENCE not having an education/not going to college is a very bad idea. Even my friends with Art History degrees have more opportunities than I do. They could get a job teaching if they wanted to. A nice job with benefits. I can't. I am stuck working minimum wage jobs. 

&gt; degree without prospects is worse than no degree

 In February WHO models predicted that COVID-19 would spread to up to 70% of the human population and kill 56 million people without social distancing. Then WHO's death rate estimate was increased to 3.4%, this would indicate 185 million deaths. Except that that the actual number would have been much higher than that, because if 5 billion people get sick and 10%+ have to be hospitalized then the health care system is going to fail. Without any treatment at all for the vast majoritybof people the death rate would go way up, you'd have hundreds of millions of deaths. The CDC estimates were 2.2 million dead in the U.S. even if the death rate was a fraction of what it appeared to be. All this would have had severe geopolitical repercussions, it basically would've been an apocalypse. 

All this in four months. In four months. Now, it's June and it's been nearly four months. With global social distancing we've seen officially 385,000 deaths worldwide, or 1.3 million by the highest estimates. In the U.S. there have been 110,000 deaths, or 170,000 by the highest estimates. Relative to what could've been, this isn't severe at all. This is a new virus, and it's far more contagious and about 10 times as deadly as the flu, which already kills 20-70,000 Americans per year.

Immediately from the title you find it looks only at supply-chain effects on the economy and not other ones: ""Global supply-chain effects of COVID-19 control measures""  
Here's the abstract:

&gt;  
Countries have sought to stop the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by severely restricting travel and in-person commercial activities. Here, we analyse the supply-chain effects of a set of idealized lockdown scenarios, using the latest global trade modelling framework. We find that supply-chain losses that are related to initial COVID-19 lockdowns are largely dependent on the number of countries imposing restrictions and that losses are more sensitive to the duration of a lockdown than its strictness. However, a longer containment that can eradicate the disease imposes a smaller loss than shorter ones. Earlier, stricter and shorter lockdowns can minimize overall losses. A ‘go-slow’ approach to lifting restrictions may reduce overall damages if it avoids the need for further lockdowns. Regardless of the strategy, the complexity of global supply chains will magnify losses beyond the direct effects of COVID-19. Thus, pandemic control is a public good that requires collective efforts and support to lower-capacity countries.",,1591229175,{},fst0uqx,False,t3_gw5qoq,False,False,t1_fst0c3n,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gw5qoq/stricter_lockdowns_are_better_for_economies_new/fst0uqx/,1591236823,7,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],,,
