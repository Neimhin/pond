Haha. [After Tennessee fired chief vaccine don’t much hope them. Thankfully didn’t mutate variant early. friend caught covid late September. spread family his. Everyone households fully vaccinated. idea it’s spreading unvaccinated households false. would shut down? company's policies. required federal local law everyone masked. private office. 9th per capita last check, ~22nd last wave. NY 5th now. impressive thing Florida playing catch-up time vaccines many treatments available. bulk New York deaths within 3 months start pandemic still learning. Florida could saved many lives are. Yep, Starbucks barista thought becoming CNA Florida. Realized I'd actually take pay cut. I’ve seen statistic shows vaccination rate police whole vs general population, although wouldn’t exactly fair comparison demographics police don’t exactly represent population (skews younger male) still report governor assume.  way boss. 2200/min Florida

56,413 deaths Florida according worldometers, population 21.5 million 2620 deaths per million death toll likely twice amount reported. deaths = scared people spending money prop economy. Quantitative Easing’s premise given illusion wealthier are. can’t give illusion give correct death toll pandemic. likely 1.5-1.6M deaths already. god damn shame sad come this...and it’s still over. sunshine cause skin cancer heat stroke. :)  ray sunshine. happens videos emerge police beating shit black family trying eat dinner? say...I’ve seen every walk life spout BS I’ve saying since new variants would less deadly. evolutionary pressure so. “fear mongering” buzzword cognitive dissonance could throw deny evidence chance wrong. Low behold, turns getting education reading scientific articles important Facebook posts anti-intellectual. Ridiculous become everyone past year. claim heart damage. Absolutely. believe seems natural immunity may wane quickly article linked mention infected don’t even develop detectable antibodies! second paragraph people ones wondering nobody wants work now. think would fall on? Also sue.  probably seeing dollar signs.  FWIW… Pharmacists “change” peoples medicines prescribed. call Dr. dumbass say “patient allergic med / taking contraindicated medication. really trying kill patient ?”

Then doctor changes prescription.

Source: Ohio doc prescribed something wife would BAD NEWS. Pharmacist caught it, called doc there. Med changed.  ^ This. Generalized incompetence misinformation. Focusing vaccine misinformation pure theater fail miserably.  Meanwhile...they keep votng Politicians do! covid shots volume flu shots.

Also person you, 3 shots available US kept fridge temps extended periods time till vial punctured, like flu shots.

I'm condoning pharmacist course, easy mistake make. Pharmacies understaffed that's nicest thing say majority companies treat staff run pharmacies above.

Edit: highly unlikely pharmacist injected undiluted pfizer, suppose anything possible. got first pfizer dose yesterday feeling occasional, rather dull kind pain heart. Chest feels heavy + acid reflux. wonder see doctor Germans sure took lesson heart America got lucky neighbors it’s unlikely advice taken like last year double peak Christmas thanksgiving assume fraction pediatric cases accounted due testing kids asymptomatic- therefore, would guess calculated risk would far lower what’s listed above. knew vaccine mandates wouldnt mean shit. means even sheriff isnt going shit it. Definitely get vaccinated, immunity wears time, too. Going get regular boosters while, likely. Yeah people totally would risk minimum wage job bringing knife work Two weeks later: risky. Dont go there. degenerate scumbags sentenced life solitary! sure either, administration wrong medicine wrong dosage (as acceptable dosage) seems like malpractice me. That's specious reasoning shows lack awareness Taiwan's geopolitical challenges. want define border restrictions Taiwan's lockdown, fine. Though, would probably ideal clarify mean initially. I'm sure many people would necessarily define lockdown way. 

Taiwan extremely isolated geopolitically: point diplomatic representation Somaliland major victory. Taiwan also works hard maintain international recognition allies Pacific Carribean student exchanges, development projects, etc. Taiwanese government likely trying take advantage countries' largess promote world stage. know smart move show good light make potential PRC invasion look cruel unreasonable. also partly goal ""Taiwan Help"" campaign donating masks PPE diplomatic allies nations.

Yes, right would better donate vaccines poorer countries need clearly greater. We're probably running geopolitics again. vaccine donations show support Taiwan trying ward potential Chinese invasion, like USA's. reciprocal, like Poland Lithuania's. Japan's donations mix both, Japan's affection Taiwan. Taiwan colony Japan. 

Further, Taiwan crucial creating computer chips. United States nations already struggling getting enough chips electronics before. would significantly difficult world supply chain outbreak Taiwan escalated point hard lockdown enforced. nations know donating vaccines Taiwan also prevent stresses global supply chain.

Last, Medigen going produce 5 million doses 2 shot vaccine 2021, population 23.4 million. supply likely ramped 2022 Taiwan completely vaccinate population. That's Taiwanese government also bought vaccines Moderna, COVAX, eventually got Pfizer-BNT vaccines too. knew would bottleneck Medigen's vaccine authorized wider use. government also started purchasing vaccines Medigen vaccine still trial phases. uncertain whether vaccine would successful. several promising candidates locally produced vaccines. Medigen's found safe produce strong immune response. We're going outdoor Halloween party (vaccinated guests only). Feeling pretty good it, especially cases dropping rapidly city.

We really know next wave come, think try enjoy left stressful year.  one commented fact TN state government might able legislate medical board can’t that.

I’m wondering play all. Seriously, lot people seem believe flu bad cold. flu awful. started getting flu vaccine regularly, vividly remember absolutely wiped it, totally unable find relief. Even sleeping, thing could do, miserable. he's putting vaccine/microchips candy. know what...im stop getting mad obviously strategy tinker type operation. Send message allow economics proceed things get back tamper areas.

THE issue even thoguh message giving matching. fear mongering TV Fauci's public messages. shame! *will they're afraid people getting sick - they're afraid shut down. Yes. Covid stay.  numbers up, wear mask.  Get vaccinated.  Shame....It really blows mind shame advocate activities could spread virus time....like fine stop beeching TV then.. read ""Targeted Individuals"" recently similar. Somehow social media push engagement automated systems fanned flames latent psychosis people may have. hint interest brings flood similar ""secret"" posts.

 antivax conspiracy people think there's overarching plan kill people found grown larger similar way.

 also, people seem pretty dangerous crazy. can't get vaccine reason, worried catching vaccinated spreader?

Most people are.  anti-vaxxers spreading others concern can't get vaccinated.  worry vaccinated loved ones well unvaccinated idiots. anti-vax people got vaccinated joined vaccinated people, presumably much closer getting mess. Oh God! That’s awful! I’m sorry experience. 

Halloween favorite holiday, hate a-holes like decide Halloween free pass cause havoc. small kid, teen smashed pumpkin painted. know it’s thing, relate feelings taken advantage losing bit faith humanity. :( politics reversed, police would problem enforcing mandates upside head.  don’t want vaccine cares long can’t go anywhere infect people? GOOD! Bad bot. Reality reality. would loved could get rid another time tried eradicate delta failed. People lost tolerance strict lockdown (no major uprising rules started bent sometimes broken). got illegal gangs spread across regional boarder controls, past police, obviously don’t want traced. People people. Vaccine mandate law. policy, nobody goes jail violating policy. want law talk local state reps.  unconstitutional hell, never stopped CA before. said took Ivermectin u get dumbass takin animal Ivermectin think thier human consumption.  Could also taking cardiologist found preexisting heart condition. genetic one would make sense kids it. dosing could also since person giving shot thought flu vaccine may make heat issues likely. another possibility heart issues common think resolve cases people don’t go looking never noticing them. countries like Finland New Zealand seen massive outbreak decided delay second dose more. IANAL plaintiff would still suffered damages harm result defendants violation standard care. Maybe could claim mental harm something, don’t know. Yeah, people unhappy corrected called sloppy facts. personally agree, that's real world. city refuse enforce misdemeanor street crimes, especially look homeless.

And actual laws! ""common sense"" Dr. Fauci had, would pretty crummy chief medical officer.

Thankfully, also expertise, take precedence ""common sense"" odds. would argue live it. Keep strict border control, let people live inside country. 
But minority opinion. understand people value flying another country simply living day day lives. We've enough time families reunite make long term decisions, could contain build better solution.
In meantime, much love! doubt it, administered wrong medicine injected them, pretty open shut negligence. I'm sure getting vaxxed, look pictures adults say ""other"" first dose, children dont qualify vaccine.

If children given accidental dosage medicine would sueing negligence also. 

Is dosage flu vaccine even Pfizer? vaccine mandate law, like policy. Nobody going court take vaccine. still black white. true subset viruses. absolutely true virus kills quickly, immobilized spread much. Ebola best example think - within 24-48 hours either stuck bed already dead. took 3x longer disable you, would much harder contain. 

BUT, people misunderstand it, means golden rule. look actual characteristics virus looking at. Covid long period asymptomatic spread, followed weeks illness leaves people still able function semi normally. nothing gain becoming mild everything gain ramping quickly spread, Delta variant something like 1200x higher viral load phase covid spreads. And, top off, time covid kills typically even virus left - people die weeks in, they're longer contagious. 

So really like biologist said something that's true large carnivores, bunch people came along started applying herbivores. Clearly biologist moron, right? People carry knives time... fools would get program get jab.

With attitude we'd still worry poliomyelitis among myriad diseases either eradicated pretty solidly control. Thank you! new us. lucky far learn live it. Best wishes :)  limitation test? maybe failing detect new mutation? Yes, recall reading reputable sources, &amp; thought scientific mistake discussed played role among decision well. Coming state people panicked hit 2%, still kinda horrifying  done that, pre-covid, middle school student (who thought wearing school baseball uniform carrying bat qualified costume) walk away entire stash, including bowl. caught threatened hit bat almost took out. realizing could went jail a-hole made realize desire participate Halloween.

Thanks, explains lot seems like reasonable response. I'm sure lot people would happy keep strict border control live day day lives (and I'd support thing, living endless lockdowns promise normal future) ultimately government can't go citizens even make sense.
It makes truly sad even attempt global zero covid approach. feels like celebrity jeopardy moment. “Despite best efforts, numbers dropped.” That's true: there's sociology built epidemiological models. problem lot public health directives seemed made without much input sociologists, therefore much less effective could been. impression physicians make bulk public health officialdom, they're well equipped think sociological issues.  call mission accomplished NZ quite yet. 

NZ eventually open fully, numbers go substantially due lack nature immunity can't/won't vaccinated. ever Peru? Probably not, really accurate either. well documented masks known effective. government lied public order protect limited supply PPE healthcare industry. understand motive, change fact public lied to.

The point give example dangerous give supreme authority determine misinformation organizations inherently political. saying silver lining? bad doctors lose licenses. think lot people dont know pharmacist.  know. We'll hearing new things covid fucks years. also OK go get it... Everybody needs social distance, care covid going away anymore. vengeful employee fixed dashboard broke fired. overlap map counties voted Trump appears nearly perfect. medical definition fever 100.4F. temp generally 99s evening normally.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah, feel like anyone supportive generally spaced outdoors events wasting time point, probably even line general reality situation. think say certainty. Since Thanksgiving 2020 402 million Covid vaccine doses given US we're currently averaging 1 million day. also looks like they're going start vaccinating kids 5-11 early November. 28 million kids age range make spreading harder. lot people also antibodies Covid well common prior Christmas last year.  asked Anti-S OBs office happy it. getting antibody panel anyway prenatal things perhaps that’s didn’t mind. However, warned use number assumption protection lack protection long others vaccine. Probably single dose helping out. Glad helped. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

A lot people neurological effects COVID honestly didn’t know meant “after quarantining COVID”, sorry, mistake Thank you! 5 years dealing specialists flare ups symptoms due post-viral syndrome. Many doctors dismissed even symptoms severe couldn’t work, cook, leave house etc. really looking forward research would come Covid, hopeful would help us already struggling post-viral syndrome. Okay, doctors encouraged order Anti-S? thing is, paper recently posted science sub showing Anti-S antibodies detectable way longer Anti-N COVID, someone unable vaccinated wants test previous infection would likely better full panel antibodies would think. I'm Alabama I've go GP couple times since COVID started. told times need wear mask public. told second time people die vaccine ""real COVID"" told pediatricians known liberals, ""even they're pushing vaccine children. they're always first push unnecessary vaccines people tell something.""

I wish he'd lose license.  dumb. patient take elsewhere.

I addressed this. like million pharmacists. Find one suck.  Youtube links might work better, change start time relevant portion: relevant portion) fly despite vaccinated according flair? protected? pattern anymore big event cause outbreak. like Nov-Dec random date. 

It's entire country flying coming together.  course going cause peak. ones still fixated risks associated wearing masks caught wind one yet   Stop what? Telling truth thanksgiving Christmas families spend significant time together fly country cause covid outbreak?  It'll spread like crazy Jan probably good chance end mid next year family get together die down. Vaccines help lower spread prevent getting covid. Especially vaccines given year ago almost. can’t keep anymore ..first it’s waning bad it’s waning ok. saw effects India earlier year. Idk people surprised. Poor man's tilt free takes 5 minutes docs still downplays numbers do. That's way go Pheonix Down, 1500 gil.  haha! friend I’m afraid that’s possible. Blue pill red pill? Historically every pandemic typically dies two years. six months away two year mark. vaccines children couple promising treatments, history looks repeat again. 

Hopefully. explain torsion way make cringe? want google it. happen? Similar Idaho. Can’t wait kids told take fucking masks trick treating drunk asshole Depends type nurse. They've expanding definition wildly. two year trade schools push nurses barely able put bandaid spend half shift working MLM side hustle trying bang surgeon. nurses could handle running small ER like DNP APRN basically doctorate graduate level program.

I'll let guess side spectrum anti-vax yes peak.  Remember 2000 deaths day really bad. 2000 deaths day average today.  1000 deaths day last month. still really bad.  difference way form vaccines people taking fast enough. 

People look trends go - 50% less hospitalizations! 50% less deep shit. still plenty shit left. Hospitalizations 0 beds available. Deaths arent lag behind. 

 Trends looking great ease trends lead long term results. Trends trends working.  stop trends stop. want 1k deaths day normal. Cases still ratio hospitalizations death. Even changes due vaccines worth knowing, even - ideally - ratio hospitalizations cases decreases. leading indicator worth tracking. Look Japan, S.Korea, China telling people (based science) point time. 
 
I dont believe access information, excuse beyond calculated deception countries' people told masks work. Good intentions pave road hell. best brightest people making call advising nations, consistent message spread throughout countries told masks work... better dont know.... soft pedaled mask recommendation encouraged home made improvised face coverings? 
 
&amp;nbsp; 
The trust lost, fear run masks would helpful contemporary push convince unvaccinated get vaccinated.
  
...like mattered, still run masks anyway. episode public health advisory utter failure  Good them! Now, pay worth. Autonomic nerve dysfunction crazy stuff. nerve problem one legs (CRPS) it’s fucking awful. turns bright red reason. hurts (often badly) reason. turns freezing cold touch reason. I’ve done bunch medical treatments, take nerve medications supplements offer help, use compression gimmicks, fix nowhere near close developing one. nervous system poorly understood doctors treat things hard find. 

And sadly can’t fix since can’t grow new nerves even could dispute nerves problem (some argue it’s brain misinterprets input instead nerves sending faulty data). Basically medical condition ends Syndrome poorly understood. may know rough causes treatments, really don’t know specifically body it’s makes hard fix. studies vital load severity? delta deadly increased initial viral load advancing disease faster staying ahead immune system? Yes can't really compare case numbers last year right almost half country vaccinated, drastically reduces chance hospitalization death. 8 months 2nd shot 86% protection symptomatic infection 90+ percent hospitalization.

This good true? Let speak plain terms... countries disparate political structures whose governments advised people use face coverings. 
 
The whole ""don't wear masks, work"" something advised bunch governments whose people media cross-pollinate, largely across America's, EU, English speaking countries downstream USA Western EU influence. 
 
Ex. 
   ""Could"", ""would"". fact debate absolute shows double standards favoring. saw article snake venom laughed absurdity. Didn’t know people *actually* requesting 🤦‍♂️

Incredibly frustrating people can’t even learn lesson even able breathe… hope sound like believe you. absolutely believe happens.

I basically told techs expected get vaccine within couple months didn't, probably fit work environment. also let know would happy answer questions might anything. Every one got first opportunity happy that. Well, would it, wouldn’t it? Maybe that’s it. read Moderna shot like 3x volume Pfizer shot. assume similar concentrations little mRNA nanoparticles.  I’ve gotten point Reddit come comments, scroll upvote first person said exactly going say. Didn’t scroll far. thumb thanks you.  Hahaha! awesome, thank you, needed that. two pharmacists know worked another location years ago, vaccinated. also spreading misinformation chance get. Knowing them, checks based views.

She also works techs vaccinated store. trying help them, however propaganda hold. disheartening good people, work hard know they're doing. trust vaccine.  


Thanks info though, good hear that. Hopefully one day, worry her. already survived cancer back 2014, want getting mess. want grow old her.  Yeah… get invaded enemy sweep kill bunch people, wouldn’t declare victory leave. US always declares prematurely.  Floridian.. suspicious. don’t think numbers lying since hospitals seem better like.. changed cause drop? Vaccination rates haven’t gone much. school districts still masks. It’s weather either it’s still 90+ every day. Football games look packed. Disney looks packed.

Neither vaccines prior infection provide sterilizing immunity. R0 high enough transmission asymptomatic (even vaccinated previously infected) keep virus sloshing population.

For us immunity (from vaccination, boosters, prior infection), pose debilitating risks.

Doesn't matter % rates there's way fuck want contract disease IFR always guess, one make educated one. need serological surveys, accurate statistics infected, hospitalized deaths.

I vaccinated. wear damned stupid annoying itchy ass mask bc I'm supposed to. use gallon alcohol gel hands time. preach gospel get shots, wear mask, wash hands.

I also go shopping. go vacation, twice last month. go restaurants. wore annoying mask 10 hours straight airport, plane, plane, back another airport 4 hour layover, onto another airplane delayed taking delayed landing loooooong airport hit glorious fresh air.


I know people Covid. know people, relatives died Covid. Went mandatory mask funeral family let sit bedside. None them, me, anyone went funeral contracted Covid.

I concerned Delta variant hitting kids. worry grandkids going school getting it. avoid grandkids quarantine vacations.

I best balance protecting family trying life despite plague refuses die out.

I lost respect CDC Fauci early Covid hospital staff taught lives wear one mask/one patient room/one time/discard told literally wear mask over, staple ties back on, wear til tatters. Protecting NO. ONE. patients. nurses. saw doctors refuse go Covid rooms. saw nurse's aides refuse go in. became nightmare abuse nursing staff throughout info CDC conflicting best evidence based practices even common sense.

Smh. take CDC grain maybe bushel salt. I'm also Russian. many people know traveled get western vaccine? know few, already vaccinated. Odd case enduring low-level viral load somehow failed sufficiently trigger immune response vaccine? sure CNS problems go away like perhaps inflammation pressing small nerves? There’s probably step missing person’s account things. wonder many people virus transmitted him? wonder many died? It’s precedence. science progresses learned, different protocols would implemented make step process produce valid outcome. Vaccines existed quite long time protocols definitely scientifically driven although government made “rules”. groups 12 eligible. trying clear.

It care. 12s vaccinated risk:reward ratio warrant it. 12s getting seriously ill, they're filling ICUs, they're dying.

I'm sure trying argue here. know well SF outlier US. Even then, we're talking measures place nationally. America Yo-yoing. developed world found steady pace. Southwest MI. Nobody wearing masks indoors, flabbergasted. Maybe age preexisting conditions. 99% average age groups combined. includes young kids 0.2% death less. need take class statics.If kids learned basics statistics epidemiology we'd better society. people going die.  Sure wish Japanese medical researchers would cum already  Literally Romans Phyrric war. arguments there. Yea based data looks like virus goes infectious cycles gets snuffed out. Also pcr values aren’t correlating plaque forming units capsid antigen based tests. adds idea vaccines decrease infectivity. 

The dead army refer inaccurate description. may ever army first place variant produces RNA pieces. specifically, sequence binds oligonucleotide sequence RT-PCR test. That’s accurately confirmed enough data. No, none ER docs (or docs) caught either. bad worst long Covid put heart monitor started paying close attention “randomly” racing heart happened.

The government try best protect high risk, advised get give protect yourself, vaccines. early days pandemic, billions dollars poured hunt novel treatments vaccines, veteran Silicon Valley entrepreneur Steve Kirsch he’s always done: went looking underdog. March 2020, he’d settled [funding] idea searching covid treatments pre-existing pharmacopeia. premise made sense: experts predicting vaccines would take years, finding helpful drugs known safety profiles could shortcut approval ...Kirsch’s reactions work he’s funded... He’s refused accept results hydroxychloroquine trial showed drug value treating He’s also publicly railed claims campaign drugs like fluvoxamine ivermectin... even claimed vaccines “kill people save” FDA public forum... know downvoted instead someone elaborating it. mostly right-some states collect federal government. CDC stopped collecting data breakthrough cases result death hospitalization back May. shit decision. One many IMO (denying covid airborne year-up May 21, masks work health care providers, etc) 

Some states collecting info, know know states collecting covid data (Florida... I'm looking you). draw direct conclusions breakthrough infections, experts noted, states would need collect report timely consistent data C.D.C.

Instead, state slices data set differently, different time frames, many still don’t record mild breakthrough cases directive C.D.C. May."" Missouri way. Virtually one masks. People cherry pick news want accept, denial animal-level, people across spectrum suceptible it. reason MO right MI we're dumber, overwhelmed sooner. 

The vaccines fade, people still himming hawing boosters pill whatever even death, probably get go ride us variant truly goes endemic.  true.  I'm sure people seem surprised this. 

Last year kids isolated danger. school plenty ICU beds resources it. 

We going see lot kids dying foolishness. Wow almost 50% serious condition??? tell coworker whose healthy 3 year old intubated earlier year still struggles walk also partially lost hearing. step recognition Covid-19 become endemic virus rest lives. Neither vaccines prior infection provide sterilizing immunity. R0 high enough transmission asymptomatic (even vaccinated previously infected) keep virus sloshing population.  us immunity (from vaccination, boosters, prior infection), pose debilitating risks. One vaccinates markedly lower risk severe infection, death long-Covid first encounter. transplant blood cancer patients, elderly, Covid could pose major fact life decades come. **We may seen peak life expectancy developed nations.**

My thoughts too. cumulative risk endemic COVID 20 years 70 extremely high. 

Vaccines helping lot, need new treatments prevention forms. 

I wonder possible create vaccines force virus mutate milder forms.   Yup. Look UK exact thing already waning. Media likes cherry pick daily. Is...hysteria actually still diagnosis? thought diagnosis primarily used gaslight women irrational. think that's fair, extent predicting behaviour hard, major mistakes warning mask use early people assumed would make people less cautious behaviour. think one could avoided. Yes, agree physicians, whilst obviously skilled, probably prominent discussions.  waiting inevitable TIL show feed Ah right eight daily five days. Still pretty frequent dosing.

The trouble, honestly, really good ability identify, say, ""moderate"" damage sort.

Historically, exactly keeping best tabs pandemics second half last century, that's really great place draw from...

Be honest, *you* actually trust federal government prior that?? spidey senses telling didn't...  seems like US rooted anti-government sentiments. Overseas less anti-government anti-semitic.

There's strong overlap this. lot anti-government conspiracy theories roots antisemitism. whole thing rich/famous people stealing chemicals children directly long-standing antisemitic conspiracy theory called ""blood libel"" example. anti-mask anti-vaxx school thought often pretty similar U.S. nations. believe rules employer plans bit different plans offered ""market place"" majority Americans still get health plans employers.

I've caught six colds year 6yo kid (none covid). it. gets badly sick, little brother (3yo). get run feel like crap need hundred naps, temps anything. takes weeks get viral lethargy invariably get, want parenting two children young. Oh look it’s r/enlightenedcentrism Covid19 this, enters central nervous system.

That known yet. possible area active study can't say like chickenpox herpes viruses (which well known this).

There's also large disparity recovery, people get ""long Covid"" symptoms many seem recover completely.

POTS suspected autoimmune disease often happens viral bacterial infection (other Covid). Schools following mask mandates shutting down. happen? I've gotten every year since kids pediatrician advised us get it. Maybe I'm lucky I've literally never side effects flu shot, become brainer me. employer usually day sign they'll bring nurses distribute them, normally go family instead now. less dramatic COVID vaccine, think good idea start getting flu shots annually can. 100% favor masks please come doctor say he's seen lot sinus infections/issues them. Obviously I'd rather take risk risk covid, masks without issues.  I’m sure saw logic, wasn’t any. mocking ignorance right saying thing people’s lives. nerve issues various breathing techniques help calm down. like Wim Hoff technique, others might also help. Anytime.  Waiting 5g. told would become biological 5g tower. Still reception. Costanza? Actually fuck of. ask people covid first wave. There'll information Friday, think. They're supposed discuss vaccine mixing. I'm boat are, terms J&amp;J. I'm blood clot age group even higher risk I'm pregnant. comes it, I'll get J&amp;J booster risk still small, I'd rather get mRNA booster. Pittsburgh even weekend high 70s. Haven’t seen much change weather past two months except slightly chillier nights, even so, it’s still comfortable hang outside (which we’ve doing) want go wedding catch Delta there, get dose least week before. want spread Delta there, need get dose 2 weeks before: one week build immunity another week case caught Delta first week. (Approximately.) Vaccines children way then, children continue masking following public health guidelines communities. Worrying factor it; let kids ride cars could die car accident make sure put seatbelt? blaming him.
I said maybe said anything backfired last time masks. you’re experiencing definitely seems like went Covid (also early case). One weird one keep forgetting mention: thought earthquakes weren’t, sometimes thought cat jumped bed hadn’t happened. wasn’t sensation *me* moving, rather everything else moving. husband check, no, wasn’t moving. usually feel cold happened, though.

A lot little odds ends dysautonomia symptoms, like many weird autoimmune disease symptoms. enough people studies something, may eventually get name.

My concern vaccine also downsides side effects like medicine right seems like benefits outweigh risks.

The concerning factor vaccine get longer trial period like vaccines encompass least couple years. vaccinate frankly vaccinating 4 year old kid another matter. Yes, that’s said. think we’re exact page! guess that’s I’m advocating for. Masking public places needed. Maybe avoiding risky gatherings, especially know unvaccinated people there.

People pretend like steps ‘living life’ alternative shutting basement.

Being empathetic hard work tho  Impressive study hard thing quantify antivaxx correlates many risks related cheerful stupidity. Thank info! 

How levels infection right now? (If mind asking.) comes behavior (NPIs) vaccination. Poorly vaccinated areas far likely see nasty outbreaks. outbreaks seeded driven mostly many people congregating unsafely (indoors, maskless, bad ventilation). can't wish, bargain, negotiate away. virus ""care"" anything except spreading; enough stop spreading (and, unfortunately, often wish think should), going keep spreading, period. dog taking think handle it

Though smart enough get shot I’m baby  Israel also *ten times* population density USA. Close India terms population density, overall human proximity much prevalent factor Israel. 

We also know Covid still spreads even vaccinated people, definitely spreads much less (1) viral loads sender reduced (2) recipient's immune system equipped fight defeat virus. 

Unvaccinated [by choice] people spread larger viral loads, increasing chance transmission, less equipped fight Covid, yes, unvaccinated people bear part blame. French, one. Maybe Britain seemed outlier believe article read masks Guardian. article seemed flat say Gr. Britain going let burn thru schools pose high risk hospitalization, etc, children.

Vaccinated adults, everyone outdoors, (obviously, Halloween) masks. really need looked closer into.

Definitely agree, worth mentioning *not* long covid created equal. Right defined one symptoms persisting X amount time (couple months, recall correctly). figure (19%) someone lingering cough would technically category another person neurological symptoms effectively disabled, even / none latter vaccinated.

At point societal threat imminent hospital collapse ignored pandemic end. point pandemic over, (in countries) COVID simply declared endemic. endemic disease circulates regularly population, causing low expensive public health burden. best examples flu (we flu season US tens thousands deaths winter, far public health burden COVID last 18 months), measles (which killed 1-5,000 children year started vaccinating it).

In medium term (*next* winter) we'll get idea long-term endemic Delta do. worst case scenario, Delta could increase annual respiratory-disease burden several-fold. medium-case scenario could less severe reinfections flu. best-case scenario it'll go way measles, vaccinations preventing measurable level spread. basically idea scenarios likely. people got J&amp;J want get second ""booster"" dose locked brand forever?

But every person died mRNA vaccination least 1000 deaths due covid. quarter half people recover covid shortness breathe months. 

If poke around probably pull names. reviewing one claim last week actually real. 'finally realised it'? Perhaps finally realised it? clear long time would combating delta completing vaccinations.  asking happen? cops go jail assault. 

If arguing simply accept society needs held back can't trust cops job can't reform anything, we're fucked matter guess mask mandates matter anyways. happened went away got Moderna vaccine, that’s worth. symptoms vaccine trials can’t tell many people told ‘mark beast’ and/or they’d pray me. Hail Satan.  ~~Could~~  saw billboard side highway said “Ivermectin doesn’t need booster”.

Sigh fully expected likely get higher coming weeks. opened restaurants, bars clubs last month masks distancing requirements, negative test vaccination required (but loosely enforced). starting see data come in. help understand. impact hospitalization/death? so, new percentages? not, would anyone care? duration? Remember, Florida’s raw data looks odd possibly manipulated. Forensic data experts investigating, we’ll know sure sooner rather later.  Surely ment ""Should"" ""Could"". Nowhere entire USA ever locked username checks thought everyone went winter  happened Melbourne Australia. Vax rates poised push 90% first dose soon protests affected zero policy change. loud minority low intelligence anarchists saying use boxer briefs use boxer briefs? That’s fair enough, there’s nothing wanted discuss anyway. never lied numbers before, so, guess trust numbers now, right. Awesome.  cares this? one. exactly vaccine misinformation? instance include citing non peer reviewed scientific research papers? telling people trials performed vaccine companies deemed unnecessary? Steven Kirsch.  recommended mainly order prevent spreading virus getting vaccination, distinguish side effects symptoms. already got shot worry. There's evidence unsafe ineffective.   Fauci discouraged outdoor activities? get can. Got mine recently, worries He's already backtracked. He's even defending said anymore. trying him? make sense impression danger Covid still running strong, even currently available vaccines

You're right still concern overall less vaccination (protection death vaccines still 90 percent range think). important thing remember funding US atleast country absolute minimum amount possible society mitigate threat unless throw literal bomb it. vaccines work well enough pay vaccines fast tracked? 

To clear think find agree fast tracked way however day job public health STD prevention got pretty shafted last year I'm holding Oregon saw huge spike vaccinated Covid deaths august, 23% remember correctly. thought Covid ops story meant fight, mutating enough lower effectiveness current vaccines

I looked cuz percentage really high expected. bit shocked entire pandemic Oregon ~6k deaths far. Given feel like super big concern perspective powers seems like states buckling harder restrictions try fight it. doesn’t make sense see light end tunnel.

Are they? feel like states much anything terms harder lockdowns New York City. Granted also go home work school I've bit loop extremely tired. Atleast nothing really changed since atleast May restrictions lifted I’m argumentative I’m trying wrap head around it.

No need apologize read comment argumentative all. Since long Covid happen mild infections research showing people mild breakthrough infections vaccinated lower chance long Covid? read, nope. may one reason many angry anti-Vax anti-Mask people there. Maybe nervous system disorder makes prone anger.  trickle? dude said 1 million day! Ok, interpreted defending Florida person Cuomo resigned guaranteed going removed office.  today. Went one arm, expect sore af tomorrow. Ok...I thought clearly implied usual flu season, current pandemic, likely nasty unvaccinated covid patients. in...covid weather component spread months going nasty northern half country. fine though. That's flipped flopped. think fast spray paint dissipates outdoors-- spray inside, stick around enough give headache days, gets absolutely everything. Outdoors, gone thirty seconds, tops. that's specifically made basically glue tiny particles things permanently. One pediatricians tried suggest Ivermectin 10 year old claiming side effects. longer one pediatricians... lose license. Experts news orgs piled obviously wrong point give new answer. pulled front cameras long ago sterile PR person gathering freely since usual flu season likely be...fucking brutal them.

Are kidding me? People gather *flu*? even covid? crazy. Science always evolving. happens misinformation ends becoming validated? Firing censoring answer 50% nurses nurses unvaccinated June physician vaccination high 90's. Even August still hit 90% nurses. We're probably getting close 100% mandates, I'd surprised actually small percentage giving bad advice. How'd results turn out?   Florida done fine job.  USA anything since founding. ""iT 99 pErCEnt suRviVal RatE!!""

I'm tired hearing coworkers, point things like stuff article, I'm mocked. asked different point though. everything going cool come Christmas fact covid cases dropping fast. said claim Christmas would great. Probably tendency use fact said condemnation said whatever want. 

However, fact covid bad also safe gather everyone vaccinated true. nearly consistent message since vaccine ""get likelihood serious, serious contracting disease low."" 

But believe whatever dude. read initial story criticism genuinely seemed like people wanting ways. also required, nature position, make recommendations unvaccinated Americans. gathering freely since usual flu season likely be...fucking brutal them. God bless!!   Feels like ""again"" tacked on.  findings article apply unvaccinated, vaccinated. study found that: equivalent Ct values, 60% samples vaccinated patients resulted successful cell culture. “He” = New York governor  told wait two weeks getting another vaccine got tdap two weeks covid dose two. per doctors recommendation. maybe that’s tdap vaxx. Bought account. quoting thing he's *already flip flopped on* me. quote posted came nonsense. Close enough. DR. FAUCI: Well, know, one things want make sure last weeks turning around acceleration this, starting come cases hospitalizations soon deaths. one thing want want become complacent say, ""OK, need pull back, need people get vaccinated."" need continue get individuals, 70 million people eligible vaccinated, vaccinated. look history, MARGARET, different surges we've had, come up, start come sudden boom, come back again. coming down, within capability, make happen. Namely go very, low level, vaccination mitigation. MARGARET BRENNAN: DR. FAUCI: that's one thing want make sure viewers realize we've done well sense getting 55% population fully vaccinated 64% least one dose. we've got keep pushing vaccination MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. said, ""Don't let guard down."" two new studies show COVID's gotten better transmitting aerosols, air. mean? We're going cold weather. We're going holidays. people need start looking around saying risky gather family members unvaccinated DR. FAUCI: Well, MARGARET, believe way CDC recommended situation dynamic virus community, there's clearly lot spread, even vaccinated indoor setting, congregate setting, makes sense wear mask avoid high risk situations. look ventilation indoor places. know clearly spread aerosol, something spread aerosol, absolutely want ventilation, reason outdoors always much safer indoors. indoors, ventilation going key. that's reason really paying attention MARGARET BRENNAN: gather Christmas, soon DR. FAUCI: know, MARGARET, soon tell. We've got concentrating continuing get numbers try jump ahead weeks months say we're going particular time. Let's focus like laser continuing get those- cases down. people getting vaccinated also situation boosters appropriate get people boosted know help greatly diminishing infection diminishing advanced disease, kinds data accumulating real even aware within hundred miles declaring victory yet.     20% population getting sick easily overwhelm health care systems. Fringe not, people dangerous ruining responsible majority. happens take vaccine covid? took didnt know   know likely outcome. least one government's top experts. that's he's since flip flopped.

""I encourage people, particularly vaccinated people protected, good, normal Christmas family"" Uhh nasal vaccines now? One specific old lady neighborhood diagnosed Covid earlier year second wave India 
She recovered since , early 70s 
Currently symptoms shown post recovery include difficulty holding air lungs , paranoia , mental fog , dizziness , vertigo early symptoms hysteria OCD
I believe study actually accurate 
And lady's one , past weeks lots patients similar background popping town Florida hasn’t reporting it’s non-resident deaths. know many snowbirds have?      Except explicitly fear mongering. asked everything would good Christmas, said know.      That's called unjustified fear mongering place coming government spokesman, much less supposed pandemic expert.

What's even point it? going scare people getting vaccinated, makes look bad gives ammunition argument government know they're doing.     wish could believe police going actually show anywhere calls 911 report mask mandate violation.

I think would work like that, would be:

1. Private place business
2. Person enters mask
3. Person asked put mask leave
4. Person refuses mask leave trespasser
5. Police called remove trespasser   Medicine expiration dates works testing. don’t set date thin air, it’s done test called accelerated aging. still takes time, manufacturer 2 pronged approach. They’ll submit early set expiration aging data clinical data, it’s approved market time, they’ll released second set aging data cooking time. that’s manufacturer’s often time extend product’s shelf life even releasing market.  Come people, yet organise go get vaccinated. We're pretty close getting without major outbreak!

They've said SARS-CoV-2, Ebola. see I'm black white fairly factual statements, around scientists thought viruses like SARS-CoV-2 90s still believe. point simply popular culture knowledge often lags 20-30 due ""common knowledge"" slowly updated.

And theory behind trying describe trade-off hypothesis supplanted avirulence hypothesis:

""Virulence evolution trade-off hypothesis: history, current state affairs weirdly overly aggressive things lightly understand though. Abstract

Background: US population-based data COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) 3 currently FDA- authorized products limited. Whether declines due waning immunity, Delta variant, causes, debated.

 Methods: conducted prospective study 8,834,604 New York adults, comparing vaccine cohorts defined product, age, month full-vaccination age-specific unvaccinated cohorts, linking statewide testing, hospital, vaccine registry databases. estimated May 1, 2021 incident laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases (weekly life-table hazard rates September 3) hospitalizations (monthly incidence rates August 31). 

Results: 155,092 COVID-19 cases 14,862 hospitalizations occurred. Estimated cases declined contemporaneously across age, products, time-cohorts, high levels beginning May 1 (1.8% Delta variant prevalence), nadir around July 10 (85.3% Delta), limited changes thereafter Delta). Decreases greatest Pfizer-BioNTech (-24.6%, -19.1%, -14.1% 18-49, 50-64 years, ≥65 years, respectively), similar Moderna (-18.0%, -11.6%, -9.0%, respectively) Janssen (-19.2%, -10.8, -10.9%, respectively). hospitalization adults 18-64 years across cohorts, without time trend. Among persons ≥65 years, declined May August Pfizer-BioNTech (95.0% 89.2%) Moderna (97.2% 94.1%). lower Janssen, without trend, ranging 85.5%-82.8%.

 Conclusions: Declines cases may primarily driven factors waning. hospitalizations remained high, modest declines limited Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna recipients ≥65 years, supporting targeted booster dosing recommendations. variant evolves time next season. yearly thing people get vaccinated. Last year people removed Facebook telling people wear masks, they’re removed saying too. 

Censorship protect ignorant misinformation rather educating discern difference **very** Orwellian. long predates pandemic come sharper focus last couple years. 

What’s frightening￼ extremely anti-intellectual trend censorship, forms, come regarded somehow intellectual position. mean say don’t get referencing article telling doctor lose license contrary opinion fickle orthodoxy. It’s absurd. Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

In seriousness hope feel better soon. vaccinated? know governor say: ""See, went away own, need mandates."" completely ignoring past month's. Yeah, honestly people trust issues vaccine (and media) going Russia? data blackout? sequences month death case rates seem way abnormal.  talking doctors, talking ones deal that. referring ones working cushy, high end facilities need rather large annual income order even walk inside, forget seeking treatment.

The doctors referring like anti-vaxxers: never deal worst effects covid-19, since clientele wipe asses fistfuls hundred dollar bills care. rich already vaccinated, kids well private schools children attend everything prevent people getting sick. rich get sick, easily get treatments recover illness quickly low risk side effects.

What, think anti-vaxxers would allow overworked, disheveled doctor thinning hair champion medicine? No, want clean shaven, well groomed rested looking doctor calmly saying vaccines unneccessary. Well, told would end world scoffers hedonists. would think Jesus return would make sense peak Earth population, 10 billion souls. Also, lot high strangeness going world moment. could sure wrong I've done lot research subject. think could soon could decade two. Also, get vaccinated! long Covid happen mild infections research showing people mild breakthrough infections vaccinated lower chance long Covid?

Long term symptoms happen virus.  seasonal flu 25 years ago, really knocked loop.......and took many many years return previous health picture.    


So true long hauler covid number things. Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, pretty much instantly curable short dose antibiotic.....yet lingering symptoms may persist simply damage acute phase.  truly worrisome people seeking sorts charlatan doctors infusing antibiotics stuff telling ""they're still sick"" even though CDC qualified medical doctor tell RMSF cured one course doxycyline (and IS).    


SO lot illnesses really throw body off, usually heals TIME, self-care form good diet, exercize, good sleep, addressing vitamin/mineral deficiencies, simple stuff like that.......that's grandparents it, least mine. yes, take years. neurologist pre-screen that’s useful.

1. Lie least 2 minutes. Take BP/heart rate.
2. Sit 2 minutes. Take BP/heart rate.
3. Stand 2 minutes. Take BP/heart rate.

The differences deterministic, useful diagnosis.  biggie. move Texas. butcher people permanently lose license make restitution.  undiagnosed POTS pre-Covid. I’d wound ER symptoms migraines blurry vision (they saw fat certain diabetes :P) intractable whole body pain. give gigging musician could longer stand.

I say it’s like altitude sick, day, every day, sea level.

I finally data point much worse now: even diamox starting 2 days ahead, I’d start getting altitude headaches 4,000’ pre-Covid. I’m mostly managed POTS meds, start getting altitude headaches 3,000’ (still starting diamox 2 days before). Also Fauci: “You go trick treating year.” bet see uptick cases following Halloween. may know rough causes treatments, really don’t know specifically body it’s makes hard fix.

Really sorry CRPS. heard painful.   


What said quoted true many disorders.  Fibromyalgia instance.  


The problem things ""treatments"" ""fixable"" cause lot angst mistrust doctor/patient relationship.   


I took doctor word, know really cares me, ""there anything yet......we hope time passes learn problem have.....""

I’m happy won’t allowed interact at-risk patients. I’m scared kids. Remember celebrated beating virus July 4th followed surge even worse last year's still technically in?

I replying comment, sorry. Definitely talking surges Hold up. think needed political lenses reasonably suspect well way winning thing early summer. Mutating produce 1000x infectious virions one time clutch moves. buy windows 11? swore vaccine bought it?  Same. 20s vaccinated still taken week.    maybe people interested pharmacology think.

I almost went back school pharmacogenetics/pharmacogenomics (how genes impact way medications react body). mechanisms action cellular level incredibly complex interesting. everyone wants doctor. don’t think it’s surges, aggregate numbers.  think that’s point don’t know resurface later. know crosses blood brain barrier ago chiropractors popular tik tok commented “uh masks?” You’d get much hate. Like aren’t required medical facilities? last surge ended 2021. We're talking delta surge right? Delta surge bad vaccines one thinks anymore. follow media hype (typically headlines that). covid great show us stupid human beings truly are. vaccines make less likely infected, less likely get sick infected, much less likely hospitalized die get sick. point literally like ""some people still get hurt car crashes wearing seat belts, bother wearing them?"" I’d try r/COVID19. They’ve got folks really good keeping studies  tricky since covid dangerous endemic pathogens normally deal with. guessing would expect see covid deaths continue among unvaccinated somewhere higher flu level amounts per year. 

with science back up, guess thing help unvaccinated people survive better overall case count going down. ie 100 people town covid unvaccinated higher chance getting sick dying 10 people town it.  Ah endgame question…the question Redditors want restrictions long time people still live life normally even vaccinated hate answering. Lol. can’t people understand this??? know people think vaccine isn’t full proof get it. NEVER said was. always reduce risk serious illness! Endemic mean confined one spot. flu endemic exist across globe. IMO way bigger factor people see realize large majority cases well overwhelming majority hospitalized unvaccinated, it’s easy see fully vaccinated took measures seriously prior vaccination finding harder care much living life normally (save wearing mask public), ie socializing in-person again, making plans holidays travel socialize in-person due awful virtual gatherings, dining again, etc. Yep. 30bps difference often indicitative pots pandemic lot suddenness growth across whole world. think spanish flu covid. life time events.

endemic regularity small localized outbreaks. think strep throat, flu, colds, etc. see regularity every year life.  Minnesota, even Minneapolis, usually bit like coastal areas respect, one taking precautions. Even, maybe particularly, among educated, well-off people. I'd extremely cautious going grocery shopping restaurants outdoor dining, go several indoor locations fancy, rich part town....and one masked. pharmacy, usual one, pharmacists masked! 

But honestly, think comparatively mild spring surge, incredible infectiousness Delta onsite school big drivers. course go back office right middle this, booster shot job strongly enforced mask mandate, that's something. 

It's bit scary case counts deaths visibly worse spring surge show sign even leveling off, never mind declining. hospitals stressed already worry next weeks. So, cold weather states. good. Really like way described that, really wish could communicated like them. Right going like actions consequences. sad found antivax family member got antibody treatment, knowing demand it. Person goes around saying easy covid was. 

Sadly like analogy points out, feel like real consequences going get people.  cases I've seen POTS related falls asking opioids  Pulp Fiction, Wolf: “ Let’s start sucking other’s dicks yet” pilots union says sickout protest part. (if turns be, lose face airline probably telling truth)

FAA says there's air traffic control issue (with exception small part jacksonville air control area)

company says essentially cut back lots flights last year trouble getting air planes crews right spots right times. likely option.

other airlines problems despite weather, air traffic control, vaccine mandates, etc....so narrows possible issues  Quacks gonna quack. specific sources, last ballpark remember

all 90-95 effective preventing hospitalizations starting first day (ie 2 weeks post)

at 6 month plus point iirc something like 77% JJ, 80 something percent pfizer 90 something percent moderna. Still waiting magnetic powers. disappointed. Thumbs? kind typer you...  goes show matter kind government live certain percent population going make stupid choices public health. Yes, government going make mistakes public health pandemic, going cause distrust, literally proof again, seems human reaction told something yourself, protect others something can’t see. could actually see virus floating around air small water droplets wouldn’t try use armor/mitigation try stop entering bodies then? making sure loved ones people interacted every day also protected things floating around air.

The vaccine weapon, masks mitigation techniques armor. 

You can’t see invader without electron microscope.

Just government tries get use things (in enemy destroying humans stop people dying, suffering, ruining economy exhausting medical workers) mean solutions wrong don’t trust/like government.

It seems problem humanity wide. Wonder many pandemics humanity survive successfully set beliefs continues spread. overpopulated planet running resources. 

Human suffering caused willful ignorance need feel individual special going destroy us. implied due American government making people wear mask failing us since Covid still present. realize whatever hypothetical future date Canadian government stops urging mask, guys still Covid borders, right? It’s going away. especially northern states likely visited Canadians, we’re highly vaccinated we’re fine without restrictions. since merck applied approval, essentially saying need testing review process whatsoever, take companies word. saw well worked last year supposed supposed miracle drug. Women concerned blood clots remember chance stroke birth control pills 1 3,000 considered safe acceptable level. chance blood clot J&amp;J 7 1,000,000.  “dangerous cause staph infections”

That's rationalization justify wearing mask. Basically either want wear mask inconvenience, need normalcy sense routine formerly adapted return, see symbol allegiance political ideology, presents opportunity Karen behalf social potency.

That mask ""dangerous cause staph infections"" excuse use justify wearing reasons. Man rational animal, rationalizing animal. -- Robert A. Heinlein say ""liberty"" say ""freedom"" almighty dollar king. would also like option get different booster, mainly simple logistics. far places offering Moderna Pfizer state Johnson Johnson. want specific brand shot drive one two hours away.     said enough testing show won’t that. H1N1 pandemic ended another strain replaced ended pandemic measures flu. That's equivalent saying Alpha strain pandemic ended Delta supplanted globally dominate strain.

To get point treat covid way diseases we're going need k ow much covid, least quintuple hospital capacity(based current levels hospitalization), establish new global transportation. going take nearly decade. shrug diseases. ongoing clinical trial US looking mixing vaccine brands boosters, ie 'heterologous' vaccinations.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* grandfather died flu, understand quite could happen caught bad case. 18 year old barely enough energy make bathroom. could guess much worse would older person. I'd say depends location - masking (vaccinated) waves, started least putting mine go grocery things got bad (and, stopped going indoor restaurants little while). Things declining I'm still top-10-worst state per capita cases, things go decline I'll back non masking. Michigan warm too. probably depends 5-11 age range get vaccinated. takes several weeks time first get shot time fully vaccinated kids don’t get early November won’t fully vaccinated Christmas. long kids 5-11 person school indoors without vaccines hard stop spread lot get vaccinated probably fall quite bit compared today. centrist lol CO decent Vax rate comparison states

Colorado's vaccination rate also pretty stark differences depending state.

If Denver sitting low (in terms per capita cases) dropping bit, overcome El Paso County western slope sitting mid high rising.

I'm saying that's happening, surprised is. whole sport cesspool certain type people

Sport general lot vaccine hesitant/anti-vax - confined ... sport without many viewers.

Tell American without telling American. Next telling association football popular either. Pandemic endemic mutually exclusive terms. Endemic means infection circulating population. Pandemic means outbreaks particular infection globally. infection endemic entire global population we're constant state pandemic regarding virus.

We take major steps control infections known endemic globally accustomed realise they're taking place. Ooh that’ll teach also factor people vaccinated don’t care what’s going unvaxxed community. People got vaxxed moved participating clinical trial, US, studying boosters mix match guinea pig. trial participants received J&amp;J, receiving two doses mRNA vaccine single dose booster. know anyone else studying single dose mRNA booster J&amp;J receivers limited experience think safe assume if/when regular boosters become thing stuck one already received. Francis Collins probably actual Evangelical Christian, Christian Nationalist self-identifies Evangelical.

I also think characterization ""puzzled"" incorrect. correctly identified reason (misinformation obtained internet) used word ""supposed"" purpose. He's well aware many Christian Nationalist concern neighbors even though supposed to.

I think he's probably well aware differences beliefs Christian Nationalists, hoping breakthrough regardless. mean, frankly, neither seem particularly competent ""governing"". going see lot kids dying foolishness.

It might kids dying large numbers closed groups unvaccinated people close proximity basically going make impossible get herd immunity means Covid continue circulate kill vulnerable people like elderly preexisting conditions. 5-11 age range get vaccinated likely lot stop spread.  long ago going school work flu sign toughness good work ethic. glad changimg. bad. There's long history heavy distrust government, combined faith alternative medicine. Deaths might lot lower UK highest death rate Western Europe months Get dick

Cool. Literally nobody interested it. 

It’s safe. n = n = 1

**Nevertheless,** long covid requires previous covid infection literally cannot long covid. 

And, respectfully, I’ve lost track actual point, one. Sorry that.

… still haven’t addressed anything I’ve actually said. :( side effect I’ve ever flu shot soreness/pain injection site, that’s also side effect covid vaccine. 

I think flu shot side effects beyond arm soreness pretty rare compared covid vax side effects Cuba already vaccinated children...America FDA politics. need non MRNA/DNA vaccines. traditional vaccines already made. FDA keeps dragging feet.

We emergency use authorization Mrna vaccines traditional vaccines even applied.

It makes sense. know, Amazon purchases up....  one people claim insist it’s okay see family around holidays.

Not arguing it, it’s predictable point. People may may follow guidelines, comes holidays, real excuses come out. went rewatched X-Men anticipation! bummed.   virus moving north. Looks like state peaked. live north, get vaccinated! this. obvious thing do. 

Next, hope require flu shot health workers. I’m frustrated society right need rant. opportunity healing letting tear us apart. anyone explain we’re deploying war like response point? 

A year half ago, knew nothing virus. quickly overwhelmed healthcare system. stop spread costs country rose challenge went quarantine. 

The selfish idiots refused paid price lives lives friends family. 

Fast forward today, facts different. know virus. know works, spreads, vulnerable it. safe effective vaccines, promising therapeutics. 

Instead hating trying control other, don’t come together fight thing? 

Poverty wealth inequality historic levels. Give vaccinated people $1000 stimulus checks. 

Our ICUs continue capacity issues… BUILD MORE. China built hundreds hospitals 3 months. Impoverished blue collar areas hit hardest, put folks work building infrastructure fight back. could create millions decent jobs. 

We medical staffing issues. also lot people college degrees can’t find work buried debt. Send nursing school free, forgive debt, give reoccurring bonuses healthcare workers front lines fighting thing. Pay people relocate needed. Take care heroes instead patting back. 

Some therapeutics shown promise. Invest research find actually work. Invest figuring ways make things like monoclonal antibody treatment accessible. may better investing money predictive research, there’s mounting circumstantial evidence type research may gotten us mess first place. 

If spend $8 trillion blunder around Afghanistan, afford war like response virus killed hundreds thousands. Many independent economists agreed deficit spending okay long money intelligently invested. getting chilly sun goes down. left jacket home warm day, going heading party lasts evening. Dr. Fauci changed stance? honestly can’t recall. seems goes current information cautious possibly say anything definitive early. 

I also don’t think problem talking much, rather it’s reporters asking often. He’s going pop every day every news site set questions.  Good grief. $100 fine deliberately putting others lives risk? want data. Since trust anything done home.

Supply reason. There's benefit mixing vaccines. get better immune response using vaccine shot. Wrong.

Protection hospitalisation Delta still around 70% one shot.

Delta brings people hospital alpha, even similar efficiency get critical cases, baseline changed.

That's everyone, especially JnJ folks, get second shot asap neighboring states waves similar magnitude timing (Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina) also lying numbers way down? think Florida somehow outlier numbers failing improve way neighbor states have?  Sorry loss :/

But even want say? Get dick

Cool. Literally nobody interested it.  split right along union lines- union office, NBU home absolutely put pressure union. health decision much political one. Absolutely disgusting, even particularly pro-union. 

I really think office folks WFH option. planning retire company, I'm making plans get get flexible position. burned immeasurable amount good choices made. wish best outcome. require bunch medical study data conducted U.S getting close getting official FDA stamp approval it.

It's that. trust data come US sources. would great led world. don't. follow. That's trail world weeks months. rest world confirm data trust. look recent situation boosters Israel. data met great skepticism. confirmed months later. hailed. simply trust what's done here. flu shots less reactogen covid shots, means side reactions less common, reactogenity low flu shots medicore covid shots. figured point pandemic come waves rise fall, everywhere planet, know tell you. People want neat wrapped-up-in-a-bow answer definite human decisions behaviors explain every rise fall. different decisions behaviors might affect shape severity wave, clear arrival departure waves something neat, tidy explanation for.  Netherlands. Cases rising, it’s mainly unvaccinated people ends hospitals. Things busy control. Time live bit. Chickenpox vaccine ""type"" MMR shot?  best course action still try improve overall health reduce systemic stress alleviate issues cause. pointed nervous system disorders hard diagnose treat directly, issues disguised/compounded/misattributed poor general health makes worse. may look like much, “again” really holds lot weight. don’t think Trump’s campaign slogan would even fraction effect without it.  I’m personal level, however focused ending mask mandates. wear one required to, absolutely hate them. way mandates end people get vaxxed, care.  would locked brand? body care brands...

The vaccine leaves body days, immune response stays.

Since 3 vaccines cleared us exactly via different routes (make body produce point mutated spike protein raw quantities), literally risk involved comes mixing.

In general vaccines always mixed. doctor look last flu shot giving next one year later.


I got JnJ beginning bc shot first offered got Pfizer/BioNTech second one  I’ve never side effects flu shot, I’ve always felt perfectly normal. 

But little feverish, achy tired covid shot Last time posted thread someone DM'd told I'd dead vaccine 6 months.

It's 7.5 months since second shot, I'm sure s/he meant 6 months day, 6 months day messaged me? Pfizer Moderna comparable, J&amp;J AZ are. J&amp;J AZ use type technology. People mixing AZ Pfizer Moderna while. hear much J&amp;J predominantly used US. US, trails mrna vaccines large margin. Case rates surging. load crap. flu shot always ""type"" (i.e. viral vector, inactivated virus, mRNA, etc)? switch like COVID jabs? trying gauge whether totally unprecedented not. UK. restrictions whatsoever. Cases pretty high deaths low change hospitalisations weeks now. time last year control, vaccine done job back normal again. I’ve already mentioned, January still coldest month United States, ***coolest***. There’s difference. 

When gets *too* cold, people don’t socialize much they’re stuck home. …Maybe downward trend? example, UK peaked January. 

I wonder why? ;)

But yeah, that, we’re mostly page. Thank you, I'd reading social media European friends sure J&amp;J different ""type"" technology altogether. Really appreciate info! There's also diet control.  think usage ""possibly"" ""potentially"" means ""not confirmed"" got flu shot couple weeks ago - arm pretty sore couple days, day bit fatigued/muscle achey. Nothing compared COVID vaccine though. point light match walk away spikes death hospitalization? Nah, people spent much personal capital doubling ""covid real"" ""it's big deal"" feel they'll lose face ""backing down"" getting vaccine.

This 100% side culture war willing admit took wrong stance. headed north while. West Virginia got hit hard, makes sense PA would next. 

Vaccination helps, Delta moving around.

Which makes worry come back South! Deaths arent lag behind.

This part incorrect. Deaths peaked 1767/day September 15, per CDC, declined 1465/day October 8. huge decrease, 17% drop 3 weeks, continue, mirroring drop cases occurred. Oklahoma list well.  Ah, yes, medical problem makes movement exercise difficult dangerous *definitely* cured using said exercise loverly lose weight!: ) 

There's door, monarch. without vaccine mandates state forever. kids vaccinated covid far concerned. done everything asked me. wear mask told wife fully vaccinated us got booster. 

fuck everyone willingly refused vaccine (except small percentage cant get vaccine whatever reason), reason continues. Enjoy ventilation stay local ER wont missed. 

I done beyond narcissism. point solipsism. even exist I'm experiencing it.  agree Rule thumb 2 weeks. Yeah that’s 100% thinking. hate even worry. I’m vaccinated, there’s little chance catching - do, little chance getting bad...but mentioned it’s fear perceived taking advantage situation work getting others sick. 

Scheduled Covid test afternoon. Hopefully I’ll peace mind come tomorrow.

I feeling tired last week, feared body fighting something, chalked long weekend time difference. current surge mostly affected unvaccinated. also accompanied fresh round nonsense cures growing anti-HCW conspiracy theories. Empathy burnout real.  cases decreasing, expect see ICU's emptying next weeks, especially since vaccinations increasing Alaska tourism commercials lied me. funny stated lot people POTS fault own.  Last read third doses outpacing new doses. basically people care doubling know fellow citizens trusted.  Tons people long covid give alcohol. heard seizures, commonly triggers lots general shitty symptoms. definitely born POTS although EDS underlying condition. dismantle heart rate monitor crib NICU everyone went sleep went saying coding out. decided fine sent home follow point symptoms dismissed directly caused weight alone simple that. Weight compounding risk factor certainly increase likelihood triggering condition, doesn’t mean direct causal relationship point condition, losing weight direct &amp; guaranteed path suddenly cured complex nerve disorder. Anecdotal, mild chronic post nasal drip (and resulting sore throat / occasional coughing) last week coming back traveling large concert week before. symptoms. pretty worried covid got PCR tested Saturday negative. There's probably lot non-Covid infections going around due decreased masking, also bad allergies cause too. said pretty trivial get tested want peace mind. They’re guys couldn’t get med school trying make name - like Posers running around guns don’t takes military. certain number people get sick die every year, like flu. pretty much everyone exposed one way another part life.maybe annual shots like flu, maybe won’t be, maybe vaccine cover life. don’t know yet. 

People always gotten sick died. Life always risk. cfs doctor(essentially collective long haul post viral issues) said seeing maybe 20 30 percent get worse vax, seemingly permanently, benefits wearing around 4 months, give take couple months.

with info, decided get vaxed. know people personally went mild cfs/long covid(like still worked) bed bound, already am. worth risk. got covid again, even vaxed, i'm prob dead, choose end life. kind moot point sort thing.  OP aunt 2 year old, I'm sorry. Booking first ever Flu shot end week. Absolutely. parent can't control specific genetic make child, breed.

/s current surge's peak worse last years country, though seem care half much time around. Honest question, instead? Hospitals stay full quite new infections trend downward like lag new infections filling new waves come. True I’d rather deal “bad look” calling sick staying home one spread Covid office find interesting people say POC sue discrimination, people say Americans sue want money, ones try sue vaccinated losing job. Got mine way back March. Still waiting “kill switch” activated. It’s disappointment far. wanna talk lied spread false guess, old ""he said mask beginning pandemic"" comment? even believe  guy anyone believes word says

So, world class pathologist? Despite knowing better? Nobody gives fuck shitty personal experience dumb fuck. flu B February 2020. awful. ""B"" ""Bad"". could stare wall, TV way much. People seem 'ok' situation long recent surge falls lower peak last surge. ""Its bad before"" basically rallying cry selfish masses think affect care badly might affect people. Let's forget Bush's ""mission accomplished"" speech 17 years end war Afghanistan. early 2021 would pretty small number people getting breakthroughs first place, since vaccine still pretty restricted point restricted people already highest risk serious side effects You’re correct. said below, conservatism fallen apart become populism liberalism fallen apart become leftism. comparing state itself, pretty useless comparison among states. example (I'm completely making numbers), Colorado averaged 100 cases/day, averages 105, rising. 

However, state averaging 2500/day, 2490/day, list. always ask see meds/injections taking them. nurse/dr/pharmacist good, they'll show packet hand. another pair eyes catch mistakes like mentioned OP. also ""taking control health"", good medical professional encourage. always look away getting actual shot. Yeah let's try create words it, thanks. wonderful combination ice cream flavors, y'know? Call is; sugar coat using cute words pander younger generations. Evangelical Christianity US ideological/political movement uses religion packaging. little actual Christianity. /r/covidlonghaulers full people symptoms, common long hauling No, that’s incorrect. Personal responsibility WOULD things like wearing mask getting vaccinated, take personal responsibility outcome actions. Conservatism fallen apart become populism liberalism fallen apart become leftism, are. late. There's whole bunch us weird large boat may well called 'Not 100 percent healthy, strictly immunocompromised, either'. 

I look forward time ease mask-wearing social distancing, look forward time breathe easier sending too-young-to-get-the-vax-but-really-no-kidding-fully-compliant-with-mask-wearing kid school.

But remain wary, know much COVID, we're far understanding effects people ways does. vaccinated. tested returned. showing symptoms now. understand feeling guilty, right things, showing possible symptom, presumably going stay home test get results. That's do, really, short sealing inside house 24/7 like March 2020 (and that). drugs seeking? Beta blockers prescribed major drug abuse far I'm aware. I've already asked doc flu vaccine (not avail. yet) still waiting booster shot (had single dose J&amp;J covid vaccine shot). I'm worried rather people like mother transplant immuncompromised even cold could kill her, flu covid obviously even dangerous efficacy vaccine immuncompromised people laughably low (\~20% downwards). want kill people near them, especially family. 

Even pessimist, winter frightening :( Western Slope eastern farm country… Grand Junction dang near maskless weeks ago. Yeah that’s move, think. worked home last week precaution got negative test. feel guilty like “hey guys, know tested negative? Well I’m showing symptoms!” Thanks pointing -- HUGE distinction. really ironic Francis Collins identifies 'evangelical Christian' puzzled Christians getting vaxxed.

""Christians, people, supposed particularly worried 
 neighbors,"" Dr. Francis Collins told CNN Saturday.""

I think operative word ""***supposed***"". 19% people break Covid ended going hospital****** Interesting, hadn’t heard hpv link. get vaccinated since? I’ve heard long haulers finding relief getting shot know someone post-polio syndrome met second light adventure trip South America. 

I already understood polio menace met them. post-polio syndrome ... another thing entirely. seems extra-cruel disease encore significant minority survived polio.

Who's say something like post-COVID syndrome emerge someday, taking place alongside Long Covid?

Nope nope nope. family going stay wary. eligible vaccinated, we'll consider resume doing. spouse intend seek booster shots. stick plan gleefully destroying first mask ever wore, mark something looks like end thing.

But we're going stay wary. I'll weed mask wardrobe empty it. Kremlin Monday described Russia's Covid fatality toll ""high"" country's vaccination rate ""unacceptably"" low, even **it rejected new restrictions protect economy.**   Monday registered 957 new deaths Covid-19 24 hours, bringing country's total fatalities 217,372 – highest toll Europe – even **authorities accused downplaying severity Russia's outbreak.**    growing toll virus comes Russia's jab drive stalled. Monday, 30 percent Russians fully vaccinated, according Gogov website, tallies Covid-19 data regions.""Yes, indeed, level vaccinations small, unacceptably small,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, saying reason ""such high mortality rate.""   **he dismissed notion authorities could more, saying done everything give public chance ""save lives getting vaccinated.""**   several Russian-developed jabs available months, authorities struggled inoculate vaccine-skeptic population.Independent polls show **half Russians plan get shot.**   **surging infections come without real pandemic restrictions limit spread**, though several regions re-introduced QR codes access public places.   Moscow far withheld bringing back restrictions, Monday announced would open two dozen sites around city residents could get free express tests.Officials said additional sites would allow authorities ""completely avoid introduction severe restrictions"" **""not harm city's economy.""**

So simply gave up. Put responsibility regions. QR-restrictions, summer real effect daily Covid deaths.

Unfortunately new cases daily deaths increase autumn, let Covid run population.

&amp;#x200B;

Failed. Prepare trouble...and make double! left yesterday. Didn’t see single mask folks working service industry. Yes, I’m sure 1 case study 100 years ago completely different family diseases, commercial air travel even existed, perfect analogous comparison current pandemic, works identical blueprint what’s happening today. Yeah, it’ll 2 years, aware Spanish flu making headlines 2 years.

Really? mean, *really?* claim still made conspiracy theorists. WTF. CO? We’re vaccinated average, still mask indoors (well, Denver Boulder bubble)... Source? I’ve looking study related hypothesis months.  Bible Belt. Halloween ""alternative events"". People really think devil real around here. Exactly. Go live life. - that's breakthrough case started. also easily attributable ton non-COVID things. peace mind, go get another test next day - would put far enough past plane exposure test positive (assuming are, seems far likely).  jab still got COVID. Waiting long term effects. Im internist. Please go see dedicated neurologist. Depending demographics, many neurologic diseases present initial dysautonomia. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

And, course, got COVID began worse asthma before. 

Anyway, talk sometimes though really, really feels people long COVID know bad probably going rest lives, hope research comes this. Flu 50uL, Pfizer 30uL adults probably going 10uL young children. clean use new disposal mask every day, maybe. Stomach virus 18 me, although I’ve made good bit progress since then. joke theories hpv could play role post viral disease. i'm almost certain got last fling. speculation data subject really, orphan disease.

i got covid april 2020, vax had.

thanks. Surface transmission extremely low parent small children (and cares abou them): duh using death rate evidence danger terrifyingly narrow-minded.

It ignores increasing hospitalization rate. ignores increasing number kids ventilators. ignores long term effects COVID infections. ignores tangible costs families incur infections, children might stunted following decades adults decided get sick instead playing safe getting vaccine. inventory found nearly 5,000 packages lost depot storage improper temperatures, prosecution statement said Sunday. vaccines dumped went missing given authorised pharmacist driver Health Ministry vehicle deliver Minya directorate, prosecution said. 
 


Why?

Any Egyptian sources? people look one- 1918 flu, desperately search meaning like crystal ball.

Well pandemic compare to? go back earlier 1918 going back medical science drastically worse today. plague cured antibiotics, example, would compare today's situation?  Well since expert ahead worlds experts suppose will. 

/s   agree first part. hate situation unethical decision, vaccine like last Coast Guard helicopter town evacuation. take it, going dangerous send another one back hurricane hits. can't afford displace much medical treatment people refused step 1 living world covid.  un vaccinated fine well? two mutually exclusive, since immunocompromised teachers vaccinated still need unvaccinated students wear masks, mask mandate students paired vaccine mandate staff. teacher friend mine MS 40 vaccinated recently died covid. district still mask mandate students. Ah yes, i'd heard too. would exciting validate. Yikes. Luckily NYC, still considered standard normal wear mask indoors public places. I've definitely seen relax quite bit. 

After posted that, colleague mentioned colleague (age 28, fully vaxxed) covid August still struggling smell taste issues. pretty mild symptomatic case. That's thanks me! planning able thoroughly enjoy delicious foods throughout coming holiday season. Yup. It'll hard work, it'll also free jobs hard working people currently studying get medicine like niece. also use big toes.   Oh geeze, thanks, vaccine fear nonsense worldwide see. people, others impacted them. 


wearing mask public spaces hard, helpful whether vaccinated not. immunity waning cleared booster yet (althought could probably go get it) every transmission helps spread. 


Just people shitty mean throw baby w/ bathwater.  


But apparently options 'rave stay basement' foolish absolutism. Cringe. Info: mandated teachers get vaxxed? mask works both. Always worked seasonal flu; people needed proper motivation wear it. [54% would get (July). 


Still slow rate fully vaccinated. excitement level dropped little learned take 8 times day, 5 days. Seems like game Whack-a-Mole Pong virus 5 days haha. Still, I'd definitely take infected.  realize POTS last *months*, right? It’s medically diagnosed health professionals. Gotta factor mandates taking effect, need COVID related healthcare go down. Best eliminate problem source instead throwing healthcare personnel it. Especially anti medicine nurses. ??  4 5 went Biden 2020.

Maybe, instead everything always political slant, certain places there's quite enough prior immunity vaccination and/or prior infection, conjunction cooling weather causing time indoors, delta wave transitions around regionally. think filling ICUs? trying smartass else expected people refuse life saving medicine could prevent ending ICUs? ""Wear mask, stay home"" good scenario. even help, us supposed start frustrated people would never dream returning favor. doesn't. dumb stupid adults blood hands. vaccine available long enough. Children dying covid (they likely die gun violence illnesses) 

&amp;#x200B;

This dumb fucking idiot adults take vaccine.  Blaming relying India begs question speedy alternative manufacturing base.  would amazed resilient kids grown ass adults comes able wear mask throwing shit fit day.

Also, know meant LOT kids dying, kids dying. agree didnt mean 'that way'. guess got downvoted someone jumped conclusion think flu big deal. Got injection booked next month.

What meant was, gone endemic like flu, arent getting rid anytime soon ever, likely stuck two shots (flu + covid) year thanks dumbasses wouldnt help strangle birth.

Given fact immunity sort seems diminish fairly quickly going regularly killing lot anti vaxxers every year wise up, may never happen, woudl shame.... Unfortunately collateral damage. worst one “bubble”, caught lot parts Canada. long disorder last? cycle? Forever? Would good know. real maximum interval doses long record first dose. bought windows 11? figured people would upgrade 10 predict Puravir, Nupira, Nupiravir 🤔 keep going back forth whether get booster. hit six-month mark live area extremely high vax rates I’m sure it’s necessary.

Then again, it’s like early days things need saved need most. couldn’t HURT, right? look like newt.  Right? what? What's DNA going permanently change into? Not-DNA? Animal DNA? Chicken soup?

I've heard Anti-vaxxers use line before, one mentions changes changes do. answer that. Waco thinks crazy, time reevaluate life choices. happened February 4th?   4 wrong. posters pointed Australia authoritarian compared US even UK. 

This Australia high state capacity (state capacity simply described ability government get shit done). nations well initial outbreak it. Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan, Singapore Vietnam completely different plans deal covid two things common plan executed competently. 

Australian's also tendency become ""we"" focused rather ""I"" focused shit hits fan. Covid overshadowed largest city Australia started 2020 seeing sun eight weeks due bushfires. started year brushing ash clothing.

For reasons heard ""tyrannical government overtake"" Australia bullshit. We're fine here. Chances we'll reach 95% fully vaccinated December everything go back normal.  Kelloggs workers strike. Maybe saw news Brexit effects UK thinking it’s coming US? Please report back get flu shot year! Like said, still chicken. got covid booster Friday. Saturday day felt pretty alright, though feel quite crappy hours evening. bad flu shot, reminded much crappier felt. 

I'd super curious hear experience. likely skip year work home unlikely end exposed flu anyway. may get pregnant years know I'll choose get then. Would nice know could expect better experience. Entrepreneurs backbone economy. always shit heads profession non-zero (but close zero) chance autoimmune disease, likely temporary, vaccine. Famously, Guillan-Barre one them. [Here’s paper also possible develop one (otherwise) asymptomatic infection, though, MIS-C sometimes comes asymptomatic Covid infection. And, course, there’s far higher incidence autoimmune diseases viruses vaccine.

I would automatically discredit experience, it’s likely asymptomatic illness shortly vaccinated.   Log kid, you’re gonna hurt yourself. try make sure future generations repeat amplify foolish, delusional, defiant mistakes ""we"" made again.

Just happened 1918. should. Also end month, school-aged kids 5-11 shot going approved Halloween. Every state making requirement - different measles every required shot. Gov. Abott trash! No! use big toes God intended.  ""two weeks slow spread give hospitals time procure PPE equipment!""

Turned 

""Yeah 18 months vaccine highly effective treatment methods still might need cancel Christmas.""

No thanks, Fauci. everything supposed vaccinated I'm declaring victory going want now. know that, know that, thinking people know that. found surprising head CDC megafuckton college degrees probably LOT smarts know that.

Lots useful data coming states *do* report, fwiw. addition:

What longterm covid vaccine effects/disorders?

What longterm effects covid patients received vaccines?

Would love see studies conducted side side one stated post. seriously irritating much love push idea vaccines cause random side effects outside normal ones months shows given.  turned newt!  Solipsism interesting concept, think?   specifically talking staff eligible half year  mandate children 12 above, LA County done.  that's term ""Phyrric victory"" comes   School districts can’t.

Thanks - can’t believe clickbait headlines covid like now. got tested lymes already. remember tick bite though thinking would've old infection. Possible new early. waiting little retest since test early comes negative Right - mitigations all, oxygen run out, death toll would least double that. coordinated encouragement doubt would widespread mitigations. effective mitigation probably work home, would happened widely coordinated encouragement. Yeah, thank clarifying. info perspective helpful. OC claimed vaccine gave long covid/pots even though haven’t covid symptoms lasted weeks most. mandate vaccines instead?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Thanks permission lol - enjoyed last year though. small party went trick treating kids.  Definitely. It’s tough enough living often “invisible” disability like POTS. can’t tell many times I’ve told family members exercise specific diet make condition better. People don’t know anything it, apparently don’t want believe know help/hurt me. least money researches put studying now.  Many Western countries, nations regions elsewhere, regularly publish data mortality causes. table shows that, places, number excess deaths (compared baseline) greater number covid-19 fatalities officially recorded government. full data country, well underlying code, downloaded GitHub repository. sources also include Human Mortality Database, collaboration UC Berkeley Max Planck Institute Germany, World Mortality Dataset, created Ariel Karlinsky Dmitry Kobak.

Follow links provided section Github, Human Mortality Database, World Mortality doesn’t even show numbers

Below section table total deaths per country according official numbers according excess death I’m past point listening whatever Government sources want spout

That covers every possible source, actually mean that. source death statistics? Well state we're still nearing ICU capacities that's suppose.    Needs caps typo

MISSION ACCOMPLIBED sucks seeing many people trained help others get poisoned propaganda. Look American fire department. pandemic ever ended within 2 years. Even SARS virus exceptionally easy control discovered early circulated 4 years. Exactly. 

That trusts fact twice fact 5 billion administered without issue!

I really hope Masi F1 replace fool.   lie people telling Spanish Flu. They're ignoring fact circulating least year anyone acknowledged illness we're still dealing variants Spanish Flu 100 years later.

They assume dropped 9f news cycle hospital capacity treatment protocols reached levels morgues overrun pandemic ended. Hundo p! source death statistics?

Feelings. Source? also observation Breckenridge area. sounds like Kremlin like COVID results design. Might time redesign. Aren’t still elderly immunocomprimised anyway? I’d get Pfizer otherwise. really great, hope people still get vaccinated.  Crazy, one family, including two young kids, cold since Covid began.  It’s kinda funny you’re triggered someone calling intentionally making contrarian argument. 

And didn’t address anything actually said. 

And I’m wrong.  ""US big 3"" mean?

We consensus quickly efficacy infection wanes. small fraction people 6+ months since recent dose, we're likely get much data beyond point wealthy countries since they'll giving third doses. best approximate comparing geometric decay [this old graph [this waning efficiency, though, every study third doses incredibly positive. Moderna's [n=20 phase showed raising antibody titers 42-fold, bringing 6 times higher second dose.  larger study showed closer 2 times higher third dose vs second. results bring efficacy infection back 95% range wildtype.

[Real-world data basically confirms this, showing least 5-fold (and likely like 10-fold) reduction infections third dose. Even significantly, Delta cases cut nearly half weekly since gave another 0.5 doses per population last months. exact effect saw Alpha crossed 50% first dose back spring.

With something like 10 million people US third dose, we'll get kind real-world data states soon. like initial EUA, going data rolling lots confounding factors continue give doses. Everyone caught least temporarily immune. Well vax also caused neuro issues, that’s I'll need dig articles, Ohio majority cases last wave kids school.

It's shocking, went last year, thought smart open schools far infectious variant. Natural immunity thing too.

You still dress up, paint faces, take pictures everything agreed ""wait play safe"" move. others said, there’s really known maximum. Lots countries 6 weeks 8 weeks. wouldn’t push far beyond that, it’s probably huge deal regardless.

That said, assuming you’re US open getting booster 6+ months, would benefit short long term following 3 4 week regimen first two getting boost 6 months later. way you’re getting maximum protection next months, bring back even higher levels booster later. one dose minimal protection it’s likely wane quicker, unless/until get second dose. directly replying comment referencing child deaths. saying get kids vaccinated. could wrong? one community died anywhere near time. one family died. get tested work constantly never tested positive. uncle drew videos amusing.  restrictions, work combining yearly COVID, flu rhinovirus boosters single shot similar people already get TDAP. sister developed POTS Covid. went college senior studying CS simultaneously 20-30 hours ballet college level working TA basically staying home spending much time bed. breaks heart much potential ambition can’t even work. companies limiting number sku's right focus profitable use raw ingredients. yeah, going find shortage certain ways plenty overall. ie, might find cucumber gatorade since focusing red yellow grape. marie calendar limiting 15-20 popular pies instead 100 whatever normally do. quantity (or pretty close it) focused smaller number items.

Even infect 3 days vaccination vaccine doesnt protect much, body slowly began produce antibodies cells. production ramps up, day 3 day 14 protection levels rise plateau. protection level keeps rising timeframe, reaches peak around day 14. 2nd shot needed keep protection level high. computer big enough many windows, could barely fit 95 :( I'll making appointment soon let me. Already got flu shot weeks ago well. Got flu shot Saturday, like last umpteen years article, sounds like China may already done defunct farms. think holi fucked india pretty bad, lot family members partying hard 1-2 weeks giant curve spell name Land Moran. Pfft. Everyone knows using Windows 2000. Yeah meeting WEEK later? can’t meet next day? lot important things got going on?  two close relatives POTS. agree everything said. Even getting diagnosis hard. much better 5g reception cell. guess that’s what’s I’ll birthday Oh, geez. That's wanted read, par noticed yesterday, informed UK schoolchildren required mask up. 

If true...and see data is, bode well area US (the state Florida) counties like mine (Pasco) barely 51% double vaccination rate, little masking. 

I watched UK saw rates plummet, level off, hit bottom. Instead rates stubbornly stuck, better vaccinated masking areas Europe much better. 

Certainly good news all. Let's hope instead nothing, plan put action another variant arrives. Please, please so. want UK suffer Florida undoubtedly experience. Besides keeping person getting seriously ill dying, virus killed faster vaccinated person significantly faster lessens amount time propagate importantly, less chance mutate thanks shortened lifespan.

Without mandatory testing everyone constantly, impossible tell many people carrying COVID even know asymptomatic even realize it. 

The point vaccines never ""eradicate"" COVID going happen. designed lessen chance insides turning liquid shit, alveoli getting pumped organic version Aerogel thanks rampant hyaluronic acid production, keep overwhelming health care system. entire country got second dose Moderna 4 months first dose AZ. likely effective vaccine combo have. (non-US) countries mixed vaccines degree.

There's plethora studies showing vaccination extremely effective. supposed wait 8-12 weeks first vectored dose get second, though. search shows lot them. Alpha still dominate going think April May June one dose good job limiting transmission hospitalizations second doses guys talking about? last President told shit Easter 2020. still going on?!  approved US, mix-and-match done countries. generally effective getting vaccine twice, completely safe. That’s true individual level, yes, especially young people (under 25 30, say). healthy people 50 even 65 probably won’t rough go catch covid. However - issue really individual person’s risk getting covid, ultimately - it’s keeping hospitalization levels low enough hospital systems function. absolutely need bandwidth provide care people need sorts reasons - eg people break legs skateboarding, get car accidents, giving birth, etc etc. [The big surges covid we’ve put incredible strains medical systems 
that put *everyone* danger, vulnerable learn live virus, hopefully combination vaccination immunity resulting infection eventually keep surges getting bad. meantime I’m willing take reasonable measures avoid spreading covid. mental health suffered time, want live functioning society, part. fervently wish people willing get fucking vaccine could put thing behind us move fuck problem ventilation hasn’t priority United States, whether it’s funding laziness whatever. … be. 

Colder weather drives millions Americans indoors prolonged periods time — that’s always big contributor spread. … mitigation vaccination still important. don’t know trying say. Calibration case outcomes? Calibrating case outcomes? irrational. largest effect vaccination prevent catching (and transmitting) virus: [88% pfizer higher moderna, declining time though. Preventing serious illness first effect fails smaller effect: over-50 CFR dropped ""only"" 7% 2% vaccination [the 2% CFR among oldest 1/3 population vaccination absolute sure enough say ""we ignore move on"".

The pandemic's revealed 1/3 population give fuck anyone themselves. let trick 2/3 giving fuck either.  Evangelical Christians “supposed” LOTS things… Yep low immigration high emigration. perpetually shrinking. Yes, that's limitation study, can't tell things changed Delta etc. think time stop telling everyone wear masks say concerned virus wear KN95 masks protect themselves.

KN95 masks offer extremely good protection get rid difficult concept trying make everyone responsible everybody else. 1500 pretty small sample size included healthcare workers means weren’t randomly sampled entire US population, didn’t include children, didn’t include elderly, etc. thats wrong lmao sick   PA lot rural area holdouts. Everyone covid threads: shots, I'm done pandemic, variants damned!

It like that.

Or, look replies parent comment... OP, know edited title part headlines bullshit. one claims mention much rarer infections vaccinated people intrinsically misleading. Point being, colder weather draws millions Americans indoors prolonged periods time — that’s always big contributor spread. 

And yes, ventilation super important … also haven’t really dealt substantial way US. whole group tested, unlikely positives family totally misinformed, they're alarmist definitely giving fearmongering. sounds like US-based, also keep mind may confusing news UK, (or is?) hit hard Brexit-related shortages. global shortages UK additional compounding factor.

The simple answer supply chain issues causing ripple effect food industry. I've trouble finding bottled Gatorade since July, believe PepsiCo cited shortages plastic bottles part issue. Labor shortages potentially causes issues meat industry, another commenter mentioned expected shortages cereal due strike Kelloggs. affect Kelloggs products. Kelloggs products short supply, consumers shift brands, products turn short supply (since can't ramp production immediately). Brands also sometimes concentrate best selling items stop producing less popular items (for example, Coke could focus producing Coke, Diet Coke, Dr. Pepper put hold on, say, Fanta briefly) thus furthering perception shortages, even shortage design.

In short, ""ingredients"" product requires, including human labor packaging, places supply chain fail. great example current shortage Lunchables. Think much goes one Lunchable: meat, dairy, grains, drinks, branded candies like Reese's, require one type packaging (the plastic film, plastic tray, cardboard exterior), human labor involved, etc. I've read demand increased Lunchables due overworked over-stressed parents, course they're disappearing shelves.

And *then*, top that, commodity transportation costs rising. 

All all, incredibly complex many, many causes, varies locality industry. best continue shop normal flexible possible. 5G never kicked in. bullshit. asking source.

You're asking source known medical issues like hypoxia? Yeah... google.com. You’ve changed claim “almost all” “a large portion”, improvement. reason long Covid mysterious right many people suffering without noticeable cause. patients visible damage organs hold onto symptoms months. far glean, still clue why.

That's entire point I'm making. Lots people making assertion 'long covid' new medical condition. point I'm making already existing medical conditions caused covid.

If go mountain climbing long term hypoxia call ""long mountain climbing"" ... deprive brain oxygen long periods time going brain damage.

This already well find studies include non-hospitalized participants, I’m itching read them. far, really data severe cases none mild/asymptomatic ones.

I think one things concerning many 'mild' cases, hospitalize, would given oxygen due hypoxia *realizing* they've hypoxia. 

That's pretty frightening might cause many 'long covid' cases.

The point I'm trying make already know mechanism action damage caused covid really need new classification here. 19% people diagnosed  bullshit. vaccine work everyone it? you’re vaccinated, cool! I’ll take chances. sure how, choose get it, I’m putting vaccinated life danger. That’s literally saying vaccine doesn’t work.   19% people diagnosed. rest mild symptoms, reason end hospital anyway.

Source:  Even virus ""thrives"" cool, dry air, seems clear, even obvious, ventilation matters many, many times air temperature humidity.

Real-world examples: (1) plenty ""cool, dry air"" U.S.A. sky-high caseloads PLUNGED second week January second week February. (2) hand, find much cool, dry air India Brazil, yet countries devastating national Covid outbreaks ever months ago.  buy windows 11? Windows 95 many times higher! ya go bud. \#3 surprise you! athletes can't compete anymore, 

ask names Something happening pattern   Reading article thinking thing. least im Dallas, never seen one antivax person causing shit.

I'm sure happening, I'm also sure news definitely sensationalizing stuff like get views. People eat up, like tabloids back day. sounds like getting things done there.  Good news. covid chart.  number cases deaths Oct last year.  trend still massive pandemic.  

People looking trends cases.  like vaccine numbers skyrocketing.  trickle now.   long covid way got vaccinated. vaccine definitely creating neurological issues.     I’m guessing chemists wanted chemists didn’t grades doctors. Could also said would pay lawsuit.     think wonderful.  Sounds like civilized modern nation.     I've lived 7 years, pure hell. Get vaccines. long coronavirus survive tootsie roll given kid covid-19 positive person? year NY 17,962 deaths FL 32,708 specify address targeted audience. coincidence someone scrolling past headline takes news virus issue.  Minnesota.  surprising rural areas affected. colder mountains, I'm sure infections focused there. Unknown. social distanced max due risk child two children since original shutdown. fortunate jobs could first. One us quit find another job changed. 

Still, one trip dentist situations like might issue doubtful. also took month vaccines numbers dropped 10000 day hundred. delta started back 3000 day. possible, lower most, hope. Yeah, tests neurologist said see alcohol withdrawal seizures, abstain alcohol make sure keep regular sleep pattern. honest, I'd wanted give cut alcohol while, live healthier life, take way universe giving firm loving nudge right direction. far covid symptoms go feel quite lucky.  Great Britain outlier comes school masking. least Austria, Switzerland, parts Belgium, Netherlands, Finland Scandinavia currently mandating mask educational settings. 

I’m currently Norway, expect airport, seen single mask anywhere. saying it’s good bad, it’s nice think it. Unfortunately impossible avoid. got first school COVID notification heel 3 day weekend here, adult vaccinations rate 70%+ district.

Can't imagine much sooner/often we'd dealing live somewhere sane. ☹️ I'm sorry hear that. lost 20s it, heartbreaking. I'm floored know people voluntarily refuse it. husband side effects Covid vax, feels like crap every year day flu shot. felt awful second Covid shot, never side effects flu shot 🤷‍♀️ same. Caught mono 12, never again. Unlike medicines people take every day week, vaccines generally administered handful times lifetime. mRNA molecules used Pfizer Moderna vaccines especially fragile, notes, “they body day so.”

This I’ve screaming would listen year now. family members friends hesitant. People Reddit, etc. 

The analogy like use dental X-ray couple times year safe lasting damage. Get dental X-ray daily couple years might start issues. many people hear lawyer commercials drug caused latent side effects conflate pharmaceuticals. Taking chemical daily years different taking one couple times life vaccine. Seriously. want medicine, go hospital? +1
That dataset also shows 21.47% ICU beds used covid patients. I've getting flu shot since teenager (turning 30 next month). experience, flu shots usually give sore arm. However, immune systems different. Expect potential body aches, fever, chills, etc. know normal means shot working :) Yep fully vaxxed since March. side effects far. close relative mine got fully vaccinated back March. They've lot sinus issues months decided blame vaccine ridiculous me. They've also going maskless smoky bar every week since summer, along make multiple trips hospital take care aging parents, tend wear mask running errands mingling general public. guess caught case Covid point dealing long Covid sort thing. can't tell they'll fume reference things heard Fox News. refuse get booster eligible ironically sort flip-flopped seems vaccines. However, COVID spiked again, going back best way forward? Sure, might look bad...but people would live. CDC FDA sre extremely conservative authorizations, that's recognize say vaccine mixing safe despite lots data suggest perfectly safe. require bunch medical study data conducted U.S getting close getting official FDA stamp approval it. delta variant came unvaccinated country, mostly notable damage unvaccinated US. So, yeah, declared victory May, state never reintroduced mask mandate since highly vaxxed. delta hospitalizations didn’t peak anywhere close prevaccine peak, consisted mostly unvaccinated adults. they’ve dropping. regrets moving on. Netherlands increasing bit, near UK levels. Scandinavia seems completely control. (Hopefully last) Thank saying this! get weekly notices schools kid covid. send letter parents verbally harass yell staff calling inform parents kids quarantine exposure. Yet,yeh sure, let's send back. many people killed? Ok J&amp;J vaccine exists relies technology older vaccines, somehow people arguing mRNA technology new (which actually 10+ years old) still don’t take covid vaccine trust them, I'm guessing world would like get help validate got everything. know, got popcorn ready, boss anti vax company came requirement. Looks like moving up, unless caves. keep encouraging stick values. Moderna 3x actual mrna particles per shot. skipped mine 2 months. gyno said wait 3, let know. Sure enough, cycle picked right back month 3. I'm going going pretty crowded event end month, trying decide get booster. first appointment available 3 days 6 month mark. 

Man... I'm torn!  got test within two weeks? rate positive 9-15 percent. people got tested reason, entire population, number actually higher. 

The testing aso accurate due false positives negatives, better nothing. 

The vast majority people spreading symptoms usually get test. 

1 percent folks die. 

So spreading others symptoms chain continues give someone get sick like old six degrees separation. 

The delta variant worse last year too. Hear immunity alpha 60 percent. social distancing masks like 20-30. delta, like 80-95, seeing new tactics employers 100, reason 100 politics (this guy hates small business). 

So, social distancing, could killing sorts folks, death rate 1 percent high. vary least, contributing. Worse case, keeping positivity rate high, still dealing thing. 

So, way knowing directly killed someone chain. like STD, breath. 

You hard regarding positivity rate though. wells human areas animal populations, lost cause. vaccines way fix this. Kids can't get vaccines yet though, children people interact risk. 

Fauci wrong first time. Kids able get Jan next year. that, folks left antivax people can't get one due medical reasons. medical people woods virus runs course due antivax folks. course natural immunity vaccinated. 

The game changed delta, even vaccinated spread even get it. 

The next reprieve children getting delta specific vaccines better treatments. already seeing good things happening hospital band death due that. 

So candy dress worth that, Fauci irresponsible said open back vaccine adults, he/CDC said masks work. 

What sucks ready Thanksgiving Christmas either kids able get November, means Jan really start going back normal. 

Those us counties 40 percent vaccination rate hear think, yeah right Fauci. Must nice living DC New York without kids. news: also induces mutations mammalian cell lines, presumably mechanism (but necessarily), possibly carcinogenic, potentially bad fetuses. 

Is confirmed? thought still hypothetical concerns point. different year year, worst I've ever flu shot sore arm mild muscle achiness. considering J&amp;J vaccine exists (which uses old technology) moot point first place Great job NZ

Should standard everywhere Masks barely thing half continental Europe point. never flu shot considering year. side effects similar COVID shot? COVID vaccine decimated 2 days. definitely worst felt years (worse time I've flu recent memory, honestly). Would flu shot pose risk similar side effects? Progress getting people vaccinated still painfully slow pace. Vaccine adoption across US highly uneven. inclined believe risking regional flare ups infections winter. overall new cases falling sharply, anywhere near June levels probably getting January. Government catching them, seen several stories Well opposite situation. 
In case higher ups continued work office legally able to. 
They forcing rest us come in. 
It neat see quickly things spread, live I’m number one worst state (infection rate wise) country.   owo knew viruses 1918. tobacco mosaic virus named 1898.

Walter Reed confirmed via elimination mosquitos Yellow Fever Virus carried mosquitos 1900s. Virology may still it’s infancy, basis virology going pandemic. Well pandemic compare to?

There 4 influenza pandemics since 1918, beginning 1957, 1968, 1977, 2009.  due respect, I’m fine original goalposts. 

To clarify (and asked),

The article says behavior key. quoted article. replied *ventilation* mattered most. explained *behavior* matters most. moved goalpost. … equivocated. 

Now, we’re (mostly) page. ;) waa meant bring super power make soup goo I'm still waiting. one flu, flu pandemics past century. extreme severity like like Spanish flu - spread world deadly. one, ""Russian Flu"" 1889 may actually coronavirus. diseases involved go away, first year two consistently severe deadly, subsequent outbreaks lesser magnitude involves less morbidity mortality. Unless international travel stopped, population density irrelevant. global virus. Pfizer vaccine shown ~50% effective reducing transmission 6 months, hence boosters. point is, regardless vaccination rate, COVID would still spreading, spreading.

That's say anything bad vaccination suggest vaccinating better, simply say playing blame game - data suggest mass vaccination still ""defeat"" COVID - unnecessary. accomplishes nothing. model country mass vaccinate still low case death rate, would different conversation.   mean worse that... Disconnecting PCA taking drip cup later use. Definitely also seen sickle cell trait thrown trying get opioids. risk DL also nursing license. COVID first dose need extremely high level protection; timeline apply it. second dose harmless may required full vaccination, measurably anything you. thoughts mixing boosters/original immunizations? got Pfizer, know Modern better Delta. Obviously booster better none it’s possible I’d want whatever effective. PCP said neuro said that’s plan. Still fence.  Office. Leadership went home butt we're still plugging away. Morale.. .. I'm even sure word means anymore. arguing.

Cool. I’ll stick original goalposts.

Something like 70% Americans identify Christian home church (i.e., least partially practicing Christians). 

And 70% American adults gotten least one dose vaccine.

So even unvaxxed Christians, would still mean majority Christians must vaccinated. MT weeks ago, nobody wore masks. I'm surprised rise.   fucking confused. go church like that? Whereas try best shit person go church..

I ask I'm CT vaccination rates fantastic (69.4% fully vaccinated) versus FL (58.2% fully vaccinated). Add limited mask wearing pressure family gather large groups celebrate holiday gorging mass quantities food think seeing spike/peak Christmas Thanksgiving reasonable expectation. hope better, but... Florida all. seem habit choosing option creates chaos disruption. Blind leading stupid. ICU still capacity, victory fucking talking about? reason chiropractors allowed conduct business expressly claim practice medicine. loophole law protects prosecution. think CNN worst this. See article Apple News, complete nifty-looking graph thumbnail, open it, wall text ads, easy find information, there’s graph!

I get y’all (CNN) need make money get clicks, c’mon. least give graph. [Here's review - short, really good symptomatic infection variants, efficacy infection depends behavior testing practices that's varies studies.

tl;dr; efficacy remains high, even mild moderate cases, high severe disease, solid evidence waning. need worry booster, harm getting one either, even though bit speculative. It’s ignorance, it’s purposeful disinformation/trolling.    It’s *definitely* that. anti-S (and anti-N) EUA’d antibody serology tests undergone cross-reactivity testing, sensitivity specificity testing, etc — get approval begin with.  said “scroll.” scroll phone using thumbs? know ;) dead thread is…the better Yeah, look Alberta want see plays out. excitement dropped read extremely high potential mutagenesis, meaning (unlike vaccine) actually alter DNA potentially cause issues cancer.


Source: worse L.A, thankfully. county brought mask mandate back soon cases started rising July, LAUSD requires masks weekly testing students staff, see much impact school starting. Judging near-total compliance mask mandate despite enforcement, think lot people care.

Places take steps though? Yeah, got hammered. Thnaks. loose Lego pieces get anyway? originally assembled Falcon smashed up? bought new Windows computer. can't rule mind control. doctor won’t give flu shot yet? got mine CVS like 2 weeks ago bad I’m far past point caring others vaccinated? got vaccinated 6 months ago trust protect me. People vaccine still catch transmit virus it’s like ever go away even 100% vaxxed rate. Get vaccine don’t really dgaf. want extra protection get it. want risk sure don’t care. Let’s go back normal move I've diligently getting flu shot every year probably close decade now. I've gotten flu two three time, times I've bedridden 36 hours. friends get flu shot usually completely knocked 5 days. 

I assume mild (but still awful) cases due flue shot. Pfizer 8-12 weeks AZ perfect. 80s Minnesota. Don’t worry. got Bezos chip vaccine haven’t anyone control brain once.

I'm saying taste Russian government's medicine people buying anti-vaccination propaganda since government working hard spread West. agree Russians trust government.  Delta variant lethal sure doesn’t mean it’s much threat healthy young people. That’s definitely big part it, yeah.  Also Delta seems like may target younger people little OG covid, that’s hard say sure. bottom line [more people died covid 2021 given third deaths year people 65, that’s lot younger, working-age people dying That’s real question, right? article says cases 10% last week week. Looks like Pennsylvania sitting around ~5,000 new cases per day.  already know large portion “long covid” associated damaged caused severe covid…All well within existing body medical science.

And asking source. 

You’ve changed claim “almost all” “a large portion”, improvement. reason long Covid mysterious right many people suffering without noticeable cause. patients visible damage organs hold onto symptoms months. far glean, still clue why.

If find studies include non-hospitalized participants, I’m itching read them. far, really data severe cases none mild/asymptomatic ones. Rising what?  Tell Dale Gribble

AKA - ""Arlen's Smoking Bandit"" russians don´t use facebook russian social media.

They don´t trust governement good reasons. case backfires. think every surgeon surgical nurse running around constant staph infection?! got better.  pandemic infections low enough global control measures necessary full four years. disappear naturally.

They also provide immunity wanes time. got pfizer recent reports se drop 4 months, 6. I'm 6 months end month, semi cautious bad thing. 


There's 'pretending covid existent locking basement. 


Simply pointing things over. Ahh, yes, get point.

It fair say that, vaccine prior asymptomatic infection, technically ""long covid"" even actual real set symptoms that's similar.

On hand, definitely understand people understand subject well, miss detail. First, hope get better! 

It seems lost smell return caused covid killing receptors nose initial infection.

It's taking people 6 months though might rush back. freak though!

Obviously talk doc issue brain fog. maybe statistics skewed old people taken vaccine? That’s secondary immune responses work.  10 months think basically same. moderna spent rough 8 hours bed. words made up?

No. already know large portion ""long covid"" associated damaged caused severe covid.

There's formal definition ""long covid"" going decomposed smaller diseases associated disease.

We ALSO know people think mild cases actually severe cases hypoxia symptoms misleading. 

All well within existing body medical science.  WEather cooling down. CO decent Vax rate comparison states, quite many cases/deaths per capita imagine there's large % pop little/no immunity. 

Delta find all. article: COVID-19 rates finally falling wave nearly bad one last winter. Hopefully, worst experts warn start acting COVID-19 over, definitely Behavior major impact happens virus, people stop taking precautions, start gathering large numbers getting vaccines boosters, another wave could strike “A lot depends human behavior, human behavior pandemic hasn’t served us well,” CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said recent call reporters. “We battling ourselves, common virus causes COVID-19 thrives cool, dry air. people gather indoors, especially unmasked, likely transmit it. really wants hang relevance. released data yet?

Yes, know people extended complications Covid hospitalization. However cannot claim Long Covid result Covid hospitalization data non-hospitalized patients. Still getting booster Friday! FDA’s Vaccines Related Biological Products Advisory Committee meetings come less month U.S. regulators authorized Covid booster shots Pfizer BioNTech’s vaccine wide array Americans, including elderly, adults underlying medical conditions work live high-risk settings like health grocery workers. Gets thinking lot. Currently reading news checking studies. think need 5 months passed 2nd dose. Since Trump cares change campaign slogan ASS: 
America’s Sadistic Seditionist Pennsylvania also well vaccinated though, I’m surprised see cases rising there.  Despite dominant narrative media, unvaccinated reason continues. thinking died August Isreal hit *record number* cases. vaccine works extremely well, effectiveness preventing COVID-19 falls long-term, virus continues mutate get through. Even population vaccinated months ago, would've prolonged recent spike cases.

Despite many countries coming together fight covid beginning, mean mean remain fractured. Stop blaming others and, instead, focus yourself, first paragraph details. Others getting vaccinated long-lasting bearing covid. time stop blame game. Sure. Google list potential COVID symptoms, basically throughout week intense sickness. longer term less serious symptoms.

Well, we've phase 3 trials well understood drug. week every symptom.

I understand part. Could rephrase? many papers long covid know people lung scaring intubation hypoxia cause medical issues. 

So arguing already know. Waiting actually better. end waiting couple months, fine. Everyone vaccine die./s Anti Vax folks date. food shortage. They're hearing toxic combination social media bad local news reporting. know getting information.  area shortages US due mostly shipping/warehouse staffing gets blown weird conspiracy sites. Go grocery store around (and I’m small town) shelves jammed full. Might stray items hard get petty much everything full point spill empty spaces. 

As far cargo ships theres backlog processing them. complete customs processes it’s business usual. problem shortages massive amounts stuff arriving time.  N=1.. personal anecdote science. idea dysautonomia/pots associated covid directly.

If know science stick foot mouth. SARS pandemic definition four years major pandemic still ongoing 40 years later (HIV/AIDs)

Does HIV qualify pandemic endemic? Someone said meijer short food went today found everything except something really random stock. I’m guessing went Saturday afternoon…

Also, don’t think meijer lower stock would 5 years ago. always trouble things oos there. hospitals across country

In specific geographies poor vaccination rates. Lets pretend case places. worth remembering average, ICU's 70% full times, although varies season. That's pre-COVID"
