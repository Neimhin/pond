0,2021-01-14," wrong it? English first language. leave people understand. could natural seem fishy. Either way don’t know take years know. hope least pass bills restaurant employees see corner.  would bet it’s legal. doesn’t mean wouldn’t employees would feel could contest it. work still going office? I've working home since March last year Australia. mandatory go back they've deemed extremely minuet risk might get ill worth it. can't believe anyone honestly believes mask mandates gone year. measles pandemic since late 1400s...still around.

Smallpox declared 'eradicated/eliminated' 1980. Everything else mentioned meet 'pandemic' status controlled medically. I'm referring something like we're experiencing massive spread exponential growth. nothing 'biblical' references made. matter what, ALWAYS cases logged known. Therefore IFR ALWAYS lower CFR always true number. No, CFR matter nature inflated misleading. ""right work"" states like Arizona fire reason. laws place protection, thrown door manager chooses. could say closed position ""it working out."" yes, could easily get away letting someone go sick while, legal signing contract makes sense. Thank you! well kind internet friend! vaccine, produced tested Turkey got 91% meaningless efficiency scale

Lol. ever read report?  hey, gay girl happy better now! mental toll come year definitely gonna us years more. hope things continue :) Dont let downvotes get down. cant say anything vaccine get downvoted. 

Having vaccine great unknown long term effects enough make people question blindly take rather make informed decision. 

My concern younger people longest term possible side effects. Remember even infographic someone posted, RNA vaccines new thing done. long term effects TBD.

And call anti-vax quite opposite. family date vaccinations except one. sitting one well. wait conventional vaccine.  Lol, im probably slightly average. proud username. Thanks. It’s just, you’re taught care. You’re taught feel others, you’re taught shouldn’t sit quietly see people wrong. speak up, world gets better good people good things.

You try give back, contribute, inform.

And that’s start. try posting friends pages information. see other, popular, people taking stand receiving good feedback think too. try advocate have, knowing it’s much, bit it’s something. hope you’re positively affecting corner world.

But month goes by. Three months go by. 9 months go by. entire time, you’ve received less engagement. Nobody cares. People ignore you, mock you. loose good friends they’ve given whatever paranoia people falling for. swear good people, can’t look false believe something harmful, crossed line accused disgusting things. see playing information like it’s game. use tragedy push agenda. don’t care they’re flippant people’s lives, get upset call you’re unreasonable. 

You see protests. struggles. thing balance caring world around good bitterness begun grow you. You’re stressed people work aren’t taking things seriously. Maybe good employer cares, maybe don’t, know plenty coworkers think everything kkk big deal. see kids you’re charge making light something that’s personally affected you, knowing isn’t fault they’re largely parroting parents’ lack care. 

And burn out. happened me, last week, terrorist attack. made handful steamy posts days, gave up. I’ve got shit need do. things take care of, problems. 

Just like that, you’re like everybody else. don’t mean care what’s going on, now, honestly cannot give energy something people aren’t willing listen lost friends, weathered insults. Maybe ui even lost family conspiracy, disease.

And hope somebody else gets point got to, feel like nice kind isn’t going shit, aggressive vocal going kill heart attack, way things change people experience suffering they’re mocking. rest them?

Do also dismiss people's livelihoods basic human right assemble guests home little inconveniences?  sad live dictatorship respect basic human rights. 3 million Muslims Chinese concentration camps, yeah trust tell us single covid death population billion. Wearing mask exhausting? yet. China Indonesia.   Role playing could get, like normal sex? take Covid seriously, I’d never want Lol, hear yea. detriment also. Cliche sounds takeing step back minutia tedium life/work possible. used hypomanic workaholic whod live 2 days jerky, red bull, Marlboro 100s. Shit ive gone 3 months without day off. bad drink some. Madness. really good point.  Taking mask desk doesnt violate rule.  job told us wear mask youre within 6 feet someone common space.  

It violation probably big reason covid keeps spreading.  youre indoors never take mask off.  virus stays air hours moves well beyond 6 feet time would honestly stay 30 minutes bring friend I'm alone, that's me. probably fine 15 tho. worth fucking idiot?? Germany / Bavaria, FFP2 masks mandatory certain places. sufficiently available. 2021-01-15 god damn early 40's. that's really scary. 36 year old, early 40's soo young. Pretty sure government gives money companies universities conduct scientific research.  definitely point there. 

But thought vaccine affects way attached lung cells specifically. 

I also thought hiding cells result immune system able find know vaccine alert immune system respond it. 

Please chime anyone, correct I'm wrong provide info this. agency noted “all deaths recorded among elderly people age 80 years weak immunity.”

“These cases alarming. clear vaccine small risk factor, exceptions comes elderly patients suffer poor health,” Norwegian channel “RK” quoted agency’s spokesman Steinar Madsen saying. Sounds like pretty decent role playing. could fun. ever tried latex rubber hood? actually uncomfortable, part experience.  sickness (roughly) 50% asymptomatic rate, 15% hospitalization rate 3% mortality rate, it’s going take knowing dozen people see impact oneself. Georgia see less less people wearing mask. Why, stroke white man ego? Gtfo. ISNT GOVERNOR PUTTING RESIDENTS LOCKDOWN FINING PPL DONT WEAR MASKS SOCIAL DISTANCE reinfected. herd immunity thing might work hope I’m too. military, majority don’t care. know won’t going home anytime soon I’m want give trying know fucking nothing, dude who's never China. fucking grew there. People criticizing government creative ways. vocal visible ones also happened piss wrong people disappeared. get post verify that.

Nevermind, allowed lol what’s killing since last March. It’s devastating know health care professionals 1-don’t understand works, 2-can’t inconvenienced protect patients coworkers. I’ve tried convincing several NURSES going bars gathering friends isn’t safe. I’m infectious disease expert, know  can’t imagine anyone actually following hook-up partner wearing mask lol

Least sexy thing me.

Maybe wear bane mask play role playing. We're going hit 400K covid deaths US tomorrow. count article goes thru Dec. 26, include deadliest days since then. hesitate speculate final death toll well half million widespread vaccine distribution. free market handling it, vaccines would go highest bidder. 

Effectively, since government really *hasn’t* handling it, free market is. 

I don’t think need elaborate who’s gotten vaccine first US. That's sound though I'm vaccinated, stick cloth masks protect around me? Shut dick. achievement way look it. 

Also, 29 million people live Texas children don’t qualify. Great formatting! Sure, man, every time talk mom, public security pointing gun head. Totally legit. saveragejoe Ive too, though im lower risk ER doc. fastidious wearing n95s since march so, im unwilling throw lot roommates doubt vigilant am. young healthy unwilling risk deadass tired 3+ months find 10 years ive increased risk parkinsons ten fold stroke take huge hit kidneys, etc. 

You protect others grocery store, get home, amongst 2 3 4 people care world, youre like “whatever”? Id wear mask inside simply sake cat, doesnt say health-fate.

Also, mutations, possible get infected, take unknown toll lungs heart, etc, feel fine, get reinfected second round really permanent damage. drawing point thats real possibility. vigilant even fail, maybe covid gets one shot you. 

Im solitary person nature naturally chafe sort peer pressure, great assets situation. people trying bargain popular opinion, even person isolated new years tell friend asks “oh, invited thing tired reason hour away, ended flaking” real reason avoiding indoor exposure. Nobody wants percieved unreasonable fear slave. cant bargain physics. People seem preoccupied mental state: dont let fear rule you, dont become neurotic— imagine going scuba dive bargaining dive master: yea take regulator break im there? Maybe want smoke eat ham sandwich? Surely youre little neurotic suggesting keep air hose pie hole entire 2 hour dive? Exasperated dive master: keep regulator mouth long youd like breathe, good luck smoking underwater. 

Also noticed cavalier people frontline healthcare workers: wont quit, insinuating would tantamount running away battle moment call comes charge. quit theyre forced 10x work 10x risk pay population totally callously outsourced entire problem entire year. dont single bad thing say frontliner quits anytime fiasco, especially now. 

Even covid, young people tendecy say: fuck old age, id rather die. old age comes cling life like mortals are. think bowed, shuffling 80 year old finds solace fact 90% 80 year olds bowed shuffling? No, look strong 80 yr old health freak still snowboarding grandkids say: man, wish id done way. 

In short: wearing masks house means rational grasp going on. Covid physics transmission doesnt give endothelium-torching fuck percieve “reasonable” draw ignorant, entitled, dufus line. “Virus! declare thee unreasonable! proceed wish, thou wonst smite thou knowest thy unjust unreasonableness!” Virus, fucking endothelium: “yea, keep talking crazy shit, im almost there!”

Also exasperating fact virus required little actual adjustment imagination discipline. wanna continue party hook up: pull party, slam bottle wine car, (n95) mask, go party ass off. Want drink more, pop car (being careful sobering driving off, course). Place alcohol table outside patio. no, fellow partiers wont take kindly mask, dont want party wearing mask themselves, conform like coward are. 

People cant go way, even solid, scientific justification cannot reasonably imagine ever right side history’s great dividing lines. would ratted jewish neighbors nazi germany, would kept savaged slaves antebellum south— “reasonable” positions take time, even though real motherfucker knew even back then.

When hear people say: wearing masks inside! Thats bridge far!— talking to? virus? recall opening lines jack london’s white fang: “Dark spruce forest frowned either side frozen waterway. trees stripped white covering frost, seemed lean towards other, black ominous, fading light. vast silence reigned land. land desolation, lifeless, without movement, lone cold spirit even sadness. hint laughter, laughter terrible sadness— laughter mirthless smile sphinx, laughter cold frost partaking grimness infallibility. masterful incommunicable wisdom eternity laughing futility life effort life. Wild, savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.” Thats nature virus, “attitude” towards pathetic bargaining. Frozen-hearted laughter. look rakish bandanna, jesse james. Lolololol.

Ive got bottle sauv blanc belt. Good day, good day all. he's coming back 2024 Half family shot speak truth. naive Germany's deaths per 100k people US's deaths per 100k people. Germany competent leadership US terrible leadership, end place? withdraw, still part study, “unblinded” probably asterisk next name. study run hospital, employees contacted email went participants saying offered vaccine, please call us unblind you. think cases slowly relatively steadily initial holiday wave settles later month. Deaths drop quickly mid-March assume 11 million particularly at-risk worse outcomes. know plenty front-line health workers bet beyond 50% nursing home otherwise 75yo+ crowd.

My take - I’m qualified particularly interested, too. Talking percent people vaccinated. insane much 10-50 million dollar bussinesses got money last time...and many 10-50 million dollar businesses actually off-shoots larger companies simply rich ass dude ""making"" fictional 5 man company could get money.

&amp;nbsp;

Incredibly wasteful. guess point. fought bill would ton oversight ""so get dispensed quicker"" instead ton rich people companies gobbling up. whole thing sucks many levels. lived house crazy nurse mom back July managed avoid getting two-week bout virus.  stayed away washed hands like crazy. hello! question us friends, vaccines available general population everyone able get it? living houston work reasons right us citizenship, still able get it? Huh? talking about? Texas far ahead percentage allocated shots put arms.  People “dry tinder,” absolutely sociopathic Define ""normal"".  Shit man, wish way could help, I’m good things. starting develop drinking problem too, replaced beers non alcoholic beers (I’m even drinking non-alcoholic beers would’ve regular beers) - figured “feeling” drinking beer relevant alcohol itself. chocolate/sweets kept sane times crisis pandemic. I’ll make health loss due sugar get back normalcy... it’s lesser evils now. Also, started study yoga philosophy calms immensely - takes far away broad perspective makes easier accept reference point. don’t know, telling worked case wanted try different things :) Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I’ve talking long-term effects portion sub doesn’t want acknowledge that. want go back normal. either nature screwed us someone created perfect virus messed containment set us up. Either way, thank bringing light. Never stop fighting inform others &lt;3 Man sucks.

Here Texas it’s pretty much exact opposite attitude.

Not great spread rn come Spring I’ll happy sure. Sorry youre loss dude, honestly. makes blood boil hearing people saying that. year, people aint gonna change, inherently flawed, worth time. Mourn aunt. Realize majority people good even though seem way. Well cusp civil war  Yes. don’t think people understand I’m trying say that’s OK afford This. Lol. Long haul covid caused virus immune system cannot fight appropriately.

The side effects vaccine caused immune system itself. immune system causes tired, causes fever, causes runny nose cough fight virus.

When get vaccine symptoms happen immune system responding meaning works. Greatly decreasing changes long haul covid.

But much I'm totally sure someone could chime would great... think goes like less 1% chance...  would eventually hit herd immunity though right, people getting vaccinated + eventually get Covid? well fitted cloth mask (preferably multiple layers filter) perform better surgical mask without fit improvements like twisting loops (I make multi-layer cloth masks using procedure mask filter layer, with, I've noticed freezing weather, far fewer air gaps husband wears procedure mask modifications). There's many factors say simply surgical mask worn person always better every cloth mask, though well fitted surgical mask gaps well managed certainly better even best no-filter cloth mask, far better loose bandana - unexpanded surgical mask propped loosely tip nose seal around sides top post-it note stuck end nose, see rather often places like Costco let store without one people actually want wear one. 

This recent JAMA paper describes modifications raise filtration surgical mask 38.5% 80.2%, well ranking various non-medical masks filtration (nose crimp? Layers? Material?).
  ignore human behavior, always incorrect data. pretending 'data' correct, formula solutions hopelessly corrupt.

Wealthy people isolate poor must work social situations. presentation data include fact. deserves LOL. (Reuters) - hospital system Amazon city Manaus collapsing second wave COVID-19 running oxygen, Brazilian Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello said Thursday. Speaking webcast President Jair Bolsonaro side, Pazuello said city’s hospitals short medical staff deaths surge again. sounds like you’re trying make people feel like greedy selfish. someone passionate volunteering, that’s pretty negative.

Maybe donate time trying make people feel bad themselves. 

I volunteer advice free. 😉 clearly know nothing lmfao underlying medical condition? also world nine five. work hours totally fucks ability run errand.

one friends runs small business lamenting ups stores closing earlier really messing ability get anything done. 52 million doses administer, then. rate, every Texan receive vaccine 2024! saw something someone recommended putting mask safe sex

Anyone try that

Is shitty think would work competing grocery chain. didn’t even want give us hazard pay union demanded it.  still true. region, time, could end coronavirus weeks really wanted to. don't.

I say 2 weeks. NZ took 6. rewatched Contagion third time. R=0 (the r naught) Covid new strain? Meh, oh well. Businesses important human lives. WWI well, basically meat wall. “Not sure downvoted” lmao  ticket? Lol, screw 70,000 people Moderna Pfizer trials 20 years research SARS MERS vaccine. “Untested” ass work home? friends home? many people household work outside home? also know people gotten essential workers. 

I accept clearly privileged position. I’m among them. tested positive 2nd. “recovered” lingering fatigue still cough congestion chest. also 99% sure last February well. spreading much earlier people think. Well going suffer state lockdown might well bars open. Well remove curfew one everyone cramming supermarket time. Shouting social media abyss first 3 months so

Imagine stupid unironically this. hivemind doomfest reddit exceptionally tiresome point. subs COVID doomer central point. Pick sub, say r / XXXXXX good chance sub riddled discussions XXXXXX never possible again. drowning interesting content. Yawn. even read linked article?

Maybe read definition confirmed cases vs clinically diagnosed cases (without PCR confirmation positive scans) vs suspected cases. clearly outlined Chinese CDC documents available public time.

The published numbers confirmed cases nearly identical super “secret” leaked” document.

Since Chinese, live China? family acquaintances say? People flooding hospitals dying street?

If actually live it’s ridiculous would rather believe CNN report rather eyes hate CCP.  conspiracy theory BS.

What true data proving prevents spreading it. that's nobody's tested it, would test it? learned now. way I’m wearing mask home! did. Current administration forever known games played putting economy lives. So, so, many lies... lives lost power money. Would hate always remembered way. think freedom would lost! 🤪 Get vaccine?  find people scared virus ones say won’t get vaccine. I’m wondering fall. virus like many never knew it. think that’s virus runs past dropped guards feel health. Wear mask live life unless poor health. Jmo rate they're vaccinating people. Trader joes always goat mean, else knows effects better participants themselves? Anyone lets fear virus consume fool. ever happens happens right thing fine(still always case). I’m still living life normal can. living seeing real life, need redditor fearmongering misleading articles Could elaborate please? I’m curious downsizing. Good thing there's much fresh air LA County scarred lungs. COVID never go away. pandemic end, however COVID remain (likely version. Fuck paywalls. Test-and-trace ass... can’t say anything SK. definitely what’s happening Japan.
I work sushi restaurant manager got tested positive couple days ago. Guess what? still came workplace test results, took 3 days. coughing pretty badly past week. diagnosis, one restaurant asked tested. contact tracing whatsoever.
I fear already infected several coworkers, including myself. Since always pull mask nose. trump quote sorry love Trader Joe’s polite employees. already quit paramedic make money working home closer family farm. Good luck y’all. bet like bars open Congress tax spend general welfare...  people nuts lmao don’t want vaccine? Despite Brexit UK still European nation. also fucked twice. 🚀🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 Fair align party  Go Joe   become smoker 😛 detailed article names specific Come Bloomberg!! 11.8 million! taste freedom coming back! Trader Joe's good throughout this. avoiding grocery stores opting delivery going quickly small neighborhood markets, happily stand line get Trader Joe's (and always stand line get there, take capacity restrictions seriously me). Presumably numbers complicated confusing. especially stupid UK lot sequencing hence large numbers variants first identified - far proof originated there, especially view lax way quarantine handled long time. Well.... maybe prioritize didn’t get virus yet vaccine? think data grow show it. articles studies coming showing lungs COVID survivors look like smokers. That’s gonna impact long term survival rates. idea maybe close pandemic they? Perhaps trying help? System fan made whole lot sense, actually. Also would divide heat air conditioner? can't understand. even human? agree 100%. long family safe, gets vaccine correct timelines, longer care greater good everyone else seems benefit sort people die. current rate, 750k+ dead little year.  Bro, I’m dentist. I’m around shit average person take infection control seriously. suggest drive thrus risky behavior closed? wear KN95 mask shop go one Ohh sucks! would pissed made come back office now. I’m Brit pushing knowledge USN think it’s probably chosen committee opposed POTUS. 

USN ship names pretty boring whole they’re mainly named people (lots interesting people pretty boring names). There’re pretty cool Royal Navy names like HMS Dragon HMS Vengeance. Right? I'm like, never seen someone smoke something seen far smoke spreads long takes dissipate??? People weak 3 people job ventilators! 100 employees! 😰 thought vaccine catches new variant? careful that. 45 claimed random dude told us he'd drain swamp. want peoples' individual choice more? selfish catching coronavirus yet? shit, one party currently giving handouts people desperately need rn, gave literally trillions bail companies need it, even churches got millions. Yeah, would make “his numbers look bad”. 

Good thing avoided whole debacle. Numbers look great now. /s another article days ago said 50%  love HEB always give money. Rockport mobile relief centers Hurricane Harvey FEMA even got there. I'd wager might something Houston medical center largest world. whole state Texas likes claim victories own. See ""moon landing"". family going fucking Disney World. beyond pissed. seriously audacity say airport risky grocery store.

I would love go Disney World, risking health that. shitting memory almost 400,000 dead people part problem. America way similar Canada New Zealand? Canada closer average, New Zealand outlier? Hey Utah friend! Yeah numbers hardly get rise anymore. check cases, positivity rate death ages like yup shit. believe technical capability quickly update vaccine.

Uhm, look title: Moderna believes could update coronavirus vaccine **without big new trial** work Covid field hospital, still haven’t gotten vaccine yet. count lucky. I’m sorry. tip 25%. worth it. Lmk you’re Boston area I’ll request possible!  north Seattle? peak far I've hospitalized briefly summer Covid. coils lot worse. average case kicked arse. Makes mad (and sad too) people take seriously worse say fake. Herd immunity mean everyone got virus. means enough people immunity effective reproduction rate &lt;1 per transmitter, case virus must die infecting everyone. China list? think mean 2000 years. mean yeah it’s Still good start. 640 people day! That’s actual good news Well course. ND 64% doses given according dashboard yesterday expect still #1. following protocol already live though everyone outside household infected. general population infection rate really affect me. Oh boy.
You ask doctor also see behave office hand pen back lol. Yep, part things stuff. bit good moment, getting management plans place knock infection rate manageable levels important. national lockdown, need plan laid way, hour hour ""surprise! lockin it"" Oh see. Relying temperature isn’t stopping cases. like mount rushmore style honour, ie given future president? Anybody know thinking extending pause student loan interest? I’d like know put money set aside Roth IRA. I’m hoping it’s September like eviction moratorium is. ... shouldnt assume. I'll assume didnt even read reply Lol work pharmacy grocery store. Employees,including pharmacy staff, can’t get vaccine without reservation, gone within seconds going live, basically allowed “what ever left over.” end getting isn’t used.


Given 65+ calls got today asking vaccine think it’s safe say employees SOL time being. Yes! happy you! Vaccine distribution hasn’t funding issues. can’t fix everything throwing money it. Wear mask careful can. I'm pretty low list health concerns too. comfort all, understand feel. That's awesome.

Loved TJ years, love now.  remember little tricky heat up. Microwaving stirring times. also fairly easy make home frozen spinach artichoke hearts. America officially broken. worst president modern history opponent still cheat win. Trump turfed record numbers. Americans like this? Florida open since June worse (in fact one could argue better off) rest country. Ron DeSantis model adopted worldwide.  best snacks least pretends care workers? I'm sold. ugh Oh yea forgot Economy.

This issue. People bring ""The Economy."" easy fix. Give monthly stipends everyone stay home. work there, let elderly infirm without wait. spice melange. wish worked you!  virus crushed vaccines (yay science!) Karens ones still whining mask wearing social distancing

When virus crushed vaccines, masks still worn lot people (myself included) like many parts world. Karen behavior. aren’t using per capita point worthless. I’m really tired comparing modern day pandemic time large city 50k people we're going back increased unemployment aid, seems like might well tell people stay home again. Remember Walmart shop way signs? It’s like Wild West Walmart again. work TJs. count many people physically store communicate door helmsman. done least 2-3 times per hour. full go one one out. taken *really* seriously store.  world deadly pandemic, strict mask Karen behavior. whole last year I've seen many anti-mask, anti-distance types try weaponize ""Karen"" insult advantage. Karen someone thinks they're entitled attention others get whatever want always--that's anti-mask behavior, pro-mask. cardboard, stick knife’s handle underneath flaps, torque towards you. It’ll open box like letter opener envelope. Lmao fault friends nothing back 🤣 one hates Trader Joe’s? 
Everything boxed processed none snacks sell good don’t really good fresh produce meat lacking. quarter square feet store shitty alcohol. Brie cheese low quality well. Also it’s super small there’s always people carts trying get standing around shit show. make mine. couple times year obvious reasons.

I'm guessing e-mails cover inevitable lawsuits. nooooooooooooo There’s reason you’re lonely. Lmao support virus? check Seattle sub lol Anecdotal evidence: 4 friends living house. One got COVID 3 instead asking/forcing quarantine never leave room, decided solidarity stay in-house together included normal in-house activities.

2 weeks later, 4 went get test...and surprise surprise, 1 (the one got first) positive COVID 3 never caught it.

Another separate friend got COVID partner assumed get COVID well 2 quarantined together, kissed, sex, etc....and getting tested, friend tested positive partner didn't.

The virus super weird. look up, min wage way excessive. $7.75 increase gonna throw economy wack years passes. hobbits spread it. wrote ""snot nosed kids"" kids synonymous children. See post above. don’t want keep moving move fast Exactly. American mindset ""me me, money, 'right' wear mask, comfort"" maddening. leaders acting like monkeys, large portion society followed suit, government really pull shit together, we're going stay alive That'd certainly much less harmful. can't speak Trader Joe's. work supermarket chain New England. donate produce/meat/bakery items local food banks. 

We receive tax credit based give. Truthfully, documentation way access things home even could, post images without authorization without risking losing job.

That said... example organization takes donations tax deductible...so obviously thing, even Trader Joe's take advantage.
Any product given away can, theoretically, written charitable donation
 Also...your link said NOTHING stores donating food tax write off. people looking get something Trader Joe's, like local fire departments looking donation cookout shit. 

Did even read posted? Wow. say that, someone low sodium diet lot TJ’s pretty safe per meal standards (500-750mg). Shopping anywhere else options drop dramatically. doubt it. They're always awesome people.

So must pay well drop trash, important.  avoid galleria healthy times. Couldn’t pay drive Uptown year nurse hit vain administering flu shot entire arm felt like run over. horrible lol. vaccinated 80 employees today family owned vineyards winery, paying 4 hours first injection 4 second. totally cost effective policy, risk work disruption OSHA enforcement Covid-19 outbreak huge. admire optimism, millions starving jobless pandemic we’re still long way done with, we’ve never polarized modern history ain’t going away, executive branch isn’t tarnished, trashed trump goes town unabated, somehow shitshow saw last week support insignificant portion population, including elected officials. mention vaccine rollout shambles even knows enough people take damn thing us reach herd immunity. main sources news information npr, pbs newshour, 538.

Don’t let optimism turn complacency.

Edit: Oh they’ve sold drilling rights Alaskan wildlife refuge, amongst plethora environmentally harmful actions past 4 years. live Bakersfield

I’m sorry. people throw many tantrums lockdown? area US, mention lockdown people act like rabies. keep waiting companies realize shifts expense providing physical workspace onto employees save shit ton money office space, utilities local taxes etc. isolating workers easier control stop water cooler sharing information complaints people management less likely band together opposition policies practices. Obviously conversations still using tech become difficult easier monitor company. Another benefit employers even without covid people going less likely get sick miss work due viruses get passed around offices. 

Once surprised shortly may expect workers provide computers well. low paying jobs already do. 

For employees savings gas,wear tear vehicles simply wasting possibly hours commuting works. little tyrant type managers want job little power trip physically overseeing minions may diminish well. Ahh alternative set facts part discussion. 

For large swathes country least parts uncommon sister mother too. Normal operations suspended majority operating different rules.

Im conversation many times. Every time comes trust different sources information fact.

If cant safely maintain 6 foot distance customers unsafe number people.

The actual formula steps bit complicated but.

You know total sq footage sales floor. know floor plan. know space taken shelves, entry/exit's, areas people cannot safely total floor space. Divide 6 thats number people safely allow store. state (NYS) part conditions operate business small/medium/large know number enforce it. go number someones contact tracing brings though store god help store origin point.

So said yes opening liabilities legal risk. Trader Joe's crammed smaller spaces, help. could keep ice cream sandwiches stock I'll go back. 2 weeks PTO sick. used really want move US, kind thing makes glad didn't. that's case, vaccines widely available time open up. can't live like forever people want vaccine bad. Trader Joe’s even *food*? swear it’s snacks snacks. Salted butter chains worst offenders far enforcing masks? don’t, however, share taxes share culture. shouldn’t allow people fly country purely take advantage generosity. 😩 getting knocked around combining two different things, calling same, chirping everyone's privilege preventing seeing it.

There two different things going here.

The vaccine free.

And

People able afford taking work go get vaccine.

Those situation. Yes Trader Joe's paying employees get vaccinated, zero context cost vaccine.

Being able afford take work get people working trader Joe's indeed type privelege. privelege given employer, one inherent people talking thread.

I think right vote people give hard time without explaining why. can't tell genuinely mad troll whatever. able take work really kind privelege accurately swing around. people site probably jobs really afford take work.

Your argument government employers. hard get mad someone say they're privelaged better job employer dickhead. white shit, lot time, ya. employment? Nah dude, barking wrong people. boof it? Woah never thought I'd see people talking u-village qfc reddit thread. Actually all. There's huge difference. intramuscular versus intravenous. guess Los Angeles County show world example so... 

LA County's doubling rate 7 days. 30% infected, 60% infected week, 100% infected two weeks. guess 6 weeks we'll see death rate herd immunity be. schedule second dose get first dose. Wow peeps really shit hard question reason. don’t worry, answer you! It’s vaccines go muscles veins (/s) sequim it? bet sequim. Well restaurant/fast food establishment that’s worth damn knows turn #1 metric. plays part every single aspect business strive build relationships employees pay appropriately don’t feel need leave. It’s working 4 years 31% staff whole 4 years. 

My business literally describing towards end comment. hold high standards run business right way. tenured employees leaders least 1 working times. problem. Man. Honestly point, parents seem going antivax ""covid real"" mentality recently fucking killing me. I've probably one who's trying hardest safe house seeing start bring aunts uncles around again, hope get fucking sick. I've never suicidal thoughts point I'm done. I'm killing made promise someone special, I'm gonna fucking complain I'm one us die shit. I'm tired  CDC updated number 9.6 million. Apparently, previous number mixture 1st 2nd doses, kinda disappointing, oh well, still think 1st doses 10 million since data still lagging (especially CDC). Unacceptable trying learn stuff means super smart people know going unsubscribe subreddit genius brilliance needed elsewhere. though...

I think way, most? anger undocumented residents high last years. None shots proven 100% effective. 95% &amp; 94.5% effective preventing severe illness many weeks post 2nd shot.

This means 5% 5.5% expect lack protection even properly vaccinated &amp; immune system time try job.

no vaccine 100% effective. 

I hope Father get vaccinated sooner expected works him. getting geared get extremely bad am, people seem worst. like watching dance death. ditching masks, partying, shopping, visiting, seem care. Dollar general giving us 4 hours pay get vaccine. That’s literally In-N-Out Burgers’ business model. Seems like guy knows good way run business. what's considered good tip? bad thing want eat entire bag them, damn tasty. guys paid hourly plus tips? tip go you? things I've wondered  many thousand dollars cost? think warning up. tf downvoted trying learn? Inb4 ""google it!"". Dude asking question bunch people giving minimal information want idea US open, need disregard experts saying look politicians read political tea leaves. United States absolutely reopen well ahead experts believe things should. Time restrictions work. be: place restrictions. gyms bars restaurants sports concert. 0 activities closed places. work open places like parks beaches public health department probably end giving free vaccines private practices still charge guess That's mean way say know either :'(

Actually numbers different reported Israeli media. 
Here report number infections goes 60% 13 days first dose. 
Tracking infections hospitalizations shows even larger decline - 90%-95% decline 15 days first jab I’m reading correctly. 

The 30% number according article ratio people show antibodies serological test 15 days first shot less important actual infection data.

He's made multiple demonstrably false claims pulled extremely weak scientific precedent like:

1) Vaccinated people wear masks exposed COVID often keep immunity (based data decades lower exposure, people varicella reactivation, completely different process reinfection btw). absurd claim undermines public health goals requiring universal masking.

2) IgG responses end-all-be-all SARS-CoV-2 immune response. Wrong even pre-print loves cite, [recently shown incorrect peer-reviewed study showed IgA predominates early infection (i.e. imparting sterilizing immunity rather preventing strong reinfection). would also intuitive guess since [that case influenza [Another source

Please understand anti vaccination - vaccinations - way shape form. wanting learn understand.

*Background*

*In (South) Africa process rollout vaccination result many people congregating waiting long queues 'less ideal' sanitary social distancing conditions.*

*If 'superspreader' set conditions people vaccinated mass gathering point, many months - ramifications ?* people aren’t going lock homes covid. lot people actually first “15 days” i.e. 3 months wasn’t going last much longer. People can’t stop working year. virus people going handle fine. 

We could handled better. Protected known vulnerable. Gave good info instead conflicting info people could weigh risks know steps take protect themselves. 

We chose fear lockdowns. ultimately we’re going suffer long term society. They're going ask find job gap resume pandemic Unfortunately tells either enough information I'm getting one (*real* helpful there, IRS).

But again. wrong im defending it. might frown exaggerated West Country accents, mindful that. grocery store worked at's idea compensating us working initial lock was, kid not, putting food break room extra 10% discount. 

Once first stay home order lifted, food discount *instantly* went away. day. NZ pretty much proved possible get virus something someone covid touched ago completely ignored reason. Lockdowns obviously won’t change that. extremely petty.

If really super post-doc 25+ years experience, then

1. wasting time arguing plebeians reddit?
2. making outlandish claims like ""IgG antibodies end-all-be-all immunity comes reinfection SARS-CoV-2."" that's demonstrably false. IgA cell immunity shown critical, secretory IgA actually *more* critical early infection.

Either way, find deeply disturbing. mean guess 95% isn’t 100% hearing stories like early exceptionally rare unheard of. know 40%, lot evidence vitamin strengthens immune system. I'm glad I've taking while. wish leadership worldwide would recommend precautionary measure. know Fauci said takes Vitamin C interview, that's extent it. Yep, old frail. believe discussion point vaccinating cohort waste doses.

I believe considering vaccinating life expectancy &lt;6 months so. case case basis Perpetual covid means perpetual enforced rules lockdowns. even easier: wear mask. 

No need war, need die faraway place never heard of, need kill people never cared about, nothing. wear fucking mask. yet... Fantastic thanks! don’t know you’re talking about. That's said anecdotal evidence. 

Either 3 never got COVID 3 got asymptomatic COVID got negative COVID result.

Either way, 3 100% fine health-wise.The original COVID positive friend also 100% fine health wise 3 weeks. slow spread, since cant cut 3 recently flew Melbourne staying family regional NSW, contrast pretty funny.

In regional NSW almost restrictions, except QR codes stores restaurants, noone wearing masks. Canberra airport, wear mask terminal, actually got plane.

Then arrived Melbourne airport, greeted airport workers full PPE, masks, gloves, medical gowns, face shields. seemed little over-kill considering states recorded 0 covid cases day. factors include multigenerational households bigger households, well many Hispanic people LA jobs can’t done home. sure symptoms present, CDC say concerned. deceased frail difficult know whether death would occured anyway.

We 400 weekly deaths nursing homes, portion vaccinated succumbing shortly surprising.

Pandemic natural occurring phenomena, control speed/rate spread, spreads country it’s responsibility keep control, incompetent can’t control spread, find excuses redirect hatred towards places, ever admit mistakes controlling virus US first started? 
China announced human human transmisssion coronavirus January 20, trump announced control January 22 , “we totally control,it’s one person coming China... it’s going fine.” Mr. trumps original phrase btw. 300k cases per day blame China.

Wake fuck up, European entire Europe knows badly trump handled it. use right sources ur info, WHO/WIKi timeline COVID , probably ignorant check facts anyways .

A real message, leadership, whatever want call whatever president office, vs. abysmal response got ""dissappear Easter, etc"". anything would helped imho.

Better enforcement rules. (Businesses flagrantly disregarding shut downs, etc). 

That would good start. Obviously I'm speaking general sense, one size fit all.

Unfortunately, late that. case proves R0 important measure. R0 average, coronaviruses cluster viruses. Picture 10 people getting infected, 8 infect anyone else 2 infect 20 people each. Giving average R0 4.

Many athletes said want participate Olympics without fans. vaccinated amount Norway (33 000 - 50 000), started nurses doctors serious consequences 3 cases anaphylaxis 5 cases milder allergic reactions.

Does Israel UK (or fast countries) vaccinate old sick stats look like? loved ones die moment afterwards? know says GROCERY Doller Tree also this, good know chains making form initiative. alarmist headline could actually end working public’s health ends influencing elderly taking vaccine Woah woah woah. That's like best qfc is. huge. always stocked huge selection. Tell minion mods, even like anything written support Dr. Li.

Yes do. meats appear cheap comes smaller portions.

Just confidently talking ass shit know, eh? 👀😔🙏❤ states organizing. government paying directly. States getting reimbursed. *so* clearly company's interest employees infected Covid therefore greatest number employees vaccinated possible company really shooting foot. even enlightened self-interest. self-interest. Maybe. plan Congress still pass it. No, don’t pay anything point care. don’t get billed later. state gets whatever insurance would covered. Good everyone! :D coronavirus alarmist say least. sick. condition Norwegians talk ""severe frailty"". Think someone can't stand even eat drink hospital's ICU. Pretty sure that's straight  pay well begin pandemic they've doubled employee discount 20% upped pay extra $2/hour. started April guaranteed end March, likely continue (the end date originally end July, end year, March they've said they'll keep long Covid measures place)

They're also generally good work general started ahead even everything went crazy. state. state covers it. add there's already evidence Pfizer vaccine prevent positive PCR test: ridiculous upvotes. voodoo anti science bullshit way normalized 2021 like gun control work, despite working every developed country. One question: right enough vaccine everybody everywhere. People already got shitty virus already immune. Even vaccine gives better immunity, wouldn’t make sense set people contracted virus low prio list let people didn’t vaccine first? mean way go got enough vaccine everybody (at least Germany). 

One answers might ‘you don’t know long immunity last contracted virus’. keep vaccine speed immunity long, first one might vaccine again. want shit end ... cheaper. easier rip people get ripped off, e.g. hire somebody paying decent wage still give shit. takes away need get involved, care all, employer. basically like liquidity comes money vs capital invested funds. SME understand value existing strictly cash-flow kind world (particularly medium longer term), similarly lower income households can't bothered save money paychecks.

But can't get employee continuity without also able offer upward mobility real thing industries. Becoming manager, even multi-million dollar chain basically glorified minimum wage 2.0. Continuity workplace mobility another form caring cases. People care inherently want improve system either grow give roles they'll learn need move on.

Of course something they'd like solve magically could. solutions affect income stream, hard pass. agree. Definitely really looking forward things like again. thing appreciating fact missing miserable winter weather year. miss waiting train stations / bus stops commuting freezing cold. nice sit laptop look misery outside window! Yeah. People gotta Christmas NYE parties.

Who gonna pay rent?  Flattening curve step 1 eradication. Yes, you’ve made clear grip reality.   fucking disaster. something like even possible? Finally. second scenario international travel would never resume?

Went 85.4 per 100 tested 81. Positivity rate dropped 10.4% stay around low 9.4-9.8% past days. Hospitalizations kinda leveled past days. 

Could backlogged, chance vaccine starting work? governments everywhere shown clearly care deaths cases all, metric care hospitalization. healthcare going crash, governments obligation act. Otherwise it'll private efforts. always think story last June [16 friends celebrated birthday Florida bar. tested positive within first week bars reopening Florida. always stood sitting around table infected every single one people bar. thought different story said someone table sick first article doesn’t give source, people restaurant positive lot people fell ill right after. 

So think comes people visiting sitting around dinner table family’s home, restaurant images space tables space tables, underground clubs continue city break every weekend. numbers skyrocketing like are, people aren’t going able get dumb luck anymore it’ll become undeniable. Even worse, mayor (chicago) reopen indoor dining underground parties control thinks make spaces safer responsible owners satisfy people’s needs one give safer alternative. opinion, you’ll never satisfy need someone went cramped crowded unventilated speakeasy masks bunch strangers could care less virus behaviors like lol means make safer it’s going shock people demonstrate that’s enough feel ‘normal’ again. mean don’t know want do.

Wasn’t worth it.  case spitting shit here. think transmission occur prob low rate, early days shown Italy uses army enforce law, too. Australia kept coronavirus control. America failure people spout arguments. You’ve listening wrong experts then. “Immunity passports” haven’t considered viable option among experts since early outbreak. don’t think airlines used disinfect planes, least daily. hope change stays permanent. still don’t faith airport cleaning. took total number confirmed cases WI Worldometer (515,982) divided total population (estimated 5.86 million), 8.8%. Wisconsin averaging 3,000 per day since Christmas, even use average 3,000 per day (which peak moving average since Christmas), would expect additional 0.7% state across next 14 days. Using 4-5x estimate, would 38%-47.5% (including high estimate current near term infections tested next 14 days)

Like said, understand people might feel rates higher (especially we're assuming conservative areas WI higher multiplier based people resistant testing), 50% seems little high based calculations. I'd guess specific county even lower since much lower rates WI's peak fall. Aldi North Aldi North

Can't checked measuring antibodies? 

Seems like matter whether people previously exposed not, asymptomatic not... measure whether people vaccinated shedding virus not, _regardless prior history._ 

If got vaccinated shedding virus would mean A: vaccine stops infected people transmitting virus B: person never virus first place there's nothing shed C: both

Any A, B, C fine outcomes answer question. feel terrible people make call situations like this. would agonize forever to. Well come club yes that's inflation *that* bad. hyper inflation hand.... And? 

Your original question many people 45 smoke, answer nicotine one addictive substances earth, I'm confused point trying make here. said multiple variations evolved B117 simply identified UK one (without providing evidence).

I never said fact wrong. *Different* variants *different* genomic sequences happen share certain mutation makes infectious, much way two different people gene blue eyes. Still waiting articles say variations converged B117 UK one one first identified. know won't, still despite asked hours ago

Again, never said that, want sassy, here's evidence actually said: suspected UK, South Africa Brazil variants could much contagious easy catch earlier three undergone changes spike protein - part virus attaches human Brazil variant emerged July three key mutations spike protein make similar South Africa result, variants seem better infecting cells South Africa variant emerged October, potentially important changes spike protein UK one mutations UK one, plus two scientists think may interfere vaccine effectiveness.

I'm suicidal, what's point living going like years end?

Its going be. sub loves doom gloom course idiotic mentality getting upvotes. America EU actually bought doses actively helped Pfizer Moderna scaling production western world would look like Israel. Instead even prebuy doses Pfizer offering, would give company money set new facilities... exactly politicians CDC wanted.

With almost single minded fanaticism focus put limiting death rate, expense almost everything else. look per capita numbers. Fine. Let’s take away drivers licenses, right vote, ect. that, I’ll accept lack mental capacity make decisions. Entirely.  President authority directly order national lock except certain circumstances.  However, position enormous amount power states ways, especially consent congress.

I think Biden would pursue authoritarian means enforcing lock down, to.

There literally huge number ways persuade, encourage, force, otherwise guide behavior states simply political maneuvering. Trump made lot people forget powerful competent President actually be.

That's states actually see reason agree stopping pandemic requires national lock down.

Trump also made people forget ""lock down"" mean authoritarian, literal imprisoning population.  asking people stay home within certain radius home, providing food rent money, arranging help problems Trump created go huge way toward effectively avoiding spread virus.

Accelerating vaccine's deployment, combination encouraging mask usage, making better masks freely available, encouraging lock downs, openly discussed national strategy ending pandemic US would make effective plan.

Remember, Biden already listening experts, including Fauci, Osterholm, others he's working plan months.


Note I'm saying Biden bestest President ever, he's going fix everything - can't, he's probably going end regarded average leader.

But Trump set expectations country bar good leadership low Biden going look like angelic savior comparison. realistically see lockdowns last literslly forever point

Not fucking chance. Hell, even locked since last June I'm at. think people continue indefinitely, rebel leave areas locked (lookin' you, LA). important, would say mostly good news. could get remaining 20% board masks, could save many lives herd immunity. could almost see abandoning hope vaccine trials failed, good vaccines clear path toward herd immunity. Mask surge that's currently underway...The pandemic probably peaked 23 states likely peak nationally end month

Actually, peak already reached nationally according (apparently controversial) view. [According infections declined three straight days (from 254.8K 243.3K per day, seven day average). last Friday highest day infections, seven day average could decline another 10K end today! Likewise, deaths flat last couple days, [hospitalizations also showing agree it’s way easier fall eating addiction smoking nowadays. think smokers included phase obese people should? Thinking purely hospital load deaths perspective, since situations cause increased risk actually don’t huge issue tbh. end day quicker deaths fall faster life get back normal, think get us quickest. definitely get frustration causes. Saying body positivity dangerous. body negativity way go? said, enough essential workers large US/European cities MUST work regardless lockdown cases go floor. 200-500 cases day relegated primarily essential workers family come contact with. vaccine help group get close zero time. I’m sorry hear that. problem seems distribution within state. state come close using vaccines hand I’ve heard counties run others sitting tens thousands doses. feds withholding second dose states shouldn’t rationing second dose  didn't, believe federal government said something like that. Pfizer said first dose 54% effective that's need second one 21 days later. body kept antibody levels time, whole weight would antibodies. level supposed decline. B cells take make antibodies quickly demand. Log scales fine. funding vaccine development medicine great. world wealthy, prioritize health lives poorer countries, enough make big changes. resources. Political decisions made regarding interest people. people informed involved, politicians care either. realistic. said literally loves insurgents, publicly. goading attack country. wife called patriots. know this, know this, much otherwise lovely sister goes idiot lane. problem starting place “who deserves vaccine?”

It’s vaccine, lifesaving treatment. personal protection provides dwarfed importance compared public health benefit vaccinating correct portion population — order blunt effects **the pandemic.**

It’s argument vaccinating prison population. needs “what’s best many” sort discussion seem good those. supply? Pfizer moderna spoken manufacturing capacity delivery schedule additional vaccine batches. it’s stupid first indication something went wrong all! Especially dramatic difference strategy Mortality first wave. don’t think plausible Denmark/Norway travels much less neighbor explains difference peak mortality first wave! locking forward multivariat data analysis conducted.

And would appreciate would keep discourse little civil. retract statement misinformation. study linked say uncontrolled asthma risk factor. they’re higher risk dying catch Covid. You’re missing stage get exposed virus. Without human challenge trials it’s difficult know whether vaccine prevented infection subject wasn’t exposed it. There’d need large scale trials controls vaccinated regularly tested find asymptomatic infections. wait months enough people get sick statistically significant. vaccine already approved there’s also ethical dilemma whether purposefully give people placebo order conduct trial. Maybe right availability low enough it’s possible window closing. I’m aware Pfizer Moderna conducting new trials answer question, basically wait real world data. Make mistake, companies follow Trader Joe's lead, instead, eventually, vaccines become widely available, require employees show proof vaccination order retain employment companies.😷📃✔ Yup. like restaurant exposure US. say likely can't always prove 100% source. bet comes common denominator lot contact tracings.

Bet can't second scenario international travel would never resume? I'm otherwise uncertain probability it, given W.H.O. statement effective vaccination efforts reliant sterile immunity, infer either there's good high chance vaccine innately providing sterile immunity, vaccines provide sterile immunity problem yet.

By chance, smart person! due lack data sterile immunity, immunocompromised state, I'll definitely watching confirmation. context us pandemic relative metropolitan areas? do. San Francisco 237 total COVID deaths since beginning pandemic. sad, definitely, context, would say bad all.

Outside Israel positive looking movement West Virginia. claimed vaccinated ltc 3-4 weeks ago. Contact tracers attempt figure positive case close contact with, usually two days positive test/first symptoms. 

They time dive every rabbit hole someone thinks might infected from.

It likely air line’s responsibility track individuals flight.  Israel literally controls goes Palestinian areas.

That's treated separate country means lol. Isreal govern areas occupied. PLO recognize Israeli authority Israel providing vaccines different US providing vaccines Canadians. true, I've also close calls myself, also know people prolonged contact known infected people gotten sick.

Yeah smell bad smell, therefore wrong dumb dumb. typical EU bureaucratic fuckup, late approving late orderering vaccines. also bet heavily French vaccine turned dud, heavy dose politics involved. good thing countries data. 

We quickly able tell vaccine roll changes number severe infections deaths population injected.

UK infections started fall, that's likely due lockdown vaccination. likely got better protecting vulnerable mass infection. Younger, healthier people getting infected increases lag time infection outcome infection, draws death rate, people likely survive severe illness would kill vulnerable people, even takes long time clear.

Humans need face face socialization, need social outlets aren’t computer, need routines need feel like working something, working progress. simply can’t continue. I'd love see numbers.

Counting percent positive quarantine would give great stats. Thank genuinely curious though, reading comment responded way did?

Because believed said. believe giving pity people demand request. plenty reddits pity-fests norm, expect subreddits like that. EU far worse vaccination front UK. maybe everyone joined UK instead. tend use absolute bare minimum standard safety, fight standard oppresses someone’s freedoms somehow. way enforce US. Quarantining testing travel still essentially voluntary even places $1000+ fines complying. There's simply public health infrastructure teeth 99% country. every state, county, city rules, any. Israel socialized healthcare, seems fine. UK too. bet French vaccine, lobbying costs, work out. Now, bottom list vaccines trying get. literally year quit. it’s easy know people quit due COVOD. done every state get go serious getting people vaccinated.  general high viral load would decrease risk transmission. UK first country Europe start vaccinating. also Oxford. one way obvious, even scored less 4 digits SATs. you’re plane, you’re breathing air.

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Yes, normal. fact probably get far better healthcare recover covid Australia New Zealand right now...

Isn't truth, lol! kind commenting absent mandatory isolation/quarantine procedures people tend travel travel sick. Less people traveling pleasure. know, could wrong absent process US, people traveling like mad, sick not. Think even case someone dying flight COVID. antibodies fight seems unlikely would carrier, far know people carry recovery. Agreed. tried explain much everyone wants government make every single person whole this, won’t never will. People work. reddit think flip switch harmonious collectivist communism get rid money overnight. It’s never going happen. People work fates worse Covid. Europe lags world comes civilization ending diseases. China US individually passed threshold long ago. Yeah I'm sure changed bit, wish could find recent data topic. However, highly doubt USA's mask compliance shot since article Europe's shot up. Quite contrary, based personal experience alone. Nevertheless, time report, many suggesting USA way higher levels mask refusal western countries. make simple assumptions take shot calculating it.

Taking average percent positive nationwide 15.7% (16% simplicity) typical aircraft capacity 160-187 persons (727 we'll assume 180 simplicity).

And assuming double risk due likelihood someone flying predisposed higher risk category they're willing go out, clearly...

You 64% chance flight take least one COVID positive board. think that's conservative.

Taking account effectiveness surgical masks (best case, amirite?) 65% wearer, 90% infected individual... let's say 400% risk transmission due inside plane extended period within six feet others, decent air filtration let's say 50% chance near someone infected... 

All guesses course 13% chance get plane COVID positive become infected. 64% chance someone indeed infected like said. 

So 8.3% chance would get plane COVID positive become infected every flight get on. 

This assumes perfect mask wearing, thing controlled airport environment... Also thing. Bloomberg added daily vaccinations chart 7 day rolling average page.

This page data multiple failure? sorry loss point group ""thinks careful"" could care joined give crap, would much worse.

That group cut socializing 80%, much fret 20% remaining.   good luck ""strangling away pandemic""

""back somewhat normal"" happen late 2022 humanity lucky. think article makes mention whatsoever folks getting COVID plane ride - simply talks _risk_ exposure. think confirmed 'cluster' COVID cases presented despite airlines call low risk onboard transmission, happened, even mandatory pre-departure testing in-flight mask requirements. New Zealand health officials found cluster coronavirus cases genetically linked one passenger, symptoms, traveling 18-hour flight Dubai New Zealand September.

So think poster's statement particularly contradicts reports Canada. again, maybe I've missed part article talks confirmed cases linked exposure airplane. Every.single.time fly long haul get respiratory infection. I’m talking three long haul flights, I’m talking 40-ish times. summer winter, winter summer, it’s like clockwork. refuse believe filters aircraft magically capture Rona floating air. would nice CDC come authoritatively make statement, instead random scientists giving interviews newspapers. help cut sensationalism fake news. sanofi one, subpar results elderly trial participants pushing back release timeline till end 2021. AFAIK US finalized order better terms compay (the reliability question) EU. Pzifer open first come, first serve. 

EU made mistake betting vaccines, enough quantity. Basicly EU countries could agree finansing, able 600 mio. vaccine.  effectiveness significantly reduced significant percentage population refuses participate lockdown spread reduction measures.

The cost lockdown also significantly increases go longer/be repeated emotional stress increases significantly group participating deal group refusing participate.

That said, lockdowns saved major amounts lives delaying better treatment. observe current infection rates death counts vs earlier rates see would happened without lock down. Schools restarting/halloween/Thanksgiving/Christmas/new years caused essentially undoing social separation policies see price we're paying lives. Millions Americans would dead vaccination delayed breakdown long. That's unfortunately entirely clear yet although trust Biontech matter. Bundesregierung stated today they're expecting 3-4 weeks reduced shipments. Theres lot comments I’m sure said already there’s chance dog carrier- there’s cases pets carriers infecting families. perhaps someone adoption center infected. vaccines?

Might good run supply. please sticky post donating convalescent plasma? test positive, first three months likely antibodies save 4 lives plasma donation. 

The red cross really needing plasma help treat patients, I've signed start donating Feb 5, I'm eligible, I'd happy report back procedure went. Yup. whole BS flights safe sanitization theater requiring masks major airlines collapse. There's way air filtered enough keep breathing air someone 2 seats away. still closen enough touch they're every seat. they're asymptomatic exhaling anything short PAPR hood, going transmitted. Apparently something like 5% COVID cases reported app unfortunately. guess would nice extra warning near one 5%, think much reduce spread use ratio. would ICU nurse say fellow nurses take covid seriously? mean, medical professionals medical knowledge, take covid seriously, blame regular folks know better? complicate something like vaccine red tape, things fall apart. wrong.  make more? Ahhahahahaahahha! 

How old you? I'm guessing always see Eat Rich bullshit Reddit. average redditor completely clueless world around them. Manufacturing, Quality, Logistics, forget shit, make more! 

You wise well educated. could CEO Pfizer, would turn whole thing around! eventually offer it?  Right, option many front line employees : work work. option basketball star safety living room. people generally believe first line vaccine.  majority air doesn’t recirculate. air compressed pumped cabin outside exhausted outflow valves rear pressurized cabin. constant throughout entire flight. little air actually stays cabin recirculates. window seat, air collected you.    
Based airflow patterns, wonder makes aisle seat better choice? (even slightly better) What? Pretty sure tested single dose trials, realised need two doses max effectiveness.

Anti-vax sentiment bleeds everywhere, it? humanity gives way much credit vaccines (which already lucky thing like year.) still aren’t addressing SPECIFIC request. U guys exhausting illiterate. 

And I’m repeating again, don’t care case numbers. care widespread noticeable, MOUNTING hospital overwhelm states little restrictions (not one two examples) happening? sources? flight full Kiwis/expats/border exempt people kind self selecting group though think? Kind skews towards people careful. fascinated filoviruses, headline double-take. see Tweets like lot [insert thing seems unnecessary employs people] open? numbers high! 

I guess don’t understand. think we’re point things shouldn’t closed seem unnecessary. flippant trip lululemon seems, it’s probably associate works main source income. It’d one thing established surge malls doesn’t seem like that’s case That’s based early studies said immunity lasts LEAST three four months, that’s long study went. People repeating like it’s three months despite recent evidence suggesting strong, long lasting immunity. Oh yeah, critical point hospitals UK right now, eliminating risk next month two sensible. second week March, demographics accounting 88% deaths least one jab's worth protection.  forget vaccine small 5g tower one French vaccine? Two randoms Reddit planned better state government leaders... fuckin doomed bud. Partial vaccinations? mean single doses? really thing, single dose great strategy limited numbers. airline industry tightened vice like grip Trumps know what’s continually threatened lay workers cried bankruptcy, etc. 

He caved like businessmen worried money decided lives aren’t worth saving vs. dollars already massively subsidized airline industry going lose.

Drives crazy - sat around unemployed 4 months, guys getting rules changed means would prolong industry (live entertainment) able operate even undoubtably higher cases deaths would result decision. less - people making decision take money directly hands give it, again, airline industry. Public transportation empty Stockholm though, even rush hour. Much December instance. one French vaccine? Release Kraken! think odds person college back fall pretty good. Many colleges frankly can't afford stay remote there's real concerns people disengage college come back things online. Right on. genuinely curious though, reading comment responded way did? need assert superiority someone flaws? again, derive pleasure negativity anonymous conflict? think got it. saw comment generally regarded positively feel need contrarian? Yup. calculation based data CDC site, rolling 7 day average vaccine shots US 800,000. extra $400B support vaccination efforts, hopefully stated goal 100 million shots 100 days gets blown water, would actually major disappointment.

We might full impulse, warp speed may nearing reality. lower median age normal death. overall average death age US dropping 1.5 years year suppose getting positive test, logging app might high one's list priorities. Still sucks though, pretty time-sensitive info ""Steep decline"" lol

oh sweet summer child, 2021 definitely awake people rough way Good. awful , better feds picking choosing states. Sure, people hurting, many compared economy whole. Millions work, tens millions carrying before.

All big corporations making big bucks *employ workers*. policy place 8-10 months ago. UK done terrible job virus. problem neighbors might infect air gets filtered.  legally Texan stubborn think never bothered reporting extra deaths, basically said ""yeah bunch people died guess oh well"" got forgotten about, people maths upped russia death toll 55k (at time) 186k That's quite frankly insult everyone who's dealt mental health issues onset pandemic.

Oh no, can't go act like drunken slob waste money overpriced booze. horror. What's source billion infections? Seems wildly inflated Moderna vaccine even pronounced impact 1st jab. get ""pick"" vaccine, go w/ one. Kn95 whole hell lot better surgical mask though. Sure nose perminent bloody scab least sealed reasonably well. 

But yeah, tape. Let’s see long takes tell that. Fuckers. hardly. We’ll asked/told wear outbreak finish dying down, even we’ve made good dent vaccination due variety factors, apply turns seasonal deal instead going away good. post responded making though wearing mask part “living like this” sucks donkey dicks can’t go due it, pointed it’s stuff makes shitty. Grabbing mask go Target pretty minimally invasive. tough longer. Yes, models widely considered best, far accurate ""official"" IHME models.  I’m healthcare worker it’s giant pain get vaccine. don’t know go start looking (my company far hasn’t provided it). I’ve emailed city, county, asked hospital. Ugh it’s frustrating extend predictions two potentially emerging coronavirus infections—SARS MERS. model predicts endemic state IFR circulating CoV depends primarily severity childhood infections. case CoV-1, pathogenic CoV-2, still expect low disease burden endemic phase CoV-1, like CoV-2, low IFR young (Fig. 3). However, data suggest emerging HCoVs follow optimistic pattern; overall IFR endemic MERS-like virus would decrease transition endemicity seen Fig. 3B, disease severity (and IFR) high children, age group expected experience bulk primary cases endemic phase. endemic phase, vaccination program MERS would therefore necessary avoid excess mortality (fig. S11).  None flu vaccines mRNA-based though, right? annual vaccines work - specifically, convince FDA safe effective? spokes don’t healthcare healthy (ish) population LA. much bruz, country adequate response Exactly. Since repeatedly bought 50 piece lots masks, must say quality masks even gotten better time, well price came down, order FFP2/KN95/KF94 15 Dollars 50 pieces cheaper.

The insistence fullfilling expensive difficult produce N95 standard rather use Cloth buying cheaper product everyone big mistake.  Wake got shit Quebec starts 8 pm.. imma bet jack shit. Imagine able go work see 50+ people able see 3 friends work. Jesus think fucking robots [These findings show FFRs exhalation valve provide respiratory protection wearer also reduce particle emissions levels similar better provided surgical masks, procedure masks, cloth face  


you could also wear another surgical cloth mask filter bothers much. think anyone reasonable judge taking calculated risk see family. people say nothing, virus still around I'm done wearing masks good, done social distancing, etc. We've lost sense collective good country. understand we're burnt saying fuck precautions means transferring burnout someone else (want reiterate think saying this, seems general consensus thread). Even Massachusetts hotspot spring know anyone got August, less 10 people since Yeah, totally fault one work frontline health worker middle pandemic totally voluntary choice child high risk. totally closed hospitals right?

I honestly know what's astounding here, pathological lack empathy hopeless lack common sense.  critical worker, girlfriend live together. way could mean get vaccine sooner? already vaccinated, would suck get COVID give take work. You’ve got clue Australia. us living COMPLETELY COVID-FREE pandemic. Brisbane recently locked 3 days (shock horror!! - saw long weekend home) one UK variant case. gave contact tracers enough time contact test isolate 400 close contacts go back COVID-FREE life (those 400+ people could access $1,500 government needed can’t work 2 weeks). would much rather stay home 3 days rampant spread fatalities. I’d much rather live somewhere taken seriously government somewhere overwhelmed hospitals. Invest beefing healthcare. that, way prepared hospitals surge weeks (we counting lockdowns prevent turning months), short-term solutions like turning beds ICU beds using buddy system fill staff shortage. prepared deal years would build actual ICU's train specialized nurses, etc. Luckily I’m getting break weeks. horrible constant death is, watching people go daily lives like nothing wrong spread absolute lies virus vaccine makes much angrier. nothing would happen soon enough would drag long cost money lawyers civil matters - meanwhile need earn money. main problem really ending sight. Europe, slower vaccine rollout US, speeding risk group pretty much vaccinated April + obviously spring coming.

However, zero positive messages news political statements. People predicting hard lockdown April/May considered optimists country. People predicting bars clubs opening somewhere 2022 considered desilussional ""should get sugar coat attitude."" 

How ever supposed get better? look SIER model sometime, there's cool youtubes confirmation bias hell drug Also, remember state-run sites. way get immunity type virus vaccines. It’s already proven immunity work. People reinfected certain amount times. Lol covid made want universal healthcare.

Prevention number one way deal healthcare. 

I agree, fat people burden. also deal covid issue well.

I think 2 things, time. Probably make big bucks. works. stupid. inconvenient you.  Technically, yes would capped max capacity also raises deaths areas. healthcare workers aren’t available treat diseases outside covid. see anybody arguing maximum effort vaccination.

It binary choice, both, get everyone vaccinated whilst hapenning reduce spread virus.


As others mentioned, UK coping tiered systems local lockdowns, managing control infection rate.

Since new variant taken hold, cases exploded, hospitals struggling cope highest level lockdown nationwide seems started level cases. *laughs Australian* Same. company one largest medical corporations US, they've us home since last March likely keep us July 2021. messing around unless staff that's necessary site. I'll give credit - known deaths yet, huge employer. double shot vaccines though, number people vaccinated half that? Wait, played Matt-Damon-like character Contagion? reference: 

Approx 420k Americans died WW2 lasted 6 years (though arguably US involved 4) It’s going happen anyways vaccines go highest bidder? sure print money, unless US Start smoking eligible! Yeah, publish final results, way public know good vaccine :/ using KN95 masks, made cheaply china, yet comparable function European FFP2 masks. Even certified, masks still way better cloth masks bandana. price low use new one every day. think availability price one difficult overcome problems around expensive American Standard N95 vs FFP2 / KN95 KF94.

I buy 50 FFP2 masks around 20 dollars. 

I understand probably N95 superior, choose cloth/surgical, would go KN95 every time. People kind mentality show almost chance seriously combating climate change unless governments basically force people comply. Climate change long term major societal issue; Covid really bump road.

Liberal individualist/libertarian societies apparently value superficial momentary pleasure. That's sign societal weakness unsustainability.

Fukiyama wrong counts, then. Ehhh probably came contact around 20 30 people, multiply several times.. Colorado! WOOHOO! educated immune bullshit conspiracy theories. There's anesthesiologist work buys essential oil shit. wonder much risk ordering take would be? already avoid non essential trips stores ordering delivery something still often wrong, fauci told us white lie early pandemic. 
he also explained [he wanted available masks saved health care 
It is, research. masks filter particulates work, since sars cov 2 virus lives water droplets, water droplets gets stopped particulate filters. 


face coverings recommended general public cause they're cheap easy get everybody quickly, shirt face pretty much. agree. many people, death rate Covid would almost legitly look like joke. damages do, understand everyone scared it. Many people even talk vaccinating old people cut deaths (true) allow lift restrictions others... forgetting young ones (also 40s) actually spread virus? Everyone getting vaccines available everyone good idea?  related note, dangers accidentally end getting two vaccines (either type different)? would nothing waste dose? agree follow.

But want remind people. Americans left die government. beaten cult “individual responsibility” “personal freedom”. rather strong central state stepping say, “no cohesive society care you” resounding silence translated “there’s hope, aren’t gonna help you, own”.

It’s really hard mad large people breaking needing human interaction emotional support one another, feelings normalcy getting nothing country. 

Naturally doesn’t apply 300 hogs piling maskless fucking Buffalo Wild Wings happen. lot people trying keep living take care family getting still.

Do fall “individual responsibility” narrative. you’ve conditioned part society don’t surprised people behave way. ye well really way around unless get fit tested n95 mask. Tape works know followed covid-19 back February 2020 medical staff Wuhan using tape seal gaps since proper fit tested masks using whatever available. news story earlier 100% people symptoms get permanent lung damage worse lifetime smoking 70% asymptomatic people get same. certain point people start wonder getting overhyped. votes comment know ccp circle jerk going here. right mind would sign that? I'd rather terminated signing catching covid You’ve read it, you? Dude, studied virology (just one term though), spent month lab playing DNA, read peer reviewed studies. 


J&amp;J AZ dna vaccines. use adenovirus vector deliver DNA (not RNA) cells' nuclei, gets converted back RNA, spike protein immune system trains on. 


Which part said incorrect exactly? Good job CA, shut economy cause irreparable harm countless small businesses stop COVID, get COVID anyway. Jesus Christ man go see girlfriend Yeah, know tell you, terrible example. Everyone hates Trump obvious reasons take look math Covid spreading most. nothing political affiliation: go fund probably set KF94. I’m favor it’s terrible scenario hospitals max capacity risk healthcare workers capped? suffer home add healthcare worker risk. Looks like they've done lot better US thanks Utah following science logic well blessed Joseph Smith. calling dept labor fighting rights going cause job? also illegal. would retaliation illegal dept labor. company would could sued. No. appear ""it's time open get back work"" sort mentality. 

They also posted record deaths today. flu /s

For reference estimated flu deaths per year 250-500k globally. americans gonna americ tuning out.  Sweden literally worst example give. Fun fact, government needs incentivize action, free market government one developing vaccine, think would successful?

Sure, not? like private sector immune government action. federal government needs company act, literally takeover company make act. also includes staff locations. skilled nursing could significant amount people. Emmanuel? still forces poor schmuck basic needs me. Whether order groceries direct impact much time community person spending. headline literally says avoid additional trips can, don’t want responsible someone else exposed.  Covid considerably worse flu. translate ""everyone's going die!!!""

Ridiculous hyperbole sensationalism far likely come morons think mask mandates ""fascism"" upset can't go weekends act like degenerate cretins. Wearing mask literally least do. fucking hard. government charge charge. state dependent independent. nation UN member UN member. place responsible dealing Covid yet capable dealing Covid. think we’re past point avoiding people.

The light end tunnel bright sun. 95%+ effective vaccines written stars. part said incorrect? 
Adenovirus DNA virus, right? J&amp;J AZ dna vaccines - use adenovirus vector get nucleus cell puts DNA spike protein it, gets converted RNA, finally protein. You’ve twice? second time? Months ahead accounts Talk folks Toyota plant. 1 5 positive cases per day evidentially. Seriously, kind headline this? implicit suggestion obsessed COVID otherwise don’t care morbid absurd. people write stuff need grow get outside truly is. whole time 🤷 vaccinations increasing daily, PPE supplies good, treatments getting better, spring coming? Yes! omg yes million times!!!!! want expel energy effort time trying maintain relationship whether family, friends, acquaintance, work acquaintance, etc someone either live reality cares themselves. Like said I'd rather lonely surrounded assholes. find older get less interested spending much time making food.

Nah I'm going direction even shot cooking videos. clearly OP lmfao intellectually bankrupt throw cliche dismissals NZ even attempt counter points. 

You way counter know it, go silent instead.

Well fun living virus central mate, I've got unmasked, unrestricted summer holiday get back to! reinvent wheel kinds basic things? increase corporate profit. Well think surgical masks made polypropylene, static charge capture droplets going out. also cotton masks pocket inside could put polypropylene sheets get benefit well. 

I've wondered kind diy silicone mold face make super custom-fitted mask gasket could fit kind replaceable material tight latch front. Years ago trying find n95 fit face work almost impossible find places sold anything common one two sizes. old person? Wow hits home. March 12th last day saw dad. Didn’t hear? Biden got elected. Coronavirus basically gone Ironically year ago let *were* wearing mask. Studies show people adapt new realities fairly quickly. example, consider British carried despite bombarded Hitler WWII. problem Pfizer Moderna right now.

Most world, including US, counting Astrazeneca coming early J&amp;J vaccine coming bit later. 

The chinese (sinovac) russian (sputnik) also expected, less controls mostly parts world alongside africa south america. 

&amp;nbsp;

But europe, north america expecting lot Aztrazeneca.  

&amp;nbsp;

Lets see goes, though. They're stopping there's many Moderna/Pfizer. Aztrazeneca JJ releasing February, means ton released public March/April/May alongside Pfizer/Moderna ones don’t understand though... covid deniers? suffer normalcy bias think everyone else America unlucky won’t be? No. 


It's probably likely owner offered people lose job covid get pretty good government benefits.

We've workers asked laid get benefits. workplace that, yet building full sanitizer social distancing dots. using April 2020 knowledge January 2021. It’s absolutely insane. 

Worst part? health sector one business pillars. find hard believe getting outright fired.

* Thick, densely woven cotton fabrics best, quilting cotton cotton sheets.

I know target near one near sells cotton mask packs 2 $4. ones buy double layered even pocket filter. I've buying sporadically since pandemic started since still go work 30 now. 

I lot washing day use since sometimes sneeze something may want one per shift. Honestly past two weeks, would like see study redone.


I work special needs preschool, increase testing went (5 days week sept dec) 0 pediatric cases &amp; 1 staff member case 4 student cases confirmed week! Literally 1/2/21 today (pending 2 test results). 

So classes remote 10 days, prior coming back kids need negative test. wonder many come back positive.

Edit: it’s pretty insane holidays did. really didn’t realize many children asymptomatic show mild “everyday preschool” Petri dish behavior estimated 10% world's population infected October think. 760MM people time. I'm assuming around billion now. would that? Haha, everything bigger Texas!! Why? Well, you’re wrong. don’t seem listening sense. Fortunately, you’re one making policy! Yep lot refusing get it.

We started phase 1B one work 15 people going get it. guess one knows talking reddit work like too. mask policy literally one follows it. 15 ppl work office, 2 us stayed home. Makes mad.  Well say heard least things media perhaps changing. absolutely right though getting attention deserves. Two things true time however give China pass terms relations countries people. nations held accountable. want people take seriously need set end date. march 1 april may.

This indefinite Corona-virus hiatus worn people feeling hopeless. Especially vaccine people mentally checked out.

People need see finish line give up. Plain simple  vaccine previous infection provide invisible shield around person. infection vaccination protect illness infection. 
This rely heavily herd immunity. 
Another concern mine new strains COVID transmissible *not* virulent. genius evolutionary trait organism necessarily want kill host...it wants live breed much possible. segment population thinks immune via previous infection immunization *and* strains disease emerging easy transmit. doesn’t seem like good combo me. seems rife lot asymptomatic people spreading disease around. happens uncritically believe insane drivel spewed western media. [Even muslim-majority countries buy Uighur nonsense, overseas empire halfway across world, regularly bombs coups countries middle east (and many places) pretending cares ethnicity one west even heard 2018. Classic projection. Lol lot new comers think aware we’ve hearing since began. Quite sadly really, glad saved image use someone tries smartass situation. Yeah, learned Trump COVID country assholes.

Nothing force wear masks, doubt Biden's going institute mandatory masks six days. entire department working remotely. least 200 people. VPN WebEx everything running like clockwork.  another thread, consensus RNA vaccines would provide immunity asymptotic infection due huge number “spike” rna administered. may hypothetical. post text. state open sign testing. cant take anymore reservations vaccine doses people. thing makes happy people signing it. 9:30 morning booked. least area.  need 0 covid first feel you, level lawbreaking people sort power moment breathtaking. think fall deaf ears get jammed system. considered pausing operations temporarily? guess no! $7/hr per job?
I try ask delivery people tip goes there’s always language barrier I’m stumped.
Oh edit always change tip 25% Humility perspective. make less wrong, bridges gap. Hopefully change 6 days. here, March 16, fully-remote anniversary :) think PCR. 3 nasal swabs 1 mouth swab. Come house suck it. I’ll even wear fucking mask. goal flatten curve let go back up. Keeping flat consistent original reasoning. Absolutely, currently pendulum swinging back left people think safe. Unfortunately that's reality parties throughout history waves evil shit. illusion eating up. Teacher family perspective...Families paying attention fucksticks leadership. Here's happened week starting last Friday.

1) shut schools numbers high
2) unsure schools open next week. 
3) numbers 50%
4) obviously means closed?
5) nope, still know
6) TOMORROW FRIDAY NUMBERS UP
7) closed then?
8) still know
9) ever fucking CLOSE

How families plan absolutely zero fucking clue what's happening day day. Zero leadership zero care peoples lives impact healthcare costs. problem teachers start calling sick day subs start refusing show up. need quietly soft strike allowed organize. Oh, know! heard anything getting administer vaccines. gonna surprise people ask ""third"" stimulus thanks stupid loophole, gonna say ""You got third stimulus $1400 showed up."" several people even gotten first $1200. let alone second $600 supposed $2000/$1400 suppose from.

we demand monthly stimulus pay, back paid entirety 2020! fuck stupid princess terrorist poopytime  New strain probably, mixed people getting sick indoors, holidays well come effect. lost Grandfather last Friday. Get call two days later. Lost Grandpa mother's side. Covid.. Separate sides family, two days apart. Covid everywhere right now. actually brought before. It’s BS still infect household members one talking that. clothing exposure whatnot. Seems pointless point, seeing lost control months ago.

At point, get vaccine ASAP also focus getting money people's hands getting economy going again. *Hospital revenue intensifies* need stop grading curve.  something proud of.  completely fucked vaccine rollout. best worst admirable. started one day you. I’m fortunate enough job August home find permanent home home job September. I’m never going back. European countries got near-0 summer. USA didn't. That's difference. USA twice many ""serious pandemic months"" Germany that.  fair, don’t really choice. It’s politicians dictate happens they’re choosing ignore open everything back really. talking year long lockdowns. real business that’s locked suffering indoor theaters. performing arts hurting. Finally, adult. I’ll give try. ND state one lives leading rate vaccinations nationwide still? know plenty. business partner's wife probably makes money week Texas Children's Houston year. statement, ""for people 20s younger, less deadly flu"". I'll take years experience, far 15, yours. cover things. live Florida frequently go wondering lucky avoiding catching thing. I'm sure must contacted someone virus maybe immune system blocked mask.

WHOOPDIE FUCKING  one studies history life earth geology infant earth records first biochemistry mass-extinction events climate records indicators ecosystems among many factors influences.

There intetplays environment biology anatomy grit violence evolutionary pressures. social systems inter-species symbiosis cooperation. arrive here, homo sapiens.

We turn social structures societies societies civilization. conquer nature hold back tides engineer life itself.

Now consider new factor evolution life. intelligence need consider shape history.

We become smart aware universe workings afforded priviledge stupid endanger survival species.

Maybe life universe necessarily inevitable, ironic. Ive got bottle sauv blanc belt

😬 That’s one thing people failing realize. large portion population taking serious serious forced work sharing communal spaces, grocery stores/parks, people aren’t taking seriously. portion population going things normal whole shebang would catastrophe magnitudes higher. dust settled going look back epoch like “holy shit should’ve done better that, especially modern era”. wish discussions would acknowledge every new infection likely \*also\* contributing herd immunity! I'm saying people really care others. even someone cared got Covid finally see first hand kind damage (physical, mental, emotional), may still care change attitude towards trying protect others.

Lots people, right now, even scared Covid they're scared themselves. They're scared getting giving family/friends, innocent stranger.

This world full people care others. even majority smarten up, still handful give fuck. know? see everywhere. Look news. Murders. Rape. Theft. Exploitation.

Just clarify, know you. say type care others? acknowledging kind people exist. point.

Also, wear mask home. expect to. merely suggesting there's always gonna others give shit. get it! COVID deaths matter! one cares heart disease, cancer!!

/s Engineering grow tissue cells body. mean ""the gravity pandemic""? Sweden, lockdowns, 3% [excess Policies opinions based fear treated like religious belief. Thats either lie completely illegal compare America Canada? New Zealand? huge percentage 'normal' temperature people Covid moment!!! misleading, know one means. Right enough detected cases CFR pretty reliably predict many deaths daily case counts lead to, current numbers that's pretty serious news. Also testing improved enough probably massive numbers undetected cases now, going huge gap two. picture history books. Awesome I've done best safe, keep distance, wear mask, sanitize hands, go necessary still got COVID. Luckily I'm mostly recovered (besides continued fatigue breathlessness) I'm happy worse considering I'm also pregnant. get people keep pretending huge issue part fix. also accurate include number people recovered COVID well herd immunity target? know Texas \~2million *known* cases COVID, lot people developing antibodies getting us even closer herd immunity. Honestly, American people deserve. enabled live recklessly expect taken care poor decisions catch them. Geez 167 cases late ya ask me. fucked US started fatigued, it? Asian countries likely wear masks public, even there's pandemic occurring is. 1.1 million increase 24 hours pretty damn good. Unfortunately state completely fucking vaccinations (WA). currently 430k unused vaccines sitting freezers administered 225k past month. Remember funded cartels? Pepperidge farm remembers.. Soviets lots whole generation WWII. expand age range conscription couple times fill losses could get enough people. non-combatant casualties quite high well.
The government afraid publish real death toll decades still tries diminish losses. 
You still see gaps left WWII Russia’s distribution people age. FYI, masks work. work smallish room 10 people I've wearing mask whole time. 6 10 guys caught covid exposed every one different points time caught it(at different points time). Wear mask work, sanitize, dont let guard 👍 course, since choice, stay home, point masks work haha

Edit: 6 guys ones didnt wear masks 90% time..... there’s money involved, would get vaccine shot twice together. Stay strong. majority USA citizens never take serious virus.

This result wonder Vautour thought gay wedding cake. course, different country.  Thanks correction. dont understand people missing point^ solution something provide. failure US government countries got shit together. Yikes, dude.

How good, decent caring people dieing covid yet people like get away it? That, butter chicken lamb vindaloo microwaveable crack. I’ve wondered allocation. idea Texas given few?  someone living Texas, doesn’t seem fair.  [White House abandoned plan deliver 650 million face masks across U.S., report Johnson Johnson whose over-the-counter drug bottles laced poison Chicago, recalled rolled back tamper-proof packaging? even get started QFC. pegged store local Covid hub. use 3 register lanes, always dozens dozens people standing top get store. self checkouts. Can't barely space enough space registers aisles. Even ""express check"" backed entire aisle!

Aww, damn! Done got started, lol. means country is, minimum, 1/3 failure.

Not yet complete failure, least 1/3 one. Even successes they'd still 1/3 failure overall. What's opposite developing? country developed state regression Portugal . Staying inside mandatory, starting today. essential services open. I’m lucky place letting us work home forever want. I’m actually move 2k miles away keep job. ever affordable unlimited hot spot pandemic ever ends may rv live road work. think admit one side better other. seriously people need stop voting either party vote random dude in. Random dude vote lobbyists, neither side will.  continue believe headlines buddy. Breaking news reddiotor reads headline must facts. Agreed! clue much lost that....and probably would vomit did. lockdown? lockdown [the vaccine officially available 60 years miss part could've avoided? Anyone wanted stay could applied settled status thing. Anyone know vaccine's storage conditions? middle class poorer think true us. people don’t care undo lot caution rest us take. I’ve cautious whole time. still happy-birthday wash hands leave house sanitize hands going grocery store. know peeps too.  Africa poor centuries. 22nd century still living huts. nurse aware reports. Unless you’re anti-masker. first thing thought saw this. really disappointed, cause love TJ's. Kinda sucks NONE area.

But yeah. Good damage control part. We’ve mandatory masks, lines limit customers, even changed entire register layout completely (which lot work) since beginning. Employees encouraged stay home even one symptom got 2 weeks Covid pay stay home. They’re good people.


I wish wasn’t hatred unions lol work cvs long term care pharmacy warehouse, using shitty Aetna health insurance. fucks better pay get it. west bank access israel currently. matter many vaccinated israel's numbers, least US Canada vice versa.  Yeah. two less conflicting articles. One says COVID infection shown much immunity, one says immunity infection option. That's it. I'm buying tomorrow. Ooo need try one cool store. like shopping there. cheapest always feel little extra worth it. Good them.  federal government covering payment, states. German owners. family also owns Aldi’s. Right. I’ve long since decided sex/physical contact general partner (who doesn’t live household! gasp!) worth risk. Quality life come play point. sleep Korma Fish Curry. favorite! follow Francois Balloux? seems argue herd immunity reached vaccination well degree natural infection, believable least lot countries west (maybe native Canada unfortunately...) ""LoCkDoWnS wOrK!!1!! Move ASAP, sounds kinda absurd let’s see Walmart Amazon step happens don’t answer shareholders.  Love Trader Joe’s.  100 million cases confirmed reinfection cases remain sparse. sure would say it’s rare. see finally-aging Mario Lopez There's toggle switch counter end belt every QFC controls second belt. regularly use they're ridiculous I'm bagging. Sanitize well. let guess, schools still open 🤦‍♀️ Frozen artichoke spinach dip also better most. That’s scary, that’s 87,000 deaths 45 days. Close basically 2K every day average 45 days Yeah, fun wait second doses sit shocked pikachu face can't properly procure allocate second doses.

But J&amp;J single shot actually works, help matters without concern. Although mean one dosers BioNtech/Pfizer Moderna vaccines? Lucky. California decided hate gyms now. report dumbass, can't say stupid shit like online without drawing attention.

Lucky there's lot keyboard warriors willing act tough online hard focus one particular.  Across board 3-4%. Sorry that’s false. masturbating six feet apart jesus fucking christ. public health official taken single course human sexuality? we're already worst case scenario. things get better starting soon people get vaccinated warmer summer weather. actually competent administration take seriously.

stop fear mongering. Yeah little late best example damage caused 24-hour news cycle. Bad things get worse, new bad things worry about, move on. projection 300,000 February December? exactly “handling right” entail? Europe “handled right” according sub summer shits control They're checking. make appointment  reasonable response covid I’ve read ten months. personally plan handle disagreements rest household precautions post-vaccination?

My family wants keep wearing masks distancing foreseeable future even vaccine, think anyone doesn’t agree “turning chance safe”. plans arguing this, they’re gonna listen anything say, main stance right get ready move near future I’m honestly sure I’m right thing.

What would situation? 2-3 feet  approaches reasonable, they're disagreeing relative minutia. Giving doses risk, there's ingredient supply disruption, production disruption distribution delay, could easily large number people delayed second doses. data delaying doses. reserving second doses guaranteed delay entire program, benefit sure ones give.

I'm content let experts talk out. Fauci knows virus Biden knows government get production information demand. feel relatively certain come best answer could get, 100% certain they're gonna come answer get. That's generally virus's work long run years off. Denver Broncos playoffs people eating out???? Depending people right isn’t going well either US. Everyone selfish, even people begging collectivism. I’d rather take chances responsibilities someone doesn’t know give shit dictating every move. point believe anymore.

A congressional representative contracted receiving doses suddenly doctors tv going, ""well receiving vaccine think takes six weeks begin protecting you"" would great tell us beginning.

My state (IL) likes boast got robust vaccination program going live (region 7) can't even hit 25% goal vaccine. father kidney transplant patient 65 told transplant team expect anything April. 

And everyone's acting like big deal case numbers dipping again, like everything exploded bad October. European, who’s friend? Lockdowns responsibility still seen.

 stats seem it’s Americans, shouldn’t fight math facts makes feel bad. people workplace caught Covid 19 lucky cases severe. see vigilance fading fast, young people moving crowded Walmart without mask making use numerous sanitation stations. scary time I'm immune compromised many careless people around raises risk others myself. sad see people caring anymore... True fact: homeless exempt Quebec’s curfew. don’t make shelter 8 PM, get $6000 fine.

This crazy. WTF? supposed do? They're hopeless can't afford pay housing. government expect able afford pay fine? said thing post. work moderna? remember seeing that, real person fb feed CARES Act already includes everyone US, including undocumented residents. Okay, BC hardcore lmao. real, pandemic handling provinces except Maritimes complete joke. definitely shouldn’t vaccines IV. Really, don’t that. QFC checker went quickly attempted bag stuff one yogurt tops got punctured. seriously need slow food starts piling second belt. Germans aren’t Americans? idea talking someone knowledgeable microbiology. I'm happy defer that's possible problem. lol I’m literally eating pork gyoza eat this. Soooo good lol live. surprising. work grocery store Canada think would likely say can't come work without it. December, reported would still used, haven’t seen anything since then. usually meal prep lunch i'm busy sunday go trader joe's buy refrigerated soups never disappoints. lentil soup ancient grains favorite  I’d say everybody I’ve talked least reservation taking even say they’ll probably get soon can. think couple actually said fully trust science. kind thinking dangerous. dumb ignorant comment. might referring people dismissed taking serious action virus justified low number deaths time. Even lockdowns justified, could still made preparations next inevitable wave. many places reaction was, whole things already, nothing needed done anymore. attitude sort survived even deaths started climb again. walked extra mile, paid extra (as compared neighborhood’s Jewel Osco) shop TJ. reason that, random morning chatting guy subway worked could see loved company well company treated personal problem resulting injury. Glad see it’s still case.  Same. believe vaccines, horrible reaction regular flu shot nervous would reaction shot. way work is, know would react even kind medical note. Ontario everything considered essential. Non essential employees get letter employers saying they're essential, case get stopped police. Personally, see point implementing curfew would cram people grocery big box stores. think real lockdown needed. half-assed make believe mockdown 2.0. I’m one. god fucking delicious. Buffalo wings lifeline. expect people do, sit inside summer 2022? That’s simply realistic herd immunity infection puts us risk mutations lot people would die it’s worth it. immunity stuff good news though almost recovered. Time pick carry life. wonder would take able scale production 1 billion doses per month. mRNA technology + massive production would absolute game changer. would probably need train million people learn give vaccinations. Disgusting inbreds, hope next variant much specifically designed. Lol . Look Gora gulaam complete silence hard questions asked.

And diverting topic indophobic racist stuff . racists dumb incapable seeing hypocrisy. Philly ones still pulsing lines. grocery I've going since March 2020. literally mentioned *non*-profit hospital. work for-profit. really hope hospitals stay afloat, vaccine keeps working. Probably draconian lockdown reduce community spread low levels. aggressive contact tracing becomes manageable.  love TJs Hillsboro, Oregon. Great staff!  it’s winning :x really anything... don’t get much posting haha. thanks u2  better California that’s sure. cluterfuck there. Good them! Finally company gives shit workers Instacart pay $25 go get vaccine know n95 mask magic shield virus right? can’t put one assume whatever want. wearing masks February I'm moron knew said dont wear masks cause massive supply issue. Literally SARS every report told countries keep n95 mask supplies date not. realize that, guess eating work anymore. can’t get infected you’re already infected 👉😉 Actually 7 day average cases 3 days row. Appears getting better interesting read, thank you! like sequel game new features. still scratches itch wanting play games series get pet dog xD Don’t infection antibodies last like months? Id happy shown wrong banker back remember given fliers instructing customers must remove face coverings lobby. let customers keep Chicago they’re handling pandemic well, according measures they’ve set

And New York vaccine rollout? Lots people said lots things. said could vaccine soon October. said shit would last past 2025. even recall one maniac saying would gone Easter like miracle. easy remember predictions turned true. mean people want protect loved ones, family city Pandemic people believe it’s hoax cause death economic destruction due ignorance ?  Yup. definitely “point fingers” glibly put. probably estimate many people had/have COVID based estimate projection. It’s gonna range Psh, CDC says FL UNUSED vaccines. Beat that! Nana, 95yo, fell last night, still ER waiting hospital bed. none her. least morphine waiting, still waiting testing make sure break anything. cocid oxygen low needs stay.


The hospitals full, even covid still wait treated. Now. I’m saying political angle. think Trump gone, media going cover covid much. Even projected case trajectory stays new administration, painted different brush. hope I’m wrong, don’t think be. Proving stupidest world smh 🤦‍♂️  think issue hear 4,000 people died realize half people die per day US normal year, mention covid killing elderly sick, people living long anyway (although good keeping people barely alive pharmaceuticals, could argued against). US pretty big, say 4,000 people dying crazy, many cities one million people metropolitan area? even guess. 

And spreads exponentially unless city hit, really low odds know somebody. I've living abroad now, know friends family know anybody died friends family completely scattered country. thing think collateral damage deaths. rare cases get infected twice. Also, rare cases get COVID-19 getting fully vaccinated. studies suggest virus travel vents air conditioning. N95 nice may still get eyes unless you’re wearing airtight goggles something.

Not sure likely happen, definitely *can* happen enough bad luck.  Oh boy, might break 100k one month rate!

Heh, remember back still young though 100k *total* COVID-19 deaths US grim milestone? Lol, why?  Wow. Same! family thinks I’m asshole don’t like haven’t gathering 🙄 missing total doses sheet? would nice see total daily doses well since that's indicative increased ability administer shots. problem line thinking based confirmation bias. seeing ""literally everyone"" know gotten COVID fared well anecdotal, means nothing compared real statistical evidence COVID mortality. fact pandemic resulted deaths hundreds thousands almost like hear kids starving Africa.

Sure, proves point. incredibly easy overlook horrific events personally affected you, detract reality situation. Yeah forget sometimes people versions social distancing Brazil data different claim. That's true covid-19 vs flu death rate 

0.2 - 0.4 (covid-19 age 10 - 49) 

vs 

0.04 (flu). telework lot report office least per week duties can’t completed home, rotation team.

Other organizations office space small hallway, everyone’s pretty friendly.

I try get in, business, head back home. need desk close door take mask off.

At times, wear mask. cannot said others.

Went Tuesday, passed belated holiday treats. Ended chatting one person gift, broke 6-feet rule leaning look family photos (on desk, hand. still).

My mask on, not.

So anyway received positive test results yesterday I’m definitely home, “list.”

Sigh. That’s understandable. lot people like bigger ones that’s Apple keeps making them. guess it’s cos people like watch play games phones don’t really do. It’s nice there’s option smaller ones (SE 12 mini). rare nowadays phones. According thread, CDC website accurate said ""1st doses"". actually updated CDC page distinguish 1st vs 2nd past minutes. Sanders pretty much hope he's old later elections. companies termination, meaning terminate whenever whatever. actually illegal wrong do?   Wisconsin blue dude  Yes. remember happening least Colorado Springs. well flu vaccine pish posh different flu strains think circulating. covid vaccine, would need put new mRNA code. probably would different side effect wise, two (flu vaccine vs covid vaccine) can’t really compared  going afford sue Workplace? Sure pay court fees back $5,000 saved ? Many Attorneys least state require thousand dollars upfront they'll even start working case. Also show court every month . also able use last job kind reference. go years . dragging long wear show court today bought boom bada bang get dismissed get money awarded wasting time I'm - things I'm supposed - regurgitation messages death tolls nothing 12 months know happens people dying thousands, hospitals collapsed simple road accident kill beds? People get afraid. want kill family. Lots people leave home. Many people get sick can't work. Everyone closes borders country gets isolated. That's thrashes economy beyond belief. economy without people.

This hypothetical example. look US. incredible amount money allocate problem

I think people understand aspect well should. practically unlimited funds federal level. Combine fact pandemic deflationary event, hold world's reserve currency. There's probably practical upper limit much money could cram economy. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article They'll back packed work clothes away live lounge gear. way.    I’ve sewing 2 layer masks filter pocket made high quality quilt cotton since February. demand. market flooded cheap knit masks see through.

There another half-assed shutdown month 2. It’s vicious cycle  issue would giving close succession trying use one version booster other. Pretty sure it’s extra $25 incentive pay get vaccine. vaccine free. happen last month 3 locations going crazy? people base actions risk assessment people doing. Abstract information less impact. 

I’ve thought lot since I’m one work wearing face shield, making office pandemic weirdo/extremist. even two people so, would change people see face shields. places it’s standard employees they’ll look such.

Nothing risk different, many people it, creating baseline normal. “This must safe enough.”

Similarly, mall open early stages ice storm people still showed get stranded turned icepocalypse. mall open must okay... 

Tl;dr: Humans dumb herd animals. catch too. feel you. I'm German expat- live east coast US since 20, rest family Barmstedt/Heidelberg. Usually would visit summer, seen family members since March '20- Oma early 90's hope visit passes.

I'm glad get job. Sorry loss 😐 projections stupid people believe them. haven’t accurately projected anything virus. We’re shooting hip here. Buckle up! I’d love see source Good also likely bit higher earlier. Treatments capacity helped lower bit. live county 250k people North Toronto. checked recently 5 ICU beds left entire county. Yet, still see hear people say hoax demand everything re-open they'll refuse vaccine. foolishness goes everywhere seems. sure said Children almost chance die covid Someone close admitted hospital. We’ve tried hard keep away got them. pneumonia. Anyway, worried. confused. Democrats saying reopen everything now. Dude 54yo. isn’t roommate... Mild cases (particularly kids) may resistant lung disease account fewer pulmonary ACE2 receptors. Kids adults might get Covid URTI (+/- GI !)
Also, transmission event may effect outcome. Droplets lodged URT, fomite transmission may ""safer"" transmission. Aerosol different beast (Nasty!). kids may resistant rarely get lung disease. fits nicely epidemiology.

Again, know I'm limb descending infection model makes sense aerosol transmission. think dogma. many Utah population skeptical magic underwear?

Being fence doctors key role helping pandemic, soaking? *Hollis, 54, former journalist, learned blood fortified so-called super antibodies — antibodies neutralize virus, which, even diluted 10,000 times, still resists Covid-19, Liotta said.* confused thought ronald reagan got vaccianted, word ironic thing fifth day worse coronavirus would be, statistically. needs bad

Why convinced it’s hoax? allocate $500 debit card person gets vaccinated. Yes still get people refuse, would definitely get takers imma get n Department agree assessment. Realistically end February we're going around 40% population kind immunity (infections + vaccine). That's going show data. First hospitalizations drop already showing signs happening. deaths drop too. Cases last go may see small localized increasing case rates long time. closely exposed 400-800 people per day work. Every day. 20% unmasked young children people fictitious “medical mask exemptions.”.

I live couple blocks parents Always mask house, often need help. mask I’m there, too. definitely time move in.

I would rather cause illness likely hospitalization death - high risk due age factors.  preventive measures, any? hope Biden give shot arm (see there?). lol sure freedom work people would rather kill get prick arm? able update covid vaccine chip though 5g'. 

Sounds kinda lit ngl  seasonal influenza, mortality usually well 0.1% here's cheery news /s. could looking ""perpetual infection"" spring anyone feel completely hopeless news headlines sound like *this*? love spreadsheet. Here's [another track change time state. Even reason get glasses online. got couple pairs $15 zenni.com years ago. hitch need know prescription. They're panic attacks. They're sorta like awful sleep paralysis things happens sleep day tired ICU availability 0% socal that's assuming everyone wants take vaccine vaccine good 1 year? government better reopening plan day comes agreeing clear evidence whether surgical masks cloth masks better reducing transmission? Well written accurate, unfortunately falling many deaf ears. mixing brother Pat Damon. worry, common mistake. Hi, bat here! There's viruses coming. Trust me, I'm bat. admitted pretend give fuck covid deaths. played yourself. Racist vaccine free everyone America?  crew member tell you, internally shit show.

They everything press that's it.

They've sending people cover shifts stores active outbreaks (they've done multiple times taking people store sending stores outbreaks). send crew back, usually days weeks later store 0 time quarantine.

When cases store wait tell us 8 days someone tested positive.

A pandemic declared March 13th, 2020. 2 weeks later could wear masks / gloves. People sent home crazy wanted PPE 

The overall transparency awful. think caught it? don’t doubt there’s cost associated that, people _actually_ getting charged? quickly country vaccinating people?? OK trying weird reason asked heard medical person talking fact previously unopened sterile test swabs found covid ends them. I'm trying conspiracy trying figure stuff out. Thank goodness everybody family's OK though. Probably, hopefully...

Do know anything? kid shops closed 6 p.m. Everybody cramming grocery store time.

People smart.

Shopping hours German speaking areas might feel bit limited visitor even regular conditions.

Ordering groceries home grown rapidly too. Same! never much faith humanity, reason naive though would bring us together. Boy wrong! makes sad I’m never going look people anymore. innocent person, feel like last bit innocence stripped away.  Seriously, retail workers considered ""essential"" beginning, among first groups people get vaccine. encounter thousands people county every day work. They're major vectors virus, ensuring they're safer ""essential"" job also safeguarding workers spreading virus customers symptoms show best interest people. 

Unless, is, y'all fine going Walmart pick bread, milk, eggs, COVID-19. restaurant industry makes jaded like that, I’m way defending idiotic practice, industry doesn’t attract best people, veterans expect worst employees treat disposable. hurts business long run, idk many times I’ve lent employees money invested ton time vanish. sucks success stories burns. roommate last year obsessed those. thought thing since quirky like me, different ways. i’m wondering everyone thing slowly push needle in- go fast- get better try holding syringe thumb index like dart - move hand like practicing aim dart- don’t let go! basically, they're back ""we're getting long time, even vaccines""?

And wonder people feeling hopeless saying ""fuck it"".

I'm suicidal, what's point living going like years end?  Fine. say bring army enact fierce crackdown. I'd sign up. I'd rather take chances slowly dying intubated hospital left die like they're patients Texas.

I'm open minded here. willing support measure, however totalitarian, puts end virus that's killing 4,000 Americans every day. no, ""it's beyond containment"" miss that, too.

We contain balls leave table use extreme military force people hell bent damned determined get neighbors infected. COVID wasn’t factor like you’re dealing with. worked crazy hours crazy stressful job several years. takes toll health catches you. miss lot along way. I’m way better place now. Hope happens don’t regret listening internet stranger. Ive since started mine whole staff outside, wiping cart, providing sanitizer masks, counting shoppers, making sure line distanced.

Is something like what’s situation completely curious hate

Feel bad often say person outside store 100% time explicitly counting people (or even best way since errors would compound day) track number people store. 

Given many stores already that, there's plenty analytical data available get good number many people store one time. Keep mind like go arbitrary limit becomes significantly dangerous. aggregate risk. long average goal without extreme deviations, risk reduction effective.

Be careful put much value something requires extra man hours, may appreciably impact transmission probability.  problem people arguing lockdowns mask mandates, look now. emergency department. get one N95 day throw surgical masks gowns time leave COVID positive rule room. I’m dealing COVID patients whole day. people don’t need hospital, man. Chill fuck out. Well. terrible also true. nonsense ashamed. True. Thank reading. Yeah, woods yet. us healthcare workers luxury waiting pandemic we're tired - get paid enough that. would've holed relatives overseas could, instead mental breakdown found job lesser hit area. 
It's tough ask require people simply go groceries mask up. think willing point. Maybe March, certainly fatigue set in. often trust people govern us.

Cant blame one. Idk. I'm rebel. one living minimum wage jobs. entry level jobs entry level workers, kids, etc. raise minimum wages much kill jobs add even people unemployment rolls. 

Assume I'm going open sandwich shop (for example). profitable least would provide 10 employees (local youth) entry level jobs entry level wages (let's say $10-12$ hour). force $15 hour wage business longer profitable I'd close kids would go back unemployed. 

FWIW 20 employees think everyone gets $15 now. market forces us raise wages $15, local laws. hey, want raise minimum wage drive competition business would great me. would cost bunch lower wage people jobs make easier hire people increased competition jobs, raise wages higher time soon. suits powerful act one group.

Yep there's lots joint procurement also logistics, least Germany respective markets close. Might different US.

Wish could mail some.

It's supposed 90F tomorrow. January. 

I moved CA escape snow, even think *that's* little summery January. Exactly.  think Palestinians bots social media tell bad things Israel ? may true Palestinians way less resources think Israel use tactics Depends state. New York mandating 100% free people.   Right. months arguing sub whether vaccine possible, argument don’t know effective. argument well fully stop transmission? mean political end really doesn’t matter it’s perfect. long slows transmission vulnerable get vaccinated, defanged. People hardcore pearl clutching last remaining part allow world reopen 52% whole period first second dose (21 days). 10 days around 0% went around 90% after. demanding effort putting none on. Putting others posting relevant advice, repeating ""why?"". Tone matters even online. tell people stupid thing without able give scientific explanations reasons. 

And reason, chain minimal effort ""why"" posts gets upvoted, telling people use joke medical advice downvoted unless provide paper back up... mean, one deny immigrants good reason distrustful. vaccines large administered government. probably get supermarkets pharmacies.   Well case capitalism worked beautifully. I'm sure involving money equation suddenly makes ""low"" situation. Money supposed quantified version work. way, we're chipping get vaccine made distributed. unit use exchange goods. There's reason driver vaccine somehow ""low"".

The fact government paid much money it, reason lot money made that's world needs wants. Exactly capitalism work. course opposite situations work well may seem low. cases works well organically, pretty cool see. Correct. Random mutations random. likely hood variant gets mutation makes vaccines useless fucking low.

Also, apparently people think mutations work like Plague inc obviously case... Good trouble getting dose. Luckily.  No, no, 100% no. better yet make ba condition employment. Fear mongering bullshit Yeah, cluster here. Hope stay Marrowstone pleasant! ""Don't tell horribly wrong thing unless commit essay, defeats learning"" repeatedly posting ""why"" like four year old actually defeat learning.

If want learn, go askscience eli5. Put bit effort demanding others. shoot vaccine veins! good thing residents treated fairly past decade reason doubt good intentions US government.  I've working grocery year started another store *goddamn* store small. Old 50's-60's style store smaller square footage, 11 aisles, 4 checkout stands crammed close together four self-checkouts. gets busy, lines go halfway aisle, 10 customers deep. Everyone's wearing masks, goddamn. . . Yeah sounds problematic. wouldn’t say cutting benefits way go. improvement start end raising minimum wage people live one full time job.  think also community outreach. know much effort put informing hispanic community, whatever effort ineffective. covid floor like 50% spanish speaking. say bots posted UN website, tho? meant reddit propagate agendas. call conspiracy not, think certain level, several organizations try blow wind favorable way them, social media efficient medium. weird. Wife also work another optometry business, smaller one, proactively helped doctors get scheduled vaccination since they're right category (and indeed got shot). different approach.. I'm gonna file ""Things Made Sense Year Ago"" sub full people scared helping scared. think people tired take seriously.

That's COVID-19 causes chronic fatigue. /s  flatbreads? Nice forgo masks well? happens politicize disease. sucks I’m sorry caught it. school work ridiculous. shit load people tested positive, staff students. none transmitted work don’t want go remote. 
The one thing can’t wrap head around much common sense people don’t seem have. 

My wife exposed last week Friday student confirmed positive. didn’t let know Tuesday. told go home quarantine, course asked daughter quarantine go there. said no, keep coming test positive quarantine. course contacted hr told plan makes sense whatsoever. maybe quarantined well since we’ve contact wife weekend.  type pandemic need fucking ready for. may stroke I'm sure read right - demanding others wear mask properly around context 2 million deaths worldwide kaaren-ish?

Jfc, naive get? Listen, I'm going get vaccine like rational normal person, truth reality norm fundamentally changed. virus shifting strains fast fully trust effectiveness vaccine now, sad consequence mask still thing least 5 years. 

From point view, context, Karens ones get vaccine say fuck rest world taking mask. Vegetables come Camarican unemployment benefits percentage wage. always make working unemployed.

That makes sense me.

You would believe many idiotic laws systems set pay people work work. mention asinine tax laws punish making money point make another $1 cost thousands dollars benefits.

Anyway... Leider es ist wie es ist superspreader events happen work. They're due recreative social gatherings. Yeah par. Early roughly 0.5-0.6. Equals 5-6 times deadly seasonal flu.

Fully upgraded lenses UV/blue filters, glasses higher quality still hundreds dollars less chains. Wait, guys need pay vaccinations? another 4-6 weeks U.S. deficit spending decades.

This nothing new.

Foreign countries, like China (that manufactures everything U.S. consumes), ones U.S. borrows from. keep loaning more.

OSHA ordered let COVID run wild backoff employers, new objective OSHA actually protecting workers health safety becomes mission again. ignorant prick. dad even country club people around?

Or maybe value different things us. Although I'm struggling see appeal war, slavery, sickness ignorance. conservative Bavaria, Texas Germany! conservative require completely, callously, stupidly ignore global pandemic US? Kroger, giant eagle, meijers remember correctly kinda like that. Seems respectful, “if cold want protect getting it”. 

Unlikely thinking Americans sounds nice. Covid-realists hate second amendment something? totally right. bar restaurant, people either side look healthy, probably COVID-19. Currently plenty people would PAY 500$ get vaccine. Refusal issue, availability is. yet. understanding Government make vaccination mandatory (directly indirectly restricting services vaccinated people) would leave private businesses decide (which sounds reasonable me). immunity passport would therefore used businesses choose realistically Government provide passports, proof vaccinated. still lots unknowns. example, types masks delivery person wearing? wash dog immediately? easy slip up.

We similar live apartment. go outside unless take one cars drive (charge battery), bring deliveries upstairs (we use elevator) , throw trash away. beginning wore surgical mask increase cases wearing N95 mask. bought 10 months back reuse them. also wear latex gloves going out. food deliveries wiped Lysol wipes, deliveries sit couple days open them, plastic delivered items wiped Lysol wipes. virus live plastic metal quite long time. 24 hours boxes paper IIRC.

We careful wife high risk. 98% 65 older Yeah, it’s sucks, well good luck hope healthcare system improves! hesitant us starting vaccinate geriatric population first. Firstly, later life, someone dies within days getting people blame vaccine. Secondly, strong side effects second shot dozy older people. I'm disappointed right, honestly. thought least non-establishment right would correct idea, are. ""We winter"" argument valid, though. debunked long time ago. even seeing increased numbers warmer temperature countries well. shown history lockdowns actually contribute untracked increase contagion. So, keep grocery stores open, absolutely tracking all. But, close restaurants areas track customers notify exposure? Then, lockdown people still meet friends home increase infections without traced. awesome job explaining ""Medical Mysteries: black plague"". UK shit storm government locked everything hoping best. plan pandemic considered one worst implemented anyone else.
There's small risk risk groups. bubonic plague spanish flu, stop comparing that. Can't keep locking entire world less 1% population. Lock vaccinate asap move towards rest population, need get world moving again. Otherwise going see lot extremes this. suicides, mental health, wars, etc  not?

Norway that's 82.something years. think novel way get vaccines feel need be.....capitalism win! countries, IFR 0 - 0,31%. like this, like Trump either. giving unemployment unemployed jnder-employed, giving money everyone. People like need it, need - none us refuse cash check (because fucks us ethical enough say basic means tests). 

We enough debt country already, Trump ensured that. need start next admin adding another 2 trillion top that; mention costs everything else next 4 years US horribly imbalanced budget. 

If came bundled defense re-budget cut military spending half, great. came healthcare bill would solve insane payments billing system, direct saved money pay this, great. come that, really hope either two overdue changes within next 2 years (one senator break ranks, know will, health insurance companies fight tooth nail). summer US 0,5%. estimate suggest US 25-35% people infected virus. IFR would 0,33 - 0,47% talking office jobs. done home forget fucked US healthcare system is. already proper healthcare like countries, it’s absolutely trivial make cost free point service. Australian, it’s normal. 

That say, wouldn’t company’s responsibility organise begin with. read story yesterday Dollar General paying employees four hours pay get vaccine. No, Spain doctors public clinics see medical records. social security card number give doctor see record, tests, medications... check you’re lying. 

So really non issue far see. There’s already paper digital centralized record says vaccines (and diseases, hospitals stays, doctor visits, diagnosis...etc), Covid another one. issue would making public (right accessed doctors only) guess that's get access quality healthcare based ability pay. twice population close twice deaths? China need mistake, masks created equal, good us now? People still getting infected, disfigured, dying. Yes again. 🙋 autopsy complete yet, seems stem vaccine. lot needs known people died responsible recommendations made parts world.

It's blow vaccination effort - course family members died immune reaction. can't help find bit strange happened specific cluster exclusively Norway. Yeah, gotta love white collar ""Stay safe, stay home"". Hastag, laptop, morning coffee posts. Yep. NJ paid sick leave, 1 hour every 30 worked, 40. Employers provide more, less. isn’t limited full time employees. handful states Northeast also least form sick leave requirements.  needed.  Fuck dystopian bullshit, honestly. Anyone thinks America gonna stag locked longer spring delusional. I'm essential worker. I've wearing masks since long required everywhere. tell living like year. can't survive something 0.01% chance killing would die coronavirus anyway. heard instances vaccine disaster news sources, read trash news though. world's larges genomic sequencing projects, COG-UK. sequencing 10% RT-PCR tests. N

&amp;nbsp;

Z safest thing employees would implement online orders curbside pickup (or delivery). even easier, allow jobs require employment government benefits withheld refuse vaccine. Simple, cheap effective. False, did, would coronavirus spread right  saving lives goes everything country stands wonder country failing. 

PS: whole, ""freedom"" common sense argument actual basis US History. government imposed far burdensome restrictions many times past. look WW2 instance. states lockdown, covid19 figures drop Biden looks like much better president Trump.

The states refuse lockdown, covid19 continues rise Biden looks like much better president Trump. anecdotal someone know experiencing warped smells mentioned marijuana temporarily relieves condition. others? also increasingly dificult travel states within country. Whenever one state records small hand-full cases, states slam borders shut. 

I stuck NSW family 10 days recently waiting Victorian border open, even though cases regional NSW several months. 

Even now, came regional NSW, I'm legally allowed leave apartment get negative Covid test result. Unfortunately costco near nothing encourage mask wearing social distancing. self check people top one another isn’t really self check employees still scanning. door limits despite state mandates. shit show. never had. summer! country visitors, NZ sized middle European country? Access counts. Trader Joe's fucking awesome, period. super market (and wife go plenty - wegmens, giant, shoppers, whole foods, etc.), got pandemic process control. actively count entry store, WIPE carts front ready go, give hand sanitizer enter, etc. etc. 

On top that, awesome food especially frozen stuff little snacks mints (green tea mints) crazy good. live country effective contract tracing testing, big vector we'd know. little late, Merkel---Deaths surging Germany Pfizer variety FAVORITE! looking thru wrong filter dude. think NZ requires negative test. put quarantine matter what. Real quarantine, none fake ""stay home please"" rubbish. test 2 different points, can't get without negative test, can't get time even test negative.

But yes. Almost every country making effort whatsoever. lockdown thing? Works part well-coordinated plan (see NZ). Kinda works sometimes (see Europe spring). work half-ass (see Europe USA whole time). want know whether vector vaccine create immunity adenovirus become less effective multiple use. US remains 6th place deaths per million Western world Regardless, let's like China!

They seem know control virus.......  Porn. Lots lots porn. Dude, policy unique Sweden. Ireland, UK, Belgium even broader criteria.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* lol yet another know-nothing yank weighing UK relationships like he's authority it. I’m gonna focus energy get vaxx needs go? That’s crazy naive. got good healthcare, don’t. got bigger problems Covid 🤷🏼‍♂️

Your bigger problems whining foreigners coming US getting vaccinated? mean, thing happens here, foreigners even pay.

My point greater problem lack access affordable healthcare America, rather whining someone getting healthcare *maybe* shouldn't, worry fact healthcare universal right; people chose abstain visiting doctor risk financial ruin. hit floor? Oh that’s great system. value (shoppers) much, helping huge chore, always make sure tip high since I’m never sure works behind scenes . they’re getting whole time I’ll give door sounds like tips go shopper right? work grocery chain, trader Joe's, we've getting free shots since day one.... Yeah effort totally wasted, let's vaccinate them! /s

Except every encounter leads infection adhere hygiene rules. that's probably 95% getting infected remaining 5% still protection provided vaccine Agreed. stimulus checks regressive immoral. burdening future generations debt already burdening global warming abd many problems. expanded unemployment checks absolutely needed, stimulus checks (95% go people lose job) make sense. Stimulus needed point time issue lack aggregate demand, restrictions put place curb virus fear virus. way fix economy eliminate virus. stimulus checks little. mostly either saved spent place like Amazon we're really stimulating China's economy, own. America borders closed Yeah, fireable offense. I've seen multiple people get fired it. consider stealing company time. Yup, same. 90 minutes round me, worth it. employees nice, food good, prices decent. robust selection fresh veggies meats I’d probably even often. Then, make everyone involved food supply chain.

Can tell NZ *didn't* food supply problems? Obviously sorted out. whatever did. Third wave? 2nd end? even first?  entry points: yes. 14 hours: no. sure think 14 hours relevant. takes 4 hours get Australia New Zealand. say was, also need rules specifically codified law impact us. government created 40-hour work week employees around time New Deal, likely good reason even unintended side effects.

Companies quickly follow suit since compete labor pool government. companies offer benefits like healthcare expected work 40 hours week. Certain types retirement funds investments also limited based whether considered ""full-time"" employee.

Legally required? No, though gray area government jobs since may laws defining benefits packages tied work hours. everyone effectively required, regardless laws books. would test it?

Put infected one room full people clean quarantined 24/7 least week. 

see:   ""Few entry points"" relative. guess what. Since less people traveling, funnel small number entry points! many international airports USA really need, handle traffic pandemic? Yeah also worth noting people live apartments “safe” area enjoy outdoors probably cracked LONG someone nice backyard lots hobbies could outside Smashing cuzzies. 

Chur Hu what? Aldi Süd here, frequently going Nord well. really ugly stores, remodeled store mostly okay. new aldi Süd still much nicer (except 2 level freezers), especially bakery aisles instead machines 

What abandoned Nord concept talking about? that’s price pay citizens here. always extremely strict laws coming leaving country. bring in, vaccinations must have. COVID mostly another check mark list things deal with. people saying get ""majority"" immunity even within week. 33% majority nowhere near 95% saying earlier true. Covid dies 2 weeks. need stop making Covid babies, 2 weeks, existing Covid dead Covid. Damn. work Albertsons.


Edit: wouldn’t expect pay vaccine either, trying even get right Arizona joke. easiest thing retailers could employees administer them, insurance. international travel

is stopped point! actually would fit America really well. arrogance Libs ignorance Conservatives. think know talking about, read American life. 

I’m gonna focus energy get vaxx needs go? That’s crazy naive. got good healthcare, don’t. got bigger problems Covid 🤷🏼‍♂️ IMO either close open them. like virus spreads 6pm knitting shops 35million people got vaccinated, true L.A. California going recent years 😰 Explain ""necessary travel"" Florida time falsifying numbers average. multiple overlapping reasons. 

This virus appear worse winter months, Florida fairly warm humid climate year. Even large Florida cities tend less densely populated would find northeast. Florida really lagging reporting deaths.  EU too, 400M doses ordered, enough everyone. (Well, 200M 200M option additional order still. enough combined others.) ""Get Ready False Side Effects"" take 10 million people wave hand back forth upper arms, next two months would expect see 4,000 heart attacks. 4,000 strokes. 9,000 new diagnoses cancer. 14,000 ten million die, usual all-causes mortality. one would notice. That’s many people die get sick took ten million people gave new vaccine instead, there’s real danger heart attacks, cancer diagnoses, deaths attributed vaccine. mean, reach large enough population, literally going cases someone gets vaccine drops dead next day (just would didn’t get spent whole year taking precautions also others. Even get infected yourself, efforts helped keep infections vulnerable people. sacrifice definitely nothing. I've received grand total $110 stimulus packages put together. I'm quite fortunate lose job March would've fucked far government concerned. one thing learned pandemic cannot way rely government take care crisis. I'm anticipating getting anything significance stimulus package. title article misleading. main finding CDC article referenced antibody testing cannot reliably used determine previous infection, immunity wanes overtime. drop antibodies mean loss immunity.

From [CDC discussion: “These antibody declines might equate loss protective immunity increased risk reinfection; assessed study.” would worried retirement still student loan debt?   US Military? go home? Stores closed time, Corona Corona.  mention higher number imbeciles refuse social distance, wear masks take necessary precautions reduce spread. Costco employee here. That's plan since we'll part rollout. Yup ! Same. Self evaluation growth hard. Pointing finger side blaming easy. Hopefully one day people change I'm holding breath lol. Cheers!! Well, data mean responsible it. I'm Ecuador folks really believe stuff. one US already surpassed back q2? Yeah, really pedantic it? Thankfully department ample supply currently dispose every Covid call take chances.  plan serious supply issue one per shift kept paper bag use. surgical top mask would help keep clean too. hospitals near one mask per shift rule. much bill get vaccine administered? mind asking. Would make lot sense current plan many levels. mean everyone suited staying inside 24/7 yeah get mean  guess less 3 months people unless personal reason go longer, I.e. high risk loved one household, high risk, etc etc . obviously last longer us give 3 months uk battlefield mutations? 400 division Yeah, death work since beginning pandemic older woman died. lot people work gotten sick point since essential workers. Good them! appointment 2.5 hours, mostly paperwork. know nice meet new people. Gave blood samples, platlette donations every 2 weeks past 10 years, nothing.  

The night jab rough night, felt quite lethargic next day small headache mild nausea. vaccine? bad night's sleep. happens politicize disease.

Italy never politicize disease. They're no.1 per capita death. Pretty sure western individualism thing. US never trained big fight personal freedom important father mother dying? OK, people would be. happen love parents personal freedoms. couple stores near CA letting people without mask last month. lie medical condition. legal places lol Aldi Süd (south) Aldi US. Aldi Nord (north) TJ. North south bc Aldi owned german brothers splitted company half. seems prudent route given flub beginning Trumdemic. control now, controllable. Max vax sap. I’m gonna get then, NOICE far correct. find better employees, them, pretty difficult get encouragement job can't even pay necessities. 

And pay them, won't. know huge fast food joints collectively monopoly regional take food location lands own. even complex that, there's good starting point Pregnant women, immunocompromised can’t get vaccines likely die covid, etc. Totally pointless measure! Butter brickle ice cream much paying employees get vaccine?  firm, polite, slight smart-ass, you’ll fine. Safety first! also, mates handling you. ""soft"" lockdown probably skipped 3rd period zoom class browse reddit. Money printer go BRRRRRR Idk didn’t seem lung/breathing issues. Well company wants hurry get tested since boyfriend, live with, tested positive. company cares, it’s negative, still come in. can’t socially distance optometry patients work either. test negative Saturday still go in. Even though live covid positive boyfriend. Yup. He's got point. Look medication home read leaflet lists every possible side effect. sometimes sound abit scary reality extremely rare happen you. list incase rare event unfortunately happen legally they're covered. Wow, ironically non-lockdown covid-denying states. shocker. vote thinking entitled journalism free. No. find hard believe anyone would agree article truthful. It’s ok. need discuss anymore. Makes sense me. Thanks explanation Crazy think we’re approaching Spanish Flu death toll 675,000. took 2 years Spanish Flu kill 675,000 Americans 100 years ago. 

It took less year COVID-19 kill 397,994 Americans. Tomorrow 400,000 deaths.

If trend continues, COVID-19 death toll surpass Spanish Flu death toll possibly March. sooner.

And survive it, knows many millions permanently disabled. 

Some could avoided people listened doctors scientists. selfish people country. 

My sympathies healthcare system. very, small amount people. Hej mods, think valid question ask people unaware actually large (close 15%) part COVID-19 casulaties underlying conditions. sick weak deadly outcome. think contribution low-quality information (it question, really). Could please reinstate it?  Publix giving employees free.   tripe look data. countries worse Nordic countries need English reading teacher? find one  boat. Why's that? doubling rate linear like community restrictions place, look Manaus prevalent continues cause problems, really need vaccines ASAP need predict anything, model it. High infection rates overshoot HIT significantly. opinion, maths. Might well say 100% due virus. Interaction factors thing. 

I’m pretty sure weren’t could malaria COVID, either. That’s horrible, agree there.

It sucks everyone many things world horrible. calling percentages though we’re talking individuals speaking little respect empathy correct imho, COVID malaria. longer uncontrolled population, longer mutate render vaccine ineffective.  party that? Democrats biggest obstacle us functioning single payer healthcare system. republicans don’t even oppose Democrats them. doctor, shouldn’t take vaccine within 90 days covid. Haha ever thought buying tips lower gauge draw liquid? shoot test weekly draw 18 gauge shoot 22.  understanding, still possible transmit virus you’re immune, would like first virus possible with. So, I’m one. summation really people old ill matter happened would die soon. one things people need consider thoroughly: many people close dying giving vaccine waste time anyway. Isn´t good thing?

Studys show people Covid similarly immune people got vaccine. thats win already 1/3 people LA immune it, right? nursing home helped do. cameras hallway skip steps infection control officer give talk. masks changed residents unless want to, everything else face shields gowns are, mandatory hand cleaning gloves. Virus give shit politics. confirm sucks here. Wife's work shut one coworker went holiday party boyfriend's family, got virus, went work knowing it. Passed like shitty game telephone. Hannaford let exposed people work long “show symptoms” covdi19 average mutates 2x month

thousands, millions people infected simply give chances mutate hundred thousand

If area 10,000 people active infection infection lasts 2 weeks 10,000 mutations. illness last whole month 20,000 mutations city/state/district/?

now multiply world wide active infections

then add lingering illness. one theory UK variant developed someone immunocompromised nearly 20 mutations. least one documented case got paper written it

someone change anything significant, didly

Others might make strain weaker way, maybe end line variant even

the danger can't control way mutation can't keep mutating something dangerous - transmissible something makes people sicker iis deadly kids changes much vaccines much less effective &amp; people likely get reinfected ..

add travel local people get one variant once. share mutations

and need keep said months - masks, distancing, hygiene limiting contact much possible without people outside household. get chance get vax barring medical Even easier hit fat. Also painless. save money. technology good Taiwan Canada patients Except, 2 weeks later it’s possible 3 longer positive point/ didn’t enough viral load left nasal cavity test positive. Also people test positive 6 months later. So, story doesn’t mean much anyone. paying minimum wage human minimum wage necessarily mean get higher quality employee vaccine 95% effective, employees encounter 100 people asymptomatic contagious covid, vaccinated employees still stand chance catching virus “Quarantine Center” TJ’s doesn’t variety. sell one type specific item, that’s it, cases. they’re selling products every store across US. buy massive volume this, much volume normal store would. British man. need respect viruses. Remember negative rapid test 50% accurate. isn’t communicated well places think really hinges immunity escaping mutations take hold, much longer ride No, we're allowed shop clock. Mutants everywhere Healthcare one many many industries shit like that. used one common examples. Education, manufacturing, taxes, business.. find examples preadtory shit almost every industry here.

We knowingly reward shitty practices punish abuse. Oh well Chinese government said it, must true. Note distinction surgical N95 mask though. N95 melt blown fabric. also ok say might moved scientifically since 1918. problem!! worth try carry weight world shoulders too. real easy get sucked rabbit hole shit can't fix. recent bioRxiv* preprint paper, researchers Belgium USA discuss study used sophisticated phylodynamic methods confirm rapid rise SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 ""Variant Concern"" likely result global dispersal rather convergent evolution various sources. correct, important context parallel statistic based entirely death certificates end year statistic counted official cause death. explain detail:

FHM Public Health Authority Sweden, issue first-order official count ""people died **with** COVID-19"" ""everyone died within 30 days tested positive COVID-19"". use counting method several reasons - 1/ death certificates official cause death take weeks properly reported use rush doctors write faster time already busy keeping people alive; 2/ method used annually seasonal flu epidemics keep track potential death counts, already existing procedures used familiar; 3/ thanks de-centralized health care system Sweden, lag reporting deaths already quite large information contain something extra XX died DD/MM/YYYY. death notice actually reported tax agency within 2 working days, extra death information takes longer reported step (not full death certificate! takes even longer). That's FHM system uses reports arrived time, also every week Tuesday afternoon (so reported Wednesday numbers) makes far simpler cross-check tax agency's death register database positive COVID-19 tests. 

Socialstyrelsen Board Health Welfare Swedish authority oversees healthcare social care like elderly homes, also aspects. collect actual death statistics based death certificates publish parallel statistic, actually become official statistic ""deaths XX cause"" - COVID-19 different diseases on. statistic needs time collected - update published week see 11/1 received reports 9211 ""people died **of** COVID-19""; compared 9667 reported 12/1 9433 reported 8/1 FHM. 

It quite transparent start disadvantages system FHM statistic miss people tested time COVID-19 add people might died entirely reasons, deemed acceptable quick first-order metric casualties. Socialstyrelsen's statistic hand includes people diagnosed COVID-19 regardless got tested time discards people died virus unrelated reasons (other terminal disease accident), statistic takes much longer constructed. However statistics quite close (when look periods considered ""completed"" reporting) reporting numbers higher excess deaths causes, lends confidence statement ""unaccounted"" ""hidden"" COVID-19 deaths missed accounting. found article i've standard+thick tissue (and breathing mouth much possible, dark vader style) since beginning pandemic doctor would almost joke it... Deaths. Covid going cause lot long term issues lot people. preventing deaths also everything else. $7,500 vaccine then? No, no. Don’t see? Nothing good happens 6pm!! Clean skin properly, alcohol swab leave red mark - tell patients clean skin pretend went clubbing want mom see club stamp. That's hard rub. rub 15 seconds, stand back let alcohol dry naturally, fan it. go alcohol still wet, stings lot more. 

Let son guide fast slow push plunger. people like faster, slower.

Also, look Z track, minimize bleeding. Really works. 

You'll fine! Watch videos, practice pillow. Nope, totally real anti-imperialist. Wow, amazing achievement guys. Lol eradication. got bottle hard pills you. Americans find way like I've always said: I'm Trader Ho Trader Joe's  hope gets better. sounds like poor immune response case due short-term reinfection March-May. think truth Pfizer’s vaccine shouldn’t used? Maybe steal Coach Vogel's documents plant pipe bombs. Put heroin vaccine everyone want talk therapist. Imagine virus serious pay people take vaccine... Terrible article switches focus vaccination drive rather lady infected many people!!.  Don’t get hopes up. brother infected March, May, infected AGAIN. three times confirmed tests. Unfortunately time around developed pneumonia currently hospital type this. first time bad, second infection hardly noticeable, time worst. Sounds like Axonex. lasted 1.5 years. Side effects worse disease. Turns I’m progressive would worked anyway. using powerchair 5 years. !RemindMe 1 year Superiority complex hell drug There's number call state request vaccine. Try looking really know one half shortened life expectancy equation stage, people dying infection. side damage suffered infection resulting shorter lifespan. Lungs may expected fully recover or, damage sustained may lead complications later life. Damage sustained many hospitalised patients described quite similar heavy smokers lungs. idea effect be. many lied many telling truth? Well Israeli wants vaccine able get one end March, I'm 23 got first dose 2 weeks ago, drove grandma get nurse asked also wanted one...
This policy horrible countries slow vaccinate places like Israel cause discrimination due shortage vaccines. I'm Bama too. age occupation? giving bonuses bank articles. Read actual studies medical journals. bank got trouble funding terrorists?  even InstaCart offering incentive form cash. And, far tell, they're gig-worker reliant app sort. soon Trader Joe’s Leadership👍🏻 Trader Joe's day girl literally chilling front checkout 10 minutes, mask off, drinking water chatting phone. Pretty sure half dozen employees must seen none gave shit. San Diego. China put confirmed positive cases medical observation regardless symptoms, sort hospital quarantine center. idea prevent home community spread. Good read...factual, informative inspirational understandable..without hype hysteria. Thankyou! sad see death per day post number keep dropping Ok. Makes sense. Thanks. That’s called authoritarianism goes everything country stands for. Yeah people keep parroting like ramp up. getting started. vaccines approved month ago.

Maybe criminal president election would rate forever, thank god next guy least going pretend take seriously.

Also articles like kind dangerous IMO. makes seem like vaccines hopeless case might make general public less likely take it. Pepsi ok? feel lucky ""well"" this, fucking unlucky even first place. i'm remembering pandemic abroad fucking sad. i'd give last ten, even twenty years life make never happened. yeah sure, pandemic end, can't see light tunnel. “For severe frailty, even relatively mild vaccine side effects serious consequences,” Norwegian Institute Public Health said. “For short remaining life span anyway, benefit vaccine may marginal irrelevant.” thought so. someone shed light Manaus currently experiencing second wave even worse first? variant immunity achieved? failed America cowardly use army police enforce lockdown.

Letting virus keep spreading option. 4,000 people dying per day perfectly avoidable. Lockdowns mask mandates work enforced. Lockdowns problem. **Cowardice** government problem. Sorry, support CV 4.0 deprecated 18 months.

This ticket closed. places all. Israel done months good provide lot interesting data. states mandatory paid sick leave minimums. mind boggling pandemic hasn’t made universally obvious important people able stay home couple days instead sneezing coworkers spreading disease.  can't virus mutate defeat vaccine?

Science shown good evidence Covid simply mutate fast enough right ways render vaccine ineffective.

It may issue medium long term, one great benefits newer mRNA vaccines relatively easily quickly tweaked compensate new strains may evade current vaccines. Pfizer's CEO said could new vaccine ready six weeks.

The virus humans completely eradicated Earth Smallpox.

Also fun fact: still couple cases black death recorded US every year. rodents southwest fleas carry it. amazing internet access padded room. Wait one loved ones die this, see childish acting.

Also welcome block. tolerance childish personal attacks. wonder CCP release IFR stats frail close death recipients vaccines.  know anybody construction job started weeks ago. guy 2 months ago still terrible cough. can't work rooms we're demo gets dusty can't breathe. really scary tbh. dude construction 40 years without issues could end career. worst it. matter individual family, person decides want mask worth time, ""can't"" get sick, ""need hang friends"" they're ""being controlled"". exhausting. train anyone without significant mental impairments give vaccines hour. know I've trained myself. provided anything administer vaccine trained people hand adverse reactions etc. Speaking royalty, Norwegian King Queen got first jabs 2 days ago.

Both 83. reading eugenics, I'm one advocating it, are. company involved employees' healthcare decisions. Well lockdowns clearly aren’t working point trying.

The lockdowns failure beginning lockdown strategy requires 100 percent, damn near, compliance effective. 

You wish hope publicly shame people want, never effective. WHOA literally put Dune came across comment. Get head Scottish people considered higher oppression totem pole? Maybe main knowledge Scottish history watching Braveheart. 

Irish people British tend get offended suggestion. you/us assholes need wear fucking masks stay fuck home quit bitching

Who's gonna pay rent stay home whole time? Yes generally ADA works hate seeing many people dismiss fatigue brain fog, reported symptoms long covid. Hopefully never learn actually feel, they're hell. rarely cry video... government dismiss nonsense last month? dangerous virus is. pay us well. make $25.50hr I'm even management. pandemic gave us $2 raise I'm making $27.50. well 20% discount opposed regular 10. 
I also work part time Aldi. Fuck aldi. shit us.  want government give let death rates explode 5000 day, 6000 day, 10000 day?

If we're going sacrifice many lives economy civilization deserves wiped face map. Yeah alone reason enough work lol Maybe people need share insurance info act like getting vaccine. maybe know insurance. dunno, sounds like money making schemes. ol' ""let us hold money make interest file claim get back"" scheme. incentive, People get vaccine care others... smh, live shit world shoe fits Trumpdemic! Awesome!  local Trader Joe’s actively sought suppress employees speaking support BLM I’m torn this. I’m glad they’re encouraging people take Covid seriously worked many us Seattle protests peak Maybe rushed vaccinate Prince Phillip Queen UK. Thank sir. truth many mods like sub. truth everyone needs fight future. wish multi universes maybe, truth spread Dr Li Wenliang silenced. article says oppose requiring vaccine athletes. seems like best option, sure.
 Edit: oppose requiring vaccines, like won’t practical rely rollout vaccines slower expected, however, much humanity remain unvaccinated summer. Japan plan begin vaccinating citizens late February, process take people briefed strategy, I.O.C. Tokyo organizers factoring vaccines plans Games, instead assuming many roughly 10,000 athletes — tens thousands coaches officials traveling Games — received vaccination. Officials say requiring athletes vaccinated yet clear whether organizers would allow spectators attend Games, travel outside Japan Olympics. Japan instituted travel ban international visitors scheduled end Feb. 7, could extended. Elite athletes longer exempt it. agree disaster, top bottom countries, crushing small businesses, propping major corporations, can't go street get hair cut without jumping hoops. hundreds people Walmart, cant tell thats ""safer"". countries starting curfews fining people already nearly bankrupted... least small business... Yeah don’t even want it, get April local risk group gets access. hate rich people line cutters 🤷🏼‍♂️ Nyet hunch rural areas, Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine (expected March) silver bullet. single-dose storable room temperature  O:-) Thankfully I’ve never hit vein, knee swell size grapefruit though. shot low thigh physical day  modern Aldi Nord better modern Aldi Süd (which better classic Aldi Nord Aldi Süd). Unfortunately, decided abandon concept going back classic Aldi Nord.

/Aldi Süd user plenty vacations Nord territories.  misunderstanding I'm saying. Yes B.1.1.7 started UK. Yes spread outside rest world. different variants mutation developed separate countries. 

These variants different separate cocktail mutation contain among mutations ones make B.1.1.7 effective, due selection pressure making transmittable therefore likely reproduce. Exactly. living all, merely surviving. face face conversation anyone 10 months. I'm literally forgetting human. good says patients who've COVID-19 symptoms show severe chest X-ray every time, asymptomatic show severe chest X-ray 70% 80% time. understand, WP article (and CDC) referring people (yet) exhibiting symptoms. know PREsymptomatic people contribute. However true asymptomatics (which vaccine create millions of) likely spread virus MUCH less effectively pre-symp. They’re favorite grocery store period point. treat employees, treat customers, employees treat other... like I’m surprised place isn’t co-op, good job feeling friendly communal. OK want fight?? I'm ready.

But jokes aside, think Süd better? really feel difference North stores way modern kinda prettier Süd ones Ah stand corrected. Sonic Sez experiencing cough, chills, loss taste, that's GOOD. sucks you, reunification year literally meal gods marketing trick called ""segmentation"", similar reason coupons exist. 

If product costs £1 make sell 50 units £3 each, make £100 profit. dropped price £1.50 I'd sell lot - perhaps 150 units it, profit would smaller. I'd make £75.

Along comes Trader Joe's - they'll pay £1.50 secretly buy 120 units product labels they'll sell £2. TJs makes £60 make £60 deal **but** still sell mine store 'premium' version £3 each. I'll lose sales extra competition still sell 40 that's another £80; make £120 profit total. 20% would made single version.

[HEB vaccine-scheduler tool ... soon DSHS sends next batch vaccines ""we""? India going provide 20 millions? Underrated comment employers responsibility vaccinate employees. incentive encourage employees vaccinated US moves closer Phase 1C opening vaccinations essential workers. Reporting grocery stores would waste time misuse reporting system. Boof like real gangster. absolutely mad policy grants freedom utilise least (the elderly) keeps utilise (the young) locked up. policy puts mercy government vaccination efficiency vulnerability score. news unique Covid vaccines either. reason advise get flu shot well start flu season. ""99.9% survival rate""!

At point care Coronavirus get sick people? Small needles cause less scar tissue buildup big ones. Aspirating swabbing injection sites it’s visibly dirty obsolete recommended anymore. 

I’d recommend reading wiki, it’s meant steroid users practises same. think top thigh well. last two done butt though, I’m still working able stab myself. normally flinch I’m holding needle ends hurting bleeding though :/ someone would write article's ""research red flags chapter"" food, would cause quite stir. Depending location, loopholes people use wear mask indoors, regardless county regulations.

It's stupid immoral, allowed regardless employees feel. I'm glad TJ's recently stopped allowing it. where’s money coming from? wonder many people staff spread :/. work Amazon. free onsite testing FC. bit cold New Years, felt better days. next week, everyone else house coughs colds. got tested Monday, sure. really expect covid. Ehh...

The US near-constant state war, end fundamentally change US is. see kind change coming. Shouldnt seeing decrease cases really soon, mean even without vaccines 100 million people estimated gotten virus US? It’s really sad keep advocating apartheid keeping Palestinians getting vaccinated. need read actual news stories like NPR rather pro Israel propaganda. I’m hoping well. older father appointment (made earlier week) cancelled well. rebooked website morning, hoping it’s another false hope. sounds like lot taking consideration taxes cost living pretty average, maybe slightly average. current (soon former) president thinks test much.

I could imagine getting airplane unless knew everyone plane recently tested negative.

I riding bus subway. think require recent negative test that, never mind airplanes.

If uber, would mechanism drivers passengers upload negative test certificate would kicked system certificate gets old. have, actually! pointing particular article says, since discussion article. :-)

Do another source different perspective? I'd interested read it. got honest, really something watch success stories unfold sub week week still see sizable contingent subbers ride-or-die sweden end.

oceania SEA frequent recipients deserved praise, israel also hitting park beginning. takes educated, well-organized government educated, socially conscious people achieve have. good them. address put ticket? understand you’re saying grocery deliveries, least live, gig workers grocery workers. can’t say sure wouldn’t stay-at-home job otherwise, absolutely think policymakers incentivizing staying home right (aka paying us). regardless, circumstance economic privilege prevent potentially getting sick and/or dying increasing risk someone else. It’s choice have, choice refuse make. That's largely due border policy, least second wave. Also, Norway Finland necessarily comparable Sweden pandemic-wise they're overall similar countries. Denmark would appropriate comparison case, anything. Even starting salary that’s absurdly low seems like unnecessarily complicating vaccine queue. saw issues ages, weren’t getting enough people, lower age limit slightly. Going everyones habits backgrounds take long. Canadian power mutations, incoming ... 29 million Texans. 

Texas need administer additional 57 million doses. 1 million per month, take 4 years. [Well, guys beating us Canada. 29 days, we've managed vaccinate ""whopping"" 380k+ people....in country 38 million....when among first option vaccines.  Ughhhhhh course does. wants us infected. ones references used hypothesize sterilizing effect offer certainty whatsoever. Neither Pfizer moderna chose study sterilizing effects phase 3 trials data doesn’t exist support claim. 

So many armchair scientists sub claiming KNOW something one else does. awesome!!

Great countries get done. Otherwise politicians bureaucrats would tell us would impossible. Germany still vaccinated first Million yet. Despite fact Government gave 350 million Euro Biontech invented vaccine Pfizer produces Trump, Johnson Netanyahu smart enough buy. like either one guys much. vaccination statistics good comparison though.  too! stuff bomb! One issues Houston area 3 big vaccine hubs Harris County, none surrounding suburban exurban counties, counties trouble vaccinating frontline workers vulnerable populations. Yeah, point dankhorse made. bought offered money them. Yikes dickhead smh head Florida north Glad union. quit shopping usual grocery store stopped dealing union. Agreed. get vaccine I've waited necessary number days become effective, I'm gonna go see fucking friends. I've seen maybe 4 times since March. Good, able stop. Others lucky. dishonest think ""well it, everyone can!!!"". 

Again, one arguing last statement I'm sure keep repeating yourself. Feel free show I'm ok smokers get priority. Go ahead. Quote I'll leave alone Smoking hasn’t cool since early 80s. That’s lot last years. I’ve opposite happen. Several dad’s friends gotten sick days recovered that’s thinks happen. bad cold him. article really tell one anything quick math would tell you.

There's 230,000 new confirmed cases COVID day right US.

That's 1 1500 people. go 72 hours out, that's going 1 500 people. that's cases get confirmed. think current estimates catching 1 3 cases. 1 150. smallest planes going fewer 150 people odds there's least one person plane. Add fact people flying probably likely risky activities.


But really matter. Here's question want know: odds someone passing people next protocol followed. layers too: nose 5 minutes, 15 minutes, etc. etc.

Does turning vent thing anything me? people crowd aisle flight?

What leave middle seats empty? improvement? Negligible improvement?

I figure article told math, need record keeping effort know people COVID getting flights, need know HEPA filter cracked be. can't speak specifically, nutrients lose them, frozen foods lack lol like $25billion previous package passed December.

But [Bloomberg article estimates American households might $70 billion behind January. much owe come September? That's somewhat design though two stage nature vaccine. desperately need JJ (or one shot) vaccine mass rollout. logic.

not saying caused schools only. gonna tell room kids teacher 40 minutes together...and another room kids teachers 40 minutes...you're gonna tell spread chances virus.

&amp;nbsp;

Its like saying flying expose you. metal tube recycled air people close proximity you...for hours. chances greater. Yeah, thought. assume anyone who's flight pandemic exposed. Everybody getting dumb - people really understand result FAILURE stay locked longer spring, early shortages equipment, terrible advice politicians, Trump literally trying cover problem (he caught tape charged crimes humanity) instead coordinate response? refusing help states coordinate ""its job"". 

NONE needed happen. Vietnam fine neighbors China. poor country burned bombed stone age couple decades ago better COVID response us. Think that. experimental study. observations surgeon takes chest x-rays. one going acquiesce chest x-ray unless aware problem, come surprise large percentage chest x-rays awful. article epitome selection bias. going downplay said kid severe asthma controlled medication. Plus wife's doctor. I'm not. would advise them?

My intention find child would mean they're extremely high risk. course, high risk children exist. Approximately 100 children age 15 died COVID complications therefore children exist. However, statistically small must handful US children genuinely risk death.  Yes makes sense. Ok, basic math trying figure timeline vaccination rollout. Could anyone tell (extremely ballpark) estimates right track, I've missed something?

My sister law insistent wants get married Hawaii September 12 wants whole family fly over, adding surely we'll vaccinated then. boundary family none us attending we've received doses vaccine.

So, US given roughly 10 million doses thus far, means 5 million 330 million total people. estimate rate we're going, would take about, what, 8 years vaccinate everyone?

We've hit sobering new peak 4.5k deaths per day (for total fast approaching 400k).

Now Joe Biden, blasting ""dismal failure"" current rollout (which been), unveiled ambitious $160 billion vaccination plan aims inoculate 100 million people first 100 days. That's roughly third US population April 30th (if goes without hitch, lets assume pulls exercise). 

After filling interactive New York Times vaccine calculator, asked age, specific health conditions, frontline healthcare person, etc, ""in line"" behind 290 million people, leaving 40 million folks behind me.

At rate 100 mill per 100 days zero mistakes delays, end 200 million August 10th.

I'd tail end next wave, would put us 300 million November 20th. I'd probably get (first) shot around Halloween I'm lucky.

Of course, calculation generously assumes shots new plan begin inauguration day, let's believe Joe says ""first 100 days"".

Oh snap. Upon closer inspection, news headline says Biden aiming 100 million SHOTS, people vaccinated, first 100 days administration. take estimate double it, places vaccination likes in...early 2022, goes according plan?

Can someone kindly double-check math info present family, doubt try poke holes it?

Thanks much. already 2 million deaths around world Party country.  think reading question wrong.

They curious many people 45 get hooked smoking. Obviously nicotine powerful drug.

I think they're questioning many people even start smoking know bad us. Nicotine reason people start smoking. I'd say answer along lines fact young people bad weighing risk/reward. 15 trying fit think effects something may affect 50.  could wrong, considering olympics include teams entire world (which may vaccine access) traveling one destination, maybe that’s part it. athletes training too, don’t know much travel social interaction requires, maybe that’s also factor. Wow, that's bad pay $200 get COVID test without insurance. place could go get free 2 week waiting list drive daily full-capacity hours even opened everyday.

The CARES act great principle great practice. welll bought them, market rate. Totally worth though IMHO. variations quicker done it. hoping variations contagious lockdowns longer work finally execute plan done 9 months ago. live? I'm sure there's state teachers average little. Maybe that's starting salary? lol see many people smoke Europe... BS&amp;W, listening?  Source smokers much higher risk adjusted factors could objective? Sept?, California cases really feel though boots greatest example needing money. personal friend mine, otherwise healthy 26 year old close many others friend group passed away week...

I know deaths age group common older people, still happening around nation. younger people know who've hiking group able go hiking since lung capacity anymore (even mild) spells Covid.

Somehow, I've winning end past year Covid-Dodgeball, I'm vaccine, know hit hard time. arguing last statement made?

Apparently, state New Jersey.

That incredibly dishonest argument think know it. shove large amounts garbage throat live.... know....

I certainly do. fatty myself. knew bad me, took changes fix it. 

Regardless, post mostly aimed smokers anyway. WAY deserve priority anyone based harming choices. anyone says otherwise literally giving awards shit behavior, insanity. I'm nurse, think that's part procedure anyone died. give weekly intramuscular shots rheumatoid arthritis. bad. devices ""pen"" style. push part body tell to, click button, wait ten seconds, swab bandaid.

Depending insurance, drug company etc, I'm sure trained. Enbrel (the med take) sent nurse house spent around hour sitting me, showing injector works, giving specific sets steps always follow (washing hands after, exactly inject) watched administered first injection. super easy.  though. It’s people’s patience threshold. “Well what’s one year?”What gunna say every year? Sorry gunna fly. Saw guy buy pack 20 $37 Australian today. Target still good think solutions system like this? Plenty people medical conditions qualify current doctor, insurance network knows conditions, / access past health records. Maybe they've moved states transferred records. There's ton little ""gotchas"" start asking people prove eligibility, mention slow downs trying verify information first place. work within hospitals insurance companies, leaving lot disenfranchised people out.

Genuinely curious (or anyone else matter) think there's better way balance equality *and* speed deployment. argument people going lie, always always regardless system set up. fear lot people asking strict verification letting perfect enemy good. maybe that’s solution madness, start lobbing extra doses window, like darts arms people outside. Mardi Gras vaccinations. Prioritizing health care workers 65+ political decision leads needless loss life. science clear deaths avoided placing 65+ bracket ahead essential front line workers. Need info. agree. important muddle actual idea behind body positivity something works. seems trend internet bullies purposefully making movement ridiculous undermine message. smokers fact human beings That’s said “some form normalcy”. music venue, open 1/2 2/3 capacity patrons wearing masks (a real possibility start summer) way normalcy patrons getting day rapid test, separate drinking areas, etc. contented cats. sent poll every single middle school kid following questions, minimum 9 10 would answer affirmative (that dang 10th dentist).

Is smoking bad you? Yes/no

Does smoking cause cancer? Yes/no

The message there. People choose ignore it. There's something like $30bil plan rent relief, alongside eviction moratorium. nightmare almost understand entire airline industry make covid negative test mandatory requirement flying. would've reduced overall spread covid lot opinion. 

The argument see something realted cost tests honestly, flying able afford test. capitalist world made crime poor. traveled Bay Area LA Sep, surprised many people packed beach, malls without wearing masks. I’ve trying constantly 2 days. Nothing available NY. ""natural herd immunity"" rhetoric dangerous. reason message outcomes binary - death complete recovery - gotten people. point, information probably change minds, serve reinforce prudent behavior taking virus seriously. actually meeting Endo 2nd going ask process going work. 30 year old T1, state vaccine website listed 2 comorbidities phase 2 eligible weeks. guess try run BP appointment ;) ? mean, really, still do.  Jfc 20th yet tb0x spreads lots misinfo sub.

He one ppl wants beat Corona asap wishful thinking. traffic sub mostly driven type, discussion suffers bc it. New Yorker isnt fan way FL TX handled pandemic- absolutely nailed vaccine campaign. Credit due. 

Also, Im going debate anyone pandemic response. opinions. We've right wrong throughout pandemic. Im throwing kudos way. matters much random schmuck Reddit. pro sports leagues allowed players opt season. dad severe bacterial pneumonia three times. took 2 years regain full health recent time it. sure chest x-ray looks like, severe pneumonia takes LONG time recover from. may ask, type work home job doing? I’m looking forward good one. COL New Jersey also insane. 55 years seem right.

Since vaccine available month, seems unfair use current data predict full year's worth vaccinations. 1 month would fair. 


11.9 million doses month \* 12 months = 142.8 million doses. gets us 656.4 million doses 4.6 years. Humans main vector coronavirus. No, say expected reduce transmission, will.  said entirely eliminate transmission. press release calling question suggests thing, paper linked above. Neither state vaccines reduce transmission. simply say transmission go 0% (even everyone vaccinated) 

 That's 'ass talk'. Intramuscular vaccines work respiratory infections. flight's hour half so. Also planes limited capacity, middle seats sit anyone traveling with.

I wore cloth mask N95 never took second got airport end uber drive destination. grocery store area still line get in. 4.

Can share results here? it? odds already low young healthy person dying without vaccine. you’re adding 95% effective vaccine mix.

What’s 5% 0.5%? take risk every time get car.

The experts extremely irresponsible. think they’re hedging small number new cases vaccinated people, they’re really encouraging hopelessness people haven’t vaccinated yet.  that's interesting me. 

I live NYC know lot people it. worse others.

I personally lose anyone yet, number people know lost parents grandparents. 

I friends work nurses, doctors, EMTs, nursing home staff seen shit. March/April. Summer quiet. Ramped back fall. guess nice want cancel bank account without paperwork  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. traffic deaths jumped dramatically coronavirus lockdowns ended 2020, rising 13.1% three months ending Sept. 30 highest rate since 2005 despite decline driving, auto safety regulators said Wednesday.

In total, 11,260 people died U.S. roads third quarter 2020, 9,953 three-month period 2019, according preliminary data released National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).

The fatality rate jumped 1.48 deaths per 100 million miles traveled vehicle miles traveled declined 14.5% 2019 levels first nine months year.

The auto safety agency said ""deeply concerned trends highway safety evident preliminary 2020 data.""

In open letter drivers Wednesday, NHTSA urged action address ""terrible trend.""

The agency's letter said ""fewer Americans drove took risks fatal crashes. ... It’s irresponsible illegal drive influence drugs alcohol, puts life risk lives others.""

Some experts say U.S. roads became less crowded, motorists engaged unsafe behavior, including perceived police less likely issue tickets COVID-19 data suggests higher number serious crashes last year involved drug alcohol use previously.

NHTSA said October study early crash data pandemic lockdowns found ""drivers remained roads engaged risky behavior, including speeding, failing wear seat belts, driving influence drugs alcohol.""

NHTSA said Wednesday fatalities fell 19% April 2.7% May, jumped 16% June rose 13% next three months. took 12 flights July November; tested positive virus (PCR antibody), entirely possible fly without certainty exposure.

However, first class (more spread out), never removed even touched mask flight. Curious know level mucosal IgA. 

Also, memory cells remain. cost living New Jersey gawd-dang high. need 105,000k year earn reasonable living NJ, compared \~$45k year places like Oklahoma. failed (perhaps change failing) state would come disastrous response vaccine far. 

We’re terrible vaccine uptake numbers, mentioned, everyone else too. 

However number countries handled virus much better have.

But yes, US easy dunk we’re shithole country. Azar also claiming you’d vaccine widely available everyone summer. Making Biden look bad future always plan. I'll need dig information this, least Ohio, roughly 60% healthcare workers working retirement home settings refused vaccine far. Obviously one data point. hope right. 

We vaccine reserve Governor Oregon happy majority local health departments giving free insurance needed. Contact local one Google search something like ""(your state) covid vaccination health department"" sure is, vaccination rate pretty slow lot places. life goes two distinct phases: happy microwave chicken tikka masala, pissed ran microwave chicken tikka masala. [Oregon Governor tweets confirmation federal reserve wasn’t sure anyone else seen this, news spreading last hour I’ve already seen 2 headlines quoting tweet well. Haven’t seen shared yet. many us trying many others burnt out. know people want give masks work bc feels useless constant flow customers/clients/patients aren’t wearing them. people careless.

I’ve isolated since March. Even mild respiratory infections sent hospital past don’t risk covid despite young fit. I’m frustrated understand burnout (but anti maskers...)  ""Do COVID?""

Yes

""Sorry, can't fly today""

Oh wait, meant No

""Great! Enjoy flight"" Even worse

Deaths take month we're watching beginning holiday season consequences. lost smell/taste, long take regain senses? anything help something I'll wait out? 

Symptoms started last week, got positive test Monday, I'm week quarantine. Smell gone Saturday (day 3-4 symptoms) taste went away soon after. gotta make sure 5G microchips saturated vaccine. /S I’m saying it’s Israel’s responsibility provide vaccines Palestinian Territories (although current government actually cared peace cooperative vaccination strategy might good policy) rather Israel still important level control Palestinian healthcare, play role vaccination West Bank. current government shrugged said “not responsibility”, could actively harm Palestinian vaccination efforts Israeli public health since substantial number Palestinians work Jewish settlements Jerusalem. Also, genuinely don’t know answer this, wonder wether Israeli-Egyptian blockade Gaza affects importation vaccines essential medicines healthcare items. I’d assume goods military value allowed in, I’ve read enough stories Gazan smuggling doubts. Haha dude wrong rep sub horrible really would speaking Since seems voluntary actions whatsoever critical parts society - least past 4 months- , study kind self-denying. Yeah seems overly pessimistic vaccines getting approval help lot.

And Pfizer Moderna getting us 400m doses like July.

But people though spring/early summer would back normal following current math. I’m expert. I’m betting May - July something resembles normal herd immunity that. Certainly 4 years unless factory blows something. NY started opening things single digit deaths per day. Cali opened still 100+ per day. never really got things anywhere near control Lol can’t believe gotta bribe people take vaccine top HHS lying here, also means production going nearly well Pfizer+Moderna thought.  thinking hiccups mostly solved track deliver 100M doses end March. seems like they've produced 15M last month need double production immediately order hit target. Yeah it’s experts CDC making recommendations I’m sure know don’t understand decided put T2D front T1D   Therein lies problem. Sure assholes take seriously, least experience people know getting infected working adults trying survive. disagree you. democrats today republicans yesterday. thing democrats done past decades shift right.

That literally point above, due events 80s 90s, led Democrats shifting right. starting see swing back left, electoral consequences (the called progressive wing, pretty small 2016).

Voting consistently Democrat pushes window left.

As said Overton window's wiki According Lehman, coined term, ""The common misconception lawmakers business shifting Overton window. absolutely false. Lawmakers actually business detecting window is, moving accordance it."" Good thing people vaccinated that’s already going happen. makes think would taxes raised? bit buried article, Biden announced would release reserves, Azar said would ""shortsighted potentially unethical."" already secretly done exactly week earlier. deeply malignant. ensure ""equality"" micro level demographics

What like allowing doses black people something? Slow rollout expensive pfizer moderna vaccine way profit J&amp;J vaccine even tho less effective. caveat initial statement coming perspective someone relatively young healthy, works remotely. time I'm vaccinated, every vulnerable person vaccinated. They’ve delivered 30 million 12 million used. 

I don’t see anyone complaining lack vaccines 66% they’ve made can’t distribute anyway. 

We need mass vaccination centers every state vaccine actually used. Sadly nearest one hour out. Chicago smokers drive Indiana buy cigs. cost half much Chicago, far drive, way back fill gas since least dollar/gallon cheaper Indiana. Military politicians would guess. like super dense south I-84, wildly variable north it. got everything Buffalo-Rochester-Syracuse-Albany wild lands Adirondacks. certainly try. note places require appointment though depends screening procedures whether even get access facility. going need doses eventually too.   LA literally throwing vaccines trash instructed damn health department. work hospital give us free vaccine free day choose within 48hrs vaccine dose. impression comes goverment workmans comp. case? I’m sorry what? US still top 4 vaccine distribution needles arms. also many times bigger 3 countries currently top 4 vaccine distribution/injection. Doesnt mean every country “failed state” well? know Reddit’s favorite pass time dunking US makes feel superior let’s completely honest here. smart watch indicate (stress levels etc)?  think worst back November December. vaccines rolled I'm starting feel theres finally sliver light end tunnel.  brain automatically, “Well, you’d think Whole Foods would pay employee vac......”Oh, never mind d” don’t understand you’re trying say. Dumb article.

Most already socializing living lives. 

I dislike disconnect articles like reality ground. way Bloomberg reporting seems bit overblown. risk seems apply small minority individuals 80.

A bit context “We alarmed this. quite clear vaccines little risk, small exception frailest patients,” Steinar Madsen, medical director agency, told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.  must carefully consider vaccinated. frail end life vaccinated individual assessment,” added. makes feel better, 'cooked' microwave, reheated. made delicious mac cheese oven reheated microwave next day, it'd great, too. Canada also affected this: MIL medical assistant usually took trip in-laws house every 2 weeks it. It’s cool they’re susceptible reinfection year two bc gives us sufficient time roll vaccine stuff. Similar yearly flu vaccine something like  wouldnt say big reaction brain fog fatigue sure Actually, probably truth this. 1 every 500 New York. I’m smoker that’s fucked. maybe time away certain subs would help common *I think?* common?

What shit headline disagree you. democrats today republicans yesterday. thing democrats done past decades shift right. 

By logic simply voting blue cause shift leftward? Lol everything still open, people go day night, schools closed, cases getting higher daily one variant found, there'll interest see others evolved. science works. Yeah mean that’s would do. I’d tempted smoke cigarette say I’m smoker too. Still change fact exposed places go, good ventilation airplane continuously cycling old air new air in.

The fact people getting sick planes. Puurs? Obvioulsy cases. believe baffling me. wake No. US, insurance, billed part medical professional injects it.
The cost vary based location/state receive in.

I think $75 average
But anything remaining insurance pays?
Unlike nonCovid times, pay remainder.
It’s discharged/will billed later on. 

I think billings used later receive rebates refunds state agencies, submitted tax returns groups administering providing vaccines. mean due respect, literally read newest comment thread right now. entire premise care 400,000 COVID deaths lot people die every day somewhere anyway.

Shit, gotta pick smoking now. friend Mississippi tried sign elderly relatives. 7000+ queue registration. available now. Sweden ten times death rate Norway Finland sure arrived 85%, 44 6600 0.7%.

44 6600 wrong way look every single person study exposed virus. reality, 0.7% people *could have* gotten virus, didn’t. 85% figure comes much difference rate infections saw people SARS-COV-2 antibodies without. minimum.

This probably isn’t true. 85% possible estimate *people SARS-COV-2 antibodies* circulation. There’s subset people catch virus never seroconvert develop antibodies, lose quickly. included people study would almost certainly see lower levels protection. something like 33 confirmed, documented reinfections

Your info date months now. fact every study looked reinfections able find least handful them. isn’t extremely rare event people sub wishing is. quite alright, dear. might start posting notes briefings instead daily discussion, May another person posting daily posts numbers. bit weird official website posts stopped reuters ones allowed, long post discuss development Sweden only, think better Daily Discussion Post tried exile us. remember back February israel decided stop flights country. many people said overkill. I've seen studies IFR ranging 0.25% 0.60%.

The problem studies nobody really knows ""I"" is. measure cases can't measure infections many people asymptomatic. IFR really comes estimate ""I"".

Gottlieb others saying think 25-30% population infected. They're saying 1 3 LA county infected. 30%, 100 million infections US 400k fatalities IFR 0.4%.

But one thing keep mind 80-90% fatalities concentrated 65+ health conditions. 40% nursing homes. Say 80%, vulnerable population IFR 0.08%. IHME model, updated right Christmas, showed 400,000 mid-January 450,000 480,000 February 1. know frequently update models.  Lmao, compared NY &amp; California, I’d say that’s pretty damn good would nice paid workers living wage.

I NY past week we've ramping 24/7 vaccine hubs well increasing number people eligible vaccine. went letting 75+ people 65+ people one day.

We counting ""second doses"" immediately. would huge wave supply.

However, Washington Post also reporting never ""second dose"" held storage. already shipping full supply since NYC today's press release, 186k first doses available. 

Consequently, hospitals cancelling vaccine Much. Rage. commented p-score applicable not. commented statements Data Denmark can’t find particularly strong flu seasons last five years - would influence Data.

My faith humanity definitely shattered recent times.

This species really, really stupid. Kind amazed I'd never heard one before, tbh. Flight attendants young therefore decent proportion likely asymptomatic mildly symptomatic get tested. really need random testing determine prevelance. actually correct answer. Yes airplanes CYCLE air quick pace pulling sort viruses surfaces magically stopping person breathing virus fresh air pumped in. 

The good thing airplanes system is, generally, get clean fresh air necessarily containment free air.   Sure, dying family members take care themselves! :) case across country.

Wow. planning error state federal level? could happen true relaying reserve second doses?? made appointments husband, 65 year old diabetic mother site Suffolk County, Long Island. received email last night basically saying site wasn’t meant shared therefore appointment invalid. Basically, NYS doesn’t shit together vaccine distribution. absolutely spot everything said.  perhaps reason upset individual taxing healthcare system smoking first place.

But morality place vaccination prioritization plan saving lives sole objective. vaccinated morality, could hold people committed felony (even serving sentence) end line.

Doesn't mean can't feel cheated non-smokers. I've strict anyone, hospitals overrun new infections drops drastically, masks gonna gone, part. Sure, I'll still wear one many situations, especially winter, cause seems like great idea keep getting sick. people data death hospitalization rates dropped dramatically. That's way is. 

Also, getting info virus mutation rates? One reasons vaccines works virus mutates much slower dramatically than, say, flu.  issue always happens air gets filtered though. someone's sitting next coughing whole flight air filtering help much masks much, especially people misuse allowed take drinking eating. also data first SARS outbreak showed almost everyone immediate vicinity infected patient caught it, know controversial covid. 

Some flights space people lot, all. people using enclosed spaces like bathrooms potentially crowding boarding alighting.

The thing consider number flights recently halved due concerns new variants getting community (touch wood, seem done yet). lot people oversees trying come home demand well out-pacing supply. think sick not, people best get back however can.

It’s obvious many states hospitals holding second doses reserve themselves. can’t federal government states it, made sense feds stop it. lack trust states feds well warranted, turned right. slowed down. People still gonna go ignore read linked article overwhelming majority COVID patients, even asymptomatic, damage lungs?

My SIL surgeon, tell people COVID looking lungs. Asymptomatic people came unrelated elective surgeries finding COVID way.

To me, that's really scary. know long-term.  tried opt iPhone said state doesn’t support shit stood holding SMART phone, dumbstruck fucking stupid government enablers are.  is? early February, AstraZeneca vaccine fill gap first half February. Besides, total number doses delivered end March same. **I see many people US blaming non-mask people spread virus.** constant argument, everybody would worn mask virus hit, second wave. somehow virus could stopped, etc.

Let tell you. lot European countries good compliance mask-wearing social distancing. **They stop spread virus measures.** measures failed. Europe turned lockdowns slow spread. lockdown, virus starts spread again. country, 95% people wear masks. fallacy assume 5% virus spreaders solely responsible spread. Firstly, everyone wore mask properly, would 5-20% effect. **Most people lazy wear regarding standards medical worker.** effect even lower 20%. People obsessed masks. might help, yes. only, worn like doctor. Otherwise, person asymptomatic, cause harm good. People gone medical school really understand, wear masks properly. become accessory, design clothing. accept it, countries can't isolated like New-Zealand. virus spreads, matter what. measures help. Sure. non-mask wearers contribute spread. Yes. significantly stated here.

There forms non-compliant people. Parties, etc. lot parties masks, lot protests masks. still pose risk spreading virus. mask magical cloth stops spread. least effective IMO. Social distancing. **Good social security paid sick live, good hygiene way efective IMO.** Bruh, I’m working contact tracer right said “I airplane” would asking flight number, airline, seat row numbers, etc. that’s incompetence. sure big deal is. think states expanded groups vaccination based assumption going get big bonus delivery doses. Looks like might get bonus delivery still get supply they've getting. reportedly 8-12 million per week translates 1.1 1.7 million per day really sound bad. distribute give many per week around 35-45 million per month really bad. canada bisnesses forced shut arent given nessary finances, sick worent getting paid left fend groceries

We’ll see. cool story Full text: 

Pfizer expects lower coronavirus vaccine deliveries stretch beginning late January order lift output later winter throughout 2021, drugmaker said Friday.

The pharmaceutical giant aims boost overall production levels Covid-19 vaccine two billion doses 2021, necessitating regulatory approvals manufacturing processes.

""There may fluctuations orders shipping schedules Puurs (Belgium) facility immediate future quickly enable increased production volumes,"" company said.

The US market, supplied Pfizer's Kalamazoo, Michigan manufacturing site, affected fluctuation deliveries, company spokesperson said.

""Although temporarily impact shipments late January early February, provide significant increase doses available patients late February March,"" company said.

Six EU health ministers signed letter European Commission Friday express ""severe concern"" delivery delays coronavirus vaccine developed BioNTech Pfizer.

EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said Pfizer's CEO guaranteed delivery doses coronavirus ordered bloc first quarter 2021. Yeah like global society may want leave see family countries terminal illnesses something. People going restrict vaccination, blame them. one going live like recluse multiple years, especially they've administered vaccine. Regardless, fucked. Poor baby! might surprised. work unless know whether people hook machine actually exposed virus.

There's two related questions here: 1) vaccine 95% effective preventing disease, 95% prevented cases end asymptomatic carriers? 2) vaccinated people become infected (asymptomatic symptomatic), harbor transmit virus similarly without vaccine?

Since clinical trials tested people symptoms, can't know asymptomatics. frustrating design flaw study they're follow-ups figure out. I'm treating addiction something never start first place. get literal special treatment life saving vaccines decided make poor decisions life. ""COVID-19 exposure flights common think.""

So, like 100% chance getting exposed? already think incredibly common.  whole thing degraded everyone ever took AP Biology high school feeling like celebrity now, professionals sports stars think are, forever calling second round playoffs really sure Sweden 21th place whole world  


Considering never full lock down, good result. wanted vaccine fast possible Pfizer, moderns, others collected data showed symptoms. test everyone study duration order increase speed study.

So know ~95% people show symptoms second dose. could also immune infected covid infected meaningful way show illness. 

The issue people still infected it’s possible could still transmit, even though well protected illness. asparagus Beer (Duwel) vaccines. article explain, can't elaborate varies type smart watch. one alarm sustained high heart rate resting, turn on. Also look HRV stress levels heart rate look higher normal.   Never addicted anything? Eat fast food? Eat sugar?

Irrelevant. went approach wouldn’t eligible now.

I’m essential worker good news, wish country higher infection rate we'd done sooner. No, mean spirited stupid. would seem many personality type around.  Exactly. Well I’m eligible go pharmacy: that’s restricted 65+

And hasn’t government site listed area recently, site crashed can’t get appointment.

At least think that’s what’s going on. site listed says appointments available can’t get in. Either website it’s incorrectly listed. surely must realize 100% compliance lofty goal. Im masks plan requires 100% compliance bad plan.

Whenever light end tunnel always restrictions state residency restrictions type E cycle general population protect others. Reddit media sites help ignoring people breaking covid safety attacking Karens certain grouo buttheads distancing wearing masks. fact walks life forsaken country plain care distancing. Especially poorer inner city areas. PRC test lower incident false positives comparison rapid test, still false positives. They’re safe she’s symptoms. rate Pfizer Moderna vaccines actually getting distributed J&amp;J may far behind would expect hope. don’t numbers. told likely single cause wouldn’t surprised. also would surprised told likely one dozen possibilities. possibilities don’t problem exacerbating pandemic. CDC going recommend ignore possibility COVID could end indirectly killing people.

Another thing comes play is, common COVID area, anywhere you’ve recently? incidence low maybe confidence isn’t COVID. it’s high possibility COVID higher. CDCs advice necessarily general, specific area situation. see end less million deaths over. agree optimism, calling someone ""Karen"" wanting social distance around Summer 2021 *heavily* dependent effective widespread vaccines actually are.

I'd say safer bet think Fall 2021 time us able party up, go big events indoors/outdoors etc. without worrying getting anybody else sick. Fellow Virginian here! really wish could see doses sitting VDH website. maddening see low administration rate low % population protected urban centers state.  yeah going buy pair boots money...like really need check lol Stop bashing Sweden. true, worse Nordic countries. hand, Sweden top European leader board covid deaths first wave hit - Sweden 5th place Europe covid deaths, Sweden dropped 12th place.  So, work nursing home, vaccine free attempt run insurance covering cost. also entered everyone got vaccine raffle win TV many nurses stupidly skeptical it. Entirely predictable. gone 80+ till appointments stopped filling rapidly 75+ till stop filling rapidly forth. racing get vaccines peoples arms shouldnt luck race get appointment. Health Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced week federal government would begin releasing coronavirus vaccine doses held reserve second shots, reserve existed, according state federal officials briefed distribution plans. Trump administration already begun shipping available beginning end December, taking second doses directly manufacturing health officials across country anticipated extremely limited vaccine supply much doubling beginning next week confronting reality allocations immediately increase, dashing hopes dramatically expanding eligibility millions elderly people high-risk medical conditions. Health officials cities states informed recent days reality situation, others still dark. put us defect? Pfizer say they'll stop shipping vaccines use based specifications? comment reads like Trump tweet. effects second dose usually smaller. Primary equal only.  state initial comment. said people obese care health that's it. probably clarify thoughts next time unless goal insensitive eating disorders. right I'm pointing you. think they'd look NYC field hospitals morgue trucks learned thing but... guess not. trials, namely AZ/Oxford, deliberately included people previous infections trials. Yes. Three outcomes: vaccine herd immunity, eradication (within country least, keep out) failure. vocal minority joke. found remarkably strong support across board increasingly strong measures,"" Lazer says.

It's important ever see light end tunnel. Masks especially nothing harm economy adopted everyone now. [Going 80% 100% could save something like 50K literally guarantee vaccine remain 50% effective long-term, medium-term, without second dose. Pfizer explicitly stated local government (Quebec), made aware planning delay 2nd dose 60-90 days. fact, reports said Pfizer threatened give us 2nd shipment told.

Our first long term care home residents vaccinated 1st dose bad covid outbreak week... kinda does. brain fully developed mid-20's; young people impulsive rebellious. takes one experience form addiction, whether curiosity, defiance, appearances, etc. ""existential"" threats like, X years may (or may not), get disease like cancer behavior, really easy compartmentalize procrastinate indefinately early habit makes feel good.

“Ok. Enjoy flight!

Sometimes 0. think ever high 30 last 4-5 months. guys heard birthday paradox right? change little bit imagine finding COVID positive person instead odds really high every time. 


Does article talk transmission? I'm wondering much airlines spreading. believe air cycled exchanged pretty fast flight. make less risky environment? Bloomberg doses used nationally. Things improving. That’s frustrating. can’t believe states like West Virginia North Dakota literally leading world vaccination others like California, New Jersey even countries like Canada Germany absolutely terrible right now. Partnering local pharmacies also would help tremendously that’s WV ND doing. Flatten curve never strategy. PR campaign designed explain public containment failed. 

And goal never everyone get virus. goal lockdown long enough get cases low enough could manage testing tracing. Obviously never happened. Ironically, anti-lockdown push last spring caused failure guaranteed us series winter lockdowns. Sure displayed proudly major city think difference pretty important.

The general population wont put shit here. guess there. downvoted? Planes recycle 50% cabin air *most* modern planes. don’t know confirms planes it’s recycled air.

Most HEPA filters even aren’t 100%. COVID doesnt exist conservative areas right ?

What even point lol Yeah I’ve refreshing constantly since Monday finally paid off. It’s exhausting though. let’s hope doesn’t get cancelled. 😳😳 Might problem. Turns out, ""reserve"" release fly lot due unfortunate circumstances similar me. 

I made sure eat drink quickly immediately boarding isolated part airport. would put surgical mask board plane, taking care touch eyes. landing, I’d go wash hands. 

As tests became available, started getting tested college flying isolating much possible return. 

To knowledge, never got COVID. likely think airplanes filthy covid. care specific, get warning, get test.  Setting miscommunication/lie/whatever want call aside, people die vaccines distributed states none federal reserve. isn’t like somebody miscalculated order fewer doses otherwise would been, given two manufacturers worldwide demand.

I wish ramp plans Pfizer Moderna actually made public could make intelligent assessments regarding state planning vaccine rollout, long remains black box, guess. additional note: new form found Australia. one woman public, infectious several days. people got person lived with, including people hotel quarantine system already ones probably gave cleaner there.

It’s definitely infectious sure, we’ve shown controlled, “70%” infectious sounds scary, it’s actually bringing chances 10% transfer 15% so.

A new, possibly ""more transmissible"" variant COVID-19 specific United States, believed behind half country's coronavirus cases, reported Illinois researchers.

In study currently awaiting peer review, team led Southern Illinois University Carbondale researcher Keith Gagnon reported new variant ""specific dominant United States,"" would mark latest mutation discovery following reported United Kingdom South Africa. discovery submitted Monday BioRxiv, preprint server aimed disseminating research undergoes peer review.

“It’s here. found it,” Gagnon said statement. “It’s definitely home-grown widespread, we’re first characterize Yes. bugs little.

Stayed home work week seemed like symptoms , 2 negative tests it’s turns it’s head cold. beware regular common cold still *Scientist comes running lab main characters movie are* 
“We’ve cracked code! get people take reasonable precautions months vaccines roll out!”

Main character: “So we’re f—ked.” People delusional whole year. claim working vaccines, elderly already vaccinated, people still feel like going drag another year two. No! going end. Soon hospitalizations deaths going drop. People actively trying kill get vaccine first.. I'm sorry mean argument specifically. meant whole idea stratifying groups like type 1 vs 2 even necessary.  They're high risk vaccinated yesterday already. don’t deny China contained better now.

But doesn’t change fact frequent vaccine scandals China. culture lead still there.

Be honest: Would take Sinopharm vaccine one Biontech? That’s got well. recently heard friend friend got first shot positive really high fever. They’re blaming vaccine saying gave can’t help assume probably went shit right got first shot. Aaaaahhh YES

1/8?

So 24,000,000 confirmed cases we've seen US 12.5% true number cases?

That would mean 192,000,000 Americans 58.5% total population US already Covid went unnoticed we're ""only"" 37,740,000 cases away getting magic 70% that's needed herd Immunity...

If recording roughly 230,000 new cases day- past weeks- 230k 12.5% *real* number, we're ""really"" 1,840,000 new cases day, means 21 days away reaching herd immunity rejoice!

Also model abstract touch deaths underreported well, we've known last year numbers excess deaths we've seen since late last February nationwide. We're going know real number cases real number deaths time. know, I've commenting on, number confirmed resolved cases ***clinical outcome***\*- means either recovery, death.\* US nationwide, 97% resolved cases recovered - say die, say left lingering permanent damage disease, even noticed yet we've met Covid-19 little year ago- 3% died.

We also know mortality rates go age comorbidity...

We also know 1/3rd population US 50 years old higher risk alone.

We also know 60% Americans comorbidities obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, COPD, conditions put higher risk.

I'm denying report overly optimistic biased favor flying. point flying insane dangerous we'd see huge numbers infection way beyond could hidden article like that.

Exactly. Here's happened 2 people know COVID:

 * Person 1 - Got infected, sleeping bed wife testing positive (with symptoms). Nobody else house ever tested positive.

 * Person 2 - One infected person went dinner party 6 people. 6 people became infected. Fantastic! Thanks. BioNTech developed it, Pfizer produces it. point it’s Pfizer making decisions. remember couple months actually said hard contract COVID flight. extremely suspicious guess proves it.  Right, I’d forgotten - feds fail stockpile 2nd doses, told states states didn’t themselves. we’ve probably got people who’ve received 1st doses can’t get 2nd dose prescribed time. people realize, change dying traffic accident low. fear way fear covid. paranoia killing somebody driving traffic phobia change low. irrational fear people easily agree that.

For majority, dying covid low risk. young adults children, dying traffic accident even likely. yes, people overestimate risk dying covid extreme margin. data tracking people flight covid positive person getting covid higher rate population large?


That seems rather important bit info that's missing. won’t argue planes incredible filtration systems, concern always air get filters first. sitting near someone coughs, unfiltered particles going flying face (if second) hitting filters. planes built same, air moving back front, even inlets along aircraft, fair amount people’s breath pass passengers (exposure would depend sit relation inlets).

One thing know covid it’s ability caught severity symptoms linked cumulative exposure. exposed concentrated amount short time, could similar risk exposed small amount long time. 

So full plane risk fairly high even filters, depending several factors. Sure wearing masks limits risk, cumulative effect could still enough get sick. honestly think national stereotype efficiency pretty inaccurate.

Huge strawman imma end here, especially bc I’ve around science whole life going make profession it, yeah pandemic realistically mostly done summer USA. live world reality facts. don’t spread misinformation, fact spread truth. spread misinformation I’d banned already. hand...

Not replying further. Take ez thing Gu data modeling guy. He's virologist epidemiologist even doctor. He's smart person, expert subject. studies didn’t say ~80% protection reinfection symptomatic infection, study done vaccines. 

There increasing evidence might indicate people’s quickly waning antibody counts covid allow reinfection. rarely goes cause disease/illness, however. 

The unknown still weather still transmit, entire point. one knows concretely close data humans trials doesn’t exist. provide immunity like Pfizer's Moderna's reduce chances serious complications hospitalizations. almost say like prophylactic.

China desperately trying blame foreign countries local cases. CCP concludes current local patients first infected foreign meat/plane/traveler. blame ice cream materials imported. happened, told estimate weeks advance time came true number less estimate. 

Some states took estimate hard fact actually estimate. managed keep countries without blocking international travel.

So, appreciate taking time elaborate, conclusion reach still risk flying pandemic. 

Faith filtration system withstanding, I'll still take side caution stay clear travelers pandemic. hospitals need stop getting doses. even *report* waste, impact bottom lines. Retail pharmacies need distributing efficiently possible. understand point, referring fact good vaccination program, ""by passed"" others countries paying 100% doses. good them. slight grump, ""UK Coronavirus Variant"" and, unless orange soon unemployed, generally considered best avoid geographical names diseases nearly always wrong.

FYI, first detected UK sequencing virus countries simply detected first. reason.

(That said, UK press talking ""Brazil Variant"", seems fuckwittery knows international borders) Good point people tried. think need pay attention. example, back days China new corona virus, said problem all. nevertheless possible virus spread air (there conclusive evidence): Allow flights China land everywhere...  That's pretty self-righteous organization literally helped cartels launder drug money. Good, frankly whole situation angers me. known logistical requirements vaccines months somehow federal state governments got caught pants down. should’ve cranking freezers, setting distribution getting squared away ages ago. Like WW2 shipbuilding levels output. problem is, states preparing increase available doses told reserve. administration lying reserve dumb, everyone preparing doses. Lets say right lot recorded covid deaths covid deaths. point start care make sacrifices life protect lives people vulnerable? Lets say half numbers fake? Would care nearly 200k dead? actually lived book claim live would, I'm sure christian make feel superior. level selfishness pathetic.

Vaccines tweaked lot they've actually made. It'll put us back many squares square one. they've already COVID would continue wear masks? They've built natural immunity literally impossible spread it. Ultron Still, that's 1/6 total Canadian population

I today years old learned population California greater population Canada. circumstances lockdown constitution allow it. doubt. Joe Biden isn’t one pass buck could legitimately say: “the US stockpiles empty came in!” article actually YESTERDAYS reporting added 351 deaths (not deaths single day!) since previous report. daily deaths number though (that one 118 record pandemic far) article posted today, beyond me. True, everyone looking see goes. expectation February death numbers low. sure infection rate drop soon though, since doubt 85+ year olds super-spreaders. Exposure thing spread. Airplanes intense air cycling filtering around. CDC said much fewer cases traced flights might otherwise expected due air filtering occurs.

Of course people knowingly unknowingly traveling COVID. important question. important question - spreading others plane? answer seems no. Good luck. And, thanks anecdote.  Thanks.

Honestly - bad get headspace ""I'm going safe can, I'm one trust"".

I recall whenever US willing ""pay whatever"" everyone arms US jumping line thus depriving poorer countries vaccine. think apathy+exponential growth explains it.

Yup, sure does. you’re posting Reddit third-hand terms “my brother’s boss” actively going real avenues exist report this, don’t believe you. one hour wish could trade brains one simple fools reads shit-posts/comments thinks “damn poor guy”. Like get extent wanting believe people’s good intentions, it’s obvious someone looking go top page. Lol Reddit agenda pushers stfu think masks going around awhile, overall cases way control. Even though individuals start vaccinated, stores can't prove (because know anti-maskers would faking sort ID card) probably keep required all. least things open people meet friends/family.  Honestly? I’m like borderline obsessively paranoid virus. think I’m gonna wear mask inside eat/sleep/etc partner next 6-9 months... bet.  Yooo Oregon killing Thank you.

Also, test positive live close quarters family?

&amp;#x200B;

If test positive (obviously would quarantine), get tested (for statistics???) case happening

this _known_ case happening 740 million inhabitants instead 330...  I'd guess aerosol exposure would accumulate infection risk steady pace, large droplets random events.

Five minutes could rule, decent emission tracing data based on?
Trillions wasted public measures built guesswork. Many studies demonstrated tools measure transmission exactly available. one applying scale, endless stream n=83 studies conflicting results. Why? exact goals tracking? concerned hitting goals nationally, local city state level? That's awesome. Good you. done past year without partner well. social situation same! care much much respect someone call friend see many people part problem (whichever problem may hand - there's lot those...) even want try better human learn how. I'd rather lonely consider friends hate hearts quite literally care themselves. can't fathom people much energy expend miserable. Tell people died plateauing due reduction cases/increase vaccines, we're space? happen way. waitlist organized text messaged

""Hello XXX. vaccine available. must available present XXX 3pm. wish receive vaccine please follow attached link. required pay $300 deposit via credit card. present lose deposit. Please ensure come wearing mask. "" feel also noticed, atleast *feels* lot time like people go fo way get space. Like say going walk huge, empty park/field, large , empty area, people still gravitate towards god damn space. huge, open space
 world people walk directly towards child magnetic pull. pisses much. depends ask. Reinfections thing immunized folks may able still spread disease. implication two things combined disastrous. So, nothing. 

People forget viruses need you. leave 5 viral particles counter top come back 12 hours later still 5 particles. like microorganism sustain nutrients. thing literally starved ways tuberculosis example can't. 

A strong public health approach could work. yet are. 

More people finding they've known someone it. shame let get that. same. line get mine Feb state, calling doc soon going handle it. going wearing mask anywhere inside going forward. still can't read properly? would thought. /s much people sampled, article say

It say article reporting anecdotal statement 1 doctor. scientific method. people know sick Jan/Feb anyone else bubble entire year. 2 friends 2 extended family members gotten sick confirmed COVID, handful exposures. become part life. done right, restrictions would mostly ended pandemic. 

Sure would minor outbreaks localized lockdowns. gotten first lockdown right followed robust enough system testing contact tracing would mostly back normal since last summer. Well probably gonna wait least like 4 months anyway makes feel better here, go go food shopping. Even that's every two weeks 7 weekday. list get fast possible. 

I see articles packed bars realize may still get many people care. hit bus go ett begränsat antal fall kan det vara känt av Smittskyddsenheten att dödsorsaken inte varit relaterat till covid-19 och då kan dödsfallet vissa fall tas bort ur statistiken. 

I'd call incompetence. yet, attempting argue study literally backs everything said within 1% margin difference. absolutely incredible. get it. fell lockdownskeptic crowd trouble rationally analyzing data instead making juvenile mistakes understanding disease dynamics. push agenda hard proven wrong again. 

And admission, main research focuses cancer immunology know ""fuck all"" COVID. I've got 30+ years post-postdoc experience infectious disease research team literally hired one major vaccine manufacturers conduct modeling reinfection rates COVID experience. make juvenile mistakes research analyses like much less trained individual that's trying argue subject. 

Also, claiming PhD don't...shameful.  Aww little face mask bothers much? Grow fuck dude OP referencing LA County. comment referencing LA County. You’re probably right you’re talking LA County  best way get vitamin naturally sun. However, live 37th parallel (37 degrees latitude), anywhere north Los Angeles, really can’t get much vitamin November March sun low sky

A) vaccines require two doses

B) one dose Pfizer Moderna vaccine gives 50% efficancy - HUGE tamping thing down. even people miss second shot we've still greatly reduced spread. Yes it’s much less unlikely you’re masked. don’t know point is? places open all? understand know talking about, best show complete ignorance, makes look silly. forget ultra conservative boomer business owners think covid hoax think ""if can't see working"" Love spirit dude! Fingers crossed! Lol, gtfo then. congrafs wasting time telling us stuff know us disagree with. fun sad lil troll. I'm saying fear life ignoring may worst attempt ""fearing"".

We're winter, covid advantage. 
There three contagious variants. 50% contagious, factor applied R0 linear factor, ""will lead 50% infections timespan"". Infections grow exponentially, may literally see 5x–10x linear transmission rate variant *only* 50% contagious. 

Looking devastating UK, there, possibly USA similar kind problem, easily see takes months infect everybody let virus to. I'm trying make people understand. like live side side virus around; Rt extremely difficult keep around 1, possibly impossible without restrictions, herd immunity. like, either actively restrain virus mass vaccinations, everybody gets it. get pandemic fatigue real, want get this, introverts suffering too; can't let less rational risk calculators right Abbott piece shit though 

Everything wide open Texas packed brim Time get get sail boat live past surf dude. Steal to---- rules apply anymore anyways, right? Trump's first big tax cut cost trillion dollars? Reverse cover good chunk it. also get covid without going building.  people look working class folks can't work remotely Reddit day. would rather talk essential workers instead hold government corporations accountable providing reasonable sick/COVID leave policies. everyone already, would flattened curve would much much worse.   anyone that's informed everyday various source reddit news pretty obvious, large parcel population isn't, all. heb don’t think so. seems mainly dependent presidents legacy possible connection Navy. example, George HW Bush Gerald Ford aircraft carriers named since served carriers. Lincoln, Washington, Theodore Roosevelt also carriers named probably since they’re regarded best presidents. 

There also IMHO stupid decisions name carriers career politicians. example USS John C Stennis named segregationist senator never served Navy. lobby Navy maybe it’s possible buy name onto carrier?

At moment, Trump extremely controversial president can’t see abating least ten years. Also, don’t think there’s monumental Trump achievement outshine conduct office comes legacy. Another bloated pork filled corporate payout buddies. like republicans last two “stimulus” bills got moderna vaccine today :D Though headline makes feel less assured getting haha Precisely same. person handed puppy likely it. could easily coughed hand, pet dog, masked met you. could easily get pet’s fur. They've prevented asthma attacks usually get winter cold+dry air. I'm really appreciating that! disagree premise powerless face disease. - agree people feel way though. 

I can't prove would like think COVID painted enemy USA people power spoke Steps take Kill, Disrupt, ultimately Eradicate ENEMY vitirol political parties threat nation national interests around world; American public would seen enemy combatant could turned patriotic enthusiasm towards something demanded lockstep approach.  

That would required specific targeting disease though. came from. came be. brought here. Treating Covid like little spies hitler running around US kill soap, hand sanitizer, alcohol, Clorox wipes, etc. could disrupt information gathering wearing masks gathering big groups could easily hide amongst us spread. Finally obtaining vaccine allows us strike heart enemy meaning destroy all. Maybe would way better approach.  super vaccinating sites opening California, I'm getting vaccinated tomorrow morning role play organization falls first group. center I'm going set handle 11k 12k day several others like across county LA county running. Fully operational looks like going able least 20k+ big centers mention smaller ones. make one heck diference. Oh I'm definitely tuning well - working basement almost year, wearing mask, going anywhere necessary. Tuning like that.  First World. refreshing hear speak today. much better Trump train wrecks become accustomed to. great leader again. reports everywhere vaccines sitting around, used states well goals vaccination rates.

Which frustrating, I'm sitting waiting turn get vaccinated, state tells may wait MAYBE March!  wished handled lockdowns restrictions better point I'll take win Yeah we'll see well one goes... *hopefully* goes through, though.

Would great I'd able find TF actually get *last* $600, though. 23 million cases today... so, 2 million every week  Reserve requirement, reverse. think might referring reservation half allotment use second doses. Honestly, I'm sure whole ""keep half reserve"" vs. ""use now"" thing. 1 3? One fucking THREE?! probably hold second dose come back vaccine card  kinda important. long time thing could get without go building. Also N isn’t like others 8=====D~~ Fuck. 3,900 deaths yesterday Well employees state reporting employers.  job willing die USMC.  Fuck Corp america treating people like pigs. Haha. know, know, absolutely agree. I'm intentionally ignorant lolz :-) Put mask. Specially live California. mean death per capita %age confirmed cases died? former, UK 9th death capita, US 11th (and accelerating still), Germany is... 45th.

And talking deaths/cases ratio, that's dependent virus live, variable ability detect mild cases. remember seeing chatter throughout social media feeds. got access portals meant healthcare workers. much honor system. widely available NJ since wide range pre-existing conditions eligible, guess it'll easier get vaccine. Isn’t everyone kind already? else would right now? downvoted earlier comment said correct flu vaccine.

However, runway making new seasonal flu shot around half year. decide Feb strains going vaccine distributed Aug. That's need adapt human flu strains grow eggs genetically combining strain grows well eggs, selecting ones grow well produce desired human strain antigens. scale virus growth, test amount antigen produced, combine 3-4 strains together.

For mRNA vaccines like Moderna, wanted to, take genetic sequence variant sequenced today, create first pilot batch new vaccine days. problem that’s exactly months.  exactly volunteering help ""figure out"", you? mean, concerned, make phone calls offer help way instead bitching internet.  Sure cuz dead anxiety anymore. Well, thank info. good know, also probably good many others read. Good input. Thanks! better plan take Cycle threshold patients PCR test lower 30 start people mask+ treatment disease away view weeks! I’m going make drink another 1/5...

I don’t care much COVID anymore. started looking data shows close 99% recovery population I’m fretting it. 

The average victim age average life expectancy. means many people going pass. 

The average comorbidity count 2.5 means bunch stuff mainly obesity, diabetes, heart disease usually related America’s unhealthy lifestyles. 

I understand outliers show something people died ODs COVID San Francisco aren’t shutting city them.

More people die second order effects; businesses shutting down, bankruptcies, suicides, DV, loss schooling, yes let’s keep America shut places isn’t showing works.


Note: 2018 flu season killed 80K people nobody blinked. Yes flu contagious also... Anyone North Jersey hiring? 👋 Phase 2 vaccine here.. gonna while! Yeah. No. Lots excuses.

We've gotten little feedback situation good, need covid news junkie dashboard fanatic realize it. people aren't, situation bad, always bad, anything? explanation pretty straightforward - media focusing attack capitol, twitter ban discussion around corporate control speech, impeachment, anticipated violence inauguration. They'll go back covid soon enough. said anything wearing mask. Support small businesses safe possible. factors pandemic get ignored like economy mental health.  lmao still going wear it? isn’t political. It’s virus. Anyone claiming like you, contributing problem making political issue. 

Nobody’s getting anywhere way. Stop part problem. live windsor, month ago, know anyone. probably dozen recently. local work associates Michigan Ohio. 4 relatives Italy, 4 house it. father ventilator 15 days. cousin said friends either it. says, people belligerent USA fed care rules anymore. soon get symptoms, could go now. understanding PCR-test accurate 5 days infection. already symptoms I'd suggest get tested right away. effect many public labs place part publicly funded NHS, US many labs, private perform screening regularly since there's money it. Another check nationalized medicine improved public health outcomes. maybe close start Olympics are? Oh goodness yes. honestly people who've died covid look nightmarish bruising caused constant ventilators, masks, oxygen cannulas.  Yeah buddy, year crap I’ll force feed cows bean burritos trade hybrid hummer meant get life back. 

I know you’re trying say - read room., told could take option a) set climate action back 10 years get life back b) advance climate action 20 years live like another 1? take option a. 

By way, I’m relatively environmentally conscious individual. It’s big part work. I’m saying lightly .... updoots. difference British people like calling ‘British mutation/virus’ animus current government. cant fight tidal wave lazy journalism self-loathing. Yup. Maybe care. Maybe they're tired bullshit willing take 1 percent chance dying. Gotta wonder democracy eh? Many polls showing lockdowns etc for. Typically would mean anti lockdown group would start seeing favourable results. know Africa handled well. median age someone Africa 19. 100 MILLION JULY?? That's insane. People definitely able pick vaccine certain point IMO. way ever even vaccinate 300m people Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J anyway  shelter worker works dogs, freaks bit. adoptions outside long weather ok. try keep distance form co workers volunteers much possible touching animals, hopefully hand washing helps. Ok that’s wondering, sorry sorta dick :P Swabs taken known high concentration virus. mean tissues infected well.  amazing so, helpful. already saved read 'rainy day' - kidding lol mean 6 hours so, rinse repeat. thank much! i've taking better care mental health recently, made big difference, taking better care physically think keep getting tripped up. easy take comfort bad habits days, i'm sure find discipline break cycle get rid feels like remaining little 'creature comforts', ha. 

i definitely agree crisis/sustained crisis/several crises year long helped large number people realize actually important pay attention going around you, who's (if makes sense). words, catalyst 'radicalized' whole lot people, i'm grateful that. really wish happen way, though. i've always arguably cared much everything, always lectured 'calm down', 'stop dramatic' etc. etc. - turns though 'i told so' satisfying ALL! sucks! guess nice company taking shit seriously/paying attention crew days, despite came pass. idk making sense, stream consciousness right now. anyways, thanks again, really appreciate advice! Right? One grandmothers still convinced children can’t give COVID. I’ve seeing parents sister since March. even fiancé, he’s stuck NZ since immigration wasn’t far enough. It’s awful autoimmune disease virus, don’t want see COVID would do. What’s surprising California infections low number hospital beds staff per capita. It’s one lowest US. Vaccinations increasing. J&amp;J releasing data next week could see approval early February that's one dose vaccine speed vaccinations even furhter since need call person twice. Things going get worse gets better there's light end tunnel. Ontario. Asymptomatic people get tested had/suspected exposure need test results surgery travel. summer unrestricted, many people started get tested go gathering, purpose test dangerous pre-symptomatic transmission perspective that's false negative rates highest.

But practice almost anything symptom wanted get test can. Two open right now. 3rd (Lone Tree) opened yet. supposed ""early 2021"". one Aurora one Colorado Springs. 

Basically almost every employee gotten it. zero deaths. way...the Gravy Seals would riot right it. I’m glad got vaccine, must taken load off. COVID situation unlike anything you’ve ever seen job? n good, it’s good think depends percentage population virus. It’s still fairly low. example, 65% recovered Covid already, might behoove us administer antibody tests find needed vaccine. 1 jab. Game changer. Pulling numbers ass: 2-4 weeks see effect (platueu), 4-6 weeks see significant effect (deaths going down). healthcare workers NJ coming NYC get shots. They're not. $25 stipend vaccine verification. Insane! feel you, distressing , never get away B.C . region coast pop 20000 none, cases. Good luck! BTW you? Oh man you’re giving much credit. happy they’re using everything throwing trash. Vitamin seems good, believe works taking longer time. hurt start supplementing now. Apart that, eat healthy, get good amount sleep sit out. Yes. things measures lower chance, still possible. original posting stating never went except one time following precautions got it. seem likely commenting. much likely family/roomates got brought home, much common way getting covid. Flu viruses less error checking COVID does, influenza recombine. differences make really likely mutate, flu viruses 60% effective.

Even mutant strains possibility immune system ""forgets"" COVID, going anywhere near bad ever again. least, people enough immunity protect death/hospitalization. novel strain emerges, we'll mRNA vaccine supply chain place. don’t need news “focus us”. follow covid precautions without news pumping fear us. Good point. Let's this! literally leave house, I'm immunosuppressed. world become scary place people like me. real ""ideas"" guy you? remind dad he's beers, coming kinds solutions problems people paid work already thinking already years they're sober.

You want know good way fuck vaccination process already is? Start throwing people mentioned together training providing vaccinations figure go along. I'm sure get good results. hard make sense comments, seem saying anything ""Israel bad"". 

The way Israel considered apartheid, artificially expand definition apartheid include things nothing original definition term, would apply almost occupation. longer clear information conveyed using word ""apartheid"", since done redefine way divorces original meaning. xenophobes cheering. prevalent really, though? me. I'm fucking done. I've followed rules, I've avoided people, I've worn mask, I've stayed home... can't anymore. honestly struggling cope I'm point would rather fucking die another month. city emailed today basically say fuck off, getting vaccine LONG TIME. seen friends year. I've decided weekend go party up. care kills me. Death preferable point. really compare fucking rapist wearing mask **in home**???

Are fucking delusional??? yes lets question countries proven corrupt... crazy thing say post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* usually breaks friend circle ravages everyone associated. virus probably kill spreads super fast. also communities reporting usually shame disease.  IFR estimates right somewhere range, yeah. 1-2 million. Ten Hiroshimas.

I bet, gave people choice, dropping nuclear bombs 10 cities, people staying home month, they'd choose second one. US probably 5-6 months form normalcy

Thought meant Easter, last year? ignorance must bliss indeed Karen’s? think real distrust towards government big pharma, look track record, neither peoples best interest...ever. Pfizer approver 16 over. Moderna 18 over. Studies happening get data ages 12+ now, hopefully available fall.  focus on: COVID death democracy? Decisions... wonder anything German owned (Aldi Nord) in-laws central PA, touch primary health doctors couple times week talking neighbors friends possibilities local clinics pharmacies. right major population center big university something would call around. I'd literally make 4-5 calls per day local places get best info. No, banks legally obligated provide service anyone. customer trying break bank’s policy, that’s completely reasonable reason close account. agree counts. just.,, can’t. makes feel gross sad watch him. Partly every video left (an awkward, nerdy, anxious, possibly spectrum engineer loves legos, obscene shop organization, dabbles every single DIY discipline get tools for), Thinking repeatedly “damn. really hope “grow up” like (also living I’d call dream life, add spare classic car work can’t fathom blissful existence) honest excitement downright infectious just.., ugh :/, thinking gets down. Yes, get it, rest country locked either. where's source, good redditor?
It takes time study research new string virus code, people uneducated know. took month medical facilities outside China confirm it, assume patient zero admited diagnosed like that? nice question. 🙂 red everytime blue wave comes in. Broken records. hand back thriving economy take credit. see. want stop people going outside walk going encounter anyone. I’d could opt working person would. Damn that's kind disappointing Great rescue money irs doesn’t send right account  USA 1 1000 people already died it?

And 1 3 people infected - that's LA, let's say 1 5 whole country - means 1 200 people going end dead, ultimately. actually taxed filthy, greedy corporations begin with, know? 

*Looks historical mistakes* people might also offsetting cost terms lost hours work, cost travel, childcare, etc.  real, do. You’re right.  Breathing outside safe according studies research. Theoretically, air completely stagnant moving someone sneezed, maybe particles may hover space while. real world outdoor situation breeze everything virtually risk. gut fucked high doses antibiotics years ago. Oh well surpassed 2 million worldwide officially. I'm sure country's numbers accurate. Found today boss tested positive. said “meh it’s like flu cold”. estimate seems oddly high. 

With 975k cases, per worldometer population 10M, would mean 3x estimate confirmed cases.  ""Herd immunity"" = ""there nobody left infect""

Natural herd immunity *an outcome* pandemic, failure outcome. means everyone got virus. means control measures totally worthless killed million people (in USA). know people recommend anyway. doubt it’s mandated next two years sorry rest world, fucked one pretty bad.   lotta people drooling right thinking they're get pay raise actually downsized... Maybe thinking trials companies isolating six months ... I'm talking *total deaths*, I'm talking *deaths per capita*, since onset pandemic. US currently sits 1,200deaths/1m people, Germany's 542deaths/1m people, less half people.

That *current daily situation* bad US one thing, near comparable looking long-term data makes sense 5,000 44,000 exposed Corona virus. 

Not 44,000 exposed coronavirus obviously. Lots vitamins C D, people deficient vitamin especially time year. Low stress, exercise, plenty sleep, lots water, positive outlook, something every day something look forward to. sense purpose reason get bed morning, schedule goals throughout day, something look forward almost every day every week. guess hit 410,378 point future

And could hit 452071 well, later Assuming Attack Rate Unvaccinated (ARU) = data showed 33% fall infection rates among already vaccinated compared hadn’t. 

 Attack Rate vaccinated (ARV) = 67

 Vaccine efficacy = (ARU - ARV) / ARU \* 100% = 33%

From [Safety Efficacy BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 cumulative incidence Covid-19 cases time among placebo vaccine recipients begins diverge 12 days first dose, 7 days estimated median viral incubation period 5 days, indicating early onset partially protective effect immunization. study designed assess efficacy single-dose regimen. Nevertheless, ***in interval first second doses, observed vaccine efficacy Covid-19 52%*** ....

The 33% efficacy rate seems bit low compared 52% observed clinical trial. everyone basically give day 1? even virus even there? caught ;) care think odd restaurants basically closed since last March? Ohhh it’s Governor... many racism biased comments ""Government force/surpress people's free will"" bullshit, guess That's stuff local Joe's hands best store around close. best staff. must pay well bc go extra mile even pandemic. best snacks too. Covid sniffing dogs would good this!  talking ass. Michigander, THANK GOD GOVERNOR. really many restrictions. one besides others know following 2 household protocol. high schools went distance learning (possibly middle school, think high school) restaurants bars shut down. People able work home supposed to, boss greedy SOB stay office. numbers fallen much two things. listening scientists important :) way. Unfortunately that's crazy level distrust vaccines is, trust way half crap prescribe  mean? Every temperature check I’ve seen people distanced one touches anyone. don’t know effective don’t think cause virus spread. That's probably Trader Joe's first grocery chain (as stated title), first store chain. Dollar General grocery chain, variety store chain. way.  admission 13 days ago, PhD...  Thanks! USA first-world developing country. 5 months. least 5 months. Hopkins, PHE senior medical adviser, said “strongly encouraged” finding infection gave powerful — though complete — protection reinfection least five months. Probably like common cold, even.

Look Russian flu. deadly pandemic 100 years ago, researchers suspect actually caused one modern-day common cold coronaviruses. wow ignorance must bliss. really worried catching try go out. Otherwise safe do. saying anything positive negative lockdowns. saying person needs determine much risk willing take. stay inside unless need get food choice. let die start new pass people way office, certainly. live LA County live Los Feliz, Laurel Canyon, Malibu, Palisades kinda related, stores town closed 11pm boy suck now. :( *loved* shopping late night. Hardly deal people. think people share sentiment known anyone directly hit Covid.

I think finally do, sentiment change. know still refuse. hey, lots people still drive drunk use date rape drugs. give fuck others. hmmm concerned think way oh well I'm cutting pasting article I'm sorry hear that. one deserves lose loved ones. friend respirator sister's family caught went Navy. husband almost ended ER. I'm Canada clamped better. feel bad Americans suffering due mismanagement entitled egotists. Ah bad, worked fine first time, I'm shut paywall too. Must 1 2 free articles month/week we're quota now. Germany definitely least one wave one. know say first wave. True. go way 0 waves. someone else infected would guess. way, it’s almost like hear kids starving Africa. Literally everyone know point, worst case moderate flu case basically. saying it’s horrible lot people, people go long see evidence contrary lives feel lucky one work place got Covid thus far. Hell boss us wearing masks right state closed, mandates. Best guy ever, truly cares keeping us safe still deemed essential. given shit covid months. people work hospitals grocery stores 3 4 generations one roof. Passaic county Government jails people speaking citizens speak them. news 11. person living equally vigilant? NJ leads commented many times, but: yet see curfew job reduced infections rather being, user said, killing nice part life without affecting part generates $$$. pointless speeds fatigue. Lmaooo don't. like peeing section swimming pool. Stupid, gross, dangerous.  majority people hospitals people risk. people dying it. Another point argument Bitcoins eh? America people infected anything. Well said, can't meet 2 people private, noone cares meet 200 work way work. like bucket two holes, sealing one effective. gives fuck *martial law*, law war, nothing Marshall. Goes every disease pretty much. Healthy diet exercise. y'all go work?  Love see follow studies confirm 95% efficacy vulnerable population.  Younger people likely get covid either symptoms less severe symptoms handled without hospitalization simply staying home couple weeks. older immunocompromised people get covid likely require hospitalization. want lower hospitalization rates vaccinate elderly sick first. making sense. Yeah long after. They've place multiple months now, maybe 5 ish, I'm sure fuck people live local pools *a section peeing*? way written really made seem like stayed home alone everyday yikes probably case I’d attribute culture mask wearing home? people live with? would that? read first: Wyoming come second!!!

After that, New Hampshire, guess. old person got full life prosperous, free, cushy time ever alive history world they’re forcing everyone nuke chance future live couple extra months. point need protect give younger people fighting chance living anything abject poverty rest lives. Feel same, news, impeachment, president allowed tweet, bla, bla. Like thing called pandemic??? know people CA, older 65, underlying health conditions, week contacted able get vaccine. earth would think hospitalizations peaked?

Probably they've basically static week? Someone knowledge commented another thread paper obvious methodology flaws Manaus fact nowhere near herd immunity then. Consider place world even close, can't orders magnitude ""ahead"" Bergamo, Belgium, New York, etc, plausible explanation mutations. We’re fucked.

Are you? means 33% people simply can't get it. think it’s combination inconsistent/illogical rules, politicians getting caught breaking rules, people basically left dry government, sheer duration whole thing. people said better, can’t care forever. Careful now, don’t want get 600000 1 would you? titles like even mean?  Ehhhhhhhhhhh idk honestly think coup attempt important/worthy attention. mean, would even deal COVID coup attempt successful? We’d serious shit. people socialize 6 problem. Thank you! follow suggestions Tell people become homeless lost business Steal? 

The West certainly free start donating, even selling, vaccine developing nations. Americans fighting French send vaccines Indonesia Turkey right now? LOL.

The Western developed countries laugh China's vaccine, China's PPE, Chinese ventilators, want. rest developing world, Chinese ones helping right now. Chinese go around giving lectures democracy freedom, make feel like charity case either. oh no, poor oppressed british people )`: Dan Carlin's ""The End Always Near"" fantastic chapter historic plagues pandemics. Basically, human history 1700s people dying 5 times rate Covid, myriad diseases, basically time. think part life back then, routine. makes sense people would revert fairly quickly. would need something installed entrance mass-detect whether people infected. sort covid detector. People detected positive would denied entry would get money back. would encourage people test prior event attend. We’re ready die Shoot. would pay $50 get today That's great start tell hwat! sounds like caption onions editorial cartoon lol Sorry loss. 
That’s crazy! hospital anything reports correlate diagnosis? Half family China, living lives normally. believe them, dude who's never China Reddit?

If think argument even iota teeth, Google ""China human rights white paper."" can't give less fuck West attack human rights, especially US government put kids cages forcibly sterilize migrant women. Exactly this. twenty bucks, get five comfortable masks major retailers reuse many times need long wash them. flip side, normal package paper masks crazy expensive months ago price gouging. curbside pick-up. become monumental shit show. spent damn day trying get appointment 100 year old grandparent isolation since fucking March luck longer get priority 20 something likes eat much pizza. hate 20 somethings, I’d hustling get didn’t already first dose, state handled poorly. Name one ""democratic"" country dealt COVID half well China country competitive “studying Chinese experience”

And right? China first country experience COVID pandemic, pretty much succeeded defeating two months. went anyone else did, anyone want learn experience wilfully ignorant stupid. figure cancer patient active chemo &amp; trial get it.

That question coordinator clinical trial. might get kicked trial. happens when. U desegregate education racists take ball go private.

1990 last year public schools full blown shop, music, home economics curriculum. 2000 public education fully gutted.

Schools segregated 1950s.

Civil rights win shit. racists assasinated Dr King, dismantled little detriment Americans.

We give biden 4yrs try malcomX's way.

We saw easy take capitol Cmon, let random redditor call employer educate wrong. What's worst could happen 🤣 r/LosAngeles nutshell Regardless that’s dumb claim make without data Bold assume peak destruction. They’re probably paying employees get vaccine need take time work get it, know that’s one localish business planning town Good. Time move let baby roll population 🤘🏿 helps reducing contacts, yes, lockdowns help. closing kinds ""non-vital"" stores, hotels, restaurants schools leaving open whole work sector, including communting, make sense. virus care meet people home, restaurant work. No, fall, guarantee people abide mask mandates people vax frankly stop mad anti-maskers point truly committed showed up. long still masks pushing anxiety, people find forms enjoyment. won’t large 20k crowds even bigger. Fuck place I’d leave signing that. Sure share I’ll read there’s info atm. I'm sure posted earlier, find research microbiomes. thought would post community, may relevant long haulers.  Turns every time I've like 'no way someone could big shitpiece', there's always piece shit willing rise challenge. Conservatives deny facts doesng suit reality problem can't protect vulnerable without social distancing. I'm high risk genuinely afraid virus, think sign humanity empathy. point, know 3 dozen people COVID. half dozen cases assymptomatic, couple dozen mild, half dozen required hospitalization 7 died. mild cases varied significantly, cases seemed brutal times. political decision allow businesses fail sign failing political system, people overreacting imaginary threat. I’m seeing lot KN95s LA. Yeah, advice give someone wanted minimize risks illness. Eat well, drink plenty water, exercise get lots sleep. I'm glad they're science vis vis corona, really evidence already suspect. Good you! That’s basically I’ve since February. You’re either going get you’re not. Chill fuck out, CYA, wake next day again. March April, googling ""COVID19"" every day. I'm googling, ""Is America Civil War yet?"" wear mask, distance, stay home one cares. work, also conveniently mentioned. I’ve worked covid unit since beginning somehow never got it. got terribly works me. got vaccine still haven’t gotten it. Plus never felt anything vaccine I’m perfectly fine. cramming everyone's activity fewer hours cause spike infection rates? Curfews actively counterproductive. True. That's crazy, though. 33% population gets it, that's lot future health problems coming up, info organ/lung/vascular damage accurate. statistical term ""a doozy""! India definitely gets pass government media turns blind eye atrocities. people individuals think important.

India massive crackdown religious minorities Operation Blue Star 1980s thousands unarmed civilians gunned tanks yet candlelight vigils media reminders every year.

India annexed NATO member state territory Goa Portugal, annexed sovereign state Sikkim, sponsored LTTE terrorists Sri Lanka balkanized US ally Pakistan, yet crickets. Free Sikkim movie stars. NATO even defend founding member Indian aggression, that's degree blind eye turned.

Did India get sanctions, entity listed even small chastising? Nope. India gets rewarded free military aid investment instead.

Then Modi's ""policies"" deserve whole section own. I'm wearing mask, keeping distance, wash8ng hands, patiently waiting turn vaccination. FUCK WANT!?!?!?! something concerned. doctors, tired this, wanting look families might start quitting. mean, people still act like give shit. would blame doctors so, either.

I'm surprised already. They've tasked taking care people shown respect 10 months now. fucked Ecuador back September. wonder bad here....but REAL BAD USA. rules stricter actual legal punishment wearing mask...but folks still get together homes beers et cetra. Maybe intense sunshine Vitamin D? I’d agree that. think model testing everybody sort event lip service. Take MLB season 10,000 people stands. Quick math 162 games 30 teams 25MM tests would need conducted baseball games. add concerts, theaters, like. mention sports seasons NBA, NHL, NFL playing time. sudden you’re running tens millions tests per day entertainment. would break.  need believe individual guy-who-knows-a-guy. 

I'm gullibly swallowing one account true, ***not*** impossible. part pass smell test ""had sign waiver"" they'd get fired. sort thing sleezebag employer tells staff, usually dumb enough write down.

However, said, I've party drafting NDA/non-competes CEO said point-blank unenforceable. Business owners intentionally drape bullshit legalese intimidate employees regular basis.

Your premise impossible issue me.

There plenty communities scarce job options, will-to-work states, reporting something like get fired. (Not day, 3 months now. they've built paper trail showing random work infractions. I've part admin staff employers building sort paper trail fire someone unrelated reason.)

If person's story true business reported. However, report something like this, need another job lined up. impossible line another job, game theory makes smartest keep head report it.

I mentioned wage theft one blatantly illegal, reportable offense happens day day across country. happens every single day. international headline news. Sometimes make news, assertion outrageous workers' rights violations make news? Wage theft #1 example news.

You're busy accusing people fishing reddit doots. That's silly. Even guy uninformed, cares? Sadly, impossible scenario. 

Your viewpoint makes sound naive people accusing naive. ability never smell taste in-laws cooking ever again. \*cases\* underreporting tend pretty mild. Think someone asymptomatically gets COVID never tests it. case serious, would probably taken COVID test gotten positive.

Underreporting deaths cause. Lol whatever man. Let's clear. rich care us. care die thousands. matters money safety. own. Protect protect family. one else will. headline good news.. Wait, rearrange eggs there's cracked one? Two hours pay? worth health safety It’s maddening. administer shots!!! hurts people they’re trying help first most. genuinely sorry experience. sounds really stressful deserve better experience. pandemic ruthless emotional states hope rewarded 10fold endure. Blessings you. Vaccines covered, hospitalizations not. quit job. Funny say that. remembering used shop QFC Cap Hill used drive nuts slow moved there. LA tourist destination I’m sure anyone knew was. righteous, almost point sarcasm. Used work TJs lot friends still. f*cked employees region day one COVID-19. stinks like PR ploy launder rep. Correct. knew endless hours meetings I've last month discuss proper charging vaccine. nauseating gonna lie. agree Trader Joe’s making bold step towards appreciating employees, think what’s best them. It’s easy compare Trader Joe’s competition others twiddling thumbs making money hand fist.
I’m happy supportive good business makes employees feel recognized valuable, I’m wary national corporation using bottom line marketing point. 2 cents... don’t know that. really wish did, live constant state anger anxiety now. never ending stream catastrophes, corruption, stupidity every front. many Americans ignorant, prideful, stubborn? Feels like risky business unless there’s good legal waiver. unlikely vaccine cause people issues, people inevitably side effects. stay home home watch netflix. 

I dont care dont job, simply going insane staring TV.

Just.stay.home. husband positive keep testing negative 2 weeks exposure. test Monday. I’ve cough week. today I've hot mess. Earlier stop coughing, chills, muscles hurt. took ibuprofen got hot, started getting runny nose, started sneezing. can’t stop sneezing it’s midnight.

I seen math yet, [there 32 000 people living 1.25% residents die week without vaccine. Norwegian authorities saying could minor side effects pushing really frail edge, numbers, looks like might well random. 23 deaths 3 weeks group 400 die anyway much. we'd need know number people vaccinated know sure. think CDC overly cautious updated data asthma since beginning. Several studies shown link asthma COVID severity.

Here latest DSA riddled idpol, varies lot chapter chapter. I’d recommend joining class unity first Thank you! I’d pay $500 per person family. Hopefully businesses make mandatory. exception actual medical reasons. point believe congressional representative contracted receiving doses suddenly doctors tv

Not watching TV anymore would good start.  Also Brazil variant, dangerous UK blocked arrivals South America. That’s separate tale requires steak ale separately also free, covered insurance gov reimburse. many downvotes people refuse face ugly reality mutating virus. got temporarily banned Covid support quoting Dr Fauci said vaccine proven prevent infection transmission! Truth needed deal pandemic, spins facts cater people wish hear cannot fathom handling different scenario. Or, things worst *first* time. it’s second time. local TJ hasn’t switched back waiting line get yet. Though, we’ll it, it’s around corner happy to. Everybody scared going hospitals due secular issues, live India, know horrible issue here, everybody spreading misinformation careless husband always prided ability make amazing home steak. strict oil, salt, pepper folks. started adding butter, rosemary, garlic end... man, it’s exquisite 🤌 Never going back deleted account. Get match. mention, crew one US's expensive important military assets. You’re alone. feel exact way. It’s infuriating. get angrier covidiots every day. Depends hospital. Last place socal, reusing N95s keeping gown multiple patients (ie PUI positive positive). hella sweaty, low gowns. Hospital even enough surgical masks everyone. Gloves donated Costco. 
Where I'm new gown per patient, toss N95 done (but worn multiple patients). Surgical masks galore. healthcare workers do, wear N95/KN95 mask regular triple layer surgical mask over. Replace surgical mask would otherwise wear KN95 multiple uses. lot restrictions have, unfortunately, way. plenty things know start, messaging so, bad, restrictions turned bull, people changed stance, seemed like political flip flopping new evidence.

People cease exist close something. cease exist *at location*, politicians trying look tough COVID, get ""more better"" mentality. necessarily better. close grocery stores 6 pm onwards, COVID spread grocery stores 6 pm onwards. Instead, everyone crowds grocery store 5 pm, gets infected COVID, spends extra 2-3 hours home maskless family breathing air.

The goal minimize mixing groups maximizing time spent controlled environment. Work home possible wonderful intervention. Lockdowns, appropriate done sustainable way eye future, also great interventions. Closing bars international travel makes whole lot sense. Shortening hours, closing beaches, telling people go parks, closing outdoor dining, etc... make whole lot sense.

Normally I'd say, ""no harm, foul, good understanding,"" lot stuff common sense, backtracked lost lot confidence people. kind feel like joke would sad year. it’s sad now. 2020, enduring riot last week, we’ve earned memes jokes this. would suggest Israel denied? 

Drop vaccines hospitals' mail boxes secret? 

Invade forcefully vaccinate random people (due coordination happening)?

Because see great suggestions would turn comment sections everywhere. Damned do, damned don't. appt first shot doctor nurse teach how. Mine little cavalier (just jab lol) complicated. also gel want shots point. Last year people angrily telling stop wearing masks March 2021. almost people now? many posts “I’m wearing mask get vaccine” virus doesn’t care want care tolerance threshold deadlines set. He's trolling cos even remember last time corona case community. Immediately knew QFC referring to. Even then, year lasting immunity would solid, would enough roll vaccine. time yearly vaccine ahead time people's immunity expires, we'd fine imo hate actually. People motivated get vaccines solve biggest crisis humans millennium  No, 6pm every day starting saturday. Arizona isn’t listening either :( hope test comes back negative, I've 2 scares tests negative.

I've thought could store / captain. perplexing crew / mates would pulled stores outbreaks sent back store.
That definitely corporate choice.

As said transparency awful experience wish better. :( loved TJs COVID, experience I've handling pandemic left unsure them. Remember donald saying 100k dead good job? Haha social anxiety years. 2019 finally went shrink got sertraline. 2019 best year life. free anxieties stuck home again...FML feel hard. think covid wayyyy much, probably haven’t worked almost year now. Also haven’t lost anyone covid, know bunch people lost relatives virus. 

Lately I’ve feeling like want die. I’ve suffered depression anxiety life, don’t remember last time bad. rarely see friends anymore (when it’s mask on, outside). get groceries (curbside pickup), go long walks, stay home. keep telling vaccine soon, feel hopeless. Weeks? mean 50 weeks maybe. France instance would need vaccinate 30 million people least. currently track vaccinated 1 million end month. that's one shot. got username? Aka 90% reddit users. It’s really sad hold one group accountable every societal issue rather realizing problems span political spectrum.  Silly Xi make disappear vaccine free places still charge fee actual process injecting apply goverment reimbursement on

Likely Target means they'll wave fee staff get store pharmacy right, restrictions probably getting devastating virus point. get say ""aye aye captain"" frowned upon? 

If captain fires someone, say walk plank?

Do ""swab decks"" instead mopping? 

I many questions, cause worked I'd full pirate mode nonstop. agree one, even though I'm place (South Africa) see significant number vaccines months. 

What annoyes is, J&amp;J tested vaccine here, lot also manufactured here. Yet, first 100 million made - shipped US.  Dog needs covid test, lol.

Don't think like getting long swab nose though. Nonono, 6pm everyday, starting Saturday. :-( Although possible, think able prove fomite could cause infection COVID specifically general thought concerning initially typical healthy person. Well shopping Trader Joe's often. delivery? yeah same. happy provided explanation quickly .. doubt much confusion :) Pfizer thru COVAX facility = 20 million 40 million doses. (based 20% total population)

Vaccination start February Sinovac 50k doses Pfizer undisclosed amount doses (might 100k per DOH Secretary discussing cold storage capacity). “Israel first country issue ""green passport"" residents received COVID-19 vaccine. passport lift restrictions, including mandatory quarantine following exposure infected person, offer access cultural events restaurants, according Israel's Ministry Health.” 

I certainly see utility strategy, it’s way encourage people get vaccinated stratify population according risk. However issues outstanding- as, still don’t good data whether vaccines provide sterilizing immunity (that is, make vaccinated person isn’t capable contagious even symptoms). know vaccines protect severe disease person vaccinated they’re walking around spreading virus, that’s big problem you’ve given passport exempts quarantine. Also find notion vaccine passports little icky, I’m healthcare provider believe everyone get vaccinated also don’t like idea overt measures. again, completely understand they’re it.  Followed instructions, needle came side, wat do? Okay vegan pesto literally liquid gold Like kind life think seniors living right now? Even people asymptomatic massive lung damage. Paying people get way going get 100 million 100 days  Unfortunatly looks like area prime area study many people get infected 2nd time rate many milder, worse Germany certainly eat without working, government supports companies keep employees even can't work instrument called ""Kurzarbeitergeld"", paying like 75% wage, unemployed people get ""Arbeitslosengeld"", like anyone would starve Germany...even people want work get money.

Is alternative? Sweden showed isn't, worst Europe terms deaths. Yes, fun affecting mental health. Yes, hurts parts economy. But, death lot worse.  Use smallest needle possible. takes longer draw can't even feel goes in. ones give way big... much per shot? know bunch people lost relatives covid. It’s nice none friends got sick, lot people do. 50 ages. 33 people 60+ different reply here, sounds like person may familiar extent conflict.

But point still stands. vaccines work, know it. sounds like bad captain/store? Since every store left it’s captain entirely them. work store don’t mess around. captain takes good care us, mates. Heck, could still write lunches around mid-November, captain kept sticking us higher ups finally told stop. (For reference, I’ve talked friends stores said stopped back June July).

But yea- definitely case store. day someone tests positive store, get notified day. also get told last shift aware worked able spread not.

I’m currently waiting test result come back since worked shift last person confirmed positive, I’ve symptoms (here’s hoping negative) mates nothing supportive cool it.  I've read paramedics get paid shit? true case? Right, belief purely based scientific chief medical officer, Tal Zaks, said “scientifically” would possible formulate new vaccine expect work without testing tens thousands volunteers. added bringing quickly updated shot market would “depend regulators.” is. time kids small fleeting. kids 8 12 I’ve able work home last years I’ve thankfully able stay employed pandemic reason. look kids baby toddler pictures joy also heavy regret didn’t spend much time could have. Maybe every working parent feels extent? case hope get good place stay there. Korea posted doctor refuses vaccine would permanently lose license.  expect certain freedoms US expected countries. freedoms trade offs

Medical licenses revoked board. Korea highly aggressive contact tracing. Basically publicly announcing details COVID cases point figure exactly tested positive. US would never allow level privacy loss.

People Social media smart phones, think care much privacy, Haha ONE, lol. part missing protection reinfection may last short period time. 

We've virus less year reinfection rare may rare year now. 

So need virus remain circulation low levels enough peoples immunity lapses virus spread again. us right things.  Well, concerns mice can't simply project onto humans.

I two pet mice article bother all, they're remotely worried  long use N95 tossing it? I’ve worn years profession typically threw maybe two days. treating Malaria U.K., amongst others, hasn’t got money afford international aid budget spend more.

Because pissed wall lockdown paying healthy young people stay home, go work, lose jobs. cost circa 1 trillion pounds, 1.3 trillion USD, or, 14700 gbp every man, woman child living U.K.

Which part bankrupting entire global economy bad poor people Africa people struggle with? need wealth creation donate. It’s state funded healthcare. don’t generate wealth shutting western global economy nigh 12 months

International borders completely shut. suggest fly doctors aid in, governments Australia New Zealand place outright flight bans travel? almost got fired calling starting experience symptoms. Wanted make sure safe, passed relatively quickly. got money. It’s governments banned shopping small businesses told stay home. Also use site look tests per capita, see many countries testing almost half rate less higher ones. People throw around case numbers time think lot realize big difference testing rates. Whatever makes happy. Sounded like grind. loved work well, 10 years running 6th gear took toll. progressed level normally 20-30 year person field wished pumped breaks awhile. Stay yo! Jesus crazy. got covid December despite things supposed to. Thankfully end hospitalised still sucked, I'm still recovering. people blow 💯 assholes. contractors? place mom works mostly contractors basically told get Covid ‘don’t come back’. Seemed really shady it’s also shitty small business.  live France right now, can’t believe even grocery stores near home closed 6 p.m. It’s super inconvenient.. mean open first lockdown strictest. side on?


I believe governments able tell us shit republican lines better. guess probably libertarian. 


I believe hackers trying steal give away vaccine information need continue political thing decent human thing. 


Again pandemic nothing politics removed political thinking it.


I'm human race fuck politics. central NY surprise. absolute mess They’re like roaches, theyre everywhere. kid not. Look it, it’s crazy. im Latino, btw). also displace poor Black families, Liberals seem okay that. Go figure. need night, turn light, speak gratitudes aloud. that, tell people lost loved ones COVID grieve them.

It's easy, almost year later, longer feel pain, horror, sadness deaths. become c9mplacent.

Let's best speak grief aloud, home public. Well people put forth data. It’s easily accessible inform yourself. 20 somethings, unequivocally less deadly flu. Thanks still don’t know means. husband works people disabilities provide direct care used future. created call/text list figure many extras available. supposed start next Tuesday got call today. I'm hoping open spouse possible, I'll wait turn. I'm glad wasting it. Looks like older iPhone. Maybe 5? That’s awesome! I’m Dry January plan alternate wet/dry whole year. We’ve got this! Neither side ever cared middle class never will. zero chance goes WY? I’m sure that’s state. one, let’s say it’s yeah? fairness, we're trying avert second civil war.

I wear mask, wash hands, attempt keep people six feet live area hell lot rat lickers. times go pick online grocery prescription medication orders. Ecuador? looking chose Bali fuck (just barely made everything shut again). Maybe right. memory announced 3 times deaths previously counted. Yea it’s bullshit people starting realize it, lie someone case everyone long realize shits adding up. Well, concerns mice can't simply project onto humans.

But would personally prefer Acetaminophen (i.e. Tylenol) NSAID (Ibuprofen, Naproxen sodium, etc) safe side COVID-19 positive vaccinated. Probably best thing state #1 at. ""rugged Wyoming individualism""...😷 Average + 25lbs. ROFL welcome making false report authorities moron

Prolly watchlist since 1992 find really give fuck She, numbnut. first job got six months looking. Pretty sure covid worse experience streets also hope get it, suffer it, die, clearly value human being, get dirt already, wasting potential fertilizer. coverage Coronavirus change coming weeks Biden president? one perspective, many hard time hard time everyone else's countries. potentially learn lot world opening mind. Unless depression, stress all, truly become harmful. can’t help wonder deserve demise it’s big priority? We’re similar position Vietnam, think we’re pretty happy living lives rest world gets shit together. Really? sure that? might want look charts. They're animated see whole progression. Despite things bad CA, we're even close top list deaths per capita. change search dropdowns. Here's deaths since July, point every state knew either locked sneak peek: god forsaken right catch covid either steal medical treatment could used save others give covid people kill them! Wont one think comfort freedom spread virus?? Anyone know private businesses Philadelphia area administering 85 year old grand father? True, reported infections even unreliable reported deaths. different perspective reasonable timeline, please share. states decide administer vaccines. FDA provides guidelines states final say Idk don’t rp first time someone, would relevant. God even thinking makes upset lmao think like humans capacity keep running full capacity long. terrorist attack disaster rev mentally can't sustain long. Eventually trend back normal level, even everything around us still abnormal.

I saw thing Christchurch, New Zealand, earthquakes 10 years ago. six weeks whole city 330,000 people like big family, everyone everyone else's back. watched amazing spirit gradually fray fade away people got lives dealt issues. terrorist attack last year. I'm betting NYC 9/11, apart immediately affected.

We're good fight-or-flight evolution give us capacity handle sustained stress don't, eventually mentally park let slide. haven’t. why? 

Those masks halved cost last 2 months alone. 

$60 50 pack KN95 masks suppliers cut EUA list(available June October FDA decided get rid shit tier ones brought back oct supply issues). vaccines coming besides AZ J&amp;J? 100% [There excellent article role mine Mojiang might played virus origin Interesting. tell me, armchair epidemiologist, happen polio smallpox? Undocumented* immigrants

Why side always leave part out? It’s disingenuous. People stupid, COVID great job brining forefront. 2nd largest county population. 2nd populated state country. fucking embarrassment believe also South African variant they’ve found. Sorry I’m veering offtopic. That’s nice tiny smartphone lady picture. it? happen? live NJ didn’t hear it. also agree non-citzens, Americans took precedence, no? vaccine limited supply.

Please, exchange emotional arguments logical ones. I'm 16, day since started highschool 2 years ago. also college going me, made thousand trading stocks.

I like work school, therapeutic. Yes. like ""use by"" dates food. set date/time point certain spoiled. long use time, good. use shortly time, probably good guaranteed. Correct. priority groups slowing process.

Granted NYC NJ, 24/7 sites open hardly anybody uses. surprising, many 75-year-olds want 3 a.m.? let anybody get plenty young people turn up. anywhere since March? None retail, grocery workers, food works those. paper cloth masks Yeah taste good. point lockdowns ended really helping stop transmission, CA whole worse states who’ve essentially back normal months work retail, maddening. I'd say least 50% customers come either completely maskless noses exposed. According boss, since police, can't require customers wear masks store even remind policy. joking. 

I also least three coworkers (including team lead) wear masks noses regular, yet manager (who claims ""following policy"") says nothing. bring up, complain ""they can't breathe"" continue behavior. 

Did mention team member come 'rona? Yeah. 

I request take register due stress dealing maskless day. Plus, asthma. I'm already looking another job worth it. saw link. agree it’s disgusting many people die malaria it’s something know fix. Absolutely unacceptable. 

But don’t agree either/or picture paint. seem suggest letting young children die malaria order save old people COVID. absolutely case.

All tragedies effective sources cynicism but, understandable, that’s constructive either. Going hell laughing someone said ""Don’t close MLK would want people get vaccine!""

But yeah lack urgency concerning large percentage infections closed cases yet, count unresolved cases IFR, know many die yet. feel you. I’m never going again. trust people general people life. would rather left completely alone. Read comment come back. well, might happen Israelis get vaccinated. there’s reason healthy 25 year old access diabetic 65 year old? cannot believe anyone even considering taking seriously We? support China everywhere possible then? USA. Complete failure response covid government busy fighting power struggle always far away dealing population actually needs. That’s conservative estimate. Since actual overall value lower it’ll take keeping tabs several hundred people really see impact. No, 40% thinking...

In time get herd immunity vaccines, following might happen:

Spread new delaying second dose vaccination vulnerable lowers case non-pharmaceutical interventions get infections/ day amount virus replication risk vaccine evading mutation case adjustment mRNA vaccines cover new variant(s) 6-8 weeks previously vaccinated population would get jab order reach herd vaccination herd immunity via vaccines becoming non-pharmaceutical interventions shift extreme lockdowns elimination strategy instead herd immunity vaccination even bigger hit economy

Thoughts? thought Brazil already mass vaccine?  50% office tested positive week. 15 person office still it’s lot. Yes. Voluntarily. Fine. afford go restaurant will. cannot afford luxury going eat get take ""Experts"" jump fucking bridge. ends whether like not. know judge book cover, exactly would picture vaccine denying pharmacist. Anyone want explain means me??? Cuomo claimed ""it preposterous"" ""declaration war"" think see data Israel pretty soon, vaccinated highest percentage population agreed provide data Pfizer took year get there, thanks keeping bandaid 2 3 us infected yet would like stay way get vaccinated. Last checked, 33% &lt; 66%. math changed something? range mean massive death toll hundreds millions get it, also enough death toll many people take seriously, thus insuring hundreds millions going get it. :( Yeah see thing. There’s evidence that. It’s feelings conjecture personal politics vague guessing mean, that's bad. Could way worse.

And things inevitably speed up.  make sure ticket credited dates changed without fees. That's I've haha Two three computer literate, it’s obviously intuitive. feel legally right though? work construction. necessarily think guys caught virus work, cases really high area knows? We're waiting Biden administration start taking seriously. Yeah mean pretty obvious us, dunno OP went wrong THANK GREAT SOURCE great! didnt know pay vaccine, much it? store near us absolute go-to things worst. always felt safe there, went beyond business did. made point chatting cashiers often, said felt really well taken care of. business perfect, shitty time, they’ve amazing.  fully agree. We’re careful 90% people know real life don’t things. go store, go walks, play golf, go bike rides. wash hands touching stuff outside mask 100% time inside. love Trader Joe’s polite employees. US probably 5-6 months form normalcy

Every expert topic saying exact opposite this, they? Made sermon church message. Focus individual, stop stressing problems outside circle influence.   can't right. shows Florida lower death increase national average. read reddit, Florida falsifying numbers actually completely control close anything.

Strange facts meet narrative. OMG... frozen naan stock long. Pop one toaster oven nuking tikka... restaurant quality, outstanding covid times. I've never gotten flu shot -I intentions starting never get flu. mean point get I've never gotten flu shot -I intentions starting never get flu. mean point get rush get it. I'm content waiting turn looks like months good testing. I'm one...not mention yes cost lost work hours factors must get twice. medical advice either - I'm saying opinion ifs.  Yes. covid models ridiculously wrong. wish part “normal summer” true... might doses, it’ll take bit everyone get vaccinated normalcy return. Still, completely agree optimism think many people get much normal Julys Augusts vaccine proven safe effective. I’m sure  too. It’s harder get Trader Joe’s US Capitol! depends state/county rolling out, guess 

I’m Pima County Arizona grocery store workers included second group front line health care workers. They’ve already started rolling vaccines group (which includes teachers, law enforcement, others well) Yeah. Made sense early on. Figured that's we'd do. still waiting. using vaccine hail mary pass fix woes. comment overall issue, argument, answer, along vaccine hopefully!

You votes! we're little b*#%@*$!
Even scary cause understand affects almost complete shut would economy, worth try. Call science experiment! Walmart still take life insurance policies employees?  buy things Amazon Unfortunately, appears CDC reporting total doses administered first doses administered. updated site 15 minutes ago, they're showing 9.7 million people first dose administered: NBA uses rapid tests didn’t reveal reinfection, testing positive twice. far nobody confirmed reinfected. 

we reports coming saying antibodies people last least 8 months probably more. sure got guaranteed 2-8 from. SARS, covids twin brother, immunity year two. never confirmed 2-8. far, it’s probably minimum 8. may wrong I’m not

this pretty bad look you... Dollar General paying employees equivalent four hours pay get vaccinated. Trader Joe’s cashier: Ah vaccines. tried yet? They’re soo good. gating online appointment system  Yes, people actually need get vaccinated (i.e. people without natural immunity) much lower. CDC estimates 90M people infected. yeah many people don’t even know asymptomatic. Also, guidance previously infected people vaccinated anyway, don’t really agree with. good amount people end getting vaccinated anyway. think it’s people enjoy negative It’s going end going Amazon anyway, matter give money honestly idea we're supposed get vaccines nothing sell. attempting say someone give reason believe science? problem then, you. going selectively read data come conclusion able explain came thst conclusion based data share information others come conclusion provide data gives insight possible conclusions. Quite simply, going forego actual information favor personal experiences, willfully ignorant choosing wrong due pride. will. Face consequences decision making. That's beauty life, right? protected government still every person making decisions treat others whether want around people refuse wrong consider world larger zero effect individual business getting involved lives effect them. FDA approved

Technically Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), meaning fully vetted yet. results sufficient warrant safe ""restricted"" use. case restriction pretty much anyone 18+ (ok, Pfizer 16+). mean storming US Capital politics? Yeah it’s I’ve always felt safest grocery shopping. Especially early on. top it, elderly hour early morning, parents could go get groceries. That's interesting, thank you. oh wow that's wild. Im UW qfc near campus fine part self checkout sometimes there's lot people. Politicization * don’t care. I’m going Arizona weeks go visit family play golf. Gonna go every night golf enjoy life shit state locked months. Feel free stay home got life live. Same. around us incredible. Great staff, great food, etc. They've handled Covid stuff well also. short attention span San Antonio getting quietly wrecked wave 2 covid deaths speak. Im burnt out, calls stop, crew slowly getting irritated everyone handling this. expected quietly shoulder pandemic Texas remains largely open. second time. Last round 3 months solid calls deaths general. Recently experienced curfew dominican republic (they 5pm weekday, noon weekend curfew)

The primary impact 1-2 hours curfew every store total crowded madhouse people finish grocery shopping, curfew nears traffic increases metro/buses becomes shoulder shoulder full everyone rushes home. crazy, can’t make heads tails what’s going on. normally don’t get flu shots getting move life fear dying every time go out. haha Louisiana running laps around guys. pitiful. 3 minutes long time. masks on, reduces risk. Depending distance could skew higher lower. I’d guesstimate low moderate risk. course. healthcare system for-profit. Charity money build largest medical center world Houston. approaching world war 2 numbers... employer brought us back early May let us work home unless mandated actually get quarantined. course, supposed stay home even think may possibly sick. extra sick days anyone. 

And slashed salary months last year. 

It's nightmare. Plenty stores area still tracking (not though), given number times see people standing line outside stores I've run errand, go work (I'm mostly remote entirely), etc. Washingtonian too. don’t know enough make educated statement, sure seems like state’s decision administer doses equitably means really fucking slowly stupidly. access coronavirus vaccine work, I’m scheduled get third Hep B vaccine two weeks. anyone know recommendations surrounding timing vaccines? Opted vaccine. thanks.  I'm imagining mando sitting couch boxers stained tank top (helmet course), watching office repeat year getting fat.

Or maybe I'm projecting wouldn’t expected (and would reason to) unless live somebody older immunocompromised also essential worker. Trader Joes adapted online orders curbside pickup. one pretending pandemic thing right state emergency declared.


This nice, done bare minimum safety employees customers now. put fucker behind bars. Every vaccine guy spoiled could used potentially save life. Yeah, scared Covid first. he’s saying, old people pretty much getting sniffles this. don’t understand story different either OK, It’s pay like bribe get it, it’s allocating work hours get done, read right. OK, so... Increased pretending give fuck problems... Shrug. keeps fridge really nice clean? Lol.

I understand. first time heard kinda cleaning thought nuts, too.  summer arguing deaths down

They summer, fact. Yep sympathy left.... takes energy keep going work deal whiny adults. sum up... Human intelligence ultimate irony. intelligence facilitated creation planetary civilization provides conveniences protections allows many act stupidity ignorance would guaranteed demise age. question is, anybody getting vaccine aren’t old health care worker? would regular Trader Joe’s employee even getting right now? Anti-virus(who would thought?). 

Where update fingerprints viruses process catching stays same. update this? Morons, think over? It’s everyone obeys restrictions gets vaccine, don’t understand think end game is? I’m sorry frankly refuse believe friend’s account here. Every time covid works it’s way nursing home least 10% people die. Either healthiest nursing home patients united states, simultaneously suffer flu, friend hasn’t told truth. Cool! doubting shit ton literature Covid? specifically saying exaggerated? 

By gravity meant seriousness. 

Wait saying you’re Sweden? Florida reports people flying countries receive vaccine. 100% know sarcasm good god cringed. get intramuscular shots weekly, vaccines almost always afaik tho. I’d say vaccines probs easier heroin since don’t find good vein. Though know nothing injecting heroin... might wrong guess? Bidens plan includes undocumented immigrants. guy know said 15 people work Covid one time. asked wear masks. said yeah wear face shield things. said aren’t wearing mask. said well wearing mask day breathing breath can’t good you. Well even true, I’d imagine Covid worse you. Imagine Covid lung struggling breathe. Well least didn’t breath breath day. 'Resident' physically lives US Yeah, lot people still wear masks pretty easy see everyone given up. mean want compare deaths compare deaths... it’s everywhere heavily anti mask, care help employees denying union   one wish would would area I’ll surely take get :) honestly can't tell sarcastic not.   Starting see pattern 100% meant. Trying clear least US, ""administration charge"" previous comment stated. Ebola. virus extremely lethal contagious, yet eradicated US even though cases long ago.

The lethal is, stronger response be. Even dumpsterfire nation respond adequately watch neighbor family literally shitting death.

Not trying shatter fantasies here, low mortality rate one reasons Covid poorly handled - would hard call disease hoax every person got coughed blood died. Yep close relative still skeptical pandemic happening.. thought 300,000 people dead bad. ended conversation tempted called ignorant twit. year leaving house work store mentally exhausting.  Mr. Slick is
 board Pfizer. ceiling rate last study 17% realistically it’s much lower considering includes suspected estimated reinfections. It’s safe say it’s rare dude TJs premium brand. make money per unit therefore afford pay hope find place that’s accepting, chill relaxing. Sending love girlfriend God, work Shaws (Star, safeway). kept customer limits like month summer last year NOVEMBER started temperature checks employees. give fuck. want hazzard pay back.  Lol states prob charging 500 needle Honestly think factored high turn determined cost effective. Managers fast food places making like 12-15 hour. knew Gm McDonald’s made 40k year. 

I guess high turnover keep everyone’s salary low nobody long term employee. linked nothing relevant. think genuinely know, slightly mislead early ""stable spike protein"" since early May warnings spike mutations could change vaccine development. know probably weeks well vaccines work mutations ones that? Wtf even do??? would check all? point hit HIT, sail right it.

Fear mongering best. predict COVID infection rates follow curve.  Thing going huge impact people pro-vaxx, much larger impact people Anti-vaxxers. easier likely piss people get boycott store get customers switch another store. People likely take action something hate something like. Yeah recommended districts. PH department’s guidance simply recommends avoiding casual sex. you’re going someone, you’re effectively inviting bubble. Probably best thing right work Trader Joe’s girlfriend bring home almost every night. knew rule what's stopping informing get tested? it’s different strain it’s longer classified covid-19. mutations strain. That's bit speculative - established Type II cells infected?

Yes. Type II pneumocytes express ACE2 TMPRSS2. Type pneumocytes express TMPRSS2.  Figure 2. Whole family quarantining hard in-laws refuse believe exists. get vaccine first, teachers. Teachers voted school make online schooling even option parents. 

I feel like rewarded a-holes. Repeatedly.  must misread OP, interpreted hung days ago. Long day me. 5-6 days what’s recommended, I’ve adjusted post accordingly   said please. 

It is. 

Go get fuck stupid idiots. 

[god smelled good. I'm reading realizing things either banned impossible lockdown... lockdowns increase risk getting covid. need wonder deaths rise. mean shutting anyone's bank account. kick bank wear mask... Americans stupid want it.

Or least vote party that's likely give them. claim disease endemic pandemic.

I provided examples pandemics lasted hundred years--I never said implied pandemics ongoing. specifically said ones considered ongoing pandemics: 

 [WHO | Cholera: Forgotten 

[Ending HIV/AIDS Pandemic ( [Robert Walter [Anthony S. 2018)

[CDC Responds HIV/AIDS | Division HIV/AIDS Prevention (DHAP) | HIV/AIDS | 

* [Global AIDS Program resource-constrained countries prevent HIV infection; improve treatment, care, support people living HIV; build capacity infrastructure address **global HIV/AIDS pandemic.**

 [The Global HIV/AIDS Pandemic, 2006 

The others examples earlier pandemics lasted longer 2 years, including would become pandemic vaccinate them.

I asked multiple times evidence pandemics last, average, two years received none. I'm J&amp;J vaccine trial and, though wearing mask, sanitising etc, avoided going shops buy groceries on, - possibly- vaccine instead placebo (double-blind trial) so: protected? think so? Eg son wife got covid, spent time children knew, catch it. great reason considered immune, maybe? Suddenly, everyone forgets TJ’s prevented workers unionizing. Singapore getting mix Pfizer Sinovac, ton people online trying raise doubts Sinovac. mind asking, what's child's condition deemed high risk? thought handful high risk children whole country maybe I'm wrong. Jesus Christ, eviction moratorium (which would extended another **7 months)** disaster. initially supposed 4 months (in better world) would overcome virus gotten economy back track. People could pay back rent something resembling reasonable time frame.

Extension extension left people 10-30k worth back rent. Another 7 months going add another 10-20k onto debt. way individual family going able pay back.

People need eviction moratorium. need rent relief. long going kick road? Either declare leasing property illegal pay people's rent. sure did. one many things needed happen didn't. sister made lot cloth masks nurses hospital next nothing. Wore sewing machine out. around time supplies got seized, states find ways smuggle in. don’t see incumbent wife get husband needs mental help get psychiatrist therapist. done getting stressed work worsening marriage. thawed 500 doses vaccines direct violation oath made perform duties job.  It’s kinda shitty IMO act like mom’s personal choice versus need money fun craps game. go soup right broccoli cheddar made unexpected cheddar cheese. don’t like unexpected cheese much compared others, soup beyond amazing  current cases would increase IFR disproportionate number current cases result death. Treatment improving IFR trending down. That's good thing. dip cigarette it? Instant application virus.  Great, let unionize wait u floored? think i’m misreading aren’t everyone. bad reaction last one too, mom one hers. feels like there’s over-confidence fuels sort frat-boy loyalty it. honest wouldn’t present panacea. aldi gave us hazard pay...for two months. kinda crazy hazard pay went away, hazard didn’t. Man 1992-1998 years. get doubled fucked great recession covid crash coronavirus. 

The younger gen Zs deal bullshit older millennials already settled jobs shit there's recent travel means community spread bad news. sincerely doubt that. far acceptance rate high among eligible. Please keep us posted! Karens ones demanding *others* keep wearing mask complaining mass gatherings. People quietly wear mask push beliefs others fall Karen category. poor places America sadly grocery store. Maybe government could make free, like countries. idea! think that's all. whole year there's still end sight. matter deadly something can't think every second every day rest life. People tired it. Regardless danger, humans want live like Anyone else kind feeling morose mutations? concerned time hit critical mass vaccines irrelevant, yes know mRNA adjusted, need get hundreds millions people, America, easy. see stay ahead this......... Try China vaccine? based classic inactivate tech, safer. Oh, people forum support idea. agree sad time appreciate amicableness show. course there's a, ""but"" though.

I'm trying find way get across without sounding callous...Simply put, think better ways go combatting virus. specific groups people risk, think focus protecting them(e.g elderly, comorbid). possible keep everyone afloat prevent aforementioned issues big problem lockdowns. would still next impossible prevent deaths decrease health screenings, particularly cancer. still, aside psychological harm would board believe preferred strategy is. 

What we're harming everyone, type harm going last years, likely decades. Namely form poverty, hunger, opportunity. can't support that. virus warrant combatting virus way. mom incurable cancer last 13 years. made lot medical advancements years, never really told long she'll live, said around 10 years more, might even make long enough cure invented. died last September, think body gave pumped poisons keeping alive long. incredible strength endure 13 years chemo treatments, I've felt stress staying healthy avoiding friends, family, trips wore last year became much. Go Joe intramuscular vaccine too. goes deeper. 

When got last week nurse literally whole goddamn needle syringe. 

Arm sore 3-4 days. I’m trusting EUA Vaccine. real time, pandemic rages stressing healthcare, everyone research trying develop vaccine? Sure dude, know everything know disease even know existed year ago. LMFAO hurts much fully commit needle bounces skin. Alright sure meant donkey guess outside perspective could see that, Trader Joe’s positions named positions you’d find ship. I’m crew member, managers called mates, store manager captain another position called merchants I’m really sure since store doesn’t one. think I’m used now, first started thought comical weird. CDC estimates 30% Americans infected. estimate December.  mean, could also Australia went lockdown nation. state completely board unified idea, even different tweaks it. Part everyone agreeing close borders except essential workers border towns. sort national approach soft reopening saved rest Australia Victoria became epicenter 2nd wave NO, QUIT. could vaccinated paid???  someone works 45 hours week Trader Joe’s, I’m really proud apart company cares. Covid vaccine mRNA vaccine. 

Muscles known uptake large amount extracellular mRNA make proteins (we known rat studies long time ago, mRNA vaccines relatively new thing). step important due protein similar shape spike protein Sars-Cov-2. 

After that, immunology. proteins made muscle cells exocytose get picked Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs). present antigen (protein made muscle) B cells (B cells also APCs, get antigens types APCs B Cell Receptors). B cells help T-helper cells go activation (because spike proteins foreign body) become plasma cells produces antibodies covid virus. media would never count vaccine deaths way count Covid deaths right, bet deaths door.

Just wait one Chinese vaccines start widely used. bet New York Times, Reuters, BBC, Voice America, etc., report promptly. called late stage capitalism it'll never fixed unless entire United States system upheaved people let shove comments throats without burning stake?

These companies provide vaccine free charge, nice them?! read company wide email employer employees required get vaccine. find infuriating. think right work people chose vaccinate. know able get self identify. moot point vaccines still widely available. Thoughts? nurse used two needles, blunt tip fill reasonable time, normal one inject it.

That shit's thick honey. It’s weird companies wouldn’t this? Like it’s good publicity you’d think... Please tell username GI Joe reference TJ general good reputation grocery store chain, especially compared main rival, Whole Foods. said, remember anger early least city. Workers offered much protection. better since summer though. u didnt assume wrong! silly statement like target really said im like seriously? lol last another year truly don’t care others. can’t live like forever, it’s like Ebola level death threat. horrible way live.  Hey Target, vaccine already free everyone... Trying act like they're extending sort 'good faith'. Reminds grocery stores ask donations customers take credit for. Good Trader Joes. Hi fellow crew! :)
(Also sorry, accidentally commented side account) Also FYI everyone involved, mix match beers 6 pack  Dude, they're going set drive vaccinations Kroger parking lots. areas plans place make getting vaccinated easy getting tested now.  Open normalcy thing, though. agree honestly read “hit bus”- example Kristianstadsbladet days ago. Unfortunately seems locked article. meant Depot heroin. animal style Quitting March lol. think realistically nothing involve decades work, planning, patient construction organized pressure work way towards it. 

Lee Carter going run governor Virginia 2021, ex-marine &amp; socialist, unseated GOP Chair red district state house, got [50 dollar month cap insulin co-pays good head shoulders. Obviously big M4A. know actually expect candidacy go anywhere, could said AOC. even win, volunteering &amp; donating good way give issues voice.

Honestly fucking loved living America one exhausting attitudes American's always find excuse country performing terribly. Oh shit I’ve never seen Trader Joe’s. sounds delicious though. roommates company power pay vaccines whoever asked last week.

Then autumn arrived cases started climbing governments sat hands like goldfish forgot everything happened before.

Only hospitals half full decide lockdown again. late... I'm speechless.... immune system complex, truly masterpiece creation. antibodies one component. much still know immune system. know is, different immune cells memory virus. People always say like soviets threw men enemy ran bullets.

In reality value soldiers much also invented lot strategies tactics used day. Specially sniping urban fighting. believed Queen Prine Philip got Oxford vaccine, Pfizer one. Key word severe frailty. Everyone keeps saying msgs above, one said why. (Obviously I'm lazy google) thought supposed free old Joe hits office? 6000$? might well demand million $.

What government going do? repossess cardboard box? Pfizer vaccine approved 8th Dec Oxford vaccine approved 2nd Jan 2021.

We started Pfizer healthy old people - people could walk hospitals.

We cautious first three weeks - hospital vaccinations medical help hand case needed.

Then expanded vaccinations GP surgeries - old people healthy make way there. GP surgeries get either Oxford Pfizer vaccine - depends deliveries. 

The Oxford vaccine easier handle one going care homes need cold storage. know, I’m sorry hear friends families “Accruing data reinfection SARS-CoV-2 **suggests** primary infection **may not** consistently confer long-term immunity infected, although frequency reinfection correlates effective immune response **remain poorly understood.** 

**If** immunity wanes time, exposed individuals **may** revert becoming susceptible, providing new susceptible population may contribute transmission.”

Not study. Nothing prove. ton hypothesis. sure, stand pronounce ""not option."" lot dieases somewhat preventable.

Respiratory diseases – 3,9 million

Obesity – 2,8 million
COVID – 2 million

A lot prevetable, lifestyle diseases take huge junk money healthcare, covid. Lifestyle illnesses take large part hospitalizations.

9 million people die starvation year. Millions die poor conditions. invest trillions get number down? Sure. we, real question?

While COVID causing suffering thru America, FDA agency really concerned sugary drinks, cornsyrup, free-refill drinks, XXL meal sizes. Makes wonder? postponing necessary decisions, could prevent many diseases.

It’s broken before, I’ll try find comment link it. it’s simple headline would like portray, basically inaccurate. People miss freedom never get back. NPR piece linked simply presents views various people organizations -- specifically B'Tselem. nothing ""believe"" people indeed said NPR claim did.  


You need believe **me** specifically, form good understanding reality least read opinions people organizations, perhaps read history book two, open arguments outside little bubble ignorance. clearly done that, refuse now.

Absolutely, feel like government role dictating costs associated administration vaccine. would impossible do. places, like trader joe's, pay couple nurses couple hours large corporation would need coordinate entire day get staff 300 done. ignores logistics maintaining vaccine freezers thawing appropriately. infrastructure different across various entities. huge business might able administer 35$ person trader joe's might cost 70$ per person. government supposed decide that? allowing companies charge government opens much abuse.

Ideally made free administration normal PCP. People PCP might need additional services efforts get vaccinated. Yeah get covid probably die. get vacc ill.  someone actually works food rescue picking donations grocery stores, totally, 100% wrong. definitely better others, pretty much every retailer donations program. know already use Oxford vaccine more... start elderly used Pfizer? think would simple done properly. think became hard lockdown done well goes forever.

The early lockdowns China real hard. remember correctly people even allowed leave apartment weeks except go hospital. ran food, groundskeeper would bring groceries. took numbers went drastically.

Lockdown Europe today means ""everything"" closed except for: offices, factories, supermarkets, pharmacies, family visits, sports outside, business travel... -- basically lockdown means everything open except bars, restaurants shops (some people say enjoyable things closed). going months numbers quite stable ""much high"".

Looking back think really hard lockdown 8 weeks early days (or maybe one autumn) could saved us months semi-lockdown. Unfortunately cannot anything hard anymore people barely accept current restrictions. fear go barely acceptable semi-open state summer hope next autumn enough people vaccinated. cook home steak bit butter pan. It’s fantastic imo.

""Freedom"" - pathetic word hurled around white slaveowners. means nothing I'm dead I'm burying four children shit. Totally miss that. we're really comparing countries, fairing well compared US. 

Nine European countries top ten deaths per capita, US number ten 1,199 deaths per capita. dozen European countries 800 deaths per capita. Canada Germany half US' deaths per capita around 462 542 deaths per capita. Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway outliers 300 deaths per capita.   Survival. People like Dr. Scott Atlas, Donald Trump's ear, actually preaching need 100% infection population-wide. Let nature sort out. called ""Herd immunity.""

There's LOT people feel way. want know why, go look demographics vulnerable COVID-19. It'll pop right like punch face. Yeah played ""Breathe"" Prodigy.

With unacceptable lyrics like ""Inhale, inhale, victim"" ""Exhale, exhale, exhale"".

No surprise there! putting numbers table comments disregarding favor opinion rough estimates numbers. I'm merely pointing arguing totally okay matter that's point. point making. trying say things think opinion act like fact. exactly wrong. blatantly saying things acting like big deal someone points something did. care exactly dangerous. case numbers high like Wuhan February, spreading among rural communities, easy access food delivery etc, living together smaller houses, possibly lacking running water appropriate hygiene.

 [Hubei: Biggest spike COVID-19 cases rural belt province suggests nearly 86% spurt cases reported rural areas. Amazon, pay us get infected...

Yeah, McDonalds went business years ago. mean, due respect problem free market optimal solution a) don’t care distribution b) externalities. Now, economists (at incredibly basic level-which understand even little) ignore first one obvious solution government make pie big possible redistribute (which people ignore). second issue problematic solved government incentivizing things good side effects/fewer bad ones (eg. fossil fuels might cheap make money company it’s parties interest use them, society whole feels net penalty accounted for). 

The labor pool become area free market fails operate efficiently without use big government. optimal solution many businesses probably pay low a) really redistribute wealth since moral imperative help people live b) low paying jobs fails create wealthy consumer class needed drive economy (that said,though means economist even knowledgeable economy- imo many reasonable solutions ranging higher minimum wage UBI). Lockdowns gonna crowd essential businesses store hours shorter. new variants? ""But statistics say schools breeding grounds COVID!"" - every COVID denier ever People work free, guess. taken long people start understanding going costs virus.
The fact Chinese listed liver, heart lung damage side effects also talked possible brain damage well seems mean nothing.
The reports China virus air borne.

Remember right start American government said member armed forces caught disease would discharged forces medically unfit? 
The statement removed quickly feel people White House fully briefed virus chose ignore warnings keep economy going possible. Trader Joe’s often better prices items find brands elsewhere :D

I think part makes TJs frozen food good there’s one brand - you’re rolling dice whatever sale supermarket week. presume TJ’s buyers build relationships sources, customers get consistent experience (a la Costco), enjoy/am sucker TJs brand loyalist UK two cases anaphylaxis first day Pfizer vaccination (we ones discovered affects allergy problems, trialled).

We give Pfizer vaccine people allergies.

Most vaccinations done UK via Oxford vaccine traditional vaccine, mRNA one. 

The traditional method take virus, sterilise make harmless, inject - body detects foreign object makes antibodies lock onto spike proteins. Therefore real live virus enters you, antibodies kick immediately recognises spike proteins.

The traditional method produces harmless vaccines, they're sterilised can't really hurt you. work one, allowed say. Otherwise would get panties tied bunch. cant tell this, ( grocery store company) made record money last year. gaurantee wont pay penny give us vaccine. find reasons fire us.

Checking society Now!

I Wish! Man... wish like time true ...and gotta wonder, resilience stupidity? really know. know answer all.  So...I work Higher Ed. hybrid classes since means classrooms use main role supporting tech, I’m expected due “professionalism.” 

The 1st floor classrooms, third admin offices (where is), 4th faculty offices. Beyond students faculty first day, building basically empty.

Hand sanitizer everywhere, one way entrance, one way exit signs classrooms. Students wear masks faculty teaching regardless distance podium first row students.

We wear masks public areas distance, remove alone office alone cube.

I almost zero contact students people teaching 1st floor faculty offices 4tb floor. constantly touching public keyboards mice.

My boss every day tell expects others, can’t anything people don’t come in. much I’ve done regard remote configuration, reply “Well, like coming work”

I trying split days coworkers there, don’t seem taken advantage able work home feel bad half days office stay normal hours, I’m changing routine late game.

I’m 33, medical conditions would make Covid “worse”, live alone, social life, go nowhere except work,grocery store, pet store pick food.

All said, felt like org handling things “ok”, thread worried isn’t sufficient I’m concerned health around me.

My school requiring testing staff, faculty students campus month. get tested don’t isolate get results...testing pointless students don’t give shit leave building. Luckily non-citizens country can’t catch spread virus right? can't right!! That's awful.
What's reasoning this? barely normal include Hawaii Alaska - honest you. I'm former Hawaii resident. Reddit pessimistic life general, purely covid issue.

Just visited Newburyport weeks ago tho! Twas beautiful! Yeah I’m too. haven’t worn wedding ring months hand sanitizer destroys skin sits ring since sanitize hands every interaction literally anyone. actually kind like wearing mask (which maybe part due fact I’m huge introvert, still, wtf never thought I’d like wearing mask).

I used obsess it. bought supplies could need months start spring well prepared all. point, wife orders grocery pickup never go stores. job fairly low-exposure since I’m electrician work totally alone. interface homeowners it’s always one time usually outdoors fairly far apart masked.

It’s kind natural procedure point I’m beginning get used it. It’ll feel weird go world without mask eat sandwich without mercilessly sanitizing hands beforehand lol. using April 2020 knowledge January 2021. It’s absolutely insane. 

What differences? Awesome It’s getting extended. don’t know long yet. advisor quoted CNBC day saying debate currently March September iirc correctly. That's smart. many people going exclusively shop TJ's now? pretty interesting -are serious? I'm upset -I'm curious. Edit: Actually reminded town Idaho August one anywhere wearing masks. went restaurant ate (all staff maskless) - whole town seemed like everything normal wonder doing.  That’s headline says Grocery chain. DG variety store. Wyoming never vaccinate million people population several hundred thousand less lol odds another lockdown Biden takes office? commend you, part. personally want see much longer term test. make sure long term side effects.  yet still felt need lock 22 million people Hebei outbreak involves hundred people (at least officially). facts come form numbers reference point. 1 every thousand people Sweden died damn virus. immunity ways off. 

“Scientists typically estimate vaccination rate 70% needed herd immunity, entire populations protected disease. fear extremely infectious nature COVID-19 could require significantly higher In-N-Out, That's pandemic's about! Idk, smell lawsuit coming. basically study followed 6000 medical professionals already previously infected (and antibodies). repeated PCR tests group, time 44 came positive classified either possible (42) probable (2) reinfections.

If 44 *actually* reinfected, gives immunity rate 83% (based math incorporates background rate infections previously uninfected HCW) - that, maximum 17% able spread time period. assumed probables actual reinfections, raises immunity rate 99%, gives 1% potentially able spread. imagine we'll end value somewhere middle 83-99%, good job setting range.

What mean 17% 1% wherever actually capable spreading - seems likely, although certain, many would asymptomatic much less likely even unable spread (this part study, although another person said something secondary infections actual paper, we'll look get preprint). Basically, question addressed, assumption testing positive *may* mean infect others.

Hopefully answers question - 1-17% regarding people antibodies. want ask asked somebody else: symptoms tested test without symptoms positive?   Professional indoor Christmas caroler. California. Well know I'm getting groceries future I, got laid October. Found job November, unfortunately would difficult WFH position. \*First Austin, clearly.  Nah usually WV lead, SD second swingers parties raided police I'd amazed 1000 people. Probably club party. think family would shot talking virus spread.

Trader Joe's has/had done stop spread COVID-19 White House. assume that. country I'm aware accept yellow fever antibodies lieu vaccination, want vaccination. problem, person still vaccinated. Italy spring. temp instacart, get vaccine? I’m 61 keep $25. r/s Yeah, California expand want (from phase 1A 1B), counties ignoring hardly enough vaccines cover '1A' population.

Heck, going make things without regard reality, go way expand vaccines everyone? discriminate, give everyone false hope.

(Do sound bitter state's poor handling vaccine distribution?) Zero covid take years. point move life see met owner company work (and put notice to) Karen’s aren’t ones wear masks, chief.  Let's honest tho, whatever good things happened Texas *despite* Abbott, *because of* Abbott Yeah think right move expand it, still think it’s fine tiers. said expanding access huge part population we’ll see things go. think issue tried stratify much made inefficient. state officials acting like gonna running supplies opened many people (which don’t see problem), I’ll believe see (and I’ll happy see it). grocery shopping responsible transmission?

No, isn't. device existed, Covid would wiped now. know really. nurses, probably mlm scheme something? Love hate I'm one experiencing nonsense :( Wtf “to pay” mean? need see numbers.

Ugh, usually exact week annual trip California (I’m Canadian) company. I’m sad missing California sun I’m also salty hitting Traders Joes per annual tradition. It’s always great! meat section fresh meat? Fresh cut produce?

Not grocery. Curious levels son symptoms doctor prescribe T? tried tell em Dems better way control life. argument mom today getting vaccinated. Delusional....that's say. that's like washing cotton candy running water exposed something you’ve vaccinated against, often noticeable immune response. anyone know long exposure (in vaccinated person) occurs noticeable response occur generally? specifically COVID vaccines general. media would never count vaccine deaths way count Covid deaths right, bet deaths door. problem handling data. 

A COVID+ test death within 60 days counts Covid death. apply vaccine, one would want take it. LTC near 15 60 residents die, 9 already hospice care. 

I think counted ""vaccine deaths"" raise question Covid deaths.  Actually, think many people know someone got didn’t go hospital. conclude it’s bad virus keep running around social possibly spreading it. health family way important job afford quit vaccinated. ruined physical mental health job years ago also missed lot time kids small. regret every day. opinion internet stranger. Good luck stay safe. think fair assume point tho get vaccine, restriction lift, going get covid one way other. Way many people silent carriers rules Covid Vaxx? I’m essential worker whose government subsidized Covid Vaxx, rich dude another country come fly cut line? don’t float boats man, leaves violent wake. Y’know, good boat metaphors 🤷🏼‍♂️🌊 Difference whole foods absolutely awful staff, whether nice customer think correlates staff treated. Eh. Good them. also prices increase help set this. 

Should optional. Elderly risk first still. 

The vaccine prevent virus. vaccined person still spread virus. literally point paying anyone get something could save (when get paycheck wearing seatbelt?). honestly wondering thing. know wearing masks suck worth making sure people around okay? Yes...security theater get people (who believe it) things, like work, getting haircuts, going dentists, getting fast food...
Honestly, I'm sure understanding statistics.
Did also think concept fewer people actually fever feel like crap willing go things?
Yes...you understand correctly, saying active encouragement spreading far outweigh benefit turned away...but still well may infected person taking temperature anyone else nearby wake. Honestly, I've never understood cheaper better burn minimum wage workers reason give shit thus turn sub par workers pay decent wage expect willing work hard stay. think continuity employees much valuable chain owners seem think. Imagine fast food joint everyone years, knows job inside out, *cares*. would go store. bet know them. don’t fucking listen Q. I’m wrapped privilege assume everyone get vaccinated time, strings attached.

If true, people would taking advantage healthcare available *already*. Use something world. 

“The vindaloo like scrapbooking.”  Ohio one mutation similar UK might make contagious outline Haha, test subject whopping 2 hours pay. deal. now.

Doesn’t matter many precautions take home assholes office don’t bother. think California's [$8 billion unemployment nothing compared government's waste. let virus spread inside little conspiracy groups. matter us? think depends local level. cities offer free, others may charge fee. American, excuse. I'm ashamed people's attitude here. mean anything made Wait reports gave millions people sugar pills would die article says two hours it’s actually 2 hours pay per dose. 4 hours total.

You’re right. people psychologically hooked lot things. people called abusers... people need help stay far away kind psychologically addictive behavior. 

This goes without saying....

If abusing substance instead using prescribed, setting bad time. Sounds like you’ve learned experience. I’m glad learned lesson.

Gosh, stubborn. Listen, know listening anymore stuck hammering point. Therefore I'm going show study humans survive high heat going show study humans die heat.

I'll go first: India’s largest vaccination drive using two COVID-19 vaccines set begin January 16, healthcare workers, first receive vaccine, option choose one vaccine other. rule applies high-risk groups would get vaccine priority

In contrast, Indian regulator issued restricted use approval Pune-based Serum Institute’s Covishield based safety immunogenicity tested India small number participants safety efficacy data large trials 24,000 participants Brazil, South Africa U.K. bridging study require Serum Institute test efficacy Covishield India rely efficacy data trials done outside India.

The restricted use approval granted Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin even absence efficacy data. approval solely based small number participants studied phase-1 phase-trials; vaccine efficacy studied phase-3 trial.

In addition, Covaxin greenlighted “clinical trial mode” matter “abundant precaution”, clarity whether medical care case adverse events compensation would provided, informed consent taken recipient immunisation. conditions riders case Covishield. Hence, correct compare situation India countries using vaccines interim safety efficacy levels known?

According Union government, vaccine sites offer either Covishield Covaxin order avoid providing recipients option choose one vaccine other. Since COVID-19 vaccination compulsory, people walking site provides Covaxin choose get vaccinated.

But ethical offer one healthcare worker Covaxin whose efficacy unknown another healthcare worker Covishield whose efficacy known even though face risk infection work? “This situation could avoided government waited weeks efficacy data Covaxin become available granting restricted use approval,” says Bhopal-based Anant Bhan, researcher global health bioethics. “They could begun vaccinating Serum’s Covishield added Covaxin approving based efficacy data.”

Will healthcare workers others refused get vaccinated Covaxin offered another chance get vaccine priority data becomes available showing vaccine least 50% efficacy, initially stipulated Indian regulator approval? Likewise, Covaxin found less 50% efficacy, everyone immunised vaccine offered Covishield another highly efficacious vaccine? far, states fucking far federal government. saying feds good, simply looking different states' metrics shows fuckup regional. seen anything yet, can't speak directly slowing something vaccinations. welcome information.

\-skip end summary. Save 6 min. Read comment. see words cannot afford? Except proven time time impossible.

Many older people immunocompromised people essential workers. can't stay home.

People live multigenerational households, especially lower income people. older people live younger people risk people small spaces.

Everyone - risk not, goes places like doctors office, dentists office, pharmacy, store (not everyone afford get groceries delivered, sometimes need something right away can't wait delivered).

People live nursing homes living facilities workers go time. many cases secluded isolated matter - 1 staff member inadvertently comes virus spreads like wildfire.

Things getting better vaccines, luckily. way isolate ""at risk"" group. studied researched frankly possible.

Also: death rate younger people may low, still higher flu. still kills young people. even doesn't, long haul symptoms uncommon. Many young people survive suffer months end various chronic symptoms. bet homeless terrified huge fine, police officers find good use time write ticket. jesus like Pearl Harbor happen lawmakers unanimously said “it is”. Yay math, right? looking people populations macro level looking trends periods time, everything becomes numbers patterns. can't throw around numbers support whatever want say say numbers really matter ""the human element"" never accounted look numbers. realize stupid makes sound?   Omg sounds like life. go person teaching pretend it’s transmitted schools. Meanwhile 30 staff gotten school alone. Weird. Within two weeks. still person numbers higher ever?!?? Also, glad you’re ok! Yeah, six saw last shuttle launch remember disappointed ok it. ten saw first falcon booster land got super excited it, time 13 super space flight. turned 14 transferred public school homeschooling. first freedom ever first time around people old enough things also tired parents.

I skipped grade, 9th grade skipped 10th I'm second week college. also helping run space colonization infrastructure advocacy group certain parts 250,000 members. joined recently Amazing feeling actively involved space related things instead watching. numbers misleading. week Jan 5 holiday week. 

For example PA cases say 15.4% that’s true cases falling peak. 

Looking hospitalizations, 12% last 2 weeks. Morons. Cmon one ever said 10-20% death rate saw increase 35% deaths 2020 hospital. excess deaths covid-19.

It frustrating see comments like responded to.

😠 22 million people 16+ Texas, go 75% herd immunity target 16.5 million target number. Anyone recommendedations order good mask? Cases going finally Know someone 40s trouble breathing month thanks virus. Ugh teach person wanna quit. full blown full speed ahead highest time ever. Also worst town state highest numbers. wrong people? vaccine like month away guess don’t care die. need choose live job risk dying US much larger places... first wave never dealth with, pushed 4 corners country time. places open first place. Contact local politicians tell take covid seriously. Otherwise: listen crazy busy area people pretending covid exist, need money. make busier makes harder sanitize. first thing go rushes us-- one worked food service trusts food drink safe this. Make food. Make coffee. pay fucking cash, absolute baboon. Stop touching hand things, typhoid fucking maries I'm Canada get it: liberating infect others? Yes, 90+ million known COVID cases, handful confirmed re-infections.

There also handful confirmed PowerBall winners millions tickets sold.

If people infected recovered could get sick within months, we’d know now. Honestly, think it’s borderline irresponsible we’re still hedging point year in. go office part time WFH rest. company cautious work within 100 feet anyone temp checks daily wear mask open area. I'm ok going work know ship laptops 99% company works home. 

My wife worked home years. Unfortunately, still thinks whole serious wants whole family go vacation March. Insanity! Smart work can't eat. gonna stay locked forever? sustainable. effective solution barely contains virus destroys economy mental health. check CDC site Texas allocated second fewest doses per capita state (48th 50). 19th doses administered per 8th % doses administered based Bloomberg data. Bloomberg lists doses allocated, state reports several hundred thousand allocated doses yet Yes, circle back then? thought promised vaccine would free? think pretty well established top model apt here. Especially mild cases often lung involvement 86% mild cases loss taste/smell usually proceeds symptoms. India already call Britisher Virus. sad. Keeping bars open ain't helping. No. saw effect vaccine trials also. Placebo group statistically separated non-placebo group starting 5 days first shot.  Work company 400 people (spread across 5 states). think less 20 cases zero hospitalizations employees employees families. What’s anecdotes coworker died etc one serious case company? company fairly conservative barely anyone wears masks (many people still person meetings). Would bad told ""Fuck Off""? swear, idiots world... work tech took HOURS make parents aunts appointments.  many employees have? must high percentage. provinces premiers fucking royally. feds supply rolling in, logistics premiers figured out. People care care months really sad. 

I checking workout classes online noticed LOT studios California holding classes indoors. stay home order, outdoor workout facilities allowed. outdoor facilities studios allow remove mask bike workout station.

Restaurants street operating entire time indoor dining, outdoor dining cases. 

People careful traveling 10x before. 

It's frustrating stupid human beings are. disagree, we'll continue see higher mortality rates vs pre-pandemic increased disability, loss job-related health insurance US, fallout missed health screenings, unforeseen factors. know point shock people ""dry tinder"" stuff argument wrong. fair, find lot news Twitter, also consider link sources don’t invest heavily memes homemade graphics (which people pass around pretty easily). Great comment mean China? According Bloomberg guys used 27.5% doses given, 49th % states. whatever reason they’re giving fast. Hopefully stadiums open changes.

For comparison Texas issued 49.6% doses given. 

I’m North Carolina isn’t great either 33.6% know rapid test testing antibody virus?

How prove one antibody virus? may schedule - Canada pre-ordered 38 million doses J&amp;J vaccine.

There won't, can't, delivery schedule Health Canada approves it. Wait ... HEB vaccinations?! Automod remove post comment says ""herd immunity"" wonder article:

As Wednesday, 168 employees tested positive COVID-19, according outbreak data released Wednesday Colorado Department Public Health Environment. figure from[ 145 cases last late December. Best luck getting N95s. work field providing still widely available. **developed nation/bloc** largest population

A developed country large population immense power fronts. pile bills pay premium insurance.  completely fucked. 

I hope yall ready get yearly covid vaccine. going away. thought Dakota's issue, could declining there? Califonia strict lockdowns place, increasing? old saying goes: ""Familiarity breeds contempt."" really surprising COVID exception this? Really? Thank you! don’t know I’m getting downvoted lmao. wondering didn’t know amount time wait negative result younger (25) person health issues, beg disagree affecting us. November wish anyone. place got infected claim getting vaccine.

This going next fun part people. Sure vast majority refuse get vaccinated! Whatever, point, want gamble lives away, go it, stay tf away anyone able get vaccinated yet wants to. people like make can't wipe virus entirely worry mutations vaccines may cover. Single dose, able stable standard household refrigerator temperatures? body ready! really aren’t lockdown all. Everything open. bars inside dining. 1000s people about. Malls open. Beaches open. People everywhere. question, caught Covid even stayed home, used hand sanitizer, disinfected everything, wore mask, made susceptible catching Covid? 

Our bodies need healthy bacteria immune system function properly. using things like hand sanitizer disinfectant, essentially killing good bad bacteria needed aid immune system fighting viruses disease. isolated outside world, make susceptible catch virus floating around (not Covid) go out?

Could overusing things like hand sanitizer (that create antibiotic resistant super bugs viruses), create contagious mutations Covid? Yeah could forgot. everyone who’s slightly intelligent capable high school logical reasoning making Chinese propaganda — Americans denial. 

Pandemic happens every 10 years so, attitude next one could last one them... believe laughing something makes go away? choose respond cannot dictate response you. 

It sounds like upset LOL comments getting desired response reverted insulting someone insinuating developmental disabilities. really piece work, man. far ignorant bigot rabbit hole going go? aware comments seen anyone reading comment history, correct? issues vaccine cause? Sorry you’re getting downvoted legitimately want know. 88 year old grandmother get shot would nice know look chooses get still quite while. Far longer pandemic. People incredibly adaptable. grandparents bought rural farm cars. went years going town times year. saw nobody. Fully functioning people we're able rejoin society funds. 


For mental health, stop focusing end gave up. Focus serious question. 

I able get vaccine free could soon. I’m trying gauge it’s trustworthy. 

Thoughts? I’m anti vaxer, trust medicine. However, sick COVID gov gave us untested medicine told doctors use. It’s weird gray area. association Safe Injection Global Network, longer recommend swabbing clean skin disinfectant giving intradermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular needle injections.

I also don’t think there’s much difference subq IM injections except depth pin. 


Common consensus steroids sub dont swab don’t aspirate. [Charts describing duration neutralizing antibodies Moderna line represents 1 person 34 person study. charts misleading. y-scale uniform. Normalizing y-scale shows [rapid vulnerable age groups (50+). day 200 would basically negligible, given 27d half life. Normalize y-scale. Look: cost controlled centralized. Much easier determine cost every single dose one entity negotiate with. They’re basically ones still Philly area. two types antibodies, IgG IgM.  job offered $50 get vaccinated becomes available us. amazing. 1918 flu happened 2020, would unimaginable number casualties. 500 million dead people 5 billion infected worldwide

The fatality rate disease result interaction disease's effect body ability mitigate harmful effects. hundred years ago, hospitals oxygen supply, automated ventilator, steroids antivirals. Go aldi!! horror! Imagine locked country, lead normal life, instead allowed freely roam outside world, full lockdowns, overwhelmed health systems, infectious virus. Humans adapt years probably.  given people damage already. asymptomatic COVID get lungs fucked up, want play dices long term health. COVID viral pneumonia, flu, cold, means never underestimated  people don’t take seriously

What odds people anything different done far? also costs money create vaccine yet, cost absorbed. 

it's like giving toy batteries. reporting separately making HK part China? logical. England Wales separated national football teams, fact make two different sovereign nations?

See graph   
Otherwise ... +70% top awesome good way. Well yeah, world's strictest lockdown would useless otherwise That's I'm asking, unrealistic we'll stopp vaccinating maybe change give something middle class. people never get anything either political party. Hmmm mail situation? I’m always weary getting mail. think so. hypotheticals, maybe known quickly could done, social measures might eagerly embraced, even better results. end, people going people. trial data. makes feel better basically 0% chance severe issues covid 16 (barring significant health issues). said sick Im Quito. one hand big dirty South American city. hand Andes beautiful. see three volcanos house clear day.

Anyway, yes, wrong system allows cutting line. goes whether share nationality not. I'm saying, focus energy making sure vaccine reaches everyone rather preventing someone getting it, whether assholes not. Deal shit true problem fixed. Well, sure hell found whoever makes beef broccoli, cuz shit amazing, every one I've tried since moving (closest TJ hour drive away) *suuuuuucks*. worked TJs 15 years, stores 10 main Boston office 5. left company work somewhere else moved new place far keep commuting Boston. covid lost job re-applied work (left really good terms, gave office 3 month heads moving could find train replacement) didnt rehire either back local store.

I'm allowed free time see fit. brought conversation tagged earlier. individual past conversation reinfection made glaring error attempted make seem like somehow proved point left previous conversation making error. making outlandish claims like ""IgG antibodies end-all-be-all immunity comes reinfection SARS-CoV-2."" that's demonstrably false. IgA cell immunity shown critical, secretory IgA actually critical early infection.

Again, people need read damn literature. Read damn Crotty paper look damn figures.  IgA falls rather quickly tons patients. Much faster IgG. Figure 1.

Let article hang warning free world - know want media looks like onion news.  No

This 14 days first dose people 65 older naturally weaker immune response. right line expectations. Europe never control, thinking could keep foolish. Anyone eradicate virus done better ramping non-social distancing NPIs. Rapid tests. Mass testing making use pooled testing. Contact tracing. South Korea lived low levels community spread months months, they've managed get winter.

*That's* model. Well German 400k+ deaths  It’s people don’t trust govt statement shows little know horrors war. Also case sample taken people ages 65 older. official trials skewed lot younger 

Could slightly less effective older people starting see immune systems naturally wane started mess begin busy tossing doctors jail?

Also, it’s easy strong containment method citizens rights.  LA never really lifted restrictions. led people gathering private, probably worse.

As vaccination numbers rise cases drop going get harder harder hold back flood keep everyone masked slightly overpriced totally-not-copies companies food stay pantry. don’t know actual Chinese people think. Hell, Chinese people don’t know actually think. That’s authoritarian countries work.  It’s binary thing. Obviously masking, distancing, working home etc. happening. It’s neither 0% 100%, it’s somewhere it’s making difference. Doubtful. Though I've given lot thought even toyed idea, many outcomes would without restrictions. think argument could made following:

Restrictions summer could foolish allowed larger wave winter (e.g. CA vs. FL, FL half hospitalizations per capita right now), expecting vaccine come next Fall. may made sense build ""base"" immunity make winter easier ensure hospitals withstood wave also allowing businesses make money COVID waves spreading slower.

Economic activity would higher without restrictions... bit. people *would* sequester cases got high. would still considerable depression anxiety, around restrictions around cases. Long-term effects COVID would effect people's lifespans (much like restrictions effect making us fatter lazier). Hospitals would collapsed 0 restrictions, actually would catastrophe.

What needed happen massive ramp non-social distancing NPIs. means testing contact tracing, *effective* masks (i.e. surgical masks KN95s, single layer cloth masks like everyone wearing), ramped hospital capacity, ramped public transport keep density low. money laundering. shut  started vaccinating absolutely oldest people care homes.

350-400 die every week. three weeks vaccinating, 1 200 inhabitants died. got vaccine died.  Welcome Reddit. bit irresponsible promote vaccinated people go without masks? understanding still unknown whether vaccinated people transmit others. like un-vaccinated people, masks protect others themselves... would okay lie people something important. honest big reason attitudes toward masks way begin experts trusted. deliberately lied public way back beginning pandemic mask shortage said masks nothing trust people would save health care workers... sadly backfired. You’re right. It’s much inconvenience thankfully. worked schedule pretty nicely changing tune get infected.

Aldi's said too? Trader Joe's parent company? expect certain freedoms US expected countries. freedoms trade offs

Those freedumbs need sacrificed save human lives. One person's freedom ends another's life begins. President power mandate national lockdown. Thank slutbanger, cool No, they’re trying make sound like they’re shifting cost paying employees incentive getting vaccinated vaccine paid government already.

If start vaccinating enough people worry anyway. Good you. truth many mods like sub. 350,000 deaths 4,000 dying per day meh you?

&amp;#x200B;

We know vaccines prevent symptoms 95% time. know people infected never develop symptoms extremely bad spreading :[One found infected 0.3% close contacts, showed infected 0.7% household members. know 5% develop symptoms probably vaccine mediated reduction symptoms, hospitalizations vaccinated volunteers far. pretty confident get mild symptoms far less likely transmit get severe symptoms. ""The secondary attack rate increased severity index cases, 0.3% (CI, 0.0 1.0%) asymptomatic 3.3% (CI, 1.8% 4.8%) mild, 5.6% (CI, 4.4% 6.8%) moderate, 6.2% (CI, 3.2% 9.1%) severe critical cases."" figures alone, assuming vaccine mediated symptoms pattern spread natural infections, would expect 90-99% reduction transmission post vaccination. still take precautions may still possible asymptomatically spread covid. get control 2nd time, expect salty surprised pikachu memes again. guys seem get it. 22g still fucking harpoon test. 25g slinpins you’ll never look back. Smaller needles also lead less scar tissue buildup, even injecting smaller needles often big needle leads less scar tissue buildup. It’s better split dose test week depending ester test stabler bloods. basically *work school only* lockdown 

Rather saying *Stay home, work remotely get temporary unemployement* government saying *you right go work/school need stay home everything else.* minus side means people go buying groceries 17 18 expect shop even crowded (At beginning covid worried tried shop week, obviously one month latter going shop like every 2 days) believe 3M ones (at least them) exhale value. Many years ago broke radial head elbow skateboarding. ended getting bill $800 actually pay; sending bill formality. 

Just little later I'm watching L Word friends character show exact thing happen them. sister something 'sell out' take job offer modeling underwear Calvin Klein cover $50,000 medical bill. always ballpark number.

Immunologically, 12 year old materially different 18 year old, strongly believe data show vaccine safe pediatric population well. still low.

The article says:

""Based California, become one COVID hotspots, company giving workers two hours pay get vaccinated.""

So paying employees getting two hours working company going get vaccinated.

It's cost company since employee actually work store whatever. People better choose: quarantine 'fatigue' real long COVID-19 fatigue. Chronic Fatigue real illness serious consequences sufferers  Lol. Probably fat ass would.get rekted covid second. There's one hill climb holiday surge over. late get ride? totally agree, don’t think it’s light switch much dial. point normalcy return stages, early summer likely restrictions place things like international travel big concerts.

In parts US west, ""normalcy"" may well return mid summer. People read shit. think everyone antivax state side effects happen. lower efficacy announced Tuesday would mean would take longer countries used CoronaVac’s vaccine reach “herd immunity...” 

But, course, ""the developing world"" (in cases) far better west controlling covids-19, thus less reliant vaccine turn tide. line clearance, installment validation H2O2 monitoring regulatory/QA issues insane people. Don’t underestimate it.

Not fair get vaccinated someone else even opportunity. people refuse vaccine that's problem, least give everyone chance.

Best correlations needed everyone get vaccinated, vulnerable, 60-year-olds above. result death rate small would pointless keep restrictions place. Oh yeah rip thing constantly.

For example, India apparently less 10m infections total. likely- India best covid response world, they’re massively under-reporting number infections? Fair enough rebutting first part comment, still think ultimately latter portion matters most. There's zero minimal benefit attempting count accurately (nor method TJ uses possible larger stores).

Don't get wrong, great TJ, also harshly criticize stores try thing. Yeah we'd walking hands dodging drop bears, silly. nrw, dont test children, for, dont symptoms...
And tests optimal moment 20% posibilities deliver false negative... test 1 milion people 20k positive... Maybe sending around 200k positive people home... Besides, nobody check ones quaräntene really isolating...

 [study false negatives Nasty feeling like shit. people know take next day due feeling like moderate flu. warning older make sure tylenol rest after. currently identified increasing mutations point concept 'herd immunity' likely allows greater numbers mutations? would seem greater number people becoming infected, creates opportunities virus mutate. 

One concepts taught pursuing biology degree, organism mutate change survive, simply mutation/change organism allows survive. mutation seen UK (and possibly elsewhere too), makes virus infectious therefore likely survive. reduction number infections, chances mutation make virus likely successfully treated original vaccine?  Absolutely. punishing landlords, too. 

Either housing universal right government needs step pay housing commodity market needs regulate it. Forcing landlords let non-paying tenants stay 18 months crazy. exactly wifes progression. hardest part years temptation smoking made almost impossible. Last year started one gas station vapes never turned back. Shes done better since. Even got mom switch vapes thought would never happen. Personally im last cart last fall off. lasted 4 days. almost gone. today quit day. Lets hope sticks time! also quit cigarettes switched vape, find vaping would smoked lol 

Nicotine fucking curse. Oh ok thanks Fuck Bolsonaro. Also, fuck Trump. Also, fuck China. Maybe know multiplr people fine first dosage second thats side effects like flu. saying isnt sway people getting it, want people get it. say hey hes fine dandy prepare second dosage might dozy make sure tylenol rest second dosage. people read shit. back British mutations goes. smh. I'm gonna use buy mom really big dildo “Officials Butantan Institute São Paulo said Tuesday trial conducted Brazil showed CoronaVac vaccine, made Beijing-based company Sinovac, efficacy rate 50 percent. rate, slightly benchmark World Health Organization said would make vaccine effective general use, far 78 percent level announced last week.

The implications could significant vaccine crucial China’s global health diplomacy. least 10 countries ordered 380 million doses CoronaVac, though regulatory agencies yet fully approve it” Looks like AZ/Ox purposefully included them, Moderna excluded them, I'm still trying figure Pfizer did. different here. sounds though average citizen sensible here. Probably also staying better informed. Oh help help r/conspiracy people ganging me. Actually, thawed Pfizer vaccine pretty stable. 

""After *storage* 30 days *Pfizer* thermal shipper, *vaccination* centers transfer vials 2-8°C *storage* conditions additional five days, total 35 days. thawed *stored* 2-8°C conditions, vials cannot re-frozen *stored* frozen conditions."" personal opinion got Pfizer much better data older people (one main reasons US approving AZ based UK data lack data older people). Also, gut feeling, think used Oxford vaccine would make public matter national pride, etc. -- maybe knows. Obviously don’t want global catastrophe gigantic proportions. back British mutations goes. smh.  Trump tweet. want people vaccinated. Im simply stating second dosage likely experience side effects. Drug dealers everywhere rejoicing underestimate total shitshow US comes vaccinations. Lots pushback antivax movements too, expect done quicker lower vaccinationrate EU country.  Well maybe used wrong term. I’m saying serious healthcare crisis America would addressed healthier weights Brazil playing Karen knocking store door 8:30 store actually opens 9:00 ANOTHER Pfizer Moderna vaccine trials recruit volunteers symptomatic known previously infected, believed 10 percent participants trials virus, said Dr. Moncef Still vaccinating would make less risk rest us? labor controlled Target therefore included price. US bought vaccines companies included labor costs production controlled price. 
No idea analogy supposed equate that. like bought groceries Target made include chef's fee cook it. I’m waiting 2 weeks second shot I’m done. I’ll still wear mask indoors it’s required that’s it. No. boils to: old vulnerable people thing matters. Children matter too. really interesting. Back early February, noticed Garmin fitness tracker kept displaying low ""body battery."" Like, really low. usually charges 90% 100% every night sleep, couple days barely breaking 20%. figured something wrong device, felt fine normal level activity. Saturday (about 2 3 days started), felt little tired. went bed get Monday.

I fever 103 hard time getting down, well terrible cough control, total weakness (could hardly get bathroom tiny apartment), food tasted like cardboard. weeks after, keep normal fitness class routinely felt winded. I'm healthy 30s something woman used go gym several times week pre-Covid. idea had, interesting see Garmin device basically giving warning, thought broken. 🙄 time, partner kept wondering Covid, infections barely started region, seemed far-fetched. think also testing death's door, - although felt like absolute garbage - wasn't. definitely resent thing pisses anything type 2 diabetics (T2D) priority whereas type 1 (T1D) not. T1D absolutely ahead T2D since evidence infection tends severe T2D. Even risk, it’s absolutely control whether get T2D, unlike T1D. also feel like would stretch. 

I could see someone covid dog days returning infected dog shelter someone else gets dog know dog licking someone's face they're wearing mask going catch enough virus infect someone quickly.

I'm really dumb person, honest, see it. shot meaty part deltoid list symptoms appear drug trials. might one ten thousand might random chance...but appear trial.

You can't put everything call good. something like 95% 18, thus age consent? peninsula back Aug, nice weather. Almost want move back. Can’t handle California weather great time. half sarcastic.  bad housing market confused thinks it’s California priced. federal government power general. also ability set national drinking age, got around cutting funding states make minimum drinking ages 21. choice try smoking “this person idiot” condition, shouldn’t anyone else’s problem. simply true. bottleneck EU number available vaccines. Open window. You’re welcome! Exactly thoughts lol Good /u/HarriJokker

The way opened helpful setting tone interaction imo. Maybe facing criminal charges however trying sue someone yes heard attorneys want $5,000 retainer fund estimate it'll cost 2,000 order retain attorney want five thousand front. know anyone who's got thousand despair Especially they're fighting job  arguments never good faith. Typical shaming tactic confronted facts reason. Congratulations second stage grief, denial anger. btw don’t believe hell, maybe that’s lack logical reasoning apparently don’t enough incentives DOCTORS... since 50% refused hospital ATM machine take Tylenol ibuprofen get vaccine avoid it, may make vaccine less effective. also seen research (flu shot) says take getting vaccine avoid it. Either way please research this, know taking otc medications may zero getting ignored news, it’s horribly right too. Highest total deaths per capita nation still, 10-20,000 new infections per day rapidly rising. Yep never could NRT like lozenges gum. Sure delivered nicotine half addiction action. Hand up, hand down, inhale, exhale. meal. drinking. 

I tried vapes times never stuck deep still enjoyed cigarettes. last year stopped enjoying them. smoke really hit spot 99% forgettable, even regrettable I’d suddenly become acutely aware much stink. good salt nic vape finally gave alternative smoking replicated habits wasn’t painful nigh impossible like cold turkey was.

Longest quit dating woman didn’t like smoking, even willpower broke eventually still mentality giving something liked.

I’m glad current doctor former smoker well. gets it. really can’t stand people who’ve never smoked, really addicted anything, say “bro don’t quit?” Absolutely clueless, well-meaning mongoloids. Hard believe. Many states at-will employment laws basically allow fire anyone reason. employee also leave time reason.

Regardless at-will not, also can't terminate based medical condition. company this, ensures company sued putting writing would never stand court law. reason people think something writing automatically legally binding. Putting illegal condition contract make legal. could've prevented entire thing. say ""I think worth it"" - 
A. would killed many people 
B. could total social institutional failure. plan. ""People recovered COVID-19 may 90 days immunity, according [**recent Centers Disease Control Prevention.

The study focused 156 health care workers United States tested positive COVID-19. took antibody test month developing symptoms took second antibody test 60 days later.

The researchers found 94% participants experienced decline antibodies time second test 28% experienced significant decline.

""The 28% large drop antibody levels 60 days, would highly unlikely would protected getting reinfected,"" explained KSTP medical expert Dr. Archelle Georgiou. ""I absolutely think people let go belief safe terms reinfected reinfecting others already COVID-19."" try. people know calling colleagues (healthcare workers lower priority) giving shots would thrown otherwise. 

Right there’s good way around issue, either vaccine sites crowd line waiting others turned away, waste doses, call people know haven’t received yet. absolute shitshow. Indeed is, kudos basically rebate plan. charge $60, charge $100 $50 rebate expect 20% people bother filling. $6000 per 100 customers either plan, rebate plan subsidized people bother filling paperwork. Or, sinisterly - can't, whatever reason, including ""too busy trying pull self bootstraps three hours spend phone."" Well said Wow, wow. can't find anything Costco--anyone know position this? rarely go family son, make sense lot, they're good employees, keep Costco membership up-to-date. think there’s ton information there. There’s also ton bad information (see gluten, low carb, low fat,ect). It’s difficult craft healthy diet, hard. especially hard live society it’s absolute best work every turn. 

It’s also something gets solved month. fuck expect? still eat, keep shit open people literally starve. Yup! hit damn hard super healthy. ran marathons, worked gym 5 days week, health issues eczema. even got reinfected December, thankfully wasnt bad like first infection. Thanks cheesy! Congratulations 11 years. shows lot discipline. US pretty good job... /s
We 100 million estimated infections. vaccines giving people hope optimism. Gotta tamp shit down. Butantan Institute Government Sao Paulo report coronavirus vaccine achieved 50.38% overall efficacy rate clinical study conducted Brazil, addition (an efficacy rate of) 78% mild cases 100% moderate severe cases Covid-19. rates higher 50% level required (World Health results show Sinovac 78% effectiveness excluded mild infections 100% included moderate severe infections. Sinovac trial Brazil also consisted healthcare professionals whereas Moderna trial general population. Healthcare professionals far exposure covid-19 average person. vaccines better able protect mild moderate exposure? Turkish trial sinovac vaccine, got 91% effectiveness. Indonesia's final results come Monday they're expected far better well.

[Peter Doshi: Pfizer Moderna’s “95% effective” vaccines—we need details raw I'm really hoping count appointments set morning. helped dad another older friend get slots January shots. went directly NYS website soon sites opened morning. Seems weird judge able that. suspect fact hospital originally started treatment stopped opened door legal decision. they’d never allowed first place, would much harder argue. Agreed aloud take maak desk anyways.  never stood chance, government never cared politics... get sub. day two ago, sub attacking Cuomo states restrictive vaccine, saying made vaccine available better anyone get vaccine waste away shelf. NJ functionally makes vaccine available all, gets attacked. 

WTF ppl want?  Yeah, that's exactly problem."
