0,2021-01-09," honest pretty badly titled article. Every 60 seconds Africa minute passes. pro-lockdown, fast, hard lockdown month combined rapid vaccine distribution effectively end pandemic (socially medically) wherever still happening.

If gameplan, it, provided financial support available lockdown. everyone feels side effects. people get sore arm. usual, government geniuses squeeze people essential store limiting open hours exact opposite thing do. sit. friends public health nurses first dose two second. friends reporting elderly parents/grandparents getting vaccinated week.

If listened people work vaccines public health everything rolling said would. swear people addicted nihilistic thinking.  24.3901W58.4423N David Attenborough next that’s grandparents done. @ fucking roommates. Can’t wait move 2 months. God save queen Hah. didn’t find confrontational. Go internet! got 1st dose Moderna vaccine 36 hours ago, slightly sore arm - symptoms. concerned vaccine perhaps spoiled stored properly? perhaps needle inserted way muscle? would expected sort immune response. Wife going crazy this. Says weirdest thing lived through. Everything normal suddenly heart rate goes without cause. Runs breath surprisingly trivial things take deep breaths problems. situational. Blames understanding also wish US would something like this. Maybe it'll get people pay attention. know; doubt it. propose kids essential workers? back tank gas

Agree... Also, totally fill gas without exposing anyone else. Mask up, pay pump, get back car filling. think you’re right guess find next 2-4 weeks LA horrible everything honest angry people getting it. shoes i'd get too. process - folk designed it, deserve scrutiny. given 3 months apart, first dose weak providing protection goes suppliers recommendations, first rounds doses much lower infections deaths. state set rules.  Health care workers first.  Take governor.

A 30 something HR staffing rep really stretches definition ""healthcare worker"". disgusted governor's actions throughout whole process. Gavin Newsom waste space. Oh no! Breaking News! virus mutating time. 7pm Lol Yeah lack ability read reddit guess surprise go. Oxford trial got 70% average efficacy. number 30% respect infected people placebo group, became positive

I wonder positive vaccinated ones differ positive unvaccinated ones. Also probably able get Pfizer vaccine wait months it, still would granted (and I'm going to) What?, no! banned sub due posting personal anecdote, lol.

I might like heavily moderated. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

I'm getting mad people getting it, I'm getting mad virtue signalling priority system exposing vulnerable elders danger longer, countries prioritizing elders beyond people actively treating COVID patients. Well sexually transmitted worry would seeing doctor accomplish stage? agree Queen Prince Philip get it. high risk group. However, general observation, thanks anti-vaxxers, perfect opportunity personalities jump queue excuse showing safe. definitely first high risk group, them, especially sharing anti-vaxxer COVID hoax conspiracy theories. Yeah, many posts basically world over; doom gloom. Well, goes Charles’s last hope ever king. handle like fukushima found 8 violations? 8? first day looking violations? little toddlers patrolling perps? law written Braille? Seriously 8? Pretty sure supposed squeeze smaller square footage intervals. supposed use curbside delivery appropriate, evaluate trip actually *need* desire. may desire choose produce, *need* this. Curbside fine (though 10 months, miss choosing produce). wait week two dishtowels new shoes delivered (again, ideal, it). 

It inconvenient annoying, better overloading underfunded, fragile hospital system forcing emergency triage situation. read non-urgent *cancer* treatments post-poned. Put perspective average trip dep mall. curbside pickup delivery option? sounds miserable kinda dangerous all. Makes sense me- they're contact bunch people giving last rites people high risk. mean 14 days vaccinated? unlikely get infected develop symptoms Obviously. else could driving spread?  Queueing: British thing ever. Yeah 2 pitchers £12 would scandalous Spoons back 18/19.

I used get pitcher Godfather £4.99 pint Deuchars £0.99. News flash! It’s vents! SD Sweden's populist right-wing nutters right? Today's forcast calls heavy confiscation cruelty index reaching 76 percent.

ApI hope mom gets better soon. Stay strong totally true. (probably many) right things unfortunatlely infected wrong things. Ah gotcha, appreciate correction. ""Queen England"" kind pervasive cultural phrase US, guess put much thought it. Yes, that’s correct. 

The website says ‘last updated 05 January.’ Moderna approved next day, 06 January. could save bundle NHS disposing people hit average life expectancy, refusing medical care. Since time apparently pure gravy. Feel free correct I'm wrong, bet get second dose 21 days like manufacturer intended, instead wait longer like regular folk, tested recommended manufacturer. means stuff supply chain product, fix problem!

Can't wait try use defense production act cajole someone making medical grade freezers 3 weeks. Damn, kinda care care reasons interest sociological. change system fewer assholes risk lives, that. justice karma, preventing needless suffering.

So part motivation many crushed wheel capitalism, consider relentless need profitable productive problematic. Leave fuck alone. 

No, leave poor websites alone! catch covid is. Come teach school, students' families fill ONE TIME health screening NOVEMBER. Guess confirms little Johnny infect me/my family June. Makes rage. daily screening place, surgery, temperature check. NOTHING. phrased like mistake... say they're a) underestimating death rate covid demographic (they seem think 1%, true states underreporting) overestimating side effects vaccine, selfish, borderline sociopathic, ignores long term effects covid often extremely serious even kill you.

Millions people served war, one became Queen acquired right consume 300 million pounds year. It’s perfectly legal require vaccination future employment. Many hospitals require flu vaccinations continued employment. make COVID-19 vaccine required? Well, yes. vaccine proven safe (it is) logically must died something else. thought vaccine made immortal blood? get nifty new headline:

 ""Outrage: vaccine gets released, amount sitting freezers increases!""

Closely followed by:

 ""People receiving second doses, no-one tell will!""
  ""Uncertainty remains effective second dose beyond recommended date""

people fucking dumb *Then that’s you’d happen.*

Feel free send thoughts Gov. Newsom, he's one power make happen. odds insanely low. way get 150k. 

After 8 days toll 24k. reach 150k would mean 5,478 deaths day.  read silent edit original comment chain find why, massive increase fatalities sick send back nursing home, spread residents well Why? question ""did vaccine cause it? "" answer firm ""no"" cause death becomes irrelevant ones scepticism Nothing inspire confidence anti-vaxxers, bother? They'll say we're lying anyway. mom ICU vent since Dec 16th, we’ve done best isolate since February. We’re devastated say least Depends are, China does, think anyone else does. knew since beginning.... come on. It’s bizarre Boris Johnson, Donald Trump, Prince Charles Prince William got covid. 
What odds? recovered November still sense smell. things considered, I'm grateful worse one weird things realize much miss anymore. Nono that's good one  How? They’re raw material shortages international suppliers lmfao Well, logic anti-vaxxers hit THEY're vulnerable, best interest take vaccine. extremely selfish (borderline sociopathic) ignores long term effects covid often extremely serious. that’s you’d happen. it, fire cause officer refuses. 

Americans demonstrated that, average, threatened real immediate punishment order willing make sacrifice obey law. That’s reality situation. 

People start staying indoors start knowing people got hit several thousand dollar citations so. Especially citations are, say, attached things like drivers license renewals. Police start writing citations officers start fired cause, forfeiting pensions benefits they’re choosing selectively enforce law, disobeying government orders state emergency. 

Some people right thing it’s right thing. Others right thing penalty wrong thing high. 

It’s second group that’s causing pandemic continue unchecked. It’s time make punishments putative enough change actions.  Biden apparently going use defense production act specifically purposes helping increase production. Bolsanaro's gonna accuse everyone's f-gs and

It definitely helped. Californians large full hubris infect blaming others. Can't really fix that. government? Aka special suckers I’m surprised comment allowed stay. sounds like wrong think. Apparently Pfizer vaccine production extremely complicated relies specialised equipment processes cannot rolled 3rd parties without handholding presumably nobody time for.

Gotta plenty junkies would happy help! trying cherry pick sake winning argument. point stands catching covid high chance lowering quality life unknown amount time 'recovering' virus.

The elderly, like everyone else, can’t go movies, restaurants, bowling alleys, night clubs, etc, spreads persists. 

With vaccine limited supply, prioritizing elderly misuse resources.

That's enough 50 million people least 10 times.

Has nothing Trump everything moderators subreddit tenuous grasp facts. banned shit like suggesting vaccine could cause potentially deadly reactions suggesting reach herd immunity 50% natural immunity vaccine.   Yup same. Stuck home. Last met human November. met somebody August. :/ Feb. Can't wait vaccine. Oh sweet summers child. That’s great, congratulations! I’m admin hospital around 30K employees.... it’s gonna still. mean could millions doses every day....? Serious question, impeding ability vaccinate millions people every week? know one easy answer, what's main problem? 7 day old account, first comment subreddit says “test” pretty much comment here.

You banned. donation fodder number one complaint nursing home residents COVID one came visit. Now, pandemic, everyone needs go couch Nana. insider knowledge personal experience (do work field make research vaccines anything else related?) sources would share rest world know cake make vaccine days? 

From limited understanding, never achieved before. sound like would cake me. completely admit I'm expert medical field, let alone one would close enough privileged knowledge process develope covid vaccine. guys arguing back forth, real answer don’t know sure.

1. many people saved hospitals capacity?
2. many old people caught Covid result infected moving back nursing homes?
3. many people would likely got anyways regardless?

There isn’t really way answer questions without time machine best kind statistical analysis using relevant data — still guessing. Neither providing data really don’t see actual rational argument here.  I’ve heard, weren’t obligated pay vaccine wasn’t viable.     
If vaccine viable would obligated pay.    
Same first order. correct.   Thank this^^ thinking terms Pfizer current allocation, hear buying others  also think misses greater issue administering doses, U.S. avg like 30% doses allotted. Tiny pea tiny communist brain see working middle class people. approved kids 16. sure much brings number. mice always charge don’t enough trained people inject vaccine have. need plan boost that, incentives retired pharmacists/nurses/doctors provide injections. Get vaccines help 4-6 weeks. 

But would require forethought planning. something see Jan 20th. We've ordered Billion. yes, vaccine candidate successful need execute options Moderna Pfizer vaccines. hope get approved mean time.  300 Million AstraZeneca, 200 Million Pfizer, 200 Million Moderna, 110 Million Novavax, 100 Million J&amp;J, 100 Million Sanofi. firm orders, even options exists. Pfizer -70C. Moderna -20C. still pretty cold, normal freezer temps.

And Pfizer thought could probably store warmer, tested trials stick -70C now, Moderna test warmer temp.

mRNA vaccines kept colder normal vaccines though, mRNA fragile full virus need preserve it. read replies comment original post? Seems like fair people don’t like this... underestimating death rate covid demographic (they seem think 1%, true states underreporting)

The IFR many demographics 1%. believe 1% 60s.  doubt they'll counting home deaths like NYC did. First good pope many years. happy helping. even read race try find something ‘prove recently reported results phase 1 trial messenger RNA vaccine, mRNA-1273, prevent infection SARS-CoV-2; interim results covered period 57 days first vaccination.1,2 Here, describe immunogenicity data **119 days first vaccination (90 days second vaccination)**

This 119 day timeframe includes first second doses. 

The second dose even referred section 100-μg dose, mRNA-1273 produced high levels binding neutralizing antibodies declined slightly time, expected, remained elevated participants 3 months **after booster vaccination.** Trump finger pointing aside, I'm still trying understand happened. thought point risk production we'd ""waste"" bunch vaccine we'd produce enough every American potential vaccine candidate. would cost billions, excess vaccines would go developing nations. 

So putting eggs basket knowing we'd waste billions excess development potentially investing vaccines work all, one vaccines worked, we'd enough America.

Was understanding wrong?

Did that, even risk-production, able supply enough levels have?

When ""rejected offer more"" insignificant since coming back order ended delivery date regardless?

I'd hate think trying save billion dollars even hundreds billions dollars ended significantly delayed vaccinations. I'm calling first wave mask burning/bye bye Zoom bashes Memorial Day. right election sour grapes. Well, he's always sour grapes. extra sour. problem tables sent Buffalo. Military? Let fucking take vaccine!  Well, Pfizer vaccine [$445 came German government (via BioNTech)

The US government pay anything ""fund"" Pfizer, place order 100m doses total $2bn (which ""promise buy"" funding)

[The UK government invested £90m ($122m) [Oxford/AstraZeneca US also gave promised money several companies via [Operation Warp - see table 1/5th way page figures. I'm sure organized though, terms direct funding vs placing orders... above, ""funding"" ""promising buy doses later"" basically tragedy commons/prisoner dillemma type situation. disease prevalence low, vaccine may advantageous people stop getting vaccine disease comes roaring back everybody fcked.

This makes difficult wipe diseases completely.

There's reason get smallpox vaccine anymore. God should’ve seen mass exodus (driving) Monday Tues Wed preceding holidays. one stayed home. newsom going stop them? months people saying ""a months"" they'll say again. wear mask go large gathering I'm sick bullshit.  bad everyone vaccinated six months. last four years? certainly prefer queuing rioting. Tell it. least caring wife's sons kept occupied. person Trump gives shit Trump. terrifying. I'm glad live do. Fakevid19 lol Oh, expect administration. change fact federal level been. balanced approach. recommend reading. also links papers, refreshing. untrue 3months 4k deaths per day would another ~360K dead.

Once vaccine really starts roll r0 obviously go down, fatalities it, saying. like saved goodness heart. getting paid them. Lord hope we’re still dealing pandemic July Yeah asymptomatic people make roughly 30% infected. It’s huge stretch talk 50% might long-lasting effects. still leaves 20% symptomatic, mild, cases mention. [Speculation] thinking...

In time get herd immunity vaccines, following might happen:

Vaccinating vulnerable lowers case non-pharmaceutical interventions get infections/ day amount virus replication risk vaccine evading mutation case adjustment mRNA vaccines cover new variant(s) 6-8 weeks previously vaccinated population would get jab order reach herd vaccination herd immunity via vaccines becoming non-pharmaceutical interventions shift extreme lockdowns elimination strategy instead herd immunity vaccination big hit economy

Thoughts? I'm ok ate tonight friends 


RemindMe 14 days That’s rough :( RIP  SoCal going nuclear right ""We saved you.""


That's absolutely fluffy wonderful them. mean, Big Pharma everything. What's 20% 350 million. that's many lost work, possibly permanently. Barney Graham's description it, coding sequence popout-popin - nonetheless, trial would necessary :( don’t symptoms I’m social worker people community work isolation, already booked antigenic swab tomorrow afternoon.

My doctor thinks weakness due pandemic fatigue. That's extremely silly way look it. ELI5 DPA do? Haha anyone expecting sort federal plan disconnected reality. almost never federal plan; anyone thought would mentally unsuited sort leadership role. \-in managed isolation facilities.

If even 1 case new variant got community, we'll looking lockdown again. leaving? *Surprised pikachu face*. Good luck! might want read article understand significance B.1.1.7 mutation Likely mail mail back. states expected federal planning never happened county/state health department underfunded slow.

Hospitals also geared mass deployment either, besides fact private entities always looks first, rather state health departments want.

There federal priority database least state one. vaccine discovered priority groups instead population, willing adults. I'm sure states end excess states run out. using army like Trump offered failed deliver, National Guard, and/or local pharmacies. 

No one wondering slot find missed priority group. Vaccines arms fast possible. Thanks can't speak whole country, CO everything reported day late. today's numbers done yesterday.

Tomorrow Monday see weekend drop.  Lol you’re desperate last word, it’s pathetic worry little pal, get this. Right feeling like dying, makes sense considering went through. tomorrow wake it'll another day, another chance loser.  Use learning experience, act like tool next time. much faith, good luck!!! know ""conventional freezer"" is?

Don't conventional freezers keep things -4 F? 30 days first sentence, 6 months second there? Awe crap . hoping covid . They’d beat Yeah, excellent contact tracing also needed control outbreaks isolating potentially infected individuals find patient zero. Otherwise, you’ll undetected community transmission overwhelms contact tracing he's fucking muppet talking OC either. 2 restaurants, area even. live O.C. closed. Thanks completely ignoring point people giving livelihood *year*.

I think unreasonable ask healthcare professionals put work vaccinate people. like bare minimum expectation. still triaging, course, last time helped quality care mid December. got text recruiter morning offering 11k week come help. Nope. Californians following restrictions/guidelines.  Outside big cities, California might well Arkansas based politics. Good point. think say clearly led opioid crisis dramatically worsening. look 2019 numbers, 983 overdoses, 2020 numbers, 1548, seem like could case. take 2018 numbers, 1549 overdoses, confuses situation. BC long problem opioid overdoses, import strong synthetics get supply different drugs. difficult say much worse things gotten result covid precedent similarly high overdose deaths. doctor needs look ingredients vaccine(s) let know Oxford vaccine primarily used, Covaxin secondary vaccine back up. vaccines used emergency use. what? work there's way vaccines sit unused long periods would difficult distributers maintain. work storage moot point.

That *only* leaves cost buying vaccines may work. easy cost justify. PLAN going in, administrstion said ""um no, fuck"" isolated hard. Dont dick. gain belittling someone's hardship difficult time everyone? outlier wife’s uncle died Sunday. She’s wreck.

Meanwhile family funeral, going gather. dad convinced go everyone except one sister trying get go.

These people age 70, +/- 5.  really though? passed point return yet? mortal kombat add new character called Corona-chan. Yep. It’s going news article different day woke middle night headache diarrhea first injection. Literally time life happy almost shit bed motherfuckers pretend like virus isn’t concern.

Why pretend act straight concerning all? /s Except Moderna week behind (mRNA) producers mRNA vaccines. So, spot get infected twice. option? Pretty sure jazz fest scheduled April New Orleans Good advice. good luck you!  vaccine distribution Trump total failure, I’m betting setting records unforeseeable future. want able somewhat normal 2021

There's hope bottom half (or third) it. Yeah masks etc sucks That's one movie real there’s many vaccines that’re almost too, good putting eggs basket! saving second half second dose? Bitched moaned reddit. Displacing anger supply chain mgmt onto HCWs embarked thankless sacrifice 2020, serving Dumpster fire called ""citizens."" Biden said induce act dedicate much resources producing distributing vaccine. /u/ErebusShark2 Trump turned 100M extra senior administration official, spoke reporters Monday condition anonymity, said company offering hundreds millions doses proof vaccine worked “was going get government’s money.” mRNA stuff actually extremely good preventing bad cases. Essentially everyone trials get virus mild cases.

Of course, 100% guarantee, good. US ordered 100M Pfizer, 200M Moderna, 300M Oxford, think 100 200 J&amp;J.

Pfizer offered 100M additional turned later said still saved.

So we'll getting 200M Pfizer total, second batch coming till June July.

The military also ordered think 50M Moderna well. summary...it’s possible, documented super common? Well, dimensions ethics. ""Pope"" means ""Father"" coincidence Catholics call that. know would feel compelled serve regard me. They're actually thorough saturation testing. smooth transition

I hate bearer bad news isn’t USA’s style. Thank equating sacrifices HCWs unpleasantness wearing cloth mask. Try wearing N95 18h COVID ward. get tested? I'd sure hell go doctor's office get tested pass fail wont change anything day day Absurd government get frugal pandemic. 

We could ordered plenty vaccines makers. proper strategy this. cares buy unsuccessful vaccines? ones work make ending pandemic sooner. surplus end distributed countries. 

Seems like case stepping dollars chase pennies. Whoever moving vaccination rollout slowly needs charged murder. need vaccinating 24/7 hours day, everything else hold. important thing all. Period. applaud governors finally punishing slow hospitals reallocating vaccines places actually distributing it. Getting second shot week. suspect folks already need one shot still recommend two. good news get fever KNOW working.. triggering immune response. Plan take day two shot (if can) case get sick. Preaching ""social contract,"" yet given proper PPE, seen job losses, wage cuts, risked lives. saying we're holding end bargain?

Fuck off. supply chain management issue, take issues massively underfunded departments public health state entities, HCW working 24/7.  ""Singapore’s three major universities reported zero cases. secret: technology, tough penalties students willing comply."" 99% effective.

There public data whatsoever number.

Unless know something public know, assume comes place imagination. except though, title/job entirely batshit crazy bullshit logical perspective Poor people's lives little benefits compared rich men's profits. mRNA ones able dose 200M people, baring loses/wasted doses, be.

We 300M Oxford ordered think 100/200M J&amp;J.

If two get approved, willing adults vaccinated summer. Children still need appropriate clinical trials. two get approved, im sure happen Pfizer Moderna already committed current 2021 supply.

Maybe end making -- know potential additional capacity. see billion, understand $3 per person. $80 billion: $240 per person. Less typical 6 month car insurance payment.

Literally nothing respect economic impact ongoing covid. also turned virus seasonal. 

For Lockdowns winter months going significantly less effective.

Lockdowns winter months going crucially important. guess harms worst death. options getting immediate production, late 2021 shipments early 2022 point. left house months. everyone outside Toronto aware, Toronto Sun joke. major infection back March. Hospitalized, pneumonia, still haven’t recovered smell taste. I’m still getting vaccine second opportunity. see this, I’m little bothered. know I’ll get downvote hell this, hear out. 
I front line worker. child. exposed daily maybe 70 years live. feel like greedy granny needs take pass 104 go God. Let people 60-80 first. K. I’m jerk. know. Hey Liz, vaccine get? cities towns receiving doses know deal amount people need treat? havent done research, heard city problems with, logistics, politics ""who gets first""?  Israel look like ""medical professionals"" want see large scale human trials go, maybe decide going risk health take shit show Vaccine.  wish states would mandate enforce this! couple months would quite possibly clear resume ""normal"" life... hopefully minus bombing, storming Capitols, crazy ass presidents! time moderna favorite vaccine first. ordered 100M moderna instead 200M pfyzer. Later ended pfyzer came first  repeat Lombardy, Italy March-April 2020. Peace family well. Peace aunt.  false statement many inaccuracies, kind typical someone sharing partial information push views.
Slovakia country wide testing early october. end november, numbers relatively ok. skyrocketing mentioning, happened end november, roughly line protests wearing masks leading party, happened two weaks earlier (17.11.).
Thus, testing helped big deal, save world entire duration pandemic. Testing, either local nationwide, needs imlemented together various levels lockdowns repeated based situation. Florida, vaccinate 1,000 people per vaccine site. You’re reading data incorrectly. First you’re trying read directly graph misleading. difference appears effective immunity 7-21 day mark could significant lower final plateau immunity curve. Secondly data used form graph followed recorded two doses way know infections would began occur second dose delayed. 

I’m saying you’re wrong conclusions, got isn’t scientific. reason Pfizer still recommending sticking two dose regimen that’s studied evidence supporting. US federal country. might provide vaccines boilerplate plan state need implement own. also happening Germany. states set similar schemes mobile teams elderly/care homes vaccination centres set everyone else. fast enough happening. states knowhow build centres many people need reached. US same. He's got covid already. expect care anybody else?! Good thoughts mom. I'm sorry. know got downvoted saying for. still deciding full year? line. refused skip queue

Hey, wanna buy bridge? Los Angeles county one death every 8 minutes. people flew Christmas

... happy New Year everyone...

Throw Valentine's Day we'll perfect catastrophe. Oh wait, we're already. efficacy basically mild/asymptomatic cases. 0 individuals hospitalized COVID received vaccine, countries trials took needed today? No. doubt states quickly resolve distribution issues we’ll supply constraints within short weeks. 

The outstanding questions efficacy elderly, save Moderna/Pfizer everyone else gets AZ. Actually, according vaccine data released, one vaccine group got severe case: appeared cut 0. agree that’s rational reasonable explanation non-pandemic situation.

But since always exceptions curfew: work, doctors’ visits, etc., would vastly prefer see exception grocery shopping well.

A critical operation many households must engage puts people indoors strangers.

Making life easier police exchange virus cases seems off. patient type 2 diabetes history compromised immune system reinfected covid-19 variant started UK spread many countries including USA. really common adverse effects epinephrine, allergic reactions. Since epinephrine (adrenaline) naturally occurring body, it’s biologically possible anaphylactic response epinephrine itself. Definitely would consult medical provider explain this. thanks. Cant wait blamed everyone's vaccine working get vaccinated.


Muh herd immunity.  countries prioritizing elders beyond people actively treating COVID patients.

Am misreading this? earth good thing? probably wasn’t “no”. wasn’t to-do list. Ever.

Someone else pushed first 100M without noticing.  good -20c, use dry ice unpowered distribution. already portable coolers this. November last year, discovered one infected child — without symptoms — every three four classes examined.   

If taken face value, suggests children spreading school. Instead infected home, spreading classmates. spreading school, expect see clusters within classes. Cuz future planning really forte. I’m mistaken, OP sounding like coworker housemate made poor decision go somewhere Christmas gave OP COVID. could send vaccines ice testing drive thrus maybe, use existing infrastructure also Pfizer came statement warning believe science supported UK plan.

The release written lawyers, inside Food Drug Administration’s analyses Moderna Pfizer's vaccines pleasant discovery: single injection either two-dose vaccines appears provide strong protection coronavirus.

Plus course financial benefits. Pfizer also obliged supply Germany BioNtech supported state money early start. Germany decided order Pfizer enough ordered adult population. idea using multiple types vaccines good one supplies. Yes , people symptoms stay home. responsible people are, higher number be. goal 100% non-symptomatic.

The fact 50% getting virus people *know sick* crazy part. almost wonder much worse point would said “fuck testing” spend time resources money devoted things assumed everyone flu like symptoms corona. I’m sure would much worse would horrible idea, especially asymptomatics, doesn’t seem like people using positive info contact trace prevent spread much either since massive community spread basically everywhere never going get huge chunk get tested get vaccine muh freedom!  obesity really dangerous Regards covid? 6-7 times likely die?

That's releasing doses big deal specific vaccination location worry second dose available huge portion made available. really like baking recipe tell people put flour eggs bowl. lot companies work mRNA produce primers testing ""pivoting"" making vaccines difficult even tried true pharma corps.  don’t think you’re much risk, you’re fool. Covid causes long short term disability lot people otherwise thought low risk

Really? personally know dozen people gotten (including people 50 years older me) every single one completely fine. 

At certain point, listening things like you’re saying make people less inclined care literally see exact opposite eyes.  It'll get worse gets better. sure it. preparing 500 deaths day LA county come late January. bought one highest number doses per capita pending approval purchased eight different companies. We've received enough vaccinate around 1% population. work hospital probably able get vaccinated March enough give looks like Pfizer greatly prioritizing states vaccines distributing. IIRC doses Canada gets even coming states they're coming Belgium. That’s nuts back envelope calculation 50% die USA week covid. small island nation major businesses/airline hub quite helpful. Yeah, no. Gonna stop right there.

First, “common cold” caused one wide variety pathogens. longer-lasting effects. Many don’t. You’ll know everyone rhinorrhea didn’t develop crippling complications pneumonia.

COVID-19 is, already, one most-studied illnesses planet. studied extensively since—you guessed it—2019. comes family viruses cause respiratory illness (SARS). viruses also extensively studied.

The evidence several vaccines it. We’re entering year two monitoring cases survivors. fund data massive disease.

You gamble health want to, don’t downplay get people relax guard fucking pandemic. literally costs lives. Nobel Peace Price, Mr. Netanyahu. Omg hospital staffs family essential workers. joke? see sprinkling expertise COVID Reddit. fact know means, significance it, quite pathetic. no, im going explain you. Isn’t better vaccinate people early effects exponential growth stop deaths? old fucks deaths stop worst news possible. man actually antibodies nothing protect him.Second infection much worse first. Scary. They’re drive Florida. high school gym. fema tent. college. isn’t hard. thought Leicester City second It’s funny retroactively explain away failure guy administration. wait lethal thousands. 

Hundreds thousands. Want easy way get karma? Comment r/coronavirus “and it’s going get worse” I've wearing mask. fatigue. everybody want wear mask next decade anti-masker. Yeah, look comments try paint picture racial problem problem bad decision making. People make race even private citizens fucking minds, paid shills. I'm essential, work too. Like there's nothing stop that, since stimulus money ran three months... absolutely right way most. Someone ask Cuomo thing. mandated everyone follow extremely rigid distribution guidelines even make sense. entire shipments vaccine wasted hospitals threat million dollar fines loss medical licensing way instead vaccinating people quickly possible.  Entitled old war criminals get vaccine front many essential workers tax paying elderly. return state paid 100bed mansion hide pandemic whilst rest us deal it. Already preparing move goalposts wish clearer language reinfection general versus reinfection confirmed variant previous viral infection.

This would better indicate idiosyncratic patient differences versus population threats. Like fuck. got Moderna vaccine yesterday. general flu like symptoms injection site painful mostly untouchable day. I'll see feel wake up. Remember hoaxers claiming deaths previous years? neckbeard redditors like fact reclusion considered good thing. Oh wow wait, reddit convincing people Japan sooo responsible culture soooo great could never happen them... president enforced consistent ""tough logic"" policy. Neither browsing reddit less community spread is, faster go back guys call 'normal'. think that's uncontroversial.

No. virus there, vaccines, cannot go back normal spread. Masks stop it, slow it, slow less restrictions lifted. tagged NSFW lmao That's good, put perspective, 200 million doses would vaccinate 100 million people, less 1/3 US population, that's almost end summer (end July / beginning August), assume delivered doses immediately administered, practice see case.

To counterbalance that, Pfizer, vendors make numbers look better. battle starting. We're also expecting vaccine resistant strains emerge number vaccinated people raises. Gladys Bruz idiot fatigue watching assholes noses grocery store. moron fatigue watching dicks throw mask less parties social media. want meaningful coordinated national response.

Definitely feel that. story line would perfect cover Agent 47 understanding even considered horifically, unimaginably fast.

Normally even taking existing plant making produce another product that's already certified takes couple years, that's animal vaccines, human. France lots antivax already compared rest Europe I'm mistaken. think people need better informed covid vaccine though.

I keep hearing ""we know nothing test subjects"" part people say reject facts. people conspiracy theories believe pint lockdowns curfews sell vaccines. also feel like even suggesting get vaccinated live normal life ""taking away freedom"". lot people also compare flu vaccine (which popular considered ""useless"" yearly people still get sick) rather vaccines approve (mostly tetanus shot).

One minor issue we're sure long immunity last people claiming get vaccinated quarterly. think many people want vaccine feel enough people ""tested it"" (no matter silly sounds know already tested). never proven lol mongolia bhutan ones know reported low cases

What testing numbers? tests, get cases suspect greed money driving factor - life saving.

Big Pharma charity comminity service. business profit.

Prove wrong. They're talking pandemic. wear mask next decade like, want stop pandemic. 2 million cases far first confirmed reinfection. Even there’s unconfirmed still means it’s rare Update Israel vaccines - 

So far got first dose :

78% 90+ population

75% 80-89

81% 70-79

63% 60-69

34% 50-59

20% 40-49

11% 30-39

overall 19% population.

This week would mainly giving second dose, also starting later week education system employees would get first dose, also elderly people cant leave house (will get Moderna vaccine easier transport).

Meanwhile still experiencing high infections hospitalizations levels. Would take time see effect lockdown vaccines. Political microscope bias reporting. Lol multiple countries tried already gained pretty much nothing find surfaces significant vector, though possible. May likely infected person aerosolized Covid near trashcan second person acquired via aerosol, stick around hours. Got second dose yesterday. arm hurts chills muscle stiffness.

Against stronger exposure, chances infection higher, surgical mask still going beat mask.

Even N95 going perfect; situations known contact large viral loads need meticulous care handling derobing. makes minuscule amount US cases far. baked in. less community spread is, faster go back guys call 'normal'. think that's uncontroversial. 

Big mountains take long time climb long time go down. *Unless want plunge death, course...* Europe really well summer too. many variables play everyone chooses interpret data support beliefs.

How know Vietnam well primarily response climate that's worse virus? antivax? can’t honestly tell totally safe.

Not trusting science(many many articles nothing vaccine ""rushed"" top experts) vs personal gutt one key indicator anti-vax. 

You totally safe infected Covid-19. Nothing world ""totally safe"". Would rather roll dice everytime come contact someone disease kills/maims people permanently vaccine far 17m+ taken mostly issues? cases adverse reactions far millions. 0 deaths vaccine. 17 million infected covid means thousands dead many thousands maimed life.  

I know option I'll pick. Yeah well, right teenagers filling ICUs...

Were me, make vaccines available EVERYONE VISIBLE GRAY HAIR walk-in basis. questions asked besides asked roll sleeve shot.

I mean sound like care older folks, do. know older folks much greater risk (I'm 37, essential worker, disease like four months ago, sense taste fully came back last week). Coz didn’t credit operation warp speed.... Yeah, I'm waiting hammer fall here. feel gotta coming, eventually. I’d ok cessation hostilities :) select age bias? Like I'm thirty years old, 3.5% risk? countries managed beat it. Thailand 0 local transmission months. closed restaurants, bars entertainment venues, restricted movement provinces, temperature checking, hand disinfection contact tracing shopping centers stores, near 100% mask use, stuff like that. complete lockdown, people could still work go outside, effective enough control outbreak. control gradually opened kept contact tracing temperature screening. new outbreak illegal immigrants they're tightening again. every confidence beat like before. Pre-ordering selling eBay? seen think  Whats point giving old ppl spend time home anyways?

Because they're ones dying droves? fucking egocentric be? want act like mere existence event occurring means can’t make claim whatsoever, you’ll never able learn anything. 

Learning ""degree certainty"" definitely possible, without ""proven"" ""disproven"" anything, much higher bar meet also aren’t 100% confident vaccine works. 

Right, make give percentage confidence. tend precise keep conspiracy theories yourself. 

My comments contain zero ""conspiracy theories"". One consideration would whether camping trip raises chance accident requires hospital treatment. hospitals full covid really want go injury repair avoid it. family visited hospitals place outings may accident prone you.  ""capped"" get concept from. OP currently 76% stats believe capped that. Sadly Sweden issue. Even was, that's 1 many million. Willing roll dice risk. Willing roll dice weeks even though I'm not. tried already , incrementalism slow steady shuffle. Prepare away friend. prepare. disaster. It’s like year prepare various scenarios polices roll out. think flaw argument seeing 52/95% absolute.

52% immunity mean (in _very_ simplistic terms) 100 people exposed covid, 52 get it.

*But* fight body makes virus would very, different since full antibody arsenal. Again, simplistic fashion, fight may last days, may close, effects fight might catastrophic.

THAT might danger zone.

Imagine like boxing match (hear out).
You know _all_ weak spots virus (after second dose) know hit.
The match starts, knock 5 seconds.
You win.
The virus even get scratch clue went wrong.

Think scenario one dose.

The match starts, fight underway.. take couple blows, give back. close losing, bur definitely getting _some_ beating.
Ultimately win (one 52% ""lucky"" ones).

BUT - fight lasted hours.
Days.
Definitely end moment started.

Now Imagine one 48% virus actually _won_ (managed infect host start replication). virus managed managed go around, find weakness essentially _adapt_ vaccine's response. virus essentially started mutate.

Anybody infected new person mutated version. person infects 10people these, 2 people ""lose"" fictitious boxing match, deep, deep sh*t (without even considering mutations might get 2).

Welcome variant 3 (technically multiple, give proper acknowledgement mutation substantial). variant able fight body back vaccine, rendering obsolete.

The vaccine works virus know work around it, gets destroyed manages infect/replicate. 
_Everything_ must done avoid losing that.
This avoid it.

One last point. Think traditional vaccines work (not Pfizer) get weakened version virus, body starts learning it, fighting it, win.
Releasing ""part"" dosage essentially way round - releasing weaker vaccine - therefore giving virus time learn, fight it. Easy clueless. Dose anyone know read proof theory mass deaths marked COVID inflate numbers? -$$$ friend recently tested positive. also works outside home.

His wife also negative.

It’s laughable ask vaccines medics Israel vaccinated risk people. Ah, see thanks I’m laughing ass stupidity people website government STILL thinks they’ll able hold Olympics summer.  naive. ""So, statistically speaking, dying covid already beaten odds, already outlived least 50% peers (that's definition ""average""), would probability (you look actuary tables put actual number it) dead within year two anyway, ""

year two? i'll repeat, can't read actuarial chart correctly two reasons, live peers would fellow 75-85 year olds, consult chart see average lifespan would be.

i think interesting backpeddling vague numbers. technically deaths self inflicted inflicted someone else would natural causes, possible exception nuclear war. 

i'm going argue whether value human life decreases year like automobile computer, i'm pointing math shit, either intentionally unfamiliar charts intentionally trying deceive, either way doubt discussion get far.

Damn...was gonna ride motorcycle without helmet post vaccine. Keep mind Sweden it’s 5,6 percent year, people say terrible job. far fewer excess deaths Covid deaths. US, like many lockdown countries, opposite situation: excess deaths Covid deaths. majority excess deaths 45 demographic, includes majority Americans, Covid-related. thinking downplaying severity virus, increasing order would contradicted message. Imagine able stop WW2 wearing masks staying indoors bit usual. 

And that. Whatever Stanford. Maybe Scott Atlas help fact ""a"" death one 5 Million Americans vaccinated ""might"" caused vaccine rather good news, family. Headlines could flipped ""Only 1 person 5 Million...."". get wrong idea: downvoted entirely incorrect.  reading comments, asked self question: ""worth it"" vaccinate 104 y.o. person? end, needed following information:

- IFR age: took equation - note gets larger 1 around age 100, assumed 1 - probably enough data, seems fair game assume age, covid kills almost always. some

- life expectancy given age: last column table + article gather plateaus 1.5 years 105, put two data points 1.5 105 110 made simple polynomial fit that's quite nice

Then simply plotted two curves product - average years lost per infected person function age super-simplified model (which not, example, take account correlation life expectancy individual chance die covid, which, presume, quite high people already suffering diseases). 

The result - - frankly surprised me. expecting interplay rising falling curve create peak somewhere around 70-80 didn't, mortality rises fast decay life expectancy beat it. went exercise bias thinking show pointless vaccinate 104-old, data changed mind.

edit: better visualisation, plotting ""IFR/10 percent"" ""IFR*10"" - get gist - red curve 10 means everyone dies. Otherwise numbers fit well one plot. Jeez never realized people social. pretty sad. Boring able wear mask work distance all? typically japan 5-10% positivity, 20x tests result 20x cases. US population increase 15% 2019 2020? yes ""3 million"" 2020 100% expected deaths. increase deaths. year-to-year increase never high since hundred years. That's news. Reminds Hurricane Katrina FEMA trailers..... Trump probably doesn’t believe there’s 328 million Americans, probably isn’t aware many people exist, likely thinks numbers scam needs investigated 

That probably thought revolution going take hold ones didn’t vote would exterminated 

2020 weird 2020-1 turning pretty weird read actuarial life table perfectly well somehow misunderstood argument despite giving good summary. given age, many years expect live? 83, answer question ""not much"". That's I'm getting at; stop people dying covid likelihood die pretty soon natural causes?

I'd go far say covid *is* natural causes. 80, catch flu, get pneumonia, die, 80 frail. That's natural causes. Happens tens thousands elderly every year lose shit it. Probably going try extract money getting different vaccine companies bid US market award whoever gave largest cut. allowed shady friends relatives oversee distribution hoard price gouge, like PPE. Nah, dickheads do. Ah yes, individual freedom rolling lockdowns almost year now.

Do like Wuhan clear already fraction economic damage deaths.

See: China, Australia, New Zealand going history books. 2050 peoples jaw drop half million Americans died people prevent follow couple simple rules. Israel monopoly force. PA police para military deals everything aside terrorist cells, operate.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* comment Pfizer trying control costs atypical Pharma lines I’ve heard people I’m close Pfizer they’re hearing within company - really expecting make money this, might able break even. 

There’s really good writing Matt Levine Bloomberg makes sense major shareholders (i.e., owners Pfizer) tell company keep going regardless cost. idea institutions hold large shares Pfizer even shares rest economy (e.g., S&amp;P500). People kidding think cancelled. literally say regards “anything happen”, don’t know sounds like lack trust. likely new strain. People California different rest population. Florida 100% open One death tragedy. Hundreds thousands statistic.. there's difference lives ""serve God"" lives don't, world would persuaded join serve God, too? 

You would expect encounter infinite almighty, alpha omega, creator reality would transform one's actions change course one's life. see that. Believers suffer much non-believers - more, less, same. Believers evil bigoted non-believers (...or maybe more). Catholics particular committed unimaginable atrocities wide range groups, Muslims LGBT community young boys backgrounds. telling I'm supposed persuaded accept outlandish claims God reality lives look like everyone else's, worse? one developed China. basically developed it, phase trials, left phase 3 countries distributed to. got emergency user phase 3 almost complete, approval. higly effective Moderna Pfizer ones, 87% better 0. People can't self inject them. going that? interesting article, written doctor bioethicist one Joe Biden’s Covid advisors. Written pre-Covid times relevant ever. TL;DR old age care essentially extended suffering elderly made likely painful death extend period suffering.

He writes:

I take guidance Sir William Osler wrote classic turn-of-the-century medical textbook, Principles Practice Medicine: “Pneumonia may well called friend aged. Taken acute, short, often painful illness, old man escapes ‘cold gradations decay’ distressing Well, turns something people need vaccinated every year (like flu), could still helpful I’m saying data doesn’t matter right now. Since told vaccinate HCW.

And I've already explained logic make expect hospitals start walking around syringes stabbing people?

I expect complete vaccinations HCW quickly working day Friday saying it’s fault nurses taking weekends off. 

Of course is. say 3 million more... 

If somebody reads headline, makes totally new headline nothing real headline...

That's them, mislead themselves.    Poland. Gray sky, sleet, temps around zero, 7 hours sunlight day. borders around basically closed - wish lived Canada least much space move around (unless start closing provincial borders?). Okay and? Everybody's gotta die someday. whole point christianity embrace fact get ready supposedly comes it. There's point living forever Earth.  CCP highly concerned economy well. smart enough realize controlling virus quickly country open allow economy recover everyone. US willing sacrifice elderly poor make sure stock market propped wealthy stay wealthy. Sad true. would be. *Last us music starts playing* +1 you’re thinking like hacker 

Hackers bio terrorists exist. foolish pretend don’t NANI?! There's fungus among us... meant John Paul II. 2004ish? Maybe 2005? (I’m going based year dorm in). Sophomore college distinctly remember dream Pope dying.

I would completely unsurprised heard something well, registered consciously, fact expect probably case.

But knew back dream Pope dying Pope died, freaky me. take multivitamin work outside day. 
 
I've close contact several people infected (albeit always wearing mask). 
  
I gone anywhere indoors necessary. eaten indoors restaurant.  
 

I'm starting truly believe precautions work. bother any, trying help. Well suppose, I'm pharmacologist anything. suppose hard full scale assault covid worlds biotechnologists working it. Also, covid coronavirus something we're used dealing with. I'm sure used much research MERS SARS-COV SARS-COV2
Also, novel coronavirus studied Wuhan lab, likely trying develop vaccine treatment Covid case ever broke accidentally let out. think conspiratorial, human beings like develop medicine, don’t like dying much. pretty big prospect field biotech, group virologists, chemists, pharmacologists design new deadly virus lab, create vaccine case virus like ever breaks would world great service make lot money. There's nothing wrong that, screw like Wuhan let try cover public tell everyone came wet market... that's messed part. Anyway that's probably why, already know lot coronaviruses already researching COVID-19 broke out. hell upvoting bullshit? Vietnam War lasted 20 years, 9 months Canada ? inadvertently lucky chased solitude instead money, I'm 29º north. 15 nights freezing weather thus far, snow ice. still get afternoons. Life could lot worse, thankful. Mid Feb 5 weeks away. 

11.7M vaccinations do. 2.34M per week. 

But thats assuming full uptake 14th actually mean mid February 20th do. Okay I’m surprised mask less people still alive 10 months pandemic I'm....not sure 'ironic'. 

""Ironic, worked hospital ended dying one"" Yea understood wrong I'm sorry. Meh... EU plans doesn’t affect country (except maybe increase pressure us produce vaccines third world). feel free hold whatever doses have. Fighting Europe Pacific civilian casualties Americans 419,400 5 years (and 40% current population).

In contrast, Soviet Union 20 million deaths, Germany Poland around 7 million each, etc. 4 week incubation period !remindme 1 month   title seemed pretty straightforward I’m one person amongst billions. definitely wouldn’t call misleading title misleading must misread  agree that; can’t maintain 6 feet distance times wearing mask. post talking walk around quiet neighborhood. currently evidence people vaccinated spread virus. I’m saying data doesn’t matter right now. Since told vaccinate HCW. expect hospitals start walking around syringes stabbing people?

The hospitals open week. vaccinating HCW right workers voluntarily schedule show up. 

I’m arguing people aren’t getting many shots weekend. I’m saying it’s fault nurses taking weekends off. Nurses providers DON’T weekends. Every day gets coverage doesn’t matter bank closed hospital still coverage. 

Nurses hospital don’t weekends. Actually, scholars agree sentence ""In beginning God created heavens earth"" allows earth created six creative days, actually forming land, vegetation, ect. Thus leaving room theories Big Bang. Also based 2 Peter 3:8 Psalm 90:4, assume 6 ""creative days"" actually period spanning 6000 years. You’d surprised people would try point elitism. Even queen England phase 2 I’m pretty sure. lockdown? know pictures see 25-44 died, fat. sucky, panicky aunt myself.

Your argument ""science"" involved decision making process argued things *can* solved common sense solved common sense. two gallons gasoline *is* enough burn something, something wrong us still pour twohundred gallons it. Science great also product human common sense 👍 Totally agree understand correctly.   It’s pretty good example letting disease let rip population order pursue ‘natural’ herd immunity isn’t great idea. time open bottleneck, considering 30% NY's allocated doses used, &amp; taken entire month vaccinate 2.85% state population.

Granted, still slow, considering much time prepare distribution. Ah yes, America pharmacists decent amount medical training. understanding Europe they're primarily American would consider drug stores, think part differences medical / prescription law. comments contain zero ""conspiracy theories""

“Given nothing factual claim that” article presented claiming exactly 100% conspiracy theory. long term side effects get vaccines. Side effects develop rather quickly, within hours days. Facts don’t care feelings, buddy, notice didn’t actually say anything fact value judgement. negative value judgement coming you. It’s fault feel guilty you’re reminded material consequences economic-political system support. Sure fair amount young people ICUs. However, 45 demographic, includes majority Americans, majority excess deaths Covid deaths right now. yes Covid killing “young” people, attempt slow spread even deadly age group.

It also pretty deadly seniors well. number one cause excess death right now, according CDC, dementia, two times second leading cause excess deaths right now. affects mostly seniors. know one starved death due nursing home lockdown, statistic felt personally.

And isn’t sort thing given Covid. isn’t happening everywhere. Sweden example, far fewer excess deaths Covid deaths. blame anyone else getting tired reading comments along lines “I’m anti-vaxx all, *anti-vaxx nonsense coronavirus vaccines.*” It’s variant concern trolling. Yes, anti-vaxer, period. Dr. Fauci said vaccine safe, FDA said it’s safe, every bit wacky anti-vaxxers don’t believe it’s safe yes it’s harmful spread ideas around. Lol got em!

Although Article Ireland didn’t. advanced/well funded/well regarded healthcare system Japan? contracted symptoms 18 days first dose likely onset infection less 14 days following shot. vaccine culmination alot research going years, I'm really excited can't wait get it. feel possiblity unknown risks low. people forget covid dont know long term consequences getting it. Someone posted reddit awhile back ""We learn link HPV cervical throat cancers late 1980s.

Thanks best can. point doctor scientists ever said immunity SARS-CoV-2 would life-long. variant. Yes people freak downvote call names say it: yes catch coronavirus twice. It’s scientifically proven.

Luckily data shows immunity lasts long time 8-24 months like mentioned means vast majority people healthy immune systems might able end community spread people lose temporary immunity virus.

Luckily, states starting learn this. read whole article? guy Biden’s Covid advisory team. don’t think falls umbrella fascist. doctor. think take carry fair amount weight. believe trust experts, ones agree with. That’s true right now, cases California skyrocketing compared states. Deaths follow downplay COVID deaths? 

The IFR COVID _is_ relatively low, still kill lot people. disagree. I'm saying better safe sorry. likely get it, I'm getting mRNA one, purely I'm wary fact first time technology rolled humans _may_ long term effects line could take show up. better cautious go along it? works imo almost problem all. It’s 95% effective. Fuck ‘em think way measure excess death percentages. way covers Covid deaths results measures try slow spread.

Also different places different ways counting Covid deaths.

Based excess deaths, really trend see.  Why? Can't delay circumstances? Imagine will, instead India, north korea.

(Doesn't really matter country actually is, want see kind scenario ridiculous demands made now, would you?) Long term side effects vaccines rare say anyone mentions gaslighting antivaxxer. look objectively logical conclusion I’m sure China’s data skewed, say US. literally scientist arrested trying release accurate info. big difference US China China play around enforcing rules.

I'm allowed take NSAIDs. examples long list. 

Nope. Pfizer admitted test people prone rare often severe reactions. So, would take risk untested vaccine risk group? I'm going parties hanging people outside home. person gets vaccine might still able spread virus. still know doctor died suffered severe lack blood clotting immune system reacted vaccine not. I'm anti-vaxx. see risk worth specific, unique situation. research conducted people risk category, I'll reconsider.

Edited fix typo clarify. WA told they'd hope ""phase 4"" (i.e. new normal) last July. still phase 2

Maryland here. absolutely marketed ""two weeks lockdown back normal"". thankful things happening instead dying. I’d take broke sad dead!

here, dropped /s remember telling started would year 18 months telling gtfo doom gloom.

I mean, going listen to? rando government saying ""back normal summer""? enemy enemy friend... ? listen!!!  Yep, agree federal support would nice, NY ability borrow raise taxes, months get done. 

We talking roughly $50 per resident. Many states take 2-3000 dollars per resident taxes per year. think residents would okay 1-2% tax hike 1-2% cut services meant vaccine roll went way better.

It's also shortsighted increase tax revenue associated getting back normal paid months. likely could even increase taxes cut services. Let’s shut entire state 3 weeks close borders.  Hmm. Sister law chemotherapy cancelled brain cancer, age 39. also point technically astute use home shopping venture out. also think they're pockets oaps defiant ""I've lived hide virus"" etc. Wait people think forgo masks restrictions they're vaccinated. think it. looks like yes? I'm you. Got flu shots last year, anti-vax I'm hesitant right due newness mRNA vaccine (even though amazing leap health tech goes well). I'll probably end eventually getting vaccine I'm healthy, 20s, health conditions. I'm advocating grandparents parents get since theyre late 50s-early 80s.

I'm sure, since several made way RN APRN, seem like education issue indoctrination. People know things believe others. I've come understand, belief part important governing thoughts, feelings, actions. anyone know sent mass vaccination centres? know they're planning do...well, 'mass' people surely people sent GPs, go centres? elderly parents get sent centre instead would theoretically go public transport risky. media wants clicks that's something new. hope right. Although fear opposite. exposure misinformation gets, confused people, may busy deeply investigate, may get. 

There theory someone exposed something, like it. nutjobs got wanted. actually needed real, proper lockdown February.

Ah yes real proper lockdown Italy had. rest Europe slightly later. hey, real proper lockdown China had, basically ended spread oh wait virus back China now. even though expert opinion clearly shifted theory

This blatantly incorrect. argue position, means consensus even majoritarian position.

Please stop spreading misinformation sub. Modern medicine seem matter hospitals around country full capacity patients triaged. insanely rare. 1/30,000 per year. common cause thrombocytopenia. We've vaccinated like 7 million people USA. blaming mutations anti-maskers? Mutations going happen regardless. No. guessing 85% us population lives cities number cities 50-100 metro areas. 

Strategy shutgun cities dart counties/rural areas small clinics.  Usually nasal saline’s set isotonic fluid tissue nose. really shouldn’t cause issue ""Liberal"" means something different outside American English

I mean liberal used ""libertarian"", used ""classical liberal"".

The word changed time. athletes died yet? Hey I’m gay, 20cm 20cm! wouldn’t surprise there’s already level herd immunity there. 92K confirmed infections population 760K. Assuming undercount cases 3x could hovering close around 50% - quite herd immunity level enough start cutting spread quite bit. 

That said, North Dakota really really rough weeks/months get definitely don’t think natural herd immunity way go. suppose Brexit bring one good thing, easier put restrictions travel EU UK.

In US, contact tracing limited nonexistent well. also skeptical part three consider diverting doses Covid-19 vaccines region large clusters cases whole-community vaccination.

The US shown ability vaccinate high scale. disrespectful study nursing school? learn vaccines work? also believe insulin drugs? agreed. make judgements vaccine based many healthcare workers take vaccine. straight nutty.

Meanwhile people repeat ad nauseum ""listen healthcare workers! listen know they're talking about!"" something comes healthcare workers saying ""please stay home please wear mask"". Well, always talked way reduce human population think solution mind. Canada literally country world this. leaders every country xenophobes too? xenophobia even explain this? fact xenophobe would exactly opposite motivation. still good news? Sorry, realise Montreal Gazette peer reviewed.

..and residents aged care homes die account zero access vaccine... tough luck! 
Will scientific Gazette report too? Nan enjoyed one way holiday Switzerland/Dignitas. even upgraded business. Tell don’t care Grandparents?!

I give shit them. exactly shouldn’t leaving house. personally would never put livelihoods later generations ahead “right” go supermarket. wonder many confirmed cases Europe has. Asia. Super Bowl parties hospital-overwhelming scenario, COVID still less deadly Spanish flu, especially comes life expectancy. hospitalization fatality rate Spanish flu incredibly high young people. COVID mainly affects elderly. Well go every business! 80% actually low, need 95% prevent spread. also, estimates. I'm telling I've seen city NJ, literally daily thing see someone without mask inside store. I've reporting year, though, I've warned stores dozens times already. even argued manager grocery store wore mask, seeing 4 customers walking around without masks mask nose something like that. said medical exemption gets tested every 3 days. Insanity 

ABSTRACT:

Background: sudden onset COVID-19 began late 2019 caused novel coronavirus (SARS-COV2) 11th March, declared developed pandemic status. still specific treatment vaccine available COVID-19; causing wide spread health problem concern globe. Povidone iodine (PVP-I) antiseptic used 150 years. already proved different concentration PVP-I deactivate COVID-19 virus. Methodology: randomized controlled clinical trial, 1113 patients 606 patients enrolled divided 2 groups randomization taken consents. Gr-A, 303 patients underwent mouthwash/gargle, nasal drops eye drops 1% povidone iodine 4 hourly 4 weeks well symptomatic treatment according need. Gr-B 303 patients advised mouthwash/gargle, nasal cavity eye wash lukewarm water 4 hourly 4 weeks symptomatic treatment according need. RT-PCR test done every 3rd, 5th 7th day Thyroid hormone level (TSH,T3, T4 FT4) 4th week follow up. Results: group patients used 1% PVP-I shown tremendously reduced mortality, morbidity hospital well financial burden covid situation. Conclusion: Administration 1% PVP-I mouthwash/gargle, nasal eye drop simple, rapid cost effective reduction mortality morbidity COVID-19. Simple enough,
You choosing average life span someone born vs people already old. life expectancy someone 1 someone 90. clear person 90 already past newborn's lube expectancy.

Take living 80 year olds average much longer live, get bit less 10 years. North Dakota surprisingly young population due oil boom well affordable university system brings lots students state. probably also helps. Also big detail headline bother touching on. LIFE EXPECTANCY WENT UP. Life expectancy actually dropped slightly 2010s first time decades nobody seemed care. goes up, actually tragedy deadliest year ever. Says conspiracy theorist. like side effects vaccines mean vaccine working, aren’t viewing side effects lockdowns sign lockdowns working?

If people losing jobs depressed, may bad, thankful things happening instead dying. I’d take broke sad dead! advances healthcare really matter triage place, ICUs capacity, supplies limited, staff strained? Yes, please read Immune Escape paragraph 2 4? - Andy

YUP - Pam suggest getting new doctor. not? guess I'll first say thank god good news...because apparently people would rather find sliver bad news every goddamn post Exactly, many actuarial tables show life expectancy age one social security administration's website. Men age 80 live bit 8 years, women 10 years.  “I knew thing going last two years back December 2019 telling family. weren’t listening though” workers scientists

The vast majority people scientists. Healthcare workers certainly educated microbiology rest population. even trust vaccine enough get it, expect convince everyone else? go without saying everyone world included that. Thanks informative. still don’t want vaccine thanks educating Debatable. actually deadly pandemic, convince people stay home. They'd it. Sweden. It’s absolute, unbridled, short-sighted panic, “idiots” really concern ones begging enslaved exchange illusion safety. Every cloud silver lining??? knowing attitude tiring what? need wait 20 years see? really bad stuff happens 25 years road? \- book anything unless essential 75+ I'd push everyone back 4 years. Paris 28, LA 32 say international travel? economy many places rely heavily tourism. International travel open summer 2020 don’t know wouldn’t open summer 2021. got moderna. Arm feels like got punched hard I've fatigued 2 days nothing serious. sure worth it. It’s Coca Cola gets harm, it’s Olympics broadcasting companies sell less ads. nothing words. one listening anything say Vaccinations, cases, deaths determine things.   Well honest true almost everywhere, current groups getting vaccinated health care workers elderly general public really radar yet. LOLOLOL. Meaningless law. Cases double
33 69 testing 13 million people Hebei region. Lmao think athletes train, LA Fitness? They’ve training private whole time. great job updating I've recorded past 4 days.

1/7 - 5.48 million doses administered 
1/8 - 6.25 million (increase 770,000) 
1/9 - 7.05 million (increase 800,000) 
1/10 - 8.02 million (increase 970,000)

These numbers look great right now, many states (NY, PA, GA, etc.) adding older people getting vaccine (starting tomorrow), expect see even bigger jump - hopefully 1.5 million day end week. And, new administration opens doses. People know place. seem weirdly happy fact world nearly ending way we'll back normal years. Others think 2021 already lost. personally think we'll see pretty positive news within 3-4 weeks 3-4 months lot positive.   x 100. #1 vaccinations fast possible. 0. think Oxford vaccine 90% effective right dosing regimen? - Money!

Doubt going want delay profits longer already Can't agree you. 

They never said flu. 

Returning elderly patients denied. probably happened policy. 

They removed restrictions exactly once. 

Schools seem lagging overall curve. hard know sure, especially primary schools. 

I agree vaccination program getting slow start. blame end year holiday days taken up, year like 2020, blame them. allowed emphasize, still go back normal. Nah, best ask Reddit mostly 20 year old Americans. First need look Septoplatsy I'll give informed opinion Hospital Baden Baden safe. None vaccines approved Japan yet. fucking Olympics half reason invest much money hosting country fans. Even multiply death rate Japan 10 times, still 0.95 times Germany's death rate. There's surely way Japanese government could undercounting 10 times, even lack testing. blame media thrives fear. 

Most people talk still know surface transmission uncommon.  compare last Sunday? key indicator. Thank Thank you. thought reactogenic vaccine works waking immune system preparing fight infection future, symptoms sign vaccine working? New Yorker here: Use sign link posted u/yeash95 make reservations/schedule shots. I'm pretty sure wait Monday though. like people say „I’m racist, but.... SAY RACIST SHIT“. 

You anti-vaxer full shit.

No, vaccine super new, working SARS vaccine 20 years. 
It’s rushed marked, Covid isn’t completely new, similar diseases already studied 20 years. 

And one sub going first. Hundreds thousands vaccines studies. reason delay Olympics Japan four years

It easiest, obvious, practical solution completely doable

Ridiculous even implemented solution yet ""Anti-vaxx"" implies someone extremely opposed vaccines, thinks harmful health establishment conspiracy etc.

This different someone otherwise takes vaccines cautious Covid vaccine new created new technology.

I opposed vaccines understand someone would worried new vaccine. historical accounts vaccines unintended side effects people generally freak new technology anything new. US? get vaccine next several months (I'm assuming also young healthy). eight months.

Not mention really huge concern killing grandma grandmas vaccinated?

(side note, always killing grandma grandpa, considering fatality rate higher men?) accelerated PA program 5 years, standard 6. BS undergrad 2-3 year certification program. Many PAs majored molecular bio, pre-med, etc. going PA program. People health care know intuitively conflict interest organizations deliver health care. experience first hand. One option won't. Another option selectively. look trends graphs, hospitalizations fatalities rising nearly fast cases. Essentially cases found serious. bunch theories this, one testing less severe cases among younger people found, also treatments getting call doctor hospital find out? better info us. Also us use technology amenities home shelter place contribute spread choice. luxury now, probably used back 1918. also data communications quickly target hotspots see share restrictions really help control spread, leaders may choose leverage. mention news outlets made everything overly skewed politically. remember reading article two weeks general election said ""A COVID vaccine end year impossible, matter Tr*mp says"" course, three weeks later, Pfizer data comes out. prolong suffering feel bad wanting things better. need positivity, especially lost lot year. Living depressing, sad world help anyone. pandemic raging 1918? Los Angeles people continue get together private homes. one listening anything government says ship normal ventilation system terrible choice plague. Even dedicate ""other"" conditions, rona get spread. long telling us still need mask SD get vaccine, sounds like personal decision me.  going police that? Rolling vaccine ""proper"" review EMA Agree take. I'm guessing lot news outlets seen huge traffic increases related pandemic, partly interest extend pandemic. scheduled Septoplasty Friday hospital (in Germany). risky this? postpone operation? right. US big country, need good. country vaccinated 0,45% population yet :( Im saying rushed. I’m saying right now- long term effects known. still think need vaccinate 10-15% population make big difference. 80% fatalities 12-15% population. Old people still contribute overall economy even labor productivity, consumer spending, investments, tax revenues degree younger social stratas.

Doesn't fucking matter. still economic presence, that, moral obligation society pay back elderly public goods social welfare return history prior service laborers previous decades built economy inherited.

Even cranky dumb crusty boomers know whats good them, still need taken care think pretty soon. places Caribbean open tourists isolate show negative test. vaccination would even better would surprise they'd let valid vaccination card. Thank information! first highly skeptical vaccine, heard different arguments reliable sources, think may want receive it, snag I'm quite afraid possible side-effects.

I'm scientist obviously, come seek advice, that's it. I've heard sources might long-term side-effects, quite concerning. Although researchers monitored volunteers tests carried out, still can't really foresee long-term side-effect, year.

As see, I'm trying smooth reply much possible, since want become target torrent abuse expressed personal doubts. definitely bad reporting. absolutely lack urgency planning around getting doses arms. upset it. need better. totally agree common sense actually common health crisis would whole lot easier deal many aspects :) ...Common sense seem efficient human species somebody intelligent comes good home test type example make something factual extremely obvious people intelligent themselves. seems national division time high many places pandemic happened break out.

Dox yourself? LOL. also claimed worked CDC 2008 time large amount student debt. Sounds like you’re full shit spent along time pretending somebody you’re not. Pathetic. hate old people. Got it. way higher UK, Italy Russia, yeah least par Spain Poland engage home workouts. I've picked small amounts gear along way. limited get variety reasons, including places keep it. also engage cardio park.

Is functional, working home? Yes. optimal? Far it. enable meet long-term fitness goals? Unless obtain gear space want, (again, right impossible number reasons) definitely no.

And quite frankly, people go gyms regularly ones least risk COVID. reason continue keep people locked away. Mid March likely rate Yes band continues play ( calming panicked passengers) ship sinks sea. mean ""unrestricted travel""? Could definitely see world proof vaccine travel internationally next year. That's unrestricted, also ability travel internationally without quarantine.  reason that? agree I'm trying empathize people lost everything vs. whose lives much affected. huge news? talking changing next currently lives Read second sentence. Fuck giant corporations

Want another bailout even multiple bailout packages 2007-08 financial crisis? Fuck you

Should've saved cash rainy day stupid greedy motherfuckers, go pull bootstraps rugged individualism

Giant corporations need systematically regulated dismantled big fail anti-trust statutes 

This broken ass political economy Right? anti-vax non pretending anti-vax appalling. Lmao people worried long term covid vaccine given 17m+ people far handful bad cases scarier Covid-19? 

I'm glad someone made article im anti-vax but...most reasons illogical. can't reason logic. bet get downvote reponse. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* true once. sure putting something new body obligation take it. think acceptable, honest. welcome stay home believe want, people hold beliefs like that, delays herd immunity harms rest us complying restrictions also want go back normal. anything, virus shown infect cells gut. Don’t feel guilty don’t let anybody feel guilty. people worse doesn’t mean feelings wants invalid. probably states reporting numbers, right? we’re going small sample size, know 3 people age got Covid...the worst symptom took nap Friday work (they work home never nap).

Taking nap work seems preferable taking hour day, twice, get shot...

This don’t use small sample sizes, argument absurd due sample size...  understand idea subsidizing people stay home, proposals issues. First, government subsidizing Netflix directly good idea, government picking winners losers private sector like anti-competitive players (if instead say state governments give $20 cash card anyone downloads app, that's better). there's amount government oversight talking about. need robust contact tracing sure, idea ""ticketing"" COVID restrictions getting police state level. Yep. Moderna something similar JNJ see similar numbers. small populations quickly overrun. Dakotas enjoying benefit natural herd immunity since end November. Actually, understanding vaccine spike protein shell virus let's infect us easily. virus mutates around vaccine, literally mutate effectiveness us, negating need vaccine first place. lucky get vaccine year Europe. rollout sucks donkey balls here. Happy see this.

Lots people (especially thread Biden proposal) confusing risks Biden plan UK plan. Biden staying recommended second dose timeframe, allocating vaccines second doses people's second doses due.  UK prioritizing giving everyone possible first dose even second doses priority \~12 weeks.

That's much different level risk taken on. Biden's plan, still occasionally big groups people whose second dose delayed couple weeks, they'll get prioritized second doses follow-on supplies.

The science really support idea getting second dose week two later risky. Yes, study 21 day protocol, magic number - compliance 100%, people can't make appointment sometimes, short grace period, importantly underlying science predict immune response would sensitive 2-week delay - delay which, clear, would happen there's supply snafu first second dose, people.  able vaccinate quickly right epidemic exploding seems well worth risk. Gottlieb, former FDA commissioner Pfizer board member, spoke supporting holding back second doses. NYT reporting December rollout Pfizer executives scientists background saying surprised confused Operation Warp Speed saving second doses.

By contrast, idea would delay second dose three months, like UK doin, much radical step open questions efficacy would affected. also Pfizer came statement warning believe science supported UK plan. would first come first served help that? think old people gonna able stay long lines register fastest online? 

We need switch 100% age based. Start high keep lowering vaccine becomes available.  There's long term safety data. pretty valid concern. front line worker, I'd take vaccine personally since COVID higher risk. However, long term data yet. Well incident , US gave thorough whipping narrative shifted. 

Eitherway US US media sets narrative however want be, always way .

'The white man always spoken forked tongue. Always always will.' - american indian saying.

If anyone wants truly understand America, need understand story black americans american indians. he’s prototypical doomer absolutely nothing positive say incredibly pedantic company *makes* vaccine, BioNTech, says things go back normal next winter. I'm doomsdayer, I'm realist. listen experts say. nice unbridled optimism change reality.

This opinion. experts saying. Sorry, rename title? started vaccinating Texas week rollout complete cluster, made worse states push vaccinate phase 1A 1B time. I’m sorry older individuals chilling home need chill couple weeks hundreds thousands front line health care workers Texas get vaccinated. sub worst? would like strongly disagree.  Oh, case, wonderful see politician stick principles right thing. 2000 people aged 25-34 died COVID US, know 2 them. That’s pretty remarkable. fringe know 3 people contracted age group. Let guess. everything right perfect health, forced go work contracted it. Yeah, happened him? line. refused skip queue   It’s also relying self-reported symptoms. going people reporting symptoms either psychosomatic symptoms symptoms related health conditions.  mixing US UK, one. No, N501Y. I'm exhausted constantly trying fact check research everything, thus wanted community's perspective.

This report reasonably well written cites peer reviewed literature, however bias definitely there. 

Some groups trying use report justify ending mask wearing lockdowns, well forward ""it's scam"" ""they're takng freedom"" notions. really happy this. told mom, strong catholic, said definitely getting now. always planned get little hesitant now. Drive centers work covid testing many area already figured it. Many already appointment only, well. Adapt system far. last article bad article topic focuses N protein based immunity doesn’t provide direct correlation protein based immunity induced vaccine. exact thing said US, objectively far truer.

The true propaganda people like ignorant effective US soft media power (i.e. propaganda) truly is.

Your statement would made someone like Murdoch cream pants put tear Goebbals eyes. know unrealistic plague inc is. game, vaccine developed 7 billion people 10 minutes many lives save freeing hospital facilities? author history Publishing „articles“ poor quality:

„In April 2020, former professor Denis Rancourt posted (on research gate) short article claimed proved “there known benefit arising wearing mask viral respiratory illness epidemic.” removed research gate, presumably poor quality fact spread misinformation. complete explanation every mistake argument makes, also (and know) masks work help prevent spread Thats almost impossible enforce. comes personal responsibility ive seen disgusting lack According Reddit, billionaires bad, monarchs cool  i'm glad remaining members Queen given vaccine priority.

r/titlegore would much helpful article could identify individual suddenly died.

Doesn't require consent? so, article helpful be. physics professor political bias, terminated university, speaking domain outside watching crown documentary netflix, diasgree. rep bad US scrutinizes demonizes everything . 

There ongoing soft power disinformation war China (similar tried soviet russia), America's largest competitor, country number 1 except US else tar feathered , outright shot lynched -- american way. good moral practical reasons protect leaders disproportionate risk face occupying office. However, think clear ""ought"" case virus, know age age position so, would offer vaccination. Spent day giving vaccine out. group 1400 doses! Biggest takeaway: NEED SWITCH FIRST COME FIRST SERVE

I’m happy give vaccine whoever sits station, young medical receptionist I’m vaccinating talks 80 year old relatives expecting MARCH... I’m filled rage many people system killing  clarified denominator, thank you. 50% holdback mentioned 100% second doses. 10% second doses (5% holdback) would interesting. 50% mentioned would 25% doses (50% * 50%.) anyone know LA County's CFR is? need this? know immortal. Watch this: Victoria (Australia) able achieve elimination (covid 0) open grocery stores. main thing 100% mask usage one person per household, reduce shopping much possible. would argue one person per household even important mask usage, necessary. Also curfew, leave house anything non essential excercise, visit 5km radius house etc. many at? Germany Federal Health Minister said we're looking sometime much later year meaningful number people fully vaccinated, time we're getting record numbers infections dead people.

Germans already run patience lack travel, let's get they're willing take vaccine. We're exactly short dosages, distribution system sucks, yes I'm suggestine 24/7 locations like stadiums anyone wants first shot get it. 

I'll go spreading first shot vaccine best can. working Israel. “Skeptics” live different reality. don’t use evidence, else wouldn’t skeptics. 

More evidence isn’t going change this. 

The thing ignore them. think people California aren’t wearing masks, I’m saying wouldn’t help it’s 50% effective. state like California suffering worst virus, Covid non-supporters would’ve thought would affecting state more. guess fuck someone Covid positive get virus even sexually transmittable cares? Europe - regions (focal point harsh survivor two world wars) - knows better play ideology , politics military countries way US past 30 years.

It's sign even EU economically abandoning US led western trade bloc US. 

The US decline , Europeans know it, americans still chest puffed. still supported Australia that's pretty much it. global shift.

Don't blame China though, blame Trump. Everytime US fucked , every day Trump admin denied COVID , every missles , bullet bomb US dropped, China pick slack producing another iPhone, building another railway. Breaking news mean important, shocking.  Thanks Yucko! international pilot is.

Having explain ignored public health requirements going look good visa application anyone else barely wait new update corona vaccines?? I’m pretty buzzed hypes lol Start giving age 65 plus people priority, even means skipping health care workers It’s dreamy existence acceptance love neighbors. economy thriving one person works family gov pays 900 week. kids computer genius don’t even fear pandemics dont care die me, would rather protect around long possible. meant generation effecting look past effecting see outcomes worse.

I really find hard wrap head around people wish death upon vunerable elderly easily due mental health completely separate issue treated use lockdown excuse.  Vaccine engineered make produce shitload antibodies. cells produce many protein spokes mRNA vaccine could never Sars-CoV2 still alive afterwards. immunity vaccine least considered stronger, though many things get sure of. 

COVID may also affect immune system indirectly negative way vaccine Canadian ethics...  know mean know happen way. 

But places like orange county give fuck covid. Makes fucking sense me. mainly beach cities south county. richer areas OC. 

I wear mask walk dogs. wear mask go see friends family (which super rare now) wear mask allllll damn time. hand sanitizer table front door, doors car. 

Covid joke. think state tried best got federal help. money give help small businesses. think Gavin fucking tool going party long ago feel he's done well given challenges state faced getting help federal level. I'm gonna enjoy watching people say death rate Coronavirus worth considering also point handful deaths may resulted vaccine lack proof vaccine taken. mini heart attack still health care workers states? skip start giving 65+ age people 9000 appointments available booked within first 2-3 minutes. hope able get vaccine soon people really need get it. There’s many reasons wouldn’t work, I’ll give obvious one. 

If every person LA tried buy enough groceries for... what? 2 weeks? span two days Every grocery store would groceries long everyone food. 

And you’re fucked. 

What *can* happen, prohibition leaving house purpose isn’t one small number designated activities, closing businesses aren’t deemed essential, tight definition essential effectively removes non-staple retail, form rec, non-essential medical non-medical service, etc) closing public spaces, beaches parks large fine heavily enforced anyone caught public isn’t explicitly one allowed activities. 

That’s doable. many places done it. takes government extremely unpopular cases start turning shown working. Yeah! Per recent update state (New York), vaccination rate practically quintupled. used ~10,000 per day, ~50,000.

That said, apparently there's supply problem federal government right (of course), might stall little bit rate transition power. first thing said we'll protected years, disagree that. get tested regularly sub horrible sometimes. Someone earlier replied comment saying “It’s year”

Like mate I’m 14, 1 year lot time me. us want over. depends. Even healthy people 50 get severe infections helping ICUs, many people also getting Long-Covid debilitating time. I'm sure current stats significant risk. cases start going back down/when get vaccine things start calming down.

Once hospitalizations start going way down, matter much many cases are. think cold storage requires specific distribution.

There companies making vaccines held normal fridge, maybe roll different fashion. Options though, 2022/2023? aunt vent month survived. back home. Still ways go getting better every day. 

Just saying give hope. But... trump bought 200 million reserved 200 million more, mention millions doses ordered vaccine providers. sure getting numbers timeline next 100M one pretty bad, like 2022 AFAIK. damn bro, sure got Really feels like time critcal mass people get current vaccines new escaping virus everywhere, awesome Nice!  many new variants (UK/SA etc). Sometimes new variant sneaks past immune system police standing around, much anything, collecting over-time.

I’ll give week lockdown defunded functionally pointless. need another thing slowing administration.

Because 1/100k risks, already slowing vaccinations, Alaska booking 30 minute appointment slots 3 second procedure drama.

Figure priorities, start jabbing people. Trump said Literally why???

I mean, seeing he's right head, ""why"".

It's like asking Joker (from Batman) killed bunch people. he's crazy, that's why. dense. Asymptomatic spread people largely found testing vaccine passed phase 3 trials (covaxin) done help? fuck cares man Vaccines typically even better natural infection obesity prevalence? already got Covid.  main reminder pandemic city Australia police escorted pandemic buses taking people hotels, post notes windows counting days.

We've able hold far (last community case April), fear B117 variant + rising incidence cases worldwide Australia roughly half number arrivals take in, requiring negative tests boarding flight home. rough many abroad, good millions home. one salty Canadians it, get ours, donate others countries can't afford it. That’s what’s called herd immunity, everyone either antibodies longer contagious, don’t antibodies extremely slim chances contracting others contagious longer Nobody bold enough mention pragmatic choice...

In wartime combat triage, space limited, resources limited patient absolutely zero chance recovering...the humane thing order clear space patients minimize suffering unfortunate patient make euthanize them.

Since doubt hospital, politician, family member would approve this, 2nd best choice send home families die peacefully.

If that's possibility, sending tent outside hospital relatively comfortable recommended.

The worst possible choice send nursing homes infect others. kind stuff Boomers do? normal. Speaking general, vaccines (regardless disease), 3 ways happens.

1) viruses kind immune dampening effect. Even virus isn’t acting directly immune system, get infected cells start dying parts immune system go overdrive activates parts slow (so immune system doesn’t escalate control kill you).  vaccine doesn’t problem, immune system works smoothly, leading better results.

2) completely opposite end problem, asymptomatic infection body think it’s big deal create/store many antibodies all.  many vaccines include adjuvant (thing designed wave red flag immune system) make sure body sees danger, get stronger/longer-lasting result might get mild disease.

3) Many vaccines booster second shot. alerts immune system isn’t once-off exposure, increases chance memory B cells stored long term.  Even un-vaccinated, nurse highly unlikely catch third time (unless undiagnosed immune issue).  2 dose vaccine.  2 exposures (however obtained) protective 1.  never hear people think natural infection way go planning catch something twice give protection!  Thanks!  know risk individuals get thier? LOL delusional. dying ayhahaha work child protection cover transport kiddo visits parents. second infection B.1.1.7 variant?  Note: Quebec highest cutoff CT Canada 40. 

Sure coincidence nothing case counts though. unemployed summer. sat rear end home watched Netflix went back work October. went work came home every day went pick curbside grocery order. wore mask washed hands dry raw. everything right. still ended COVID one person made poor decision Christmas. standard nihilism, caused standard relativism, try I'm told makes others feel better carry #keepOnTrucken easily. Pfizer vaccine requires long-term storage -70C apparently limiting number delivery trips ensure vaccine damaged. stored dry ice 30 days, dry ice replaced every 5 days. need second dose 3-4 weeks later, keep track ensure second dose available. Details particular vaccine higher rate anaphylactic shock vaccines, want medical professionals epi pens ready case. 

It's horrible idea, though. asked ER doc whether could taught administer shots said, ""easily - watch one, one, teach one."" know plenty nurses quit didn’t want get sick kill loved ones. know teachers same. don’t think there’s anything wrong whatsoever. 

Again, it’s job. anyone feels unsafe job absolutely leave can. always get another. can’t replace loved ones health thought distancing mid-late fall depressing us living cold climates. We're pretty much asked stay indoors apart April/May 2022 winter cold miserable. Losing normality late summer/early fall 2019 spring/summer 2022. Damn. Next need get rid pandemic getting people married!  Coumo literally said like yesterday going sue hospital giving many vaccines, talking high mighty hes opening vaccinations first responders people 75 older. 

Then article thats talking like anything different originally planned, dosages time frame, apparently benevolent biden reason it. health system break? logic senior citizens either vaccinated forced something right?

No HCW getting vaccine quitting job, would waste college time/money. want argue need HCW give vaccines would suggest allow premed student 2+ years experience volunteer deduct would paid student debt.  one told us virus!!!! understanding three week wait initial booster shots minimum, longer times much issue, though likely sweet spot.

Also, reason three-four week window may we're trying get many people full immunity second shot soon man monstrously immoral. People keep trying make sense abyss, they're fooling thinking there's anything analyze. There's nothing oblivion. much would love shit Trump didnt know vaccines would available fastest diversified dosage ordering across several candidates. Pfizer, moderna, J&amp;J, AstraZeneca, several ordered already enough cover us population 1.7 times amount ordered. Sure hindsight may look bad cant order infinite doses. God bless saving them.

Everyone acting covid. school district city live still open students, parents actually fought stay open. watch happens someone brings wiping sitting vs standing Hope gets better soon Aka literally nothings changed, original contract 200 mil july 31st work hospital we're trying get thing fast. worth vet every single hospital employee country, send them? administrative employees getting vaccines taking away family. buy all...and give away.?..  im sure countries would appreciate watching us buy doses knowing would disperse all...... USA vaccinated around 700,000 people today,

That's interesting. today Saturday, usually weekends, vaccination slows down. City site make vaccination appointment - Pfizer later said saved us

That’s hilarious, Pfizer basically knew bad decision said “yeah you’ll probably regret decision, we’ll wait adult ask” Yes. Trump administration interest logistics. headlines. known. He’s almost gone. soon administration interested details. Oh shit. Idgaf whys hows, antivaxxers, shit excluded means half country able vaccinated end summer right? I'm fucking excited. cant wait get with. reality see things way around, humanity failing much yet nothing gives, even climate change, luck know is. might helped, California covid cases declining early September, started go late October schools mostly closed.

I find hard blame schools California outbreak. fun fact. None COVID vaccines FDA approval

Rather, emergency authorization given. makes sense Multiply 10 so? goal minimize loss life prioritizing would able infect others (ie hospital staff) work better lottery system. Also ppl likely die too. example, I'd hope folks Pfizer vaccinated keep working full capacity. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Actually significant population countries large infection rate vaccinated within 6 months. countries lot anti-vaxxers, fault governments medical companies. agree, strange thing do. But, take account fact getting absolutely beat verbally, starts make lot sense. mean, still pathetic loser, kinda get Agree - DPA could useful getting capacity freezers, better distribution, etc. 

The Biden administration planning mass distribution sites arenas, high schools, etc. seems like smart move.

And yes, nationalized system would be, course, efficient. Woosh time reddit consensus would great decision. Everyone still iffy unproven RNA vaccines made profit stored cold temperatures thought Oxford going main vaccine we'd using. course captain hindsights coming woodwork saying ordered more. What. The. Fuck. like ""wife"" slipped there. Could share got info from? user's ass. give excess vaccines country. i.e. Canada doing. Yep massive crippling medical debt sometimes millions read 99% effectiveness J&amp;J vaccine, must said effective, vaccine makes huge difference. approved February, huge factor reaching herd immunity requires half production capacity, distribution administering. pray vaccine. specifically nutty? know multiple pregnant women won’t get vaccine they’re crazy don’t know could affect baby. that's thing...it's stretching definition. probably simple as, ""Is person payroll hospital? yes, they're healthcare worker.""


Anything narrow slows things down. Researchers said woman, lived city Salvador, infected twice: **first May 20, October 26**. symptoms powerful second time, researchers reported.

Saved click Seems like pretty easy problem solve. government aid stimulus HCW quits rather help vaccinate public. government-backed subsidies (like subsidized student loans) revert market rate.

You part society. make choice, expect society part you. INJECT STRAIGHT VEINS  sure you’re downvoted. true poverty boy got party together, got right stimulus country shut - happen,, he's really himself, so, leaves rest us (you me) cold. Let COVID-19 kill everyone work, shell bucks stop it. 

Is America great yet?  winning? get like it, also trying make narrow slows things down. 


The people local hospital got hospital employees. easy enough say ""Stage 1 hospital employees"". Narrowing say ""Hospital employees work site department X, Y, Z""....that makes things clunky slow. 


Heck wife works school, licence state, also qualified work hospital. that, vaccinated last week healthcare employee. Yeah, maybe technically qualify...but would trying create contingency workers like worth time takes so? agree make sense look SARS-CoV-1 patients hospitalized extrapolate people Covid mild symptoms? makes sense. Ah many people gather superbowl? argument exact opposite organ transplants determined. Vaccinating elderly produce greatest good. blind big picture. 

When begin vaccinate 1M people daily, still 300+ days vaccinate US. Based much testing athletes able get reasonable people would concerned might get unfair priority vaccines. mention vacation, one line:

""Mayor Claudia Lopez currently vacation.""  doctors gonna exactly? Hate break you, country way worse. Actually get older perception time changes. young nothing goes fast enough old everything fast. view taking forever... crap even old taking forever. Ever heard early bird gets worm? fools already mostly ready now, probably part future. Yeah heard hit people pretty hard. It’ll better COVID nobody wants sick ever. Huh? waiting for? now? flu... LA county shitshow. hospital already reached crisis mode. established triage team try prioritize care resources need most. We’re throwing patients cobbled-up tents don’t enough open beds. Another local hospital running oxygen use. California huge population; 39 + million people. So, it’s reasonable conclude it’s going higher infections states lower populations. Go onto site like click “tot cases/ 1M pop” headings, shows North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Tennessee, Iowa states infections per capita. California came 28th today. Per capita best way compare apples apples. saw took 200 mil online, mentioned already enough every American? population ~350mil citizen needs 2 shots, would imply need something like 600mil doses. guess Im misunderstanding Monday, coroner’s office holding 757 bodies. transfer them? Who's going pay it? true. like know we'd actually get people's arms. piss-poor planning. Dont need like 700 million though? person needs 2 doses know couple states this. However, want take like 8 hr classes cases (unpaid) volunteer. top that, state help volunteers? mean middle pandemic, need people get, give incentives like tax that. already losing tax money people die?? help vaccinate 100 people, 97 live. helped earn 97 people’s tax money comes time. It’s messed up. Release kraken! according state (Washington) someone like pre-existing conditions anything like wait least April likely later. speed process? cousin NYC able use website schedule vaccine next week. harder keep storage need -70C temperatures ready use? moderna vaccine needs slightly 0F remember correctly. It’s people die July gets here. got link disagrees terrible leaving Canada government said supposed leaving country unless essential. People government following directives government given out. agree case mayor getting harassed, Ontario, MPP travelled cottage told leave office. broke rules though going local establishments. elaborate? seen anywhere. want informed. done shitty job vaccinating country. literally nothing Trump. doubt even knows companies contracts with. Yes, President ultimately bears responsibility actions subordinates, acting like Trump personally negotiating contracts ridiculous. Finally. great news. True, think anyone suggesting go back normal immediately.

A combination caution measure herd immunity bring virus control enough chances catching low, chance surviving high.

With 1% fatality rate infected 5% chance catching virus, looking theoretical 0.0005 fatality rate even come contact virus. enough herd immunity becomes even lower less chance even coming contact it. that's consider continued use masks, hand sanitizer, social distancing possible.

So yeah, still sucks people die (and still some) anti-vaxxer stupidity: 95% immunity still pretty big impact risk level individual Andrew? assume withholding for....reasons. could make young males dicks fall 2 years make sure everyone breeding now. know long term effect risk it? I'm head sperm bank personally part. Yeah vaccines 100% effective. anti-vax people running around, longer lasts rest us laughing fucking ass raw material shortage...? Mm'kay... results trials complete yet, yet know would effective, trump want bet No, bought another 100 million December total 200 million. still option 200 million Yeah Pfizer vaccine ended late approved people would asking fat cats got much attention another one approved.

On hand US burn crazy money tanks pentagon says need probably could gone crazy locking tons every promising vaccine. hate NIMBYs lot expect go far prefer people dying building more. Absolutely. going info had. bad I'll make sure blame lands whenever topic comes up. Exactly this!  betting sites listing odds 2021 games canceled? Japan starting vaccinations couple months still, seems pretty possible. states report active versus recovered cases, mean much. COVID sneeze once, gets surfaces (3-4 days gone least fully disinfected). share house someone, share car, still smart considerate put mask on. case sneeze/cough, spraying onto car home surfaces.

Some states say wear mask outdoors. Even far away someone, people want loop thing ears every 5 minutes going walk. some, wearing mask big deal, breath fine, action hurting anyone.

I find people make dumb assumptions like clearly think type. Possibly outcast, introverted. 100-μg dose, mRNA-1273 produced high levels binding neutralizing antibodies declined slightly time, expected, remained elevated participants 3 months booster vaccination. Binding antibody responses spike receptor–binding domain assessed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. day 119 time point, geometric mean titer (GMT) 235,228 (95% confidence interval [CI], 177,236 312,195) participants 18 55 years age, 151,761 (95% CI, 88,571 260,033) 56 70 years age, 157,946 (95% CI, 94,345 264,420) 71 years age older (Figure  1. issue w prioritizing elderly others. Reducing elderly deaths vaccine increases spread mutation. 
2. Stopping spread vaccinating high exposure people would smarter. 50% transfer asymptomatic spread.
3. 3k Americans died every day last 3 months. national approach already decided who’s supposed die Pfizer take warp speed money iirc LA County 10.3 million, bad make it. pretty bad here. That's relevant here. Nearly everyone supports getting vaccinated now. That’s I’m going slowly insane stayed home wife kids almost year now. Meanwhile motherfuckers pretend like virus isn’t concern. marginalized communities faced healthcare discrimination US centuries. Putting scientist “black” “native American” helps foster cultivate trust people apprehensive they’re going taken advantage again. 95 percent means exposed covid odds getting 95 percent less someone without vaccine. 

As people get vaccine 95 percent protection odds getting exposed go way spread go way down. 

If get covid vaccine appears reduce severity. 

I see reason everyone US able hug realtives without fear fall latest. Cubans can’t even join conversation don’t internet country Reddit blocked there, tell great Children human! knew?! That's thought too. People go pretty serious mental gymnastics defend Trump. skin color noted? woman. unfortunate Oh okay well case 100M would far many 😂 first dose 3 days ago. I’m clinically extremely vulnerable don’t (can’t) work, I’m mid 30s. Doesn’t seem right got bloody queen, rollout happening much quickly expected live. fatalities someone’s mother, father, grandfather, grandmother, son daughter, brother sister. Regardless population, people matter someone dying that’s tragedy wouldn’t wish anyone. Turkeys' final revenge every facility country capability

We do... many capability.

Producing vaccines (particularly Pfizer's new mRNA one) takes specialized production storage: equipment can't pulled thin air.

Of course, try create production - even ""wartime"" mindset world, limits fast build machines, prepare site, train staff, get component ingredients etc start producing vaccines.

200 million doses Pfizer, plus potentially similar numbers (or even half that) Moderna AstraZeneca vaccines, would mean huge proportion population could vaccinated July Americans downvoting replying me, typical/ even non-US corona sub We're going that. Thanks need immortal? Yes “the whole thing overblown” “lockdown isn’t working anyway” folks. Try 21 shit. hurts. 20% rare docs spoken believe epi allergies, reactions, know actual epi preservatives epi. said stay away it. given local anesthetics past containing epi several episodes. started giving locals without epi never another problem. gonna let know vaccination day. doctor present thankfully. 20% cases found hvae lingering effects. dosent mean lung damage even quarter close Wow another OBVIOUS fuck article. There's like 5+ these. Posted every day sub actually thought sub better smarter? Bunch backcountry morons  saying that. saying people wear PPE. become relaxed around family gatherings. talking recent surge Christmas. Call positive Covid patients day Cubans ones getting mowed covid coup theater Bird hand versus two bush. Fever gone itchy. Hungry eat doggy Think it'll little longer that. holiday gathering events ending, means groups people got sick xmas gatherings new years parties spending past week getting next batch people sick. Vaccine rollout still pretty slow. Healthcare workers nursing home resident/staff getting vaccine wonderful, they've also already elevated chance exposure. probably 1 2 cycles reinfection thanks holidays. surprised holds/goes another 2 weeks. Ontario think. curfew either, commenting delivery pickup situation experienced before. really matter... Weirdos spin saying cover coroner Good!

Put no-fly list too. trying take anything away vaccine effort, pales comparison moon landing. vaccines developed days. Moderna vaccine developed single person US even died COVID-19. actually anything special development vaccine. know sounds like insult, actually exact opposite. vaccines went normal trials medication would. massive risks taken shortcuts used. mRNA technology never used before, companies already developed many years adapting COVID-19 piece cake. read invulnerables prayers. hope gets better soon. hospitals get overwhelmed, CFR skyrockets people can't get care. could get *much* worse. Immensely saddening. needs it. I'm pretty sure whoever invented Teflon able getting sample blood.^/s shit.. fuck thought athletes get first... Ouch believe older study severe illness one little earlier disease progression, seems like good news. LOL. fuck would lie? realize silly sound? honest said enjoy company. tsk tsk, instead I'll continue destroying making example CA needs housing free anyway. Az least people part partying rule one person per household shopping? anyone tel vaccine grant immunity?

Like still need go around hugging relatives time next year?

Will 95% us able that?

Will still get Covid weak version? last four days alone, average 250 COVID-19 deaths day reported L.A. County. That’s higher average number daily deaths causes combined, including heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, car crashes, suicides homicides, 170.

wow. Right that's point it...you suggested Canadian healthcare 33rd world subsidized/not-for-profit. world's biggest for-profit system better, so...surely figure relevance comment. lol, thinking tragic news Tachycardia, sweating, chest pain, nausea vomiting. happened local anesthetics containing epi. switched non-epi locals problems since then.
They said reactions rare epi could preservatives used injections epi.

 clue regular epi pen stuff worry.  possible don't, yeah I'm pissed. pandemic absolutely devastated economy, killed absurd amount people, wrecked everyone's mental health. I’m sleepy now, however, I’ve got time allotted tomorrow post. last research saw months ago looked like nursing homes, schools hospitals. community transmission lower. sure fits today accuracy info either... Enforcement county sheriff. can't really much crazies.  know, maybe instead copy paste responses, might consider many people talk uninsured insured can’t exactly prioritize crusade here.   That’s unusual. people don’t spread much all.  33% within household seems right.

(The problem also superspreaders spread whole family unrelated people side restaurant.) HCW get first dibs vaccine get walk away?

The social compact best prioritize take care HCW, best put effort vaccinate rest nation.

Again, think that's unreasonable. Gimme!! Let’s GOooooo!!! ?? catch asymptotic people, also catch presymptomatic people shedding crap ton virus. aged 40 can't get cancer treatment scheduled, taking years life.

That's caused lockdowns combined media hysteria (""if get COVID die avoid going hospitals unless super-duper urgent"").

If actually care cancer patients, understand \*WHY\* media blood people missed cancer appointments due fear getting COVID hands.

They sold stupid narrative COVID deadlier fricking rest world one would need quarantine pandemic would finally end life would back normal. Everyone would benefit this.  pocket change. vaccines range like $5-20 per. bought two billion vaccines, double amount currently ordered, would amount $40 billion tops. 2% $2 trillion bill recently passed. $40 billion, $80 billion even (4x current order) magnitudes cheaper vaccines asap.  Biden May enact defense production act ensure enough doses made. think we'll end relying Phizer/Moderna alone Biden office. likely big pharmas could contribute. Currently blocked patents. I'd willing pay much vaccine.  COVID comes 8PM, everyone knows  guarantee elderly relatives died would bigger impact mental health able nandos week mates.

It's binary choice.

If things re-open and/if elderly relatives get COVID, survival rate still close 90% (IFR ages 60+ 10% IIRC). 9 10 elderly relatives, statistically speaking, survive.

Have read news 107-year-old lady survived COVID w/o lasting effects? Surviving normal think. know Philip prince queen Question: antivax idiots affect rest us taking vaccine? sister totally onboard it, kid April turned god damn nutjob. See also New Zealand, countries spaced populus like Iceland.  
   
Or, really want feel silly, look mortality rate cities ICU overloaded vs. also elevator case Loss taste common flu too? South African variant right? think almost papers immunology year, distributed preprints.  important distinction, though, between:  Fresh manuscript;  Submitted, review; Accepted publication. Accepted papers are, essentially, regular journal papers waiting printer queue.

No harm -- people interested, read. 

Thank you, again.  Strangely Wisconsin kids scheduled get vaccine people 50’s. That’s use many different sources information. didn’t even notice many people commented original comment today I’ve listening BBC podcasts! M'kay
 Since obviously figured out, think numbers would lower higher w/out stay home orders? SARS-CoV-2 related SARS-CoV-1, shares many symptoms, treatments, effects, coronavirus family MERS-CoV it’s likely use data looking potential effects. It’s actually smartest thing study related data planning instead what? waiting around 10 years see happens? know make toilet paper too, still find months. Eh mean seeing I'm going locked summer waiting vaccine appointment rate anyway seeing I'm old enough priority young enough unafraid spend pandemic going orgies....

I mind seeing olympics. strangely okay small percentage humans capable olympians getting vaccinated distract world burning 2 weeks. Get rid Zoom now, need teleconferencing find better solution compromise data.  true you’re worried billion dollars blow trillions relief. could bought enough vaccine candidates phase III trials fraction cost recent $2,000 per person cover bases. Even then, it’s like would loss even got approved delivered. sell countries end needed here. guess hoping get second term let states bid like PPEs. Lol Trump fucked entirely different matter studying source virus. Please stay focused. coworkers (in healthcare) supposed get vaccine Monday, got group text boss earlier tonight they’d cancelled. Apparently hospital enough vaccines give second dose people already gotten first. I’m hearing, every hospital state right now. Disappointing, looking forward getting started, since it’s two week process fully vaccinated. Hopefully we’ll get vaccinated soon. here. night first shot felt terrible nasty headache, aches, really sore arm. Three weeks later experienced almost side effects arm hurting hours  An, already enough?

I guess that's every state behind vaccinations ever state sayibg supply issue.

40 50 million vaccinated goal end December, moved back end week 1, 2021.

Where now? 23 million? Shut fuck up. making sense. could teach monkey give Well, wouldn’t able pay either way (except already rich) wouldn’t make already irresponsible person desperate? don’t need tension equation, however may be. Manitoba already they? makes sense Ontario go lockdown too... exactly worst case scenario. hope outlier. r/WSB leaking think afford take gamble rate supply increasing. new variants us racing clock. disease infectious enough last spring. California public health disaster, way around point.

The worse case scenario mutation resistant vaccines odds increases infections occur.

The big problem right doses put arms. sitting due either administrative incompetence lack ability administer; probably due former . 

There shortages regardless everyone willing vaccinated gets dosages. think get point supply ever outpaces demand.

It better opinion gamble maximizing ability administer vaccine first, even err side shortages pop up, rather throttle back ensure second doses. think afford level caution point. Deployment speed critical, hit immunity vaccination hospitals fail point this.

Gamble second dose available 21 days, aided good enough scheduling system place delay first doses supply chain interrupted.

I can't stress time crunch. Get many people partial immunity possible, hope decreases serious cases hospitalizations, hope production increases decreases, really hope resistant strain emerge. 

We can't reckless sure, can't afford 100% safe either. vaccinate ""credit"" faith distribution; distribution gets messed screwed anyway.

Additionally musn't agonize point paralysis egalitarian distribution hierarchy gets first past initial 75+/Health Care workers need most; states seem doing.

Shots arms, expeditiously possible. really glad able good friendship. enlightening finding friendship, initial reaction fear, worse. Well, would, they! Biden invokes DPA still accelerate things. confidence lend validity statement.

At current vaccination pace, take 2 years vaccinate 60% US population. Globally vaccination process starting unprecedented logistical global health challenge.

We hope improvement many hurdles front us, unknown. example know vaccinated people silent carriers. know easy convince enough population get vaccinated. know viral mutations happen cases spike winter.

I believe go back something resembling normal 2022 hope see live music end 2021. Let's go easy make tough decisions analyze situation best abilities knowledge.

Edit: typos Wrong. countermeasure injury compensation program run health resources services administration fully covering COVID-19 vaccines even ramped staffing order deal higher expected workload. Anyone healthcare professional enjoys priority vaccination due profession ""walks"" pandemic rages face serious 

Lmao desperation. people fucked everything HCWs pay? drafted military members now?  people die Covid retirees. absolutely churning fast can. wouldn’t they? always buyer point turn 17 think know enough family rule anything like that. new strains may difficult treat, prevent, etc afaik share similar effects body short term long term. That’s rule possibility it’s impossible wouldn’t losing sleep it. Yep. Death worst thing covid. cuz florida mostly farmland lol.

no one planning shut indefinitely, one thought dumbasses going keep going hosting parties wear masks.

we've destroyed economy? lmao passed stimulus bill first one expired maybe destroyed?? blaming congress blaming state? actually believe that? people symptom free spread less.

I know that. countries paid sick leaves, people symptoms stay home, really get spread around much. Perhaps lot spread happens due people symptoms, know isolate home. read them, yes. convinced rational basis making comment. convinced yourself? Because, saying goes, ""the buck stops here.""

His admin fucked up. one else's. 1) Guy antibodies mild infection 8 months ago.

2) Recent sera test shows antibodies maintained

3) Guy gets reinfected, time new variant, B117

4) Much severe disease 2nd case initial illness mild, reinfection new variant critical/life-threatening... Rapid work learning immune, vaccine diagnostic escape needed, data severity illness caused VOC- 202012/01. He's proposed $600 low income residents $220 billion budget. doesnt work lol, everyone then. think go straight door-to-door offering injections. case counts sustained lower double digits county least 50% vaccinated I'm hitting mall get new shoes. Averaging 2,400/day right though. Legal jargon/reasons money covid vaccines specifically exempt fund immune liability. give vaccine [royal Hah /r/comedycemetery confirmed cases? actual probably 3x number. Yikes! roughly 16,000,000 people. insignificant number people lifelong bankruptcy medical costs “the greatest nation Earth.” Jared Kushner thought could word better deal bluffing negotiating vaccine makers ( like real estate ). 

Pfizer don’t play game. mean give wrong impression. correct post refer accepted manuscript? go respiratory distress getting shots dangerous air quality work taking toll. Right. maybe, vaccinating people actually treating COVID patients, switch age based, anyone turn show driver's license/ID know... visibly old. medical student 20 years ago, already felt overwhelmed would go ER would people lined hallways gurneys . also felt overwhelmed sheer volume patients house didn’t understand residents could juggle many sleep-deprived.

I agree 100% otherwise.  
I would responded parent comment, replied I'd probably shout pillow like 2 hours time?  That's fair. Charles covid back March last year. highly unlikely meaningful level immunity point. estimates I've seen around 90 days. 99% effective? What? phase 3 trials still ongoing. That's 100M people Pfizer's vaccine. There's still Moderna, Oxford, J&amp;J, etc. Take account none approved 16yrs old part population vaccinated anyways. Yeah, Australia numbers low case pop up, close contacts isolated, close contacts contacts too. top that, 50% cases genomic sequencing done, among highest world. efficient means government effectively wade different job titles? probably can’t get detailed org charts spend ton time trying find every edge case Ok, first know guys keep mentioning Trump even involved. secondly difference original concern get doses July. reality get beginning summer. 70 million doses July. time July rolls around problem going many doses vaccine going many antivaxxers have. BioNtech/Pfizer accept Operation Warpspeed (stupidest fucking name ever btw) money. Trump tried force supplying US basically said get fucked, pay us doses deliver. Initially 450Million. refused despite pay delivery. 300M refused again. 200M total luckily someone willing talk whoever supply act like bloated man baby got loose warehouse used specifically hole leftover Cheetohs dust. it’s Mass Casuality Incidents. triage. would classify MCI teacher?! 58% cases sequenced. cases now. We've upped lab capabilities sequencing generally available 48 hours swabbing. helps lot contact tracing. Sure did.... /s Yeah, that’s it’s going. governor says it’s mandatory police refusing enforce it. it’s like boss said it’s mandatory wear mask work manager doesn’t enforce workers wearing all, since manager enforcing people refuse wear masks written even though 100M friends patrons. I'm actually surprised bought many, assume first offer made. Like literally. Pfizer could said 10,000 would bought may people donated money him. It’s that. It’s people believing entitled normal holiday/family behaviour pandemic, deadly viruses don’t care mental health family bonds. one regulating shit la san beranrdino either, oc mandatory then. ""ya gotta it, personally care don't. Go ahead. stop you."" that's stupid bullshit. Hopefully not, come travel restrictions enforce. already advising travel outside city live/work CNY. Workplaces already enforcing measures places. cases continue spread, fully expect government moves advising enforcing themselves. NGL that's bit past thr point okay I've taken thing seriously Also track adverse reactions. unlikely serious side effects show now, do, want know soon possible. Florida isnt pretending though feel you. We've staying home almost 11 months now, leaving house go hiking trails store (adults going store b/c kids like lick things sometimes). We're part stop spread, meanwhile... people exactly bad. California announced sorts measures, ton people (probably literally millions) follow them, law enforcement county public health departments interested enforcement. mean, think good practice observe people shot. think need limit one observed time/per 30 min. slot, unless there's issue (like facility really short staff, something). allergy rate really low, (maybe I'm mistaken) slightly higher typical vaccines. 11.1 per million. [The CDC put something days given full read yet.

But yeah, point checking immunity/antigen. slow, esp. rural hospitals/places w/ low resources. exactly know long natural immunity's going last. whole point hospital decide patient gets lifesaving care.

at least heard 圆脸自干五. Might need clarification that. mean obviously get now.

But Olympics supposed happen July. means athletes get vaccine late may get full protection.

By vulnerable people gotten it, they'll start general public.

I think reasonable athletes, plus pro sports athletes towards front line opposed young healthy people. Trump owns stock Moderna Yeah I'd definitely hop that. They’ll probably need 70% national vaccination rate see drop. recent aerosolised studies suggest might need 95% vaccination elimination via herd immunity. “America first” - Trump racist

Forget lockdown, barely get day off. definitely agree unfortunately can’t let guard down. I’ve close calls already despite careful. need vigilant everyone vigilant.

Unless state Florida. would’ve deleted zoom last year. Fucking glad don’t teach online anymore.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Indeed so, according linked article.

This Japan-exclusive decision United States Britain already rolled Pfizer vaccine. They, too, limit use people 16 older. Moderna approved 2 countries. approved entire EU. I’m sure much sense makes squeeze remaining non-immune people smaller number store square footage time intervals. Ugh response got cut politics, short version:

Fair point deployment, service deployment think debating different things.

As statement driving ambulances: thought ATS training included on-the-job training based done units, realize evidence may well wrong. apologize no, proof driving ambulances either training subaltern implied without evidence beyond staged photo ops.

With regard proof completing training day, reliable evidence would military records available, however even patchy. grandfather's WW2 records, example, honest list things evidence doing, Holland. Considering Pfizer vaccine currently approved 16 makes sense. Anyone else tired types headlines? That's like saying ""we enough lifeboats titanic let's torpedo Californian get theirs."" literally harm good transferring patients ""skilled care facilities"" which, often, anything but. replacement actual hospitals. Might well set special facilities staffed NG. patients needed real medical help going die least take fifty introduced infection vulnerable population possible. Well, US country fully privatized health system, they're nowhere near 1 world healthcare. non-profit/subsidized reason that. seriously early remember news reports China showing ground-glass opacities people's lungs, including kids, even low/no symptom people. stuck mind horrible think thousands people suffering possibly years, maybe lifetime - shortened lifetime - damage can't heal.

if know anyone regular bacteria pneumonia vunerable getting years longer like have... made shudder. I've relative gets pneumonia 2 -3 times winter &amp; vigilant getting flu pneumonia booster (pneumonia booster 5 years) regularly even annyoing good intentions reminding cuz want end hospital die next time :( survey 1000 people ask them: would like poorer die? Pretty much choose 'poorer'. bad economic damage is, survivable. ancestors managed nearly decade rationing win WW2, came fine. UK virus killed 1 1000 total population probably end getting close 1 500 lockdowns. I'm even going start life changing infection survive. Impaired lung function seems common joke.

 top need keep cases health services cope. let rip, lockdowns, end overwhelmed hospitals forced triage covid patients turn away pretty much everyone else. Cancer heart disease mortality spike next years effect.

 fundamentally comes simple question. want poorer die? Since know vast majority would choose 'poorer' national lockdowns rational democratic choice.  good point!  health authorities issued guidance whether exposed others exposed covid quarantine? two degrees separation confirmed case unpopular opinion simply cannot blame business chooses continue operating. Anyone favor shutting businesses clearly never owned known someone owned one. many (most, even) small business owners would better die live business lost. Here, people late 30s 40s age groups highest prevalence

That possibly coincide age group kids school, could it. mean, let's fair. society always unspoken level acceptable mortality respiratory diseases. 2019 level around 0.1% population per year, mortality flu plus minor diseases. 2020 we've accepted lockdowns solution exceeding 0.1% barrier (which we've already failed US). everyone agrees right threshold. would say 0.5% okay 1% okay. agree disagree them, lets pretend threshold set stone like law physics. I'm outright saying life ""more important,"" I'm saying vaccinated group. state teachers phase 1 all! think elderly 100% vaccinated, phase 1, phase 1 also include teachers. state school classes unfortunately. far aware zero trial data 16 year olds thus far makes sense. nervous about? Several reasons this. 

-people didn’t listen experts avoid thanksgiving Christmas gatherings 

- covid spreads efficiently colder weather. 

- immune systems don’t fight viruses colder weather well warmer weather. 

-people think masks work better do. can’t get together multiple households board game nights even wear masks (I know people done this) 

- people wearing masks indoor public spaces. It’s rare live almost every time go grocery store there’s always one jerk. 

- lack large stimulus meant lots people symptoms going work. surge cases following Halloween Thanksgiving produced record hospitalizations California, seriously ill patients dying unprecedented numbers.

Halloween Thanksgiving.

more people flew Christmas. Pfizer giving vaccine away free flooded US opioids.... Really? Huh. thought early 70s high risk. guess probably know better do. ask doctor. Easy ? fairness US waaay people. 16 reported COVID deaths age group 20-29 entire state Wisconsin (thanks making thread lmao). claim know 2 them. I’m aware dangers COVID, take precautions, wear mask, avoid gatherings, feel families affected this. Shit, I’ve seen mine twice year live hour away. think you’re liar. Don’t get twisted. don’t deny COVID, don’t believe you.  Introducing patients high mortality rates facilities time mostly clean covid lacked proper equipment training handle highly contagious virus full patients multiple high risk factors...you probably assume save lives increases mortality. thought said would wait line Pragmatism. mom got second one Thursday. Ah, see. Dunno confused BIL didn’t get even though he’s eligible medical volunteer he’s young healthy didn’t want take vaccine someone else might need. Never mind sister’s health leaves vulnerable coworkers 75 health conditions.

I’m splitting time covid unit cardiac floor. 50% patients 80 beds. know give they’re likely going die. problem, get that. first glance looks okay, picked 'Vaccines inherently dangerous' thing second sweep. idea author is, one-person job 'organisation' graphic design package. fact gives whole page trying justify he's qualified review science set alarm bells ""think I'm nutjob?

Anyone covid funny feeling nose?kind like blow nose much sneeze hard cares? want bunch empty nursing home beds remain vacant nursing staff can't trusted violate sanitary protocols?

You're addressing wrong problems result actually people die vacant beds becomes artificial cap icu beds.

The one thing confounds anything nursing assistants can't even bothered wear masks correctly, even taking talk, making covid bus stations posted cause damage. would. like shutdowns happening, NY, DC, NC VA shut around time. makes sense travel/commuting states.  good, it’s waste use vaccine someone like you. Wife works nursing home receive first vaccination next week. kind freaked hearing anaphylactic reaction reports vaccinations. 
 problem gets severe reactions epinephrine, treat anaphylactic reactions. basically worried she'll reaction vaccine screwed treatment due issue epinephrine. 

I'm seeking medical advice all, looking educate might possibly ease mind. already gave percentages reactions vaccine. explained info possible PEG correlation still fence. trying say here? parents get 2 mondays whole NOMA (non overlapping magisteria) bullshit though.

In one sense could said Catholic Church pseudoscientific rather anti-scientific. Oh ok it?

Hypocritical much 😂😂😂.

*R E G E N E R N* like one movies clear protagonist mistaken insane, actually insane. Kinda makes wonder proposal already made, accepted, deployed. clear, total across 100 people. individual total, magistrates Wimbledon issued £58,394 fines 104 offenders ordered pay total £24,639 costs fees. death proven covid, would give vaccine death rate 0.00000004%.

(1 potential death, 24 million yes. plan get it. One family members already has.

Unless start seeing tens thousands deaths, there's reason think vaccine even comparably risky covid. started seeing kind rise deadly reactions I'd re-weigh pros cons again.

BUT

It would take 500,000 deaths caused vaccines already distributed match covid death rate.

Not mention fact get covid could infect others leading death, sickness, mental health issues, economic issues. Prolonging pandemic spreading sickness death. vaccine reaction contagious.

I understand concerned new discoveries like vaccine. even Dr. Gregory's death turn caused freak one 24 million reaction would MUCH take odds rather risk family/friend's health continuing covid hanging heads. suppose. I'm sure would tell benefits outweigh rare reaction. looking things reassure her. one regulating anything here. live Orange County passed multiple restaurants today still permitting INDOOR dining.

The reason French awful.  fucks sake... speed scope getting vaccine idea distributing enough cover US monumental achievement. would say it’s par moon landing. you’re pissed it’s going take July instead April?! people dying got Halloween American Thanksgiving.

Everyones different *""Just get vaccines food everyone""*  Got first jab days ago won’t get second 25th fact it’s got excited beyond belief Stop malingering get work fighting covid Dude. Fucking nothing open LA right now. People going partying up. Grocery stores retail right now. LA one locked mask + social distancing areas US right now. Telling get fucking deserve totally asinine. keep going back thinking spreads bats caves. 

Really puts things perspective terms superspreader events, etc, rather seasonality.  Yes also gives date country last vaccination data updated She’s already immortal could waited. fail see willingly letting government commit human rights violations worth protection virus 0.2% overall mortality rate ages (it drops drastically lower anybody age 60).

How broad stroke plans help, much easier target protection likely die this? Maybe gain super powers?

But play game gotta also consider know vaccine couple years. 20% everyone gets develops terrible cancer 4 years? Stop whining work covid  yet. Trials set symptoms. Although vaccinations started across world find next months US empty swathes land. urbanized try though. Almost justified Europe's failures (not really tho) one pedophile family fuck downvoted, people like new COVID lifestyle? vaccine proven safe 1 / 100,000 chance allergic reaction, idk people could opposed taking evidence

EDIT: read business paragraph, really glad people realizing restrictions bullshit, funny many upvotes would gotten last summer thing always confused yersinia pestis explanation plague contemporaneous accounts wisdom traveled air distancing social isolation prevented spread. pneumonic plague, indeed travel air, also transmitted via mice rats (specifically flea bites). like mice, rats fleas respect social distancing. people want back classroom ASAP. serious? land covid hellhole info people vaccinated spread virus? Yes I’m proud home state...but hope NY gets together soon. YES 35 year old friend who’s teaching remotely 32 year old friend who’s therapist working remotely get shot (both low risk conditions) yet parents 74 CANT may able til April!?  contact back. first time. bad impression never use again. try services though. Possible controversial opinion: assuming high risk individuals get vaccines countries consider vaccinating Olympians... “ok getting back normal” feel added hope. wow, year southern neighbours still think ""freedumb"" argument worth anything?

also, yes still outbreaks China countries prevailed virus, 300 cases week vastly different 300k cases single day freedumbland. PA literally said doesn’t want Israel’s help. It’s hard believe people like can’t blame Israel everything that’s wrong Palestine rest Arab world. Blame incompetence. pure idiocy. passive progressives CA decided Coronavirus somewhere around fall people gathering droves traveling country would them. mad.  Maybe it’s false positive? suspect something similar happened someone work, tested positive earlier week tested negative 2 days later. people unironically believe businesses exempt mechanics cause spread scenarios? I've never touched front mask take off. Always ear loops.  Pfizer: Well we’ll keep offer guy we’re pretty sure he’ll want that... Yeah, could possible counties high test positivity rates. experts mentioned talking national averages, moment, national test positivity lower positivity rate hard hit counties southern california. 

So, yeah, 12% could possible regions fucking brutal. preferred teaching mongolian kids give shit wanted get rise person teaching motivated college bound Americans online believe read trial data severe symptoms/reactions happened lot people second shot. Interesting question. guess anything worth noting immune response 30% vaccinated got sick, would mentioned. IMO safe assume people develop *any* usable immunity unvaccinated people  hold back 50% going shit ton held back constantly. That’s like holding back chicken next trip super market. don’t that. new chicken article explains can't rush far along vaccinating nursing homes California? drive though like testing. high school gyms. isn’t rocket science Oh boy. waiting confirmation 2 doses 2 weeks gives us 95% *sterilising* vaccination protection.  Yes, that’s true. 

If drop masks social distancing early, providing social signalling deniers ant-maskers drop precautions without social backlash, that’s true.

But ‘Americans champing bit drop masks, results dropping masks mere 50% immunity (it’s 70% one dose) complete catastrophe comparison dropping masks 95% immunity, people need get heads 2 dose schedule acceptable, half-dose-and-hope-we-can-get-you-a-second-one-sometime schedule complete idiocy.  Ok, side? also agree article please stop spreading misinformation like *Sweden probably already 10k dead* *Soon pass x country*. 

Now go look [neigboring countries excess you’ll see Swedens excess deaths **below** reported deaths, it’s way around countries weren’t affected much spring. It’s evening out, expected. Also - older (and richer) folks got face mortality. realizing there’s nothing “wait for”. splurging luxury car doesn’t need wait. Perhaps it’s worth enjoy can. Biden quite literally power yet. *can't* anything. get first dose second dose? Isn’t washing hands canceled. don’t get like took Sinopharm one, day first dose bit light headed slightly disoriented, nothing severe. second dose, 4 weeks ago, anything. CHRISTMAS SUPPOUSED DO, EH?! need put time limits groups. 1 week vaccinate health care workers move along next group. lockdown lol? non-essential businesses still open, schools open north, soon south. joke. read point, wear good quality mask? Everybody? went Walmart today, big sign front ""Walmart Requires masks"". I'm oxygen, single parent son ""and"" put mask. difficult breath, slow down. OK, see others walk ""free"" masks go in! Walmart force here, take sign! others put life risk ""right"" wear mask? everyone wore mask 30 days, reduce spread past life span with? JMHO article... ""Patients, average age 57, visited June September answered questions symptoms health-related quality life.""  He's smart man I've seen things stuff like including people diagnosed Bell's Palsy first injection. Turns number people got bells palsy vaccine proportional number would get without. assume something similar. He's worst President time incredibly stupid man. What's me, thought. Yah health system doesn’t start trying harder. 800 day. Give brake. TRY HARDER. charge enough everything else. Time give back. Could spare Canada? We've gotten 500k doses total far 125k week ongoing moment we're running vaccines give hospitals hard hit areas.

Mild joking aside kind frustrates see states get arms guys able vaccinate much quicker almost country, get majority Pfizer, even Trump basically refused much possible buy doses them. I’m much ok this. Get elderly immunocompromised vaccine, include olympians next wave. olympics happen every 4 years (or 5 case) really unifying event world. mRNA vaccines Pfizer Moderna looking great far. J&amp;J AZ vaccines use different approach far less data safety efficacy far. Apples oranges. Australia word DATA invisible R it!  Going seems scaring me, co. Worker gave ghost last week.!!!! city see scared jungle.. Wtf states last 6 months. look graph cases graph deaths, cases levelled somewhat thanksgiving around 200k per day, reached 300k per day. Given everything well 400k per day now.

At time positivity rate gone around 8% 14% deaths continued climb swift rate, even shifting month.

Upshot, looks like US testing cannot keep up, death rate slowing, covid deaths recognised properly. guess true current death rate probably least 4.5k per day, 5k end month.

Nothing looks happening next x weeks change anything.

Besides real lockdown everyone knows happen, US really needs go mass testing program everyone US, immediate 'lateral flow Innova' test sift separate disease within society. UK throwing $130bn mass screening try get ontop spread there. viable way US gain back control many months - everyone gets immediate test, everyone found disease ordered, prosecution so, isolate society. Cut transmission uncontrolled Ctrl+f ""population"".

No one discussed country sizes, population sizes. people live cities anyway. restrictions enforced all. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Well hospitals need know shit off. yes, 3x 4x expensive, takes try crush hard lead time 30-40% experience. gouging: need take existing maker thing clear line's schedule anything else... suppliers too... way supply chain dependencies, need run constraining lines 24/7 100 hour work weeks ( big time overtime/bonus/ + care dependents) make 2x really need account sloppiness. costs big-time money - worth actually work.

I actually speak this! company Pfizer Moderna supply chains. area expertise, I'm sales customer service, talk office past months company leadership communicating entire team pretty constantly since something interest.

Basically, work pharma already pretty marked up. require lot us, record keeping inspections, immense quality standards. Something might perfectly fine another company result entire order rejected pharma company superficial variation (we battle pharma customer used 18"" stretchwrap pallet spec said used 20"", thats anal are). this, charge 2-5x would comparable product different industry.

The current demands us COVID related projects interesting. want less, atypical. typically perfectly content pay whatever ask. asked keep prices costs control, time turning dime meet insane delivery dates shorter normal lead times zero opportunity late push deliveries. clear, understand challenges worked move mountains part. several hands deck days nights weekends everyone, including office staff executives, production floor. 

I obviously can't speak anyone else supply chain, hold already prioritize vaccine effort. honestly believe others well. want go back normal. reason, think simple paying premium clear lines push orders. experience, basically already that. asking us since August, help effort maintain relationship without extra premium (we essentially breaking even vaccine related stuff, even though pharma generally biggest moneymaker). us, maybe others too, would HUGE premium scale wouldnt require pushing orders, would require new production lines entirely. Getting online would usually take months years, plus however long would take get certified customer. orders could push existing lines, would disruptive life saving projects work on, including things like vaccines cancer drugs. defense production act take us manufacturing AZ showed like 65% effectiveness main study. really worth using resources (manpower, money) distributing one? Derek Lowe great article this: UK administering AZ vaccine, likely data collected given UK trusted ally US, perhaps possibility might make decision based real world usage resulting quicker approval?

With said, I'd like see vaccine authorized well, primarily used towards without underlying health conditions better vaccines used 65+ underlying health conditions.

I'm virologist, knows -- new administration coming, whatever current policies are, going subject re-review 10 days. going take years. Regarding shortage, three vaccines currently awaiting trial results. one approved, especially Oxford/AstraZenica's candidate (already approved UK think EU), US many vaccines needs end pandemic. current rate actually awful, yesterday 800k vaccinations today, weekend 750k. relatively low rate due fact hospitals reserved first batch. vaccinations open general public normal pharmacies perform them, it'll go much quickly. FDA trials all?! next sets vaccines different mRNA ones currently using. Let scientists work. got moderna, soreness fatigue days. Flu shot worse need stop worrying much gets it. start putting arms we’re done. vaccination centers keep jabbing till Covid over. took month give stupid fucking doctors shit say cus wasn’t next peoples turn Pfizer Moderna share recipe vaccine leveraging peoples lives profit? That's swell. That's fake news brah - Slovakia alone 49k m2 Israel 22k m2. 80000000000/330000000 Shhhhh, ask question. US alone approaching (and hopefully soon exceeding) 1 million doses/day administered. countries also starting vaccinate also ramping much can. total FAR 1 million/day. administer millions flu shots. keep seeing need help. fuck national guard fema get side effects second shot mainly Pretty sure you’re supposed outside vehicle you’re fueling case issues. Even it’s 50% effective used. People get better vaccine next year approval process ongoing then? matter anymore? 150 per person Erm Moderna 150 CT? Exactly. dude typical middle manager type wants somehow magically pull productivity thin air flogging rank file.

It work way. called Death March gets loss productivity mistakes. That's way works. I'd suggest looking found information critically. Literally what? Plus couple hundred million from
Moderna Johnson Johnson thing canceled they're smart, they'll play vaccine card powerful political leverage. Good India.  Yes- rare owe true american heros gratitude. sacrificed us chrildren hisotory ever understand. deserve honor highest magnitude. heart goes family brave man. Yes, proof there. Lol, that’s you’re delusional. time tell we’ll see know health experts. I'm even England, reason Queen's getting vaccine really reassured me. keep hearing go exercise...while exercise India small apartment. many concessions even bad state opinion. heard people misusing like hell. that's exactly many sociopaths politics. Normal people resign pressure insane power hungry sociopaths tell everyone fuck keep whatever heck want. Trump said unnecessary US doesn’t need vaccines. Big pharma said that’s fine we’ll keep uncle joe make sure get money.  Didnt realise reptilians alpha centuri could get coronavirus! liked slipped One secret: Look small neighborhood stores never even noticed before. may busier, too, but, small stores may much shorter lines big supermarkets. dislike posts one specific person dying virus. Waste time. Slovakia death rates still skyrocketing. thing save hardcore Wuhan style lockdown police welding people homes forcefully throwing anyone infected quarantine camp. Californian here. work three essential jobs get by, keep contact variety people. I’m sure doesn’t help. don’t privilege affording stay home, I’m sure it’s like most.  India (in state) similar curfew introduced govt gave explanation seemed reasonable - police force enforcement needed break work lower shifts. curfew means supposed out, far less headcount police needed monitoring night. get annoyed people bring without mentioning baseline rate ITP. medical resident brought real risk r/medicine pissed know better.

In US every one million people 66 people get ITP every single year. FIVE million shots given vaccine.

So amongst people vaccinated would expect **330 cases ITP** even vaccine zero effect ITP.

Now, cases ITP tend respond well high dose steroids and/or IVIG. everyone’s guy essentially severe 330 likely cases you’d see coincidence.

The news media incredibly irresponsible reporting this. ""The true number coronavirus cases U.S. could anywhere [six 24 higher confirmed number cases, depending location, according large federal study relied data 10 U.S. cities states."" 
   
The CDC COVID-19 Response Team 16 state health departments conducted investigation. Journal American Medical Association findings investigation July 21, 2020: 
    
""Results — estimated number infections ranged 6 24 times number reported cases; 7 sites (Connecticut, Florida, Louisiana, Missouri, New York City metro area, Utah, western Washington State), estimated greater 10 times SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred number reported cases."" Must talking Biden. many voters think virus real? 100M probably enough tbh. Technically adenovirus based vaccines like AstraZeneca J&amp;J ones traditional well tested methods. Nothing groundbreaking there. mRNA new yeah, they’re vaccines approved world. Singapore. escaped case quarantine family infected stopped. also due cross contamination quarantine hotel. 

Zero cases nearly month mini cluster. That's bit unfair ironic considering areas hit hardest covid-19 ones toe line covid precautions. ass backwards hicks use precautions believe pandemic fake relatively hospitalizations even fewer deaths. 

The true purpose hospital render advanced lifesaving techniques care. health industry revolves around money, more, receive better care. two people advance covid symptoms, one health insurance receive ventilator one without receive oxygen line. Doctors, nurses, hospitals render aid, person comes actively dieing. Everything else depends personal wealth health insurance. thought Xmas New Years main superspreader events, got insurrection week later icing cake. wonder February worst month deaths entire pandemic start recover end it. New cases weeks start dropping chance latter. 

As much issues bottlenecks missed cases testing, still pretty consistent peaks valleys deaths follow testing 2-3 weeks later, new cases haven’t showed signs slowing increase declining yet, deaths almost certainly keep rising next two weeks, 7 day average going 500 deaths every couple weeks too. 5k average daily deaths March don’t see change right direction soon. LOL, think they've thought through? enact restrictions know financial hit. measures fully supported Federal Gevernment way hell defunded. Rules thee think?

Take whatever worst option anything is, that's option Trump takes. Toilet paper national health emergency. I’ll get downvoted eternity don’t care. fact many people taking vaccine without knowing long term effects insane me. antivax? No. proper safe ways vaccines developed; almost ignored this. It’s less year, can’t honestly tell totally safe. Yea nearly every single time i've heard someone say ""I right still got it"" there's always nugget like ""but room mate.."" ""my family even tested quarantined first.."" every single time there's instant broke quarantine got infected. Huh? saying health care workers working 7 day weeks? Everyone know works hospital short staffed working crazy overtime. fundamentally change.”

-Biden 2020 part comment political? ICUs.... They're telling ambulances even bring dying people hospitals. Stop pretending OK. major lockdown

Speaking someone grew Eastern Bloc communist dictatorship (and living California 2 decades now) - y'all idea word ""lockdown"" really means. laugh every time hear it. quarantining home since March except 1 hour, masked, outdoor Christmas Thanksgiving, finally decided needed start camping. Outdoors, air flow, open space, still wear masks. great experience literally go ""indoors"" pee (not airconditioned spaces State Parks, ventilated outdoor air) wear masks camp ""space"".  realize vaccines prevent infection/transmission, right? Israel entered severe lockdown since Friday. Cases bound drop alone within week so. Hospitalization within 2 weeks.

As vaccines. Israel began campaign 3 weeks ago, first week significantly slower next 2. takes 2-3 weeks get decent immunity, allow time affect Cases week 10 days affect hospitalization. Taking account, that's 2-3 weeks see cases slightly affected 4-6 weeks till get large drop hospitalization. two months hospitalization fraction see countries.  plan fail. LA Monday, one four people it. think that’s county. last year atmosphere start deploying vaccines, reasonably quick transition back normal.

Yes, among people literally idea they're talking about.

If actually listened experts industry saying, know majority people (in US) get vaccinated late summer/early fall 2021. roughly 25% worlds population waiting 2022. we'll wearing masks (at least) like another year (from today). Santa Clara County well, tho'. don’t understand employees care homes can’t required get it. generally things like almost every case employee brings kills multiple elderly  “fuck you.” That’s why. got his, taxes pay people get vaccinated. thought experiment, maybe would make sense require (some) grocery stores remain open 24/7. Hmmm wonder why.  even delivered another 5/6 months later still want there's still definitely market loss dad put ventilator today feel pain. wish nothing best. gonna lie dumbest thing I've read day. lack enforcement exactly root cause this. Brit here!


It well known fact country Queen immortal external life force feed on. Thats Prince Phillip looks way does. monarchy thousand years old man about. gonna enjoy watching people say death rate Coronavirus worth considering also point handful deaths may resulted vaccine proof vaccine taken.

Maybe cease enjoyment realize live planet, uncertainty public protracts current variants strain, increases likelihood new vaccine-resistant variants gaining foothold. fuck even already vaccinated.

We're together, get polarized antagonize other, suffer. ignorance public causes sadness personally. Stupid question: whole thing rehearsed beforehand? least planned? entire vaccination process planned beforehand tested. Weeks even vaccine. procedures set long first person got vaccine. still problems distribution registration. even want imagine going work sudden like,:""Here's vaccine, get going."" nobody knows do. catastrophe epic proportions.

Meanwhile whole ""free world"" basically either ignores comply rules, severely frowns - that's it. boggles mind.

When going start go medieval asses? Seriously, take one short walk day around quiet neighborhood, staying far possible everyone else, always folks wear mask. Mostly old white men, reason. that's one example - many ways rules broken.

Why laws, police, justice system, cannot enforce simple rules could prevent massive loss life? probably freaking F out. try even can't understand it. Covid different sickness I've ever experienced happening. Let's settle on.... People low chance resuscitated? undiagnosed covid April. pmp answer told probably rhabdomyolysis time. Fatigue cough still ongoing. comes brink, uh... month guess, sounds like really mean month super cereal time. *He told led psych ward* Nothing absolutely ""safe"". right circumstances die even due drinking cup Coca Cola. vaccine rate adverse reactions, testing makes sure rate low enough pros outweigh cons.

If possible ""prove safe"" gradually expanding three phase trial. logical otherwise hard proof, statistical proof, based sample. Naw, per-capita scary enough.  Mmm... like dead people. Oh nice, Palestine state convenient not. agree. makes zero sense me. Also makes difficult essential front line workers get shopping done. idea Tocilizumab happens work bradykinin storms hearing might cytokine storms helps feel bit better.

But we've reached extreme we'd rather talk death, know, proving ""right"" ""spreading awareness"" identifying ""good bad"". Getting things done become secondary.

We need pendulum swing back less talk, action. boggles mind we're already. true, also misses fact combinations mutations effects individual ones don’t thing is, won’t know personally affects unless catch virus doom gloom scenario playing head. Yea, people fall sick recover 100% ok there’s also significant percentage patients die it’s old unhealthy people. there’s significant number people short-term long-term side effects may killed thing life impacted varying ways it. 2% reported cases die it, percentage people bad side effects put statistics together form pretty grim outlook potential anyone falls ill Covid. Would made sense start pandemic, even first wave. point, virus spreading community anyway, limiting small number cases coming flights effective New Zealand.

Not would pointless now, strict lockdowns/vaccinations would benefit countries, look mandatory quarantines entry. fun note today's numbers, USA highest percentage population vaccinated outside Middle East. think highest world, suppose good enough now.

It hard catch Must great feeling Israeli right seeing country win vaccination Olympics. Except full year vaccination number off. Hey dont really know means either. seem like would cover expenses guy's initial visits, still alive. Reading hard There's thing prioritization slowing process, rather optimizing it, that's precisely what's happening vaccines.

Everyone laser focused every single person maybe got ahead line ""unfairly"" creating process rigid, even need can't get (due batch limitations).

We need prioritization. absolute prioritization. example mandate like ""at least 50% vaccines go towards prioritized groups"" allowing half administered whoever wants one, including wealthy people want pay fund effort scale people, not.

Instead trainwreck ""debate death"" gets when. Food Drug Administration spoken strongly changing dosing schedule. quit. quit needed money live something similar know restaurants staying open. saying functionally there's difference. pass someone working die, matter leisure activity? relate need money he's right. Actually, extreme cases Covid reported among test groups got vaccines actually promising news knocks level harsh cold. need speed vaccinations NOW.

You know limited manufacturing distribution logistics, right? anyone looked Canadians able get travel insurance right now? Long story short (Canadian) go Southern US late Spring 2020 dads death. able get travel insurance stipulation *if* get COVID anything related covered. took really stupid risk time emotionally weighed thought thoughtfully weighted. public time spent airports planes rest family members house dad hospice, but.... people seriously flying multiple airports vacationing without insurance?! $200,000 per claim average, varies depending severity necessity Zero chance. Olympics international event international audience, Japan screwed regardless, worldwide numbers anywhere close ""let's mass public event"" levels summer anyway.

And we're even discussing evolutionary pressure vaccine-resistant variants emerge slow trickle vaccination occurs (slow relative 7 billion people). Maybe context lost lockdowns India like US/UK strictly enforced police. curfews started coming lots police tested positive personnel running low. youre island pacific yes What's wrong camping? essentially isolating wilderness. Covid spread primarily breathed-out coughed-out aerosol rather sneeze-type droplets. Facemasks widely discredited Covid protection. recommended coupled mask. virus floats right around mask. Putin asked destroy America r/negativewithgold Please do! need 2nd Pfizer vaccine. say I'm Melbourne, Australia. Warrantless electronic surveillance allowed several pieces legislation several distinct pieces case law relating constitutional right privacy. sure everybody keen offer US legislative framework since original commenter Canada. know long strain here, could already major contribution well. number people here, would willingly let people die, can´t go out, job, sickening. 

I wonder people actually would make decision, to. would actually would go say: ""Millions die, sacrifice them, go dining go work. way: Screw health care workers, learned different job don´t like overrun sick people probably die too. sorry people die, hospitals completely overrun point, greater good."" 

This may sound extreme, actually talking about, decide open everything let thing run. 

And everyone says, economy took big hit, didn´t. Dow higher today Year ago. Bitcoins roof. economy bad work living, millionaires billionaires getting richer everyday. invested, instead buying bread stuff. 

As one already said, virus bad, society reacts it. 

When covid anything, showed cracks society riped wide open see everyone. Income Inequalty, health care, social system, education, name it, disfunctionality glory brought light us fix it. 

And doing? Nothing. average joe wants go back ordinary life. Dreaming better things come, actually something it. people die it, is, didn´t care before, didn´t care after. Screw everyone else, long **I** nice living. mentality crisis facing. slowly sinking everybodys mind. ...except literally Melbourne. Went 600+ cases day zero city 5 million people. Yes took couple months, work. Great film. Turns reality even weirder Hollywood could imagined President promoting faux cures people hoarding toilet paper things. wasn’t scientific study. done vaccines authorized. clearly response single case case pretty definitively prove death wasn’t due vaccine. 

This isn’t saying “hey vaccine safe” it’s “hey know fearmongering case person died getting vaccinated? Yeah, wasn’t vaccine”. Unfortunately, that’s effective study showing vaccine safe large numbers general public. Pfizer publicly announced US government nothing development vaccine. hurt Donny boys ego mean. civilisation profited back slaver black people slaved every single ethnicity put slavery recent industrialised slaver. Think Romans, Greeks, many European nations middle Eastern civilizations slaver. Asian civilizations slavery. Man really think logic hate humanity. Slavery still happen day even think them. kind funny twice faced people. like blacks slavery 100 years go slaver 2000 year ago 300? 400? 1000? close present day make end all. even thinking people put slavery date care victims. understand date still problems within society fight racism. way holding onto past coz unfortunately there's nothing change future learn past. Ever beard? know, right? like someone tired able drink drive.

That applies prevents harm coming others. Mask fatigue legitimate, showing face always result people's deaths. Apologies, mistook SA Brazil Rule Britannia Four men women got Brazil, according article. never rights  temporary privileges. lot world's population lives countries it'll even slower, lot Standard surgical masks useless airborne pathogens.

There always certain percentage (if small) people react negatively vaccine (or drug, food, or...). can't really ""disprove"" anything. anything, large sample enough, prove that, yes, people get sick die result. Slow spread, stop spread. title wrong. variant different UK SA, article say different Brazilian variant. fact, since came travelers Brazil, likely Brazilian variant.     landlocked countries? guess ye old arson charges time. - assuming, free check preferred news portal, story same).

Isn't 12 weeks equal 3 _months_? enough community spread theres probably much stop spread dont lock everyone inside months even years. real world, everyone cant #staythefuckhome years. easy sit reddit shit people luxury work home people delivering stuff door everyone luxury. it’s still incredibly difficult get tested there. states like New York tried idea worked well. 

General oversight catch extreme cases corruption. double output, need catch corruption occurring scale 50% worth it. sounds like Trump Administration turned extra 100 million [the month Pfizer vaccine proven highly wondering peer reviewed report. Thanks this. I'll certainly read released.

(the BNO/'Covid reinfection site' still full rubbish though..  +++unsubstantiated shit) Waste vaccine dose nearly dead royals  wear outside bc warms face AZ fail? You’re right, let’s trust existing healthcare system, already corrupt, right thing. many days potential exposure someone get tested ensure accurate results (lowest probability false negative/positive)? What? part elderly population? using elderly people guinea pigs already vast amount testing made. still important spread information without verifying true first, fucked admit move - mod even removed original comment. One guess newer, nastier mutation countries really testing for. covid fatigue Biontech repurposing production site Marburg (Germany). supposed start production February. bought site September Novartis . maybe gives timeframe long would take scale up. Yeah. took credit decisions worked well. Bcuz Trump. many elite politicians do. organize something Zoom?  Highly unlikely happen. It’s like they’re selling doses anything. They’re double triple checking everyone correct order. 

Learn logistics planning. Except narrative remains without statistic happened first popped head past reddit post. point stands Mostly cut fatalities, severe cases strain hospitals. Data shows older population likely die need hospital care. 

Many elderly still pretty mobile leave homes. restricted homes rely others care, become infected caretakers. -20 basically normal freezer temps

Most home freezers target -17 normally go -22 coldest settings. ever time put many eggs many baskets possible, right now. believe order price 100M ~$2B, drop fucking bucket. Sure 10 rich people 1 needed it? sees nobody people. “Antibody Christ”

“Amen” nursing homes residential care facilities account like 40% deaths virus spread like crazy settings they're usually under-resourced course shit tons people living building. healthcare workers vaccinated reduce strain hospitals keeping fully staffed. 

makes perfect sense vaccinate two groups first supply limited. we're probably gonna open everyone J&amp;J shot rolls out. opened general public get appointments booking past date we're still scaling supply. 

doesn't make much difference imo. thing make sense career-based priority Cuomo governors trying complicated beyond belief. open 65+ jab many at-risk individuals idea bad Japan, thought culture tended ‘safer’ masks don’t know enough properly make educated response Camping safe. think poorly chosen example. didn’t feel safe camping past summer, think due lack info back then. freaked us using public restrooms. 

I feel like messaging “off” whole time. say, “stay 6 feet apart,” think actually listening... stay 6 feet apart *from strangers* but, may still gather “*obviously could never infected*” close friends family. 

Likewise, tell young &amp; middle-aged people, “don’t spread virus... get you’ll probably fine.” millions people act little bit selfish (or totally selfish) bingo, are.  know, guy offers dead body, least polite take it.

Anyway, serious note, camping wilderness unsafe. use public transport (bus, boat, airplane) get there, that's unsafe part. Look like wants bad possible. decisions make sense. see ways. lot older people reliant upon younger people and/or one bring things go around exposing virus stores whatnot get needs met. Also, likely pre existing conditions; I’ve also known lot older people (65+) still enter workforce due financial issues. Thanks America lol. said, reason couldn’t get quickly gen pop. Honestly, distribution garbage. Would rather 10 people need 1 rich person doesn’t get 5 people need it? feelings, civic rights imply anything effectiveness vaccines? Like, reinfect someone got antibodies old fashioned way, mean could get past vaccine-induced antibodies? would manage effectively federal level? sure quite get hyperbole talking workers camping trips rare. Especially covid. hand, it’s probably keeping richies cutting line. never disagreed that, frustrates people pull figures nowhere try push narrative exactly did. people take seriously follow rules, yes. Cause actually kind right there. OP wrong one. vaccine prevent infection transmission. Republican dead last list get vaccine...just say cause know thought so. Arm bit sore, worse flu jab. 10/10, would recommend Yep even shared elevator, used quick succession irony comment incredible.

You know talking about. vaccine makes if/when catch it, extremely mild course without symptoms.

There absolutely evidence prevents infection transmission.

/hard sigh believe viruses carried without symptoms.

I got positive result back today. ""symptoms"" feeling little bit fatigued last 5-7 days, mild dry cough bathroom issues. went get test abundance caution (I work closed door/recirculated air environment people around) based coworkers starting become symptomatic 10 days ago.

I called sick work Monday, got test. bit surprised results came back positive. wife went got test today - Negative. Thankfully - we've taking seriously home, I'm one forced go work. zero contact anyone outside ourselves. 

I'm staying locked office next week half. I'm still skeptical positive result, cannot life understand one sleeping next past 7-10 days. God help us Super Bowl Super Spreader.  non disclosure agreements, no. NHS funding increased last decade. Cool  bad, thanks. ridiculous ignore half equation.

The first half ""how dangerous thing X infection rates"". second half ""how essential society thing X is"".

Would argue restaurants essential schools? stop restaurants, thousands restaurant owners/employees suffer, government programs financially aid mitigate impact. restaurant industry predominant component economy.

However tens millions children left nowhere go parents kinds professions (including essential, like police, healthcare, etc) work? mention happens education grades. countries lot anti-vaxxers, fault governments medical companies. 

Which also irrelevant point everyone vaccinated next six months.

The question quickly virus develop escape mutations enough people acquire immunity really poorly written article seems naming lot assumptions. plenty studies refute this. 

Looking states weekly Covid report lists outbreaks, it’s crystal clear schools childcare lead pretty minimal spread see 1-5 max cases schools. huge numbers 20-100 Costco, amazon, Walmart, prisons care facilities. Seems clear hell it’s workplaces congregate living. 9 months later Maan honestly vaccination priority crap doesnt make sense me. understand prioritizing healthcare workers first, rolled gen pop.

Life's hard us right now. nonsense. cannot close country several weeks months required. many things cannot close circumstances. country even considered this. yup read single story LA? reason collapse hospital systems . know added 300,000 cases 4,000 deaths day. time try minimize impact virus long gone.

You also know requiring travel papers like visa passport necessary everywhere. can’t even get plane another state US without ID.

Maybe learn little start spewing hysterical nonsense. need calm down. Update: Robert Koch Institute released news we're getting average 270k vaccinations per day last week.

Like said, they're usually pretty transparent, rate we're still looking 2 years substantial numbers people vaccinated among German population 83 million. Nope, bother re-writing statement. stands.

LA hospitals fill bursting every January. children cant travel probably wont able either. 1 number horrendous result result directly vaccine. Especially perfectly healthy would loved otherwise. top comment? spike protein consists 1270 amino acids 9 changed. 

Here explanation man Ugur Sahin, part mutations starts 38  Ron's mind succeeded, that's sad thing.

Success measured dollars cents. Correlation doesn’t equal causation. fact, coincidence doesn’t equal causation either. One first paragraphs article: deaths increase years, annual rise fatalities expected. 2020 numbers amount jump 15%, could go higher deaths month counted.   would mark largest single-year percentage leap since 1918, tens thousands U.S. soldiers died World War hundreds thousands Americans died flu pandemic. Deaths rose 46% year, compared 1917.

I see problems here. don’t need wear masks outdoors. Passing someone sidewalk doesn’t result transmission unless one cough directly another’s face.

Transmissions occurring sustained indoor maskless contact. rate, people caught virus they'll able get vaccine. parents, 80, Charlotte NC getting first vaccination shots tomorrow. Yes right course. However, often problem grey rather black white. situation present vaccines going bucket. ideal would go next people queue turn ftom anywhere locality in, say, 30 minutes. half way house would vaccines go charitable donor NHS benefits, UK numbers vaccinated increases rather stays lower due throwing bucket.

No.  attitude exactly West still huge issue pandemic. locking mean lock down, means lock harder longer later.

The US spend billion extra secure doses, especially company offering. Ie it’s fucking table, get it.

The worst outcome would US vaccine surplus send countries unfortunately may received yet. understand fascination ""Is different strain?"". Perhaps would make difference vaccines/analysis.

 But, I'm curious many people sick positive.. felt better.. months later.. got sick positive again. gf trained nurse now, 9 months, suddenly getting letters government return work. Problem waiting get back country first (she's hometown I'm going find job, especially abroad). yea anyway, Japanese government certainly concerned. don’t work Pfizer, work manufacturer producing component one vaccines issues getting materials manufacturing labs. Hell, haven’t able get size L nitrile gloves since ~June. remind cold put many folks hospital, though lost used N analogy. SMH. read numbers case counts ball park mention. However, true everyone would infected would reached herd immunity - real data support reporting high. 

The CDC calling something called burden - see attached time period 20 million cases reported USA - CDC says burden 91 million - numbers 3.5x higher confirmed cases seems read. thing over, refrigerated trailers? sell them, add warning used body storage? True it’s probably low risk, difficult elected officials shelter place like everyone else travel vacations? supposed setting example. Travel virus spreading. course can't rush conclusions want everyone vaccinated. working extra, hours working understaffed patient load have. aren’t don’t back seat drive. nurses providers need time rest decompress. aren’t slaves, lack providers working even OT reason vaccinated yet. valid criticism article using different datasets trying draw comparisions.

We cant look clickbait like ignore fits line agenda, red herring.

Really interesting - proposal based using surgery setting, wonder applications prevent/treatment. know nothing biology danger overuse might harm beneficial bacteria? Nice! link full report? It’s small minority think. Texas large percentages nurses refusing vaccine. need better plan keep lining moving someone declines. Well, hard lockdowns, point idk going efficient. countries real lockdowns nipped problem bud.  43000 people study started *less year ago*.

We still don’t know happen 2, 3 even 10+ years road. It’s novel technology never used humans even large scale clinical trial year -hence it’s authorized EUA. Saying “vaccine side effects always show early all” doesn’t necessarily apply mRNA vaccines traditional vaccines. 

You keep saying “believe science!” want, actual nurses even doctors skeptical. Personally, think risk likely worth end pandemic, understand people coming dismissing concerns isn’t going help anything. everything right. Mass fatality incident - wiki.

Although somewhat relative term widely accepted number fatalities define mass fatality incident, generally recognized number fatalities exceeds local city county's resource capabilities causing request assistance, mutual aid, neighboring jurisdictions, term applies.

So nothing ""mass"" loosely means request aid. garbage term. mess vaccine. originally going go higher age guess probably one reasons local health departments thrown off. last minute announcement found time public. guess they're going would likely fatal cut back deaths hospitalization. makes sense. would say either people can't stay home likely spread like grocery store employees. hope going bigger mess somehow.  kidding. everyone talks *equity* painfully slow manner, taking advantage it. Audience stadiums needed. haven’t read comments, work place staff owners black, customers black, I’m white person, one wearing mask. think virus vaccine white man’s conspiracy don’t trust anything it. 50% infections long term damage stupid wrong.

There going big problem long term damage COVID, arguments incorrect actively undermines factually incorrect discussion. deniers point arguments like time argue whole thing overblown, giving fuel.

The fact problem make partially correct finding ridiculously hyperbolic claim find. means damaging correct argument. Speaking manipulation recently saw post employer Facebook. Telling every one stay home follow rules like them. kids wear masks playing kids outside (they not, never even saw wash hands). relatives eat together Christmas (they did). 

I respect person teacher husband police man, eye opener. kept quiet fb.

It reminded Canadian government employees taking vacation telling people stay home... Agreed.I see people manipulate truth save time energy help others pandemic. pandemic far over, like climbing dragon steps China, think close ending something else pops up. think happens everywhere.

From see here, mask compliance relatively quite high US generally, although places others. 80 percent compliance quite high generally, even given everywhere mandate. guess Northwest great deal higher given culture mandates. personal experience, even taking hikes people pass other, even plenty space, seen someone inside grocery store restaurant without 1918 life expectancy dropped [50.9 2020 increased. fact staggering drop life expectancy 1918 overall deaths comparable back less 1/3 population says insanely deadly Spanish flu says COVID.

This article fear-mongering crap. reason use raw numbers instead population-adjusted rate unless trying spread fear mislead. God hate knowing attitude. Yep. certainly nutty doctors (USA) percentage nurses taking believe wild shit astounding. Turns training put doctors good reason.

Remember hospitals try cut corners Physician's Assistant Nurse Practitioner (who pay much less money to) provide care. PAs NPs place healthcare field frightening states providing power doctors little oversight. Interesting anti-cancer anti-COVID-19 drugs/treatments/responses sometimes similar. I'd imagine people timeline vaccine produced nearly quickly did. Optimistic estimates since pandemic began it'll take minimum year one developed.

Perhaps people mentally prepared going last much longer may need to. 0p day stay home activity cuts risk infection 100% say people rough spot, hope works! think possibly legitimate idea. hear out.

there's reason vaccinate high risk first. besides likely impacting death/hospitalization rate, even half way decent vaccine one side effects better virus itself.

by time given shots high risk people going pretty damn clear good vaccine (even wrongly think right now), said, jerk i'd ask odds dying covid odds dying vaccine, actually quote reasonable numbers i'd listen them, repeating facebook drivel talk them. people wearing masks! think many would happy locking country outbreaks Arkansas North Dakota.

Remember idea quarantining Connecticut, New Jersey, New York came President shot right away, agreed upon governors months later. think confusion arises looking 'life expectancy birth' life expectancy later age.

You right life expectancy birth ~80 lot people die young age lot people die along way. get latter age calculate 'life expectancy x' quite common higher life expectancy birth. fit enough lucky enough make 80 life expectancy 80 higher life expectancy birth. know exactly number believe 90.8 i.e. 10.8 extra years.

I hope makes sense. think perfectly natural people hesitant skeptical, matter profession. problem occurs ever becomes denialism impervious contrary information months ahead. don’t 2020 numbers yet.

I'm hoping get US start selling whoever wants it. population also tripled since then. Obviously need even strict lockdowns. hell even point pope saying safe think, could obviously seeing whole picture, possible herd immunity threshold eventually going come play addition population density. fact vaccinating quickly amazing cant imagine you’ll see impact month later. already training. Smh don’t guys know Covid doesn’t spread 6 pm tell to? Concluding Paragraph:

We hypothesise SARS‐CoV‐2 infection triggered anti‐tumour immune response, described infections context high‐grade non‐Hodgkin putative mechanisms action include cross‐reactivity pathogen‐specific cells tumour antigens natural killer cell activation inflammatory cytokines produced response infection.  need vaccination site every block every neighborhood ASAP, vaccinating 24/7 know one, trained nurse thinks vaccines evil happy lip fillers botox. Plus asymptomatic cases. 

Nationwide, might around 150 million mark. Thanks answer! Florida's numbers compare California's Michigan's? states/countries strict others, probably joking rate would take year vaccinate everyone that’s good People really consider insane year 1918 comparison 2020 making fear-mongering Spanish flu comparisons:

The US population 1918 103M compared 330M today. Using raw numbers comparison disingenuous since simple virtue growing population stagnating life expectancy, every year expected record-setting year deaths. age-adjusted death rate dropped 1% 2019, life expectancy rose six weeks 78.8 years, CDC reported.

The age-adjusted death rate rose 2275.9 per 100k 1917 2541.6 1918. Life expectancy fell 50.9 39.1. 

That life-expectancy part important. life-expectancy rises even though death rate also rises, means majority dead people statistically close death. would excellent nobody died COVID, heartless say less deadly Spanish flu.

I fear ever pandemic like Spanish Flu, people literally know handle it. COVID happened early 1900s, would barely footnote history books. Today enough grind society halt. definitely wouldnt hesitate First article comes form Montreal Gazette, world renowned newspaper - blog. article trying misinform anyone - whether died 1 dose gives 50 percent change fact fellow residents sit wait see they’ll similar outcome already fully vaccinated. Pfizer agrees based phase 3 trials. agenda science. People kidding think cancelled.

I know. bummer forcibly held.

Objectively, absolutely ridiculous hold olympics current world situation. people plainly asked ""There virus SARS category spreading prominently around world. olympics held situation?"" vast majority would probably answer ""No.""  actual answer already bought enough doses every American want put eggs basket. far easy Monday morning quarterback decisions know vaccines succeeded ran troubled. EU debate right countries.

Canada bought enough every citizen 10 doses (5 courses) vaccine hedge work. We're sending whatever's extra countries can't negotiate afford it.  USA could well done xenophobe office. problem countries, nobody even proposing things talks about. live Poland, come Czech Republic watch situation countries detail - them, tracing systems completely gave up. governments mostly concerned ""plans easing restrictions"" even fight current virus, fight variant problematic future even table. None simply going happen thus attempts squash new variant elsewhere EU pointless, endless border closures within EU tenable. admit coronavirus deadly (Spanish) flu name disorder? North Dakota wasteland that's Japan smart enough make pandemic anime exposing real potential harm viruses even happened, yet done worse China, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand. Shame. Yes u need data oh heres vaccine perfectly safe!! Oh way wont accept liability it! u confident something u back ... 5yrs maybe see know side effects must pockets country kind herd immunity taking hold point, no? North Dakota outrageously control outbreak fall they're back baseline...surely herd immunity, no?

Before anyone bursts artery: No, I'm advocating herd immunity strategy. bought vaccines companies. time Pfizer could deliver 2nd batch 100M, we'd enough vaccines companies already So, background (as relates doctor said). degenerative neuromuscular disease causes significant weakness entire body, including heart lungs. 

While I'm otherwise healthy currently experiencing cardiac respiratory issues, highly susceptible someone would likely higher chance fatality caught Covid. 

Generally, even get sick something like common cold, tends severe lasts longer other, otherwise healthy people.

Doctor basically said that, condition, known side effects vaccine, unpleasant, would exponentially safer risking Covid. 

In summary, vaccine less likely kill permanently maim, whereas Covid risking death exacerbating disability.

In terms friends/family/colleagues, received lot similar input concerns. husband Navy Corpsman paramedic got out, lot friends acquaintances medical professionals. 

He keeps lot friends stayed medical fields, including someone currently physician's assistant NYC hospital (she pretty intense horror stories things seen Covid ward--listening speak deaths attended unreal). adamant everyone take vaccine take it.

So, spoke length worries health safety, input advice he's received people trusts, weighed risks vaccine side effects vs. covid. Vaccine wins every time.

Additionally, I'm therapist (LMFT) contacts provide mental health services hospital/medical settings.

Basically everyone know working settings briefed risk vs. reward, seems like stage vaccine development implementation, concensus incredibly safe. 

One former colleagues' father immunologist (and clinical psych. research local university) sent pretty detailed breakdown vaccine trials findings. 

Basically, Moderna vaccine trial consisted 30,000 individuals severe side effects occurred less 3% individuals enrolled trial...so, 1k people 30k, side effects generally persisted 2 3 days. 

Looking numbers, considering vaccine offers 95% immunity Covid, pending research suggesting vaccine also likely effective mutating strains, really made sense bite bullet go it. 

So did.

I hope helpful! person black racist.

We good name former ""UK variant"" though: B.1.1.7. SA variant still usable name.

There another difference also though, UK SA races, Chinese is. Mainly coincidence right North Dakota also well vaccination effort relative states.

In 4-6 weeks would surprise could statistically parse impact vaccination variation state infection rates.

Israel also good test case start see declining infections/hospitalizations soon. 

## Abstract

While several clinical immunological parameters correlate disease severity mortality SARS-CoV-2 infection, work remains identifying unifying correlates coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) used guide clinical practice. Here, examine saliva nasopharyngeal (NP) viral load time correlate patient demographics, cellular immune profiling. found saliva viral load significantly higher COVID-19 risk factors; correlated increasing levels disease severity showed superior ability nasopharyngeal viral load predictor mortality time (AUC=0.90). comprehensive analysis immune factors cell subsets revealed strong predictors high low saliva viral load, associated increased disease severity better overall outcomes, respectively. Saliva viral load positively associated many known COVID-19 inflammatory markers IL-6, IL-18, IL-10, CXCL10, well type 1 immune response cytokines. Higher saliva viral loads strongly correlated progressive depletion platelets, lymphocytes, effector cell subsets including circulating follicular CD4 cells (cTfh). Anti-spike (S) anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG levels negatively correlated saliva viral load showing strong temporal association could help distinguish severity mortality COVID-19. Finally, patients fatal COVID-19 exhibited higher viral loads, correlated depletion cTfh cells, lower production anti-RBD anti-S IgG levels. Together results demonstrated viral load – measured saliva nasopharyngeal — dynamic unifying correlate disease presentation, severity, mortality time. screwed thanks governor incompetent indifferent. Literally 8% state infected, every coronavirus case went 1 person individually. soaring right now. sad pathetic see. Almost every county red, area dark red zone. I'm upset everything here. delta 69/70? helps virus escape detection flow assay, could escape detection immune systems? particular, immune systems already trained coronaviruses lack immune plasticity - ie old people. already English. Bruh. Ok buddy people wonder LA bad. why. Lol first paragraph article:


“New research suggests Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine protect mutation found two more-contagious variants coronavirus erupted Britain South Africa.”

What exactly misleading? soon phase 1 phase 2 done everything back normal since that's deaths understanding situation Quebec possibly read article. Biden suggesting delay doses rather release doses. make sure 2nd doses available allotted amount time insuring supply remains intact... risky gamble fair given situation US.

Quebec saying delaying second doses indefinitely. literally cancelled people’s follow appointments. Pfizer come said sound science insure cause adverse effects.

Call crazy go manufacturer actual studied dosage one. I'm honestly probably still rarity even amongst scientists doctors, strange reason, seems past months people starting come around facts. know yet honestly people learned take safe bet prevent things happening past year, beyond saving. think lot population way, including scientists. act virus going mutate beyond vaccines least try prevent situation arising... don't, almost certainly arise. Currently, letting virus ravage population mutate, almost year now. idk anyone thinks otherwise there, trying ""not alarmist"", I'm realistic. frustrating Get vaccine brrrrt gun! vaccine side effects way overblown.

Mild headache goes away Ibuprofen, sore arm less sore set side-lat raises, whole family.

Those things could said 6 months ago (in summer 2020) people would thought would realistic thoughts. 2021 experiencing sky high covid numbers.

So we'll see...

I would make bit pessimistic prediction:

2021: Year packed covid.\
2022: Going back simple things like eating going movie. events returning.\
2023: Full return big events.  Fauci says open season vaccines April. he's optimistic month, still gives plenty time athletes get vaccinated. problem siphoning vaccine Olympians professional athletes reached place line. slow burn virus believes it, Covid loves false normalcy One dose 50% immunity. I’m sure people getting 100/2 = 50. It’s much, much better that.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* people give damn day 1. Lol. I've cut ties handful friends thing. state live in? We're start vaccinating teachers city Thursday school completely remote March return date planned yet lines 10x longer, easy give 100 shots hundred people 1,000 line 10,000, cities need large infrastructure auditoriums sports arenas universities complete task Cheers, yeah curious effects..whether people get kind confidence first jab...because number UK keep rising.

Don't want similar things Australia spectators? That's I'm interested depends county, know 75+ starting counties early upcoming week. 👀 haven’t got official flare scientist claim every second post? side effects lockdown take years general population's life side effects covid will. scary read. Yeah I'm sure entirety US hard work looking.. Again, understand sounds hard US countries. 

When area lockdown pulled fined legitimate reason out. guess helps people decent follow rules people way. Healthcare workers scientists.

A large part doctors are, that's besides point. need scientist realize vaccines one safest forms medical intervention have. People easily look studies statistics never that. Instead read conspiracy nut's post social media swallow without semblance scrutiny whatsoever.

Most vaccines really high NNH(number needed harm) low NNT(number needed treat). words, many doses administered one person harmed doses need administered one positive outcome. true many drugs used modern medicine, sometimes questionable effects. Drugs I'm sure healthcare workers administering everyday work. Can't send kaiju breathe fire it? Camden Town Saturday busy ever. real kick gut considering busy nurses many colleagues redeployed services cover vaccinations staff illness. Even city, reason two dozen smaller pop-up clinics worse 3-4 large hubs.  right leadership thought would happened. still machine Obama approved make 1 million n95 masks per day. Hopefully Biden administration change course. NYC 100 times population density. literally walk front door find eligible people minutes city. 5 free articles/mo, least that's back March. many things wrong statement:

1) That’s total life cycle ~50 years. would need divide number 100 draw equivocal comparison.

2) Making sure realize that’s cost program, cost “one fighter.”

3) cost estimate 2070 USD, you’d need adjust stat article adjust 50 years inflation.

4) F-35 platform designed replace United States Air Force’s A-10 F-16, United States Navy’s F/A-18, United States Marine Corps F/A-18 AV-8B Harrier. Meaning immense optimization potential savings maintaining mixed aged fighter/combat aircraft.

5) spending $1.727T create $1.727T. fact opposite, money employ untold amounts people directly indirectly. Additionally, military research almost always technological windfalls society; see Internet.

6) F-35 hardly useless stabilizing defense important ever since Cold War. Weight loss literally less food going throat. need workout. 15 minute walk, cleaning apt/house etc enough physical activity.  Boooo! Quite elderly people retirement savings (some real pensions!) and/or investments spend money everything groceries medical care travel entertainment; money they'd saved working lives released back circulation. think want look real economic data making statement. I'd bet bottom dollar ask 40% holdouts technology behind Pfizer vaccine is, well 10% would actually correctly identify mRNA.

We discussing health workers here, general population. would imagine people healthcare industry information average man/woman street. Makes think basic education might actually go long way convert 40%...maybe. naive?!

Right now, vaccinating little month. would imagine bit longer period observation, people comfortable either mRNA inactivated virus vaccine.  months ago Mexico 10% fatality rate, around 8% now. They're obviously testing capacity, even 15th largest GDP world. olympics 100% moving forward. discussion debate I’m sure delusion coming from? No, basically identical lockdown happened US UK, seem follow rules better police enforce them. full lockdown since beginning pandemic. (You could still work, go get groceries, walk/excersise, states still allowed limited number visitors even). Since seen lock downs areas hotspots contained lifted. 

States also closing borders community transmission gets control. 2009 pH1N1 vaccine, Pandemrix, caused many-fold increase narcolepsy among children.

Yes, cases narcolepsy presented within month two vaccination. Guillen Barre also happens shortly vaccination. 

No one saying vaccines can’t cause serious side effects, side effects aren’t going pop blue years vaccine left system, big thing people worried about. EU member states worse United States Britain based chart article. surpassed Texas past week so. addition, he's willing talk subjects religious leaders haven't. I'm sure high ranking member Evangelical church, South Baptist church would make comment (positive not) COVID, mask mandates, vaccines, etc., we'd it. sure? go [world health sort Tot cases/ 1M pop says Cali Texas. [Read concern people always seeing problem people

It's not. problem government corporations shady people trust them

don't pretend pro-science. Like me, idea what's vaccine can't independently verify it. take governement+corporations word

it's pro ant-science, whether believe people control 'science'

i take vaccine without hesitation Good. point vaccine vaccinate many people possible. want person new Variant. New Strain. strain. Strain like covid 19 (SARS-COV-2) Coronavorus family. different original SARS Strain. Different Mers Strain. 
We facing new Variants new Strain Covid19. wish title said ""New Variant"" instead. ehh... 0 system children automatically inherit goverment one responsible deaths. topple government could let live, even wanted to. That's problem absolutism. survive need voluntarily abandon absolutism, like many monarchs did. entirely chance spike mutations seen far sufficient escape vaccines. There's something like 20 epitopes antibodies spike protein spike going mutate lot order achieve immune escape. probably happen, also come cost overall fitness resultant virus much lower R0, lethality, ability infect cells, lower viral load. happen population vaccinated exposed antibodies high R0 current wild-type virus R(t) suppressed much lower due human immunity. favor less fit / lower R0 mutations result immune escape. Yeah saw 2018, 2020 deaths 2018 (considering upcoming update) although January February 2020 fewer deaths January February 2018, obviusly predicted entire year fewer deaths. came virus NYC exponentially larger public health system.

North Dakota figure get temperature sensitive vaccine people sparsely distributed, much harder Archived link: Scared? Why? Many must like believe fact nursing home residents accounted nearly 40% deaths since start pandemic. They'll claim old people died deaths lower average year (they won't). Deniers move goalposts. 43,000 people tested final Pfizer trial alone, they're testing healthcare worker Anywhere, USA.

That’s well good, original trial wasn’t big enough reveal rare side effects like allergic reactions they’ve seeing. first batch people get drug it’s approved always tracked closely clinical trial give solid answers really rare side effects. center partned cvs administer vaccine, ever rumour provide staff administer vaccine, staff nurses but, nurses allowed give meds staff medical care staff based legal/insurance/liability reasons. something hear updates evey weeks. everyone eventually infected point become familiar virus (or vaccination course), could severity disease future infections different strain milder? 
I thought whole issue coronavirus novel.
If becomes endemic different dominant strain year generally milder symptoms, we're looking flu like situation right? Maybe 2023/24.  think nurses need learn vaccines work know stick arm. lot things need covered nursing school, spending lot time covering minute science behind vaccines work seems like waste time, unless scientist working vaccine field. Otherwise probably get overview vaccines us know understand, even cursory knowledge still tons anti-vaxxers country. Yes, intention there. curse enough information/knowledge make online psuedoscientific explanations seem like make sense, enough knowledge understand pseudoscience. 

e.g. popular antivax theory spike protein mRNA ""regions look like placental protein"" they're worried antibodies spike protein cause body attack placenta impact female fertility, basically bogus ""similarity"" basically slightly better random chance (anyone runs bunch BLAST alignments know) placental proteins derived retroviral proteins long time ago evolution, certainly enough antibodies work covid spike protein go attack placenta. suspect things going open way sooner, though it’s safe I'll happy Congress approves Biden's proposed $2 $3 trillion stimulus package. work ltc facility gotten vaccine yet, however iv heard mental health centers . seems selective who's getting vaccines such. Mask outside near people good. close people tell horror stories unmasked people outside? wear mask I'm walking kids generally we're near anyone else unless go store busy park. I'm going wear mask outside open one around, like air toxic. CDC's guidelines really seem concerned unless close, maskless contact people 15 minutes; certainly pass sidewalk night (if even encounter someone) less that. give info. coworkers. One felt awful enough call 2 days row, one felt horrible one day, another 2 days awful diarrhea. I’ve fine sore arm fatigue (but I’m fatigued often anyway 💁‍♀️so knows even related). everyone easy go it, us got Lucky unlucky depending swing it. economy! Currently nursing school yes teach us vaccines necessarily made. I’d assume would pharmaceutical background nursing background. Parity Moderna think former CEO head Warp Speed. Upper fudge limit 280mil...so...yea. disgrace Almost 2 million people dead. “The kawaiivirus doom us all.” even celebrate? part. deserve automatically awarded 2032 Olympics. fair. One thing always tell saner vax skeptics: really matter. time get turn, hundreds thousands would months. We'd clearer image surprise reactions.  think delusional 2022 then?

What find zika ebola next year world overreacts again? believe fairly obvious home workouts, certainly help, be-all, end-all people like make out. Unless thousands dollars spend good equipment space put it, ability exercise home necessarily limited. gyms thing.

I stand assertion America whole generally healthier less obese, would lot less severe. Depression kill too. saying. nothing worsens depression really issues you’re like isolated losing job. really doesnt. nurse knows jack shit virology Conservatives proudly displaying ignorance economics work

Human capital adds value economy whether skilled unskilled labor

Dead people = less economic output economic dysfunction sheer shock economic system value existing labor pool wiped calamity

But, again, conservatives never gave shit value human life COVID-19 pandemic chance beat money society like loot pinata cash government assistance record profits

We could've mitigated slowing economic activity reducing profits temporary period time providing government assistance, wealthy greedy fucks keep economy going full steam make steal profit margins postponed back may/June stopped going there. Even back then, people worried summer 2022 weddings!!

Not worth stress go anymore. even close.  So, also one whose abysmally poor response we’re past 400k deaths US. Cool, checking. study Brazil gargling 5 times day Listerine reduces viral loads covid patients. get covid definitely going this. less virus swallow less system. wish would get consistent message make sensible logical.

Fauci telling country wear masks 100 days inauguration really helpful everyone worried we'll get day 75 he'll say 100 days.

Just like ""get vote"" ""get vaccine"" messages. Reach out, run ads, tell people make plan, figure schedule people ahead time, put bright smiley face balloons butterflies it, get celebrities take shots publicly say awesome is, etc. PR campaign. would far good scare tactics shifting goal posts. need get vaccine doses arms whatever takes. need support vaccine manufacturing anyway can. Everything else way lower priority. That’s exactly said. younger people hospitalized need lockdown hospitals aren’t overwhelmed.

I didn’t mention mortality.

Is comment hard understand? seems clear direct me. Infection rates incredibly high ND last quarter 2020, quite likely herd immunity effects impact now. That's fine, testing rushed shortcuts taken.

And 'very new' relative: CRISPR established quite long time really disheartening see ""follow science"" people suddenly turn soft anti-vaxxers. read clinics seeing 80% healthcare employees turn vaccine, saying want guinea pig (even though incredibly robust clinical trials). subreddit shows tons vaccine skepticism, supposed science-based subreddit. Haven’t economists always done that? also said variants we’ve determining infections coming too. mutations going scary, good we’ve learnt track genomic sequencing Well, different people would different, considered delusional. I'm cautious person nature, always follow preventative principle. personally, country's leader institute completely locked border 1st March last year considered delusional. Oh well, things happen, often way hope don't. show study result many people got knocked vaccine placebo groups despite told use two forms protection. 

Also orchiditis menstrual abnormalities respectively short long term effects covid. would worry noticeable gonad effects like understand airports shut Thanksgiving Christmas. made sense me. number call make appointments website? can't seem find it. Health care really largely irrelevant. Statistically, people recovering home without medical care whatsoever. advanced state health care explains lower mortality rate COVID.

(Not COVID downplayer there, someone likes people sides get facts right.) TLDR: prevailing culture stupid needs change. would. I'm saying right now. last update 7.7 almost 24 hours ago. says updated top. Source? Simple answer everyone's response vaccine, shots, different. get symptoms, don't, mild, others severe. see less posts involving states? Getting sick long get 70"" TV ill happy lol /s. police enforce them

Maybe that's matters. Olympics impacted coca cola purchase many slots. trying say I'm anti-vax since I've gotten many shots past. 

Clinical trials said, actual global administering. 

I'll take chances, thanks calling silly. number shots administered went 7.7 million 8.02 million past hours. sure data collected seems updating often now. idea, probably till spring summer, maybe fall. We'll see hospitalizations deaths drop cases vulnerable vaccinated.  bumps winter olympics, world cup (which may may winter instead) etc. makes sense. 

When cases start drop? Yea that’s point stupid part Western mindset general American one particular everything problem.

And clear case mindset self-defeating. smell come back later day? heads up, everyone's sense smell weaker morning. I'd still quarantine till get negative test though. think result ND anything well, rather many cases achieved beginnings Herd Immunity. 1/7th population confirmed + many get tested. either live evidence-based reality live fantasy-based reality things like “feelings premonitions” real. might, many strains might also save us fate constantly plagued COVID, like new flu. Probably everyone got it. used month? There's 0 chance virus use month ago  know hell got virus yet. Seems inevitable will. course, could got asymptomatically may never known. #I think US needs one two things:
- __Harm Reduction:__ Open businesses controlled people go things. Something like monitored movie theaters, arcades, bowling alleys people activities masks on. Food drinks prohibited, reservations required, social distancing, sanitation, masks enforced. Offer outdoor gathering pods spaced 10 feet apart caution tape number people controlled. way people safer outlet something instead resorting private indoor gatherings masks, distancing, gathering limits can’t won’t enforced.
- __Selfish Reasons Stay Home:__ state/city thinks risk high open anything, need provide selfish reason stay home gather (ie. money), enforcement make sure people don’t gather, things people home. Pay Netflix provide free 2-month subscription code people register contact tracing app. Offer $500 check every month households don’t get ticketed violating COVID restrictions. Break COVID restrictions, goes checks you. Offer $2,500 “stay home bonus” check household doesn’t get ticketed COVID throughout next year go ALL. FREAKING. OUT. outings, travel, gatherings pandemic comes end. I've proven studies 100% accurate predictions year. dox myself, however, convince listen expertise org/person filed stay? literally anyone file document public agency, beauty democracy. name chemical harm placenta development? Trials show antibodies 99% participants.

That's actual efficacy. That's measured. Xmas surge hospitals hit another week, generally takes 3 weeks hit hospitals, 2 weeks cases. That's dedication! Mad respect.  I’m saying one better other, every reputable epidemiologist public health expert specifically cited vaccine logos I’ve problems sparsely populated rural states drip best part! likelyhood catching COVID eating pizza made someone without mask basically zero. Even walking store wearing mask picking pizza, presuming spend less minute store, still pretty low secondary attack rate 16% households (with symptoms), household transmissions high?

Source: Ahhh, must read hospitalizations. Thank you! reported one. One vaccinated volunteers oxygen level drop 92% brief duration, meet criteria severe infection. 

""There 10 severe cases COVID-19 observed trial, nine cases occurring placebo group one BNT162b2 vaccinated group.'"" volunteer require hospitalization, AFAIK made uneventful recovery. Moderna, Oxford, Sputnik, CanSino reported 0 severe infections, definition ""severe infection"" might differ. Bloomberg updated 300k dose increase yesterday. Part probably states updating sunday fine since reporting key. part lack urgency distributing vaccines weekend completely unacceptable. Impossible know playing bigger role bad Sunday number. self-isolate must absolute nightmare. 

The person replied wrong. live Tokyo part year.  pretty easy avoid people Tokyo - certain parts crowded.  easily go outside close others many part Tokyo.  true density high, places like grocery stores may crowded.   

The numbers still low, even Tokyo. stay home, Tokyo relatively safe, need figure safe way get food home. country already pilot project vaccinate inmates federal prisons general public law abiding citizens also correctional officers inside prisons. opinion have, science shows increase mask wearing correlates decreased transmission. Number mutations directly proportional number people infected. stay filed FDA stop emergency authorization Pfizer vaccine. stated document one things vaccine known prevent mammalian placentas developing. placenta/no baby. Also, Bill Gates' foundation gave tons money Bionet (I may company name wrong). tons research. document read all, 40 plus pages. hesitant getting covid vaccine.  antivaxxer - get flu shots annually. argue son feelings it. feel soul good thing get. asked brother please get it. wait see. 63 years old, socially distance wear mask shop. many bad things happen vaccines lifetime long term effects known. decide get it, swayed towards moderna shot. cant wait people antisocial personality disorders stop considered heroes. hope get help need . Don’t forget, pharmacist recently left 500 doses vaccine room temperature order ruin them. believed vax would rewrite person’s DNA. WTF?

We need find sure fire way merge book learning, common sense critical thinking skills. Bullshit.  states authority think best. WVa did.  Bureaucrats covering ass getting job done.  

They bunch doses.  doses gettin arms, them.  ""it's feds"" ""we need bigger budget"".  Makes want go pol pot civil servants.  Figuratively speaking course. Pope dissing stupid people time now. Love dude, he's mincing words. say listen epidemiologists virologists. sciency doctors Vaccine rollouts speeding up! We'll likely hit 1M vaccinated per day next week week after. unfortunate vaccine hit middle holidays, even though important job people going take days anyway. actually tried it? 

You need gym cardio. comfortable exposed weather, going outside works FINE.

Strength bit difficult home, also doable. Anyone shape they're increased risk COVID benefit simple stuff. /r/bodyweightfitness advanced routines need special equipment, maybe pullup bar less 50 bucks. 

Gyms, hand, great places spread COVID right now. People breathing heavily, sharing equipment often working right next space limited. Stfu. know well disgusting pieces shit accumulated wealth thru time allows compounded today. 
And still stole shite Hong Kong till 1990. Wake fuck Lmao gimme space vaccine. Yes. It’s Internet forum u knew impacted family day robbed family members murdered wouldn’t say it’s fucking silly. (if sarcastic)

If USA whole death rate per capita ND, nearly 600k people would dead already.  Probably taking action mitigate problem.

But traveller test negative flight become positive flight, pick transit point, become positive quarantine. soon new variants everywhere. numbers rise overseas, numbers rise hotel quarantine. Hopefully mitigation methods prove effective.  alarm raises someone remarkably stupid could get career. 

In time I’ve five covidiots scream asked wear mask store. Two wearing scrubs time. Damn, hoping grow third leg. penile spines? heard thing vaccinated women. 2.5x people died ND/SD North Carolina per capita basis, 1,774 1,792 died per million people ND SD compared 721 per million NC according worldometer. way people infected Dakotas. 

I think natural immunity infections urban areas ND SD reached significant enough level slow spreading. entirety USA death per capita rate SD would 600k death right now.  you... upset family getting vaccinated?

Thanks stay safe. trials already like 40k participants 

But didn’t trials frail elderly people, representative royals. 300k one day? STOP POSTING ""NEW"" VARIATIONS. LITERALLY THOUSANDS MUTATIONS ALREADY. 

WE DOCUMENTED MUTATIONS SINCE MARCH 2020.

FFS  Yeah media reporting pretty unclear, trial test transmission would much longer complicated, compared fairly straightforward science checking people get infected. We'll get confirmation due time, best assume transmission low non-existent. That's true yeah come on, Catholic church would never its' high. Jesus think this? They’re downvoted spreading FUD vaccine gone rigorous safety testing every vaccine there. Even though aren’t directly saying vaccine dangerous, they’re implying saying “hey, scientifically illiterate people concerned vaccine!” people refuse take vaccine, people die. supplements useless unless head outside? better outcomes south? done vaccinations whole EU.

Not absolute numbers, EU number 2.4 millions. per capita UK far ahead. ""Liberal"" means something different outside American English thus right wing many countries e.g. Denmark. 80 per cent people Japan say year's Tokyo Olympics cancelled delayed worries mount record surge coronavirus cases across country, Kyodo News poll showed Sunday. world's biggest multi-sports event, postponed last year due pandemic, scheduled held 23 July – 8 August Japanese capital. Yoshihide Suga , Japanese prime minister, declared state emergency greater Tokyo region Thursday. Family sorta really (understandably) wanna hesd hospital case end catching corona well  probably stop working. flu vaccine gets updated every year too.

Luckily say RNA vaccines much easier modify that's good thing. never seen that. percentage would say that? think opinion attacked vaccines researched tested vaccines history. 

The concerns based reason, fear unknown. hundreds thousands people injected, thing people fear disease destroyed much. 

But instead, people talk reasonable concerns, act way keep disease around forever.

I wish anti-vax fear could stretch people unafraid disease entirely they'd least wear masks. Actually vaccine wonders people one common allergy - eggs. traditional vaccine used eggs, doesn't.

""clean"" *deeply* relative term back then. I’m surprised. government left hospitals determine qualified, course going sort out. 

My hospitals same. I’ve complaining weeks included students don’t see patients first priority group, well back office staff. 

This government’s fault. chose devolve responsibility hospitals pharmacies, little oversight. can’t act surprised places pushed limit prioritisation ensure people taken care of.

Ny/FL everywhere between. come FL big deal giving NY'ers vacation vaccine giving teachers, forced back person Gov. Three? It’s virus. There’s thousands.

I’m glad people learning flus various viruses, it’s getting ridiculous. completely edited post wrote new one, got criticized. fuck doing?

Maybe go therapy something. Like countries, keep testing low, they’ll lower case numbers. We’re spoiled much testing happening US. last pope (Benedict XVI) still alive. mean John Paul II, pretty evident final days going die soon.  Still absurd. one fuckin person died vax many died Covid? care takers/health providers won’t take it? take shot heartbeat don’t work healthcare won’t access 6 mos minimum. Fuck anyone access refuses. It’s ignorance. told 3 million death fact diabetic co-worker easily latches excuse downplay virus, he’s actually little open listen reasoning look facts see there’s anything severity virus.

His response 3 million dead 2020 “Well we’re tail end generation anyways, expecting lot older people die time.” They’re pretty stuck mortality “mostly” affected people 65, also makes suspicious death count, since lot old. Wonder would’ve better “since 1918” point it. refuted someone saying know science works linking 3 articles American polls. proven point. It’s what? Cheese? misleading, usual test positivity rate closer 5-10%. according [this highest since may 11.5% Reminiscent Sartre say anti-Semites. 

""Never believe anti-Semites completely unaware absurdity replies...But amusing themselves, adversary obliged use words responsibly, since believes words...They delight acting bad faith, since seek persuade sound argument intimidate disconcert...."" Pope Alive sounds protestant !remindme 1 month fear easy way control people. Religions used fear control populations enrich top percentile centuries. much different. would consult medical provider explain this.

They have. supposed stay away epi said chalk exactly said. something preservatives used epinephrine. Another redditor pointed get ingredients list think solid info. 
Thanks Finally target something agree waste time effort. said “I guess” could that. Personally stopped trying discussions people. need people life. Nothing say convince wrong. remember June people saying ""its flu bro, aint even bad"" hope that's true. I'm going catch studies hopefully. studying depth immunology school. time studying viruses. hope gets better unlikely unfortunately. 14 days mechanical ventilator chances survival less 10% afaik. need consider alternatives... would begrudge himself. understand downvotes either. like said vaccine rubbish trusted. terrible depressing realisation mortality would drive firstly *buy car?* Oh nevermind. think understood wrong also.

So actually case believe vaccine stop transmission evidence yet? sounds preety relieving.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* lot people don’t read article. take 3 million number believe that’s many people died. No, shouldn’t do. title clear inflammatory opinion. I’m arguing numbers. opinion. too. hear people work Monday saying “ three million people died “ wording title. People understand that. doesn’t make newsworthy, particularly context ease transmission vaccine efficacy. Totally, didn’t Trump say February virus would go away last spring. pretty terrifying amount honest That’d likely require National guard used delivery service and/or grocery shoppers.

It also isn’t completely necessary. We’re almost year pandemic now, enough data see measures “are good enough”

And fact is, everyone wore mask times home, enter home wasn’t own, pandemic would near non-existent point. 

All fines, closing public spaces businesses etc, required eliminate places people don’t seem willing wear mask. 

Another alternative would place house arrest anyone caught outside home without mask, anyone caught another persons home isn’t performing care repair service. would allow responsible people continue live life responsibly, removing irresponsible people public contact. 

But you’d still figure monitoring delivery logistics. priced 20 lb bag rice? sound like it. running mouth shit feels good. fucking pandemic. life death survival fittest. game's going millions years, play die. shots arms? Cool! Significant Protein Spike mutations already occured, chance mutations still effected vaccine. 

With protein spike mutated strains spreading aggressively anything we've seen past year, could easily see variant appear recognized vaccine induced immunity.

Viruses mutate quickly bacteria, vaccinated people careless could easily exposed variant protein spike mutation ignore immunity. vaccinated community careless whole, could quickly spread curious. exactly feel benefit this? Go life. IMHO, amount time spent indexing debating screenshots quotes people disagree would far better spent learning marketable skills, building business, working out, etc. 

I’ll admit lost several friends 2020, I’ve also made several higher quality friends, learned valuable skills, got healthier, etc...

At point, gotta stop looking scoreboard, start playing game. also documented reported. latest science-based update.  Crafts. I've taken sewing (actually months COVID arrived). walk, greenery helps mental health. Podcasts help well. long hug, know day road, right now. :( God mustve vacation Touching door handles easily fixed washing hands.

Staying much larger group would require lot home deliveries Tesco etc. might noticed staff/vehicles that. deliveries carry virus. ""We asked people stay inside watch movies. fucking it."" Exactly.

# data shows vaccinations slow significantly Fridays virtually nonexistent weekends.

I care say. care feel. **have data.**  Yeah, small enough get meltblown masks. flu, there's shorter incubation time, likely noticeable symptoms, avoid going spreading it.

Changde different. People isolated homes/neighborhoods.

Their sense patriotism Country first + individual wants last. apply population sampling size people met pretty small, outlook different I've seen USA whole. Seems little early worrying donating doses doses exist fraction administered.

And proven studies, want public health policy conducted based assumption water wet? Honestly, I'm pissed states distributed 20-30% doses received far. closer 60% now. need greatly expand size 15 minute monitoring areas. experience, they’re quite small, can’t vaccinate many people. 

It takes 3 minutes record patient information, document shot, give it. 15 minutes monitoring, that’s 18 minutes per patient, need area hold 6 people per vaccinator. wondering rather wait get vaccine actually approved. least cook food himself?

However, didn’t skip line. waited turn. imagine outlived queen england daft enough buy Venezuela's official Covid numbers praise medical system that's shambles. think room talk. Ive never wanted poked needle bad tbh refused skip line, waited turn... Maybe even redditors think blaming *everything* bogeyman bit much. understand correctly, first dose 70% effective -- reduces infection probability 70%.  second dose gives another 20%.  Two people 70% effective protection, yields fewer cases one 90% one 0%. 

If supply chain ramp get second dose within reasonable time, total risk reduced dramatically winter. rebuttal dumb mean. places world exactly described currently implemented. America-the-formerly-great. Discord way better IMO people giving random, unfounded timelines since vaccine got approved lmao essential worker id love display catch succumb virus. want go camping bad? Heres dead worker place eager visit. Heres gofundme children. Enjoy visit! Masks? Idk man. Zoom? Never downloaded lol Indeed, paying them?

Why paid? Every hospital gets reimbursed put shots arms. think like $28 per shot. average nurse inject shot every 5-10 minutes. enough revenue.

That said, especially shitty position nurses enjoy getting first dibs life-saving vaccines turn around take plenty time thousands others die vaccines pile shelves. Tons people asked make serious sacrifices due Covid. expect medical community join making sacrifices, think that's pay them? 

Their... people walk. 

Anyone healthcare professional enjoys priority vaccination due profession ""walks"" pandemic rages face *serious* consequences. problem figure out.

Nobody's asking figure anything thinking whatsoever. We're asking join society making sacrifices fight pandemic putting effort vaccinate people they've turn get jab. Asking job (putting needle someone's arm) unreasonable. Stop obtuse. main source seem unmasked indoor private gatherings. suspect it’s “main” 40% ~90%.

I would still rather go near empty grocery store 3:30am vs busy store 3:30pm. Right, that's saying. controlled even stopped transmitted time, get it, know early on, take meds get it. crazy amounts less deadly 1990's, possibly even less deadly covid well controlled. 24, started true “adult life” (out school) January 2020.

Then COVID hit… I’m sorry He's smart use platform anything would make happen Seems Reddit okay use total number cases deaths disregard population making US look incompetent, limits comparing states. 1.292 millions left. coworker mine got reinfected also. March again. words, MUCH worse time around. young healthy woman. I'm sorta scared regards vit d. I'm young sure, gone outside months, diet include anything much vit d, allowed buy supplements


I writing examinations person soon. I'm scared might contract get hard af shake head you. I’ve chronic fatigue syndrome 20 years now. symptoms almost identical long COVID minus lack smell actual lung damage (I shortness breath like many CFS sufferers, lung function looks normal tested). lost career medicine fatigue, headaches, brain fog insomnia. It’s painful watch people roll dice health. They’re completely ignorant sick get long COVID 

I’m California neighbors New Years Eve party young (20 year old) kids running house. I’m wondering going permanently disabled long COVID. 

The number people going left disabled, unable hold job, drain already costly health care system staggering. country going changed forever, even long pandemic over. Many months ago read interview doctor Israel, said (IIRC) even accepting patients age 60. example brutal triage system... fucking taxed paper tea #neverforget


Don’t wish guys living dream USA /s confident, though - move there. probably better America, right?

I mean, I'm daft enough live America first place... unblinded yet, correct? number come from? queen arguably powerful person world. Parasites Pretty hard separate based design studies assume. test positive report symptoms, follow-up later, they'll never know whether asymptomatic vs presymptomatic.  J&amp;J one ~~bush~~ arm. article California, opened ""no one regulating anything here"". Anyone familiar California know OC little bubble. 22.

I’m kinda scared taking stand following lead 10 months though. 

I guess could stop nonessential spending, get job ASAP, save 4-8 months, get out. know it’s needs happen it’s huge risk guess I’m scared consequences would lie ahead went path, family’s reaction would making changes.  I’ve met someone HIV positive decades never developed AIDs. person doctors care. hope so. I'm really discouraged sad state things right 😔 Yay! Finally US handling right. Venezuela's officials known official Covid-19 death toll currently stands 329, one South America’s lowest. contrast 110,000 people died neighbouring Brazil 26,000 Peru, similar-sized population Venezuela.  scenes playing inside University hospital – two nine floors host coronavirus patients – suggest true situation may far worse.  government says everything control that’s true,” one employee told Guardian, speaking condition anonymity fear persecuted Venezuela’s authoritarian regime. “We six eight deaths day.”  one recent three-day period July, 26 patients reportedly died Covid-19 none included official count.  investigative website Armando.info claimed hospital’s doctors counted 216 patients died Covid-19 symptoms – even though official death toll Zulia state point 63.  know happening University hospital,” one worker said. “But speak they’ll lock us choice capital, affected region Zulia state, Maracaibo capital, Chavista governor, Omar Prieto, also among infected.

Film TV production deemed essential given pass everyone daily tests. *healthy* responsible (biologically humanly) half infections Oh cool, yet another genius misappropriating Orwell. Ah yes, single anonymous, unverified source, written almost unknown freelancer based different country, ever writes hear-say stories Venezuela, written nothing Venezuela prior 2 years ago, published medical journal history investigative journalism.

Yet accusing believing anything... like shopping cart method. Whoever thought elegantly solved important problem. Limit people one per cart problem solved. Australia China right idea. Keep mind 1 million cases day would take year Yeah, pretty much bible belt. expected coincidence! say 180,000,000 pull number ass. 360,000,000 doses, maybe 2 million day. According bad math gonna long year. dumb suggestion. dumb. Also American thanks :) She’s arguably powerful person world. Sure, may take longer get man moon. can't one lab. resources entirely different. Sending man moon also major feat sure! 

That take away impressed mean ""a piece cake"". 

The article linked expert field comparing moon landing. totally different things. Requiring different resources amounts effort yes. amazing probably neither viewed piece cake experts saying otherwise. 

But again, expert simply grateful are, tend listen saying. 😃 know it’s disrespectful, get clear truckbeds line caskets/body bags busy streets people about. Shopping, non essential activities, defying quarantine general assholes. Literally nothing teach selfish motherfuckers. mean fact treatments therapeutics helped lot. pretty newsworthy Charlie Sheen came diagnosis. like first dose. gonna like 2nd I'm gonna take it. I'm big boi little sissy That's fair bit different curfew stop indoor gatherings, police probably use thermal scanning helicopters every night check

It's thing. can't tell many people house warm roof is. winter, everyone heater on. would see mass warm roofs slight differences due well insulated one is. 

They spot outdoor gatherings per example linked. spot people parks ect. offer commission ordering them.  tired shit may wait bigger answer biggest reason general vaccines severely reduce transmission. also moderna limited data hinting vaccine reduced spread well expect Israel's cases go down, given they've vaccinated many people? trying sound like asshole anything haven’t whole time? may good overbuy let poorer countries take early supplies. $ people come person probably think less likely continue come zoom church leads lower congregation level things reopen. 


I told church February take seriously. bit slow moving liking, stopped going. I'm curious seem think expressing spike protein would cause recognition RBC's immune system foreign.

I'm seeing potential mechanistic link here, proposing? now? Parts state ICUs full capacity seems like weeks. suppose shall would expected sort immune response.

Oh see, yeah take also consideration 3/4 volunteers Pfizer feel symptoms afterwards, that's...not strange. Immune system troubling means job. I'd rather effects feel shitty 24 hours Who's Queen Philip? possibility, I'm sure close things again. Testing asymptomatic? testing shit healthy. Waste fucking money. Thank you, decent fever it, suspect covid earlier year. think unreasonable ask people work extra hours, especially task routine non-demanding sticking needle arm.

Indeed, paying them? cruel person like work people death, desperate times call desperate measures think need accept new normal may call healthcare professionals work 40 hours per week help put end pandemic.

Great, pay them? Remember, people walk. walked large numbers assholes like dumped problem figure out. Yeah know, warrantless invasion privacy too. least US determined case. speak laws Canada Australia Uh, it’s turn. He’s 84. work NHS, they're cancelled. patients showing all. However none vaccines going waste, soon expired vaccine gets dolled first come basis anyone trust. AFAIK shelter place order though. bad class design use booleans

!remindme (if !pope.isAlive) Well complain Trudeau then. curious. exactly feel benefit this?

Deflecting Responsibility actions. Like court , guilty criminal 99% pleads guilty.  unique, guess, different country. Hospitals country reporting 90% vaccination rates offered vaccine, hospital group think reporting 95%. hospitals reporting 90 97% vacination rates.

There always people vaccinated , got real medical condition disadvising vaccination, cancel day, feeling ill might battling another infection Pretty much, yes. No, I’m doctor test everyone take hospital rvp panel includes flu don’t already known COVID. There’s flu cases flu doesn’t spread easily social distancing masks basically prevented flu outbreak entirely. Science, extension, medicine, infallible. Mistakes, even tiny ones, lead huge problems line. Think thalidomide pandemrix. Think happened there. ""AnTi-sCiEnCe"" makes sound like science sort cult permitted question anything.  Relax man. people United States preach Heroes medical field, nurses, doctors, etc. idiots fools concerns? people fighting pandemic concerns? outlandish worry community county concerns raised issue underlying issues some.

The COVID-19 (SARS-COV-2) novel virus meaning virus never previously recorded. since March everyone fighting gathering much data possible giving insight prevention trying reduce spread. 

Perhaps medical field see us seen, trauma, stress fighting hope throughout. easy take toll physical mental health. stated again, yes safe negate concerns people least hear instead casting aside. everyone else want get pandemic, want hope. even gathering data rely others help fight virus.

On side spectrum people adhere wearing masks social distancing agree testing anti vaxxers responsible fear mongering. want direct remarks torwards them.

That said unwise deem Medical Heroes everyone preach idiots. ones fighting are. least give respect. uncivil torwards ignore them.  So... trap debt situation? Different season combination half year vaccinating makes quite difference Lord, thank saying it. guy getting credit essentially getting way (at best) , book handled covid crisis NY Times bestseller! guy going let vaccines go bad shelf! billions dollars already spent. Marketing, infrastructure, transportation, etc. Maybe wanted get rid old people ? Let us make distinction “health care workers” “medical professionals”, because, I’m grateful cleaning lady good job keeping ward clean ask advice treatment.

Didn’t church receive billion dollars US government despite paying penny taxes? TL;DR: Pfizer/BioNTech jab given 14th 33rd weeks delayed delivery. wasting billions failure dead Olympics event, instead investing health emergency state Tokyo moment? 

There's logic it, he's criticizing NHS motivated enough administer 50 million vaccines five days, barrier red tape number vaccines available.

Sure, maybe 50 million vaccines hand could administered five days. could also achieved Jimmy vaccine-giving leprechaun dances across UK rainbow hands vaccines chuckle piece leprechaun gold. since either things, kind moot point. Honestly people still going give hard time ""cutting line."" People *any* public figure. really make much sense since developed world kind dosage shortage. people get it, better, really issue one two doses going someone who's promoting vaccine changes anything. isn’t true blame people contract virus fault wrong. wife avoid gatherings, wear mask anytime leave house, leave essentials like grocery shopping. tested positive covid despite following rules doesn’t make either us selfish hateful person also needs 2  Lol. I'm living UK American friends get tested. Based experiences compared say Americans ""spoiled"" testing systems. Lol holy shit, realized word curfew comes reading that. Couvre-feu (cover fire). Let’s say Pope die like dream...what feel like winning lottery numbers would week. thought oxford vaccine 100m doses requires 1?

Hebei finished testing 13 million people major cities Shijiazhuang Xingtai, Logistical issues. would assume he’s already vaccinated.  don’t know LA much, SD opened Petco Park site week push rest Phase 1a. Along way people actual hospital workers signup.

My assumption system used goes Phase 1b. semantics. delay outright cancellation two completely different things. Actually article says 2020 deadliest ever, since 1918. point 1918 2020 highest percentage increase year year since 1918. Florida, know lot counties switching Eventbrite schedule appointments. course, causes issue large percentage 65 older know use it. forced ration care, choose treat Covid-19 cancer, years life saved treating Covid-19 patients lost delaying treatment cancer patients. parties: effectively two, others coalitions them.

- LDP: Liberal Democratic Party (right wing)

- CDP: Constitutional Democratic Party (I know put them, maybe center)

Since US gave Japan sovereignty back, around 1955, one party lead country, LDP. think, really short time, 4 years maybe, 1955 - now, CDP able get majority.

So country lead right-wing nationalist party half century. ultra conservative catholic coworker always hated pope. Again: UK left EU 31 January 2020. still part EU would pressure EU members use start vaccination campaign demonstration EU unity. Brazil variants, far none mutated level UK SA variant. Semantics Scremantics MD friend limited spare time shames people Facebook appearing photos people households, followed defriending them. claims reduces backlog work. Oh wow fucking pedophile cult leader! would happen Died!?? Excellent!!! pissed get Dunkin' Donuts Burger King 24/7 life saving vaccine. I'm happy see 24/7 schedule now. ""The aim"" - promising it, means likely happen.

But again, offer it, mean get lol.

_""Oi, Dave, want vaccine?!""_

_""Yes mate""_

_""Cool, aint got right least offered ya, tick list""_

It's optics likely gives small bump polls. Correct, however huge amount political pressure EU members jointly procure distribute vaccines theoretically possible EU member go alone, practically wasn’t option. much different situation would parts world. Food industry lot workers working meager incomes wouldnt able save preparation this. faced mountain debt. said would see families Easter 2020 remember?! Anyone personally know anyone admitted ICU survived? Father Law hospital since 12/28 ICU since 12/31.... Seems like longer he's there, less likely he'll recover.... That's weird. dream grateful dead next day Jerry Garcia died. going say thing. beginning pandemic keep hearing virus mutating slowly, seems like it’s sped moment. vaccinate athletes key people involved possibility run Olympics. Japan compared neighboring countries, US UK. way worse east Asian country. 2008 financial meltdown linked climate change /S 

What's old saw??? Correlation causation  reason would guess insanely progressive Pope recent history outspoken it. oddities Pope, especially juxtaposed current orange dude America. Pope one influential people world including US. two catholic presidents Democrats majority Catholics Republican. raised catholic even “liberal” sect Catholics. man, never thought would progressive Pope, desire practicing catholic don’t underplay importance one influential leaders world(a lot large portion right country) speaking belief lot followers believe. Where's God I'm long hauler denier. Good luck future medical problems. Deaths still breached 100. death rate expected get much worse soon? know ton people declined said decline turn up. want make sure don’t see bad side effects. thoughts are, well either, want get back normal ASAP getting vaccinated IMO one important step. Agreed. Whenever actually remember dream, usually pin-point recent facts heard, conversations things experienced added melting pot inside brain create weird narrative dream.  Thanks! Definitely fortunate. written C pope pope?  Isn’t someone gonna Profit big big time ? point is? group 1B also allowed vaccinated starting on Monday. includes teachers, first responders, public safety workers, transit workers people 75 older, able make appointment get vaccinated coronavirus.  must make appointment either online phone. fill New York state COVID-19 vaccine form bring proof employment prove fall category.

From Monday vaccination centers open 24/7. clarify, saw 99% trial participants measurable antibodies SA cohort, took mean candidate 99% effective? so, unfortunately case. Efficacy measured candidate's ability prevent symptomatic COVID-19 lab confirmed infection.  think prof saying vaccines could administered rate 50M per day, much available. countries administering even limited supplies haste. I'd honestly rather 2022 full event everything back normal amazing event celebrate humanity world rather half assed one empty stadiums. 

It befitting since Olympics celebration human strength endurance also bringing together countries world together one event root cause forcing people work put everyone risk. commute public transit everyday, option. 
And fact bunch assholes run government would rather fight one another much hand corporations everyone loses roof head. 
GET BROKE DIE TRYING schools open 2020 Games delayed, cancelled. Volunteer Pfizer Phase 3. Hear hear everything said. *so* needs subreddit. always tended side view, certainly ridiculous close stores restaurants pubs yet keep schoolkids together school school buses etc. would interesting see figures transmission pupils teachers. 100k doses, give 50k doses. Oh still 50k doses well need ship anymore yet. Waiting waiting waiting waiting.

This. hold back half second dose kept shipping basically two weeks would wash. doses held back would always used within two three week second dose follow up. waste. need keep getting supply. Mmm, yes. Nothing better multiple sick kids symptoms last months! Maybe even permanent damage cardiovascular system major organs.  Thanks (most likely deliberate, let's realists here) slow roll vaccine, best hope Biden pulling stops executive power speed vaccination process. work social care. know I’m still careful wear mask I’m interesting. Many thanks taking time dig up.

I wonder Twitter ever deigned justify apparent inconsistency?

I consider Trump Khamenei loathsome turds world would well rid of. definitely afforded treatment Twitter. don’t expect people non commonwealth countries understand, even 94 would massive blow morale died natural causes, let alone avoidable virus. Queen nothing daily lives countries run, she’s still damn Queen one wants dead. don’t want look new guys face money one. Even commonwealth people don’t like royal family live totally independent countries still talk like she’s Queen, foreign queen. give credit funding vaccine development, president wouldn’t pandemic? else done well? roll little planning care. I'm certainly crowds think spreading basic level vaccination take good thing.

I think yearly or, bi-yearly booster shots become thing anyway, lets get base vaccinated can. Pretty much Texass. governor sure hell got though.

Oh well, willful negligence soon. 11 days til someone driving car again. Considering already ahead expected, think likely we'll get sooner. bet late May we're lucky.  wonder they're passing emergency legislation allow institute additional (new) lockdown measures?  Maybe tell ""pretty good"" they're doing, since seem aware. remember elementary school would read school library parents picked up, sometimes hours school ended. Didn’t realize couple years later librarian never kicked would stay extra long read help recommend books. would sometimes even trust lock afterwards. sincere appreciation librarians there, true heroes Sure... figure 1 death ¹10,000 bad. Better 1 death many bc one take vaccine hearing that.  Thus makes sense look Germany, fewer pandemic deniers USA. Here, people late 30s 40s age groups highest prevalence, partying college age crowd seniors nursing home age. 40s age Germans young kids. could another reason, wonder kids school bring home. It’s subversion, actually stopping virus. Similar swine flu. 60m cases utter failure federal government Chris Christie somehow ended person people blamed. single state US well. Gyms restaurants open right now. Let's call - white aggression outright racism.

Let's call xenophobia asian americans. Let's call white racism. muslim, terrorist. asian china flu, black n word. mexican illegal immigrant etc.

Ask american indians. saying stands white man always forked tongue, always always will.

Until address problem white privilege exceptionalism, problem always persist. happening time columbus, jim crow MLK, BLM today, Trump nuts storming US Capitol, keep happening, media keep spinning white culture behaviour universal, truth .

Its socialized negatives, privatized positives WASPs. . made mistake.  trusted states get job done, like West Virgina Dakotas did.  like California New York. Whats point? We've distributed 22 million doses given like 6 million people San Francisco overdosed year died covid. I'm sure many areas similar stats. right, quality life, importantly, civil liberties completely destroyed name 'safety.' unfortunately lockdowns normalized now, likely ever fully get back lifetimes. Freedom civil liberties people forget incredibly rare human history watching destruction cheered subs like one depressing part me. used covid calculator last year came reassuringly low percentage. friend similar age, unlike me, non-smoking, non-drinker, ran long distance races fun, died covid week Christmas. number look remote anymore. UK playing slightly risky strategy, fair - first release several vaccines, importantly messing around ""second dose 10 weeks"" idea manufacturers recommend 3 weeks... could backfire government misjudged definitely notice behavior like late night. people literally savor kinds discussions, matter illogical. Thank fuck comment realize till now.

Edit: looks like others share sentiment. Maybe feds trusted states.  Newsome busy something besides arranging vaccinations residents California. restricted capacity one enforces cares. pulled ass. Go check statistics. Ngl, would loved see it. It’s still piece history, even shit one. obvious, locked pubs restaurants got cases really low figures , reopen schools then, 2nd wave comes new dynamic seems infections developing fast private homes (so therefore families) even following lockdown guidelines. kids spreading would guess least large amount cases children parents. could still catch give others. fully proven spread vaccination. looking past behaviour seems pretty typical Queen insist treated everyone else much possible.

Until comes legal issues like sheltering pedo prince Neither.  states trying blame feds fuckup.  Many states administered third doses sent them.  world

Just say US Europe, please, know mean. didn’t come across rude me, desire see vaccines go they’ll greatest good positive stance. I’m fed British government’s overall response Covid bad, worse US look numbers dead, I’d first line criticise politicians/elites jumped queue fair turn. Jumping queues British! I’m hopeful/surprised vaccine rollout going fairly well here. advantage see queen vaccine compared granny personal doctor come palace give jab, rather visit hospital/vaccination centre. given security/PR circus would follow her, imagine would last thing medical staff would want stressful time them. Cheers. Here’s next 100 years. :) desperate getting last word hahahhaa state charge.  Tell them. 2 things come mind reading article.


1. point stay home order one following it?



2. Federal, State local governments done better job compensating businesses forced close maybe happening California reported almost 150k vaccinations update today. state set rules.  Health care workers first.  Take governor. Think little longer that. thing wife qualifies . son way lower priority. health issues could still catch kill off. Easier divorce. /s hopefully sarcasm great hear. glad places. bring hope. Honestly, much I'm cynical UK really well vaccines compared elsewhere. Masks great all, South Korea relying much mask-wearing. People West treat masks like they're sort silver bullet that's never case East Asian countries. Arizona closed now. “One-third lived family members tested positive virus traces SARS-CoV-2 antibodies blood.” Someone needs spend time kiddos...... tested positive COVID 12/22, isolated quarantined 10 days required per CDC state's health department. returning work week, wife required get tested COVID. tested positive. local health department employee said isolate, since recently virus able transmit contract little while. sound correct? ""Israel vaccinated total people European country"" 

If I'm mistaken Israel vaccinated pretty much amount entire European Union COMBINED (Of course true long...) Depends doomsday. virus survived long lasting effects least immediate family survived life goes on. say prepped. hand could adapt needed. Gyms open lots places. “Sounds awful”? It’s wonderful, you’re forced go know. state well. Eh, Im worried us. It’s everyone else I’m worried Probably done weeks ago, especially reports healthcare workers forgoing vaccinations. English really love queue, don’t they? always Ok. Thanks looking it. means taking gamble availability right vaccine right time get second dose.   got second time. healthcare worker? far. fbi probably going checking long now. proof 100x? evaluating quality country’s response, interested excess deaths causes covid-19 deaths. health Covid-19.

By measure, Sweden pretty good. far fewer excess deaths causes people dying Covid-19. countries opposite situation, travelled places like Hawaii, absolutely terrible idea, deserve criticism get. guy Canadian politician I’ve heard seems broken rules travelling. don’t find report academic article worth posting? Police-enforced contact tracing. would never fly US police maskless covid deniers. Tbh I’m also skeptical Covid19 sub huge rise anti vax people. feel it’s best read stories check wrote see bias information. less time comment sections lol Dire situation indeed. explosion cases deaths, hospital beds, rationing oxygen, doctors exhausted, room hospital morgues either. Sad sad state affairs. Texas 102 deaths per million. Lithuania performing worse.

I hope family stay safe! Mfg FDA say time.  data happens isn't. know could vaccinate dead man *would* like go shopping toilet paper Wal-Mart fear life. Death chances close none age it’s early know 100% long term effects  I'm getting sense they've switched mantra ""vaccinate everyone, now, whoever are, use every existing dose"" (walk-ins?). 100% sure they're people ""open schools"" ""it's like flu"" ""no lockdowns"" ""bUt MuH T_cELLs iMmuNIty"" ""just isolate old let everyone work"" ""kids spread it"" ""young people spread it"" ""you either die back normal health after""; feel like they're people. covid. Hmm, we’re probably looking 1.00-.98^5 = 9.6% chance. high, things considered. expecting closer 15% chance transmission per incident. block travel internet Florida 20th. would solve lot problems. got Pfizer first dose piece cake. get second dose Tuesday. I’m hearing existing antibodies infection you’ll bigger immune response vaccine military little vaccination campaign point. Check.

It's nice seeing come around position. would like public health policy based science, ""gut feels.""

Unfortunately, means, yes, need prove water wet, takes time.

One needs look masks ""gut feels"" politicians mess created there.  irony people live countries maximum protective measures turning massive failures people would rather double ineffective methods trying something else could actually work virus. made rule nobody gets health care people get it.  happens vaccine sits freezer try get whatever standard ""vaccinated health care workers"" is. gonna say know gotten 0 symptoms US bottom out. one Super-spreader Event - Super Bowl Sunday. Cases start drop early March 30-40 natural immunity.

Then get competent adults running federal government. It’s going take 6 weeks turn around incompetent supertanker - tailwinds coming early March

Hopefully get third vaccine approved February either Oxford JandJ. March April vaccinations probably hit 2 million day. Distribution issues get worked federal government helps states private sector.

I hope super surprised quickly things turn around Easter Memorial Day California run democrats.. What's excuse? seem plan. arnt people getting mass vaccinations? Wtf want teachers risk lives minority portion survey? I'm hesitant concerns eventually get it.

And anyone jumps ""slowing things down""or whatever sure it....the vaccine offered yet, turned down. idea option get come. non zero amount still larger deaths. 

Also, non hospitalized could also still issue many bad. also relatively protected given need exposed many outsiders. think many staff members even live them. 

Also looking past behaviour seems pretty typical Queen insist treated everyone else much possible. know talking about.. HMO's vaccination campaign built previous work system involved logistical information prevent overwhelmed, like said lot work put get today..

carry pointless peeks, moving goalpost lack sense humor.. Everyone going forward fair chance coming contact Sars2. Unlike Sars example stay foreseeable .

The point risk needs looked individual basis. still favour social distancing etc present medical issues higher age still normal things like shopping etc. website states developed Oxford University. used potentially help people understand shared risk Covid 19.

We chances dying many things every day. choice mitigate risks. agree there’s balance I’ll issue see numbers going restrictions still place. One biggest mistakes think US made positioning war. look wars operate, typically relinquish rights individual greater good war ends. feels prolonged easily forget long grandparents great grandparents relinquished rights WWI especially WWII. war invisible enemy. Instead bomb raids sending young men foxholes, we’re fighting enemy soil restrictions gunfire have. sure believe corruptibility power time being, personally don’t feel experts asking us egregious threatening democracy long term. acknowledge could change, sure, now, I’d much rather people stay home they’re vaccinated save lives. Came back fully issues? vulnerable (health care workers, nursing home residents, 65 up) vaccinated see drastic reduction key factors hospitalizations deaths. would assume full results groups vaccinated clear Memorial Day. Every person vaccinated point cherry top. may places like California NYC keep strict restrictions place get close zero cases per day, country fairly open early summer. Since total numbers typically useless without context, world stage UK twenty-sixth cases ninth deaths per million. 

About 0.11% UK's citizens died. took ten days regain taste. Smell eighteen.
Both came back fully 23 days. Easy them, younger generation locked safety oldsters need sacrifices them. hcw, never fails amaze many outright anti-vaxxers encounter. Entirely many people I've talked getting vaccine categorize ""anti-vaxxers"" people afraid putting something new and, eyes, untested time bodies. agree understand someone afraid. also believe people get vaccinated see rest us guinea pigs died vaccine. almost go discussion thread. There's probably others like me. checked last time happened 1992, events much smaller today. Fair enough. remember time Ripley wanted quarantine Ash, well, know worked out. Yep knew nurse hardcore conspiracy nut anti vaxxer. hospital 500 doses,and 400 nurses took it,NO reason 100 sitting unused,start staff,this makes sence,and quite alarming know happening. 2020 Olympics going go way 1916, 1940, 1944 Olympics it.

I worked multiple medical studies leading hospital - people dress sorts *bullshit* word “could”. 

The linked comment got 1.2K upvotes asserts 50% cruise ship asymptomatics long term effects. false claim. detected certain visual remnants lungs, requires context read. occurs almost every respiratory disease *not* cause worry necessarily (though obviously some)

It’s kind inability reason uncertainty kills credibility. it’s true 100% people scary long term outcomes, *far norm* cases spread asymptomatic you’re talking kind variant!  Athletes participate, throw away chances Olympics.

And think people idea many people vaccinated July. Vaccination scale massively next months. also enough crowdless, sterile football matches pretty much watching. Would rather Olympics this. agree yet proven schools primary spreading venue. proven primary spreading venue. saying *I believe schools primary spreading venue* based evidence available me. [Harvard Medical ""Early studies suggested children contribute much spread coronavirus. recent studies raise concerns children could capable spreading infection."" ""infected children much, more, coronavirus upper respiratory tracts infected adults.""

Given severity situation think ought less cavalier dismissal. startling high correlation school attendance covid cases see. perceive sad repeat widespread misinformation beginning pandemic, things ""not transmitted humans"" ""not spread air"". we've got ""not transmitted children"" ""schools safe"" coming supposedly intelligent civic minded people. tragic.  Nah. You’re literally arguing epidemiologists linked said.

Enjoy ego Mongolia low population density. That's extreme form social distancing. whilst someone could walk across mongolian steppe. would take months, almost isolated NZ, isolated UK. work school remote till march,my dr said hold data available get it. rush. 1-A,teachers 1-B. AZ/Oxford multiple trials going planning to, single dose mix-and-match vaccines. easily flexible vaccine since perfect heterologus regimens.

It probably good enough approval basic prime-boost regimen 3 weeks doses. getting overly complex good. Half work vaccine approval simplifying everything regulators consumers. variants gonna get everywhere...it's way viruses. Friendly reminder unhealthy economy equals deaths too. Excellent response. 

I think probably agree lot disagree. nice find someone well thought opinions. I’m going get super verbose here, I’d say thrilled debate someone actually without turning argument ... see futility wasting time someone set viewpoint, challenge views force dig feet deeper ground position. someone like you, I’d absolutely love found something disagreed on, debate resulted one us changing opinions (or least expanding opinions).

As far regular stream black guys approaching sorts conversations — actually enjoy conversations, don’t mind idea describe “Since figure within sentences person capable real discussion, shouldn’t people” ... concerns get cold approach, opener. I’m wondering sending signals like without even talking.

Honestly, I’d love continue conversation perhaps directly — feel free send DM. also love Germany friends planning visit soon world opens back again, perhaps meet person next time end side pond. ""Anyone thought things would back normalcy level would allow Olympics 2021 short sighted straight delusional.""

Hindsight wonderful thing it? embark time machine, go back March 2020 tell literally everyone else, scientists, politicians, experts etc morons since genius, it? lot people vaccinated July. 

They could push late August September Japan could accept tourists athletes vaccinated.

You need entire world fully immunized Olympic Games. thing that’s bothering right this. Whether vaccines took 6 months, year, however long - (it seems) one actively planning actually get done vaccine available? pocket change. one $20! one $5, that’s scale 4 times. need 350bmillionndoseses money difference massive andxouldsave government set budget collapsing line Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna vaccines RNA vaccines. RNA vaccines target proteins family virus targeted uses invade cells. virus, upon invading cell, leaks genetic code cell. cell creates copies, becomes inflated new viruses, bursts. copies continue process cells, immune system overwhelms trying prevent process, causing viral disease, case, COVID-19. vaccine morphs certain cells replicants protein body stacks them. real virus - SARS-COV-2 - enters body, body trained obviate proteins, virus can't invade cell, ergo cannot get COVID-19.

Historically, RNA vaccines developed months. introduced 1990 Hungarian immunologists, literally months later, several successful RNA vaccines engineered diseases found rats. take weeks months develop. fact, took longer develop vaccines usually RNA vaccines. chief medical officer speculating ahead year. That's something resent news changed. ordered pizza went pick up, customers employees (guy making pie cashier) wearing mask. simply walked out. sportive perspective impossible. many concurrent events world cup, winter Olympics many others. calendar sports based four year cycle.

I’m lucky friends take virus seriously looking forward return normal.  restrictions, masks lockdowns FORCING virus adapt variants overcome restrictions need shove pictures everyones' faces show fake. Yeah, that's reason used word ""likely"". could definitely imagine scenario.

It's common. could look SARS outbreak, also Coronavirus, example.

But true, can't extrapolate much info data points. could mean anything, poor timing/coincidence pre-existing condition never knew exacerbated vaccine.

Immunity one jab (of Oxford vaccine) estimated 70ish% recently health officials UK. Sometimes athletes. We’ve seen people like Lolo Jones compete summer winter “With million well way” vaccine work new variants found UK, SA, Japan? Ehhh, let’s try little compassionate towards elderly. Speculation: think vaccinated able travel tourism? I'm sure countries really anxious get people back long relatively safe (with masks social distancing place course) aiming higher still. government's interest get done quickly possible. current number always enough. That's happens governments public stop caring let run control. Let say mistaken think ""schools primary spreading venue"" anywhere near proven

E.g. Oct 29, Nature, ""Why schools probably aren’t COVID hotspots"" (Oct 29). 

And even bring seasonality concurrent factor

And California (inc South Cal), cases started pick later October/early November. Way 1-cycle-after-partial-school-opening ""if lock there's risk dangerous mutations""

""Reeeeeee""

B-117 entered chat Californian part, yeah know many people ignoring orders including someone getting nails done covid. Im fucking done humans. What? cares motivation get vaccine is?

I'm still debating get it, save lives senior citizens get fuck about, personally die.

Nice! theory self adult disabled kid getting vaccine soon. practice various lists waiting til state gets together. point able lot less cautious. However, partner baby vaccine sight, that's got pretty discouraged. contracted symptoms 18 days first dose likely onset infection less 14 days following first shot.

Look see misleading shit reported journalists want headline posted particular agenda.  Well China makes people disappear, plus didn’t hear people died causes virus. Thats truth west would like believe - China ain't shit India better - democracy.

Meanwhile China produces 2.5million stem graduates year , US produces 500k (alot international students east asians well) half india even clean running water, education, sanitation, food security, etc .

The west ages , demonizing east, fetishizing countries they've influenced. ""breaking news"" somehow shock people? mean 2022? don’t think 2021 normal. know multiple doctors aren’t following appropriate guidelines right now. knows they’ll get vaccinated not. degree doesn’t exempt person selfish, entitled ahole deep denial. You’ll find plenty doctors nurses fit description, fact. No. That's true. spread dangerous misinformation unless way back Imagine thinking ridiculous give patients informed consent doctor putting something body. Well yeah cough would change ability get virus? spewing viruses everyone around seems easier coughing like coal miner. That's wear masks maintain distance correct? North Carolina, baby. gym's open now. ""Queen abd Prince Phillip get Covid...""

Gasp!

""...vaccine"".

Whew...


I ready move new era like moment. Oh yeah, complaint, would rather wait like rest world! Since novel coronavirus, everyone get it, right really enough doses. users promoting run vaccines, free all, something akin TP panics. likely mean people able-bodied healthy get vaccine feel less concerned traveling waiting lines, doses run really need them. Awful lot moderation post... come terms “ new normal” tô stay long time , gotta strong see good things still life Reports coming Queen well excited purchase million Microsoft Surface tablets. According quote would finished course April 1945 surrender Germany May well surrender Japan August. war time service? immunity 🙄

Great argument go one extreme next test kind escape:

'These data reveal strong positive selection SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma therapy identify combination Spike mutations D796H ΔH69/ΔV70 broad antibody resistance mechanism commonly occurring antibody responses Three days row, now. That's narrative delude believing dominant economy.

When not, cry foul seek impose restrictions sanctions like Japan Plaza Accords. Scientists unbelievably cautious communicating public. ""under-promise over-deliver"" mode. immunity generated current vaccines generally equal better infection.

Also see discussion here: Also, immunity original SARS (2003) lasted many immunity lasting 17 years enough say life long immunity, going last long time. people dying right left center, considering bunch hawks indian media is, would news.

I think yeah deaths underreported. May 10 percent. still 165000 deaths. country size, density relatively poor living conditions compared first world country, think number far less one might anticipated start pandemic. Praise almighty, hope us yet It’s like talking brick wall lol

I’m said need get last word lol that’s know lost  problem, Google ""death America Khamenei"". Another search showed last time confronted inconsistency court regarding Khamenei's posted hate speech, defined ""commentary political issues day"". ask immediately going refute? mean shut everything give anyone money. Shut everything give businesses money give people money.

I see anyone still getting covid bay area California everyone wears masks. matters Trump would've potentially news came couple weeks early given tight election was. it? studies seem say people PRE symptomatic spread true asymptomatic don't? articles please share article read yesterday seemed say opposite.

Also main question solution?

It's easy say close down, open up. Yep, two people. actually impacts communities pretty hard lucky enough lost anyone far. Holy shit 1.4 checked days ago exciting parents adults households kids too. think residents TN smart visit theatres capacity. heard Queen Bill Gates dating careful guys  inline Newsom's 1m 10 days pledge? feel like probably Considering vaccination RNA code dissappears days, vaccine relies cells ability remember create proteins block virus, doubts ill protected virus years. sounds providing 2 doses we'll well protected near term, long term may need doses keep ""immunity"" Okay, telling people this? concerned might discourage people getting vaccine? Clinical trial data shows low rate reactions like yours. want immortal COVID long haulers. Piss agenda article paint france countries victims COVID, victims misinformation poorer developing countries instead. noted assumed statistics data exclusive old covid variant, newer variant mostly affecting younger healthy people overwhelming hospitals currently.

While vaccine available elderly, expect increase deaths, decrease. US nearing half million death. I'm surprised anyone believe science wants vaccine. Im still ugly yes. issues. First, assume getting reply chain comment replying confused chain actually replying to. No, talking California, talking national level government U.S.

Second, comes level vaccination needed span time need, really requires communication local, state, national levels government. So, state government refuses communicate/work national local level, state worse governments work together. case U.S. national government refuses best coordinate national vaccination campaign. 

Finally, regards mass vaccinations. would love see mass vaccinations long reasonable available current supply chain limitations. But, right now, following style vaccination teirs gets vaccinated.
Think like boarding plane. People need extra help board first, family board second, everybody boards later (or kind order like that). case, think front line workers get vaccinated first, elderly get vaccinated second, another group gets vaccinated, finnaly mass public access. makes sense especially people work hospitals people live community homes.

Essentially, many factors comes vaccine role out. Many personally understand.

Please informed topics, comment make edits make accurate comment.

Youre right rollout seems slow, Europe vaccination centres havent begun operating yet. France, Spain, Germany etc still mostly vaccinate via mobile vaccination teams (carehomes) hospitals. obviously logistics - likely - improve. 

Not saying youre wrong, trying optimistic :) thanks finding link earlier btw. Officials ignored them. AFAIK trials single-dosing started since op-ed written. December may already late anyway, goal study single-dose efficacy 3-4 months. point decision vulnerable populations US made data already hand.

Yes, base decision conjecture assumption. true matter way decide. support double-dosing rational, either:

(1) since safety question, implicitly conjectured single-dosing low expected average-case efficacy months. [No one seems willing argue Alternatively,

(2) values different using worst-case rather average-case thinking. worst-case thinking, high probability ending pandemic one month sooner worthless, small probability ending month later catastrophic. perspective makes sense unless public health official gets reward unusually good results might get fired unusually bad ones. There's play though. Every action consequence, another side story, repercussions. Locking everyone fucking peoples mental state. We've gottasave lives, want create self inflicted deaths broken homes.

Lucky vaccinated babies. NHS re-issuing letters advising shielding high risk groups. never stopped shielding since march.

As zx200n said maths exponential growth. 65's overload hospitals 2-weeks more. arn't vaccinated months. 80% Germans want it. yes, everything goes well, might able get year. see ramping 4% quarter 25% quarter. that, got lucky. I.e. lucky get year.  mean NSA spying right lmao

&amp;#x200B;

freedom tell laws, police, justice system, cannot enforce simple rules could prevent massive loss life?

Because part Western mindset general American one particular everything problem.

The virus evolved particularly successful West, mortality rate heavily skewed towards high end age range economic damage measures skewed towards young. half population benefits lockdown horse rat race anymore, half suffers economically much risk virus. Dealing requires solidarity West ran it. Sure, still express percentage population rather absolute number.

It's like change population small. US population 1918 103 million. That's less 1/3 current population. lockdowns social distancing measures Unconstitutional. rights. Yes. meant development another example pandemic much resources spend speed much higher usual. edit comment make clearer. People getting infected homes family friends. Ansolutely nothing list going change that. Imo ""wokeswoman"" would alot cooler honest. is. also worst country. People TX FL keep coming infecting us. Mitigating spread isn’t aim. 1 20 Londoners currently infected. plenty spread post March geriatrics vulnerable people vaccinated lockdown released. It’s stopping NHS overload. case, worst offenders getting hospitalised, terms rate, need additional controls.

The 18 demographic net takers state 65 demographic. Pensions cost 140 billion year alone employment rates retirees sub 8%. mention vast sums taken healthcare treatment expenditure 70 demographic. intense social connections

wouldn't mean much higher chance disobey lockdown restrictions? average old person lot happier stay home average young person. young people money means need go lot more. nobody age paying grocery deliveries Insanity. moved New Zealand pandemic seems States, people either make lockdown go business usual. Turns out...people don’t know what’s best them, loved ones, community. even development time.

If got Existing Facility producing Approved Vaccine A, Existing Facility B producing Approved Vaccine B, getting Existing Facility B produce Approved Vaccine still usually take couple-of-years.

Drawing plans,verifying them, making sure everything installed accordance plans, documentation asserting that, getting as-builts drafted signed changes, pressure testing, X-raying welds, checking programming, running product checking product repeatedly. 15% get hospitalised die? Hopefully meet 2 million week target needs 3 million week. really think that, there's way enforcement stop people visiting friends' house, infeasible logistically. We'd need cops basically stop anyone authorized reason out. course happen, 

I mean China got NYT thinkpieces calling fascism Nancy Pelosi took responsibility ""falling setup"" staff pressured stylist book appointment her. semi-apology, said country needs get moving again, lockdowns caused 180k deaths. new phrase be, “some men want ketchup overcooked steak.”

This removes evil dastardly action watching wanted destruction instead implies subject wants ruin shit situation way. People get groceries. Job positions eat. immaterial whether position always filled, filled *person*, individual shop times. 

For early people...grocery stores never open 5 a.m. here, thing. late people, OK, maybe, hard move click-and-collect delivery? solutions here, thing people want make hay exactly before. disagree country Europe “really well” summer,

Then complete denial. look graph either cases deaths literally European mean look countries like Indonesia, literally right equator, pretty bad shape.

And exactly said everyone doing. pick one country look one variable interpret support whatever already believe. There's hundreds different variables determine outcome Indonesia country.

Way prove point. Probably 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic. Since really haven’t another long-term MCI American soil.

We’ve single-event MCIs like mass shootings, triage often 

I can’t imagine easy calls make, they’re usually high urgency decisions acute crisis. It’s often less doesn’t get care (and don’t likely low survival chance) gets fastest care waits next ambulance take hospital another city. 

This something completely different. True usuall 1-2 %. year 15%. BTW since one main causes sudden death Corona clots, actually undercounting COVID deaths bc present heart attacks strokes PEs. patient dead arrival rarely test COVID. 3-6 Months vaccinate people high risk. covid19 mutates enough negate vaccine. start :(

UK government intend even try eliminating virus question ""if"" virus mutates ""when"" mutates. sure EU plan try eliminating covid19. I'd thought plan ongoing insanely expensive. Mitigating spread far efficient, trying efficient, we?

So locking young best method far, intense social connections. money, little impact economy.

Also, much easier, need go doctor, need care.  Whilst testing abyssal early on, already testing 1% entire population every day now. Uppsala problems early second wave first region stricter rules. seem problem Stockholm number cases plateau since middle November. deaths year World War 2 Vietnam War? still people dont believe enough wear masks... Crazy We're still talking fucking ICUs we? CONTEXT PEOPLE JESUS 1000%. soooo many bullshit restrictions, teethless. enforced, except pay rent. Yet politicians like *surprise pikachu* “why cases going up? We’re everything can?”

That's actually good question great papers submitted FDA public, look data ourselves. I'll use moderna example like table give compared Pfizer's graph. know infection counted show symptoms test positive. honestly true infection date probably 5 7 days date tested positive. look table Moderna, see 14 days first dose patient got 2nd dose, 2 infections vaccine group 28 placebo. 30 total infections actually quite bit using confidence interval vaccine efficacy 68.8% 99.1%. means 95% confident least 68.8% effective 2 weeks dose 1, best guess 92.1% effective. Since longer term studies showed 94% effective, would make sense probably level two weeks. Pfizer graph posted shows immunity kicking time too.

Since infections counted aa test positive incubation period 5-7 days, reasonable think actually get full immunity 14 days. interesting, ""drinking voice chat"" discord relatively normal /s Thanks! definition ""average"")

No, that's definition median. Cause 94 99...they waited category eligible get getting main thing Australia hardcore enforcement.

Link please. one hand agree you

On hand I've made personal commitment get mad 'other people' getting vaccine. even care canadians getting florida, trying verify ANYTHING age slow stuff down. end day, we're going end excess vaccines ordered need plenty people get shot anyways. 

All want states show improvement time getting vaccine simplification rules big part that. Florida it, Cuomo hand forced deblasio. Looking back foolish think could microtarget vaccinations extremely fast, we're learning. 

For example: turns threatening fines vaccinating people order speed things up- lesson learned! move states avoid that. 

The ONE thing worries bidens plan federalizing distribution sites. hope means federally run sites, sending federal coordinator, something lot people asking for- feds running whole thing. States counties running thing right call plan doable. Federal emergency response works usually needed localized disaster, effort entirely uniform across US, adjusted population density. We're starting get legs us, last thing need change everything. federal government mostly writing checks, giving guidance, looking easing making exemptions regulations make go faster. 

gotta go fast. There’s variety things I’m willing get laid. May learn lesson Why? They're literally gonna die soon anyway. Give someone whole life ahead them. God tooth fairy santa claus. Sad people dumb realize it. Anyone know vaccine received? Look compared people city say “never” sound like optimist doomer. don’t give pause blood flowing really cases all. deaths (and maybe hospitalizations long-term side effects, strongly correlated deaths), start significantly decrease cases, since likely die get vaccinated first. Yah, no, way wrong, kids poor spreaders, rather efficient spreaders. right article linked many others easily search yourself. doubt more. thought band qeeun singer Prince studied civics morality school. part confucian social culture mixed modern reverance medical science technology.

Meanwhile really idea going US . incivility outright barbarity shock many asians east asia. subreddit covid, covid news. Honestly 99% people that’s truth America wait line

In UK get queue likely conversation, paying Pfizer doses. guaranteed us more. reassurance, reassuring might swayed decline vaccine fear believe vaccine could cause death. country immunisation register?  

The measles catch-up campaigns (to address cohort 1 shot childhood) really successful (Australia). needed GP’s check immunisation history (on national immunisation register) offer catch shot.  Compliance covid vacs would even higher a) it’s obviously risk b) airlines highly likely insist immunisation we’re allowed fly.  Especially internationally - there’s already plenty precedent providing proof required vaccinations coming certain countries.

Australia same, get tested 4 times process too. countries really threat hotel quarantine. Otherwise virus probably would gone. Gotta bring citizens back cant fk around new strain. FDA approved authorized? wtf talking about? r/COVID19 scientific sub, far anti-vax hate man much next guy, even don’t fault administration decision. Australia, directly mandatory quarantine 14 days work Fortune 50, absolutely attest this. It’s amazing able function stay business viewing things corporate. describes “leadership” T. market based non-GAAP reporting financial engineering/manipulation. believe person charge, also (former, long-term) CDC affiliated brilliant scientist, privy (and first line) data information. Believe CDC scientists instead. Makes sense. Sure. They're talking days off.

Of course working days scheduled for. 

This supposedly national emergency worthy shutting country long period. 3-4k people dying every single day. think unreasonable ask people work extra hours, especially task routine non-demanding sticking needle arm.

I'm cruel person like work people death, desperate times call desperate measures think need accept new normal may call healthcare professionals work 40 hours per week help put end pandemic. Yeah probably still queued hell it. I'm glad government coming back existence January 20. governed working. Remote learning, yeah.
So parents work 8-6.
Kid online learning 8-3 get difficulties getting online class. Nothing go wrong unsupervised 11 year old.
So guess pack breakfast lunch dinner correct?
Like really solution.
Highschool college yeah agree that's good stay home now, long? Lots college students hands subjects. sure want nurse graduated online

We plenty people fighting politics masks, worrying market 401k’s, leadership, real planning, unity. utterly disappointing. AFAIK, I'll happy corrected here, there's nothing suggests new (or rather, old becoming dominant) strain infects using different mechanism? case vaccine still 52% effective.

Yeah, half immunity sort putting selective pressure virus figure new route entering cells, full immunity. I'm understanding 1 dose opposed 2 necessarily bad.

&amp;#x200B;

Also simplistic model viral spread = people contacted \* spread chance, 2 people 52% immune better 1 person 95% immune. ignore immunity lasting part, short term see diluting dose put catastrophic?

I’m member emergency medical reserves (a volunteer part department homeland security) trained decade ago running vaccine clinic pandemic. people planning long time. Sending doses hospitals first takes us though 🤷🏻‍♀️ many ER &amp; ICU healthcare workers want continue even sickened disease? 

These people replaceable without years schooling. 

They replaceable period families get die themselves. spread well. symptomatic adult likely spreads day 3-5, hopefully symptoms start - get tested quarantine stay home.
An asymptomatic child likely spread day 3, continue day 9 10 never feel ill know. Answer blatant lie. Trump 100 mil doses Pfizer, refused another 100 mil went EU countries don’t get summer. Sauce below, feel free google well. Popular theory trump refused Pfizer wasn’t operation warp speed couldn’t take ??? even know word quarantine means? 

Border workers quarantine various goods time.  imported wood chair isn’t sick - might harbouring nasty wood beetle something.

Quarantine obviously sick. Never been. It’s anyone/anything exposed something don’t want spread.

If meant isolation (which word confining known infected don’t spread disease) that’s also traditionally done people appear healthy (but still infected able spread disease).  See Typhoid Mary. That’s got mine far good sore arm. bunch coworker far worse effects including diarrhea nausea/fatigue. kid age 10 capable staying home alone remote learning opinion. Takes care big chunk problem.

We evidence permanent heart damage even mild cases idea people take seriously. 

The priority eliminate spread. Deadass read ""Queen Prince Philip gets COVID"" got scared second Weekends time state vaccinating group essential workers. It’s every weekend ahead time slots 15 people per 20 minutes solid booked. actual answer already bought enough doses every American want put eggs basket. far easy Monday morning quarterback decisions know vaccines succeeded ran troubled. EU debate right countries.

PS: like Trump personally makes decisions trying construe helpful. Dang, I’m guy California got Queen England?? straight wrong infections occur family gatherings.

If simple ""masks work"" n95 masks reserved healthcare workers? n95 masks face shield going provide lot protection layer two cotton. I've yet seen anyone n95 face shield outside health care setting. Got link one? wonder planning vaccinate people voted him. get age factor everything nobody see glaring problem lol... 25 year old complications could've gotten vaccine. There's like 70 year return versus possible 70 hour return consider here... approved Oxford vaccine yet? Go black neighborhood tell black citizens gave freedom catch covid. lazy enough work stopping Waiting health workers don’t want em, unreal ... depending live might able get free antibody testing giving blood want whatever brand vaccine got. That's best one. USA middle ge pack versus European countries per capita.. (slightly worse middle)

The point USA uk France might labeled death spiral nations aren’t “western” outright ignored even poorly. I'm feeling way, job wise. Unemployed since industry died March. much luck.. Let's stop arguing gets first. vaccine sitting unused freezers people dying. AAAHHAHAHHAHA!!! thanks i've looking something like that. US CDC updated ages whole world’s gone insane. Fear hell thing. know *that* contentious issue??? indication that? article doesn’t mention vacation Costa Rica. guess fans martial law. title suggests name Queen Philip.

Use word 'The', headline writers. There's plenty room uphold literacy. hospital worker, I’m glad every single hospital employee offered vaccine whether anyone else Reddit thinks job isn’t essential. nurses clinical staff turned shot, rest staff allowed get descending order exposure patients whether work site not. reality is, need every single person make hospital work even short staffed. HR might sound bullshit you, we’ve needed help people get approved FMLA got sick help manage chaos going since COVID started. 

Unless staff vaccinated, it’s like none staff are. every single ignorant comment like slap face “non-essential” hospital workers busting asses trying support clinical staff. It’s pure Reddit ignorance finest. ~~the US social security administration produces actuarial life table year, presumably UK something similar. document essence tells long average person live current age. someone made age 12, many years likely have? made 72, many years likely have? etc check whatever average covid death age country compare actuarial life table see many years covid cut average life. decide important many years are.~~

okay clear know use actuarial life table anyway, i'll leave information whoever else might reading this. Hello nice meet U.K. variant loose don’t see utility increasing indoor gatherings 8am 6pm whatever times used curfews. Never happened. understand feel need lie, considering beating taken. Lord knows need mental support get 🤣. Gotta embarrassing tho Stop whining. failing year now. whole year get mauled germ  Pfizer holding back political reasons? people wonder majority people aren’t following COVID restrictions anymore. I've ready, there's lack experienced technical staff make vaccines, presumably can't teach quickly, maybe takes 3-6 months. Also there's shortage ingredients quality ingredients needs maintained, whole process stuffed. basically, can't throw money problem immediately get result. waiver doesn’t absolve anyone duty care. . Yeah aren’t getting real point, months ago flamed “downplaying covid” pointing deaths among people near end lives anyway. don’t need vaccines gonna die soon anyway? fuck smoked here? It’s competition. better. year well Thank goodness Brian Roger safe ;) Get feeling, know shit looks bad it’s ever been, 100% end sight, lights bit faint rn We’re positive. no. end sight us. ""free market"" theory invented times small, homogeneous enterprises used present justify unrestricted imposition powerful players weakest. Adam Smith lived see multinational corporations today would reconsider things. turning testing centers vaccination centers way it, frankly.

I'd rather give 3 million jabs per day testing, bunch testing let vaccine rot. Unintended consequences like rule, exception lockdowns. one big reason don’t improve things much would hope. shoes i'd tell vaccine injectors situation ahead time make sure aware i'd whatever drugs needs handy. i'm kinda anxious anal sometimes, i'd probably want even parking lot could see month, nursing home residents completely vaccinated. Pity staff uptake percentages, chose get vaccinated knew accepted risk. least they’re lot less likely die covid residents. right consequences uninfected residents would devastating. There's plenty instructions coming feds. They're online. see yourself.

The problem execution hospital level, healthcare workers dawdling and/or hand-wringing shots getting put arms. thing many people can’t understand. Millions people getting vaccinated. going die days vaccine simply chance. Finding actual correlation, not, take time. It’s also going suck 1 20 people take vaccine get immunity. Covid wants reproduce read trial data see % feel certain things? IFR going CFR? Seems really effective. Even economic point view. Wish rest free world would get shït together.  Nice knoe royalty getting jab  absolutely end sight... US track RIGHT get herd immunity July trudge another couple months! Local governments going trouble something like this. federal government purchasing sending vaccine. appearances, talking state local governments. plan you’re county city? saying great, nationally coordinated effort. Otherwise would like planning D-Day letting individual platoon make plan. Obviously deleted comments like 2-3 times lmao. yes, have, shows badly lost. okay, I'll let entertainment. love watching squirm boil, bash keyboard phone. Ok ......so poor people getting  didnt make statement california, county live in. parts California indoor dining closed.

Okay? case whole state They're still going let single person Phase B get vaccinated every single Phase person vaccinated.

I swear, top priority right far making sure can't get vaccinated. frustrating. hundreds millions doses vaccine, U.S. even ordered mostly wasting away storage facilities numbskulls nursing homes say ""no thanks"" dumb shit read internet.

Meanwhile people like desperate vaccine allowed get July. Honestly, ""breaking"" ? even news? He’s French laundry auntie 50 closest lobbyists. healthcare provider. No, mask work, people compliant. can’t tell many people COVID-19 Christmas dinners. contact tracing, leads back family gatherings. go move Venezuela, 84 ICU beds country 30 million people. let door hit way out.  mean crime rate lower next year? ""Hey guys, sorry government mandated wear mask.""

""Hahaha, no.""

""So going comply instruction?""

""No.""

""Here's written warning. Also bother clocking on."" Winner. Retardo. Amazing. guys rock! DC Rally huge point community transmission related Covid-19 pandemic. (yet comment still got upvoted people bother click read either)  Unbelievably frustrating many families going vaccines rot shelf healthcare providers take weekends (if state provides data day, look # vaccines Friday, Saturday Sunday - infuriating.)  Anyone know irreversible? condition usually treatable? know else started one infection cycle school start? Cooler weather.

Another fun fact: California mostly kept schools closed Fall, help one bit..

Another fun fact: Sweden kept elementary schools open Spring, outbreak still died out..

So, no, obvious much schools contributed Fall wave.. big issue masks people wearing n95. Cloth masks bacially nothing earloop masks barely anything. need n95 barely anyone wearing n95 said no

Literally why??? joke last time actually admitted wanted give shops extra days sell inventory. 😂 ???

I'm saying there's long term effects flu people scream them, supposed scream covid long term effects? hell Newsom doing?

Managing wineries dining French Laundry every weekend. Yeah mandatory here,
New Zealanders wish community else social distance, masks etc I'm calling good news. want country sitting doses anymore. want going available capacity fast humanly possible. 

Yep better going peoples arms sitting around going unused. way know long vaccines good date manufacturing (Like long expire)? first time something, ground breaking science. they've got formula, make 1 million, could make 100 million necessary man power ingredients. ought throw money men thing like there's tomorrow. get faster, get faster. Peoples lives depend it. People known since start masks 100% effective. People want something blame spread masks easy target. Let's Canadian way. 50% increase overdoses 2019 increase suicides cares people killing themselves? Let's make sure granny gets live 2 years.  got second dose yesterday went gym first time since March today. still wear mask feel better going now...   first shot gives significant protection, possibly around 80 percent. need 2 doses sure hit 95% getting many people initial shot crucial given quickly spreading infectious mutations.

We literally race vaccinate many possible, even first dose. Second dose delayed 3 months. far could heard immunity honestly off? They’d getting 1 million cases day min. Quick... get shopping end next weekend.  hear ya, slow things. FDA's approved At-home rapid antigen tests. used DPA ramp production (which vaccines too) everyone could test home see vaccine needed go shot indicated. Again?! fucking shit known like May 2020. He’s also 78 severely compromised health. worrying mutations B117 immune response front. E484K part British variant. ok credit now. put tab. I'll order vaccines US give.

It's less daunting taking student loan. What's worst could happen? much actually pay? Serious issues cost millions dollars treat, may need long-term treatment. EU rejected offer buying couple hundred millions vaccines too. Mistakes made.  
 
What people trying figure say Trump incompetent time vaccination plan faster bought vaccines months sooner. we’re scrambling catch far it’s looking good. ok, know redditors sense humor. Melbourne stay within 5 km home they're basically total lockdown keep control.

In CA barely notice difference.  Everything open.  Sure, takeout food walk store packed.  sign front says they're supposed limited capacity, maybe 20%, nobody enforcing it.

It's big joke. People like problem. counties like Los Angeles keep track recoveries. fair number cases ever resolve according data. HARD PASS think successful vaccination campaign easily quickly change people view things. French person perhaps give better perspective.

Here Israel similar ""problem"", polls November showed 20.3 percent Israeli Jewish respondents 16% Israeli Arab respondents said would willing among first take vaccine. 

Things changed quickly fast roll out, we're nearing 20% country vaccinated already there's still huge demand. stop people coming Mount Everest *won't* can't died within 28 days vaccine use term ""With Vaccine"" like use term ""With COVID""? shit hands. What's person supposed roomie decides dumb shit without telling something? late everyone around already infected. I'll chime seen heard regulation central valley either. Oops, missed that, sorry. thanks see. OP’s denominator wrong point. friend got ventilator month half. still issues liver issues alive. I'm trying realize point. Imagine federal government competent actually working states. know that’s crazy, could be. Palestinians living Israel's civil administration (East Jerusalem), gotten vaccines like Israeli citizen. Palestinians living PA's civil administration (most them) part Israeli healthcare, considered ""another country"" regard. Israel's ministry health say run things, similarly, obligations towards them, either. 
People forget PA's autonomy running business whole reason considered state-in-making first place. defense production act super useful WWII. Factories making brass plumbing fittings went making bullet casings, clothing factories made uniforms, Ford made airplanes. logical step factories US made time make something similar already making. Producing novel mRNA vaccine take lot lead time kick start don’t see Biden thinks production magically ramp month drop hat. said comment I'm allowed buy Californian here. second major lockdown started month ago. thought everything gonna actually close down. Quite opposite. Literally everything open. People eating inside outside tents restaurants without masks. Kids parks playgrounds without masks. Beaches packed year ago, it’s extremely noticeable. city monthly anti mask protests people walk Main Street signs. 

Meanwhile month, one late 20 female marathon runner mtn climber friends spent 3 days ER almost died, thankfully recovered 2 weeks. 

Nobody cares anymore. It’s sad. Yes. Agreed worst case scenario. It’s essentially like new virus, ways. there’s good news tweaks vaccine we’re months one. However manufacturing distribution, well, seen that’s going round 1.  Scientists U.K., Mexico India stupid. (And likely approval Europe end month). 

It looks far like bureaucratic risk-aversion. *massive* cost suffering, long term complications, death associated waiting many months high-volume vaccine already proven prevent severe COVID. 

Lingering questions efficacy elderly avoided (for now) giving frontline workers. dumb 328 days infect every single person US. However, even percentage population resistance covid (via prior infection vaccine) would slow spread substantially. country lost. It’s states’ shoulders exactly Trump administration abdicated responsibility lead us this. would far efficient manage centrally. Instead we’ll 50 different solutions chaos entails. failure absolutely sits Trump. incompetence put us position. dumb way it, sure, nobody arguing that, think question clearly things terrible, wondering going get point regardless. bring Christian America level... Realistically, 100% population won’t take it. plan get kids since they’re risk, adults they’re exposed vaccinated (like teachers). percentage population anti vaccine. percentage doesn’t “get around” (like flu shot year). percentage population don’t believe it. percentage population already recently, doesn’t feel urgency need get vaccine. 

Anyway, guess we’ll end 200 million vaccinated said done. That’s 400 million doses, Pfizer already said US get. there’s Moderna probably more. everybody vaccinated spring early summer imho. Thanks! Turns US. notice change, much keep right now. nihilist, take offense. using word incorrectly. probably hard find statistically significant pool volunteers aged 85+ register online studies mean, sure *can* spread it.

But they're poor spreaders, least they're low ground low lung capacity. vaccine very, good preventing severe symptoms, currently believe mildly symptomatic asymptomatic cases bad spreading, compared severely symptomatic cases. contact tracing study found asymptomatic cases infected 0.3% close contacts, mild cases 2%, severe cases 6%. (Note asymptomatic pre-symptomatic, people stay symptom-free throughout rarely infectious, went severe symptoms infected higher percentage contacts felt perfectly well.) /r/COVID19/comments/iccj85/contact_settings_and_risk_for_transmission_in/

This study found attack rates 4.6% contacts mild cases 7.5% contacts critically/severe. study look asymptomatic cases. /r/COVID19/comments/jkaluq/risk_factors_associated_with_covid19_infection_a/

Those studies natural infections, vaccine mediated asymptomatic/mild cases similar better preventing spread. vaccines either prevent transmission altogether dramatically reduce it, would strange Covid turned exception. Well I've waiting whole life, he? he's dipshit Good. olympians passed away slightest. go help LTC’s  herd immunity got dumbest idea ever, gonna cause much deaths, covid, people can't get hospital care, like right now, covid. Logistically helpful likely inexperienced unqualified critical care ICU management Vaccine infection don’t necessarily generate antibodies. Hopefully you’re right, quite reinfections worse symptoms. think likely supply distribution disruption would happen jeopardize 2nd doses. rather one happen magnitude would screwed anyway. seeking vaccinate certain amount people, vaccinate certain time.

I confident accomplished sitting doses ensure second doses. think matter looking short term gains, guilty this, situation moot point.

At least risk populations health care workers need vaccines arms fast possible unlikely able recoup supply needed second doses 21 days since numerically small enough compared projected vaccine supply chain period time.

After populations fully protected deaths brought hospital staffs less danger incapacitated, afford cautious suggest. larger younger vaccination group, concerns raise could outweigh benefit maximizing vaccination speed. 

The dangers control infection rates leading mutations still makes lean toward expediency least limited protection way go get infection rates down. 

Right though vaccine freezers populations acceptable right now. get train rolling. Clueless cucked klan, will. agree makes sense based phase 3 trial participants. new trial children done considering young new variant trending. assuming gotten symptoms, still alot people sick... Canada changed policy recently, since known mechanism vaccine cause harm fetus Covid infection extra risky pregnant women, recommendation pregnant women get vaccine desire discussed physician. www.cbc.ca/amp/1.5865918

""""After careful review, women pregnant breastfeeding longer excluded receiving COVID-19 vaccinations. able make informed decision consulting health-care provider benefits risks,"" spokesperson Ministry Health said statement Friday response questions CBC News."" Hope there's bias here, factual news. CNN bode well. Based history. change headline to, “Pfizer says, vaccines US government paid six months ago delivered another 7 months”. still late wear masks social distance People got complacent there's large backlash restrictions, therefore low compliance. Volunteer corps leave hospitals vulnerable. onerous medicolegal complications could lead new free post pandemic likely staying hand useful. Medical malpractice likely wavered hospital staffing, Getting qualified experienced staff difficult even without current staff shortages around country. take 6 months certain states become licensed qualified physicians. “In event reincarnated, would like return deadly virus, contribute something solving overpopulation.”

- Prince Phillip entire politifact analysis bullshit.

Point 1: Yes, asymptomatic people spread virus. Secondary attack rate people 0.7% compared 18% symptomatic people according study.

Point 2: study compares house transmissions asymptomatic sympotmatic people easier track. mean asymptomatic person suddenly becomes infectious outside house, far less symptomatic people look secondary attack rates mentioned.

Point 3: Yes, nothing statement ""debunking"". Like I'm fan Trump, I'd rather people guaranteed second dose fly dark hope supply chain able keep would trust Pulse Ox. low 90s sustained period hits 80s keeps dropping, want go hospital. Actually tell increase heat levels compared normal home temperature. many people would take would packed house. main thing shows house green houses. thermal images used get warrants US search marijuana.  encouraged, vaccination impact R° think vaccination positive impact, even slightly higher mobility.  It’s crazy mention trump, regardless context people attack site. literally said nothing wrong believe one proposal specific issue might better another one.

If government mandated work 1 2 extra 12 hour shifts week I’d quit spot. Fuck I’m putting even higher risk bringing home family Children get anytime soon, Stop drama queen. Lockdown barely three months.

Sure, sucked, enough public weeping nearly 'breaking' you. anyone dropping bombs us. 3 tested positive along symptoms well? using example things people household experiencing besides also common covid. right California people currently COVID people already COVID combined? 1/10 100% agreed! great news back napkin math....1/3rd Americans vaccinated end July. That's gonna enough begin thinking normalcy. whole year going write off? Ugh cmon. I’m lapsed Catholic inaccurate takes away good things Pope does. cant wait till release AC: Guatemala hasn’t nearly level now.

You speculating actual cases triple tested cases (1 million day instead 399k).

If case far, we’d 70 million people it. Leaving 260 million haven’t.

If need 70% herd immunity that’s needing 231 million, 70 already that’s another 161 days, 5 months. It’s also twice many deaths.

Hopefully vaccine game changer kidding me. 20% of...what? Cool story pathetic. zoomed friend Montreal 8.30 pm cars going St Henri... Surreal. Cleared expedited many normal hurdles marketing new drug vaccine. 

We know Biden squat. course supply moment professor does, think important governments world prepare huge upscaling administering vaccines. point counties get supplies 5-6 different companies scale need vaccinate huge percentage per week. Remember bad testing spring 2020? Vaccinations likely follow path, we're really frustrated, ""why can't test more?"", suddenly ""my entire family got tested twice Tuesday"".

Anecdotal, friends got recently basically zero side effects, like bit sore arm bumped corner doorway, absolutely nothing consequence. 

I concerned might wipe bit day two, least people know that's case. UK gotten point give everyone positive status demand people stay home isolation. complete circuit breaker go outside groceries exercise neighborhood. Companies schools must close. Testing everyone point cause infections increase mobility. also changed rules need test get flight think. Yea think kinda bullshit. shouldn’t someone like dad who’s 60 works people every single day this

Seems like gigantic waste resources  bottleneck actually distribution delivery control government improve. Right seems like major problem. Ohio age based starting couple weeks... 80, 75, 70, 65... 5 years week. Cough Cough Rock Lee naruto chough ended working ok mean trump (the administration) fuck rotten corrupt decision *could* significantly delayed vaccine schedule. lucked spite trump. still shit move bad potential. fauci duped something common sense masks? Yup. getting tough wife whole family cooped up. natural. Honest question: California bad? outside, seems like California among strictest restrictions nation. thing spiraling control? Probably wait see results J&amp;J trials counting effective one dose others two. Must feel nice getting 2nd doses suggested biontech many others delayed hoping it'll still effective. Don’t dismiss local governments incompetence. local government hometown ordered thousands vaccines didn’t cold storage. people said prepare getting freezers ready told vaccine gets FDA approval, shouldn’t waste tax dollars. 
Now FDA approved, it’s taking time freezers arrive people install them. 
The person/doctor advising instead pushed use hydroxychloroquine costed thousands dollars facilitate. That's people getting. 3 months already freaking late. Hell 5 weeks also late. 

This shit hitting hard RIGHT everywhere. Thanks warp speed, states moving grass growing speed ISNT GOOD ENOUGH.

I told APRIL earliest FL, like June, good enough. gotten along everyone else work place. Either two, yes. suspect Oxford, although probably done Windsor household staff 'care home staff' could used larger quantity.  Naah, holidays over. Cases peak next week two long slow grind flu season winds vaccinations ramp Yeah read Dow calling Jay lack urgency. handling pandemic King county going seal fate Dow’s political career. 


There’s lots talk want one senate seats governors chair open up. I’m glad competent manager charge locally. Yet got voted back in. Guess majority likes asshat charge.  Heheh hear pain desperation comments. Let little guy, I'm 

And shreeking DeLeTeD cOmMeNtS again. Like would ever worry enough delete comment 😅  keep responding person like they're republican? really weird makes look crazy 4 seasons Crown! Even 3% CA putting 40-60k cases day, means around 1200-1800 day admitted hospital, doesnt seem slowdown cases state either.    workplace do? manager allows breaking law. Orange County California. They're well known conservative area around them. Plenty parts California indoor dining closed. post gonna get ton Karma virtue title.  bright, I'll make exception you. literally copy words lol well yeah, not, called that. soured this. Resorting deleting comments lmao cowardice. think type, young one. I’m thrilled they’re so, note King County spending 7mil it. decent chunk tech-business residents county net worth higher that!

Still, even giving message need sort mass vaccinations sites probably half point, applaud it. Thanks math! People need aware relative many different countries! I'd go games, then, yes. thought still catch it, all. yet *proven* don't, that's trials designed look it. unlikely still spread it.

I'm chute get week next, due work role. week that, I'll everything normally...I'll depending everything else opening. Lol I'm reaching anything. I'm top mountain, kicking back, watching struggle.

Hey remember said this:

Lol stop switching words. proof there. Pathetic come back try switch up. Got owned again. Cya even worth called dweeb now

But kept commenting, like simp are. Man I'm really head. stop 🤣 Gimmie Newsom holding vaccines? way see it, every dumbass refuses ( real medical reasons ) 1 less person wait behind family get it, gonna suck anti vax/anti covid, refuse it, get covid insurance goes, ooooooh yea that, vaccine refused it, thats bad, covering hospital bill. Look studies starting come UK South Africa.

The main worry much organ damage kids, brain damage (which lasting effects).

Even height wave NY last year, Doctor warning seeing large incidents kids affected worried could spread school. There's also apparently major portion black community vaccine skeptic due past victims inhumane experimentation recall. believe way try convince community vaccine covid 19 trusted. Uh, wouldn’t?

Considering running vaccines would mean lots people wouldn’t able get 2nd Pfizer/Moderna shot schedule  Black folk US likelier whites distrust medical system general CDC particular, [with damned good  America ""not ready administer have"" Wow bunch wack jobs there. Especially guy considering taking 17th preparing weapons 👀   “A spokesperson NHS England said: “Prof Bell’s reported comments suggest may know current time actually number vaccines available NHS deploy.” lmao Palliative care basically death camp. main difference, course, trying mitigate suffering, instead maximizing it. Exactly.

I hate people still saying this.

Just get better informed mate 🙄   Honestly point fuckton reasons think vaccines prevent spreading, matter much PH officials want push concern us studied tocilizumab months ago unimpressive results. remember really hoping drug would much greater efficacy, generally disappointed. data I’ve read points bradykinin storm, opposed cytokine storm, mechanism action overactive immune response lead fatality patients. 

Does anyone idea recommending tocilizumab? Wasn’t also studied conjunction dexamethasone spring/summer ? know, right? California talk tough restrictions, people dying record numbers, kinda moot. sense vaccine could rushed

You sense things, like feelings.

You look get facts. curfew simply designed make enforcement prohibition home gatherings easier. Source: I'm Melbourne, 7 month lockdown nearly broke me.

And yes, click &amp; collect home delivery meant way shop.  ""drump bad"" funniest reddit meme point. dude horrible president, there's people blame game thrones ending him. Disagree? Must ronal dfump fan! Realistically going scary amount dumbasses refuse it, definitely need 330m worth :( sounds right me. LA County hit 900,000 cases 45k hospitalization that's 5 percent. stats active cases thread incorrect, LA County large counties report active cases total cases. Well, Iowa one one places. okay! cold medicine ready 2nd dose. friend got 2nd trials, said felt sick 1 day went away quickly.

Hang hope feel better soon! Yes. Sorry bad. RIP take care stay safe everyone. need hang months. Newsom knows shutdowns. He’s completely incompetent. nothing stupidity defense article. they're saying slap random symptoms even exist!?! hell know medication causing what?

And, yes, I've going work entire time. lost day due covid. matters topic. Keep topic.

The Chinese manufacturer saying they're randomly throwing unrelated symptoms warning. sort half-ass effort that? don’t think guy come fire. tank gas round trip family cabin family lives with? Yeah no, think perfectly reasonable. 

But yeah, politicians Alberta justifiably come “under fire” decided travel Mexico, Hawaii, Caribbean holidays (some citing “family tradition”) restrictions put place meant constituents allowed see family didn’t live holiday despite “family tradition”). support restrictions, don’t support hypocrisy.   744 deaths per million, places California 39th US.

It's wildly varying different parts state.  San Francisco county 264 deaths per mil (233 total), Los Angeles count 2965 deals per mil (11,863 total). related COVID-19, related Canadians.

The company Dad works small branch (~10 people) Toronto. Apparently branch well one quarter, funds give bonuses higher-performing, harder-working employees branch.

Apparently employees got together agreed that, either everyone gets equal bonus (and would’ve TINY amount, anyway), one gets bonus.

So, naturally, higher-ups said, “Okay, one’s getting bonuses.”

Damn Canadians polite. really shot feet move. Melbourne. curfew stop indoor gatherings, police probably use thermal scanning helicopters every night check. tough thing live curfew, it'll head in, come low/cases. It'll take long time. Good luck. friend means is,” that’s horrible RIP friends neighbors.” Look MIT videos aerosol effect use really cool lasers.

I would loved seen one that's shared somebody farting seeing spreads Coronavirus far, mean Corona virus system know we're spreading flatulence well breathing? 

Joke/No Joke compare, average flu season kills American every 15 minutes. losing twice amount people one single county entire country loses typically flu time period. awesome, thanks again! i'm wondering get second dose, feel safe doing/not safe doing?

What want right not? going sporting events, well, sorry still can't mostly exist. visiting friends, you? know 4 people got Moderna vaccine. 4 sore arm. 1 said upset stomach pretty sure eat poorly. Right, suggesting American way? Cuz see hasn’t worked. Canada good job first province others dropped ball well. Yea everyone simps now. Dude's past getting white washed flowing hospitals huge part problem.

major reason new zealand went lock quickly, around 180 ICU beds country, prime minister ashley bloomfield(healthcare leader) made decision lockdown needed anymore beds that, people would dying cant give care need science sub, they're pretty much pro vax lol He’s saying everyone stupid except one asked anything. vaccinate many countries. actually end sight Right? double take reassess way browse Reddit. Lol source says there’s enough data support what’s basically assumption.

“But get — test possibility — must act fast must quickly acquire data.” 3PlayMedia looked legit me, failed test round 2 :( 

They're really strict certain styles they'd like things transcribed in. dude vaccine like 5 months away millions people priority.

Literally third country ""priority"". point, really matter? Infections way hypochondriac really stressed.  could somewhat get behind this. change priority bracket bug get ahead bracket something? Uh, Hawaii ""absolutely terrible"" idea exactly? realize quarantine arrival 14 days anyway therefore putting Canadians risk, right? mention Hawaii much stricter COVID regulations places begin with. Meanwhile, Florida get vaccine donor nursing home. fact UK allowing private vaccinations administering via NHS stops corrupt acts like one Florida. illnesses traumas regularly fill ICUs stopped. try reading targets set compare, hit targets anything. can't make list targets. plausible mechanistic explanation vaccine could cause this, safe. burden proof anyone claiming otherwise. Florida giving vaccines anyone, regardless home is. Live outside US? C'mon get vaccine. ID says 65 older... slap face frontline workers Canadian snow bird push teachers/grocerystore/resutrant workers way take vaccine.  I'm dismissing unhelpful hide comment thread simply started mildly incorrect/correct opinion. Moderna testing 12+ sooner. heard end year kids. forget behavior changes.. getting worse South. Try adding multivitamin, iron, B12 d. cure, deficient things, correcting deficiency take edge brain fog manageable. 

I see talked maybe I'm lunch, sick eating well time it, seems reasonable become deficient certain vitamins, deficiency contribute symptoms. 

(again, cure, medical advice. something I've found helped (non-covid) pneumonia) ""dire""

dire UK US, paltry 3800 deaths amount done within week. laboratory investigation cases requires paired specimens available (one episode) sufficient viral load,” Ginny Streeter, spokeswoman state’s health department, told BNO News response inquiry. “If cases like substantially increase next months, long-lived protective immunity SARS-CoV-2 likely, would line human coronaviruses, might impact current vaccine development strategies based eliciting neutralizing antibody responses,” team said preprint paper. Premier Daniel Andrews, speaking press conference, said expert panel reviewed case found wasn’t enough evidence say positive test caused persistent viral shedding, it’s regarded reinfection. jit single target area.

???

The UK first world approve covid vaccinations, first world start vaccinating, done vaccinations whole EU.

Of course they're hitting targets. Good man, know need told right thing do. Stay strong, hopefully shit show mostly done! lot going happen regardless lockdowns. went back work start summer slow. much economy based consumers going spending money lockdown not, way down. 

A lot continued destruction small business still going happen slow economy. People dont want crowded places. economy depends crowded places.

People seem think bang gong declare ""the economy OPEN"" magically gears consumerism start turning, driven prayers miracles. annoying hell. forced go work Gov. here...yet he's giving vaccine old people vacation. I’m waiting for. 17 yo 13 yo. I’m glad 17 yo get want 13 yo get well. Glad hear testing teens feel sorry 12 ones haven’t even started testing yet. work health service.... near numbers need put up. load vaccinations cancelled week.

There many people UK going simply refuse get vaccinated.... Irrespective blowback rest country. dismissing u/equals1's response? *Thank you*. really hoping something like would already. According CDC numbers 20% deaths age 65

That's true everything tends affect elderly; minority younger people also die. That's true cancer, Alzheimer's, seasonal flu. tends affect elderly, younger guaratee get it. Covid unique that's significant hit people work force

Yeah, unlike businesses going operating properly

See previous dangerous mutations might develop

That actually happening despite strict lockdowns. fact hunch *because* lockdown. think virus naturally evolving become better spreading lockdown getting basically tortured death completely alone.

Again, that's lockdown does. 

The one valid point potential overwhelm health service. say; that's problem. health services cannot handle health crisis they're incompetent. Crises happen. Pandemics happen. think would go rest forever without virulent strain virus becoming widespread country? better prepared paying price lack forward planning. realized 1918 pandemic, normalized flu season annual flu shots. years, we'll flu covid season annual shots. kids know ever different. Yes ramped up, enough. believe government fool. jit single target area. promises fuck up. Track trace failed promises, ppe failed, testing failed etc etc etc. noticed three things made health politicians discouraged use masks. 

 - One hospitals would need lots masks &amp; feared shortage. 

 - Another business lobby pressured providing masks (single use safety gear) expense industrial lords want.

 - third reason highly educated people arrogantly mocked masses suggestion virus would become pandemic cause problems worldwide. people simply felt convinced human beings earth dumb dirt takes panic ""a little flu"".

I think Fauci belongs third category. think belongs first category apparently feels okay untruthful facts believes ""reasons"". either way, health politicians lied populations *""for reasons""* apparently stop certain pressure populations behave certain titles makes certain humans impervious corruption. Funny people different opinions post them. almost Reddit one person millions people? Newsom power fire elected sheriffs. bullshit voters. 11 hour delay fetching comments.

It frustrates people react like covid rising population exist time? important weigh factors get real understanding brainlessly looking statistics.  limited doses. There’s two ways go this, immunize vulnerable ones transmitting it.

Now 150 sq km area locked mask use mandatory least Monday whilst contact trace test. Plus $1150 fines anyone refusing wear mask outside they’re allowed be.

That's 46 cases yesterday province 75 million.

Article clarify, clickbait headline makes seem 360 reported Hebei one day. that's totally unintentional, 360 people tested positive growing COVID-19 outbreak south Beijing neighboring Hebei province.  National Health Commission reported Sunday 69 new cases confirmed latest 24-hour period, including 46 Hebei. hope live away parents sound insufferable. live them, sucks feel you, considering lived sucky parents while.

Masks supposed temporary measure all. Claiming masks better vaccines ludicrous irresponsible CDC's part. Wear god damn mask others, yourself. kind people think outraged making threats due someone going cabin? sounds like anti-lockdown/anti-maskers, genuinely concerned people. true. Hospitals designed operate near capacity majority time uncommon ICUs filled capacity Winter seasons. Hospitals ration care since beginning time. 4 times year. don’t need prove anything mate, ludicrous comment. saw bunch people go royals, made comment. 

Have day off. I...don't really see anyone would care? upvotes, guess someone does. Um what. ever inside hospital?    read article twice, find references current infection/death rate Manuas. anyone recent info this? asymptomatic positive I'd careful assuming study's implications actually applied specific circumstance.

This curious about. mild symptoms test positive I've wondering risk factor now. Obviously, I'm maintaining social distancing mask wearing.   government definetely aware that. NZ already ordered vaccines, they're due arrive Q2 2021. fairer say point hospital *render* life saving care, generally decide receives it. case, inability falls squarely shoulders pretending pandemic passed never existed. area. counties much smaller population others get categories quicker. Ya it’s crazy turned around.

I remember getting tested first time like “damn I’m pretty lucky gotten test done!”

Like 10 tests later I’m like, “damn hope nurse quick swab else nose going hurt minute.” many arrivals total? Could interesting way estimate current infection levels around world. 1.5 million people got vaccine Queen...

Makes happy nobody gets jump queue UK. re-election year I'm sure say got voted back in. less 50% vote first place. history itp 2015 taking bactrim (drug induced? never knew. Hemotologist insisted itp) think (but sure) COVID platelets screwy. tiny petechiae thighs went away recovered. 

It really effs blood. That’s sure. Why? avoidable? use term? think metric pay attention hospitalization rates.

I suspect couple months. tragedy. like article states, 5 million Americans received vaccine people die inexplicably time. may link here, well may be. Particularly since reaction immediate [Mass vaccinations scheduled second half border personnel supposed start Q2. ""Reddit Assumes Worst"" Cool, hospitals full, bad media makes sound. think anyone going storing 144 packs vaccines houses like toilet paper last March. Yeah, can't totally rely Pfizer. Moderna vaccines, 100 million end first quarter 2021. AZ/Oxford, ordered 300m of, know we'll getting those. 

I also hearing J&amp;J/Janssen supposed point study apply EUA soon, VRBPAC calendar yet. I'm guessing February. one 1 dose vaccine. There's also Novavax, started US Phase 3 trial, think we'll see shots arms anytime soon. There’s really reason believe happen experts seem expect happen period time. There’s evidence effective year possibility escape variants happening within months. thinks Biden would get credit. ended creating situation Biden would get credit. state still hasn’t figured exactly second group... month this...  Source? could sign get virus shit end everyone would fast. Thrombocytopenia absolute scary thing happen body. felt absolutely fine platelets demolishing body 2015. look post history posted rash looked like. looked like someone beat board. hospital doctors disputed room near couldn’t agree whether itp caused bactrim antibiotic taken autoimmune disorder called ITP. 

This story made pause bit tracks honest. I’m health care worker due get vaccine 29th. I’ve remission itp since 2015 makes wonder going happen take it. there's shortage ingredients quality ingredients needs maintained

That seems like good place start throwing money problem then. Apparently death 13 days today... whole family 5 days second Pfizer shot. Done sub lol. gotta hold till then.

Everyone moment it’ll awesome! Always recommended china strat since last spring problem since hospitals can't sure receive second doses also sitting second dose. Effectively sitting 75% doses. Combine sitting doses give right people, leads significant majority vaccines sitting nothing. Toughest name only. Restrictions good enforcement behind city even tried enforce simple mask mandate let alone anything else. like 4th july sex thanksgiving gave birth xmasbirthdayween town since first lockdown. wife's classroom came back month teaching remotely one aides tested positive Friday. teaching remotely next week told expect back person week after. know anymore. big immune response comes second dose. First dose almost noticeable side effects anyone. Hmph. wonder average age subjects study was. don’t believe minute every police officer would willing throw away career, benefits pension, pandemic, issue wanting write tickets people violating public health ordinance. 

I don’t even believe small minority would willing so. think minute came chain command don’t fall line, they’re fired, vast majority would fall line they’re people families feed, lose job won’t feeding families. ask boss stop pandemic. 6000 deaths per day then? 2.5% last saw. That’s probably date. called comfort care measures, ongoing long family agrees menyion 3-day weekend right now. 

Won't surprised coming Tuesday Wednesday numbers (i.e. results tests done around Saturday~Monday) lower 1,100~1,800 range we've seeing now. people return cars CNA/EMT's wonder around parking lot menacing looking EpiPens

Absolutely reason single provider adequate support vaccinate 1K+ per day

Have support screen-out people questionnaire, someone drawing shots someone else post vaccine certificate whatever people patrolling surrounding area looking serious adverse events. heard he/his company stock moderna vaccine, wanted :/ easy say ""what shocker"" ignore fact infectious children exact environments crucial solve equation (if all) schools run.

Armchair solutions vein ""just stop everything"" naïve idea schools perfectly safe run. trick finding right balance.

Technically everything unsafe, pandemic not. may get hit bus crossing street. never leave home. That's easy useless conclusion. fully comprehend comment? process focuses avoiding giving anyone vaccine order, go slower people got order jumped line. *laughs Big Pharma* I'll live life want, live life want. year now, we'll alive happy choices made. :) black plague. roommate gets it, light belongings fire.

But no.

You realize controlled studies this, happens anyway, much larger scale schools throughout world, except can't make conclusions based it, controlled. many times vaccinated 200 million people 2 dose regiment global pandemic occurring fast possible? that’s ground breaking logistical science need occur. Unfortunately can't really control roommate does, small space hard 100% avoid catching it. people can't afford move take extra expense either.

But maybe cat old fat catch mice anymore. able anything, really. two possible outcomes:

 1. get COVID without vaccine
 2. get COVID vaccine

Try best second group. China lies data. Hospitals overflowing. understand that? personal freedom less important right now. tracking number vaccinations given excel?

Strawman arguments like pretty know works hospital short staffed working crazy overtime.

And yet data shows vaccinations drop Friday, Saturday Sunday. frankly they're usually bit lower Mondays well.

The data paints picture semi-lazy office workers putting bare minimum, group people working hard get vaccine door. Younger people needing hospital care driving factor hospitals overwhelmed UK according article. know death isn’t factor consider. May rest peace. Nah still strange. Reasonably quick maybe one year now.

2021 basically last year terms Covid world. Korea, much top duration pandemic, never far either. population density actually higher Japan's though many people know. statistics often type thing occurs flu vaccines

I'm sure happened, dont remember one story someone full died flu vaccine People quarantine, think depends family strict is. One person knew returned, picked car parents left airport (they’d returned train), drove city stayed hotel two weeks eating delivery food. Another returned, picked car parents left airport (they’d returned train). drove family home stayed house two weeks, mostly room. 

They negative tests airport, quarantine still. one stayed family home September, December new variant tier 4 announced (which tbh might 2nd guy stricter quarantine). even government right now? Israel important case study. Additionally lockdown along aggressive vaccine rollout help keep data cleaner well presumably cut people getting Covid days week first dose offers virtually protection. working extra, hours working understaffed patient load have. 

The data shows true. Vaccinations collapse Friday stay way thru Saturday Sunday. nurses providers need time rest decompress.

Sure, need 3-day weekends every week. Again, providers working even OT reason vaccinated yet.

Of course is. else shots done Friday, Saturday Sunday? Lol find legit every single r/Coronavirus post flair ""Central &amp; East Asia"" mildly relates china. Judging post history basically *all* post about. (that LA clippers) starting wonder real bot here. would actually prevent covid deaths.

Do idea yet well one vaccine interacts another? is, get first stage vaccination Pfizer Moderna available I'm wondering interact boost should? made written complaint BBC last night objection fear mongering nonsense. 

It’s media bias, yet again, along lines SPI-B wanting young people know truth badly getting screwed over. OFCOM legally obliged let sort claptrap become prevalent, without opposition question. 

Same Ferguson’s admission Times morning infection infer protection least year, wouldn’t go far admitting protection didnt extend re-infection. Well guess what. Neither vaccine. Many saying exactly admitted accused quackery 4 months ago.

SARS victims still hold immunity. 18 years infected ffs. That's 100% says. paper asymptomatic carriers makes mention long covid. Well Japan struggling, weeks entire US Healthcare system shut down.  Nah. They’ll fine. Even dies unexpectedly, there’s clear process elect next one. half restrictions wich nothing. Like idiotic home 8pm go school work.

Makes sense, already studies showing gargling salt water shortens duration intensity colds flus. Well, impossible, best option.

Attention, publicity, grandeur, etc. lost they're held year. would especially case Beijing hosts Tokyo 2022.  know guy spent 43 days hospital 32 ICU. give hope. don’t use evidence, else wouldn’t skeptics

Scepticism primarily feeling. unsure something. need _prove_ scepticism look hundreds thousands deaths also look 2 - 3 deaths way. sociopath showing. good news aren’t high risk? vaccine available everyone refuse help someone vaccinated needs ICU help. wanted choice fucking lockdowns anyways. incorrect. That's all. Rapid tests good body riddled covid; thats used persons exposed frequently cases. Im front line worker exposed high viral load many covid fragments body/nose. PCR looks specific RNA COVID-19; takes longer result however, trade accuracy. 

 read 700,000 people got first dose? seems ramping up, no? 100% agreed, totally. CDC still monitoring regarding allergies. also recommended contact doctor prior decision.

Safety Health #1 curiosity, since seem like reasonable person here, state/County doing?

We sort overwhelmed cases still going up. lot doctors nurses sometimes weary, others truly fighting pulling aid Covid-19 patients, others non Covid-19 related patients, times easy balance out. Don’t say that!!! could racist propaganda. ""look blacks, know good them"". 

If true, interesting worthy thought, reflection, kind want source believe black people refusing vaccine disproportionately. wood infested something, sick. God's plan... Right? One time thought could get mosquitoes lol  Pretty sure already Vaticanated well. lateral flow tests? sensitive enough often pick asymptomatic AFAIK  population density Tokyo alone amazing. step outside home, usually tiny good luck staying home, everything crammed, convenience stores subway streets restaurants - close contact people. solace masks hygiene. can’t get much faster 15 minutes want people wait around 15 minutes ensure don’t reaction. ~5 minutes takes get someone sign forms, sit chair, give shot, 20 minutes close theoretical minimum you’re gonna get. F can’t compare countries haven’t left Japan year people generally pretty good masking here. Summer saw handful people without masks everyone always wearing one restaurant Fear mongering. Articles like dangerous damaging share. Millions people vaccinated without problem. There's reason think vaccine anything death.

It could easily dead ""A 'healthy' doctor died two weeks eating hamburger"" ""a healthy doctor died riding bus"". 1) afraid devices China racist. Considering Chinese government.

2) vaccine gone trials prove safety, it’s still possible there’s side effects, however minimal risk.

3) find information want find couple different sources, don’t present told wrong, present casual information. crucial containment. Finding asymptomatic cases essential top spread. China months ago. use too? Would recurrent flushing nasal cavity cause sort secondary issue? Good hear There's also fair amount division whether earth round.

We know lot human body mechanism vaccine could influence thoroughly observed well understood. Sure, side effect could trigger new mechanism body yet know about, odds happening much much lower coronavirus ravaging body. Thank you! exactly right.


I'd like add following.


The current problem vaccine administration.  Approximately, one-third distributed vaccine doses given vaccine hesitancy, seen even among healthcare workers first Walgreens take Jan 25, even get first dose nursing made vaccinations available anyone 65+. Public demand overwhelming, elderly waiting overnight. state can't keep public demand, appointments booked February.  However per CDC, lot doses remain unused.

Florida: 1.36 million doses distributed

400,000 people already many vaccine doses way.  Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna plan produce 200 million doses combined end March. Johnson &amp; Johnson possibly approved maybe developing effective avenues administration takes time.  Perhaps J&amp;J approved, ability stored refrigerators help.  So, meantime?


Well-established proven public health strategies used successfully countries, education, clear communication, increased testing, financial support, countering false information, increased mask production, etc. include countries Liberia, Senegal, Uganda, India, Colombia, South say want release vaccine doses anyway, ends delaying second dose?  data effectiveness AstraZeneca-Oxford. data Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines same.  cannot extrapolate AstraZeneca-Oxford data Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna. even similar mechanisms efficacy.   


For vaccines, necessary restart dose 1 second dose delaying second dose results lower effectiveness, can't administer booster doses?  Well, research suggests vaccines could possibly lose effectiveness repeat still approximately two-thirds distributed vaccine doses still sitting freezers.  Better avenues administration need developed.  meantime, effective public health interventions utilized. 22 winter olympics! Im tired  Yeah reminds HIV came ways said could avoid catching ways could catch (most wrong end) Great. need help get. lockdowns mean nothing law enforcement refuses anything it. police officers wearing masks, seriously think going enforce Coronavirus restrictions checkpoints individuals?

Idk, might become time get Joe local cop Nowheresville, Mississippi fine people without valid reason due shortfalls local budgets need somehow refill local coffirs, even then, would still require polar opposite mindset (and would probably step fines taxes even considering that). Anyone getting vaccine logical. rare time backup Pope available needed. Bolsheviks also stormed shot dead entire russian monarchy tossed graves. 5 kids included. 14 95,000 yet Newsom calls 'a great success' bet get even faster kinks worked out. I’ve three tests NYU hospital get faster time. Last time took longer walk hospital entrance testing location medical school, entire checkin testing process. flu test well Covid - 5 minutes most. need here! Big assumption proper vaccine supply &amp; logistics...which Canada (where I’m from) politicians messing hospitals running similar vein, look relatively small IFR say ""that's still lot people"" look vaccine-related deaths way. would true? taking vaccine? believe god's will? Maybe age thing matters risks one covid also wealth lifestyle allowed have. 

The difference mortality risk 95 years old 59 years old grossly outweigh risk infection extremely wealthy person spend whole quarantine mansion completely isolated school teacher risks getting infection every day taking public transportation, interacting people, groceries such. that's even considering dangers covid besides death much treatment one gets massively improve situation. occasionally read. often though. jumped check first thing see post religious symbolism peppered throughout insurgent attack America. was. obscene amount people attacking America name god. groups like ISIS form. America. Thanks right wing extremism. health minister btw.

Dude health minister since long time I'm staring see ER contracts guys high 40/hr LA. interested may want look travel nurse groups Facebook. Good point. article also criticized staff got vaccinated. folks go whole hospital, labs, offices (and academic facilities too) - perfect superspreaders. many sick, whole place falls apart potentially affecting patient care. stupid eyes read “Pepe’s personal doctor dies COVID-19 complications” double take one.. Maybe get vaccinated? RemindMe! July 23 Western tradition? Since forcing people allow spread deadly disease tradition?

Oh wait, that’s basically America since day 1.. ^ This.

I can't help think articles minority people wanting vaccine mainly serving take spotlight away US government's incompetence securing, distributing, administering vaccines. current problem. Olympics need live without corruption profiteering. sponsors anyone charge expects pampered. need demand law enforcement agencies actually uphold law. can’t ok “well police don’t want that”.

If don’t want that, kick asses force.  masks thing back Yeah government resources time wealthier countries. Like canada getting wage subsidies etc. help pay employees curbside pickups, also programs rent restaurant. Still means easy restaurant worker myself, lot owner friends still able keep roof establishment themselves.  Exactly. One offer special treatment. Decline? Fine. line keeps moving. medical person changes mind cut line then. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article True. read include estimate, age distribution changes. Include would bit higher.  I'd say everyone involved (already) vaccinated. E.g. drivers, cooks, hotel staff, especially audience. Oh point say take reasonable measures try shield elderly loved ones. agree that, covid dangerous old. government imposed lockdown? Hell no.

Frankly think gaslighting government. Covid marketed century crisis, not. Yeah might final nail coffin already half it, that's sad, that's thing life; ends.

You mentioned media coverage mother texting dangerous covid news reported man late 30s (my age) died it. explain yeah someone 30's dying rare makes national headline news.

Funny mention ""excess deaths"" actually numbers looking yesterday. Office National Statistics UK. post keep formatting.

1	2001	1229.9	100.00%

9	2020	1038.1	84.41%

20	2019	908.9	73.90%

So done take ""deaths per 100,000"" grouped year, ranked deadliest least deadly year (I normalised deadliest year 100 see relative ""deadliness""). scale year 2020 ranks 9th!

Annual mortality rates trending pretty consistently last 20 years, tick little 2020 (to expected) gets 9th rankings. Ah hear say, lockdowns saved us. Well ran numbers. pessimistic estimates 500,000 dead UK. let's split 2 years (unlikely pandemic would naturally burn 1 year) assume 100% deaths completely avoidable i.e. people due die anyway, rather extra purely covid deaths.

That would put 2020 2021 roughly 3rd 4th ranking here. So, done nothing let virus rip throw society, would see death scale witnessed since...2004???

So Spanish Flu, Black Death, T-virus. lockdowns 2004-2005, need now.

EDIT: OK hit submit screws formatting, clarity I've removed except 2001, deadliest year, 2019, least deadly, 2020 one we're interested would 9th place I'd left entries in. Religion fake popes pretty chill ""As everyone says, economy took big hit, didn't""

The economy took big hit; especially small business owners, restaurants, gyms, etc. comprises local economy actually makes bulk US economy case middle class; actually hurting right pandemic.

This pandemic reveal cracks society, make seem American America, affected; never mind countries world suffered MUCH worse, especially Europe Asia.

Lets face it: EVERYONE wants normalcy lives time, day day, getting harder harder people. People becoming ignorant apathetic, choose denial. unfortunate side effect humanity; especially period extreme crisis. correlation theory 

Treatment protocols never mentioned ... cryogenic therapy would seem suitable treatment temperature sensitivity even winter clearly work.  U.S.? ""Average years life lost 10.8 12.4 COVID-19 ischemic heart diseases, respectively. end August, COVID-19 may overtake ischemic heart diseases leading cause deaths years life lost honestly rather 2022 full event everything back normal

That's people said 2021  looking forward getting inoculated, dude. great role model.  UK took risk

What risk? postpone early 2022 full pre-pandemic normalcy returns clashes winter Olympics, still host event, standard safety precautions (smaller, spaced crowd, testing, sanitation, masks social distancing). possible bf caught last Sunday, subsequently caught him. test may early caught it, may caught yet. live together, quarantine (don't go anywhere public) either 10 days get positive test feeling better 24 days (10 contagious + 14 you) testing positive (if catch quarantine longer unfortunately).

I would suggest schedule another test quarantine fully. yet Liverpool, one highest rates infection country mass testing, last city still tier 2 others 3/4. Must’ve helped least somewhat think using jump conclusions mat Yeah can't get scared in-context statistics. need constantly goaded believing world literally ending dead months time. know, media/social media constantly stoking flames paranoia fear mongering never directly lead horrible events before.

""Per capita"" pfft, get viral load guy. Around 7 days according missed something Unfortunately transportation friends, covid, want risk exposing trip hospital (with masks, cracked windows, far seats) did. way explained hospital breathing symptom covid, rapid test would likely show result much affecting me. transportation would certainly get PCR test, really option :/ Yeah really bad right now, social life crumbled family severely immunocompromised can't risk getting sake. US life expectancy shrinking since  Ehhh July me. mind, strong preference AstraZeneca vaccine yet approved here. Yep, Sweden tried control it, here's number deaths 2020. Inherently, things. campgrounds limit capactity arent. risk comes full campground, limited facilities, 8 people per campsite 1000 people plus day use visitation amd people think outside shouldnt carry mask. walk workers, campers, cough bathrooms (where ventilation limited, etc,) get it, activity, easy justify, etc.

Staff take precautions possible 100%. still get people show 30 people extended family hang EZ get violent theyre reminded wear mask going bathroom especially drunk decide walk thru adjacent campsite ICU nurse came self isolate bothered lack social distance, gathering, lack masks, etc reminded one people may well end ward weeks. 

Criticism people, activity, done safely, within household, self contained units, wilderness, etc. People making choices, observe many behaving safely quite extremely careless. not? Yep, sweden's numbers prove it:

dramatic increase deaths aren’t high risk live hermit? least go outside mask walk. Maybe lockdown restrictions don’t know force right now. change headlines “click find panic today” sad shadow event. watching televised sports, simply without genuine crowd reactions. athletes still playing hard, things seem flat uninteresting. Sure hope delay full spectacle staged. great news. more, merrier. like you. friends now. said last year though. can't blame people state though; there's still plenty people following rules regulations. there's people say they're everything still go visit friend, go church, go small gatherings, etc. 
Sweden, lockdown, masks. number 2015 work, unless there's break though technology hear about. insensitive. half asymptomatic cases missed Liverpool trialed lateral flow kits.

[Covid-19: Lateral flow tests miss half cases, Liverpool pilot data probably we’re headed. You’ll probably see less flu deaths people conscious staying home sick. anything I’d guess we’ll see less flu deaths going forward covid deaths will, ghoulishly speaking, make difference yearly basis. years low, others bad. 10's thousands different covid variants detected throughout world. anything makes one special? true. Life expectancy 80. refering ""80 year olds still 8 years live"" number also refer average age death covid 80, ... 88 welcome:) Society dead me. I'm point suffering makes day.  Vaccine effectiveness binary. vaccine produces bunch different antibodies target different parts spike protein virus. mutation might cause antibodies longer work, vaccine would still provide protection via antibodies.

It unlikely mutation would arise near future would render vaccines completely ineffective. Probably worst case scenario (which would still pretty surprising) minor drop effectiveness, say, 85% instead 95%. 

To illustrate this, note immunity SARS (a different virus), 17 years ago still provided protection covid. fact flu basically gone year covid still raging real testament easily covid spreads. ""You guys still *movies* back then?"" yeah it’ll mess there’s actually large portion people don’t get vaccine. Hopefully they’re delaying get it. It’s ideal there’s plenty people take meantime.  data state looking (Ohio) organized day injection given, day data reported entered. - incorrect. Really depends are. live close one government run drive facilities, it’s brain dead easy free get tested. problem people idea want results **now** end urgent care clinic, get antigen test pay pocket.  Tell Tokyo Organizing committee, then. Games happening year. Period. Perhaps taking note although 43,000 people Pfizer trial, it’s hasn’t even year yet, unknown long term side effects. questions vaccination tomorrow morning can’t contact primary weekend?

I want take Xanax (that prescribed me) anxiety charts today probably tomorrow don’t know it’ll effects vaccine   new variant currently known new variant? Click find out! explained American pharmacies stuff, instead European pharmacies stores medicines. Thanks downvotes though. they're going to! going 2021 bust. people already covid? exposed start - already it, absolutely see refusing vaccine. immune, least immune vaccine would provide. might proven, literally showing immune system invader looks like make small piece right? it, seen whole virus. believe term “broken clock” Even won’t teach tho. Nothing teach them. No, I'm making reasonable inference data already exists.

You're one making guess. guess so. one likes truth. sense, also means continue living like hermit another 6 months. 

*dies inside* basically summarize ""probably lot.""  Well, take Ph.D. see going. We’ve thought we’ve known ridiculous amount lot things, didn’t. learn new cancer causing compound every year. There’s new chemicals every year linked cancer, lawsuits time it. Outside cancer initial mad cow outbreak tons data said didn’t cross species barrier, turns whole time effects took years show up.

It’s straw man needs “specific concern”, concern could unpredictable take years show up. Unlikely, possible. So, body clears mRNA vaccine within couple days. That's immune system gone, immune system pattern antibodies

We’re pretty sure clears days lasting effects after, don’t know sure. There’s also chemicals vaccine mRNA itself. CDC estimated 91MM infections US end Sept. Extrapolating forward today get little 150MM infections total. But... Pfizer one German vaccine... we'll go... proves point. ""long term"" side effects happened years taking them. relatively rare events got discovered late due low immunization rates. Since tens millions people worldwide vaccinated safe say know common rare side effects. south African one resistant anti bodies Perhaps go live one better countries then. many better options get fuck go live better life there. I'm sick people acting like they're settling America people risking death get country every fucking day. want us want you. even appreciate here. Seriously, get fuck out. want talk shit home, deserve here. act like us kind favor gracing us presence. Go on. Make room someone actually wants make better use opportunities will. According Pfizer first dose takes 14 days work symptoms covid typically appear 5-6 days exposure. don’t think it’s leap imply 1 dose imperfect resulted infected. People Quebec told firm date get 2nd dose. point doses administered studied... anything else dangerous guess work. Expect similar stories UK. 70+ individuals contracting it? I'd expect many position go rely home shopping, curious contracting 2MM reported new cases could high 14MM new infections. really need chill out. Vaccine rollouts picking pace we’ll likely least one two available coming months. “sparse” begin doesn’t mean pace steady pace we’ll keep. It’s not.   4 week incubation period

Or slowly increased thickness blood months........... Sooooo, bye folks! Everyone wears mask Japan. Interesting. valid studies works? Sad indeed, may point Pfizer recommends 2nd dose administered within 21 days. So... 18 days receiving first dose, fatality. Sorry, nothing whatsoever 2nd dose. everything with, vaccine 100% effective preventing covid disease. even second dose. Sadly, people going get vaccinated still die.

But already known way cut deaths dramatically. Every resident worker home must go strict quarantine immediately, families workers, anybody contact with. Basic effective. ask, OK. need athletes able safely use gyms months advance they're going sort serious preparation. Yep, see neighbors huge gatherings time stores absolutely packed. two gyms town never closed, reduced hours, even required masks. simply doesn’t matter someone chooses vaccinate.

It matter restrictions going lifted us failing reach herd immunity people hesitant getting vaccines regardless scientific evidence. I'm saying sentiment seems extremely widespread I've experienced firsthand. think retrospect starting nationwide lockdown wrong call.

Some countries covid. :( NEED REFERRAL DEPARTMENT KEYBOARD STUCK True living hermit isn’t recommended everyone. Stop picky semantics. ever time ok. analogy. unfortunately there's nothing like Coronavirus give exact comparison to.

It's simply point wearing one endangering life others well close you. sure makes tiring, incentivize people it. apparently piece cloth around face hard ask. trained medics national guards reserves need activated. leadership even call national guards immediately Capitol invaded. Something tells ""massive logistics operation"" quite useless single point failure federal government. 

Just 2 cent reservist medic. 2009 pH1N1 vaccine, Pandemrix, caused many-fold increase narcolepsy among children.

Both conditions potentially life-long, life threatening. notion vaccines can't cause long term side effects daft. also stormed shot dead entire russian monarchy tossed graves. 5 kids included.

But thread bad news, read room. Still better experience many countries. arguing sucks, trying make point sucks quite bit harder poverty stricken third world countries around globe. age make assumption? recognize Fauci new President fit categories? mention huge number grandparents care grandchildren parents work? volunteer social positions filled retired people.You’re making false assumptions nothing elderly living poverty social security.  You’re also limiting economic benefit terms income ludicrous. test much Sundays Right equate third world country? Ridiculous.

It’s shame appear lack knowledge manners. want open schools February... way soon. thought Japan good shape. go rails? Need advice: Girlfriend tested positive. 2 room mates, contractors can't work due paid time covid. told one roomate far downright refused miss work get sick leave covid. do. Kind freaking vaccines also eliminated hospitalizations, lead assumption infection, happens, less severe? mostly bullshit

truth - pretty much one cares

I know everything closed etc, closed ONE CARES. Go outside. Count number people without even motherfuckin mask. mask chin. least nose. many people wash hands coming back home. avoid touching eyes/noes/mouth. keep social distancing.

Covid opened eyes shitty people really are. insanely stupid, that. make matters BIT better - see clear tendency. care prevention least least usually people lose economically risk severe infection. cause LOT collateral damage, unfortunately. I'm almost always contrarian threads.

Get Athletes, Rich, Famous people vaccinated. Seriously.... like soon possible.

There large percentage population still hesitant vaccine, but.... rich, powerful individuals getting them, likely increase number people get shot. Japan's daily tests: 50,000 

Japan's daily cases: \~7800 slow. slow. Youre risking reformulate vaccines start additional mutations.

He right. Shaming always worked. completely terrifying, admissions thousands day too. well that, we're going start seeing effects New Years Eve etc next According latest NHS England figures, 3,697 people admitted hospital 5 January, passing previous record 3,587 set day before. first wave pandemic, admissions peaked 3,099 1 April. ideal world, course. athletes can’t keep losing prime years... get many go arounds recently got vax nightmare red tape never happned. I’m RRT RNs know ICU refusing get it. know people say kicked system thats never going happen. 

For example got call travel company week offing $10000 week 6 weeks. I’m taking even though I’m burned shit. Point healthcare staff power right get away anything still get truck loads money know . one putting back line. Let guess. also believe Donald Trump trying save world pedophile rings. getting warm?  God speed. ☹️🙏 love every article tell nobody 100% protected! 95% symptoms almost certainly higher severe disease, good enough. Anything short sterilizing immunity cause hysteria.

So true! 95% way better experts hoping for. it’s certainly enough go back regular life ppl 60 vaccinated. headline misleading. study tested one vaccine one mutation. There’s many reasons that, including age patient, durability antibodies generated, etc. reinfection possible measles chickenpox, would make sense Covid similar reasons. 

Also really put kicker claim, pre B117 reinfections also detectable antibodies. isn’t determining factor. right sense, tangible intangible aspect numbers base salary drawing retirements Yes, absolutely. Cannot believe administering, things, f'kd overwrought. dumbest part everywhere, people 70+ first group. would guarantee steady demand reveal administering issues could fixed easily phases enduring risk vaccinated. 

But nooooo... marketable skills, building business, working out, etc. 

Being better slave say?

Marketable skills must neocon way saying ""prostitute soul"". How's lockdown working? Sorry health fitness unappealing you. Maybe population whole healthier, without large swaths population obese (with additional health problems entails) hit nearly hard.

Nah. Better lock everything.  Making everyone fat blob great equalizer. Yeah agree probably best avoid using word proven actually been. fiancé getting married next month originally planned going Italy honeymoon. COVID hit, obviously going happen, we’re banking first anniversary trip! third wave Korea peaked 1200 cases they're 500 new cases per day. caught it.

Japan go 8000 next week. Sticky already. Almost every vaccine post deluged comments de-prioritizing vaccination allowing people race get it. \[Caps Lock\] live Mexico many years. Watching first world privileged pratts pontificate “everyone stay home 😀😀😀😀“ demonstrates probably worst case tunnel vision lack experience perspective ever seen.

But rest world essentially firm timeline going wait, watching countries return normal continue suffer going pretty difficult take. 

Personally I’m going back New Zealand Canada March, I’ve seen enough this. I’m hearing, every hospital state right now.

The Biden proposal solve this.

Pfizer already holding back supply 2nd doses - problem hospitals also holding back supply 2nd doses. Releasing ""2nd"" doses Pfizer allow hospitals use amounts sitting on. county sheriff could close things I'm aware approved anyone time.

Make sure make end, recommendations similar line thinking, (which necessarily agree with), respect argument looking good society ""as whole"" (rather *just* rights individual) makes perfect sense.

Basically Haidt presents two philosophies really well explains arguments each, explains line thinking way must take. ***It easy listen understand considering depth subject matter.***

I'm still fence...but strongly agree explanations 90% 95% humans work, think reason morally. fellow countrymen. disrespect one us, disrespect us.

I suggest know little speak. Perhaps keep uninformed opinions yourself. Thank much! going way pointing right direction gathering multiple links summarizing topic top super helpful, thank posting it. Worth thread would say (unless missed one?). So, body clears mRNA vaccine within couple days. That's immune system doing. 

It's gone, immune system pattern antibodies. expecting happen 2-10 years line?

I agree time would good -- least express reason concern vague handwaving knowing, please. know ridiculous amount RNA works body, studied exact delivery methods use cancer many years, including human tests -- specifically concern? solution,
Give EU member states less vaccines. Cuomo require strict quarantine travelers?  Well no, guess. Scientists actually studied late stage trials. debate number test subjects accuracy numbers result, *wild guess*. mutating slowly million times day. can't get life back normal July (presumably many vaccinated), when? supposed move lives even risk? haha Lol. everyone done similar around world covid thing now. still can't fathom people like think way. Stop spreading virus. No.

The last four years turned sarcasm meters paperweights. make definitive statement? supports stance? Uh, no, it’s opposite; cases per million California actually better states, including Texas. 

Per capita, last weeks, well. Honestly hope masks stay us pandemic over.

They simple tool preventing spread diseases even get rid corona end saving many lives. recommend source that?  Cuban medicine among best world. pay attention. I'm chiropractor one biggest reasons getting vaccinated soon possible, lot Medicare patients would feel awful reason caught covid died. Yeah, COVID around 1/3rd deadly Americans 1918/1919 pandemic far (scaled population duration). COVID still getting worse, *probably* match 1918 Flu. *Probably*.

Also worse: U.S. Civil War Smallpox pandemic Revolutionary War. Still, Atlanta gets 100 million passengers year, LAX gets 88 million year, Dubai Tokyo get 86 million year, comparison airline hubs New Zealand minor one that. LOL. offer sweeping conclusions, people saying government need get way CVS/Walgreens oversimplifying. national pharmacy chains get gear, think vaccination speed accelerate.

Also, seems like smaller less populated states better general.  got Japan mutation Covid, thanks... Wildly optimistically guessed. one knows immunity rate one shot be. bioterrorists essentially going unpunished.

Legalize type crime become commonplace.

We need special pandemic prison drop people like infect prisoners keep pandemic brought regular justice system. Lol not. think summer may okay could see another dip fall 2021.

Sorry rant, even like grocery store 20 minutes motherfuckers act like this. telling free market corporations less efficient big gubimmunt? COVID auto immune disease though like many odd viruses may trigger auto immune disease. Buried corpses? people take seriously. People massively overblowing like bubonic plague near that.

A 1.5% death rate sucks. Sure.
 
Alot die. Sure.

But planet not, not, buried corpses. really. stated dispersing first two shots without planning administer second. clear result be. EF Ultimate Break trip planned Eastern Europe (Hungary, Serbia, Romania) September, pretty positive it’s gonna happen. I’m pretty sure countries already accepting tourists. would say depends countries you’re going to, though. really believe this, cite supports that? year ago would said thing... declination rate among first line health care providers children's hospital work apparently 30%. single death directly associated either Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna vaccines?

A relative mine legal guardian mentally handicapped man respiratory conditions getting vaccine believes caused ""many deaths"", main source ""news"" Facebook right-wing talk shows. I'm seriously concerned know possibly show dissuade conspiracy theorist shit. Really, none did? China proper lockdown? could done? happens, I'm gonna lmao Killing children bad news debate? Spanish Flu lasted two years killed 50 million world wide. Primarily 4 waves. 2 million far COVID-19. I've often wondered Asian countries actually easier time containing virus variant Italy hit Western countries first wave prevalent there. Even Indonesia, seems worst results Asia, per capita deaths order successful countries Europe like Norway. 

Everyone tends say numbers Asian societies know handle things effective policies, find hard believe results would consistently good examples Asian countries appear much better policy Europe. really. gave first dose far. That's half protocol. That's true everywhere, uk planning complete protocol second shot. one really knows results one dose be. overall density appears 1.25 2.00 density wuhan Today...so tomorrow? downvoted? Seems factual. healthier population won’t nearly affected one plagued widespread obesity diabetes. currently reason think vaccines work given variant. It’s time start giving glory holes respect deserve i'd even go say rather first open slot, get next slot country spent ""that"" much money yet. take recent IOC reports show progress ""buy out"" one spent least far tokyo get years sooner aggressive measures many cases region

That's correct response. want get virus zero, that's target worth shooting for, everything else waste time virus back previous numbers within month. especially true early days testing infrastructure lacking actual virus numbers much higher able detect. 

The issue lockdowns followed measures control virus. virus low numbers still circulation deemed acceptable. Low numbers course grow big ones quickly exponential growth thus everybody got second wave. though, that's something happened. probably fine that. thought 2021 supposed improvement 2020?

Now Japan new variant unrelated South Africa UK variant. nurse lot nurses i've met(the bad ones) people something happen threw life little track realized oh get 2 year ADN program make decent money. conspiracy folks. Also nurses know anti-vax/conspirary theorists lean right. sub way obsessed Tuskegee experiment. Whites, Jews Asians victims immoral scientific research well. matter past littered horrible injustice, simply reason trust vaccine. 

Hell, Pfizer vaccine made Germany Turks. Germany Turkey responsible two worse genocides History. means absolutely nothing. people actually developed vaccine nothing that. like people developed Moderna vaccine US nothing genocide Native Americans Tuskegee experiment. doctor, pretty sure losing job, emotional outlets, separated loved ones isn’t good health. work physical therapist assistant busy clinic would say 4 10 therapists/staff getting vaccine. got mine! prevailing reason (in ones don’t want get it) myth affects fertility. college educated folks....I can’t believe would believe stuff spewed Facebook. SMH Yet. many science words understand, think shed light least one study told first time vaccine made, studies past looked happens antibodies time doses, would shocked? would thought first responders would included first tier. Also think maybe overthinking approach you. self described pale white blonde guy. I'm assuming running around on, like, unicycle man bun looking straight Hipster Weekly. approach because....well, pretty likely agree they're saying. 61% white men voted Trump. White men least likely support BLM. lot support AA community Trump 87% support BLM they're probably comfortable talking Black people.

It's probably reason I'll random White women ask BLM marches I'm eating ramen wandering MOA. would really help media, politicians, public health officials stopped talking current pace remain throughout 2021. There’s 99% chance 2 3 vaccines approved March. officials won’t say 1% chance fail.

It’s dogmatic approach we’re dealing mass mental illness anxiety. People need reassurances. told Tylenol ok shot later day Friday. question really time ask theraflu ok take felt bad afterwards nurse honestly didn’t know. Check health department website. far!!

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Wait, saying anti-vax *is * virus?

#mind blown Wow things right. hate looking US numbers seeing mostly 30-40 yr olds vaccinated almost 65+. Hopefully that’s early artifact vaccinating healthcare workers maybe Israel looked like early too... fully predict Israel deaths hospitalizations drop coming weeks tho. They’ve vaccinated quick seeing right deaths already “locked in”. numbers going plummet soon tho it’s not. There’s victory without sacrifice. People lose jobs depressed can’t go bars thankful aren’t dead. inequity within states also terrible, too. live we’ve given almost we’ve received, regions haven’t even given half. Bubonic plague endemic Mongolia! 

(This genuinely true - reservoir appears Marmots) trials still determined whether safe receive second dose month first dose? I’d love hear you’d plan proving damages court. going prove contracted virus bar? I’ve saying downvoted
People (especially young people) stoop caring simply outright refuse flouting bans. running options smh People downvote whole planet buried corpses.

Yes sucks people go unemployed especially countries without working social systems.

But alternative opening restaurants, spreading disease everyone everything collapse. quite pandemic everyone took ebola pretty seriously due insanely high cfr scary symptoms. Like others said less deadly diseases like swine flu covid damage precisely due people's ambivalence J J vaccine currently stage 3 trial one dose. Hopefully we'll hear something end January. would enforced shielding outright priority everyone else. needs box enter NI number linked government NI database. isn’t beyond whit man. Hell, harsh fines anyone entitled jumping queue. government support, MACA? 

I’m supporting 6 geriatric families local village. 500,000 Covid volunteers didn’t we?

Let’s face facts. It’s issue stubbornness makes politicians reticent tackle issue. You’re right, updated commend better reflect Many make big deal ""long haulers,"" months they're cleared. Full recovery pneumonia alone take six months some. order work everyone needs get shot including assholes. Especially seeing 80% country given actually following rules. None actually proper lockdown follow proper guidelines adherence them. Get facts straight. I'm debate, I'm educate area expertise. However, need trust - published every single major medical journal past year, decades decades prior well. well known field epidemiology fact remotely debatable. Even lower species mammal, even microbes/single celled organisms colonies... understand isolating sick important reducing spread. get it, even 2020? Crazy Good job, ND! like airborne vascular disease I've understood Agreed. It’s bit uncomfortable think about, true natural infection contribute overall herd immunity. vaccination long vaccine supplies limited distribution hasn’t fully ramped yet.

Like said, absolutely viable long term strategy, won’t surprise North Dakota places like get previous infections. significant human cost, nonetheless...there’s easy outcomes thing. TL;DR: far know different strains originating England South Africa. know contagious causes severe symptoms. case, virus keeps providing unpleasant surprises. Hope vaccines efficient strain too. don’t fault administration decision? trying put eggs basket. diversifying supply nobody really knew vaccine going effective. they’d bought bunch doses flipped, people would mad too. quite. twin cities Minneapolis St. Paul next other. Nobody refers one ""twin city."" Task failed successfully know this, bioinformatics scientist advised CDC literally pandemics/bioterorrism (in 2008, still build distribution infrastructure suggested, hence issues National Stockpile currently vaccines). mask compliance 95% would significantly slow spread, point require lockdowns. Currently, best measure take full lockdown 1-2 months proper PPE adherence afterward during. prevent new strains making vaccination less effective even useless, rising possibility day. point, I’ve vaccine, I’m done living fear. still mask protect others, need additional booster later, it. Goodness I’m optimistic seeing people brag wearing face masks killing brain cells there’s one thing Americans hate it’s literally anything inconvenient. questions regarding three vaccines soon used vaccinate. Perhaps someone qualified help here.

Why Oxford Vaccine much less efficient two (Pfizer/Moderna)?

Why would want Oxford vaccine personally bit efficent coin toss, basically giving personal safety?

Is Oxford vaccine mostly useless epidemiological pov (here told need 60% population vaccinated achieve form herd immunity, also also number people want vaccianate. achieve herd immunity vaccines 0.6\*0.95 = 0.57 would need 0.57/0.7 = 0.81 whopping 81% people vaccinated completely illusory amount crazies around)

Thanks lot advance. hope donate. feds literally passed bill last month providing 69 Billion vaccine rollout testing increases. That's LOT money. UK variant significantly changes behavior virus. That's refering ""Variant Concern"" variant. lot healthcare workers want wait see others affected vaccine. see initial resistance get vaccine becoming long term issue. 100%. There’s difference realistic blatantly pessimistic. Realistic yes, still take time, we’re almost there. Overtly pessimistic never get better matter disproven talking point B C. issue much vaccines. issue ENOUGH vaccines. fact Trump didn’t help matters. likely made things worse IMO. Oh know. covid becomes less issue certain someone longer high political office, media outlets make money? see letting covid stuff awhile, even metrics improve. depressing. maybe new thing grab headlines - want know would be. right, downvoted people understand difference making economic argument moral one. sound hear goal posts moved people never truly cared anyone Damn... ok. Thought there’s silver lining staggering numbers. collect social security net drain society (economically).

They spent entire lives paying contributing society, gtfo kind BS.  Olympics held may super spreader event. Japan keep borders closed Olympics invite only. problems germany. Large percentage nurses want vaccine. large majority doctors want tho.  happens literally every day go store NJ too. highly intelligent states full Dems, dummies too. I'm exaggerating say every single day going back February seen someone store wearing mask properly, staff wearing mask. insane. every day, joke. miss? It’s faith using common sense. know it’s easy fall black white thinking it’s really worth obsessing way many moving parts know next 6 months look like. vaccine still good? Lol. Thanks. I’m seafood lover neither deny confirm still case. :)

I travelled US back 2013 loved it. It’s sad see happening moment. hope everything turns around soon. Italy number 1 destination would love visit. :)   inching toward new strains make herd immunity essentially useless, less effective point posting anecdote even relevant claim. Even person line receive second dose 21 days, would made difference outcome.

It clearly misinforming article posted sake misleading others suits agenda. no, I'd guess achieve due new strains arising many people allowing get infected currently without locking country. basically, likely screwed going deal new set vaccines/strains every year. seem seasonal, like flu, makes situation terrifying. long term damage causes even young people get bad infections, going constant plague species moving forward. thanks anti-maskers! would've built fucks sake. Right. Like consider products use daily Chinese manufactured assembled there. Even lot US stuff says assembled US fine print still says made China. anti-vaxxer, every vaccine known man, flu shot, always sign right there, October 1, jab me,” said Susan, didn’t want give last name fear retaliation. “But one, guinea pig?”

Maybe working people 1 10 chance dying virus catch it? Crohn's awful disease. I'm glad keeping safe. 

And really enjoy level petty went too!! honestly... I'm covid nurse I'm pissed. polarized fucking pandemic, wrong side history. terrible. happens without serious leadership. Hurry fuck vaccines! so? either causes unintended unknown side effects not.

If manufacturer know, know...doesn't matter EUA liable not. making argument Moderna, Pfizer others know dangerous care? so, disclosing knowledge would void immunity EUA may give. got yesterday? Yeah many questions feel like whoever administering shot won’t answers. wanna know take Tylenol feel fever aches lol Open question Mexico residents - hope ok keeping safe. comes death rate high there? lack testing, different way catagorise cases deaths Mexico? Delivered who? Nobody ability make many vaccines timeframe. new strains make vaccine ineffective... expect COVID around forever like influenza LA right now, reports 8 hour wait ambulance getting emergency. Reports ambulances directed transport severe cases. accurate, hospital system already collapsing, one richest, technically advanced places earth. get here.  understand anyone actually expects us vaccinate thing away rate letting people get infected incubate new strains. saying since March though, called pessimistic even scientists. hate say it, wrong yet anything drugs tried thing progressed. shocked dumb public became regarding something obvious mask usage, point screwed. lot questions well safe take recently getting shot. Like wanted drink stressful week afraid one. muscle relaxer. day 2 think it’s safe don’t really know. know herd immunity (via vaccinations) needs reached significantly reduce restrictions. possible summer looks fairly normal many countries even vaccinated 20-30% population. vaccinating health care sector people risk, possible deaths/hospitalizations drop low levels.

I'd also say lot overbought vaccine coming back onto market starting late spring/early summer. Many developed countries overbought sure vaccines going work. looks like several vaccines work optimistic trials overbought vaccines either sold countries bought negotiate pay smaller price cancel orders. Either way vaccine doses officially counties count yet likely there. problem. Hopefully there's geneticist/doctor sees sees reports reinfections thinks 'Huh maybe need asymptomatic surveillance variants - maybe cases going unaware - cases existing covid T-cell responses/antibodies proven insufficient prevent second infection newer mutants' hoping stays rare, longer pandemic goes, likely cumulative mutations build top like B.1,1.7, potentially escaping early covid antibodies. ?   said yourself, long term side effects exist. 

?? No, didn't. Rare side effects unknown ones get discovered certain amount people vaccinated.

Yes, far global mass vaccination campaign, necessarily see until:

a) enough reports warrant concern.

b) Someone brave enough risk career comes forward blow whistle.  Bullshit, sister's father law works NJ hospital. absolutely bureaucratic emphasis procedure overly complex plans instead getting people vaccinated efficient way. vaccinated says process absolute mess consistently sitting doses co workers feel opened 70+ healthcare workers asap get steady flow injections. Otherwise, wtf even for? ridiculous assume everyone back seat driver. 

""It get figured whether complain not"" - real pos remark. Many people ""complaining' lost loved ones this, included. Sorry we're complaining much sensibilities.

Time essence nobody claimed anyone TRYING delay screw process. easily happen without trying so, armchair expert whats possible motives are, might understand that. need get grandparents vaccinated, they’re 75+ New Yorkers, find somewhere get ASAP. probably coincidence, hurt investigate sure. ""A total 2,854,838 resident deaths registered United States Yeah, (assuming live US) we've got three vaccines way still. J&amp;J probably coming February (which one shot), AZ April (which ordered fuckload of), Novavax come later probably still help lot. don’t think it’s wrong concerned skeptical hasn’t ever done before, especially severe allergic reactions things pregnant really general flat say won’t get period anti vax. toothpaste FDA approved sue manufacturer win prove damages. vaccine EUA Moderna/Pfizer liable damages. Big difference. literally thousands variants. I've warning elsewhere, downvoted hell 50% time, likely already beyond point vaccination. I'm bioinformatics scientist hardly slept year studying virus. I'll even scientists try argue me, right every time year. Heed warning, likely fucked. Get vaccine, expect thing around forever form. Unless get lucky cross immunity every strain, situation really right now. media science definitive topic next year, lot us know actual likelihood favor. fully expect scientists come say ""we know"" totally disagree, reality thousands strains detected already millions currently incubating virus without actual attempts control many large genetically diverse countries. already multiple jumps species likely back humans. Sorry guys, new normal going dealing COVID year round literally going back normal caring, getting vaccine every year good person. nutjobs got wanted. actually needed real, proper lockdown February. nothing incivil post, bot work hospital. Healthcare workers, nurses doctors alike, stupidest people meet. lacking common sense. like smart sucked areas life absorbed medical knowledge.

When first started, surprising, there's common myth healthcare workers intellectuals possess common sense generally looked others. Oh yeah, they're not. stupid fucks like rest us ability write prescriptions.

Even member department, got round 1 vaccine last week. shoulder hurt. like getting flu shot. getting warm sitting piss.  Well want grandmas would  I'd strongly consider isolating bedroom wearing mask shared spaces get negative test. believe AZ put statement saying extremely like effective well, studies ongoing Awesome glad hear that. 
Since beginning Covid enemy yet it’s twisted led mixed bag personal responses. Humans vs Covid. matter even 99% people Japan want Olympics cancelled. matters 1% wants. 1% Japanese prefer profits people? report to? know ton businesses area none employees wear masks. answer question might ""crazy"" encourage vaccine, many Catholics feel conflicted vaccine, tested cells electively aborted fetuses. believe morally wrong benefit abortion. Pope's statement assure believers sinning taking vaccine (which many hard time accepting.)

I see original comment responded to, removed mods, thought context might useful. don’t like Biden, despise trump, wish NY could recall Cuomo...

Plenty doctors (admittedly, public figures)are passing vaccine...


I’m ecstatic something new technology EUA though...

And refuse believe OPs stance doubts vaccine makes anti-vax...

I’m assuming point want travel go sporting event see concert take it...

But, age, quite possible vaccine less pleasant experience actual disease...and taking vaccine doesn’t enable end restrictions mostly nothing keep safe, cases little keep safe...so I’m rush take it... Ok thought California alone. Still concerning. guys faith don’t have. I’m happy hope rub me. Moderna specialized Pfozer/BioNTech. Perhaps even since better thermal stability. I’m really sorry personally find flat disgusting teachers higher priority. explain multiple times sub teachers right even retail grocery they’re expected work person. literally around little germ factories everyday close proximity around least families add anti maskers parents people live kids TON people poor teacher indirectly exposed given day. #rantover Yeah except see people living life normally already reasons said. People acting like since there’s vaccine it’s longer 2020 it’s ok go party, visit elderly relatives. last thing need finally vaccine now. Vaccines work better less virus circulating. yeah, I’m hopeful. want optimistic seeing holiday surges crumbling healthcare system don’t think it’s unreasonable optimistic.  Need advice: cousin received second dose vaccine waited one week period, would safe us hang together indoors? live families haven’t vaccinated yet Scary someone find scary, regardless actual number.

[382,239 bit off

That's small city. big woof. /s population UK 68,000,000

....so need *lot* better wanna get everyone vaccinated soon anyone know elderly 70+ people able get vaccinated California fair, thousands millions posters boards act like hive mind. Yeah, anyone saying later timelines likely either state official basically saying ""assuming nothing changes federal allocation pace new vaccines approved"" providing timeline bad clickbait article two things understand people reacting vaccine:

- *months* heard supporting ""healthcare heroes"" enough. move heaven earth, pumping billions dollars vaccine research, come vaccine job safely. many refuse take it.

- People ~~anti-vax~~ vaccine skeptical towards vaccine rare unknown potential side effects, taking vaccine risking rare side effect death COVID. Great! tired later night, best sleep life. Second dose supposedly hits harder, I’m excited with. guess could've concern Pfizer vaccine going effective back then, better put eggs many different baskets. said yourself, long term side effects exist. Rare side effects unknown ones get discovered certain amount people vaccinated. second dose today London. appointment 12.20. 12.40. 20 minutes achievable. Name checks out. Oh that's good! Yeah agree lockdown really done number me, little hope left clinging targets. end day fail meet lies nobody else. vulnerable vaccinated hospital admissions fall can't see reason would end situation again. still claim doubt continue pandemic “over”

The usage quotes suggest think never over. people supposed starve able provide lockdowns?

Both left right unscientific arguments. left unscientifically much pro lockdowns... right unscientifically much mask wearing.

What actual data suggest simple - wear masks indoors crowds, otherwise live life usual. lockdowns needed. But, no, people's lives need needlessly destroyed... course... second deadly year? '40es would expect due wars, say 20xx? It’s short term view though. goal quality life, think long term impact damage COVID left go rampant have. people long term side effects aren’t going ever normal life, strain health care system 10, 20, 30 years time people needing treatment heart lung damage. Yes, Northeast following social distancing guidelines rather well, especially large cities. 

But move southerly westward (or even outside cities Northeast, even), people either outright ignore guidelines, minimally follow them. strongly enforced either. know sometimes ok ask others information. Something maybe personally think of. know, like poster said doctor's check ingredients vaccine beforehand. know, something personally think myself, ""those random people"" actually help.

Thanks awesome input though. 1918 healthcare rudimentary best. today's medical care numbers would probably similar. It’s based state guidance. Hopefully supply increases actually use supply quickly move 1c 2 sure downvoted.

Exposing yourself, risk, going crowded place get tested defeats purpose tests conflict self preservation. first death Vatican? US half country screams constitutional rights without understanding means. Currently screaming freedom speech Twitter violating rights dear leader blocking him, yet clearly don’t understand freedom speech. Bottom line lack leadership every level, starting top. It’s crap shoot. 
NZ continue rock covid response. Why? great leadership. Way go NZ!! Religious people think God magical sky creature. God nature itself, biblical stories lessons nature works. People killing en masse couldn’t go bar buy nine dollar microbrews? Presumably. Don’t shocked vaccines stop working. Magneto Cobalt man 🎶  entire health district done 2 weeks. almost delay due people delaying scheduling see people did. 

Most people scheduled work already make extra trip in. Sure it’s possible areas behind claiming. it’s still wait supply. haven’t even received supply next stage yet. won’t matter hcw done don’t receive supply next stage don’t get authorized give can’t give out. 

The state isn’t waiting hcw get jabbed waiting shipments. Hospitals literally don’t vaccine shelf give don’t authorization give doses may leftover. isn’t HCW don’t want work. people giving shots work shifts hospital. don’t weekends like do. wife industry whole career. never concept “weekend”. There’s three shifts need covered every day. Weekends covered like weekdays. people going weekends physicians lab workers things aren’t urgent. i’m op worked restaurant mass( luckily i’m financially stable enough take break) amount people come maskless, get super close staff, cough hack tables crazy Maybe toilet paper bad example, PPE? Manufacturers stopped selling public hospitals still enough months. 10 months still can't find n95. 

My point meet demand gloves masks, see vaccines gonna different. distilleries making hand sanitizer still shortages long time. hope I'm wrong though enough way June. testing ludicrous indeed, almost deaths (and excess mortality minimal).

Same story across East Asia - regardless policy, seem spread. true people hires ""idea people"" ""big thinkers"" rather detail people micromanagers. put people power decision ultimately responsibility rests man top should. There's pros cons either sort person person top obsessed small details, went every tiny corner, specific example could possible.

That is, entirely possible Biden personally heard idea, called bullshit asked immediate release. Someone incredibly disengaged, distracted, care numbers details minutiae, make call. someone steeped intricacies government procurement.

It's legitimate criticism may need different kind leader time crisis, put chartiably. Gotta get clicks Based pissing contest FDA UK Pfizer's approval, doubt former budge anything outside ""gold standard"" process. Remember, pushed hard Trump's admin approve quickly still drug feet, Biden going pushing front (or least aggressively Trump did). Holy fuck...9 hours?! That's like eternity.  updated daily, sometimes multiple times per Well doesn’t want seem like he’s jumping line privileged, relevant “platform”(quoting can’t find better word)  Well south-west (Spain Italy) entire floors sent home hospitals free spaces potential covid patients.

My grandma postpone hip surgery end this, bet picked back late 2021-2022. believe read U.K. teachers fought lost back-to-school battle.

They started classes Monday, unnecessary contacts putting everyone risk, national lockdown enacted 8pm evening.

/facepalm excess deaths seem match quite well reported deaths, unlike *a lot* countries, still seems really high. following (okay, obsessively refreshing it) two weeks. past 2-3 days seems update 2 3 times per day. preceding 7 8 days like every days. really sporadic. times cross-checked numbers site individual states seen lags 12-24 hours sometimes day two. pretty good seems lagging least day two. true!  I’m atheist per say. don’t believe magical sky creature made everything week that’s it. don’t agree organized religion, agree lot lessons teaches people. ?

Perfect! info looking for. Thanks!  Divine excrement comment linking wrong. know clear. edit original comment indicate johnson vaccine 99% effective producing antibodies yet know enough antibodies.

Otherwise comment incorrect spreading false info. ""Sky daddy""


Ah, sucking Dawkins' poorly-read teat, see. Hope cult New Atheism treating well. Thanks! Read article that’s great news agrees things I’ve read. found yesterday vaccines you’re supposed take breastfeeding. Plan talk pediatrician beforehand wanted research talk. cannot compare Sweden US, maybe state. apples oranges comparisons need stop. believe want.

The data clear. matter weekend still aren’t authorized give anyone public yet. 

They would authorized much, much sooner giving jabs 7 days week instead 4.5 days week. would gotten tier 1A now. That’s absurd Isn’t whole point “presumed covid” deaths? find R number state? Average mortality per year Sweden 91k deaths.  Perhaps wasn’t clear. 

They excess deaths. fewer excess deaths causes including Covid-19 Covid-19 deaths.  materials methods paper? put large amount protein antibodies ELISA wells get cross reactivity. Sure believe want. matter weekend still aren’t authorized give anyone public yet. You’ll see different picture it’s open public. 

Our hospital planning tent open every day 12 hours allowed start rollout. hasn’t started yet. mutation found four people -- male female, ranging teens 40s -- arrived Brazil.   

So Brazil variant. science works. vaccine culmination thousands years research built upon 15 years scientific breakthroughs specific field. quick patchwork solution, money went instead buying useless murder machines. True social media idiots proud post thier opinions saved all. hospital care home workers exception here, be. issue also throw every firefighter, police officer, bus drivers, retail worker, funeral director, teachers, anyone else country job requires work general public. important hospital/care home workers prioritized ahead vulnerable, especially prevent nearly transmission simple precautions. Mostly believe magic sky daddy. chief.  Jesus wtf? guess look positive light maybe getting vaccine, convince others get may hard ‘no’ before?

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah, talking specifically curfew. Shutting non-essencial businesses something know works. I'm mostly worried idiots going night, filming getting fights cops play victim social media. much we'd like pretend otherwise, stuff happens reverse effect, encouraging people disobey. sure government trust helps lot. Also, reasonable less draconian restrictions makes compliance likely.

But even measure compliance instead mandates, masking lowest western world, mobility changes also relatively low. 

Here masking data check Google apple’s mobility data. lockdowns installed people state. Thats direct opposite individual freedom trying minimize this, normalized population size. US population 1918 around 100 million, death rate several times higher. long going super crowded campground, camping household probably safe. away others outdoors, two important factors COVID safety. careful axe...  mean, probably significant % population take vaccine whatever reason. remain risk illness contribute spread. illnesses concentrated 12-15% population, get 30-40% population vaccinated think different much better situation overall. I'm still convinced, they've many plans point, failed every time. really hope normallcy resume soon , new statement offering adults vaccination autumn, going mid summer lot us hopped for, track record holds up, date slip. Thousands deaths could prevented, repelled civic rights spent rest lives lockdowns, allowed leave basements. Imagine drop traffic accident victims. measure things matter life death, quality life. lockdown reduces life mere survival quality life next zero.

If order aint giving anything. rights stripped away without chance refuse.

A right delayed right denied. fact something temporary doesnt make OK. fact something inconvenience&lt; doesnt make OK slap across face lasts miliseconds leaves permanent harm. Would OK slapped like that, temporary inconvenience bro sod off?&lt; dont believe so.

Worked? Yeah. spend 6 months homejail chase virtual zero? goal transmissions all. shouldnt pursue costs. goal normal life. low transmission numbers one tools achieve that. no. Lockdown lasting 6 months normal life. 

And UK CZ  love every article tell nobody 100% protected! 95% symptoms almost certainly higher severe disease, good enough. Anything short sterilizing immunity cause hysteria. 
Reality: coverage acceptable level risks losses, indifferent sounds, things get loosened quickly. accept tens thousands deaths bad flu years. That’s less threshold here. anything get control deaths covid flu lower would anticipate we’re aware transmission now. It’s like sanitation going away mitigation measures going disappear. Masks won’t mandated we’ll apt stay home sick instead toughing out. isn't. never be.  Lol confirm. 2nd kid get much better wait become teenagers. data proves case.

If constraint vaccine availability, see vaccines wind Fridays stay super-low thru weekend.

That pattern unmistakable. Friday people phoning working hard, waiting get weekend.

Sorry, data data science care feelings. Luckily that's basically week. 

Right UK 200,000 day. 

Next week 7 mass vaccination centres opening stadiums conference centres.

More GPs coming online

Vaccination centres supermarket carparks open tomorrow

We 300,000 day next week. Actuarial science field studies life expectancy. totally stupid... almost 3 million people die EVERY year US. normal number 300k, probably right. 

Corona virus awful—-I watched people die daily moved bodies empty rooms hospital make room patients denier virus. 

But misleading statements like lies me. 

. health agency reported 2,712,630 deaths U.S. 2015, 2,744,248 2016, 2,813,503 2017, 2,839,205 2018. Thank incite! agree, frustrating they're grouping care workers together. Thats broad spectrum feel like might misleading people. There's also lot higher education can't teach you, demonstrated pharmacy tech acquaintance. doubt front line care workers turning down, like said; far majority dont think concerned moment. Wishful thinking unsupported epidemiologist. Amateurs claiming since last Summer, keep getting waves. Start today wait. NY already screwed grandmother nursing home. get vaccine yet diagnosed 4 days ago. 83 conditions. Hoping best. 35-40% fatalities occur nursing homes, 80% fatalities occur 12-15% population (65+ health conditions). perspective need 70% population vaccinated make big difference, really 10-15% right people.

Illnesses fatalities skewed small segment population. really widely reported understood important vaccination efforts. Oh gods, Japanese mutant strain? Quick, hide away schoolgirls, one going get rough real quick know mean. Yes, fucking pissed indeed. Stores gas stations way would risk, suspect. (If truly shares facilities.) Think people going gas station country store. Oh. agree investigate it. point thks expected people shoukdnt jumping conclusions someone 5 million people always die unexpectedly mean vaccine failed. vaccine different side effects different people, side effects indicate anything effectiveness. No, immune systems different reactions. variable, lower symptoms mean vaccine work Youyang Gu estimates right 20% population COVID since January last year. would say conservative estimates definitely minimum 12-13% anti-cancer? taking immune suppressants? One successful drugs severe Covid dexamethasone, steroid/immune suppressor. also using IL-inhibitors tocilizumab Covid patients prevent cytokine storm, immune system goes overdrive kills body. 

Covid similar AIDS- don’t die directly AIDS Covid, causes symptoms conditions kill you, like ARDS, stroke, clotting/hemorrhage cytokine storm. every expert agrees that. sure qualified opinion, certainly isn’t qualified opinion subject.

And experts say really makes sense me.

I mean 15 percent would bought us total freedom, places 75 percent less US? must much much worse, didn’t. Hello, question response vaccine. please explain works? relative took dose 1 vaccine experience major symptoms apart pain site injection. hand, another relative took dose 1 vaccine time, day, within 24 hours experienced fatigue, body pain, headaches. similar age. mean vaccine failed one them? Thank something Westerners, unfortunately, like hear reason taken offensive approach deal COVID. Cdc says alot nothing. guy work quarantine positive detected ""something"" I'm done dumb ass virus. *mostly* come night. *mostly.* different entire world? don’t enough doses available yet. Sweden tried herd immunity.... apologized said wrong believing would work. 

You get covid again. get soon three months after, immunity generally lasting 6 months, recall correctly.

They estimating vaccine last several years.

I suspect eventually recommend people already covid also vaccinated. purchased abnormal amount Microsoft products recently? sequence much would bet mutations scientists would find interesting know practical effect Oklahoma death numbers obviously manipulated point. Olympics probably happen they're willing limited public participation.

International travel likely still restricted severe impact, much it'd probably Japan's best interest delay 2022. Vaccine distribution *global level* probably may fast enough mitigate extensive spread post-Olympics. Additionally, supposedly Japanese consensus there's little interest actually want happen 2021. would result cluster fuck people stampeding get there. think better methods. Japanese people (mostly) responsible government? much. definitely see logic wanting spend months end locked getting closer closer end life. attitude upset little bit, even someone afraid getting sick dying could drawing resources afraid. However, handled like mess really energy scold anyone egregious violators social distancing. pandemic simply broken everyone's brain extent.  priority groups nurses would ones deny vacvine paradox dumb can't even comprehend atm. thought problems start already.

I hope delay healin process much. Yes I'm sure NYC logistical issues ND have. Pros Cons space. always voted blue, I've always talked people it. whole family votes blue. that's good analogy Exactly. would find almost impossible virus mutating, however slowly, several continents (Asia, Europe, Africa), US, highest number cases double India #2 spot), high amount genetic diversity, populace barely taking precaution, variants. 

We keep rearranging chairs titanic whistle look way. 

It’s getting embarrassing. Life’s short stay bunkered forever  Sure, whatever want. long don’t force us mask distance along them. Start voting blue, convince others too. probably debt comes due politicians left office.

in opinion somewhere middle kansas land cheap billionaire could finance massive stadium complexes, convention centers, hotels, etc etc much cheaper landlocked areas promote hell get big events. olympics obviously one biggest, theoretically able host even stuff big.

it would take lot guts, one would suspect say ""amazon university"" ""berkshire college"" kind things could built would make use much facilities year. true Point being, it’s within expected parameters. Even true (and would doubt it), WANT virus attach lining nose compared lungs. would good thing! 

It’s like you’re likely breathe in, let get way lungs smoothly breathe out. Californian here.

Where? SF Bay Area like all. image might dumbest fucking thing I've ever seen. Say someone says “I don’t want vaccine I’ll continue masking distancing late 2022.” 

Is acceptable?

_This doesn’t apply one family members saying that._ Even significant overlap- ND huge logistics issues don’t exist NYC politically feasible possibly even unconstitutional. take I'm saying mean want world work. there's reality feasible US, sort draconian (and IMO worthwhile) measures not. key piece. live North Cal.  Kids play together outside many families, without masks.  many adults neighbors would hang outside social distancing masks.  also think massively spreading workplaces like stores grocery stores.   

There moments people careful, lot people gave up. Groups teens got together time - masks. People really bad job careful staying away others. Ah, wanting wait month means want wait 25 years. Makes perfect sense.  Ok, thanks clarifying. Means testing whole role stupid start with

Should first come first serve Researches Say Worry Covid Variants Found Japan, South Africa, Restrictions without enforcement restrictions, they're suggestions. don’t every single dose we’ve ordered hand yet. 

Even goal 100 million people US vaccinated March 1st aggressive optimistic. plan straight wishful thinking.  Hello, fellow BA resident! way. teacher phase 2. family phase 2. hoping time next week comes around start receiving vaccine treatments. hopeful scheduled in. hope get immediately take treatment. certainly need it, BA oblivious anti-science. Large concerts sports games? Probably summer.

Crowded places? Spring outdoors, summer indoors.

Unrestricted travel? mean internationally, probably 2022.

No masks sight? Probably near future. always small percentage population chooses wear masks this. However think mandates dropped summer that’s people get rid them.  quick Google translate says variant, mutated so... exactly same. 

This last paragraphs:

""That is, concern conventional immunity virus may diminished virus E484 mutation.
In Brazil, reports reinfection cases mutant strains showing E484K mutation B.1.1.248 strain (2021/01/06) (5), new mutant strain."" Maybe see deaths like 100 daily. Also need cases 35k something like that. Wow North Dakota handling coronavirus well, can't rest America pick ??? hand wringing means testing gets first. one getting know get it. 

Should first come first serve  point long term effects might discovered years later. think important point early data hospitalized patients, unhospitalized healthcare workers tested positive. seems possible severe cases could started similar viral loads mild cases, replication goes unchecked severe cases. would see data viral load first week since symptom onset among hospitalized patients. opinion that's big limitation study others like it. anti-vaxxer, but...'

Doctors spend first four years education reading scientific research based articles writing lab reports using them. trained trust peer reviewed, replicated studies published scientific journals.  must gotten bad batch vaccine then

edit: /s parts California safely go outside go walk hike. sure ""cooped up"" unless mean home outside. Going business dying happens tons small businesses every year. Coal workers can't get jobs anymore also DYING.  


Sometimes life change careers, like people construction workers housing bubble burst, make bunch special exceptions millions workers. got unemployment awhile that. “2019 normal” return? Ie large concerts sports games, crowded places, unrestricted travel, without single face mask sight. happens nationwide plan. guidelines get vaccine first ignored many health systems... live young health insurance employees work home prioritized nursing home residents. I'm sure happening elsewhere. Add would appear systems stockpiling vaccine. Total farce. Absolutely!!! 

I hope aren’t year now, talking continuing vaccinations ☹️ Yes, President behind Operation Warp Speed. Bubonic plague spread fleas carried wide selection mamels. e.g. covid19 survive 24 hours clothing. Fleas eggs survive weeks types cloth. centuries reach parts Mongolia. think observation reflects different viral kinetics severe vs mild infections. Virus always replicates nasopharynx, severe cases get replication lower respiratory tract. coughing virus goes mouth, detected severe cases.  No. That’s true.

It logistics nightmare, great treating patients, treated DoD realized would much efficient embed military medical personnel struggling hospitals. military ever since.

There hasn’t day since hospital ships re-ployed hasn’t military doctors nurses American civilian hospitals. This. Worry getting want first. people shot without incident others trust it, anyway 200,000 got far. current goal 2 million week, 3 mil looking possible. 200,000 day local GP's still mass dedicated vaccination stations coming online week/ next week high street pharmacies begin offering vaccine next week well. cares   Source: title 2 hour YouTube video retweeted guy thinks weed drives insane Immunologists probably best bet understanding things. think every person world watching Olympics going give Japan money back nearly 10 million would expected travel it. investment hosting Olympics payed tv viewers alone Simple question: long coronavirus actually last air?

I know whether aerosol transmission still debate, lot trouble trying answer simple question: long COVID-positive person leaves room air room still infectious? (Assume ventilation). cases someone walking room 15, 30, 60, 90 minutes afterwards getting COVID? 

The number often see upper bound ""3 hours"" far know that's [based *ended* 3 hours, seeing ~1log decrease. that's case would expect see infections happening hours someone left room. 

What current state research this? Generally speaking it’s spectacular feat humanity able keep people compounding health issues alive long. grand scheme things experiencing cull, always people doomed w/o preexisting conditions. Modern medicine keeps unhealthy people going hell lot longer 100 years ago. People good years real pandemic, don’t forget smallpox us throughout civilization. There’s retroviral insertions (like HIV) throughout human genome still are. I’m Broken Arrow...super f’ed. whole family phase 2 dad 65, mom 60, husband teachers.

Especially considering much better job are. Maybe finish help us? Well data news reports rarely mention this. simply say people affected without pointing high concentration small demographic.

This suggest people count important anything. breast cancer reported example reported women, whole population. Vaping reported based teens young adults, whole population. somehow distinction lost Covid reporting.  yet still get vaccine. Got thing political covid deniers got first wave along nurses Why? High enough quality masks would. Brexit taught anything social media means nothing. “friends” proudly voted Brexit back 2016. posters windows, posted every damn day Facebook, etc things didn’t quite turn wanted stuff quickly gone usually deleting account making new one “were hacked” bullshit. magically deny ever supported Brexit. “unsure” didn’t vote lies. 

I guess screenshot posts could try use words end twisting meant things like “well time said masks useless changed mind I. can’t blame *they* got wrong! following advice”. try argue mask debate mistake changed minds back April change argument “oh god can’t remember *exact* day! remember Fauci said masks won’t help said wear them. Like make mind!” get point moved something else. 

It’s infuriating. !Remindme 1 month ""Things got worse Biden took over""

/s heads-up, friends. 84, think anyone begrudge vaccine.  lot yes. Something like 50k soldiers.

Let’s see ages Lead Paragraphs:

 

WASHINGTON, UNITED STATES -- Dozens people treated COVID-19 Florida hospital last summer became additionally infected mysterious, often deadly fungus called Candida auris, U.S. government study said Friday.

The multidrug-resistant yeast first identified Japan 2009 top priority Centers Disease Control Prevention recent years increasing global spread.

C. auris associated 40 per cent in-hospital mortality usually caught inside healthcare settings, especially people feeding breathing tubes, catheters placed large veins. friend scheduled get vaccine last week got virus could happen.  included list health conditions increase risk, depending measure obesity, something like 50-75% population obese, might really useful. Return normal vaccines:

Would say (in correlation authoritarian measures) form coercion 

or perfectly democratic offer vaccine ""only way out""? Paywall ... Need excerpt agree sentiment, it’s born reality. Russia wait days, saying believe point since seem distribution constrained, might well go effective ones.

This would true except typically vaccinate 3M people day flu vaccine (10x current pace). can't use exact channels cold storage requirements mRNA vaccines. approving Astrazeneca would allow us use existing vaccination channels. keep giving mRNA vaccines fast possible, also different channels Astrazeneca.

In addition, peak vaccination target probably something like doses manufactured US per day. beyond manufacturing capacity Pfizer Moderna (which combined targeting like 2M per day US).

I hoping Biden team comes really asks hard countries use tool safely rolled hundreds thousands (or millions point), US banned. 

Astrazeneca proven safe effective far beyond FDAs original requirements, ban use horrible. ty, fixed Even better weirdly enough dream last night pope died. catholic, religious. I’m worried Pope! eerie feeling reading morning. Thank know that. look it. Ah gotcha, incorrect, learning wet-bench experience BS chemistry master's. Well forced work expose 40, 50, 60 hours week shit pay also told see family, friends, anyone else immediate family 10+months, somethings got give.

We need stop blaming working poor direct anger government done fuck keep people home, fed, safe.

But nah let's shame poors instead like gotten us anywhere last year. likely deadly, ironically.

What makes Covid-19 deadly symptoms low enough make people socialize contagious, deadly enough serious problem.

10-20% mortality would make people sick contagious. oops, right - used 4 million calculate literally started taking screenshots posts people knew would come. None friends ever able run right now, lot started insult taking serious crohn's medication.

""IT's lOcKdoWn"" Ah, help meant take position RN emergency department. worked bit covid back first started. mental health never same. promised go back over, all, ever. 

There super hero nurses passion mindset work this, I'm one them.  actually test positive twice symptoms twice? long cases? could case never went away.  I’m pretty sure made earth 6 days rested 7th. That’s remember Sunday school? ever work hospital? don’t close weekends. said think would take couple years mutate differently would render vaccine useless. could well may happen hopefully slow tweak vaccines mutates continue produce vaccines without throwing out. Switzerland demographics cases, hospitalizations deaths age group pretty now? state? He’s still head organization time time covered pedo priests. Man stops short knowing majority cardinals higher ups Catholic Church pedos. Love Biden trying take credit this. Dude literally done thing related virus response vaccine people praising him. time cut loose fix without good can't get vaccine people's arms.  need strong, tough, resilient. give up. There's light end tunnel; gotta fight darkness see light.  Unfortunately, live state still non-believers anti-maskers. going continue drag kill thousands day. Pretty much Man, believe specialized process give away Pfizer's IA

Even license drug makers, unlikely equipment process requirements order fulfill production needs  k  Indeed also quite challenge since virus eliminated general population. big rush. like going Olympics. Oh yall say trumps basically gone lmao. everything I’m really sorry hope gets better hit nail head. dog piss shit don’t walk It’s really complicated. People wear masks go (which don’t provide magic 100% protection).

But there’s lot mask-free gatherings friends family. That’s lot spread is. Bruh July summer. 

Wtf “should USA horde every single shot let Europe any” shit. Completely relevant analysis whether trump fucked purchasing doses US, offered Pfizer.

Don’t try red herring crap avoid subject. couple weeks, holidays, they've vaccinated 4% state. Pfizer rollout. 

They're good job, imho, soon moves slog individual hospitals expertise pharmacy chains, numbers game really help. 

As Moderna J&amp;J get rolling, going really turn around quickly. quickly enough save everyone, save majority. may different different parts world, main source spread private gatherings. Even UK variant loose, still seems case. One month ago, know plenty people skeptical vaccine. seeing horror show unfolded nationwide since then, though, people board getting vaccine ASAP. hope that’s sign skepticism waning people warming idea. thank Christ coming save soon, rise blessed Him. ✝️. Move out. old you? We're lucky least stores take seriously. favourite shop regulates occupancy using shopping carts. put exactly enough shopping carts, must take cart upon entering store.

But yes, mention it, think several stores make effort limit number customers. bank day least 50% raised issue brushed off. Maybe time start calling cops. Oh thank Biden!

Wondered going try get credit vaccine. Emergency Use Authorization.

Approval going happen awhile. oversight part initial post -- say ""authorized""  They've used tech detect grow houses issue warrants years years. also purchased drones well.  Similar 20 30 year-olds annoyed lock majority dying 65 older. know ten definitely preparing meals. argument seems like lot whining hard things must done. America got soft, that's big problem. Where's great? Show me. means accurately number people returning drop like stone. take 72 hours results test there. many people unable return. sure economy, definitely revitalized virus. dont know downvoted. numbers literally rising. People come home virus ever. number definitly rise falls. Oh, one ""true believers,"" huh? Wish never asked. concept evidence fundamentally foreign people jumped deep end. TBF, number people died days following vaccination. Mostly quite elderly people therefore particularly alarming. Drinking getting fat seems working gov. wants Olympics months, yep. money. don’t make sense. claim reason less shots happen weekend nurses taking weekend off. 

Which doesn’t happen. Nurses hospitals don’t get weekends. Hospitals vaccines right now. Due temp requirement pretty much places capable them. 

Either think nurses don’t show work weekend claim bogus. 

Right issue people going vaccines. It’s open HCW it’s worker pick time show up. don’t show don’t get shot. hospital can’t run around forcing people get vaccines. 

The issue nurses showing work. That's good question. seems lot reluctance US, based article, general distrust big pharma reluctance serve Guinea pigs vaccines seemingly rushed market. Though reading recent issue New Yorker, seems base building blocks Pfizer Moderna vaccines exactly brand new. !remindme 2 weeks
I got brother comes sooner mean say there's three. fact three definitively identified least better speculating lends credence point tons know about. create sense urgency people, unfortunately never cared initial virus wont care mutations unless much deadly version comes out. dont understand isnt deadly enough already I'm antimasker/covid denier. In-laws private assisted living vaccine available yet. saw news recommending family make appointments take them. Florida state free-for-all people 65 streaming states/Canada get vaccinated. Oh yeah, disprove saying, better hop ad hominem. God bless :) would you? wouldn’t. I’m immunocompromised catholic, even would give place line. He’s forward-thinking pope (in areas), elderly, needs vaccine like yesterday. also used lot warmer stuff must kept long way zero. styrofoam boxes separate compartments goods direct contact. item kept cold without getting cold. Thank perfectly summing 'Murica mentality know yet. basically US, Russia, Brazil's response, similar end results. 

If nothing else, pandemic taught us messaging matters, matter educated general population may be. Jesus doctor too! See think due Covid, people drugs leading higher number deaths one call 911 someone overdoses. message pandemic don’t use alone. spring shutdown CA worked fairly well. people realized scam protect Governor various politicians ignored it. streets stores etc crowded current ""shutdown"" incredible. OP to. Vaccines safe. say otherwise propaganda believed 12 18 months right away back March. Would fun sports close/direct contact. Wrestling top. mention common sex participants, Olympics gonna hell ride. possible downside Philip 99 dies next year two ( quite likely), anti-vaxers leap proof vaccine toxic. is, already, one most-studied illnesses planet.

You literally said said. That's people think long-term issues something unique. take word it, take Rohin Francis, cardiologist working toward PhD imaging techniques acute myocardial unique US health care workers. amount hesitant workers probably differ countries.

This problem everyone wanting vaccine gotten it. give next line. Go back read wrote. I'd take *this* vaccine monkey. free wait. Let's minimise public health risk delays. Many healthcare workers refusing vaccine also happen black. idiots.   function without nurses providers? Nah don't. don't. Good news take months tweak vaccine cover variants. Bad news actual rollout. cannot vaccinate faster variants spreading. 50-70% transmittable joke. Well today 2.3 million week. strongly believe reach coming weeks. would call evidence based medicine snobbery... scientific desire truth.  Probably looking per capita makes sense. famous 80s French sketch, ""president Mitterand"" says : ""people say I'm racist dog black"", funnier Maybe not, surprised considered Vatican subject since works pope. believe members Swiss guard previously counted Vatican cases maybe falls category.

And IIRC pharmacy, likely also on-site doctor. don’t think anyone thread commenting far actually mexico, even trying understand situation Covid differs first world countries.  ruthless? 

The general rule thumb highest risk people vaccinated first. China, highest risk elderly, people work airports, logistics, etc.. 

I suppose China done good job protecting elderly covid like US UK, would following guidelines. also important LOT people spiritual advisor mass scale. admirers followers want safe.  dress, whee disagree you. past year put lot strain family relationships. Lol. Religious nutjob. Nan got 4 weeks queen shes younger. mum also got one leftover vaccine doctors had. absolutely nothing wrong Apparently, catholics supposed die.   points make people going anyways now, give that. makes feel like mine well say fuck work somewhere else restaurant shit blows over. really fucking upsets unified doctrine still don't, left hand know right doing. hear shit DHS, fuck FEMA this?

It's scam! Federal govt. fucking scam designed extract wealth least amount work. Trillions dollars blown inflated budgets huge state security apparatus, chips dick show it. pathetic, government know protect us, spy imprison us? Mexico Canada decided invade us, could organize defense CENTCOM reliable force structure remaining? guys FEMA DHS even showing work last four years, sit home collect check?

It seems like going difficult maybe impossible, mass vaccination sites, eligibility expansion many states- hopefully states soon- impending approval vaccines, upcoming availability vaccine easily accessible pharmacies, inevitable number people getting first dose day dramatically increase soon remain stagnant. We're likely pass million one day next week. goes there, quickly, keeps going up, might still possible. really. easily objectives.

It indeed quite strange handled like that.

How done:

1. would constantly maintain stock doses guaranteed second dose ready go people need it.
2. time would keep bringing even vaccine stock start vaccination process first dose people need it.

Pretty simple, really.

Of course, achieve that, need things:

1. Proper logistics enough crew perform vaccinations fast rate, across country.
2. Constant rapid manufacturing new doses vaccine. Texas. didn’t go vaccinations do. super often Lol toughest restrictions ass.

Felt little guilty, could give place line give vaccine parents high risk person, I'd consider it... since options either get it, random employee gets it, dose potentially gets trashed, not?

One vaccinated person one vaccinated person. Agreed, true friends respect boundaries set hesitation. 💯 look excess mortality high, similar countries like spain, italy, great-Brittain countries got hit hard. Well honestly didn’t know system going ignorantly assumed skipping like like rich America fault thank understanding stance. also wish see nothing vaccines everyone anyone needs especially danger like nurses drs front line workers including grocery workers etc. won’t want see get rich powerful leave rest us fight left overs.

Yeah mom covid back april-may got first dose little tired sore Sounds like political battle control concern anyone’s welfare. many 60s wards refused change anything lives like going church instance able right now, issue? suggest us even choice. made available old/vulnerable people even though new variant shown cause severe symptoms even healthy young people wait least 2022 enough supply vaccine. Someone knows truth. don’t think ever really know who’s making decisions hold back doses. Local governments blame Governors Governors blame Feds, status quo politicians. Thank posting! explicit lemmings test I've ever seen.

Certainly status prince helped get charges extradition that's privilege rich famous. Pretty much... bad terms total count large state lot ppl. per capita point view, middle pack.

Keep mind California *was* well per capita, time outbreak resolves per capita lot worse. Californian, think lot early success California really climate. Right started getting chilly nights (early October) started see exponential growth.

The problem lockdowns restricting indoor dining, bars, etc. help activities occurring people's houses instead. I'm pretty sure that's what's going CA. really think state restrictions much, kind people would've dining indoors going bars partying friends' house instead. masked either got two masks infected second guy minute takes throw bag rubbish, via surface transmission.

Could either. scenarios uncommon definitely main driver infection. (Otherwise contact tracing wouldn’t work well does.)

But you’ve got good infection control, it’s unusual cases going slip through.  None quarantine leaks NZ Australia taken examples normal spread.  They’re interesting examples incredibly sneaky rare cases. Spahn said Germany would get total 130 million doses vaccine two suppliers end year -- enough vaccinate three-quarters country's population.

That's honestly someone fear virus would doing: going normal life. Instead pointing fingers elected officials appointed health experts get caught living lives, constituents see truth behavior showing us.

They know facts, they're afraid. able isolate close borders huge part, island helps that. Thailand example. They've mostly able contain, outbreak now, migrant workers. disagree country Europe “really well” summer, mean look countries like Indonesia, literally right equator, pretty bad shape. think richer countries planned buy many donate rest poorer countries. possible Trump consider America poor would mid late summer clear vaccine derectives. still allowing travel contact vaccinated people. H I’ll joim damn protests make difference? Plan vaccinate 300 million people July.  see concern restricted hours grocery shopping. New Zealand similar lockdown starting mid-March. number shoppers grocery stores one time limited drastically (we door monitors well) one person per household allowed shop time. response, people shopped off-peak hours flexible work-from-home schedule. went peak times, they’d prepare stand line (distanced course) good while. also put lot resources making online ordering delivery options available (but took bit time make viable option). 

I don’t believe New Zealand ever curfew, would challenging me. lockdown, allowed outdoors locally (meaning within walking distance) could household. time though, alone time you’d get. I’d go long evening walks living space stressful (work, inconsiderate flatmates). Weed would helped instead, lockdown ended lots people moved flats. mention 100% people offered anytime going take vaccine group. surplus vaccine acceptance according age, race, and/or, unfortunately, possibly political views.

You see early hospitals NY. hospitals rapidly dispersed allotment, claim offered could surplus declined. lead ""extra"" doses phase groups get larger larger. really feel position overabundance doses freezers given far behind are.

We swift agile possible get vaccine many people want, QUICKLY possible. need max pressure firehose. Thailand really democracy government structure military power

That said, gov part pandemic response. think still learn Thailand China, need understand won’t go far locking people walking dog

We learn nations without following everything no,

We'd need cops basically stop anyone authorized reason out. course happen, point, we're relying people responsible. Californians made choice.

It's really surprise nights started becoming chilly, cases exponentially rose CA. Clearly Californians socializing, they'll indoors long weather colder mid-60s  think Jared wanted kickback. Unfortunately, they're wearing masks, are, unless N95.  That’s point. I’m obviously denying full, need macro analysis many, worse elsewhere etc.

There article fear mongering saying hospital “only” 82 icu capacity now. Someone pointed specific hospital averages around 90 right New Years normally. True. Hopefully it'll soon. Ask Biden much money gave back door. guys need learn big business pharma is. currently giving population mass vaccinations maybe argument would stand. suggest abhorrent seizure power away people, we're almost end would seen purely authoritarian. freedom comes cost safety, think many would accept that. times are, even mindset, Britain still one safest places live.  based on? remember Spahn (for Germany) von der Leyen (for Europe) saying there'll enough vaccines voluntary vaccination summer/fall. means anyone get then. fear universities hypochondriac professors still mandate it. Really want pick education back up. Lol werent already like 10 different variants March? absolute non stories Yeah get highest numbers games resulting getting highest number yellow, grey, brown discs everyone immediately forgets days Big Game Event?

What *is* grandma's life worth next one brown disc? cases like proof haha Get used it. It’s going get worse Thailand.

Anyway, mentioned countries raging epidemic able hide did. Sure, may prettying numbers stuff like local authorities hiding small outbreaks, good ""trust"" numbers sense probably completely accurate, silly conspiracy stuff ""trust"" sense completely invented relation reality. Mask wearing works similarly vaccine certain situations preventing transmission. lower bar achieving herd immunity reopen sooner getting remainder population vaccinated. Fair enough. everything goes well, goal vaccinate 75% Germany end 2021. stated target.

If reading this, probably around 25 years old. means bottom list probably get one year. that's assuming everything goes really well. think 75% target end 2021 still optimistic. Wow. Yeah, looking totally different situation click-and-collect area mine. Longest ever waited, even March peak, 15 minutes. Usually 5 so, 8 possible grocery spots it, never 4 filled once. There's clearly unused capacity here, spite whining local peers lockdown. Even nearest IKEA managed get click-and-collect scheme underway takes 15 minutes average. anyone ever spent 15 minutes IKEA?

Kwong’s fourth-floor lab crowded McLellan, set workspace within earshot Graham, became friends. “It take long come say, I’d like work something HIV,” Graham recalls.
Past unsuccessful attempts neutralize RSV vaccine focused virus’s class 1 fusion protein, F protein. wild, protein shapeshifter, “like Transformer toy,” Graham says. look one way RSV virus infects enters cell, another way virus multiplies escapes. Jekyll-and-Hyde identities known “prefusion” “postfusion” states, vaccine attempts point focused latter.
To make matters trickier, prefusion form extremely unstable: irreversibly spontaneously snap state instant. Graham McLellan hypothesized might create successful RSV vaccine could lock prefusion state. one knew prefusion protein looked like; knew trickster.
So, McLellan used x-ray crystallography—a technique uses x-ray beams determine structure proteins—to capture image prefusion protein first time. researchers would later say prefusion F protein looked like lollipop. McLellan thought looked like Nerf football. “You’re one first people world see protein looks like,” says. “It’s pretty cool.”

By examining protein atomic level, McLellan found way bioengineer take away shape-shifting power. words, stabilized it.
When Graham tested new molecule animals, acted antigen stimulated immune system fight disease. 50 times neutralizing power RSV anything tested before. flip side, also showed postfusion version protein takes identity bypass immune system’s defenses.

“The work Jason Barney others revolutionized field,” says Ruth Karron, professor international health Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School Public Health director Center Immunization Research Johns Hopkins Vaccine Initiative.
The lucky last step
Five years ago, postdoctoral fellow Graham's laboratory returned trip Saudi Arabia respiratory infection. Everyone assumed fellow Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), caused dangerous coronavirus arisen country two years earlier.
That emergence happened around time McLellan launched lab Dartmouth College New Hampshire. McLellan Graham trying prefusion trick MERS, given coronaviruses feature spike proteins also shapeshifters used break cells. Graham's lab tested postdoc's nasal secretions, found related germ—and opportunity would pave final steps toward COVID-19 vaccine.
The postdoc older coronavirus: HKU1, mild cold-causing bug discovered 2005. Graham-McLellan partnership decided pivot focus HKU1 MERS required extra safety precautions, research latter hit wall.
To capture 3D picture HKU1, McLellan would need different method taking atomic-level pictures. X-ray crystallography saturates proteins salt bath solution form crystals akin rock candy. due physical nature, coronaviruses don’t crystalize well. Cryogenic electron microscopy, cryo-EM, technique allows scientists view proteins frozen thin layer ice, bypassing need crystallization.
Proteins small can't use regular light microscope take picture

In 2015, structural biologist Andrew Ward one leading cryo-EM experts U.S., McLellan emailed lab Scripps Research San Diego ask interest studying coronaviruses. Coincidentally, Ward postdoctoral fellow hankering examine coronaviruses. ultimately took thousands images HKU1 proteins.
McLellan used 3D readout HKU1 make educated guesses stabilize spike proteins viral cousins, MERS SARS. McLellan Nianshuang Wang, postdoctoral fellow, discovered adding two prolines—rigid amino acids—to MERS’s spike protein, could prevent changing shape.
They called tweak 2P mutation filed patent 2017. Around time, Graham’s lab partnered biotech company Moderna design experimental mRNA vaccine MERS. two worked together year prior similar separate project combat Zika virus—as part new movement comprehensive preparations global outbreaks. concept hinged detailed study prototypical member viral family—such HKU1 MERS—to build defenses future troublemakers family like SARS-CoV-2.
Ultimately, experiments animal models showed MERS vaccine successful, says Kizzmekia Corbett, postdoctoral research fellow Graham’s laboratory, created “portfolio data” scientists knew could apply new coronavirus.
The road salvation
On January 6, 2020, minutes took phone call ski shop, McLellan messaged Wang Daniel Wrapp, graduate student, WhatsApp.
“Barney going try get coronavirus sequence Wuhan, China,” McLellan wrote them. “He wants rush structure vaccine. game?”
The two labs worked concert one another, determining virus’s structure two weeks using 2P mutation stabilize proteins. Graham’s lab partnered Moderna, Corbett designed executed clinical assessments immunize mice mRNA vaccine made modified proteins starting February. “When got first results mice, great antibody response, gratifying,” Corbett says. March 4, U.S. Food Drug Administration greenlit Moderna vaccine human trials.
At time, Pfizer BioNTech spoke Graham using 2P mutation vaccine. work patented widely published, drugmakers—including Novavax Johnson &amp; Johnson—also based candidates design. Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine would become first authorized U.S. showed impressive 95-percent efficacy rate. Moderna’s vaccine 94-percent effective.
(Related: Here’s latest COVID-19 vaccines.)
Further tests would needed judge much 2P mutation contributes overall efficacies frontrunner vaccines. Phil Dormitzer, Pfizer’s chief scientific officer vice president viral vaccines, says it’s “absolutely clear” stabilizing prefusion proteins led remarkable advances potential RSV vaccines. “I’m glad picked mutations move forward,” says, referring Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.
Graham doesn’t quite know answer asked feels decades’ worth work contribute rapidly developed vaccines could save hundreds thousands lives amid harrowing global pandemic. “That's way usually think it,” says. “I don’t think really think much feelings get certain milestones.”
But question—posed using phrase “such time this”—makes Graham hearken back biblical tale Esther, queen made royal “such time this.”
“I kind felt like whole career lining ‘such time this,’” Graham says. Must Prince Andrew. Exactly, it’s important keep supply consistent. disruption would cause people get second dose outside recommended window could cause bigger problem hundreds thousands appointments need rescheduled people already scheduled following week.

By time McLellan landed 2008 Vaccine Research Center Bethesda, Maryland early-career researcher, Graham working little known highly contagious disease caused respiratory syncytial virus 20 years. cold-causing RSV SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, causes COVID-19, feature genomes made RNA. Although two sit distant branches evolutionary tree, share common physical trait would yield first key McLellan Graham's journey toward beating COVID-19.
Attempts design RSV vaccine riddled hiccups since 1966 clinical trial inadvertently enhanced illness volunteers—and even caused death two infants. Graham wanted understand drug candidate failed terribly.
Similar frustrations hovered around another germ study Vaccine Research Center: HIV. McLellan arrived center train Peter Kwong, structural biologist tinkering structures viral proteins hopes engineering vaccine would stop AIDS. HIV rapidly mutates, researchers tried several structural biology tricks develop vaccine candidates ultimately failed create one elicited immune response.

The current policy endeavors protect risk supply chain issues preventing second dose available timely manner people got first dose holding back second doses (50% dose supply overall.)

I could understand holding back 10% second doses (5% overall doses) could probably quibble 50% second doses (25% overall) even, holding back described many people overly cautious given costs. 

It expected certain anticipated event 20th month, policy change release supply held back second doses, trust supply chain keep working providing second doses needed. Thanks, leave it.

I specifically wanted specify posting fact, looks properly written, science seemed bit sketchy. Businesses problem. Pandemic fatigue is.

Eh point, businesses part problem. 

Indoor (and outdoor) dining certainly helped seed things open. already seeing new variants coronavirus, potentially make current vaccine obsolete? think original SARS undergone beneficial changes. closed quickly found people weren’t “on list” originally. Thank god don’t live Cuomo’s reign read article already linked? can't believe serious.

What choices? I'm sure much effect have, especially US. Conservative American Catholics aligned 'typical' US conservative anything else. example, Francis said climate change real based scientific data humans around world need something it. obviously conservative American Catholics suddenly become big environmentalists that. Gotchya, thanks clarifying. Hopefully we'll find soon vaccines help that. Hard say since test positivity high. Presumably people died unnecessarily. compelled read loud husband laughing!

💦💦💦💦💦 tried one service. cucumbers mold them.
Last time used them. Can't trust select good produce. going get worse big influx. Maybe area live norm.  old farts living government money done absolutely nothing except leech us, get vaccine me, essential worker risks health help people? Fuck country Royal family still carry much importance England? generational thing younger population also hold high esteem? Genuinely curious. Hahhaa point , reaching hard. don’t want talk don’t enjoy company, stop replying hahaha live nursing homes! asked special you? hospital system streaching definition others giving shots execs ICU &amp; ER staff. problem don’t enough freezers store administer shots. best, able administer ~800/day medium/large health system work (individuals need wait shot social distancing). Plus, need people give shots. whole delivery process needs people, -80 deg C freezers (or copious amounts dry ice), plus takes 1 month reach 95% efficacy (21 days + 7-10 days second shot immunization reach max effectiveness). 

It still take months/years roll vaccine Pfizer.  People dying covid hundreds day California *with* strict lockdowns. Imagine many would dying without measures. 

The debate civil liberties valid one, can't use argument ""well barely par overdose deaths"" imply measures going overboard, measures keeping deaths exponentially higher. conspiracy theories yet Big Bidet behind pandemic? pfizer wait federal gov. tell ship to. first weeks distribution Feds blamed Pfizer states get promised amounts &amp; Pfizer said doses feds told ship Healthcare absolutely free US. free poor, 65+, people w/ certain conditions. think us confused w/ Western countries w/ socialized healthcare systems.

Also tried it, actually enjoyed picking week later. put knew needed on, paid time slot, used ""add later"" feature make essentially running list needed, add think it. found ended short fewer things before--I used go grocery store multiple times week way home. care much? Thanks sharing! Dr. Griffin's updates always informative, compassionate, measured. yeah bow* Heck, offer people $5 Starbucks gift card. new strain or? wait second. brutal side effects like 6 hours. 

I feel anything first think there's ""clean"" way it. 

I think current administration tiers correct like things, got screwed they're administering less full throttle.


&amp;nbsp;

Releasing time might cause problems since 2nd dose might get delayed many. least 1st dose going produces 70% efficacy stop virus around 95% stop severe symptoms. So, takes bit longer get 2nd dose, still works since people getting vaccine Going shopping Walmart (regardless pandemic) make fear life  Send away country side like WWII better sending patients die homes sending infect elderly Absolutely, gonna get (safely) lit night J&amp;J effective lmao I’m sorry hear that. feel way close vaccine. don’t want guy gets killed skirmish war declared over. I’m trying much careful even before, end date, hold then. Wait didn’t make sign waiver? USA #1 guy spoke blowing things bit proportion. Still, percentage long-COVID cases probably correct, absolutely nothing article talks ""children spreaders"".

There two studies cited show many asymptomatic children covid. One studies correlates households people covid. know whether kids spreading adults households vice versa based that.

Can anybody correct I'm wrong here, see anything really changes knowledge whether children spreaders Yes rare. get positive test time? need wait like 2 weeks give second dose 9 (UPI) -- United States reported 300,594 new cases 3,895 new coronavirus deaths Friday, Navajo Nation officials placed reservation weekend lockdown.

Family friend gatherings. Looks like one thing universal across countries politicians think rules don’t apply Yes 50/50 debate split 50/50 denialist hugbox anti-vax hugbox, surprising. stronger Trump Administration lazy habit dropping responsibilities states, “states autonomy rights important.” states deal national rollout, it’s scrambled 50+ govts going lots different directions.  Yup, two friends actually Hotel Quarantine right migrating back New Zealand. Well look forward too. can’t concentrate well now.

Are people going actual isolation arriving NZ? hope too. Especially vaccine ramp count govt, would nothing

The government funded research led vaccine put order made worth making vaccine. vaccine coming government. Pfizer skimming top. definitely purpose. thank you! lot older-generation people workplace. think many, all, wearing mask (or do, come straight walk door workplace).

Otherwise, probably lot ""chin slings"" ""nose support"" (ie: wearing nose) wearers then.

In America follow Q (anon) great news US behind getting even essential workers vaccinated. probably vaccine without capitalism. People like money

All basic research public funded order vaccine coming government. capitalism little it. do, thanks tip!  Yeah, think on-topic. [1point3acres lists nothing mRNA approval conditional emergency hasn’t fully reviewed approved normal process. approval standard used really verifying vaccine isn’t immediately harmful. Either false positive outlier. things happen rare  may want watch: 

Very accessible -- gives short explanation many research results, main diagrams graphs article.

One comments youtube page authors list cites -- rather lengthy.  parents received it, retire young get high risk category work hospitals. know vaccine 100% guarantee prevent extreme case death end getting covid, huge weight lifted shoulders knowing first dose. *role, roll Pfizer started expanded capacity mRNA production *initial* exploratory partnership BioNTech 2018, targeting flu business unit. Pfizer's cold chain storage (as far know) unrivaled industry. current Pfizer product uses materials produced 3 different Pfizer facilities- St. Louis, Andover (MA), Kalamazoo (MI). understanding technical capabilities scale Andover exist elsewhere, multiproduct development facility begun 2015 operational 2019. [It awarded Facility Year Award 2020 International Society Pharmaceutical Engineers, primarily multi-product development strategies multi-suite everybody place like lying around. Wrong. multiples vaccine spread across multiple manufacturers. logic rich, 10x need cost hoarding vaccine countries. weren’t consumers. least masks easy enforce place like supermarket. 

In houses typically worn. 

Also time spent contact us much lower. 

We limited hours supermarkets Melbourne worked ok. cannot wait competent leadership actually fucking jobs. God damn many families suffered this. Fucking unreal. Even somehow got extra could always sell donate countries. Wait. could asked? Winter olympics 6 months Tokyo. Yeah missing important point: vaccinated, possibly safer future. Since COVID never eliminated, either commit living like hermit rest life go ahead get immediately. disease keep circulating around world forever. reasonable Monday morning quarterback decisions know advanced countries ordered 2-3 times doses per person did. Well, idea community spread could driven low enough level would possible staged reopening keep things control testing quarantining new clusters. can't deny work lot countries messed let fall wave grow control, that's idea could happened proactive acted fast stop second wave. gotten bad that's probably table, could least probably reduce damage winter surge lockdown vaccine widely distributed.

Also, goes way beyond saving people die anyway say. According CDC numbers 20% deaths age 65, that's significant hit people work force, mention hospitalizations severe cases would go top deaths. also wide-ranging unpredictable effects letting disease spread uncontrollably community; businesses going operating properly employees sick time, health care system might get overloaded, dangerous mutations might develop, knows else. us probably smart enough even begin comprehend possible risks leaving something like control.

Finally I'd add even people dying covid age they'd die naturally, actually dying natural causes loved ones able visit them, getting basically tortured death completely alone. lot people seem forget say ""but going die anyway!"" dog eat dog society? nobody else entitled sweat brow? Funny sudden people start talking social contract gave thought remembered said could tiny impact vaccine effectiveness yeah falling outlier category atm pro-lockdown lockdown worked. entire population worked together eliminate virus know virus accidently introduced beat it. economy ok vast majority people back work. People mostly free travel around country holiday visit friends family.

I know many places lockdowns work borders close understand frustration forced lockdowns proved work are.  Agree 100% extra vaccines wonderful problem have. I'm sure countries would welcome aid situation.  year, infinite life span write big chunk feel safe. military's involvement would come handy. Theyre incredibly efficient logisitcs side things. Trump administration flat killing people. It’s going best part year now. Surely huge amount USA population immunity stage  Likely prevents spread.

Scientists don’t like say things unless sure, know months sure. british variant, proven evade antibodies yeah, probably outlier ""Too many cases now"" legitimate argument. Trying eradicate COVID stage game would like trying avoid accident airbags already deployed. mean can't learn mistakes. mean right, possibility ending COVID getting control US without mass vaccination basically nil.

Don't make excuses, also try little, late approach. least bad effects, occur, supposed pass day lockdown australia? looks like people still partying me. mean... already old test it? 90+ take larger sample size becomes really matter efficiency. guy claims NHS able do, top magicking 65 million vaccines thin air (they're currently manufactured rate around [2 per week) also need find enough venues 10+ million people per day get vaccine enough nurses trained volunteers administer 10+ million vaccines per day. Follow Costco's example toilet paper. Everyone gets line, old hospital ID go front. one saving toilet paper incase show later. thing take vitamin cheap reason to. qualified evaluate paper. *other* hand know sub interested vitamin D. found Akiko Iwasaki's twitter see knows bad science good. No, british variant Youre right. quit job get evicted family take chances woods. better odds way surviving together. Good plan! fair, first kid turned nutjob even pandemic. countries, know Canada, issues underground parties/bars/clubs became super spreader events. suspect concerns may cause behind this. Washington quite far Washington haha lol yeahh ill make lie someone making post disappearing lmao weird ass specifically make possible? No. one getting sick dying cannot use emergency approval measures like places, need wait full approval process. Also limited vaccine supplies moment make sense send New Zealand could literally save lives elsewhere. Ah, old ""ass pull"" study. make stuff up, call true, base social policy it. calls man? fact upvoted late sad. took single city *everything* right, Melbourne, 3 months get rid COVID *after* initial lockdown whole Australia. 7000 active cases.

I'm surprised people still think possible. I'd outraged thought government holding fear shutdown 2 weeks. Listen Fauci speak potential eradicating COVID (or even ""effectively ending pandemic""). much complicated almost infinitely difficult making be. No, vaccine means lower chance catching COVID. Even trial group(with vaccine) 9 times less people caught COVID control group (no vaccine). One still sick COVID. purpose vaccine reduce burden healthcare, reduce transmission. vaccine eliminate viruses unless burns itself. California, people whatever want. Homedepot, clothing stores, shit open. Trivago? 


Jail New strain really taken yet. Holiday gatherings times exponential growth already taking place.  Went right head haha touretts episode positive response also. NY Times Daily podcast topic info: can't read article paywall speak experience. know somebody works health department they're getting slammed. good people want get vaccine need also bad specific county enough supply cover demand people really upset it. Thanks President Trump making possible. wonder fuels gap 25-44 15-24. what, 6-7 times likely die young adult vs adolescent? Why? people like shutting businesses wearing masks.

I thought *idea* everyone supposed sacrifice little bit end pandemic. 

If pandemic inconsequential healthcare workers, perhaps given first dibs vaccine. perhaps legally compel healthcare workers put hours vaccinate people via Defense Production Act. rollout pretty poorly planned executed. Getting vaccine done fast amazing, getting people gone well. :-) won’t. common folks want whatever Queen has. Queen got Moderna everyone want Moderna.

No vaccine brand got Royal Warrant now. 0% ICU capacity Santa Clara County. public health policy decided politics gut feels instead science, get fact: -40, water wet. want volunteer get vaccine monkey, guest. based video going trust monkey knows find acromion process, understands 90 degree angle is, distinguish muscle subcutaneous tissue. 

(Also, video begins warning never practice nursing skills without proper credentials).

Personally, I'll wait human who's training assessments. never, point comment, blamed foreign country. matter administer vaccines slowly. I'm sorry going this. Covid horrible disease. Hopefully feel better soon. paper title. rules several nations complete control without oversight. could call WWIII send nukes multiple nations around world one say no.  Look celebrations Lakers Dodgers championships. Check r/LosAngles, find occasional posts street takeovers, large gatherings, protests, lots anecdotes families gathering. Tarbarnac! Stock poutine whole still can! don’t want work extra hours. offer double pay might consider no, like time There's group people subreddit seem weirdly defensive criticisms vaccine rollout. completely absurd   numbers going keep going up.  scientist, called hypothesizing. Thank god highly important .... wait   ""It's new. needs testing.""

Makes want say, ""who's going take one team, then? People you?"" think appease ""we need lockdown we're fine!!!1!!"" crowd. Earlier someone replied comment mine claiming QUARTER infections lead PERMANENT lung damage got upvoted, like wtf

People seem forget flu cause long term effects, too. rare. Somehow talk covid sub, though, ""very rare"" goes window think everyone gets fucked life. people get even fucked *for week*. QUEEN LIVE FOREVER reaches 5,000 it'll Normandy Beach everyday reference wish vitamin got much press hydroxychloroquine. I'm 5000iu myself, plus whatever multiple vitamin. Glad recovered quickly. Yeah bad optics giant blue echo chamber matter.. posted articles according headline content sub would miss news.  bad it? Can’t worse getting COVID. still head state. [general older less republican younger generations (as might expect). safe assume average consensus neutral slight favourable view HM obvs get hardcore monarchists republicans. past month 7 day average basically doubled. we're looking 6-7k day end January.

We really begun see effects Christmas New Years gatherings yet. likely late deaths Thanksgiving Christmas shopping....or people getting covid fatigue caring anymore. freedom way run country, communal problems need solved ways limit people freedom's long term they'll much less free even, climate change, COVID

the US democracy also ""authoritarian"" efficiency think problem is, camping “safer” wouldn’t call safe. Right safe thing stay home. Anything else involves potential accidents near strangers sharing bathrooms less safe. probably fine man, I’d rather stay home months. honestly someone fear virus would doing:

Here's let correct honestly rich politician top tier access personal doctors six figure experimental treatments one else access therefore fears virus less would doing: living life far lower risks.

You're fooling think level here. entire reason hospitals filled normal people ""don't fear virus living normal lives."" banned America. Imagine Blitz people London felt entitled keeping lights curfew violated freedoms.

But different era, one everyone knew life hard. Today, capitalism advertising taught people anything want, idea restricting freedoms seen insane. mass death Without fans Tokyo shit brick. They’ve spent trucks full money, expecting return. That’s article says. can’t safely care patients. US less per capita deaths Belgium, Italy, Czechia, UK, Peru. Spain France far behind. health minister start pandemic, referred lines up. context think right word, trains get delayed, events delayed , total abandonment something year would warrant word cancelled Locked constant off-topic rule-breaking. lot food workers wealthier countries (like US) also meager incomes much savings? Asian countries tendency overreach sensationalized matters related covid. example, Chinese locked 11 million people couple hundred cases. Koreans warned "" virus war zone"" (actual term) 600+ cases day. exaggerated reporting Japanese? So? Really odd what’s problem? You’d Olympics February July. 
It’s happening year. People won’t ready it. year get back simple things like eating going movie. Next year full return big events. So, data yet guessing?  running mouth shit feels good. What's point saving life actually lived?  78 year old man multiple underlying health issues one diabetes 2. It’s miracle survived bless soul. health issues seems he’s outlier. Connecticut West Virginia nursing homes residents completely covered dose # 1 right now. February, they'll second doses. states agreed you, keeping folks hospitals save lives. go, deeper link: *If* really wanted, could arrange everyone get three weeks food, literally shut - point everyone *have* close personal, isolated.

At least hail from, scandinavia, doable, able contain within weeks, even close *borders*.. kindergardens.. supermarkets.. stupid beyond measure. Oh, next zero tracing.

It's late, of.. something else.. everywhere *could* island.

I'm literally losing mind close year mostly self isolation. Except death toll much worse Belgium US, see Worldometers Case Tracker, Belgium 1750/million, Italy, Bulgaria, UK, US, Hungary pass US soon, disaster last 6 weeks, Hungarian doctors predicted back November EU countries could gone EMA :) Hungary example considering allowing Russian Sputnik vaccine. 

The UK took risk, right hindsight, could also gone way. One good example poorly PPE. whether using povidone iodine neti pots gargle solutions could help. purple I’m sure that’s true. think people elated worldwide Olympics back
in summer 2022 rushed Olympics 2021. reasonable compare regular time without pandemic. 

I wonder market research they’ve done. Even people country aren’t supporting 2021 Olympics.

I hope it’s possible seems unlikely difficult.  Google Tahoe, screwed right snow season, Yosemite tracked COVID wastewater well, COVID goes camping saw someone twitter post stat, uncredited, corrected it: one five people *who tested* test positive. 

That's different one five people county actually it. (I believe stat like one 15 17 virus) 

The advice still same: stay home. sources one surveys vaccine refusal (at least published). common sense would say many black healthcare workers, like many healthcare workers general, refusing vaccine. evidence larger vaccine resistance black community solidifies fact many black healthcare workers refusing vaccine.

Also, black healthcare workers disproportionately (to population) staff nursing homes long-term care.

So multiple inferences .... late May early July me. Gosh hope not! Amazon distributes lot food medical supplies.  France iirc order limiting selling products. Well disagree necessarily global government likely going happen. Wealthy developed countries get first.

My point Israel's access vaccine necessarily politics, economics. second half? SA Brazil variant waiting wings well. certainly do. things essential. 

Discretionary passenger travel not, however. Yes pre vaccine. children need documented proof 100% caught vaccines attend public school. vaccine children allowed back public school system till receive vaccine. Yeah poor government sods little time prepare eventuality. real answer good job early stages pandemic don’t *any* existing immunity. 

We shortage people don’t give fuck COVID restrictions. didn’t get sick Florida/Texas making headlines. Now, due exponential nature disease growth, we’re seeing entirety previous 2 waves states once. 

The state massively fucked approach It’ll happen.

I know someone work state’s waiting list blue got text message yesterday telling come location 11AM Monday get shot. What? hell matter get vaccinated? line now? Jeeeesus.

Hopefully “anything feels good evil selfish” narrative dies soon. Also, bartender, fuck “bad evil bar” bullshit. idea “the bar” became scapegoat I’m sick it.   B-117 sure sound scary. trolling anything misleading? average age 78 80, many deaths higher age, people already lived past statistical life expectancy.

If life expectancy 80, one person dies 70, 80, 90, average years life lost zero.

This say virus dangerous fatalities heavily skewed towards people almost end lives already. Name calling “you’re anti-vax” going bring around though.

Not everyone brave. people cautious nature. It’s made, are.

Besides, care? get vaccine move life. That’s I’m going do. It’s right wrong, simply doesn’t matter someone chooses vaccinate.  look like it. athletes won't, will. Paralympics especially tough choice. governments fault 100% stimulus taking seriously. countries agreed 1 month lockdown every business provided small income enforced; could let hospitals handle current cases slow transmission together. empathetic business owners survive, everyone remote office job paying 80k put shoes.  Spanish flu official name, probably worst pandemic ever last phrase simply ridiculous people organizing, entities taking part sponsors financing it.

This sleepover party, bit complex organize. Skip restaurant owners, pay employees directly. That's exactly right. argument 3x population easily countered advances acceptance germ theory. But, since that's devastating argument, acknowledge it. They'll keep spouting nonsensical, discredited 40k - 60k flu numbers, etc., keep talking per-capita deaths. person declining vaccine working hospital anymore. putting patients lives risk. It’s exaggeration highest order suggest scientific community whole thought we’d full on, clear 2021. 2 articles vaccines sitting around unused,what mess,this complicated is. friend STILL insists reinfection common saw one article April May claimed immunity lasts three months, something that’s debunked again. Normalize changing opinion presented new information! coronavirus puts bed fatigue, headache, nausea, high temp, walking around infecting people? contagious 48 hours symptoms, asymptomatic whole time, spreads, right? Every big city needs something like this.  Totally agree. poorly managed every level. biggest thing right didn’t train anyone college degree whatever requirement want, administer vaccines? first semester nursing students qualified, surely could found others jab arm. way could vaccinating literally 24 hours day getting supply have. Belgium asked New Zealand secret sauce? NZ's success due thousand+ km moat, shared world? put Octopus Pasta Marinara Sauce... never forgive maneuver 

( Italian US citizen traveled city US Marine Corps. didn’t order expect .... damn :) )

^^ fun anecdote city speak fondly day, 15 years fact . Good job guys! Hope gets better quickly you.  /s 
(fify) agree Ontario observe Quebec's result think time watch. takes several weeks results seen luxury waiting new cases exploding. Either start limiting considered 'essential' business impose curfew remind people serious virus is. short answer mutations regular part viruses. flu vaccine generally different every year try cover variants active time constant game hit miss flu virus usually mutates season. keep talking developing ""universal flu vaccine"" covers variants able yet. Flu vaccine efficacy often good, 39% last year trending 10 exactly plays Covid remains seen. clear already mutating. strains contagious. possible less contagious less deadly too. Dry ice -78C, though. I'm sure they're using lot Pfizer distribution. One might believe Pfizer targeted -70C reason. recently released statistics covid prevalence healthcare workers post-vaccine? Sweden lot closer Nordic neighbors European average. 

But important note quite well took least authoritarian approaches Europe. Light, short lockdowns, light touch mandates well. 

Population density doesn’t matter much urbanization rates. US Sweden quite similar terms both.  Saddle easy remote island nation, harder 200 different entries country like many European nations do.

Like Germany gonna quarantine everyone coming country? Every truck driver, every tourist, every businessman? Impossible.

This like saying ""why california close travel states, new zealand style?"". work entire society relies goods people moving states/countries countless entrypoints security.

The amount people moving Germany, France England astronomically higher people moving New Zealand. country like germany saying people coming Poland/CZ/France/Netherlands quarantine 2 weeks, enforcing that, would mean total collapse german economy. that's mention impossible do. Doubts based idle speculation

So making conclusions based information defined ""doubts based idle speculation"". Funny way phrase it.   imagine portion population takes seriously taking seriously like deniers. would like then. Thanks sharing that! Yeah level quarantine heavily depends seriously take covid. Obviously think covid threat, may accidentally spread it, since likely professionals infectious disease. quarantine needs done government.   Thanks tip! Mostly misinformation. Many parrot don’t want “guinea pigs”. People actually that. Fortunately Japan super interested bombing US, attack Pearl Harbor intended keep US able attack long enough claim key resources Japan lacked. Bombing west coast would counterproductive, knew US would *eventually* geared war Pacific attacking civilians industry would make US less likely accept peace terms Japan's favor. missed aircraft carriers *really* underestimated viscerally US reacts attacked. NJ here. phase everyone in? I'm 2, wife 1B. headline poor since population country increased much since then. important info deaths 15% last year significant. 1918 46%. I've heard allergic reactions, person knows really soon problem. sudden problem days weeks later fairly unlikely. haven’t fewer excess deaths shows excess deaths mid December, data end November til mid December still tabulated.

They going exceed excess deaths year. AKA liquid nasal condom infurating many chose offering money instead telling people stay home, though. It’s trend idiots thought could allow unchecked spread virus vs. going elimination virus via public health measures. Every time virus infects someone risk mutation since globally we’ve let infect many people dealing variants.  Careful now. People really like accuse Winnie Poo lying. That’s really gamble lot people, that’s saying I’d rather take chance live park sleeping bag eating cans beans every day. Mutations always happen, possibly hundreds coronavirus variants already... kept lights got bombed night. 

That’s bombing worked WW2. could say “if kept lights someone within mile got bombed night”, perhaps? get rude confronted fact data don’t agree with. cool.

I debated good faith you. I’ve answered questions rethoric formal, told don’t really care causes deaths happen lives worth protecting. don’t agree point, think mostly leasing us road.

Look moving 10 day average mortality Denmark. It’s around 30 average last weeks. Adjust per capita it’s around twice compare Sweden, deaths around 50-60 day average. Yeah shame got crisis point government come effective strategy, stick saying, hopefully normally return soon. white prejudice exciting guess mean “multiple countries full lockdowns sure numbers go bit go right back things open”? country short quick lockdowns opening back back 0. We’ve months living normally cases. time spread people countries like bring spread usually error quarantine. every country locked like us would gone now. seriously think reappears nowhere? I’ve heard Sinopharm. known name? actual answer already bought enough doses every American want put eggs basket

No, that's stupid. Every country ordered enough vaccine vaccinate people least **six times** end march. Whoever delivers first wins, rest given away poor countries.  curious whole family got shots already? somehow high risk? talking averages. everyone 28. I'm talking herd immunity, I'm talking drop cases. say I’m 100% certain New Zealand wpuld bad every country europe placed europe Deaths per thousand would interesting number compare imo  None want go to. Great job Boris. Even NY state system crashed hasnt really opened up. Department Defense expected send around 150 members military shore staffs medical centers, spread virus overwhelming number hospital patients pushing healthcare system limits.  people Air Force nurses Army medics

When nothing else works, army left. Well, variant Japan found Brazilians travelled there. Also, already variants UK SA territory. 

About study, already talked reached herd immunity reality Manaus all. Impossible much reinfections once, first place world happening:

  lot less therapy available care well, ""treated lasting permanent damage"" much lower today.

Here interesting article KY read bit ago, talking average age hospitalized ICU. start looking age density realize much older populations today 1918, provides compelling story. fair portion people 65 hospital C builtin bool, would get syntax errors missing semicolon line 1 No, *one* dollar microbrews. 

Inflation, brah. Lmao == atheist/agnostic toxic, believe makes less zero sense, basil cell skin cancer we're talking about, ADVANCED cancer patients, NHS condemning cancer patients death Bye bye olympics !remindme 1 month praying wrong god. god like him. That's logical explanation Pope Francis much believes COVID-19 threat believes everyone ethical responsibility get vaccine.

To make joke based prayer bad low hanging effort take jab Pope much progressive predecessor actually pushing attention climate change, example. took it. 

""There between 12,201,641 and 22,456,373 people front queue COVID vaccine across Canada"" 

Fuck life.  Well doesn’t want seem like he’s jumping line privileged

Then comments arguing kind privilege? 

If turn, I'm cool it. EMS xp aspects life government control? Good points note - ya, think anyone saying miracle cure, one arrow quiver - mask, distance, avoid unnecessary interactions, take vitamin D, gargle neti, get plenty sleep (best thing keeping immune system strong)

I'm curious, though - occasional salt water gargling really bad people hypertension? spit water, salt intake supposed limited even little bit occasional gargle would hurt? read rate 10M per day. He's saying going slowly. Nobody cares live say want country safe second need gun weapon defend time call precious pig you’re fucked good luck Lateral-flow devices accurate pinpointing infected individuals criticised generating large numbers false negatives. Nevertheless, many experts welcomed expansion testing programme, 131 local authorities already agreed implement explain summer olympics compete Winter Olympics? used year 4 year intervals. global crises isn’t terrible impossible idea. It'll interesting (and believe one day will) see breakdown countries regions well reasons did. province Canada well since spring 4 active cases right all. cases since April linked travel. lucky? geography (partially island remote)? travel restrictions? Masks? measuring cases per 1m population California worse Texas. mean overall since beginning pandemic now.  You’re right - guess mind they’re group “vaccines cause autism”..and vaccinated shots...it’s new.

Thank 10k trial...I’ll use next time talk them. I’m trying bring causally push even away. think need load points like talk them

Also yes, racist - that’s whole ‘nother problem unfortunately...also working -_-  much fear realizing tougher measures needed. can't reason virus half ass response. That's useless. Everybody wants go back normal safe happen people keep flagrantly spreading virus. stop virus first stop idiots. realise pope’s life isn’t important anyone elses hope not.

Until now, mostly young people got Covid-19 wave. Japanese television give often count age group. young people infected, deaths low, think.

If continues, could get worse.

However hunch far already dying underreporting. reason assumption is: read severe cases get admitted hospitals. Everyone else isolate home people died home too. found later dead homes.

If counts Covid-19 death not, know. Also testing still expensive. 

Here articel: http://www.asahi.com/sp/ajw/articles/14088861  Unfortunately, much reliable. article says, many variables unknowns, like many people agree vaccinated fast vaccination process go. general idea now. ""Smart people""  Well duh, alternative letting expire fridge. hope vaccinating anyone can! people like spreading it.  Oh sure, def trump. countries response virus failure several levels, highest one. Yeah let’s stay home forever you’re happy life you’re selfish.

How people even begin think like this? Even tribes Amazon Covid. Mongolia think cases. covid single largest cause death US? Jesus christ. even beats cancer hear disease now. true? UK thriving post brexit. money went EU helping NHS /s question could beneficial future ... Moderna late SARS game research paid SARS...2. 

Lots good stuff here... refrigeration, powdered vaccine... Awesome. work COVID response area think lot.  can't imagine devastating was, especially heels WW1. COVID average age death though, fact mainly elderly dying minimize current situation. !remindme 1 month Yeah, California bad deserves local news stories. national scale nothing special though. wave won’t even make us worse average state deaths per capita. They're going push Winter Olympics. They'll held scheduled, restrictions. much money lost take place. post day Walmart something “electing new pope” establishments need curbside deliver.

That's Germany. working fine easy take delivery, like pizza places cheap Chinese. places need expensive location.

Fine dining pretty much dead, going die. Pubs too.

In long run matter. said done, someone come along money restart places. timely... crisis, looked bit drug development.
Mostly, seem problem find substance works vitro kill patient.
It's case deliver affected tissue. mean, I'll go get bloodwork checking vitamin levels overdose something? sure otc available wanna take risk. Even I'd willing need feel bad. meant make laugh! one gonna take vaccine, lot healthcare workers rejected it, 80 meant account untested cases well; mostly people saying across local twitter. I've yet see actual study, suppose predictive based number factors LA. word online - ""one five people COVID LA, therefore stay home much possible"". want clarify train guy, fully acknowledge COVID far severe flu common cold, get annoyed people post blatant misinformation either end spectrum.

\- schmuck met supermarket Also, thread already seen literally thousands people. 

The odds least one dream somewhat related pretty high. Like magic disappear. exact words. think retrospect starting nationwide lockdown wrong call. Much country used aggressive measures many cases region time lacked return plus financial assistance so. believe God nature believe tho 40 64% stop saying that. go 200k today full amount need tomorrow. ra p needed far more.

Or know 70s want it, offer large group still vaccinate. Already making excuses them, it'll another kiss target, point they'll make.some.other big claim everyone go cool give hope ignore yet another massively missed target. Yeah definitely, I'm recommending go dosage one dose. Stick dosage timings studied Pfizer says exactly said, good data anything post 21 days one dose. I'm saying 50% number 1 dose misleading.

 regards concrete numbers talking about, I'm referencing graph all. I'm referencing table linked moderna study Vaccine efficacy 92% two weeks dose 1 CI 68.8-99%. 

Pfizer analysis 14 days dose 1, data mirrored moderna almost exactly, coupled graph flattens around day 14, pretty obvious Pfizer gets nearly full immunity around day 14. Pfizer's one dose data table format looks almost exactly like moderna stuff analysis on.

Is I'm saying pedantic really super useful public policy stage? Yes. nice know 14 days 1 dose, possibly even less, safe long follow next dose. true. It’s false either, data isn’t back studies done specifically, based vaccines, it’s difficult someone that’s vaccinated transmit virus. basic idea get virus body trained kill pretty quick, virus transmit. dies there's spare used model could use place, no? site, click deaths instead cases. California 26th. lot reason high cases higher rate testing California.  city red. sucks love place people charge care lining pockets tourist dollars. in-laws assisted living Florida still able get vaccine limited supply. gov DeathSentence completely blame lack organization desperation tourist dollars. People flying/driving rules it.  really. one knows sure % required achieve herd immunity specific disease. projection based similar diseases. We'll look countries, like Israel, rapidly vaccinating population, possibly get idea.

Then debate whether we'll get herd immunity infections + vaccinations vaccinations way achieve it. course long antibodies last mutations occur, too. many people COVID unreported.

If unreported cases high, vaccinations + recovery infection contribute immunity, may hit 75% point spring. unreported cases low, vaccinations way forward, could late summer early fall earliest- assumption enough people actually get vaccine first place. New variant every 5 minutes days. also choose guy's wife website story set alarms r/worldnews? makes UK variant newsworthy then? country vitamins available medical prescription?  UK still follow EU law still part trade market etc everything else Jan 2021 Honestly, depends measure. generally maybe?.

I tend look normalized numbers (positive cases per 100k worldometer reports). tends reduce population difference effects. top 10 states southern (5) western (3) (Rhode Island consistent exception). looked, Massachusetts currently ranked 10th per capita.

But that's interpretation. China, workers contact imports, including people, much higher possibility getting infected. Vaccinating efficient build immunity shield. Australian media trying build narrative China care youth old. that, number refused 500m  True, however Italy currently doctors, nurses nursing homes personnel vaccinated first second many waves 80+ year olds happening especially attempted coup. politicians scared rile populace them. Total deaths per million better. Even though lags, won’t confused high testing rates. population 3x bigger helps. there? it? could god let happen  Allows president force companies produce things it’s interest national security, basically. used ventilators earlier pandemic. 

The original idea seems force private companies aid war efforts. bit different, yeah. Yeah 65% full trial. mistake made people got half dose first shot, results promising, group wasn’t nearly large enough draw conclusions from. we’re waiting larger trial new dosing. don’t know testing part. also major lung issues. going there, others cycle continue.
These establishments need curbside deliver. Indoor dining, gyms, theater, salons part problem. Based estimates unreported cases (both could / get tests asymptomatic cases), entirely within realm possibility 33% country already COVID more. PA shut transactions Israel rejected aid Israel UAE. reported May didn’t end much, much later.

so saying ended? Oslo Accords require PA (West Bank) Hamas (Gaza) maintain provide health services.
The PA failed, usual, provide citizens

yeah wonder why, maybe MILITARY OCCUPATION. also fuck oslo accords lmfao suck shit used maintain illegitimate occupation. can't provide fucking service anyone Israel wants Palestinians vaccinated, obviously.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Oh absolutely not, natural herd immunity result deaths literal millions country. pointing certain point, you’re gonna get eventually virus stop spreading. Vaccines thankfully gonna get us there. it’s like 1 17 1 5 No, reason variants showing now

They've showing time. known now, media reported became attention drawer. legal system exposed joke/scam ... state responsible national guard. It’s Newsom mobilize them. federal government sent regular army reservists state without asked, would need invoke insurrection act. certainly mattered Aunt ventilator Covid 3 weeks. gotten ICU week ago. She’s recovery section another person spot.  Logistics easy one charge planning it, one charge cares plan it. open worst case money. know unemployment benefits assume crap.

Still, open many thousands die minimum, worst case hospital system breaks whole country perish.

So sucks still better alternatives. Anyone thought things would back normalcy level would allow Olympics 2021 short sighted straight delusional.

Moreover, experts would predicted we’d vaccine finished phase 3 end 2020, actually 3 different ones. North Dokota less logistical challenges NYC? didn’t read article you? They’re talking percentage previous year. “...That would mark largest single-year percentage leap since 1918.” See thing is, longer lasts money make. News outlets anything sweet sweet clicks.. work advertising whole year made reconsider entire career Dude. Every health care charges thousands use 1970s technology (an MRI). fact it’s technology earth gets expensive time goes on. Case closed. And, someone opts go back line. Make decision stand say can't take reasons jump back line later. Mexican partner is. main reason boils Mexico mostly poor country. Whether results large workforce can’t sit home work, receive stimulus health care system inadequate poorly funded. Testing also limited, numbers much worse reality reported. Additionally, wouldn’t trust government report accurately either. give idea trust level Mexicans officials, 90% crimes go unreported. police, military government trusted vast majority citizens good reason. 


The government also completely useless best, would argue made situation much worse inaction.


Another main factor lot population doesn’t ability work home. Especially poorer parts population need go work sell stuff able afford live. Many shops can’t afford access tech solutions richest countries access to. Things like using ubereats selling online offering curb side pick isn’t reality businesses.


There ton reasons, main thing know it’s impossible expect country like Mexico handle pandemic way rich nations can.


Please note: absolutely love Mexico, it’s people, culture history. Mexicans reading this, hope stay safe healthy. Can’t wait go back pandemic with. I'm making statement coca cola, two olympics year compete other.  There's several levels nurses. get level education. Also, even knowledge fades while. I'm electrical engineer solve electromagnetics problem save life.  Less populace places easier logistical challenges. Headlines like embolden skeptics even public.

This likely releasing doses vaccine sounds like horrible idea. know short term side effects concerning. number people tested 1-2 years long term side effects precisely zero. valid concern. there's way enforcement stop people visiting friends' house

do want give list countries, including developed english-speaking democracies, did? would say every person puts one slowing spread. Masks alone won’t prevent though. even compliance 100 percent.

It carries significant mortality like 22% 5 years. I'm saying investigated, certainly cause panic possible coincidence. literally cases (per capita) couple months ago. massive achievement based were. difference China consistently systematically lies data. even close. summarize, saying saliva tests effective test nasopharyngeal one? one time put faith Big Pharma, now. Nooooooooooo. daughter wants compete Olympics! Don’t crush dream! wants come back “Dancing Stars”. 🤣 [As graph shows, around 33.64 million people UK 40 older source, data shows mortality rates 40+ account 95%+ deaths drop death rate 95% 200,000 vaccinations day, seems like take 168.2 days less (since things speed time). might wrong, like looking graphs figures. Hope get fired That's meant, people wear mask even common cold something, went metro always see someone mask. normal thing there, course there's less resistance wear pandemic.  Anecdote, family member works nurse ICU eager get vaccinated, aware single coworker opted getting vaccine.

Immunity evasion happen. source this? available elementary school kids teachers vaccinated would close schools? Lmao dork Friday, governor announced medical providers could vaccinate wider range essential workers New Yorkers 75 years older starting early Monday. Marc Molinaro, executive Dutchess County, north New York City, critic governor’s vaccine distribution effort, said new rules “a smart move.” new guidelines speak challenges administrating mass vaccination program country whose health care system includes public private hospitals, pharmacy chains clinics. Best wishes her. mother still waiting home MI Walgreens get shit together. 20 days behind Lmao. need stop proud things nothing with. Relax. need friends money. *BuT VaCcInE nOw!* Hot take: news outlets posting articles saying still ""normal"" even months get vaccine, actively harming vaccination efforts. ""Normal"" near future huge incentive get vaccinated lot folks, included. Telling still normal 2022 even get jabbed spring, gonna slow uptake.

I'll still get regardless, understand need keep measures at-risk process getting vaccinated. articles frustrate me. Says immune thrombocytopenia ITP. 1/30,000 per year general adults. rare. Actually, transmitted hands. Japanese government certainly concerned.

Bet they'd wished done keep Filipino nurses around. 1/30000 rare, it’s even rarer extreme enough person dies. study looked one modification spike protein variants share, called N501Y, believed responsible easier transmission. Pfizer researchers University Texas Medical Branch Galveston conducted laboratory tests see mutation could thwart vaccine. 
They used blood samples 20 people received vaccine, made Pfizer German partner BioNTech, large trial shots. Antibodies recipients fended virus lab dishes, according study, posted late Thursday online site researchers. 
 

Great news. case posse kills another bad guy stumbles across. One good guy, two bad guys. No, there's correlation, choose see it. Please explain I'm curious say this. live there? Already found thread. current US President behind Operation Warp Speed publicly campaigning vaccine since May?

It's crazy many still denying existence virus questioning vaccine President basically admitting real pushing ""cure.""  Good bot thank you.  think people referring people scientific expertise like physicians scientists, opposed practical care workers like nurses techs.

I think sort point. Nurses experts practical elements administering treatments care. They're experts sciences medicine pharmacology. Poor coca cola, wouldnt want impacted. No, we're experts vaccines listened regard.

I mean say healthcare workers experts epidemiology hey are.

It's ""gotcha"" moment since ""this subreddit worships healthcare workers listens everything say disagree it"". Leadership starts top. US government incompetent created new legion anti-vaxxers. use quotes “over” people talking arbitrarily deciding pandemic suits them. 

Nothing left right political leaning. entire health district done 2 weeks. almost delay due people delaying scheduling see people did.

Again - can't emphasize enough - care ***data***, feelings it’s still wait supply.

Almost state waiting supply. fact, may case state waiting, done enough research literally don’t vaccine shelf give out

We know true. Governors resort threatening hospitals use doses don’t weekends like do. 

The data proves lying. *Japan’s National Institute Infectious Diseases said authorities found new strain coronavirus four passengers arriving Brazil.*

*The new variant similarities strains found U.K. South Africa, NIID said statement Sunday. information new variant limited genetic make-up, it’s difficult immediately determine infectious strain effectiveness current vaccines it, institute said.* Could difference life death. Lmao feel bad laughing Viruses absolutely mutate ignore bodies immune systems, ones vaccine puts place, especially much transmission occuring. 

During vaccination phase, recieved feel immune careless exposure, could easily exposed play host variant prevented vaccine. fact [Master's Closer Associate degree. Reading w glasses first thought wrote farts.... Belgium's secret sauce fornfucking baked directly country based on.

I believe Earth created week either.  capitalism-related causes like starvation

Lol gotta push agenda even completely unrelated, non political post huh? Couldnt said better. Plus egoism. instead buying doses promising vaccines expecting October, November, December 2020 said, 'No thanks, plenty possibly coming early mid 2021 manage pass multiple layers testing approval?' vaccines may ever get approval? Labour support vaccination strategy would think God would take special care servant. Covid mutations happen constantly. It’s didn’t worry U.K. Strain.

FTFY Best comment read today. completely misinterpreting article mean , get everything running fine start ,but think alright far. 
I mean 40% vaccine doses given sound way less is. start always hold 2nd shot back don`t vaccinate first shot. 50 % max cap , 100%. 
And prefer vaccination centers empty ready since mid december ready late don´t all. general age group 80 far hardest vaccinate, logistic. agree except athletes narrow window peak performance sometimes. uncertainty probably hardest part literally start training regimens months ahead time perform best. lots facilities aren’t even available. Kinda win situation. trap debt sunk cost?

basically that's countries want olympics anymore, money losing ventures. case japan, could used housing/hotel venues covid isolation could use sporting venues high school, college, pro teams could spread wanted, get another olympics another year. 

they course debts pay, could making good use stuff already curious ( Australia know that's happening bar news read)

When say vaccinated mean full 2 jabs vaccine 2 million single jab?

Because immunity single jab? don’t disagree.  Effectively workforce proven work remotely. Onboarding people affected. Learning org new people much harder. investing collaboration tools (moving stone tablets carrier pigeons help us some). 

Also expensive building space downtown areas prestige something consider. That’s stubbornness. doesn’t way. I’m sure go Olympics 80% local population doesn’t want. There’s significant risk turns another PR nightmare IOC. Plenty people thought high risk died. one predict body's response. well known immune system cause damage.

bruh anti-vax Good news.

We get this. 

Right focus vaccinating everybody soon possible! probably right, many countries/athletes participate, fan numbers way down, look anything like olympics past heard great taking precautions early pandemic. later saw error since changed tune. opinion shows mature leader let ego get way making right decisions someone change views based evidence. Hospitals need staff get position refuse request doctor nurse requests vaccination else leave job. “proper safe” ways bypassed, exactly? sources, please. Facebook doesn’t count. Yea one ever starves non-capitalist countries, never happens. Lmao. Soviet Union great, China based, North Korea full over-fed, happy people. Totally.

Sound familiar? think phenomenon deliberate conspiracy anything group think human nature. think thing happening Covid. Nobody wants present even entertain argument besides consensus control pandemic.

That said think world experienced significantly increased mortality especially March-July time frame. One thing find interesting amount excess steadily declining even reported cases fatalities increasing. virus clearly dangerous lethal lot people, number excess deaths keeping reported fatalities. kind gap there. suspect deaths tallied. think majority fatalities zero sum game, person died Covid going die something else within year two anyway.

All said think concern fiction zero cause alarm, think widely misunderstood. everyone world suddenly agrees something know must something wrong data reasoning.

That's wrong. correct, logical conclusion would be: rank vaccine order precedence risk serious illness, allowing exceptions strictness ranking permit maximum rate vaccine distribution consistent overall goal. that's exactly happening, within limits possible.

I'm actually pretty impressed US response far. certainly done better. agree point it’s one made originally, figure head elitism based birth. thought opening mass vaccinations everyone. following groups eligible seek vaccination accordance New York State (NYS) Department Health prioritization plan: ambulator**y care settings affiliated hospital, including primary care, behavioral health, phlebotomy, physical occupational therapy, specialty clinics, dialysis centers  
-Includes workers **direct contact patients ambulatory** settings, including licensed health care workers, receptionists, environmental staff 
-**Funeral workers** direct contact infectious materials bodily fluids

**-Public health workers** direct patient care responsibilities 
-**Home care workers aides**, hospice workers, personal care aides, consumer-directed personal care workers Holy shit. Canada like 120 per day stage (and peak whole pandemic). insane. Yes, did. Even city 0 deaths per week, still extended mask mandate. one expired even tell us, extended never brought public discussion again. keep clamping down. Adding restrictions. going voluntarily give us freedom back. asking work either. Yes. Hawaii well...  It’s still putting significant numbers pensioners hospital. 10% geriatrics dying infection. Compared 0.003% healthy 40 year olds. think it’s obvious needs locking down. isn’t anyone 50 vaccine two doses 4 weeks apart Fixed! Almost certainly nothing vaccine. Stochastic effects kill least one 5 million random. Car crashes, heart attacks, strokes, cancer, workplace accidents, drug overdoses, capitalism-related causes like starvation, exposure lack access healthcare... pick random group 5 million people US, average, 900 die week. Roughly 60,000 Americans die causes per week average year. wash bleach put food back in. Hell know, I’m smart enough know I’m right person job. also know capable professions exist exactly - hired enabled capable POTUS forget magic wait-lists one knows get shot e.g. admin bad, must senators congresspeople vote November? I'm American clear.  Travanty Colorado Department Public Health Environment joins TWiV discuss laboratory first US detect SARS-CoV-2 variant VOC 202012/01. time assumed AZ vaccine gonna one. already doses contracted needed nation. dumb since free option reason would imagine public transport huge vector. Masks may save cold sub, covid. Dude died insanely rare immune disorder diagnosed within days taking vaccine. It’s worth looking little more. US, like many lockdown countries

Bruh Low dose interferon nasal spray.

Research here:
r/interferon government failed pretty much every level distributing vaccine. Make groups larger get shots arms now, stop worrying optics order vaccinate people in. Thanks!   USA tag? would shit nanosecond politician power it. guess that’s can’t politician. Nailed it. Still human... Japan covid deaths total: 3805

us covid deaths friday: 4112 realize curve doesn’t stay flattened infections increase again? infections contained, virus gets control like California, Texas,the Dakotas, Florida. Infections increase means curve goes back up.

I realize people don’t understand basic principles infection. mistake tell people advance need keep curve flattened. guess assumed people would know infection spreads seeing firsthand. EU/non-EU related. UK proportion vaccinated e.g. Denmark, part EU. bro serious articles MAY? mention vaccines?????????

hahahah fuck last one ""DOZENS VACCINES"" LMFAO hahahahahahaha

oh god much embarrassing literally said nothing 65% based certain dosing 90%+? importantly, actually testing everyone AZ trial, Pfizer Moderna trials tested people became symptomatic? seems like apples oranges comparison, number two vaccines measured way. (Reuters) - Belgium’s death toll coronavirus infections, one highest per capita world, breached 20,000 mark, according official data published Sunday. country, home headquarters European Union NATO, played comparisons show one world’s worst hit pandemic, virologists point missteps systemic problems. Belgium’s government imposed tighter restrictions October rein surge infections, including night curfew, mandatory working home closure bars restaurants, cases started tick recent days.  new normal include: 
Sending people home come work colds, sneezes coughs. 

Calling meetings even though building.  I'm Swedish completely agree him. I'm sure sounded happy sure ain't, truth harsh sometimes. Stop it. Japan barely tests anyone. little idea many actual covid tests Wrong, case UK reinfection patient high blood levels neutralising antibodies time reinfection - meaning antibodies evaded B117 variant. Uptake amongst vulnerable people expected high still remember day told us ""two weeks flatten curve"". that.

No... certainly didn't. think really know many covid deaths considering barely test (11-50k/day nationally country 127m people) No, UK still apart EU December, adhere EU laws. EU countries exact UK allow vaccinations, however chose to. evidence vaccine. Statistically someone would suddenly die 5 million healthy individuals unrelated vaccine. vaccine make grow extra limbs? Asking friend. Agreed. That’s actually pretty pathetic response government considering vaccines sitting around many states. severe cases get admitted hospitals. Everyone else isolate home people died home

Sounds like happening/going happen California. Well put. actually sitting around. That's fact. may ""claimed"" every day person claiming continues arm day continue risk putting others risk. SOMEONE'S arm. There's plenty choose from. many doses earmarked plans arent gonna followed months. takes long, plan sucks. infuriating. one five people la county covid, god, it’s one five new tests coming back positive, please change alarmist lede prick upvoted feel? Vaccine rollouts picking pace fast! narcolepsy among children typically developed 1 2 months following vaccination, idea long took association vaccine disorder discovered. believe goes GBS.

It certainly discovered trial phase vaccine, 

a) Vaccines *can* long term effects.

b) long term effects necessarily discovered trials. Depends upon frame reference. incredible science vaccines created approved quickly. 

Now vaccines available agree it'd awful news general public getting vacinated fall. lack urgency poor government plans around logistics getting everyone vaccinated pathetic. Stay Positive! Even without covid dont blame them. Yes, here's AP Pfizer ran scientific study showing vaccine remains effective Health departments want know this. It’s double edge sword point vaccines people getting infected 100’s thousands day right? We’re inching closer herd immunity? It’s one five tested, one five people. Please correct error! misleading. Hopefully Biden starts unlocking doses people take end fine people fence convinced GF live contact them? data update yesterday Friday, though - give Saturday update entirely day yet  strawman argument, wtf else saying? expect hospitals staff 7 days week, way everyone works 7 days week. Maybe write like child I'd understand trying say Infuriating.  good thing people cold parts country travel Florida winter time. fine. likely anyone wants get vaccinated able June earlier. Even larger restrictions still place there's literally reason people's social lives resume everyone social group vaccinated. example, families seen long time definitely able see they're vaccinated. may longer restrictions business etc lifted 40,000 people day, much supplies handle. 

This great false information. It’s 1/5 people get tested. heavy skew towards positive tests reflect entire population. That’s first thing said boss told hospitals enough doses... thank God Biden going release couple weeks! Thank common sense. 
Somehow everything bad Reddit linked trump. It’s works. 
Same everything somehow Biden’s fault 2022. Everyone job do. government many different levels works well everyone job. Dude, actual fallacy handwaving ""we know"" concerns around. Lol, learn actual fallacies.

Your argument appealing denying science. ""They wrong before"" ""wait science"".

So concern ""maybe something bad, things know bad bad.""

Great, cool. came use argument literally anything. Like know new formulation toothpaste cause cancer?!? dude, youre free go take it. own. Yeah, doses uses they're ""ready"" execute mastermind ""game plan"" use whatever available.

All absurd semantics ""game planning"" emphasis procedural delay artificial time barriers INSANE considering number infections deaths keeps climbing steadily.

Those doses arms. One right another, 24/7 run out, end story. SICK failures dressed bureaucratic double speak time like this. That’s 1/5 people tested, 1/4 population comment implies. wildly different numbers. update comment highly misleading. Pfizer ships minimum batches 925, Moderna 100. cares athlete, Olympics always us anyway. Defund Olympics. ""aren't problem"" meaning simply hospitals rationing care them. course spread businesses. 

California fucked people seeing whoever please without regard masks social distance. downvotes? believe you? local hospital full heart attack bed  plus get free cocaine xanax work can't true, 3 million people die US every year. 1%. anyone else getting annoyed people acting like vaccinated fall/winter great thing? saw someone comment general public vaccines fall “amazing news”. Like kidding me, that’s terrible news, puts us almost 2 years lockdown. you’re first world country can’t get vaccine June latest government failed badly Exactly. sister works clinic coworkers offered vaccine week 1, said want Guinea pig. one took week one. saw people getting little side effects decided want it, vaccines sitting freezer hospital 3 weeks. I'm glad able get now, someone else able get shot 3 weeks ago. new science people understandably wary it.

I think people's problem MRNA, guarantee outside small minority people, even know MRNA Countries simply vaccinate athletes. 

The US 560 athletes 2016. Even every athlete brings 5 people them, that's 5 thousand doses. Basically nothing. Specially June US vaccinating millions everyday. also catching first half holiday surge. include March 2020 March 2021, 12 month period would probably casualties.  No. I'm least conspiracy-minded person world, believe science, anti-vaxxer. said, SUPER new, rushed-to-market vaccine disease exist year ago. Yeah, little skeptical, mind standing watch y'all go first... means.  hate deflections. need defend idoitice healthcare workers selfishly choosing prolong pandemic misunederstood meaning inuit throat-singing. work person distance learning hub (a place lower income students come home inappropriate study- distance them, put room, make sure wear mask, online classes location), assume I’m education essential worker, putting 1b state. agency, non-profit, seems uncertain. Could get vaccine next month, could general public, imma fight like hell get ASAP tho   “What envision cleansing upper respiratory area various points day. morning get up, virus shed started collecting back upper airway, first spray day, go day, can’t always control social distancing end lockdown, nasal sprays throughout day. end day come home basically rinse nose nasopharynx, clean nose, sinuses, back throat viruses initially reside,” Dr Miller said. *maybe* under-12s in-person school fall school adult staff get vaccinated?

Probably kids need face masks hygiene measures well. Well dream watching football game pope, count in. Funny enough ticket like: ""This one me.""

So watch news says: Random dude sneaks soccer match watch game pope.  understand effects like deja vu, like brain picks something read, revises memory happened earlier include thinking something like that, making think thought first did. actually motivates someone get vaccine, it! entirely possible pope COVID already asymptomatic mildly symptomatic.

Rest Peace, doctor.  I’m making imaginary claim countries, that’s logical. I’m responding existing request denied. It’s laughable ask help.  tried thoughts prayers According Bloomberg, jumped 7.01 million Friday 7.7 million Saturday evening. That's 700 k increase, higher 500k earlier week.

So anything, ramped weekend instead slowed . Two years once.  Pragmatic approach. like it. Wearing masks staying indoors won’t stop covid, mitigate it. Hahaha so? cares. Yeah, 3x many people USA 1918, scale accordingly, guess. Pandemics drug-resistant infections might statistically independent events?

Fuck. hundreds mutations. new strain particularly worrying unless hear resistant antibodies. really would love every thread word ""variant,"" ""strain,"" or""mutation"" stickied comment explaining this. Olympics need die period! He's first line anyway age isn’t. Oh shit Dunkey missed Among Us Saturday :( Mine tough too. DONT matter much order can’t get ppls arms. That’s problem. logistics Ironic. could save others death, !remindme (if pope == false) Yeah, almost one Sweden wears masks. Japan seeing seasonal spike countries Northern hemisphere currently seeing countries Southern Hemisphere saw winter. 

Nothing Japan unique all. think add UK well, least points. vaccination programme much forward though. part yes, differ mainly internal policies like defense, taxes, medicines sold pharmacies stuff rest tend follow laws apply Italy end people working live Rome so..it makes sense watch anime, creeping nationalism see coming Japan.

It's become less less funny, outside observer, since 2016. Olympics likely proceed summer, without audiences. They'll require vaccinations participants, coaches, support staff arrive, good enough proceed. Rapid COVID tests great ruling infections. get PCR test. Well don’t agree all. seems quite firmly charge. speech day pretty damn forceful, example.

What makes think that? easy better letting virus win. No-Governor Cuomo. kid, NY seriously micromanaging roll out. Blessed pope himself. would go

to white paradise

that would let people like ?

It's amusing movie *Contagion*, actually believed population would willing go date-of-birth. figured would mostly occupation location (e.g. colleges military bases), overall efficiency. seems politically, way tell elderly people they're near front line.

I personally care vaccinated first, long available vaccine getting arms. Agreed this. Also, should’ve effort contain virus highly effected regions. fact people able travel Manhattan Florida, without even getting tested, disgusting. America would challenge Japan?

Even progressives remain silent Japan basically blueprint “it’s okay print money money debt aren’t real”. mention, lot people really cooperate. Motivation vaccinated high UK moment. highest rare active Covid-19 cases world, 2nd highest rate ever Belgium. last 7 days 0.9% population Ireland tested positive COVID-19. highest world now, one highest rates ever reported.

I’m saying numbers Pfizer using immunity around day 14 simply plotted immunity curve was. reason it’s estimate bad one data collected without second dose. estimate full immunity day 14, it’s estimated 52%, exactly half final immunity. 

If gave one dose followed people could find lot infections occurred, can’t one studied way. 

For record I’m sure it’s bad practically use estimate way I’m worried could consequences. I’m also trying point think it’s funny PhD scientists saying one dose adequate using data analysis method would denied doctorate. Allowing time develop &amp; vaccinate. Covid19 might mutate faster deploy vaccine...? response responding said would gone less month.
Is Thailand done sound easy? widespread mask usage Japan? opened article kept thinking, please don’t cordyceps. know it’s likely evolve something that’ll affect mammals like insects hey, not, point? u/uwuwizard pretty obvious people claiming whole time fraud. Vatican City laws Italy?

Dumb question maybe, would nasal cavity continuously wet using solution make easier virus attach to? Like leaving water sponge becomes mildew? Check yourself, rumors true. friend checked actually able get vaccine whole time It’s super easy get meteorites.

Ebay. Every days holiday. younger sister wrote “national day” whiteboard work people see. got crazy hit. Right. first 6 months heard 18 months minimum vaccine.

But yes, point theres excuse anyone wants one vaccinated July. Hosting Olympics generated surplus host city two occasions: 1932 1984, times Los Angeles. LA never built centralized olympic village, cases spread way used already existing infrastructure. I've always wondered cities avoid debt.  Good you. Hopefully immune response robust enough catch anything encounter. not, hopefully new treatments available you. correct. honestly lot ppl LA gave up. drive neighborhoods getting hit hardest uncommon see 15-20 people hanging out, mostly maskless. unfortunately neighborhoods tend primarily black/brown areas, lot employed workers essential contact strangers. breeding ground disaster showing. live west LA neighborhood im seen 8 documented cases last week compared 1000-1500 east LA. happen? Testing fetus cells? directly, HEK-293 cell line used testing Pfizer vaccine AstroZenica vaccine. HEK-293 established embryotic kidney aborted 1973. say tested fetus cells, i'm saying hit Planned Parenthood fetal cells tested vaccine sludge. used HEK-293 propagate virus test vaccine it. even though HEK 293 cells used *same cells* fetus grew, even though cells *inside* vaccine, Catholics want anything something related abortion. Hence Pope made statement morality vaccine, telling people sinning taking it. 

Here's statement controversy December, Offices Congregation Doctrine Faith: ""The fundamental reason considering use vaccines morally licit kind cooperation evil (*passive material cooperation*) procured abortion cell lines originate is, part making use resulting vaccines, *remote*. moral duty avoid passive material cooperation obligatory grave danger, otherwise uncontainable spread serious pathological agent\[3\]--in case, pandemic spread SARS-CoV-2 virus causes Covid-19. must therefore considered that, case, vaccinations recognized clinically safe effective used good conscience *the certain knowledge use vaccines constitute formal cooperation abortion* cells used production vaccines derive. emphasized, however, morally licit use types vaccines, particular conditions make so, constitute legitimation, even indirect, practice abortion, necessarily assumes opposition practice make use vaccines."" wife got vaccine far developed third arm DNA modification. new ""strain"", already known variant B.1.1.248 Brazil. Media, again, failing research repeating wrong information news agencies. like days ago falsely repeated Pfizer report new variants tested vaccine tested one 17 changed epitopes UK strain. 3 million total deaths, causes. Kardashian Strain! Funny enough - Moderna BionTech much ""big pharma"" they're pretty small companies relatively speaking.

Biontech corporate partnership pfizer here, that's way get money smaller-biotech companies still independent bought  add - also clearly one iota understanding immune system prevents attacking itself.

You immune system *constantly* trying kill cells. process known negative selection, immune cells (through random chance) would attack cells killed.

So vaccine cause auto-immune issues - immune check point would fail. Which, btw, chance (if more) failing live infection virus... soooo. using neti pot, please sure use either bottled water tap water boiled cooled. It’s nice but...they didn’t actually look mutations biggest concern immune evasion. would E484K 69/70 deletion. Maybe, maybe know regardless sequence nearly enough samples enough dissemination information make statement.

So yeah, real evidence really looking evidence either.

Leaders free world right? Al bundy scored 4 touchdowns single game. *4 weeks first Thanks. decide agreements Israel Palestinians superseded opinion?

 U

lmao well someone study international law history goes meyond simping apartheid state... /r/ihadsex really bodes poorly ""no evidence"" argument r/dadjokes Thanks.

Well think willingness vaccinate low country lots ""critical thinkers"" would hard time even efficient vaccines.  Would surprise African Americans vaccine hesitant whites?

I think fact, fact put ways perpetuate prejudice. Specially true, right now. assigning certain minority visibly, loudly characteristics non compliance pretty unfair, unless try make treatment better. really easily used racists argument dismiss future deaths. all, put price tag life. Wow - $40,000 month equivalent $480,000 year. serious coin.  Yeah, I'd think concerned one listening keep getting downvoted etc., flair ensure credibility. would stupid listen random guy internet making extraordinary claim, said expertise. Nurses grab bag insanity. real. I’m teacher Texas places, 1B (that weight gain past year pushed BMI bit- unintended benefit, guess) area’s school districts started amazing vaccine rollouts weekend. got first dose yesterday afternoon, got call yesterday morning. 

The vaccination well organized busy, cops...everywhere. Perhaps it’s Texas recent events nut jobs? Anyway. Texas start governor, hope rest country. Things improving.   None, zero, concern.

Covid hand, 300k deaths. think highly depends vaccine rollout happens. possibility mass vaccinations countries next months reduce virus much easy-to-manage situation. set 2021, work out, way many countries still throes mass outbreaks... delay august september. infrastructure built still there. think plays Fauci's notion 80% people need immune kind ""herd immunity"" achieved. think lot people consider *absurd* amount infected people United States. addition people feel little sick decide get test get test, also reason believe half infected even get symptoms. What's significant almost people developing antibodies therefore resistant reinfection.

We estimate many Americans covers, I'm pretty comfortable saying double digit percentage. That's going lot deal people feel compelled get vaccine. They're either getting immunized vaccine, they're getting immunized sickness might kill them. Either way, brings us closer herd immunity, that's what's important. Close, vaccine expected eliminate 95% otherwise expected hospitalizations related Covid. I'm sure Japan similar stories Korea hospitals overloaded despite far far far fewer active cases per capita elsewhere. lot boiled to:

A. Korea FAR aggressive keeping people mild symptoms hospitalized elsewhere.

B. Corona cases concentrated public hospitals put specific hospitals strain.  Congrats you? Call spoiled I’m quickly running patience I’m exactly cheering thought maybe getting vaccinated 8 months whatever. I’m losing two years early 20s this? financial help, consistent messaging, nothing? can’t see friends even I’m low risk would make psychopath wants kill grandma? Mmkay. Fantastic. 2.85% slow, still faster almost anywhere else earth right now.  Excellent. somebody explain plains states' outbreaks seemed peaked couple weeks massive growth places, like North Carolina, going month since things really took off, signs abatement? wish rest America would use state example. 

Wasn’t North Dakota really awful COVID cases before? so, manage deaths 2 days row, even though daily deaths time high? Olympics go on. Sports gone adapted covid. 

A lot people vaccinated then. It’s going summer time. Still early, downward trend nice see. Even flat trend good state, means holiday surge much effect feared. Username checks almost certainly infections per day vaccinations right now. natural infection leading path herd immunity right now. total worldwide Covid deaths 1.9M? Ah yes, staying homes. place told stay. Funny cowering indoors fear world nothing stop spread. Ah propaganda scare masses. Right time. alternative opening places causing many, many deaths. limited, working home outdoors enough stay fit. suggest common sense actually common, question whether masks worn would never made issue federal level US politics. It'd good, honest, hope Euros (football/soccer) go forward, country qualified would feel bad fans :( come terms definition ”dose”? need two doses vaccine set time interval apart per FDA approval process.  


When 21 28 days come pass even 1, one person can’t get second dose then... know rest. get vaccine “dose” second dose exist earmarked you. Unless doses expiring, can’t reckless stoop standards beneath 1st world country. get 1st dose, there’s second dose frozen -80 name it. nearly *8 billion* world nearly 60 million people would died year anyway, yeah.

You say still big deal without talking ""buried corpses"" whole countries ""perish"". even helping cause obviously catastrophizing. Would love yeah impossible many reinfections newer variant sufficiently mutated. 

The Brazilian variant shares concerning E484K mutation SA variant. hope Brazil gets serious sequencing either prior Manaus antibody study vastly wrong need account greater percentage reinfections change vaccination strategy. Torrent alt? yes obviously Europe would Nazi Reich Welfare State Murica would never implemented everyone would slave, Apollo missions never would existed, app would science fiction. Maybe. also refuse help overweight people heart disease could chosen low fat diet?? sad true.... Pretty sure quote 40% regards first dose. 40% first doses admistered 20% overall. Seems line numbers. Astrazeneca reported hospitalized severe cases vaccinated groups. alone enough make still want get it. saying since beginning pandemic now, implies California worse beginning, cases recently surged pushed California ahead.

That may meant, it’s came across. Indians good/dumb (Am Indian) know, actually pretty impressive amount excuses sub comes states cities fucking covid response represented political side identify with. wish Kolchak, Vrangl, Kornilov Denikin reached Moscow ended stupid Soviet experiment infancy.

Then, stupid comments like would exist. understanding, mutations typically deadly. goal virus rapid spread. become deadly, focus would put stopping it. point don’t even think time really sit decisions make. know proving excellent care, good enough care? stills brain moments don’t know long take fade. I’m unused much death. many codes sometimes one knows name. run someone calls “78 year old male, already lined, already tubed, arrested”. know person that. Maybe fought war, probably fell love once, likely kids grandkids. don’t that. quick decision make. many minutes spend giving CPR? many rounds epi? running low meds? want save can’t. know need ventilator.  It’s difficult decisions.  chaotic vaccine rollout been, really like read. Open 24/7, vaccinate thousands per day hub, opening vaccinations group 1B, let’s fucking go guys. "
