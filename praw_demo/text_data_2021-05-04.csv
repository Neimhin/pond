Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* people New England California.  need send us fucking vaccines. I've waiting list since march There’s huge difference one time vaccinations annual vaccinations. 

COVID like flu polio. two doses Pfizer. assholery get J&amp;J? Tell somebody internet thinks needs sack up.  new thing.

When got first shot Safeway (a grocery store), got coupon 20% $200.  pay .... rallies shit melas. Karma takeover... Also scary fact beyond would lead nation....? rest goons vested interests degree people’s selfishness caused pandemic bad it’s been. excuses getting vaccine become highly self-centered next month two. individuals shouldn’t allowed hold back return normalcy. It’s unreasonable anticipate mostly infecting other. That’s right. ""the vaccine"". actually choice. like J&amp;J? Get BioNTech/Pfizer Moderna. clotting problem. mean nothing stopping people wearing masks. 

You act like mandates mean shit lol millions Americans can’t afford take work sick multiple days

If way solve this... hahaha gotcha looked happened Israel? around 50% adults fully vaccinated steep decline cases. point less 1% peak number new cases. read decline concided J&amp;J stop. agree that? 


I personally think coincidence. This.... system looks giving hope... need positive news.. positive reports.... Notice comment sounds like bullshit say Pfizer, say manufacturer, somehow want comment taken seriously? 

That comment bullshit. doesn’t make sense. It’s merely copy previous comment. Glad caught apparently way. Interesting. Could people didn’t trust HEAT verify people actually vaccinated? case, vaccinated, people worry less. Gotta get lives point. tell you’re smoker? ask doctor check lungs something? Colleges accepting international students would concern. Canadian Mexican cross border travel. 

I'm interested seeing say, Moderns would accepted overseas, countries access ample supplies, visiting. experience. drive hour middle nowhere scheduled first shot end March place available appointments. could easily gotten one city waited now. I'm glad decided drive I'm already 2 weeks past second shot. happen since people ideologically plain scared it.

No herd immunity due lack faith science part. 32 percent Americans fully vaccinated, numbers declining. looking good minimal social pressure less wuss twelve year old, yeah bummer news however, biden said today, cant help feel like may push pretty big carrots way soon I’m sorry, gullible maroons keep touting Pfizer’s marketing materials. 

Was 1.95 billion dollar contract Marian money something? believe it’s US dollars. Pfizer's initial claim New York Times never part Operation Warp Speed, CNN asked company nuance situation.

In response, Pfizer spokesperson Sharon Castillo provided statement said company indeed part Operation Warp Speed.


Was half billion dollars given Biontech German government speed development funny money? 

Was estimated 16 billion dollars technology contributed development US government chump change?  That...is beyond power. 200m 100 days great. 70% requires 30% Trump loving fucks Stay hydrated take omega 3 everyday.   like everyone else, 10-20% immunity prior infection...

Now gonna say fewer get pass less? response worried big effect cases going forward then? Who's forcing anything? ALMOST want keep that. 
Ole slip finger!  lot places fully open summer time put pressure city rethink current policy.

I expect Illinois lift mandate Lightfoot fighting Pritzker, per usual throughout entire thing. happening. Nearly everyone getting one already has. can’t penalize reward good habits. Annual checkups, joining gym, etc. There’s reason couldn’t add vaccine incentive programs. Sure, health insurance biggest fucking scam ever created. done nothing support claim hurt feelings via exclusion violation human rights. Nobody lost anything never real argument begin with. Go ahead put fingers back ears now, big guy.   part, wife talked Hesitant Parents it. Took good bit time show even though done fast done safe, finally got there, getting first week  going reset revaccinated? Great, would like provide link CDC page get information from? Damn dude, harsh way call daughter. they’ll get fired. mask accommodation getting vaccinated. reasonable accommodation offered. refuse take it, that’s different choice. like hospitals mandate flu shot. smart. dumb people play lotto dumb people seem want get vaccinated. Unfortunately crazies worse crazies :/ without kids. Many parents would assume would give kids.

Even country assume more... Open vaccinations US doubt hit 80%. see world ever hit this.  certain society need people refuse vaccine political grounds, mainly “socialism”? Maybe protect can’t vaccinated medical reasons little longer first group sort soldier without them. wondering. state in? awesome, it’s small amount step right direction. businesses take note follow Targets lead. area lower capacity limits, means nothing, refuse spend money businesses mask mandates go away. Grocery store only, online rest.

Better masking avoiding going out, right? Honestly I’m inclined agree you. got vaccine, part. want go restaurant again, anti-vaxxer catches covid thing, that’s them. Time stop punishing socially responsible people. people don’t care Covid never stopped going anyway think moreso people's assessment risk based notion there's conspiracy attached pandemic. They're using faulty reasoning, merely bad premises reach logical conclusion that's still false. go door door offer payments vaccines get basically everyone 2nd category people 3rd category simply $100 doorstep pretty tempting. So… unintelligent people. 
If intelligent, they’d understand simple statistics. Yes, make sure preface complaints things ""yes know they're piece cloth annoying people wear normally elsewhere **but**""  nonsense.

Quite hiccup operation IMO well Dr. Moncef Slaoui's. Check thread respect doc opinion sheds bit light subject. Since population experienced side effect women 50, can’t include entire population received J&amp;J vaccine. Puts rate higher initially appeared. doesn’t negate fact whole thing handled poorly huge drop number first dose shots really concerning. Yes know now. CDC states slow update guidelines. According administered, last report 12 April, 66538 doses Sinopharm 45654 AZ, noting half AZ dose recipients received one dose point: http://www.health.gov.sc/wp-content/uploads/COVID-19-VACCINATION-UPTAKE-REPORT_10TH-11TH-12TH-APRIL-2021.pdf many flu cases usually get per year? too. I'm trying impress anyone prove ""freedom"" going science. I'm what's best me, family, community. understandable, think country would best eliminate unnecessary barriers. I've heard father law trust random volunteer give shot....only doctor. think he's wrong, we'll better accommodating rather ignoring that.

In case, I'd encourage call doctor. belive doctor would want get shot, whether give you, maybe address enough concerns help get vaccine. (I dunno, maybe give it, maybe recommend trust, dont know).

I understand wanting batch medical errands. I'd anyway encourage wait til June. know motivations are, number good things happen sooner people get vaccinated sooner (less deaths, less suffering, less restrictions, etc). 

I guess overall, really want vaccinated. you, me, neighbors, world. want sooner rather later. I'd definitely take later rather never. hangups totally valid. think really atep back amd listen people amd understand preventing getting it, best remove barriers. I'm advocating best can. time, think positively encourage (without shaming, often case) barriers front them, whatever shape take, overcome get vaccinated anyway. It’s database anyway

Hello, NSA. CEO speak subject.
It job scientists, compagny selling something get re-infected, means likely passing onto someone else *and* chance mutation.

Not that, might *not* survive time.

The cost vaccine minutes sore arm. shot took *seconds* me. go fucking get it. love sucking orange mans toes huh? Nice. seems like completely different metrics getting interchanged here. And, indeed, Colorado's hospitals (and Michigan's, Pennsylvania's, Florida's???) stress Oregon's.

I know lot hospital use old. hundreds people ventilators, number probably going quickly. It’s Google maps, it’s easy. plague happened scale massive part due horrible anti-hygiene practices time. Pretty sure Ibn Sina’s quarantine teachings hadn’t reached Europe know beginning sure. however take long update information longer recommend wearing outdoors away people.  socal started able walk last week. I’m one ones haven’t gotten yet. trouble scheduling around work cleared weekend get first shot. imagine others similar situations. great. Anyone link website dynamic regularly updated version it?

It gives far clear picture graphic [net total administered. 

It would also interesting see plotted number unvaccinated people too. I'm glad CDC states updating mask recommendations, I'll never shame anyone chooses keep wearing one outdoors. shame need find new hobby. Fucking idiots subreddit downvoting you. person downvoting comment sees this, want know stay home rest lives cause didn’t want get fucking shot normal people like going back live normal lives got shot. Sold Actually think decided wanted wear mask outdoors. want read CCP manual governing look 1984 George Orwell.

Who Tucker? I've fucking saying months. People really pissy tried use ""math"" prove vaccine rate would mean herd immunity early summer refused acknowledge many can't get vaccine year.

They thought 70% actual herd immunity rock bottom goal 🙄. supposed 90% higher possible. Ain't happening

Everyone cock sure daily dose rates would continue antivax / conservatives, 18s medical exceptions made 2% population heads 🤔 cheaper state throw cell duration pandemic pay damages later sue mostly used AstraZeneca. know article left piece information. makes sound like entire population vaccinated Sinopharm fact 30% got it.

90000 doses AstraZeneca 50000 doses Sinopharm. Bezos offering $5 amazon gift cards something. bet even $5 would get lot people interested. money referenced regarding purchase contract get dosage first. USA paid 2x higher fees regular vaccine price get vaccine anyone else. research development already invested Pfizer even Warp Speed. Dr. Amesh Adalja, infectious disease physician senior scholar Johns Hopkins University Center Health Security, said Pfizer, unlike smaller pharmaceutical companies government contracted with, need research money likely infrastructure early data needed speed vaccine trials without federal Dude cool ruining deal Nah playa already changed Trump. 

I also think, Covid Trump, generally 75% people fucking morons. Even family covidiots. think article left important fact majority Seychelles' population vaccinated Covishied, Indian version AstraZeneca.

90000 doses Covishied, 50000 doses Sinopharm It’s literally using US government patent owned NIAID developed UTexas 2 proline substitution stabilize spike, genetic sequence Austrailia, mRNA tech developed UPenn, Canadian lipid nanoparticle.

Once Pfizer got it’s hands it, became Moderna clone Moderna essentially US government partnered vaccine.

Germany doesn’t get much credit here, I’m sorry, Fuck everyone else though, right? Oh all? Easy! Bezos offer $5 amazon gift cards something. bet even $5 would get lot people interested. first goal mostly ramping supply one seems like trying convince holdouts seem interested bothering vaccine. 

I think availability appointments walk/drive clinics pretty much anywhere country. Anyone gotten vaccine yet free go get first dose tomorrow. 

I currently know single person needs wants vaccine able get appointment yet. know handful Trump voters refuse bother like 1 person fence getting bothered go yet. like page this. minute sources gives gist.

Deactivated virus vaccines well understood, safe low side effects. using full deactivated virus means (apparently) effective variants new 'targeted' vaccines, mRNA, spike protein etc. particular, touted excellent ""booster vaccine"", especially older people. 

Finally, stored normal refrigeration also manufactured widely (unlike mRNA vaccines example).

All good things. Yeah, I'm board that. People saying vaccine tested enough actually believe that.

BF got shot feels fine. Probably going downvoted saying this, reasons “unlikely” camp. want get vaccine, I’m curious anyone actually refute points:

Restrictions become moral question, easing restrictions seen evil restrictions good. Seeing people’s reactions people thread saying want restrictions eased proof that. There’s point getting vaccinated we’ll wear masks, attend online school, businesses shut down/otherwise crippled indefinitely.

The side effects, no, I’m talking fringe cases people dying, etc. trust enough I’m worried them. There’s time world feel like got hit electric streetcar upwards week. I’m college student, accommodations made people count immediate side effects highly depend professor. accommodations me.

Reduced availability J&amp;J freeze. originally intended take J&amp;J vaccine minimize effect previous point, freeze, became continues incredibly difficult area get.

Cost. simple one, likely negative financial repercussions getting it, i.e. pay it.

Lack positive incentive. college student, didn’t receive stimulus checks went earlier last year. might reason get incentive similar manner would actually receive, see movement that.

The effectiveness time per vaccine. I’ve heard estimates putting time effectiveness low 3-6 months, depending variant. Given factors, fact would take 4x year perpetuity makes sound futile gets.

Those big ones, don’t really see changing time soon, least area. Open new information/having mind changed. really see positives getting it, roadblocks gone, remains unlikely will. I'm sorry hear that. Hopefully fades soon. Pfizer said they're gonna apply 12-16 weeks 5-11 june. say.

That's mostly irrelevant discussion since talking hit herd immunity pandemic hope spread could limited, thus mutations/different strains, might possible eliminate vaccine (though even many experts expressed doubt could fully eliminated).

A large part this, though, due vaccine hesitancy. everyone world willing get vaccinated, could different story. Although animal reservoirs like ferrets (is ferrets little animal like that?) probably make impossible, we're trying limit spread crossover much possible. I'm pretty sure 70% pretty much requiring everyone wants vaccine gets one basically keeping fingers crossed. Yeah, no, even super libs aren’t that. That’s ridiculous.

I live Bay Area. It’s “rallying sign super libs” it’s fact city huge population people living top other.  may coincidence would one hell coincidence.

The big thing happened time J&amp;J supply tanked due factory screwup. could easily play least significant partial role. ""Stupid minds think aliker"" saw kids get wrapped blankets non-covid shots, damn. Brutal.

Would chair inflatable set cushions held arm maybe straps keep body place help? I'm thinking like blood pressure cuff thing, arm, held place wooden board. course small spot deltoid needle. Preventative healthcare one biggest money savers insurers. need weigh likelihood covid admission cost said admission boom, there’s money save paying vaccinate. It’s preventative healthcare almost always 100% covered. take care yourself, end hospital lot less. That’s breach human rights Put vacci tranq darts put bounty anti-vaxers. 


Reach herd immunity two weeks. it’s classified papers? 

Not mention, wrong National lab type research, lol.  it’s even common people think. Vietnam usually see people wearing masks motorbikes that’s sun air quality. Indoors bars stuff hardly ever see them. think 2016 election proved well. I'm seeing community. People already hesitant/scared get vaccine. Astra-Zenca released news clots caused stir. JnJ news released clots feel made lot people put completely. 

I friends curious getting shots they've starting ask process went. Hopefully get reach circles well help get shots arms. terrifying thought. provide information mine Philly Target. would great disease doesn’t stupid. great number vaccinated folks still suffer die spread disease least Don’t laminate card! I’m sure know 😅 refering to? honestly missed golden opportunity challenge America get 69% adults vaccinated. 

I swear alone would boost vaccination rates across board. Tie realID. use open api authenticate vaccination status department health. 

I know won’t work states block state level DOH sharing data federal government. it’s idea. Indian gocernment's entire covid response also less genocide. Doesn’t matter herd immunity know pneumonia complication Covid, right? 5,987,600th time, Covid flu. Yup. momentum shifted ""let's get done"" region race vaccine sites staff county one like mission.

I’ll still wear mine outside though, I’m going area lot passerby (which everywhere me.) It’s me, people too. 

It also comes risk. someone someone live extra high risk, wearing mask even vaccinated makes sense. Better cautious, wearing mask hurts one, take risk might get someone risk sick.

Maybe people extra cautious, tell point blank ist “a liberal thong!!11!!” lots people problem going maskless around vaccinated friends, long aren’t around strangers.

I'm sure there's people like  Yeah, this. stops HIV infections 99.5% time.

There's huge overlap groups people vulnerable covid, people medicare/medicaid people already vaccinated.

I hate divisive myth. Anti vaxxers historically left leaning, covid conspiracies tend right leaning much. Overall anti covid vaccine hesitancy whatever politically motivated

You mind though, consider political enemies. Europe open vaccinated travelers June. Latin America probably too, far ahead vaccinations. countries like Australia Taiwan well infection rates, open tourism anytime soon. best bet Europe.

I won’t speak countries Belgium schools never “engine”, multiple studies showed this. 
This meant sometimes schools close like society, infection rates got high. 
It could countries schools were/are “engine” epidemic depends, imo, health care, occupation rates (I seen American high schools jampacked hallways), rules (from government schools themselves),... mean, we’re already getting 69.420%. Brazil able gain 200 million vaccines Covid-19 per month

What afraid of? Idk meant general guy right  Smoking causes 500k deaths every year. hardly comparable.  Yes, there's giant chunk country that's stupid proud it, disagreement there. surprising. ""Herd immunity"" always seemed nebulous concept and, least, endgame meant returning normal infections/hospitalizations fell manageable level. Antivax idiots aside, I'm aware ever serious effort completely eradicate virus (and problem within US).  Good words live life general point AZ profit company, clearly aren't. 


It's they've signed contract Oxford Uni provide covid 19 vaccine cost. Banging drugs irrelevant.  probably referring possibility future booster variants keep immunity. One approved yet, eventually would probably roll one out. Alternative headline: Least Republican counties Alabama see highest COVID vaccination rates, Shelby real exception. many people know SARS-COV-1 Ebola? might localized outbreak present day, places infection rate zero. work towards Covid-19. meantime, sign  Woah. wild study out!! absurd, unrealistic, based science, cruel kids. say kids need wear masks distance times even outside playing socially distanced sports. also don’t allow sports kids come contact like soccer basketball (even masks), yet kids eat sleep rooms without masks. I’m hoping CDC comes senses makes rational especially accounting outdoor activities. 

Here’s good article NY Mag interview experts absurd rules are: [Summer Camp Rules ideas hit 70% 

As side note: ""70% adults"" unfortunately still close herd-immunity levels. We'd need something closer 100% adults someone finishes determining vaccines safe kids. Stop spouting nonsense. state opened vaccination general population 2 weeks ago. Isn’t usually case deaths lag considerably behind cases?

we've known while. 

we data showing negligible outdoors showing there's *any* risk whatsoever outdoors.   Oh yea. many people think exaggerated bit. expect roles probably reverse 2 months Europe hits 70% USA not, company want. Let toss name hat.

Just got 2nd. 

Let’s this. lot times it’s even education, it’s access time. lot people work multiple jobs don’t car. It’d useful go people are. mobile vaccine drive would useful. Don’t really understand allowed profit much given tax dollars research. Imagine stupid… enlightening, thank you. What’s like stupid? Seriously though… Must At&amp;t 5G ain't helping! /s Wife got yesterday. headache, wife nauseous. side effects rough, still better getting covid People keep saying got first shot I'd wanted get forever - I'd waiting city realized could go CVS. Eh. think reasonable scared COVID. There's gray area taking risks refusing vaccinations coughing people lol. vaccinated I'm super scared myself, children could still exposed since they're old enough infected yet, scared long it'll take go back normal. random debilitating disease killed Americans war! scary. 'rushed' safe anything else there

why need FDA approval begin then, potentially life-saving drugs &amp; vaccines spend years even decades limbo process took months guarantee safety? case over-zealous bureaucracy FDA process actual merit? Lol. Like continuously bugging people tends get exactly want to.

If anti-vaxers bugging would cause change mind? anyone stats AZ blood clot cases gender? seems like women likely get blood clot men. Omg seriously covidiots sub??? god takes getting people?! 500,000+ dead get it’s old decrepit people dying. time cases fall reopen better. really know much better be, really want bunch stupid people die, mainly stupid people family. Would love see Edinburgh Ben Nevis database crossed IRS.  It’s government, government already bought doses. government enabled clinics recoup costs doses administration via insured patients’ insurance companies. cost gets passed onto people via increased premiums therefore cost future care.

Interesting see you’re implicitly putting bar “when things return normal” though 100%. Glad see sub friendly helpful people questions concerns vaccination though! It’s mostly people leaning one direction politically. “both sides problem” is. true comes pandemic response. I'd love travel internationally again. miss it. COVID like flu way papercut like amputation. Same. It’s profoundly changed identity someone optimist liked people. difference people continue refuse vaccinated? mean, shut months different # % people vaccinated? Vaccines never 100% efficacious, none ones previously received either. especially true older people health conditions. 

The people vaccinated, less virus present daily life possibly overcome protection offered vaccines. 

Please go get shot. Set day two aside case bad reaction, it’s definitely worth currently blocking IP...The US government is... See comment 20 comments ago wouldn’t! Pennsylvania deaths per million = 2,065 Yawn. Billions dollars gov investment ignored. Many facilities able manufacture ignored. 

And ignorance flares brightly. Congrats! Make good vaccine ends pandemic, get paid.

How surprising newsworthy? now? Yes. forever, we're literally less half year vaccines available. 70% adults. It’s way less 70% total. think PA already like 63% god, you’ve cracked it! bet President didn’t even conduct basic lab science virus week! could possible know anything otherwise?

You ever heard term advisor? Hook one vaccination stimulus got deal decency keep yourself, freak people wear mask forever. stay shut significant % people refuse get vaccinated?? You’re trying real throw caution there. Thanks that. also thank careful around kids. one seems care can’t vaccinated. say vaccinated, mean fully vaccinated? type people refusing get vaccinated wearing masks anyways, much carrot there... bet folks who’ve gotten vaccine tell anti mask anti vax anti humanity friends haven’t. worth, tons college kids area (SoCal) line getting shots, went times mine. think numbers stand improve becomes widely available, campuses workplaces start require shot, full FDA approval. Hey guy need rewrite word salad becauseI couldn’t understand hell saying. 

It sounded like don’t wanna get shot people knew got usual side effects? Modi bad? like Trump levels covid incompetence. Nice! Welcome fully vaccinated club (well, technically week two build remaining immunity). Hopefully side effects pretty mild. got lucky pretty much tired light headache day after. Publix (grocery store) gives $10 gift cards people get flu vaccine. Hope roll something similar covid vaccine vaccine free, friend! took insurance card pharmacy get mine last week didn’t even ask see it. find 30 minutes somewhere go get :)  Got moderna, sure well testing variants.  slight headache, slight fever fatique like less 24 hours total probably. Back 100% 36 hours id say exactly hospital, clinic, government station going ‘pass costs you’ way tax dollars (that already funding doses immunization sites, kind pointless refuse now)? 

You know what’s going cost rest us? Continued lockdowns restrictions we’re still getting high caseloads people like won’t get vaccinated don’t want chance flu symptoms days. Grow adult.  Absolutely, there’s indication situation regarding appointments changed mediums advertised appointments first place There's term work things barely within required metric like this, next week could become bad enough problem: ""in control limits.""

But now, COVID Oregon *ahem* control. Like covid. garage door open? 4 bigger 3. I’ll die hill. Far, far worse stubbing toe. Phizfer shot joke. Thanks stat. Maybe help stat. percent infections lead death? Asking friend. american!! 2020 also year convinced need sort regulatory agency hold fake misleading news accountable.

I can't even remember many times I've seen articles either outright dismissing danger covid fudging numbers make look like sky constantly falling.

Hell, latter happened week idiotic ""we reach herd immunity"" articles burried essentially mean virus continue circulate low fatalities essentially mean completely get rid virus.

Combine crap like asshats like Fox saying dangerous vaccines control find sensationalist scary headline point view, reality much less interesting panic inducing. “Indoors,even vaccinated masks still required”

Sounds like never go away. never normal again.  It’s good thing COVID like flu polio then. Flu shot following DTP, polio, MMR, hepatitis B, MenACWY, Varicella. Michigan since varies state likely required states. Requiring vaccine attend school new concept. around while.  need clinics later times. Latest I’ve seen 6pm around here, doesn’t work lot people. Gimme pre-pandemic Walmart hours  public? “experts” haven’t done well, dude. **[Freedom Boner intensifies]** I’ve actually seen least one team (Seattle Mariners think?) offering vaccine games. Every little bit helps?  vaccine toxicity Rocket League, cause need immunity in!

Seriously though got first Moderna shot morning. Guess Contagion underdramatic! Good song, [what came You’re right. Edited  Wait till nut-case gets covid himself. He'll trying jump queues get hospital get treated it. 

""What idiot!"" (in Hermione Granger's voice) coworker freaked told totally willing get J&amp;J shot. (When still available) asked birth control risk blood clots higher.     went certainly die covid (breathing issues) probably die covid.

The side effects enjoyable suffering associated made feel alive good. job approving completely closes option actually gifting pfizer vaccines. mean? get 70 percent vaccinated mid summer, absolutely fantastic. expect anything less, competent American administration. United States normal country, world's superpower. benefits American citizen, cons. absolutely terrible containing virus, excelling vaccination. accomplish it’s already banned several states come? LoL yeah sorry, Fun police here. Why?  It’s almost like.... people outside expertise... listen experts. 

But noooooooo public trusts dumb Facebook share people like Fauci who’s public health longer I’ve alive.

My mother( scientist!) expressed concern shouldn’t get vaccinated since I’m trying get pregnant one friends saw Facebook. long chat that. also plenty people came covid recently waiting get vaccine. Many people come covid doses. I'm seeing incentives free doughnuts, free beer, coupons, needed ""A shot available. eligible."" Freaking holdouts getting nice swag jeopardizing people's health lives now.

In words, where's free swag?  it’s right private businesses events tell shove off. Funny works. Watch TV thing could do. wide awake move. entire body felt like burning. also tried walk legs gave out. laying like hours (which seemed like lot longer) crawled couch watch Back Future. 2nd shot Wednesday started feeling slightly better 24 hours really took Sunday. city giving raffle nfl tickets. sign up? Easy theory. points another post right replied yours: would legislative procedure since taxation, zero way gets passed unless reconciliation, couple left.

My therapist told exposure therapy also helpful needle fears. 

She told start looking pictures cartoon needles, cartoon shots given. 
Then looking drawings needles, photos real needles, photos someone getting shot, next cartoon video shot given, way watching videos people receiving shots vaccines. 

You go pace document feelings little paraphrases go along. 

It incredible help! Oh numbing cream theyre going inject super helpful! 

Good luck dont afraid reach resources others comment well! 

You this! helps, hero cant get shot! Keep us updated!!! probably would taken longer get email get dentist. Yeah that's silly. reason wear mask bike putting get near someone kind inconvenient, I'm nowhere near anybody breath yeah, sorry, I'm wearing outside.  Yeah, said second last. means 25 BILLION Americans ages 18-49 would needed infected covid order risk death covid risk blood clots (NOT death) j&amp;j vaccine.

Kind seems like meant say would take 25 billion vaccinations equate 25,000 deaths seen far. people good assessing risk, Las Vegas exist. US raw reported metrics

via Almost 57% adults least one shot. needs another 13%. Totally doable. There’s lot people SF. outdoor transmission low risk, you’re passing dozen people every minute, wear mask, there’s still chance. can’t socially distance well you’re passing people. pissed kid diagnosed vaccinated. Thankfully tests came next day that. moved area large religious group refused vaccine. yeah miami first thought desantis' political stunt banning mask restrictions even local level

i understand loosening restrictions state level letting local municipalities set rules, straight telling city cant restrictions borderline criminal. Pretty sure that's allowed ACA. say late all, recent anyone state, 16 could get vaccinated. available everywhere absolutely exported. U.S prioritized vaccine development production, makes sense would get situation control first. Follow money 99% recovery rate, need better incentive. ones havent gotten sick yet probably wont, do, ventilator sick. Biden Fauci telling people wear mask regardless vaccine makes people want it. first thought occupations like physical therapy, etc, normally happening outside. Yeah that’s what’s happening school- across street neighbor aide cafeteria. It’s pretty strictly enforced, given 15 minutes eat outdoors recess masks stay unless one painted circles red top. hear, kids compliant now, enforced.

This k-5 school. idea what’s going older kids. going based told me. Honestly could completely misunderstood waiver, also back January, may changed well. remember really pissed waiver. got wife vaccinated local programs going wait change policy full FDA approval himself. Sounds like worst worlds talking lot. clear, even elementary school level. drop kids morning 3 4 kids wearing masks. I've seen get dropped past, without getting political, bumper stickers exactly expect.

It would shameful anywhere, generally well educated northeastern state. Embarrassing. made comment stupid yours. 

The covid vaccine biologic product I’m Seattle literally thousands appointments open per day STILL see people say it’s impossible find appointment. think people don’t realize broaden searches. employers start mandating it. military, healthcare, education requiring huge step toward herd immunity. think industries, especially service based, follow. First probably incentives, new hire requirement, strict policy rolled senior staff.  current vaccine protect us nasty strains.

And variants might cause illness people fully vaccinated.

Are very, different statements.

Reasonable accommodations used situations. Hey least little neat resistant anthrax? Free ice cream get vaccine.

Either way odds vaccine worst case way better odds covid regardless age. Yup, get vaxx, ice cream pot one place. I've seen slightly less optimistic things published too, let's assume purposes discussion that's least reasonable ballpark estimate, variants change things much near term. So, circumstances unvaccinated self would caught covid, instead 5% chance asymptomatic case, 5% chance symptomatic. That's bad all, enough vaccinated people know think it, since take much (being outside, masking decent ventilation) improve odds lot more. could order less F-35s aircraft carriers.

Problem available  


I dunno, despite production delays AZ provided around 300 million first billion doses produced, I'd say bad, particularly given many doses administered poorer countries. Besides UK we've close 25 million doses stuff, bit behind schedule bulk work, certainly Pfizer Moderna anyone else. 


I know they've issues EU, EU world. terms poorer parts world AZ vaccine delivered scale COVAX 30+ million doses already delivered, think anyone else comes close.  That's one myths floating British press. Actually German Merck American MSD Oxford wanted cooperate.  


Regardless endless threats we've continent AZ announced delays EU I'm glad UK production UK blocked increasingly vaccine nationalistic EU. think would've gone differently UK Oxford vaccine production.

The university hosting big vaccine drive last day finals thursday, lot others gettimg first dose sounds like “you’re likely die mundane everyday thing” situation. You’re fine That's wrong variant gets around vaccine say two mRna ones  Unfortunately, way around seems best. survive infection unvaccinated unscathed.    thinking vaccine prevent COVID? Moderna pfiZer sit 90% efficacy, goes long way protecting innoculated, transmission, starting see data suggests transmission greatly reduced. reason never ""guaranteed"" Moderna Pfizer time track working get vaccines ready (they focused safety protective efficacy) 

The vaccines ideally stop getting covid, greatly reduce chances getting ill. maskless another person COVID, vaccine work reduce likelihood infection. Vaccines thus work preventively manner reducing severity.

And people it, chain transmission interrupted population, huge helping reduce proliferation variants.

You correct mutations inevitable, faster immunize population, likely reduce chances dangerous vaccine resistant mutations developing spreading. read new osha rules coming soon. Previous admin made workplace safety suggestions..but official rules workplace safety covid .

But, whatever. I’m vaccinated. Idc virus anymore People got infected also get shot. experts saying 70% almost certainly took account estimated people already sick(And estimating many also got shot).

""Imagine highly contagious virus circulating community. Many infected children fever general misery recover without incident. Rarely, devastating complications occur, leading hospitalization, severe illness, occasional deaths. Susceptible adults fare worse, higher rates poor outcomes. Would want child vaccinated disease?

Very little getting people rushing door get one political/social divide US (and near 50/50) split somewhat unique. Sadly also spills every aspect life now. ""politics"", way life. thankful deal that. US split rural cities

In terms spreading virus, much top level poster saying.

Look influenza second. Even places would say ""They think COVID real, anything,"" influenza gone. Why? still pretty closely tied cities.

Diseases move pretty far wide. Even midst biggest slow international travel we've seen since World War, we're still seeing variants traveling across world relatively short order. things move around truly hit herd immunity, see cases slow crawl outbreaks, even rural areas newsworthy.

I mean, think rural MIL. Lives ""town"" 8 people. Where'd get COVID from? relative visiting Albuquerque. Sure, anecdote, say ""there pockets US pandemic continues kill"" think forgetting pockets still need seeded cases.

One also needs consider R0 constant cities rural areas. higher rate vaccinations cities may actually better strangling thing out. might need 55% vacciantions (alongside natural immunity) hit herd immunity Salina, UT whereas Manhattan might need 88% 92%.


Back ""seeding cases"" thing. Many really rural areas, like city live thing constantly swirling. That's part reason COVID denial kicked up. country started locking down, seen cases. Part lack testing, still good long found way areas businesses hemorrhaging cash see anyone dying. Well pops kills 12 people nursing home town over, contain one's getting sick awhile someone else three towns caught sister lives city brings local diner.

We currently experiencing 1 case every 6000 people per day. community 500 people? might seeing case month. sure, chains asymptomatic people could causing spread communities, likely coming outside community.

If hit 80%+ range vaccines, we'd really start see 1 X number rise. Cases would plummet we'd place might 1 every 20,000 **per week.** Well, we're point, hard make argument circulating around Salina, UT surrounding rural communities rather coming somewhere else. Yes. Efficacy ≠ Effectivity Ewwwwww 80% Canadians live within 200km (160 miles) US border. A.) vaccine development years coronaviruses, pharmaceutical companies huge head start.

3. everyone vaccinated, due medical reasons Vaccines, historically, require efficacy 50-60% (ball park), this, theory lower effective R0 value less 1, thus causing deflationary infection rate. early picture suggesting rate rising relative pre-vaccination rates. Make sense?

I think viral pressures control, season, population density, baseline population health, population age distribution etc, previous herd immunity..

Here's question: notion herd immunity, individuals immunity key stopping spread disease high transmission R value, suggests ought prevent spread situations either allow unvaccinated people all, (more realistically) set seating guidelines distribute seats unvaccinated among seats vaccinated.

I mean, idea open stadium seating feel confident spread disease minimized, also follow use vaccinated attendees buffer unvaccinated attendees?

Of course, outdoor stadiums/arenas, there's going little COVID-19 transmission begin with. even indoor settings, volume air facility large it'll take COVID-19 aerosols accumulate anyway. isolate concentrate vaccinated people away unvaccinated people? seem align idea goal reduce spread. need way notify mods inaccurate flairs.

That's actually really good idea. doubt that’s it. US abundant intel sources India events large. likely decades long aversion US “footprint” India blame.

Need go look works... information I've seen indicates likely going happen next days US. sad thing like can't - wealthy, excellent health system, good infrastructure - refused so. There's definitely minimum timeframe, FDA says takes 6 months go process even expedite it.

I've looking weekly since January anything suggests shorten timeframe, found anything yet.

So assume FDA approval first vaccine happen Oct-Dec 2021. would US disaster relief turn permanent? Explain? Indian government would allowed signed US continual presence. said India never sanctioned US base soil, would US stay? India could tell US day week landing, services longer needed please leave, US would country asap.

Little less drop last week previous two days. Hopefully trend continues. (~50% drop last 2 weeks, ""only"" ~30% today) really hope make 70% adults vaccinated. Currently 56.7% least one dose. I’m hopeful would NICE Ok damages pretty much organs... great..  What’s holding efforts? I'm thinking Fourth Wave USA. hit unvaccinated; possibly cause numerous ""breakthru"" cases. sure when, suspect least June. Despite slowdown recent weeks, distribution administered vaccinations done American population nothing short amazing. Glad hear course correct. point lack eligibility mean side criteria vaccine. smaller number. ask booked got summoning? got invite I'm keen book second there's anyway Scotland.  TIL NYC variant. come? mean, wholeheartedly agree, referring here? Throw voter registration polling station watch world explode. Yes agree that.

Dude trying say ""okay vulnerable get vaccine"" he's terrified vaccines flat earther.

Here's moron committee understand.

The point herd immunity make virus EXTINCT. 2 week lifespan pretty much whereby must find UNVAXXED DINGUS jump order survive. Sure, vaxxed person get it, like &lt;5% shorter duration. 5% 5% = 0.25% spreading two random vaxxed people unvaxed spread rate.

Goal: make virus EXTINCT. requires somewhere 60-90% vaccination, know exactly figure.

Alternative? Virus continues spreading --- indefinitely --- among UNVAXXED DINGUSES.

A year road --- thing still killing people, way ... maybe mutation emerges vaccines work -- all.

Lol. Get vaccinated idiots. That's I'm saying. India. skimmed article. Offer cash take  Good. coworkers ""freedoms"" include freedom expose contagious disease. Indian version AZ, different normal AZ    economic illiteracy sub quite astounding. think looking daily cases, whereas said weekly. Worldometers says USA 399,857 cases past 7 days. Happy you! Congrats facing fear getting vaccinated :) Why? Covid care are. agree. California set date June 15th ""fully re-open"", though still safety precautions ostensibly place. already seen, June 15th California also significantly higher vaccinated number people then, deaths cases already super low. on-going pressure really ease protocols. Well sort of. I'm college, can't speak actual children people 18, think fact young people care coronavirus terms disease. There's much indifference vaccine amongst young people actual anti-vax mindset Move Olympics London! still facilities help economic recovery Yeah.... Trump claimed well.... usually teams world including China India. always fascinated reading people climb Everest get either. would want something miserable deadly? defies logic point extremely irresponsible selfish (even non pandemic years). mean 50k per 7 days. Rn hovering around summer 2020 levels. However, think it'll really drop next months I'm sorry India's gotta speed things man, havent vaccinated day last week, arent exporting SII AZ doses since couple weeks ago. True. US will. hand -- since way likely hear side effects -- really create biased picture likely are

Exactly. like product reviews Amazon restaurant reviews Yelp, people likely voice opinion problem.

So, sake one people, side effects Pfizer doses sore arm, even bad. Houston would thought electing authoritarian, corrupt politician highest office land could actual disastrous consequences??

^(America entered chat...) Everybody knows US ""help"" always comes catch. judge it. “it’s altitude sickness” new “it’s allergies”? Bud, it’s even India article. It’s Canada. You’re bad antivaxxer point rejecting reality same. Current regulations VN quarantine applies arriving abroad, mandatory testings, except diplomats, required medical attest negative virus anyway. Vaccination yet wide spread enough consideration, mention new virus variants putting question. Entry accepted reasons, list limited, like citizens coming home, foreign specialists, diplomats, amongst others. Tourists allowed in. Nobody ever said optimistic scenarios considered, end July new weekly national cases could drop 50,000

I'm confused this. currently 49,396 according worldometers.info us?

We back June 1st home opener! I’m looking forward discounts health insurance life insurance policies. Interesting. bought (used) car last year wouldn’t known! heard chip shortage didn’t think would impact used car prices. tell vaccines completed regular testing process (phase 1-3 trials including trials humans) they’ve fda reviewed emergency use full approval within weeks many countries fully approved already (Canada) Pfizer vaccine actually approved 85 countries world wide fda reviewed emergency use reviewed safety efficacy info curious entails there’s info assure mRNA technology gene editing/ DNA editing technology - delivers recipe antibodies cleared system - there’s info helpful quote COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines
They cannot give someone COVID-19.

mRNA vaccines use live virus causes COVID-19.
They affect interact DNA way.

Finally advise serious long term effects reported covid patients even symptoms, COVID seeming vascular nature addition normal things we’ve heard, cause blood clots, strokes, aneurysms brain damage. 

That balance risks known covid vs risks known vaccines it’s like asked want take chances hit car getting punched arm.

Notes:

* Texas (about 9% US population) excluded CDC demographic data, tables match national totals.
* CDC reports vaccinations 0-17 age group. 16-17 age group calculated using 2019 Census estimates 11.4% aged 0 17 ages 16 17, assuming 0-17 age group doses given ages 16 17.  can’t say sure it’s possibly bc huge hospital systems portland, including well known research hospitals. may better capacity general mean US won’t sending vaccine supplies India requested public pressure? Sure sounds like India wants handle people horrible basic preventative care comes healthcare. amazed adults go dentist eye doctor years time. sure I'd say hard buy yet - though many new dealers really inventory shortages. global microchip shortage whatever want call hitting cars hard. Many manufacturers even shutting lines idling plants lack components.

But used car prices skyrocketing reaction - especially valuation trade-in. Dealers scrambling keep inventory lots paying top dollar them. car gone thousands value past months based online quotes I've seeing. there's anything I'd bother trading selling now, good time sell planning getting something else. Same...  lab test. latesr development - stepson daughter law foster parents. 2 month old infant held last Monday er sick. Tested neg. too. Tested neg. infant er today high fever dxed random virus, dr thinks picked him.

Other baby one hit hard this. dr says can't 2nd shot fevers stop. uncomfortable unhappy.  cannot remember last time fever, let alone one high 103.5 F. kind surreal sick covid.  think there’s huge problem everyone making poor assumptions intentions others. People masks assumed angry mask scolds, anyone walks door bare face assumed reckless COVID denier. reality simple.

With US rapidly approaching tipping point, things could become objectively safe soon. itching live life, think fear cautious among us yell, scream, wag fingers ready move even things objectively “safe”. ready move confident cautious won’t react angrily try hold everyone else back doubt would much conversation. Well we’re close 100% still need wear mask lol article says they're J&amp;J shots stadiums read article? There's lot aid accepted. headline bit misleading.   Many students said want one parents won’t let them. encourage parents talk pediatrician. One getting first shot! India wishes could defeated virus quickly efficiently China did. hell talking about? I’m going say think squirting propolis nose throat constantly helped evade virus. wearing three masks. get infuriated every time read post like this, world hellhole long COVID. magically get way? No! happens history--*real* history--is taught schools.

In regards public health crisis, like one remembers AIDS pandemic! yeah, contagious COVID, AIDS hit home lot people highly epidemic West Western governments do? Hid heads sand pretended nothing happening. US particular, history even flat circle here, got another major health crisis happening Republican president office expect things magically better time?

I expected people know better, know history, know bothered. transplant recipients elderly whose lives literally saved wearing masks crowded spaces flu season. delighted mandates go away, destigmatizing mask wearing potential long term health benefit pandemic. months pointless meetings two week breaks meetings, wait September. 


someone explain dialing dosages proven vaccine takes 6 months? I’ll honest. I’ve voted past. handling/wishy washiness covid looking candidates time comes. might really hard do. think 70% theoretical maximum number adults US want vaccinated. aid work voluntourism bullshit probably saved time life It’s called Westbrook variant NBA hates it. Modi wildly popular democratically elected time. understand relief beginning sure jobs coming back, unemployment money stimulus checks people excuse

Property owners can’t expected provide free housing indefinitely. system isn’t set way even close cars hard buy? It’s also impossible catch COVID full vaccination die. all, happened once....out millions shots given. is, like study, statistically insignificant. term goal abolish rent.

I wish started comment waste time reading it. One friends 4’11 100lbs adult. That’s size average 12 year old. Covid vaccines wouldn’t every vaccine?

Exactly. Big biotech companies slow research solutions problems developing world - like Ebola, malaria, sleeping sickness, etc. - know even develop solution, they'd intense pressure give away free eat costs. going make problem worse. think people need ease back things.

My first post-vaccination indoor dining experience local restaurant 3 pm weekday, happy hour bar Friday night, started vaccinated friends house small groups. California case rate positivity rates allowed higher depending number higher-risk people vaccinated (higher risk defined ""HPI Quartile 1 residents"" - CA broken apart every census tract 4 buckets, 1 = highest propensity negative health outcomes 4 = lowest; based things like income, access health care, education level - HPI ""Healthy Places Index""). 

The guardrails required hit various reopening tiers changed residents HPI quartile 1 vaccinated. loosened 2 million loosened 4 million. Yes, Curevac good source producing mRNA-vaccines. US blocking export much needed materials. lot countries talking export ban, need sleeping rock missed it. feel like I'm aware people would get vaccine doctor's office (either one children) MD like ""hey, see vaccinated yet, one technicians come room minutes give vaccine"" 

but barriers/disinterest making separate appointment big compared level interest. Well they're getting inoculated one way other... risk done vaccination even tears population hospitals fine, least OK.  incentive biotech companies develop solutions problems plague developing world, know actually develop solution there's chance given away free they'll stuck bill.

As much pharma would want believe that, true. Patents actually stifle innovation research, profitable drug need sit eternal patent tiny pointless modifications formula keep harvesting cash forever. called [me-too reason pharma spends way marketing R&amp;D: offer shit need damn good sales pitch justify charging even it, friends with?

Yeah, Curevac, German version AZ. Lofty company weird CEO breakdown last year, lost memory thought kidnapped Russians. Best source... Yes, worry. Pfizer much trouble trying fix plants inherited Hospira acquisition, would much doubt extremely tiny company never made vaccines single facility meant make chemo drugs. analysis *from* 2 weeks period extends 2 months.

Take vaccination card case need see shot got. Well fast. AC... sends signal intellectual property get thrown window soon politicians find inconvenient - particularly tear-jerk-y case involving developing country. *less* incentive biotech companies develop solutions problems plague developing world, know actually develop solution there's chance given away free they'll stuck bill.

It also hurts biotech companies countries question. running biotech company South Africa India see government pushing override IP protection foreign company, know short hop overriding IP domestic companies. Anyone looking get biotech running going move U.S. EU know they'll get least protection intellectual property.

If pharmaceutical companies literally hoarding IP, refusing anyone use it, would argument breaking IP. aren't. want get paid developing it.

And that's simple solution this: pay it. U.S. believes India South Africa's line desperately impoverished can't afford pay vaccinations people (say, massively expensive stadiums built countries public funds? wondering), U.S. government pay gift. breaking intellectual property system save bit cash bad precedent. funny cite HIV every public health expert agrees strong IP patent enforcement 90s made things much, much worse, terms death total number infections. drug companies forced various state-backed initiatives bottom-up protest movements allow manufacture generic biosimilar treatments started get handle things. live SoCal met maybe two people ""eh really need vaccine young healthy"" yet meet ""not getting vaccine/it's hox/microchip"" folks - complaining. Even avid watchers Fox News family immediately jumped get vaccine asap.  think actually supports argument J&amp;J AstraZenecca make mistakes, adding complexity outsourcing production problematic. also understand facilities produce vaccines exist unused there’s profit capitalistic motivation closed ecosystem IP ownership right costing us time constantly mutating threat. find super interesting helpful, particularly distribution unvaccinated across age groups. me, tells different story (or maybe complicated story) state rates, encourage people kind throw hands say ""well can't help people [for political reasons] want get vaccinated!"" certainly appears elderly population getting vaccinated high rates across country (because make tiny percentage unvaccinated), there's lot room improving vaccination rates focusing 18-29 age group expanding vaccine approval younger ages. 

I think way much table reddit comment I'd interested know whether age-based patterns look similar low-vaccine-rate states (e.g., southeast United States) versus high-vaccine-rate states (e.g., Northeast). 18-29 year old group makes high proportion unvaxxed states, suggests may political persuasion barrier, rather something may surmountable - e.g., need make easier convenient get vaxxed incentivize group perceives low risk disease. No, won't. Vaccinations taking care this. need worry. Yeah misunderstanding people mean say ""supply issue"". Low supply mean enough houses built, also mean enough houses sale. 

Think diamond prices example. demand high low supply diamonds, mean enough diamonds since know companies hoarding diamonds keep supply low maintain high prices. 

You misunderstanding difference word supply term supply market meme there's shortage houses incorrect.

There shortage houses market, yes. shortage houses exist. they're incentivized use houses housing, aren't.

Yeah one proposed solution supply issue tax empty houses, incentivize renting selling. licensing production vaccines seem problem all. seems like sourcing personnel, equipment, materials key ingredients much larger issue. Setting vaccine lines takes months immediately think going see little effect waiver. 

With said, important message give fighting covid important financial gains, options needs table. CDC seems touch reality.

I know really related. phasing made think CDC said [All women childbearing age avoid alcohol unless using birth 

It unrealistic frankly way extreme controlling (well, guess restrictive controlling, since attempt goal enforcement know). creepy way - women live lives according what's healthiest children could potentially/theoretically conceive, intention conceiving. completely favor birth control available, common methods women involve hormones potential side effects. quality even potential vessels babies apparently important thing.

I rather agree certain aspects recommend vaccinated behave, BTW.  concerns maintaining consistent quality control product one third party fucking batch doesn’t cause entire population distrust whole vaccine valid worry.

Big countries still reward companies maximum impact(ones immunize most). Luckily, country, Spain, many anti-vaxxers. agree. orders corporate to, though. think we've handled vaccine distribution pretty poorly. redirecting doses places like Indiana (where live) areas vaccine demand actually there. also disgusting US government forced removal patent protections vaccine.

Yet see medical breakthroughs research fields (minus patents). Oooo Bill Gates gonna angy that. Fortunately world leaders realize mother nature doesnt give rat's ass billionaires money *help countries give need make vaccines deal global pandemic* controversial take know. Good you! Stay safe. sure tbh. Could something america exclusive contract Pfizer (?). But, hopefully, new vaccines coming developement, could used get people vaccinated throughout europe, also africa.

Astrazeneca cheaper vaccine. Europe poured resources it. Got burnt, due company cherrypicking good information leaving crucial data lol Won’t somebody think shareholders /s Yes, year ago, like trying C-TAP, undermined Gates foundation pharma companies. Places like India would much better today now.

Even enough doses world (which still speculative point dependent lot logistics successes), need global production place combat inevitable variants emerge escape vaccines. current system got us vaccine incredibly short period time. I'm open alternatives anyone else, ""OK worked great let's dismantle India's government want pay it"" compelling argument. Affirming tech infrastructure producing vaccines within reach developing nations false. 

There examples disprove this. 

Source: Good question. know two people who’ve done honestly, think eradicate covid like US. states close, ""alternate""-leaning regions able convince majority residents take shot. virus continue cause mini-surges areas next couple yrs burns out. I'm hoping year we'll advanced therapies allow patients recover quicker tax hospital resources.  Given lot work based backbone publicly funded research R&amp;D cut every year private industry hard time giving credence this. Pfizer make shitlosd money regardless others get marketplace now. Slippery slope arguments stupid. global health crisis worrying future profitability highly profitable companies worrying expanding manufacturing capabilities wrong priorities. reason believe type waiver used issues given generation global pandemic. Yeah...no....me kids GET (SO CALLED) VACCINE got two hours sleep last night like body fucking wired. is. They're fine. Stop falling misinformation.   Pfizer nothing earn next year new facilities ready? many first shots today? relevant all? rumor Chicago going keep mandate year *at least*, best case scenario it'll get repealed May 2022, worst case 2023. large portion medicines vaccines already produced non-so-called first world countries. eviction ban hold.

That would nearly successful might think. would happen small mom-and-pop landlords would go buildings would repossessed bank and/or auctioned unpaid property taxes. buildings would bought cheap deep-pocketed hedge fund investors waiting opportunity. sell properties big landlords, financial stability weather downturn. think happen rents rental housing becomes owned mega corps? go look votes Judges, judge one unanimous judges trump put 4 years. Gotcha! sure helps experience people’s opinions vacc. 

Most people know age range (mid thirties) basically like get local pharmacy it. soon happened got shots. know people vaccinated age group flip flopped last two weeks. noticed since vaccine available folks much older 55+ ones would drive way wait lines clinics like ones work for. 

I yet run anybody fully 100% getting vaccine social group. Except maybe niece afraid needles lol 

Good luck thanks helping get vaccines rolled out! Brazil recently threatening introduce law allowing Brazilian companies ignore intellectual property rules wrt vaccines.

This might case US government pharma companies accepting inevitable. think depends vaccination rates county. certain ""alternate"" persuasion regions majority residents opting out, case numbers stay plateau covid becomes endemic natural immunity takes hold (like flu strains). reality hospitals health clinics areas plan mini-surges next couple years covid burns like SARS MERS did. hope forgive cynicism, think point anyone sit serious cost-benefit analysis anything last year.

Research already hard enough don’t need added possibility government taking away product finally make breakthrough. Subsidize want make available others don’t remove intellectual rights unmotivating thing world Haha, I’m one them! (Didn’t come vaccine, still) absolutely repeat mistakes people claim real reason can’t ramp production purely supplies issue incompetence foreign countries. need western companies work countries help bring new manufacturing facilities online help growing pains. seems unlikely given hard fought even stop first step expanding vaccine production. people subreddit blindly repeat main issue supply logistics. thing opening processes lead new developments new supply chains wouldn’t previously existed. We’ve seen every level production. enough dry ice Pfizer starts producing themselves. manufacturing vaccines inventive solutions sourcing supplies we’ll see. saying believe official source claim? thought many visas get NIE many people able fly USA spent last 14 days Europe/UK/Brazil/India etc. covid test required flying domestically. leave US get back country need negative covid test within 72 hours flight home.

Pharmaceutical companies somewhat different position, cases drugs can't easily substituted, there's occasionally opportunity raising prices ridiculous levels. we're seeing vaccines, necessarily case. cases, whether pain medications vaccine, there's enough competition different products locked one can't charge absurd prices.

But seems expectation anybody connected healthcare willing work free kindness hearts, extend anyone else. problems pricing healthcare products, fix problems. expecting get free need solution, massively disincentivize anyone work. tired wearing masks? like fun things? course do. want live lives again. need get covid vaccine. Long tem side effects include lower stress, better sleep, increased happiness. also completley free. Get covid vaccine today. Get vaccinated enjoy life. Ah yes come technology did!! Take third world!! get keep let hundreds thousands people die, victory! 115,000 cases lot cases... joking? agree you. pandemic said done, go back EXACTLY before.

Could greater Republican death rates swing vote enough points change outcome Democrat candidate?  switched arms. mainly initially sore first hesitant needle stuck there.

Didn’t help though. second one whatever reason hurt lot injection. 

I joke microchips can’t sync up. downside would Israel near level race-based data FDA would need. normal indoor masking gone.

And yes know probably dead last. suppose 'relatively normal' caveat could lot businesses could still restrictions volition well people still choosing wear masks hesitant.

And number clubs/bars 2019 closed able reopen due financial issues :( health service Ireland nearly collapsed last wave. government cautious reopening. Dutch vaccine speeds going moon again, planned 830k week. 20 days, break eight million. Tomorrow stradle six million mark.

Smart people capable coming rationale dumb things. 

Taubman never outlined details focus group, dug hard statistics. feel like anecdote then.  1/3 cases fully vacinated though used mostly AZ sinopham. I'm guessing related VoC seems breakthrough non mRna vaccines way easier

I wonder they'll provide breakdown vaccines infected kids risk getting it, illness experience COVID mostly mild symptom-less. children COVID-19 mild symptoms symptoms all.

This probably #1 factor parents choosing vaccinate kids. need see higher risk. 

You also articles say kids drive household spread. Like not, two pieces information going hurdles getting kids study Clinical Infectious Diseases yesterday shows children unlikely source COVID-19 household outbreaks less likely infected SARS-CoV-2 another household member, implications vaccine distribution.

He vaccinates flu, COVID. guy's behavior kind line conclusion study. prioritising vaccination [of] children influenza proved effective tool reducing spread influenza virus community, data suggest similar strategy would unlikely significantly decrease household transmission SARS-CoV-2, authors concluded. cases less 10,000, get rid mask mandates. thing happened me. ran fever 100 degrees, muscle aches everywhere fatigue 9 hours. randomly stopped 100% back normal. Almost like someone flipped switch. incorrect. Broadway open starting May 19, capacity restrictions lifted social distancing requirements. Shows open *full capacity* September. think poster asking slightly different question though. asking whether vaccine efficacy binary (basically: 100% efficacious 82% people, people, 0% remaining 18%), efficacy 82% everyone gets vaccine.

I think answer probably somewhere middle. vaccine efficacious people less others (depending e.g. age weak immune system). trials set correctly, trial population somewhat representative general population. say vaccine 82% efficacy, averaged young old, male female, different ethnicities, etc. throw someone lake float, might covid. sink drown, covid-free, eventually. need proof residence get vaccine there. fully vaccinated people another state can't come get free tickets.   Read fourth paragraph. says right social distancing would still apply. know getting votes.  That’s likely reason Japan escaped disaster, despite old population. gather, Japan expensive elderly long term care system, developed countries primary source death long term care homes (which often neglected underfunded)  us instance US troops came immediate humanitarian assistance refused leave requested.

that's tad specific. cant name ""for immediate humanitarian assistance"" aware assistance given.

I however name numerous instances, named two one parent comments, US established permanent foothold military bases - key point - presence bases actively harmed local ecosystems.

to flog dead horse one time - insistence presence American military cause concern. especially country giving aid insists army allowed Indian soil. historians also really pushing away calling Middle East, “the Middle East”, instead push “West Asia” “Southwest Asia”.

cool. ""Middle East"" obviously Euro-centric term. Pretty severe failure Sinopharm. Hopefully least minor cases H1N1 game 1? biggest barrier production would require real global cooperation companies putting profits behind public health unfortunately seems unlikely. know what’s weak? India’s leaders pretending got literally everyone see don’t. fact don’t putting everyone else Earth risk. thoughts people live India don’t control what’s happening. got 2nd Saturday feel 100% right morning. much worth it, though.  shows need get ready go produced rehearsed etc. Earliest they'd ready anyway like July insane rehearsal schedule.  friend going travel India kind humanitarian volunteer work country (not like Christian missionary work, like actual aid work without proselytizing), visa approval denied grounds India need anybody's help. cleared months life stuff quit job it. chance dying getting critically ill changed significantly. 

I get though. think conservative. Vaccinated people encouraged lead somewhat normal lives. totally normal, still vast majority kids cannot get vaccinated yet.  seems like provinces Canada following well, Saskatchewan announced 3 tiered system far we're going reopen based vaccination rates.  


In 2 weeks restaurants businesses open up, roughly 6 weeks restrictions lifted, they're shooting July talk masks. 


We're actually pretty decently far vaccination goes, although we're giving 1 shot population everybody vaccinated/supply increases - got Pfizer today. read maximum 6 months high-priority vaccine, I'm obviously expert. approve mean states open appointments asap? process? thought too, initially, irritated me. thought…what vendor going intentionally fill seats accommodate subset people making silly choice? want fill seats, right? Best way vaccinated sections.  fault talking Vietnam hear climbing great sport etc there's need go Everest climb spots. go place there's good chance could die someone would need rescue well mention chance getting COVID-19 Yeah, also really wish normal (And expected) wear masks places like mass transit. pardon scepticism, past history taught us US military want leave, ways means leaving.

Name us instance US troops came immediate humanitarian assistance refused leave requested. Companies spanning globe, Canada Bangladesh, ready produce hundreds millions doses provided know-how. unable start. technology shared, manufacturers could produce doses quickly, Moderna Pfizer last year. would get people vaccinated countries, make fewer countries dependent wealthy ones. Monopoly control critical public-health technologies cannot justified global Well need something like this.  CNN reported people fighting oxygen tanks, police removing poor people taking ""vip patients"" I'd call organizationers trial ask make one. We’re talking many plants outside India. Hell even plants Canada. find unrealistic lifting IP won’t astounding boost production. I’d rather listen lobbyists. They’ve got good track record.

There’s risks everything life. guarantee still drive car, get plane ride roller coasters.

It’s “just like flu” it’s joke. Get damn vaccine stop thinking know better people decades experience. severely limits ability spread it. We're currently studying well spreads. Furthermore, reach herd immunity around - that's herd immunity Thanks! :D rest replied.  unreasonable ones get vaccinated matter what.

We soar passed 100 vaccines 100 days Biden worked miracle, goal incredibly likely begin intentionally low bar. think bar low think Biden turned huge risk taker overnight reason. That’s good point would say think vaccine hesitancy / refusal actually based perceiving covid legitimate threat community, rather fact superior health vaccine unnecessary.

That’s thoughts mom apparently lost voice Moderna dose 1? said shot it’s 3 hours without improvement. couldn’t find anything online assumed anxiety, would’ve thought anxiety would subsided don’t think I’d go back third shot. J&amp;J know well enough I’d never go back second shot. ...or people autoimmune diseases (some already Covid.) actually published research (and plenty anecdotal reports) certain conditions “flair-ups” vaccine. 
So, yeah, Reddit seems always divided “every thing black white...you anti-vax moron get 3 flu shots year”...

In reality, you’re 50, Covid, autoimmune disease affects kidneys, liver, organ systems...and reports people flair-ups shot...I understand hesitation, really can. 

That’s really specific example, there’s people like that. Perfect. Thanks. large contingency people willing get vaccine unless mild inconvenience them. Something like needing travel concerts movies. Stuff like that. make hard possible participate free market get heard immunity thing keep going going. Well shit. Ding ding ding, winner.

Those people care, they'll shape data fit bullshit beliefs.

You can't reason people position reason into. say 70% non-crazy people? Good thing you’re president reading comprehension problem. Maybe. friend mine horrible flu-like symptoms around Seattle. doc tested flu negative. first statement suggests something like ""the vaccines totally ineffective certain strains"", least, something like ""the vaccines severely compromised dealing certain strains"". was, least, takeaway first statement.

The second statement suggests nothing sort. says ""some variants might cause illness people fully vaccinated"", already know. vaccines never supposed literally 100% effective COVID-19 related illness. vaccines nonetheless very, very, highly effective COVID-19. true everyone.  Wasn’t Dan Crenshaw supposed eating words now? Meanwhile Philly Mayor Kenney announced today going along rest state. update today basically ""hopefully September, keep cases down, know might able return kind normalcy, hope pray.""

It's massively anti-science outlook. ""live let live"" mentality towards life. problem context Covid (rather irrational) fear people maskless outside non-crowded areas imposed rest us form outdoor mask mandates. Luckily lifted now.

I think country we're going face big problem people dubbing ""covid anxiety"". mean, people cannot cope even fully vaccinated, completely within right stay lockdown want. Again, problem oftentimes find types people want everyone else lockdown too.

I'm hoping people start realize amazingly effective vaccines get back normal life. took 5 minutes find Moderna J&amp;J availability tomorrow Boston dozens pharmacy locations.

If trying. Peer pressure push lot forward shouldn’t thing health insurance. understand 95% efficacy refers developing symptoms related COVID instead meaning 95% people won’t contract COVID.

Anecdotally, though, Muslims know either studying medicine already medical field, got vaccine way everyone else lol. wonder that’s contributing factor.  need convince half republicans happen know buy logic antivaxers drive vaccine-resistant variants.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  I’m roughly age you, also good health. never worried would happen caught COVID.

But I’ve *very* worried may accidentally spread COVID, someone at-risk may get ill (or die) carelessness. know there’s still enough data well vaccines prevent transmission say anything certainty, *in theory* reduce transmission, preliminary data that’s published suggests indeed case.

I got shot soon eligible. Carrot stick. get 70% enjoy 4th freedom masks. trials Canada already? Good news. Going along point, probably good amount people WANT get vaccine, struggling A) find time take work/away family responsibilities two separate closely linked dates go get shots B) think able spare even receive entire day work get ass kicked second shot. 

I know camp delayed eventual vaccine appointment. weeks every time able actually find available appointment either ""well, appt find 30-40 min drive away can't leave long middle work day"" ""my 2nd shot fall day X, important thing day appt need functional can't risk miserable."" Thankfully able work eventually.

I'm sure status J&amp;J vaccine right pause ended, I'm wondering one help reach 70% goal since lot convenient people. seen, seems Moderna Pfizer vaccines still way common. gotta do. Mask mandate lifted businesses. got shot work retail. haven’t worn mask work weeks it’s awesome. Instead listen news everyday find ist verboten.

Isn't news masks *aren't* problem oftentimes find types people want everyone else lockdown too.

However, mandate lifted... wearing mask affect you? pass universal healthcare dammit  Isn’t final rate blood clot risk closer 1 500k? everyone knows public sucks understanding probability, that’s people play lotto. public health officials should’ve said “hey, risk significant enough make known population? No? Ok let’s hold tell medical professionals keep eye it”. fuck downvoted? genuine question talked about. graph show pause lifted. Also, take account 1 3 major vaccines taken market going result fewer vaccines available use? I’ve got idea. Maybe ask them? struggle one partner medical private practice. staff, 10% opted receive vaccine. vaccinated, one since contracted virus work, causing close co-workers fear exposure (as still eating break room albeit socially distanced way (big room, lots seating). One partners even openly berated one staff caused lot suffering practice time already stretched thin, causing co-workers take additional responsibilities addition heavier load work. office manager discussed inappropriate potentially sensitive done that. But, damn it, would pay rest $250 get vaccine could 100%, I’d pay already gotten without financial reward same! Yep freedom pay insurance. Covid control enough pandemic fade collective consciousness coming months, there’s absolutely *no way* hand shaking hugs anything else sort goes “extinct”. think you’re severely underestimating necessity popularity basic forms human contact. certain amount people shun contact going forward? Yep, consider sad thing, like. But, that’ll mean hand shakes hugs rest us.  Sounds like threat me. going force? appears it’s going least 5 months sort meaningful change happens restrictions. doubt vaccinations help numbers, I’m obviously disputing all. government seems unresponsive great decreases we’ve seeing case death numbers. 20 people family owned restaurant unsustainable, given nothing changed 0% vaccination rate 55%, essentially plans make meaningful changes next leg national statewide journey, don’t see changing, regardless numbers.

Yeah, I’ve seen, reactions tend pretty personal. know people age who’ve essentially unaffected, also know people who’ve gotten fevers 104°. I’ve reactions past, I’m inclined say I’d toward latter end spectrum. 6 days number got 2 doses 3 days each, 6 though.

That’s good news.

They can’t directly charge me, can’t send bill mail. (and probably do, given state things) pass costs onto family ways don’t directly violate law. parents opposed getting vaccine point. I’m taking account making decision, would rather angry rates went got vaccine.

I agree, though it’d nice see *something*, even something like personal covid restrictions depending vaccination status. Admittedly, would nearly impossible enforce.

Of course say certain we’ve observed, observed noticeable wane effectiveness time. Even putting effectiveness at, say, 1.5 years, I’d still find prohibitively frequent everything shut back everyone gets 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc shots. April 13th birthday... I'm sorry. say, feels good live Florida. No. read word “graph” thought nickleback song “photograph” felt like spreading word. still wear mask theme park...

I think that’s Yep, wanting confirm true American know sure. Honestly, ready Fall sounds pretty prioritized me. remember back March 2020 people saying getting vaccine approved 18 months would breakneck pace. fact vaccines already distributed year still pretty mind-boggling. It’s it’s exaggerated false data. don’t know normal person believes that. Everyone see age data however doesn’t lie Yea, Ghana. grocery store road.

Since administration vaccines done state level clue even talking about. Isn’t miserable little bit culture though?

That could part they’re doing... I'm sure meant 6 feet Cocks space pistol Im 100% positive people claim wear masks forever won’t.

Big entitled children. think report stating crematoriums processing x24 times average expect. sad countries can't get vaccines large percentage adult population get free vaccine. long ago production availability issue trying convince pudding heads get it. Mind you, around states started opening vaccine general public, naturally gonna doses peak, appointments immediately fill they, well, won't. J&amp;J pause must impact—appointments cancelled mean less doses given, among issues—but would careful put blame that. Nah Biden promising overdelivering, think forecasted pretty well go say this. Gotcha. IMO, can't really blame wary vaccine. Like said, 50s, overweight, diabetes, etc...a lot people saying vaccines contribute blood clots. Whether that's true not, probably reading stories scared also higher risk complication vaccine. Kind worst worlds. expect get The_Dunbasses board? sure causation correlation? makes sense vaccination rates dropping vaccines available nearly everyone sixteen up. even half vaccinations compared Tuesday. wont drop mask mandates reach 70%? hell going people still refuse stuck 60% rest year? seems like months ago hospitals overwhelmed closest hospital turned employee parking overflow non-COVID-19 emergency room. hope family fully recovers.

Can’t speak whether pharmacies still slammed though, guess it’s like since definitely hitting “happy it, ain’t going work hard”.

That’s I’m happy offering vaccines attendee Mariners Sounders (MLS) games. Yeah didn’t really change behaviour much got vaccinated. haven’t felt unsafe year now. Plus everything closed months anyways list countries variants floating around frequently?

Post-vaccination second half year I'll looking travel bit, would still like reduce risks slightly since (a) coverage 94% 100% (b) i'm sure much prevention vaccine has.

(c) I'm super indecisive would help narrow things lol Haha know wrong, moron Make illegal Nicee also know fair group people say “I’m young healthy, everyone around would risk vaccinated, doesn’t matter” common decency. Empathy. common sense. don’t disagree everything (I’m much progressive biden) holy fuck imagine change goals harder every months you’re literally good job. That’s honestly commendable Agree everything said. frustrating see people correctly said “Follow science” year ago coming favor things like mask mandates lockdowns completely ignore science it’s time start rolling stuff back. guy clearly troll making political spin.  real world split

It's split 90/10, sure....but US split rural cities. Cities typically align certain political view corresponds vaccinations. Rural areas typically align political view corresponds Covid denial.

There definitely demographic difference virus able exploit. Areas high concentration Covid denial also areas low vaccine demand. That's ultimately there's surplus mostly rural states.

Unless something changes vaccine demand among Covid deniers, pockets US pandemic continue kill. as, big cities largely safe.  thought Q*Bert said Biden canceling 4th July. It’s hard keep track stuff. Oh god, offered mega millions kind winnings chance, $40 Golden Corral gift certificate, every obese fuck country would bright early next morning. really hope enjoy privilege never question medical professional's intentions best interest, seriously. people lucky He's saying this, seems like really spends lot time effort talking bad news AZ good others chance get one side effects ton higher. woman giant virus halo  means understand insurance works. Unnecessary utilization increases everyone's costs insurance company. almost forgot leaderships looks like. Thanks Biden reminding me!  West Virginia? hand 9mm .223 ammo dose good finally take shit lmao   Sometimes vaccine effective multiple doses. Phizer Moderna example. two doses same, immune system responds much strongly second dose provides better immunity that.

The thing could case natural immunity, vaccine could provide longer/better immunity. yeah, think strong studies effect case (yet?). certainly could case.

I'd ask doctor/follow CDC guidance (as said planning to). everyone else: CDC says get vaccine say, case resistance gets weaker, probably want get Covid again. Hey look, guy fucking job shoving shit throat every day. Hey guy, good job! actually require either vaccines save certain situations/deployments. Source, military received either. vaccines also EUA. 

Military leaders could potentially mandate full authorization, come without legal/political consequences. easy full confidence would already done.  *objectively* taking larger risk getting vaccinated. describing logical fallacy.    think makes sense. need monitor side-effects also need make sure dosage high enough effective. comparing 2 uncharted territories, one unknown variables. (I hope one person grasps I’m poorly explaining.) True that!  

Playing island mode! isn’t really reasonable statement. 

I’m sure least people, intelligent, decided don’t want take risk. vehemently disagree assessment, don’t believe changes whether person intelligent.

Lol seem unbiased I'm still nervous carrier others though, IDK - start going mask free party lesiure settings without worrying others getting sick gonna lit  Making out. True beast mode Taiwan New Zealand, unwavering start finish skeptical reason **need** 3rd shot. 

And point, think ""skeptical"" generous term. Hysterical / paranoid probably applicable. Yeah, sone dystopia idea China would gladly all. totally American. Give break. Hey get it. Wasn’t trying convince stated getting vaccinated, providing insights, like others, situations contradict young/health rationale. I’m happy hear you’ve come around knew vape issue interesting burgeoning industry. tell Virginia, may may Santa Claus.   That's really works, selfish infected probably mess first place. Dr. Bob Kelso? Even though India imploding we’ve reached inflection point. People don’t want vaccine won’t get vaccine. Depends location duration ischemia, generally speaking, good. booster usually necessary know level antibodies spurred vaccine drop time.

Just like vaccine, need booster different cadence's depending long bodies keep producing antibodies, amount. amount invariably decrease. 

If turns covid antibodies blood stay year so, nobody takes booster we'd back square one. Assuming course COVID still year now. GOAT Madden soundtrack Okay, we’ll stop producing vaccines (that also exported) instead give raw materials company doesn’t even approved vaccine yet. definitely help global rollout!

We aren’t “hoarding” like many places like call it. fully using 100% production capacity, actually many cases isn’t even enough need reusing thing aren’t supposed reused. going supply constrained majority world vaccinated, instead simply complaining current supply chain, every county trying expand supply chain. seen reports gym outbreaks anywhere? I've puzzled can't find more. Fitness classes, yes, much gyms. Always places commonly reported, like referenced blog post. I've trying get vaccinated feels like months. 3 weeks ago finally appointment pharmacy, pharmacist declined give first shot I've reactions vaccines before. First one issue DTP, seizure like event. Second meningitis vaccination, fainted hour shot.

Pharmacist told go primary care provider. called office, find I'm considered patient anymore years since I've appointment, administering current patients. Next time opening patient August. Also looking doctors insurance network see get sooner, much luck. I’ve got idea. 

Every one gets vaccinated gets ice cream cone.  actually makes think we'll hit it, Biden done nothing promise deliver. Based variant spreading India, mask free terrible fucking idea. got Moderna dropped champ Rocket League. get unvaccinated? least five people employed Kimia Farma Diagnostika accused washing reusing nasal swabs thousands coronavirus tests since December employed conduct rapid antigen tests passengers Kualanamu airport city Medan, police estimated reused swabs 150 kits 20,000 times.  


They likely infected people got killed That's going mean reaching stupid people. Sorry I’ll make sure Reddit comments nuanced enough you. irrationally optimistic. don’t really fly, leave country, road tripper, less incentive get it. Lol what? Cases outdoor transmission course documented. think claim contention. Kind odd obtuse philosophy science paint absurdly broad brush.

It's question magnitude. plain fact outdoor transmission much harder establish establishing transmission tends rely identifying transmitted. exactly replying contending post? Correct. California best right one worst winter. timeline mentioned it’s actually link itself.

Are lying purpose?

Or make mistake there?

Remember Jesus watching. Yikes first time 1M doses per day months. no. Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

So? made life saving drug. Millions probably saved. Remember asshole president made millions profit county suffered worst pandemic? know there's documented cases issue, FDA sure going wait see. Testing would need done show two (or more) mixed vaccines efficacy separated shots. reason vaccines co-administered studies done show lose efficacy given way. 

Personally think issue, strongly believe study done rolling combination shots. clinical trials results published public (really: medical professionals) read verify. necessity booster shots backed hard data waning antibodies time.

Just like vaccine, antibodies certain pathogen invariably decreases time. tried eventually done away one showed up. There's lot overlap people still scared go want events vaccinated only. first doses cratering? US administered enough natural progression, hesitation among public? could maybe willing adults received it’s anti-vaxxers remain? Set specific date measure success. 

Set patriotic date celebrate success. guess think ~1/1,000,000 odds dying J+J vaccine greater ~1/555 Americans already died COVID (including got disease didn't). predict people end getting year. shots better served places vaccinations widespread. state system sent pharmacy sites, enter data seeing available appointments. back March, maybe improved now. got shots county health departmen. wouldn’t have. hadn’t gone friend made appointments time (before went lunch) don’t know would’ve gone. Always something better do. Miami Heat tried one sat vaccinated-only section got rid it.  /r/politics interpretation actual situation. Same. I'll join three dose gang there's booster autumn. worries.

Walking sidewalk encountering dozen people per hour? outside talking 4hours friend, coughing, laughing sharing?

The whole narrative outdoors safe doesn’t make sense another case reading science properly isn’t making cute newspaper headline summary. 

There’s risk whenever contact people. Outdoors good ventilation it’s always lower risk risk there, it’s present mask usage still occur high risk areas least. 

Also rules vaccinated VS unvaccinated terrible idea. anyone enforce without starting ask vaccination certificates everybody? Redditors work free number major undersestimate downplays India's crisis.

To put things perspective, seems like India path 10-20 million COVID deaths unless take action now. I’m sorry, gullibles keep touting Pfizer’s marketing materials.

Was 1.95 billion dollar contract Marian money something? believe it’s US Pfizer's initial claim New York Times never part Operation Warp Speed, CNN asked company nuance situation. response, Pfizer spokesperson Sharon Castillo provided statement said company indeed part Operation Warp Speed.

Was half billion dollars given Biontech German government speed development funny money?

Was estimated 16 billion dollars technology contributed development US government chump change?

You folks nothing lapping corporate PR mind blowing ignorance really something see. first group majority IMO without finding studies this, based experience . 2nd group louder though make seem like they’re majority far worse italy even brazil, RTPCR labs backlog upto 5 days heard many cases patient already died report came funeral.
People dying street parking lot temple infront hospitals Italy. Italy never ran beds medical oxygen. think that’s point.

Amazon hand - Europe sales income 44bn €. due accountant magic taxes it.

Pfizer saves lives. Amazon e-shop. likely need booster shot records! can’t write laminated cards apparently.

Edit: least that’s told shots. Good luck idiots not? Exactly. Proving outdoor transmission stranger almost impossible proving got infected surfaces numbers aren’t reliable measure prove anything. 

We know basic science outdoor transmission occur. Yes, lower rate surely risk otherwise wouldn’t enforcing rule crowded environments. vaccines depended everyone else getting work?

1798 article based opinions people.

I get article earth blow tomorrow ask right people questions want. Seems like they’re hitting wall. comes challenging part. also set new goal becoming president July 4. likely?  Thanks making flu season worse everyone, selfish af ""just lock vaccine never lock again"" Masks get us this, like last 15 months. 

Vaccines will. That's thing will. That's fair point. messaging basically weird combination failing scare vulnerable freaking healthy. Really? compared Wisconsin indoors think perhaps 50% mask usage now. mRNA vaccines require cold storage India lacks even urban centres. Transporting vaccines rural India nightmare lack infrastructure store vaccines. However, government approve it, private sector could import this. One keep mind vaccines expensive India vaccines. anything pandemic proven public SUCKS risk assesment.

Like Trevor Noah said us able get herd immunity:

*“In divided times, it’s great see Americans coming together fail something easily achievable.”* achieve herd immunity since kids aren’t vaccinated now, numbers adults actually need 70%...

Of course herd immunity tough concept kind high number good stop major spreads want “eradicate” disease much possible, adults would need 70%. kids young round, better believe age group comes up, I’ll crying tears relief. We’ve discussed already it’s open them, getting vaccinated. still spread it. UK saying looks like equal risk.  cases women simply healthcare dominated females healthcare workers first get shots.

 median age death coronavirus 80. 

E g h y

Coronavirus less chance kill normal life expectancy US. 

Should vulnerable populations take seriously take precautions? Sure, get vaccinated. 

Should world locked indefinitely virtually zero tangible benefit? 

Obviously not, pure reactionary head-in-sand level insanity. 

You safest locked house seeing nobody nothing. Living life bears risk. die one day. afraid live life, stop resenting aren’t. Aw hell naw I’m school. pay taxes. I’m perfectly fine spending money infrastructure, social welfare, etc. I’m okay assuming risks idiots. going stimulate economy necessary actions required help country get funds. Personally I’m tired antivaxers delaying economy fully reopening. want medal? Again. I'm saying risk much lower. Extreme sociopathic selfishness ain't fucking freedom puts mine risk. church partnered local pharmacy one Sunday morning offered it, church property, congregants wanted one. pretty great idea, provided church leadership board idea (and, thankfully, is). fair messaging regarding transmission atrocious. lot people still impression vaccinations affect ability spread covid. spent month trying get vaccinated Michigan became eligible essential worker. tried every pharmacy whatever within 25 miles luck. Almost friends (most work home) managed get appointments whatever reason. travel work got covid.

That three weeks ago still can't get appointment. assume widely available everywhere. suspect yes. Provinces kept pace increasing supply far, reason think it'll different now. known ahead time, exception slightly quicker Moderna shipment. occur, yes. hard get handle asymptomatic infections, people lot less likely get tested. Therefore, numbers usually skew symptomatic. true super-precise comparison, I'm making super-precise statement: I'm merely saying numbers look similar squint them. well documented kids exceedingly low risk serious illness COVID-19. perspective, CDC estimates around 600 children died influenza 2017–18 season; 2009 H1N1 pandemic, 358 pediatric flu deaths reported. year, 700 children die drowning. end April, 277 died COVID-19.

Lmfao unfuckingbelievable people want children lockdown life. pissed soooooo many ppl backtracked. 

Our hospitalizations 350 way. Less 10% capacity. one overwhelmed I'm sure many people diligently always wearing makes, gotten vaccine. Kids extremely low risk comes covid, much important get adult population vaccinated. definitely get covid twice live society... yo might weak yall work hangover salute  70% would get us level herd immunity. Especially since around 10-15% people Covid level immunity, temporary. worthy goal. succeeds, Covid cases US fall cliff July 4th. Don’t believe me? Look what’s happened Israel. We’re 50 now…. 

No aren't: I'm central valley. things different lol. wish would something like Illinois. Chicago mayor came today saying everything open 4th July, rumored mask mandate stay place next year. got J&amp;J vaccine last week know people getting vaccinated incentive someone 20s basically zero. bruh tuesday

That's normal life know!!! think maybe anxiety fucking vaccine, way around? literally worried right now. I'm pretty sure variant gets away vaccine South African AstraZeneca (and think Sinovac Brazilian variant), assume either American Canadian probably get one good go. Dude, bad plague, society would ended. Europe managed survive plague people actually knew grow food. happened us, western society would've suffered total collapse. covid killed approximately 570,000 one year US. kills fewer next year vaccine. Hard disagree. risks far outweighed benefits, cause/effect connection seem there, would impossible keep unnoticed occurrences happened. 

In long run, would either come officially, become obvious, FDA knew side effect, decided keep quiet keep people getting vaccines, public trust would shot next pandemic. 25 year old man here. First dose tomorrow. Toss crater! Woohoo! Also lot skepticism POC thanks things like Tuskegee. fair bets Europe, especially UK. Everything else kinda air. defend constitution? written government. certainly gave lots freedom blacks document. ask 100 million? Oh like idea. everyone gets anthrax? knew small pox, I'm saucy anthrax, one sucked every time. Thats really tough situation. Really sucks kids suffering made best decisions last year.

Masks much unnatural things.

I dont hate masks think they're big deal, burn celebration dont wear anymore. badge honor wear mask like people.

Now I'm fully vaccinated, never wear except mandated state. I'm going throw fit, they're also unnecessary point I'm looking forward changes.  Aunt getting married. Actually got married privately last year, postponing big marriage party reception three times, decided waited enough. 20-something cousins unvaccinated Aunt convinced COVID catch mild, everyone party. turning combination family gathering / marriage / infection party. Batshit crazy.

Edit: googled it. 3600 damn. Oh hell no. Would able wear mask really big motivator?

Lets hope wins odds incentivizing vaccine Since Biden's set goal 70% adults 7/4, might want start including number well. able successfully explain actual meaning efficacy number them? 70 percent unfortunately maximum they're going able achieve due vaccine hesitant idiots. wild thing morons who've complaining whole time wanting get back normal going make never BS.  live FL we've basically open since July. boggles mind people able go eat states. absolutely absurd.   white hetero males allowed become doctors days.

It’s premium level, it’s incentive. call like healthy choice rewards. It’s charging less more. one obligated anything. Possible booster months even years future. Studies done determine what’s needed. Could annual thing, like flu shots protection new mutations, every years, like tetanus shot booster. need help. also means follow curve get there.

It’s tough IMO I’m outdoors it’s total 10 people, breathing hard close proximity

What soccer? much close proximity there. Volleyball tennis seem fine.   think necessarily headline cost Pfizer issue stuff Pfizer requires, things like government paying lawsuits put Pfizer least south american countries Pfizer requiring things like embassies abroad collateral. definitely see poorer countries around world far refused sign contracts Pfizer. 


Also, costs hospitals private hospitals include cut deliver said vaccine (so Pfizer's would higher 740 rupees here) base price current indian vaccines 150 rupees, got large population significant.  uhhh nah that’s 😂  got two lindt truffles second shot. One strawberry cheesecake. Can't wait go back booster 👉 no, don’t think 😌 word ""quarantine"" not, stretch imagination, company took real risk research government subsidized (i.e. paid people).

Not US government wasn't. paid vaccines approved. upfront risk solely Pfizer, take money government develop it. reward getting shot. swear read comment somewhere else recently, similar one. Maybe lots redditors getting haircuts lady. last 15 days 3 close relatives dead, everyday someone know dying. Today one father's colleague colage friend's dad died. saftey measures partially effective. Indoors, masks 6ft distance sufficient prevent infection spread virus. 

Vaccinated persons still get covid (both symptomatic non-symptomatic); vaccinated persons still spread virus. 

Which indoors, even vaccinated, masks still required. BS. vaxx l even trial results. fell behind get big slice profits vaccinating world they're trying blame US world's scapegoat. turned US production collab praised locally so. tied rope.

It’s game numbers. personally know 39 year old dude got sick two weeks, symptoms month. isn’t Ebola, it’s worth getting shot moving fucking lives. Ahh, yeah that's legit then. agree, insurance companies absolutely incentivizing people get vaccine beyond free. consider ""significantly high rate"". 2 shots now, also wanted wait 6 months post vaccines becoming available see would longer term effects populations representative data compiled companies financial interest first market.

Yeah that's felt. I've NEVER anti-vax, also want first round people get one vaccines case something went sideways. 

I think they've proven (especially Pfizer Moderna) safe &amp; effective though! 6 days later, I'd get tested. husband got first shot tested positive several days later similar symptoms described.

Pay people $600 get vaccinated bet hit 80% easy guess depends read 18% unsure. really evenly unsure (not really leaning one way another), without influence half get half don't, would put 29% getting 71% getting it. influence myth, think new administration put influencing popular opinion vaccine much higher priority list old one did, think tangible results. remember long ago talking 50% unsure vaccinated (or something like that, much higher 18%). \*shrug\* Fine, replace ""vaccinated"" ""immunized"". Point still stands, regardless whether got immunized easy way hard way. long don’t Republican’ts people, might make it. They’ve made COVID denial one party planks. What’s next, toilet paper oppression? almost US rotten evil core! Thanks NIH! unions really pop ok places gonna defend right unvaccinated? would massive hill climb esp white collar professions unions don’t traditionally exist Same. “wait ‘n’ see” group. waited I’ve seen.

You hear new clusters New Zealand... Tell go chain pharmacies websites. hard time state's website (would drive hour), found one 5 minutes away local Rite Aid. Rite Aid's website. Yeah gotcha makes sense. Well hopefully coworkers vaccinated, it’s way safely go back normal us. understand point, though, vaccine doesn’t prevent covid, doesn’t prevent transmission actual point taking it? Aren’t mutations still able occur? AFAIK isn’t vaccine supposed ease symptoms catch it? American. entire point insurance pool costs reduce risks. Everyone's premiums pay everyone's claims. Fewer overall claims lower overall premiums. friction burns hole mask Much different state I’m news thank   problem open discussion vaccine became political. There's people geniune concerns. example many women seem issues period vaccination. Yet brought public forum, considered anti-vax talk, misinformation, anti science. 

People understand many people afraid, distrustful, waiting see happens. There's plenty valid reasons people unsure. Yet since became almost like religion can't ask questions vaccine mass censorship social media sites, actually created opposite effect. gave many people legitimate concern can't even show uneasy uncertain. interesting employer provided health plans require vaccination eligible coverage. Health insurance companies aren’t interested paying preventable 6 figure hospital stays personal fringe politics, alternative facts life style choices.  much. say X amount people store time vs packing place wall wall. would need demonstrate health safety employees could protected via accommodations. example, someone could work home, could wear mask, could get tested frequently, etc. Covid caused 500,000 deaths year. Maybe yours. make difference mine. 

I'm going get vaccinated need travel concert something. 

My risk level extremely low society large decided long time ago minor luxury worth risking coworkers lives ""essential workers"". within 6 feet probably nearly 10 thousand maskless people since covid started Btw, whole family gets flu shot, regardless age. cancer destroying democracy also think one roadblock lot people covid see need.

I fall boat. covid months back. I'm waiting everyone's chance wants one, I'll go. honestly, see point. natural immunity actually wears off, really know long takes, lifetime people(unlikely), understand vaccine could grant longer lifetime immunity. truly found compelling study argument vaccine better(what mechanisms work make such) even necessary obtaining natural immunity. annual booster situation, bet ass I'm waiting full year time tested positive even bother starting *lifetime* vaccination boosters. 

Like said, I'll still get point, see point right now. Everyone else pays insurance pays healthcare. Unless payments unreasonably high, yearly payments towards healthcare provider cover full cost ~$35k bill..

When asymptomatic unknowingly spread old people, taxpayers cover medical costs end ICU.

Edit- reading replies, idea Freedom means, understand health insurance funded. Let's Honestly people would 10k like head at. lottery every 100k people? pick one pay taxes 2021. Oh good, need snail bait. Smh ... cuz bullshit trump said ... smh ... 

The thing gets percentage already benefit vaccines parents made get ... 

Fucking idiots surprise. what’s expected, ask company rush hundreds millions vaccines good world. think public health officials like publicly acknowledging natural immunity real fear it'll motivate people go get infected demotivate getting vaccinated. Vaccination cheaper, safer, faster, want promote much possible. 
 
Now, lie backfire them? Definitely could. least see they're coming Cash payments, west virginia's efforts good model, think Essentially important parts hold virus’ data same, stored new fluid stops breaking fast. get new approval make sure shelf-stabilizing preservatives safe won’t affect anything   Best place world summer. pretty sure insurers can't that. can't even take weight obesity account much bigger factor health outcomes covid vaccine. use age, location, tobacco use think it. almost never get flu shot apathy although would first line get Covid shot allowed.

Unless old shite lungs that's absolutely adorable. got mine February, shots I’m careful anymore may get boost soon cos I’m going wedding I’m careful anymore pharmacies throwing shots away. seems fade little first two months fourth month- still high efficacy high immediate eight weeks. conflating vaccinations immunity. There's still shit ton people never going get vaccine got covid even still there's tens thousands people- vast majority vaccinated- get every day.

That still confers immunity. RN worked walk clinic yesterday- 5 hours gave 14 shots. waste.  think people interested already gotten people left maybe lazy majority hard No. It’s government guaranteed boon start.  Interesting, really still much quieter? recently honestly seemed like pre-pandemic weekend crowd masks. Maybe seemed way since I’ve cooped long though lol  neighbors 65 age range. mom got vaccine trial, trial got placebo doses February. Anyways younger family one dose people waiting could get vaccine RiteAid corner-less half mile house. soon could daughter made appointment went. weren’t going put mass vaccine site anything. mean getting shot right means signing several different waitlists seeking areas expiring dosages/cancellations following people know. aren’t particularly concerned could see wouldn’t put effort means get shot later much less effort. again, public gets taken ride funding investments made decades, entirely funds private company removes risk, pays arse prices back end things. public’s ROI? least, paying high prices end product paid front end it? Systematic reviews studies (rather cherry-picking) shows 1%, maybe like 5+%. outlier studies, like 1% high 12.5%, likely incorrect. 

And remember, that's most-risky outdoor activities mostly banned (packed concerts, contact sports). that's despite people spending 5%-10% time outdoors. systematic review published studies transmission novel coronavirus respiratory viruses, Razani colleagues found less 10 percent cases described spread outdoors. also found frustratingly papers detailed settings clearly compared indoor outdoor takeaway it’s impossible get infection outdoors, even though published, clearly proportion happens much lower,” Razani said. added: “If going beach — beautiful thing — avoid times it’s crowded, mask, Plan B.” interpretation ""how fucked something lose looser standards 'emergency authorization'""?

Still would rather take J&amp;J one mrna vaccine. I'll let y'all figure kinks first generation those. ISD (in Texas) made us send kids back school height pandemic. don’t give af, withdrew kid. dieing? COVID super early lockdowns, loved everything ghost town. sauntered mask zero fear.  similar discussion someone healthy young reddit. ""i freedom I'll fine get it.""

The problem is, large enough portion population feels way, threatens population/global health pandemic providing reservoir willing people vested interest curbing transmission. know it, we've allowed strongest variants mutate deadlier, transmissible forms beat vaccines. likely reduce/eliminate covid, issue lies 50% people immunized, fight go lot longer should, disrupt lives, kill others, lot should. much Pfizer receive U.S. Government? Vaccine might save inflation poverty end killing more.....but hey, keep printing dollars Im married guy scheduled mine helped wife schedule lol problem majority population doesn’t sense realize odds Agreed. posted thought elsewhere thread. Counterintuitively, think people would get vaccinated Biden said ""vaccines available, get one not, care.""  noticed Americans tend fall three socio-cultural groups comes vaccination:

I. vaccine enthusiastic. people tend either Northeastern secular educated affluent European Americans, Asian Americans social classes. find many people category shopping Whole Foods, eating healthy balanced meals, reading scientific advancements news, etc.

II. vaccine moderates, strongly personal vaccination. people tend working class African Americans Hispanics. Many people group would like eat healthier meals, get kids higher education, money social networks so. Group 2 people willing vaccinated, want go way it. might unable take 1-2 days work go appointment recover side effects. moderately unwilling vaccinated, persuaded grassroots outreach.

This article NYT says ""Campaigns aimed convincing Black Latino urban communities set aside vaccine mistrust made striking gains"": anti-vaxxers. people tend working class European Americans live flyover states. may find people attending Evangelical churches, anti-masker rallies, watching InfoWars. Group 3 people tend deeply distrustful education, secularism, science, leads staunchly anti-vaxxer views. Fuck asshole. Yeah, CA created equal. state county map that's concern is. Even metro I'm projected one like 3 counties hit 90% eventually (2 adjacent within metro) still 40% one dose site went #2 freaking ghost town last week. 

I think areas like mine skepticism overall J&amp;J issues really killed momentum folks fence waiting out. Well, depends 20% means. 20% Pfizer reported 2020 overall. (41B revenue, 8.1B operating income)

But clear, 20% huge comparison average business. 20% low pharma, that's problem. original commenter feel like shit. alternating feverish chills morning, dizzy, queasy stomach sore arm addition general achiness. called sick work. long supposed last? vaccine continue mutate, vaccines need modified time goes along. seems promising so.  Michigan surge opened first time since pandemic started something like 47th country per capita cases time.

If wasnt widespread vaccination, Oregon Washington would likely going something similar right (and Oregon actually seeing spikes areas; indoor dining, gyms, etc., closed state's biggest county). would one they're 6 inches away stranger? Sword fighting? u/i_love_mom saying 90% cities fully vaccinate, trying convey aspects ""herd immunity"" argument fall apart longer pay CDC/who messaging. right, cities work like mother lover never claimed did. said, politicization virus, vaccine, seems me, actually resulted areas less prone vaccinate (thus making cities work like oc claimed). expect interesting studies years come result disparity vaccination rates exist.

Herd level immunity, many scooters agreeing, achievable. Covid likely stay, like corona-viruses (e.g. Colds) deal annual basis. Easterly pandemic hope spread could limited, thus mutations/different strains, might possible eliminate vaccine (though even many experts expressed doubt could fully eliminated). 

Basically, valid aspects type points, also working rough examples. Higher vaccination rates slow spread, important, vaccinated individuals get infected also favorable outcomes.  common sense Hello fellow life science colleague! Always pleasure. definitely think review abbreviated. I’m also curious go pediatric approval. I’m couple pediatric nonCV19 studies process long arduous various Authorities. Interested see approval navigated pediatrics emergency circumstance. I’m right behind you, man. everything care back, like you, I’m fully vaccinated. Got moderna 24 hours ago. kick morning.

I’m sure we’ll plateau point clear yet. I’m hoping it’s sub 1000 understanding wrong. “Mom, please! want ice cream!” got everything right year makes prediction caution he’s fear monger hack scientist people ignore. 

I'm going list things Osterholm wrong about, February statements cautious predictions: borderline apocalyptic. Shortly thereafter, head CDC went TV, cried, said felt impending doom.

The data time support extreme predictions. UK variant already slowing UK vaccines rolled out, reason believe going true U.S. saw one Wally World mom, like, Yee Haw! got second shot today guy CVS prepped shot talked bit it. kept professional possible said understand many people refusing get breath said, well kind can. said many people understand science behind rushed mess J&amp;J shot pause going lot damage cause. told Covid asymptomatic watched guy much older die last month unknown long term effects, want avoid it. said opinion, going come time unvaccinated person Covid late 2021 goes doctor 15 years random problem lungs damaged issues body related Covid.

As sister brother law fully vaccinated due jobs requiring it, wife gets second shot 6 days dad done well. mom however due husband's ""5G, BiLl GaTeS, tRuSt gOvErNmEnT!"" outlook getting it.

You might want update statistics new variants. Covid mutated multiple times deadly (as well contagious) young people dying. New goal: Make 70% adults *want* vaccinated making claim outdoor transmission exists withoit evidence neutral basis

no one prove outdoor transmission doesnt exist doesnt exist

proving lack something ascientific

the burden proof common knowledge prove hypotheticals outdoors cause transmission, far zero evidence hypotheticals, thus founded scientific methodology can, it’s meaningless. Exceedingly unlikely. everyone opportunity yet. Children still vaccinated make significant percentage population. vaccine FDA approved children see another large jump overall percentages.  pesticide example ignoring large swathes ""unvaccinated"" areas. non-farmland vegetation functions possible reservoir ""breakthrough"" pests. That's keep native pests around they'll crowd potential breakthrough pests off-season (and neighboring land) keeping new pests spreading.

With COVID-19, potential eliminate reservoirs. native COVID-19 also might crowd new strain (strain seems like right word totally breaking through). enough breakthrough vaccine, likely breaks current COVID-19 strain. pests compete space, COVID-19 COVID-24 might immunity transfer over. south cities.

Getting covid-zero possible, require tough choices even tougher strategies. can't get point solve quarantine issue. agree current saber-rattling Ford big distraction. We're page. I'm thinking bigger: take care domestic spread (more paid sick days, shutdowns factories generate super-clusters, etc), also brainstorm traveler issue. Man loves symbolic dates. First pulling troops Iraq 9/11, ""freeing"" American people pandemic 4th July Or, CA enough doses. demand there, places half population thinks there's things viruses given equal priority distribution.  That's 100% think ought do. Draft another stimulus package send $2000 (or whatever) payment everyone listed fully vaccinated (regardless whether J&amp;J 1 shot 2 shot ones) state's immunization information system database. I'd imagine quite political/fear-based anti-vaxxers subject bribery, tying states' IIS systems, fake cardholders (hopefully) SOL unless get real. got early/already already listed rewarded accordingly gotten it.  think great, needs done encourage folks get vaccinated. Easing completely dropping restrictions vaccinated would encourage ton people step get jabbed. Yes, know yet judge long-term immunity based people vaccinated longest, point 9 months. 

So far results look promising, though, strong presence SARS-CoV-2 targeting T-cells lymph nodes, long-term immunity potential observed. 

Still, maybe end 1-year booster, could 3-5 years. problematic variants arise, could push booster schedule, course. expert, dude internet, grain salt all.

I honestly think hit herd immunity, close enough low cases, mutant strain tries break noticed earlier. like last year Covid visiting Times Square wearing ""I Heart NY"" shirt one noticed it.. could cause problems, may see regional containment measures, think spread looking it. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* good idea. lot people wanting one-dose shot Pfizer talking needing booster one year johnson johnson scare people planning getting 1 shot done back square one. really addressed national level. local anesthetic spray cream injection site?

Also, needles smaller others. Maybe someone call various locations around find one thinnest needle (like ones used pre-filled flu shots). Currently, recommending get covid shot itself. Maybe road, get boosters, right now, that's recommended. It’s funny people like vocal “following science” refusing follow science. really don’t think we’ll get 50% that’s stretch. It’s stupid. completely different vaccines higher number people vaccinated adverse effect, rare come people millions gotten it. Covid also causes vascular damage. definitely trying impose conditions, India’s government poses far stricter conditions, including ridiculous testing really impossible price restrictions. need incentivize people get vaccinated.  running people really want get need convince people get it. One thing Ross Perot taught public understand math someone trust presents charts explains basic English. think real problem hysteria perpetuated media sources misinformation sources like social media. 

Putting together persuasive data easily understood format difficult. finding someone public trusts present hard part. Vaccines two things, help reduce (not eliminate) effect virus individual help reduce virus shed individual contagious. Even children less susceptible effects coronavirus (which debatable. lot long term effects beyond ""did die not""), still act spreaders. especially dangerous people susceptible may able effectively vaccinated. vaccinating kids also reduce amount virus spread, amongst vulnerable members society. officially cleared course people, antvaxxers hesitant Efficacy determined manufacturing scale part Pfizer involved BioNtech's creation.

I accept total supply BioNtech vaccines could lower different global pharmaceutical company involved.

Most people seem double barrel 2 companies either order simply drop BioNtech entirely. dropping 1 company, Pfizer logical one drop since creator gets glory, manufacturer hence call Apple iPhone rather Foxconn phone. Yeah, that’s like every 10 years Yes especially bullies! Please think bullies. Wondering often people decide get vaccinated contract COVID-19 inevitable lifting mandates US. anti-vaxers simply spread virus eventually get amount vaccinated population enough keep spreading pretty well suppressed? We’ve used analogy invisible shield vaccines long time. kids adore idea germ comes put shield bounces away harmlessly. 

As wife got two doses, boys call first one “shield” second one “sword.” asked said “the first one protects you, second one helps protect others.” solution different results.  


But solution would actually save lives. Im ready sept/oct get younger kids. isn’t really it.

The BJP wants take credit fix. Modi already calling storm, natural disaster, something unpreventable. want take full credit helping India ride out, US UN.  Death hospitalization rates much higher covid adults flu is, (as already stated elsewhere thread) infection rate children affects adults. vaccine-resistant variant covid emerged many children getting infected, would far worse thing happening flu. Emergency 'crematoriums' (read open display funeral pyres) going 24/7 outside already overwhelmed funeral services. Safe say official death numbers pure fantasy. Thank u info, anyone know puking normal don’t allergic reaction? Got shot yesterday fever chills morning/puked lot cool. UK half world's Covid sequencing, positive cases behalf countries too. facility serology tests variants blood sera people vaccinated various vaccines, well mix match (the ongoing trials AZ, Pfizer, Modera Novavax combinations), makes lot sense. 

Assuming data shared useful global tool. wonder blood samples people vaccinated sputnik, sinopharm etc included. dropping way fast... even close plateau, falling fast rose prior weeks.  

This huge problem. part group weak accept. take it. immunize Herd. 

You're group 30% Herd. absolutely political largest group unvaccinated people country going end idnetifiable whether conservative. I’m Dry May, Dry May? asking people put aside personal needs greater good always going crapshoot.

Objectively, people even good that, though. sputnik fine, problem ones brazil contamination iirc mean much without knowing state. live Wyoming, 50% vaccinated! Beat reply!

For reported cases it’s like 205 first dose, 4 second dose.  that’s Yellow Card reporting system that’s open public. may turn true cases.

When said equal risk males/females based authorities using much smaller set investigated/confirmed cases.  didn’t say anything cases second doses. give consent old doctor provide records new doctor, simply allowing new doctor access old doctors files. old doctor sharing them!

You provide vaccine status whomever like, won’t able allow random people pull themselves.   Set vaccination tent next door. cross fingers case. not, maybe look something like vaccine finder. bound doctor area get shots. hope ok soon. feel frustrated tell still pretty good. least begging oxygen India. That’s kind feel. Arlington think saw one person inside store without mask ever (we don’t go lot fwiw). Outside doesn’t bother me, give people space. Inside it’s like…80%, still pretty good, makes uncomfortable. I’m vaxxed high risk wife isn’t vaxxed yet hanging home time. Yeah, normally healthy uncle lives Florida got Covid think last August, gave oldest 2 kids (my aunt told made day test came back positive, r doctor told people get it, thought might immune lol). ended heart problems. temperature runs average might thyroid issues. also gets bloated around month apparently looks pregnant. oldest kid (9) gets carsick barely 2 minute car ride. gets random bouts nausea bad can't anything.The youngest two kids (4 year old twins) got early March year, ended giving aunt. twins seem like long term effects, aunt still cough. Masks help end day socialisation that's problem. That's really full proper lockdowns work half-measures don't.  got shots Super Wal-mart. many people walking pharmacy saw people waiting shot 15 min. wait afterwards asking desk could get it. Depending busy front desk was, either handing print sign online making people appointment next day. last week. Another important thing note Sinopharm isn’t 65% effective two weeks second shot. first shot, learned Chili, almost gives effectiveness. Ok son say close friend group planning get vaccine right Bc they’ve covid already. wonder colleges mandating something else would nudge them. They’re outright opposed it, don’t big motivation Anyone else getting vaccine? It’s though. Right US easily get vaccine. check near there’s lot appointments. age demographic less half vaccine. would say “most” fair since half unvaccinated.  Maybe that’ll change coming soon first doses dropping rapidly. results people getting multiple vaccinations? think there's really way verify someone's already vaccinated, there? vaccine administrators access medical records? knew ahead time wanted BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine. That's got. look many doses company already shipped Pfizer already way ahead Moderna there.  It’s you. Hi there, Brazil since March 2021 personal example said. people vaccinated, fewer tested drive percentage without actually indicating problem.  

At point test-positive rate longer appropriate metric, decisions made based indicators (hospitalizations, deaths, per-capita cases, etc.). booked several appointments people western PA relative ease, including Pittsburgh, prior weeks ago. Experience varies. Obviously agree older generations tech savvy nab appointments quick, that's help. Idk signs everywhere though. I've asked 3 times keep told wait state gives approval take longer numbers go US UK Israel, strict lockdowns rollout. Whereas far tell places open US capacity limits masks. India needs help get. Refusing help foolish arrogant part.  It’s crazy people denying science trusting vaccine risks eliminated vaccine. Needle fear. believe Pfizer supposed submitting month. long actual approval don’t know, it’ll likely quicker normal since already lot data Covid-related reviews given priority far. Yeah, is. lived Arlington got new job moved lower rent. Didn’t check area signing lease. don’t think area bad means, feel bit misled. plan buy house soon hopefully aren’t long. *Southeastern US entered chat* Ok fair enough never thought that. Hope messaging changes little bit vaccinated example there's little evidence transmitting virus vaccinated maybe incentive go back normal get shot like masking. Would better sell ppl 30 Assessing risk difficult emotional aspect top numbers. Different people feel differently mathematical number. top people bombarded information different type messaging year. going take time things normalize. terms COVID numbers well PTSD associated experience. Virginia’s daily case numbers trending 1000 last days..which great! Can’t believe yesterday 600s..keep VA! happy moved WV cause WV slowing vaccines..but VA little brother (8) excited get vaccine, saw us get everything learned vaccines last year, keeps asking he's going able get one lol. could require people opt centralized database would companies opt said vaccinated. think concerts screened buy tickets either online person. email ID sent end end encryption digital signature could required. ticket would indicator holder vacinated verified. could also require waivers someone gets COVID concert venue, bands, promoter, concert goers liable damages.  could severe penalties fraud saying 5 years prison hefty fine. like sub keep date headlines, turned Youtube ""don't read comments"" situation recent months. goes ""sky falling"" ""time unmask"" sides. Booksmarts =/= critical thinking wasn’t supposed even get White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany also made bold claim February 2020, shortly joining White president always put Americans first. always protect American citizens,” McEnany said Fox Business Network. “We see diseases like coronavirus come here. see terrorism come here. isn’t refreshing contrasting awful presidency President Obama?” can't keep saying HIPAA expect become reality violation. That's like saying consent old doctor send medical records new doctor so, that's HIPAA violation. pretty early. They're omniscient Apple analogy, tho. Foxconn provides tons Engineers set production lines optimize them.  find highly unlikely several, presumably young healthy electricians conditions meant wear masks. Looks like it. guess set training via zoom. Smh

""India said collaboration undertaken virtual medium, ThePrint learnt."" Same. went max capacity (2,000/ day) barely 500 span week. First doses absolutely disappeared quite rapidly mid April. MoCo mask compliance 99% people started getting vaccinated, I’ve never seen folks masks indoors. 

Whereas went Frederick last fall masks like 60%. freaked Yeah interesting health bodies particularly concerned one despite media trying scare everyone labeling ""double mutant"". IIRC using description method, B1351 variant would actually triple mutant.

The fact matter coronavirus known decades mutate significantly, speed something like influenza. fact 3-5 variants interest concern identified despite hundreds millions unique infections really speaks volumes.

I think also need separate B1617 current awful situation they're living India. many ways they're experiencing different UK last summer B117 first came be. bit lax attitude leading surge cases, quickly spiraled control. combine densely populated country without adequate medical infrastructure, get nightmare scenario. Lmaoo that's great, also hilarious **horrifying** would sound anti-vaxxers. risk goes massively breakthrough parties vaccinated. I'm scientist man. It’s that. board seems think vaccines make immune. look Singapore’s recent surge see that’s case all.

The vaccinated, stronger vaccines be.  little brother (8) learned vaccines last year he's excited science behind bodies work haha. entire family vaccinated I'm currently fully vaccinated (mid 20's) keeps asking he's going able get one well lol. considering trying report comment actually see it? Thanks. Maybe already is? detract point making? I'm vaccinated mean can't care others covid19 still right? would actually serve well read historical response introduction seat belts. name call, lot groups opposed resonate things today Gotcha! That's unfortunate. 82.9% US adults 65 least one shot far. state PA 93.6%. know distribution republicans 65, assume close 50/50, know distribution anti vaxxers 65, getting 93.6% far PA 83% nationally says still probably large number people end getting shot near future.  headline. fear covid. bunch idiots saying ""we know long term effects vaccine yet"" well, know long term effects covid infection yet either, probably going worse anything vaccine would do. got J&amp;J month ago snap. Seriously, felt alcohol swab jab itself. 

I side effects afterwards mild stop working, exercising, etc. - popped ibuprofen totally fine.  husband currently suffering second Moderna dose yesterday, says regrets going J&amp;J instead. That’ll never happen, would huge HIPAA violation! 59% fully vacinated, remaining even partially vacinated?   revenue, profits closer 900 million.  Furthermore, experts saying, variants (and potential future ones) play, actually need 80% folks vaccinated actually achieve goal herd immunity. see conflict interests. accomplished scientist identified promising rna sequences covid19 vaccine January 2020. rando MBA. think understand corporate tax works.

Let's say start company make 100K profit. decide well instead taking 100K pocket, letting sit cash companies name rather reinvest business grow.

You buy new store, hire employees actually havnt made money year, pay taxes end profits.

The whole reason exists incentivize companies partake R&amp;D, grow generate jobs. Jobs = money everyone's pockets.

At point start paying taxes, long keep scaling won't. He's literally doctor immunology researcher wear masks though. matter time fake vaccination papers widespread. Especially make vaccination passport. mean seen big stink made airlines. Yelling flight attendants politicians. cannot see forest trees. Vaccination end pandemic sooner rather embrace accept probably yearly deal fight prolong things. sure hope so. moved MD 10 days ago seems like masks joke here.  amazon.com e-commerce website allowed posts comments.

There's recent studies suggesting vaccinated people transmit even carry need time know sure. information number hospitalisations ?

And South African variant dominant strain Seychelles?
Trying understand vaccination campaign apparently much less impact Israel, UK US. Even Europe seem downward trend much lower vaccination quota. It'll still required indoors foreseeable future. reading, looks like clearer headline might be: ""Out 23 church attendees, one person infected, _and person vaccinated_."" …I trying funny :( anything want like 90% protected even get covid body would easily get rid People India ordered it!

This clear case vaccine injury. discourage anyone get vaccine, rather call researchers scientists figure what's going on. family waiting government okay 14 year old 11 year old. want part solution soon allowed! CEOs BionTech known low key selfish. 

I think agreed call ""Pfizer Biontech"" US Americans trust get vaccinated. That’s adults, we’re near heard immunity yet. also shocked quickly moved well. fear gone old life back.

I young kids still skipping crowded indoor activities, outdoor stuff good go. Plus everyone know vaccinated safe hang unmasked. would police this? Luckily give away delivery perfectly good AZ vaccine India stopped exporting...


Oh.  Yes, that’s getting second half statement. can’t manipulate data don’t know data. clotting incidences brought attention general public, think it’s unlikely news would’ve quickly spread among people hadn’t yet vaccinated. gives us time vaccinate fence, rather putting low risk complication news everyone see Unless pull disclose internal documents either Pfizer BioNTech, neither say much production scaling Belgium Marbug due companies competency. conspiracy theory came for!! Peak crazy! Wow bold take effect them. Hundreds died, thousands hospitalized. that’s shutdowns, masks, social distancing probably pretty much end soon. also don’t know long term effects are. 

The spreads greater chance mutation deadly evades vaccines. government? ""low confidence"" statistical meaning ""low confidence"" title article wants show. wants express first. bot work sundays? I've always thought needed parent's permission get vaccinated. since many anti-vaccine parents, going hard find enough children get parent's permission get vaccinated first place, even though willing get it.

Hell, even know Physician's Assistant local hospital actively telling parents need children get vaccinated (because ""children 'low risk' need get it"") there's well. like calling Apple Chinese company products made there.

It's normally creator gets credit prestige name Apple iPhone BioNtech vaccine, Foxconn iPhone Pfizer vaccine supply chain companies creators. 

Pfizer without BioNtech = MRNA vaccine

BioNtech different global pharmaceutical company = MRNA vaccine know state registries vaccinations? hospitals required participate registry well. give covid vaccine, report jurisdiction’s vaccine tracker ([CDC vaccination cards given today source vaccination. sure, someone could lie spread covid, may still contact tracing. Honestly, idea fake passports sounds like work it’s worth. people setting huge criminal civil issues. knowingly spread STIs, that’s assault. lie vaccination spread covid, may assault too. People dumb first time happens high profile case hopefully it’ll show lying wasn’t worth it. I'm surprised surprised anyone. People inherently selfish, full-stop. Self-survival codified genes, asking people put aside personal needs greater good always going crapshoot. data regarding spread amongst kids Schools incredibly flawed. live, kid could exposed, department health would tell get tested symptomatic. kids become symptomatic recent variant, confirms obvious many. County saw 72% increase cases end following week kids switched hybrid, full time person Schooling. current variant classified Variant Interest rather Variant Concern WHO. Unless mean future one?

(Not downplay situation India. Shit sucks. keep grounded unnecessarily sensationalized) he? primary job develop company, care stock market fluctuations.

But still, yesterday's drop correction anything else - stock simply became highly valued. still 50% month 250% year.  actual need report every single death following vaccination?

Would like make post every time NHS yellow card scheme reports death heart attack diarrhoea following Pfizer jab? there's plenty too. masks come outbreaks schools. Given packed schools could become rather serous.

The long term effects kids low, zero.  There’s 10-25% chance one get covid “significantly high rate problems”? news me. thought number MUCH lower. Covid US least 18 months. time smoking killed 720k people. continue kill people coming years. vaccine free bro. Restrictions gone good get enough people vaccinated. reasoning towards needing many people possible get vaccine limit amount hosts covid have. die limit enough. Sounds like already hit lottery. Vaccinate locals. Statistics tell people coming back, minority varying like 6 20 percent state returning. Long term data never criteria FDA approval. HPV vaccine approved 6 months phase 3 trial data. It’s probably people loved defiant masks continue believe Covid joke. loved one friend horrible time Covid actually died still feel way toward Covid, there’s saving them. It’s wished Covid would kicked Trump’s ass still left alive supporters would visually see thing nothing joke kind like Boris Johnson ICU visit. Trump riding around hospital car Covid getting quickly emboldened supporters thing joke.

Hopefully treatment similar Tamiflu something get doctor comes soon essentially bases covered like kind flu. saw comment recently college kids may start getting first doses soon finish finals. want get first shot month ago opened get laid side effects finals. sure many nationwide, I'll bet there'll chunk.  Thank us whole year. can't even imagine difficult must been. states incentivize vaccine like West Virginia has. Frustrating see people get vaccine it’s available all

West Virginia rolled program all. something that's mooted, appear hemming hawing details. Unnecessary safety, huge waste plastic millions millions patients harms environment. CDC OSHA say gloves needed. did, would wager could gotten comparable tech number firms working mRNA vaccines. firms heard of, capability produce nearly scale.

The reason Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine common good production distribution. going produce roughly 3x much Moderna, makes mRNA vaccine. BioNTech, Pfizer really, really good do. see. guess could equate drafted. military liable die unless prove negligence like unnecessary friendly fire assassination rival soldier. I’m sick long term safety argument. never criteria FDA approval vaccines. HPV approved 6 months phase III trial data less half number participants Pfizer’s. lines happening Brazil even happening America. know people say younger patients getting sick US older ones vaccinated, that's definitely factor, could factors play here. 1. effect them, much adults.
2. stop community spread
3. evidence vaccinations much effective prior infection preventing re-infection.

I'm afraid fantasy Covid becoming newly emerging common cold coronavirus - far basis science - crushed vaccines. longer gap jabs benefits AZ efficacy making extended intervals double win nations use it. need reality TV show bunch people agree hang unmasked covid patient rooms day, compare happens safe stuck home.  know America related thread, countries tackle issue they’ve begun ramping vaccinations? Europe full people hold anti-vaxx views Americans. 

French people anti-vaxx people world. shitshow happens countries? Vaccines already required many jobs. It’s new idea. liability implies could’ve done something prevent it. Opting pretty easy, happens medical religious reasons today. health orgs let people opt personal choice. require employees wear masks throughout flu season. isn’t new concept. people got vigilant, US could become like India now...

... Wait, no. Biden became incumbent, almost forgot. no, US would get bad anyway. Maryland highly-educated state, dude.  state I'm Brit earliest I've heard anyone planning fly Europe end July. there's plenty time EU jabbing catch :) Yes, heard suggest paying everyone gets vaccinated allowing privileges unvaccinated get. can’t ignore fact drop nicely coincides announcement news.

I disagree. point, either. people trust/want shot twist data fit belief, matter says. Let's pretend know sure issues indeed caused vaccine make easy. frequency rare issue speed, even trial 500,000 people likelihood nobody would run problem. issue rarity. proof would safer get vaccine not. Even thats case, referring possible subsequent covid infection.

So able provide evidence covid back sep-oct know?

Like I'd antibodies covid infection happened that.

I exposed close proximity covid positive people, work public likely antibodies regardless.

But know, spitballing, evidence back up.  means strong immune system strong immune response. Probably younger. mild fever day felt like hell. vaccine -- bodies response 100mg known antigen whatever Modi huge crook failed prime minister. Vote out. unvaccinated could spread among — you, smartly got shot Yes. Nobody cares Canadian dude Pfizer larger player partnership also one charge commercialization. companies shown competently managed trials logistics really worth. course logistics trial management help mRNA tech start with. front, Pfizer clearly got lucrative technology-transfer jumpstart. think employers require vaccines problem. make liable anyone negative side effects. require drug testing vaccines stretch. problem many people (including media portrayal) conflate vac hesitancy anti-vax. implies people hesitant can't incentivized getting it...which incorrect. need start coming good incentives move needle. I'm talking cases hospitalizations vacuum, I'm talking relationship changed time. Lol, think this, OP 16 older. road driving person can't figure band aid appropriate time take off.  right thing do. better err side caution.  Wife got second round shots Monday. 9month old don’t see approved age group. would need know? rule allows wear mask vaccinated matter near vaccinated unvaccinated people outside. would fair say government bailout likely possible also primary income country? wanted point saying simple saying corrupt government going wishes citizens.  can't imagine suspicion, doubt, conspiracy beliefs swayed 5 dollar coupon. Lol. Good Target though.  Yeah nothing went wrong last time estimated virus. Can’t imagine someone would want cautious finally pulling mess. 1. [Polling showing expect around 70% eligible That's national average, many states better 70%. ones lower ones never restrictions first place.
3. numbers seem improving time. see millions people get vaccine without problems, think makes little likely trust it. gets full authorization (not emergency), think even people get it. Especially colleges, employers, etc., require soon gets full authorization agree. help rumor Chicago keep mask mandate place next year so. many companies going see things ""fully open"" mask mandate still place. states without mask mandate see big spike summer think they'll able keep justifying mandate. folks hard keep dreams hold year so?

just rest world manages get clutches fucking virus? vaccine technically prevents infection. epidemiologists say that, mean, ""vaccines speed immune response people even notice symptoms, transmission low cannot measured.""

Suddenly there's ton antivaxers minimal 10th grade biology education looking gotchas pretending revelation.

Your assertion polio vaccine prevents infection (a reproduction virus cells) false.

Heck, vaccine ever triggered uniform immune response across population. That's immune system works.

Once get firm grounding biology, maybe start talking structure different types viruses mutate readily others immunity lasts longer immunity others. anecdotal, heard individuals previously Covid get rocked pretty hard vaccines since immune system react quickly since already familiar virus. expect okay today worst tomorrow. 5 week lead time anyway /r/cannotwatchscottstots database. friend would need fake identity.  It’s likely clouded fact populous states opened everyone last weeks. percentage entire demographic country wide looks “worse”. Week week changes though look like 16+ groups catch long. sure minority?

Perhaps mean several/most friends feel way. Ah, yes sometimes forget everything backwards way. 7/4 birthday btw (not 7\4) showing headline half, Indonesia. 'Indonesians gangstas! They're making situation worse'

I've Medan airport before. going security, attempting empty water bottle, make sure clear bag &lt;100ml bottles taken out, pull laptop/tablet etc etc (you know, usual airport security procedures). bf told bother, walk through. Indeed, security nothing. Lots security standing around, nothing. 

When landed Singapore, Singapore Airport security actually job. actually everywhere. search seychelles vaccines google. reason why? New York Times [just came really good looking rate dropped around time pause, lots graphs. highly suggest checking out. Tl;dr pause major factor, saw slow coming. Saying ""this pandemic good me"" (which writer effectively says one point) surefire way lose room.  Yeah exactly. problem tell people don’t need wear mask vaccinated separate people vaccinated vs vaccinated. people refuse get vaccinated also ones think Covid isn’t really think masks aren’t necessary. It’s far easier apply mask mandates say everyone needs wear them. Plus, vaccine 90% effective scientific backup justify masks too. Vaccines take years approve wait long term side effects, process takes longer urgent past year. corners cut, red tape cut. companies applied authorization meetings FDA happened soon humanly possible, rarely case that's made possible fast. like usually get great results vaccines sit around wait see cause cancer years later, that's what's happening. wrong say take years approve study long term side effects. stated multiple times pretty much vaccine side effects happen within 6 weeks getting shot happen (and FDA definitely required amount time go approval could granted). Vaccines cause cancer make people drop dead two years later, even seen that? vaccine caused people get serious illness years line nothing comes first months? know vaccine cure cancer? See could say anything possible usually people make assumptions based absolutely nothing. can't sure, also can't sure give superpowers can't sure bread got store laced chemical kill you. There's always risk science says likely going fine fear either based nothing small percentage cases (like blood clots) makes sense fear (unless course fear getting struck lightning unlikely events, least consistent). year bottom 6th? Come MLB, gotta make games faster. else would except vaccine? 

Why unvaccinated people gathering church? understanding vaccines less effective variants. That's troubling even provide coverage them. 

It's ""fear peddling"" accurate.  could also ask China, Russia, India vaccines manufacture free well... agree. covid vaccine path reopening safely. knee-jerk reaction comparison flu (lots disinfo peddlers comparing covid flu bad faith) seems like agree 100%.

People seem understand vaccine works establishing herd immunity there's small chance ANYONE exposed virus, vaccinated not. want make ""every person themselves"" kind thing, can't, fates intertwined. vaccine greatly reduce odds illness *individual* gets vaccine, way actually end pandemic get *enough people vaccinated overall*.

The point would disagree need bring cases 0. theory isolated pockets infection parts country vast majority us enjoy protection herd immunity--like still occasional outbreaks measles whooping cough anti-vax communities, since vast majority nation immune, concern national scale (yet). Same, scheduled wife's, mother-in-law's, wife's aunt's shots, always awake midnight new slots opened up. almost 2yo. She’ll get many friends!!  sounds like major disservice people India. don’t understand wold refuse help, even “compatibility issues”. Yeah didn’t even feel needle. knew weird, felt like didn’t actually give felt soreness hours later. I'm glad included Alex Berenson's antivaxxer-isms there.

Honorable mentions go literally anything said Osterholm 2021, plus Dr. Walensky's ""impending doom"" comments March. read sarcasm rather sensationalism Coronaviruses around decades, hence -19, means version discovered 2019. We’ve already vaccines prior versions thus head start/knowledge base. get shots done it. Stop sitting sidelines part help us get back normal.  afraid fantasy Covid becoming newly emerging common cold coronavirus - far basis science - crushed vaccines.

It's obviously going common cold virus, since cause common cold, given spread worldwide last 2 weeks first 6 months pandemic, expect see antigen drift occur given worldwide vaccine shortage seem going anywhere coming years, I'm afraid complete eradication even sustained full control given we'd like be. 100% yes vaccinate 8 year old No, he's right. They'll lining tell us bad Besides reasons, people infected means variants variants gives us chance herd immunity Six up, come on! 
Let’s get 2021 school year!!! Comparing problematic. Seychelles less 100k pops. Many cases could tourists too. Although - according Seychelles almost 100times bigger Israel similar amount active cases. never specified game DH talking about, thus assume game 2 “doses manufacturer” information available Seychelles? Bloomberg article posted OP says this, appears contradict April 12, 59% doses administered Sinopharm vaccines rest Covishield, version AstraZeneca Plc’s shot made license India.

I’m trouble finding information this.

Your comment also suggests 140,000 doses given out, available data find seems suggest 127,721 May 3rd (e.g. [Our World I'm india rn thank :) Yah sure. it’s worth I’m Canada experience way different US (less deaths &amp; cases far lockdown Ontario). Generally speaking people chomping bit go back normal, seems far less hesitancy vaccine. Tough really answer. CDC data incomplete based best guesses, changes year. 12 80k die around 30m people get sick flu year. contrast covid, around 30m cases 600k deaths thus far (again, that’s really hard number accurately account for.) Maybe better way discuss numbers hospital “feels.” Every year hospitals plan surge respiratory illnesses winter months. pediatric places whole floors open winter. 2017 bad year flu hospitals “felt” really strained. Covid different two reasons. Er volumes dropped record lows. Everyone terrified getting one came er bullshit (30% everything er bullshit). This, coupled mandatory stopping elective procedure, put quick dramatic financial strain hospitals. Hospitals businesses reacted trying cut staff save money. Meanwhile, covid decimated elderly population. Early (March/April) people saw er old, nursing home, chronically ill. died slow deaths took space hospital. general course covid different say flu pneumonia. cases people die quickly get better days. Covid-19 pts would linger month finally dying. So, decrease revenue/staff prolonged course covid led shifting nursing staff (they would travel find new work) thus hospitals rooms. hear hospitals capacity, really doesn’t mean don’t physical space, it’s don’t nurses staff patients. 
So flu seasons sorta planned feel busy, manageable. Less people die it’s generally quicker hospitals beds. Covid became financial disaster pandemic time.  think get vaccination card Yes database. least NYC one. hate idea. hate know health insurance companies go road. we’re dealing companies arbitrarily removed dental eye related health issues outside core “health” policies qualm building financially ludicrous system based conditions like this. give another inch take another mile. people don’t want contribute death others. source?  Thanks depth alternative look this. 
I feel slightly confident brethren’s overall mathematical competence. 

Also, pumped many great burger choices days. mandatory attached benefits seem COVID denier conspiracy theorist.

Seriously, friend. Stop think here. Look wrong last year. anything try less wrong year? Well. Enjoy covid then, India. Could also use India’s inactivated virus goes climbing pandemic, Idiots thats who. Right, that's different ""choking non vaccinated"" public space. dickhead like leader go heights suppress freedom speech impose Dictator like environment. country like USA gets know dirty things ground, face international backlash. That's stunts. People dropping dead like flies govt wants splurge luxuries , lockdown. pay get flu shot. seem short-sighted case, probably thought could roll old promo would easy peasy. 
On positive side, get Ibuprophen way door? possible mutate inside vaccinated person? 

Considering fact still catch spread even vaccinated know, you’re good company. kids stay separated kids vaccinated. hang friends family fully vaccinated. I’m willing risk them. bad parent trying keep son safe. aren’t easy decisions wish people would stop jerks it. point US send package whether Modi likes not. Unchecked infections country would make breeding ground variants would eventually develop immune escape variant threatening whole world. definitely changing gears - first time went vaccinated friends uncrowded place food drinks, felt incredibly uncomfortable. should. Don’t feel need keep mouth shut. I’m anymore. I’m going smile nice tone use casual “you know heard?” voice call present perspective / knowledge. Don’t angry rude forceful (they’re probably going change mind anyway) don’t say anything either.

They take leave they’re going open stupidity selfishness get open facts perspective.  lot colleges mandating enrollment coming Fall. big chunk. I'm sure big schools States like Florida Texas though. Roughly 70% either vaccinated say they're likely get vaccinated.

But that's country-wide. lot southern states dragging average, states probably get 75-80%

Also, longer people see vaccines working well, likely people trust them. Theres way injecting kids w vax least year, ever. im definitely minority  Capitalist America never ceases amaze me.  well explained Upon Time Life... look bad, although hospitalizations age 50 rising. Yes, looks like universities Illinois still going require masks fall semester regardless someone vaccinated not. depending close DC, check CVSs district! able schedule second shot dc problem. (hint: instead putting zip code, search ‘Washington, dc’ website. reason works better) Ok get people nobody anyway ""we already knew this"". governments rules always going cautious actually scenario big step. Wow, what's crazy seem hearing UK, hear occasionally Brazil loads news India moment. 

Are health care systems bursting seams Japan countries? Hardly anyone even eligible get vaccine yet. frustrating. slow approve vaccines here, part issue. hope get vaccinated next year. 😅
Getting tested difficult, too. Doesn’t match vaccine used 65% effective found trials? Seems like expected result  bold claim? *shrug* sure COVID kill X number human beings make sick, overwhelming hospitals destroying economy. 

Take peek India want something actually afraid of. Trust experts. Anyone vulnerable enough time get vaccine protected.  kids camp won’t already vaccine kids! Maybe impenetrable shield, vaccines found greatly reduce one's ability get spread it. can't act like risk vaccinated person catching Covid zero, real world data far shows pretty darn close, CDC reporting 9,000 breakthrough cases. Yeah, still catch spread disease, probably won't. We've living lives normally well last year anyway low risk death/serious issues children Covid-19 infections *so much* higher risks vaccine. rarely got flu vaccine yearly checkup started providing it. grabbed first available covid vaccine. plumbers repairs done last weeks, one company wore masks others not. I’m vaccinated, one home, didn’t bother personally, it’s probably risky work close quarters they’re vaccinated themselves. 

It’s weird knowing expect types situations now, guidance changing, everyone different comfort levels issue masks. mine. bad mental health combined lot coping skills acquired years deal it, actually brilliantly. Almost high percentage supports healthcare all, livable wages, cheap college end foreign occupation wars resources. Joe Biden Republican. 100% agree. wife issue needles, luckily really nice nurse national guard doses. Although pretty funny story. first shot, felt barely anything. second however, different experiences. happy chose table 2 instead table 3 was.

Her national guard guy friendly, asking life. We're renovating attic, asked that. nurse handed vaccine card like ""oh, I'm done?""

My situation completely different. national guard guy pointed questions sheet paper, even say ""would answer yes these?"" Nope, point. question one loudly sighed. asked vaccine card. gave looked dead eye said (this direct quote, rediculous wrote forget) ""Really? sure supposed getting second dose?"" confused. handed card nurse, even like ""it says second dose, dont know."" Like seriously?? would lie getting first shot? one people, doubt I'd get second shot. nurse. seperate conversation nurse break. asked arm wanted, clearly paying attention since right sleave rolled up. told right, sat down, right arm facing her. turned said (again direct quote) ""Sir sleave needs rolled facing me."" Pointing left arm. responded wanted right. sighs goes ""fine."" warning jabs arm. shot hurt like hell. 

100% would get again. county sent survey afterwards asking it, describing muscle aches, made sure put even knowing would treated, nothing gonna stop us getting vaccine. I'll admit though, pain probably ready. top that, momentary thing. Like, yeah hurt, 5 seconds later back dull ache.

The pain knowing could potentially save peoples lives yet refuse bare minimum, hurts way shot. nobody goes 22:00?

fact vaccinated people allowed meet contact restrictions curfews, still absolutely idea actually get shots Ah yes, course. I'm assuming product actually licensed production elsewhere. otherwise (ie, license it, upon approval) madness, original producers would still receive royalties profit licensed production elsewhere. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article many idiots still feasible. Yeah headline *garbage*. flu shot (as long medically able so) travel sounds totally reasonable????? wish gyms NC would institute type vaccination pass.

Masks big deal cases tired struggling breath running treadmill. simple thing solve though. answer delay vaccines get covid shot, boosters like get 0 protection immediately miss shot 4 weeks.

Not able get shots due covid vaccine valid medical reason even rules need adjustment. agree, tying set goal better honor system policy trying nationally. ""Pretty please guys listen science get shots, meantime restrictions lifted enforcing mandates anyway, need proof vaccination anything, yeah basically"" Yes, also reminder massive US is:

- US: 328 million
- UK: 66 million
- Germany: 83 million
- France: 67 million
- Italy: 60 million
- Spain: 47 million

All US countries mentioned? 323, less US still! Could average COVID hospital patient younger before, therefore staying hospitalized longer?

IOW, hospitalization staying stubbornly high *because* deaths dropping? agree. Osterholm intentional scare tactic wrong too. owes apology. risk problem covid zero. try math. One six million greater zero. that's actual averse reaction rate. way averse reactions stupid J&amp;J blood clot distractions. leaving two large groups, people nothing lazy.

Maybe missing link J J, pause probably killed vaccine. Americans stupid see nuance caused pause, assume bad you. really hope wrong meet goal July Pfizer could partnered numerous vaccine candidates there. there's guarantee would achieved efficacy, though. 

similarly biontech could partnered pharmaceutical companies. there's guarantee hit clinical/manufacturing pitfalls though, like jnj/azn. 

it's partnership companies enjoy. calling Pfizer-Biontech vaccine (or vice versa) best way so. I'm sure order particularly matters.  Seems like bad precedent me. Next week expectation reports. It’s hard wonder would happened never paused J&amp;J vaccine.

The numbers post pause abysmal  (USA) 3rd wave. horrific, mitigated. Wishing best. Stay safe there. Self-survival codified genes

To point time we're obviously social/herd animals like apes. There's reason people ""I fully self-sufficient"" mentality bitter angry. emerging target difficult one hit. something like coronavirus comes scene, there’s plenty (hopefully informed) guesswork involved. saw repeatedly early days pandemic, health officials downplaying threat, warning people using masks generally giving advice that, even within months, became rather criticized comments used question advice officials top federal infectious-disease expert Anthony S. Fauci, worst punditry issue came later on, gravity situation became clear officials. came sought question severity virus name keeping economy open or, basic level, appealing people didn’t want believe major half million U.S. deaths later coronavirus cases spiking alarmingly India despite advent vaccines, it’s worth look back forcefully suggested wasn’t truly bad — suggested much, actually predicted it.

… serious note, needle covid shot really small even feel compared tdap flu shots example. said taking bandaid much painful. closed region. company makes capacity 20 million doses month. India alone demand 1 billion doses. think licensed company. get sick choose to?   agree.

Joe awesome! Go back cave, Doyle. testing India important? people different physiology compared every continent/country? Put ads TikTok. says 70% adults want get vaccinated? I'm sure that's oversight, meant 70% adults want vaccinated. Surely that. sherpas also collectively said ""no, wont help anyone"" year would also stopped this. doubt many sherpas local maybe assumption wrong. 

It corrupt government work here. pfizer moderna approve vaccines younger children (2-12 range), get kids vaccinated? We’re currently vaccinated, I’m little nervous letting children get vaccine bit history base decision especially given minimal effect covid younger kids. rational? would great onion article, OP mass conspiracy spamer truly believes sort thing.

I work hospitality Bay Area. work norm wear masks outdoors, many clients parts California norm.

People often confused difference ask legal outside without mask here. tell legal outdoor space six feet people, narrow sidewalks often possible stay six feet away passersby, considered polite wear mask around town.

I’m curious know many people getting virus vaccinated. 400 cases yesterday 62% 98,000 people fully vaccinated, that’s say lot getting virus vaccine.  give blood, I'm told leave bandage 2 hours. use way bigger needle (that deliberately poke vein) vaccination.

PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY, that's work. desperate $5 off??  2 bad sad, someone capable wearing mask travel. everyone else put risk?? Imagine average idiot street. realize half people walking around dumber guy! Paraphrasing George Carlin. 

The common person well informed, media savvy internet user.   Fake misleading news like thumb rule indian govt data read Lakh Million much higher premiums? wouldn’t necessarily higher premiums overweight much like smokers pay higher premiums. say someone overweight.

The antivaxxers drag society and, frankly, need make feel it. won’t forever people work vaccinated. Vaccinated families meeting indoors without masks weeks now. spreading among vaccinated population mostly among children teens?  Here's thing - 

If adult taken vaccine now, decided take it. can’t rationalize irrational people.  work home use zoom part meeting. don’t attend person partnership. Neither pfizer biontech could achieved achieved far without others help  median incubation period 8 days according recent research, boyfriend symptoms 6 days first dose, decent chance caught vaccination.  feel politicians general longer interest compromise. us-vs-them.

Running country competition. citizens end losing. Ever since J&amp;J fiasco, LOT folks might gotten vaccine changed minds ""A recent study"".... Im  Impressive they've done well. remember looking Bloomberg tracker, quite WV Mississippi top percentage doses used. Washington state near bottom since governor hoarding doses keep emergency powers longer. isn’t telling China shutting city millions people. 

This may variant vaccines used already shown less effective South Africa.  I’m male. probably looked data UK correctly came conclusion delaying second shot months right way go supply shortage. worked me. made appointment knowing nothing,  told one minute gave me. 

I've also friends ask doctor's one get, doctors say research make decision (!!!).

Newsflash: people trusting vaccines. exactly accurate. 2 weeks first shot, 80% covered. Bumps mid 90% 2 weeks 2nd shot. certainly immunity kicks well second shot. Amadou Diallo, 52, screenwriter, worries people lie received vaccine endanger others.

Then get vaccinated yourself? Nothing, feels like BioNTech first developed it.  Ewww... cutting trees city parks burn bodies. 3K extra deaths day bud. makes 1, less likely get it. 2, get you’re waaay less likely severe symptoms. 3, you’re less likely spread it. doesn’t give full immunity make virus way less issue. champing* bit  problem incentive structure fucked. really wanna light fire tell restaurants seat capacity vaccine passported people staff vaccinated. perfectly good carrot refusing put stick. lot sympathy places yoloing everything open ones keeping things closed absent individual vaccine pass.

I think it'd much good though.

Literally point. I’ve probably COVID since I’ve working warehouse entire pandemic, haven’t sick LONG time. love idea, ready bet institute work topic like 10 years, budget cut down, XX years next global pandemic occur nobody working anymore. I'm excited! autoimmune child, can't take risks gather normally I've seen families do. I'm excited kids able see friends, family, go back school, kids! going eat bridal shower? are, think point moot.

Wearing mask walk taking eat pure theater.

I would course bring mask case rules stop elsewhere, stress it.  mean, think good intentions sanctions embargos would make things worse people India, mention powerful - part, truly democratic - ally, important combination factors.

But seriously wtf modi Honestly best idea I've heard regards paying people get vaccine. way contest instead ""bribe"" health autorities currently imposing 20% capacity cap churches Greater Seoul 30% elsewhere ( regardless vaccination.)

My colleague said Indian bureaucracy legendary slow molasses without high ups moving things along, take long time anything. 

He said, sadly surprised supplies sitting Delhi hopefully press attention, Prime Minister Modi apply pressure get things moving. That's new information me, entirely!

I guarantee never happen! Congratulations! Getting second one tomorrow.

Also: thank daily vaccination summaries. official government bureaucratic approval change people's minds seeing millions people world vaccinated convince them?

I get it, guess right people. scheduled mine wife’s shot. Feel like outlier now. dad scheduled too. yeah think everyone else know wife did. Every time look milestones seems pulling ahead though. 
I really hope things come together summer end. 
Even one shot school starts would solid. 
Or, maybe kids found *need* one shot? Ohhhhh unfortunate hear. Damn! really rooting WV back seeing positive headlines efforts. anti-vaxxer.

WEEOOO WEEEOOOO ALERT ALERT WEEEOO concerned covid vaccines fast tracked approval.

If keep going--about 98,000/day, current 7-day average--we'll administer enough doses hit 70% 18+ population 2 doses mid-June.

We'll see plays out, unrealistic say we'll get 70% adults fully vaccinated. saying attended grandmother's funeral occured 13 days 2nd dose even though full vaccine efficacy happen 2 weeks 2nd dose? crazy.

My state (Connecticut) saw huge surges last spring winter, summer 2020 positivity rates consistently 1% entire days covid deaths.

Michigan's surge happened cool, late-winter/early-spring weather people would gathering indoors more. Many viruses spread easier colder weather, indoor transmission significantly higher too.

South Carolina getting 70-80^(o)F summer right now, basically ideal weather keeping people outside. harsh truth I’ve learned pandemic general, nurses don’t know fuck they’re talking about.

You're missing bunch crucial things looking way.

Throughout entire pandemic, overall incidence rate getting covid ~30%, 90% infections. also likely even infected become less infectious someone unvaccinated infected due lower peak viral load. fairly reasonable call person something closer 94%. household attack rate 16% non-spouse members household.

Assuming somehow vaccinated whole time, chances one vaccinated person getting covid giving someone else household throughout entire pandemic ends being:

0.3(incidence) * 0.06(VE * (0.16 household attack rate) "" (0.9 2) = 0.00028 * 100% = 0.03% chance household secondary transmission two vaccinated people throughout whole pandemic.

For one time interaction, would use community's current Infection prevalence likely percent point, let's say high 2.5%. We'll also keep attack rate even though brief interaction living someone, pessimistic:

0.025(incidence) * 0.06(VE * (0.16 household attack rate) "" (0.9 2) = 0.00028 * 100% = 0.0024% chance transmission one time visit two vaccinated people community extremely high incidence.

These numbers also going bit off, closer multiplying is, infinitely closer saying 10% chance somehow.

They’re own. government step find research can’t help concerned India variant wrecking Nepal. variant spreads US would completely different spot. absolute gong show government running there. People dying they're offered help. People really like getting upset every possible opportunity. guess OP still feeling salty gotten first dose yet; time everyone 18 3 weeks away eligible. People need chill bit. Absolutely. Pharmacies handing shot walk-ins daily basis even now. Theyre going turn anyone away. think viral vector vaccines stop spread, would slow mutations.

I personally think people get worked mutations. Mutations usually go direction less deadly people keep walking around spreading them.

So far, mutations neutralized mrna vaccine. likely true forever, could likely true years. virus spreading worldwide year huge number fresh victims human animal kingdom altered significant enough way yet. anti-mask friend regularly stopped stores asked wear mask. says “no mask today, thanks,” walks on. store pursues except Container Store. Probably shunted rich leaving poor suffocate die outside hospitals they've gone help. 

Just disgusting. Yeah, I'm ""afraid of"" would show proof full vaccination enter places, something wouldnt unless get J&amp;J soon get there. home state set goal 50%. we'll need 90% equal-sized state get back track! 80% state twice large! Check cvs easy see availability. filter rapid pcr. PCR took two days get results take five days beleive. Rapid call like half hour after. experience rapid harder find usually find 2-3 days current day pcr find next day usually. accept help it’s actual ally nation actually help? 

this question answered consider ""extremely stupid impossible scenario"". imagine true, go though emotions whether would allow Chinese military ground.

once understand feels like, would understand concern Indian perspective.

if choose dismiss hypothetical scenario hand without opening mind even one second, even eloquent reply enough answer quoted question. Alright, we'll wait significant mutation, becomes world problem again. Sounds good... /s No. vaccine works even get symptoms. *cries Mets fan*  basic reproduction number (R0) used quantify infectivity virus. value expected amount infections generated single case infection virus given population, assuming everyone susceptible infection immunity-naïve. also considers absence non-pharmaceutical intervention methods. such, number change outbreak progresses, represents exponential growth rate.

Alternatively, effective reproduction number (Rt) time-variable, value regularly see revised news. number considers level immunity already present within population, addition intervention methods responsible reducing transmission rate. value drops 1, herd immunity achieved number cases gradually decrease infections present within population.

For comparison, SARS-COV-2 R0 value around 2.4 3.4, whereas influenza estimated 1.2 1.4. Although values appear similar, need remember value exponential growth rate viral transmissibility, SARS-COV-2 actually considerably infectious. Measles, mumps, rubella R0 value 12 18, 10 12, 6 7, respectively. know much norovirus, [but found research article suggests R0 value norovirus ranges 1.1 7.2, value 2 population-based estimates, increases depending particular is.   think 2022 2023 fair assessment according unprofessional opinion. Logistically, world whole still huge undertaking get vaccinated less developed poorer countries need time, resources, help getting done. verstehe ich nicht? Warum du Verschwörungsmythen verbreitest denen du anderen Leuten ihre Leistungen absprichst weil du auf sie wegen ihrer Herkunft herab blickst und aus dir selbst nie geworden ist? Das muss ich auch gar nicht verstehen. likely effective picturing. people worried others walking around unvaccinated, get vaccine. vaccinated unmasked even around people unvaccinated unmasked hell lot safer masked unvaccinated like 6 months ago. Got second dose yesterday, and...no side effects! Turns needlessly freaked past week lot people seem understand rollout works all. know confusing areas, approval mean they're suddenly going start vaccinating kids! September? waiting for?

Shoot, I'd pay pocket get friends vaccinated want give biggest pat back existence.  Seems case across country, least local news reporting well. I'm peculiar situation I'm sure anyone really answer. I'm US got AstraZeneca vaccine (Trial participant). wondering, if/once places start requiring proof vaccinations, encounter issues? CDC card like everyone else letter SF department health stating got real vaccine.

I really expect anyone answer speculation, curious others thought. “Traveler”? China accepting anyone except foreign workers year. Even process lengthy, expensive, hinges many factors beyond applicants’ control (e.g., flight licenses suspended two/four weeks depending whether previous flights brought corona-positive passengers in).

If you’ve vaccinated Chinese-made vaccine visa application process new hires slightly less onerous, good luck getting anywhere West. slow science can(!) work? believe April 2020 already something lamas versus corona Pretend undocumented ask vaccine. I’m sure get one NYC. rate spread going highly dependent non-pharmaceutical interventions like mask wearing requirements lockdowns. studies produced range possible results varied multiple orders magnitude depending degree duration NPIs. 2-3 million probably used upper limit show would happen little NPIs. That's basically 0.5-1% IFR assuming entire population infected pretty reasonable made efforts limit spread COVID-19. India major ally US

You give shit Russia, well vaccine diplomacy game, using example countries doing. Pretty much.

Though viral vector vaccines save lives, don’t seem stop virus spreading mutating.

The mRNA vaccines however appear actually stop infections spread virus. could schools. believe thats used vaccines. Priority queue understandable, that's FDA Approval process fast track / breakthrough therapy / accelerated approval / priority review designations. 

But Emergency Use Authorization process significantly differs regular approval process, requires less data, criteria loosened, reviews less rigorous, yet we're told people who's expertise reason doubt vaccines less safe other. demand alone explain cumbersome process approval exists begin could achieve results safety-concern-wise way less bloated process. go Target flu vaccine every year.

Thank explanation. could hardly believe massive jump daily new cases, makes sense now. US releasing blockade supplies. 

I find unrealistic releasing IPs help. would certainly increase capacity hundred million low income nations, actual big pharma companies would scale back capacity increase plans. may lead redistribution vaccines.

India perfect example. government extremely strict pricing testing Covaxin barely produced. issue supplies, India would converting factories pump now. not. It’s cause government won’t really fund profit margins sketchy, point companies charging poor citizens. wouldn’t accept don’t need it,

yeah, question is, really needed it? hypothetical scenario?

what earliest available treatment SARS-COV-2 blood transfusion Chinese national lived life within Chinese borders (absurd, know, make specific point) - precondition providing treatment country send soldiers across tapped?

would accept help conditions? would prefer spend time exploring alternate avenues involve foreign military soil? see mask mandate September? Man hope so. optimistic got second shot seems like rather pointless. Nothing life changed. still WFH. Still need masks everywhere go. Sporting events restaurants still require masks capacity limits. That’ll definitely change. June foresee situation dramatically improved lasting restrictions mid summer IMO. assure 1-3% kids get hospitalized lmao. like .1% probably lower. says 100% York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced May 5 press conference Broadway shows, shut year due coronavirus pandemic, would reopen 100 percent capacity beginning September 14. added tickets would go sale beginning May 6. anyone link research regarding risks mRNA vaccine delivery? friend hesitant get vaccine listening podcast Bret Weinstein I'd like point research newer delivery method (specifically long term risks due use lipid nanoparticles). going let loose lot bees malls etc let chase Covid patients public? Sounds like dangerous game. Please put legitimate source many vaccines Russia donated. I’ve tried looking. found sources saying they’ve donated much anything. done made deals many low income nations, haven’t really made donations outside nations agreed live staff vaccinated tests phase 3 data approved, three countries. That’s dumb ignorant question ask. Lifting IP blocking supplies two entirely separate issues. 

The US released blockade supplies. 

And you’re going question millions extra vaccines would help.... 70% adults vaccinated single digit number friends social distancing celebrate 4th! know people asymptotic therefore reject vaccine. Yeah, that's enough steps away anyone bullshitting.

I'm saying happen - bells palsy absolutely occurs. 2 people given JnJ 2 people given placebo trial 4000 people. mean... Yeah.


People suck, general, thinking temporally correlated event causation. Reality is, likely much common vaccine daily life. still acknowledge inflammation event may potentially increase risk extremely rare slightly less extremely rare. another user said, US military best world logistics anything. get rapid response team area less 12 hours. allies it’s poison challace, India simply lot ppl need help obviously break healthcare system, budget like US military 700bil dollar, highest budget world. don’t types orgs rabid respond issues. military used for, top war fighting force, it’s rapid response disasters. far know

Lol first thing video shows you’re dead wrong. 

I ask, many people saying vaccine production could massively produced, ignore them? matter time start hear triple-double mutants! ;) Really, wow. hope USA get there. think we'll need adolescents it. get vaccinated ball parks games, Governor Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday.

It’s bit different. smoking, you’re discounted _don’t_ something. vaccinations, _do_ something, intrusive gets bad follow promise make sure vaccine intellectual property. So, even get everyone vaccinated, it'll still affect poor countries, mutate, come back forever.

Likely benefit pharma companies, living large government money now, happily charge us yearly vaccinations COVID becomes normal part life thanks cooperation US government ensure that. mean, continue literally pandemic enough people keep dying.

Fun times working public health :) sums nicely. Everything know expect pathogen may mutate becomes less relevant give chances usually accounted Germany? enough people probably get vaccinated. things op safer though, like visiting vaccinated friends. masking must go we're normal. Lmao middle east Asia Ah, okay. get saying now. Yeah, trying play imitation game wildly different national circumstances work well anyone :(  idk you’re downvoted you’re right. Pfizer research. government offset 100% risk manufacturing. also know good portion group, may first time coordinating health appointments, willing nimble creative process, see humanitarian gesture, motivated epidemiology , economics geopolitical consideration.

The longer infection persist third world, greater chance escape variants rising. think readers want continually take booster covid-19 shots every six months rest lives.

Of course one argue remove IP, create disincentive produce vaccines. often pandemic like Covid-19 come about? think US military cared IP protections WW2?

Secondly, many Western economies/business dependent business Third World. ranges international students studying Western universities, orders Boeing / Airbus planes, etc. amount Western tax payers money goes researching vaccines peanuts compared revenue lost activities. 

Thirdly, right lot poorer countries dependent Chinese vaccines. necessarily cost, availability. larger developing countries capability produce vaccines, even research (aka Kazakhstan Thailand) fantastic effort, limited incomprehensible stupidity millions people. Pfizer come anything recently? India’s government: didn’t think this? Reminds people argue someone confused India asia. tells India Middle East. leaders like live palaces Ah yes, stupid virus. right. get tested repeatedly tell it.

Tired today arm bit sore, otherwise reaction. link doesn’t support said. shows 49% support probably getting vaccine lowest legend. That’s lot higher 10% 20% said before. states much higher percentage, according map. strongly suggest reconsider choosing define “intelligent.”

Plenty stupid people getting vaccinated, intelligent people refusing vaccine. coworker mid 20’s, health nut, medical conditions early COPD due COVID. hits everyone differently. Know several others healthy 40-60 age range kinds problems post COVID despite pretty minimal symptoms. It’s strange virus attacks certain bodies despite healthy are.  But, chances vaccinated people catching Covid becoming seriously ill, ending hospital, dying? It’s enough ask chances “getting it” vaccination, chances anything mild symptoms statistically insignificant. Yeah honestly need vaccinate 110% people /s Wait hear backlash would ""invasion medical privacy"". agree need proof vaccination traveling internationally way many people would lie make fake vaccine cards get bars places. Canadian would embarrassed 70% adults vaccinated July 4. happened US? Hopefully low vaccination rates come back bite you. I'd love come visit sometime sane people signed shots soon possible. unvaccinated left fence sitters anti-vaxxers. personally, love 5G reception get left arm. gonna happen. really wish would many idiots US.

False Get sick potentially spread you, family, neighbors, etc. Vaccination impact individual impacts us community. Shit, Bill Gates could that. He's recently divorced territory, completely reasonable would get huge kudos American public (especially single ladies...) Gloves optional IM shots. It’s like drawing blood. absent last year? Send next round stimulus checks people vaccinated only... felt way second Pfizer. never sick adult. even watch tv sleep, laid misery.  Flu shots aren’t mandatory schooling anything. could $435 million make one person per congressional district  point stand idiots refusing get vaccinated still catching COVID. get immunized way whether want not. catch COVID higher rate take precautions necessary avoid it. It'll interesting see plays out. That’s little bit extreme correlation. Think vaccinations public schooling, drivers license certain age, gambling age, etc. Can’t believe live ageist society. /s Getting first shot Thursday, happier. really feel like I'm living history No. make normal price 2x is, offer vaccinated people coverage half price. make work without running risk legally problematic.  Education standards. worries! Life happens busy making plans. 

If makes feel better, basically lockdown age moved didn’t friends years. lonely. made sad. learn lot myself, liked part it. 


I actually felt similarly lockdown time. get every year. (good) reason to. bruh tuesday like goals. I've missed goals. they’re nearing request approval likely running trials already something point request, I’m up-to-date situation don’t want make claims can’t back probably can't penalty people vaccine. But, could give discount people vaccine. result end. party love, tolerance acceptance speaks again.  loss faith human nature worst part. they're constantly telling people nothing changes get vaccinated, healthy young adults would take it? completely botched messaging it. Yeah, life always perfect. driving. Wisconsin Get up. Walk out. Mid haircut. Find different barber.

Literally, give stupid people business. I’m even exaggerating.

Do give money businesses people anti vax/ignorant/stupid-ass employees. ever happened vaccine protecting applicant?
Since vaccines depended everyone else getting work?

To eradicate disease yes, non-vaxxers ok w getting covid vaccinated protected, what’s problem? feel like 30% country selfish pieces shit wont get vaxxed unless forced reason lot nurses wear gloves give shots? database get vaccine, problem businesses right (nor they) check database. reason government check it. got shot national guard take information computer. free make choices. experience consequences said choices. monetary. Frame however like, still doesn’t make someone otherwise intelligent stupid person. means smart person made objectively stupid decision. Approved FDA fucking hate US much holy shit access life saving vaccine absolutely free fuckers denying premise unfounded side effects

147 million vaccines given US expect vaccine different, somehow side effect covered massive scale. 

or precious DNA change.

or theyre gonna tracked bill gates.

or fucking bullshit.

i dont care dont take root absolute selfishness. Schools use one month. FDA approval arrives 12-15 year olds week next, mass vaccinations could done last two weeks school May. age group excellent demographic either j&amp;j shot 1 1 first week back school August. Man could’ve easy Trump told supporters also got vaccine undecided dinner tomorrow. think virus could answer well? traveling fully vaccinated? Smh... getting second dose Saturday: I'm part! Well isn’t 70% Americans want vaccine, god luck. Yes, BF get first shot Kaiser 2 weeks ago- he's 58. 

Maybe little time people see vaccinated turn zombies, confidence pick up.  even known people local community publicly it, going go get it.

Here link info George Washington ordering military perform first mass innoculation history middle Revolutionary even ask Congress. Ask next Anti-vax fraidy-cat meet hate founding fathers. See say. you’re vaccinated, pandemic effectively you. Covid poses less risk flu. reason CDC organizations overly cautious right lot people still aren’t vaccinated don’t way immediately knowing isn’t. example, said vaccinated people don’t wear masks anymore, something like 70% people wouldn’t wear even aren’t vaccinated yet. It’s principle said “masks don’t work don’t get one” back February 2020 didn’t want shortage healthcare workers. Bro want spend month bed, weak, like 30-year-old brother, still need inhaler year later like 31-year-old friend. want lost sense smell like 33-year-old colleague. (Before even start, healthy, regular weight, active people). people die diseases. still avoid they're misery added life pleasure removed it. wealthiest zip codes highest vaccination rates lowest infection rates (and vice versa). Per zip code, clear negative correlation. 

This bad socioeconomic equity perspective, 'good' epidemiological perspective - overlap vaccinations cases going skew less random sample. Total antibody coverage almost certainly better estimate. percentage adults vaccinated. Hmm, authorisation drug based efficacy / risk trade-off? example, chemotherapy dangerous drug, still approved, people targeted drug, benefit still outweighs risk.

If covid vaccine side effects level chemotherapy, obviously approved, even emergency use, regardless efficacy.

So mean EUA requires bar safety lower bar efficacy? words, benefit clear yet, determine benefit outweighs risk? rambles lot hard tell sounds like that's going change. probably going combo cash bond.

I’m Korean woman. Yeah saw constituted outdoor dining area noped out. went restaurant first time 14 months last weekend, even though I’ve vaccinated since January. sorry that’s fault clear. u/tgunter good job explaining it. would hard believe general public actually \*need\* booster every year. Seniors shown waning immunity health care workers highly exposed. probably overkill rest us can't imagine get much greater uptake flu shot would average year.

I’m sure Pfizer sharing data regular meeting Health Authorities countries shipping drug. normal situations standard. I’m sure much amped emergency.  probably right. I'm nervous metro exactly booming much higher rate state overall. noticed second shot site empty (and 3 weeks day opened everyone). actually advertising main street driving they'd take drop visits. 

I think metros better rural areas overtime, hoping see something closer CA opening full public seemed stimulate 3-4 week surge rather like 1 week swift drop off. areas people flying in/out connected metros make sense push higher metro coverage try avoid spread rural sorrounding regions there. India, relatively poor country population 1.355 billion sizeable domestic vaccine production famously set produce stuff west cheaply.

I think reason they've doubled cheaper vaccines like covidshield (which seem production issues AZ does) domestic one. surprise rejecting expensive Moderna/Pfizer jabs. Although may regretting current wave. top post.  Hell, get point start cutting funding state level states hit goals percentage vaccinations population size specific dates. Make ones top squirm clueless constituents costing pork barrel money. think permanently different 2019? thinking permanent hybrid work / school models things too? agree reluctance #1 issue. trust me, live Kansas lot state least hour major medical care -- injection site.

We living 2 different worlds. I’ve wearing masks work indoors since March 2020. I’m RN seeing patients people able hide home. I’ve got issue masks. They’re simply needed outdoors. said, please post instances outdoor transmission last year come across reading research. I’m willing proven wrong, discussion it. haven’t seen real data tracks spread outdoors. I’ve wearing mask walk dog around block past week. covid. think it’s perfectly reasonable wear mask outdoors think it’s ridiculous people like judging others this. Rogan said nothing that's based fact.

For months scientists saying outdoors masking useful since spread low anyway, CDC adopted that.

That massively different Joe ""not doctor"" Rogan saying young people need vaccine scientists doctors said do. Let's hope roll vaccinations elementary middle schools September! I'd love spend next year worrying dreaded quarantine phone call every time phone rings kid's schools. worked hard, get play hard. Call ask, still 2nd shot Eh close enough never locked Spanish Flu friend. fact, first time history "" locked down"" anything society. Unless done time prison. I’m thinking would really good idea US vaccinate entire Canadian population. I’m Detroit literally right across street Canada. Canadians brothers sisters, success pandemic benefits us trade local economic activity too. I’d also suggest Mexico considering close communities southern border are.  pfizer applying month. going really soon. Finally, sensible risk assessment. Agree. think starting build normal life helpful. Grocery stores pharmacies would another good one. give picture insane is, that's equivalent Ontario 13k cases day. Ontario's health care system bursting seams *less* 4k daily cases, hospitals forcibly transferring ICU patients without consent inches away wartime-like triage scenario. can't even imagine hellscape Alberta would 4k daily cases. **SAN ANTONIO** – Walmart Sam’s Club stores across United States expanded access COVID-19 vaccine employees customers.

The retail giants Tuesday announced offer Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pfizer Moderna vaccines people via appointment walk-in.

Texans choose 500 Walmart Sam’s Club pharmacies Lone Star State, according news release.

Walmart Pharmacies open seven days week, Sam’s Club Pharmacies closed Sundays. People wanting get shot Sam’s Club member.

The expansion comes amid effort get Americans inoculated demand vaccines waned.

Employees encouraged required get vaccine. company providing employees two hours paid time get inoculation allowing three days paid leave experiencing side effects.   read anal vaccination hehe read anal vaccination hehe Title bit off. wants 70% getting 1st dose. changed mind? get dude. like wearing masks. Covaxin? Indian vaccine? I’m hoping it’s bad year considering hardly rain (at least Los Angeles area). know version them. find highly unlikely holdouts educated different types vaccines. uninformed. idea ANYWHERE country walk ins.... would say I’m pretty “on top” news

From it’s PR issue. folks get vaccine want one now... need want know get  million dollar lottery per million vaccinated people. $300 million could part $2 trillion stimulus package. People respond incentives money talks  Hard see this. Hopefully situation improves soon. know booster shots/yearly better less sides current 2nd shots. one going sign taking day work year yearly. really doesn't. look county epidemiology page, still shows areas town highest case rates &amp; positive nothing outdoor dining. never did. Haha ok. would Invited sure area. We're going get low mid 60s adults end month going hit wall. point need fight every tenth percentage point that. Judging past weekend Chicago already fully open lol Yeah think take.

Luckily international gateways large cities people traveling stay said cities. It'll tough it'll okay   90% cities fully vaccinated 10% cities wholly unvaccinated

But real world split results country level herd immunity mattering bit ""don't really mean pretty much always apply even 99% America vaccinated.

If 99% America vaccinated, we'd wipe thing relatively short order. communities meaningfully lower level would circulate rapidly achieve herd immunity naturally unable seed cases larger population avenues spread another lower immunity community.

This bell unrung. people aren’t vaccinated now, either lazy brainwashed Deep State Gates microchips. willing get booster wish would stop pandering morons. idiots responsible large percentage deaths U.S. know 3 people died COVID. zero sympathy anyone refusing get vaccine. feel sorry nurses doctors watch COVID denying patients die. It’s awful. used never get flu vaccine flu never bothers much, years ago someone pointed point protect vulnerable, get flu vaccine every year. certainly COVID makes much mindful spread disease vulnerable members society.  consent exposed unnecessarily people dumb enough go things get infected. Ok I'm UK thing everywhere. stuff like infection rate zero, before. Right higher (at least US) height shutdown last spring. private school banned teachers got vaccine? Support not?  need treat people like children. Sad. spend time international spaces seems lot jealousy (not right word) America’s vaccine rollout. Basically Europeans saying it’s fair Americans acted like idiots whole time wouldn’t stop going parties also getting vaccinated first Kano real question terms international travel loads countries vaccines readily available circulating viruses.

Not sure handle pockets unvaccinated people. US logistics near god tier. Canada enough, Mexico needs most. Welp, guess can't force learn better yourself. However, I'm sure think valid opinion anything. Right screaming adults kid's table.  live bumblefuck nowhere Less 0.1% fully vaccinated people [caught small amount.

I hold anybody decides they'd rather wait 3 weeks avoid lot hassle. You’ll hold time lol. You’ll moment everything feels normal again, you’re parties it’ll probably party That’s interesting.  They're probably looking active case numbers lifting restrictions, vaccination rate. two related probably need hard case numbers give advice lifting restrictions.

How foresee something like happening? essentially control private insurers, historically keen discounts wish lucky enough died Pfizer vaccine r/2meirl4meirl Let’s hope so. ‘Murican Patriots frothing mouth guns blazing full rage mode celebrations last 7/4 gay men getting shots?! /s Allegheny County (where Pittsburgh is), today, 70% eligible people least one shot.

Even risk low feels wrong, like ""don't worry kiddo, mommy protected, sucks though. Hope get covid-shingles 20 years!"" mean- that’s j&amp;j important even though it’s slightly less effective. It’s one time deal, takes 5 min inject you. hope soon we’re point pharmacies take walk ins stuff get everyone weird schedule isn’t good planning There’s echo scientific basis this. Risk hospitalization death essentially eliminated following vaccination. Think different? Show evidence? understand family members vaccinated, following that, safely visit vaccinated people homes. 

You’re also going get zero risk infection. we’ve ever done two diseases human history. You’d best check expectations people. truly defies logic reasoning. world filled literally millions stories deaths - within one year - COVID, yet people far terrified statistically insignificant portion population experienced side effects vaccine. *Side effects.* literally fearful possibly residual effects vaccine literally facing possible death virus. 

Not mention, love cite longitudinal studies vaccines’ effects; last time checked, aren’t COVID’s residual effects, either! Talk gambling dumbest two choices. It’s akin running stairs horror movie versus front door - sure, might die either way, one way probably *much* dangerous. like 55% think much. using type ""vaccine passport"" well. fully support employer's right (and obligation) provide safe working environment requiring vaccines, ""At will"" employment. That's aggressive timeline I've seen yet younger ages.

That would dope hell. Would love get 5 year old vaccinated early school year. Obviously ask poor girl lost father, she'll say yes... look bigger picture, way. Keeping schools opened whole school year important. Especially considering France end less many deaths European counterparts. hostility, definitely look people able work home screaming need restrictions permanent they're scared virus, meanwhile people less fortunate able make enough money pay food.

No, comment confusing incomprehensible phrasing. would interesting clever actually copied previous comments changed manufacturer, - wrote new word salad misrepresents previous points, claiming copied post makes look even ridiculous previous posts right everyone see.

There's nugget interesting point nonsense here. 
 think trying ask ""why skeptical Pfizer, they've many manufacturing problems companies?"". would lot effective came said meant.

The answer they've spent last years preparing specifically manufacture mRNA vaccines part partnership BioNTech predated pandemic, full support team put manufacturing processes place.

Pfizer acquire IP BioNTech - worked closely together design manufacturing processes. exactly needed expand production: simple IP waiver sufficient. Went movies tonight first time since 2019. Kind weird (only like 4 people there), felt great weird. Yep, Costco vaccinations appointment needed one there. People seem understand they're vaccinated, thing drags years, get eventually. happen.  Tf? Please get 2nd shot! rest world would love vaccinate front line workers grandparents.

What's stopping them? RemindMe! 62 days “/u/saltywings said: sorry, 0% chance happens.” reference 70% adults vaccinated July 4th. Yeap. getting booster shot. yet getting second dose. Let alone third Yeah we've mostly offering anyone wanted, next goal getting ones apathetic. 

Administering doses extremely easy, takes upping convenience even offer minor incentives youll hold daily rate steady. pay ppl get shot. $500 per dose!  second shot absolutely knocked ass. missed two days work it. Still, I'd like see older family point worry killing them. Certain things like international travel definitely going tied vaccinations. Even things mostly open nowadays, I'm real tired morale drain seeing everyone public masks. Totally worth suffering transmission vector. Oh, get medal! think it’s apathy sense they’re scared get doesn’t require degree diligence whatever now. many areas country actively seek stay loop. means following notification accounts/lists, checking vaccinefinder, signing various notification services, etc. would prefer monetary incentive people decided vaccinate. would even ok getting one since already vaccinated. need people fully vaccinated else going keep bullshit forever. Like another $1000 ought trick. think people would inclined get vaCCiNeS ArENt SaFE bullshit solid chunk cash like  Hell, $10k direct payment taking vaccine would help make mind much easier help get lot people board... “if saves one life would worth it” 

Or cancel student debt fully vaccinated, two birds, one check...

(Obligatory /s) get second dose Pfizer this? Chicago, school, see 98% girls POC wearing masks correctly. It’s boys, mainly white boys, haven’t been. pattern we’ve seen throughout pandemic think it’s weird people don’t talk more. see many families (including own) mom kids wearing mask, dad isn’t. Hey, I'm making statements got screwed didn't. There's lot talk discrepancies Philadelphia rest state. I'm offering possible explanation matter context. Edit: continue clarify; person replied criticized state Philly handled. merely pointing state *didn't* handle Philly. California, ever mandated outdoors couldn't' distance (6 feet).

I'm sure nare people support get little tiny shot arm better yet, sell booze/cocktails weed! Like mobile dispensary bar, one! wonder many vaccine intolerant insured cost. Would really incentive? public investment creating trillions dollars benefits society? public’s ROI? read, 120 families per minute destroyed virus. insanity. Thank qualifying this. First dose? mean dose. 

J&amp;J/Coronavac gang represent. takes single bad vaccine make cripple and/or kill hundred people absolutely crater public trust vaccines ensure advanced we've made eradicating diseases undone 0.1% really say much efficacy vaccine overall circulation virus behaviour vaccinated people. can't take % say vaccinated people 0.1% chance getting it. live area COVID, spend time large groups indoors, there's still higher chance getting it. That's guidance CA entire pandemic needed wear one outdoors distance people (6 feet).  Didn’t see vaccination cicada? That’s swayed still find money everything want. There's hardly government claim funds vaccinate people. that's big failure. 

People want things. basic things they're for. 

Also even vaccine free, pretty cheap. times government covers cannot pay. Normally that's small number. guy still radio?   I'm middle aged. get flu shot might help keep hospital. 

They also said know problem now, tens millions people vaccine. variants vaccinated. evidence problem? 20% people downright refusing take vaccine

These people noted inevitability see inside emergency room. LOWEST priority receive triage. story last September. Yup. Pennsyltucky hopeless. Anti-vaxxers everywhere saying heard stuff Facebook sterility growing third arm taking vaccine. 
Too many ignorant people PA get 70%. Sounds said. Vague cherry picked data “trial data”. Tested 2,000 healthy kids 18 tested positive placebo therefore drug “100% effective” ever heard flu? So, pandemic thing making money drug companies? Employer insurer don’t copays. way paying healthcare. think weird take must PA. really think 70% population get vaccine? 

I highly doubt it, vaccine numbers slowing dramatically anti vaxxers helpless.  huge part non-vaccinated people know.... low risk survival rate) age/fitness profile taking wait see approach vaccine effects. follow science, makes sense take approach choose too. 

Personally, vaccine card filled case work requires road tho. Trying stay positive, exactly make feel hopeful mayor Chicago says expects mask mandates remain place another year. I'll still wear one long to, really, really looking forward day hopefully 2021 mask mandates ended. I'm tired plans join ""still going wear mask even restrictions lifted"" club. least got second vaccine dose Friday. suburbs ones got screwed, much state’s fault. Unfortunately combination negative media, compounded fact vulnerable population chomping bit dwindling made rate new vaccinations plummet. 

If anything pandemic proven public SUCKS risk assesment.  And? cares written contract Oxford Uni?

Side letters governments problem. Uni Oxford would preferred Merck, way, British health minister intervened. Well going work insurance companies business discounts. large rate increase antivaxers hand.... Work certain mall rhymes queen crushya neighbor stores around freaking this. miss 4000 people per day weekends somewhat tiny shop. live cats. Cats like roughhouse. needle nothing. pay cash run insurance?

Because run insurance pay co-pays forcing people pay covid treatment (if needed). think science tells us wrong pause. Five people serious side effects vs 500,000 (do population size adjustments will) think utilitarian psychological response obvious. Keep getting people vaccinated.  need prove sort useful efficacy warrants providing scarce resources. There’s true single payer systems west  systematic review published studies transmission novel coronavirus respiratory viruses, Razani colleagues **found less 10 percent cases described spread outdoors.** also found frustratingly papers detailed settings clearly compared indoor outdoor situations.

“Our takeaway it’s impossible get infection outdoors, even though published, clearly proportion happens much lower,” Razani said. added: “If going beach — beautiful thing — avoid times it’s crowded, mask, Plan B.” Many experts agree comment here. That's call vaccine hesitancy, anti-vax. people get vaccinated reasons really per se. point events fully vaccinated only. sections, entirety events. Thats hell great idea coming West Virginia understand empathize fact voter apathy sucks, opposite voter apathy fix democracy.

That would require much greater involvement participation average member electorate, **FAR EXCESS** advocate.

And never work. Simple game theory shows one bad actor gain million dollars spending half million, million people losing one dollar spend nothing stop him. **Because reward action miniscule** compared effort expended.

To well functioning, self regulating Democratic Republic need class human never existed. Irish study flat-out know 20% cases happened. Outdoor transmission would harder pinpoint. bracing miserable days Pfizer shots neither bad. first gave sore arm two days one random 3 hour energy crash.. second one gave less sore arm mild joint aches Tylenol completely cleared. wild differently affects people. less 1 million vaccinations US today starting worry me.  Thats good thing though dense urban areas need higher vaccine coverage herd immunity. 

Doesnt really matter 50% rural county's population gets vaccinated average distance two individuals mile lot unsures closet reducers. It’s like less 1% You’re missing part pay less taxes government spends. Nobody wants pay taxes still want government. printing money solution. That’s one nicest things I’ve read Reddit. taking vaccine prevent deadly disease pretty severe. make life hell refuse take standard vaccines (except legitimate medical exemptions). course would rabies 100 percent fatal Good them. saved many lives. Amazing happy around people, safe Kids seem get less transmit less: Yeah additional anecdote, sister wants get vaccinated able fit schedule open appointments/work/finding childcare. alerts sent hoping something close walk-ins convenient. imagine get first dose next week two. Depends school district. 

I lowly reading tutor college, shots date work CA public school. Ditto attended K-12 college. 

That said, point it’s pretty commonly done it’s happening across much US decades. It’s crazy situation. UK, 95% people 50 already taken offer. Yeah, people feel risk vaccine equal covid really understanding actual data - might fault entirely. need make sure good, understandable data getting disseminated advertised everywhere people understand like 50/50 deal.

The problem uphill battle. convince someone get vaccine, really sell dangers covid, dangers large population vaccinating. convince someone get vaccinated, need sow little doubt might enough. really tough situation. dad telling saw newscast saying people refusing second dose... frustrating didn’t even look it’d get mad. concerned people doing? Mind business. Thanks kind stranger. 

I wonder history write pandemic.

 Huge hysteria bad flu season... caused combination sectors globalized economy(mostly pharma, tech), sometimes literally bought media (other times incompetent liberal independent thought simply clickbaity) local ruling classes looking best interests etc.

 ...or highly dangerous virus partly contained costly yet necessary Lockdown policies? reduce transmission lot I’m guessing you’re American pay healthcare. Studies shown that, 1%-5+%. that's outdoor concerts, contacts sports things like mostly banned. people spend lot less time outdoors well. systematic review published studies transmission novel coronavirus respiratory viruses, Razani colleagues found **less 10 percent cases described spread outdoors.** also found frustratingly papers detailed settings clearly compared indoor outdoor takeaway it’s impossible get infection outdoors, even though published, clearly proportion happens much lower,” Razani said. added: “If going beach — beautiful thing — avoid times it’s crowded, mask, Plan B.” We've averaging 935,439/day last 7 days. transmission extremely rare.

yep, makes less 10% cases, probably like percent. Although that's also risky outdoors gatherings banned (contact sports, packed concerts, etc.) think it'll much game changer Canada, 82% population lives urban areas (cities) remote communities like reserves pretty far along vaccinations already

Just geography concentration population, one dose less stringent storage big deal Canada places I’d say soon vaccines get full approval ( Pfizer asked ) people get insurance companies tell people, get sick won’t paying there’s vaccine protect you, also allow businesses tell staff get vaccinated quit. DeSatan tool San Francisco hit 72% first doses. believe get nationwide. know people probably tired constant posting updates they're making excited cant contain

NJ's transmission rate plummets .27, .37 yesterday (which already lowest far since pandemic began). phenomenal fast steeply they've dropped. perspective, one week ago went .88 big deal lowest months. day since we've dropping dropping. we're point basically takes 4 infected people infect one other. 

As always say, take numbers slight grain salt factors play (people still masking, jobs/school still remote, students locked inside studying finals, etc) even taking account, way dropped fast really good sign things come quickly. things year really started dropping fast vaccinations opened everyone people building immunity (I know natural immunity infections plays role still). cant get complacent yet (the number stay low sustained period time) keep gotten us (get vaxx'd havent keep taking precautions) keep weeks we're good shape summer. Vaccinated people pay normal price. Non-vaccinated people pay 2x price. Ok, get sick, stay home. caring fellow humans? wear mask it’s required. caring? LOL reasoning disingenuous. *looks hedonism* Southern conservative states rate covid states America anybody else getting really tired hearing exchange? 
 
Person A: ""I really hope mask mandate lifted soon!"" 
 
Person B: ""ACTUALLY THINK WOULD GREAT PEOPLE WORE MASKS LIKE ASIA EVEN PANDEMIC"" 
 
It's non-sequitur, response make sense. There's huge difference pandemic-time, universal mask mandate Asian ""mask-up-when-you-feel-sick"" culture they're really barely related all. know solve problem there's significant portion population can't bothered.

Or actively hostile solving it.  possible setting goals publicly negative effect vaccination numbers? mean, almost half voting population voted Trump put past sacrifice personal health Biden fails something. thought. light end tunnel then. 
I’ll wait meltdown Facebook page parents suburbia land town still flu. never never get flu shot. may eventually get covid vaccine get enough data public beta ends first update comes (fall). Yeah really affects instances cross paths someone walking outside. pull mask pocket give people wide berth. someone deep-fake Trump asking fans get vaccinated? Think might second last comparison bit backwards? seem fit argument. work know dozen blue collar types mostly getting shot. 

I think best strategy Biden would actually come say, ""vaccines avaliable, get one not, care.""

A lot vaccinated elites would lose minds said that, there'd lot quiet respect fence sitters. Also, shift made supply constrained demand constrained, setting specific targets creates peer pressure red areas allow reach stated goal strut around later it. 

It's stupid, like this, is, that's I'd telling Biden. ton people reasonable, easy target intellectually morally deficient assholes.

For people, pausing could easy target.

""They paused. See? know dangerous.""

""They pause. See? care dangerous."" week two, vaccine left body. simply trained immune system recognize create antibodies virus.

When it’s time booster, variants antibodies don’t recognize you’ll able take available. kind boss won’t let someone go extended lunch break get 1st/2nd shot?

One extra hour vs. able work days/weeks/ever again? Seems like pretty good trade - maybe boss fucking idiot. data though suggests high effectiveness *infection* well mRNA Make COVID vaccination requirement health insurance cover COVID-related health expenses unemployment insurance cover COVID-related job interruptions. lol. go public health career. fear would dissapointed. getting shot right now. wait another good 6 months so. going need boosters anyways fall, might well hold one. Let rest public go Public Beta new vaccine see bugs shake (reactions), let companies get data fix vaccines.

Never adopt first release anything, wait bug fixes come out.  Bill Gates depopulated world, wealth would mean absolutely nothing. would completely devalued provide nothing him. one work, mine/supply resources, provide goods services. would mean utter collapse societies across entire planet creating insane instability. people don’t ever stop think results said conspiracy theories. think future said conspiracy happens, said conspiracy crumbles like blue cheese. Holohan track record though, there's multiple times given advice went ""restoring money flows"" gov listen to. freedom exist 19 year old male car owner. help insurance premiums one sweet fuck, freedom. want doctor give me.

I recovered virus recently feeling good general. That's stress new job probably getting older. also want one done. Need schedule physical can't June due insurance coverage. Isn’t contest point really still stand... absolutely is. constitution says nothing vaccinations limited freedoms specified. Travel isn’t one example. you’re referring Milwaukee protocol extremely lucky case. It’s almost invariably fatal without shot pretty much death sentence symptomatic Yeah, messaging completely different say ""You spread COVID fully vaccinated"" vs. ""Scientists know sure whether spread COVID fully vaccinated"".  Thanks Anthrax vaccine. would 100% willing get third shot variant India starts spreading across US. Given I’ve heard coworkers family there, India’s situation Covid terrifying right doesn’t seem much like strains we’ve already seen. sign third shot think implied commenter considering options weren’t incredibly stupid ignored global pandemic. interested options, though, make great point. I'm 100% informed herd immunity need 70% *with antibodies* 70% *vaccinated*? we've got 30 million people gotten Covid already still alive. count towards herd immunity? can't get covid twice right?

70% adults getting vaccinated seems like steep ask 20% say get another 20% say sure. virus endemic NZ, Canada. never going change Canada regardless government decisions. New variants 90% fear mongering 10% legit concern. Closing borders Canada always been, continues purely political theatre. want make seem like they're something creating massive inconveniences people provides next benefit public health. understand things like temporarily halting flights active hot spots, current policy goes well beyond utility fight virus purely show public. Except there’s much move along. vaccines available, can’t force people show them! Yes. pesky Constitution upholding personal rights liberty benefit society greater good! think emotional thing people. nicer think there's solution, company dick, rather there's something put miserable end us time. Oh comment proves Pfizer could never successfully manufacture vaccine successfully. pretty complex stuff Bub. would cause sort issues let Pfizer try start manufacturing vaccines. one bad lot troubled company could cause lot issues WORLDWIDE vaccine hesitancy. simple think is. Plus, moderna telling us Pfizer can’t manufacture vaccines anyway. bad you? got second dose yesterday mostly I'm little sleepy. long take side effects kick in? fall? I'd feel annoyed wear mask since covid long gone anti Vax areas. Went golfing friend fro high school weekend. graduate level educated. tells many friends nurses told people getting vaccinated die days later. Said alone enough get vaccine. Mind dude who’s tried every drug book. didn’t even bother one try convince otherwise. wouldn’t possible. simply said oh man, “well got mine noticed nothing different. Must lucky.” Unless gym requires it, think need one fully vaccinated. also question effective sweaty mask really is. ones seen mention free.. may change went told needle person stop talking putting bandaid on. done like sure it.. That's really low. Believe something.

I checked 2019 2020 flu shots . male uptake significantly lower.

age 18 up

About 42 percent given males 52 percent females. add 100% due confidence levels, rounding etc. said Twitter today goal 70% least one shot, title little misleading. agree though 70% stretching upper ceiling, vast majority Republicans saying refuse get spreading much conspiracy theory bs gullible friends. Second dose joke. Jesus Maybe not! FALL GOVERNMENT'S LIES!!!! need coronavirus vaccine -- 5G tracking devices pure white bloodline!!!

Yeah right. Rabies 100% fatal. People survived spread misinformation. I’ve referred multiple plants actually. Telling chose one. 

Please show non industry mouth piece exclaiming facilities impossible won’t lead vaccine production? even understand many wanted keep schools open, judge whether made right decision? Yup, exactly. card sufficient, means there's going ton fraud anti-vax areas honest people stuck stupid bureaucracy theater. 


As much wish possible force people get vaccination, late case harm good. 


When got permanent resident visa, prove certain vaccinations. cases lost record, get certified antibody test, pretty hard fake. COVID large scale impractical. Let's not. Good luck Canada! Hope bat shit crazy folks smaller percent US. Man it’s nice President United States. look forward goal posts moving 'it really approved' crowd. article link remotely related headline. would Klondike bar? Right wasnt wasn’t *profit margin* somewhere 100’ish million? read NY times article morning basically said never get herd immunity. graph state amount people planning get vaccinated state. surprise, Dem states 90%+ Pub states 10-20%. Makes angry turned political theater early on. Makes sad son going grow world covid never erradicated. Asymptomatic people spread virus well. vaccine makes people still get covid mostly asymptomatic, much spread. Other, ice-cream-truck-rich states send done vaccination. they're annoyance anyway. hubs got second yesterday get second next Tuesday🥰 many Americans complete high school biology course then?  thought EU scaled raw material production? Thanks, pandemic kind made mourning fade noise mass trauma

She beautiful person problem previous promises didn’t rely American general population right thing. I’m optimistic we’re nearing end mess pessimistic we’ll reach goal. see many people refuse wear simple mask... people never get vaccine. Ha I've 6 tumors yet They're suggesting variant 1500% deadly claim ""15 times lethal."" want PCR test tell active asymptomatic infection. need antibody test (pre-vaccine) tell COVID-19 virus longer active body. Everyone's desperate quote death rate nobody mentions short long term effects virus. Sickening. Would love see Churches get involved, particular antivax population. Pastors could help lot convincing many members possible go get vaccinated free soon possible.

Saving lives God’s work. reason one cheapest currently available.

Problem available, despite promising otherwise. decent profit, five dollars might made difference supply problems would fixed now. would focused god to, let Merck would produced America UK seen far later due vaccine nationalism. far smartest move pandemic far.

That's one myths floating British press. Actually German Merck American MSD Oxford wanted didn’t know statistics, source that? search anyways

I guess next question is, practical repercussions people refuse vaccinate? achieve herd immunity without vaccinated?

My dad one can’t figure way talk science politically motivated virus scam.... U/papaswamp doesn’t clue they’re talking Probably it’s fully approved. Im saying anything unsafe. pause everyones mentality kinda 'why would something wrong? Nothing could go wrong. wouldnt release werent sure'. would stupid suggest otherwise.

I think people reluctant worried specifics dangerous j&amp;j problem might instead surprised anything could ever come question begin with. Everyone party also vaccinated miss part.

The two mRNA vaccines reduce risk getting infected 90%. can't spread infected with. everyone around also vaccinated like house party, risk drops 99% less. think fine.  don’t see health insurance companies paying 6 figures unvaccinated covid related hospital bills 12 months less. It’s business pay things. area kind opposite white Indian people(main demographic area) wearing masks beginning African American population hasn’t compliant. remember height pandemic basketball courts Black kids despite minority area neighborhood know else would allow wear mask? government official tell wear mask. Covid 19 treatment, it’s disease. think shake loose percent people hesitant. least give less excuse. vaccine protect us nasty strain well bunch people die come booster shot. you’re fully vaccinated case rate low, risk extremely small. likely better chance hospitalized struck lightning Covid fully vaxxed. problem half country told. half thinks do. halves beginning pausing J&amp;J reassured half thinks already knew. truly experiment.  People left make educated guesses do. works HR sent survey vaccinated get head count today.

Man, backlash sad. wanting answer fear fired. Fear forced get vaccinated. Like legit angry hr trying get head count use voluntary survey.

Its good skeptical, gotta able gauge situation better. 

Also dumb hr send mass email. worked managers offer shots get bars. Sure may still super spreader hit people JnJ walk in. Hopefully create like airborne vaccines something antivaxxers can’t? Question tests: 


This might dumb question, COVID test tell virus run course asymptomatic? remember hearing 1 death many. literal Darwinism. OK condolences loss friend. tragic. anyone 4 years old. enable drama queens. part required immunizations enroll ? figure that?  


If someone goes eat restaurant goes home, feels sick days later, gets tested hospital - zip code gets used ""new case""? restaurant?  


Where link show contact tracing indicates origin people got sick? Elementary math teacher: “You need understand fractions life regardless living.” read article two days ago Alabama worse Mississippi close probably change order daily. That’s sad, really is. Mine too! son anti needle didn’t even hesitate told made us appointments. Except areas 80% vaccination 30%. It’s president decide mask mandates recommendations anyway. That’s states CDC, respectively. 

If people dumb don’t realize day feeling meh better 2 weeks COVID, vast majority us vaccinated _actually_ go back normal, lack vaccination community level drags keep wear masks, etc. need serious PSAs guess. too! Many friends used play dates aren’t getting vaccine themselves... things like eating indoors. don’t safe person play date with. would devastated let guard son (2) ended long term side effects covid needed oxygen long term stroke.

Someone called bad parent sacrificing son’s mental health. He’s happy around bubble, go outside every day. person different viewpoint parenting. think people’s actions mean everything. Actions speak louder words. Especially it’s actions compounded words it’s pretty horrible stuff. You’re failing take account damage faith government we’d face lying public pretending problem.

Take, example, pretty much *everything* Trump said publicly COVID. I've got 2 year old 1 year old. can't wait either! feds could also make tax credit anybody vaccinated.

While support idea encouraging people get vaccine, would set bad precedent IMO. 100%. risk vaccine issues Pfizer seems close 0%.

For kids risk covid issues low still percentage points. unless airlines hotels casinos start requiring it, going change unfortunately. US testing requirements quarantine general arrivals? need financial incentives get vaccinated.  $5 isn’t even remotely enough. got $20 dollar gift cards Publix past year getting flu vaccine. 

Eventually need carrot stick. I’m torn. think it’s fine. anxiety, partner works healthcare (and worked COVID unit) - saying no. new variants harder younger people, continue variants people keep getting sick passing around. way get past pandemic many people get vaccinated possible stop spreading around stops mutating us.  true. mean, Trump right. gone Easter... 2022 American makes sad suck many people exist here. Alas, Covidiots around globe. everyone internet American. person you’re insulting Indian. 

Due size current outbreak, it’s much likely vaccinated Indian exposed COVID vaccinated American has.

India using different vaccines US.

They’re short masks healthcare worker particular could’ve got high initial dose.

And healthcare mess, instead US figures roughly 7000 cases, 500 hospitalised, 70 dead, you’d expect 7,000 post vaccination cases, 150 got hospital bed 350 died.

Seems likely OP telling truth, even would highly unlikely American able make claim. do. get 2nd one tomorrow. *some* don't, significant number, definitely most. Governor Wolf, totally following science!

Except, he’s contradicting CDC regards masks.  That's really good point actually. situation would dramatically different vaccines available use AZ/Janssen (although Novavax uses different technology may side effects).

Had situation component ""rolling dice"" vaccines simply able administer people certain age, see huge spike hesitancy general anti-vax sentiment. Thank science gods mRNA ready shine. Right corner PG, Howard Anne Arundel counties. wonder events, festivals conventions, future require consent check vaccination records attendance. do, they're allowed get states' databases. Right corner PG, Howard Anne Arundel counties. 100% yes vaccines kids. schools normal capacity drop mask mandates covid could devistate school. 

Yes risk severe illness long term issues low children, want find out.

Also September absurd amount data Pfizer vaccine. whole thing shot protects get way think does, vaccinated people little fear near aren’t vaccinated. 

Obvious exceptions apply this, general would think fully vaccinated live life. Concerts harder. imagine outbreak plane. office. there’s contact tracing, they’ll likely able compare manifests payrolls vaccination records. It’s weird suddenly concern it’s new idea. People weren’t cheating vaccines covid. circumstances pulling database well defined. work hospital administered vaccine. tag employees’ health records protected. would illegal verify via health chart ones opted in. ran vaccine scheduling registration via HR. don’t know protocol someone showed. Hey vaccines! Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do? Make dreams come true! know downvoted. Consider using numeric code identify strain, instead geographic location. accurate label, less easy remember. evidence suggests 9 month waning immunity, post-vaccine surge country. 6 month data still showed 90% efficacy, we'll see shakes right staying strong. Biden said national database. possible? end April, every state should’ve allowed adults 16+ vaccinated. Hell Biden essentially required states lol. Federal efforts really paying black community. ton outreach get vaccinated state still indoor mask mandate ok need allow businesses implement type passport type situation so. would easy gyms it. 

The gyms go lightly used everyone masks don’t feel comfortable going without considering signs everywhere requiring masking.

I longer bend top disposable mask around nose let little space air pass. reason someone fully vaccinated tight seal. vaccine worry killing whether not. people vaccine deniers? Trust vaccines! It’s really incredible everyday.
You’re good person. definitely get kids vaccinated. can't hot mama summer I'd like kids old enough vaccinated likely they're 10.😭 Languish. government don’t feel “heat” people literally dropping dead street. whatever keep things going it’s matter biting waiting wave pass.

Same Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines Brazil now. 3000-5000 per day nothing now. hit 70% may 31st?  Yeah Pennsylvania much better Florida!!! seem fairly significant percentage false negatives RT-pcr test India. conclusively attributed mutation specific variant. seems likely older test kits less effective. There's also speculation samples always properly collected. prevent possibly hundreds thousands people dying? Seems like good precedent. It’s currently precedent obviously, you’d pretty bold rooting pandemic rifling poor countries 2024 currently estimated. want stand top world, climb famous mountain. Push limit human endurance, paying extraordinary sums money use disposable human mules carry shit top hold hand way there. joke, greaseballs climb Everest literally know money basically. treat sherpas like shit... die time. fucked up. Sorry clarify, meant specifically Korea. missed chance say 74% 7/4. bummer wait September get kiddos vaccinated. oldest starts preschool august. Excited none less protect covid. anyone know testing people vaccinating people slow rate Japan?  I'm working Vax site right now. J+J pause several thousand people day receiving J+J vaccine. Today 60 appointments scheduled. Yesterday even less. smart effective one thing others. Nursing specialized function, epidemiology. want epidemiologist virologist nurse, opposite also holds! It’s weirdly titled article that’s incredibly generalizing. fully support vaccinations, comes weird. Mostly assume Americans want vaccines back, supply vaccine diplomacy pipeline. Oh! Lol. Sorry. mean negative really need vaccinate kids. risk really low trying understand. Makes sense stop spread 85% seniors least 1 dose already. Kinda seems kill.  CDC verification system mentioned above? Also like happens often misspelled HIPAA. means we’re first game double header 🤯 lol agree we’re closer 7th 8th inning terms US Right? US 3rd highest population world, grouping Americans together silly You’re getting point, lot people don’t get vaccine virus continue spread, spreads highest chance mutating bypass vaccines, would back 2020 situation. still highly likely vaccinated. joking. already lost Alex Trebek, send us another we'll call square... please... miss him. Here, vaccine could save life? loved ones.

Nah.

A free beer five bucks giant bag candy?

SOLD Pfizer help manufacture vaccine, also provided researchers, scientists, funding, helped trials

So apples oranges comparison attest actually works. live US, Aunt mid 60s lives Germany. apathetic... lazy actively hunt vaccine. soon announced Germany Vaccinated &amp; Recovered folks get privileges, signed ass up. 

Not sure system could set US late stage masking, pretty much whatever like here... would made recovery check contingent vaccine status.

For example, get $700 pre-vax, remaining $700 shots. perhaps Tax deduction 2021 Generally whole borrowing model theater avoid claims ""giving away Americans getting it"" hitting news. Outlets dying controversy. time anyone ready give back demand low enough US shrug ask sent ally. Obviously ask poor girl lost father, she'll say yes...

... *very* poorly chosen example, since lost father *while schools closed France* (April 2020). knows lot Americans partying dumb July 4th Apparently fully vaccinated, CDC's data, we're like 32% area, literally food-truck festival get free food get vaccinated, people would it. Never underestimate power free tshirt free food. ….which isn’t surprising really it? always going peak. 2.5(ish) million shots day freaking awesome. media eases constant growth. It’s stupid.  country already third wave  Yes, vaccine delivery always going peak right around time based demand characteristics states. April 12th, several states already demand constrained starting drag dose delivery. 

JnJ made initial decline look worse would been, decline first doses inevitable anyone looked state state demand curves. I'm excited parent! Can't wait 4 year old vaccinated! Yea need adjust expectations. 

We clearly flu back day became apparent going stay us indefinitely. Eh, gave us Dunkin, steal weed sports teams they’re cool. Taking bets. many countries going pull out? Americans! Give us cheap plastic garbage China that’ll break 2 days we’ll whatever say! Nassim Taleb wrote really nice piece medium: Intolerant Wins: dictatorship small minority.

Important also loud rejection stance. I'd like think we're playing softball baseball Wow! “The move came several individuals contracted novel coronavirus they'd already completed 14-day quarantine tested negative twice.” interesting discovery. Bad batch tests maybe…. something else?  Spoiler alert: Trump = worst predictions  inferring get 83% seniors, maybe get 83% everyone, eventually. may also casually mentioned doctor said anyone around baby needs Tdap covid Shot, in-laws want grandparents WAY hesitant. 

Unfortunately best friend 3 kids longer see grandparents one side refused take precautions entire time, even told would cost seeing grandkids.

My friend explained simply oldest 8 said ""If want keep safe, love want see anyways""... no, that's vaginas.  least canada national vaccine advisory council suggests mrna vaccines preferred based risk assessment 2 available adenovirus vaccines j&amp;j az. suggest giving az 30+ provinces follow advice. officially health canada approved az j&amp;j 18+. province using az j&amp;j targeted workplace vaccinations using pfizer+moderna age based rollout. I’m saying use military, that’d insane would start WW3. sort stick. Sanctions, embargos, something. need help don’t take could get much worse world required efficacy dependent it’s basic reproductive rate percentage people vaccinated. case COVID, percent people needing vaccinated mRNA vaccines hit herd immunity expected 60-90%.

I’m sure even hit herd immunity Sinovac vaccines. Really? You’re still ‘iT cHaNgEs dNa’? you’re saying don’t understand science, difference RNA DNA would prefer stay willfully ignorant? Home brave ASS. country full sniveling cowards hiding behind bad science.  would festivals conventions want limit amount people coming event? Vaccines 100% effective. would follow worried virus would want able reduce risk even vaccination exposing others vaccinated. 

Also, sections better seats rest stadium, may incentive fence get jab. Especially mobile vaccine clinic outside stadium. mean much media coverage Biontech gets compared US.

Die meisten Amis kennen das ja nur als Pfizer Impfung. Wir kennen ja seinen ganzen Werdegang, Sohn türkischer Eltern, fast auf Hauptschule....  2 pretty wide range development.

While turned 2 year old might still parallel playing, someone months 3 definitely interacting kids.

Now, get wrong, I'm saying person needs throw kid fire, they'll probably fine hold awhile longer especially since cases hopefully drop substantially next months. brother-in-law passing vaccine large part get immediate relief pandemic mitigation measures he's vaccinated. wants instant gratification, guess.

Nevermind, course, people like contributing us taking longer actually get back normal. can't eat cake it, too, ain't gettin' shot. sucks that's people thinking. Yup. love kids. Yet unlike idiots think badgers cute cuddly creatures animated movies seen..... respect natural order things stay effing 10 feet away children pandemic. literally one people we're taking  require school. Done done. Article dated April 9th -- nearly month ago. 87% effectiveness expected long-lived 94-95% effectiveness two dose regimen?   temporary assignments way becoming permanent semi-permanent.

it's Trojan horse scenario gift horse scenario.  There's vaccines discontinued safety issues apparent fairly quickly. There's never vaccine shown long term side effects. would time different? afraid mRNA boogie man, take J&amp;J one. Also me, I'm usually getting food I'm far cashier someone I'm directly talking to. takes time shot build enough antibodies. Since say got 6 days shot, would mean likely caught shot showing symptoms. Luckily things mild hopefully stay way. Yep. older likely stable time career wise either got job gives flexibility take two days get vaccinated, afford lose hours work. Younger folks stupid, know risk profile low. 40 year old got vaccine day available age group. 21 year old would probably waited could get shot grocery shopping, would now-ish.

Of course see age group less uptake one it. always going way. every country world. parent worth salt, yeah. /r/coronavirusUK told medical company initiative ever going open another office EU mean EC AZ? still waiting, remember hard get covid test? fairly trivial?

That's vaccinations soon. vaccinations easier do, need two shots ever, whereas tests could use one every week two (if super paranoid something). think TON coordinated trolling efforts going science subs push false narratives. seem post long ignorant rants come back. 
 Thanks pushing back. sister holding getting vaccine large part personally aware somebody apparently suffered seizures getting J&amp;J vaccine. hear sister tell it, determined seizures reaction vaccine. pretty bad seizures, too--paralysis inducing ones. person apparently longer experiencing symptoms, change sister feels adverse vaccine reactions hit close home her. people got clots taking hormonal birth control. least one (who clotting trial) male.  Sorry no, nationality nothing competence. please cut racist bullshit maybe read history book. Besides I'm german well ""argument"" pointless anyways.  rich powerful families course.  personal experience, people know got covid got vaccinated ended worst side effects 3 vaccines.

These trips planned well advance. back November first even knew vaccines possibility season put word they'd required, people would cancelled left, right, center would idea they'd able get vaccinated time.

Now, I'm saying right solution. People probably going die either way, COVID able afford needs second year row 0 (or drastically reduced) Everest $$$. sucks hard shows me, least, lucky really barely worry anything even able find new well paying job middle pandemic. me.

I know effectiveness is. may mean different things different people.

The two terms frequently erroneously intermixed. first month two--maybe even first 3 months--of pandemic, thought Wolf Health Secretary Levine good job communicating Pennsylvanians changes made, data considering, timelines (or not) mind changes.

Sometime summer changed. Metrics well defined publicly facing suddenly seem things considering making decisions red/yellow/green phase reopening system. lot decision making seemed start incorporating ""it feel like right time"" types emotional/illogical concerns. remaining excessively harsh mitigation measures seem really whole lot reduce spread COVID-19, also little loose things reduce spread it. ""former businessman"" governor sure seemed like care much providing effective relief businesses harmed orders.

I sure seemed like conflicting inept decisions part stemmed Republican legislature simply refused work point.

But last summer/year, kind started give idea Wolf administration would take turn suddenly start feeling like good, effective leaders pandemic.

And yet, like you: agree. indeed hit home run yesterday announcement. clear, concise, understandable nuance it, simple date easy understand metric.

By tracking vaccination progress PA, think could hit 70% fully vaccinated (read: shot-in-arm, necessarily fully built immune systems) mid-June. keep slipping vaccine administration, push back. announcement masks tied vaccination levels intended impact public, though, could see increased vaccine participation might beat mid-June timeframe.

We'll see! Yep, half nurses know anti-vaxxers. get it. That....literally makes sense. Add wife list. Can't wait see kids protected little fucker. many years data Salk vaccine rolled world wide?

His vaccine developed 1955 rolled year world wide. analogy spot on.


“The effect impressive. 28 000 reported cases polio 1955, 1956, one year immunisation, 15 000 cases.”

“1953. Perhaps worst polio epidemic history 1952, National Foundation’s Committee backed Salk’s work. 1954 trials million children randomly assigned vaccinated non-vaccinated groups. Vaccination reduced incidence less 50%; vaccinated child contract polio, usually non-paralytic.”

There mass outbreak 52 56, half kids vaccinated, ANALOGY  jerks! look scientists doctors putting good information choose believe data corrupt. There’s reasoning done. cannot wait son get vaccine!! type global surveillance doing? can’t read article. I’ll tell what. think there’s chance could correct. actually hope are.

The vaccines safe. *cue anything pandemic proven public SUCKS risk assesment. 

Indeed. media SUCKS educating people risk assessment, worse, media predates weakness get clicks. Wow.... I’m concerned us hitting 70%. letting teenagers get vaccinated alone probably push us edge. We’ve got lot rural places take lot space, majority population Philly Pittsburgh, still vaccine interest population centers. Allegheny County, Pittsburgh is, 70% eligible population one dose(s). expect see number go another 10%. American's dates Month/Day/Year, he's saying July 4th April 7th. Odd. Especially PG think masking would high. throwing away everything right finish line.

Two weeks later, looks like received two flats Pfizer weeks ago set mass vaccine event. Spots 1000 people Saturday 500 Sunday.  ~300 138 people showed respectively. previous events booked out. 

We also 100 week front lobby yesterday 9 takers 50 appointment block. 

Demand fallen off, supply sufficient. 

This rural county we’ve given north 10,000 doses ~14,400 adults (over 18). lazy big one. know lot people definitely anti-vax, basically sitting around waiting vaccine come knocking door. think doctor supposed call something like that.  Lol yuck!  know he’s dealing here. 70%!?! Maybe count already we’ll make benchmark. actually did. Numbers going CDC still count unvaccinated next week guidelines (two weeks second dose fully vaccinated), though probably protection point. 

short version think safe go maskless small, indoor, private groups maskless outdoor activities like hiking dining (basically outdoor environment fine maskless unless extremely crowded like stadium music concert), still wear mask indoor public environments (gym, movie theater, etc). countries produce it? certainly don’t think make huge dent. India home made vaccine, government could use that, don’t. waiting companies come take financials setting factories. agreed.

- First, anecdotal best, actually evidence escape variants. grossly misrepresenting reporting blowing scary possible. 

- Second, vaccines 90-94% effective blocking asymptomatic infection, breakthrough. April 29th 9,500 people United States, percentage .009% INCLUDES B.1.351, B.1.1.7, P41 variants circulating US. 

- Third, Pfizer/Moderna even distributed India. AZ Covaxin, completely different technologies, used country. 

You're massively overselling anecdotal cases seeing conflating crisis India right primarily due population vaccinated adhering distancing protocols right now. no, proof ""Vaccines cause effect"" stated original post.

Nah, us aren’t vaccinated aware minuscule effects COVID certain demographics (please don’t try deny RN). hard no; waiting government stop playing start paying.    anyone comments still hesitant please love God get it. happen average pain shot feel sore next day. absolute worst thing could happen feel sick day two.

That's still 25.4% lowest bracket least one dose far.  That's lot people, make huge difference vaccination rate slows adults, especially grows there.

We're getting 70% vaccinated whatever.  every person selfishly opts (or selfishly opts children out), need someone else get infected get us closer herd immunity.  point, hope adult anti-vaxxers get infected ASAP.  spite, better country way.

Under scenarios (See Figure 1) cases expected rise throughout April peak early mid May 600K 900K week. actuality, reported cases around 350K week, optimistic model predict would happen early June pessimistic model early August.

The vaccine administration scenarios (See Table 1) April seems close happened, though recent reductions administrations, seems unlikely able maintain 50 65 million first doses rate September reach 75% 90% coverage groups. Thank you. add required daily first shots needed get 70% July 4th goal stats see that? Thank you. Well, effectiveness vaccine disputed (otherwise try get it, would we). number vaccinated people arriving far low, total inconvenience negligible comparison potential extra load paperworks check confirm authenticity border control would every entry points. easier put everyone entering VN facilities weeks. big gain, serious loss either.

In 90s, numerous state pharma backed initiatives subsidize treatment way completely ineffective controlling HIV spread global south. IP waivers treatments produced mountains publicly-funded basic research got things control. There's need make mistakes twice new pandemic that's far transmissible. Speak lol Boston released 8/22 date week NYC's 5/19 despite 70% vaccination single-digit deaths state. vaccination metrics can't really improve much measures widely popular liberal mom crowd state. hell getting rid mask mandate outside. Yeah, really even understand people afraid side effects vaccine all. everyone know that's (which probably least 20, different ages, health, etc etc), worst effects. I'm 28, relatively healthy, never effects vaccines. Pfizer shots made feel like flu minus congestion coughing. Whole body hurt, could barely move arm, tired, low grade fever chills. First shot worse lasted 48 hours. slept. Second one fever worse lasted around half day. Slept, woke up, better. Point is, felt like absolute crap. get that's big deal concerning people. Everyone gets colds flu sometimes sucks, get it, usually. mention effects actually sick sign immune system working. nervous about? Let guess, give damn mass evictions? way many people seem miss patent protection beneficial society long what's profitable overlaps what's beneficial society. case, HIV COVID, thing letting market incentives run free accomplishes letting people profit detriment rest society. governments allowed tweak incentives profitable thing what's right, even want government for? think make much difference waive IP.

You whole ecosystem around it. first, need trained people, takes years. Marburg facility ""mixing"" process. MRNA essence produced Mainz Idar-Oberstein.

The lipids still produced Canada, whose suppliers found Merck, Evonik still phase upgrade one facilities produce lipids domestically started production.

Biontech fortunate situation two bioreactor producers, Sartorius Merck, around corner, helped set facility.

Then need vials. One biggest producers, Schott, around corner, need set up.

Despite already existing big fill&amp;finish capacities, federal government boost subsidise upgrade plant Dessau 400 million € (additionally unrelated Biontech subsidies). Additionally, several companies like Dermapharm, Sanofi, Siegfried, Delpharm, Baxter convert facilities, start work now.

To set scratch would take years. question want decentralise manufacturing process. Marburg facility monthly production target 84 million doses.

It would totally oversized serve domestic market. Apart point pandemic richer economies third quarter. Many vaccine production sites sit around idle 2022/23 on. hell this?

Landlords leech people's need shelter absentee ownership enforced property rights backed state's capacity violence. Landlords property use, therefore use violence-backed property rights profit people rent properties. matter they're ""rich"" not, still engaging expropriation.

Either way, bootlick people engage expropriation. empathy people suffer mass evictions.

Really shows priorities lie Great article! I've cooled idea J&amp;J major factor believed. Looks like demand already waning days pause. graph originally posted said unreliable guy made says data delayed. Looks like right wrong. seem like correct... implies everyone could get symptomatic infection, ""wrong exposure"" happened them?

I'm sure like explanation. They're still going want remain ""anonymous"" share &amp; yeah, definitely wear masks. walk availability Pfizer vaccine day, every day throw away doses night people want them.

I'm go you, disgusting. Rougher average response normal? Pfizer best JJ good too. Half women family got JJ. risks JJ vaccine winning million dollar ticket. terrified bees thank you. even legal? sounds weird tragic well. 
The federal government power overrule states public health? People really cant imagine motive providing medical care profit incentive, god system fucked They’re pretty close 100 percent. million vaccinated people. 835 hospitalizations. Better chance struck lightning. typed words hurry made confusing. bad. Here's meant:

China defeated virus quickly efficiently, without significant foreign aid. government earn credits it.

\- True.

So India thought: OK, easy. handle it. need much foreign aids either! 

\- Bad idea. Really bad idea. want continue indefinitely?

Well got Neanderthal part down. said may, that's important word sentence. definitely mean hope wear masks. also said depending situation, maybe senior citizen centers still require masks, hospitals doctors offices, places increased chance near immunocompromised individuals, increase chance spread. Vaccines 100%. awesome 80 90 percent, I'm near 100 people 10 vaccinated, I'd still prefer everyone wear masks. Like said. Situational. Millions people third world suffering effects pandemic somebody think poor shareholders.

Millions people developing world continue suffer number diseases, least part everyone knows intellectual property protection weak nonexistent, strong incentives work cure problems suffer get paid work do. new palace

What? modi palace? ??? feeling saying phase 3 results coming next week many weeks now. mean, hope great results decent production capability, seem disappointing. people vote leaders deserve suffering? Oh yes!!! getting there. Believe turning corner. introverts still stay home enjoy lives. rest us... get back norm. Like, rest world suppose situation? Brazil creates vaccine proof variant, stand one man drags us abyss again? Letting pfizer company keep control simply genocidal position. You, western person, fail recognize insanely privileged sound. There’s literally reason corporations even control first place considering research tax-payer funded, say. Stop simping for-profit healthcare rube Texas Utah high vaccine support map, higher Georgia Arizona. agree there’s weak correlation Democrats getting vaccine, it’s strong correlation. It’s anywhere extreme claim. undermines point, lie numbers.  16 TN. \[citation needed\] can, enough people get vaccinated. can, then. Jesus. seems Indian people even proud/arrogant Chinese. (as native Chinese, observe similar behaviors countryman, extreme) Yep. long masks required, messaging *isn’t* turning “vaccinated people go back normal”. yet argument rarely ever seems expressed way focuses European labs. Huh, wonder why. Health Canada rolling review covid vaccine candidates. means companies like Pfizer keep reporting finding Health Canada keep updating decision rather waiting large scale study result. first approve vaccine back December. feel way seeing Kong vs Godzilla theaters, trust me, don’t want risk getting tackled one yard line. Interesting they’re 50 µg opposed 100 µg first two. Hopefully reduces heavy fevers fatigue experienced dose two. become new Bayer lose main source profit within next months? know Chinese Indian company undercut generic/biosimilar since don’t account sunken cost R&amp;D license. would specifically seek apply companies required vaccinations. covid, annual flu whooping cough communicable disease. would incredible! Yeah that's analysis is. understand 2nd dose delivered halts data suppose studies based real population data/results can't really adjust that; they're drawing conclusions real world. 

I wish study one dose 3/4/5 months since currently seem able guess that'd would certainly helpful information rollout begins reach developing world. Winston Churchill never said that. already produces bunch pharmaceuticals

So Germany. Conflating UK, Russia China serious whataboutism. One nations much like terms possessing real strength. know probably 3 people top head. Two coworkers one hard anti vax one soft probably get around soon it’s around while, third seems lazy. third friend don’t see often. Keep trying get appointments either real busy work, nervous don’t won’t tell me, incredibly lazy. Yeah happy severe illness. catching first place also great.  mRNA-capable ones Bill Gates finally like, I'm going lot, y'all whatever want. immediate benefit?

Saving money. That's what's absurd this: principle, saving money countries claim can't afford it. (I'd like see breakdown national budgets India South Africa believe literally cannot afford vaccinate people, though suppose poverty reasonable argument smaller countries.)

Since really money, issue figuring who's going pay development vaccine. Waiving IP protections way national governments shift costs healthcare systems onto pharmaceutical companies.

It's cheapskate thing disincentivize future development.  Well, 69.420% I'd assume could add day two number.  Yes, shady AZ. Chinese arguing country send help India asap (despite border disputes), blaming leaders paying lip service. see leaders wise; knew offer would turned Modi anyways. ""the same"" mean expressing distrust data, article reporting significant conclusion saying ""low confidence""? I’m saying people encouraged pay rent, all, landlords rights blanket eviction ban opens lots possibilities avoid payment. 

With said, people living streets last thing would want society. It’s morally wrong richest countries world provide poor, extreme poverty makes crime skyrocket. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Obviously ""fully"" approved different, mostly legal sense organizations -- efficacy safety data skipped EUA process. Lmao think haven’t close? one refuses get vaccinated happily acquiesce mask policy.

Well, tell 30% coworkers exactly that. hope hold long enough go away without get vaccinated. Cambodia got tagged Central &amp; East Asia.... hahah Wouldn’t surprising case, even it’s small protection. Covid-19 subtype Coronavirus, Coronavirus types common causes cold. least fired theirs. India, Brazil, UK still get that. really understand uncritical worshipping Curevac. far, delivered nothing still trials, apart irritating statements. cases like think better solution government subsidize cost treatment patent expires rather invalidate IP protections. people downvoted please explain someone expected go work interact public gotten vaccine someone option staying home? Yeah, one famously understated pride events yesteryear. Eviction momantariums sustainable solution, forgave people's rent instead provided massive rental relief think last state lift restrictions when? Currently, looks like planning 8/1 Labor Day Boston. would Oregon/WA right? Announcing 3 months NYC week gone surprising well 70% vaccinated state would guess best July 1 maybe 3 weeks later Boston, Oregon seems worst shape Dem states. Guess rest country deal lot vacationing Massholes shortly... lol sort figured would case. kind hover 350-400K range depending day.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\* Edit - checked Worldometer 412K moment today :( Literally every single trial, study etc. vaccine 95% efficacy, testing symptomatic cases.

It known literally since first vaccine trials. Good stuff. Biden admin needs pressure manufacturers start sharing process information work countries develop new production streams. obviously isn’t going happen overnight start working new manufacturing sites countries help increase production developing countries vaccinated 2022 2023 instead 2024 confused lol Bangladesh already produces bunch pharmaceuticals says they're ready go time, so... we'll see promise lives reality. That’s all. exist pharmaceutical production facilities white Europe capable producing vaccines represent risk IP owners use aren’t control managing facilities. It’s racial issue. It’s management risk issue vaccine maker. German plant makes bad batch, public won’t differentiate happened house vs outsourced view safety vaccine doubt. get JJ vaccine travel different one? 

I wanted get closest one unfortunately really want gf take Johnson.

Out 3 best? least, Johnson paused already places lower others. want risk women family matter small may What...

Curevac mRNA vaccine like Pfizer Moderna. entirely Modi shunning Biden fan Trump that? Russia. China's people would gladly returns bikes show everyone powerful are. Superpower complex. Even UK dream rulers seas still strong. major breakthrough since UN vote March 2021
The result seen we’re waiting Europeans Same, they're ""I dont want go way take care it"" really want get pancakes. can't really quality pancakes go. good news flair. Politicians appointees obsessed restarting money flows, health perspective, people keep careful infection rate zero. safe would feel, fully vaccinated

As safe felt 2019 mask, distancing, crowded bar. enough people India’s middle upper class could pay additional price difference back government. 

Right it’s supply problem demand problem India, though collateral rewards concerning. 

I think req wanted India liability waiver. cdc recommendations.

One vaccinated person gets sick, sues, company boned.   hairdressers crazy? experience seems like people cutting hair nutty. people get vaccinated turn vehicles transport dead bodies! win win oktoberfest one places, selfish mindset time last year may resulted one closure first place  know lot people open getting vaccinated won’t go way get it. Canada weeks behind first doses.   Cases look lower last tuesday considerable margin. However, deaths remain actually seeing death rate per case rise. That's goal! companyis working creating seasonal flu shots using RNA lipid nanoparticle technology, vaulted lab benches single drug rare disease year ago effective vaccine demand worldwide. “Pfizer emerged leader mRNA development, exploring wide range opportunities technology,” chief executive Albert Bourla said Tuesday conference call investors. companies said expect vaccines remain demand least several years coronavirus variants proliferate around world people require booster shots maintain immunity initial doses. wasn’t good day, oh night! issue community trust. think able involve churches similarly trusted institutions, could increase %.

--Not saying church everyone's number 1 trusted institution, is. University starting require vaccination all... I'm sure many follow... Maybe push aspect vaccination more. 
 
Not getting vaccinated protect COVID, also protects think idiot fellow Americans!  people become infected, greater probability mutation occurs slips outside protection offered vaccines.

Also rest us pay medical costs end ICU. like Winston Churchill said Americans. ""They'll always right thing.....once they've exhausted alternatives"". ie. whole lot wrong wrt pandemic long time......then go 'BEAST-MODE=ON' absolutely kill rocket past everyone else. talking two three top educated states US. bet think okay drink drive...or sell fentanyl children. know reason now, it’s willful ignorance.

I’ll repeat nth time, reason people getting vaccinated makes society safer.

We care society fellow human beings dude. That’s reason. It’s brain buster. catching / reporting 4% cases reporting 340k cases day would indicate 9.5MM cases day. don’t data: thus, hypothesis. outdoor transmission prevalent, we’d data. mean motto “always trust people... themselves.” So, he’s accounted this, might feasible. people don’t want take better community, shouldn’t get enjoy it. flights, schools, public events. health department county going bars Friday night mobile vaccine clinic.  bribing people $10 gift certificate food bar get vaccinated.

I'm hoping events like get people motivated go way get shot. Fine. fully document actual doctor, webmd."
