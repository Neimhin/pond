I‚Äôve seasonal colds lasted week, seem like big shocker COVID symptoms going 5 days. far recommendations speed recovery would strongly recommend doctor medical professional type advice, I‚Äôve seen things zero evidence (like colloidal silver) recommended Reddit. Link? Yes. ventilators untill one dies get.extubated, almost never happens. This.

I worked healthcare years funny cycles would go. Nurses would high demand, we'd bump salaries signing incentives. market flooded nurses pharmacists premium.

These cycles go on. one too. knowledge share?

Yes. Look numbers unvaccinated, numbers hospitalized unvaccinated. happens every hospital country point. Unvaccinated? Sorry, need keep icu beds open car crash victims. It‚Äôs bothering enough I‚Äôm thinking going back first career. Yes good points also. Mostly saddens schools education lacking much already hoping would bring changes.

As point parents work, school started later? mean, kids parents summer already. And/or parents could volunteer stay home alternate days. 

Anyways, interesting discussion, thanks chiming in! much heartbreak. premise incorrect. evidenced numbers/% unvaccinated country. Wow sorry. That's terrible. Unfortunate families, safe place deliver due high risk staff. Anecdotally always nurses, PSWs, cleaners etc. doctors pro vaccination. vaccine isn‚Äôt cure. wouldn‚Äôt want injected infected immune system would stressed. still masks bushfires thought waste many.   literally live 30 minutes away hospital happening months. absolutely insane. would imagine that? experimental. genetic therapy.

mRNA therapy - either way know mean - typical thing vaccine provides antigen (or disabled viruses things)

Administering mRNA new thing - recently entering broad use.

Which makes ""1-2 years testing"" joke, especially humanity researching possible new mechanisms side affects.

The economy comes 1st. Schools really limited cards play. parents need work order provide family. truly circle jerk unfortunately people suffer.

During time majority schools remote, ideal time school prepare following school year. added jugs disinfectant wipes nothing else.
There least 2 reason this.
1.people felt kids risk
2. one took initiative plan cause thought virus would gone.

But yeah totally agree alternate schedule 1/2 class remote. 
My district 10 k remote manpower implement district wide 1/2 1/2 rotate. (At least that's told) That's exactly point making!  US enough vaccines vaccinate entire population now, demand (anti-vaxxers, stupidity, ignorance).

Ireland (as countries) supply issues. Essentially, it‚Äôs stubbornly hold onto contradictory belief even proof we‚Äôre wrong. ‚Äúdis-harmony‚Äù two beliefs called ‚Äúcognitive dissonance.‚Äù

Meaning still believe ‚Äúmath‚Äù (25% 75%) even know full well basic math works (75% 25%). you? Crescent St Astoria. ambulances would race Mt Sinani Astoria get onto Queensboro bridge Manhattan. Sometimes 4 hour day night. crazy people get medical healthcare field vaccine prerequisites work get bent shape take Covid vaccine. least they're consistent. Clinic nurses generally lvns. can't throw delivery room. They've 2 basic pedes classes likely zero clinical experience settings. Yeah, really standing authority figures acting like children. give fux bout nobody.   Dick's still out. Spain we‚Äôre currently sitting 74% total population completely vaccinated. Let‚Äôs go lads Oh crap...that beeping sound head now... title says ‚Äúday 28.‚Äù Man, can‚Äôt even explain weird read China (actually, Taiwan South Korea worried China) also big warning me. bought first ever car second third week January (to avoid public transport people math right), ordered reusable mask (and bunch disposable ones) etc early Feb bought months' worth long-term supplies middle February.

By end second week January, thought high enough risk person-to-person transmission (you getting sick people market, close contacts, more; mention sheer speed increase cases). Diamond Princess happened, thought high probability airborne transmission well, made reusable mask thick, got goggles.

I wrote report 4 Feb whether long-distance fly live end Feb, whether wait May. explained waited, 5% chance seeing September, 30% chance seeing year. came, lockdown happened papers, flights back drying up, want illegally case affected legal stuff later on, left less month coming. 540+ days, coming 7 weeks, we're almost done!

Obviously, I'm happy vaccines. 2019, thought mRNA vaccines still decade out, getting ahead schedule amazing. I'm looking forward rest it. overall point good, I'll say smallpox longer endemic anywhere (because eradicated). Also recovered need one dose fully protected.

In US that's 12% population. No. understand things impactful even perfect, refrain throwing temper tantrum. suspect students longer drop classes refund, many colleges going remote. Going numb sign burnout. body body busting shit wood hitting pavement. area hospitals bringing nurses qualified certified countries. least vaccinated. coworker's wife newborn got covid L&amp;D nurse f them.  5 percent vaccinated *cases* hospitalized. case infection. 1% hospitalizations vaccinated people 99.8% deaths unvaccinated. It‚Äôs weird framed story way made vaccines look weak possible. Unless glass cage, mind breeze visitors could carry droplets   flu, modified vaccine every year.

But perhaps vulnerable people (I.e. 60+ comorbidities) Ah cheers that's interesting Fully vaccinated receive prescribed amount. ""fully"" vaccinated 2 really relate surge Delta else hangs gorillas? Classic case ""I'll anything country""

Okay, and/or kids wear piece fabric mouth public.

""Oh no, that!!!"" I‚Äôll take student loans forgiven call even PICU (And NICU) different doesn‚Äôt mean tests hard get. baby streets ahead Selfish, stupid. people know better. is. It‚Äôs also emotionally draining hear fellow nurses throw fit vaccine mandate. see first hand happens, yet still refuse it. also immunocompromised. got vaccine soon could. doctor to,d leave house. got sick pneumonia (not Covid related) scared go hospital. tried fight home ended husband chest compressions passed lack oxygen. think people never sick like imagine terrible is. glad everyone well. correct. 

I already do. Thought real hot shit there.

That's math  fail 5th grade math? simple division problem numbers freely available cdc. 98.6%. revealed someone parrots told without taking 30 seconds verify claim. Also count people long lasting symptoms organ damage mild cases. 650k deaths year something easily preventable.

3k killed 9/11. created 2 new government agencies, invaded 2 random countries, occupied 20 years, wasted trillions trillions dollars, curtailed rights patriot act. kill 9/11 people every 2 days right every single day last fall. people need use common courtesy wearing mask getting free shot. word fellow American looking ** SHAME **. ashamed. baffled. stymied audacious stupidity. And, yes, embarrassed. Stunned, really. ffs, look numbers. unvaccinated adult 11 times likely die vaccinated adult. Here‚Äôs another word American compatriot thread. ** ALARMED ** FDA approval vaccination 5-12 year olds can‚Äôt come soon enough. But, kids five? We‚Äôre alarmed. Shocked, really. Here‚Äôs another word. ** DREAD **. dread school year bring children, get passed along already ill elderly loved ones.

What themes lead high vaccination rates? see convincing? successful? long helpful advice. And, congratulations. genuine respect. plans trials vaccinating children 5? Words live \^\^\^ Wow TIL baby deliveries stopped like that. It‚Äôs amazing! manage that? imagine stick head womb like ‚Äúhey sweet baby need stay another week got line pregnant mamas waiting deliver.‚Äù baby gives thumbs up, sucks back broken water, stops contractions goes right back sleep. 

Can please stop heart attacks cancers too? Basic math look numbers see add up. Basic statistics understand what‚Äôs actually measured talked about. Biology, pharmacology, chemistry, etc‚Ä¶.

It‚Äôs like presented nut bolt it‚Äôs tight fingers undo without wrench need come stupid ideas get off. go buy wrench. wrench science. undo kinds nuts fit wrench. Yeah, it'd nice see something like local infection rate x hospital usage vaccination rate z go see Dune theater.

I suspect partly numbers always good areas partly use lowered restrictions carrot vaccines. Probably partly know numbers new variants moving target.

I feel pretty confident unless super contagious new variant shows we'll back normalish early next year latest. Sooner antivaxxers stop nonsense. Life must move on.   Yeah one time thought I'd probably die still go work think probably actual flu. Drove straight urgent care soon could leave. even occur get tested flu. really matter guess. treated symptoms sent way. 

Interesting tested. know tamiflu think guess people must tested receiving it. two kids illnesses years. One get iv fluids super super sick days emergent care all. never even mentioned flu testing. something ever thought happened came flu. know sounds radical maybe leave healthcare doctors, public health degree holders.

I mean, think vaccine mandates mandates vaccines getting hired hospital? That's works.  envious. employer giving $500 fully vaccinated, additional $1,000 85% us get fully vaccinated October 15.

We're 40% reason numbers move new hires fully vaccinated. We're going get $1,000. thats point. Children make larger percentage ICU stays now.

Nobody saying vaccinated people making children sicker, makes severe cases slightly disproportionate. 

Unvaccinated people general disproportionately filling ICUs

The explanation children getting sicker general Delta infectious, seems true confirm, wife RN. pandemic neither us would thought would need antidepressants anytime soon...everything's fucked up. Well seeing President Biden ex President Trump r vaccinated guess ""stupid stupid does."" -- Forrest Gump think stuff ancestors survive us born hell success story. 4 billion years unbroken line even human probably even animals. nurses continuing education credits/courses maintain license? Seems odd although get it, nursing hours probably leave lot hours studying. adults West Hollywood vaccinated can‚Äôt keep venues shut indefinitely.  Yup. going happen. give 2-4 years nurses fighting wages due cheap H-1B labor.  would nurse work hospital constantly risk license versus private clinic/hospital treated correctly.

What probably going happen US going open H-1B's nursing. Anyone else find mixed messaging vaccines impacting transmission infuriating?

There mixed one hand, told wear masks even vaccinated. 

Yep, vaccines reduce risk, eliminate hand, told indoor settings safer fully vaccinated.

Indoor settings _are_ safer everyone fully vaccinated. know confused prevent transmission not?

Yes. spirit sistah. ‚ò∫Ô∏è sort true, delta incredible capacity spreading, long periods time simple cloth mask going cut it. evidence outbreaks masked classrooms. Really delta focusing vaccinating everyone things worked year ago going work well. correct. course goal ultimately reduce infections hospitalizations working. meant say fully vaccinated, expect reduce risk hospital visit, also expected 95% immunity infection. case. Yup. really looking good nursing profession sadly. I'm big advocate Associate degree;s technical certificates join workforce constantly chafe notion nurses need 4 year degree, everything needs 4-5 Bachelor's degree. pandemic proved maybe couple classes virology would probably saved hundreds lives. Recent research strongly suggests antibodies essential protection vaccination, *not* much vaccine helps, nothing compares bodies defense

The vaccine literally training body's defense. especially effective infection. New York dysfunction succesfully yin-yanged Texas dysfunction. new guy. thought same. blacklisted working medical field ever again. tested flu early 20‚Äôs fuckin joke, haven‚Äôt missed flu shot since. absolutely zero energy, intense body aches wild swings temperature. felt drained like impaired felt unsafe drive got ride doctors tested. worth noting tamiflu incredible. missed five days work hit tamiflu every day considerably better. Yeah. achieved without raising taxes international companies.

(Most likely) done OSHA rather act state/local legislature. means authority enacting enforcing mandate falls doctrine Chevron Deference rather act legislative authority. Chevron Deference arises Supreme Court case 1984 allows executive branch broad interpretation laws directed upon legislative branch - think law states ""X implemented methods imposed secretary"" law interpretable definition.

Multiple supreme court justices already written dissenting opinions doctrine Chevron Deference want get rid (prior clear conservative majority). supreme court justices written opinions past stating Chevron Deference takes away constitutional authority judicial branch interpret laws gives executive branch unconstitutional despite part law legislative branch. argument unconstitutional legislative branch give legislative interpretation authority executive branch judicial branch explicit authority interpret laws article 3 constitution.

As such, act legislative interpretation executive branch modern times effectively relies upon single Supreme Court decision criticism, even dissenting opinions, 3 current 9 justices (not including new 3). legally comparable vaccine mandate created act local/state legislature (as case Jacobson v.

If goes Supreme Court could shut mandate rewrite modern administrative code written revoking prior precedent Chevron Deference - mandate comparable precedent surrounding vaccines historical precedent relates legislative authority.

But said, FDA always compare chance adverse events risk disease prevented. chance adverse events is, course, low.

But ""problem"" risk kids 12 COVID also low. ~5 million known child cases, less 400 deaths. case fatality rate children 0.008%, less one 12,500 cases. rate age group questions -- kids 5-11 -- lowest child cohorts (0-4, 5-11, 12-17) well, 1/3 rate two thus closer 0.003%. Hospitalization rates similarly low (under 2% child cases, 1/3 5-11s.)

COVID kills 0.003%, say 20% kids get COVID, vaccine 1-in-200,000 chance life-threating side effects might worse disease. base rate low, makes sense FDA require thorough safety effectiveness data.

All said, though, there's two significant things make vaccination still make sense. first Delta -- point, pretty safe say *100% unvaccinated people get COVID*, though might take year two. hospitalization &amp; death rates applied whole population. 

The second there's 1-in-200,000 chance life-threatening side effects vaccines. VAERS shows 0.0019% people died COVID vaccine (i.e. 2/3 high child death rate COVID), VAERS results simply mean ""a person got vaccine, person died afterward"" -- given vaccine initially given primarily elderly (who die kinds things) means expected. number deaths directly attributed vaccines *zero*; Moderna Pfizer clinical trials, severe (hospitalization) side effects observed, *at rate vaccine placebo groups*. vaccine risk appears close nil even comparing low COVID risk children relevant age group, going come way ahead numbers crunched.  18,000!?! Lowest number cases? 2000 new daily cases positivity rate 11%. pretty high... latin science *scienctia* literally means knowledge. Science systematically building organising knowledge testable explanations predictions. Biology science, studying means study science. call science class school..? sympathy ""people."" Yeah they're protesting masks year now.

Death part life. don‚Äôt expect stay quit long. job pays probably close 6 figures. take many missed paychecks realize lifestyle reduction isn‚Äôt worth it. counting forcing management back down, rule around Medicare Medicaid dollars lost leverage.

College watching lectures screen. nursing student, I'm sure severe nursing shortage really is, hospital administration ""we dont want hire train new grads we'll force veteran nurses critical staffing shortages hire travel contracts exclusively"". 

Its confusing because, new grads going? see thousands state alone graduate every 6 months. nursing schools across state filled even state mandating vaccines university students. Nursing incredibly popular major, yet still critical shortage.

Again, purely speculation opinion, really done research topic, conversation real ""nursing shortage"" something ive heard quite veteran nurses discuss well.

I already noted original comment, replies you, replies. using best available data (as does). Again, provide Mississippi student testing data, happy update calculation. *again*, already tried find it, - know may difficult - try find Google searches that'd dividing number sick students largest number possible gives bare minimum positivity rate possible, 10.2%.

Yeah that's accurate. Sorry. like can't believe mine accurate, can't believe yours. anyone driving Nissan Altima absolute fuckwad? That's lovely, always work out, donor milk hard find, incredibly expensive, always made aware donor's health/vaccination status. someone help ? took first dose Pfizer June.

Sad loss.  also happened Rosemary Kennedy. ended brain damage lead lobotomy   [This study COVID panic affected neonatal death rates 2021. 

While nowhere specifically state unvaccinated nurses linked infant getting invented subsequently dying Covid, interesting price results support findings similar research. smaller study 231 parents infants hospitalized NICUs UK USA showed large percentage (41%) reported unable bond 37% able present infant often desired [[10]]. Comparisons pre- pandemic status one NICU clearly link limited parental presence abilities COVID-19 pandemic [[5]]; large global survey 1120 neonatal care providers, 62 countries, concluded restrictions pandemic led general separation mother-infant dyads [[4]], also suggested entire family [[6]]. results confirm limited ability present hospitalized newborn global level show magnitude impact implemented restrictions.

Which leads believe parents taking care newborns, *the nurses are*. Thus, unvaccinated nurse *can* dangerous.  Thanks I‚Äôll look this. wearing face shield don‚Äôt think effective around potentially sick patients day. Ugh. deaths. long-term issues like POTS, brain damage, heart damage, CFS people left Covid. Nobody wants kids deal disabilities due preventable illness. ‚Ä¶ enclosed airplane.   mean rest us need put antivaxer ""some people"" contracted nurse required then, state, vaxed? Could fomites. relaxed washing shopping putting away. Thing is, I'll never know.  Folks like guy ignored many people trying warn months, telling stay safe. even ignored people like ended similar situations. folks like think anyone else like going listen them?

It almost feels like ego stroke reward wrong thing long. kind late redemption‚Äîespecially since idea collateral damage others due individual‚Äôs choices. Meanwhile, Bumblefuck upstate NY, many staff walked bc vax mandate can‚Äôt deliver babies one hospital. words stupid become. dumb live.

Repeat necessary. thought idea around world get everyone vaccinated they're holding back eligibility manufacturers trials determine safety dosing details younger age groups? live Canada province live already vaccinated 80% 12-17 yo population. assumed countries started vaccinating earlier already vaccinating teens. point trying make COVID vaccines around similar amounts time now. afraid unknown vaccine side-effect popping 10 years now, ignoring possibility long-COVID could also unexpected effect decades infection.

I clearer, said 'long-term' meant 'much longer time first vaccine trials, now'. Sadly, low vaccination rates - young people eligible vaccine - need additional tools manage community spread, too. hospitals overwhelmed, affects everyone, unvaccinated. Get vaccine receive two free tubes apple flavored horse dewormer. Yum yum. citation shows spike protein vaccines unable bind pericytes? seen this, intuitively convincing either.

Your statement risks vaccine vs covid infection regarding spike protein binding correct, reason vaccines sill safe amount mRNA deposited much smaller getting actual covid. However, saying binding can't happen vaccine, people wondering increased rates myocarditis perhaps shot incorrectly administered (into bloodstream opposed muscle). Still reason get vaccine, important precise say things know. citation wrong, apologize, please send me. saying 9/11 inside job? believe goodness hard work always leads success, evil laziness always leads failure. asshole position

Idk. think worldview almost always leads asshole. maybe rectal position.  Also rural California.

Their base isn‚Äôt full leaders critical thinkers, they‚Äôll ultimately fall line they‚Äôre told. still advocating vaccination. Last time Alabama got booed.[former president trump booed telling supporters get don‚Äôt think staying office would help. Same. Science cool. stops health system overwhelmed vaccines effective hospitalization. resident physicians work call days 24-28 hrs straight sleep. Expect bump R soon israel. We're holiday season, week ago families got together Rosh Hashanah.

My mother asked everyone rapid DIY test came one cousins, 16 year old two doses, came positive. mom may saved 92 year old aunts' life. drive home... potential long covid mild case would still concern, test would go lot returning me, personally, normalcy vaccination did. went high school Idaho promptly left. I‚Äôve lived lot states years, never seen another state backwards hateful persons color, LGBT, seek education. 

Many people, seen hospital, either disowned immediate circles change mind, altogether bury conspiracy. It‚Äôs sad didn‚Äôt need way.  kids rough life. Starting life Corona, political instability, climate change. reason kids 2020. None all. Covid currently accounts 6-7% UK deaths week according Well, not. Vaccines reduce long COVID chances 50%, according (preliminary) study topic. Good good enough.

I say pro-vaccine person - stay safe, fall misinformation. Breakthrough cases rising across country (mostly due delta) much still lose sense smell, taste, get brain fog.

Mask stay safe. replied comment saying ‚Äúmost doctors aren‚Äôt taught much actual science‚Äù. you‚Äôve stated, untrue. UK vaccine institute isn‚Äôt recommending universal COVID-19 vaccination otherwise healthy 12-15 year olds. sounds like government going offer anyway. pro-lifers asking vaccine mandate give birth? aware long COVID - talking much longer-term effects (like HPV virus eventually cause cancer decades infection).

We safety data vaccines going back year (or something ballpark). point people say scared long-term vaccine effects, ignoring fact also know effects COVID long infection (with 'long' several years, context). pregnant vaccinated, get covid really hope risk stillbirth still higher baseline. This

Why even going hospital? told covid us flu? get vaccinated pregnant.  thinking too. true. good many isnt much underlying data subject trust enough baby's life good portion getting vaccinated themselves. know two people personally vaccinated knowing pregnant signs point healthy babies latest checkups. This

Why even going hospital? told covid us flu? That's thing bothers pandemic, sheer selfishness entitlement. friends live work Central America, waiting vaccine, yet people get it, ignoring fact herd immunity critical going back ""normal"" (I actually hope change lot things, coming this), also protect vulnerable people communities can't vaccinate. height privilege refuse free safe vaccine help prevent long-term COVID symptoms minimum, rely advanced medicine available catch it, others around world access begging waiting vaccine.

And yet surprised, good bad, people's actions this. People know would give shirt back go protest business closures, feel ability get haircut hamburger without mask important health safety person providing service. parts community coming together help people get vaccines, masks, sanitizer; live, several distilleries switched booze sanitizer, immigrant communities definitely worked keep people safe healthy. That's signed for. link provided states JCVI didn‚Äôt take account society education system vaccine. evaluated provided opinion cost benefit vaccine individual child. Basically risk side effects low risk Covid severe children also relatively low vaccine less dangerous Covid theee estimates numbers low difference negligible. However reading article linked seemed suggest agency would surprised societal factors like increase safety reopened schools would outweigh things enough government would decide vaccinate population. I'm needle-phobe. ugly experiences childhood (one CSA) made entire medical climate triggering me. I'm diagnosed iatrophobic, pandemic constant pressure get vaccinated personal nightmare haha. Seeing think I'll able dodge much longer I'm biting bullet week getting shot. Multiple panic attacks day fun, I'd say worst part experience shamey/non-understanding climate surrounds issue.

Outside reddit I'm really comfortable discussing anyone since vaccine anxiety associated childishness cowardice. 
""Gee. Thanks.""

I support group. partner, past trauma, understands upsetting experience supportive. making impossible situation bearable. I've given people compassionate. tell, want understand. want yell.  get vaccinated pregnant, highly recommended doctors. Nah, even booed Lord Savior Donald Trump told go get vaccinated. crazy strong. whole idea added transmission prevention masking makes possible reopen venues without overwhelming health system. Probably. 

BTW, new info: papers subject came months months ago, want say winter 2020/2021.

You see discussion topic /r/COVID19 interested.  Yeah, definitely depends geography. reports south PNW. noticed many seem upset younger people (often families / kids) make.   record, admire ability function situations. I'm sure I'd able once, let alone multiple times without breaking.

Obviously risk heart inflammation Covid infection far, far greater actual virus steamrolling immune system. It‚Äôs well-researched documented. findings support prior findings. masked coworker?

Wait 5 days last exposure immediately begin show symptoms. PCR, rapid. go around others get negative test.   posts like still exist? I've seen almost hundred different variations headline. entire life I've flu once, 2009 swine flu, year I've never flu shot Thanks clarifying. wonder what‚Äôs happening Brazil also happening throughout Latin/south America?

Hardly anything fearful of. Even 100% vaccinated closed group virus still circulates still get breakthrough infections people viral loads, meaning yes chance mutation. 

So protect unvaccinated. Virus care infects us vaccinated unvaccinated person. assuming unvaccinated person already developed immunity. JCVI gotten basically everything wrong COVID, it‚Äôs surprising they‚Äôd end reversing mistake, too. article say antibodies. Covid, antibodies. Also, concern is, would someone works healthcare front liner, get vaccine, unless know something non-medical people know. mean, handful medical staff refusing, understand, enough they're shutting parts hospital people medical field saying, ""Yea, I'm getting that..""? makes person wonder. 

(Yea, know, I'm ready downvotes.)  Billy McFarland  Likely we've seen often people take seriously hits community. They've pretty escaped every wave untouched    No. global pandemic socializing without precautions literally one thing *shouldn‚Äôt*be right now.

We whole catalog tools like masks ventilation make socializing safe. Calling people callous selfish using simple measures know work entirely appropriate. Sounds like almost everyone work with. Bring vaccine mandate. think infection eyes, even via hand-to-mouth contamination groceries (unless fully sanitize probably do...) seems likely walking someone outside...though one publicized case Australia, still indoors IIRC.

I mean, offense, symptoms sound absolutely terrible. never flu life come anywhere close describe. ""not able move ten days even take shit"" something heard multiple people know gotten sick, vaccine. 

Hope family stay safe.  One favorite clients chatting day much hates antivaxxers. work vet clinic. went whole tirade loved every second it. main talking point lupus got vaccinated, there‚Äôs excuse ‚Äúother people.‚Äù I'd say would show (at least colloquial terms) think shows (if using right numbers).

If 1% chance winning drawing A, 2% chance winning drawing B, we'd say twice likely, chances double.

The problem they're comparing; like saying volvos safe car, 1000 times chances volvo mechanical problem vs chance dying Pinto.  Dang. guess situation likely unsymptomatic covid infection morphed daily headaches, fatigue, brain fog, numbness tingling, gaestro issues, that. mris brain thought ms, came back fine. can't tell I'm happy covid Deaths children doubled (more doubled actually) one month. March(ish) 2020 August 2021 seven kids FL died.... August 2021 TEN kids died. bonkers. strategy makes sense them....blows mind. Even saying true, still unknowingly spread someone OK. carefree attitude precisely coronavirus continues spread. virus could talk, would literally cheering people on. 

Look, get it. want over, easy. Vaccines alone enough stop virus; require strong nation's people stand together make sacrifices greater good. Look rationing draft WW2. Rationing alone win war, draft. countless components, like working factories, donating old metals, buying war bonds, more. 

Lastly, here's something think about: likelihood killed foreign terrorist attack America extremely, extremely low. Mostly happened long time. yet, still countless metal detectors airports full-body scanners; still take shoes electronics bags. one complains these, they've around 20 years. anti-coronavirus measures different? think rules around forever course, still far early cast aside. someone answer this, eli5: rolled vaccines 18, around 60% vaccinated, 23% 18, 5% exempt medical religious beliefs. 16% adults unvaccinated. considered horribly high? Yes would nice see remaining small % adults left unvaccinated, 5% us rely vaccinated people natural immunity. drastic?

Everyone hating unvaccinated people saying horrible things them. wishing dead, shame u even saying this, empathy, compassion.

The rate spread covid coming vaccinated unvaccinated people. people pushing hatred unvaccinated saying fault?

Yes get sicker unvaccinated, spreading everyone. people issue, people going work sick, getting tested ‚Äúbad allergies‚Äù week, over. sending sick kids school constantly, exhausting actually watch, poor school admin deal w parents argue saying vaccinated. Well still sick? Ya? Stay home!

Note, low balled % children currently US: make sure advertise hard doses going brown people.  wish people understood this. diseases terrible ways die. many states dragging rest union down. Many intelligent people leave backwards states prosperous opportunities. football stadium 74000+ people packed Plus vaccine shot arm muscles, away heart lungs

I Queensland, Australia, population 5 million. 7 deaths Covid far. sharp harsh lockdowns eradication - perhaps cumulative total 30 days far. Outside lockdown, everyone assumed virus free business carried almost normal (mostly without masks).

You could argue less immunity future variants now, maybe end worse far think government done good job delaying infection 80%+ vaccinated. Both, I‚Äôd wager.

Covid wrecked number. I'm sitting somewhere middle previous poster.

I think activities among vaccinated people (friends families) might okay continue. Let's say Thanksgiving Americans, hanging friends home drink - limited least semblance normalcy.

Huge indoor activities? Maybe postpone now? least situation gets better? Maybe still limit gatherings COVID hotspots? Idk. seems we're getting ahead suddenly act like 2019 again.

The dumb swayed anyways. Good news world whole. Bummer Europe.  Expression ACE2 higher people others immune system reacts differently different people. ACE2 increases age smokers. Hanging small groups (like friends family) unmasked still dangerous point. proportion vaccinated gotten third dose? West Virginia. last week, highest rate transmission US. research also shows natural immunity plus least one vaccine dose best protection. 

This true. research shows natural immunity plus least one vaccine dose best protection. None.

Alternatively, lots data shows people natural immunity suffer greater side vaccine side effects. They're brand new filters, sadly. Maybe wearing N95 one long gotten comfortable it? 100%. People need taking precautions, socially distancing, wearing masks even vaccinated. never take mask around people definitely avoid crowds (with exception occasional grocery shopping). concerns specific side effects? likely data would alleviate concerns. I'd happy give links. vaccinated happen get covid 2 weeks ago. Ever since I‚Äôve it. right ring finger pins needles feeling. anyone else tingling numbness hands?? I‚Äôm also really interested hearing third shot affects severity symptoms breakthrough infections and/or long covid risks.

If third-shot-breakthrough infections gradually creep back illnesses nearly universally negligible, (e.g. *actually* mild colloquial sense covid sense it‚Äôs still rough) risk long Covid completely decimated, I‚Äôd call huge win.

At point, say was, oh, talking mRNA spike interacting pericytes not, instead talking vaccine safe getting covid whatever. huge deal made be, argued back forth ton posts. Then, got weird, literally edited responses (and nice, btw), responded looked like talking void crazy. Then, deleted comments, presume looked insane. Personally, I've never seen anyone go trouble minor thing, especially right beginning asking citation, politely might add.

And fact stood claim, without evidence own, problem continued. thought caught asking cite claim, You‚Äôre literally person suggested can‚Äôt.

Since sound like expert.  Things looking good CT, ""wave"" really compared elsewhere. know warned New England truly ""Delta Waved"" later on, I'm cautiously optimistic. Don‚Äôt worry realize ,the statement stands pertaining article,And stupid ass replies unvaccinated know break system.  F*** you! Quite interesting. happens actually get ill, also deny use medication too? realize unvaccinated higher rate?

Its unvaccinated flooding system. Right now, get admitted covid.

By way, probably costochondritis. cause pain sternum. I've lower left ribs almost adult life. Cool cases going that's vaccines work That's difficult one. Good article. mRNA vaccine mostly try get muscle cells injected rather blood, go heart muscle. get myocarditis suffering virus shot likely give condition.

But.

What saying regardless whether get vaccine, spike proteins broken dead virus inside go blood stream harm heart like metal filings passing through.

So might still get heart damage recovering virus. Oh that's absolutely mask mandates back effect. Liars prolific sadly increasing numbers, driving spread, stressing hospital capacities. idea even said honestly can't remove ""political"" they'll remove ""not qualify information"". I've half stuff I've posted lately removed gotten real old. concede point. Holy water holy crackers included treatment‚Ä¶ one describing prefusion spike works. furin cleavage site responsible opening protein allows bind ACE2. Without this, cannot bind ACE2. receptors know Spike binds to, none super abundant Pericytes like ACE2 is, also either way spike would still undergo conformational change able bind binding domains receptors  Nope. vaccine stop getting covid bbut it'll decrease severity. need perfect storm room full vaccinated individuals get anything annoying symptoms. would ""normal"" times.  Oxygen, yes, 15L/m

Exposure, unknown, hardly leave house wear masks do. figure must recent, severity correlates viral load correlates rapid onset. cos he's downvoted mean he's wrong  here's thought, like, sounds crazy know, but....get different job? Sorry make sense. Firstly absolutely nothing anti-vax. Even *were* correct wearing mask completely pointless, careful mean believe efficacy importance vaccination. Lumping overly cautious people actively complicit spreading COVID incorrect insulting. Also, I'm confused ""genuinely worried"" about. Even people wearing masks unnecessarily, matter you?

Secondly, points make efficacy vaccine reducing spread valid, ignoring countervailing factors *increase* people's chances spreading COVID: 1. middle huge spike cases, chance given person interact infectious hugely increased. 2. limits left social contact, chance contact infected people *and* vulnerable people might infect also increased.

Even vaccinated wearing masks reduces infections 1%, that's worth hospitals near breaking point thousands people dying. Arguments mandating another thing, idea actively bad pure hygiene theatre clearly wrong-headed. Yes can, lots jobs there. know intricate details mRNA vaccines (or them) basic understanding vaccines general generalise you, I'm say supposition would need verification validation accepted gospel :)

With said, vaccine's job train immune system recognise neutralise certain proteins, present certain microbial agents viruses bacteria. pre-training immune system way, antibodies present real agent comes along, or, they're not, body remember produce therefore react quicker eradicate microbial invaders.

In case mRNA vaccines, proteins we've chosen train immune system on, expressed spike protein. possible (but remember know certain) we're training using subset proteins real spike contains. Alternatively, perhaps spike protein mRNA vaccines cause cells create exactly compatible original. look same, they're counterfeit create functionality meet cardiac pericytes.

So again, can't say certain case without digging much deeper (and probably point I'd head anyway) certainly believable mRNA proteins produced sufficiently similar provoke immune training session, sufficiently different unwanted inflammatory side effect.

Hope helps, fence you. Yes public health crisis.... shitty immune system doubt they'd able fine leaving situation danger. 

I guess there's point complaining willing leave. know situation, that's is, that's choice. Feeling bit nauseous, somewhat achey, slight headaches.

I mean, symptoms point different things - including basic dehydration. panic hard. actually sounds less reasonable, Comrade Vaporub. exemption process per recent federal mandates? so, think feel wee bit better whole exemption thing. wee bit. think.  would ask her, vaccinated polio?

The data I've seen seems inconclusive effective virus preventing transmission (as opposed symptoms).  
 
To clear, probably slow transmission somewhat surface level. may offset fact tranmission still possible vaccinated people likely new strains. Vaccinated people contract virus less likely know it, therefore probably likely unknowingly pass others. Someone symptoms less likely come work spread virus.

That, like, totally explains hospitals overrun 1000/day dying right now!!!!!!!!!! Denial hell drug. Using student population provided, students make 14.95% population 

Mississippi conducted 183,334 tests last 30 days. going assume testing rate throughout August, I'm going legwork state Mississippi. Also going assume testing evenly distributed population. So, 14.95% 183,334 total tests 27,403 tests amongst students. Dividing 18,825 positive test 27,403 tests administered students multiplying 100% yields **68.7% positivity**. approximation, even assumptions likely yield result closer real number dividing total student population.. know weird. drive lot job, saw tons ambulances, sirens. convinced given order use sirens. initial wave shut roads dead 3 times, figured sirens safe, want freak everyone out.

Also during, additional clarity  need ventilators longer breathing. Stay safe friend. 

I optimistic future agree weed educate Actually is, Argentina widely prescibed treatment also preventative. Also given healthcare workers public hospitals. sake simplicity, let's say 50% US case COVID. Let's also assume there's perfect overlap vaccinated infected - words, 50% unvaccinated infected, 50% (this probably entirely accurate, trying keep estimate simple).

That would mean that, addition 54% population that's immune full vaccination, half remaining 46% (or 23%) infected. Meaning approximately 77% US immunity. actually line seroprevalence studies released (I think remember one said 80% antibodies).

However, take account fact immunity either infection immunity wanes time, Delta cause reinfection previously infected wild type COVID. also think 50% US infected; reality, probably like 30-40%. Personally, would guess 60-65% US ""strong"" immunity, 70-75% level immunity, scientist.

I think see another ""wave' starting early December early February, smaller current wave we're seeing. that, people get vaccinated keep jobs, kids approved get doses, significant chunk population gets natural immunity, COVID burn out. likely never go away, think we'll see huge outbreaks hospital strain hit Spring 2022 Assuming we're talking US (since we're one countries even considering remote learning), cases dropping nearly everywhere. one hospital. statistics show 1 8 nurses neither vaccinated planning getting shot.  stock sometimes.

Given high vaccination rates such, expect winter 2020-21? Wow edgy I'm Germany I'm jealous. pandemic still much present everyday life hope improvement anytime soon. Another sub post full stories like this. number deaths due COVID-19 Arkansas increased 33 Saturday number hospitalized patients ventilators declined 24, according Arkansas Department Health.

Yeah, weird people dying would free ventilators. /s many going taking ventilator spots tomorrow turned beds? cared others death beds Covid. mistake true Christianity politics.

Sadly, many feel prophecy BS. think would first shots. I'm fully confident that. No...for two reasons. First data old. pre Delta lots things changed Delta. greater total overall infection, ""undercount"" reduced fewer people left get unnoticed infection. 4X back could 2X now, data exist, can't base calculation it. obviously can't properly track know.

Second, can't add infected people vaccinated people subtract total population. Millions people infected later vaccinated would counting twice. would allow overlap, know is.

The way get number want called seroprevalence surveillance. randomly test great numbers people see antibodies -- neither previously infected vaccinated. people still risk. Unfortunately regional surveys conducted vary greatly. Can't predict accurate national total.

All said, right. risk numbers going down. can't track it. FWIW heard number 80 million mentioned couple times recently number left US without antibodies. reasons mentioned, estimated guess. guess we'll know there's one left infect infections stop. Looks like nothing else going stop it. Hope provides helpful info regarding individuals &lt;12 Delta Variant:

Well, works close 100% af adults wear masks. creates safety margin lets us leave kids it. cant transfer one aspect COVID-19 measures without looking them. mother intubated 2 different occasions pre pandemic remember beeps also even sedation sometimes cough sets machine. hate seeing state. really devastating. ‚Äúbeing vaccinated by/around Thanksgiving‚Äù mean that‚Äôs start getting shots, that‚Äôs first considered fully vaccinated? anyone like who's never heard R0 hear ya. pointing SHORTAGE already. Offering better benefits, compensation, company culture wonders recruit person one company another shortage can‚Äôt manufacture new people education, licensing, experience short form. can‚Äôt apply tactics people applying unskilled jobs job like nursing highly skilled. Oh, we're losing nurses questionable intelligence? Oh no! Anyway   older people vaccinated children not. vaccine reduces severity illness, could expect ICU full unvaccinated people general, includes children. 

At time, like said, Delta seems infect children easily compared start pandemic. 

We also person classes many states forcing masks social distancing.

So probably complicated due many reasons instead one, guess. Idiots banned internet, yet are. videos convincing ppl opposite take horse medicine. Internet videos work. Says you? Okay. facts already there, choose ignore Oh god hope doctor right. daughter 2 January want get vaccinated badly. remarkably healthy considering everything (high risk pregnancy, 4 weeks early, consider lucky never needed NICU stay), goddamn able breathe vaxxed. feel like shoulders ears since pandemic started. Fair enough, I'm comparing experience relatives friends shorter bouts less healthy lifestyles compared mine.

I'm little surprised low grade fever gone away since Tuesday. It‚Äôs dropped *significantly*. early-mid 2020, Doctors putting Covid patients vents earlier, pressure lot damage. use oxygen masks, patients intubated last ditch effort. 

Plus delta variant‚Äôs motto ‚Äú*faster younger sicker*‚Äù. said, means take vaccine. part appears hysterical, wanting around people flu vaccine getting annoyed angry them.

But whatever, care. made observation cultural differences. It‚Äôs tough but, wouldn‚Äôt want newborn exposed diseased fucks.  allow vaccines may worse natural immunity?? enough studies.. ;) got vaccines (plural)! able find [this links more, please share. aware according article, conservatives susceptible misinformation liberals.

My original comment this. reason commented generalized findings saying Republicans act like this. study, see true. believe stereotyping people according political belief discriminatory. make broad generalization Republicans egocentric fact-ignorers unjust. trying promote greater harmony unity country, division. Hey, know Denmark exists, Nordic country don‚Äôt exists Finland! /r/finlandconspiracy media ability rewire people think emotionally respond situations.

I'm baffled lot people seems think fictional media this, effect fictional stories seems minor compared social media. propagandists know better, gamed social media system them. think people call flu claim always actually getting flu. lot people know think, thought, flu meant throwing up. upper respiratory illness. think people actually know flu is. Including point. also can't really confirm I've ever flu. I've plenty least colds. one awful horrible years ago suspect actually flu. But, know. one tested me. enough world getting vaccines fast enough. What‚Äôs worse list mammals get HUGE aren‚Äôt giving vaccine. Denmark one mutation Mink tried killed. animal populations get cause mutations pass back us (like flu birds way host species) makes potentially dangerous virus we‚Äôve ever seen.

Denmark recommends flu vaccine young people, retirement age people, groups. High cholesterol contagious therefore falls bodily autonomy terms treatment. cases possibly. Contrarian attention seeking.  It‚Äôs like aren‚Äôt decades records ‚ÄòControl Mississippi‚Äô Really country owe front line workers bare minimum, lifetime free therapy deal ptsd likely suffer years come.

I'm pretty sure gateway drug World Woo ""Food Babe"", apparently nutty snake-oil-ish ideas food. definitely type fall dihydrogen monoxide joke. hope so! frustrating watch subset population written ‚Äúthey unaffected‚Äù. capable protecting themselves, extra cautious young children. 

The truth was, remains, didn‚Äôt understand effects Covid-19 children, especially young children. gaining better understanding make informed decisions; turned politically motivated debate schools. 

If able dump kids daycare and/or school, we‚Äôve got priorities backwards 

On hand know tremendous amount physical, mental emotional development going First, I'm fully vaccinated many months now. believe whoever wants get vaccinated I'm vaccinations I'm politicizing believe mandates mandates NOTHING health, social control.

Second, Israel piece can't ignored well. funny everytime fully vaccinated person gets virus hospitalized called ""breakthrough"" case even though happening commonly now. mobile app very, serious bugs well known. Tech writers keep discussing fix ""next major release"", knows be.

Give vaccinated workers bonus higher salary. anniversary, reminds sound West Side Highway 9/11..I lived within spitting distance, whole day one incessant whine sirens making way downtown.

I sometimes wish every code televised.

Now idiots refusing vaccines, ones taking hospital beds, often lingering weeks ICU slowly choking death, leaving countless innocent patients cold, unable obtain acute care much legitimate medical concerns heart attack, accident, etc.

Yes US health system flaws, even best equitable health care system world would buckle pressure large segments population refusing vaccine middle pandemic, selfishly rushing hospital inevitably get infected fall ill. solution problem rationing healthcare resources putting antivax people bottom list. That's probably big part it...not really sure that's counterpoint lol. friend mine lives Denmark.

Everything went hell worth risk. long run, one year home going affect worse catching COVID terrible long term affects. could honestly say states.  Yet. seem 60/40 divide USA right now. plus side, 40 getting smaller every day. Right? Half time sound like absolute morons flip flopping. Didn‚Äôt initially say masks didn‚Äôt much back pandemic started? vaguely remember reading somewhere back March/April 2020, therefore wonder masking hesitation came that. clarify, strongly believe masking vaccines work. leaving medical clinic reason too. teach high school, A/C even working properly, safety policies open windows doors anywhere near school (security issues) windows open anyway newer built schools, new ventilation systems. teach wealthy school parents donated air filters teachers bought them, hardly rooms. teach progressive district masks decent union etc, funds redo ventilation. America, many states let open windows anymore many districts even states particular regulations. district mulled it, opted risk changing security policies. ES new ventilation either.  possible Croatia, give healthcare card everything entered one single database.

Boo That's false premise promote vaccination logically fails. countries similar infection vaccination rates doubling mandatory vaccination restrictions.

For example, Brazil, Sundays holidays lowest number meanwhile Tuesday larger numbers. , Although related hospitals, school district next one work go virtual indefinite amount time good chunk bus drivers quit mandate. already teacher shortage going right pretty much every school even know school work would go virtual good chunk money went getting new iMac desktops students, can't take home. said October awhile ago. couple months ago changed started saying early winter earliest due needing additional safety data. Looks like October original timeline might back table... Thank goodness. mortality rate vent? feel like I‚Äôve heard intubated vent it‚Äôs pretty much game over, somehow live, quality life vastly diminished. reasons:
1 Immune compromised folks like folks come already susceptible lots virus circulating around
2 lots unvacated folks virus continue circulate around theoretically could continue mutate. know path goes
3. Children 12 can't get vaccinated yet one immune compromised appointment system brought home grandparent got sick   Yes. short term metric? reasons -statistically- short term moving averages used, reasons relevant here? Question: doses Pfizer vaccine. However coworker close contact yesterday tested positive morning. get tested virus? so, immediately wait symptoms?  good chunk go pay job security, really doubt would fully staffed hospitals anywhere pay bad people want help people them. Don‚Äôt believe hell, anger towards institutionalized religion misdirected :/ it‚Äôs okay. You‚Äôre trying win brownie points website :/ Nah.. good. I'd swear number 92% weeks ago. Concerned. proves really care facts

I mean, many polls studies show this. believe election stolen. getting vaccinated. literally conservative ideology believe acting self interest, interest family, rest country moral, smart, just. grown town nearly 90% Republican, attest this.

They voted Donald Trump, man bloated ego Earth. countless studies claims find spend time researching pubmed socio-political journals. frankly, must Republican totally disconnected society see obvious patterns - offense. Cool go display amazing skills somewhere else mr awesomeness. Imagine best case scenario two parents baby get mild case breakthrough delta nurse right baby born. Ignoring fact baby 3 months old fever pretty much requires spinal tap, miserable would alone home newborn everyone sick bed even people could come help you, they‚Äôre able come home risk exposure. don‚Äôt even like dealing basic menstrual bleeding headache, full post partum bleeding, trying change blood diaper whole family sick. shitshow.  know lot people care much indoor rules got vaccine soon could get appointment. Covid plenty dangerous premie babies. Exactly. 

We know vaccines work well humans, let give smaller dosages kids done it. 

My older kid getting vaccines 12th b-day. wish sooner, month half waiting get it. hope they'll allow younger kids soon possible. great. what's advantage? people jabbed?   put everything display showing know nothing.. Absolutely! people never truly, truly dangerously ill that's think they're damn stupid comes infectious diseases. They've never felt absolutely, completely terrifying sick. 

I'm damn happy able pull experience. pneumonia sick like month half going back forth doctor treatment plan, sick fuck almost hospitalized. can't even imagine went through.

Although may change state state, variants different regions vaccination rate also different. 

The number way S√£o Paulo biggest state (46 million), already vaccinated 45% population two doses/Johnson 78% first dose Johnson. 

70% teenagers already got first dose S√£o Paulo City too.

S√£o Paulo registered 1389 deaths back April year. Today? S√£o Paulo registered 78 deaths.

3rd doses already applied week least. RemindMe! 3 weeks Bolsonaro done great job controlling spread covid know several November 2019 traveled Asia. getting media coverage countless magahats taking ivermectin INSTEAD getting free widely available vaccine, results massive COVID outbreaks country straining medical system.

Now taking ivermectin meant would catch sort nontransmissable form covid resulting suffering dying, sure big deal free country. However, truth idiocy hurting many innocent people community, that's antivaxxers obsessed ivermectin big deal. talking about?  mention mandates. assumed point lot people wore masks - surely happened least daily infections high. 6 year olds symptoms far. Nasal congestion definitely bothering most, sooo stuffy. temp staying around 100.4 actual cut even becoming febrile whatever caught definitely seem causing high fever. evening voice became pretty hoarse too. coughs seem ""gagging post nasal drip"" kinda coughs opposed chest.

So two options, chose one guaranteed bad outcome? why?

The vaccines amazingly effective even Delta, especially considering Delta transmissible *and* severe previous variants. Data like demographic adjusted ends underselling effectiveness mRNA vaccines (and j&amp;j too).



I think end 3 shot series (for mRNA) generate enough antibodies prevent infection Delta people. lot immunizations 3 shot series period months. People previously infected, especially Delta may end needing 2 possibly 1 shot generate antibody titers.

You also made random comment black communities made sense. Selfish people sound gives anxiety - son spent time NICU little vital patches kept falling setting alarms. hearing noise brings back time life. can't imagine living every day, knowing someone actively dying.  already noted, mentioned replies. using best available data, CDC does.

* need shut everything two weeks.

* new normal means facemasks forever.

* Vaccines end Covid.

Denmark, hand, realises end story ""defeating Covid"" reducing risk serious harms, something vaccines well, well enough remove mitigations.

The two lessons world needs learn next crisis (and least one horizon already - climate change) these:

1. world inherently complex every problem affects inherently complex result. (Although complex complete mystery, commentators ascribed almost mystical traits Covid ""why thought would... maybe smart enough immunity proof!... wooohhoohh!"", still ""just"" virus that's behaving exactly like viruses do.)

2.

The hospital forces vaccine onto unwilling, nurses rather quit get injection. 

There's three ways out:
A) mandatory vaccines fulfill job
B) lose lives nursing shortage would've lost covid
C) forcefully vaccinate nurses press forced labor gunpoint.

Which going be?

Option D) ""change mind nurses"" out. possible way change mind now, far political pressed much become position cannot retreat.

So. Drop vaccine mandate, lose thousands patients force nurses take injection work lethal threat? launched yet.

So suppose number would something actually showing children dying alarming rate rate higher infant mortality given year.  true great info, ignores reality long covid. I'm worried children dying, chances low. I'm worried long term complications. recently saw thing UK something like four percent children still report 3 symptoms sixty days infection. half percent kids life altering complications, that's lot kids. remember last year ice hockey one biggest risks covid children.  Excellent think depends generation. genX actual flu times, flu shots wildly available, haven‚Äôt since. kids (gen Z) never it. don‚Äôt care children ill? know get hospitalized, die long covid, don‚Äôt care?

What number children need die see problem? What‚Äôs acceptable level unnecessary child death Covid? end cos pandemic selfish now. That, major sports leagues ceasing activity months lost respect Covid deniers. REALLY think billionaires going leave money table reason? REALLY??

I'll get libs little dog too! Trump voter? Sounds like everyone getting 3rd booster endgame covid  country. I'm Europe. started topic USA situation seems similar everywhere there's here.

Well media I'm living fact educate people knowledge expect medical community remains silent. brought here. Hey *suuuper* remind anyone else 9/11 footage? IDK why, think sort way shot cut, emergency vehicles sirens long, weird quiet periods, feels exactly same. could snip pixels edit directly 9/11 footage nobody would notice. Give vaccine people still chance nurses won‚Äôt get vaccinated helpless newborns, need leave. selfish care vulnerable patients. Maybe stupid question animals get sick die way do? lot school districts trade schools anymore. city still though popular. one Ukrainian Citizen. No, airlines rules countries. would allow get one plane regardless documents using. here. go public places infrequently possible always wear mask. Someone always something say. don‚Äôt even acknowledge them. Idiots.

I‚Äôve trying everything right since beginning. it‚Äôs gonna get even worse people pissed Biden‚Äôs mandate. ok? Delta: Delta killed people Delta. Stay safe Delta. heart goes healthcare workers. wary words ‚Äúvery healthy individuals‚Äù referring adults US.

Said ridiculous. couple weeks later, would tell every day two, ""I can't believe listen you."" time said anything.

I ADD, takes associated anxiety panic really sear things brain. still remember everything, like do. felt like slow-motion tsunami coming shores, here.

That guy Westchester, whose friend brought NY Presbyterian put REGULAR ROOM thought pneumonia. Watching spread start. here, there, first known cases contact - dreaded ""community spread.""

Then, terrifying headline, NY Times, second week March - ""It's Everywhere Already."" STILL instant testing freely available home. US Government mailing kits weekly every person country. tell can't it. Pretty much seems. private companies still mask requirements. looks like still want masks hospitals too. abolished. still fear Covid-19.

One really cool thing masks required anymore public Delta dangerous classic infection -- believe twice likely land hospital unvaxxed.

Yes, antibodies needed Delta prevent infection. I'm sure fighting infection, viral load body higher overall -- certainly places shed virus, given severe classic, would imagine would case. However, T/B cell immunity generated vaccine previous infection *is* relevant helpful infected -- vaccines still pretty good severe outcomes Delta overall, though debate believe around waning immunity people, thus May ask source statement delta variant requiring higher antibody levels ""classic"" variant?

This article summarizes well, cites research paper: currently big push vaccinate young

Young antibodies unless already infected, lot are. true less likely need care, like adults non-negligible proportion ending long covid, many people arguing vaccinated help avoid this. covid new disease, know long-terms effects, that's one reason people trying get vaccinated. argument also made know long-term effects vaccine, understand vaccines, including mRNA vaccines, much better covid, that's risk calculus there. larger, perhaps contentious, argument vaccinate young (I'm talking 30 under) primary sources infection, therefore spread. spreading everyone else society, due long covid mentioned (1-5% people catch covid suffer debilitating long covid according UK study), important keep case counts low. vaccine shown help reduce chances long covid, many unknowns still there, many people feel vaccinated adults also ""[virtually] fully protected"" severe outcomes get breakthrough cases. **TLDR risk young people low, live bubble infecting older people around driving rates infection really high right now.** I‚Äôm sick this. misrepresentation, bastardization ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù means America. Freedom mean get whatever crap want. never has. laws, regulations, policies, taxes, expectations exist functional society keep civilized. It‚Äôs price pay enjoy benefits society. drive right side road, get kids tons vaccines enroll school, pay taxes. aren‚Äôt allowed spit people, kick cat. freedom choose highest ideal country. now, people want play oppression olympics fo suddenly care freedom choice. crowd saying ‚Äúmuh freedom. It‚Äôs highest ideal land‚Äù also tend ones fighting woman‚Äôs right choose happens body, gay couples right choose get married. Freedom choose didn‚Äôt mean crap people then!

You enjoying benefits civilized society. benefits always come responsibilities. vaccinated protect (with herd immunity) fellow citizens absolutely falls umbrella. OBLIGATED benefitting member society part keep collapsing. choice, chose selfishness. chose stubbornness. chose individuality nation supposed built unity. United States. ‚ÄúUnited‚Äù. chosen divide country ‚Äúfreedoms‚Äù never existed. 

Unless forgot umpteenth amendment says men inalienable right die preventable illness stick libs. hey, far right crowd want kill left, enjoy generation Republicans can‚Äôt get voted office asinine rhetoric got entire voter base killed. Enjoy freedoms.  think virtual. don‚Äôt kids can‚Äôt fully understand hardship homeschooling, chronic fatigue syndrome. I‚Äôve 20 years scared going mass numbers long Covid cases young people. I‚Äôm severely disabled. shouldn‚Äôt opened back delta variant unless 100% staff students vaccinated, even need mandatory masks well-ventilated classrooms. months away children getting vaccine. crazy too.  data number recoveries? members resigned worked clinical positions like nurses, therapists technicians

I like point actual Doctors list. moron terms, can‚Äôt fix stupid. It‚Äôs gotten point don‚Äôt go out, necessarily Covid, absolutely fucking crazy people there. mask mandate indoor places province, doesn‚Äôt stop idiots yelling put mask walking across parking lot grocery store, pretty much place I‚Äôve year. Unless vaccine resistant variant took hold. we'd world hurt cuz we'd perfect storm vaccines plus willpower shutdown stay home. Even vaccination, vulnerable still risk

Source? people great time, actually spend time child otherwise would able to. Yeah probably. went panic attack hospital reopened ward style Covid ICU. one made alive. quit April it‚Äôs significantly better. Social media sites rose power time period. anything stark case study facebook amplifies propaganda  heart hurts. story like mine. remember everything too. Breakthrough infections matter much hospitalisations, severe disease deaths down. called Drs dissect details want spin data context, simple graphs lie. Look drastic drop UK hospitalisations deaths since vaccinations introduced. Bear mind we've Delta variant exploding since least July restrictions. case numbers great we'd screwed without vaccinations. need made complicated anyone makes trying cause confusion mean anything saves peoples lives good, Million Dead countless others long term conditions virus several vaccine options avaliable - meh

1min TikTok Video - Oh wow guess serious

&amp;#x200B;

How get like this? crazy time. gave anecdote. wife school nurse substitute teacher ended close contact spent substantial time 250 kids maskless. 

That‚Äôs 250 students exposed. went home families. So, family two adults home, thats 750 people. siblings easily puts number 1000+ people potential exposure. 

That‚Äôs quickly goes. day lessons kids, could looking 1000‚Äôs people risk next morning. reason kids aren‚Äôt going quarantined two weeks daily testing kids wore masks. 

It‚Äôs nuts. Cloth better nothing. protect others narrative born necessity. Basically supplies low needed everyone mask source control personal protection improve overall effectiveness, compared nothing. People including experts keep saying cloth enough everyone wears least source control. actually great (just better nothing) people absolutely getting infected poor fitting and/or filtering masks.

This perfect, illustrates concept relatively well. contact time way Delta varient fair based hardest filter particle sizes. Cloth temporary Heading winter, brave stance. respect resilience collaborative spirit population carp whine needs modified future. think following links might information seek:

One pulmonologist sat hospital said, ‚ÄúI would call PTSD, can‚Äôt seem get ‚Äúpost‚Äù part.‚Äù  Yes correct line thinking, though modernas efficacy 95% delta, vaccines 80% below, vaccines absolutely increase chance get infected thus transmit. I‚Äôm sorry. fellow Americans assholes too. didn‚Äôt happen way. First babies understand. mother miss fun can't pregnant, keep mostly concerned weight gain. lot people able WFH better years stimulus money.

People kids cooped full year deciding another crazy. absolutely get vaccine. may may immune reaction. get fevers every vaccine, flu, tetanus, immune system works. husband side effects, neither parents. Definitely sore arm days. worth potentially feeling crummy days help protect hospitalization death. EDIT: antidepressant fine. one got mine, millions got vaccine. issue.

Yes indeedy naive.  deep shit?

Because many country innumerate?

But we've thankfully wandered away error, come conclusion medical community has: wanes super quickly....Basically, seems elderly vaccinated months ago may severe risks got 2 shots back then.

Why yes, boosters coming wondering America preparing third doses much planet one etc etc etc etc.  Honestly, troopers.

Seriously though, people babies left right around me. Take precautions, sure, nobody going wait 3-4 years see thing pans starting family. fully vaccinated never questioned it, went covid beginning went badly. 

This video is... overwhelming. feel really lucky pulled  could weird coincidence? getting flu shot every year without problems. next two came weird reactions. Turns somewhat allergic eggs now. Going try ‚Äúegg free‚Äù shot year. Again...unvaccinated dumb shits get priority service COVID related illnesses. already do. they're still working. know introduced deer populations, live open could've contaminated wastewater. See e.g. Hopefully ruled captive gorillas. believe God.   Kids school mask. significantly better neighboring schools without masks. first time went Target lockdown started surreal experience think I've ever had. Dead silent, one making sound. Everyone avoiding going aisles others. Every shelf nearly empty. husband wife talking low said something made roll eyes responded something like ""it's end fucking world that's worried about?"". Crazy times. religious exemption medically documented (PCR+) case covid-19 within last 3-6 months so. home tests count.  Pretty funny obstetrical team would tell mother ""try wait,"" know process actually works.

It's kind pre-emptive victim-blaming. ""Sorry, Attending-Physician, refused wait.""   counting hospitalizations single week fraction total population

This true, know getting upvoted. data (from CDC) fraction total population, rates per 100,000 people. click links provided, would see chance hospitalization death much higher kid actually tests positive COVID stats include people infected. 

Source? You‚Äôd think. alas‚Ä¶..here are. What‚Äôs LGA? One shot 63.9% decent surely enough achieve herd immunity. Really curious see plays across world. Korean native, etc know might driving cases? No, numbers pulled updated üòä. one gets buildings without filling electronic covid questionnaire daily. Every questionnaire tracked accounted get stats.

Our sites located larger cities. may explain numbers skewed higher average.   doubt vaccines. doubt people's willingness trust them. group 99% vaccinated people quarantine one another. well, die problem technically fixed. I'm making comparison soundscape linked OP constant alarms ICU ambulance sirens NYC. romanticizing anything. I'm pointing two different soundscapes drive home horrific situations represent. anti-vaxers even read? would think wold understand could. Except doesn‚Äôt individual basis. four year old Texas far many preemie infants born c-section dead moms ventilators sad. ten years time look back pandemic realize failure vaccinate young children prior school year greatest mistake. Dude, people like part problem. wrong field. Yea, need know read New York times. Apparently not, anti-vaxers. really don‚Äôt smart know vaccines safe effective. How's covid situation tho? mean, everyone gets flu decided third kid year üòÖ I'm due early December...and healthcare (RNs). Definitely ideal time two kids still young enough school (2.5 &amp; 4) risk bringing Covid home, I'm one year away 35, wanted get baby years way... Technically...

Babies get lot protection mom via breast milk. every Dr know recommended breast feeding least 6 months. Ok article talk 5-11 years 6 mo-2 years?! I‚Äôm confused left 3 4 years?! Seeking religious exemption insult religion.

And that's really saying something, organized religion sanctioned every great evil known humanity. hell 20 percent cases vaccinated people? Go nurse, jobs opening up. hear dont smart. Congrats unexpected author! kinda write something took off? That‚Äôs dream able write books income. I‚Äôll probably get degree form community college free community college bill ever passes. 

Did program along time trusted work remotely? Good. Anti-vaxxers don‚Äôt deserve medical industry. I'm surprised it. Humans always reproduced hardest times. biological standards, pretty normal. dealer. Considering vaccines historically stopped pandemics, would say odds vaccines bringing pandemic endemic level highly likely. 
 
Here fun diseases vaccines helped with: thought again. Medical professionals understand vaccine safe effective COVID easily kill cause severe long term health issues. that‚Äôs advantage modern medicine, dna sequencing MRNA vaccines.  constantly check sites see one near (there isn‚Äôt). husband saying yesterday would drive 4-6 hours get gets trial could. We‚Äôve got 2 2, we‚Äôre beyond it. dramatic, feel trapped home days getting harder enjoy. first wave took physically weak. second wave went mentally weak. common medical professional uncertain vaccine...they know you.

They frequently don't. Virology, epidemiology, statistics, public health really figure RN MD training. They're specialized fields.

RNs MDs somewhat akin mechanics; fix you, quite well, substantial skill... degree metallurgy. can't tell physics steelworking, anodizing titanium, oil turned gasoline, number car-adjacent things. self correcting ... tests hard get, people vaccinate Boomers way higher vax rates generation mine. People 40 especially. Sorry doesn‚Äôt fit narrative.  I‚Äôm wondering 4 year old approve 5‚Ä¶ although age don‚Äôt think pharmacies give shots it‚Äôs gotta ped used listen police radio scanner app fall asleep to. (Yes, know, weird, white noise.) stopped March 2020 constant ambulance calls Coronavirus patients. listened since. Yeah daughter went 3 days 6th grade multiple kids already tested positive can't return 10 days. Oregon. Whatever fuck new strain is, looking new hosts. Fuck this, bad enough great grampa lived full life gets sick kids getting whole situation changes. much sucks might time shut back in.  felt reaction I‚Äôm even front lines. remember back worked ICU (decades ago, although I‚Äôll always consider critical care nurse) one timers Taco Bell places used sound. reaction visceral‚Ä¶‚Äùtriggered‚Äù, will. video hard watch. would roughly 2.1+ million deaths*

Yep, guesstimate we'll hit 900k-1m end this, 2 year period time 1918 pandemic. 

It's great that's half number population adjusted, took hundred years medical science get there, that's little scary. 

If think people saved days weeks ICU, likely would died 100 years ago.  Thank you!!! one she‚Äôs following medical guidelines wearing mask she‚Äôs passing anti-vax information Norway included joint purchasing vaccines member ECDC. immunocompromised wife going get third Pfizer shot day symptoms started. vaccinated patient covid ward.

Get booster. Ask switching shots also, dunno better mix them. feel like need start pushing back stigma people afraid vaccinations. want clarify dont' believe one second this, can't imagine shame helpful people resisting vaccination this. husband anxious injections, feel guy. situation sucks people feel way. IMHO, think whole thing letting people gather like pre-pandemic (without masks, large groups capacity limits) vaccinated bad idea point. getting breakthrough cases everywhere people keep saying ""it's rare"" numbers look rare. 

I sort think best rn maintain masking social distancing even vaccinated vaccinate people, especially 12 population. 

Unmasked crowds vaccination playing fire vaccine yet kids 12.

My whole househole fully vaccinated we're still things require vaccine passport right now. seems way risky. came say this. never nursing shortage. Schools spit regular like conveyer belt. Nurses always job matter go. (unless they're unvaccinated is) Certain places may less bc office politics find somewhere better pay benefits....but nursing shortage? Idk would ever actually see overall nursing shortage. Plus antivax nurses minority.  mean spike proteins generated mRNA vaccine also effect? infection halfway 2nd week August thus year, flu UK time year Maybe could sue covid  gave chuckle too! Thankfully, Reddit isn‚Äôt real world üòÅ wish people thought like you. I've amazed badly care amazed good way think others people know strangers. limited executive order emergency circumstances would solve problems. maybe really big problem. Idk.  feel like testing need calm minds masses. main fear virus knowing one severe/fatal case. Lool gettin downvoted. Great comment Exactly. really uncomfortable position in. shouldn‚Äôt tell doctor put mask on. Vaccine-derived immunity loses efficacy time, Delta makes worse. Kaiser Permanente showed efficacy infection Alpha fell 60% 5 months following second dose Pfizer, Delta 40-50%. Moderna holding better likely attributed triple-sized dosage.

In Israel, starting see loss efficacy even severe disease, efficacy severe disease death extremely biased elderly population, booster restoring efficacy severe disease back toward 90%, restoring protection infection toward 90% age groups. People 50 never showed major loss protection severe disease, protection Infection fallen near 30%.

It interesting see booster provides robust long-term neutralizing antibody response. normal circumstances vaccines dosage protocol would take years optimize, didn‚Äôt luxury. Yup. aunt caught shortly eligible vaccinated told doctor wait 90 days. Florida. 90 days recommendation MA, well. Mu gets going, I'll go back fill face P100.  never trust vaccine. see need. know sounds strange never ever gotten flu entire life. I've gotten tons colds, flu. Even coworker came work flu, shortly pandemic began. worked small, badly ventilated space, mad heck dragging sorry ass work risking infecting us all.  Fortunately, kids 5 able get fully vaccinated months. finally acknowledged aerosol transmission July 2020, substantial misinformation first six months pandemic. Oh no. pray ok fast recovery. oxygen? coworker, younger healthier spend almost two weeks hospital oxygen home oxygen, totally vaccinated too... bad know exposed? worry totally airborne, clouds it...   never nursing shortage. may seem way be. Plus think thousands upcoming graduates. Wait, definitely do. absolutely see long-covid looks like. Chronic heart failure, CAD, cardiomyopathy, pulmonary fibrosis, stroke, cognitive impairment, much more. know surviving isn‚Äôt best outcome get it, rather surviving without long lasting and, many cases, permanent debility. flip side, countless millions people around world vaccinated, started year ago clinical trials. side effects some, even concerns serious rare complications, generally people still walking around without organs leaking skin labor delivery wards busy ever. Unfortunately mother valuing hypothetical risk vaccine higher proven risk COVID. care yourself, get vaccine. disease nasty. They're literally risking family's life encouragement sociopaths spreading disinformation keep viewership numbers high. 

Those sociopaths absolutely vaccinated. serve deterrent though. anything it'll encourage die home.

I see downside here. mention cough/sore/throat/loss smell, headache burning eyes. Could infected eyes? wearing full-face before, looked really creepy ridiculous (this Delta), I've settled half-face glasses too. Maybe mistake...  far question wind social distancing, likelihood, it‚Äôs pretty much wash. Although viral particles carried farther windy day, wind would also offset potential danger dissipating particles point they‚Äôd pose little risk. So, unless downwind someone actively coughing direction, you‚Äôre probably safe maintaining six-foot distance. And, meteorological conditions aside, you‚Äôre anywhere vicinity someone actively coughing covering cough way, immediately put much distance individual possible.‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt want unvaccinated person helping deliver baby!  Pretty sure knew start?  Thanks - yeah think agree case protests front hospitals uniquely Canadian? I've seen 28 Days Later Delta I‚Äôve seeing doctors nurses discuss vent COVID survivor rates around 20%. Uh, yes, is. know COVID spread airborne aerosols, droplets. Social distancing concept based outdated understanding virus spreads. There‚Äôs reason focusing masks, vaccines ventilation, distancing snd surface sanitization.

Of course, even aerosol transmission distance factor, overall capacity limits still helpful. distant transmission COVID beyond 6ft absolutely possible. Zoo‚Äôs statement:

‚ÄúAlthough masks gloves already worn Gorilla Care Team team members inside gorillas‚Äô indoor areas preparing outdoor habitats, additional preventive measures, N95 masks, Tyvek¬Æ suits, modified cleaning protocols increased ventilation gorilla building, instituted.

I know much 'riskier' vaccine compared covid (which think shows)
I'm asking show? anything  suspected zookeeper tested positive, according Zoo‚Äôs statement. still hard time rationalizing virus evade procedures full PPE. remember December 2019, China announced building hospital Wuhan going least 5k hospital beds, going build hospital week. it. Basically built quarter NYC's total hospital capacity within week.

That caught attention. Five thousand hospital beds lot; 62 hospitals NYC equal 26,000 beds. Chinese press release, started prep clients WFH future (I'm consultant), got migrated ready week spare Virginia issued lockdown order. cut on-site hours, essentially telling people emergency on-site, since would visit one client day, showered visit. office reported office worker caught COVID, member household infected, physically visit office two weeks. Fortunately, 98% job could done remotely. concern personally thought could handle COVID (not wanted test theory), stand thought potentially dragging disease clients offices. fears took particular measures.

Even today, visit clients' offices (except one, even work home before) unless necessary. I'm vaccinated, uptick Delta variant cases, I'm back wearing mask cutting visits offices recent COVID cases.  Aww hell no, I've never done that. There's kindness delivering news loved one someone desperately calling died. news world shattering, me, I've always felt letting minutes normal delivering words break world kindness. anyway, Death notifications on-scene law enforcement's wheelhouse I'm at, know always attempt person possible.  major reckoning incoming antivaxxers.

Corporate America wanted vaccine mandates while, since COVID disrupts business increases cost benefits. Federal mandates give additional legal cover. would conserved about, standing 6 feet apart ineffective certain circumstances (it is), full PPE procedures employed hospitals useless? Quick google search shows antibodies protect throat nose mouth dont make bloodstream Yes. antibodies permanent offer limited temporary protection. Normally, Immunity breast milk effective first 6 months life maybe maybe not. ‚Äúkids don‚Äôt catch it‚Äù rhetoric embraced whole heartedly manipulated, downtrodden working class afraid alternative it. 

As turns out, duped rich influential keep powering through. patients actually believe this. Measles eradicate, extremely rare due vaccines. I'll take style ""failure"" that's mean.  Ya touched several nerves. Idaho famous potatoes  Figure 2 seems show infant mortality US clearly dropped throughout 20th century remained reduced throughout 21st.

The gist article racial disparities US's international ranking gotten worse infant mortality rate improved, not? mean, sounds like typical bout seasonal flu. great, still nothing used care much.  selfishness beyond scope. think science getting clues due people post active covid infection still trying get back normal months after. Weird thought vaccine would make infertile kill baby. Funny works out. üòÇ encourage average man vaccine, would effective campaign I‚Äôve seen.  Ohhhhhkkkaaaayyyyyy. that's subject hand.

Yeah I‚Äôm beyond pissed well. original mild variant going around, kept kids home managed parenting working. dangerous variant going around, sending kids packed classrooms protection. 

Even many people Reddit would cry last year people going out, parties. they‚Äôre vaccinated, they‚Äôre like ‚ÄúiTs MiNiMaL rIsK kIdS‚Äù. Society forsaken us. Next time, there‚Äôs ‚Äúplease keep kids inside help older population out‚Äù situation, im giving shit believe next years one bad wave next. keep dealing reactive basis. believe one two things happen.

I city meeting large contingent anti-maskers, antivaxxers, anti-vaccine mandates showed up. heard local hospital's staff discuss mandates plans truly required vaccinate leave standing outside meeting. Yeah really want ventilator. possible survive possible recover, people survive, never same.   Cases big UK. 28k cases reported today, 36k cases reported last Sunday.  recall finished within 2 days buying it. regrets.   Really? Every major gynecological prenatal group came August states recommended pregnant women receive vaccine. wife got first knew pregnant (been trying years) held working home see anyone, really. soon recommendations science showed get it, got 2nd dose next day BombKirby sounds reliable though, aren‚Äôt seeing people drinking humans??!? /s     ‚ÄúPause baby deliveries‚Äù

I rarely see family, aside ones live with. Thanksgiving Christmas two biggest recent ones. made sure coronavirus seeing one another. 

I really go grocery store anymore; try everything delivered. last time actually inside store maybe 4-5 months ago, Delta began take off.  Comparing risk nothing question all. personally relieved media pounding yet another type negative doomsday reporting.

A lot areas pretty much covid restrictions summer. people stadiums restaurants, bars, public places, etc. months think football game going change anything one way another. Many vaccinated, not, vaccinated likely exposed somewhere else.

This going indefinite future. Covid never go away, public events, unfortunately everyone get vaccinated. Like anti-mask Alaskan legislator who's ban Alaska Airlines can't get capitol. Yes, live here. Upper West Side, one highly vaccinated areas. There's mask usage supermarkets places city. 100%, even 90%, but, given high vaccination rate, vaccinated people wearing masks shopping, etc. ‚ÄúI mean sure caused death 600,000 Americans thought funny joke.‚Äù event lasting hours cause single generation spread.  (A infect B, C, D, etc., game, none B, C, D, ... infectious anyone else couple days).  Would harder distinguish (say) spread restaurants without detailed contact tracing.

Contrast Provincetown case cluster, centering around series parties overlapping sets revelers course two three weeks. yep, pretty much everything remote month two doc wrong says 90% efficiency means 100 10 get covid. exposed virus 90% less likely get virus? Take baby üôÑüòé Oh. know that. ""unnecessary"". fully implemented instead half-assed approach, asymptomatic spread could cut significantly. 

You still get coronavirus even fully vaccinated, still spread said coronavirus even symptoms. People like pretend like reason; know make feel better what. whatever reason, ignoring problem going make go away. I've thought whole time, able articulate way make sound like heartless witch. got pregnant late 2019 second (and last) kid August 2020. thought experience another pandemic pregnancy newborn stage...no thank you. rhetoric people Twitter borderline anti-vax I‚Äôm genuinely worried. I‚Äôve seen number comments along lines ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fully vaccinated don‚Äôt want infect anyone wear mask‚Äù. 

There‚Äôs much wrong line thinking. [Vaccination reduces chance infection upon exposure 80% respect baseline concern viral transmission vaccinated individuals 1/5 unvaccinated people. top that, 90-95% reduction severe illness means mild asymptomstic breakthrough cases come lower viral loads. Even more? viral loads similar irrespective vaccination status, [viral loads decrease faster vaccinated adds additional point reduction terms potential transmission. start multiplying out, equation radically different overly broad refrain ‚Äúvaccinated people still spread wear mask‚Äù. 

At point another, people really need start acknowledging 1) powerful vaccines even face variants 2) much masking high-vaccination-rate environments mostly feel-good rather really decreasing spread much think is. school? Sure. bar checks? No. sure 500 number young kids odds harmed either covid vaccine incredibly low. US something like 500 fatalities 650k, population 74 million people age 18. Meanwhile vaccine rare side effects myocarditis ballpark extremely rare. UK, decided vaccinate healthy kids age 12-15 part reason, marginal benefit vaccine tiny risk.

The numbers however completely flipped elderly. odds getting sick dying virus hundreds times higher, thousands pre-existing health conditions, vaccine provides major benefit.

There analysis risk roughly doubles every 7 years age, 74 year old 512x risk 18 year old. Great contribution discussion. confidently incorrect too. Look studies dumbass. children here. One best decisions. happy story. young woman started things like ""being emotional"" ""having opinions"", dad lobotomized.

So end catching up, no. True, cohort reperesentative entire population. Grad school usually means younger people, 40 years-old, least middle class wealthier. bring exception area. back December 2020.

Wear masks, stay away big gatherings unvaccinated people, cut travel, least things calm there's lot data yet, research show breakthrough infections lead kind persistent symptoms characterize long COVID, including brain fog, fatigue ""Some mild cases go long COVID, factor in,"" says. mean ""continues""?

If mean damage lasting, yes, possible permanent heart damage heart inflammation, general. studies myocarditis covid showing damage via cMRI weeks/months infection.

If mean damage still growing infection cleared? right person answer (hopefully someone else chime in), believe thought also possible, body still inflamed infection, inflammation cause damage too.  Shhh, ruining narrative!

Therefore government decided go ahead anyway option parents children. added caution conscious potential side effects kids. often wonder people post questions answered 5 second Google search.  Vaccinated people spread virus infected, means breakthrough infection, means 1 10,000. Masks mandated everyone.

You want hear speech bad times bad reasons kids, region‚Äôs lack science based sex education, poor contraception access abortion bans detrimental society general ask her. Ireland one highest vaccination rates world, even schools reopening still major spike effects vaccines, masks, distancing ventilation, mention mountains sanitizer every shop, building public transport.

In 5 weeks, get rid restrictions outside hospitals schools, apart masks. lead measures eased, everyone gets vaccinated. definitely want unvaccinated health care professional delivering baby. 

I dont know medical profession refuse vaccinated. Good riddance. It‚Äôs supposed give enough time fix whatever‚Äôs wrong, like something came disconnected something. longer two minutes enough someone die something critical isn‚Äôt fixed. It‚Äôs intended repeatedly silenced over, even often are. might starting fields locker rooms, lot athletes classes nonathletes. gonna spread we're gonna shut again. can't get vaccine it.. wish fired point honest. almost two year pandemic, person mindset place healthcare. find new profession can‚Äôt bring trust groundwork(science) current profession. also needs temporary. Like certain amount time, make vaccine mandatory. Otherwise, people gotten sick work made people sick work. antivax coworkers told dance. Well thanks providing knowledge Kentucky man, would done without you. ‚Ä¶.not long. ü§∑üèª Diabetes fucking awful. wish worst enemy. Sure, manageable, actively makes life lot difficult (and expensive, depending live) needs Yeah. would guessed. Thankfully Kentucky guy checked out. Science shown natural immunity may offer better long term protection Delta vaccination alone, best protection still natural immunity plus least one dose vaccine. correct. apostles understood this.

Acts 5:29 ""Then Peter apostles answered said, ought obey God rather men."" True. kind circlejerk posts, like endless ""study proves masks work"" posts. [Fauci said EUA 5-12 first half truly appreciate it. saying acceptable, given many, many things DeSantis deliberately chose could prevented deaths? Yup. understand workforce vaccinated office, fuck let's send kids back school without them. Oh let's make lunch recess safe healthy, course can't force wear masks freedum pretty sensible actually, though needs come strong info campaign dangers acquiring COVID without vaccine vs. ‚Äúdangers‚Äù getting vaccinated. Diabetes issue sure. I‚Äôve kids diabetes classroom it‚Äôs nightmare manage times, sucks try play insulin pump gets hit, it‚Äôs constant checking apps make sure they‚Äôre still okay drain. yet still acting like isn‚Äôt big ass risk kids get covid: People school, vaccine mandate ~99% us vaxed, literally calling required testing vaccinated people. think required testing keep reassured, I‚Äôm honestly afraid it‚Äôll opposite effect, especially don‚Äôt say many cases asymptomatic, non-serious, etc - people see high raw case number, freak out, go remote. point vaccine prevent infection. future sister-in-law due next week, ER nurse get jab well visibly pregnant. also working entire time Covid &amp; Tuberculosis patients (yes, there's currently also TB outbreak going on) rolling ER.  Doubled: previously 7, 17.  lot diabetes instigated: home town one city away, health system sent reinforcements epicenter morning help citywide testing First, actually don‚Äôt know death rates children accurately across globe places like India zero way check numbers.

Second, risk children ending getting long term issues viruses pretty great. Type diabetes rates waaaay last year. people diagnosed Type children pretty strong evidence linkages comes post viral infection. two children diabetes class (type I) diagnosed holidays really bad flus fall. doctor advised school teams handling medical needs explained pretty much understand happen.

And also seen pretty hard evidence yes Covid another virus attacks pancreas cells too:   Like things, enough money anything possible. Possibly, believe they‚Äôre typically denied can‚Äôt proven COVID contracted within scope work duties (vs. catching outside work like store, family member, etc.) ""used fetal cells development"" mean ""everytime make new dose vaccine use fetal cells"" ""they used fetal cells research inventing vaccine""? sure every formally announced come risk infection fomites like 1 10,000. U idiots realize vaccinated still pass virus right? cuz don‚Äôt get sick , still contagion. Smfh  COVID poses little risk young people anyway. university explosion 5,000 cases matter weeks August 2020, obviously one vaccinated. 0 hospitalizations 0 deaths. absurd move Connecticut.

We're getting 200 cases week consistently year. Apart mask wearing classroom, basically restrictions whatsoever. routine testing, vaccination required, social distancing anywhere, football games packed full. likely exposed COVID last week *wasn't even required get tested* I'm fully vaccinated. VA really great rolling vaccines Vets. never make sense hasn‚Äôt robust messaging importance diet exercise throughout whole pandemic. know two holidays coming school opening, I'm cautiously optimistic Israel make wave successfully mostly due boosters!!! Plus 90% 60yr+ / 88% 50-60yr vaccinated. I‚Äôm sorry wondering cause relative mines sorry asking I‚Äôll remove now. point, hope people vaccinate themselves. 

Vaccinated people spreading vaccinated people significant concern. Vaccinated people filling hospitals. L.A. zoo open enclosure, set ground level high smooth walls can't climb out. People throw stuff (not supposed to, happens time). ready lock fast. Delta joke.  friends vaccinated. masking hang indoors others homes watch football? addition flu deaths though, people would died flu die COVID instead? Everybody knows cases confimed, 210 million entire population country. Even 80% brazilians infected would 5.6 times cases. testing poor, people act like testing all.  feel like want full, non-questionable, covers-everything, hypocritical ‚Äúreligious‚Äù loophole, it‚Äôs time waive right health insurance hospital bed. Israel's Ministry Health

The gap severe patients age 60, per 100,000 inhabitants:

 Unvaccinated - 163.3

Vaccinated without third dose - 39

Vaccinated third dose - 4.9 put campus residents test positive. Students get friends deliver food, class notes, etc, kind undermines point.

So...you're right, building. first class serve still too. $$$$ There's definitely bunch stuff love thy neighbor, turn cheek, help poor people ignore parts agree with. Covid last month (unvaxxed, 33M) I'm pretty sure myocarditis. chest pains thumping heart beats. mean Pfizer shot give myocarditis either? citations I'm afraid, intuitively convincing look various forms pharmacology. Naloxone hydrochloride example, binds opioid receptors activate them. known antagonist, case Naloxone used treat opioid overdose (such heroin). That's one example think top head, multiple others..

I'm saying OP true without seeing citations know, unconvincing :)

Source: paramedic  Really? That's security buy gallon water whatever through. want over, easy.

I think people saying over. disease become endemic. eradicated. they're right (and think are), must decide threshold OK end measures.

Maybe that's now, mainly since children approved vaccinations yet hospitals getting hit hard. one complains these, they've around 20 years.

Actually, lot people think airport security measures ineffective ridiculous. TSA bad track record catching dangerous material they've tested. Probably vaccinating 50% pathetically small.  good bot evidence suggesting covid directly affects myocytes, though. yes, viral illness result inflammation cardiac pulmonary systems, think incidence covid ultimately greater typical viruses. 

I guess given background athletic training sports physical therapy gives pause I‚Äôve athlete die due undiagnosed HCM another lose chance play bc diagnosis. division football players privy medical care don‚Äôt receive. feel there‚Äôs going swing sad events, that‚Äôs all. Yeah mean it‚Äôs really symptoms clear per CDC that‚Äôs pretty general guidance always individualized health plans care there. made pretty broad assumptions there.

a) never said seen one

b) talk using tools (masks, outdoor air, etc.) allow safer socializing.

Edit: Spelling religious exemption speed limits cops still pull over. Ok, here's actual deal religious ""exemptions"", bit misnomer they're actually exemptions much path accommodation...

Religious exemptions must meet 2 criteria:

1) belief religion must sincere deeply held, 

2) religion must specifically call abstaining vaccines one core beliefs.

The religious exemption process actually works like this:

First, order claim religious exemption, must disclose religion member. very, small number religions actually hold abstaining vaccines core tenet, make far less 1% population. example, claim religious exemption say Catholic, going denied Pope said Catholics vaccinated; claiming disagree would essentially saying believe Pope messenger representative God Earth, core belief Catholicism, grounds dismissal claim.

Second, must demonstrate beliefs sincere deeply held. include employer finding whether actually member religion long member religion. joined religion vaccinate within months, grounds dismissal claim. employer also request prior vaccine records. ever vaccinated previously, grounds dismissal claim.

Third, must demonstrate core functions job performed reasonable accommodation without vaccinated.  example, salesperson car dealership, able job without regularly interacting people in-person. Therefore, even meet first two criteria, employer may STILL deny religious exemption request basis cannot perform core functions job reasonable accommodation.

In words, hurdle matter saying ""nah cuz religion"". serious qualifiers actually pass muster, even do, business usual. Tucker Carlson style question? problem myocarditis COVID vaccination.

Rip peace. Looking perspective current situation friend children exposed COVID-19.

Two friends, unvaccinated constantly downplaying severity COVID-19, officially exposed. friends' partner informed parents (along many aunt's uncles) positive one showing mild symptoms experiencing nasty case virus (after large family gathering). preschool aged children spent good deal time parents prior tested, large gathering.

My concern 5 year old attends school one children, play together everyday. realizing plan continuing send child school without tested even though exposed currently dealing mild cough. friend believes everyone get eventually need make big deal it. However, school requires fill Covid exposure/symptom questionaire day drop off. 

Should simply suggest daughter keep extra distance child, informing school exposure? informed friends various local places administering rapid tests free feel there's much else look child, try limit exposure.ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Any advice regards situation appreciated. Stay happy healthy folks!‚úåÔ∏è lol sounds right Yep. Medically speaking, it‚Äôs mild you‚Äôre oxygen.

I flu twice two years back 2017 2018. (This despite flu shot, get yearly.) knocked ass times two weeks still 100% bit after. go urgent care one point much pain (the body aches world) coughing bad choking phlegm thought gonna pass couldn‚Äôt breathe. High fevers, chills, could barely walk, super dizzy, physically weak. awful.

That considered mild.  supervisor two family members dies it, one currently it, still refuses get shot let kids get it. military he's trying find way get exempt smh good idiots though, think cant touch real. Every post inform /scare one idiot getting vaccine. second vaccination, hit vein injected blood stream. veins popped arm like weightlifter‚Äôs heart pumped hard. went away four hours. tachycardia since (diagnosed monitor). echocardiogram done didn‚Äôt see abnormalities. fair, weakened heart spider bite happened five years ago. 

Statistically speaking, accidentally injecting shot directly vein people. Yeah. kind employee would want making salad certainly providing medical care.

I never understand people prefer getting sick risking negative outcomes easy ways minimise risk called vaccines. flu also kills thousands year, including healthy people children - one outcome covid people take flu seriously get vaccines, think would great. Lol thanks bub. know.

Sadly long term symptoms probably way common anyone realizes looked specifically now. students tested positive vaccinated?

From article, ""Arcelus said students tested positive week vaccinated...""

So, ""most"", whatever means.  end game here? Zero cases?

Good question. think zero realistic goal, Delta behaves, make question ""At point cases disrupt semester?"" Every year college students get colds/flu disruptive students, entire student body/staff.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Alternate headline: Hospital looking competent staff believe medicine. first all, first article shared clearly states strategy delay second dose, give one dose. clearly see original comment completely misleading stating JCVI recommending 1 dose backtracked. BMJ article also December 2020 urging caution. since acknowledged, hindsight, JCVI's expertise bold strategy regard right choice improved immunity means might need boosters often. See recent BMJ BMJ article young people getting vaccinated said guidance welcome already opened vaccinations risk young teens living risk households while, recommended JCVI.

What wrong statement AstraZeneca? BMJ stated right honest. review data analyse ongoing thing, sometimes new data changes things? advice J&amp;J US. 

I really think got bit confused stuck outdated information. Let's take U.K. death rate 120/day (lower is). 

That's ~44,000/year.

That's equivalent 215,000 deaths/year U.S., ~3-4x flu (in addition flu deaths, start occurring again).

That's quite lot death simply accept. think need lot restrictions, hard see vaccine passports make total sense. entitled opinion. 

The poster said ""hard no"" zero evidence.

Saying ""probably"" definition confident.

Also, get nauseous, notice suggested poster go visit discussions topic scientific covid19 subreddit. That's I'm basing ""probably"" on, also suggested paper binding pericytes linked above. implication go come conclusion.

If want agree correct answer know sure, agree you. That's fair, areas flattens looked like jumps me. compare canada instance see mean 
It's much consistent expected downward trend result new technologies, techniques, understandings disseminated throughout medical community  


but yeah definitely made mistake reasoning bad Well, text doesn‚Äôt say anything getting vaccines. TLDR: not. Could possibly give positive testing *past* infection. active/current cases.

Not sure still think flu family viruses Covid... yes common cold comprised coronaviruses something like 200 viral strains make ""common cold"" with¬†rhinoviruses,¬†coronaviruses,¬†adenoviruses¬†and¬†enteroviruses¬†being common. theory similar many covid 0 nations. 
In long run no- wouldnt going covid 0. even they're vaccinating they're studying data, works, doesnt. luxury sense, really need rest world maintain long time, take approach cautious.

There's still plenty world fire like China live 100% open outside outbreaks. one facility. nation‚Äôs nurses. also facilities almost every single nurse vaccinated, none planning quitting. would holy text wrong many errors would need reevaluate something true worth following? cities major indoor games lately? seen tv outdoor ones i'd curious indoor one look pretty standard medical field, actually. Look hours residents work - insane. recently set limits work either 80 100 hours week. literally beds hospital sleep site.

Also, can't believe healthy either. really kow-towing nonsense. math may may wrong, logic still trash. that's problem here. Thanks describing experience -- I'm really sorry go this, especially taking precautions protect close you. really hope things continue improve. one quick question, I'm still fatigued now, hypersalivation dehydration weird anxiety.

Can ask ""now"" relative first infected? comment notes happened Sunday I'm sure recent Sunday weeks/months ago. Experiencing describe length time sounds exhausting, case.

And finally, worth, think there's anything ""weird"" anxiety mention. likelihood experiencing effects literal trauma; physical effects infection bad enough, add psycho-emotional impact infected avoiding long concern might mean family. would severe blow anyone, extremely grateful working (in part) continuing share learned others. two numbers choosing relationship helpful case. again, logic trash way defending makes seem like logic COVID spreading rest lives. That's part definition endemic virus.  pretty sure got major typos there.

also logic trash 1. ""load"" equal majority equal ""herd immunity""
2. effective vaccination works creating ""herd immunity"" see chickenpox, measles, polio, etc There's nothing like pretending 2,000-year-old mythology book kind bearing modern world.  Yes, many (most?) people won‚Äôt receiving depth follow care including echocardiograms pulmonary function testing unless sort symptoms prompt referral specialist. people asymptomatic. worry going lot ‚Äúfit‚Äù people/kids undiagnosed cardiomyopathy such. surely hope don‚Äôt see big increase adverse events due cardiac changes. Fuck yes. Let's implement selfish morons. probably downvoted since chinese hockey team appear playing sweden anywhere week. 

this international break sport even was, china automatically qualified olympics reason play qualification tournament

the IIHF played since june even did, china qualify either, riga.

maybe juniors? nah, since last january

so i'm curious, team china playing? result? vaccinated based risk, riskiest (oldest) going first.
We've limited amounts vaccine year too.

So that's delayed things.
Then JCVI decision. benefits individual slight. Requiring hospitalisation relative, since absolute factor like death. ""need"" hospitalisation individual opinion doctor addressing important part though. true getting flu preferable getting vaccine. true preventing spread community vaccines save lives vulnerable. upside getting vaccine upside getting it.

[Religion:  Vaccine bioworker here. answer no. spike protein normally ""closed"" shape opens comes contact ACE2 receptor outside cells. Spike proteins produced vaccines point mutation keeps stabilized closed shape. two things. 

1. immune system going come contact open shape happens binding cells infecting, otherwise need train immune system respond closes shape, virus look floating around coming contact immune cells.

2. closed shape allow bind cells. inflammation response occur.




The severity infection tissues dependent ones express highest levels ACE2 (which responsible lowering blood pressure normal setting) accessory proteins virus also hijacks (e.g. TMPRSS2, ADAM17). tissues body responsible blood pressure regulation, mainly nasal mucosa, lungs, instestines, liver, kidneys, heart. 

In disease, lack blood pressure regulation causes overall increase BP, causes leaky vessels (leading pneumonia, leaky vessels cause clotting factors release (resulting clots) release bradykinins cytokines (which lead inflammation). predicted organs specific receptors ones likely fail. 

The damage done tissues disease permanent, reversible depending severity. heart relies good blood pressure regulation tissue flexibility. less forgiving tissues are, harder heart work, obviously pretty bad.

Cool cool cool.‚Äô   Wake man Yes, 14 day also useful estimating trend number vaccinated people outweights number un vaccinated people sadly will. country either vaccinated negative enter place... now.

* breakthrough infections running 40% say... spread going happen matter what, even everyone vaccinated
* lot places there's already high antibody prevelance... UK say 94%, US 80%... mopping last 5,10, 20 percent natural spread end world? Especially among youth, likely overload hospitals (US exception, likely due incredibly poor health people already there) 
* vaccinated protected serious illness... since vaccinated spread virus, there's really thing ""safe"" environment, even passports.  
* immunocompromised, letting virus run wild burn unvaxxed actually fastest way get herd immunity maximize protection immunocompromised?

At point, think passports basically bump vaccination rates maybe 5% 18-30-year-old crowd get vaxxed go concerts stuff. 

And extent, I'm really sure much extra potection one gets living society 80% vaccination rate versus one 85% vaccination rate. JCVI said England, February 2020 March 2021 inclusive, fewer 30 persons aged less 18 years died COVID-19, corresponding mortality rate 2 deaths per million. second wave pandemic UK, hospitalisation rate children young people 100 400 per million. hospitalised severe underlying health children young people without underlying health conditions put high risk severe outcomes COVID-19, direct individual health benefits COVID-19 vaccination limited. 

This data clearly precedes Delta variant, prominent UK March Again, seem realise pandemic dynamic situation therefore advice recommendations change according background level virus risk population. rigid response get nowhere.

 found current sweet spot interval dose current circumstances, might change new variant comes virus dies down. Data reviewed constantly. decision based lack supply expertise vaccine dosing intervals worked. brilliant decision, risky saved lots lives. I've probably got longer lasting immunity it.

 also keep stating preventing vaccinations young people. government said introducing them, that's clearly case. JCVI make recommendations based individual health risk person, spelt statement, saying government may wish look wider considerations. certainly blocking vaccinations teens.

They also said data may change decision. evidence based apolitical stance.

Sweden similar Nordic countries. Next similar Baltic countries. maybe Ireland Scotland GB general. countries already different. 
 Nordic countries ton differences well, results good Nordic countries mean catastrophical anything. 
 
What? mean Sweden counts differently???  Hospitals Locals Remain Skeptical Vaccines

Cemeteries still plenty room! issue predictability? Immune response covid infection vary drastically person person whereas see data well vaccines work?

I've covid plus fully vaccinated. also know someone covid twice would definitely rather go again.

I mean sound callous, in-person school, kids probably going ignored right now. Yep. called updating priors.  We're issue family one household overly cautious (with 2 higher risk individuals, one myself), living like 2019. causing lot tension even fights (just one today) two. mean, we're adults acting like children again. Name calling, insults, getting ridiculous. 

Every day, feel different. Every day wake days, mind going hang vaccinated friend, go mall, etc. days, hear friend close contact tested positive i'm like, holy shit, i'm never hanging anyone ever again. Every day feels different.

Some days want go Disney World, others want stay locked never leave. hard manage, hard weed what's ""right"" what's ""wrong"". know going away need deal hard knowing what's appropriate action where. Everyone makes black white makes really hard.  Even myocarditis vaccine incredibly rare. husband got bad case myocarditis 2nd pfizer shot. told like 1 2 million chance, extremely rare. Even rarer severe side (most mild). Still better entire virus run rampant body infecting knows cells, especially delta variant higher viral load. wonder correlation ""real"" covid (not spike protein) effecting younger men well, vaccine. ""A lot people listen ‚Äúpeople like them‚Äù""

* grade level gets called front office school inform us another exposure. Originally contact-trace figure within student 15+ minutes space six feet less, spread great regardless decided count whole grade close contact.

* afternoon/evening, parents get close contact exposure letter written legalese cannot understand.

* following day, anywhere quarter half class COVID scare. continue several days get test. test positive, go back Step One.

* student COVID two weeks more.

* time need get students caught up, fall behind. would love nothing able meet students small groups get caught up--but cannot. new state law demands meet small groups students pass STAAR (state end-of-year test) least one hour week every subject pass test last year. groups legally required less three kids. ton kids pass test last year, either already behind (most infuriatingly) told last year STAAR would count students virtual last year take STAAR. also legally barred using recess, lunch, specials time small group sessions. Unsurprisingly, large number students meets poorly-designed legal framework creates massive hullabaloo.

Several districts acquiesced them, see spike cases afterward--and perpetuation cycle. state AG suing several districts mask mandates attempt overturn them...

The whole thing completely unsustainable mess, guarantee despite ""effort"" test scores still going ridiculously low end year. end, teachers schools largely blamed, state government turn around say ""See, told public schools work, time privatize everything.""

The vaccines produce fused form. Basically spike protein thought 2 subunits, S1 S2.

S2 binding domain is, protected S1. get infected virus, uses different membrane protein remove S1 part. soon happens entire structure changes exposes S2 receptor latches on. rest process fusion occurs (I could explain want get away point)

The thing is, makes spike protein bad part usually attached virus. genetic information virus downregulate ACE2 multiple
processes. lower ACE2, higher blood pressure.

Most vaccines using prefused spike never open ability cleaved dependent interactions virus self. one protein. Even open, spike bind receptor really much. 

Spike fit ACE2 well, outcompeted things fit better (namely Angiotensin)

The binding Spike ACE2 outside context virus, may technically cause downregulation (the cell wants bring cus thinks getting right signal, suck cell receptor still attached) technically could effect blood pressure, amount Spike needed vaccine work minimal comparison would get covid infection, likely much even bind

I wonder society going treat pandemic orphans? don‚Äôt see getting support beyond social security payments even people complain supporting them.  study May 2021, study close accurate, we're way better massive surge early July till now. Reproduction rates 1.0 like 40 something states now. Declining cases, theory follow suite pretty rapidly. Again, accurate.

Cautiously optimistic we're closer closer approach 2 yr relationship COV-2.  bin laden affect eradication polio? feel like almost inevitable everyone. much better place unvaccinated.  percentage people unvaccinated stage pandemic would minds changed less people wearing masks? pure second third paragraphs, incredibly location- situation-dependent

But post *isn't* specific location. Nationwide transmission rates still extremely high, even declining. nationwide reduction even 1% would still 100s lives thousands hospitalisations, especially given reduction compounds time. optimistic. haven‚Äôt gotten jab unless something compels you‚Äôre it.

its bit silly say effort convincing someone reality covid somehow takes away helping take seriously, things arent mutually exclusive worked day getting vaccines, well day fine. anecdote course  doubt that's really controversial. make sense compare two Unfortunately, American, surprised slightest. Considering amount fuckheads don‚Äôt give shit anyone themselves, what‚Äôs surprising weren‚Äôt point earlier. scary personally right now. girl 4 kids tested positive Covid today. vaccinated Johnson Johnson 6 months ago, pretty mild symptoms, anxiety unknown still there. Thanks Governor Farquaad. U da real MvP question regarding spread covid vaccinated people vs unvaccinated people seen answered. Maybe someone shed light

So know vaccinated people less likely catch transmit covid. also know vaccinated guarantee can't catch transmit it. given that's case, given mandates, vaccinated people forming much larger groups unvaccinated people (because unvaccinated people can't go concerts restaurants not), actually ascertain spreading virus most? Say vaccine makes 5 times less likely catch transmit covid. vaccinated people able form groups 5 times larger due mandates (just saying 5 times larger example), could potentially negate benefit vaccine? data right now? think vaccines great, strike pretty disingenuous see people saying ""the pandemic still thing unvaccinated people selfish"" people go restaurants, bars, sporting events, etc, around tons people process, knowing still spreading virus despite vaccinated. Oh gee maybe many anti vaxxers Agreed. It‚Äôs hard feel bad people deliberately set catch shit none poor kids deserve lose parents. Makes ill think it.  virus causes infection replicates human cells. spike mRNA vaccine replicate. produces spikes disintegrates. Neither spike replicate without virus. Thanks, idea. Kids acting like exist parents let think nothings gonna happen young. Lmao crazy base crazier Yeah, one particular massive following (I think train wreck purposes), super young girl. Lost baby due car accident blames medical professionals ‚Äúadvocates‚Äù free birthing kinds wacky stuff. mom nurse smh. going anti-vaxxers going tube throat feel bad them. Let events go on. Yeah tend avoid dutch days. Pretty hard half team dutch. understand sentiment message said original post something totally different wrong Doesn‚Äòt virus typically get less dangerous time due killing host beneficial spreading? european scientists referring to? Doctors actually vaccinated fairly high rates: e.g (75% April)

What totally understand vaccine resistance nurses! Would ""do-what-doctors-do"" obvious position take? I‚Äôm running fucks give. It‚Äôs absolutely brutal kids tho. don‚Äôt know. don‚Äôt understand. It‚Äôs kids without parents. Heartbreaking. think already pretty good vax testing employees. think need it. calling liar?

How indoor amenities bathrooms? Depending stadium, concessions might relatively enclosed, concern well. anyway, South, people go outside oppressive ending.

Let‚Äôs Roll‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Derry, dark winters brutal. Gets dark around 3:30pm Derry worst it. 

But end year magic. Sunsets 8 11pm, sunrise 3am. used watch sunsets carry-out, hit pubs clubs night head Donegal sunrise 3am keep party going. Covid tests animals different Covid tests people, learned. know states releasing data breakthrough cases one state releasing PDF kept getting linked, anyone know state was? open lost it. twins start preschool Monday I‚Äôm scared exact situation happening. whatever works. America ban unvaccinated Americans? Please! lost really good friend flu. shocked healthy ran several miles day. two kids age five. get flu shot every single year now. 

And many people, Covid much worse. Every time someone says ""it's flu,"" makes angry.  worst flu caught 2017, permanently fucked vision. thought going blind vision huge black blotches second day. improved never gone back normal. made note. based available data. provide Mississippi student testing data, I‚Äôd happy update. design HVAC laboratories living. I'm probably going get voted lot n95s equivalent protects viruses. plentiful supply, relatively inexpensive, available hardware stores.

I'd rather mind business hate getting yelled strangers internet anyone unvaccinated (under 12 yrs) child reading this, send school thinking cloth mask keep safe. I'm posting try help child.

Anyone wants argue cloth masks please tell bother go effort expense designing manufacturing n95s material thing. (I'd rather ignore me.)

Would jump airplane homemade bedsheet parachute one designed purpose?

The problem make n95s children's sizes. heard many KN95s smaller, legitimate one, might fit child. I'm sorry predicament wish leaders would help. Instead many either ignore problem, say exist, and/or make worse. that, there's literally living thing Ireland wants kill (loyalists crackheads notwithstanding). ahhh.. makes far sense (i'm caanda) DeSantis may get elected President.  Scary ass thought. Ok. think found know sounds radical maybe leave healthcare doctors, public health degree holders. 

These nurses ground zero, treating 1000s corona patients last year. Maybe know people want impose mandate corona vaccines? Public transportation terrible live outside Dublin. It‚Äôs save people care about. watched live, Anderson Cooper's segment Thursday night, top show. mother works elderly care refuses get vaccinated. infuriating.

I'm waiting job make vaccine mandatory. She'll likely quit point least she'll lesser risk others then.  already mandated get mmr, Tdap, hep b vaccinations. Every year get flu shot. link that? trouble finding specific comment. 

Thanks

**edit**

I think found  Death reason vaccinate. right, fortunately mortality rate among children low. common problem Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome (PIMS), occurs every around 1000 5000 covid cases children. PIMS kill you, patients often need intensive care around 7% cases lead secondary damage. likely severe adverse reactions lot rare 1:5000, vaccine might positive cost-benefit-calculation children. Italy scared too. March Madness stated fire up, tournaments canceled left right.  I‚Äôll remember one coach damn near passed sidelines (sweating delirious, team playing.  Surreal. (Luckily turns flu, still scary hell watch). image seared idea virus really capable point. Like watching apocalypse unfold- thank goodness we‚Äôve mostly come it. it‚Äôs enough give anyone anxiety pause. nurse gave goosebumps one's easy. started using ivermectin massively hospitals overwhelmed. naturally followed deaths cases dropped soon after, regardless ivermectin. true America!

This study even trying figure Ivermectin anything productive. Thank much sharing! I've shared video Instagram Facebook accounts! yikes. Abstract actual data paper downloaded. Sounds like noise me.  Hey guys, 27 year old healthy guy recently got positive COVID test result.

I think I've since Monday Tuesday I'm surprised still symptoms today. Still low grade fever 100, somewhat frequent coughing, generally stuffy dry throat.

Taking lots Vitamin C, drinking lots water, Tylenol every often, still eating foods getting rest.

Any recommendations things speed recovery maybe expect far progression virus may since already almost week? can't move we've broken link infection hospitalization. Guess requires? Vaccination. I‚Äôve got family posting pictures local nurses protesting vaccines, caption, ‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt anyone listen medical professionals.‚Äù 
Sure, let‚Äôs ignore hundreds thousands doctors, nurses, scientists, listen 20 antivaxx nurses town. Yeah point, never thought Ireland‚Äôs population size recently saw it‚Äôs gone 5M+ today, high marks vaccinations. Pretty cool. Or, mask mandates.
Schools masks fine. idea I'm guessing super low. Probably like 1% 2% uncomfortable truth authoritarian governments often handle crises better logical leadership. US think voluntarism solution everything, people living completely different reality. know we're going mitigate climate change without certain degree compulsory coercive action government, can't rely everyone right thing issue debate. COVID put idea bed entirely. opposition willing let kids die like medieval pheasants political leverage cant afford pity. percentage deaths vaccinate people? Havent yet read paper starts bit fishy already; SSRN social sciences preprint server (no peer review), authors credible scientists. Hibberd- dentist youtube channel, def. affiliated Uni Toronto. Chaime- info found Scheim- lists affiliation ‚ÄúUS Public Health Service‚Äù ORCID listed ‚Äúinactive reserve‚Äù corps. stop posting this. 
you're wrong. Fellow New Yorker (Brooklyn). neighborhood turned ghost town. remember night lockdown went effect went local liquor store bought pricey bottle wine fit existential despair.

The silence streets deafening.

I swore second vaccine became available would get it. Vaccinated January. shame people seeing light, they‚Äôll double bad behavior. say ‚Äúthank god something got fear saw error ways.‚Äù ‚ÄúWow fucking idiots!‚Äù weird cultural glitch small percentage Americans freaked rest ignored it.  remember going Costco February 2020 seeing two people masks. Everyone else living normal peeves, shopping bath towels night lysol thermometers. One masked person stopped tell products thought add cart, nodded walked by. 
It weirdest month life. right one country doesnt right solution another. Denmark extremely high vaccination rates 12 years, may reason necesary vaccinate 0-12 year olds. country vaccination rate among adults lower refuse vaccine, vaccinating kids may option get higher overall coverage stop/slow spread. Yeah that's mean. They're repeating year-old study based 18-month-old data. Good riddance. shitty little postcard gave wore ages ago thanks everyone requiring carry me. restaurants guess. Hospitals New England fine, masks still required vaccinated kids. It‚Äôs idiotic point.

Covid hospitalizations rising throughout US Northeast (~2x-4x higher late June) think anyone wants see high could rise. probably make sense err side safety. words, perhaps hospitals fine measures still place..

And something else: advent Delta variant, vaccinated fairly likely spreaders (this case pre-delta)...  usually hear people *didn‚Äôt* reach. people convinced usually ashamed wrong first place change behavior quietly. soon could get vaccine, did. science facts would‚Äôve enough, seeing swept rest world, knew gonna bend US really mess us up. 

I go hospital non-covid issue and, thankfully, covid patients isolated. Even so, weren‚Äôt enough nurses tend non-covid patients should‚Äôve 2-hour visit turned full-night stay. hadn‚Äôt already trying get appointment, would‚Äôve lit fire me.

I feel nurses doctors deal horrible disease. psychological trauma loosing patient already bad, deal many patients dying per day. know one nurse wants quit feels can‚Äôt hospital already short-staffed crowded. shouldn‚Äôt mess. 

I know many probably vaccine, don‚Äôt, **please. Get it.** doesn‚Äôt change fact Mississippi high poverty rate. it‚Äôs hard move new state simply don‚Äôt money - especially goal state higher cost living. like one every 335 people New Jersey. That's it, thank you! I'm going legwork state Mississippi

I apologize, know simple Google searches difficult you.

Maybe would trend data daily COVID-19 cases Mississippi (provided Mayo Clinic). last 2 months, see case-positivity reached peak 0.1% mid-August, currently trending downward, residing 0.07% today. 

With data, *assume* (as did) ""evenly distributed population"" case-positivity rate 0.07% today, going assume  going assume

So get downvoted making assumptions using best available data, get upvoted making assumptions positivity rate still **10.2% minimum.**

Do know getting calculation, mind clarifying? taking 18,825 figure total student population? so, getting 4.25% provided comment. Kids 12 exempt mask mandates entire time. would weird suddenly lift mandate everyone else force group never included before. Roll dumb asses parking let nature decide evolution human race. ENDemic. 

Jokes apart, fact endemic means end pandemic, it? Dunno man. I'm first person I've heard problems teams. anecdotes suppose. take anyway want take secret world, son. understand word ""funny"" taken sadistic, psychotic, religious meaning, ""I can't stop laughing. 'Delta horribleness actually savior'"". Number cases relevant testing policies vary greatly countries. Much better look hospitalizations deaths per capita. TUD new name DIT. sold sites city centre moved campus Grangegorman( near Phibsbourgh) seen ivermectin advocates cheering large scale study conclusively demonstrate benefits, see retracted fraud left skeptical ivermectin research generally.  Mississippi also low cost living. difference pay might great difference standard living.  fair, lot people telling don‚Äôt like mandate quit jobs. Fortunately nurses vaccinated get vaccinated. Like said, think around February March it'll reasonable stop masking except exceptional situations.  Oh. unvaccinated blame vaccinated increasing likelihood infection. evidence proving vaccinated people cannot increase likelihood unvaccinated people. can't believe things unless there's cognitive dissonance. right? 

Is joke people experience cognitive dissonance? happening many people popular joke? It‚Äôs crazy CNN keeps pumping articles completely blind fact antivaxers going opposite whatever CNN says lol right‚Äîcloth masks don‚Äôt much protect wearer. 

Cloth masks prevent wearer spreading others. everyone masks, nobody spreads.

School mask mandates worked well last year keep COVID spreading classrooms. states won‚Äôt even let schools try year. Ooo! pick check ? husband needs every incentive. . . . wormless? wild headline. sure intern wrote understands closely connected two stats are. ‚ÄúArcelus said students tested positive week vaccinated cases direct result following masking protocols.‚Äù

It‚Äôs college kids doesn‚Äôt surprise me. Says they‚Äôre cautionary quarantine least another week. seems likely colleges taking precautions quarantines husband f 16 pilot got text another one day saying want get vaccine seeing husband interested joining defiance. husband vaxxed told able get exemption. making noise right would surprised separates vaccine. It‚Äôs sacrificing children economy part craven sociopathic political strategy.

Anything pretend Dear Leader wrong. ‚Äúat point protect students economy?‚Äù Question seems wrong question asking mask mandates. mask mandate would protect both. Ok? Shoot foot guess, enjoy possibly dying covid long lasting effects get it. unvaccinated point probably really uneducated lack sort critical thinking skills. really got ü•∞ That‚Äôs take it, yes. Immunosuppressed folks already get jab, older folks next list priority. healthcare system starts collapse well..........we may to. fully agree WANTING though.   garfield said, ""nobody immune propaganda."" didn‚Äôt. freaks stuck ways. die. blame news days, like past mainstream news reporters would go get shot source destruction. never really saw ground zero hospital video America, swear showed news looked like hospitals first peak would changed lot peoples minds virus America never really happened. Maybe law preventing days law stupid pandemic people need see front lines convinced. Journalism really become lazy talk shows arguing panels instead live feed journalism. wonder kids could would cause exponential rise. veryone vilifies DeSantis Florida rejecting mask mandates schools.

And rightly so. DeSantis ""position"" really insane.

Let schools decide. Masks powerful tool controls spread. sympathize masks-should-not-be-mandated by-the-state-position... prohibiting use tool outright idiotic: local decision makers able use tool circumstances require it.. alternative back-to-online-learning... 

Oh, minor detail: contrast Denmark, Florida massive covid wave full hospitals.. People incredibly busy lives really time think sort information bombarding various media. anyone wondering, remote part upstate NY live buy tests 2 eur per test bulk, would assume possible get even cheaper logistics everything worked out, even US could mean around 100 million usd per day 36 billion per year one test considered valid 48 hours. rough back envelope calculation least. leaked reports Wuhan outdoor overflow hospitals welding peoples doors shut leave building... terrifying. Agree. Screw idiots. Good riddance. super interesting. Let come back later ask may. Gotta something first. care insofar they‚Äôre clogging ICUs. son born, nurse wear mask pin didn‚Äôt get flu vaccine. time little put bc always get flu vaccine annoyed didn‚Äôt would handling baby. Now, covid, I‚Äôd absolutely livid requesting different nurse. silliness - real world data Houston hospital - less 1 percent opted out. federal ""mandate"" allows option weekly hospital system announced April 1 staffers would need vaccinated keep jobs. 24,947 workers get vaccinated earlier deadlines, Houston Methodist suspended 178 workers failed June 7, giving additional two weeks prove immunized. banked it‚Äôs case use lose it, sure! 

I wish could retire. Congrats!  Fantastic job. 
Lead example quite simple. organic ease sitting around table together working individual lunch project things. paint miniatures assemble Gundam eat chat. quite everyone drive share meal. stop masking? playbook personally?

I‚Äôm thinking around stop masking socially fold risk overall. 

Assuming kids get vaccinated around Nov, suspect won‚Äôt bad. way it‚Äôll anywhere near last year. It‚Äôs impossible, unless vaccines don‚Äôt work.  Lowville Lewis County NY, 29.7% Lewis County votes Democratic. 

This really leopards eating faces situation.  load anti-vaxxers going hospital available deliver babies.   virus wrecks kidneys organs. surprised see unvaccinated kids ending needing kidney transplants they're 20's-30's. wish would don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre going see employers mandates frontline workers soon. Look employers mandated vaccines, exception United, Disney Tyson, it‚Äôs nearly entirely office workers. Like yeah, Walmart it, office workers, 1.6 million store workers. 

This Vox article good job explaining reasons behind it: really wish employers would outright mandate lot aren‚Äôt going to, least while. track trends propaganda rhetoric &amp; disinformation.

It‚Äôs human nature throw hands frustration people become embedded lies, feel like it‚Äôs worth trying continue engage convo. it‚Äôs really, really, really important keep trying. 

Why? Repetition super important forms human persuasion, - course - bogged disinformation usually hearing &amp; media/social news sources. Often point hardly come contact ‚Äúgood‚Äù information - folks profit fear distrust invest lot money drag &amp; keep people rabbit holes.

The #1 goal bad actor propagandists almost always sow distrust and/or apathy. Targets usually told &amp; believe journalists, CDC, ‚Äùothers,‚Äù etc., become somewhat impervious mainline sources. 

But enough friends, family, church members, trusted/respected folks community respectfully engage‚Ä¶it‚Äôs def possible crack escape hatch someone‚Äôs cognitive dissonance. learn different ways, video sounds &amp; sad stats - especially shared friendly relation - might resonate someone stubbornly refused acknowledge 20 presentations similar evidence. fact pandemic won‚Äôt go away everyone either antibodies infected virus both. 

Vaccines prevent transmission 100%, completely possible mild asymptomatic virus infection vaccine, infections aren‚Äôt packing hospitals. fact, covid mild first place none would happening. 

The problem unvaccinated serious cases, many lack herd immunity absolutely packs hospitals. Houston wait time ER 24 hours. really bad people without covid. 

Look every single hospital 90% covid patients unvaccinated. scary hearing might catch SARS-COV-2, higher likelihood dying antibiotic resistant bacterial infection. 1,587 vaccinated individuals died virus ( August 28, 2021). Compared 35,000 people died antibiotic resistant infections 2019. 

Right hospitals, 17% breakthrough infections found asymptomatic hospitalized reasons viral infection presumably caught virus hospital. Healthline article links papers explain above. least they're hypocrites. dad born 1941, doctor available nurse decided try hold dad coming out...that go well. dad weird spinal issues life, always wondered something got screwed restricted.  Thanks clarification! see saying, think might wondering Delta still raging US even high seroprevalence? 

The problem Delta, due infectiousness, requires high antibody titers prevent infection, unless recently vaccinated ill (like past 10 weeks?), mostly immune reinfection. Yes, *some* immunity, even 3.2% *people test positive* covid still end hospital.

A similar poor outcome could happen future strain escape antibodies well.  think   far 30% nurses refusing mandate.  short term, sure. long term, knows. Endemic virus circulates low levels occasional flare-ups, everyone exposed (except kids) low public health burden. Like flu, measles, smallpox, polio.

In immediate aftermath pandemic Delta certainly become endemic, entirely unclear whether remain so. stop people saying endemic forever (and getting 21 upvotes case nonsensically, they're spouting popular narrative), others saying spend year lives eliminating prevent (right equally crazy narrative outs gets downvotes). Many ""public health degree holders"" medical doctors. professionals insane takes like masking 2 year olds help learn

and wonder population getting skeptical expert opinion. experts like needs conspiracy theories.  looks like Connecticut college gone remote due covid outbreak. Keep mind, students required vaccinated wear masks ~98% vaccinated. ~1700 students, 68 tested positive (mostly due following protocols) they‚Äôve gone remote. really hope sign things come colleges‚Ä¶ Grim :/ reason gets repeated would CDC www üòÑ‚Ä¶ endangered species worrisome implications outbreaks occur zoos wildlife reserves. Doctors already recommending mandate. think AMA is? nurses refusing vaccine don‚Äôt know much think do. know them. RN‚Äôs know less science wiener dog. Believe me, I‚Äôve flabbergasted once. they‚Äôve embarrassed someone else corrected them. think we'll need maintain cautious measures children chance vaccinated. expect see bad shit holidays like last year, though mostly unvaccinated sick dying. think somewhere around February March 2022 we'll kids vaccinated holiday season resulting surge past areas higher vaccination rates probably go business wear masks inside think might lot anti-vaxxers around we're worried immune compromised folks. 

So, point, think I'd wear mask hospital visiting old folks home. travel see grandma, I'll wear mask case exposed en route, wear one visit mom lives nearby. And, course, I'll still abide local masking rules business requests. remember lot travelers immigrants area many countries great access vaccines we'll need mask around newbies visitors they're protected.

That's living somewhere high vaccination rates. somewhere low rates, I'd keep masking around pro-murdering-your-neighbors crowd long rates low. Really? rewatch X-Files. say, low number cases assume wasn't. 

We informed person school recently tested positive. contact tracing everyone goes quarantine till negative test obtained. school district area this. yes let free market happen. favor it. 30% nurses quit, claiming happening many places, see useful mandates are.

And family member emergency nurses treat them, print stuff typed show hospital. Notice said *some* immunity, complete immunity. 

Even right 100% population either vaccine previous infection, necessarily mean outbreaks waning immunity. Pfizer already seeing loss protection severe outcomes, reported CDC seen Israel. previous immunity vaccine still pretty decent ability prevent infection hospitalization, could change new variant escapes antibodies much Delta. Zoos accredited Association Zoos Aquariums. It‚Äôs pretty big process get accredited high standards. lot transparency community. states still COVID-zero. Unfortunately 2 largest states trouble. Imagine enforcing social distancing? koolaid man üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ born ready! constitutional rewriting necessary. Religious exemptions aren‚Äôt allowed every state. California one eliminated religious exemptions childhood school vaccinations. requires politicians eliminate religious exemptions exist. two year old got covid- don‚Äôt go much go two places week showing symptoms, got symptoms her. It‚Äôs unclear got gave vice versa, vaccinated recovering slow. sick was. I‚Äôm cautious, wear mask wash hands etc. heartbreaking tested positive, time safe. Really glad minimal symptoms able recover home.   naked bodies tipper truck dumped huge pit‚Ä¶ surreal.

Is link? morbid curiousity try convince antivaxxer acquainatances... guys inspiration rest world, hope overwhelmingly successful, want pandemic end.  Mississippi doesn‚Äôt provide testing data. could Google blue face, probably wouldn‚Äôt find it. best estimate available data approximate range. 

You using wrong data, leads results artificially deflated. chart looking labeled ‚ÄúAverage daily cases per 100,00 people.‚Äù point refer rate positivity. used normalize data, say reduces data form universally fits everywhere allows compare two populations equal. State might cases State B, State also lot people. looking rate per 100,000 people, see two populations higher rate illness. uses population data alone, nothing testing. Testing positivity rate uses testing data, use population data. 

You don‚Äôt believe me, [here‚Äôs CDC third time, positivity relates number people testing positive divided number people tested, sum positive negative tests. Absolutely population data required. example: ten people state tested, nine test positive, positivity 90%. Likewise, 1 tested positive, positivity rate would 10%. doesn‚Äôt matter many people live state. matters many tested, many tests came back positive. 

If look [the Mayo Clinic link scroll heading ‚ÄúMore trends Mississippi‚Äù see trend line. literally labeled ‚ÄúAverage positive test rate‚Äù. shows average rate August approximately 20% positivity. don‚Äôt even need math, they‚Äôve done it‚Äôs done correctly. Again, don‚Äôt believe me, simply look evidence provided.

Man, american conservatives really fucking stubborn get vaccine think twice horse dewormer nonsense.

What hell going country? What's point regretting getting vaccinated death bed? Sort wasted regret point.    true all. First, lot immune response antibody level. Second, large (100-fold) variation people respond infection. Third, it‚Äôs unquestioned infection + vaccine gives much better immune protection infection alone, especially variants.

A review give up. anti-vax family members swayed. choice sadly death sentence. major medical issues put risk pre-pandemic, Delta variant... Ahh gotcha.

When started June seemed like going getting back normal soon. calls someone would need put forbearance got laid couldn‚Äôt find work would pay enough. Shitty, heart wrenching.

\- 73,8 % Danemark's population vaccinated went normal mode

\- 61,1 % Israel's population vaccinated big mess there, High level restriction third dose recommendation, even let vaccinated come country, means 10% vaccinated fix it? 

\- 59,9 % Sweden's population vaccinated everything going pretty well there, restriction like mask social distanciation. 

&amp;#x200B;

( conclusion: need smart scientists lot transparency! ) 

&amp;#x200B;

PS: numbers available online Let's see happens Denmark. They're 80%+ vaccinated &amp; gone back normal. we'll see NYC fluke not. Ireland soon state, maybe Nov. clue too.   So, stop delivering them? Pick counter only? Dang girl! poor woman‚Äôs gold! üèÖ and? total population matters. unvaccinated still get sick still overwhelm hospitals affect need hospitals emergencies. 

""Eligible"" vaccinated number make everyone feel better. Frankly think medical community actually downplaying idiot anti-vaxxers get sick die out. Sure compare moving averages. 

But tell me. Right now. going there. pandemic doesn‚Äôt give fuck ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù. ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù import life? us vs them.

They willing victims divide conquer media.  Wiggle toes get shot. 

Also side sleeper, get shots side don‚Äôt sleep on. not, compare moving averages. Epidemiologists look epidemiological weeks analyses. compare week week, days.

Edit: also see graphs, select ""7 day moving average""  fuck would people working infants can't get vaccinated zero antibodies virus refuse get vaccinated? pretty disgusting they'd willingly put newborns risk selfish stupidity. clutching pearls nursing home deaths NY...

But point is‚Ä¶maybe groups incentive get vaccinated higher due risk health safety life opposed personal risk  selfish nurses get vaccinated  Well I‚Äôm mean we‚Äôre gonna comparison might aswell include overall EU US better imo: ‚ÄúOf EU‚Äôs total population around 447 million people, 58% fully vaccinated, according University Oxford‚Äôs World Data project. compares 52% total U.S. population 63% U.K.‚Äù. 

Turns it‚Äôs alot closer include good bad areas. doubt testing. entire school district university requires vaccination going around looking cases. 

The obsession testing majority vaccinated population drag longer people refusing get vaccine will.  Hugs! that's positivity rates calculated, lol. case honest mistake point denominator number kids tested total number kids school. North Idaho already crisis standards.

Source: CDC covid vaccine    rates per 100,000 people, 100,000 mostly people diagnosed COVID. Basically CDC comparing number hospitalizations census count people live area describe rates (per 100,000 population) calculated using National Center Health Statistics' (NCHS) vintage 2019 bridged-race postcensal population estimates counties included surveillance catchment area.

Because based census people tested positive, hospitalization rate low. look people actually diagnosed COVID, mathematically higher.

The reason CDC way probably (1) helps judge strain orhospitals (2) lot positive test results reported, making hard look people test positive.

There reports [crowded leading transmission. without really solid contact tracing can't know sure fans got COVID outdoor event parties. covid vaccine mainly helps ramp body's natural defense system faster rather fighting virus itself. seems little effect early stages disease, cuts worst days 8-12 highest mortality. also seems little effect non-risk populations. 
Healthy young people profit way less vaccine, still get almost sick, since immune system ""fast enough"" anyway. time weaker people likely die days 8 12 chance avoid dangerous escalation, even occurence dangerous second peak, one week first peak sometimes occurs elderly people greatly reduced.

I've working doctor covid patients year dangerous peaks become much rarity compared autumn 2020. time I've young vaccinated colleagues high fewer whose symptoms compareable cought one year ago. However, seen young colleagues suffering weakness weeks disease, happend last year much levels off. 100k doses day. like 40k new doses.

These nurses refuse vaccination downright lose licenses. likely killing patients ways one.

 even hold license first place great contradiction. ""licensed"" nurse implies nurse trained perform standards licensing authority.

Not vaccinating goes standards endangers patients colleagues.

They lose license get sued malpractice case infected patients. Grodd? happened JFK's sister...

that tell anyone knowledge history need know  do. Brain drain contributor poverty cycle. higher vaccinated population, breakthrough cases see. region right now, half cases vaccinated (not hospitalizations, positive tests), however, 70% population vaccinated. minority (30% population) producing many cases majority (70% population). I'm NY, cases hospitalizations rise, we're near Oregon's crisis level. Oregon's low vaccination regions causing majority cases vast majority hospitalizations. People really hard time wrapping head around breakthrough infection stats.  Vaccines really going save us pandemic huh? Ah read adjectives people 50. Also many young people getting sick considered healthy individuals. Sure. know. I'm glad seems work well.

It seems much complicated this. Look original comment. question US population antibodies right (as naively calculated above), deep shit? Others may answered already, read comments want.

My main takeaway far is: Immunity wanes super quickly. Delta hits right variant needs higher immunity levels classic did.

I‚Äôm boat anxiety frustration vaccine can‚Äôt come soon enough! First off, googling things couldn‚Äôt bothered problem. They‚Äôre difficult, still didn‚Äôt them. 

Where find stats page? see nothing showing numbers low, even fatality rate. positivity trend shows approximate 20% positivity rate throughout month August. Assuming even distribution population means school-aged children also positivity rate 20%. 

You incorrectly divided number sick students whole student population. tells percentage student population got sick August. POSITIVITY RATE. positivity rate percentage tests returned positive results. student wasn‚Äôt tested, don‚Äôt count calculation. 

I determined 10.2% positivity rate taking number students positive tests (18,825) total number tests administered across state Mississippi month August (183,334). 183,334 largest number divide tests include number. That‚Äôs it. gets bigger. dividing number sick students largest number possible gives bare minimum positivity rate possible, 10.2%. if, if, every single test state administered student. Fewer tests given students reduces denominator, thus giving higher positivity rate. know number lower teachers staff also tested. It‚Äôs safe assume weren‚Äôt adults tested. result positivity rate students goes 10.2%. use standard metric survivability based physical condition prognosis patient, gets number score, best score gets bed.

Here‚Äôs Idaho‚Äôs crisis care checklist  Alright. Thanks again. helpful I'm starting understand. media country purely emotonial almost actual data shared. like switch either panic distract.

So following statement true?

Delta ""Classic"" may equally dangerous infected, antibody-threshold lower delta. means antibodies needed a: get infected b: fight infection. Right?

May ask source statement delta variant requiring higher antibody levels ""classic"" variant? would interesting read into.

Personally, I've always gotten flu shot (my parents always big getting vaccinated, COVID-19 exception), I've heard lot people would go without getting annual flu shot always thought bit weird. Especially since many people got vaccines like ones tetanus HPV. clearly trusted vaccines yet resisted flu vaccine reason. 

Then again, parents long told vaccines preventing getting sick actually intended reduce severity sickness get (from thing vaccine for). Thus affected ""it's 40% effective"" stuff surrounding flu vaccines. 

That said, sometimes felt inconvenient get flu shot. times remind neighbor's son died years ago due bad case flu recall much older now. good reminder what's stake. argued examples ""dead ends"" evolution. everything evolution considered ""dead end"" humans extinguish nearly species want ‚Äì possible evolution path save it. things chance strike back bacterias virus. antibodies passed breastmilk babies already born? interviews don‚Äôt end need be. need incorporate videos nurses beeping ICU run ads Joe rogan fox oan whatever piece shit channel/podcast need constantly stunned people believe ""freedoms"" I'm refusing vaccines effect others wtf. non vacers go live island embrace health freedoms together. imaginary freedoms put innocent people risk. freedom entitlement. course, time random antivax people dressed nurses.     favourite part logic completely ignores fact really know long-term effects COVID, either.

I said: No. already know there‚Äôs small risk heart inflammation vaccines. It‚Äôs highly treatable.

**WHERE MISTAKE.** Originally think plan. However, FDA asked manufacturers expand trial numbers try capture side effects determine risk them‚Ä¶ although I‚Äôve heard several experts (like Dr. Paul Offitt) say increased number requirement isn‚Äôt truly large enough make much difference. new requirements pushed timeline back. hope expanded trials safety data give parents/caregivers confidence push people get kids vaccinated. like adult population going many skeptics. There's rumor doctors Mississippi [prescribing cutoff individual net benefit (ie risk side effect lower risk disease) isn‚Äôt really established.

Vaccinating healthy children benefit society benefit individual controversial (and be!) many places probably never vaccinate 12, also likely never 12-15 either. 

So: lots countries huge supplies vaccine, lots vaccination sites without people vaccinate, 0-15 vaccinated outside risk groups. pretty normal. Sweden passed 1,000 deaths per million. Well, I‚Äôll take odds get minor case. also socialize vaccinated people. 

The vaccine end game. else there? waiting for?  happened Israel switching moderna?

Which points? mRNA spike protein bind way spike protein covid? Notably, re-read comments thread, saying ""probably"" case, saying yes. Regardless, discussed paper, example:

""The three advanced vaccines (from Oxford/AstraZeneca,

OP link actually covid infections. Please read it.  Last year, ""mild"" case everything short requiring supplemental oxygen. (I remember great YT video explaining spectrum can't find now.) Something read/heard last weeks reminded ""mild"" *breakthrough case* still evaluated scale.

I've done 16-20 hours shift younger work 30 day straights know possible. probably 16+ shift family obligation. positive nobody mentally demanding task 12 hours day,

Residents work extremely long hours 80 hours+ per week. I've heard specialty 100+ hrs plus per week. while, clinical knowledge become second nature mentally demanding task become muscle memory. literally put box locker, failed activity three year old do

It depends take care body get work. used work alot, value eat right sleep well. definitely possible work 12 hours shift health care. Unfortunately no, says catches quarter people deteriorate. words, positive test need act like catching COVID kill you, negative really tell anything useful. Maybe even with. actual vaccine chemicals body within 3 weeks taking it? trained immune system, like stays there. mistaken?  frustrating keep taking long. thought said end year kids could them. hate this. Give break? thousands people hospitals speak breakthrough cases? 

This pandemic! act without much passive consideration around you? virus still spreading like wildfire across United States. every new case comes being, get much closer number new variants. easy generalise, it?

I fully vaccinated (2 shots Pfizer soon could get them), wearing mask everywhere indoors people whose vaccination status can't sure, keeping precautions hoping booster shot. time horribly afraid dogs traumatic experience early childhood left lifelong phobia dog big enough able reach stomach - i.e. afraid Yorkshire terriers similar breeds anything bigger gives instant traumatic reaction. would opt instantly. way screening without way near dog (let's say put mask tray someone carries dog), care would gladly participate. there's chance approach dog myself, it. aren't, dropping standing original claim think impossible mRNA spike protein interact pericytes? 

Then please present citation this, seen would like to.

Anyway, I'm 100% pro-vaccines. I'm sure passport issue hill worth dying on. think huge social battle fight nominal upside terms overall protection society. 

The reason think well received public really riled people taken vaccine. proposed people unvaccinated led streets rotten cabbage tomatoes thrown them, bet see 75% approval idea... even though would little public safety (other shame people getting vaccinated). think pointing inherent risk tolerating intolerance permits environment intolerance evolve actionable prejudice eventually affect everyone. echoing exactly ‚Äútolerance dies‚Äù sentiment articulating Well I‚Äôm definitely one people get vaccine early blocks Woodhull tiny studio. one week April close losing it. sirens stop hours end. sick weeks, get test, lied family sick. tired, block sound, sat dark listened it.

Could reason children appear less affected Covid? That's potential good news vaccines could approved 5-12 early October; would make world difference, would allow enough kids get vaccinated winter worry school surge. one would love able ditch mask winter break, school support worker Massachusetts, would rest students staff.   Latest COVID surge stressing hospital staff, space across North clear point death concern. know long covid common enough one could expect much larger proportion people get covid long-lasting symptoms die, bears repeating unusual viral infections cause permanent damage cause issues line.

When we're talking novel disease infectious, high disease burden is, important remember we're things right, look like overreaction.

If things right, worst never happens.

Really need remember much comes people's health safety- new situation much learn- almost always preferable little.

the bad thing far vaccination per day might go waves people interested Poor kid. Long covid sucks.  concert unvaccinated people many multiple COVID cases concert vaccinated people.

And drastically increased risk hospitalization/dying. said anything Trump? Yeah, Trump touted vaccine told people get it. bad left office, time vaccine started become available general public, rest powerful members party + media decided vaccine bad. There's *no way* people use negative carte blanche, right guys? does.  Google covid hands covid feet.  Happens lot children. myocarditis caused vaccines (mainly mRNA vax) happens totally different process. cases extremely rare population. say non issue, adverse reaction known caused vaccine taken seriously. sheer numbers still extremely extremely low. groups risk males ages 18-35, especially high cardiovascular fitness like athletes. Essentially cases mild (given even mild case myocarditis sucks pretty impactful wellbeing) cleared basic therapies rest. Still takes clear up, like 2-4 weeks. there's evidence say would cause long term complications. 

Also risk exact kind myocarditis higher regular covid infection, top would also virus actually infecting heart tissues too. also reported handfuls people vaccines, autoimmune diseases, allergen responses, viruses well. Nearly vaccine injury caused immune system job, bit hard. 


It's good claim would risk reactions, better know likely issues. Even 10000 people reported it, well 160000000 vaccinated people experienced makes one person's risk potential less .01%.

Once everyone either vaccinated, *should* similar flu. flu would much worse one population immunity it. Mutations/waning immunity means vulnerable getting sick, people dying it.

Thank you.  Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Actually main concern smell. diminished smell covid, I'm afraid vax take away smell again. searched VAERS many reports Anosmia Myocarditis, seem real problem. I've also seen many anecdotes reddit/FB people losing getting distorted smells solely vax.

On VAERS, Moderna disproportionately high number Anosmia complaints, likely get Moderna. course. ACE2 lungs, need regulate blood pressure. concentrated Kidneys though charge blood pressure regulation, along heart. 

Your ACE2 concentrations different depending sex, age, ethnicity, health etc. 

Smokers, old people, diabetics, anyone hypertension higher levels ACE2 overall

Males higher concentrations females, increases age (and actually mediated testosterone)

People African descent (this includes black americans) tend higher concentrations ACE2 nasal mucosa may may affect outcome disease, may increase likely someone get infected (this single factor communities color hit worst, especially major cities)

Children blood pressure regulation issues normally, low levels ACE2.

How person gets infected also big impact infection leads. people first infected nasal lining, would start headaches sinus pressure, spread virus basically moves downward. immunomodulatory properties, early infection virus suppress pain immune response allow replicate without causing symptoms, least viral load high immune activation inevitable. groups lot ACE2 amount infected cells soon immune system kicks also lot higher. Thus likely worse symptoms. 
Obviously direct inhale lungs, much worse

Some people able clear virus successfully lower respiratory damage becomes bad, therefore likely experience pneumonia. Children lowest risk exact reason, levels immune cells upper airway much higher (cus kids fucking gross regularly catch respiratory infections) allows clear virus still upper airways. obviously 100% guarantee. Children getting sick children dying this. Even previously healthy comorbities. explain lot trends risk complications.  Midwest state rising hospitalizations exactly 4 weeks Sturgis ended? Looks like Delta staying schedule. Last time checked, truckers still need eat. Quitting job sounds fun all, people still need job put food table. jobs going require vaccinations near future, quitting avoid vax going solve anything unless willing retire completely. link? believe you, want link show others. No, isn‚Äôt, make majority anti-vaxxers area. handful all-natural crunchy type antivaxxers too, nowhere near many ones won‚Äôt get vaxxed due politicization vaccines. That‚Äôs job accepted is. Left good remote job remote government job changed minds 3 weeks made us person whole time. Spent 4 months trained via Microsoft teams. new class people whole department remote besides different manager week, would cycle. 

Pissed left good remote job it. Pissed leave government job safety. Starting. Remote insurance call center job two weeks tomorrow :/ I‚Äôll keep looking something better meantime.   Something tried push 2003 couldn‚Äôt suddenly have. also wasn‚Äôt wearing mask said wasn‚Äôt good child one. mentioned flu worse 2019 patients also refused give child flu shot year ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt help.‚Äù medical professionals, know vaccine safe effective take safety. Australia, approved covid however, prescribed patients label
BUT human versions 1% medication country veterinary versions short supply seems suggest Australians getting doctors.

Do anything backup assertion supplied doctors?? Run, don‚Äôt walk. That‚Äôs legitimately scary hell. going differ widely individual schools.

I'm teacher classrooms work even windows open. poster described school accurately. Teacher friends schools said similar things buildings. He‚Äôs entirely base.  overwhelming majority people get COVID relatively mild case involve seeking medical attention fully recover.  

This minimize small majority COVID patients get really sick die lasting effects, certainly happening, severe cases represent tiny percent COVID patients. I‚Äôve said along health privacy measures counterproductive terms making people take serious. 

That doctor Elmhurst broke apathy video footage early. I'm somewhat progressive town, schools last spring, school started year went back lunch PE indoors, leaving windows doors open, etc.

All parents sending angry letters actionable points, maybe get better soon. say why? Pfff, brother wife, pregnant time got last year. parents think big deal all. quarantine 2 weeks coworker worked alongside got like eh. truly believe like cold. can't even say flu kills thousands people every year. mean here. 

Covid become regional. San Mateo County never got hit quite hard states actively trying kill themselves. None hospitals fill surge beds county, instance. handful worst cases. 

If you‚Äôre vaccinated pop N95 think movie area R0 &lt; 1 reasonable. Again, regional. Yeah, cloth masks crappy, still help. look number cases, might seem impressive, look severity cases, hospitalizations deaths look awesome. reason filter biggest droplets, reduces number viruses infected with. initial innoculum size makes big difference. Ditto said ‚Äúso dangerous‚Äù around unvaccinated nurses. you‚Äôre saying wasn‚Äôt dangerous last year, since Delta much deadly it‚Äôs dangerous now. would like citation.

And cases you‚Äôre referring to, baby died infected unvaccinated nurse? It‚Äôs like get everything explained detail, respond ‚Äúbut‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt breathe?‚Äù sometimes think I'm hearing vital signs alarms ventilator alarms even I'm hospital know there's way could hearing them.

It's ""phantom phone vibration"" effect healthcare workers. Isn‚Äôt good news? Get anti vaxxers health care system!

If one doesn‚Äôt believe science, zero reason system based fucking science! totally finding hosts. hospitals full up. bad here, though, us vaccinated. think experience different people in, say, Alabama. 

I really hope get even contagious variant. felt rug pulled delta messed summer. going go movies. :( beloved midwives nurses called ‚Äústaffers‚Äù CNN stations need play every hour.. PSAs heck isn‚Äôt it. Would mind telling airline? Here's couple extra tables fit original post.
