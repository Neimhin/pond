0,2020-11-06," upset students get go school; upset fellow remote learners freedoms like parties sleepovers. crux it. never protecting yourself. using mask. mental flip pandemic first hit, ingrained us mask protect ‚Äúme‚Äù outside things. Instead, it‚Äôs largely keep infecting others happen asymptomatic spreader. think genie left bottle long ago. don‚Äôt see many people talking cons asynchronous learning. I‚Äôm senior high school right now, I‚Äôm hybrid model school got COVID we‚Äôre home while. Before, would class learning (mostly watch class videos chromebook ask teacher questions want) asynchronous home. part sucked. 

The teachers couldn‚Äôt give active instruction manage home kids grades we‚Äôre class, gained little actually there, except teachers decided eff it, they‚Äôll actively teach class. good side getting work done easier you‚Äôre school, get interact peers

At home, would complete assignments google classroom watch class videos, interacting anybody often turning things late lack structure. get lot sleep though

Now we‚Äôre home only, we‚Äôre zooms day 4 days week. meaningful contact peers (you can‚Äôt hold conversation friend zooms). zooms synchronous helped greatly. really suffer don‚Äôt get chance interact teachers ask questions, structure able get work done time. addition this, school starts later get better sleep

I always argued hybrid learning model, need interact teachers friends, way school handling it, school home better academically, though social interactions still suffer.

I‚Äôm going comment views parts discussion, really want views asynchronous learning heard, dismissed unnecessary disagreements North Jutland locked evidence cluster 5 seen, wear mask everywhere pretty much really understand conversation mother yesterday nephew‚Äôs elementary school class. class normally 25+ 8 students; rest quarantine due COVID. goes say ‚Äúand it‚Äôs fine! get sick, go home, feel better, come back. It‚Äôs totally fine.‚Äù bring risk grandparents comes back ‚Äúyou remember so-and-so? They‚Äôre 90s [their daughter] gave COVID, ended totally fine! Didn‚Äôt even go hospital!‚Äù wonders don‚Äôt call I‚Äôm depressed pandemic... Maybe straight say ""sorry talking nonsense that's do"". Social distancing alone, far it. get then... get much.

(See there?) Yeah tell shitty school district eager reopening schools ,and get emails least week,and let say happening single student facilities.
And yet people getting personally see mask mandates lifting around April/May. Even militant states. -insert Tim Eric mind blow explosion gif here- people think fake, bad say, etc ones crap. *original vertical alternative would useful study look whether safety measures taken countries make safe school?

Also look list countries studied mask usage, assuming majority schools around world allowing masks? Right? unemployed lung specialist Sweden today, even COVID, something way wrong face mask fetish. I'm sorry what's point lockdown schools going stay open? missing something? Covid everything could go wrong go wrong. Assume worst. Remember said:

Masks might needed? 

Does survive surfaces minutes?

It's airborne? 

World control October 2020 (this said sometime March).

You could get once. got must never gotten rid first time.

(fill medication / vitamins) cures covid.

Once develop anti-bodies good go (reality many long haulers).

Hot weather kill it.

You get point. 

Assume worst, wear masks social distance positivity cure thing, overly pessimistic comes virus ignore people tendency always play everything virus. understand post, all.  COULD GUESSED WOULD HAPPEN?!?! oh everyone? Oh .... right... ded? scientific task force estimates that's going happen 8 Nov. So, next month little optimistic. Duh-doy! *pikachu face* Chuck Goodrich Dr. McNinja F""ck 'em. nothing Biden's success election. Overlay covid map election map see trying year. 100 days herd immunity surprising, schools stay open people keep working, ""new"" lockdown nothing march lockdown. Outside, almost many people usual. second wave going worse first... European countries seem going direction :( Common sense, no? Schools gyms two things even CONSIDER suggesting safe, people sub lose fucking minds. Alternative sending fake test kits? send fake kits. Lockdown. Education. Logic fear. Remembering fucking idiots listen August September insisting riaing case numbers relevant creates angry knot stomach. numbers 1,000 per day sounds optimistic Well, election. Need keep rounding-the-corner story. fucking shit sherlock. vaccine herd immunity vaccinations, in-person classrooms still ways away. could told that. moderators quick take anything perceive ""political"", including anything would explain *why* obviously political policy decisions made.

(Apparently, political system facilitate spread virus, yet supposed try understand motivations policies. digress...)

In case, particular article quoted Polish lung specialist works Sweden made North Korean comparison.  claims even though Sweden could use physician specialty, can't get work parts Sweden today insists mask wearing. Someone please tell Quebec grandparents quarantine 2 weeks get tested, let kids days. 

If something like possible you, it. sanity well kids parents. suggesting, despite 130+ countries across world included study - seasons weather shifts, thus invalidating data? Holy fuck, PhD would much easier could write up.  OK.... Take airborne virus, get load kids multitude families mingle together enclosed rooms playgrounds. 

What else going happen?

The 21st Century equivalent [catapulting diseased fortified citadels.

That's lay understanding situation, anyhoo. live Germany friends Copenhagen. They‚Äôre still going bars restaurants, still mixing, still going groups. Insane Thanks. Looks like we'll find shortly. Best wishes too. Well face shields basically useless you‚Äôre sitting room people. 

You still breathing aerosols weren‚Äôt wearing mask. shields protect droplets flying face someone talks sneezes close by. There's also much R value increased by. Yes, schools don't. literally picked do. Isn‚Äôt kind thing inevitable surprise anyone? Surely animal mutations taken consideration scientific community? makes sense. live Denmark? dont think understand locked Denmark is. fucking shit, study finds. statistically significant reopening school closings 28 days. 7 14 days school reopening numbers' lower numbers 1.0. CI lower bound exactly 1.0 28 days. Someone help here. different news article said.

Lot extremely confounding variables applaud developing method untangle them. said, reporting 1.24 value seems overreach actual study.

Any idea would publish distribution data. would cool maybe someone could figure successful limiting spread. mean writes disinformation campaigns? US NIH/CDC recommended PCR test came back positive. covid-19. Go home shortness breath, come back hospital treatment.

In words, let disease take course without treatment. gets bad, come back.

Practice India / Bangladesh / many Latin American kit includes ivermectin among things. Go home, take drugs, [in places] also give ivermectin people household get sick.

Advantage early treatment: *kill virus* fully takes hold, messes immune system, pervades body harms organs.

Dr. Peter McCullough advocate treating covid-19 *early* home. [This 7-minute Dr. McCullough talking treating *himself* home, ivermectin (trigger warning) HCQ, among things. one guy. everyone. everyone treats us.

well, everyone. 40% country. gun offensive, mask preventative. like saying law stating people wear trousers bad freedom windmill front kids.

Edit: common mistake US. idea goes grain, make right. fact often, makes belligerent dumbass. Take care fellows Americans, things might get real bad there. Yet tinfoilers flatearthers germany think media ""system-controlled"" spread ""fake news"" - good hear neutral voice knows different things run Who'd thought place germs spread easiest infecting adults home would big contender R rate?

Literally entire world except governments. Probably idea seeing kids school pack boarding school 15 odd years. not, freaking kids schools. Bringing together expecting virus go away crazy. We're destructive, anyway. deserve exist. apparently, even less so. relevant whatsoever? 

I stated absolutely entertaining idea children missing year school in-person teaching implemented ways safe possible, especially pertaining elementary students struggling. sleep teenagers nothing stated. feel like limited in-person school enrollment, prioritizing greatest needs. Also schools need much protection place, starting mask mandates, improved ventilation, reduced class sizes. similar articles January:

""Spread novel coronavirus Chinese market 'hits scary buttons,' fears may overblown.""

The mink story something definitely worth monitoring preparing for. ""I want panic"" strategy trump's playbook work. attentive changes happening. 398 cases hospitals, 430 deaths areas last reported 3 days ago. 

Daily death count like 540 830. actual fuck dude... people still voted him... Probably late this, would accepted ""woken feeling like flu"" day event. I've done couple times far. less honest maybe bit cowardly, feel like dealing drama turning people down. study looked 131 countries. suggesting countries allow/encourage mask usage school? Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore included countries studied. Ha! America number two, Brazil 20% positivity rate, eat 'muricans üò§ Florida ranks 11th nationwide deaths/million, 792/million, much higher nationwide 729/million number---Don't think states ever surpass NY, NJ, Mass Ct's death tolls/million kind school? Elementary, middle, high?  didnt need study know this. Hey, turned lights?! shit, finds Sherlock. too! Google news. Danes stepping reality potential new pandemic. Buy faux fur. one worry battery caged animals spending pathetic lives metal wire cage, turned garment. recently, incubating brand new lethal mutated Covid-19 virus, could adversely affect whole world. So, yes, world news reports new threat Denmark. point is...? feel you!!!

I May 2021 wedding scheduled! Lol. exciting would otherwise since always chance issues could spark up.

We going go though. different situation small localized guest list.

I opinion things less normal anyway. live, things pretty damn near close normal right unfortunately. don‚Äôt see state keeping restrictions place vulnerable access vaccine. 

What going is, vulnerable guest vaccinated, guest can‚Äôt come. 10 vulnerable guests though 60 pretty reasonable suspect fine.

At point, thought everyone make call themselves. Vast majority guests 35 healthy.

We lucky demographics, even demographics, it‚Äôs still hard call. 

I feel guys! situation fun! fake news.....all high school graduates fb telling months covid disappear Nov 3rd. would trust Fauci guy met high school problems basic algebra? /s Spanish flu far, far deadlier towards younger people though. Covid-19 even tenth fatality rate younger age group. BODIOR I'm one got it, bring lunch school, mainly lunches school serves extremely small. immigrants USA, population would shrinking, it‚Äôs way decades. Women less 2.1 babies (the replacement rate). Yet Florida keeps dropping states affected Virus, 13th place country conclusion patently flawed. including significant factor affecting infectivity they've essentially fitted noise data. ""Declaring"" major flaw merely evasion tactics. reviewers let pass must grossly incompetent and/or biased. death cult? I'm declining playdates get togethers too. son turns 6 week already explained it'll small family party home virus dangerous. upset understanding! Teacher here. Students high school supposed come back person couple weeks (except students choosing stay remote). time, school board insists holding virtual board meetings safety. Fucking exactly. 

It's absolute madness, feel like ton parents effectively gaslit line ""reasoning"" comes in-person instruction vs remote learning. 

I need someone explain 10 12 days in-person instruction child would get per month (based 3/2 system), months, difference growing capable, contributing member society versus completely stupid degenerate, far sounds like unsubstantiated nonsense. #***Hey, turned lights?!*** evidence caused deaths? Deaths worldwide derived CHINA. dispute fact. deaths elsewhere somehow Trump supposed able prevent here.
 
Quid Pro Joe covered don‚Äôt worry. Well 30.000 Germany next week... What? dont want warriors get blessed like POTUS? vaccine hope grade teach? I‚Äôm curious work wide range ages notice different ages process COVID differently. brother still high school opted complete remote learning year. watched school board meeting months district horrendous. Grown adults called crying kids wouldn‚Äôt able play sports, school friends voted complete remote experience. members board crying vote pretty split either go completely remote, allow students pick one wanted. 

A week meeting whole band quarantine, someone tested positive band camp week. ended allowing students pick whether would want go school remote learn. seems like every week certain section school send kids home quarantine someone tested positive. Oh, cases county grown thousands following return school. 

I completely understand issues placed families single parent working, can‚Äôt support young child remote learning home alone day. baffles going remote learning back February year, district exact plan place last minute.

If people could take seriously would done now, least much better state. Like wear mask stop going pointless stuff. gas station week ago overheard two guys saying anybody wearing mask sheep needs open eyes real world. Almost like broken record. pointless though. prefer humans Einstein caliber geniuses morally perfect? Well yeah, think people would.

Except that's thing: everything relative. everyone 180 IQ genius would actually 100 IQ average...because 100 always average, that's system works. Morality relative. morally perfect one reprehensible another.

So really things impossibilities. Bemoaning people stupid agree useful bemoaning live paradise unlimited resources scarcity.

Do want less people uninformed ignorant people educated? course. that's different thing intelligence: smart yet uninformed ignorant person relatively unintelligent reasonably educated informed person. mutually exclusive.

As anti-natalism, I've always found approach incredibly stupid generally populated depressed people personally clearly enjoying things somehow extrapolate misery everyone else assume nobody else good time either.

By means want kids them, campaigning EVERYONE else kids height idiocy imo. Tell rioters Yeah, top post MI rona sub right pretty much calling people murderers wanting go eat. ‚ÄúUp Ass, Corona‚Äù

‚ÄúYou, Me, Cytokine: Romance Novel‚Äù source virus wet market never found. still even sure type animal came from. opportunity respond level.

What monitoring? preparing for? included already daily life COVID. vaguely afraid endless bad possibilities helps one prevents none outcomes coming fruition.  look closest coronavirus ""relatives"" SARS-CoV-2, pretty obvious *really* dodged bullet - already awful - virus. SARS-CoV-1 fatality rate 10%, whereas MERS-CoV killed 1 3 infected. Imagine virus infectious current one also capable a/pre-symptomatic spread, fatality rate several magnitudes higher... 
 
This pandemic bad, things considered, best-case scenario comes severe respiratory coronaviruses going global rampage.   Seeing people responsible die watch agencies supposed help keep people alive actively work beheast president would drive person insane. agree Kids spread it!!!!!

/s Kids get favorite astronauts: 

The Crewmates everyone knows cows make best burger flippers Every time I've heard Tegnell speak said ""herd immunity goal"". correct that. pandemic end herd immunity affected populations, something aim naturally. was, would encouraged spread summer hospital availability high. threat changed actually, it‚Äôs gotten worse new highs seeing. normal going people worrying family members contracted virus want ""get back normal"" going make it, God forbid burying family friends beat it? taken seriously beginning taken seriously now. change power White House next conspiracy theory going Democrats still trying kill Republicans virus Trump can't run (or votes) 2024 election? Yes people call space cowboy Wake inside. DeSantis one worst... I'd think Democrats would likely ignore virus election Biden sworn makes look like Biden controlling virus. Let's real. Conservatives never gave fuck virus. That's one reasons voted mostly blue first time aim herd immunity AIDS example. 

How else think AIDS pandemic could end? slow-spreading one, could exception could stop spread without immunity. seems unlikely world. absolutely seeking evidence taking precautionary actions. actively researched they're culling almost 20M animals. ""It's time panic"" ""There reason concerned"" two different statements. Half us actively spread show they're scared. Surprised Pikachu face lie? herd immunity strategy? Guess find out? Florida Department Health reported 53 new coronavirus deaths statewide Friday, bringing state's death toll 17,014. included number **2,010 non-residents** died virus.

It says 2,010 nonresidents, 210.

That puts closer 11 12%.  people claim numbers inflated, hospitals lying. direct quotes I've heard are, ""guy comes car crash dies, mark covid. ""

I understand motivation opinions. trying hard downplay it, say conspiracy? really think need footage people suffering dying. know horrible nobody put display like that, many people ""out sight, mind"" easy assume bullshit. bad around them, probably bad anywhere. need open eyes. fuck wat? still studies fking obvious. know flus spread pandemic remain herd immunity, Swedish strategy based assumption infection stopped (without herd immunity) method therefore try slow spread manageable levels herd immunity occur help vaccines. true Swedish strategy would spreading infection order achieve immunity. usually mean talk ""herd immunity strategy"", strategy ends herd immunity meaningless definition pretty much every country it. ...

sigh... Human stupidity really limitless exemplified comment one wrote another post. US also averaging 100k new cases day.

Apples oranges. located? parents sign everyone else home? Definitely one interesting books come 2020. danish, hard time understanding swedish spoken, especially spoken really fast:) bit easier read. hope international translations well, swedish strategy really affect politics US severely, it? thank you:) Tail

Makes rockin' world go assumed way talking friend seeing friend person. good point. people care abstract people suffering dying. need 'feel' person present lives care them. almost though filming charming entertaining individuals compromised health. Personally, get fatigue. Public health good individual good economy. scared stupid. one thing election pandemic taught us all, average person WHOLE LOT DUMBER gave credit for. Anyone would let kid go slumber party pandemic idiot doesn‚Äôt value life children‚Äôs life much. said. think people monitoring progress world saving vaccine trails, silly... calculations disagree me. That‚Äôs ok doesn‚Äôt mean either us wrong. It‚Äôs moral question varies bigly depending much value years life, quality life, social interaction, freedom, security, things. It‚Äôs unscientific question different people come different conclusions based much value things. obviously different values, hence came different conclusion Republicans: fuck kids. supposed keep day? home me?! true. see people face shields time nothing else. Absolutely horrifying. say...  did. first reason rejecting rest. want live society without contributing Thanks share  place huge emphasis masks though? [WHO recommends using distance 1 metre cannot literally everyone actually together, government competent held people accountable, could mostly done this.

We could wearing masks otherwise grand ol' time minimal infections.

But no, 8 months later still get terrified every time allergies asthma act up, morons complaining refusing listen start going 'omg still? fucking get it?'

No, dingus, can't go vacation party month. Seek help brain damage friend. shit. genetic link superspreading? know one study found genetic link severe covid - - makes wonder genes affect interferons also affect superspreading somehow? really need get more. Shocker, know   Everyone carrying gun nothing prevent crime.


Everyone wearing mask prevents viruses spreading.


So yes, point sounds dumb.



It's illegal fire gun air populated areas, even pointing anyone. falling bullets kill people.


It matter less 18,000 people year get murdered, still illegal.

Cover mouth nose mask prevent spread deadly virus. mutated form coronavirus spread humans found mink farms. stop shitting night owls please. imagine someone grocery shopping night happens think actually goes bicep Wow!! surprise!  /s Nice. soooo europe far worse US stop making fun Americans time? Tbh I'm waiting everyone get bc one trying even attempt cooperate Thinking happy thoughts causes coronavirus surge... I'm gonna honest. read comment got impression you. ü§∑ Trying puzzle out. usual, one listened understood actually said, surprise counter-evidence Tegnell acknowledges chosen alternative accepting certain spread infection herd immunity separates us infection. objection always difference realizing herd immunity required striving achieve soon possible. Sweden striving achieve soon possible. measure number available hospital beds number deaths.

We that, too. results also good. Wisconsin says hello, gladly pass torch Massachusetts catch up. Letting year shit idea; upvotes?! I've saying this. omega-3fa's gentle anticoagulants, also effective down-regulating inflammation, esp inflammatory pathways relevant SARS-CoV-2 infection.

They least part comprehensive integrative strategy.  That‚Äôs feel me, I‚Äôm hairstylist see 50 different strangers every week long period time breathing talking bubble. masks makes feel unsafe regardless. I‚Äôm risk people love bunch kids close proximity causes contagious virus spread rapidly? WOW would've thunk article, doubt many opinion pieces, seem saying ending mink industry unnecessary. false, two reasons.

This specific mutation spread easily minks, know spread well humans (most likely not). strain would constantly spread mink farms jump humans, would eventually mutate something contagious humans. infects human already infected another strain time, exchange genetic material end combination mutations either strain. Based number people estimate caught new strain percentage Denmark currently infected, likely happened yet. absolutely would reservoir strain remained mink farms hundreds thousands animals close proximity.

Second, coronavirus mink farms constantly jumping back forth humans mink, huge population mink constantly spread. catastrophically risky new mutations arise - far, far riskier bat farming wet markets would be. Continuing mink farming anywhere world pure foolishness part humanity. One hope Denmark NL end mink farming UN convince countries so. Anyone done bodybuilding, recovering disease, done disease come back lifting? Im last days quarantine, still feeling chest pain sometimes, want know would safe start again? WELL, YEAH We're rough spot. school effectively offer 0 support daughter behind reading. help her, able literally sit entire day.

She's better year, know would done started year remote.

The saving grace little town 0 positives last months, someone class tested positive two weeks ago.

I know do, man. US' population 1918 barely 103 million, equivalent 1.8 million compared 2020's population. would lived longer. End of.  ordered bidet. Yay! calculations got wrong answer. Reset. Try again. fucking infect me. (Trying state civil way possible.) Panic hot right don't. There's herd immunity Brazil India, show study possible safely, public schools. 

My mom teaches public school, kid positive even quarantine siblings!

My step son private school, 5 cases 4 campuses. 3 time, class elementary. One difference could spend millions summer overhauling hvac endowment that. Public school money. Without funding schools appropriately take safety measures colors stand chance. First off, US never national lockdown. 7 states never lockdown kind. Florida locked April 1st, weeks people starting staying home. 

Second, Sweden compared Scandinavian neighbors similar population density, demographics, etc. Sweden 10 times deaths per capita Norway, Finland, Denmark GDP dropped farther Q2. 

The bottom line people aren‚Äôt going restaurants, etc anyway Covid gets truly control. Lockdowns last resort mask wearing sensible measures failed. lockdowns definitely work want transmission near zero. It‚Äôs trade short term pain long term disaster. get concept inside outside glove, right? Maybe also get medical personnel wear gloves good reasons? going go tortured logic too. aim herd immunity AIDS example. 

And article Tegnell lied herd immunity strategy. strategy best. school work require masks students desks, fucking stupid yep nieces practically home every weeks come contact someone tested positive. feel bad them. Fat Cobra like... There's multiple international studies looked cause effect schools found cause outbreaks. studies following then? one OP found correlation schools opening R rate direct link account multiple factors. Savannah, GA absolutely beautiful. would definitely recommend trying out. I‚Äôm glad them. give hope cherish extra time safety have. know mean, sometimes feel awful I‚Äôm sorry didn‚Äôt choice here. wanted family. appreciate hope stay safe. Solidarity need like three pandemics happen Walmart. Every time go, regret it. Norway chilling lol. ""it affect young people""... can‚Äôt talk without seeing infections. make go work, make stay home. called vaccine.  Hmmm. right, something off. Yeah do. Millions people line get inoculated flu every year. made sure me, family, friends got year. part means ensuring weakest us protected much strongest. Take racism elsewhere, guy. Usually spikes, that‚Äôs 7 day averages better reference, even states report ‚Äúeveryday‚Äù day day fluctuation. flu. I‚Äôm Florida yes believe right. reason, viral infections tougher fight colder, drier air. I‚Äôve social distancing part, please start talking infection rate vs death rate. it‚Äôs bunch sickness limited death we‚Äôre different pre-Covid. don‚Äôt mind distancing staying home, never feel like truly cover real damage. glad don‚Äôt kids don‚Äôt live particular nightmare. Parents- children condolences must tough everyone involved. Thank Jay typical dishonest thing implying blame increased suicides restrictions disregarding anxieties caused pandemic whole. Kind shameful someone level. R rate, also known reproduction number, helps government measure rate coronavirus infections.

It gives indication number people one person coronavirus likely pass to.

It's also worth pointing R number measure infectious disease is, deadly.

Based estimates, R rate used guide rather up-to-the-minute representation pandemic. Yeah educators auxiliary staff schools fucked exposed grand experiment reopening middle pandemic society could get shit together.

Don't surprised teachers quit never come back. already stressed system collapse ONE would support us.

Many educators knew fact exactly science would bear out, yet still tons people including verified virologists board trying argue continue open schools stating 'there's evidence schools driving pandemic!'   Oh poor farmer! Kids also die flu yet don‚Äôt ‚Äúdo part‚Äù. many people. Expect cases go minimum likely go up. Except studies actually study cause effect correlation show schools cause today ‚Äúno shit‚Äù news. Lol too. Thanks Alex Jones mRNA vaccine platform, successful, could lead effective vaccines everything flu certain cancers. could designed built far quickly vs current strategy guessing flu strains arrive months advance. assuming works. Friday ""Hold beer"" Florida numbers, lol IFR varies age. also true flu every cause death known us. IFR may 50% nursing homes, 1% average 60-year old, 0.1% average 40-year-old.

In NYC outbreak, 1.6M people caught 24,000 died. I‚Äôm Switzerland indeed lockdown. nationwide lockdown. federal government left decision lockdowns go local government, individual cantons. non-essential shops closed month, home office recommended travel general discouraged talking shit state? lol want discussion can, looking history troll trash hahaha. rioting county we're list. Mostly hicks going stand lifestyle changes government sponsored flu /s agree more. Denmark amazing country, wish whole world benefits system pretending perfect limited cultists. far behind guys

There's cases US past 2 days alone cases Canada since beginning pandemic.

I know 1/10th population, still, that's insane. got source claim? Anyone know scientific reason virus jump humans Denmark infected mink farms like Utah Wisconsin? Masks mandated work. People take dirty hands, shove pocket, jump car coworkers go get taco bell. put back they've clocked back in, sitting break room chatting together.

Masks would working wonderfully used intended alongside social distancing handwashing.

People living life normally plus sometimes putting disgusting dirty mask required them. course working.  feel sarcastic, I'm going respond like meant /s. completely different time. common finish high school necessary jobs. world changed lot 20 years people competing global workforce. 

And pretty disturbing knocking free lunch. 1/5 kids live poverty go hungry often school lunches breakfast might real meals get day. Sharpest bulbs bush  terrifyingly hypocritical species, demanding China shut ""wet markets"" (as should) criticizing ""eating bats"" yet nations mink farms factory farms breeding grounds disease... South Dakota 52.2% according don‚Äôt even understand comment. believe current administration make huge difference. they've basically anti-science. worry it‚Äôs going go rich people too. Like celebrities knew covid back March miraculously able get test. Wow that‚Äôs insane. \+123,749 right now. Great. great. fudge people there? Coughing other's faces? sufficient data newly emergent virus, say ""F it, science know crap!"" proceed *more* caution, even inconvenient, expensive, seems silly.

And definitely avoid recycling medical tropes apply virus without facts data. someone warned repeatedly would happen. ü§î Kindergartener Exactly, agree. township‚Äôs school district done wonderful job balancing person school safety. Distancing, offering home virtual options, etc. teachers done wonderful job. case school transmission. kid family member gets it, close classroom, contact trace, open determined school transmission.

My kindergartner thriving mood markedly better back school, learning, interacting kids age. 

So I‚Äôm saying - expect place kids lucky enough live possible...and want option kids. wonder took long? money celebrities. managed get tested first, they‚Äôll probably manage get vaccinated first.  They=GOP btw covid isnt virus closing society entirely ever for. Spanish flu yes. mortality rate 0.1% people 45 low 60, still low double digits 80, want cause permanent damage young minds economy? see it. 7 9 aggregate sites that? divide 2 add numbers back Tuesday Thursday, etc nothing huge spikes 3 days? ignore Stockholm syndrome funny gives shit like? many places Europe point health care system getting closer collapsing.

I zero tolerance people like like.
If seriously can't arsed go pub month, let alone one day save people's lifes belong society. Go live woods.
(Not specifically) Know bunch people health care industry anti vax means also believe vaccines aren¬¥t totally safe yet.

History tells us vaccines given mass population usually take 10 years trial ones tested months ... reasonable concern imo 25% dead NY nursing homes. city 25% geriatrics. It‚Äôs still simple ‚Äúeveryone 13 school home.‚Äù

* students physical learning disabilities? legally-mandated accommodations teacher needs provide classroom, aren‚Äôt always possible provide virtual instruction 
* students rely school free reduced breakfast lunch? Food insecurity significant issue facing children ages. 
* access reliable internet connection complete classes? someone working home, tell network infrastructure American cities CANNOT handle much data throughput EVERYONE home using network. students rural areas satellite internet might option - them? 

Do problems possible solutions? Sure. solutions aren‚Äôt always congruent original idea, kids certain age stay home. 

It‚Äôs disappointing leadership failed us didn‚Äôt even try solve issues, also recognize incredibly difficult problems solve, particularly without federal state support. DUUUUUUUUUUUUH. Breaking News: Sisyphus Accepts Job Offer, Shocks Nobody Jumping water makes wet, studies find forced open cases surging. tried top force colleges schools open person learning extremely unsafe. constantly encourages states/people/businesses ignore science wear mask. much theory. Let's honest ourselves, here. Arguably worst. see 12 cases, (but note 12 really small sample size.). bigger issue mutated virus way current vaccines likely ineffective - could also mean previous COVID-19 infection protect cluster-5 infections. Water wet It‚Äôs even finished: [it‚Äôs 5:39 cst. trend alarming considering winter hasn‚Äôt hit regions yet, major holidays horizon, everyone really angry everyone else time.  get it. Many people made change. something said way go life going forward. (as Americans) overeat...really overeat. Health Every Size movement help. pandemic hit last year, I'd fearful hit year, I'm fearful people. don‚Äôt believe mask efficacy correlated ambient temperatures. Ct i0 9 milllion ppl die every year famine. print name age front pages. Prediction: thanksgiving, probably 200K cases. Christmas, probably around 100K cases. mortality rate covid less 1%, yes - statistically unlikely children die it. 

That doesn‚Äôt mean shouldn‚Äôt take seriously couldn‚Äôt spread higher risk populations couldn‚Äôt cause permanent damage lungs etc. NOVEL, might point. IFR stats tell complete story.

And kid die, lung scaring instead? Use brain.  Damn US keeps setting new records. pentagon sent 3? Medical teams well long-term anxiety, stress, depression lockdowns causing children worse coronavirus ever be. Yes read people get false negatives also tend infectious. long time little community spread across Midwest too. argument happening premise community somehow immune COVID. That‚Äôs dangerous assumption make one we‚Äôve making time time America. don‚Äôt outbreak right now. really hope never do. US logging 100,000 cases today signs slowing down, statistically it‚Äôs coming schools community. takes one person set outbreak. Who‚Äôs life willing gamble with? seems nowadays need studies tell us obvious. knew children get transmit disease, advantage generally mild forms. No, ever say mexico, america, canada. lol. that's argument. trying make arguments me, that's straw man fallacy. Sometimes feel like I'm crazy worrying much do. would rather parents (one surgery) get thanks carelees. worry masks &amp; social distancing enough, especially around half everyone nearby wear one, therefore restrict going outside. Even little restriction constantly gets scoffed at. damn frustrating exhausting deal with. Shame havent figured goes two ways really know stand I'm sure argument nuanced enough. Statistically children unlikely die covid agree families could risk although nuance is- many crack users live beyond age 40... many gang? many true food insecurity situations? 

There ""right"" answer way living horrible around children. think I'd support in-person meeting too. messy conclude one way other. That's good. lot crowded cities India vaccine protect lot people. Oh really nothing Earth? countries freak get +10k / day

America: +10k since last update hour ago overweight obesity considered underlying conditions covid, majority country status. always shaken head people pushed point. pretty useless point corona glides right past healthy people, live US, country like Japan people normal weight. hell expect people do, miraculously lose overnight? valid theoretical point, reality pretty moot one. mine. sent home 80 students 2 weeks quarenitne contact positive case. bummed home online learning 2 weeks. applaud school precaution though.  probably contain decently even schools open, everyone puts effort Also careful hanging around fact, may want room two weeks. Best tell, engineers come every testing method could possibly think detect virus ""aura"" take fraction second. We'll never see anything brain-pokey, probably accurate Q-Tips though. Sounds like Quarians Mass Effect universe open schools don‚Äôt think virus spreads school much friends hanging other, parties, celebrating birthdays. Opening schools allows people meet.  That's said, anyway. godawful know better. even legal state?

If accord health rules definitely report ASAP health....

Frankly even illegal report police least discourage national public service messaging campaigns educate public wearing masks avoiding risky behavior keep virus bay keep schools businesses open.

We entered second lockdown cases rising people still given up. thing bothers see people wear get places like supermarket, soon past security drop down. selfish. Well shit... Well that‚Äôs good read, mink thing got worked again, covid.. election.. mink... mutant virus... yeah fun week - here.

100% probability yokel thinks virus overblown went local pub infect 10 others asymptomatic Fair enough, maybe say fun alone forever bad late reply went bed soon got home. 6 hours instead 4 found 220 people 113 wore mask correctly(54%) 72 mask (33%) remainder 35 nose out.(13%) rounded percents up. decently similar day. people saw prob least couple hundred people throughout shift didn‚Äôt see time count. It‚Äôs retail job interact customers lot also noticed rude people shift, mask on, also noticed majority people without masks evening like 6-8pm I‚Äôd say. wish people would wear masks! Would JCAHO interested? Sold China processed clothing, exported high demand countries including US European countries. yes let's purely focus Asian countries. White exceptionalism strikes Cause get see friends teachers. Instead sitting alone computer.  No, I'm Florida. kids area get free lunch also makes sense. seems lot easier give everyone school age children rather families apply go hundreds thousands, millions applications. Plus way people know could apply access internet/electronic devices go without. 

This also Florida overwhelmed unemployment site kept crashing I'd imagine would happened Myaccess site too. mention possibly could saved state money. Unemployment sky high families would apply if, say family 4 would qualified 4, automatically gets card 2 children family, may apply 2 adults used got kids. happened next door neighbor. sahm family 6, husband worked full time lost job covid. would qualified foodstamps 6 got card 4 kids never applied more. said ‚ÄúiTs tWo wEeKs!‚Äù short vaccine BTFO Welcome mandatory cooking.

To respond actual criticism, say ""everyone america"" eats. said ""the kinds Americans"" eat unhealthy food likely sudden drastically change eating habits cook home. I'll stand statement. responding comment people forced cook home instead eating restaurant food would, whole, lose lot weight think highly unlikely.  Well certain wrong regarding risk transmitting back humans. Thats ridiculous notion.

We also certain since US, next nothing different likely solution chosen.

And lastly, also likely see entirely different mutated strain jump specific minks people point future hasnt occurred yet certain wont noticed, US, far long. Yeah know mean.

Conspiracies always impact people here, distrust anything COVID related, virus masks vaccine huge. honestly did. moments time past month week. Wow..that actually meaningful punishment. Interesting. bad Teacher distance learning, students always telling weekend - slumber parties, weddings, traveling. proven 'base' vaccine would easier adjust it, similar flu vaccine altered yearly strain? Mass extinction events nothing new fur sold China turned fur clothing, high demand Russia, United States, European countries, Japan South Korea.

But yes please go blame Chinese white majority countries absolved sins. shit üôÑ 

I could rant reasons terrible idea open schools, virus taught people care people, people whatever hell want regardless warnings. shame everyone forced work conditions, along workers loved ones. feel custodians choice put extra risk. Reopening school's something even considered, way went stupid stupid get. Still, earlier better. let virus get cranking like US spread every nook corner, already late. Ikr? Probably fewer reason made political here. people ask ""well trump supposed do?!?!"" going show example plan looks like. contrast ""open schools.""

Of course, plan like never going implemented trump stock market like it. shit! Kids mostly asymptomatic therefore mainly spread thing. I'll leave CDC said 2007 respect long schools closed pandemic. See page 10 12 respectfully states category 2 small chance going category exactly. Bars, restaurants, cinemas, etc. get closed beat virus. 

The consequences, however, letting kids go school much worse small increase R. Gosh get banner this!?? Perhaps Americans (&lt;- see American history 101) unwilling sacrifice liberties weighing risks. Can't imagine whole country could possibly founded premise. Americans acting completely character. Completely. Yeah except possibility directly discussed people announcing discovery reason news first place. Seems like high schools / local schools problematic tbh (since going home family every night). I‚Äôm currently large university quite stable cases besides weekend parties safe. However universities bad outbreaks case count. aged well. child school classmates getting sick. far, positive tests Covid. hear kids carpool talking sleepovers, five family 11 child pod! believe spread occurring outside classroom. child‚Äôs school plexiglass around 3 sides desk spaced 6 feet, BlueAir HEPA filters classroom. class assigned colored t-shirt monitor kids mixing classroom‚Äôs. Also, school going back online learning Thanksgiving January precaution.

A girl carpool got infected brother attends different school. Now, school almost kids got sick cold 3rd grade class. case, definitely spread classroom.

So 3 person carpool risky, wearing masks. child using Halo masks filter. way! Wow many 1st graders figured one out? shocking people dismissing importance education school. Especially young children. Research shows long-term damage missing school.

Unfortunately simple. School important, data around world showing schools one primary sources outbreaks, second LTCs cases. theory, closing locking drivers outbreaks. reaction schools shut restaurants, gyms, hair salons, etc. (all significantly lower instances sources infections - we're talking 3% vs 50% places) allowed open exactly said. Covid infections acquired schools trickle general population. case, schools kept open costs? There's straight answer.

My old school done 100% hybrid - i.e. remote students 'class' in-person students, get live feed class instead sat room. Seems working well they're month 3 cases, remote students get interaction classroom.

I wonder countries take swiss patients, lockdown. Absolutely.

I'm already drooling conspiracies theories ""viking revenge"" working virus lab Facebook Yeah, pretty much assume I‚Äôll catch eventually. minimize risk hope everyone else well, need visit hospital enough room. Yeah makes sense. contracted virus again. imagine lot people getting sick, take lot precautions. kid talks wants go back full time.

And need reminded intense danger situation. even honoring possibility time. seems odd:

1. They've many cases overall current prevalence low (although disproportionately concentrated), checking exemptions seems like much work testing;
2. know long immunity lasts, although good reasons suspect least protection nine months they've risk.

So: make sense test recovered workers, make sense test anyone? Welp, goes another spike MO infections  need scaled opening. kids need school there. capability keep home should. yeah, shit. Fair enough. required able teach home stay virtual need return least attempt social distance. least limit number potential carriers. many soccer moms kid's school want ""me time"".... act like parent functioning member society something! 



Edit add: work multiple part-time jobs, virtual 3 kids home limit numbers school. ""No Thanksgiving, Christmas, fourth July. world [candidate JB] wants""

/\ largely many people care. leader, reason think, 60 years sleazy corrupt businessman, interests mind, telling ""no big deal, rounding corner."" would protests people chanting ''We need Mcdonalds!!!'' Ya think? think so, I‚Äôm moved anecdotal stories. nature. would tragic certain states want pretend nothing happening though. also, going way ACA set up, could totally see suggest, happening. lot anti-mask states still havent wont meager Medicaid expansion. well, duh. There's antivax nurses hope. 


Still full support protecting healthcare workers first though. covid cocktail May: 

- CBD (liquid dose morning night, 30-50mg per dose) 
- Aspirin (two low dose pills day, one morning, one bed)
- Vitamin C &amp; (amounts taken varied)

I threw everything could. Seemed work. Could exposed small viral load since masked exposed fairly short term. definitely hurt anything. signs helpful back then, surprised taking long come mainstream. Especially CBD showing lot promise, also helped lot came sleeping body aches. Anyone interested watch Dr Campbell too: get hopes up. article best read I‚Äôve found explaining could start whole new pandemic. article, it‚Äôs clear authorities don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve found every single human case. blunts effectiveness antibodies, would mean frontrunner vaccines won‚Äôt work it, early intervention antibody treatments.

The Irish government locking everything else allow schools stay open. long run better kids development, academic social. turn allows parents work less economic impact. 

It think working virus levels low enough. Places like US control another story. mean come say aren‚Äôt really sending troops fight covid, 180 say you‚Äôre one it, pretty much ends discussion right there.  feel like someone make website complies ""anti mask"" stores know avoid. Several business owners, mainly restaurants, vocal hatred governor (NM). never go businesses again. end sight. Keeps going up. Huh. Color delusional cuz it‚Äôs working fairly well past 9 months. He‚Äôs 7 though, he‚Äôs 9 brother 12.

I latchkey kid 7 though, problems homework, chores, making something eat dinner. Hundreds thousands kids every day. require structure though, get it‚Äôs unfathomable some. Cancer absolutely transmissible, important kids vaccinated HPV. Anyone wondering situation, watch Dr Campbell:  really annoying habit constantly editing comments add essential information needs adressed.

I remember long discussion adamantly claimed Public Health Agency everything power stop spread infection sudden say strategy ""allow slow spread"". Pff. fucking shit. say? would thunk it? Damn. bet Biden takes office there‚Äôs going strict lockdown. lol, _you_ used term ""first wave"" original post. _didn't_ use term followup RemindMe!.

Quick, scramble talking point sheet! must clever bit pedantry use also disqualify term ""peak"". course I'll use ""high point"", do, _american_? wondering situation, listen guy, Dr Campbell, sheds useful info topic: Looks like going keep getting worse.

Only January. Can't wait science based policies! ‚Äúkids aren‚Äôt risk get it‚Äù? Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Fuck me, it‚Äôs almost gather bunch people together global pandemic, people gonna get sick.

If could‚Äôve prevented this. number people sub shouting ""kids spread COVID"" ""outbreaks ever caused school openings"" incredible. Tell people called CPS parents letting children play yard alone. No, I'm making up. kids trusted parents, overly offended intrusive people world.

[Example forget idiots kept saying ""stop spreading government propaganda alarming news. matters number deaths they're low"" till 2 weeks ago. seem believe agreeing argument makes fallacious. agreement neither necessary needed argument valid. she‚Äôs obviously wrong and/or clueless. 1. Except they've seen transmission go cats back. top that, minks particular problem case farmed kept close quarters ensuring rapid spread. circumstance doesnt exist cats remotely similar way.

2. think randomly finding 12 people exact strain insignificant virus, simply understand exponential growth.

3. Again, articles saying anything ""we know impacts vaccines"" simply downplaying situation. havent studies yet. Wow, almost mild symptoms covid. That's way worse death. delusional think leave 7 year old home alone 8 hours day, 5 days week without disaster, let alone finishing schoolwork own. I‚Äôve seen, it‚Äôs much effective vaccinate people spread disease- young people. That‚Äôs compounded fact elderly don‚Äôt great immune response even vaccinated. 

Obviously healthcare workers first, though. There's ideal solution problem. COVID deadly SARS1, people would likely prefer starvation sending kids back school. No, really? shocker. Yet everyone keeps denying schools stay open matter bad things are. Ya don‚Äôt say, funny works means 7% people dropped dead COVID symptoms.

The 93% died heart attack pnumonia, caused covid promoted underlying condition. people going die anyway weeks. Yep, lived roommates May year despite making $100k+ medium cost living area. Obviously could afforded live that, spend money need to. Artists struggling put food table right now. What‚Äôs point writing great live theatrical production nobody watch anyway? wanted teachers risk lives benefit kids, pushed get teachers paid though vital important parts society economy. ship sailed long time ago. Since general public loves shit public education (on sides aisle especially United States) sorts ways, one gets fucking say teachers risk lives kids. Especially little pay respect get. goes essential workers too, including grocers, truck drivers, etc; People backbone society spat upon. basically definition sophistry. Montrealer here: agree. Or, Canada's Florida, (insert US State extra stupid). requirements childcare facilities (esp Y) followed 100% time really point (we‚Äôre underpaid, underfunded, management isn‚Äôt preparing us offer safe environment). keep kids home it‚Äôs really worth point. addressing saying would big deal children miss year education, people supporting online hybrid schooling. 

Data research looking point towards in-school students kindergarten fourth grade spreading coronavirus significant way. Parties house gatherings far likely spread virus much greater risk communities. 

With said, research new. see lot anecdotal incidents cases day out. think middle high schools online except unusual circumstances cannot dismiss in-person schooling young elementary students gathering far. content richer politicians doom innocent members working population...

Let House Lords run estates, seem incompetent matters National Health. tell role children transmission yet fully understood. date, outbreaks involving children schools reported. However, small number outbreaks reported among teaching associated staff date suggests spread COVID-19 within educational settings may children generally milder illness fewer symptoms, cases may sometimes go unnoticed. Importantly, early data studies suggest infection rates among teenagers may higher younger many countries starting slowly lift restrictions activities, longer-term effects keeping schools open community transmission yet evaluated. modelling studies suggest school re-opening might small effect wider transmission community, well understood. studies underway role children transmission outside educational settings. collaborating scientists around world develop protocols countries use study COVID-19 transmission educational institutions.

All available data yes, opening schools lead increase role clear know it‚Äôs limited. Micheal Bay's songbird movie. TikTok videos Avoid touching things, avoid room together, avoid using bathroom avoid using dishes. Texas country, would rank 10 world Corona ranking. Yeah cool, send kids house. I‚Äôll gladly help like neighbors kids started bitching ‚Äúforgetting‚Äù hygiene rules limits screen time. I'll take Oxford vaccine others one decides personal sacrifices worth it, thanks shock. need waste money study this. common sense.

Schools closed. Conservatives want able bodies know info Individual states lock think afford it. I'm sure, record set 5 days Halloween, also average incubation period Covid.

Guess we'll see shit good.  Hmm red kinda sus expect Welcome Society help less fortunate us. Unlike predecessor, DK testing extremely high rates.

DK one world's highest test rates one world's highest genome sequencing rates tested positive. Many thousand genomes sequences, huge considering size outbreak country. Despite found 12. So, variant still around (it found samples last month), it'll certainly quite rare. Based might think DK overreacting, they're willing take chances. much prefer cautionary approach instead risking it.

Anyway, variant still around it'll discovered they're upping testing every single positive genome sequenced. WOULD FUCKING THOUGHT mink parents lazy. kids get schoolwork done 2 hours. fill day we‚Äôve bought extra educational material use supplement crap district provides. lock devices school work done. yes, think small amount effort, motivated fine. seems parents forgot provide structure motivation success. kids aren‚Äôt motivated imagine difficult teachers!!? Welcome reddit... That's name heard long time.

Now excuse me, go read whole Dr. McNinja omnibus. fucking shit. next thing we‚Äôll report taking masks eat people isnt safe feel like Pfizer vaccine first one available sounds like teacher using synchronous part correctly then. whole point flipped-classroom allow either class discussion, individualized support (i.e. office hours). Zoom saying ""Are questions?"" sound like effective use synchronous learning time. maybe....maybe... Also people, 

* ""Why kid wear mask?!"" 
* ""Open schools can't live fear!"" 
* ""We can't football year!"" I‚Äôm taking it. intelligent taking it. one ‚ÄúI believe trust government‚Äù type person. Nothing wrong different breeds. It‚Äôs deadly mink kills 40%   country fricking world actually working hygiene script schools, bad idea? Well yea, within reason would stay home. definatly longer going work sick. Lol bad mentioned talk online France US equivalent cases 11/3 181,656----11/4 202,790----11/5 290,230---and today 302,430 sympathise people crack.

crack rocks! think opinion. Health personnel using real PPE following strict hygiene guidelines still get infected Beginning sept last time let kids sleep grandparents. live ocean county grandparents Monmouth. even feel comfortable visiting us going there. risk great I'd like alive Christmas. severe population reduction mean losing 0.3% population worst case scenario still growing everyone born? 5 year old died recently known underlying issues. would hell way find kid something aware of. seemingly permanent tinnitus bad cold last year. can‚Äôt imagine wat rona does. exactly know testing specific mutation ?

Because they‚Äôre dumbass. found months. Derpa derp. 

Gtfo Switching Facebook's servers supporting infrastructure would actually lead pretty decent reduction energy consumption. terrible say, but... let red dead.

 I'm sorry I've bullied adult many times despicable behavior crimes administration committed, mean law family members hired white house. college student kids kindergarten couple days, tested positive, ordered whole group kids (24 kids age 3-6) tested. None came back positive. student room them, played them, given kids food/water..hell even got picture kid sitting right next him. Basically spent two whole days kids none infected.. strange?? 

I pissed af kindergarten introduced outsider group..but argued students need practical learning..f that..I even found there's law (Norway), given infected get 6months exempt quarantine.. reason know leader sent mail coming back isolation, 6months immunity... add others say, yeah...it law gave 6month immunity, science... couple reasons won‚Äôt happen. First importantly, vaccines tend dangerous / less effective populations. people rely everyone else get vaccine order protected. It‚Äôs easier sequester uniquely high-risk people groups chances first round vaccines won‚Äôt effective enough really minimize risk compromised people. Second, folks tend already avoid risky infection situations therefore less like spreaders disease relative young, healthy people tend congregate frequently larger groups. rather limited human trials Covid vaccines based responses healthy people, that‚Äôs group understand best relation vaccine candidate. makes sense target relatively healthy people hopes able reduce transmission ultimately reduce mortality. Third, it‚Äôs important remember death substantial negative outcome certainly worst. pain, suffering, economic loss someone long-term major health complications greater caused (relatively) quick death. lung transplant patients don‚Äôt live longer additional 5 years counted ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù Covid patients. still require expensive care ultimately dying within years. 

There‚Äôs still lot don‚Äôt understand virus, usually there‚Äôs 5-10 years initial academic research vaccine attempted, completely skipped phase development due urgency virus created. reason reasons mentioned above, we‚Äôll likely see prioritization people likely experience repeated exposure virus rather people health risks. naturally, health care workers first line. Next come healthy adults willing get vaccinated (and *true* phase III trial). point we‚Äôll hope child vaccine data mature enough begin vaccinating kids. need reach ~55-60% population immunity (according traditional formula based average R0) get benefits herd immunity, point outbreaks become easier identify isolate we‚Äôll see return normalcy everyone. Yep, record high Yeah, better chance getting conservative policy goals passed, like Trump lmao Posted another thread too...

Equivalent right around 300k US cases. triple test positivity rate, lot found. logical well thought rebuttal. doubt know anything remote connection medical professionals simply supports argument? valid form debate anything prove point?

When logic discussion fails simply disbelieve it'll true right? honest, case I'd rather stay away grandparents support much can. I'm distancing right kids. want put risk higher risk group anyway. hard though without help, least work home super hard. Without remote office, know would handle. class, tell virus is? Fuck. Also ICU occupation: 85.4% (standard capacity ~6000 beds).

Meanwhile France, mayors defying lockdown orders open ""non-essential stores"" people complaining lost liberty able go book shopping. 40 people infected every month exponential scary. knew second wave coming. Europe knew well... looks like gas station based reflection glass. Confidently incorrect. Wise up, declared irrelevant conclusion. Equivalent right around 300k US cases. triple test positivity rate, lot found. like saying jumping cliff cause die.

Not common sense; we've already proved multiple times historically. forget children literally starving emotionally starving! Yeah public money public health crisis. Government rent control employment active hours food utilities commodities etc etc. semi wartime situation done before. Freedom arguements pure deflection. Stay safe shithole society ask remove it, yell something can't take away freedom wear mask. 'Murica. Correct, complete utter fail worst possible time region(s). Trump lost, still brining US numbers? *Relevant figure ""visual learners"" small screen Denmark full ass lockdown?? neighbours are. Plus new strain virus spreading could jeopardise last 8 months vaccine progress!

We saw happened nations didn‚Äôt take seriously. don‚Äôt want see repeated Lol people care covid I'm (US south) spring vaccine idek society think hope guys okay. Well wishes yours. well, safe. ‚úåüèΩ I‚Äôm phone. That‚Äôs mad blurry. dire consequences missing person school? like they're going feral time it'll take squash spike again. kids still go in-person what? Better NI primary pupils told wear masks. 10-20k new cases day

More like 20-60k. Imagine what's going Europe US full non-mask-wearers we're bad... multiple countries Europe worse. Good, they're essential workers needed frontline. Plus it'll keep mostly safe. read enjoyed Hyperion Dan Simmons recently. sci-fi that's thing, though. Europe also contained virus cases FAR better USA done (barring early leaders outbreak.) Survival fittest... *tl.dr. figure: small screen ""I'm good enough parent help child develop, I'd rather teachers died order make life easier"".

I think that's succinct encapsulates point. No, like China. middle ground. feel like America places way much importance freedom (that's good, but....)and side effect selfishness. one. asinine. Sure ;) Okay, think understand saying. clarify, saying:

1) Vegetarianism feasible sans B12 supplements _in modern times_

OR

2) Vegetarianism _never_ feasible _all history?_

If #1 _absolutely agree._ B12 stripped vegetables due food safety standards need supplementation eggs dairy compensate. earlier comment plants made think ain't point, leads to...

I _strongly disagree_ #2, prior modern civilization, humans animals getting B12 bacteria mixed plant sources. Humans also often vegetarians not, like closest ancestors.

Have good day. freedom exposed crime require everyone carry gun safety. Sounds dumb it‚Äôs said like that, yet that‚Äôs you‚Äôre asking mask. It‚Äôs choice carry gun personal precaution crime. choice wear mask think need one. apologize introducing ideas inconsistent hive mind here. I‚Äôll show door. Ontario disaster. 1k new cases every day low testing. Previous record many restrictions place time well. state red phase time we're still green. We're past point return new hospitalization records even began strict lockdown immediately. Face shields supplements face masks. Without face mask, shield useless... Even 100% people contract virus, see realistic possibility, 1 1000 accurate number.

That would .1% chance. Evidence shown majority population much lower risk death that. ""statistic"" taking account risk different age groups, opinion disingenuous argument.

You discussion personal risk risk society whole, that's different argument, saying everyone .1% chance death inaccurate. latchkey kid 6 years old whenever... 


People act like kids 14 going melt die left home alone. Everyone cell phones, tablets, alexas, webcams etc remotely monitor need be. kid old enough wipe ass, left unattended hours frequent check in's.  


This address kids 6, generally much school ages anyway. Start teaching crotch goblins little responsible guess. 


I'm working office Tues/Thurs/Friday now, kids fine home alone hours. run home lunch, check via video chat frequently, taught basic groundrules. well. told tell gets covid

I don‚Äôt see anyway could turn bad you... depends live. Check states outbreaks/additional waves notice death rates during/after. nothing kids getting sick. spreading it. Kids rarely get ill, problem is, idiots use fact reason keep schools open. realise asymptomatic horrendous they're spreading far wide, killing teachers, parents grandparents can't see coming from. Depends IMO, different types crazy different parts US. recently moved DC late summer rural part neighboring state like two different worlds far mask wearing, distancing, etc. Unless want become really authoritarian draconian like China's government ( literally board quarantiners inside homes)
Then rely people, already seen can't rely huge percentage us.
It is. Oh? shit looked outside recently perchance? People responsible. People reasonable. People caring.

If need government laws would genuinely care never lie cheat steal. People would murder daily legal. 

Our governments almost world around disappearing act crisis put responsibility us. wore masks. distanced. junk, acts major systemic massive problem solved tiny peons. Society never worked way. Big problems require big solutions. 

If want us wear masks need reward punish ensure outcome. Crossing fingers saying wash hands fuck all.

The exclusion tiny handful countries enforce rules significant success. Shocking! IN: water wet Great info. 

IMO data points relative. Meaning data points appear bad places, comparatively. However, mean numbers good.

Also, I'd interested comparison similar population density states/countries similar demographics. delusional think that's people live. privileged people bubble lives. people can't work home, people would get unemployed closed down. Curiously, mostly privileged work home crowd call lockdown. Since anything personally lose it. selfish actually.

I've pretty much everyday since work. workplace hotspot, personally sick either, yet (and unlike I'm actually risk infected). Locking would catastrophical. Yes. painfully obvious *every* country Europe ended number 3, far country managed control virus. I'm really surprised article posted u/supersonicme. posted another highly questionable article comparing Sweden North Korea removed subreddit biased unreliable. That's schools reopen. Schools reopen knowing they're going shut soon someone tests positive, might well never open someone obviously going test positive Simply put - yes. Anyone get adequate exercise higher risk death, disease that.

Kind like smoking - higher risk developing lung cancer.

With said - it‚Äôs death sentence. increase risk trump cancer voted damage beyond term. 

Lot idiots gonna resist another quarantine lockdown. America since founding. rest world didn‚Äôt care back uncolonized wilderness, inhabited natives, subjected American machine. could guessed surprise literally one half brain. mean honestly, need remote possible vaccine. Def crazy! (Not teacher relative is). too. hope vaccine effective enough us get vaccinated able go lives care older family members without worry much getting infected/infecting them. based vaccine companies haven‚Äôt seen enough cases trials release results despite abundance cases US countries trials ongoing I‚Äôm starting think it‚Äôll provide marginal benefit.

And thought 6 months ago vaccine would help reestablish purpose vaccines people‚Äôs minds push antivax movement fringe thing again. fact people alive today seen horrors polio smallpox often blamed rise, thought new virus killing million people would effect. Apparently not. like ""Please leave life alone, thank much"" Macaroni cheese main ingredients mac n cheese Ya Ireland second wave highest level lockdown (pubs, restaurants, non-essential retail, etc.. closed 6 weeks) schools still open. 

It's like people believe Covid spread schools, like school deemed essential. (Colleges online though) frustrating. aren‚Äôt alone. keep telling people rarely careful ones. home. Thats part feels like many don‚Äôt care. lot don‚Äôt, lot still do. Hugs. bit curious business Oh they're aching hear again.

Until Covid democratic hoax. Biden wins, they'll start calling democratic failure. heard scared, switching Heineken  According CDC, [60% adults least one chronic disease, 40% multiple chronic diseases listed page, except Alzheimer's qualify [""underlying conditions"" relevant according CDC. 

Though, wonder 60% includes overweight/obese people well. Probably since % adults (20 older) overweight obesity (i.e. BMI 25) even higher 70%, obesity (BMI 30) prevalence around 40%! true, spread skin. spreads someone touching infected surface touching face. yeah, would say gloves still matter touch something infected touch face wearing gloves, still get infected. washing hands important wearing gloves. Considering schools allow/encourage mask usage classes, accurate enough show danger. skin back, would send nasty review go haha Provide evidence claim please.

Saying Trump responsible 250,000 deaths **not** baseless, reality currently are.

Baseless meaning base reality.

I'll wearing mask able maintain 7-8' apart, I'll sleeping different room.

What want know is, still around house help out? can't help baby figured would probably safe load dishwasher (but unload?), wash laundry, move dryer/unload. figured anything cleaning related okay, since Lysol disinfect surfaces I'm touching.

Is anything avoid doing? 

I want loaf pick slack son. Seriously? Right like reduce guest list move outside something! Preventing overwhelmed healthcare system like stopping bleeding, still stitch wound recover. goal containment. goal save family let house burn down, goals inadequate. Last week read (I can't remember where) Madrid region using antigen tests PCRs, like 2/3 total performed tests. think difference, light localized lockdowns really working. 
You get result 15 minutes prevent : 1.- irresponsible ppl going normal ""they still got result probably cold"", 2.- people getting tested can't / dare miss job two three days without official justified reason. Also make tons antigen tests children, spread schools looks quite controlled.
I mean, apart this, can't see anything else justifies numbers improving soon. depends state live rules follow. One roommates tested positive hard stay isolated room leave obviously go use bathroom across house room get food difficult one else house tested positive. Cool, you‚Äôre American, enjoy 100,000 cases 1,000 dead day, doubling every 3 weeks. you‚Äôre somewhere else look numbers.

It‚Äôs invasion, no-one coming house they‚Äôre checking no-one streets certain time, effect less social gatherings. South America improving, Australia, Israel, Dominican Republic,, etc. yes trend mostly worse Denver Mayor Michael Hancock Friday announced city residents must homes 10 p.m. starting Sunday latest effort slow spread coronavirus. 

Hancock calling mandate ‚Äúhome-by-10‚Äù order. It‚Äôs aimed restricting nighttime gatherings bars, clubs restaurants, well private gatherings.

Denverites covered order must stay homes 5 a.m. day. [effect Nov. though temporarily suspended Thanksgiving. exemptions critical businesses, employees returning home work, first responders people may traveling. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre dangerous path,‚Äù Hancock said news conference Friday. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs another stay-at-home order future unless act urgency.‚Äù 

Hancock public health team sounding alarm weeks rising coronavirus cases hospitalizations Denver. 

Denver, Colorado‚Äôs capital economic hub, following footsteps Pueblo, [which enacted similar last week order slow spread coronavirus southern Colorado. State health officials said curfew could way counties avoid full-blown lockdown like enacted spring.

Bob McDonald, leads Denver Department Public Health Environment, warned Denver‚Äôs hospital capacity could overwhelmed end December current trends continue. 

‚ÄúWe get control,‚Äù said, ‚Äúbut contribute.‚Äù

Asked proof new curfew Denver work, McDonald said restrictions implemented slow virus‚Äô spread sure thing.

‚ÄúIf easy way get done, would already done across country,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúThere guarantees this.‚Äù

The new restrictions Denver come Gov. Jared Polis along Colorado‚Äôs top epidemiologist Thursday warned coronavirus circulating state highest rate since pandemic began.

Polis urged Coloradans spend time people outside households next several weeks. said trend doesn‚Äôt abate, Colorado could become next New York City. 

‚ÄúColorado, love you,‚Äù Polis said. ‚ÄúThis intervention.‚Äù competent federal government would solved issue April. mean... im home time, mean shit me. aim herd immunity"" mean ""we let everyone catch COVID it'll over""

That initially marketed Public Health Agency correct here.

What correct about? Sorry man, part first 4 months. I'm sitting home another year waiting vaccine. wear mask stores stuff, I'm done interacting friends phone. chance show lockdown could work early shown work. Sooo classroom kids picture lead wearing visors actual mask. virus transferred breathing microscopic particles, spitting other's faces, although possibility.

I fault teacher completely wrong. teacher probably say. 

Obviously wrong people making decisions here. 

But maybe leadership fed/state levels created SMART guidelines based scientific evidence, transmission numbers might high.  deaths stand almost six times higher government numbers.

 
About six times reported also before:

The Economist: 


July alone less 6k Covid-deaths. Excess 30k. 


Reuters: 


If death toll 6 times reprted 29,887 covid deaths, Russia got tha 1200 deaths per million. Belgium got 1079. Russia could one hardest hit countries still numbers increasing. I'm sure Danish officials said ""you love see it"" became clear minks spreading new strain, would tried anything drastic without precondition real problem. Nothing planned, (perhaps, given strain still think culling justified regardless Denmark wants mink industry) opportunism. miss overwhelming smell seeping sweaty people crowded train? miss ripe smell surrounding packed concerts? 

Lockdown hard us all, bring back memories BO DIOR. Oh true. Minnesota right now. opened schools Mid-Sept......cases spiked Mid Oct........No official studies yet, assume connected. Got call school district last week staff shortages, kids getting sick, lack resources moving 6-12 online. nursing program went form short meet ups skills labs completely online well, rise cases.  


You can't make shit up......the people stick around greater chances spreading it. INSERT CAPTAIN OBVIOUS IMAGE TRUTH. it. mean liberals fuck supposed teach children ‚Äòadults‚Äô running things never completed science lesson? Yeah, anecdotal personal evidence, like everything else. also personally know lot people one believes COVID fake vaccines masks. yeah, always better blame people baseless accusations. workplace preparing distribution Pfizer vaccine last week November December, dose 28 days later employee. course prepping point ready vaccine arrive, man, thought gives hope. Yea said part first wave. American italics lol. fret much coronavirus going head ;). 
Take care lol feel pain, son get tested told we'd get call 2-3 days well school week school put virtual unless said positive. week called get told results. Well, yes? Schooling started kids would somewhere go parents worked. fairly recently households one parent home majority time. ..... study needed this?

.... People getting PAID tell people this?  confirm. Yet lack research danger reported evidence danger understood readers danger.

For dangerous possibilities, lack evidence lead seeking evidence precautionary action, complacency.  pasta Canadian asking: Americans isolate test positive? far behind guys I'm trying sassy get tattled breaking quarantine sick travelled. social norm certain states well people treat like cold now? Herd immunity means cases low enough hospitals cope well without new lockdowns, COVID gone altogether. Might explain many tv shows movies depicted future 70s/80s/90s everyone another civilization wearing ‚Äúuniform‚Äù.

You know one... usually color tinfoil, kind emblem crest chest, sometimes carrying upside-down fishbowl-styled helmet? woman immunocompromised never developed symptoms COVID-19. They're called ""chicken nuggets"" chickens made üò¢ lot depends kids - I'm saying ten year olds stay themselves, honestly majority given chance, number goes older get. Covid probably took Trump herd immunity. think China aging population want rid of? partly, children go missing come 90% missing children simply misunderstood directions miscommunicated plans, lost, run 100 children ... kidnapped year stereotypical stranger abductions hear news.

[The vast majority actual child kidnapping performed someone child already knows, usually related custody disputes.](http://www.pollyklaas.org/about/national-child-kidnapping.html)

In 2010 census 74,181,467 children age 18 US, assume worst case say 100 children per year 5, that's still 100 20,201,362. talking vanishingly small probabilities, 0.0000049%. 

In US, [it likely child killed car accident kidnapped north Dakota elect someone died Rona? Shits wild yo. swear sub thinks every American work home laptop. It‚Äôs like blue collar jobs don‚Äôt exist God forbid post links factual information internet. 

Doctors get boost every diagnosis say. interesting. two different kinds fur. Netherlands primarily exports mink fur China, return import Chinese-farmed raccoon dog fur. Mink fur much higher quality raccoon dog fur, much suitable fur coats, still popular China (and several countries). Netherlands fur coats rarely sold, coats/jackets fur collar popular. purpose, raccoon dog fur sufficient, cost-efficient enough support larges quantities. 
 
Ironically, raccoon dogs susceptible SARS-CoV-2 minks are. scientists even speculate virus may used raccoon dog, rather pangolin, intermediate species make zoonotic jump bats humans. remember books papers scattering bus hit pothole. allowed backpacks risk school shootings.

I definitely remember waking knowing I'm coming going. Great, let Guinea pig. Tulsa announces today move ice skating rink indoors year..... Damn, Pennsylvania can't enter public store without mask. Restaurants bars excluded. work factory people made wear mask unless supervisor higher. positive covid test result, company stations external company entrance parking lot take temperatures. fever, good go infect people. Aww yiss Wisconsin. leave house go doctor everyone southeast seems masking public. fucking told back August, people. told you. 

Teachers told you. Health experts told you. 

But no, worrying nothing. /s can't fix stupid. people deserve everything bringing onto themselves. Australia closed schools Probably many since moribund already would lived longer quality live would poor. 

Also knew exactly criteria patients counted Sars-Cov-2 positive would start questioning ""the system"". Let explain. 

Let's look example: country practice in, patients died nursing homes. Many did. patients care day 0 career. followed see going living independently home hospitalized hospital practiced transferred adjacent nursing home. health degraded point able live independently home them. chronically ill many terminal (kidney, heart failure, cancer, etc.). Quite lot became moribund would died high likelihood 2020 anyway. many nursing homes 50% patients die within 12 months admittance. Completely independent covid. right that's already pretty solid context show fragile people are. 
  
Then covid hit exploded many nursing homes. fact is, legislature (and know many collegues countries) , 2 patients care institution infected Sars-Cov-2 , residents considered positive. Independently whether PCR carried even symptoms . 6 patients died Covid-19 50% typical signs Covid-19, none tested 50% died illnesses counted statistics anyway due administrative shortcuts. None 3 patients presented Covid-19 symptoms. cause death were: heart-failure twice cancer. 

Everyone needs know significant proportion nursing home patients counted Covid fatalities die Covid-19. 

This addition deprogrammed/cancelled non-covid care massive scandal creating way harm societies term health, life expectancy quality life people could easily treated overshadows 7% people died Covid comorbidity found. 

Finally, let attract anyone's attention fact 7% chance less 1% (overestimate IFR) people died 0,07% actual number people freaking thread. 
I hope aware risk heart attack 30 year old 0,6%. Almost 10x times higher. pets eventually convenient kids go school working hours people? Newsom: Hold ego I'd say honest, I'd also say need better friends.

Personally I've ejected anyone &amp; everyone mindset. Fewer friends perhaps, quality people. Shit got real boys. Exactly. live even safer society people act like child outside teenage range going die. Get grip folks. quit right 4th july I'm remembering fever dream properly. Though, even liberal area mostly half assed first place. exactly. Could agree more- kids remote job working home since mid March- kids limited select friends wife hung 1 couple best friends with- limiting possible exposure- it‚Äôs people don‚Äôt give crap worry Yeah! Space suits men, women children too! journal bleeding obvious. Yes way Clearly actually hospital seeing happening. Even were, doubt intelligence even able comprehend what's happening. hospital pharmacist New York worked first wave, upsetting type people often struggle save ones like ignorant regard others around you. Even worse innocent people spread virus said ignorance. logic reason Dad put ventilator 8 days due COVID doctor got paid $33,000? Fuck off. vaccines almost pre-fusion spike, RBD, mutation majorly impact it. major risk re-infection. 5.6 million least Xmas
(at rate going, maybe worse) water wet. Opening schools irresponsible yet people think hoax. teachers sick dying nonsense. instead spending time summer focused best job possible remote learning, schools concerned sports tryouts. prepared hell bent getting kids physically back school. IMO administrators that‚Äôs pushed charged. No, really? Never would guessed Federal mask mandate? Gee, ya dipshits keep electing people everything help you. virus existed vacuum politics matter.

This rule makes sub worthless.  friend talking recently. happened 90s 8-14 years old parents would've given stack workbooks, told lunchable Capri sun fridge watch TV I'd learned something. one would've thought damn thing it. parents means neglectful. point getting tested takes forever get results? got tested Wednesday nothing yet. told could get results within 4-7 days...my husband got tested months ago (was negative) never contacted results, call them. I'm frustrated scheduled doctor's appointments reschedule maybe Covid, really knows. hand sanitizer sanitizes hands - destroys virus, washed soap water. Gloves destroy virus hand unless changing gloves every time touch something, getting benefit gloves - turning infectious hands infectious gloved hands. Really, really hope includes healthcare students. Med, PA, nursing students directly exposed 'frontline' :/  Wow shocking original comment response someone said children reasonably miss year schooling. attack remote learning whole. sure making lot assumptions feel think even taking time ask me. 

If interested knowing, think middle high schoolers capable online learning circumstances. also believe aim fourth graders younger in-school learning safest extent possible, whether means four one days week class amount time. inclined agree sentiments article. goal get elementary aged students, likely ones fueling pandemic, back classrooms strict regulated manner. 

Students sleeping counterpoint stating ‚Äúresearch shows long-term damage missing school‚Äù schools starting later equate missing school. known students perform best school begins around 10 years course comes complications well feel like whole topic. Giving buddies (but doubters) access records push want say actually kind conspiracies work. hOaX tAkE tRuMp explanation 300k+ excess deaths far US? [*Rational state seeing surge implemented curfew 10 pm - 5 going open schools. almost feels like something elected changed way politicians look virus. I‚Äôm responsible pandemic dude, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth society go like can‚Äôt find solution covid. I‚Äôll wait til vaccine available area, go back normal. vaccine isn‚Äôt effective, think deaths worth people enjoy lives.  current administration basically encourages risky behavior often denies existence virus. Also, people's behavior. current administration pushed people back work kids back school unsafe conditions cases spiking. politicized masks point people refuse wear protect others. said ""just flu"" clearly refused admit spreads aerosols months, prevented businesses workplaces taking proper measures. know exactly new administration going do, know going based science that's good enough me. Nowhere article say everyone experience long‚Äìterm around 10pc 18-49 year-olds rises 22pc 70s according King‚Äôs College London research.

Ten percent 18‚Äì49 recovered cohort. One ten equal everyone. enough people problem.

At risk repeating myself:
1/10 ‚â† 100% current mutations circulating population raise alarm bells antibody resistance know it. fact matter dominant strains ones major circulation. 

Also mutation still vague term. Mutated how? Mutated where? 

Mutations happen time. they‚Äôre insignificant, rarely constitute impression. Every pandemic ends herd immunity. People really know phrase means say ""we aim herd immunity"" mean ""we let everyone catch COVID it'll over"".  Tegnell correct here. 3 kids 10, I'm SAHM therefore used home every day least one kid... them, every day, day *a lot*. chose homeschool year, tough. friends in-person, means playdates, friends tell so-and-so's Halloween party getting together someone else's birthday. garbage. I'm California. tell applicable is.  yet still go back person teaching every day... school week students staff dropping like flies. They‚Äôre school sick get sent home get tested. time test positive, get official superintendent letter saying student ‚Äúcommunity member‚Äù tested positive since haven‚Äôt school x amount days, school close. It‚Äôs bullshit. There‚Äôs ‚Äúextra‚Äù cleaning going building. There‚Äôs cleaning whatsoever. Schools cess pool. doesn‚Äôt help staff members don‚Äôt take seriously respect people‚Äôs health constantly mask down. Except brains voted mail? dont think thats works, US obviously rough place that's we've along. sure might get worse wont dramatic happening france. mention ""lockdown fundamentalists"" actual article. Probably anti-corruption-angels, apparently finally noticed lobbyism landowning nobles Denmark :/ netherlands one biggest players believe  west brabant .. hurt big first wave covid  minky show played like muscians titanic people disobey protect since weasels suits dont care. one goes along say see truly holds power.....the people.

As soon consent dude says lose power. Yeah get mean, also mean swedish legislation totally unprepared crisis scale? Disease X already framed 2018 work hypothesis started much earlier. Sweden prepare something like this?
How situation can't mitigate restrictive hard change laws? seems like Sweden's neighboring countries better prepared this?

Edit: looking swedish newspapers now, everything US elections, affiliate-shit-ads, ps5 reviews, useless celebrity news, finally see something coronavirus.

The Nordic newspapers currently writes new article every new person dies died. different Sweden doing

Does Sweden care all?

Edit 2: continue dovnwote campaigning swedes let everyone see ridiculous reddiotoers pretends scientiest, precisely. initially downvoted decided check post history. comment seems character so-to-speak (I could completely wrong lol), okay? much expect new record everyday 
I swear Nantes, difficult know lockdown. one care . Yea, unfair compare two. Europe wave 2 devasting clear first wave. US still fucking first wave. way true. ü§™ MWGA :O Good you. Agreed  way. Congregating spreads virus. someone thought exposed millions children teachers potentially deadly virus. Oh wait...

Im bitter! You‚Äôre bitter! Oh, interesting. bad, assumed missed zero, clearly number reported elsewhere. Weird. found netherlands huge concerning minky bussiness .. poland overtake minky shizzle .. really watch Totally Control. know downvoted. Covid 20x deadly seasonal flu, nearly deadly second wave 1918 flu. sincerely hope change. farmers continuing extort government. 

They demand money else continue break isolation stop authorities attempt put mink down. 

üëè Grocery stores closing early since March. Even Wal-Mart closes 10. Yeah big problem lot people terms weight want pretend obese means 650lb people tv can't physically get bed. I'm teacher opening. love people tell accuse *gasp* worrying myself. Yes. worried. five FEMA mobile morgues delivered recently handle overflow dead bodies. Guys, time lock down. much want happen wonder implement this, think can‚Äôt.

They‚Äôd federal officers enforcing it. don‚Äôt Democrats get Covid? Wow got sweet downvotes here. point damage done Trump poisoned base anti-mask anti-science rhetoric. believe Biden policy make meaningful change happens Covid US point. envision policy negative effect people resist whatever says.

Tl;dr-we're f\*cked Biden may able control much hurts. knew smallpox bad, damn, really *is* terrifying. Without wanting downplay what's currently going on, really puts current predicament perspective! Thank response. France, Finland Netherlands hot either 2200+ cases per 100k.

That can't right. Finland 17k cases total population 5.5 million, bit 300 per 100k. want understand problem, look parents 15:15 outside schools. whats bad russia? Cases dont seem rising fast? Got graphs? That's shady fuck lol. Start fall quarter get students sign leases, cancel rest year. Hmm..... Sith deals absolutes. must admit looking doubtful danish government successful containing Cluster 5 strain. 

Although chief police said wants mink put within one week, continues farmers attempt extort government, staying homes refusing let animals put down.

I hope get charged least reckless endangerment really allowed go way far. one find age ranges grade levels? environment kindergartner goes school in, vastly different one 12th grader. So, really need studies involve numbers k-3 4-7 &amp; 8-12. Cases rising NY Lol want first big party too. üòÇ 70 million morons go burn masks. Fasten seat belts. Good. vote Zorb balls every man, woman, child. tragic them. genuinely can't decide whether enforcing mandated masks less important lives citizens, that's hard choice make, let sacrifice funding. saying keeping thousands animals cramped conditions hundreds generations might unintended consequences Big chains franchises, real estate companies first &amp; restaurants second that's they're much resilient disruptions &amp; afford adapt.

I really really want Demolition Man future Taco Bell/KFC/Pizza Hut/YUM! might ""fusion cuisine"" over. think death count would actually adopted herd immunity strategy beginning much worse would compared now? Maybe try non-essentials first pls  like : ""8 employees (gas station name) found dead homes unknown causes.""( seems like death ""unknown causes"" covid denier states saying someone dies home covid) Open em Oh clearly not. followed closely exactly things happened. Testing policy changed massively several times. interesting indicators ignored time well. 
Also virus behaves like coronaviruses third wave January/February way worse. 
Funnily US cases lagging behind european cases exactly time interval first wave. Like, parties kosher May... so.

I‚Äôm hoping wedding one first parties people go relatively carefree becomes massive, memorable drunken event all.. much fianc√©‚Äôs chagrin lol. fat opera attending divas get sick says Putin. Yes. given. face highest virus exposures rest us need healthy working. wait turn couple months means healthcare worker get vaccine earlier. even give families earlier. contagious 70 days dangerous even showing symptoms herself. news, water wet.   setting records daily. reckless time wedding. would laugh face anyone inviting wedding now. dealing fat tail distribution risk, got aggressive. there's 99% chance everything's fine, 1% chance second pandemic vaccines work well on, really use excessive force possible. small country unfortunately thousand farmers harmed. ""global lockdown"" whatever. bring hammer small, honestly that's protocol new diseases pandemic potential. smashed SARS1. Imagine China smashed SARS-2 time instead fuckin around covering first. Could saved millions lives.  talk normal going back school.  Part decision home school kids Ages 9,8,6,4,4,2. homeschool probably normal thing could them. hybrid class sporadically start stopping outbreaks kids masks day something didn‚Äôt want endure. duty station year also big factor.  social benifit going school negated protection measures. quality education (at fault teachers) virtual learning young kids abysmal.  separate note aren‚Äôt religious don‚Äôt homeschool that. crazy love big traveling Navy family. mean populations without resistance smallpox (like Native Americans) absolutely decimated, difficult know many died possible vast majority populations died years. estimates 90% fatality rates...truly terrifying

Even populations smallpox circulating centuries awful fatality rates it. think people realize terrible diseases vaccines contained eliminated them. Don‚Äôt forget undercounting actual cases x10 x20. idea much undercounting hope you‚Äôre right, too! Ive also super careful hopeful older relatives able take vaccine want one younger friends fam decide want come! feeling everyone ready parties spring :) That‚Äôs 98,000 tests. Still concerning percent positivity, shows need adequate testing get fuller picture infection rates. :) Looks like half country's trying see Jesus personally. think experts working states like Switzerland, France Netherlands arent able handle that?

Give break. start building? where? what? friend's wedding Sunday, dangerous going wedding wear mask time? gonna closed space. Thanks dude, too! might wrong, would (direct) democracy works point time people decided this. swiss proud ways observer aside seems like working fine.

now, might missed entirely, seem referendum this.

from perspective, really see less democratic comparison country.

as free move out, absolutely agree. using argument really cool. i'm supposed citizen i'll probably become one. also, lot think like do, matter color passports :) That‚Äôs horrible [the dutch actually phasing mink countries poland china. china 0 worries about, poland troubling problem is: Mask protect others like keep others safe playing OK Corral mall. Exactly. ""war panic"" need waged again. see anyone panicking virus anyway. people bought extra food case quarantine two weeks. Big deal.

Yeah online people like ""holy shit we're fucked"" that's actual panic. Hey fellow Hospital Pharmacist. 

From Alberta, Canada confirm patients see worst ignorant ones acting like life going normal. 

It‚Äôs almost like viral load thing we‚Äôve known decades see neighbors, people over, masks, social distancing... We‚Äôre 60. Mostly friends, family. 

I‚Äôm going worried older family members get vaccine especially it‚Äôs available general public then... seemingly be.

As careful person always wearing mask now, I‚Äôm pretty sure things point next May wedding able cool party without worrying.

Hope I‚Äôm right! fucking dystopian still due Sturgis rally? Increasingly, norm get tested. solves problems asked about. wet markets chicken pig factory farming alone not. suddenly everyone get tested many people go, enough tests anymore, symptomatic people get tested policy change. 

You go 5k cases 15k 12k (15k 12k). situation seems stable first glance. Meanwhile: might loss contact tracing, positivity rate goes 5% 4,7% 9%. 

This happened Switzerland, France Netherlands huge fuck-up lead epidemic getting control again. right Another lockdown would great point seeing we're easily breaking 100k+ cases daily U.S. one white house even batting eye.

The bigger issue society messed people literally can't survive lockdown disrespectful a-holes may desperate keep roof heads food table.

Land free ass. New Zealand: worlds backup disc.

New Zealand repository knowledge mankind. Got find salt mine fast. 

So mind actually this. local New Zealand townie goes arbitrarily deletes things deemed unimportant. LOL! Respectfully, thought happen?  Um. expect happen? half country suddenly come Jesus?  El Paso County Judge issued two week shut order El Paso county due rising COVID cases. Restaurants sued TX AG intervened saying Abbot‚Äôs order supersedes CJ‚Äôs order requested temporary restraining order. County Attorney‚Äôs Office argued CJ authority implement order judge agreed. CJ‚Äôs order stays place TRO denied. Well, sequenced many samples seem spread. seems resistant neutralizing antibodies, may may affect vaccine efficacy. affected area restrictions, mink culled. Denmark health authorities closely following issue. 

With news coming today, I'm definitely worried this. potential escape mutants worry me. Netherlands already minks infected months ago? already mutated infect mink spreading NL since then?

One slight correction coronavirus causes COVID-19 humans human-only virus. mutate infect cats dogs minks animals. version infects humans infects lots animals fine. 

It may well mutation also spread humans Dutch mink farms well, perhaps mutation significant enough notice cause concern (just natural mutations occur human populations without mutations significant enough make discernable impact virus' behaviour). went 0 60 dude saying France x amount infections. care much lol took us 283 days go 1 case 9 million. took 7 days go 10 million. Water wet happiness ranking stupid arbitary number. Happiness subjective, even define something that‚Äôs subjective. said ""kids resilient"" sent way, that's malpractice. Thanks man good lucküíØ cousin got great please stay.  Interesting take incoming infections part widespread outbreak nearly every county America. Clearly shut flights countries. argument Mexicans Canadians reason can‚Äôt less 120k infections day? concerned impoverished vulnerable, getting fucked eternal remote learning. Meanwhile, kid fine forever home - help every day.

Public school helps impoverished vulnerable escape poverty. We've shut entirely nearly year. kids live older parents grandparents? Older teacher? older people everyone would interact community? people people would interact with?

The spread infectious disease mapped web. want control it, need stop spread largest nodes. know every respiratory pathogen ever studied schools massive source infection, first thing closed back spring.

You cannot keep open hope contain virus. civil? heard Tegnell sith. know Texans, American, reddit taught anything, Texas Florida sh!t-c!nt states America. election over, go away. Curious....if able contract covid 2ce....will vaccine effective you? understanding large proportion people recovered functionally immune body could quickly rebuild antibodies necessary fight virus? pb, used meat eater too. Fully understand. parents willing accept 25% chance kid it, despite aware parents carry gene one kid it. maybe receive genetic counseling understand risks. Also, expensive kids way, need eliminate one parent equation, finding sperm donor probably good.

I'm totally though. time travelled year 1994 username baffles me. Yeah, fair balanced urban African Americans? Turning Canadian football league fix now. agree, smittskyddslag prepared situation, Sweden seemed be, even logistically, worse prepared neighbours. Now, historically, one could blame a, perhabs, ""peaceful"" existence (no war since 1815, three neighbours share national crises WW2, Russia Threat etc.) even structurally societal Sweden different neighbours. law without doubts something changed, wont easily quickly done. 

About news, dont know ones looked at, locally saw lot coronavirus, countrywide topics. And, since follow German Norwegian news lot, tell exactly patterm. Vienna, Paris US election pushed Coronavirus far compared three weeks ago (in case VG.no, ZEIT.de and, proposed ""temporarily pandemic law"". democratic mills grinding slowly. Shame figured comments pointless, wonder long take you. lucky accommodate this... many people can't.

Schools need stay open every effort done keep things safe be. argument younger childrens. older classes, count. Teens upward discipline focus alone home online lessons. not, school problem parents cant handle teens minimum.

That removing useless lessons. Focus important grades strange times...

For fuck sake im adult, apprenticeship need go days per week ""technical"" school. fucking need, example, religion risk health everybody alternatives exist... Ontario schools [aren't well got million-dollar experimental treatment can't get even cash. haircuts 

Yes, millions Americans protested various political reasons, whether BLM nationwide protests election fraud protests reasons. Thanks, America, spreading covid.

edit: notice i'm getting downvotes called people out. mink industry unnecessary

I agree mink industry finish, normally take furs mink November anyway, seems foolish so. bit ironic Stockholm Syndrome everywhere world except Stockholm.......... I'm 135lbs max weight. mostly love meat...any kind meat. Plus animal proteins complete proteins source multiple sources...one stop shop. So, thanks response ut I'll politely pass it. Wait, whole state 1900 tests? point idk tell republican. Refuse lockdown also refusing wear mask social distance. 

I get lockdown bad econ yall atleast mask correctly then? saves lives. No, conspiracy, wear them. Ohio, Florida North  im anti fur, negative consequences far outstrip benefits.

there could species. people (about 80%) recover disease without needing special treatment, majority ‚Äì especially children young adults ‚Äì illness due COVID-19 generally minor. However, people cause serious illness.

Around 1 every 5 people infected COVID-19 develop difficulty breathing require hospital care. People aged 60 years, people underlying medical conditions diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease hypertension among greater 20% need hospital intervention survive. 

This hurts pre-existing conditions. us 40% population living one ore-existing conditions

Get - think really meant ""conservatives stop pretending care 3rd"". say that, agree points either

Everything balance risks, yes would ultimately safe one sense kept kids school safe vaccine/treatment developed. would cost terms lives life chances? could another year we're unlucky.

Again I'm saying schools worth risks sectors keep open long humanly possible. likely local psychopath kid considers semi deadly traps raison d'etre.

At shortly 11am today November 6 think Nancy Pelosi speech TV news cut started talking actions Trump may take Biden inaugurated. said something Trump intending make people health care insecure, housing insecure food insecure. TV new anchor interrupted say Trump could Biden wins.

The ""good"" thing number cases region increased slower week last. still hope! Let repeat you: supposedly wrong nothing abilities physician.

She working Sweden since 2013.  Apparently, something suddenly wrong working Sweden several years. week, we're looking economic damage wrought coronavirus France. many one million people could plunged poverty pandemic. Charities also impacted. One reason older people often volunteer, many avoiding social situations since risk. French government announced measures help need, charity organisers say help reaching right people. speak Christophe Devys, president Alerte collective, group 35 anti-poverty charities. even ignorant initially portrayed. 

Your ""ehhh, theyre fur farms"" portrays lack compassion. 

You also pathetically lacking reading comprehension skills.

I wish death *anyone*. stated *worthiness*. thing, would know capable critical thinking. I'll assume Republican Trump voter, since lack compassion critical thinking much traits.

Blocking because, speaking unworthiness, worth time energy. mean Roach Motel strategy bad idea????


Who could known? /s Wawawewa ""When temperatures *drop* miraculously go away."" /s Healthcare workers hospital staff high risk catching, spreading, virus, given close regular contact infected. Eliminating transmission equation way vaccine effectively make rest us safer removing vector together. UK BSE arose. Perhaps haven‚Äôt seen data lately. comment simple great. 

Many people get this. They're like ""well really fat old sure good go"". decided follow France schools still open. always focus bettering nation unrealistic expect huge societal changes span months years. schools function safe place children many get positive adult reinforcement. like pandemic like too. 

I never stated ‚Äújust re-open schools send kids back‚Äù. putting words mouth. said absolutely entertain idea children missing year school finding ways implement in-school teaching, extent depending specific circumstances school children, safest ways possible elementary school students.

Lock devos me. weekend Memorial Day first weekend bars reopened parts state went bar went boating. done ""social distancing"" still respected wanted keep social distancing. begrudgingly sent mine back weeks ago wife wanted see friends. 

We unenrolled shes homeschool couldnt send back remote in-person numbers went nuts. title matches article, article misleading accurately summarize study itself. [Here article Lancet looked schools. cases control. Basic, yet I've seen studies it, I've following studies religiously.

Usually something effect ""5% cases traced schools"", contradict study since many children likely asymptomatic therefore tested. kid got sick one class did, might incorrectly deduce got elsewhere.

The low percentage cases traced schools frequently touted justification keeping schools open. Let repeat you: unemployed physician Sweden, something wrong COVID related. mean crack drug, meant crack pressure lockdown puts mentally üòÇ sorry I'll edit make sense! first thought well, Taiwan sounding alarm January stepping mask production, downplaying it. Taiwan total 500 cases 7 deaths, preventing community transmission stopping virus tracks early response, without single case local transmission since April. I'll take right Fauci takes it. then.

This may seem stupid trust anything coming administration. ""Study finds"" need study something obvious. feel like America one great Monty Python sketch. Indeed. new cases found cluster 5 since September, found North Jutland. 
 
The head SSI also said cellular immunity appear affected. like said, vaccines might hindered (and 12 people long recovered). Exactly. people want others miserable are. hope people find peace lives. Duhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Whats alternative? keep kids school put education jeopardy? We've already disrupted education earlier year keeping school harm good. school long periods time risk poorer kids falling behind lost generation. kids generally safer covid.

Also hospitality industry closed still bring cases Obesity official risk group begins. standard overweight.

(Edit: lot America indeed obese though) Amazing, living America, easily say beautiful thing I've seen. news sucks, fact see government officials stating facts without bias pointing fingers. fact blame themselves. Even language that's foreign makes perfect sense. Thank this, breath fresh air. hope lost. 1. evidence spread past outside Denmark. 

2. 12 patients recovered. 

3. recent press conference addressed concerns spike protein mutation ~ don‚Äôt believe effect vaccine efforts almost every current candidate produces stronger immune responses normal infection. 

What scientists concerned mutation. conclusively still variant Covid 19. don‚Äôt want thing mutating create entirely different viral code rendering vaccines useless. That‚Äôs problem road, they‚Äôre nipping prevent that. 

Basically, mutation nothing worry about. let run rampant, ~may~ issue distant future.

Edit: fact checking important! know it‚Äôs fun doom posting spreading misinformation panic irresponsible. obsession never leaving child alone insane. country crows loudly personal responsibility, seem absolutely phobic instilling children they're adults need independent. Feels counterproductive. Governments want adults go work economy doesnt shrink. kids stay home, means 1 parent would forced stay home. closing schools, could potentially lose 20-30% workforce.

That's logic.

Do know else shrink economy? control pandemic. know this, people making decisions dont actually care. It‚Äôs still early. thing still careful NY. It‚Äôs absolutely horrific many people died Florida. hope doesn‚Äôt skyrocket nothing done prevent contain anything except accurate numbers. 

Edit way assuming numbers correct: that‚Äôs 63 people per million Florida 63/729 = 0.08641. 8% deaths per million. It‚Äôs insignificant. reopening would lot worse. Oh bummer. three flights dog she‚Äôs it. get it. Hugs. happen able afford highly recommend porch potty type setup (if u balcony etc). Greatly reduced amount times take dog saved sanity (its quite stressful sometimes people rarely anyone mask giving space etc). is. can‚Äôt run it. can‚Äôt lock down. someone infamously said, is. 2 weeks going see happens take entire republican population feed ~500 rooms.

Besides vaccine? need prevent possibility healthcare system collapsing, healthcare workers need first. People hospitalized elderly immunocompromised. also need cut vectors transmission.

Neat. weather colder, find masks actually kind convenient. fogs glasses bit, face much toastier I'm outdoors. Ok. Prove it. thinks. Country thousand deaths day bad. Wait catch up. [Seems that: Mapping/tracking variants ‚â† containment. vaccines seem cause immediate side effects like fever, chills, etc. people signing trials probably generally concerned health believe pandemic, wear masks, etc. people got placebo may put 2 2 together realized probably got placebo get fever, chills, etc. means probably continuing take extensive precautions. vaccine works well, people vaccine group probably getting infected either. could reason results taking longer come in. vaccines work, would likely get results faster work capacity.

edit *IN possible infer herd immunity strategy.

‚ÄùL√•t smittspridning ske, l√•ngsamt eller fort, f√∂r att uppn√• en hypotetisk 'herd immunity'.‚Äù Peet T√ºll's exact quote. Whereupon Tegnell answered ""that's strategy decided (we walked decided 3).""

I'm inferring thing. That's actual content correspondence. Yeah, way people dress fur satisfy vital needs warmth, doesnt mean totally unnecessary people actually use animals needs. sure actually understand petty sake losing discussion. lied people saying safe... suckers believed it.. like said masks necessary back March common sense told us otherwise. U-M students tell university getting money in-person classes resume. Wow. *surprised Pikachu face  wait. year, schools back back allowing kids school Tdap vaccination behind month. kids fully vaccinated everything recommend. submit vaccination records one year (just forgot), kids got sent home. like WTF. latest vaccination records date. warning, ""they can't come school records"". Yet now, midst pandemic, they'll let anyone everyone without vaccination available. Literally said trust Fauci I'll take right does.

I place faith him. I'm also New York, experience mask usage high. school district fully virtual currently working phased reopening. districts area open hybrid model masks required. case numbers surged area either. population immunity works like faucet stream water gets less powerful time people infected, we're also like week two away getting results Pfizer's vaccine month away Moderna Oxford. far hopeless. actually think majority 7 8 year olds stay home day motivated navigate schoolwork? We've seen tons responses parents saying kids motivated online school there. Exponential, say? change constitution two votes parliament election between.

You're Coronavirus sub ffs - know this, earth upvoting nonsense?

We're 6000 thing changed schools open. can't true. Tegnell Sweden always says ""schools *drive* pandemic"". Well good, honestly, make happier.

With said, legitimately, I'm antivax, swear lol, trust anything Trump, period. dude could pour glass water I'd look sideways. EU? administration rush vaccines? They've already started rolling review vaccines, FDA not. also restarted trials FDA took weeks longer.  Good them. Political peer pressure used justification lockdowns. Also sun causes sunlight, study finds.   rushed sense happened quickly due money resources made available researchers. actual process different vaccine. anti-vax attitude shared many result deaths. me

 I'm asking would call Tegnell's ""we walked decided option 3 i.e. ""allow infection spread, slowly quickly, achieve hypothetical 'herd immunity'""? Infections placebo group exactly you‚Äôd hope though effectiveness measured difference number infections groups. 

But maybe you‚Äôre right shouldn‚Äôt drawing many conclusions yet. Perhaps kind people signed trial kind people careful avoid infection companies cautious, instance. don‚Äôt like watching videos though. watch videos, unless you‚Äôre taking notes questions, they‚Äôre going get answered. classes mostly watch videos, zooms 10 mins ‚Äúdoes anyone need help‚Äù ‚Äúno‚Äù ‚Äúokay bye guess‚Äù  Pretty sure conspiracy theorists saying would Nov 4. happened? know many would lived longer gotten covid? Come Poland, it! Total deaths still bad trend terrible! üôÅ mentioned above, USA taking distance learning / blended learning approach. Absolute shock. 

When get sick something kid, call parents kid‚Äôs best friend see have. strep throat what. lo behold, sick crap. 

Through kids get diseases people circle have. 

And probably gets even worse parents go work, interact people (as everyone work home), kids connected like thousand people. gas station small town privately owned says article. That's pretty much sentiment rural Iowa. Hopefully. Unfortunately, probably lost handful good, experienced educators along way. many teachers completely abandoned careers year, want sent front line dangerous situation. Funny mention Alberta . . .

We're wrong! Open up!

Subreddit week: care European countries shutting one another, people given up! We're opening up!

Yeah no, what's happening Europe happen trend, people laid low virus. shit. teach(ed) even wore bubble suit everyday I‚Äôd still probably manage get sick.

or maybe nutjobs watch tube conspiracy channel. don‚Äôt really know. It‚Äôs easy guess that‚Äôd case, it‚Äôs easy numbers. Everyone grasp 1k deaths day. 

But think years lost, long term effects missed schooling, missed vaccine programs (these tend close lockdown), screenings cancer similar - well could end losing years locking everything hard. Lost school years lead lower life expectancy, lower expected lifetime wage, higher crime rates overall less healthy population. Unfortunately numbers easy calculate value ‚Äú1k died today‚Äù. We‚Äôve also got consider many dying covid end life, whereas kids beginning. valued exactly same?

Make mistake, long term effects covid (other virus itself) could end huge. definitely case looking issues time. We‚Äôve got minimize spread covid, done minimizing harm done society long term. I'm gonna take wild guess Paris gonna cost 10 grand month stay open closure. Let Democrats wear masks, let conservatives contract virus, voter base slowly dwindles....

A lot pushback measures based personal national economy, makeup sales, masks affect economy. Pushing people wear masks protect economy seems like easy win. shit Sherlock Seemed obvious laughable. commonly see people misevaluate odds easily-calculated events... even see odds pre-calculated experts published. industry... call lottery.

Everyone's risk contracting covid approaching 100% next couple years. Near-certainty.

And know odds death somewhere region 1-in-1000. idea many 1-in-1000 events personally experienced life, hysterical right now. expand loved ones close friends rather yourself, odds someone know care dying it...

guess another lie Singaporean here, correction, end lockdown previous anti-disease measure inadequate, discovered increasing number untraceable community spread hidden massive clusters migrant dormitories.

The lockdown circuit breaker government calls it, soft reset reduce number cases buy time mitigation strategies, never strong intent lockdown eliminate virus completely due nature virus.

We failed contain properly start use honour system residents visitors came infected countries quarantine themselves. implement testing/quarantine orders people Europe time Europe look like new COVID 19 hotspot. failed protect migrant workers lived tight quarters. encourage mask wearing beginning.

But one part agree possible, continue ""normal"" least minimal disrupted economic life time control virus. requires public government proactive trusting other, fine balance.

Regarding privacy, easier residents living wealthy Asian countries give digital privacy government, generally trusting government would protect data leaking, understanding health crisis (This first coronavirus outbreak us, Korea experienced MERS, experienced SARS) understand greater good, lastly used autocratic measures well Singapore, Taiwan South Korea quite autocratic generation ago. laughable.

Edit: feeding, feeling Breaking news putting thousands kids school pandemic create rise cases! woulda thunk it? remember data supposed available end October, November. hold breath December. bust PPP scamsters along small potatoes? makes sense. Include people lowered number cases lockdown least measures, warmer weather outdoor activities kids school would explain difference. understand hesitation. Remember, it‚Äôs novel virus lot info mis info. say we‚Äôre living Stephen King novel little dramatic though. Covid definitely dangerous, people aren‚Äôt collapsing street we‚Äôre getting by. We‚Äôll fine.  Again, crowds (at international airports)?

In event, contribution epidemic can, best, characterized ‚Äúa fart space‚Äù.  mean, say cases masked people ones get sick despite prolonged exposure super spreader. top head, Korean Starbucks super spreader event one.  Putting place safety measures related international travel one best solutions (reducing international travel activity better, unrealistic), considering long-term risk-management potential epidemics/pandemics. Fast long-distance travel increased massively, sadly think that's something countries eventually raise barriers against. Pathogens exposed evolutionary pressure incubation periods matching transit time. Covid-19 first pandemic perfectly fit international travel patterns. nonessential border crossings people need minimised. Freight fine. Also, closure need 100%, shutting nonessential travel reduce cross border transmission perhaps 99%. Ug. guess vaccine hope now. rough thing say. 

Like medically globally speaking; yes. socially regionally; no. 

I don‚Äôt think intrusive thing daily life much past spring 2021. don‚Äôt see happening. How? get meat cant get foods? Oooh, see *this* going well conspiracy crowd.

Nobody sits around fucking Garden Center eight hours day breathing barely recirculated air. 

If go bakery get food, minutes masked breathing much potential viral load. eight fucking hours next product entire community. 

Your child issues parents child apparently can't grasp simple concepts. feel bad kid, parents incapable rational thought far damaging E-learning. fucking shit. moderator subreddit trying argue schools help drive pandemic anecdotal evidence super outdated information. Exactly always compares total lockdown terms cost .

The amount money total lockdown costs incredible also many businesses going permanently destroyed . Sixth largest Texas, 700k city, 845k metro area (not including 1.25 million across border Juarez). So, really call El Paso ""small town"". Yeah understand either. They're animals, culling save human lives money means support.  schools support people situations, even fully remote learning. 5-15% kids I've seen heard parents. told hear 3rd. Except still is.  People bad evaluating risks. understand numbers. I've saying months. protective policies businesses also put place mean dick virus creeping schools. offering single story. experience different invalidate either. 

You speak students everywhere. mentioned students alone would invalidate statement immediately. Higher, yes, dramatically higher. Thank God. 10pm 6am. think they‚Äôll survive. community chosen accept virus part daily lives then? like living limbo like this. wish people would act prevent spread, rather embracing it. Problem MInks convinced go testing, that's killed em. ""Gee, one could predicted this,"" said, massive amount sarcasm. Baseless propaganda saying 250k leads deaths Trump taken action liking. Remember Science predicted millions deaths US alone actions reduced 90% What?... study see much SARS-CoV-2 spread population distinct PCR positive tests hope took samples age groups, since study yet out, trust numbers. Officially, yeah, number real infections six times larger diagnosed ones according that, jury still well designed atudy (since think actually published anything).

edit: typo Wow embarrassing! Good making right call. China serious 'house arrest'. know disease long term impacts him. reason 1918 killed many people 20s people infected russian flu early 1900s weakened immune system enough let spanish flu finish job.

And kids died virus before. risk lower, zero risk. capitalist society anything disposable. Wow. would‚Äôve thought? would prove Tegnell wrong, ain't that. confirm. Lol! Exactly! obvious us non scientists happened. Biden wins case count drop. ploy smear Trump make people vote Democrat. me. think years lost 

Better everyone ""losing"" couple years life thousands unnecessary long term effects missed schooling 

Which better thousands unnecessary missed vaccine programs \[...\] screenings cancer similar 

Which see tied in-person Lost school years lead lower life expectancy 

Contracting covid too, much lower life lower expected lifetime wage 

Not really case since everyone kind situation (and already advantage wage higher crime rates 

Which mostly tied wages US already high crime rates related income inequality, couple years lockdown cause unexpected crime wage, least much income inequality problem (that exists completely apart less healthy population 

Yeah, know what's less healthy? Contracting We‚Äôve also got consider many dying covid end life, whereas kids beginning 

Stop fucking repeating lie ""kids die covid kids going school"". First, kids die covid, even fewer, unnecessary child deaths. second, children contact much people (even due in-person schooling) people contract covid child may much bigger risk.

Stay safe, smart. Interesting thread. hope get answers things day. circumstances pretty damn sketchy. There's really two outcomes:

People take virus seriously infection controlled.

People take virus seriously, health system crippled, people start dying like Wuhan '19. places could afford take seriously like Asia/Europe, rest turn India/Latin America.

No one thinks afford lockdown, threat makes so. Lockdowns coming, we're wealthy enough. anyone participated Johnson Johnson/Janssen (Ensemble, Ad26.COV2.S) vaccine trial? getting injection (placebo vaccine) next week would like get antibody tested weeks. anyone else done this? long wait get tested? Replies private messages would greatly appreciated! I‚Äôm genuinely trying conversation seem angry I‚Äôm curious see leads. seems like maybe disagree reducing risk means, maybe call reducing risk (because nothing ever perfect) call extreme measures. Neither us talked specifics though, think there‚Äôs confusion. So, attempt reset...

What think coronavirus? think differs think doing? reddit they're stupid enough risk chronic illness (loss taste/smell ex) them. hope reject get protected faster. People frustrating tendency believe risk bad outcome actually happens them. news, sky still blue grass green I'm starting understand one ""every man himself, I-got-mine"" kinda people. hope grow it. Yup. Hang buddy. Chuck Goodrich dr. McNinja? wonder children wear face shields like that. 2019 Romania's population 19.4 mil. 4.6% around 900k. people health issues routine checks period 2 months. Usually count people 30 here. percentage higher.

In October Romania 140k official covid cases.
Even government correct estimation 4.6 (i think so), still 6 times infected official number Lmao yeah. I‚Äôd fine idiots. get last priority need go hospital Covid. people don‚Äôt wear masks rudest motherfuckers I‚Äôve ever seen dude. It‚Äôs crazy selfish stupid assholes are. makes even mad end catching Covid going one maskless fucks. haven‚Äôt spent time friends irl long, occasionally gf‚Äôs brother something comes that‚Äôs it. agree! I'm saying I'm lockdown mask-wearing etc, medical details reported fit understanding Covid I'd really like information find is.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like arranging plans designated driver go out‚Äù Far worse anticipated who? imperial college model anticipated 100 000 deaths June actions taken (no actions taken). hard lockdown would imposed, best case scenario 30000 deaths June. number 6000 would mentioned shit started hit fan, would deemed outrageously optimistic. 

The swedish mathematician Tom Britton modeled 8000-20000 deaths ridiculed optimistic views (I think talking whole year, shit might still optimistic - knows). Yeah easy take risks like endangers someone else's life instead own. Mean incubation period 5 days ‚ÄúStudy finds‚Äù shit Sherlock
Whoever thought putting kids back school instead sticking online learning year needs get head ass. Pronto. district went back September. Hybrid full virtual middle school high school, full face face elementary. Every days get text school saying there‚Äôs positive case.

While it‚Äôs mentally worst us, I‚Äôm glad decided full virtual boys. NO. SHIT. Want Slo-Mo? also makes question tight lockdown really, paper.

I originally hail Italy I'm quite informed matter. indeed rough, likely harshest one world Wuhan's. People take individual walks around block middle night fear getting caught police car passing by. Movement trends also show absolute collapse mid-March onwards. Back April infamous incident two police cars chasing drones fining random lone guy sunbathing deserted beach became symbol police's overly harsh stance: hard overstate control spread Lombardy early March. think would ever able bring cases milder lockdown.

Italy blamed bad luck beginning first Western country get hit. think ever blamed bad luck getting deeper mess (and did, wrong).

Don't get wrong, claiming Italy bad luck - far it. I'm *very deeply* critical Italy's whole management this. implement measures sub publicizes necessary sufficient contain spread, enough.

Generally speaking, luck one factors. Australia NZ lucky smart enough make use luck. Others, US, lucky - good geographic position, ready-to-be-applied pandemic plan, huge tech capabilities, timing advantage compared Europe - completely threw luck garbage. really see way could go even if, responsibility take care myself, demand expenses. one county Washington State, public health official said workplace outbreaks tracked back original school infection. sending kids school led many workplace outbreaks adults, susceptible dangers COVID infections. response real actions taken person ignore push SPECULATION another.

Makes sense, screw false positivity inject baseless propaganda.

You learn critical thinking kid school LAUSD. They‚Äôre home. option in-person instruction. figure they‚Äôll behind curriculum advantage still alive. hear alive big plus comes university admissions. Remember Walmart closed TURNED FEMA DEATH CAMP...or NUMBERS BACK HIGHWAY SIGNS DENOTE SPECIAL BACKWARDS ROUTES CAMPZ...


They really brightest lamps office. used deaths follow less week infection spikes, 2 weeks it‚Äôs month behind? standardize metric actually look data instead hoping death spike prove right Nobody could've predicted /s Hmm yes appears floor made floor. That‚Äôs pathetic. Jesus. Go read [my post lots ways work around problem too. Trump administration chose none (and actively work schools did). Fuck fur market. dangers factory farming chickens pigs, well wet markets, better stop shit next pandemic guaranteed. I, one, *shocked*. That's meant, sorry That's partly due less testing. yeah compare cases per 100k European countries we're 6th worst country. Belgium, Czechia, Armenia, Montenegro, Luxembourg cases per 100k exceeding 3100k. US 9.7M cases 331M population so, 2930 per 100k.

You look cases per 100k 53 European countries basically like one worst European nations much larger population. 

The US cases per 100k calculated (it's 9.7/331 *100k). 9.7 million 331M Google. yes rounded nearest million.

Spain, France, Finland Netherlands hot either 2200+ cases per 100k. Ntm states currently skyrocketing like UK.

On terms new cases UK amd US sky rocketed 36.5~37 cases per 100k per day respectively (also drop rounding) Yeah, sad see lose. 

Big silver lining though: Everyone even slightly na√Øve: ""Yea, SHIT"". Esp hilarious agree ask stance wider educational inequality existed prior pandemic, brains short circuit. Says person wants school back session. right expose family disease think special. End discussion. North Dakota done...anything? may looking severe reduction population. They‚Äôve shot 11th highest Covid death rate country. I've written post probably 20 times since May. HARD come with. fact testament incompetently, negligently, perhaps nefariously Trump administration course, plan like never going implemented trump stock market like it.

What stock market likes stability. stock market fantastic predicting future (though generally know predicting already happened). I'm confident that's market mostly since election; pricing fact Biden going President, likely bring level normalcy back Washington (keep mind, probably already pricing first month two 2021, transition takes over). thanks catching shit would wear mask in, simply find out. Extremely curious mental gymnastics required actually post sign like this. Aw that‚Äôs unfortunate it‚Äôs ruining Christmas guys. Stay healthy! hahaha, really need study figure out? value people based give society US, that's fine, talking conditions USA, half country filled morons reject science fact-based reality, caused hundreds thousands preventable deaths due criminal negligence. mask wearing prevent needless death despair somehow fucking political issue. Pandemic Special! I‚Äôve trying tell people! Vegans also get what‚Äôs necessary live, would die younger meat eaters. don‚Äôt, ask again, get meat can‚Äôt get foods? I've walked places. told one place went instead business. happy live seeing PSA's tv wearing masks months. Supposedly new strain antigens vaccines designed target. I've read I'm sure true. also came certain reports cluster 5 spreading outside Denmark simply mistaken.

Until notice really reason believe hinder kind end pandemic consequences. could you? Tegnell said multiple times strategy? /s Okay.. hope doesn‚Äôt effect vaccine seems like gateway privacy, home family trump right life health, really.

I'm sure tell differently right privacy, home, family affecting right life health. remember 2012 election season, (then future-) FIL talking FEMA preparing mass-graves stuff case Obama won, going kill us all.

Anyways, never happened. Phrasing least workers fighting back. bad majority can't take stand Naaah, really? Would never guessed intelligent enough accept it. afraid many moron antivax refuse pandemic keep spreading Well duh doy Probably, much. Sadly, Biden pretty explicit implementing national lockdown mask mandate. basically wants encourage states slightly better position Trump Pence pushed late feel like, put trust states. states simply legislative willingness introduce restrictions, governors enough authority enforce executive orders restrictions populations enough willingness follow recommendations.

Its going top mandated approach sadly, likely come Biden, least according suggested far.  Did... forget test Aspirin now? facts are, last known case variant found September known cases since. minks culled speak prevent future mutation. 

All all; reason panic now. love people forget mention absolute fuckups government Victoria‚Äôs lockdown. endless 2 week extensions, fines, rights stripped away, everything happened Melbourne towers god awful. Don‚Äôt pretend like easy. 15 week lockdown, strictest world. states othered ostracized Victorians. 

Cases never get 0 US, there‚Äôs many people. State borders can‚Äôt easily closed, Australia island nation. apples rock comparison. Trump. Oxford England, Pfizer partnered German company named BioNTech said using administration's distribution channels, even Moderna existed several years Trump received assloads OWS money speed development. money Trump paying taxes. (OWS ~~is~~ one policies ~~approve~~ approved of.) BREAKING NEWS!

Stupid decision is, fact, Stupid! Something necessary survive people living wild past isnt vital. probably look word means. US hit grim milestone 10M positive coronavirus cases. crazy.
It take long end 20M improvements made. Yes totally show good capability contain virus single geographic area. mutation course, mutate similar way taking consideration potentially bad. hard questions, right asking parents choose working supervise kids, supervising kids working anyway, sending school. None good options people can't afford work. Yeah. Likely like 3k Vietnam locked hard, twice say they'll never get tired winning Like anti maskers go lol  us, yard anymore (moved new city back apartment life), parks crowded aggressive non-maskers walk straight towards even actively change direction. like cartoon..
So stay inside watch county's numbers stay hundreds daily. County, even full state. everyone wore masks kept polite distance, we'd kiddo outside time like March. Sigh.. masks required junior school kids strictly banned (in school least). Apparently kids would fidget something. Strange kids seem manage everywhere else world. SSI, institute heads testing, clearly stated (on press meetings 4, 5 6 Nov) new variant extent reduces effect antibodies, vaccines would probability still work.

True, probably find every single case, DK already testing one world's highest rates among positives they're also sequencing one world's highest rates. So, likely cases missed, unlikely many widespread country region.

Indeed, they're even sure variant still around none found thousands samples Oct. Nov. sequenced ([Danish upped testing cases sequenced; still around it'll discovered.

Anyway, they're extra cautious taking chances. much prefer approach taking chances. That's also they're closing entire mink industry; allowed continue fear future mutation could problematic. also hope countries significant mink industry take notice; countries appear sequence rate DK one might fear mutations could go unnoticed mink farms elsewhere. Merde! Deaths know of... need lot capital start production. see many schools giant aerosol threat well. Canada, airtight often use boilers heat buildings lack HVAC open able windows.

Nah answer one comment chains. Pick one stay it. fuck would thought that? mentioned equally important FDA's decision prevent outside lab working COVID test CDC developing theirs. Many outside labs working COVID tests could get FDA approval Seattle Flu Study, example, ran covertly old samples prove COVID entered country anyone thought. should! risked lives care Americans, regardless race, religion, political affiliation - including people thought hoax got would fines. Jail certainly answer. remember smacking head awake bus hit pothole? Ooh, waking up, seeing dark, idea way \*to\* school \*from\* school. help advanced program highschool, top commuting school (for program) like 45 min away. shit sherlock Also evidence won't. Yep. Everything's bigger Texas ü§† Im point believe people infecting purpose get antibodies time celebrate holidays loved ones. may shock find weather climate much consistent predictable impact human behavior. Data different countries time period same, therefore climate zones hemispheres cancel other.

Instead trying condescending, put effort understanding issue. Take country Brazil example. covid dynamics followed seasonal flu southern hemisphere t. opposite true countries northern hemisphere. virus spreads faster autumn winter, slows summer. Human activity barely registers (except skewing case numbers vast shifts amount testing), judging similar results countries different approaches.

Schools open Sweden 11 weeks. surge cases, model predicts, four weeks (in fact cases went down). none eight weeks. increase started 10 weeks later, because, pay attention now, autumn came along. model rag paper would take seasonality account, would associate increase schools, despite grossly distorted time window.

I could get data correct model including seasonality, frankly better things do, even reply much. good day. know exactly are. wish best Haha aye man people really don‚Äôt know they‚Äôre talking fr, like virus instantly mutate range antibody recognize it

I mean shit sometimes don‚Äôt either reason care much study medicine interested vaccine development get point, really think masks social distancing entire life better getting sick times. Personally, it‚Äôs even close worth me. 3000+ rate... remember incorrectly. tries ambush certain infamous paper ferguson. paper made distinction supression strategy ment aiming R(t) one. pointed time Sweden R(t) 1.

I also remember us gratifying discussion certain mustelidae. discussion somewhat prophetic due ""Danish Situation"" re: Mutated Mink-Coronavirus 2020. Oh god really??!!! could‚Äôve ever known? Sounds like order really put lid thing shut things tight, even though lot people want hear that. Wow really? young kids home remote learning much guilt. They're learning much going better expected, make effort socialize regularly busy trying help time. I've feeling guilty kids missing additional stimulation would get class. 

This makes feel bit better. Virus care who's office. See, that‚Äôs thing- don‚Äôt social distance go bars, still go grocery stores gas stations, inevitably impact people social distancing. people still go grocery store too. 

I‚Äôm aware pandemic fatigue affecting many us, it‚Äôs affecting too. It‚Äôs logic flawed.

Edit: saying specifically, terms general population. Moreso people absolutely care social distancing FORWARD! numbers see 17014 residents 210 non residents.. skew around 1.2%. sure worth florida inventing methods avoid, I'd rather follow standards tbh Germany's help might needed

Pssssh, sane talk, tolerate around here!!  put district back online learning. also like ""I like government telling do!"" realize paying taxes, obeying traffic laws, etc literally government told do? holy shit. mask. Death rate increase winter temperature drops people's immunity drops. describe economic tax enslavement. wont provide protections since see disposable.

The Federal reserve control currency national debt tool indentured servitude.

There legitimate reason federal reserve (private bank) charge us debt paid decades tax hikes treasury granted powers mint money debt free begin with.

The national debt cheapens dollar's spending power inflation time interest barely touched taxes. principle loans jist gets worse.

Now trillions sunk sinking titanic last months raised national debt 23 trillion 27 trillion.

Serfs.....they see us cattle class. expendable workforce.....and know farming kids next wave human resources school. Teaching enough work keeping stupid enough never rise up.

Thomas Jefferson huge proponent public education......but clear taught.

They never teach things really work would say fuck that. Read article getting disheartened: 

 

"" happen large percentage population immunized, doctors see form fewer COVID-19 tests returned positive results ‚Äî¬†‚Äúmonths months months‚Äù start public vaccination campaign. ""

 

It's saying, day vaccine available mean everyone magically instantly get vaccine. take time get large enough percentage population make effective. really new news, nothing unusual. expect people support system like grandparents, kids can't work home aside lose jobs?

Keep car crack window little. Faster anticipated. Yay. Cute clip! answer made change view Sweden's strategy (i.e. allowing slow spread), obstinately claimed PHA working day night stop virus contact tracing (which seem part plan seeing Tegnell answered option number 3 2 \[contact tracing quarantining\]). Covid-19 supposed go away election.


Trump Biden need concede Kanye already.   Fema death camps making comeback huh? correct error still wrong haha. article must updated new title. posted populated directly article. Yeah, happened today. 10,010,677 according worldometers. High schoolers definitely stay home get that... noting group vaccine getting infected draw process since placebo group would getting infected. need hit 35 infections unblind trial, it‚Äôs going take longer placebo group infected.

You also make good point signing trial possibly cautious. UK headed back shutdowns quarantine due spike cases. submission removed because


**Titles must edited source.** submissions must submitted original title submitted article applicable. article uses caps title, changed [title Editorialization via title editing kind likely removed. ([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* increased somewhat curve start slowing end November, December terrible. mean these? Germany 800 nursery schools observed past months. kid gotten Corona. kinda.. kids rarely get rarely pass others. kindergarten elementary school opened, teenagers young adults stay home online school. bunch people quarantine due someone interviewed positive ... Wow. know /s Another thing changed weather. reason second wave fall predicted since spring, schools, it‚Äôs weather. 

Add fact Sweden, Finland Norway held schools open these, studies able conclude schools driving (Norway released new one today actually). 

But absolutely, schools driving definitely closed. evidence severely lacking though (at least talking smaller kids). likely hood happening minimal especially considering state really known farm mink even relatively conditions rural Utah. isolated. Rural areas, history speaking, almost never epicenter kind exponential spread. 

Also no, don‚Äôt think understand evidence means. Evidence current collective information make assumptions. mean: need information opinion, respect statement. best governments/epidemiologists knowledge, example human human transmission would really make much sense spread beyond farms.

Edit; also forgot one important detail! cases appeared back August/September known cases since. I‚Äôm inclined believe it‚Äôs contained. Well, looks like Mexico going build wall all....and canada. read article, makes sense. really saying, moment vaccine comes mean everyone country immediately get shot. take time distribute large portion population, whatever critical mass is, still risk. sort hyperbolic headline. 675,000 dead USA Spanish flu 2+ years.

We risking vast groups teachers, especially staff, parents free daycare. 

As parent, job figure out. us, means watch/teach someone else's kids pay someone else watch mine. let's honest, care/schooling kid gets $250/week hell lot less give people work $800. sucks literally makes feel shitty parent, gotta do. Hes safe, healthy well cared roof food. However, red ded schools stay open. Can't fucking wait till get vaccine? also let bottom line bit more. 

I pneumonia before, got death's door. telltale symptoms. fevers spiking. coughing. Nothing. went able breathe one morning, gasping breath end day heart palpitations. still able breathe ER oxygenation levels read 78 (normal 98-100) trying figure hell wrong me. need oxygen hit low 60s went white sheet. 

I've diagnosed Influenza years later, symptoms aside aching limbs. felt crummy, could point cough, fever, etc. went GP ""fatigue"", tested strep (negative) flu (positive) flu season, office routinely tested anyone coming sick. Imagine that. 

Some people exhibit textbook symptoms. Nonetheless, diagnosed Covid? Clearly plenty detected. Arrest Tegnell Man need fucking vaccine, day 5 covid, almost brunt it! No, aspirin before. thing back then, CDC (Or WHO, forgot) said wasn‚Äôt recommended.

...I guess is? Researchers said findings account variations preventative measures implemented schools

Seems like big part studied. Current data Massachusetts shows schools source transmission. think properly masked, distanced, ventilated, schools safe person learning. Honestly, different 9/11 regard. Bin laden might dead patriot act department homeland security security measures enacted alive well. 

Except instead due action foreign power, wound entirely self-inflicted. could HAZMAT suits.. Tons people know would volunteer get vaccine first lets completely eschew pandemic restrictions. insane queues get vaccine (or virtual queues scheduled online), even whole anti-vax movement. seriously believe numbers 10x they've reported, still somehow hidden? also believe welded people apartments used barbaric tactics suppress virus, somehow tactics also work, even though strict lesser tactics worked Vietnam, NZ, Australia?

It make sense anymore. wouldn‚Äôt damn strain fucking implied original comment. sucks. I‚Äôm sorry. got tested asked 10 year old safe house me. told long hug, kiss her, close contact would fine. dont know true doctor idiot. department positive covid test 8 weeks work never shut anything spraying computers. material handlers. touch everything every department including equipment made come work sick. never got virus. Hope helps. sure? city (Manaus) verge second wave, India cases trending afford second lockdown though? economy exactly well before... Also, face shield nothing fucking disease trap own. Wear fucking mask. Mask free house alone, sure everyone wore mask would gone tomorrow /s 20-30% form immunity mass vaccination done.

Would feasible use antibody tests vaccinating someone save doses? allow remote learning state without doctor's note. downplaying importance teaching mean come across way.

My Mom taught 30+ years, last 10 even need to, loved it.

She hung hat year. chances state‚Äôs shutting again? Specifically California. WATER FUCKING WET

But nah bunching children whose bodies immune systems even close done developing totally result worsening pandemic. neighborhood high school closed 2 weeks 40 plus person outbreak. Every week get calls middle elementary school kids attend notifying us case (or cases) COVID. may protocols follow school people careful away school. attending parties get togethers. People still went trick treating. hopeful might able send kids back spring think end virtual whole school year know people going get together holidays. gonna bad (or say worse). Scumbags paper made distinction supression strategy ment aiming R(t) one. pointed time Sweden R(t) 1.

And aiming suppression strategy allow slow spread achieve hypothetical 'herd immunity'‚Äù? work again?

You really, really set Sweden strategy suppression referred webpages said ""help us **stop** virus"" said **stop** proof allowing slow spread (which argument along).  need national strategy. Letting one state spread disease good neighbors. already worked India Brazil: cases/deaths rapidly falling despite lax measures. Herd immunity happen eventually nothing. fully expect millions normally risk-averse people celebrate outcome election large groups. Bars urban areas packed gills weekend. ....why need study this? Shhh, boxwine housewives need Franzia hour. Sorry, rate trying force social distancing us another year. I'm waiting long neither people.  Well I'm Denmark, right near border area that's extra locked think pretty good plan contain it, even still exists. Everyone quite aware situation mass testing excellent trustworthy. aggressive contact tracing quarantine plans. need shutdowns, they're ready it.

SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S)-reactive antibodies detectable flow cytometry-based method SARS-CoV-2-uninfected individuals particularly prevalent children adolescents. predominantly IgG class targeted S2 subunit. contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection induced higher titers SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive IgG antibodies, targeting S1 S2 subunits, concomitant IgM IgA antibodies, lasting throughout observation period. Notably, SARS-CoV-2-uninfected donor sera exhibited specific neutralizing activity SARS-CoV-2 SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes. Distinguishing preexisting de novo immunity critical understanding susceptibility natural course SARS-CoV-2 infection. democracy work. people decided lockdown, lockdown happening. EU/EEA citizen free move locked state prefer different type policy. Actually considering could make seem like much higher jump yesterday's figure 363 deaths compared 800 today yesterday's figure hospitals death. France reports nursing home deaths twice week twice week death toll includes abit backlog ""We're ideas tried nothing"" confirm least personal experience.

I immediate family members close friends who, along myself, trial.

We super cautious aware (but still go safe settings). anti-maskers bunch though.

I seen couple homeless people trial site, many health workers, think aware trials seeking information get pretty date info.

It‚Äôs like going bars recruiting always going out, don‚Äôt think folks really looking participate anyway. teacher, depressing realization COVID. remember ‚Äúheroes‚Äù back March. Now, we‚Äôre back babysitters. afraid many moron antivax refuse pandemic keep spreading

They get sick. People going want social distance happens. Well tell exactly that. Gee, surprise. Another Captain Obvious. 

This really tiresome.  anyone thinkthat numbers go election said done? numbers Houston control.  F know much Nunavut. Nunavut incredibly hard place diseases spread sparsely populated place country. Travel hard well highways lead territory. enter Nunavut either plane boat shut exceptions early on. community infected located island Hudson Bay roughly 100 KM coast Western Quebec. way community plane either cities Montreal Winnipeg, currently hotspots. hereby claim space suit every man woman child. Numbers way opened schools. Yes people caring anymore contributing, huge ass spike schools.

Have grand parents agree super strict mutual 2 week lockdown let kids go stay overnight. might tail! People keep saying stuff like backing random outlier cases don‚Äôt really show trend. know twenty people got covid house party LA they‚Äôve recovered fine. majority infected covid fine. already year since pandemic started enough time SARS-CoV-2 pick 20~30 nucleotide mutations. wonder Thanksgiving Christmas? Going school person ""normal"" though.

I know live, me, kids sitting desks 6 feet apart day, social distancing recess, hands activities. Fine Arts still taught video lesson, teachers going classroom classroom would expose entire school. normal school Kids stay home should. would clear space can't. schools many measures place feasible. Every jurisdiction different rules, even kids going swap masks bestie whatever think rules ages. Even imperfect mask use better none all.

The fact gotten far also massive failure plan accordingly. Almost nowhere government use summer plan covid still problem fall. Scrambling late think segment school mix home person school meant best solutions unavailable. [Check Pfizer vaccine? Lol wat  Well, confusion here!
What done then???? direction comment takes pretty unclear me. think broader point trying make closing schools fucks poor families hardest. many kids rely schools meal. many kids single parent full custody normally full-time job.  nobody's fault pandemic itself. Thanks article, though Poland. talking US.

That said, following situation Poland last couple weeks. can't believe amount misinformation. People claiming Drs paid misdiagnose COVID-19, really flu, PCR tests work, people wear masks washing hands. deaths far lower claimed.

Here's misinformation 

Is Polish Alex Jones? much influence have?

The article posted says there's deaths Poland officially reported, believe possible. government made complete mess it. think everyone thread agrees way, crazy lot people *don't believe currently way.* reality lot people. Can't rule people don'tvwant ruled.

The public always outnumber cops. Heck, ecen many cops refusing tobenforce plague measures. redditors read article, forget correlation causation (which apparently includes whoever wrote article's ‚ÄúWe found increase R reopening schools clear whether increase attributable specific age groups, may substantial differences adherence social distancing measures within outside classrooms,‚Äù said Harish Nair, professor paediatric infectious diseases University Edinburgh. ‚ÄúFurthermore, data needed understand specific role schools increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission robust contact tracing."" daughter got tested 4 days ago results came back negative, yet still told quarantine 14 days. fiance says new CDC guidelines people taking longer get sick. parents got tested 2 weeks ago got negative results told quarantine remainder ther 14 days. parents narcissistic liars dont know ignored tell me. anyone else told quarantine getting negative test result? front office said would send message doctor see type quarantine habit, habit taking 1-2 weeks get back me. information would greatly appreciated. Thanks stay safe! kids come in, spaced far apart, given computers, remote learning school. Basically teaching assistants act baby sitters two three kids space. elementary grades also spread kids across high school classrooms well. six month old mystery?

Have caught anyone? way incorrect, supported statement made SSI (the institute responsible monitoring disease) F√∏devarestyrelsen (the government body responsible monitoring mink farms).

According SSI, based limited number known cases, disease causes appears similar ""ordinary"" C-19. Swedens cumulative death rate similar US worst. US destroyed economy future couple generations get result Sweden without locking down. Lockdown proponents don‚Äôt want admit lockdown ruined economy divided country nothing. boss got fine. twenty people house party went said they‚Äôve recovered well. majority people recover covid fine. doesn‚Äôt mean shouldn‚Äôt still follow science take every precaution can. anecdotal outliers that. I'm sure much harder citizens Fayette County, Iowa, gas station entire county. Try go somewhere else driving extra 20 miles. Agreed. 

But also need consider teachers support staff often poorly ventilated rooms 10-30 children going good wearing masks. Editorial, Amanda Sokolnicki

**Tegnell aimed herd immunity - said something else**

&amp;#x200B;

**Tegnell denied strategy herd immunity.** exchange emails March shows something completely different, explain himself.

&amp;#x200B;

The Swedish strategy differ much countries. heard several times recent months, ministers state epidemiologist.

That deviate neighboring countries markedly - terms number deaths extent restrictions - downplayed, explained quality care elderly. despite fact experts neighboring countries pointed factors make countries different, specifically much spread allowed society.

When United Kingdom short period chose aim gaining herd immunity widespread proliferation, state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell spoke interest decision. outwardly, consistently denied Sweden doing. most, considered side effect.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem true. excerpt **Johan Anderberg's forthcoming book ""The Flock"",** tells conversations beginning pandemic sounded (SvD 5/11). several experts early explained Tegnell way underestimated happen - dismissed it.

&amp;#x200B;

And sounded Peet T√ºll, used state epidemiologist's duties head National Board Health Welfare, exchanged emails Tegnell Sweden do.

&amp;#x200B;

T√ºll explains mid-March sees three possible options fighting virus: shut society total month, track many infected people possible quarantine them, allow ""infection spread, slowly rapidly, achieve hypothetical 'herd immunity' ‚Äù. T√ºll advocates second variant. Investing herd immunity would headless resigned, explains. would lead thousands deaths.

**Tegnell replies: ""Well, walked landed 3.""**

&amp;#x200B;

**The state epidemiologist authority thus chose early invest herd immunity strategy.** time, persistently explained case.

&amp;#x200B;

This authority treat citizens.

""It's sacrificing lot people gain immunity. **This model one passable "", says Tegnell** gets comment information SvD.

And no, course Public Health Agency acted destroy people. course, ambition protect population. honest - judge something citizens bear hear - actually unacceptable.

&amp;#x200B;

When much stake, crucial information cannot withheld risks criticized. particular, authority done great job - unlike decision-makers countries - trusts people make wise decisions get right information.

&amp;#x200B;

**That model one passable course true either, less countries chose paths.**

Now question also arises: government understood this? PM Stefan L√∂fven understood truthfulness Tegnell's reassuring words herd immunity agenda all?

The government actively chosen stand back corona management, declaring experts responsible decisions. model work, presupposes country's management actually understands decisions made.

And tell citizens. coronavirus reddit, interested discussing rediquette. Water also wet Omega 3 might useful. Give example Biden Covid policy going change behavior Americans. school district says covid-19 spread schools. work Massachusetts. want get sick covid, ever. entire life, thanks. want get sick covid either might infect family. Otherwise, go ahead get sick must. desert island. Like totally dead island monkeys deserve get infected either. question rhetorical

Neither mine. choices make right now. one hand, likelihood go hospital low, hand extreme tail end probability includes dead parents. TELL IT. seriously, fundamental social weakness. lead three, also think best one, successful potential fighting future disease. Yess!!

Inject veins is, unfortunstely.

Hopefully OSHA something Biden idk.  lol OSHA nothing Trump administration. Another failure hurts us all. poor family 100% going get hassled anti-covid morons.. Yeah, longer sit room, spread pathogens air. Blocking airflow one direction means nothing air infectious. are. Meanwhile Denmark 350k tests per week problem

450k last week.

88k yesterday.\*

\* Sweden one week per capita. shockingly expensive probably pretty unpleasant earth gravity. Think highly advanced version old brass leather diving suits. horrifying amazing able create solution. hope kept outfitting grew... salute work impossible situation face daily. hurts consider many children live every day. sound like person I'd love get coffee - someone rational enough see sides issue! reddit!?? Gasp! God help children Republicans. Surprised Pikachu Anything torturing animals also found China scale.
Luckily, one country keep infection rate near zero. addition, MERS SARS could relatively easily contained people becoming infectious time presented symptoms. afaik. lack a/pre-symptomatic spread major difference previous viruses SARS-CoV-2, makes people shed virus several days start presenting first symptoms (if all) - feature makes virus much insidious difficult monitor/control. 
I'm sure biologically possible/feasible virus exhibit kind rampant viral behavior combination 10-30% fatality rate (so basically coronavirus behaving like smallpox), mere thought ""worst worlds"" scenario quite terrifying. thought pandemic supposed today.  fuck around fat tail distributions describing growth pattern Russia ‚Äúhyper-exponential,‚Äù don‚Äôt recall learning school look up. Instead sharp curve it‚Äôs nearly vertical line.

We never conceived anything worse exponential growth could possible. It‚Äôs already happening. üò≠ Republican turnout. They're really sticking libs COVID.

I guess stop taking granted, because... know, take granted, want wear mask. Absolutely. boyfriend live Texas started easing restrictions early, said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going get COVID won‚Äôt even fault‚Äù. still continued social distance (and work home well), don‚Äôt want unknowingly expose others. mental health suffered much, cannot say mental health important someone else‚Äôs life. 

It‚Äôs hard everyone. It‚Äôs harder mothers, husbands, children, etc lost someone virus. want fishbowl kind honest hallmark adulthood ability postpone gratification. I'm saying is, could happen mink farms. 3rd wild strain. secondary school, kids relaxed more, eventually got huge wave close bubbles. Kids still don‚Äôt wear masks, despite repeatedly telling a) midsummer spike actually went much higher april (increased testing accounts that)

b) fall spike already 3 X April, much homogeneously distributed predicted.  heard ""It's late baby late..."" Fawk shit. Reeeeeaaaaaaaalllllllllyyy scientist works molecular biology right , exactly kind incompetence causes undermines people‚Äôs trust one says 210? Sorry took top result get #

~10% definitely issue 1 *looks Wuhan*

Can f-ing please right? noble, childishly stupid. Heres need. Shut everything down, 100%. Ghost town entire country. leave house, receive massive fine first offense prison time second. government gives EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN $3,000 per month stimulus. 1 year. 

I see option. wrong her? Checking back in. try argue stupid. understand unfortunately. I'm confused, people think anything else gonna happen? would putting children together room sending home families probably go shop work anything increase spread? one family gets corona child sent school symptoms set in, gets whole class whole school sick aswell, kids go home get families sick, rinse repeat. actual fuck anyone expect anything else??? Genuinly asking. thats case complaints do, don't. know one exactly would think anti-vax nurse would like. man, wish good way infuse people empathy way hate fear. done properly enough testing tracing, clusters able identified scaling back what's open community spread gets down. theory prevent sort full statewide lockdown depends control let get. Eliminating aids would require dropping reproductive rate 1 everywhere world very, sustained period. Without vaccine achieve herd immunity seems incredibly unlikely. familiar person. nominate someone title ""Polish Alex Jones"", would probably either Janusz Korwin-Mikke Grzegorz Braun, though former better description would ""crazier version Ron Paul"". videos talking absolute garbage coronavirus parliament's pulpit (both MPs) hundreds thousands views. Add jetpacks I'm in.  Thank Covid Thank you. think panicked. 29 million people live Texas, true means 1 every 29 people have/had it. Crazy ""We look viral evolution, create biosecurity around farms like contact back human populations. address issues. But, right now, evidence suggest variant way different way behaves,""

Very serious situation they‚Äôre looking bio security measures right now. needs nipped aim moment plus they‚Äôre looking deep mutation would ruin efforts

Right now: inconclusive keep eye continue safe ever No, would not. get counted cases even infected. get it. 
Switzerland massive mortality elderly homes first wave. Globally people died first trimester 6 months 2020 compared earlier years. Id honestly say accept guilt this. tough everyone responsible choice choose option avoids contact children available situation.

For people crummy country, simply available option anything send kids school. take issue that. want option available folks since options available since dont legislators willing implement UBI.

The people feel guilty ones well enough options still choose send kids school, increasing risk kids option.

I totally understand sentiment kids missing socializing society strong tendency digitalize relationships is. I'm saying thats good thing, fact bad. keeping kids remote anything different gigantic majority country already chooses stay contact - phones. far it‚Äôs control. Theres lot testing notice less 2% tests positive. numbers low compared neighboring countries tracing efficient. time case found contact tracing shut sometimes entire schools etc. think we‚Äôll ok! 

How big yours? Iowa went Trump, right? best brains. Duh!!! Agreed. Faceshields alone. mean people understand breathing works, right? Might depend timing. it‚Äôs true antibodies wane (3-4?) months immunity relies t-cell response, antibody tests might wholly effective catching everyone it. T-cell tests would, expensive take time.

I could wrong though. There‚Äôs much info anymore it‚Äôs hard keeping straight. Oh what?! Really?!?

No. Fucking. Shit.

As took study figure shit out.  You‚Äôre one knows caught it. asymptomatic version still alive well. I'm glad include support personnel too. person cleans floors might health worker, still hospital around infected. Maybe sometimes higher risk given proper PPE Fair enough boring conversation anyhow. Many people listening staying inside wearing masks everyday. I‚Äôm one them. also May 2021 wedding crossing fingers things improve then. postponed last May. ü§ûüèº read Denmark 40% world's mink-farm population. means Denmark's actions alone reduce worldwide risk 40%. know Utah lot mink farms, Netherlands. idea else are. assuming lockdown nothing. Yes, 17k died far lockdown, masks, social distancing, etc. 

The logic ""see? 17k dead. need lockdown?"" almost laughable people saying ""the flu kills people per year covid"" back April covid barely started take hold US. Non-vegan here... 

I see problems this... 

Carry on.. Closed schools still providing food, least required state.

Poor families fucked every single way look it. school less funding begin with, teachers usually ""lower quality"" overworked, parents stressed, kids stressed.

This one thing gets thrown us teachers tbh, there's already way effing much shoulders, telling us risk family's lives teach right much.


FYI, teacher, district hybrid. see 180 kids week enough time warrant quarantining test positive. sucks. see less terrible farming live animal.  may different case case basis, state test positive need back work 10 days later (instead 14) negative test required returning work. Last heard bosses also required inform employees they've exposed  Exactly. That's separates us  Bout time, eh. Whats Lizard Lick Repo? would thought sending students educational settings might present perfect storm hundreds even thousands young individuals different households likely asymptomatic even think get tested would raise transmission rates? crammed one roof poorly ventilated buildings 8 hours day 5 days week little way rule enforcement. fucking mystery anyone believes scenario might major driver covid. Well...........yeah kids like hugs thought narrative Sweden success story vanished, here‚Äôs reading talking lessons learned interested: love kids, love sharing things, would loved least one cruel given current circumstances (and also given nature life - good things happen always end badly - plus, believe afterlife, pointless me, that's another topic).
I cannot stop people children, lots unfortunately. worry, antinatalists ever enough influence change anything regarding global population.

And would surprised, think life great despite bad things happened me. However, know worse come : death loved ones, diseases, old age early death. still want inflict human being. condoms. Oh god don‚Äôt mask mandate. They‚Äôre join Poland hell armed guards keeping new people way beyond overwhelmed hospitals. vein said bicep true all. twisty twisty words. energy I'd go discussions quote you, time right now. Phoenix, Arizona schools repeatedly stating kids school, let us know get program. go charter even students. Guess see happens hundreds mink farms world zero mink infections. Pointing Utah.

Denmark probably place. shit ? realz?? 2 weeks now:

‚ÄúBusiness posted mask required sign, closed. employees test positive Covid - 19.‚Äù Beginning school age 6 instead 5 advantageous United States children usually come good socioeconomic backgrounds, parents engage home, often get additional year preschool. child misses random year schooling parents busy ignorant help keep reading math skills learned year before? 

I think going see privileged students succeed move far ahead, less privileged students fall behind pandemic over.  order close grocery stores 10 PM? not, imagine need shopping late hassled. stupid ""evidence"" transfer to/from little kids several months ago.

We seeing low rates transmissions kids go take them, home. charli xcx already released i'm feeling may luv x Deltoid... Right! house suburb, local playground almost always kids around. times boys went masks on, kids made fun keep distance (little shits!). kids stay home, time. 

Meanwhile county's cases 200's daily hoslitals city 90% capacity. Like really people?!

Also, next school district over, 22 23 elementary middle schools outbreaks (and closing). 

It's baffling. No, making mountains molehills difference. strain mutated coronavirus, prompted Denmark cull entire herd mink, however found 12 people five mink farms far.

In words, mutation causing concern, 12 already mentioned.

Not great title given conclusions people jump w/r/t content. America beautiful.....   condition limited US. Pandemic fatigue hitting pretty much everywhere. find ""lockdown connoisseur"" tbh. covid research expected make advances medicine applicable outside covid, everything highly specific? I've worked home last 5 years myself, I'm 28 kids.

I'm sales industry struggled lot. homeless without sitm definitely could used one.  read created loophole Spring (which expired) enable closure restaurants, schools etc. Can't again? mean...*yeah*. rational people thought *wouldn't* result? go Worldometers compare US states cases per million compare countries, North Dakota highest rate infection world. beat Andorra number one today. South Dakota #3 US states make 20 top 30 worst regions. Winter coming. Jon Snow? Easy theatrics Absurd? Wtf man. really can‚Äôt think anything short lockdown? never advocated lockdown. 
They restrict restaurants bars much more. lower limits events. give stricter ‚Äòadvice‚Äô many many things. finally advise mask wearing. tons things do.  kid sitting seat away 3 different lessons positive test. never officially notified school. Every country locked surges cases. Lockdowns work forever.  failed everywhere ended. Appreciate positivity :) originally around 200, willing cut it‚Äôs safe enough family. not, micro wedding postpone big celebration again. you? Instead giving bailout checks everyone.. people finically fine get none used pay wages people cannot go remote, lockdown complete. tech worker office years. think software engineers need computer internet connection.

(EDIT: wanted past tense) That's succinct assessment. think fatifue poignant week Christmas onward, first vaccines may rolled healthcare workers many restrictions relaxed allow economy profit holiday season shopping rush. New Year, people stop caring social distancing part many businesses readily submit third closure non-essential businesses. case, December January interesting months restrictions compliance them. Take upvote that. Yes hes fine next week fall break got it. something else wasnt covid. kids definitely worried catching since they're person classes state currently red zone. definitely scary time. I'm sick always apocalyptic bent everything

That sick alter reality. 

Too bad. decide 10pm? difference make? appears wait January 21st Tres bien argument happening premise schools 100% driving infections. one article one place big Earth. lots lots communities literally zero outbreaks associated schools. community one them. make that? sadly country high mask usage. population thousands. lose 1000 people, may huge proportional loss man pathetic # GEE, WONDER Ok. Talk two weeks. Ok. Talk two weeks. This. really. sequencing, done national tests coronavirus. transparent. They're expecting test 270.000 citizens northern jutland gene sequencing done everyone, every case traced. Denmark one countries shut early hard, done testing almost countries Europe. positivity rate shows this, low positive numbers tests show this. Take look Denmark coming 80th cases pr. million people despite massively tested everything points country infection control.

Of course time tell cluster found elsewhere, said press conference type unknown european sequence database, highly unlikely widespread type infection. Hell, even blue collar jobs. children healthcare workers go? Police, fireman, paramedics. essential workers many markets cannot afford cost private nannies. ‚ÄúThis doctor told us child would fine, child didn‚Äôt even make twenty-four hours,"" child's father said. reason cannot use virtual office? Florida? second state adopt idiotic policy well Unfortunately, didn't. suit $2,000 (in 90s, pretty expensive) grew within couple years. also took put on, use time. I'd spend lot recesses inside play instead.

But pretty awesome do, regardless. point, never got experience actual recess kids.

It looks like someone made something actually looks like space suit helmet though. Probably UV shielding put windows, imagine would lot comfortable, probably able adjusted easily grow, would last longer.

She got locked house 45 minutes. think overcast, go hospital, life-threatening. yeah, definitely horrifying. schools also special treatments applied windows throughout building, otherwise able attend all.

Maybe one day they'll find way repair whatever genes cause disorder though. would amazing. think would go get tested? Good bot. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article know weren‚Äôt capturing nearly full picture spring, think still missing 5-10X cases? Good lecturer. Easy follow explanation. One thing really touch whether mutated strain subsequently spread humans humans, mink humans. Idk wear type mask js seen graphs before?

Anyway here‚Äôs first couple ‚Äî Europeans seriously ill coronavirus ever before, new hospital data 21 countries shows, surpassing worst days spring threatening overwhelm stretched hospitals exhausted medical lockdowns yet stemmed current influx patients, accelerated since began growing September, according official counts current patients collected New York Times. twice many people Europe hospitalized Covid-19 United States, adjusted population. That's absurd. legal obstacles lockdown. Trying anything radical would illegal would require, remember correctly, two separate votes parliament two different election periods. lol tried read El Paso County Judge's shutdown order, valid

It's game charades them.

Sorry reddit overlords, ill behave watch language trying describe feel Mr.Paxton... Yeah, naming big issue, Instead masks used 'Freedom shields'. maybe understand doctors getting better treating takes longer die. Increasing testing make interpreting numbers difficult. Thats crazy. people would hate 5 minutes, tehy heavy cumbersome, pretty much everyone.

\*this sarcasm\* living post-COVID world. Things changed. No. stop mutations. Stop spreading misinformation. I‚Äôm quite sure numbers states not. reason state daily tally new record? Half population America decided weeks months ago try achieve herd infection, rising part resulting curve. fact number high increasing daily news. Also keeps everyone else safe. read wrote. saying waving ""mistake"" areas bigger original claim, also apology list left big areas.

It would less embarrassing admit meant write ""America"" instead ""North America"". estimated killed 300¬†million people 20th around 500¬†million people last 100 years recently 1967, 15¬†million cases occurred whenever doomsayers places like sub get hysterical read stuff like realize absolutely amazing medical technology 21st century. Even 20th century hundreds millions people dying terrible diseases entirely normal.

If anything, know COVID makes initial reaction seem like massive overreaction. Though needless say initial reaction based government contingencies disease far worse turned be. Better prepare worst case scenario hope best opposite.  don‚Äôt think masks mandated places US. haven‚Äôt kept though. It‚Äôs honestly simple. every family parent stay home, wouldn‚Äôt want leave kindergartener home learn. 

We could better solutions this, government sat hands prayed would disappear. they‚Äôre shrugging shoulders though isn‚Äôt could do. antimaskers Republicans, Republicans antimaskers. ones struggling put food table.

Just saw bit french TV students skipping meals can't afford eat 3 times day. Surely people US going though similar hardships. also hold huge rallies masks social distancing. Democrat rallies drive-in. Well, hope found evidence, late like early Wuhan case.. Yes. Illinois one ridiculous. majority people truly want hole homes forever. shit. Finally I'm weary, I'm sure us are. Thank service stay safe. look cases graph (UK) date start second wave exactly schools returning. school sending home two kids sit either side one tests positive. ones eat lunch, take breaks with, sports etc - no. get spread siblings, spread kids classes kids take home give parents. 

Utterly hopeless. Lockdown pointless schools open. 1. never said source found suggest was. 
2. never said knew animal came from. 

My comment made tongue cheek, tell. 

My quibble title article. early phases pandemic, numerous articles medical professionals, including surgeon general, made dismissive claims covid. major talking point was, "" worried coronavirus, get flu shot thousands die year."" there, seeds doubt planted many Americans, often made frequent comparisons flu, dismissing covid thwarting early response. events unfolding Denmark, public health experts media responsibility convey accurate messaging manner disseminate general confusion. simply stating, ""what's happening Denmark evolving dynamic situation closely monitored,"" accurate. messaging provide greater reassurance public. much better stating, ""fears overblown."" vaguely afraid endless bad possibilities helps one

My post way suggesting fear endless possibilities. criticism message conveyed making comparisons messaging January. Again, done tongue cheek. monitoring? preparing for? included already daily life COVID.

I'm monitoring unfolding events, way suggesting become worse. knowing happening world, communicate messaging students (history professor epidemics) around me. I've since January, experts seem fully grasp much average person seem understand pandemic. blame average Joe, honestly, messaging cacophony since beginning. 

Again, I'll reiterate point: stating ""fear overblown"" ""this pandemic 2.0"" create enormous confusion general public. One simply state, ""this dynamic evolving situation monitored. know."" like titles carried text kind achievement look to.

Sorry, titles turning 20. don't. 

GBD proponents vicious, trying fool dumb. discussion takes place strong evidence academia become place mediocre. ""...a city spokesperson pointed statement shared yesterday KAMR said department reports cases, deaths, schools.""

What? Pretty sure students parents want know someone died. certainly want take anything either, right hurts most, feels like state would responsible that, no? pandemic ravaging nation feel wearing mask crucial reducing spread need everything can, state willingly sacrificing funding enforce seems absurd me.

I agree taking funding hurts poorest people most, want happen. also want die caught covid somebody otherwise. tough situation, want make anybody's life difficult, wearing mask seems like reasonable compromise. mean, Christ, nowhere else world issue. America, Fuck Yeah!!!! Well fucking shit. course. already mandated places cases still surging. Yeah ridiculous shit Sherlock!

FFS kids like plague rats,why would worldwide pandemic different WOW! WOULD THOUGHT /s Masks make huge difference. folks gonna rude awakening world comes back life spring/summer Yes course picture 2 weeks ago. reason things bad largely current administration way politicized everything. People lot stupid shit power encourage type behavior. add wife eldest me.

Neighbors kid tested positive home quarentine pending testing, there's won‚Äôt safe, way ends herd immunity. 

Either naturally vaccine. likely both. french making fun brits, two way street! imagine crazy parents? Or, know, RSVP like normal person. told thing. Everything would good elections. Maybe count finish? What's hate towards TX comments? Thats thing sanctioning entirely disagree with. penalizes poor disenfranchised people rarely heard is. Making life harder going cause go vote better policy makers. going make difficult vote all. 99.5% winning üòÖ got ya. Tegnell sith? hoarding aspirin begins 3...2...1... Definitely pub restaurants fault...education important, deaths cool right? IRELAND üëÄ Sweden barely reached 180k week think. said issue seriously overlooked media Sweden. Hats DK far. shit.

Sincerely

Europe That's much critical question. Baker pushing schools low-transmission areas open since August.

This new. people spout IFR survival statistics, miss. numbers know know disease lives lose. young death statistically low probability happening? Sure. doctor told family little girl would fine, information side. 24 hours later reality disease still know little hits. truly never know. 74 year olds survive, kindergarteners won't. insidious. Thoughts go grieving family. Wear masks. part. pandemic far over. go emergency room wait 12 hours.

This ease little start paying 18‚Ç¨ fee, admitted hospital seeing doctor. many people go ER go doctor! Masque Red Death? It‚Äôs R0 transmission rate. return behavior (the average person spreads one person) resurgences unless you‚Äôre Australia New Zealand basically eradicate it. Yes. True. fast everywhere else. really support measures reduce spread infection, think need sit effective vaccine. really pisses data reported way. observed effect school closure likely coincidence, that‚Äôs data shows. effect school closure R reduction 1 0.85 28 days school closure 95% confidence Intervall 0.66-1.10, hypothesis difference confirmed, 1 (=no effect) 95% CI. Similarly reopening. drug data it‚Äôs efficacy study, simply could get approval effect visible. 

I saying reality effect, data show reported way. This, understand studies given spotlight clearly make argument school opening account details type school, type control esp school staff. effect R meaningful without that? studies find school cases still among staff, hardly cases kids pass even staff. 
The details important. arrested, somehow feel might get away it. awful. Isaac Newton 1665 sent home Cambridge University 2 years Great Plague London (which ended killing 25% London's population). 

While room carved hole one window shutters small beam light could enter used work mathematical formula's would become optics. 

And hanging garden came theories Gravity motion (though story Apple falling head largely invented simplify explanation non-scientists). 

In 1667 returned Cambridge theories optics, motion, gravity made fellow professor 2 years later. correct take time  netherlands 488 people per km2 900.000 minks first 6 month covid .. 250.000!! one farm took break sub last days cause could tear away election stuff gotta say really helped mentally. 

Seriously, you‚Äôre feeling overwhelmed everything going pandemic try come days see helps. shit seen mutation humans since September. Hard take offence, internet, lack nuance/context etc. I'll admit it, reply properly triggered me, I'm currently deleting 5000 word essay full expletives context.

I''m saying ever close, we're looking 1000+ deaths day December, hell yes close them, gotta last thing. August able go McDonald's kids, goto school. Sick! That‚Äôs insane. depends?

It looks like learn treat virus death rate (percentage infected killed I'm unclear) going slowly down. Barring unfortunate mutation likely continue. 

So US dead ""just expose everyone get antibodies,"" would 2 million, would reduced 1.5 million? course, would create big chance unfortunate mutation, hospitals get overwhelmed expect millions dead matter great treatment, get treated matter. 

The possibility vaccine (or multiple vaccines) also important include. might able vaccinate politicians important people (rich, sports stars) end year. High risk essential workers early next year, general population June? next year? Sorry seem jaded.

So light end tunnel? virus. often manifests asymptomatic many age ranges, coronavirus case mean sick it. Good information, though paper spoke ability easily avoid antibody detection strain worry (considering also appears virulent) however believe overstated exaggerated. People conflate potential new strains current strain, though, helpful.

The main worry certainly potential worse strains, I've seen media use idea say bad *could* be, making people think strain that's problem. false fear mongering.


It's ticking time bomb next coronavirus pandemic, however coronavirusea humans near animals long time. pandemic renews worries future pandemics, interest drops them

I think need long term solution rather stop-start type panic, research stops soon people feel safe again. Scary stuff. Ctrl-F: Mendoza Reading comprehension 0 still don‚Äôt know cluster-5 / less deadly? Grossly irresponsible. article says putting lives danger voters election workers anyone else contact her. 
Sorry see virus claim another life. regretful didn‚Äôt isolate, take care everyone else process. think gave sooner, maybe that's me. Martial arts live video works great. Noncontact obviously, that's frequently case anyway. Yea guy misinformed, like anyone else taking herd immunity. mean?? cringe hard think winter months approaching. get time nice days go play. Soon it‚Äôll 24/7. Ugh. shed tear. got 3 year old boy turning 4, December. Scary. Shocking. Got recommendation tourists: stay home. Wherever go hazard. It‚Äôs especially hard us suffering mental health we‚Äôre forced confront selfishness rest society continue make sacrifices. mental health problems either way. care arbitrary political boundaries.  sick

a ""case"" necessarily mean sickness, even. big concern immunity gained infection immunity won‚Äôt last long enough beat viral mutations. Without rapid nationwide immunity would get like 60% antibodies mutation occurs infect 60% again. 

With rapid nationwide immunity (vaccine) don‚Äôt give virus chance mutate No, something else take place. Something might even less transparent.

Hopefully 4 week lockdown improves situation even go shutdown rest Europe Spring/summer think it‚Äôs responsible make bold sweeping assumptions like betting strain somehow also reached America

You understanding wrote correctly. I'm suggesting Denmark strain came America. I'm suggesting entirely different strain develop exact way Denmark, America instead. happen there, happen ultimately know strain would look like would get attention given Denmark, leaving entirely zero evidence exponential growth. 

Actually way know either. mentioned before, labs actually detect specific strain infected person/animal. dont capacity detect growth, really capacity detect existence different strains pop up. country basically following France, France keeps elementary schools open, therefore we, ""scientist guy"" makes COVID announcements, (and obviously completely fucking full shit since claimed supports Olympiacos) said elementary schools scientifically proven safe, citation : French goverment currently says is.

Also taking care immune system, like eating sleeping right, finding effective destressors help. Title get: State court judge allows El Paso County COVID-19 shutdown order remain place Pretty sure that's every state it, know logic is. latchkey kid leaving 9 year old home alone 12 year old brother entirely different leaving 7 year old home completely alone. That‚Äôs moving goalposts. course certain point start leaving kids home alone. 12 around age mom did. 

But leaving 7 year old home (NOT structured environment adults watching like latchkey) entirely different story you‚Äôve described. anyone found out, would CPS called leaving 7 year old kid completely unsupervised. you‚Äôve described lot understandable earlier articulated. Okay let get straight, think it‚Äôs responsible make bold sweeping assumptions like betting strain somehow also reached America, despite evidence can‚Äôt tell you: it‚Äôs unfair make claims yet because... according you....... there‚Äôs evidence it‚Äôs risk? üòÇ make make sense. It‚Äôs irresponsible make doom posts information. 

Secondly, zero evidence exponential growth. fact, reporting error C5 cluster spread outside contained area. evidence spread, evidence human human transmission; importantly ZERO evidence resistance vaccine. LESS resistant HUMAN antibody remnants natural infections. antibodies provided vaccine immune stimulating. 

EVEN vaccine resistant (already unlikely) wouldn‚Äôt matter unless particular strain already infecting people global scale (even unlikely). 

So contextually, really alarm bells making, frankly, baseless assumptions kind stupid. I'm frustrated apathy. rate: N/A

This something really scares me.  fucking way /s completely necessary wild, current society yes, people past find alternatives meat necessary them. learned make different types clothes need fur warm anymore. Um, duh Yes, humans best risk assessment, especially frame reference. almost back normal remember unless hard lockdown 2-3 months keep border closed hard quarantines entry (unrealistic) think back normal vaccine widely deployed. Kids increase community transmission. Significantly increased cases mean even overwhelmed healthcare system limited resources. effect, case fatality rate *will* increase especially vulnerable populations. basically happened early NYC Italy. What's sound hear? Sounds bit like somebody shifting goalposts bad idea... glad got that. special disdain sort brainwashing. lived farm similar also never hunt. blech. \- article, study, peer reviewed.

Ya can't ways ya inhuman murdering piece shit. Go find damn island. We've using model 6 weeks now, changing. We're best can. passing laws US would fine wearing masks (but live monarchy ""land free"" easier said done) movies, stuff happened much quickly thought. Americans don‚Äôt patience this. (Not quite sarcastic.)  truely find unacceptable. article shows, keeping schools open made situation worse.

I know lot people decided they're doomed get simply true take steps avoid situations. issue face continues spreading control rapid mutations. wider spread, stronger likelihood jumps animal human hosts mutates like hearing mink farms. situation devastating circumstance virus mutates way prevent current vaccines effective. gets bad enough, permanently remain limbo. Tell blacks freedom Well society ended 1919, we're living simulation now. #getwoke agreeing narrative pushed (even though right). Well yeah, gonna get rid virus anyway. scientific consensus fucker stay forever, become endemic like lot coronaviruses causing example common cold. gonna get improved immunity vaccine, children build natural imunity, virus going anywhere. 

And say bluntly, swinging fist house got hit, means certainly area shouldnt first place consider lucky got hit fist calibre .223

I mean people attending voluntarily know risk taking... ban that? spread outside? Possibly. thats absolutely different story thats wear N95 respirator cloth facemask going groceries. 

Some things principles paramount absolute. privacy, home family ones those. know times difficult, potential damage breaking principles staggering. love god please report it, parents could die. jacket analogy good one. It‚Äôs minor thing, even minor inconveniences good justification. 

I agree it‚Äôs weird backlash whenever people talk paths back normalcy. one hand, people really committed believing covid conspiracy. don‚Äôt want lives change won‚Äôt admit anything bad happening. people rightfully mocked sub. think another group people really committed permanent new normal. I‚Äôm sure motives are, there‚Äôs clear resistance ever getting back world virus even vaccine available. changes wouldn‚Äôt mind permanent, like increased flexibility working home. don‚Äôt know anyone wants keep mandatory masks around long term. even saw someone sub argue clubs never allowed reopen! think rhetoric like indirectly harmful, moving goal posts threats never returning normal going encourage people comply rules short term. Yea, testing available might way. available spring. Isolating might hard. usually younger people low wages. throw enough money way might OK isolating partners, friends, parents etc.  /u/True4Blue Hotel jobs many others magically reappear lockdown ended. WOW WOULD GUESSED? freaking duh. Unfortunately they're rounding corner Daytona. Round round round True, export flow back rest world, Europe tiny part market.

Someone asked markets replied. judgement that. somewhat interesting situation raw material flow EU Asia Asia/Russia/EU, usually raw materials flow Africa/South America EU/USA/Asia World.

I purely focusing anyone, statistics Mink fur trade are, nothing subjective that. leave final bit re-export Russia+World (I think Russia 50% so), asked. problem I‚Äôm started first wave. couldn‚Äôt online courses didn‚Äôt know family A.

Yeah you‚Äôre friends idiots. work past 2 nights I‚Äôve keeping track mask usage nights found 49% 54% wear mask still damn low. 1-200 people Paging Ric Romero..... Thats issue needs dealt school board. entirely separate remote learning hybrid systems. teachers paras dont cross. live bored while. live Belgium, schools closed couple months, seen grades go immensely. Thats way worse bored while. way fix continuing using schools way education build social safety net satisfy without depending going school work. can't instead forcing children go spend whole day bunch kids likely infect many sake eating, open kitchens people need (not schoolgoing children) make organized line, get meal eat back home lunch 

This exactly. someone volunteers food delivery organization, shocking find food delivery seniors confined household due quarantine millions food insecure families around country done primarily volunteer organizations, charitable faith-based organizations, food pantries. there's considerable geographic disparities less populous areas access even this. wealth country, refuse believe things can't organized government level.

And absolutely agree schools, much like cops, delegated solve everything. far surprising.

Some states saying want nursing homes vaccine delivered within 48 hours approval. They're definitely focus virus point, hope means governments hoping get quickly rather extending restrictions months even years.  Yeah feel there, Belgium we‚Äôve gone lockdown predictions won‚Äôt opening back fully February, byebye Xmas 2020... instinctively think death rates might higher places possibly state hospitals (one cause might nosocomial infections another might lack proper equipment even enough medical staff per capita). I'm sayin government said conducted serological study early october number infected people estimated 4,6% total population, much lower death infection ratio mention. reason culling is, fact, threatens efficacy vaccines currently development. mutation could set us back another year(s) allowed spread. goal immunize populations mutations happen. one calling apocalypse major surge Covid related hospitalizations cripple global health care network causing ripple effect unnecessary pain, suffering, death across board patients need (regardless illness ailment). Shouldn‚Äôt explain late game. people love willing die mink, seriously you?! Yes totally agree this. although many new residents cycle recovering surgeries go home independent, honestly still pretty dependent facility. That's there, get help ADLs physical therapy family can't provide.

I'm really happy hear ideas that. said probably pretty expensive need large amounts staff, state going organize own. also going run lawsuits companies facilities ya know, investors profits. think correct thing would federal government allocate amount resources strongly recommend practices, there's much variation facilities laws, many facilities state, even county really going responsible implementation oversight. Investors private SNFs go kicking screaming. ones want us open everything up, even lose residents get sued. whole facility broken parts protect lawsuits.

Once idea proven work areas, maybe talk larger scale.

Why? anything gain it? Apparently yes. understand, I'm swede. think feedback loop. schools, risky thing surface inspection, open, must safe. open otherwise. family normal things, generally safe now. Boom, gatherings, indoor public activities, masks, etc., etc.. Virus spread schools (parents hide illness keep schools open), people laxing precautions, bounces spreading people via school via ""giving up.""

The effective counter ""giving up"" tell people take seriously, serious cases pop everywhere people reminded happened Wuhan. close. glad school age children. could believe serious conversation sending kids back school first place! did, reports started coming said ""can please stop experiment somebody dies?"" nobody listened detach, even going far delete Facebook believe parents willingly sending LITTLE kids harms way. 

I mean evidence need prove we've become? yeah there's lot conspiracy that's mean stretch imagination. mean may lack medical professionals field due multitude factors, requests military backfill made except specific circumstances. California, New York, Texas perfect examples this. lack also need surging cases official DoD support requested happened? Military elements mobilized support sent requested. Spanish flu lasted 2+ years . 

We 9 months pandemic. Give time. right, that's exactly schadenfreude going for. wife initiated travel 2 weeks ago reason. Travel holidays going absurd, people getting complacent.

Even trying travel risk relatively lower, tested positive yesterday. best guess recent exposure infection week ago, flew. I've entirely asymptomatic whole time. virus sits silence lot people. know high-risk parents infected. holidays going *bad*. Shit Sherlock There's even discount? Yeah Jesus Christ, higher infection rate US really scary. Stay safe Sweden. really needed study Since pandemic I've realized LOT people operate way without really thinking issues through. 

*""Well, open! open safe!""* Here's latest case/death charts Tyler/Longview (Smith charts bad look nearly bad places. They're currently 63.55 deaths per 100k population. US per capita average 70.42. SpittenWheelie sus making us sus red. Yeah well huge load ifs, maybes possibles. someone infected house first place. spread it, catch it, immune system leave run rampant actually go outside spread someone else. single thing assured.

privacy, home family trump right life health, really. guess dependent community student body. Every place different works best Gotta love articles say masks effective ones one get. believe mask much better nothing. number dead ever decreases much bigger problem hands brother. Surprised pikachu. mean, duh Seriously, Spanish Flu El Paso would need fifteen twenty trailers. No, lying people. clarify statement:

It's ""7% healthy people still die it.""

It's ""7% people died otherwise healthy.""

A important difference. severely stupid friend said ""my life changed all, difference can't go bars. open bars gives fuck covid""

I told tell gets covid want made fun life.  ""Not growing freely exposed antibodies"" may referring *natural* antibodies plasma recovering patients. antibodies many different types, bind many different parts virus.

The vaccines, depending course types specifics, may cause potentially stronger targeted immune response, could issue. Even worse monoclonal antibodies currently have, literally one type antibody only, neutralizing efficacy current virus. Oklahoma's charts deaths surging. overall state better others. They're currently 35.18 deaths per 100k. ranks 41st terms per capita less well terms 7-day average per capita deaths, measure pandemic increasing severity. rank So.. scared mind be? People arguing months schools. completely obvious contact people, risk transmission increases.

And there's ""But trauma studying home"" people. First, home bad, blame, covid. Second, trauma teacher parent die WAY worse, especially there's real chance one got sick.

And finally there's all-or-nothing group, seem understand allow small number kids go school parents able watch day keeping kids home, helps protect everyone. older teachers still remote in, need healthy younger TAs monitor handful kids campus.

Remote school ideal, damn sight better alternative. Half us idiots. Simple that. Oh right alternative getting coronavirus much better. young neighbor got weeks ago. goes different school, full time sixth grade, got it. ""got it"" obviously still well 3 weeks. know tens cases town like young kids. honestly think risk outweighs necessity constantly see peers person? think so. American hypocrisy issue staggering. issues carrying phone allows half dozen private companies track every move, pushed laws limiting vast personal information marketing databases, limited government's ability subpoena information.  Nevermind tracing/monitoring done levels government.

But ask someone install mitigation app (Even Google/Apple one includes absolutely location tracking) suddenly everyone privacy concerns. even that; age-adjusted percentage underlying conditions.

Yeah, young healthy, almost certainly going die Covid. 75% age-adjusted surviving population underlying condition, underlying condition increases risk death much less 5% does. suspect that, age range Covid typically kills, much closer former latter; and, therefore, whole ""pre-existing"" conditions even bobbins. feel like authority keep disciplined. sense people keep stuff keeping line sum. friend described lockdown strict told seemed like la la land. shit people giving up. We‚Äôre given $1,200 bucks told fuck past 8 months Teachers sign die someone else's kid. rhetoric disrespectful fuck educators. get told kids getting matter. Dunno half assed work malingering fancied ""freedom"". Shit work shit work anytime Give time. European countries bitter resistant shutting weeks ago. virus crushed resistance ease. bait get banned ratings down, expect sports industry take huge hit advertisers. spread outside? Possibly.

And therein lies problem. answer ""possibly"", ""yes"". hit nail head say *you* wear N95 respirator go groceries. house-guests will.

Rights privacy, home, family well good. Rights life health trump those, though, I'm afraid. get what's necessary live, that's people eating millions years would thunk? True. utilize DPA get better masks produced numbers would need. people using cloth masks fine limited contact/exposure, simply cut sitting classroom office cubicle farm. know that, least family, went lot school-sponsored camps programs summer largely parents work day. Also, think there's bit gap home schooling finding babysitters/watching kids they're home holiday (where parent might also couple days off, though that's certainly universal). say make valid point serious concerns opening schools, provide additional perspective. Zoom!  zoom! fun! see parents' wacky holiday decor, see yours! Urgh. Except work command responsible coordinating overseeing tell wrong. Since I'm PA can't go detail that's true. Here's latest case/death charts El El Paso currently 79.95 deaths per 100k population - far US per capita average 70.42. deaths rising fast.

Right ranks El Paso 795th terms per capita mean, 9 months in, forward thinking places done entire time. really excuse thought something do. made comment earlier week we‚Äôll see 120k winter. Yikes wonder take governor admit nothing isn‚Äôt working? shit friends behave like covid-19

Nuts. get jealous Singaporeans' snap stories I'm ENTITLED skip precautions. tell brilliant minds government romania know many terminal patients hospitals/nursing homes get covid die something else get counted covid cases? Choices:

Vote interests

Or

REAAAALLY vote interests definetely trending wrong direction them. mean literally America trending wrong direction, disaster. Even places like New York mask mandates. rushed, fantastic hear, however, rushing also means *potentially* inadequate testing levels. There's reason FDA long standing rules comes drug trials accommodate rushing.

I know history. Russia loves cut corners rush vaccine trials long glorious history completely fucking everything killing population, causing problems potentially far worse end.

If rush, we'll opportunity determine long term effects adequate time.

Honestly though, I'm even variable. I've isolated year avoid contact people general. Shit I'm still even washing food bringing house.

Agreed 110%!

I want last 8 months cautious, keep family safe vain school decides throw kids back classroom.

Our schools 100% remote since start school year August. plan keeping remote end semester mid January. already hyping everyone come back school mid January next semester.

They made modifications school ventilation systems, hallways, lockers, lunchroom, made way properly space kids classroom. thing going done January. Even vaccine around corner, we'll lucky see injected people starting April May even still need time properly work throughout masses. ""is getting harder use port... guess means working... "" roll back vaccine progress, cellular immunity confirmed affected yesterday. Hell, cases cluster 5 even found since September Denmark tested 50% entire population. North Jutland locked now. experts determine Denmark 'extra careful' shared data. chill bit, would you? shit might different dozen strains ravaging world right now. 
 
Also: Denmark locked neighbouring countries... call reaching conclusion would prefer. study might prove happening (cases rise schools open), one fact causes other. 

For know it‚Äôs fact parents kids outside home free leave exposed catching virus responsible increase cases kids spreading disease themselves. 

As usual, people misinterpreting results. Good insight. Breaking experience though, looks like mostly ok asynchronous instruction actual learning content, value synchronous portion things like group discussion, peer interaction, etc. EXACTLY flipped-classroom model. instruction part done via pre-recorded content interactive lessons (so go pace, time, etc). create synchronous opportunities office-hours teacher, small-group discussions peers, engage non-curriculum instruction (i.e. play ""Among Us"" together), etc.

I idea school districts thinking. entire industry mapped out, how/when use synchronous vs. asynchronous, schools completely ignored this. political reasons, appease parents idea they're doing, ignorance. could used May August set LOT stuff, instead squandered opportunity focusing trying send people classroom worst pandemic 100 years.

It's absolute shame. world remote office work used pandemic likely jump 10-15 years future; world education actually *regressed* decade (since everybody feels remote learning ""doesn't work"", despite wrong). Absolutely. clear example aggressive avoid catastrophe, succeeding (hopefully), accused totally reacting catastrophe.

Denmark moved slowly deliberately handling time make major decision (killing mink), played safe. get lot hype succeeding they're reasonable enough realize much negative impact would done nation (and world, probably) under-reacted tried ignore issue (ahem - China beginning this). Looking Europe seems quite possible opening schools almost singlehandedly brought second wave countries seemingly beaten virus. countries went low numbers new cases August looking second lockdowns October, schools major factor see changed time period. true, opening schools extremely costly society overall; productivity cost second lockdown likely outweigh cost would lost school years schools stayed closed/virtual. mention second wave gets worse likely disrupt quality reopened schools themselves, possibly even get closed again. Virtual classes could probably work better university students maybe high school students. kids think it'll effective. Firstly poorer kids may best internet access families enough laptops kids. education also keeping kids isolated friends long periods time can't good mental health well being. think better solution would older school students like high school university students Virtual classes online keep schools open kids. feel like say even shot. I'm hoping he's like, ""look, bad, need take serious measures, people dying ever""

I guess we'll wait see -- sucks, wait people die. fucking shit expected people would take pandemic seriously outset, like NZ countries got control. 

I expected government would fucking job implement testing contact tracing require masks ensure enough PPE go around.

I expected government help families schools businesses ride pandemic safety, rather giving families choice expose children - thus entire communities - deadly virus.

At point, know expect, Republican party continue wield enough power continue stopping country taking necessary steps save lives keep families losing homes income. (NOSFERATU) !!! comment condescending. huge benefits kids receive socialization peers in-person learning attendance school ‚Äî must balanced risk disease. Plus, every parent afford stay home kids. It‚Äôs black white issue. charge worldwide travel, would blocked travel China got epidemic control.

It's shame countries afraid bureaucratic/economic retribution let COVID become worldwide pandemic. Sounds good way ensure virus goes months longer needs to.

A months ago, Victoria getting number cases UK France. they've gone entire week zero cases, states Australia reopening borders them. short term restriction pariah, suffer tens thousands deaths on/off restrictions trying manage surges. Sometimes, worth personal sacrifice greater good. remember hearing much anything Romania now, relatively spared first wave? know meant agree. call saying they've decided option 3 ""allow infection spread, slowly quickly achieve hypothetical 'heard immunity'"", admitting choice strategy? like people spread covid die it, chronically impaired it. childish, bullshit response kid's friend's parents. Source? Yes, beef farmer worked paid Daimer-Benz/Mercades, sent leather Rolls Royce too. I‚Äôm guessing didn‚Äôt watch press conference morning stated they‚Äôve tested specific mutation across world way middle full time HS go back full time Jan. one largest HS state. 

We‚Äôve already multiple cases football team even 2 weeks school. 

They don‚Äôt talk anymore parents want kids back it‚Äôs hush hush. 

When announced full time 3ft social distancing people pulled go virtual. think stems partly media sensationalizing shit. live safer time ever before, took US news face value I‚Äôd kidnapped sold sex slavery second parents walked door. People truly scared ever before, seems, sensationalism huge part that. think anyone ""this administration"" involved vaccine research testing. phase 2-3 results available read make informed decision that. point one lives forever, previous poster insinuated would. 

No didn't. insinuation would died *this year*. Taking something person said pretending said something stupid called making strawman argument. reasonable person read comment believed people dying coronavirus immortal. stupid thing assume, can't imagine someone needing clarify people immortal. Emergency capacity go 12000, likely 10000 proper ICU personnel staff. Deaths 1000 multiple times week. around 700 less last month. So... Ohh... that's good point. guess really lockdown like ""strong suggestion"". Geez. knew? hope article, boss breaking balls last weeks. get better don‚Äôt covid denier office Can't wait go clubbing 2021 enjoy getting wasted Emergency Induction Port‚Ñ¢ news: sky blue watet wet! Look without masks. Correlation imply causation. know fact kids go back school means parents free leave house accounts increase school setting itself. 

We need know more. Kids highly likely infected someone home school. 

They mention instance article closing schools one effective measures make obviously forces kids parents stay home effect immediate. 

You‚Äôre reading much data. meat vital need. Thank many studies showing missed cases pretty high, maybe give serology test anyone scheduled receive vaccine initially. Since quantities going limited initially shouldn‚Äôt give already antibodies presumably immunity. 400 years ago, epidemics raged London, forcing theaters public places shutter, William Shakespeare busy crafting stories kings going mad thanes coveting power. was, scholars believe, midst astonishingly potent creative period, one produced extraordinary tragedies ever written ‚Äî ‚ÄúKing Lear‚Äù ‚ÄúMacbeth‚Äù among remarkable achievement, one got thinking current moment possibility pandemic, society‚Äôs artful dreamers might find inspiration make similarly groundbreaking creations. ‚ÄúThe great work begins,‚Äù playwright Tony Kushner wrote final words ‚ÄúAngels America,‚Äù sprawling dramatic diptych another terrible modern perilous, isolating times, hunger special zeal great work artists capture experience us. novel coronavirus infected nearly 50 million people worldwide killed 1.2 million ‚Äî including 233,000 United States ‚Äî also created vacuum live entertainment kinds. includes performing arts, whose theaters studios forced shutter months organizations also furlough dismiss scores 5.1 million arts workers once, curtains closed hundreds plays, ballets, concerts, musicals ‚Äî well in-person classes drama, music dance feed future forms.

Idiots That's infuriating. Or, maybe they‚Äôre effective placebo group getting infected slowing results. may wishful thinking possibility matter remote. don‚Äôt know yet. read article. again. Tegnell admitting herd immunity go complete lockdown one month, [2] track many infected people possible quarantine them, **[3]¬†allow ""infection spread, slowly** quickly, achieve hypothetical 'herd immunity' ‚Äù.

Yes 3 closest Swedish strategy. possible infer herd immunity strategy. discussing last night. need find ways make sure I'm vacationing I'm spending money places agree politically. 

I think time explore Georgia Arizona warm weather vacations pandemic over. moment reopened schools country people stopped caring. saw everyone around go, matter days, ""the virus serious threat fight together, turns homeschooling bad bringing closer kids"" (yes I'm talking people even bad situation lockdown) ""well, gotta live, kids gotta school"". literally two weeks summer vacation government made two weeks school optional.

That key moment taught people relativate threat prioritize comfort.

Since apathy grown, growth cases fairly steady (with little acceleration) since September (reopening schools). 1/1000 population died covid. Hospitals screaming weeks they're getting overrun. people genuinely surprised (""this new wave hit us suddenly""). infuriating. would love know answer question. I'd guess yes. That's great news. send germany tell retardet U.S. kids required wear masks school states.i would imagine countries mostly stricter mask usage us. that's situation around world. Dane here, Iwish, farming insanely backed financially government, likely get this. Honest Question? tools needed? don‚Äôt think much tools parents working making sure child needs done. ton bad parents would rather let child whatever school day hours supervise Gee would shocked Biden actually make almost difference point, number reasons:

1. Trump already totally poisoned whole situation. politicized now. I'm sure even possible put genie back bottle, is, would take long time lot work.

2. Biden going try kind iron-fisted policy this. guidance attempts implement going require buy-in people, distinctly possible conservatives even resistant buttmad election result. 

3. would wager things actually getting worse time January 20 rolls around. think healthcare system sustain anywhere even close another 2.5 months level increase. believe overwhelmed, collapsing hospitals force hand regard local restrictions shutdowns across country, long Jan 20. work, like every time done, metrics probably already improving amount time time Biden takes office. 

4. vaccine essentially imminent time. If/when bring winter surge control within next months, least months another ""wave"" might start kick off. point, we'll something much better policy; we'll multiple vaccines starting flow population. significantly curb ability virus actually get periods exponential spread. TL:DR it‚Äôs new, even rapid test Britain. necessarily rapid tests. Note : / sarcasm mark i.e. use irony mock convey contempt, added sarcastically.... Cases Ohio increased fivefold month. Hospitalizations ICU admissions too. winter horror show. Gym Jordan entered chat. 

He requests keep concerns may yourself. Denmark may taking seriously plenty places thing probably won't, even thing happens. Probably good idea look mink breeder trade.
Looking Utah!!!

If transmits easily mink....it infected killed 3000 mink Utah alone....what's chance popping somewhere else farms concerned?

Maybe repeat history blow like beginning thing Wuhan.

Its deadly mutation destroys vaccine hopes research. Watch Danish PM announcement.

Britain stopped travel Denmark today real reason. Ignorant liberal likely deltoid muscle. Vaccines generally IM Im starting worry masks going efficient shit getting colder virus getting huge boner BNO LINK DEAD NOW, STOPPED TRACKING AUGUST 7TH. I've given seeing family friends, going eat lot things people sub relate too. Government gave trying take care us probably liberals anyways. Darn. read headline thought actually given vaccine. saw article UK two vaccines approved December distribution. Oh well, soon enough! fair mortality rate isnt anywhere near people thought would b4 hit here, mean look Italy cruise ships people scared shitless would wipe us out. 

The real bummer become politicized issue thanks republicans, calling hoax, disinformation... fuck wear mask public going near people(especially inside) avoid big gatherings. Everyone talks ohh 99% likely die it, yeah lung respiratory damage cause, that's talked gotta live damage, might even take 10 years life  pigmentosum

One simply ""Keep dead kid"" secret school. People freaking vaccines work. productive.

Culling minks abundance caution something probably done months ago.

It little bit disturbing scientific evidence dangers needs exaggerated (which getting everyone worried imminent Pandemic 2.0 seems case) order get political traction order take sensible actions. kind thing winds creating political blowback hampering future efforts. real ""boy cried wolf"" problem political sphere needs navigated can't simply ignored. scientists Denmark need realize they're probably burning political capital here. Hopefully find short later. cant think better damn theme song.... Same. COVID twice actually. Would love get vaccine go back helping people.

Like, several countries already hit new exponential phase second waves. Next time go hospital, please share thoughts subject healthcare workers. nieces crying friends going get go back school parents (high exposure health care workers) allow it. 

Literally night kids supposed go back, school decided continue distance-learning cases *out fucking control.* much drama reason. 

Well reason. going distance whole semester parents started aggressively lobbying open cases stagnated. guess one remembered promised huge fall wave. Dumbasses. kids summer? schools aren‚Äôt year round don‚Äôt see worth people‚Äôs lives. read comment come exactly opposite opinion despite agreeing words written. worth people dying? worth thousands upon thousands ***corpses***? visceral reality seems worse losing education me. getting 80% figure?  anyone curious it, map france detailed neighbourhood incidence maps diseases available, french.

11:th March. declares pandemic. 
13:e mars. New phase. Aka ""the herd""? March distance learning universities recomended. Oh sweetheart, wait hear hemispheres.

 


For start latitude differences make seasons experienced different countries totally different.

 


The fact opposing seasonal weather exists time either hemisphere alone would negate impact data. many people actually virus nothing winter's cold varying severity person person.

I know increasing numbers people fall category: bad cold.
Now proper flu others hand -yup really wipe out.  Estimated 60%. Feel free fact check that, easy find multiple reliable sources.  now? point assume everyone gonna get this? don‚Äôt see U.S rest world bring control point I'm sure nothing decline cable TV, magazines, unable compete giant networks biggest games even fact they've slowly laying people years. Entirely this. would phrase majority people political persuasion would rather see people die give way life 18 months.

Right wrong, see repeated across multiple cultures. It‚Äôs people listened scientists pandemic researchers instead orange conman. Uhm yeah, I‚Äôm gunna need fact make claims bold. 6th grade. could see HSers hating know I‚Äôm say oxymoron, think trump realizes (that‚Äôs oxymoron anyone wondering) that‚Äôs it‚Äôs past November 4th, COVID ha definitively disappeared. vaccine works minimize risks good chance never catching it. do, well good luck.

Nope. Pretty much governor saying ""North Dakota Smart"" patting back giving money oil executives hand.

There's mask mandate Fargo, city announced said breath enforcing it. know mask mandates cities. There's ""risk level"" map counties, county high risk they're supposed reduce gatherings, restaurants bars 25% capacity 50 people, whichever less. there's way enforce that. I'm told bars shoulder shoulder Halloween.

Talking coworkers family, general consensus ""we're going get suck live life."" I'm made feel like asshole saying care want wear mask. Mask use rare. Proper mask use even rarer, even places claim require like workplace. People think reason cases there's testing. still hear people saying daily flu kills people year... I've never known anyone die flu four North Dakotans family members friends died Covid.

Hospitals full, think they're opening stadiums hold sick people? knows they're going find doctors willing work there. I've heard word mouth doctors taken primary duties (obgyn, cardiology, etc.) moved work covid wards. Paperwork safety measures reduced hospitals reduce workload treat patients.

I want here... Thankfully steady supply N95 masks help keep safe. I‚Äôm eating less pork red meat lately. need wear mask slow spread. that‚Äôs much. cycle continues New York State mandating 2 week quarantines now, although enforcement isn‚Äôt practical part relies people honest. we‚Äôve switched new model get tested 3 days leaving New York, quarantine arrival get tested day 3. you‚Äôve symptoms second test negative end quarantine. I‚Äôm sure exact method top head it‚Äôs rolled now. new models reducing quarantine implementable ways about... u/NomanHLiti voted look second peak UK started rise, funny enough co-insided schools reopening summer break See hand sanitizer everywhere? That's matters. gloves do... make need hand sanitizer. Save bunch screwing around. Keep toxic (some it) stuff hands. Save time money. Also gloves keep hands warm protect physical damage. much debate really.  combative easy. babysitters/caregivers breakfast/lunch source millions kids. school, lot people can't work. school, lot kids can't eat. 

People going back work exactly want pandemic. job *can* done remotely, *should* be. Jobs can't, essential, operate reduced capacity ensure distancing. people able work, work less, give stimulus/unemployment. That's braindead stupid Republicans reason holding covid relief bills Democrats trying pass past 7-8 months, ""if give people money, inventive go back work!"" Uh, yeah. That's point.

As meals, many school districts started providing free bagged breakfast lunch pick-up anyone 18. school district, drive up, designated time day, tell many kids, give 5 days worth breakfasts lunches per kid.

Now, obviously, everything shut sustainable forever, large scale shutdown, nationwide mask mandates, actual compliance enforcement, *have* stay shutfown forever. Welp. Look red map days. cities remain blue, areas agricultural workers employed live remain red. 

Many us working right deserve far protection given. Hospital workers, teachers, service industry, retail... add list Americans suffering hands lack leadership. bad realizations made days earlier, maybe we'd finally election limbo we're now. Thank you! Every decision heart breaking sucks. 

My personal soap box families parents cannot work remote. children home alone without support. Also isolate costs falls flat since families cannot isolate. No, really. current mutation shouldn‚Äôt issue regarding vaccination efforts. it‚Äôs clear virus mutates very, slowly. 

This would problem maybe year two drastic measures aren‚Äôt taken now. they‚Äôre taking care now. 

Always research! That's thing seasons, tend similar across countries.  Wait. thought going disappear Nov 3rd.  would .1% chance. Evidence shown majority population much lower risk death that. 

Your ability evaluate demographic belong hot either. demand decreased across world, east west. mink fur specifically, much market outside Russia, China, South Korea Japan.

Even without Covid-19, mink industry would've dire straits soon. market disappearing last 10-15 years. ded matter? many dead brushed lightly. people dying left right, pumping statistics. US? 50%. It‚Äôs overweight. Women prone living autoimmune disorders, work long time invisibly sick body can‚Äôt get work day.

Pretty much every world leader shown taking decisive action COVID seen approval ratings increase dramatically. Next weekend? journalists pretend scientists.  reopened, kids went Halloween partys, pretty much f***ed. ironic thing is, people argue schools open still advocates lockdowns want granny die. Apparently ok millions kids catch spread virus though üôÑ Wow, 17.000 22 million lot...

I wonder many deaths suicides, missed medical treatments etc. are.

People forget, lockdowns, viruses diseases kill well. claims dishonesty without specifying wherein would lie. think response allowed present line said since beginning. Yes hand severity SARS made much easier detect contain. Almost everyone got immediately got quite sick, many dangerously so, whereas COVID-19 around half may symptoms all, many others symptoms indistinguishable colds. Needless say latter much contagious difficult contain reason.

It's kind like ebola never actually become huge pandemic despite deadly disease, actually kills people make far spread others.

The worst worlds something like smallpox lethal yet people survive long enough spread far wide. There's reason smallpox first virus eliminated. Damn, Denmark basically committed mink holocaust nothing then?

Poor animals. deserved better. know going get slaughtered fur anyway, still. like Stoicism vs. Epicureanism. remember incorrectly. discussing Swedish strategy context ferguson paper NPI.

Shits ridiculous. Germany's hospitals looking far? think posted record number new cases today, well - though nearly many France, course.

Genuinely wondering, can't find much information hospital capacity Germany. explain huge surge excess deaths year? US states individually. I'll start: North Dakota 665,000. *I‚Äôm* France. You‚Äôre making stuff up. zero mask compliance inside restaurants, bars (until recently *finally* got shutdown) half people wearing masks chin right nose. also zero notion social distanciation. precisely keep getting infected here.

There mega lockdown asian country China. Maybe S. korea back March since. Asians wear masks religiously, good respecting sanitary measures especially things like social distanciation. disciplined, unlike us westerners. they‚Äôre well we‚Äôre struggling. came yesterday

Ugh, triple quadruple negative headline? can't parse sentence. Duuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhh Duh  Silly Canadians. know COVID spread schools? /s opposed USA said stop counting cases less? think I'll trust China USA one. question rhetorical, actually need much answer question. Hopefully new administration take advice people specializing answering kinds questions.  People hoarding toilet paper canned food March also ""assuming worst"". guess one used mock back then.

""remember said"", yes, happen people like tendency believing every tabloid headline misreporting scientific studies. also selectively delete catastrophic premonitions materialize due confirmation bias (3,7% fatality rate, 100k dead Sweden, survival surfaces terribly long periods, catching covid food, seasonal see reduction deaths summer, etc). usually shuts folks mentioning NBA, F1, Tennis, Soccer, Football, everything stopped. talking billions upon billions dollars lost virus. hoax. 

People like ones mentioned ""decided"" reality want live someone close dies - they're going accept serious. 

Stay safe. care number cases? metric makes sense. Let's measure number available hospital beds number deaths. thought also cross mind tiny silver lining. Also I‚Äôm mildly asthmatic exercising cold air really messes airways. I‚Äôm wondering mask might actually help that. Since seem like mind, I'd like ask holidays situation:

Blunting effectiveness antibodies mean vaccines work. clear, said they're less responsive antibodies, unresponsive. happens since insist editing new information comments reply new comment. Thus creating new comment chain. ah nice lol

‚ÄúOn Friday, one Cabrera‚Äôs fellow writers another blog pushes unscientific arguments questioning COVID-19 data, Rational Ground, announced Twitter hired work data analysis DeSantis, including COVID-19 projects.

It obvious Denmark busy happiest country world, actually react someone extorting spreading deadly pathogen get paid. Hopefully leadership tell folks listen scientific experts take necessary precautions. I'll bet surge driven schools careful. know can't 100% prevent transmission, many schools like ""whatever"" takes small number clusters cause huge problem. That's work unless everyone it, like vaccination. Unfortunately can't get enough compliance, makes ""unsafe,"" even half schools great.

It's kind like visiting family. visited grandmother yesterday important birthday. Yeah, risk. see much wear mask stay day. I'm low risk person stay home. try keep windows open. think worth it, happy visitor special day. done.

But... many families would choose birthday party. 15+ people. Food. Drinks. Several hours. Long conversations ""catch up"" family members. special day last? Gotta *everyone* together, right?

This shit done. Health care workers work Covid+ patients day, going rooms get sick often community! actually thing. even N95s time, wear surgical masks goggles! Lower rates infection general public!! possible!

It's insane *we actually won't.* school driven R0 like rocket, can't figure problem is. Federal government give enough funds guidance. Everyone's own. sucks. Thank this. Much appreciated. take numbers mean hospitals OK far, things considered? wear glasses fog way proper nose wire. Protection ways may bit limited way better nothing. problem never reach that. immunity virus last 5-6 months, bam, reinfection. 

Yeah good times ahead

Especially 20% infected need hospital stay survive. 

Yeah 20%, good times 75,000,000 people need stay hospital survive this. Great times indeed. *How see coming?*

/S can't believe taxpayers put this.
