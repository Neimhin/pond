0,2021-02-07," I'm actually UK I'm arguing point.

You suggest sorts measures there, may benefits. comes it, nothing close light end tunnel vaccines. That's literally it.

Sure maybe USA government encouraging measures like suggest, main point come across like vaccines scam there's another way this.

No supplement social measure comes close it. Lol, ""culturally tight"". Jesus Christ.

You mean **authoritarian**. Yes, authoritarian societies well dealing problems respond well exercising strong control population. true, sadly.

From I've read people live Singapore, ""culturally tight"" misleading best, outright lie. different ethnic groups tend mix nearly much Western countries like America. 

There ""harmony"" simply police tolerate disharmony. 

Hell, there's literally one [tiny whole nation degree free speech allowed. 

Provided first obtain permit. Also, please note A/V surveillance system installed protection. seems zero covid approach solution

I'm sorry, based exactly?

Pandemics end eradication. myth I'm sure gotten popular. LOL still working amyloid? many times failed people still put multi billion dollar efforts crash burn? it. decided wanted build 4 bed/2.5 bath house right (not existing development), would realistically take year year it. get land, get blue prints drawn up, find go/builder, get permits, start construction, go inspections). 

Houses way less complex plants, lot things need considered.  you’re gonna build plant? educated workforce support plant? local government going PITA? start building. 

Like project, requirements get glossed plant gets designed incorrectly. Pipes wrong place, etc. plant ,pmentioned got innards reworked couple times. causes delays costs.  everything running, get certified FDA produce product you’re going produce. means lot “test” production runs. Typical sub Pot calling kettle black. know, feel horrible college students. terrible college experience. hope next year almost normal. Right flu vaccine required board plane... would different whole sub full disillusioned crybabies want ignore reality pandemic tomorrow. Even though evidence points happening. virus care children's schooling economy negotiating it. matter whether we're ok putting torch population sake financial gains. Okay. still want first. Hopefully ""recalls"" like Tesla ramp up. Yes point paper making becomes endemic, variants drastic effects population already vaccinated exposed different variants, topped immunity keep pace drift. immunity stop infections, stop worst effects virus.

That's essentially happened OC43, thought caused 1889 Russian flu (minus vaccinations). Even kinda like N95 masks - they’re back openly available reasonably priced average person. Wrong. It’s probably already late prevent new variants spreading. work improve tests entry? mind waiting results come back would guess actually- vaccines tend much better severe disease even can’t stop disease entirely. We’ve already seen vaccine trials Covid- reason think Oxford different here. rates infection older fully vaccinated people cratered. Deaths follow lag. Young people still getting sick while. “new normal” never happen. way end mass events frivolous travel, accept covid one many causes illness death exist world. 

That said, vaccines way out. Virtually entire scientific community agrees great chance bringing pandemic flu-like levels, already live with. faster get people vaccinated, less likely variants are. Variants happen spreads, vaccines halts spreading good data yet common sense existed would currently like NZ Australia (or least Germany) instead watching thousands die every day. common sense existed people blame things ridiculous conspiracies like gain control population. common sense existed local governments pushing schools stop virtual teachers get vaccinated. common sense existed people marching restaurants without masks yelling muh freedoms random service workers trying job.

That said, they're pushing things open already still height current peak pandemic obvious see things open even later things resolved. Tampa resident here. wide open since September. packed bars New Years eve weekend. good bad. love see people keeping jobs. hate mom works healthcare deals aftermath. hate one wears masks. toss point personally. 

And yes. Tons people moving state...which sucks that's another topic. efficacy estimated around 22% (not statistically significant, could zero) mild moderate covid.

Seems wiser focus better vaccines wasting precious infrastructure negligible gains.  spike holidays over, people still make worse 14th. Stay safe wear mask. Yes is? It’s urgent space race. already surplus vaccine available, vials waiting fridges. need fund Kremlin. Ah well guess know vaccine seems outlier terms suffering massive drop efficacy.

Good thing four others Thank you! Let's hope UK variant ends dominating without adapting. It’s much setting fire, even worst case scenario find doesn’t work try again. Getting tested flight always allowed alternative. Hopefully tests get accurate. disagree. That's remind me. I'm wrong, I'm wrong clickbait media that's people want days. case vaccines? This. People going take what's offered them. doubt there'll option one other, least long time. pharmacy get choose; government sending us Moderna (which we're thrilled storage). No, soon. B.1.1.7 biggest threat proven transmissible. SA variant much; many people infected vaccinated. point, we'd likely boosters. You’ve vaccinated: chances transmission contracting virus extremely low, like astronomically low. don’t need protective measures, live life. HAHAHHAHAHHAHAHA course going say that, losing race. think people reddit tend overplay normalized is. Likewise, people would sometimes wear really disciplined (ie wearing street taking store), definitely see annoyance set it. seen estimates indicate 100mm 30% infection getting vaccine. Yeah won’t cause sort meaningful uptick. They’re reaching days fear putting sh** me. joking probably going like flu vaccine, pretty much guarantees get sick, and, well, apparently number 2 makes sick lol. flu like 10 years, 2017, since. Everything gets vaccines gets almost every year. fun! vaccines cases, they're reducing death rate. enough vulnerable people vaccinated, big number cases harmless hospitalizations deaths drastically reduced. Israeli researchers revealed data, per agreement Pfizer. disagreement? much smaller events super bowl (where people multiple families get together reminder) super spreaders. lots evidence almost assuredly result spike Depends much cross-immunity get.  there’s even decent amount cross-immunity, be, B117 would become dominant crowd SA variant. saw expert today opining might happening places.

But it’s complicated SA seems evade infection-induced immunity degree, there’s always risk UK variant adapts include worst parts SA variant serious infections

That's life long effects coming from. come asymptomatic cases well. assumption totally faulty. article obvious clickbait people talk systemic race issues personal anecdote counter argument statistical argument lol It’s school though. Kids homeschooled this, participated sports friends. something wanted, cost goes up. Pharmaceutical companies knows incredibly immoral mark ups needed treatment. spent billions getting deserve, yeah, price skyrocket year. companies give away mRNA recipe world rely them. wanted product, competitors create cartel price inflations. soon first vaccine roll out, keep giving boosters cost, bet it. first part second?

Calling massive cartel issues 'white comment'. Outside touristy resort towns touristy parts top major cities, gringo safe lot time. stop restrictions allow natural infections top immunity

Did evolution stop happening? needed lock year ago, failed so. That's variants. Bad news New Normal crowd correct wear masks without complaint, however, mandates lot people willing wear masks generally upset everyone wears masks time compared public. Another thing people really upset fact events happening even understand (The Emperor’s Birthday week month probably big upsets lot). required enjoyable existence requires people gather even get 30% population vaccinated? Like honestly assault anyone brings possibility legit issues particular vaccine name calling, lose opportunity learn new things. better testing high low dose? one dosage? Pfizer vaccine found 5% effective... allowing affected COVID I’m glad Canada didn’t put eggs one basket AZ vaccine. enough doses moderna Pfizer cover population, issue getting lol. I’m worried transmission. know I’m fine. don’t want bring home family, who’s vaccinated, catch say variants present one country time, know one would end dominating? SA study shows completely ineffective SA variant. need US use Super bowl gatherings anywhere near big Thanksgiving Christmas  want accept life now? Holy smokes... 

None us wanted accept life. people locked back start, we'd done virus. Even somewhat serious lockdowns would likely prevented vaccine resistant strains.

To put terminology understand: Stop hitting yourself. Stop hitting yourself. Stop hitting yourself. really, case scenario - die 29 covid-23

That's worst case, no. Life long complications worse some.

I'm sick sub brigaded folks obviously trying sow discord places clearly live. get upvoted bunch first 60 seconds comment, comes back Earth actual sub members read it. one knows virus going do

Stop anthropomorphizing virus. virus sentient still hit peak predictions taking account something true make so. want people stop thinking they're experts read Reddit yet happen.

An abstract concept ""truth"" determine people cannot do, Government does. 

If Government decided open schools relax restrictions, ""truth"" completely irrelevant reality. Wait vaccine. variants popping up. I'm probably gonna get vaccine available disabled and/or essential workers, both. would agree enough j&amp;j while. Still yes, vaccine open anyone Grandma serial killer convention saw happen holidays multiple times. link conjecture ""studies"" numbers low can't draw conclusion anything.

And comment even conjecture nothing sure can't draw conclusion expert comments random keyboard warriors thinks experts everything. Unless actual sources scientifically verfiable information, please bullshit internet. Imagine world governments focused funding making vaccines profitable companies. wonder else could eradicate years time. I'm talking footie game point life worth living anymore. Looks like deaths finally starting come too. -83 7 day average one day bad. quite willing pay vaccines :) Novavax perfusion spike according soon?

How prevalent now, fast appear spreading? search yourself. AZ’s applications European UK approvals published results trials used application process widely available. contracted companies, nothing manufacturing sites. suspect reason manufacturers keep saying meet contract terms end quarter confident fill US order start exporting (the Defense Production Act forbid export, forces prioritization US orders foreign ones). Yeah, think people understand rarely one teacher one class elementary school. paras sped teachers, speech occupational therapists, librarians, music, art, PE teachers, counselors...even elementary classrooms busy places. good though elementary cohorts students easier keep together. 13 yo 10yo schools closed since March (even though community levels quite low). Many friends haven’t allowed see anyone. Sports mostly closed. 

It’s bad. It’s really bad. Several suicidal. Lots behavioral issues. One friend developed anorexia. Several cutting themselves. New psych meds. 

You don’t understand done generation mentally emotionally. It’s really destructive. kids ok bc threw lot crap window took heat it. willing risk Covid damage kids permanently. 

As society, closing everything kids decision won’t age well. Wonder happens figure Arab Jews exist... Yeah supply likely constrain rate lower 4M/month unless Novavax and/or AZ suddenly come online lot supply. matter much. end June, US expecting take delivery enough vaccines J&amp;J, Moderna Pfizer inoculate every adult US some. Novavax/AZ would icing cake brings ""vaccination saturation"" even earlier. Correction: Facebook stated would crack misinformation. Facebook ever anything goes making money ways interaction? Cept also commonly used pollution well many nations. normalized No, didn't. Meningitis left lasting effect die combination meningitis covid. meningitis recovered. 

He died lungs rest organs handle stress covid. baseline overall health weakened fluke. Something, way, true tons people ages covid things like lung scarring even dangerously I'll time.

That point. It’s hilarious seeing Twitter checkmarks coming woods today give sportsball bad takes. stadium partial capacity, PPE, people spaced apart, many vaccinated must suck superspreader event. Whoever lets vaccine dose expire forced write personal apology letters every unvaccinated person country.  $150? would costs go much? Generally, scale, costs go down. would create combination vaccine current strains. 

The R&amp;D COVID vaccines expensive. Once. new mRNA vaccines spun 48 hours post-sequencing. costs sunk. 

Its easy panic fall sort thinking dealing variants something that's hard. need ramp vaccine game happening now. Eh? Canada 4th Pfizer 1st Moderna, no? charge countries beginning realize  **Feb. 8, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

S. Korea's kimchi exports hit record high 2020 Ohhhhh. FASTER! 50% less look big pictures research. Overall deaths. entire breaking relative risk particular groups gives false sense security. Deep discounts I’d say pretty low. either way see friends. outside makes feel safer. Nope best strategy AZ dependent nations compete vaccinations. give protection original strain UK variant. time stop SA variant seeding restricting travel, quarantining incoming people outside country heavy survailence. get booster shot addresses strain distribute it.

The mRNA Novovax J J better SA variants think US extreme. got complete national vaccination keep eye hotspots come SA. booster needed. Right? Wth! want scared! Please let be! That's bunch misinformation Happening Europe too. I've lot doubts human nature year whether I'd like start family (except via adoption, ideally open). r/iamverysmart survive, recover, die suddenly complications disease. Still reeling loss friend way. super dumb. actors get tested even anything set; would assume commercials would same. thousand years will, plenty time solve it. EU developed produces them

no I’m sorry..I worry every day 11 family members 6 sure LongHaulers rest children it’s harder diagnose them. right, tiny event hundreds people around country hundreds millions... SA virus becomes big deal stay locked rest 2021 seriously think I'm going end it. What's point living cant go hang friends, cant go dates, cant get good education, cant go parties, cant even go gym, cant live normal life... town? would rate pretty safe long one high risk. One thing I’m trying understand supposedly someone vaccinated still infected spread it? Please correct I’m wrong that. 

Either way, I’d go. It’s good exercise good see friends. Yeah, that's serious claim need serious evidence start making accusations like that. far none articles actually evidence. reasons event affect vaccines equally. JNJ targeted better protein spike, mRNA vaccines. Pfizer induces production shit ton antibodies *should* remain efficacious lost friend covid effects. 40, mild case she'd recovered from, serious chronic illness. Fell asleep watching TV husband never woke up. Covid really terrifying. Best strategy get first place. Take precautions reasonably can, fucking around. Same, disappointed frankly person color - hate article seething passion.

Not it’s unnecessarily racial, it’s another point long history people trying control narrative.

My grandmother, poor, gets second dose next week. cousin, doctor another state, fully vaccinated. 

The community city live worked local officials make sure people access vaccines exposure it’s availability. everything perfect, everything harder poor, people lesser means forming partnerships finding way. 

We’re okay. agency. Fuck Cathy. I’ve heard nothing three shot vaccine. like president changed agree think it'd super easy given landlord top. December 17. think strategy countries rely AZ clear. Complete national vaccination. protects original strain UK variant. still need that. 

Then need control SA strain somehow get widespread booster. Probably get travel restriction high degree survailence sequencing.

Then get booster distribute nation wide. That’s quite right it? Wasn’t 20 cases? don’t think serious cases either group. sample ages 20-40. basically don’t know yet. good chance would still efficacy terms reducing hospitalisation death, waiting data don’t know yet. similar probably similar results. Saaame hard know part others aren't. Believe me, feel you. Hugs internet friend! hope get see parents soon! AZ abdicate resources help relevant vaccine makers. Yeap, im living Changchun, dongbei region hit harder new wave, living tested see else infected, tested entire population affected regions. case saw whole building load buses going hospital mass testing, friends, chinese foreigners went same. also saw places city designated covid tests big lines. Chinese new year coming lot people travelling, traveling require extra covid test, mostly chinese friends went back home since big university city, lot population families elsewhere, travelled, covid test done. Sure post bunch completely inaccurate outright deliberate misinformation use B word, bring banhammer. one US gotten AZ outside trials. So... feel this! dark night day since nearly year since I've able see boyfriend less six feet apart. (He's high exposure work, live high-risk mom, vaccine way this).

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* entirety last year disagrees. hey, let history get way. believe there's idiom failing learn history great involved.  Israel one counties UK variant gained dominance far. point they're discriminating individual people people working sign vaccines racist point systemwide there's discrepancy vaccine dissemination based race. missing point dude I'm saying over. AZ far vaccine available. *pro-gamer move* virus could lengthen months effective vaccination campaign. months pandemic time thousands tens thousands lives many countries first non-holiday 100k cases since election day

hope everyone enjoyed big game J&amp;J, Moderna Pfizer work SA virus, J&amp;J 100% effective preventing hospitalizations, deaths. close efficacy original wild type. Example, Novavax 90% original version, 89% Uk.

It’s SA variant that’s problematic Yeah, know, looks good. 

I keep reminding people can't 6 years worth safety data vaccine disease that's ~14 months old. reinfections confirmed almost everywhere, new, even got hit reinfection far worse impossible another reason weak, complacent, loud dullards virus puts unmanageable numbers hospital things shut anyway that's acceptable (also people become frightened). We've seen many times now?

You cannot run 80% economy. work. 

And modern pandemic worth taking measures really analog. last severe respiratory pandemic 1918, influenza. Influenza faster unstable virus is. Realistically long terms effects enough justify restrictions, many governments US made clear base restrictions hospitalizations. That’s reality.

Also, UK made clear strategy too. Well serious cases ones taking hospital beds preventing would worth it, know that. reminds COVID going China starting break Italy. many posts total numbers going even though thoughtful person would realize situation get much worse. Look studies racial discrimination criminal justice probably shouldn’t Reddit.

Nice 3 month old account. happened last one? much shame Trump shilling delete? known better.  Uk study read back, 0.13% people mild moderate infections lung complications infection. sub likes act like half everyone covid gets long lasting issues. anecdotally know 5 people got covid, one issues lasting longer 3 weeks. 

It’s issue. investigated. Perhaps sub mostly made young people risk death, issues much scarier them, change preventing death priority 

These issues need investigated treatments developed. need *stop* acting sub like it’s majority people, even minority, even small minority. It’s small *fraction* people. childhood friend misinformed.

* vaccine currently market requires three shots. possibility needing booster future (perhaps 2021-2022 winter, can't say) would that-- booster.
* CDC giving doses. worms fucking kidding, right? virus ""alive"" imitates life constantly morphing due natural selection-like process. We're even remotely sure mutated strains US impact have. There's reason random Redditor making policy decisions that's fucking good.

And yet Governors across states, including deep blue ones agree opening schools, putting fewer restrictions, opening indoor dining, etc...

There's reason people like ignored Governors making health policy decisions: opinion matter.

If want stay home COVID eradicated worldwide, free Governors agree life go care believe in. Doctors saying ""you need this"" people ignoring doctor something wrong. worst, selfish side humanity worst. want sooner, wear fucking mask smack everyloving shit anti-maskers.

Governors saying ""it okay this"" impact reality opinion favorite doctor.

I hope body ready Biden politicians USA ignore Fauci's precautions keep plan re-open schools, indoor dining, etc...

It happening speak there's nothing it. That’s thinking. know new variants spread easily &amp; friend works restaurant makes little worried, think overall, it’s safe get given current situation. I’ll definitely try keep much distance can. OK makes sense. even listening person even getting mad. state country determined vaccination goes random people.  missing point. point racist literally even know race? saying that’s awwwful lot pro China posts one account 1918 H1N1 pandemic influenza waves every year 1957. mutated, came back, became seasonal influenza.

Eventually escape mutants come cost fitness human cross-reactive immunity take sting it.

And keep mind vaccines still working well enough cross reactive immunity S.A variant. title result hits AZ vaccine spike stabilized antibodies forming predominantly ineffective shape spike.

Ultimately we're going exposed endemic SARS-CoV-2 catch it. goal build antibodies vaccines force virus make costly mutations evade vaccines severity much lower.

Even vaccines we're taking intramuscular unlikely eliminate infection upper respiratory tract (like pretty much all). traps virus primes immune system deal quickly vaccinated people never notice. None vaccines produce true actual sterilizing immunity.

Actual immunology epidemiology non-binary. None goals vaccination perfect protection forever ever. Cope mom got 2nd dose pfizer vaccine, I've heard lot different/confusing information protected right second. know seems need wait 1-2 weeks full immunity kick receiving 2nd dose, also know there's buildup protected, fully first, even protected, sure much 2nd dose. basically safe serious illness death point? believe that's Liechtenstein. Throw book family! O’Malley rules! tell speculation? Someone suggested corrective bargaining get power prices putting behind microfiber markets likethe US posts higher prices drugs etc. Edison happening euros comparable degree. It’s outside believe ok. take virus pretty seriously, I’ve gone fishing Friends many times throughout pandemic without feeling comfort zone. try get closer 4 feet them. like 3 teams. lot people always try pretend NYC even majority population NY, Sure Jewish space lasers? problem really answer, need lot people reinfected, determine % serious cases death. 

And we'd enough compared moderate/serious; moderate/moderate; serious/moderate; serious/serious; moderate/asymptomatic; series/asymptomatic. n needs pretty high make analysis. I'm curious folks predicting travel like later year - specifically international travel late summer. 

I family trip booked UK (from USA) early August. August, wife vaccinated (her first shot scheduled weeks), seriously doubt 8 9 year old kids then. vaccine rollouts progressing, optimistic deaths severe illnesses USA UK August significantly reduced (maybe almost non-existent) believe safe four us make trip. optimistic? we're not. Canada get vaccines? diverging strain that's also highly transmissible least virulent *is* scary. think US going fine. countries depending AZ shuffling TL:DR AstraZeneca vaccine basically work new variant, past infections mitigate either.

But yet know prevents hospitalisation death right? that's matters. least leaving 3rd one, better nothing. Yes Singapore one diverse societies earth. Chinese, Malay, Indians, even whites live city-state people Wisconsin. Dead last what? Based Bloomberg tracker aren’t dead last anything. sputnik beep real deal too. can’t help think that, Trump, USA Canada’s back thick thin.

I really don’t feel way anymore. can’t blame them, bit disappointed. I'm still here! Dropping, still here! Closest LongHaulers 10 hours away I’m working John Hopkins Cedar Sinai remotely. High school student community college vaccine math doesn’t add up. all. current rate we’ll hit herd immunity fall - rate almost certainly speed next months.

And 3 shots? Uh, what? report then? could keep lying, notoriously bad troll /u/fredososa Covid disease. SARS-CoV-2 virus. Even mean pedantic, correct use terms. 'collegiate high student'. EU care line. They're going enforce export restrictions skip. fucking kidding, right? virus ""alive"" imitates life constantly morphing due natural selection-like process. We're even remotely sure mutated strains US impact have. There's reason random Redditor making policy decisions that's fucking good.

Reality care believe in. Doctors saying ""you need this"" people ignoring doctor something wrong. worst, selfish side humanity worst. want sooner, wear fucking mask smack everyloving shit anti-maskers. ramping up. We're getting 70k week, 336k next week, nearly 400k week quite par states (even per-capita), big improvement. Pfizer still needs hit 6m doses end March per contract, going ramp even that. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Kansas vaccinating prison population 65+ someone explain ""virtually certain"" standard Florida law? something lawyers Publix made up? sounds draconian can't real. Even pointing gun someone pulling trigger ""virtually certain"" kill them.   Success!!!

Proves point subreddit tbh would made sense last march, august came around voluntarily chose pay whatever price charged whatever services college had. think point number people long covid need support group growing haven’t followed Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine closely others seems Oxfords vaccine turned total cluster fuck cliff notes I’ve seen state (NJ) locked hard we're already process lifting restrictions. NY.

I think conspiracy talk politicians wanting extend lockdowns long possible nefarious reason pretty there. want state economies back normal win reelection. dozens us!! Israeli results show much lower efficacy Pfizer trials. 80%, 95% Pfizer claimed. 

Are sure? read reports exactly effective trials.

As rest, full agree. Yeah I'd rather catch flu live hell forever. wear mask SICK. hope liberal college make us keep wearing masks years, I'd like year normal college see virtue-signaling already.. Israel good place observe happens. got banned! it! think B1 long covid B2 would whatever impact asymptomatic covid.

that said, nah, worry Shrinks gonna clean Nyc still shell former self ignoring data, worrying theoretical potentialities 

Sadly, people afraid terror attack instead real big killers, like traffic household. look stupid shit makes r/all, must always keep mind people film stupid (sometimes even criminal) behaviour. thousands people aren’t dying everyday, we’ll hear different tune.

Right now, near peak, people aren’t really prepared rational discussions getting rid lockdowns.

Which mind you, gone large parts country world, it’s really hypothetical. extent restrictions closed schools (mostly teachers afraid go back), limited indoor dining, massive concerts/crowds. would recalled XX% effective variants? would still useful many places Herd immunity Vaccines approved everyone. roughly 250 million eligible people US I'm sure anti-vaxers refuse. trial, (as far know) testing one dosage, i.e., dosage per shot. point people consider. there's lot things know pandemic lot things don't. lot things specified odds others generalized odds. 

but one thing know, night's sleep important ease mind cost 30 seconds chlorox wipe, i'm gonna it. someone wants ease mind standing 9 feet instead 6, power them. Honestly, best life advice assume everyone online bot, especially anonymous randos responding inflammatory language social media post someone hanging beach.

Never read article comments do, assume fake outrage-bait. definition would go forward covid test AZ permissive, including mild, could simply cough fever, . criteria would also pick cases non-vaccine arm overall fair comparison. study published today see pre arrival b.1.3.51 AZ vaccine ~72% efficacious one dose measuring 14 days (seemingly even vaccine time fully kick in) includes mild 

A bit confused now. sure talking AZ? saying way JnJ's trial conducted, lower criteria could qualify confirmed COVID-19 case? understanding, manufacturers defined covid case simply cough fever etc. know Pfizer did. meantime, convinced savior South African woes current format

Yeah, well, know efficacy preventing symptoms. SA government stated relying JnJ vaccine light news AZ, though. Idk feel that, qualified looks like fantastic vaccine, got surprisingly lukewarm reception 

I really confused bit triggered see compare 89% efficacy Pfizer's 95. Obviously, big diff, shows lack understanding media play huge role shaping public least FDA may shed bit light J&amp;J

YES! Looking forward light shed AZ US trial, design closer Moderna Pfizer trial cov002

Yessss

Now, wanna ask new report Pfizer's efficacy variants. compared AZ regard, describing antibody binding AZ literal small scale trial 1700 participants, right? seems bit unfair compare two. Also, say really use real SA strain antibody binding experiments, rather engineered variant contain SA mutations, I'm difficulties accepting even antibody binding tests SA variant, let alone indicative Pfizer's efficacy variant.

Lastly, would mind sharing profession is? Would like little sense I'm talking to. I'm biochemistry MSc student Serbia. saw another article said NY teachers would prioritised vaccination. It’s worth giving administrators chance that. I’m close it, can’t say certain. Actually, SA throwing quarter wishing well. quit using mean going stop eating salty sugary foods? Yes people actually managing distribution see immense challenge view stadiums effective solution. Agreed. People short memories, COVID invisible us day-to-day. live never happened. Shrinks going make bank misery. find weird American variant mutations made countries less cases. bet SA variant poorly named we’ve states since November. Agreed. done Chargers locker room, nurse miss stab eye it. makes sense, lot people let go ACA BeNgAzi yet Yup. watched three people see every week so. three people see. witnessing turning point, vaccinations given risk rate vaccination distribution increases, slowly going say cases drop drop. event indoor outdoor components, definitely fully socially distant, covid-19 ""safe"" type situation. 

Newsom definitely got recall signatures people saw partaking festivities lot others given up. Yup. I’m real tired “young healthy take low efficacy vaccine, cares mild infections” crowd.

They new “it’s flu bro” people. 

I’ll wait high efficacy vaccine continue protect get one, thanks. even debate. yeah probably so. think brain fog obvious one lived entire life CA couple months ago, nearly everyone know extremely pro-mask pro-necessary public health measures control pandemic, know exactly zero people cannot fucking wait masks social distancing stay home orders go away. Safety measures consistently immediately lightened anytime numbers started improve, people businesses following anyway. saw ample, flagrant disregard safety measures every time left home, never saw enforcement scrub taken. sources level even mild traction permanent mask mandate? seems like irrational fears, something actually risk happening. don’t explain selfish decisions me. Uh, Cal attended BLM rally literally everyone except handful masked conscious keeping distance... no, protests like summer  It’s wsj. expect? can't even confidently say lock H1N1 similar pandemic happened future. main reason lockdowns happen H1N1 literally option time. goalposts must incredibly light. careful stadium choose though. MetLife, vaccine syringe filled hotdog water.  EU already massive Pfizer capacity newer deals. facility upgrade Pfizer facility Belgium increased capacity 750 million per year. Warning: long 

I’ve come realization many people, including know personally, going mentally fcked whole fiasco going distancing wearing masks going parties basically living pandemic life well majority risk population, hell even majority population general vaccinated.

Probably smart tests done kids...SMH. 10 million people, 10% vaccinated since beginning 2021, mostly old people homes...it´s money, politics lies here. miss 2 million doses minister forgot sign paper...we burned 20 million fmp3 masks make place 2 rooms month corona started... kids 12 go school, older ones 2 3 days per week school... it´s f-ing comedy drama...with highest death rate per population. lmao hard see saying 50 comments every thread AZ vaccine. One us needs chill fuck certainly People care race, people victims attacks want race thrown everything takes away seriousness. People sitting comfortable home never issues quick think throwing race everything solution. Yes, that’s EU’s problem. SA variant gonna spread way original variant did, vaccines prior infections produce immunity it. remember year ago, incredibly tiny amount coronavirus Europe? also remember happened 6 weeks that? 

It year people already forgot exponential is. nowhere talk ""trying sell vaccine one dosage solution"". trial studying impacts longer dosing Oh, british, get now.

That's... unnecessarily racist? really, west bank authority gaza controlled Hamas. us get offered AZ vaccine get option getting ""upgrade"" better one later year

My fear won't. Especially mismanaged countries. :/ Spot on.

For reason Pfizer refusing new trials UK SA variants releasing stuff tested petri dishes.

You can't tell petri dish whether vaccine prevents symptoms. person produce antibodies still show symptoms.

Meanwhile Pfizer withdrawn request approval Indian regulator India asked new trial India, Pfizer want Israeli results show much lower efficacy Pfizer trials. 80%, 95% Pfizer claimed. Israel SA variant yet. ever considered pain different person person someone ""complains"" mean dramatizing it? people high pain threshold not. talked goddamn GSK vaccine. know new data.

You sick, know that, right? Chill fuck out, vaccine higher efficacy every comment make.

Is british nationalism offer? dude following comments? took unusual step warning domestic travel Alpine province Tyrol virologists detected surging infections vaccine-resistant coronavirus mutation.  500 confirmed suspected cases South African mutation  detected region, according virologist Andreas Bergthaler Medical University Vienna. makes Tyrol new European epicenter [variant may make inoculations less effective.  year, Tyrolean ski resort Ischgl one first big coronavirus superspreading events Europe, causing thousands infections Germany Iceland Norway.  must done prevent mutations spreading further,” Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said “The federal government warns traveling Tyrol.”  warning issued Austrians across country allowed back store month lockdown.

International travel restricted UK.

Who people travelling UK United States?

Politicians, journalists, athletes film stars entourages, directors, senior level employees, industry experts.

All command highest salaries fields, making extremely wealthy. Poor middle classes Brits LEGALLY ABLE TRAVEL U.S. 

So simple logic, literally fifth grade level, people travelling UK US upper class.

Fuck me, fucking slow. don’t think get recalled it’s effective strains far except SA one. could probably figure way use one effective vaccines booster regards SA strain. 

Although could see US saying approving since enough supply vaccines. Washington state jabs, one Oxford made happens jab stored refrigerator temperatures.

Plus particular jab affective strains comes death severe reactions virus booster jabs developed Oxford SA Brazil varients. Jesus Christ. Pay travel Singapore live month, then.

Yes, I'm basing read also heard firsthand couple people lived there. Obviously relying anecdotal information. opportunity travel around world live observe long periods, well good you. I'm fucking poor.

It's relative comparison. sad reality West free travel year yet jack shit stopping SA variant, delay weeks best. fact border closures generally inefficient pandemics found bloody \*textbooks\* epidemiology.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  yet. Sure, small percentage people vaccinated it’s true, drop seeing right isn’t tied vaccinations meaningful way. Good point. feel like that's something really tracked therefore, way knowing. would made difference? 

They went AZ cos agreed profit let Americans hoard all.

Honestly, stuff people say here... No, like 2 weeks March realizing totally excessive almost nothing reduce risk. point McCormick center limited access due location. think would cluster fuck. However might worth try. think there’s probably better alternatives Chicago. here, extra 5 - 10 minutes make sleep well night worth imo. know nurse worked Covid ward city little said little busy normal.

Anecdotal know.  thanks many people want hear truth interferes desire avoid restriction. Putting fingers ears saying lalalalala going change outcome. making negative sense. true. Cases come every wave. know variants capable producing case spikes. US may 20% population covid. lot tinder still left covid burn through. Thanks y’all. feel like I’m wavering utter hopelessness optimism. It’s like fucking whiplash. Funny say I've wearing non-prescription glasses get covid eyes talking someone aerosols lol know [he got vaccine, still wiping mail groceries. whatever makes feel safe. mom MS people really understand little control health. telling country responsible whole pandemic, country lied everything concerning concerning covid-19 start continue vaccine, still trust say !!

China shut-up never allowed speak Covid-19. world wants learn effective measures control virus, learn country transparent actually handled virus start, country Taiwan china. nope, overall perception (fear) covid far true nature. media blew shit big time want say impossible chances appear small yes. Washing hands generally good advice variety reasons stress washing groceries normally would. realize inside. Even drama read everyone sitting close together courtyard.

I hope political career term way Im voting recall putting GOPer power. entails taking care grandpa?

Because possible, I'd highly recommend distancing inside home much possible. Wear masks, stay separate rooms, etc. definitely possible avoid giving someone live with.

My wife tested positive COVID 3 weeks ago best knowledge, never got it. tested negative 2 days test negative (the day got result back) negative 9 days positive (7 days isolated family). I'm going go 2 weeks antibody test rule possibility gave already negative found positive, doubt case basically nothing whereas shopping, goes PT, etc. ? literally linked article.

Why trigerred criticism one company handled vaccine? entire Northeast. That’s am, haven’t cautious given much last year get 11th hour. We’re close, dammit. Ty much lol power bottoms become powerful possibly imagine. 1. reason China polluting (its actually ""only"" around 30%) produce products for, mainly, western world. could argue actually ""our"" pollution we're end user products produced.

2. actually little bit, largely due lack regulations type fuel (bunker) cruise ships use. Try look many cars worth pollution cruise ship emits - staggering. Trump lost. Time move on... high school goes hybrid March 5th, since parents shots now, feel better going.

Plus, NY prioritized teachers, teachers want shot gotten one think it’s court cases signaled closing without tying science isn’t enough. That’s opinion. positive PCR doesn’t necessarily mean infectious. NYT article August, explains pretty well: get soldier field, won’t work  Same. plan wearing mask 24/7 rest life, someone pre-existing lung issues, fully intend masking every cold flu season on, especially seeing behaviors year affected flu transmission rates. small inconvenience can't imagine *not* knowing beneficial is. :D vaccines use monkey virus deliver spike. body learn detect neutralize viruses, future injections may effective.

That say, limited amount times choice future boosters. may taking 10% protection today, losing 60% future booster rendered ineffective previous exposure.

So, no, necessarily smart take ""better nothing"" vaccine bridge 3 month gap. would exists one vaccine world, sure, almost everything else seems work better. good friend teacher NYC, able get vaccine yet idea able get it, neither boss union rep info. “lie protect China”? was/were lie(s), protecting China from? would happened China hadn’t protected it? Yep! mom’s entire school vaccinated already  Valentines’s Day bulge! allegedly Pfizer one protects fairly well variants. U.S getting back track thoughts masks mirror mine. Robert Redford said masks better vaccine knew idea going on. /RemindMe 1 month Time open live lives then. Yes. change people say developed developing. It’s really rare hear someone use 3rd world country. ever hear (see) Reddit. support restrictions. think unnecessary, usually involving restricting outside behavior.  think whenever possible, try make activity safer rather banning it.  think schools important make every possible effort keep open. Smart Americans recognize staying home unless otherwise necessary best defense, followed masks social distancing, unless vaccine available you. Dumb Americans argue things, like we're seeing Iowa. BUY DIP!! went ER yesterday nearly considered asking HIPAA ask health care workers touching vaccinated. work health care actively touching people, requirement. idea consequences herd immunity via infection continually overlooked threads like this

Because reinfection 6 months renders herd immunity infection useless. Sweden attempting pilot failed. didn’t president then. Ah see coming from, thanks! Fingers crossed even work well mild cases there's significant reduction serious cases SA variant different vaccines prioritised. cow toe

kowtow

/r/BoneAppleTea that's discussed. saying older family member fully vaccinated still safe go see them.

The article right, isn't. Vaccinated people still highly capable transmitting virus even getting sick. article says need wait higher percentage people vaccinated reach herd immunity. cant tell you’re sarcastic serious. But, many times medications processes used treat cancer detrimental effects individuals immune system. even remission, immune systems still severely compromised.  *cries Idaho* banned ~~incoming~~ flights ~~with people originating UK~~.

FTFY ""point"" getting lower efficacy vaccine three fold:

* frees higher efficacy vaccines risk populations.
* (all?) vaccines strong efficacy death serious cases (keeping hospital).
* looking likely even low efficacy vaccines reduce spread (ending lockdowns/travel restrictions earlier).

If really worried, get low efficacy now, months get different vaccine.

Finally likely ""boosters"" different strains improve efficacy vaccines. Long term (next year) suspect ""standard care"" US/UK higher efficacy vaccines. Sorry, here’s ill-fitting polo. Welcome club. Wait til aftermath super bowl parties ones screech loudest ""Stay home, save lives!!!"" shame perceived taking pandemic seriously enough....when look personal lives, find almost never follow ""rules"" social media following looking. matter conclusively studied. would practical assume still level protection, although don’t know much.

The immune system really complicated can’t really tell it’s going react live people long run without waiting see reacts live people long run. seriously starting feel like WW3 virus alliances Mardi Gras, St. Patrick's Day, Memorial Day, 4th July. costs Pfizer Moderna lot money time run trials would need divert resources 

Fair enough - need come say so. Rather pretend data confirm cope new variants **when trial data support all**.

At least Novavax guts run trial variants. vaccine 95% effective original variant, 83% effective UK variant 60% effective SA variant. Pfizer's effectiveness probably same, $hills running around claiming 95% effective new variants despite trial data support claim, stop spreading fake news. definition changed years. Language dosn't change dead.  see posting anti-British misinformation sub daily point. obsessed us? ain’t cute, hun x Arizona running site cardinals stadium. 24h operation roughly 12k shots Pfizer per 24 hours. It’s great site. don’t even get car. opening one Phoenix municipal stadium, ASU plays. It’s 500/d right due supply constraints, plan get 12k well. similar strategy Tucson. forced way article, definitely worth read. actually thorough, dont think trying sensationalist all.  sort pick vaccine US. call around ask vaccine giving out. moment, it’s Moderna Pfizer. good, wouldn’t worry right now. 

The Oxford vaccine due reviewed April, stage options available. there’s rumours US likely approve it. 

Maybe US donate supply Oxford vaccine EU, goodwill gesture. leopardsatemyface material right here. 🙏 No! No! Anything that! top, become bottom.  Bottoms become power-bottoms. Uh, state NFL team and, therefore, stadium? Biden administration plan case? Please tell plan.  Yeah. think probably right.

I think bidens 100 days masks may quickly disappear. Mayish. age like milk find answer question moron? That's interesting. heard theory before. Anecdotally I've seen different experiences among Healthcare workers know. know anyone arm pain round 1 round 2 symptoms vary lot. people know personal circle rougher experiences seem people sedentary (I.e. rehab department managers desk work bad time clinicians run around pediatric patients day got minimal discomfort). job super active fatigue body aches night 2nd dose felt fine next day.

It makes sense someone infected might react since immune system seen already. would interested see data know there's connection. Yeah, impression many people Korea Japan particular actually wear masks protect breathing fine dust. Air pollution big problem many parts Asia. course, also wear masks they’re sick, fine dust issue daily life. Exactly. many way effective ways battle virus using masks. reason many Americans chose ignore focus masks. 

Their defense usually pointing clinical tests done labs show masks effect. honestly, anyone Americans believe normal everyday life different form clinical labs effects masks differ clinical tests? Yah. right (we are, extent) we'll get 40 years progress areas medicine biology. cost.. Due article pointing fact results engineered samples contain full spike proteins went Pfizer site found article January 27th basically states thing however adds company actively studying real world now. great initial news since scientists Pfizer new game would assume would allow public get excited without real confidence vivo trials.

A quote article:

""Pfizer BioNTech encouraged early vitro study findings currently evaluating full set mutations spike protein South African variant. findings indicate need new vaccine address emerging variants, Companies prepared respond variant SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates evidence escaping immunity COVID-19 vaccine. Pfizer BioNTech continue monitor emerging SAR-CoV-2 strains continue conduct studies monitor vaccine’s real-world effectiveness. Pfizer BioNTech believe flexibility BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA vaccine platform well suited develop new vaccine variants required."" take time read article, insightful nuanced. Herd immunity always function # infected + # vaccinated.

I idea consequences herd immunity via infection continually overlooked threads like this. AVERAGING 100k-200k infections PER DAY significant period time. Even look MODEST undercount (say factor x4) entirely unbelievable people realize seeing (and weeks) effects rampant spread past months. country reached certain degree herd immunity via infection.

Unfortunately. that's discussed. saying older family member fully vaccinated still safe go see them. non sense. Also, whole point restrictions overwhelm hospitals. open second longer change hospitals overwhelmed. Understood. rarely comment stuff troll response. need avoid commenting anything like this. Thanks reminder! one mornings (plus, live nextdoor Iowa, essentially affects neighbors). areas winter. Many theme parks north close spring every year. similar enough (which example are), immune system starts huge head start related viruses. new pandemic different enough immune systems starting scratch. case colds flus us related cold flu before. Also worth noting sample size 5% used Phase III trials. error bars probably massive estimate mean, people go out. Someone's exit home limited work back. People may still need go store, pharmacy, etc., yes, definitely shaming sick people without mask future. NFL: Thank vaccinated essential workers, here's 7500 free tickets. We're together. Also, we're inviting 14,000 fans regardless whether vaccinated putting em right other, going bother making sure following rules. we're together. There’s always going reason open schools?! kidding me? want kids back classroom I’m killing high risk son so. Give teachers shots we’re less likely kill families. Allow vulnerable community get shots kids come home aren’t killing families. I’m conservative means, fuck this. early data AstraZeneca vaccine new South African variant terrible. AstraZeneca vaccine can't stop deaths new variants world screwed. think depends person, say isn’t universally true.

I absolutely clue could get COVID today. Period. don’t see anybody indoors masked not. family friends. curbside pickup delivery only. 

If get vaccinated, want able feel comfortable going movie eating restaurant, 65% isn’t going get there. things miss, waiting get better vaccine allow sooner, later.

 I’m worried dying, never been, since I’m young healthy, worried long- medium- term health effects. know vaccines reduce severity, would rather risk it. COVID I’ve knocked minutes/mile runs intention letting “mild” case COVID take away me. magical feeling swamp ass partying thousand people. flu extensive experience know immune response measure relates immunity. 

Could tell level antibodies gives immunity COVID 19? far know scientific community still settled question. still loads unknown what's important immunity COVID 19. correlates measure immunogetically immunity established COVID 19 like something like flu.

For need efficacy data. Double negative, become straight! I've heard many smart people talking like none epidemiologists. line thinking intuitive. There's guarantee contact tracing could lockdowns contain variant variants originals. definitely CCP loyalist, okay, want tangible evidence China downplaying coronavirus ""Beijing took Wuhan? 

here go: 

The Chinese government insisted death toll coronavirus outbreak Wuhan 2,535 around time 5,000 urns delivered single Wuhan crematorium two days.

 Outside one funeral home, trucks [shipped in](http://photos.caixin.com/2020-03-26/101534542_6.html#picture) 2,500 urns Wednesday Thursday, according Chinese media outlet Caixin. Another picture published Caixin showed 3,500 urns stacked ground inside. Chinese publishing interviews doctors damning details sometimes contradict official accounts. [One since deleted censors, alleges official tally infected patients far lower true scale outbreak, citing several Wuhan doctors.  counteract critical coverage Wuhan quarantine, Communist Party's publicity department 300 reporters state media agencies Wuhan Hubei province earlier week.   long after, authorities began turning familiar tool narrative control: Chinese government labs released genome another lab published ahead authorities virologist website Jan. 11. Even then, China stalled least two weeks providing detailed data patients cases, according recordings internal meetings held U.N. health agency January — time outbreak arguably might dramatically slowed.  autoimmune issues well. Hell, currently wear P100 half-mask. certainly think crazy taking precautions.

But mean survey result bonkers.

Personally think lot talk ventilation air filtration/sterilization. could long term solution vs. respiratory illnesses might actually work masses. No, wave isn’t small spike. things you’re calling “smaller wave” weren’t waves all.

As somebody studies disease dynamics, completely disagree. second wave served seeding period third large wave. scientists would also disagree thing national wave viruses don’t care national borders. 

Again, numerous states 3 waves. everywhere? No. mean overall 3 waves. 

And mention, arguing three waves really shows herd immunity levels reached potential waves places single wave small second wave places large first waves subsequent large second waves. time honoured tradition calling ""Hysteria"" ? Hi, sorry, want 1) encourage brigading 2) signal-boost total nonsense. support voluntary masking distancing. restrictions may make sense like putting large indoor gatherings. restrictions even make sense like forcing patrons use one entrance/exit, curfews, etc. lot restrictions point seem super arbitrary evidence say would help lower spread anyway. cancer survivor comorbidity? compromise immune system something?  downvoted?? would mean asymptomatic transmission? guy professional troll. see exactly comment, followed exactly series counterarguments, reddit.

If everyone reported misinformation is, blocked him, signal noise ratio would rise rapidly. Sometimes simplest answer correct one. Maybe seems fantastical, effectively Taiwan, Korea, NZ countries. SARS 03. It’s western countries failed grasp reality situation proceeded let citizens run amok. westerners followed civilized countries lead (like NZ Aus tried do), would past now. retake colonies! costs Pfizer Moderna lot money time run trials would need divert resources important things. enough data know would redundant. AZ deciding conduct trial lab result poor SA variant. case mRNA vaccine Cabin fever? cabin fever?

I wear mask need to, don't, I'm done...I 8 months.

I got coronavirus February 2020 brutal. felt like someone took sledgehammer chest. I'd wake agony 3 weeks rolled over. hurt breathe 2.5 months afterwards. want again, also need focus mental health. I'll tell told coworker May 2020. beat thing staying inside. get sun get shape, get it, beat it.

We knew long time ago people going make pandemic lot worse. part that, time, willing stay inside 1.5 years? know single, would willing see anyone new 1.5 years? Probably not.

Don't let perfection enemy good enough. early graduator, lost sophomore, junior, senior years. impact personality understated, want ""normal"" teenage years, genuine experiences friends. time left kiss girl boy, get trouble, good time gone. adult years starting barely started teen years. 

My parents moved us backcountry, lost dad, going college blind real social situations norms. 

I can't blame Covid surely made life change, better worse. fear mongering getting old Well guess would make life simpler. Still want vaccine though. Interesting article. Thanks. got better things don’t really care opinion. That’s faults worry about.

You want truth that’s responsibility mine. avid anti-vax covid conspiracy theorist know recently nurse. There’s occupation title that’s immune stupid people Nobody except saying that. Seeing year's-worth ""Experts Say..."" headlines make normal human want experts shut fuck up. Yay! drug many years ago widespread turned cause severe birth defects given pregnant women. Many children born without hands feet, limbs resembled flippers.

In United States, FDA official denied application full approval felt safety data inadequate, allowed trial basis many countries approved Agree expanding eligibility problem, especially since recent expansions (restaurant workers, taxi drivers, etc.) even listed sign-up websites yet. far websites concerned, still 65+ various essential worker groups. 

There's literally way know if/when particular group 100% vaccinated, makes sense people eligible less. keep seeing reports ""quiet"" vaccine sites (one near quiet day literally accepting walk-ins eligible people) happening. cancer Variants, strains. No. Contacts contact generally asked quarantine. parents probably quarantine. think there's emphasis masking science support it? I'm really trying critical, want understand gap we're hearing highest levels government across world scientists helm task forces. touch reality makes asshole, guess I’m asshole. opinion, like thanksgiving christmas spikes right? hit day now. Media driven clickbait, nothing more. don’t see downside LGBTQV? indeed times pandemic cases soared deaths went down, remained same

No aren't. Cite state cases soared increase deaths later followed. Shocking news. Sometimes Americans don’t live America. ""But rights!?!?!?"" /s people getting together still suggesting wear masks still used outdoor dining now, city treating people eating indoors. words can't back bullshit unverified right wing nonsense.

Which knew beginning. Thanks proving right. didn’t read article...was vaccine? Why? They’re surging UK, South Africa, Brazil. essentially good research this. research gives numbers anywhere 2% 30%. argument. argument value stadium vaccination drive enormous parking lot NFL venues fit bill. Others far it. parade around NFL offering 30 stadiums talking point. Most/all Midwest fields don’t adequate access parking lots support drive vaccine drive provide logistical support accomplish would huge drain better suited venues elsewhere cities. maybe little less confrontational utter cock head. Honestly dont care, Im glad people fun.

Being house arrest UK makes envy US day. asexual mad told truth? *you even supported said comment!! sorry guy, life hard. look up. not. Don’t really care. I’m sure know use Google. Assuming majority people susceptible virus vaccinated I'm fine 50k. That's less around estimated yearly flu cases. guess I'm trying say 50k people getting covid tens dying per day think society accept that. People understand disproportionate means. Minority groups disproportionately infected mean make cases raw numbers. make bigger percent compared percentage overall population, one would assume would case everyone equally susceptible disease. Hopefully! really miss live music most.  crazy interesting tech. can't imagine levels testing needed though - idea human immune system respond engineered nanoparticle design work like antibody. sound racist Moderna it.

But really know answer whole world needs-- majority even access *first* formula 2021.

I mean... Largest fastest vaccine campaign world history, still struggle get billions people... along comes mutation requires ""Whelp, again!"" Yes, hope quick deal too! Production capacities delivery plans EU disappointing though.  Spanish flu killing people high rate everyone went back wearing masks couple years later. Wearing masks become socially odd short amount time. People wear masks home, wear masks work (unless interacting people), wear eating drinking (duh). small inconvenience wearing mask ignorable shamed public wearing one, social shame disappears people quick return old ways. think may mistaken that, actually. appreciate clarification! I'll go ahead delete comment. comment history fucking horrible one feel iffy AZ - it’s botchy get-go Sorry, adding explicitly say that, might vaccine young people current form SA strain. condolences go guy’s friends family. There’s nothing say. sucks. maybe trying lowkey come out, justify saying got recently vaccinated ??? assholes. Probably talking executive order mask mandate applies federal buildings federal lands would remind lol Negative, got vaccinated first day available requiring take vaccine that's approved emergency use basis slippery slope. reaches full approval required, like I'm required take flu vaccine. Yet trash vaccine technology eradicated many epidemics past increased life expectancy world... Buddy you’re claiming something insane happened. expecting us know insanity you’re referring to. insulting us call bullshit. 

It’s lot easier admit you’re wrong. true. yet evidence vaccinated prevent spreading COVID-19 others.

Seems fairly disingenuous label article saying safe visit grandma live alone saying never visit grandma. Sigh....

Afraid.

Wheres damn JJ vaccine? Cmon man! ""People going die, get it"" 

and people think I'm asshole. Can’t really think worse double whammy get hit by. There's good reason vaccine approvals prevelant variants population. US that'd mean makes sense use Oxford vaccine long B.1.351 mutation common.

The unfortunate side effect protecting entire population one specific variant opens door 351 jump quickly. variants yet seem impact effectively virus spreads, taking current variant leaves entire population people unprotected 351 mutation went mask burning parties vaccines magic'ed away pandemic. Why? happened twice pandemic already...

Restrictions relax cases surge again, even higher before. get difficult, new variants less effective vaccines contagious. experts right concerned. Well, virus vectors, takes time engineer replicate inside cells, many already patented competing companies.

And then, need gene therapy later life? That's vectors developed.

It makes sense everyone tried everything find vaccine, wish people could see adenovirus option really desperate attempts. cycle count adjustment leads false positives, high cycle count detect infection longer spread. dead/alive PCR problem. hotline area? Call.

'Hi im suicidal cant see friends live meaningful life please help' 

'Bro watch Master Commander' states like Florida Arizona?

In Arizona, hundreds thousands people make state part-time home (less 50% time tax purposes) even greater number spend weeks state. 

These residents, large, 65 older counted population many people live elsewhere time. getting vaccinated start going home around Easter.

On one hand, I’m glad they’re getting vaccinated. That’s good thing itself. full-time resident state, it’s frustrating know won’t get allocated “fair share” part-time residents aren’t accounted population. 

There’s never going perfect solution, situations like predictable (the people leave cold states every winter spend time warm states like AZ FL; phenomenon could easily accounted vaccine rollout plans). would probably best interest public health easily quarantine, dont think meets CDC's technical guideline since you, contact grandfather. likely least one variant impacts vaccine efficacy, shouldnt take one want ""Pessimists wrong everything"" line. may well also put up, 

""Herd immunity kick April states hit 15%""

""Coronaviruses mutate quickly enough variants matter""

""Herd immunity prevent fall wave,"" etc. 

No? Improving access interventions placing affordable even subsidized grocery stores food deserts studied, produced expected results. School based physical activity think mixed I’m less familiar that. know children gain weight summer school session.

My pushback claim “government” doesn’t care obesity. believe would accurate say government doesn’t solution obesity. fact times things tried taxing high sugar soft drinks, outrage extreme. still data Sputnik works new variants Thanks. Based live - weve got cases growing....yikes. It’s responsibility keep informed. want ignorant that’s you. Teachers staff? Getting COVID gays, nice Almost like people don’t want lose jobs starve death something! everyone's saying seems like would easy provide one example. covid” caused auto antibodies.

This proven? working hypothesis? 

I paying much attention subject, quick research see issue consensus. would agree, don’t know would call 100k success either. even 50k. super spreader events over. Amazing change That's yup.

I say, ""don't listen [person] anymore"" comments *mostly* spot though. Thank fucking god. Everyone corruptible fear lives. Im hoping news like doesnt deter Teacher Unions.... work healthcare, though anecdotal evidence cases we're seeing hospital New York City declined drastically versus months ago. 10% people

Many may already immunity infected. Damn, AZ's vaccine trash variant? ones far took efficacy hit still worked well enough. uncommon people experience symptoms months COVID. Could also different respiratory illness could psychosomatic. believe there's less 0.01% false positive rate PCR tests statistical reality. nothing faith.

If antigen test, chance false positive rate would significant. Hmm. I'm bi. Wonder way I'll go. :) Trump also tried alongside Xi crimes. Theory? read article commenting on? leader literally said “we need hide data protect China” 

But I’m starting think you’re one Winnie Pooh’s Internet warriors efficacy single dose 3 months 76% old strain. booster point rises 84%. Yes there's probably issue shorter intervals idea boosters never work ridiculous. hypothesis transmission happened transit way eat food maskless indoors ask people speak up. huge deal. likely wear mask public places like grocery stores rest life honestly. Glad hear it. change eliminate PCR testing results positive cases.. yeah, extremely harsh, though drugs gangs made non-issue here(relatively), stayed way barely anyone getting caught executed recent years. 

That's less original point, no? Authoritarianism Gets Stuff Done. Liberal, freedom-promoting, democratic methods always produce better results. (Which worrying think about.)

It's pretty hard compare USA sorts reasons. Sheer size availability firearms, one. 

I mean come like I'm constantly shitting Singapore. I've always thought sounded like pretty nice place live long politically/socially/religiously outspoken. Food Drug Administration announced new steps last week help ensure Covid-19 tests, treatments vaccines stay ahead new, potentially transmissible virulent, variants, whose emergence makes widespread vaccination even urgent. longer takes get virus control, harder may become. soon, problem may vaccine glut demand weaker expected.

After early challenges, vaccine delivery keeping supply. end March, monthly vaccine supply may reach 100 million doses. keep pace, vaccination rate would double some. require all-of-the-above approach administering vaccines, tapping substantial capacity pharmacies, primary-care practices trusted health-care providers.

Especially improved delivery, point, perhaps April, supply start exceeding demand. challenge won’t ration scarce resource, reach patients reluctant get vaccinated. Based latest Kaiser Family Foundation tracking surveys, half Americans say don’t want get vaccinated. may simply want wait; others may set getting it.

One reason hesitancy may necessary ration scarce doses start, causing many Americans internalize idea people may likely benefit deserving others. essential emphasize public-health messaging every adult benefit deserves protections provide, reason forgo scarcity problem solved.

Government every level work many partners possible expand access. Americans take vaccine get comfortable location. everyone willing able line Dodger Stadium. Insurers, pharmacies large employers assist public-health systems reach people every community. 

Medicare sharing health plans data immunization status Medicare Advantage policyholders, help plans focus individuals communities haven’t vaccinated. Medicare also share data primary-care providers. Utah sharing vaccination data working health-care systems like Intermountain, emphasis reaching low-income hard-to-reach beneficiaries. federal government provide financial support technical assistance enable states set partnerships quickly.

Washington also support state local efforts enhance scheduling, help plan far calendar possible. States could, example, send aren’t eligible inoculated current rationing rules vaccine ticket redeemed later. Nobody turned away: seeking dose get something connects future slot.

America also needs effective public education campaign assuage fears uncertainty vaccine’s safety benefits. Covid Collaborative, working Ad Council community organizations, testing educational approaches address concerns doubt, instance, working influencers speak certain groups may reluctant complacent, younger Americans. People 20s 30s, need get vaccinated doses available, may show aren’t engaged—especially prevalence declines it, sense urgency.

There significant gaps vaccination rates across race, income location. Surveys suggest trust also breaks along political lines, many Republicans skeptical getting vaccinated. Even groups eligible now, health-care workers, turning vaccine high rates.

The focus expanding distribution increasing supply. problems soon shift demand side equation. It’s time address next set challenges. deliveries Valneva second half 2021 though 40% delivered 2022. EU declined buy 500 million extra Biontech vaccines last summer, sure UK could bought wanted to. supply issues Biontech either, every week announce production capacity able deliver earlier planned. still recruiting focus high risk people: course. many countries take months, years real choice vaccination. one vaccine assigned group accept it, decline. Yes do. It’s US government flash-in-the-pan consulting firm.

A government contract US Government need guaranteed loan approval fund anything need. mentioned nowhere China getting 100 mil Marbung first 100 mil doses produced Marbung delivered China. said initial doses 100 mil delivered Marbung, means mil doses 100 mil might delivered Belgium Foshun's facility China they're working too.

Yes announced agreement supply Mainland China initial 100 million doses BNT162 mRNA-based vaccine candidate COVID-19 2021, subject regulatory approval. **Initial supply delivered BioNTech’s production facilities Germany.** 

There serious Biontech production facilities Germany, except small mRNA production lines Mainz Idar-Oberstein, output negligible.

The Marburg facility able produce Million doses Q2, EU gets 75 million doses, rest exported.

The fact whole output (taxpayer funded) facility, going EU EU, able secure doses facility much quicker, pure insanity. 2 main loopholes conspiratorial subs well aware of:

1. Sea lion questions
2. Straw man rage

The latter evolved take advantage fact mods ultra strict allowing anyone dare suggest personal fault fellow commenter, even among actively encouraging others break rules, spread bad faith arguments, etc. 

So, target public figures amalgamations crazy people, backfill responses misinformation get pass reporting complaining people make mistake implying might little bit crazy believe hospitals empty, NY hit herd immunity April 2020, etc. 3x plausible. USA reports (in-progress) CFR ~ 2%. Excess deaths vs. known cases raise somewhat; NYT reported 471k January 16. Lab confirmed deaths ~ 400k. 

That CFR rise death trails greatly disease. 3% maybe higher end excess deaths. 

Comes towards 1% estimated ~ 3x confirmed case figure. one said anything forever. people stop dying. Remember back people saying death rate actually closer 0.50% reported 2 - 10% early pandemic people undercounting cases fact-checked ""that's works""? Good you. Seriously. depend state state? people wore CORRECTLY, think clearly demonstrated absolutely slow spread.  Unfortunately, US apply. Thank you. thinking exactly actually, primed UV room sanitizer. hypothesis almost like hypothesis ""2+2=4"".

It would lot surprising autoimmune.

Since primarily hits women though we're going huge debate heads emotional nature. Brace it. big gaslighting COVID long haulers going coming. insane. I'm Australian. town 1 case week. one state weeks outside quarantine. 

I still wear mask grocery store, I've made common sense modifications life (as everyone know) avoid groups/be outside/shop online more.  hard, life happy before, easy modifications.

Why people determined even make simple changes save lives? fuck? fascinating event. also awful, horrifying event. Fascinating means interesting, enjoyable. teacher, know lot them. Also, went planes vacation, got haircuts, nails done, etc. also stated “forced” go back, even PPE, kids spaced apart, low numbers, desk shields. 

I’ve done many things within reason yet happy go back they’re paying me, might well job well. least I’m hypocrite. I've read studies indicated long asthma well controlled risk levels significantly higher general population assuming 20s-40s reddit low risk. Maybe prime pulse ox monitor little piece mind. hope feel better soon. (🚀)^(-1) went go look J&amp;J said 57% moderate severe [symptoms AZ said offer minimal protection mild moderate symptoms. entirely sure ""moderate severe symptoms"" J&amp;J classed ""mild moderate"" small South african trial AZ. Would interesting see J&amp;J including mild symptoms 57% efficiency. small trial South Africa AZ young healthy adults unfortunately can't say sure stops severe cases needs hospitlisations. 

Hopefully studies carried see still prevent hospitlisations Except said 10x, 7x, finally 8x. really 3x?  think might correlation, money cause population density. densely populated areas lean Democratic.  mean....*all* healthcare friends vaccinated, planning baller vacations, deserve. 

Absolutely right 100% back normal year - totally expect people, vaccinated, get back economically. need 100% everyone vaccinated economic recovery start - need vaccinated people enthusiastic consumers rest us wait line. believe made mistake I'm pretty sure vaccine trials basically 0 hospitalizations. Maybe trials include infirm people though.. Guess we're find soon. fact hearing large number deaths vaccinated infirm people great sign! local nfl stadium already relieved deaths going almost forgot realize numbers literally mean *deaths going down.* actual people able continue living actual lives, might able vaccine finished week two later. absolutely ok. death sentence. sick, sick before, come stronger. far, four deaths reported result Sputnik vaccination. Details circumstances available two vaccine group, one death associated **fracture** thoracic vertebra ...  **placebo** group, death associated **haemorrhagic stroke**. 

what want know? hope mean ""Covid-free Corridor"" beautiful. America full glory. Ja, schauen wir mal. Hoffentlich liefert BioNTech die bereits versprochenen Impfdosen die EU, damit die Italiener nicht sauer werden und wir die zusätzlichen dosen bekommen. ;) someone lost immediate family member (who healthy pre-existing medical problems), true. understand people keep saying this. many things factor in: age, blood type, gender, etc. I'm saying now, I'm saying 4-5 months now. naive think vaccination situation then. 

I agree. see situation adjust accordingly. makes sense picking date calendar, declaring matter situation, act certain way. hasnt even 18 months, sure impacted kissing boy missed point. 

Based facts, fact based blood tests, scientists predicted 76% population Manaus antibodies. Similar studies done regions high numbers. we've found simple antibody surveys giving us correct herd immunity predictions.

There's nothing magical number waves. simply looking 1918 flu pretending there's something inherent that. That's numerology. one silver lining widespread autoimmune disorders might actually make bigger priority, might result folks situation finally getting treatments would dramatically improve quality life.

Until then, hope well I'm sorry country routinely fails people position. :/ That's model primarily calibrated around (IFR) give us hint estimate actual number infections assumption number undocumented deaths negligible, though assumption may valid regions. Verity et al. (2020, Lancet) presented IFR estimate 0.66% (0.39%–1.33%, 95%-confidence interval) based early pandemic data China. words, one death comes 150 infections average, suggests worldwide 23 million infections small account 800,000 deaths August 22, 2020. There’s plenty research Consensus surface spread extremely rare impossible. Read linked articles piece instead making number. Herpes live half hour toilet seat course it’s ridiculous think catch public restroom That’s odd!

Especially Buccis initial Note concerns doesn’t mention couldn’t find remark Newspaper don’t mention error all, maybe “Der Spiegel” screwed something - find time tomorrow write them.

I find Enrico Bucci concerns legitimate “anti-Russian-Propaganda” all.

I personally root Sputnik V-vaccine, need right now! death trends lag behind case trends. test positive that's counted right away. get sick, maybe hospital couple weeks die. I'd guess something it. cases dropping while, deaths started dropping. But, expect drop much quicker going forward. Man, I'm sorry hear that. incredibly painful family.  


I can't begin process people insist they're right face this. hard feel immense frustration even resentment, want operate. Yet still see people saying need Lockdowns redditors cat got COVID. Don’t come back crying “moving goalposts” there’s another surge fall brings back restrictions. You’ll done yourself. devastating aspect herd immunity politicians face death callously tell even driving risks. Yeah sounds probable think June provided mutations take hold severely infect already vaccinated infected. believe majority health care workers children already developed immunity repetitive exposure long term care facilities vaccinated exposed accounted 40% deaths. Extreme outbreaks eventually take wave shapes even people know problem is. running easy hosts. people either infected, recovering, personally hiding, fewer people available spreads slowly. 

The United States absolutely brutal winter wave. Lol saying know it. I’m saying reasonably healthy people extremely low risk death virus. 

And record...I go gym every day, run 6 days week, eat healthy. choose take personal responsibility health estimating actual case number always greater reported since started - everything 3x much 10x more. 

I agree. significantly see good thing. 

Other possibly spreading cases, means denominator many equations gets significantly larger, means lower percentage hospitalizations lower deaths rate. 

And might put us closer herd immunity. 

There study released last week India 56% tested showed antibodies. shameful exactly? summer 2020 basically gamble, EU bet wrong horse. made mistakes afterwards sure say 'shameful' bet oxford opponent mrna vaccines, never used way immunizing people. EU messed bad, hindsight always 2020, arm chair virologists subreddit act like easy choice, experts stuff EU departments too, I'd still rather trust them, even mistakes, random reddit. Yes, shaming men ticket. social/environmental/financial pressures cause people act way do. Stupid mens. logic pre-fusion vs post-fusion spikes. gist spiky things virus change shape enter cell also trick immune system. immune system trained triggered post-fusion, antibodies ineffective, may actually help virus infect immune cells.

By using pre-fusion stabilized target, vaccines ensure dont generate antibodies wrong spike. Almost vaccines that, exception ""surprise, surprise"" AZ Nice see year every headline mentioning Wisconsin horrifically embarrassing. That's sus all. diseases far transmissible others. Measles, instance, far transmissible different flu types.

This happens illnesses might produce viruses hang nose throat might need many viruses get illness take hold.

If shows anything, coronavirus far transmissible strains flu. it'll turn meme page. need push restrictions (including masks) removed.

Haven’t done enough damage country already? infectious first 14 days symptoms appear think Pfizer/Moderna vaccine protective.

J+J AZ really aren't. ~35% time still get mild illness, lead effects. wait get effective vaccine--why chance it? I'm going get sick meantime, said, want vaccinated feel comfortable ""normal"" things again. Pfizer/Moderna vaccines 7x effective preventing mild illness altogether. I'd rather wait that. I'm saying now, I'm saying 4-5 months now. naive think vaccination situation then. 

Herd immunity pitch opening up, keeping hospitals overrun is....if think that's true please look literally every state's plan here. plan abandon lot restrictions hospitals good shape....so unless people sub pissed Governments experts, metric using worse?  let conspiracy theorists find this, though.  days row 2 million seems like new normal.

Those two days came shortly major nor’easter shut much east coast days. extra doses lying around appointments canceled days. doesn’t mean expect numbers going forward. get vaccine get sick anyways, still transmit people? way people acting, feeling that's gonna much slow transmission (source: essential worker see way many people nasty unhygienic things time.) really teach people proper hygiene school. favorite team didn’t win game? go burn store community. That’ll stick man sure. follow r/covidlonghaulers people luck trying niacin, low inflammatory diets, even reporting back mRNA vaccines helped reverse symptoms! problem towns across US either mask distancing laws do, fact none laws enforced majority states. live Ohio. drive rural areas literally stores signs doors""We wear masks"". see people ages go stores hourly. look counties number deaths hospitalizations compare population square miles rates much higher even inner cities. words even though they're living close together they're getting sicker dying higher rates. get mad want scream people would good.

This worked well gf I. test constantly negative. traveling, we've able see people. downvoted United States long history eugenics even day see forced sterilisations. 

People color treated way medical community white people system incredibly racist. 

However. 

The vaccines given rich people first, right? means. vaccines given around world people. targeted plan. vaccinating prisoners first they? 

What know covid impacts poor people color indigenous people much higher rate. likely die covid. 

Frankly, honestly, poor person color unlikely front line vaccines. best thing take vaccine. significant majority vaccinated summer...we can't forever, can't people get skulls?

I’m glad you’ve taking precautions, taking vaccine offered next step right thing. aren’t vaccinated, nobody cares caseload/death count pandemic give fuck past present distancing. all. rightfully so. Whatever vaccine would chance getting so, much effective keeping people alive masking. 

I’m glad you’ve taking advice experts thus far, note single expert come said “wait effective vaccine.” horrible choice nullifies good you’ve done far. officially part problem second turn vaccine. 

You selfish, spoiled brat. 

People dying years come countries won’t access vaccine. you’re going sit reject miracle pick miracles. never called anyone before, realizing reserving you: 

You actual fucking Karen. Multiple regulators where? Please include country headline. vaccine available young Americans? I’m happy older folks life gotten vaccine feels like I’ll never get it. title wrong misleading, cases 100k way 27 million.

Did math school Trump?  Doubt M.M. would run republican. read book put months ago. defined center, would see lining democrats republicans. good news benchmark vaccines mild disease (JnJ moderate disease, digress). 


There still lot data formulate certainty, look like T-cell immunity protects getting moderate/severe disease. mechanism action severity COVID pro-inflammatory vasoconstriction feedback loop cytokine storm presence virus depletion ACE2 due binding spikes... even antibodies effective, long enough CD8+ response destroy infected cells body good chance curtail virus start micro strokes everywhere body, 


So given efficacy data JnJ Novavax SA holding hope even Astrazeneca would helpful. Now, since part trial, sure join need booster trial :) information now, going getting beers friends impact others much 1) lot people vaccinated, would made choice 2) vaccine proven keep people dying. 

That true widespread vaccinations herd immunity. true now. unless they're proposing multi-national conspiracy

.. would beyond crazed sensibilities. ;\ Life managing risks, added one risk. agree, right can't open everything up, hospitalization low going back up? want sell ""still can't see anyone even though hospitals fine vaccinated"" American people?

Are people site really deluded enough think anyone going respond that?

This summer, taking risk others yes, likely small risk better alternative another year. Asking people stay away others widely available vaccine makes sense, Maybe people want near zero risk ones stay home instead demanding others do. makes think that? masks Florida, curve follows trend California's Ironic main pic used article reason spike happens next week (superbowl) way rely purely science take one two actions: assume everyone get give up, wait virus disappears completely (which isn’t happening.)

There’s also third option AKA strategy we’re *actually* using: keep restrictions place enough population vaccinated outbreak control. Theres luck involved. good governance vs bad governance.

It 300days making US relatively safe, maybe much sooner depending J&amp;J deployment, unknown point, rest world miles behind point due vaccine hoarding bar Israel essential mass testing ground.

After year pandemic, shouldnt new plans, proven effective plans deployed. I'm disagreeing lol I'm Canadian fully agree. Fuck China. Wonder people getting sick first dose? Going thinking they're protected yet enough protection built up...... Lmao. “I money since don’t money can’t afford private tutor, you’re selfish.”

Probably. count large events conventions, anything California. normal trips places country? Plan it, especially July later. Nope... what? Nope, prefer half million dead Americans shitty semi-lockdown year much brief full-lockdown tiny fraction many dead Americans? 

Or ""nope"" like understand science?  That's true. America developed world? There’s less demand testing due lower test positivity less people getting sick. Getting test easy been. good news! Funny, I've seen better done.

Seen better done where? Add Novavax list too. Also since AZ/Sputnik similar technology J&amp;J hopefully protect severe Covid see. Oh fuck strawman Arguments fucking pathetic. stop already. Nope. see movie, even Tennessee. lot restrictions place over. Maybe everywhere, quite places least. evidence that? What's source?

The actual data I've seen symptom-preventing efficacy across strains Novavax: 96% COVID classic, 86% B.1.1.7, 60%ish B.1.351.  mRNA vaccines actually cause cells create spike protein might better training killer cells thus better - better COVID classic.

We've seen across trials vaccines efficacy rises look severe cases, presumably drops look less severe. still idea effective preventing contagiousness though (contagiousness highly correlated symptom severity really could anywhere scale point).

The AZ press release vaccine provides ""minimal protection"" B.1.351, could easily worse ""worst case"".

And lastly, still zero (0) data immune response getting extremely concerning. Maybe die new variant write ur tomb: ""HE (SHE) RIGHT"" developed world.

IDK dude seen American death amount past year? Alright, another started smaller soccer clubs way make losses getting rely much gate revenue

How exactly make losses?  Anyone else notice US testing done per day tremendously?

The positivity rate dropping well, good, seriously less testing? over. that's unlikely that's already happened.

Not developed world. trending downwards.

Yes, fortunately indeed. mention Josh Allen 😔  None yet unfortunately. enough sample size trial. worked well tried much. get else suggesting, zero covid approach obviously meaningless fantasy. I’ll assume directed person me, yes agree called SA variant? Viruses mutate randomly people infected, higher chance mutations. country infected people? That's mutation likely come from. care functional healthcare system. government cares that. That's public health interventions exist.

The nonsense read fucking stupid actually melts brain reading thread days. I'll stick somewhere less delusional COVID denying Americans. I'm sorry give sooner. 10% done adults. 400M shots I'd expect everyone wants it. likely 80% adults want, 340M shots. Lmao. “I money since don’t money can’t afford private tutor, you’re selfish.”

Get yourself. People suffering extend restrictions beyond it’s necessary going hurt everyone doesn’t share ivory tower. Judging discussion goes here, AZ shot cures Covid19 future coronaviruses. get one vaccine seems ardent defenders. options. equally stupid thinking COVID disappears wished away. little bit both.  Western countries shrugging shoulders letting huge numbers people die year

No, that's unlikely that's already unfortunately that's going away hospitalisations deaths plummet vaccines.

Fortunately trending downwards. business news outlet report business opportunities, even crass? sub shifted running hope best case scenarios long time ago. tried conversation man... mean?  supposed viewers game players?

Right I'm getting horrible sneezing mid-winter allergy. I've wondered kind viral thing bad, really, really bad allergies something makes sneeze ton weeks.

What achey, slightly-feverish symptoms go away day two. think legit colds viruses got torn immune system really got started (I've always called ""feeling kinda virally today, think might coming something""). It’s detected sporadically. would take many months become widespread observed rate, time vaccinating lot people vaccines measured work well it. Believe wearing mask one week year, different wearing every day year Title gore  born mine, idk makes difference. feel you, man. I'm sorry someone ELI5 vaccine production can’t scale 10x every week?

Sounds great! paper showing massively 50% contagious variant kill simply 50% lethal one. Simple thought process: let's assume 1% lethality. start deadly virus. 1.5% people dead first wave 1.5 people dead. R0 2 only, second generation end 200 sick 3 people dead. third generation 400 sick, 6 dead. 800 fourth one 12 dead on... contagious one. first generation 100 sick one dead. second generation R0 3 (50% more) 300 sick 3 dead. third generation 900 sick 9 dead. fourth generation 2700 sick 27 dead. fourth generation contagious one already outpacing deadly one. stopped explodes quickly leads erwhelmed hospitals. People imply can't comprehend exponential growth. Edit let's add fifth Gen see first case 1600 sick 24 dead, second case 8100 sick 81 dead. mean would say looming threat. already country. People already gone back normal life. Sounds perfect honestly Quite often people flair posts good news restrictions increase. South African variant enters room. one’s little scarier long run currently detected large numbers US hasn’t shown proclivity faster spread way UK one has.

So it’s worth keeping eye on; currently looming threat US Behind schedule =/= hard produce Stay course. Numbers falling everywhere globally. Vaccines on-line. got this.

והחדש אשר נהפך להם מיגון לשמחה! Here's hoping true SA. Im unaware comparison like 

I think what’s telling even J&amp;J’s vaccine, one shot uses viral vector approach AZ much effective SA variant. Novavax, thing, two doses 100% severe illness 60% symptomatic infection. hell use AZ? It’s worse Care share link published AZ final results? december ones interim. Mathematically yes, isn’t look it?  JnJ mRNA vaccines decided modify spike, Oxford chose to. modified spike supposed produce higher ratio neutralizing antibodies. looks like might matter Oxford team originally hoped. See standard flu vaccine. R&amp;D c0the covid extremely expensive, sheer number vaccinations needs made every variant impossible path follow. Vaccination, good is, going wreck society even more: Vaccine-only flights, vaccine-only restaurants, etc etc.. now, every update costs 150$? many people cut social ladder. European, confidence either government EU government actually purchase said treatment sun explodes, may well exist intents purposes. gottlieb today saying thing lot us saying: UK variant probably won’t cause another surge US, got late relative vaccination program author good job acting like poor, overworked white people exist. 

Yes, minorities tend face greater barriers care higher distrust healthcare. article addresses issues worst way possible. two facilities world knowledge, equipment, experience manufacture lipid nanoparticles required bond mRNA. Good luck ""literally anybody"" nothing America. typical blame America incompetence. article literally states SA using other, effective vaccines coming weeks case applies since trick immune system. action Outsmarting require sentience. copy week's Spiegel. Drosten Streek record deeming results promising. COVID-19 vaccines still provide immunity COVID-19, giving us degree acquired immunity.

That must SA stopping vaccination campaign. Got it, Mr. nothing inherent COVID-19 makes deadly coronavirus, fact new.

And small issue spreads symptoms show up. coronavirus, worse gets, less spreads people stay home they're seriously ill, selection pressure favours mutations make weaker. one spreads presymptomatically, reason hold back potent get. faster spreads, damage process, damage manifests done spreading. mutates become dangerous, less. US 30 percent population nearly everyone power care keep covid spreading. Taiwan South Korea leadership people seem care. society economy better US. US European countries problems. much ""bad news"" you? always leave sub wish people understood policy questions like restrictions lift definition *not fact,* *should take feelings account*

That said, one sub wants lift restrictions J&amp;J Novavax easy produce offer protection SA variant substantial. offer vaccine that’s worse? work unless plan halt global travel decade so. there's something fucks Albertans Kenney involved, sure cause he's enriching buddies. aware US better EU countries right now? I’m dual citizen, know. Everything’s great I’m still alive... might go downhill wasn’t. given Pfitzer's stage 3 trial lasted 3months, cannot say whether works past period?

That's science works.  don’t think it’s useless. It’s four vaccines, effective SA variant, one cheap two doses cheap ONE dose likely even effective two doses. isn’t lot reasons use AZ. It’s efficacy substantially worse vaccine candidates. perspective, it’s failure. give people two dose vaccine that’s poor preventing symptomatic infection variant another two dose vaccine (Novavax) provides 60% protection symptomatic infection, cheap in-fact even easier produce That's said ""some evidence."" say definitively. Thanks. get approved efficacy clinical setting proved statistically significant. happened 65 plus group. I’m sorry. sounds exhausting. hope things get better you. published results studies met aim filed emergency authorization. Sputnik hasn’t reached milestone. isn’t say it’s effective, indications suggest effective vaccine. keep Pfizer Moderna working higher risk people, start J&amp;J lower risk end. open anyone J&amp;J.

Probably spreading rapidly since summer “All people” vulnerable covid. People 20s, 30s, teens, even kids died this. Ok, it’s rare, it’s still thing. protect people lives we’re talking about. There’s still way predict affect won’t. know long two. sure know one works better get people vaccinated. remedy New Zealand Australian citizens government attempts illegal power grab like one proposed people wanting US federal government enact restrictions legally can’t do?

Pandemics always end socially medically. I’ve detected change sentiment sub across Reddit. OP’s moment reflects growing feeling need return normal assume acceptable level risk COVID done millions years diseases  Qualitative studies definition large collection personal anecdotes.


So also arent evidence anything , consistent logic .


But something tells  60% americans polled state get vaccine.

This project assumes herd immunity.

Ps. Thanks conversation me. Glad downvoting other. Astrazeneca 22% efficacious infection SA variant we're gonna pretend issue Lol someone downvoting you. don’t believe shit second either know case viruses, confirmed here? worst one guy got upset commercials masks Ohh damn good catch sorry read towards bottom talking harvesting DNA only, entire manufacturing process. fun sub, thanks sharing! Yes. Maybe read stuff post? He's talking universal COVID vaccine universal vaccine coronaviruses. work already universal flu vaccine. mRNA technology moved vaccine technology forward two decades. too. I'm like ""They're cutting production 50%?!?!?!?! Da Fuck!"" could’ve seen coming Good time put TIME caps. SAYING! sake baby heart Hopefully trickle countries too. numbers work out. enough antivaxxers stop happening. agree. think Elon genius, wouldn’t inject stuff either :-) 

There lots reputable Contract Manufacturing Organizations there, Pfizer’s Moderna’s world already work with. Seems like lot lined up, everyone realized bad things were.

Not sure it’s vaccines drugs I’m familiar with, it’s multi plant process. make biomass one plant, take weeks. Send another plant process biomass product. gets shipped another plant packaging. So, added time/complexity. Read actual article. says both. promising vaccine variant. work all, news coming today. think vaccines fair? take guess... point I’m even planning second dose. already Covid December first dose shot pretty much second dose anyways. 90% 21 days fucking good enough try friends people don’t tout “mental fortitude” try appear superior fit others understand mean masculinity it.
OP tantrum saying going endanger people's lives pandemic lasts longer whatever acceptable timeframe is. nothing impressions masculinity whatever BS talking about. That's based paper. also article says, terms herd immunity (i.e. keeping R 1), protecting hospitalisations deaths. feel bad. Aside vaccine tossed, what's bad vaccine chasers driving around trying score leftover doses possibly spreading virus far vulnerable. three million Americans died since started. guys hate us much?

Normalizing extremist politicians fun. Normalizing lying political gain consequences well. Playing hate order allow fire sale non-UK billionaires also dumb enough example inspire stupid acts nations well.

I've made view clear US rep, UK rock ocean can't even produce enough food feed itself, trade deals made leverage mind. told 'funny, that's thing parities agree right now'. Prioritization quite attractive was, due complexity delays induces. add context post:

(CDC COVID Data tracker, updated Feb. 7 12:25PM)
Total doses delivered:

Total doses administered:

68.76% doses used

(Florida population age 65+ census 2020 estimate)

32.74% 65+ received first dose series complete. agree really wanted open schools safely we’d close retail indoor dining areas high transmission rates. glad pandemic finally over. We're able hold sporting events hold tons fans, players wear masks, Weeknd wear mask. 

If there's one thing know, know wearing masks actually important fans, players, Weeknd wear them. Right? actually read article , gonna take 7 years current pace vaccinations. logic let's lock people there's cases maybe wear bubble rest ur life absolutely right rest though. means worst certainly first pandemic we've gone through. think whole world change symptom narcissism imo. felt completely fine! Slightly nauseous otherwise fine. hand girlfriend puking night so... feels like mixed bag. We're feeling normal luckily. seems last 24 hours. small cog giant wheel vaccine, crazy witness wonder behold. I’m pretty confident case too. Vaccines + variants won’t entirely prevent infection, probably prevent death hospitalization, especially among young healthy. 

It really Jab OP’s comment, although similar comments shares sentiment jobs home? easy anyone involved, least possible. ACE2 receptor binding domain (RBD) contains ACE2 receptor binding amino acids (RBM) Spike protein. mutant, E484K RBM mutated alters configuration RBM. Another couple amino acids RBD also mutated variants. However, amino acids mutated. person produces antibodies unaltered amino acids neutralizing, there's protection. E484K important though makes contact ACE2. vaccine mutation leading less effective antibodies. clear, that's said. said short term plan focus SA variant, create vaccine works across variants mid-term (a universal vaccine). also work using mRNA technology universal flu vaccine. 

They waiting - developed right now, targeting nastiest variant exists. single vaccine, already efficacy issues beginning. I'm m8 try friends people actually use brains instead believing fairy tales. 7 kids actually got Covid. rest quarantined abundance caution. That's pretty much thrust article, yes. I'm adderall xr 15mg. treated well far finding something else might work even better. I'm joking, i'm deadly serious, sub really troll. I’m teacher. got vaccinated want us back March, second vaccine. makes sense me, thankfully I’m position take leave absence I’m fully protected. Granted even go back don’t want pass students families everyone thinks same. Many teachers planning traveling spring break bc we’ll vaccinated then. never ending. Good think arent vaccinating people spreading it. explains East Asia little damage Corona 19. subject investigation Korean. Prove wrong. stand corrected.  parents teaching entire past year. teachers sure fuck haven't, despite paid usual. (No, 30 min ""Zoom class"" day count.) And? That’s still better outlook last summer. need survive

To *survive* extremely survivable virus. 

*yeah well tell 450,000 Americans who.....* 

People. Die. 

I’m sorry, people don’t see way. Given choice ‘adapting’ extremely unpleasant lifestyle taking additional risk &amp; letting additional people die (by way - vaccines prevent this, even doesn’t prevent infection entirely), choose latter. I’m sorry tolerance risk low, it’s going rough years you. 

✌️ meds may ask? many affect people differently. Also /r/ADHD great community. kinda already that. What's even point cutouts though? Imagine risking life loved ones' lives gather watch boring sport planet. Yeah, right. Awh feel sorry Canadians. Bet ton money come flocking America get restrictions. long ago friend mine’s 16yr old son shared (on Facebook) video security guard South America somewhere stabbed death, immediately reported there’s way stuff like social media. Facebook messaged back week later say reviewed footage didn’t break rules wouldn’t anything it. footage recorded CCTV camera small amount research confirmed genuine. Makes sick think mans death shared people’s entertainment.

Facebook police site allow anything everything distributed, absolutely respect site anymore longer use it. It’s still true information. policies haven’t even started take effect yet lol come on

And crux problem American voter. Decision-making one thing, implementation another altogether. competent leader take mediocre plan run it. Clipped-bait got mine Rite Aid online form ask race, check prefer answer. One word: Tylenol. SARS1 came Taiwan, ripped new one. multiple plants involved I. supply chain manufacture vaccine. articles don’t say function specializing in.

The best description seen Derek Lowe’s debunking “let everyone make vaccine” Cruise ships deserve banned environmental reasons. arguing nearly many people give shit getting tested anymore. local free testing site went 6 hour car wait way mid November day xmas. theres tops 5 cars time instead thousands. Tell me, make feel superior others mocking feelings don’t match impressions masculinity? number “cases” completely meaningless metric. vulnerable population vaccinated little deaths hospitalizations, obviously need lockdowns. think best strategy assume...

I think best strategy pass ""expert"" opinion things know much about, rapidly changing active research. Agreed. whether catch covid, affects you. J&amp;J basically patients caught covid end serious symptoms. maybe immune almost definitely feel like caught cold worst, fuck it, I'm in. Fair point QA/QC vaccines. wouldn’t inject anything hastily made Elon Musk veins. Lol. 

It’s still crazy we’re another trillion two stimulus go last $2.2 trillion spring. handing tens billions pharma companies along keys empty manufacturing-ready sites federal property. Set aside billion clean mess afterwards. Accept failures. shave 6 months thing easily worth trillions. Huh? think confused get help. Nobody saying think saying. Vaccines going huge getting things back know normal.  going getting vaccinated every year covid? Maybe. cares? get flu shot every year, too. You’re excited March 4th, bet!

GQP! GQP! year one step back, two steps forward type thing. setbacks don’t really matter much there’s always lots progress made. HOPE GONE SWEAR REVENGE, HEAR OATH ""Thou know’st ’tis common. lives must die,

Passing nature eternity."" 😤😤😤 haven’t seen article posted 1000 times today Well didnt vaccinations then. There's difference one two people know dying year *list* people know died year. way live normally happen areas. wishful thinking. Testing treatment worked much current strains, would suddenly effect strain? vaccines work specific strain measures relaxed, strain spread exactly original one year ago. zero real-life evidence contrary. see way people saying wearing goggles protect eyes infection point covid lol. Like, guess possible, ever happened even did, likely it? people want come vaccine, vaccine come people. Thanks. different things like flu/cold get touching infected surfaces ? Yeah man can’t believe United States isn’t island 2500 miles land spread population 7 million. ""grandma"" needs live ""3 months"" might sole caretaker school-aged grandchildren. death would devastating grandchildren. happened neighbor. think could point vaccine also stopping transmission level? know definite studies, I'm rooting case. know hospital trying allow visitation. difficult though. allow patients permissibly hypoxic, distressing families. patient alarms go family freaks get upset don’t anything. it’s disease process.  desat intervening means escalating care possible putting vent. 
Then family member want feed patients. come vent, always yet. still shaking sedation. Family excited “they made it” want give something, patient ends aspirating. older covid patient need dedicated swallow study aren’t leaving ICU got there. I'm talking current events.

But yep, course british.  think big worry push back whenever see someone post something pushing doom. know think that's funny, troubling fuck important vaccine this. 

Just anti-UK stupidity. can't self isolate though, people still working live someone still works? New York, New Jersey, California.  much leaders want mask mandates forever. ever good opportunity repeal them. honestly think vocal crowd insists need masks zero-COVID, obviously never happen, support masks forever. vocal mask supporters paint leaders literal murderers moment drop mandates, states deeply entrenched mask politicization. No, far i'm aware even one confirmed case surface transmission like that. science guessing efficacy? AZ data that. I’m honestly careful lot people know shriek 24/7. wear mask, hang boyfriend, fun allowed, bullshit. never talk except doesn’t feel like right thing anymore, it’s something I’m told it’s right thing. cannot understand people get (at least claiming to) good little restriction following noodle. I’m miserable uppity it. Yeah can't deny that. I'll using method weeks. exactly kind assumption warning against, speak confidence. 

Very well! Since clearly open mind, shall say more. Vermont full lockdown since early November end sight OK, maybe misunderstood you. think virus really never go away restrictions done summer.  strategy solves exactly nothing. Really hope hybrid model make classes smaller-Only smart way it. NYC well. I'm worried theaters also 5 restaurants closed neighborhood, including favorite. super sad. I'm guessing uses deactivated versions virus Moderna Pfizer use virus's RNA first that. Totally fine, don’t expect everyone that. especially true populations high risks severe illness vaccinated gate. Even rosiest assumptions twelve-week gap put people considerably higher risk two months. Reddit really seem allow much space nuance, something particularly important discussing science.

So instead end people shouting extreme views, getting upvoted others confirming bias. long would keep people blanket ban? many months better vaccines available? still wiping things like groceries, take ? great. actually get vaccine defense walls, new virus grow become big others now.

But takes way time compared X strains going around, time thing atm, would indeed great. Canada literally mocked us said retaining critical manufacturing capability national security priority. ""bUt WoUlD nEvEr AtTaCk YoU.""

Now get understand that's important, right. nothing attacking one another. Maintaining domestic capability key areas well-run countries do. I'm sorry pandemic, officials Canadians elected stupid comprehend that. kept sanitizer car wayyyy pandemic used flu season gas pumps grocery shopping. works fine! said outside distanced, pictures came inside close together. weren’t even aware joe Biden cast doubt vaccine politics. won’t question read. long name I’m sure best interest mind political power. 

Just wait war starts. SoUtH AfRiCaN StRaIn wAiT n SeE!!! might continue hear consume lot news don’t think it’s going big factor individual behavior formal reopening daily deaths hospitalization low. person said.

We're buying crap ton really good vaccines. US track record vaccinating lots people short amount time (we 190m vaccinations EVERY flu season).

Social distance, wear mask necessary, wash hands dont lick door knobs. depends where. US, mean much. fine without it. Europe developing world, would major shock. Yeah I'm going trust scientists rather people sub due respect. Remember, also extremely border closures winter too. much constant drum beating sort restriction movement contribute spread? 10% would seriously considering starters. Secondly 10% aren’t great odds associated risk involved. know are. may, vaccine resistant No, point would par something like H1N1 lockdown that.  Funded tax payers fuck yes used. suspect give sort knee injury. idea compulsory Yellow Fever vaccinations existed decades, travel tropical nations. J&amp;J game changer US. another tool belt.

They've botched production roll-out far behind main catalyst US. Biden announcing additional 200M vaccine purchase Pfizer/Moderna seems show much confidence J&amp;J come promise 100M July.

Also, surprised US quickly pivots double dosing strategy ENSEMBLE II comes back better results.

It nice third approved vaccine, going game changer, going good healthy improvement. Chicagoan, definitely say I'll wear couple cloth masks face covering brutal winter days I'm feeling well...but that's it. Hopefully also filter little bit pollution sucked lungs daily basis too. mean “rub dirt it” “walk off” aren’t effective treatments? Nope. *dips* points due decreased testing holidays, dip, cases continue rising before, making look like spike. take account, looks like normal seasonal curve.

The curve hospitalizations, least affected sort noise, shows absolutely zero spike around dates mentioned, long, steady increase October peak January. thread full people ready jump bridge variant news. many posts like ""Feeling terrible variants! hope!""

People respond data based replies showing vaccines work well variants prevent severe disease, hospitalizations deaths, responses usually ignored.

If ignoring data, worrying theoretical potentialities like variants merging, think need consider maybe want feel scared hopeless trying justify feelings.

I'm meaning sound uncaring incivil here. know hard year negativity easily becomes habit. I've there, way notice pattern set head biased towards negative stopping it. delusion right here. really know AZ/Oxford prevents deaths, right? Nobody died vaccinated group, nobody died control group either? median understanding probabilty fluid dynamics. Super computers predict weather inaccurately still. aerosolized covid virus.. expect worse mask up.. detect new scent mask probably close. bothers much. honest don’t do. don’t hide lot things others aren’t comfortable with. don’t shame anyone things I’m comfortable shame anyone would consider cautious given risk profile. SICK DEATH social media virtue signaling. It’s scathing it’s words platform make certain people feel morally superior turn around go things criticize. least stones upfront don’t don’t sit twitter telling people exact shit turn around do. Hypothetically, big blow think it’d public confidence Covid vaccines it’s announced AZ’s vaccine recalled? I’d say Oregon pretty locked down, don’t think indoor dining allowed, think businesses allowed 25% capacity, varies county county. think counties starting open schools. three reasons we're gonna continue hear justifications staying locked long possible:

A) SA variant
B) Long-covid
C) Possibly able spread virus vaccination

Am wrong really worried things? lifestyle change entire situation needs become permanent. can't imagine ever going office anything slight cold anymore. Hmmm, probably explains SA's cases plummeting month 🤔 must getting reinfected No, really. -10F so. Anything increases uptake good book. new normal? living meme world notice Mods, please ban user? He's posting nothing fear-mongering articles multiple times thread past days. states want mask mandates forever? something anyone, especially state government saying. I'm curious see predicted huge spike cases new variants becoming main variants united states happen not. I'm one mass fear mongering maybe, maybe, would've made people *at least kind of* frightened deadly contagious virus we'd better shape

Worrying frightening people something kill loved ones insane have. that's extremely unlikely. suggest research. Take care! never come across *anyone* wants lockdown forever.

I know people think thousands people, statistically speaking probably vaccinated, mixing together outside stadium dumb.

And agree that.

Social distanced, half vaccinated, crowd open air stadium? Fairly low risk. rewarding essential workers free tickets? Rock fuck on.

Skeeter screaming ""GOOOO BRADY!!!!!"" face surrounded people wearing masks crowd? Well maybe need talk one. clearly psychosomatic. See psychiatrist.  way lie it? Students need refuse pay full price tuition offer full amount services opportunities students. Anybody else remember Trudeau mocked U.S. using defense-related logic protecting critical industries?

Remember played dumb pretended like considering Canada adversary, reality logic basically ""we want self-sustainable critical imposing [10 percent tariff aluminum imports Canada, well 25 percent levy imports Trump cited need protect U.S. “national security” dangers excessive dependence suppliers like Canada, Mexico European Union. administration argues increased imports led closing U.S. steel aluminum plants, leaving U.S. industry risk becoming unsustainable, thus threatening national security. 

Welp, maybe Canada comprehend (obviously difficult) concept self-reliant critical areas. meant local tourism locals Caymans Aruba, BVI whatever running show rather cruise ships, local Canadians. Based projection, I'd say end May. Really depends college guess next fall normal. expect summer demonstrate mostly back normal people lot comfortable. sub downvote anything takes coronavirus seriously, especially thread, surprised. 

Good luck, likely okay, blatant lie call safe. Know risks, make sure get tested afterwards possible. I've hikes last year friends, without getting tested, would never call safe. think wasn’t actual game parties happened Tampa. women know ‘long covid’ serial mothers meeting complainers. 

I’m saying it’s real many people, women know work moany like complain every ache pain dramatise lives. read comment, could misled thinking sort data all, don't. 

I highlighted response comment reason made comment clarify headline. country Sputnik AZ. AZ useless Sputnik still tested new variants. first-world countries luxury mrna vaccines. essentially immunity it, yet still highly transmissable, matter time students... glad they’re ones there. I’m assuming teachers staff fully vaccinated. No? spikes New Years, Christmas, Thanksgiving? looks like leak. Oxford released press statement saying ""minimal protection"", I've seen show journos screenshotting Zoom call showing 10% efficacy B.1.351 variant (23 placebo, 19 vaccine). expected(at least expect), but, please, get it.

FYI, redditors, AZ vector vaccine can't easy updated effective AGAIN. every new strain need booster, based yet another vector, a) expensive b) complicated c) may impossible. story russians J&amp;J.

&amp;#x200B;

mRNK cocktails Biontech/Moderna/Curevac probably peptides Novavax problems design. buffets thing plague Justinian, Antonine Plague, black death, smallpox, polio, spanish flu, flu season, AIDS, yellow fever? 

*This* particular pandemic one makes *buffets* disappear forever? think that's likely. comment respect history. Stop acting like world started 2019. Reddit loves virtue signaling covid, swear people bragging going house 1 year ago Yea get either. guess could say still many people risk elderly still unvaccinated *could* overwhelm hospitals done end February. Even excuse flimsy best.

Widespread medical collapse never happened. soon: Pharmacy Zone Best Buy.

On one hand, price match Amazon's prescriptions chance try commit.

On hand, gotta wear pants best buy, cool Amazon Air dropping drugs via drone.... “Long covid” caused auto antibodies. 

Women also much likely auto immune disorders men staggering percentage. omitting breaking Covid protocols lying it. Let clear, furthest thing conservative, there's something said holding politicians accountable, particularly hypocrites. people super concerned early taking precautions well-informed compared general population.

As time goes by, well-informed people began realize restrictions need end eventually. people listen whatever fear-mongering leaders news channels say still convinced COVID plague. Antibodies part immune system pure BS. antibodies disappear completely, body left defenseless.

Also decline mean go away. Something decline forever still never reach zero. Covid milder flu children. Obviously would great vaccine them, need lockdown every child vaccinated too. Mostly people overreacting. set get 4 million Pfizer doses end March steadily getting them. Pfizer announced moved ahead updates (that previously planned) Belgium plant increase production meant temporarily reducing production weeks.

Pfizer said Canada would still get full 4M doses end March it'll less end Jan / beginning Feb they'll send larger shipments catch what's happening.

Canada kind get screwed supposed get half shipments slowdown EU pressured Pfizer keep EU shipments large possible Canada got cut.

In reality though makes little difference we're talking 750k doses delayed 4 weeks population 33 million. screw roll provinces good groove administered 90+% doses Canada always set recieve bulk orders April June anyways forced Republicans morons community care facts cause effect. hard understand people want change virus does? ""Appeal false authority"" logical fallacy reason.

Newsom lifting stay home orders. Cuomo pushing indoor dining. pushing in-person school. Face it, Governors done COVID restrictions.

What people want changes virus affects daily lives. 

The people NZ wanted obey hard lockdown strict quarantine therefore virus gone. people USA wanted soft lockdowns lockdowns therefore virus still one arguing morons ignore expert opinions. mean good idea.

Irrelevant. Rules rules law law. indoor dining allowed, illegal go restaurant therefore people so. 

Are saying Governor Cuomo Governor Newsom morons wanting re-open everything February? Face it, Governors done COVID right. Morons stupid shit time wishing morons stupid shit asking stop work. Shame, it?

Glad agree nothing say matters fucking didn't. things shut necessity, blame Biden either less. They'll still morons. still using logical fallacies try justify (and your?) moronic actions cost lives economy even more.

No matter color state, everything re-opening February. Face it, Governors done COVID restrictions.

Pushing restrictions brand new lockdown something absolutely politician wants. citizens want extremely fringe minority. 

Everyone agrees life resume even wear mask weeks. re-open side I've said elsewhere, like saying save money car maintenance. Strictly speaking, that's true...up front. exceptionally stupid think beyond tomorrow, doing.

The vast majority people flawed metaphor money maintenance need drive TODAY. 

Long term planning what's needed right now. certainly one. believe CA homegrown variant. even know SA UK variants started countries; ones sequenced variants first.

But there's thousands variants viruses. nothing new nothing science already figured out. immunity booster shots viruses. evidence statistically backed racial disparities vaccine dissemination compared demographic makeup high priority workers needing vaccines  However latter going confounded insecure men refusing show weakness talking mild lingering fatigue - could bad reality.

Yes, shaming men ticket. social/environmental/financial pressures cause people act way do. Stupid mens. effectively ends us something “serious” get type scenarios allowed us live flu deadly virus. steady supply vaccines, majority people taking them, type good treatment worst happens (i.e. Tamiflu flu).

Watch quick masks social distancing goes away soon restrictions turn light recommendations people become vaccinated. debate shift “Should mask worn?” “Should mask still worn?” progressively gets harder people proponents masking social distancing time. grey area start March 2020 life March 2020. Wow miss kind partying much. try positive outlook letting sensationalized headlines shape world view. Vaccines available tool haven’t previous holidays surges. vaccines far gone vulnerable groups people highest risk serious illness death. spread resulting super bowl? course extent. result surge hospitalizations, deaths etc previous surges? Almost certainly not. one claiming vaccines going totally eradicate virus time soon certainly help avoid extreme outcomes you’re imagining. Placebos might help perception symptoms, cannot prevent infection hospitalization due serious complications. Placebos might change mind reacts viral infection, change virus operates. related:

Vaccine production sites raises order 100 million Valneva COVID-19 vaccine also known Valneva COVID-19 vaccine, COVID-19 vaccine candidate developed Valneva ""all us""?

There many countries global south cold-chain infrastructure massively distribute mRNA vaccines even supply available them.

A global response would require wealthier countries giving aid countries build infrastructure. California - restrictions day day made sense. understand like every state, went plan slowly opening things suddenly indoor outdoor, everything completely open, jarring. recovered since. really wish they'd also look period issues covid. seems royally fucking women's cycles. one keep hearing stops, comes suddenly extremely heavy longer normal.

It'd nice know something specifically covid sort stress response, though really enough research general able figure out. wish people stupid weren’t allowed work healthcare setting. It’s unbelievable many excuses people come believe this. parents won’t take vaccine cause saw video someone pass taking dad would rather take chances “99.7% “ survival rate vaccine. tell cases plummeting deaths follow soon, say people still die things they’ll mark COVID death stats won’t actually plummet. can’t fix stupid. challenge urban area.

Tampa NFL teams allowing fans while. He’s hungry man love blames vaccine... That’s true all. live border mass NH states operating pretty much anything want within reason. Persians hot. Maybe finally get man. twitter thread points out, though, serious problem non-western countries cold chain infrastructure mRNA vaccines. really relying one working out. wasn’t Thanks info! Yay!

Holidays spike over. mini super-bowl spike! track open Spring? NEVER plan general population (adults 65 essential workers) even slated get turn late Spring, like May-June. 

I think autumn we'll looking for. expect summer 'normal' year active pandemic that's slowly dying? one that, continued vaccinations, result spooky strains really spooky want be? said implied people know ""open"" means. do, they're experiencing total lockdowns. Lincoln Financial workers split two groups. One thinks Steve giving shots. thinks Janice better it. actually get piece cardboard “Dallas sucks” scribbled it. There's absolutely going one spike super bowl yesterday depending speed vaccinations vs rate mutations could linger. BUT, think right first real sign long term progress. Ahaha gonna best 4 years ever! Hogan freakout cases reasonable, maybe lax opening times.

Once hospitalizations keep downward trend February, I'm sure he'll retract restrictions. Expect Montgomery, Prince George's, Anne Arundel, Baltimore City maintain restrictions. don’t scale. Trying move locate vaccines many different place require resources putting one big staging area. exploitation workers American billionaires makes Walmart uniquely American, location. going worth restrictions another Summer.

my mental health pretty frayed already. dont' think much longer. people know including taking seriously. rural PA location I've seen mask wearing increase last several months roughly 90% WalMart. workplace remains remote person scheduling. public outings remain significantly limited.

OP rewrite title, reuters' title.  forgot Casmir Pulaski Day Illinois. People get WILD Pulaski Day!  travelled see family twice partners' family once. Quarantine 10 days &amp; get tested flying ask sister quarantine well possible. Also get test days arrival since average incubation time 5 days. would stay sister younger like flight week, get another test, got negative test back I'd go see parents. 

Testing pretty much ramped parts USA finding free tests quick turnaround times easy. 

Like commenter said, travel part actually riskiest part. multiple groups people coming together.

I stayed far away others airport possible wore KN95 masks.

Another tip: even pre-select seat plane purchase flight, check flight morning see seats filled empty. I've always done changed seat row looked emptiest. usually back plane mind. Biden’s woman monarch lol. still recommended isolate two weeks traveling via plane? overkill point? (This US). friend mine bubble recently family member fly town stay them, flying meeting. I’ve planning keep distance two weeks returns, wondering I’m overly paranoid. I’m low-risk, regularly see parents 65. Yeah! *dare* assholes request given chance ... \*checks notes\* ... LIVE! rude. 
/S necessary wear mask time. 

Now sneezing/coughing - absolutely wear mask public. 1.5m vaccinations yesterday :/ really thought we'd turned corner hit 2m Right, Florida already acting way months. foreign correspondent UK earns upwards £150,000 per annum, placing FIRMLY upper-class tax bracket.

Once proven rank fucking average imbecile. lockdowns west coast, New England, NYC, etc ..

Even flyover states remaining restrictions various kinds little way mass gatherings. also two kinds people places, every person still dining there's another gets go.

There still schools hybrid mode virtual everywhere. free behavior except places like South Dakota. dense population serious people take it. low pop density bit safety net.

Now holiday spread getting back better numbers. problem equating improvement longer need anything. need keep things numbers low. Yeah, makes sense. 

Are incompatibilities likely different types vaccines? Like vaccinated half country AZ limit roll afterwards? I've proud well things handled compared places now, part.

We lot people due Chicago, going issues. Things could better, sure, first time like: cant believe messed badly. That's weird thing, even think 72-70% people *here* would go far. (Depending mean ""after COVID-19"", guess) Fuck yes, pedal metal baby! nice others give us date returning “normal” still active pandemic. Epidemiologists given us date, virus not. Well arnt sweet sugar🙄 unlikely worse Johnson Johnson's 57% SA variant believe, Novavax's 60%. I'm expert 95% efficacy extremely high starting high point would surely give advantage even SA strain somewhat resistant (although can't say sure, expert).

However, would extremely surprised much higher 10% efficacy SA variant preliminary Astrazeneca data much worse peers tested huge difference big impact. 60% efficacy far good enough achieve herd immunity 10% much better nothing. would happy two things stick around:

1) Washing damn hands.

2) Wearing mask symptoms.   sound like someone never actually left US. Yes, yes. contract English law, right? everybody knows British sovereignty simply best sovereignty. sovereigns go whistle behave unfair enforce laws. understand downvoted, everything said true. :/ lol People don’t give shit warnings. close borders. Coworker saying numbers it’s post-election don’t need “fake” numbers Trump loses anymore. work healthcare. I’m PA. I’ve seen individual restaurants impose dining time limits there’s mandate it. one place three nights week busiest days get 90 minutes, fairly reasonable IMO. Seriously. Life ""normal"" NY trip CVS become fun. not? people may drop quickly others might well stick it. Also, likely Covid-19 disappear suddenly drastic change, likely tapers out. also probably keep reduced tolerance coughing people work such.

Just data point have, traveling Bolivia long-distance bus 2011, got stuck mud road rainy night. Passengers tried unstuck bus shovels, knees-deep mud. Among young couple Japan traveling face masks. Keep mind 2011 SARS outbreak ended 2004. drop masks once. point always holiday occasion people gather around corner. Don’t make reason live constant fear data shows us things improving vaccines help continue trend. part people gathering holidays super bowl would gathering anyway taking proper precautions. Would lengthier period time covid vaccinated reduce chances side effects? Thank you! I’m really hoping get vaccines CA soon. SA probably dropped dominant strain right useless. dominant Europe North America. think thr UK door door testing/hotel quarantine hopefully thst prevents SA strain becoming dominant atleast months. guess UK/EU continue use AZ vaccines arrive like Novavax/J&amp;J abandon AZ. AZ still works dominant strains it'll help SA strain becomes dominant work. Yes, that's point. 

I've seeing people confused this, they've heard vaccines protecting severe cases. sorry wife. tragic. Agreed. point, favorites Pfizer, Sputnik Novavax (the actual best vaccine right now, best efficacy different variants need ultra cold storage) Every single thing normally NY fun closed year, operating limited way pointless do. Rep Ron Wright Arlington died Sunday night battle COVID-19. 67. *researches use masks firework fuses* turned 21 May. Never thought would anything like this. good news Moderna already updating vaccines address South African variant.

Getting hold ""standard"" variants US much world (even including UK variant) would buy us precious time roll updated boosters South African variant.

We know develop vaccines thing. Time finally side. need patient, buckle bumpy ride.

\*edits clarity. Every time someone brings ""two weeks flatten curve"" want bang head wall. point y'all willfully misunderstanding meant. Crazy coincidence peak 10 days New Year's. think set concrete threshold reopen. like checklist rolling average cases/deaths percent vaccinated. meets 3 start phased rollout easing restrictions. Im talking big holidays states people actually gather for. idea leif erikson day lmao Sources?

Israel used Pfizer one, completely different there. AZ best shot covid cause 70% countries cant use Mrna type vaccines (logistics) AZ never ""promising vaccine variant""... Ok well show falsifiable hypothesis structural racism studies prove it. How’s Heath system at? get post covid clinic! Limited data, encouraging. find agree. also think unfortunate analogies invoked justify preventative measures like masks. often hear seat belt laws “no shirt, shoes, service”. examples certainly support invoking measures public safety, think side effect conveying permanence masks, distancing, measures. all, seat belts aren’t going anywhere. see people get anxious come away understanding masks distancing permanent. know check sometimes tell it’s permanent. think aren’t lot good analogies experiencing, really unprecedented people’s lifetime. consequences inaction real.

I'm arguing right now. problem many countries rely AZ available doses climb suddenly choose stop (or reduce) AZ administrations. UK instance probably gave half doses far AZ. EU relying **a lot** AZ. suddenly good *enough* anymore, problem.

I perfectly happy 60% efficacy, even news 82% 2 doses three months apart 76% 21 days first. news *bad*. 22% insufficient herd immunity actually press sars-cov2 make SA variant become dominant one, since others stopped vaccine. many people willing vaccinate booster soon possible taking this? take priorly knowing they'll take booster months later? makes sense...

Of course summer glorious, covid variants gone. low transmission covid air like last summer, it'll transmittable variants. 

This really seems like twist plot. flu comparison appropriate here- \~46000 people died flu 2018. That's 1.5 9/11s month normal year. number took lives year well. 4 9/11s happen month unintentional injuries, majority road accidents. things considered Covid look bad killed 100 people day flat rate per day.

I understand coming 9/11 appropriate comparison here. deliberate attack, made consciously people wanted hurt Americans. disease. worry happens. God Twitter fucking cesspool. many people want new normal last forever, even won’t admit it. Buffalo bills would like word  don’t necessarily disagree flies face immense panic creating variants, need get front avoid worst case scenario. agree isn’t ton evidence support delaying second dose but...idk...sort annoys me. wave big, 20+ cities infected. wiped, again. Lunar New Year back hometown seems impossible many people, local events still possible available. triple infections knowledge.

We know people ChAdOx1 got B.1351 get Neucleocapsid antibodies. thanks! definitely eases mind bit. i’m sure we’ll within 6 ft hiking, imagine wind &amp; droplets won’t get far. (hopefully) Dr. Osterholm thinks done immediately vaccinate twice many. says hurricane waves coming mid late spring. dunno think people esp English fighting France absolutely stoked something born die poverty 30 years old know super spreader is. study seems indicate also super mutators. immunocompromised person's body allow infection persist much longer weeks, unlike long haulers, long term symptoms damage done initial infection. information could potentially cause immunocompromised individuals go front line vaccination, assuming could handle vaccinated. may also offer clue influenza viruses achieve mutational capabilities. interesting observations. statement childhood friend, collegiate high student: ""My 60-year-old professor informed age group getting vaccine late year. three shots. Biden giving one shot everybody, that's it. gonna take well next year. likely online next year.""

I need know hell going on. people act like power force everyone stay home, yet can't take time study vaccine information, tell truth, convey hope.

over/under 2.5 people national commercials wearing mask worked New Zealand, Australia China. employ strict border control. essentially took preorders funds. Nothing wrong that. 95 percent chance contracting covid someone give take. 

Do source claim? understanding (possibly dated) 95 percent applies experiencing severe symptoms. literally love comments you. Pure genius exactly feel. People spewing comments like “no it’s actually good never go outside again. Fewer carbon emissions!” proven is, *yet*.

But much safe assume wide administration AZ vaccine population give evolutionary pressure SA (possibly Brazilian too) variant(s) become dominant one, since normal UK variants still well managed.

Luckily AZ vaccine available, lot doses it, many countries relying significant part vaccine strategy it.  dramatic, better breathe air anywhere, might contaminated. Yo fair Az far worst vaccine Cruise ships gros ways one. Well seen work several countries New Zealand. Variants threat vaccines. vaccine industry cannot keep repeated global demand since vaccines need tweaked every new immunity-evading variant.

Prof. Devi Sridhar pointed several times zero covid approach standard. Here's one latest tweets:

""Reflecting colleague China told last March U.K. early &amp; hard lockdown, case finding &amp; managed isolation, &amp; border measures, could COVID June &amp; back normal domestic life. Said much interview back then."" say normal voices starting win out. enjoy much months ago keep seeing logic applied it’s presupposing overwhelming majority people already antibodies aren’t who’ve first vaccinated. Hope you’re right though understand saying. point we've lot claims areas like Italy, Spain, even southern California high levels antibodies close herd immunity worst past us. claims proven incorrect again, areas many cases second waves bad worst first. next nothing prices cause I'm finding them. embarrassing states using event bright manage signups.

Then state ordered event bright wish got signupgenius Yeah randomly report cases mass test shits giggles. 7m would lucky. three weeks ago, said might deliver 3m 4m end month.

**But Tuesday news conference, Dr. Slaoui said instead 12 million doses envisioned contract end February, company likely “single-digit” millions. also said company “trying make number get close double-digit number possible, larger number March much larger number April.” Another person familiar company’s progress said poised deliver perhaps three million four million doses vaccine end next month.**

People completely misreading press accounts. Uhhh right now. I'm speculating: Covid19 appears circulating around world back 2019. made turn rabid? definitely are. one, example. SARS would lot worse contagious COVID-19.

If bird flu ever learns jump human-to-human we’re basically fucked. mortality rate around 70%. want go one vacinnatted? said, looked discounts personally think great, mean, usually take years decades project like this. make sense wait teachers fully vaccinated? Biontech Moderna balls push mRNA vaccines face global pandemic traditional vaccine. 

Turns out, right.  Concerts must come back. now, when? sound like biggest loser town guess calling someone delusional, classist ignorant count insult? smoking? even responding initial post, decided respond mine insults projection.

You attributing lot views express posts. say, ""kids suck deal it"". affecting kids bubble, middle unprecedented pandemic. assume care issues affecting students, far may behind get back person. also projecting right wing fear mongering increased crime low income kids. 

I speaking general terms grades, knowledge coming elementary school POV. definitely difference feasibility person teaching elementary grades, would argue indeed resume grades. However, talking resuming learning person all, commenting distance learning getting blanketed bad, bad everyone. realize zoom experience middle high schoolers bad worse experiencing lack synchronous learning...and yet dismiss POV know like you. Give break, could say knowing deal with.

It sounds like deeper issues way handled, frankly, control mine. Venting good well, realize personal examples that, personal examples. experiencing universal, better experiences worse. also seems like serious risks COVID, disheartening itself. Low income families hit harder everyone else virus fronts, especially infection death rates. think important kids come families intact person school. lawmaker, would shoveling money vaccine producing companies right now.

Everyone knew mutations concern vaccines going less effective mutations. UK didn’t options massive amount infections fact didn’t order enough vaccines turned effective option start vaccinating hope best surprise surprise Oxford/AZ vaccine close useless SA strain, spreading everywhere, probably also much less effective people 60. get don’t really option whats wrong admitting UK fucked up? EU certainly Netherlands also whenever someone says something effectiveness Oxford/AZ vaccine goal post shifted excuses made. explain dramatic difference Bay Area Southern California counties? different set guidelines Northern vs Southern CA?

No ya dingus, different set BEHAVIORS NorCal v SoCal. Massive cultural differences average science educational attainment WAY WAY different. major industry SoCal entertainment, NorCal (or people-dense part NorCal anyway) tech. 
A significant % NorCal much better looking exponential growth graph abstract saying ""oh fuck"" SoCal. People everywhere fucking up, NorCal higher proportion people listen science experts. 

Also population density LA SJ comparable all. live Bay Area, really tall apartment towers way SoCal does. 

Your logic pretty trash right beginning i'm going bother rest. pointing different outcomes within state easily explained demographic behavioral differences irrelevant thus inform us Gov. Newsom's performance - looking behavior, things says does, performance STATE actions (not individual behaviors like trying here) counts. Nice try tho. exactly airlines tell put mask helping others. effective United States vaccinate citizens first help countries. new variants country well.

Do data backing mean really. poor countries cannot manage roads, public services, tax collection, going effectively vaccinate entire population?

This ""shithole countries"" tier read it. argument stupid ignores fact even United States share vaccines 3rd world countries, countries would difficult time distributing it, especially consider infrastructure requirements two popular vaccines. First-world countries hard enough time is.

Damn, kind international organizations could assist worldwide vaccine distribution... Given coronaviruses usually result long term effects significant portion people, burden proof person making claim one does.

It's also worth noting people mention ""long COVID"", they're really alluding idea somehow unique COVID.

So really, would like see two things:

- Actual prevalence long term effects COVID
- comparison common virus

I seen studies (I think surveys), problem include things like ""fatigue"" ""anxiety"", subjective hard actually measure.

Now, see something like ""50% people recovered COVID lung scarring 6 months testing negative, confirmed via MRI (or whatever)"", would really significant. Yeah, I'm optimistic quickly return normalcy. get 2 million shots day, maybe normalcy around August? Novavax J&amp;J around 60% effective preventing moderate illness point getting inferior vaccine better alternatives available.

and problem. Seemingly, January May June, much choice. get get.

So options either pick let wait May-August ""options"" available.

I know it'll 2 3 months...but man, getting option get partially good vaccine 2 3 months advance enticing...especially since really know exact time ""excellent"" vaccines available. Vaccinating key people likely catch transmit significant effect seems. Political headline. smart enough know better? Politics, science. day 21 received third positive test result. However I've running fever two weeks zero symptoms lingering cough (which occurring less frequently).

I'm confused I'm still contagious I'm free resume normal activities returning work grocery store. heard anyone else stay home 3+ weeks without active symptoms, positive test result confusing me.

Any insight appreciated. sad pathetic year people still arguing masks. smell joy again?! People seem experiencing confirmation bias... vaccines distributed, assume that's cause drop cases.

I hope including ""people."" funny read part: ""Iran’s regime executed 4,000-6,000 gays lesbians since 1979 Islamic revolution.""  king peanut turd means nothing still turd. Bay Area thousands deaths, done well.  Well, nursing home residents tend live closed quarters outbreaks extremely high attack rates There’s transmission element believe. get symptoms you’re actively transmitting. definitely plan wearing masks permanently, least cold flu season, autoimmune disorder even flu shot, sometimes still get get every cold going around ever. infrastructure bolt every American shut prevent spreading. considered constitutional? would feed population? would states organize accomplish goal? would enforced, especially considering geographically diverse America relative China, population much heavily concentrated cities east coast?  dumb compare America, values privacy freedom, China, surveillance authoritarian state. Uh, yes? personally getting vaccine free pass return normal. need wait larger share population gets vaccine vaccinated people still spread virus. obviously 100% vaccination, sure hell needs moment. IIRC we're maybe 10% vaccinated. general problem California run.

Where live California? Never seen someone content state run. Large ports always cities......I agree get rid bunker fuel. reason won’t isn’t cruise ships guarantee much. Vaccinations driving drop cases yet. enough people vaccinated.

Remindme! Three weeks think root problem (as far know) can't really distinguish someone who's asymptomatic versus *pre*symptomatic fact. Actually, no.

We run large scale trials yearly flu vaccines individual strains 

Moderna Pfizer know kind immune response vaccines provided wild type already conducted large scale safety efficacy trials. lab results similar already have, immune response overwhelming found variants, don’t need bother even “small” trial. would cost time money

You’re right can’t directly compare results. that’s matters. I’ve involved designing number clinical trials. back unless something changed, already large body data go testing similarly large scale isn’t required Thanks right - staying home, outside necessary activities, best way avoid COVID.

If looked graph new cases last year compared surges cases calendar events, they'd find almost peaks due people getting together something, almost drops cases back side peaks.

We're peak generated 2020 holiday season.  Vaccinations start effect, math, people... we've vaccinated 40 million people. percentage already COVID known it, we'll ignore that.  40 million 328 million 12%, contributing reduction cases, that's enough drive it...new cases driven gatherings people.

If another event lots people want gather together share air, we'll another surge.  

That's virus strains change.  infectious strain becomes dominant, we'll get sharper peaks surges, overall infected surges.

Worse, new strain makes existing hygiene practices ineffective, we'll spread until/unless update those.

Yes, there's hope we're going see downward slide infection summer, simple ""now vaccine, virus go away soon"". got went work without complaining fighting cancer. easy thing anyone do, definitely something recognize for. nursing home 14 people living it?  O.m.g guys soooooo proud ourselves. love people argue masks nothing factor there.

Masks work people supposed do. Here, people aren’t wearing correctly gathering parties people’s houses aren’t social distancing.

You can’t say masks don’t work people aren’t actually using correctly. That’s like saying dishwasher doesn’t wash dishes didn’t hit start button. mean I’m sociologist anything, I’m pretty sure protests you’re referring weren’t related “cabin fever”. Sad see Americans become fanatical almost religious reverence towards masks.

How seriously believe masks way avoid getting infected? Cleveland shoreline already limits access. There’s one road parking area another area industrial port area nearby. bad MN Chi suboptimal compared mall college campus location. doesn’t expand capacity meaningful way.

Man I’m really sorry kids go long. teenage years already fly fast own, takes away valuable time you’ll never get back become adult. “hoarding” vaccines mean getting vaccines citizens?

Almost exclusively, yes. pandemic international requires international approach. think ""fair"", what's effective targeting virus. original strain Kent varient. simply responding claim AZ vaccine ""always going useless"". Assuming US, real answer. wasn’t anywhere close packed. 22k people 65k stadium. 22k, NFL paid 7500 vaccinated health care workers attend. And, it’s outdoor stadium, dome. Somehow aged 75+ nursing homes wasn’t equation?

Some CDC recommendations based “equity,” ie causes least amount death. models showed vaccinating elderly first caused least amount death, though somewhat close. 

And many states vaccinating workers CDC 1b group.

But think anybody bitching 65-74 group getting vaccinated little there. Still lot. Lots reasons people die.  Nice bait. Bye Hey, that's really interesting. learning much society science awful thing. Yes implication comments articles written need continue lockdowns restrictions even vaccinations due virus variants Jerusalem Post article Iran. No, wave isn’t small spike. things you’re calling “smaller wave” weren’t waves all.

There’s thing national wave viruses don’t care national borders. They’re concentrated locations/populations, countries. “hoarding” vaccines mean getting vaccines citizens?

It’s hard “hoard” less need. Ha! literally came comment talking friend day people washing hands public restrooms pre-pandemic. grew germaphobe mom one things I've always noticed. husband's estimation probably 25% men wash hands. Women certainly perfect either gross ways, one times hear go ""ah, well certainly explains current situation."" Mandate likely last get less less enforced local situation improve, become like traffic speed limits - people go over. Nah, even getting vaccine, gonna go back normal like whole time. seeing lot people, many events weddings one gotten anything. one know ever gotten this! Americans long time said lose weight too... can't compare efficacy trial lab test. 


There's reason approve vaccines based whether pass lab tests. test humans actual thing trying protect from. 


Pfizer Moderna run small scale efficacy trials SA back assertion works them. Otherwise evidence much weaker. Particularly efficacy data yet mRNA vaccines type variant. 


lab test =/= efficacy data. isn’t rain dance, works places everyone participates. people locked states travel states restrictions (Florida) take virus back them. say wasn’t foreseeable conclusion people inherently selfish, theory could worked honest, watching super bowl last night, seeing number super bowl parties (on social media neighborhood) I’m real skeptical long lasts. People seem false belief “oh there’s vaccine! people already getting it! I’ll probably get summer everything’s back normal!”

It’s not. We’re way yes, we’re yet. 'rule' home visits. best guidance, depends individual's risk tolerance. Sorry brought before, I've observed reasoning people fine easing restrictions ranged ""cases/hospitalizations going down, vaccinations going up, we're seeing light end start easing up"" (optimistic) ""no one following restrictions rules lockdown anyway, whatever"" (pessimistic)

WOW way pick choose quotes. **NOT** article continued social distancing masking. **The actual point argue long term continued funding COVID related public health initiatives.** 

Here whole article:  


The start mass rollout coronavirus vaccines promised clear path health economic crisis gripped world past 12 months. emergence mutated strains, particularly South African variant concerns effectiveness Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine it, shifted debate straight path might be. question quickly go back normality kind normality be. ever-changing threat virus presents means aspects pandemic life may medium even long term. remaining hopes speedy eradication Covid-19 look fanciful.  

It sobering message. Millions people, including UK Europe, still living extensive restrictions stop spread virus. economic societal damage, form closed shops restaurants and, many countries, schools, painfully evident. reminder fight Covid-19 one-off battle definitive end point. Policymakers well public need realistic achievable long run. world learnt live flu, kills 500,000 people worldwide average year. much way, NHS UK said plans mass campaign booster jabs akin annual flu jabs help stay ahead Covid-19 keeps mutating.  

The prospect living coronavirus form raises important considerations public health policy. important taken green light lockdown sceptics. time give social distancing measures let virus take course. overriding aim must remain cut transmission rates. lower rates, lower probability virus mutating. also imperative public confidence vaccination programmes undermined. Vaccine hesitancy among adults remains issue everywhere. UK, AstraZeneca vaccine mainstay government’s vaccination rollout, experts Monday stressed still likely offer significant protection serious illness South African variant. 

The arrival dangerous mutations strengthens case greater global co-operation. widespread infections allowed remain globally, greater chance mutations appear, ultimately reducing efficacy vaccines. co-ordinated programme, involving intensive genomic surveillance, needed keep track virus new mutations — worldwide national regional levels, clamp local infections soon occur. 

Just important development new antiviral drugs work Sars-Cov-2. pharmaceutical industry governments have, rightly, thrown resources developing vaccines neglect therapeutic avenue. spread HIV controlled use antiviral drugs. addition, governments target research development efforts help produce vaccines adapted prevent infection new variants. Genetic jabs using new mRNA technology particularly useful here. 

 None cheap. amount money required trivial compared human cost failing invest. Vaccines, drugs surveillance offer path back something like life like pandemic, smooth speedy voyage. Man Iranian, would enough brains give damn. Heck, would even sex Trump would mean family would get vaccine. straight male. different people different priorities based experiences lives people around them. who'da thunk it. I'm really anxious new normality could look like, first vaccination campaigns over. I'm hopeful despite mutations, vaccines almost completely prevent severe disease. I'm wondering maybe aim reducing hospitalization/deaths strategy instead virus elimination strategy.

Like, way understand it, vaccines bring us closer normality. wonder much closer? 

Like, imagine large gatherings without social distancing come back soon, dating example? (the two people vaccinated). expect entirely stop dating entire decade? bars movie theaters, going disappear completely? 

Anyone idea next years could look like article telling truth? expect life improve compared now, expect exact thing? over. made vague claims, little ground mysterious anonymous witnesses nitpicking, including suspicions one prestigious publications academia implying involved cover up, target Russia, would labelled anti vax wacko spot. 

Europe better stop flogging dead horse find way vaccinate people. We, citizens continent sick smoke mirrors. hard think restrictions far information future. state's health department info people past 1c priority even date them. 1b opened today.

Are going open everyone once? age? Sign list? Free all? 

It's hard think get anything summer current rate. possible still relies states get sort order going. understand disappointed, numbers especially low Sunday. feeling pick tomorrow. know that, heck... go dig adjusted actuarial tables figure life expectancies get back us, adjust grief/outrage/head-shaking accordingly.

(If everyone life significant health issues died COVID-19, would hell tragedy. would one big-ass massacre. *Most* 60+ year olds know significant health issues. People significant health issues routinely manage live decades.) would lead sharp overnight decline, steady decline. I'm afraid ingesting much copium. says makes sense ""better"" vaccines prioritized groups severe disease outcomes. 

Yes totally agree. fact think people get Astrazeneca Vaccine instead Pfizer Moderna. 

 
BUT

 
If wanna use full potential Az Vaccine reducing severity symptoms give people Aged 50-69 years old. 

 
I'm Italy (so sorry bad english) deaths people aged 50-69yo represent 10% total deaths, pretty substantial.  
I think people could benefit vaccine Italy Spain, decided opposite. lie handsome smart am, would also make lie shit pants? think binary switch most. transition. Get months good, ditch mask. confirm story. received vaccine 7:30 Tuesday evening. 5 minutes later, blowing two guys bathroom. works really fast. Moderna BioNTech data publically disclosed. advisory committee meetings external experts reviewed data discussed FDA met decide. meeting external experts broadcast publically internet see. Yeah, I'm trying say things getting better.

Just think ""crossing 1000 deaths,"" I'm thinking 7 day rolling average hit July November. like single day spike level.

Same way single day dip really put us way back level. still several weeks right stuff get 7 day rolling average 1000 deaths stay way. [Website program that, say ""working global equitable access COVID-19 vaccines"". reason behind this, beyond fact civilized human beings, is, also say, ""With fast-moving pandemic, one safe, unless everyone safe."", and, also say, ""Developing vaccine COVID-19 pressing challenge time - nobody wins race everyone wins."". Take two sentences repeat 100 times each. 

The, hopefully, maybe, possibly skeptical reader might open enough read [COVAX look reasons behind effort. COVAX Explained written early last year, people knowledgeable infectious diseases see (and see) something important public health situations, emphasize become important point. 

Any almost infectious diseases mutate become resistant first attempt control whether attempt antibiotics, antivirals vaccinations. long unpleasant history antibiotic resistance part microorganisms played scenario hundreds times. nation acts like greedy little piggy pats back ""taking care own"" microbe virus goes daily business, result busywork variants go right past vaccine, variants bounce back greedy piggy 'thought' protected. 

Vaccine hoarding exactly like pissing strong wind. goal simply empty bladder that's one thing. like permanently exile urine body clothes strong wind blows back you, efforts fail. Vaccine hoarding results temporary 'feeling' safety cost wasting huge piles money time spinning wheels good effect. guy posts long-haul covid never answers direct question it. He's like restaurant manager Curb Enthusiasm-- ""a disturbance kitchen"" No, wrong, typical Reddit hysteria/virtue signaling.

There's lot space spectrum ""don't give shit"" ""don't leave house unless necessary survival limit interaction humans"".

The number people far ends spectrum small. people care attempting limit actions could lead spreading, view virus potential transmission enough threat stop things like going gyms eating restaurants. ""lock home"" crowd views caring all.  Ditto. California closed anymore requires global standard UK standard. Printing UK vaccination history easy standardised UK, see additional benefit unless global standard developed. Where’s half-lie? Guy brittle bones gets run car—still died car accident. article unfortunately mixes lot things fits certain political agenda. example, men weight therefore respond better opioid pain killers. problem medical psychological condition exclusive women, men suffer too: man pushes policies actively kill endanger innocent people, dies thing policies allow spread unchecked?

Hope enjoys medicine. need dose. Whats wrong things fun? state (RI) doesn’t report weekend data Monday, may part numbers lower depending you’re looking data. course, we’re smallest state, numbers aren’t high, states boat may similar issues. Sinopharm Cansino pretty good efficacy rates. none submitted request EU. Seems like large numbers doses used domestically shipped Asian/South American countries trails conducted. thing wearing mask hardly 'tresspass' rights freedoms.. much negative effects life, some, minor. think want, studies say effective.

Whereas lockdowns huge 'tresspass' rights freedoms, negative effects life, mixed data effective are, likely somewhat effective, much need be.

So never understood masks, least somewhat effective major tresspass. I'm seeing xenophobia here, reasonable skepticism regime craves international prestige (especially one-ups West) long history lying. Nobody saying Russians inherently dishonest. That’s awfully big assumption. Many people still work. many live multi generational households. reality much would like isolate themselves, many won’t whatever reason. morally judge so, try prevent dying. Group C here. Every single person know group people group B gotten COVID. Definitely impact transmission area. Also people like moving slowly group C group B due pandemic fatigue probably keeping transmission going. People travel Thanksgiving day of, many people travel different days, gatherings different days, (*Žižek sniff*). certain point, hard tell Thanksgiving spike ends Christmas spike begins. called holiday *season* reason. 

That said, sure, factors, people traveling holidays (semi-)large gatherings virus spread. Done! said wrong also right. can't argue something identified 100% confirmed saying know much plays evidence multiple locations definitely shows play role. What's point perfect information late use perfect information, know? 

 cares effective shown effect original point was. arguing anything anyone disagreeing all. still need precautions widespread vaccinations regardless. Cases lowest 7 day average since November 7th. turn Peacock. 1,747 cases today Illinois! numbers dropping fast hell. Awesome stuff. Let's keep going, Chicago! little normalcy, treat Article mentions number cases found far still dominant. shows point continuing vaccinations key prevent mutations popping up. Think quite clear point we'll need annual booster shots deal new mutations. we'll definitely need booster shots winter South African variant. best years life

And years would be? I've least couple decades good years. Give two weeks, we'll get numbers back up! Lots people cancer patients... Unfortunately Iran they’re one Thing is, regions USA, like Navajo Nation, lost 1 200 residents COVID19, 0.5% population. Even NYC 0.33% 


Right USA 0.15%. There's still lot people nationally get sick die COVID. 


Regionally Herd immunity thing, nationally going come way vaccine. I'll chastise selfish fool want, thanks. power restrict actions, call selfishness self-entitlement see it. Y'all willfully ignorant, pretty pathetic. Yeah, get lockdowns. Trust me, understand. REALLY struggling, got rehab IV meth heroin addiction December 2019. plans got fucked covid hit... dragged on. careful, always wearing masks, mostly home whole time, fine. starting really negatively affect now. Like... NEED see people... NEED go concert, go somewhere public.. favourite thing used walking around different cities, talking people going random stores.

But masks? Fuck, masks EASIEST thing me. one hand, hardly 'tresspass' rights freedoms ALL.. much negative effects personal life wearing mask, yet effective preventing spread.

Whereas lockdowns, quite large 'tresspass' rights freedoms, yet mixed information effective is, likely effective, effective.

So lockdowns.. get it. masks? Fuck shit, wear damn mask. Ok captain obvious. Semi-open.

You want fully open numbers low, lower. Okaaaayyyy see particular conversation going nowhere. lovely day! 🙂 would say it’s overly cautious neighborhood I’m in, you’d see mean. wear mask public walking around people. Aren’t men far likely die? Seems either die long haul seems like easy common sense answer. much local news see concerning seasonal flu year? can't recall story it. 


I'll using mask next flu season pandemic not. “Ideally I'd like see average number new cases 20,000 March.”

What joke. started year ago wtf lol Remember new strains fun, go back time? Well talking Florida... good luck. Stay safe. lie human rights, genocide, tightly control media. wouldn’t lie too? ""semblance normalcy"" expression makes go insane mRNA going future way majority go expect. thing 12 months ago new untried. method used Oxford/AZ known work much safer way go time sure could get something working. sure mRNA time glad tried lots things. 

Thankfully mRNA vaccines worked easily go variants appear.

The Oxford/AZ good bet time still is. going main vaccine rolled round world first vaccination wave expect second generation vaccines mostly mRNA. need throw everything virus moment. Nice! I'm gonna get it! Thank you! Exactly. get, many articles stressing importance vaccinated old people continuing take types precautions? hell going lately? thought too. Err, entire thesis depends debunked conspiracy theory false positives picking fake infections thus causing casedemic wont result increased death, maybe revisit 3 rounds wrong every time? full blown conspiracy theorizing way beyond annoyance restrictions. Great Sunday, plus another snow storm NE superbowl Sunday particular. mask mandate? know blame. strong magic used. 5 times many COVID cases reported cases

There aren't. Simple that. study refer says 4.2 times. However, nobody seems read study shows there's decline time. model CDC used based influenza spread, much wider spread SARS-CoV-2 revised twice now. modeling. serologically derived multiplier JAMA Infectious Disease study shows realistic multiplier 1.9 symptomatic 3.2 infections around 27% population infected. 

Nowhere near herd immunity levels. People predicted would surging right back restrictions place. People seem use confirmation bias thing. Ahhh, it’s demeaning little threatening term.

Nice!
Especially combined demand less political scientific discourse!

Thank you!  Damn that’s stupid. I’m glad stopped PT safe. Frankly one healthcare even restaurant refuse vaccine. exactly mask wearing affect you? raw data, way. cannot meaningful review outside experts without it. Yeah. Building enclosure kind defeats purpose outdoor dining idea maximum ventilation reduces transmission substantially. Nice see steady progress. 1.4 million average. weekdays going exceed I'm certain 90%.
I clue many people born 6 fingers per hand, someone said 90% I'd challenge number.
Newbuilds tank sector country around 50%, depending count, that's I'm sceptical overall 90%.
I'm saying I'm certain, I'd like see sources. segment big segment? would consider part segment also honest admit I'm pretty small minority. went local diner carryout last weekend around lunch time.

People lost sight lockdown/restrictions even for. Listen scientists speaks matter, zero covid fantasy peddled people clue even lockdown. Fauci says otherwise.   It’s still marginally different. cannot point either say “these dudes 100x better restrictions” can’t even say “10x” better. restrictions anything, shapes graphs region would mirror almost identically. know question bit vague open interpretation, I'll go anyway.

I think one problem view overestimates unusual covid scope human history. haven’t pandemic lifetimes, we’ve many throughout human history, outcome tends similar - big, highly fatal spikes subside, often disease becomes endemic less dangerous, yes - society goes back less normal. new strains everywhere, when. fear-mongering point.

There's decent evidence lot antivirals actually good effect given right infection. usually even know infected point, much less whether one people needs one limited doses available. problem poor people shouldn’t buy masks feel shamed can’t. 

i agree sentiment love attitude, fix one aspect mean think could watch advisory committee write paper raise objections someone wanted it.

I think I've heard something like least 70 80% population vaccinated risk small enough away pretty much public health measures, although I'm going memory may want look want know exact figures. risk never zero, everything life, measures never preventing *all* deaths, preventing massive collapse healthcare systems nationwide even global scale. measure used risk assessment, much anyone die.

Twitter terminate account illegal access then? like said that’s true people it’s oversimplification people disability. makes lot harder maintain healthy weight.


 I’m trying exaggerate claims I’m saying small group people overweight harder time helping others. cannot even help middle high school problem lol, kids want stay home anyway. (ex. high school full time one other, since August, we're around 40% capacity) Yeah something isn’t adding up. I’m expert obviously seems like initial reports variants 30+% contagious least exaggerated. think surges cases countries probably lot human behaviors contagiousness variant itself. Prob both, tbf. recommending everyone tape mask computer / tablet / cell phone speakers.  Okay sounds like problem is, one outreach elderly population, eligibility opened up. 

It sucks outreach done, can't hold line fix that. unimportant groups next line receive vaccine after. Many groups desperately need vaccinated work people public health. I’m still mad one. True, also account people already infected received vaccine. like 27 million confirmed cases, likely infected asymptomatically never bothered get tested.

So, even 100% intersection two populations, that's still 10% population. work couple folks who’ve expressed kind sentiment. think posted back stressed hearing someone say expected stay-at-home orders every winter, lol. 

If really want see that, find Reddit, too. Look around pessimistic articles get posted scroll bit. asking people wear masks myopic? much going always, people living brink, that's problem governance, people trying protect love. Ok, fine - promise 3 7 days week put effort wardrobe. Well, yes, that's something moving air. CureVac supposed that. think nearly many truly anti mask / restriction people think. think ""anti mask / restrictions"", think deny masks / social distancing helps slow spread together.

From i've seen, evidence points social distancing wearing masks definitely contributing slower spread. big debate risk vs reward.

I (and many others) acknowledge masks social distancing work help slow spread, net benefit worth economic destruction mental health deterioration? go state country limited restrictions, surprised amazing ones mental health see peoples full faces, smiles, etc. Let alone able eat restaurant sit friends bar watch ball game.

The questions asking would reacting never vaccine? Would live like forever? Eventually people breaking point understand risks / effectiveness measures stop caring. make bad people. makes human correlation imply causation. example, I'm making logical example: women might prone auto immune diseases due virus besides coronavirus. quite reason enough say get auto immune diseases more. There's explanation that, plus speculation. really look data spewing non sense lol. “It’s likely better nothing big deal.” 

Little know large chunk world bugfuck stupid defiant good reason. J&amp;J 66% preventing moderate worse illness. Presumably bit worse symptoms. would agree that. People could lie would age takes equation. 

But def problem. parents example got vaccine already. home 24/7 covid positive antibodies still could get vaccine ups guy Hyperbole makes convincing argument, especially coming someone incorrectly believes COVID binary outcome.

\*just\* inducing dysphoria. WHO, along pretty much every domestic public health agency, always border closures. look pretty much every pandemic preparedness plan made COVID-19 national public health agencies it’s stated border closures pointless best, counterproductive worst.  died lung cancer, COVID. people probably ones able get second dose time vaccine thing. drop cases must result this. Better. J&amp;J 67% moderate worse cases. means can't wear mask? conversely, us grieving loss feel dependency, terror, pain. competition. we're hurting. maybe lost people, lost jobs, got sick themselves, acute understanding toll this? I'm sorry hurting, personally facing hardship erase lost lives. whole thing mess, 100%, onus placed poor leadership, us trying keep loved ones safe. 


I also appreciate condescending opening question. know hurting, forget others are, too. pain right now. asking question specific thing--masks--and turned memoir angst, different kind myopia. almost like living large areas endless amount people come walks life, creeds, nationalities makes open caring people thus liberal leaning. almost like exposure makes better person. Funny...  Yes Crowded lines spacing sound like great plan even outside.

Obviously spacing happen, trust others so? we're talking domestic normalcy, central majority us care about, summer almost guarantee. tech exists fuck corner cutting corporations definitely sink nuclear ships neglect. wan tto pick fucking radioactive mess. Exxon Valdez enough. Thank you! obvious seems...not be. :/ also say folks seem expect living lockdown wearing masks rest lives.

I've yet see someone provide single example mythological creatures. least, it’s permanent. Sure, imagine happen numbers start rising reasons vaccine? they're falling mean continue. 

That's problem... looks good now, may stay way. essential workers medical professionals got first?

Healthcare workers vaccinated Phase 1a along long term care residents. Phase 1b includes essential workers. sure hope so. Weve seen dent 7 day average made great one, despite cases dropping past month. get deaths lag average hasnt even dipped 3k yet. Im starting get annoyed much drop due cold weather people staying indoors? provide single example Fauci saying that? Seems like would easy he's said multiple times. determine home not? People say order get vaccine. Age easiest way screen people. 

Also US 5% world’s pop one first countries mostly vaccinated. new deadly strain probably going pop first. People covid cant smell. traded police state rules temporary safety.

Not price I'd willing pay, nation sovereign none buziness. Moderna Pfizer deals United States supply 400 million doses, enough fully vaccinate 200 million people, middle year, companies talks supply additional 100 million doses like right, 400 million almost enough every adult.

Still gonna months I'm laughing someone nervous situation. U.S. currently 1.71% death rate per diagnosed cases actually 3X that, death rate less 0.60%. That's consistent estimates models made. Oh agreed! 90% people know camp. folks extreme viewpoints tend vocal, online real life. folks following restrictions varying levels taking pandemic seriously, also hoping stop things time future. 

You’ve also reminded much miss getting hookah playing Cards Humanity friends. Haha “You struggle struggle get around understand”

Absolutely right. get “the bargaining phase,” resign fact people won’t ever understand you’re going outcast rest life. autoimmune disease strict, extreme restrictions make people sad around (if empathy), roll eyes (if don’t), resent you, generally enjoy whenever you’re around, ultimately phase lives.

Can't wait hear ""we're eye hurricane experiencing 9/11 every day pandemic that's spreading like wildfire shaking Earth's crust, cases hitting us like meteor strikes causing Great Flood COVID"" Dude I've followed rules pretty strictly. like them, wanted keep hospitals getting overrun.

YOU one changing deal here, said year ago hospitals clear I'm going back normal, that's governments said us.

Why accept restrictions longer terms altered? I'm talking time vulnerable vaccinated? Zero covid never goal deluded thought was, wake up, that's happening.

I'm sure like lifestyle fighting protect it, going grapple fact people don't, people forever. Time. need time. excuse trust government supply us vaccines completely safe. I've heard grandma tell us sterilized will, we've given land infertile, women go missing without much database where. phillipines massacred, given experimental birth control studied like mice. yeah, vaccine sounds nice. even year since administration excuse cautious government hands me. think track way vaccines announced. Summer 2021 always going hard line sand lots people. Massive industries going put two summers lost profits (concerts, amusement parks, tourism, etc), people going put two lost summers living.

The vaccine announcement November made line sand almost immovable. Lots people ready give stop complying decided they'd wait vaccines, lots people might gone second summer lockdowns going return normal they're vaccinated. mentioned nowhere China getting 100 mil Marbung first 100 mil doses produced Marbung delivered China. said initial doses 100 mil delivered Marbung, means mil doses 100 mil might delivered Belgium Foshun's facility China they're working too.

You talk taxpayer money. mention Fosun's contribution? They're first provided money BioNTech January, small share company too. Pfizer came along. later September German govt. funded buy Marburg facility. Fosun takes 100 mil Germany, see problem, fact collaboration vaccine came light. Here's latest case/death charts deaths trending down. 

California currently 110.50 deaths per 100k population. ranks 34th per capita US per capita average 139.2 herd immunity 75%, 70% immunity still massively decrease Rt thus case numbers.

Sounds like agree.  Right now, we're 70%, even close, impact immune new cases partial major contributor case load... I've saying along. calculation ALSO include effect spread people yourself. Im high risk -No. got moderna shot along like 98 percent coworkers. One older gentleman gastro issues otherwise fine. felt fatigued sore arm. elderly mother got last week. She's, put bluntly, extremely risk fragile. COPD, diabetic, heart issues, autoimmune disorder. name it, it. Even fatigued days. Californians usually vote around 65% democratic.

Most people know liberals upset direction CA going. echo chamber, reality.  also opens door 351 keep mutating spreads, would really, really bad. feel like safe us summer

The US done poorly pandemic many people listening feelings desires instead reality. Restrictions likely ease significantly summer, logic exact reason still restrictions today. Unless I'm mistaken Biden yet order single dose vaccine. US negotiating more, orders yet.

And yeah way symptoms classified pretty crazy. lot talk J&amp;J limiting disease moderate symptoms, symptoms still included REALLY bad outcomes. classified as, ""severe"" damn near intubated. Lol, received first batch AZ yet. Stay away conspiracy news sites. date too, even admit it. virus infection human history wiped besides two, took decades even vaccine

COVID always gonna stay forever, gonna another virus worry gonna say result sounds reasonable since would put IFR lower bounds 0.5-1.0 range... looks like reverse engineered algorithm start.

Which seems iffy cuz constant, improving treatments also correlations temporarily overwhelmed hospitals. happens every winter dry weather. got humidifier run night I’m sleeping helps lot.

ETA: haven’t covid I’m aware think lot people's behavior driven peer pressure rather actual desire stay safe protect others.

A small subset people continue isolating wearing masks, long mandatory, people's actions able affect people want live life like 2019 again. internet manufactures echo chambers. look hard enough probably find space ""everyone"" really saying whatever weird fringe shit want. get mad much want. I'm pretty sure that's twitter business model days I’m glad you’re asking them! work hospital CA patient research. get 4 stickers badge denotes flu vaccine, covid vaccine shot 1, covid vaccine shot 2, daily sticker deny feeling ill traveling outside regulated counties. people asking ""why"" new variants may cause surge despite cases going (and countries):

It's factors involved. I'll use example numbers I'm simply making illustrate this:

If, current rates infection infected person infects 0.8 people, cases go down. based transmissible virus without mitigation efforts combined effect mitigation efforts (masks, social distancing, etc). 

Then lets say new variants transmissible keep mitigation efforts same, infected person infects 1.2 people. new surge hands. 

Vaccinations help (mitigation effort), people also get lax mitigation efforts cases going (less mask use, less distancing, open businesses, etc). see lot blow back vaccines scientists eventually explain brain damage scared lungs severe symptoms. can't believe unintended consequences lying effectiveness masks March learned explain public plain English truth.

It looks like Biden ordered enough Mederna Pfizer vaccines entire adult population US delivered fall. chance getting vaccine April. Happy spend summer outdoors look forward vaccinated end summer. Pfizer vaccine. mistaken previous message pretty effective SA variant edited it. astro zenica one less effective.

Im guessing info effectiveness final take say pinch salt bought bunch vaccines contract that's quarterly, meaning get X number vaccines end March. still track delivered time, evenly distributed delays caused upgrading manufacturing output (short-term delays medium-to-long-term speed increase). People upset impression vaccines would delivered uniform weekly rate manufacturing delays, seems bizarre given scale complexity.

The federal government portion population put pressure lower-level governments increase percentage folks administer first dose without second storage. Lower-level governments gave pressure over-committed. they're pointing fingers other.

Canada's getting temporarily shafted distribution vaccines (not receiving many, agreement violated unless Pfizer catch April. Canada really much leverage pressure things agreements, bargaining weekly even monthly agreements would dramatically reduced number guaranteed vaccines quarter. Nope. pay taxes insurance plan taking full advantages services need, also mocking Zero COVID people. that's anybody left thinks. really think this'll happen, black people reason 25000 fans. 

The cutouts blocked seats make look crowded aware Covax scheme? Australia already levers place encourage vaccinations, allowing kids child care, cutting certain welfare payments. somewhat effective. feel career thing. I'm young luckily get going take serious determination. I'll eventually get back track requires BUILD whole new track. old track, easier track, burned. I'll never forgive Internet number public health officials essentially telling fuck year point life go on. Keeping restrictions till everyone vaccinated means economy left reopen.  ignore vaccination program US? sad see lie like can't handle truth. Nobody fucking planet suggesting restrictions exist they're necessary. good bit (7500/25000)

However cardboard cutouts seat occupied. makes look crowded. honestly think we'll playing catch race we're losing. time we've accounted current emerging variants places like South Africa, new variants emerged. Vaccines likely never catch up, therefore really end sight pandemic.

I hope left us. Huge crowd Super Bowl wonder much virus spread today’s event say China. level arrogance denial quite similar last American president. seem lot common. 1. Nothing linked article suggests vaccines kids nine three years away.

2. Kids getting vaccinated necessary go back normal. Kids get severe COVID MIS-C extremely rare relative amount cases.

3. Even vaccinating everyone age nine necessary return normal get vaccinated get sick, die (which vast majority) generate immune response future infections protect severe illness. People optimistic, lower numbers basically numbers finally settling processing lags holidays. We’re basically thanksgiving - 7 day average 125,000 cases day — seems confirmed daily death numbers still highest we’ve since began. 

There good reason optimistic, also reason get complacent. friend mine started dating long relationship wear mask two dates. get tested yesterday he’s coughing wheezing past three days 


The sure way prolong act like we’ve game start fourth quarter. Don’t Atlanta Falcons. Covid ain’t Matt Ryan viruses. It’s Brady viruses ain’t done yet. 

Apologies folks outside North America last detour. Yup, that's says time least 7,500 vaccinated Heath care workers. 20,000 attendance. USA symbolic return normalcy. It’s difference time people risk hospitalization death immunized. still grasped that? would weird? Solve problem, make money. That's lot things work life. Morons moron matter do. information people better. read releasing least information publicly meetings, know data summary sort. again, misleading bullshit. average age ICU patient UK moment 55~ years old. 

Older people die often. age 45-50 chances hospitalized multiplies significantly. Ok, dooming. read studies looked r/covid19, would know Pfizer, Moderna, J+J still highly effective serious illness death variants. vaccines effective they're going work fine variants. 

We may need booster fall, pretending vaccines work simply rational. know!!! turned TV cried. Disney advertising movie come THEATERS March 5th... could cry. evidence support works. China lying Oceania, start early lockdowns severe ones talk about; certainly say luck involved. Also case two weeks ago WA months none. Eradicating covid impossible. Probably animals whatever want obviously.

To add that, way requires 100% compliance.

Vaccinations stop infections drastically lower deaths (if vaccine even little bit effective) relieve ICU problems, good enough, say? 

I feel like I'm kind ignoring say know something like happen. Especially point we've already half measures long people protesting multiple countries. vaccinated healthcare workers packed tightly Super Bowl!

RIP “Distancing many many months getting vaccinated”, December 2020-February 2021. That’s officially happening.

Can’t wait go ballgame May concert July. course time turned 21, lol. need mingle 1 week day night, reach herd immunity shit ! mistake. Even shouldn’t take long, kids don’t get incredibly sick typically even teens adults getting shots, ok noticed quality journalism getting even worse recently. headlines increasingly desperate disconnect reality Almost deaths hospitalizations among elderly. Constantly opening closing things crash economy. four week lockdown Tyrol prevent several lockdowns Austria again.

It's simply cheaper economy lockdown single small place local cluster dangerous variant letting roam free hurt vaccination efforts. family sign medical opt-outs disqualify medical treatment event emergency. jealous salty. Nothing like beautiful russian spies try kill you.

On bright side least via nice glass hot tea. happened weeks mum, thinks antibiotics bit like painkiller, refuses get AZ vaccine. I've told get anyway, repeats wants Pfizer one lol. 

Anyway, say AZ vaccine's reputation pretty much shot. We're trying wish away. We're interested vaccinating away hospitalizations deaths. last week, average 1.46 million doses per day administered country (US). released soon, I've already said. issue simply whether think Professor Harnden lying results data released public anyway lol Oh please. Biontech partnered Pfizer could develop vaccine knew get tested, approved, manufactured, distributed. partnered well together world benefited. sort thing serves one. cat bag there’s getting zero Covid. may looking New Zealand that’s absolutely happening USA Europe it’s unhelpful comparison. reduce deaths without locking allowing events disagree. That's entire world does. Hospitalisations death plummets. Restrictions lifted. Normality two months. back cycle again.

How still grasped this, really basic, cycle? lot people scenes looks like lot people took masks Okay, stay inside then. Listen Science™️ election proved do. 1. Austria ordered lots Astra Zenica, efficient South African variant.

2. also easily infect people already regular covid. 

3. quickly overtakes normal variants last week Tyrol 650 cases 165 already South African variant.

Putting together means vaccination plans take much longer longer lockdowns get control still manageable. Yea NY high deaths one knew duck going on. Florida continues cover numbers think NZs worse. 15% quarter drop GDP. Follow science. remember reading something true kid trials age Yes, clearly much reliable scientific studies showing greatly reduced efficacy new strains. Yeah, really know people keep presenting Florida California sort tale two cities fable. They're perfectly fine terms deaths per million. 

The North-East states hand... Sure masks, yeah. That's least invasive. comes 1) limiting gatherings, 2) cancelling events, 3) attending events, 4) going out, staying ""6 feet apart"", etc., yeah, compliance way lower March/April '20. admission failure glossing over. Super Bowl attendees vaccinated? Vaccinate everyone prevent severe illness yes stay locked forever. also means reproduces mutates upper airway escape vaccines. know, worked guy went uni McDonald's scholarship, worked years. easy phrase. I'm old work manager 1/3 age. I'll apply MI 6 instead. Nothing like beautiful russian spies try kill you. Funny, I've seen better done. one said that. hospitalizations deaths plummet reason vaccinate everyone full reopening drop masks. Compared US UK? want agree me, want agree scientists saying sub stopped long time ago. [So weird anyone? Feels like saying quiet part loud variants business Still likely effective protecting hospitalizations deaths 

But get decision. 4 vaccines better disposal daily thread ABSOLUTELY does. overall subreddit no. here? daily discussion thread, extremely common. vaccines now. That’s best I’m afraid. modifications different variants happens use holywood movies instead science.

All need hope, facts. nothing healthcare everything companies rolling vaccines. orders place seems like theyre going filled while. China NZ recession. research. Past infection providing protection SA variant, much herd immunity. Yeah, protecting vulnerable worked well far. /S That’s discussing. discussing economic impacts shutdowns social distancing. right, pretty much expected you’re full Seems exaggeration. statement Oxford:

""the effect dosing interval efficacy pronounced, vaccine efficacy rising 54.9% interval less six weeks 82.4% spaced 12 weeks apart. ""

Three months long time 55% protection. know vaccines 95% effectiveness second dose 4 weeks. vindication? think lot ""shame you"" side less concerned paying less attention vaccines, numbers going sharply, there's light end tunnel. let bodies hit floor side still feeling restrictions desperate get back normalcy. conservatives, live false reality making sub one too. eventually life go on. plan would crash economy want say right say AZ fine. However, data SA variant statistically insufficient prove AZ prevents 100% hospitalizations SA variant, sample little young people. protection, yet statistically ""proven"". 

I trying optimist possible AZ's vaccine variants (except UK) near make confidence drop :/, know problem AZ next months maybe majority Americans agree you. Pursuing zero covid demented fantasy. Covid stay. Hopefully vaccinations get enough severe. Well Britain going holiday year then. 

*It gets vaccination passport gets hose (week Skegness poverty safari)* Aus recession vs UK US recessions?

Whats facts say? That’s true. Kid trials already way don’t require many subjects Well wheres data? Lmaoooo Ok that’s cool, maybe make easier make follow appointment then? fuck go process, based fucking luck, get second dose? isn't?

China NZ aren't.

Aus recession compared US UK? Crickets. checking, unfortunately rich countries high anti-vax numbers - even covid, reluctant vaccinate First, less corruption obfuscation. Ischgl happened caused 10k cases across Europe last year people charge barkeepers, hotel managers, mayor, governer knew covid cases, tried keep quiet kept Apres Ski parties going. 

Now thing happening again. knew South African variant, tried keep quiet tell appropriate federal authorities. Austrian newspaper Standard made public rest Austria learned it.

Secondly, going lockdown right now. That's really bad timing. right time still stop dangerous variant spreading. 

Thirdly, stopping travel. states Austria detected cases South African variant far, neither Bayern. So. What. People need feel control situation. folks hopeful optimistic. folks embrace extreme pessimism. control mechanisms really control situation happening months. Drive past club Friday Saturday night Orlando mask mandate see line around building. even mobile covid testing sites set un parking lots. 

All ""overflow"" emergency Covid tents removed parking lots summer. friends work ER beds hospitals. 

Say want Florida managing pretty okay semi-normal life. covered vulnerable population, however, hospitalizations deaths remain low.  Sounds like flawed healthcare system mean? Well college students ...and virus really low risk young healthy people. 700+ tested positive, 0 long term issues. I'm sure go work matter paid.. 

Profit motive exists. sooner people stop pretending like sooner people start acting based fantasy. wait somebody covid actually gets caught, step aside, cool forehead like wet napkin go get retested? anyone actually coming true positive? Oh fuck racist headlines. Nah, positivity rate genuinely down, too. Otherwise would high fewer tests cases.  Seems like giving people 2 doses case really make sense. I'd rather two people 85% protected one 95%. Well good luck that... first dose Moderna Pfizer give nearly 90% immunity 3 weeks. 90% insanely good vaccine. would think would important get many people first dose possible working 2nd doses. tough situation- think potential damage done kids school might start outweigh damage additional spread caused schools open. Las Vegas recently opened schools spate student suicides. Child abuse getting reported. lot kids falling really far behind, tough lower income kids catch up. 

We definitely need vaccinate teachers. need lose teachers long COVID. No, understand argument.

It's transmission. limit viral load ready body receive it.

The whole, seatbelt, airbag, crumble zones frame, brakes.

Just saying solution clearly they're saying may help. 

What's wrong saying U.K. love American hate America envy. give example country would case? I'm pretty sure situation US, least. NZ? 48 hours design, 48 months vaccinate world. Ah, sorry never saw original comment. Hopefully we'll see data coming days, doubt there'll enough data either way confirm anything hospitalisations/deaths. No, didn't. Trump one worst presidents US ever had, immensely unpopular, still barely lost. lockdown issue Biden would landslide. Mathematically, yes. Evidence suggests 30% overall lethal person wants break like that, sure. look way, though. debilitate workplace months. None sports seasons we’ve would possible without restrictions athletes 20’s 30’s. Project every grocery store country. 

The usual narrative restrictions bad business. nearly every employee every store go (most 20s 30s) hyper-vigilant customers obeying restrictions job working stayed healthy restrictions. one likes wearing mask, ones talk see wearing mask better unemployed sick getting paid. 

And imagine would without WFH. identified UK one present December. efficient spread even lockdown, almost certainly via hanging around airborne. see information relevant. already live cases person decided time reopen schools blameworthy. mean beg differ want but:

-Australia's GDP forecasted grown -3,0% 2020: pretty much identical US' -3,5%: bit better Germany's -5,0%: even *better* -2,9%: Yes correct. original guy said vaccine ""significantly protects severe cases"" explained completely unfounded claim pulled arse ""44 percent cases diagnosed Israel Thursday Friday found among citizens younger 19. 6.2 found ages 60 older.

Also, reported Israel actually paid $47 dose get lion's share vaccine.

As soon people excuse stop careful take it.

The goal one dying getting seriously ill. stretch goal ending pandemic moving COVID another endemic virus. 

The current vaccines (with possible exception AZ) good enough get r-naught less one. keep get front variants. variants popping spread uncontrolled. really easy escape mutation show (before vaccines even did, 0 selection pressure), expect escape mutations show up.

Forget idea vaccines getting us this. can't vaccinate whole population 3 times year (not mention useless EU national governments bothering order vaccines first place) vaccinate, faster mutations pop up.

This worse thought. may never go back normal. **Pfizer** vaccine. 

##'Merica! dumb dumb-dumb-dumb dumb.... think even without mask you, would 95% chance getting covid. understanding correct really remarkable. know takes 2 shots fully vaccinated amount protection even 1 shot requires MASSIVELY derail Covid. data made public yet, loose details released Ox presser.

Exciting times Moderna seems like great vaccine. Looks like vaccination effort really ramping bad start. Hopefully, get 3M vaccinations day soon. Figure I’ll probably get vaccine around May. Let’s hope return norm late Spring/Summer! maybe little lower that. I-cough-ver-cough-mectin I'm frustrated world leaders. think international travel thing right now. Yet, world wants new varient spread, eventually til vaccines work one. wrong wonder international travel thing still? Make indoors outdoors!  problem way worse US, US really bad, mostly due stupid people believe exists. agree... Yikes. There's also evidence suggest otherwise. a) testing severe cases b) actually released data yet. Already it,  really fucked comment downvoted.

If multiple scientists disagree, means ***listen them!*** work progress!

It's called *nuance*, people!! Canada? Let guess...Florida? understand argument making. Vitamin supplements discussed media lot, however solve issue virus transmission like vaccine does.

Also vitamin supplements made who? likely another company looking make big profit. Waiting hear Hamas Chief Medical Officer say. R(t) doubling time directly correlated like that. R(t) number infections average individual gives another certain point time pandemic (which vary R0 based number immune people NPIs). 

As extreme example - prior widespread treatment, HIV/AIDS R(t) still 3 doubling time measured months/years due long period time required get high enough concentration virus bodily fluids transmit virus. 

All said, concerning cases doubling every 10 days given cases falling every US state now. race vaccination (especially vulnerable) make sure cases continue decline. first grader even ""one class attend"" full locker traverses school electives, etc. Plus special program IEP one main teacher, one special teacher, speech, OT, social worker. know part typical, also unheard of.

Luckily he's excelling remote learning we're going hold tight everyone's vaccinated district pulls remote option. Hopefully first one. 6,338 deaths vs 474,890 right fatigued worked hard. Aaaand deleted account. Lol. 

Amateur troll. know sure? time I've seen government comment it, said vaccine orders [aren't tied specific manufacturing I've stepped away firehose Covid-related news past month so, though, information might date.

Obviously, thoroughly discuss low-income students falling behind affluent peers, would take pages pages, reddit, distilled discussion points counter argument distance learning bad. one claiming vaccines work. original poster saying re-open hospitalizations deaths low, regardless whether reached herd immunity. trolling point? called SA variant? Viruses mutate randomly people infected, higher chance mutations. country infected people? That's mutation likely come from. Quebecer, 60+ vaccinated pretty much Thanks, first time I’ve seen actual data. Sample size really low, it’s pretty drastic decision cease vaccination based. 42 cases (39 SA variant) New York’s governor caught concealing deaths nursing homes, cares?

It’s like put game show hosts charge giving medical vaccinations like prizes 

It’s upsetting 

I read sub daily states actually care people try help them. state makes sure rich taken care rest peasants wait less testing?

Fewer people think might Covid guess. Fair enough - expected vaccines. benefit you’re going bring already low chance asymptomatic transmission good deal lower you’re going remove almost risk significant symptoms. stuff vaccines reducing transmission don’t know MUCH yet, it’s extremely likely vaccines drastically reduce Infection chance. you’re fully vaccinated, you’re still rules location put shouldn’t afraid anything anymore. laid sunk depression ate mostly beans, rice/pasta, broccoli, mixed frozen/canned vegetables, canola oil tuna/chicken various sauces. unhealthy foods much cheaper Texas? one saying this. OP saying criteria returning normalcy hospitalizations deaths getting staying low, rather percentage vaccinated. likely hospitalizations deaths get flu-like levels prior reaching herd immunity since vaccinating people likely hospitalized die first. I’m sure mostly hopefully don’t extend again. always cancel ban things begin dramatically improve. looks better politically that. TWiV week, Daniel Griffin mentioned seeing increased efficacy 12 weeks AZ. Yeah 

A sad time Canada

And therefore world Well, need moment. Since Australia Japan great lockdowns problem waiting bit, eh? thought known thing people follow news virus. wish people knew even though may die there's still good chance long term effects. 

Imagine cocky surviving virus lifetime medical problems medical bills. Dr. Olsterholm said variant result large spike cases 7-14 weeks. Another variant maybe? long sort narrative going play out?

The narrative people enjoying themselves, living lives, redditors whine ""omg spreading virus"".

Serious question. want live fake reality fake news huh? people keep moving goalposts. vaccines effective preventing symptoms focus preventing deaths. That's great now, keep spreading eventually completely escape vaccine mass deaths return. certainly doesn’t mean anything close away social distancing, masking, etc. opposite, since herd immunity looking likely impossible AstraZeneca's showing bad enough they're going J&amp;J 

Because picking vaccine using exact epitopes exact delivery system one work makes sense...? sit home barely year wondering hell people Holocaust it. lmfao I’m astonished comments post. Especially OP

Some want accept life now? Holy smokes... 

No winter holiday gatherings ever guess. 10 person Christmas dinner limits. Sorry grandma, longer attend.
 
Children longer play friends playground meet new kids school. masked distanced interaction allowed. alternate *too dangerous ... GASP!* 

The wedding industry say goodbye. wedding receptions allowed. Right courthouse (double masks everybody. It’s ok though, you’re allowed go *one* mask actual vows... aren’t animals ...) right home. stop groceries! 

But that’s probably ok. wedding industry won’t last long anyways, young adults longer socialize meet other. online school/work actual classmate/colleague see sister. Hey - maybe porn industry predicting future too! 

Masks distancing long term. Hah. gotten utterly ridiculous. us here, risk covid stupidly low *right now* - even lower injected vaccines ... *checks notes* ... protects severe disease rate *100 per-effing-cent*. 

This sub cancer. I’ve finally hit limit. everyone else sick BS takes - take break crap. world isn’t changing good. We’re going back living soon, would guess soon get additional protection keeps us hospital - know damn well will. Variants damned. Worst case scenario - die 29 covid-23. even better reading takes another 4 years. banned forever lot people saying *it try hard enough, couldn't*... first world countries quite frankly *didn't* try hard enough. Or, know, all. feels like picking companies like Scaring people don’t ever get back normal Replace IF. apparently makes absolutely difference. 60% supposed protection, vulnerable 20% supposed fully protected, cases still going up.

Interesting, that. Almost like vaccines work variants, including undetected variants, including variants place now. Almost like ""specific communities"" sink vaccination effort every country. crackdown ""specific communities"" associated massive government overreach get vaccine everyone's ass work anyway. worth, AZ immediately tweaking vaccine cover SA variants. done quickly. comparison among antibody levels vaccines produce? I'm interested good see South Africa making efficacy-based decisions vaccine deployment plan, though. unfortunate AZ vaccine proving less useful, great many good options! It’s like enough vaccines available previous administration... I'm Chester County, newsletter said 182K people registered vaccines, last week, received 3.2K doses. used second doses.

We're gonna waiting fucking herd immunity here. state joke.  really concerning. know Brazilian variant since almost 3 weeks, still nothing strong is, specific vaccines react Dr Fauci told people take vitamin says takes it. that's take it. Cheap good immune booster winter. Cali fucking joke shut since last year Florida lower numbers 100% agree. lot better work internally defeat virus forget lockdowns (see Australia) let shit show keep included masks social measures limit transmission.

It's proven healthier are, less affect you. say vitamins going solve issue, said talk measures? 

Why reinstated mask standards still going ""face coverings""? 

How (assuming U.S.) make claims we're working?

The conversation over. People going they're going they've found answers best suits desired outcomes. know Pfizer Moderna produce antibody levels substantially higher needed neutralize even SA variant correct. cases South Africa significantly declined since peak January 19th. 0.2 2.0?  time majority people who'd traveling tourism already vaccinated, really going make much closed anyone else. surprised showing vaccination card becomes standard formality international travel, like we're still taking shoes TSA 20 years 9/11. ""More information people"" may sound like right thing do, often isn't. instance, remember big viral story months ago 6% Covid deaths actually caused Covid? based entirely misreading publicly released data CDC folks who: 1) requisite background, experience knowledge interpret CDC data correctly; b) agenda prove Covid dangerous experts claiming.

Although story immediately debunked, hard find people believe it, accepted indisputable fact. reason hurt anyone time vaccine, relatively low concentration. 
If go handling vials stuff, roll dice accidentally inject someone undiluted vial epinephrine kill them. prior administration openly lied misled states number doses would receive. don’t think hampered distribution vaccine doses, shouldn’t talk. 

Azar literally said, give doses, we’re sending stockpile second doses, said less week later, already used doses told sending out.

It completely doesn’t matter ordered doses - lets forget Trump administration turned additional doses efficacy proven - matters whether states able receive distribute them. asked initial question, clear improvement Biden Harris administration. thing. AZ, J&amp;J non-mRNA vaccines trash. Always were, always be.

Pfizer, Moderna eventually Curevac game town. measles outbreak swept across US nearly two years ago, Facebook pledged combat vaccine misinformation limiting content's reach platforms, stopped short banning completely. Scrolling further, easy find anti-vaxxer groups search results, including one titled ""Unvaccinated Thriving,"" makes widely consistently debunked claims description linking vaccines autism disorders diseases. Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, professor epidemiology medicine Columbia University's Mailman School Public Health, called vaccine misinformation social media ""very dangerous"" said could ""dire consequences."" idea outside experts involved development vaccines. looking patterns indicate lack safety data. safety net include greatest experts like Dr. Paul Offit. Dr. Offit says safe effective, is. That's he's sort asshole totally calls anything believe in. Well articles, clickbaiting demagogues claim reason ""inequity"" Tuskegee study. basically asserts--and simultaneously excuses--ridiculously stupid conspiratorial thinking part ""black brown"" people, simply idiotic conspiracy question mentions racism. 

Which idiotic and, allude to, also pretty racist theory assert. also present get sick, end really change anything. Vacation? become confused? Even still 100% effective, reduced titer reason enough start designing getting approval booster right now. want wait longer effective, start development.  assume high temperature = infection, possibly civid, right? Uh, write article. quoted source, sure hostile.  post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* people keep talking easy produce yet keep getting articles far behind production is. March baby! That, letting run course immuno compromised communities, immune system mounts weak response presents antibodies strong enough clear quickly, providing plenty opportunity mutations. dropped /s get high May simply enough people vaccinated current increasing rate continues. (This good thing) 7m (hopefully) end February. right now. moving target. Right now, fewer. cleared serious manufacturing issues. I'm inclined agree. transmission = cases = severe cases = hospitalisations, ambulances, etc = overwhelming healthcare system = collapse healthcare system = people start dying things unrelated COVID increasing rate No, different dosage strategy implemented even mRNA vaccines use locations, despite manufacturers' advice contrary. 

It may turn neutral even helpful decision long run, evidence-based decision. ""journalist""


""Maybe Racism Caused Covid-19 Crisis"" faster? J+J manufacturing issues resolved next month. We'd playing antivaxxers hands, NOTHING. I’m longhauler 11 months kind moot point. Even miraculously go vaccinated next week, like 5-6 weeks first dose, second dose 3-4 weeks later, 2 weeks vaccine kicks effective. time teachers fully vaccinated get classrooms situated properly, likely May school year almost over. done mutating / evolving VOC. Lots people sub seem care deaths Hospitalizations. Persisting damage occurring every level severity. Oh, good. I'm glad know I'm vaccinated sleep, something, opposed told autoimmune condition qualify vaccine. critical path manufacturing approval. can't ship meaningful doses J+J March. delays nothing. friend get PS5 ship across country. Received word qualified shot gonna get Feb. 3rd. PS5 kinda cool, waiting anxiously impatiently shot comparison. weird times. got back getting vaccine went fine. lot ID checking upon entry least 3 times going magnetometer. finally got went one station check ID sent another station nurses station. doses ready chit chatted nurse ten minutes military guy dropped doses. took 10 seconds inject me. nurse sent waiting area waited 15 minutes, 2 doctors area case someone passed out. 5 people waiting got one one left. went light grocery shopping Im back home. Oh appt 7pm got 6:30 promptly seen, Good luck. know SA, UK strict lockdown since Christmas. could vacation pandemic like sane person. Sure. endemic. know deal endemic illnesses. We're experts. getting hat point victory condition loss. I'm UK. accepted b117 lethal. link conjecture ""studies"" numbers low can't draw conclusion anything.

Also, findings based two papers presented Jan. 15 showed increased case fatality rate across age groups. NERVTAG summary found “realistic possibility” infection variant “is associated increased risk death compared infection non-VOC (virus concern) summary emphasized hospital case fatality rate associated variant increased, ""the absolute risk death per infection remains low.""

THAT SAID, variant likely rip countries lot unvaccinated people. I.e. USA. know asked race vaccine sign Mask fatigue? Bullshit considered normal wear masks colds. Maybe overall corona fatigue feel frustrated government go out. Maybe friend meant like lockdown fatigue arab population israel full access vaccine. 60% israeli arabs age 60 already vaccinated. got vaccine solid health insurance, good luck snowy wasteland got lucky neither deadly

.. deadly degree acquired immunity it. COVID-19 vaccines still provide **some** immunity COVID-19, giving us degree acquired immunity. 

There nothing inherent COVID-19 makes deadly coronavirus, fact new. True. However, looking progress, overall number vaccinations date vs overall required extremely useful. point, much better shape 200m vaccinated people. That's 400m vaccine doses (without J+J). We're 10% way there. things accelerating. good sign progress. Japan found same, got luck discovered source time, Amazonas variant, found Manaus. Lmao yeah peer reviewed bridge sell I'll look something specific later place. B.1.1.7 particular SA Brazil identified strains appear mutating / evolving fairly similary, in, three major variants similar mutations E484K, 501Y, etc. graph clearly shows increases consistent Presidents. speaking specifically children. CDC:
  risk complications healthy children higher flu compared COVID-19. However, infants children underlying medical conditions increased risk flu COVID-19.
   honestly, severe disease thing.

Billions people worldwide go lockdowns avoid sniffles, went lockdown save people sick dying. I'd like much vaccine effective levels, vaccine protects worst outcomes far better nothing. might racist think black brown people dumb figure sign vaccine. See fork discussion conversation data: short, higher efficacy number small sample size may representative general population study, lurking variables may play. need actual study intended gather data say sure whether extra time causes increased efficacy. trying find appointment place giving vaccine another person, asked provide race person. great hear son excelling remote learning. feasible option you, look similar options pandemic ends. many districts starting hybrid learning options students struggle within normal system pandemic, I'm sure expand over. hybrid options often tailor education experience student, provide options students meet peers person field trips, lab experiences small group instruction multiple times week. Every dose distributed ordered Trump administration. far Biden administration changed single order. That's big assumption. Testing rates vary lot different places different times. that’s it’s going take 7 years... cold life-long aftereffects. Treatments first thing rendered useless mutations. Convalescent plasma completely ineffective them.

But yes, vaccines never answer. reason successful vaccines coronaviruses before. mutate fast selection pressure vaccines make mutate even faster. hundreds cold viruses new flu variant year. Imagine thinking stop coronavirus mutating. around 90 percent 1 shot 14 days approximately! Cases faked. can't fake death. J&amp;J vaccine still reasonable effectiveness South African variant, easily manufactured distributed large amounts, there's reason approve it.

The AZ vaccine however might end getting approved US turns useless South African variant. didn’t get normal shitty cold sinus infection normally get every year.

BUT end pneumonia somehow lmao. work chest pain shortness breath sent home. got tested covid negative. got chest X-ray thinking pleurisy, forgot call two weeks finally like “did anyone ever follow you?”

I remember one night work bad seriously considered going ER work, kept thinking nah it’s pleurisy take naproxen, even though wasn’t helping.

I think MAY gotten mask. Well kind of, poor hygiene it. went back work factory weeks got it, getting oil coolant mask, breathing directly lot. maybe got vaping, fuck knows. 

I don’t like mention theory don’t want dipshit hear run around yelling KNOW SOMEONE GOT PNEUMONIA WEARING MASK.... factors play buddy dubbed “the temporary normal” start Doesn’t make sense offers good protection severe disease, hospitalisation death course whole point vaccination.... Ultimately, actions countries let COVID run infect huge numbers people stupid world scale.

The infection spreads, opportunity difficult mutations appear.

The feckless approach many countries increased odds mutations emerging play merry hell vaccines developed basis original strain, even responsible countries pay price. press release shared simply first milestone Pfizer unblinded results get preview whether things trending direction indicated begin rolling review - think early movie trailer. interim analysis used public health decisionmaking result submission approval, insufficient evidence efficacy. press release, clear optimistic based interim analysis, move forward requesting approval reach continue collect data trial continues enroll final analysis planned total 164 confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued.

Note safety data already collected Phase 2 trials. Phase 3 efficacy, although certainly want safety data, too.

_My_ initial point still stands: 83% number 12-week dosage interval overoptimistic slicing non-randomly-selected subset overall study population AZ trials, based limited non-representative sample size much smaller vaccine's efficacy numbers, therefore treated anything encouraging sign additional research needed dosage intervals. much production actually have? Seems Astrazeneca can't even meet obligations without US. source “less harmful influenza” claim? Waaayy people died COVID last year die influenza year, I’m curious would say that. CA disaster even strict measures. Where's CDC Johns Hopkins numbers now? Yes is, people don’t read nearly enough. public owed truth, hand-holding. Czechia issue several times... last time potician's 50 yo birthday party many politicians, worst part guests mafia guys judges recent court cases judges decided mafia guys innocent... Damn right.

Also, vaccinating world still somewhat self-beneficial.

If, example, 1st world countries vaccinated 3rd virus still run rampant there. Transmitting. Mutating. gives virus opportunities mutate, escape, avoid vaccine driven immunity. except bills tight end missed whole season getting covid november

and jaguars running back got covid october, hospitalized twice, missed reason season it

and broncos coordinator hospitalized missed multiple weeks target different virus proteins. Fun fact - antibody tests detect antibodies generated Pfitzer/Moderna, different antibodies naturally generated body. husband tracks temperatures job foreman. He’s sent several people home temperatures, those, half ended Covid.  don’t know yet know, that's point. Good luck anitvaxers Lol holier thou thing old last summer m8 word Moderna? denial screaming tantrum they're gonna go back normal even timing wrong, what's rude dismissive everyone else going this.  tend believe things permanent improvement trend however see bunch apparent super parties way home tonight Bad news gets clicks lmao disagree got history wrong haha. Plague Justinian happened 6th century, first recorded instance call Black Plague. First mass pandemic west think would Antonine Plague, happened Marcus Aurelius's reign Emperor- accident pandemic happened first time entire Mediterranean unified. closed controlled borders would controlled plagues back then. Article misleading 3.4m vaccinated. 
with 1.9m 3.4m received 2 shots Id like since I've self quarantined since feb 2020. guess mental fortitude you. 

Can admit want ignore reality create fantasy tomorrow also known burying head sand? saying ok killing people? that's ignoring reality get you. sister’s kid’s entire 7th grade quarantine decided 7th graders meet together could perform speeches front classmates. One kid later tested positive, whole grade quarantine now. Super. came sub today honestly feel shit. much discouraging news variants vaccine resistance Europe massive decline America currently experiencing. 

We peaks too. 

So even mean, trajectory? 

We’ve exact trajectory last months....

South Africa (the “scary” variant) also exact trajectory us....

Brazil “scary” variant trajectory stands out, but, they’re basically wave number cases deaths. seems they’re thing.... Yes no... vaccine passport thing say covid really bad thing handle ( globally). 

If country says = tourist allowed covid vaccine - absolutely so. consequences point simple.... 

1) people get angry can't get vaccine

2) people want vaccine want travel 
They fake take vaccine = options bad world/ person basically forced ( vaccine = dream vocation)

3) every country world could please restrictions - know home 

So least really part pandanemic speak restrictions every one choice.. 2 cents... Hope guys downvote hell ^^° makes teachers special compared every essential worker putting risk entire year? Yeah, know long. Better complete course. Still, end world dont Thank you! You’re second person ever notice reference - must true fan! 65.  sure came conclusion. conclusion came Ohio poor planning doesn’t seem care nurses don’t work hospitals. Inefficient foolish. hard would couple volunteers scheduling people site? People going wild summer droves. good news is, get week later, really impact anything. first jab going wear off. Still, really bad practice scheduled immediately since said ""0 long term issues"" completely wrong. 

i looked confirmed long term weeks ago article written. welcome check back next preseason see added list.

just like NCAA care 1/4 B10 football players got covid long term issues. Don’t post data online cause dumb fucks don’t know read data, read one scary looking sentence extrapolate conspiracy theory vaccine brain wash voting Democrat. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah bad took year. think? people trying bury good news? Maybe trying report reality. places really failing. Requiring second scheduling operation wasteful inefficient reduces compliance. one leave vax site without second appointment. serious virus, seems everyone going Florida. like numbers bad compared others, they're 26th deaths 29th cases. I’m pretty sure school district Bay Area stay online entire year. teachers supposed get vaccines haven’t received yet. Many teachers hate online school one considering quitting teaching online school. Life sucks especially seniors entire online school year school outside think vaccines bring severe infections deaths, able formulate plan deal long term effects chronic illness. Right now, they're busy dealing immediate interventions save lives page 1 priority. soon. Probably people gotten 2nd dose yet. I’m saying anything, read headline posted third grade math Might start? think passed point long ago. live, coming entire year without kinf schooling. Remindme! 4 weeks Vaccinate fuckin teachers. know like states Pennsylvania teachers lumped ""essential"" workers instead given priority. Teachers right frontline healthcare workers oldest risk general population. Idk man want inject ""vaccine"" prevent spread know long term effects of. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ What’s mechanism vaccine might provide minimal effectiveness new variant? B cells help clear infection still allow infections? is, vaccine likely still provide level protection severe illness provide sterilizing immunity new variant even first months? Literally opposite linked article saying. voted Biden certainly want restrictions including masking vulnerable vaccinated. fewer 1% trouble all, none life threatening. Wow, sure got me. ""vaccines reduce transmission"" line somewhat misleading. near certainty vaccinated dramatically lowers chances spreading virus others. 

The reason various authority figures saying vaccines reduce transmission virus prevent people vaccine ignoring rules claiming vaccinated. sell one color women’s coat there? saying peak day (3 weeks ago) literally every case UK variant today can't find many them? week 100k cases per day actually half million (all UK variant)?

your math needs serious work agree talking collective responsibility like speaking brick wall sometimes. new plant used France April another one France Q2?  Also German one starting soon make 750M doses 2021.  realize ""people"" seats cardboard cutouts right? they've got 25K 80K stadium. rude dismissive doesn’t help situation either. needs end That’s question. say trajectory Europe regards variant that’s true fuck Remind me! 14 days That's irrelevant point making re: ridiculous term ""cultural tightness."" 

I never said democracies can't too, obviously EASIER worry pissing electorate. mean hell welding people inside houses parts China. 

(Also, NZ caught still hardly cases there, Australia took much longer get outbreaks control vs. many authoritarian countries.)

I addressing specific article's use term ""culturally tight"". read description it, *clearly* describing authoritarianism. **They even outright say less 'culturally tight' societies ""more tolerance""**. 

Good Singapore (and NZ Au) successes vs. COVID-19, 'cultural tightness' clearly euphemism fear authority, deserves called such. Don’t stop doomscrolling deaths hospitalizations key metric here. Canada still lets international flights land time dont force people 14 day quarentine. cant ""wounded"" virus lmao. Comparing flu-like symptoms losing life, limb, eyesight disingenuous. 

I can't imagine WW1 vet would say, choking mustard gas trench see little queer compare low mortality rate virus flu like symptoms. Nearly 3 million Americans die every year. Death normal life. Believe death inevitable. Wasn’t thing going happen Christmas? nothing wrong country prioritizing nations needs aren’t met, fact, that’s preferable. right, let’s countries take care everyone else citizens. Unfortunately think quite fucking delusional, even saying stop wearing masks certain month. happening everyday throughout Florida months. Relax Maybe Bloomberg counting people given first dose, opposed total doses administered? different ways count either, course. go [CDC's click ""Daily Change Reported"" see two days around 2.2M. I'm glad someone wrote article this, really give many explanations most-vaccinated country seeing less drop cases many places (including many variant-heavy places like South Africa UK).

Since seen anyone claim there's massive number vaccinated people getting sick, data Israel claims vaccines working, assume we're finding experts said along, vaccination alone can't trick (or even vaccination + lockdown, since seem like lockdown compliance great). nice Australia number factors favour used exoticise success, large part Australia's success shutting borders, requiring hotel quarantine home quarantine limiting non-essential travelling parts country. Without things can't imagine situation others. watched too! It’s great watch Also, he's board pfizer. think he's corrupt, anything rag, would said it. almost half million sarcastic. could wait dad can't tell anymore. I've living life normally since May never get mess sitting ass scolding strangers internet socializing. half million Americans died making jokes. That's easily fact checkable obviously wrong assume trolling. Ah yes explain cases going down? us first half, gonna lie making point them? so? Vaccines work vaccinations right 1.5 million day within month 45 million people 40 million millions already natural antibodies. 

No need panic. Nope. “Minimal” efficacy South African strain. I’m manufacturing expert, maybe plants designed little flexibility. Another thread asked couldn’t plants built sit next time. Pfizer Moderna use “new” technology, plant built swine flu/bird flu years ago, might able produce COVID vaccine, without lot internal rework. 

Build factories. what? runs them? Who’s vaccine use (since might data efficacy)? happens companies tell us F demand IP? everything gets tied court, didn’t really get anywhere...

To me, something akin Civilian Reserve Air Fleet needs get put place. government provides low/no interest loans help build vaccine plants, crap hits fan, plant runs what’s needed (non stop), government paying costs produce product.

Everything I’ve read gigafactories seems like fly seat pants, came manufacturing. worked cars, can’t drugs/vaccines. Established process consistency name game. US Vaccine Rollout Schedule:

* Dec - March: 220 million doses (120 Pfizer 100 Moderna - 110 million Americans
* April - May: 80M Pfizer doses 
* April - June: 100 million doses Moderna April - June: 110 million doses Novavax, goes well Feb-June: 100 million J&amp;J doses - 100 million Americans  * End March (220M doses; 110M people vaccinated) w/o J&amp;J/Novavax
  * End April (\~290M doses; \~145M people vaccinated) w/o J&amp;J/Novavax
  * End May (\~370M doses; \~185M people vaccinated) w/o J&amp;J/Novavax
  * End June (610M doses; 355M people vaccinated) J&amp;J doses w/o Novavax
  * USA 265 million Americans 16 years older 2018)
  * 10-20% may ever take (26.5-53M Americans) Nonpharmaceutical interventions - mask wearing, social distancing, increased hand washing, case HIV/AIDS, condom usage would examples. BTW, I'm defending FDA's pathetically slow pace. hurting us time. Tbf, repeating government official said ""science "". Nope, that's it. Airflow solution. Open windows (either side), one. impressive lie/truth ratio. I'm disagreeing things bad... are. We've made unholy deal largely preserve lives old vulnerable, view right one even though hard choice make. face future vaccines deliver experts tell us looking another year (or even 6 months) this, yeah... calculus changes. state among oldest nation acting like pandemic exist, actually seem high. Miami Beach every night past 5 months. Y’all reaching things worry ablut means RIP restaurants, entertainment places, movie theaters, traveling me. places since March dad let go I'm vaccinated sadly. vaccines work new strains ever able things again! 1984 wear pants store Yeah, close eyes ignore, problem surely gone. Ostriches well-known genius intelligence all... Ok. Good know red tape slowing us down. NPI mean context? Florida done better lot strict lockdown states doctor says wont able get one April earliest. meanwhile rich people already. How? Less 10% people vaccinated. doesn’t qualify “going pretty well” almost anyone. that? That’s simple. overcomplicate everything Hopelessness next Godliness. deflecting wildly might worst EC president yet. Even Juncker better point post emblematic thread every day. getting dangerously close common sense recognizing reality. far reddit. restrictions good? Yes. overreacting? Also yes.

This thread every day normal rational possible, proud guys. Sure. meantime, would rather stay America, regardless much Canada wants pay. know caused this?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Australia country wait corner countries matter get vaccinated first. Australia, like many countries, ride coat tails US UK, using intelligence production capacity bring life back normal. stabilized version 90%+ chance ""right"" solution. still based limited research examples. stabilized version - whatever reason - create neutralizing antibodies like expected unstabilized version did? AZ would look like hero others look ""foolish"" using method - looked like right decision time - based relatively limited compendium research. 

Diversity approaches - delivery target protein structure - increase probability least one vaccine working. course, timeline least, AZ picked wrong horse. would worse *everyone* picked wrong horse. love many people making silly comments travel, COVID vaccines even know yellow fever vaccinations. can't well-travelled case. Stupid article. better worse, California giving doses counties distrivute bypassing healthcare providers altogether.

For example, Kaiser HMO covers 1 5 Califirnians received doses far vaccinating patients yet, staff.  (humanity) could refused spread April last year would've gone away. Agreed thought: distribute vaccine USA like draft. know many people different groups, likely know birthdays well, know many people served. Air lottery, keep pulling dates you’ve got vaccines accounted for, announce widely allow people call make appointments. seems like better system whoever log right time day/week gets dibs everyone else eat dust... countries, people. nothing deadly, ability infect mutate far greater threat. seeing. people give covid restrictions virus spread kill subsequently mutate more. cant negotiate it. Cases still dropping precipitously though I’m saying shouldn’t restrictions. think damage already done. mandatory testing quarantine international arrivals beginning, wouldn’t situation. we’re always one step behind. logic people 30 back normal last April Immediately upon approval. couple weeks. press coverage manufacturing issues significant. Biden administration offered help today using DPA help accelerate supply chain. 

They're running little late. could happen species like pangolin none animal ACE2 proteins exhibit favorable binding potential SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein hACE2.

You well paragraph. Team Goody Two Shoes wants misery. /s _Hate_ word I'd use. like disappointed UK constantly trying one-up US stupidity, nationalism, propaganda. instead course correcting like Biden, guys doubling down. say COVID-19 worse common cold? know causes mutations show up? spread. know causes spread? Yeah... people attitude cause it. J&amp;J marginally less effective Novavax though. 57% J&amp;J symptomatic infection, 60% Novavax. think it’s definitely worth double dosing J&amp;J data No. restriction.

As stands example get hep b shot go Caribbean. goes medical records, used proof.

A passport document allows erm, ""pass"" ""ports"" (or enter airlines fly travel boat).

Put even simply. cannot board plane without passport, even bought ticket. deniers always find reason show selfish. Sad true...sports party important many...more important life family members. hand-wringing around new variants really feels like won’t allowed end even vaccines still effective widely available US... really can’t covid restrictions much longer don’t see much worthwhile future. anyone please tell something see genuinely encouraging? think need start admitting many decisions make daily basis indirectly kill people, makes sense continue basing policies logic treatments vaccines released. must US citizen. amount people died 2020 previous years lol. Well, maybe, though think places tried hard compare pre-2020 pandemic playbooks. course playbooks mostly pandemic flu strain, part problem.

I think next time virus threatens go pandemic we'll see lot places try copy Wuhan playbook hit fast hard. Whether work know, post-2020 playbook different world. article says protect people getting reinfected South African version. 
It's shitshow. Part blame politics. They've known potentially earth-shaking variant South African gov't says ""TRAVEL WANT!"" Don’t think many follow anymore restrictions year this. care pushback massively growing even areas like CA. clearly stabilized version ""right"" avenue go down, look flip side. unlikely, perhaps stabilized version issue prevented immune response neutralizing - AZ's version use stabilized spike. case, would savior promising vaccine candidates failed deliver expected efficacy. 

While obviously ""conventional"" (I say loosely - stuff still relatively new got lucky recent research applicable here) wisdom paid stabilizing spike, diversity delivery methods target proteins best terms best chance least vaccines work. achieve herd immunity vaccinations. Don’t think it’s ‘bad news’ - likely it’s people’s attitude whole situation. He/she right read multiple places ""immediately."" clarify **rocket scientists** busily voting down: ""idiotic"" conspiracy theory Tuskegee happened. did, obviously. 

The idiotic conspiracy theory CVS guy doling COVID-19 shots separate cooler marked ""colored people"" something.

Even agree absurd face, would completely impossible keep conspiracy secret. black person know takes idea seriously, dozens concerned rich white people writing major magazines sure a) smaller proportion black people electing get vaccine b) conspiratorial antivaxxer nonsense entirely excusable, racism racism racism must always trump rational thought. Ain't good question.

There lot speculation that's probably right, far know, nothing confirmed. ""In many nations""? ""Those nations""? Ladies gentlemen, real expert here. ran trial efficiency. find bizarre hell AZ Oxford didn’t bother this. every vaccine manufacturer did, them? know AZ little experience vaccines, still, it’s massive oversight that’s costing world right that's case choose option also need quarantine 14 days. I’m different industry, called “reference plant” designs.  Basically you’d build greenfield, tweak there. guess doesn’t exist vaccines?

Seems like could get permitting variance request one right now. Build military bases executive authorization fast track everything. It’s mind boggling we’re treating like wartime effort. We’re cutting checks stimulate economy TRILLIONS dollars thousands people dying everyday goes on. siting permit water discharge red tape get way that. 

Tesla building “gigafactories” less year, imagine size logistics orders magnitude bigger cars vaccines. R&amp;D departments companies seems like heroes, manufacturing teams seem like they’re falling faces right now. It’s bogus I'm adding statistic week! We're going helping injection sites (nursing students) we're getting first round vaccines begin giving others. Cool, still doesn’t mean entirely evades immune response. Sputnik likely useless Oxford/Astrazeneca. I’ll take culturally heterogeneous day Well, let's give keep international travel thing get many varients possible. Go big go home right? love stay house another year. Maybe we'll make entire 2020's one big stay home party. Well Biden honest available May sell us surplus Ok, let’s logical then. coronavirus deadly infectious disease currently exists vaccine? take totally ridiculous. Anyway, would like touch base two years, hunch right countries reopening. shout rooftops forever, cannot argue reality, people already starting totally give COVID measures. heard 2.2M yesterday end day, Biden needs make final call. brother you’re insane. stay indoors want don’t dare chastise wanting basic freedom disease 0% chance hurt Unrelated love username. I’m rewatching better call Saul right now! think previous pandemics show defeating virus never prerequisite opening schools economy.

More importantly we're seeing Israel even there's lockdown, people longer follow compliance gets lower every time tried, stay-at-home orders basically impossible enforce places. could shut economy tighter drum people would still spreading virus.

So sit around delay much hope vaccinations help save many lives possible, history shows people perfectly willing sacrifice lots lives get back normal, increase people feel personally safe. point accept level risk get life monumental decision turned be, wow. Brazil variant covid causing Brazilians get reinfected. statement false. Brazilian variant already several countries. Vaccines still prevent hospitalisations deaths different variants what's important. Even without vaccine virus would mutate people would need reinfected build immunity.

Sure, companies going make profit requires annual vaccinations, still brings us benefit, paying benefit.

Luckily government funded vaccine development well pays vaccines worry paying.

Without vaccinations, government (funded tax) would end paying more.  means lot confirmed reinfections South African variant. Bad news around. 

"" Scientists South Africa said Sunday similar problem held among people infected earlier versions coronavirus: immunity acquired naturally appear protect mild moderate cases reinfected variant, known B.1.351"" :) role fur farms play? didn’t say data. there’s also data it’s ineffective death hospitalization Thats population Canada. fuck going country?!?!? Good thing say sufficient one way another. reduce transmission all, however, huge game-changer ""sufficient"" not.  Hopium supplies running critically low. hope you’ve lost affection life 2019, it’s gonna get worse. Make sure comfortable mask. Mutations tend come immune compromised people shed virus long periods time. Pfe could cure cancer stays 30s think since first identified Wuhan, China, possible geographic name might something like “Wuhan Virus” something like that. No, data study death hospitalization. 

It showed young adults still got sick mild moderate illness. young adults get mild moderate illness without vaccine. think people's expectations set high Moderna BioNTech's stellar initial results. surprising vaccines turn ineffective Phase 3 trials, especially pandemic continues rage virus evolves.

While first-generation COVID vaccines may efficacy eroded variants (and believe continue year), see 2021 time **slow pandemic down**. long vaccines remain even partially effective, slow rate new variants showing up, buying us time give us opportunity build better vaccines outrun thing.

None guarantee. could playing cat-and-mouse quite time, updating vaccines pressuring virus evolve response on. bit luck, vaccines remain partially effective slow evolution end pandemic phase covid even without eradicating underlying virus. people attending superbowl parties people takings risks anyway. Could create small bump, sure, massive one. You’re clearly failing understand longer possible outside places. It’s 10 months past point return. that’s fine, means can’t rely strategy Ha ha go zoom class learn something, kid. Adults talking here. Disturbing. study show long lung damage persisted? Here's layman-readable article explains stabilization means. don’t understand bogus economic dooming tolerated here. No, economy won’t “collapse,” stop fear mongering. Sounds like strategy worldwide, tbh need change company's name Johnson &amp; Johnson Esther &amp; Esther. ;) country world literal vaccines? Yes many diseases. protest vulnerable. don’t need perfect , vaccines 10x better vaccines click bait title scroll look chart estimated case state. would think would 117 variant would ultimately win based transmissibility alone. really sure prevalent SA Brazilian variant currently. seem case numbers going SA. least that's positive. really stay ahead things via vaccines, we'll good shape. least Pfizer/Moderna, J&amp;J still somewhat effective SA variant.

There news stories ""you get vaccinated pharmacy"", like ""you get tested pharmacy"" stories, alongside ""new drive-through vaccination site opened [state]"" stories. Right they're using AZ/pfizer. They've got 40m pfizer order sure many they've received. They've also got orders Novavax/J&amp;J Moderna UK right now. 4,000 12,000 variants depending definition many likely came existence US, statistically speaking odds variant functional difference (i.e. transmission, resistance antibodies etc) low, get attention. US also less sequencing than, say, UK, odds new given variant isolated lower. Ya lab testing showed strong immune response, much higher needed neutralize tf survey ask lmao don’t buy one second WELL LIE - MAURY Cuomo gave hard numbers first wave, hit them, said: ""EEK LOOK FLORIDA, STAY CLOSED"" half agree you. half thinks getting people like board could turn millions others away message anti-vaxxers spreading, could save lot lives. agree. everyone vaccinated opportunity get there’s much do. risk people next nothing anyway. (Plus point refused get vaccinated pretty much deserve get.) SARS-CoV-2: ""my variant 'my variant dropping' dropping"" guess spread access far possible, since almost literally everyone wants/needs vaccine, wants/needs ASAP. Pharmacies drugstores-with-pharmacies still operating business, regular non-covid related prescriptions dropped up, picked up, discussed pharmacists. people buy random shit buy drugstores, keeping business. every member local neighborhood crowding local neighborhood pharmacy, clogging parking lot day night months end, that's harming day-to-day business, also needs patients picking diabetes supplies arthritis medication birth control. offering thin load pharmacies, providing huge empty stadiums going unused next half year new football season starts, well, makes good sense around think. think issue figuring solution refrigeration storage minor speedbump, lot people working logistical questions. Oregon well. job prove someone else's claim them. make claim, substantiate claim rightfully dismissed. Restaurants opened last week illinois. Kids still going school. still working home technology job truly vulnerable longer vulnerable need open up.

I agree 100%. It’s 3-4k deaths daily good evidence truly vulnerable still vulnerable.

But lot places legally opened business still suffering (mine included). large parts country come home work go dinner movie maybe even go drinking house party nobody stop you. 

A lot people choosing lock down. government can’t create demand people feel unsafe. Yes public health messaging could change that, thousands people stop dying. effective preventing moderate illness

We literally data good thing waited super bowl. Could imagine interrupted season people could protected deadly virus /s think don’t realize don’t live US lol. It’s like (American) saying I’ve heard NHS don’t quite understand it. That’s ignorance. tried find study mentioned closest could find articles mentioning early data UK study indicated 10 percent tested lung complications. still early pandemic ongoing, going hard data longterm effects while. Mischaracterizing either way silly. That, plus ease saying going something moment without actually it. Like everyone going start diet bright early tomorrow morning. Requirements written humans passed along humans write code. code executes requirements written humans accurate highly efficient manner. That’s it. 

Code doesn’t “decide” anything. 

People (and institutions) hide behind code don’t want held accountable.

Transparency key. Finally! wanna able go school point enjoy teenage years! 

The light end tunnel getting closer! Clueless. meaning normal/open truly bastardized.

""You get groceries, maybe buy clothes, talking about?"" Man, efficacy one shot! Wrong? No. reasonable. need worry SA variant yet. Worry comes immediate area.

Long covid still debate, I'm inclined think real.

Post vaccination spread seems less likely me. Especially line. get vaccinated get infected new variant, broadened immune response virus. Makes even less likely infected later, less likely spread, provided subsequent reinfections reduced severity first reinfections.  state-wide? months ago help friend moved Greensburo feel like all. [Soooo many Worries could variants reasonable spread disadvantages heavy immunity vaccines - ie ones distinct spikes - would notable enough variants concerns start making significant ground, response vaccines.

But suppose they're much disadvantage may bother us much anyway. Games

Great movie, become reality... Furlough then? Totally agree. think right right time, month two everyone high risk categories vaccinated seems like good time open completely. 62% initial dosage, they've since ammended think proper dosing. Honestly AZ helped public need opposite rocket emoji sub. tell people control group control group (i.e. getting treatment). tell people trial group trial group (i.e. getting ""treatment.""). give placebo, see there's difference response. Well least finally successful completions Lions stadium (Ford Field). this, quebec waiting 90 days MRNA vaccines... Canada’s roll shameful mess numbers don’t lie. think become pretty unreasonable say United States return normal- ""new normal"" masks social distancing, 2019 normal- within 2021. Personally expect happen time normal Summer, understand people hesitant expect, rather hope, happen Autumn.

I think country mentally economically survive another summer plagued restrictions. cases dropping dramatically, us approaching complete vaccinations nursing home residents majority Americans 65, going worth restrictions another Summer. can't see it. know stadiums, Indy plenty parking something like this. lot Lucas Oil almost big stadium itself. Easily thousand parking spaces seems like enough handle vaccine drive. Ya J&amp;J still tested moderate symptoms. AZ effective preventing moderate illness. J&amp;J Well right acrosd Europe South african variant dominant means right vulnerable protected dominant variants there. know UK door door testing try prevent becoming dominant introducing hotel quarantine certain countries. 

If csn hopefully prevent becoming dominant till new vaccines arrive ok otherwise vaccines arrives like J&amp;J Novavax go back vulnerable vaccines so, sister still keeps sending articles vaccine. Today ""life vaccine- relief Get Jail card"" San Diego Tribune.

You've never seen elderly person sporting event? 15% US 65+. cater every method smallest minority trying vaccinate entire country protect many random people going bother going stadium?

Tons. tens millions people want vaccine ASAP. far fastest way make done private sector utilizing system use quickly efficiently give flu shots year.

You both. flu vaccine though. pharmacies equipment store vaccines temperature required. Getting equipment thousands pharmacies much harder 30 NFL stadiums. mass vaccinate turn private sector finish make easier edge cases. feel like people claiming want doom way people love dooming covid. Creating hypothetical situation get mad at. okay travel domestically now? Based statistics appears transmission rate via airports planes relatively low. Would safe travel domestically pretty much still stay in/isolate?

I miss family really want sister visit don’t want foolish. Agreed. Paywall

On note: news companies *seriously* expect people paying news, available free almost everywhere else? First number find way headline 90%, revealed mistake small sample, 62%, stressed time two doses affects efficacy significantly, revealed recently efficacy 70% one dose. total mess. point ditch masks? metric? get feeling they'll continue mandates wayyyyy longer necessary. Teachers getting vaccines weeks now. Weak However, one limitation peer-reviewed study ""that engineered viruses include full set spike mutations found [U.K.] [South African] variants,"" researchers said.

So even actually test actual UK SA variants? ""engineered"" them? That's scary they're ""engineering"" variants lab. one going theories got us mess begin with? schools open, consider region locked down. schools 100% online many, many parts country. I'm trying post much ""worry happens, now."" threads reasonable. too! Teachers eligible vaccines since January 13 NYC. sure referring to.[NYC teacher There’s still food! It’s outdoor/takeout/food truck style. put ton spaced lounge chairs/tables outside. 
This weekend gorgeous cloudless weekend, little unsure nice things would stormy. Less fun still worth it, probably. likely 50 bare minimum. Exactly. understand gesture, space administer vaccines problem moment. new strain supposed pick steam March back started last year probably worse. UK summaries pointed towards 50% higher transmission 65% higher mortality rate new variant. Storms coming. back line IMO Moderna vaccine right there, higher first shot. agree huge public health crisis told beginning would likely infect 60-80% percent population matter what.

Somewhere messaging went flattening curve order protect hospital capacity wait vaccine need keep vaccine.

The cure can't worse disease truly vulnerable longer vulnerable *need* open up. probably don’t worry spikes point virus running people infect

Independently whether ""open up"" (is anything closed right now?), part probably right. locked now?

In North Carolina, there's 1,000 bars (private clubs) still closed down. Along various business/capacity restrictions venues closed. There's also curfew (businesses close 10pm) still place. ""Mostly Open"" bit misleading North Carolina, taking account various restrictions still place stopped avoiding touching communal areas ag work like doorknob wash hands regularly. Surface transmission super rare food transmission likely even rarer impossible. Oh look moving goalposts government.

Thanks hard work. Anxiety + Sedentary lifestyle? simple. elite get live like back normal, masses endure restrictions years end. - J&amp;J He's spread blatant misinformation vaccine (presumably he's anti-UK 90% number, example, never released. trial error. wanted trick people appear effective Pfizer AZ constantly trying create beneficial data. Younger people usually shown better efficacy. vaccine 10% efficacy younger people, probably even worse older one dose data fucking god awful though. AZ 62% efficacy. Everything else released pathetic attempts trick public.

Literally everything said simply true that's first page comments! goalposts? Whether someone believes make untrue. virus care tired it. even read article, even know ""race baiting"" means? aware, ""people care race"" monolithic entity share views, sure hell speak them. 

This article real, anecdotally numbers, problem America general healthcare system particular. can't understand that, gotta difficult pretending one ones ""cares race"". mean, maybe. say one way yet. Cruise ships dock regularly places cause huge surge demand drives local economies. address environmental effects cruise ships without outrightly shouting bans. mRNA vaccines, one dose great, know (and think?) lasts long. No.

J&amp;J look symptomatic infection. 57% effective moderate infections, 85% effective severe illness,100% death Thank response, eased worries quite bit. Seems like situation going play similarly flu, case need annual shots really hold perfect efficacy. I'm hoping get return normalcy summer. 

Have estimation booster shots available? People immediately going ""back normal"" receiving first shot put selective pressure virus adapt month-long period doses. addition, due vaccines distributed wealthy countries first, poorer countries act like pressure cookers, allowing virus mutate unheeded. woods COVID yet people subreddit seem letting pandemic fatigue cloud judgment. Damn bro. Coming fire early morning. I'd like know people took survey defined ""crowd."" lot people hear ""crowd"" think places people packed like sardines there's often energetic frenzied atmosphere. Nightclubs, concerts, sporting events, stuff like that. think avoid *those* activities, they're avoiding crowds. think stores, restaurants, informal gatherings crowds, think they're following rules.  it’s hard set exact points without arbitrary. take account everything. widespread cases, many people immunized, many people access vaccine, many deaths hosptilizarions there. trends things. literally taunted 73% efficacy shot. Saying gave 3 months immunity, never data for.

... guess know racism is.

Rabid nationalism surrounding vaccine something never thought would see. know rest world give crap vaccine developed, right? four substantially effective 

AZ outlier 

Sorry crash doom talk Hmm questionable source. wish media would honest us. keep highlighting extremely rare complications people 20s 30s. Young people vulnerable old people COVID, listening media, think otherwise. Uh yeah, OP listen Mom. could zero COVID cases everyone actually social distanced people animals virus dies human population. it’s social distancing animals avoid catching zoonotic diseases future. However humanity plagued selfishness stupidity never commit this.  New York struggled too. aren’t alone. bigger drop expecting Sunday! Let's hope trend keeps going. see GOP promoting ""soft"" Hollywood Republican trying mirror Arnold's success.

Telogen Effluvium becoming common stress covid patients people even infected 95% Americans absolutely believe they're going stick New Years Resolutions also... /s makes think aren't?  Good luck getting population large buy long people think covid testing restrictions college campuses go for? 

There much news school end covid restrictions, even we're vaccinated next year, could see still requiring social distancing covid tests quarantining people reason \~virtue signaling\~ remember crossing 1000 deaths per day major traumatic milestone virus. like ""only 1300 deaths, yay!"" 4th one favorite holidays, I'm moderately patriotic, love vibe food drinking reveling. NYC great time (without covid). Looking forward second half year ""normal"" holiday times bring.  saw comments another sub (won’t link due sitewide brigading rule/it’s worth honestly, didn’t even bother commenting myself) freaking in-person Super Bowl irresponsible. commenters pointed limited capacity outdoor event significant portion audience vaccinated, super bowl parties way likely spread virus (which personally would like add would likely take place regardless live audience not), people downvoted hell. told people couldn’t act vaccination actually reduced viral spread, would inevitable large spike infections event.

This mentality mind boggling me. Like 1/10 people US given least one dose vaccine point. that’s supposed semblance normalcy, is? seems like strawman argument insist people want complete total isolation lockdown last forever god certainly feels way. recently turned 26 made really depressed knowing last year ""early 20s"" basically wasted. date since 2019. even chance meet new people year. done anything memorable. wanna live again. Yes, hope it'll better, exactly problem that? think may headed repeat roaring 20s. months flood gates open. stability shitty online school work 80% time. Unfortunately, that's happens slow-walk rollout vaccines.

We millions doses sitting fridges acceptable.  people leaving town (technically, entering another) ruled illegally preventing people leaving apartments dozen sick city fly here.

Quarantines lockdowns enforced multiple times before. would western democracies there.

Most adopted lockdowns. What's Chinese economic statistics usually considered skewed.

Tested negative COVID via PCR swab horrible wet cough plenty fun symptoms. I'm usually risk adverse I'm spending time trying tell friends colleagues buying $3000 hepa filtered air helmets necessary.

If looking growing career opportunity, therapists hypochondria agoraphobia going much need next years. ..which means Uk variant soon dominant variant. vaccinate vulnerable, we'll focus daily deaths, cases. 100k cases per day 100 deaths, lockdowns need continue? Also need think total bodies there. might briefly peak 4M-5M per day, able stay long run arms.

Obviously there's lot variables here, we're probably looking ~450M shots needed arms Apr/May. That's 50M people J&amp;J 200M people Moderna/Pfizer. number could jump approvals children ENSEMBLE II finishes up, that's also assuming relatively high take. might looking lot hold-outs convinced Apr/May.

So 450M shots. We've already done 40M. Let's assume average 2.5M February 3.5M March. We'll need ramp hit 4M-5M number.

That gets us 195M. Okay, we'll still room burn 4M per day awhile.

But let's assume slightly slower ramp. 2.5M average Feb. 3M average March, 3.5M average April. That's 285M. We're basically one month burn 4M-5M per day. Slow ramp we'll never hit 4M arms put shots in.

Worry control people life peaceful you. rich people fly too? Wow, ignorant. feel like normalizing idea vaccines end pandemic. media wants pandemic go forever, honestly media, experts, government start saying restrictions continue vaccinations, non-compliance gonna start massive scale. keep mind surveyed 2000 people enough tell Americans really want keep this.

Now friends post stay home you’re monster shit go “small get-togethers” ie parties keep social media. It’s honestly turned friends people. they’re getting together, they’re complete hypocrites. RemindMe! eoy Oh, see. Alternatively, sit think implications virus mutating way make avoid vaccines approved - would necessarily require us go another 11-month long pseudo-shutdown? 

Just really think awhile, maybe open eyes. Vaccines susceptible poor PR. evidence problems GSKs Lyme disease vaccine bad press killed it. thiomersal, evidence harm outcry led removed precaution. would make think permanent mask mandate even table?

In honesty feels hopeless seeing many people give shit happens long comfy WFH job, media consume, food table. Meanwhile loudest voices extreme ones, state run people want masks forever, bet ass mask mandates go way longer necessary. also depends views people doing. Nope, first SA variant dominant world, second, vaccines still perform well enough may even need booster shots SA variant, however capability booster version needed, exactly would head another lockdown? Even Oxford vaccine, despite poor performance still prevents deaths caused SA variant, combined vaccines still provide enough protection SA variant take foothold cause another wave infections deaths. Newsom going gain flack matter did.

Only way keep spread incredible slow: complete lock down, 24/7 martial law, National Guard Police force preventing people leaving homes without papers.

Lacking *any* form lock would done significantly worse hospitals care. like build hospital days/weeks time, nothing built last year add capacity. Every nurse know worn thin significant extra hours.

The recall effort GOP backed initiative GOP cannot win general election -- general election since Pete Wilson 90s. Arnold's win re-election Davis recall, he's practically GOP name only. Recalls significantly lower bar pass, pushed hard. Newsom favors attending fancy dinner, mask less. Good job never goal? I’ve hearing mixed things. catch covid vaccination shots, what’s protocol? NO. life, existing. No, Publix dominates area much. are. However takes time, current vaccines really effective preventing deaths hospitalizations severe COVID matter variant causing it.

We'll boosters needed, need yet. places medical professionals equipment properly store vaccines could administer vaccines local populations. ONLY! I've seen now. think true unfortunately, problem South African variant can't hammered UK indeed still protect serious illness, I'm worried waiting either Autumn new AZ jab maybe earlier studies okay mixing doses using jabs booster doses. dont even think will. Theres hospitals, pharmacies, doc office's, walk clinics scattered throughout entire country. stadium would make efficient distribution (i.e. ship millions doses single place) thats offset fact would gather large number people single place. feelings similar mine. Even support mask mandates, phrase ""it's mask"" drives insane. able properly socialize see faces strangers close year. things start truly reopening, masks huge barrier socializing. Wearing mask seeing mask others sends lot subconscious signals brain gonna get rewired. almost definitely fucking child development.  tear stupid wall it. think it. folks vaccinated, heavily skew people may die get covid. average Redditors younger healthy. sub started get exuberant prospects older folks vaccinated faster timelines. Maybe bit excited. isn’t June yet. need hold tight two months numbers plummet, deaths plummet, largely guilt free end q2 rest year. every thread like uocovted comments like “oh awesome x banned”. Like literally see posts NZ upvotes comments say “they stay closed forever”. y’all bunch shut ins don’t explore world? actually enjoy spending vacation time exploring world mean, depends whether vaccines ready not. I've heard 7 million ready go. American European plants? AstraZeneca isn’t vaccine. vaccines still somewhat effective infection it, 100% effective preventing hospitalizations deaths, important part anyway. come sub fully understand stuff. r/covid19 much reliable level-headed Pretty safe since you’ll outside! ordered 4 million end March. nothing saying delivered uniformly. local governments gave 2nd doses without knowing would arrive silly. process make it? Like flu shot start pig liver whatever science haha probably pfizer, works. Weeks I’m spending rest life playing dodgeball COVID, neither overwhelming majority people around world. go back normal eventually Excess deaths number deaths exceeds predicted numbers based population growth factors. 200,000 deaths happened 2020 specifically due covid, happened compared 2020 without covid (so much death typical respiratory illnesses predicted for). literally almost leading cause death USA, flu/pneumonia never come close. invited go hike 2 friends. One nurse vaccinated, works restaurant/sees people regularly vaccinated. I’m planning drive separately &amp; wear mask much (it’s strenuous hike, probably whole time). safe / unsafe would rate activity? want go haven’t seen anyone literal months mental health deteriorating quickly, also don’t want stressed entire time. No, frequently use ""many hands make light work.""

The question like. doubt one person reviewing 40,000 files, I'm guessing phrase applicable. Remind me! 14 hours :O aren’t 100% effective coronavirus general - whether that’s DG14G, recent mutations original virus. Efficacy preventing mild illness seems vary variants, it’s never 100%.

Regardless, vaccines seem reliably prevent majority severe illness death - regardless strain. jabs highly modifiable address drops efficacy. That’s big deal. expect drops cases go along drops tests. Symptoms catching virus cause many people get tests. It’s 5 percent chance contracting covid. that’s assuming 100 percent chance someone actually covid. multiple odds someone covid odds contracting virus. definitely lower 5 percent depends many people you’re interacting case numbers area. I'm aware, yes. said conflict*s*, plural, *perceived* never-ending queue them. one continuous war.

I’m sorry idiot you. lol Twitter account - name Rio Slade - profile picture like billion selfies.

You're shamefully uninformed. Depends states. 95 percent chance contracting covid someone give take. Take many cases state multiply like 10 ish that’s amount people probably sick shedding virus. Divided number population state multiply number friends multiply 0.05 accounts 5 percent chance contracting covid. It’s zero it’s definitely lot lower Hate guy reason believe South Africa variant delay normality? Especially due recent AstraZeneca reinfection studies. know I’m gonna get lot downvotes want hear opinions Thats essentially happening January. EU getting arms reduced production. Eh news AZ vaccine south african variant objectively good. end world certainly counts discouraging news. They're effective UK variant. 

It's South African variant seem significantly less effective vs. Yeah. showing many fewer minorities vaccinated saying due systemic racism begging question.

Pre-vaccine studies showed hispanic black persons US far far less likely take vaccine. 

Now could argue that, knowing resistance vaccines communities, federal state governments ought proactive messaging regarding vaccines communities, that's separate discussion versus happening sure getting downvoted. lived Japan. definitely ""one week year"" thing someone suggested.

Got cold, mask goes on.

Well, facilities more. I'm bit fuzzy history, cards due stuff Covid. working it, take least months (I think time summer said, we'll see actually happens).

So mistake whatever caused us able produce locally, said, I'm clear politics there. be. prevent death hospitalizations 100%, that's matter. might still get sick, bad normal influenza infection would be. ICU pine box. bed 3-4 days See don’t know that, somebody else thin skin get reported. feel like places like Reddit used spreading positivity way possible time divisiveness god, replies. forgot annoying Twitter's general tone is. I'm saying Reddit. low bar. covid certainly capable spawning mutation. There's massive decrease daily new cases almost back pre-winter October 2020 levels. great sign. 

The effect data-based leaders charge remarkable. afford healthcare system overwhelmed surging cases ? ""generation disabled people "" extremely reaching accurate. tired 6 months post infection ""disabled "". understand issues heart problems that's far unique covid. That’s simply untrue logic buys assumes vaccines effect themselves. Natural immunity important. 10 percentage point difference big improvement. it’s, example, 60% instead 50%, that’s big difference. Uhm akshully go try schedule vaccine appointment right next available one August. really many us good. People stay disciplined vaccine rollout finished. infections are, higher probability mutation defeats one vaccines. stay semi lockdown mode another 9 months whatever.

We absolutely continue measures least close herd immunity. takes getting understand  ever wondered greatest human right abuser currently ,China torched economy stop pandemic... side effects hitting young working class costly. sure America handle generation disabled people, it’ll fine.  shameful grandma killers lot Vaccines really reached level would impact numbers except maybe Israel, Bahrain UAE. pandemic ever lasted decade let alone 100 years don’t give nonsense 

Adapting enough innovate overcome. FYI Hundred Years’ War misnomer 1) wasn’t fought continuously money Black Death. two sides frequently made truces result 2) war officially lasted 116 years Yeah that's big thing opinion, positivity rate dropping rapidly. # tests dropping means can't look # cases directly get good feel what's going on. Even 100 deaths day shouldn’t normalized, means. would still number people died 9/11, every single month. god happened Dan Rather Biden President United States. bosses American people want vaccinated. 

Usually token box two sent ally photo op, would ludicrous U.S. deal amount problems home, pay much vaccine supply chain globally, send vaccine elsewhere. 

If tables turned, Trudeau would probably express regret thing. know rest world would berate US unprepared. Yet Australia getting Astra vaccine :-( hope re-open borders too, we'll ones screwed long term. suggestions could instead? Sadly, evidence able ease restrictions even people vaccinated. Good pay taxes funded development. one small minority wants that. rational sane politician either can’t improve tests much.  swab picks certain number cells.  it’s early days virus hasn’t time multiply much, odds specific cells aren’t infected yet there’s literally nothing find.

Are happy waiting 14 days? coronavirus November. mild case, weeks afterward, felt like breathing different. get deep enough breath. is, February, chest still hurts exert myself. certainly want get experience damage. thousands people attend superbowl today. I’m sorry 😞 missing here? We’re pass 2 trillion dollar covid bill. take billion bring new facilities online? could assemble quality manufacturing engineers, commercial construction, instrument vendors, machinists, technicians, etc., whatever takes. Pay handsomely work round clock get multiple new facilities online. 

What stopping us this? discouraging news anyone thinks otherwise doesn’t good idea what’s going on. Countries adequate infrastructure also missing covid deaths. somebody else, pretty much everybody Reddit karma w**** even you, don’t right tell karma w**** Well everyone 40 sat inside year protect 65 older, think turn. Sorry hear , tbh dealt even pandemic. Millions get mononucleosis left chronic fatigue syndrome doctors nothing it. tough swallow truth. Covid long haulers different, reason think they're gonna get special treatment given millions around world suffer chronic issues stemming viral infections. It’s inevitable SA become dominant strain US waste time vaccinating hundred million young adults AZ expect mask socially distance summer.

AZ junk comes SA variant. need use effective vaccines know this. got virus way back May. live apartment building concierge permanently sitting right entrance elevator, hall mostly remains closed cold, air ventilation. There's three shifts week. three concierges work week got virus. got infected walked dog walked hall twice day, despite extremely obsessed cleanliness time, included washing dog's paws disinfecting well. None wore mask did, clearly enough. Normal changes everyday. think people Hundred Years' War miss life these, seemed be, never-ending conflicts? 

If pandemic lasts 100 years, going do? Never accept normal? No, adapt, let go cannot again, embrace done. Hoping things work well - SK phenomenal healthcare infrastructure I'm really keeping fingers crossed straightforward rollout.

No. I'm referring total number Americans died past year: three million. three million Americans died cause since pandemic began. worldwide number sixty million.

What’s problem man meant general specifically glad hear you’re good! Wish  Haters going hate great job China, knew Hebei outbreak happened China would control within month.

China shown playbook beat virus yet countries unwilling learn it. average 7779 people died day 2018. still like 1000 people dying Covid day summer, I'll absolutely agree you. like 100, forgive thinking that's drop bucket. wonder rules post misinformation. people trying promote political agenda changed strategies complaining straw man arguments.  year later 😂 dunno think survey flawed. One year disaster fundamentally changed human behavior. major disruptions like 9/11, world wars, etc. always came back behaviors. shameful EU Member States dismissive BioNTech Pfizer going along whole AstraZeneca hype summer fall.

Didn’t know sub old lol mean housekeeper well lab tests translate field trials though? efficacious AZ similar lab tests new strain? That’s psyche though. It’s happening us all, we’re starting care less getting tired bad news. it’s still real, people still dying may get worse yet. Posting things getting worse bad things IMPORTANT.  need situation continue taken seriously. far know unclear whether people infected received vaccine reinfected. know people infected reinfected placebo group. I'm interested combination vaccinated group antibodies previously. combination two prevents illness virus protected strains getting vaccine. 

The fundamental question whether people South Africa antibodies received vaccine protected. one combination conditions. answered essentially same. confidence intervals wildly overlapping. There's nothing would lead believe numbers different clinically meaningful sense statistically speaking. objective evidence points yes. consider near complete lack concerts live entertainment events normal. seeing sporting venues capped 20 percent capacity they're allowed fans all. also normal wear mask essentially wherever go public. Perhaps importantly, totally normal kids ""learning"" Zoom calls they're actually school allowed socialize real meaningful way.

This people mean ""locked down"" now. Feeling lot better family EU now, hope lot Europeans feel positive looking forward next months. Yes I’ll allow it! meant first comment, English first language used wrong words describing thoughts. said complained vaccine, perfectly acceptable vaccine, political points.

WHEN?!? WHERE?!?!

Why hard GOGGLE DAMNED SOURCE. seriously adorable ones tik tok. Makes want trucker look cute driving giant truck. Laughs florida 10k day 100+ deaths really, I’m page FB page schools, lot teachers can’t get appointments, would travel 2 hours, also reporting waiting 2 hours also. aggh. stop. Herd immunity magic number hit it, virus magically goes away. need herd immunity start reduce infections go there. 

Example: Remember saw models beginning one person infects two people next thing know see tens thousands infected people? imagine running model, every 3rd person block chain bcuz either previously infected vaccinated. 1/3, well herd immunity level. 

The result massive drop transmission infection every notch 1/3 affect. likely seeing now, real; also looks like could happening Europe areas also got last big wave right took off. 

Unless there's strain completely cuts around (i.e. something NEW)--which know immediately see massive amounts reinfections case (not isolated reports) IMPOSSIBLE another wave similar last one amount infection already vaccine rollout. seem likely, drop cases likely due fact we're moving away big holidays family gathers instead.

Cases 2020 start naturally dropping April. mention, would decrease reverse. seeing trend reversal happen rapidly spreading disease. 

We literally set new lows cases. Trump’s admin’s action that’s also incorrect.

Vaccine deployment biggest contributor dip cases logistical operational issue. departments dependent charge right now. They’ve vaccine sitting entirety 2020 Trump. 

It’s stupid think Trump responsible sudden change thing last moment presidency pardon sycophants incite insurrection. said mRNA vaccines Yup, I've read well. would probably safest parents quarantined got tested 4-7 days last contact positive case. time probably need quarantine. Dumbest country earth. never said never took changed mind.  said complained vaccine, perfectly acceptable vaccine, political points.

He cast doubts vaccine Trump involved. Yeah, two countries attacked hard early - one used surveillance techniques nobody far capable pushing Europe - greatest example *now*. time needed suppress virus depends initial number cases, airtight lockdown practically impossible, unless want entire population starve death currently infected people die due lack healthcare. Thus, always reproduction number, small - means higher number start with, longer need reach zero. ""now lockdown eradicate"" pipe dream. even pipe dream European countries extremely interconnected can't stop movement goods months, would completely destroy continent.

Shenanigans experts agree probably vaccine attributed yet. OK, great. sounds like already changed position what's reasonable situation lockdown then. whole year later people like continue misconstrue China/WHO said human human transmission? ""No clear evidence"" unequivocal ""no"" thing. Read talking next time look like fool. One good thing falling cases due lockdowns,the rollout vaccines better border control, UK decent shot eliminating SA strain genomic sequencing track tracing. coming months least summer cases low last year anyway despite vaccines.


It mean border controls probably tough long long time though, tough people like seen family year people care original. sequels ain't stopping one partying. Here’s problem though: ask number daily deaths it’s longer worth wearing mask.

I definitely don’t think wear forever even can’t put number it. According logic leave house again, ever.

The topic people going vacation Mexico. That's luxury. even pandemic, people. Going work store whole different story, everybody think reasonable wear masks stores general public (minus people 18) actually gotten vaccinated. Simply able schedule appointment protect COVID. hotline going help movie. I've social distancing since January social/support bubble, barely one COVID. Never mind cases increased spring summer fall orders... Yea I'm buying Cuomo expanding eligibility anything plus. Entire groups whole month sign vaccine did, risk sounding slightly callous sign time allotted snooze lose. We're pandemic can't wait people. Right? Insurance scam, health insurance, outside possibly copays DR/ER visits medications -- pay anything. Americans screwed allow companies get away with. sickening Okay, makes sense. read married people transmit partner 40% time, living house likely it. I'll careful handwashing keep wearing mask think so, overall. I’m sure time, studies published that, though multiple conditions (ie young adult, obese, diabetic kidney issues) covid would concerning. AFAIK can't administer assist already it. We're trained recognize symptoms who've never reaction administer ampules twinject avil Yeah know, thats second comment said lockdown option serious threat hospital get overrun IMO, we're heading toward acting things back ""normal"" end year (i.e. everything re-opened mass gatherings resumed), regardless status pandemic. current protocols mass vaccination campaign help drive disease death, ultimately, even prove effective could be, long vaccine available everyone wants get one ,""normal"" accepting deadly virus part life moving forward. near zero hope it'll ever become wiped completely country. get one develops COVID first second doses vaccine, vaccine still offer protection/immunity longer term? realize vaccine probably hasn’t time take effect help infection immediately, immune system still respond vaccine produce antibodies future? Weight loss free. 

Access healthy foods nice. lose weight, even eating junk food, _controlling calorie consumption_. 

Woman article 300+ lbs obviously couldn’t bothered. That's true, ironically I've avoiding Covid. virus novel once. People get re-infected Rhinoviruses coronaviruses time.....because drift original (novel) from.....but something totally new immune system seen once. Wahoo! currently known basis? would irritated. noticed couple times camera would switch someone mask pulled would almost immediately switch away. whole thing nothing security theater. looks like countries import Chinese people anything China's control it? could low either surrounding countries letting fewer Chinese people China letting fewer people leave both.

Now able prove large enough amount people leaving China go countries first place, I'd inclined believe you. 


All countries listed, also plateaued deaths - realize population sizes miniscule comparison China right? know immensely greater logistical problem control big population? Look India.

Compare China counties similar populations talk. People pay health insurance higher premiums, Tax payers, company certainly say, sorry got sick, heres free care. 🤨 read article commenting on? leader literally said “we need hide data protect China”

He literally not. “quote” nowhere article—you literally made up. Dr. Ryan quoted article saying, “we need hide data,” quoted reference “protecting China” could easily refer protecting reputational harm seen covering things transparent. appears saying it’s also China’s best interests transparent. makes quoted statement article hiding anything public.

At point, I’m still seeing evidence lied. You, however, definitely lied now, I’m starting think you’re one Winnie Pooh’s Internet warriors

That would convenient way dismiss anything don’t already believe, wouldn’t it? Here—let remove convenience:

China Chinese Communist Party repressive, authoritarian regime one worst human rights records world. systematic oppression minorities, particular Uighurs Xinjiang, constitutes genocide crime humanity. China currently lacks democratic legitimacy, rife abuses basic rights freedoms. Fuck CCP, fuck Xi Jinping.

Good enough you? Now, get back undermining global public health efforts blatant dishonesty WHO? Infection typically implies disease-causing agent. exposed benign beneficial microorganisms like probiotics reproduce infections.  picture isn’t 6 feet apart. literally nothing race. Hmm, sound upset, maybe take break internet. hm gosh would thought. miracle.    sarcasm discovered novel coronavirus December 31st first genome uploaded January 5th. know want. Yes. It’s getting annoying  We’re gonna need therapy, like society. wonder long take stop holding breath passing people hall Cases tend lag couple weeks measures put place. suggesting hospitals need overrun lockdowns put place advocating hospitals capacity care COVID-19 patients weeks time.

That's generally lockdown measures put place hospitals get completely overrun.  can! smells like fries boardwalk food! actually, article, hook $42k.  union insurance plan pays rest.   Seems like sort dumb headline. one point. Look New Zealand. dumbasses US let genie bottle, it’s late now. Twitter anti-China/communist rhetoric, anti-Islamic boogeyman boomer scaring along average anti-abortion pandering base.

COVID content exactly ""leopards ate face"" material aside bit anti-teacher union That's zero percent, that's like 20% decrease, give take 70%. basically little data say precision. think vaccinations generally available public, still mandated wear store, public, etc.? Stupid super spreader... COVID-19 year old, know obese far worse medical outcomes. 

If energy put mask-wearing social distancing could invested weight loss...  May ask think case then? places remarkably well, places like CA UK falter despite strict measures? can't afford it. then? Who's paying not?

Also morbid obesity major problem country access healthier foods and/or healthier lifestyle becoming unattainable people every year. 

So maybe cut slack. let's single payer done sh*t Here’s interesting [meta analysis smoking covid risk. “At time review, available evidence suggests smoking associated increased severity disease death hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Although likely related severity, evidence quantify risk smokers hospitalization COVID-19 infection SARS-CoV-2 found peer-reviewed literature. Population-based studies needed address questions.” TLDR: need focused data. Pretty interesting. mean serious threat health services may collapse country ran options lockdown weeks (not months) could thing left do.  amazing many people get this. know 25 year old little overweight thinks higher risk 64 year old parent parent ""fit"".

The risk 25 65 year old may increase risk death. government can’t decide funding, that’s point. It’s contract.

If contract US government, paid. you’re paid, sue government US government can’t file bankruptcy. It’s US government contract. money closest thing guaranteed possible. 

I’m also talking DPA, that’s different conversation. also idea long term means. find fairly disgusting attitude people towards virus women. 

We ahold focusing post xovid research around women. backwards ass gendered approach work. Well we’ll never go back normal you’re saying risks prevent us lifting restrictions, covid never going away hundreds thousands people still get infected every year even vaccines.  comment linking zerohedge.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

And kind military-surveillance apparatus necessary enforce lockdown would disassembled quickly would created. would persist sink bedrock society. American life would never quite same.

TLDR: fucking thanks. making bunch problems worse.  concerts, conventions, sports (in state), online schooling. Things still much closed, probably mostly things participate pandemic notice. absolutely approved US. Novavax hand getting approved ASAP. It’s quite simple said many experts many times

Covid endemic illness. unvaccinated continue die virus small numbers. rest, hospitalizations deaths close zero. aspects life return, bars, restaurant’s, gatherings, sporting events capacity back. Masking, bans large gatherings international travel likely exist little longer mass vaccination. Vaccines provided seasonally whenever it’s determined required. Covid simply become another cause death illness brain dead immunized, akin flu. 

Simple that, it’s opinion shared majority experts could known “I can’t believe people surprised this” 

“3 weeks flatten curve” 

No, return normal don’t, negative effects far outweigh anything covid could do, that’s going WHO’s numbers advice. 

This propaganda, sub that’s actually surprisingly starting wake fair bit. isn’t forever, people won’t take much more. Don’t buy heavy fear mongering realise ways around everyone happy with. kind wacky bullshit this. fed 9 months ago we'd vaccine sept people wanted one would get end year. goalpost shifted shifted shifted here. booster new variant takes year. mRNA takes month two tweak.

Like scientists countries poked around data? never said stop wearing masks now. argument whether safe vaccinated person someone over. Using logic, large enough portion population vaccinated safe stop using masks, although still good idea wear sick. ACE-2 receptors women, even were, confer additional protection (the opposite would probably true).


There is, however, greater heterogeneity two different versions (alleles) gene. Women diversity way ACE-2 receptors encoded expressed due two unique copies gene. Here’s hoping correct. Hell could ask people test free would probably gets 10s 100s thousands volenteers. Lol...are serious?

A foreign correspondent earns £150+k

[As highlighted would suggest, since third time failed think critically, incapable so. unprepared carry conversations adults spend little time reading trying hand again. care approve not. China quickly ramped producing much PPE country needed. manufacture export excess profit.

The US excess capacity produce vaccine doses domestic demand. likely won’t change summer. time we’ll export placed orders. would lock people rest year. that's minimum length time would take starting current huge numbers. Thanks idea, no. Pfizer Moderna effective strains. would need whole new clinical trial. 

Do folks financial interests AstraZ? can’t understand irrational support company. received first shot Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine 02/04/21, get second shot time 02/21/21-03/01/21(I know yet, range). 

I've still never tested positive COVID-19(whether means I've it, without knowing it, know). I'm still wearing mask everywhere go, Social Distancing. 

My question is, test positive COVID-19 second shot? delay getting second shot two weeks tested positive COVID-19, get second shot anyway? 

I know worst case scenario, would like know, can't find information anywhere. drop friends place gathering 20-30 afternoon watch game, leave hit bar another friend, go dinner movie date fiance we’re eating outside northeast winter?

Because somewhat typical Saturday 12 months ago “good chance” mean. everything I’ve read that’s remotely true? Makes sense. best part material impact course pandemic. shape curves follow everybody else. thing material impact actual pharmaceutical intervention. Aka vaccine. open Feb. 16 enough doses provide shots 250 people daily. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once Wisconsin receives doses vaccine, state plans offer 1,000 shots per day open six 10 clinics. think covid-19 restrictions? support lockdowns, maybe them? also support Tanzania's policy zero Covid zero testing aka ""There War Ba Sing Se"". live alternative reality. understand poster said, trolling? NJ, one policing honest. someone going around checking counting breaking up. I'm sure nothing holiday travel. Id rather homosexual dead lol.  I'm okay Newsom. shitty situation around French Laundry thing stupid, he's done lot good things, too. data Alabama:
     
As see cause spike cases actually went event. would assume covid reaches flu level (or maybe bit higher) hospitalizations/deaths masks go standard medical interactions. far general population walmart something, i'd venture guess clear places already peaked peak “This isn’t celebrating Super Bowl,” mayor tweeted Saturday. “It’s safe smart. It’s stupid. We’re going take close look this, may end costing someone lot 50 cent.” understanding vaccines seem good preventing serious disease SA variant. 

Do information regarding vaccines stopping infection spread it, that's gets us herd immunity. even closing ski lifts would start. Lol I’m going bowling later hear word “spike” every mess....

Go look charts Twitter people make using public data. almost correlation predicted “spikes” actually happens. regions mysteriously follow exact damn curve matter restrictions “super spreaders” place. I'm gunna lie guys, hearing UK covid sub talk variant freaking plus accepting rolling lockdowns making consider putting bullet head dropping society. Honestly, either even pandemic, especially restaurants. care health life pandemic, think care pandemic? trust safety business seems care me? likely see another heavy outbreak people disperse Tampa take everything got back respective states. Good article. Thanks.

Too bad choice get. 

Anything better nothing still...looking like whomever gets astrazeneca one chinese ones (coronavax/sinovax) going ""losing end"". Ask county health department. rules probably vary area. county says still wear masks, social distance, etc., vaccination before. counties may differ. 


Of note, takes time covid vaccination body build immunity due new technology used, vaccines tested see would keep carrier even get disease unvaccinated person may still able catch vaccinated person. sub really weird...

The daily discussion thread pretty rational (for part, sometimes skeptic/fearmongering stuff slips by). “good news” posts tend get heavily biased toward overly optimistic, “we opened last year” crowd. Meanwhile, anything scary subject like high case counts reinfections full folks saying pandemic continue forever ever. 

/r/COVID19 better this, sub still lot less awful mental health used be. gotta know avoid. mean, wearing mask sick right thing do. Leif Erikson discovered America around year 1000. told people it... Lol, say like American billionaries exploit workers countries too. Kinda random question: bottleneck vaccination right - vaccine supply, shortage doctors/vaccination centers? 

2 million day incredible, wanna know preventing going faster, maybe help donations. Absolute bullshit. That's true. No, yet. i'm maryland, hogan's impressed lot year. people significant long term effects 

Do data good study shows that? Thanks advance. source that? Maybe neck woods I'll take one: yes. *small study sure official answer spot i'd seen folks day friend's family member arrived, i'd see week later (provided neither friend family member showed symptoms), i'd hang bunch town i'd stay away week reason (this time confirming friend symptoms). 

not perfect system means, kind middle ground could live Face it, Governors done COVID restrictions.

""Hey, cold today. going cold FOREVER!"" - people like you.

I already addressed this. places *temporarily* lifting regulations people like can't bothered listen demanding things understand. new strains everywhere, expect change. not. Maybe we'll deal 5 million dead hospitals closing there's one run them. hey, least get McD's re-open side won.

No one fucking WON. Stop drivel. Uneducated morons forcing people's hands. YAY!

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* ""numbskull"" lol, owned good. know people quick act like KNOW adopt mask-wearing sick folks here. makes sense ""nah 'murica that"". IMO reveals ignorance people wearing face masks Asia even became thing there.

There time people Asia wore face masks slow spread infectious disease. basically grew first SARS outbreak (which hit several countries Asia hard basically non-issue US).

I would frankly surprised DIDNT impact global mask-wearing person sick. suspect external social pressure sick person coughing sneezing farting one's droplets public going shift behavior towards mask usage.

There point US men wore hats norm. CHANGED. could change too. I'm Georgia there's quite Publixes here. country might 2020 part 2. Sputnik AstraZeneca vaccines, Russians stopped sending us vaccines AstraZeneca vaccine work Brazilian strain since mutation South African one right next Brazil. That’s absolutely true, dry bulk carriers spend avg 2 days port vs 8 hours cruise ships.

Airplanes produce less CO2 per KM cruise ships, absolutely, much airplanes travel? compare Caribbean cruise flight England it’s same.

I don’t get hate cruises come from, good environment, absolutely not, neither anything else do. Cruises tiny tiny tiny fraction global environmental issues every time word cruise mentioned talk environment, we’re covid page gods sake. US. incredible people thinking end wave means herd immunity taking effect. third wave. We've two one. Yet somehow everybody thinks one? No. People saying thing first wave true either. Never said enjoyed it... Sorry, summer hard cut friends family 

Does situation matter decision? example, dangerous variant spreading control area, calendar date still important factor you? mind initial lockdowns prevent spread. 11 months I'll take untested vaccine get infected voluntarily decreases ability spread virus recovering actually experience life again.  thanks! yet Governors across states, including deep blue ones agree opening schools, putting fewer restrictions, opening indoor dining, etc...

Nope. forced Republicans morons community care facts cause effect. hard understand people *want* change virus does? ""Appeal false authority"" logical fallacy want stay home COVID eradicated worldwide

Ahh, ol' strawman fallacy. We're well Governors saying ""it okay this"" impact reality opinion favorite doctor.

No one arguing morons ignore expert opinions. mean good happening speak there's nothing it. 

You're right. Morons stupid shit time wishing morons stupid shit asking stop work. Shame, re-open side 

No. fucking didn't. things shut necessity, blame Biden either less. They'll still morons. still using logical fallacies try justify (and your?) moronic actions cost lives economy even more.

As I've said elsewhere, like saying save money car maintenance. Strictly speaking, that's true...up front. exceptionally stupid think beyond tomorrow, doing. look data make conclusion. data shows clear downward trend. think 10% 8000 reasonable finish reopening long trend continues accounts start climbing Vaccines deployed warmer weather right around corner. People age 65 account ~80% deaths county. people vaccinated (or refused shot) within 2 months. numerically impossible overwhelm hospitals point, even let virus run wild among younger populations.... reason reopen point unless we're moving goalposts beyond ""protect healthcare system"". really hard understand? 

I hard time people selfish knowing much cruise ships pollute. You’re right, would’ve taken everyone work. Since everyone participated waste time all, agree. nice new strain give us date it'd arriving. proved point. Screaming racist anyone anything moves get called endless bigotry here. positive going? going home anyways. catch covid today going? Home. Canada quarantine facilities. 3 days hotel make sense. want go one vacinnatted?

Because cruise ships pollution absolutely insane. Valentine’s Day, Presidents’ Day, St Patrick’s day, lunar new year, leif erikson day, owning UK vaccines ban owning UK vaccines, matter much try claim is. I'm grouping restrictions. give 16oz craft brew like $2.

And free hotdog* idiots pro-virus. Sticking head sand make go away. responded intelligently first would fine right now, instead government decided ignore virus let 500,000 people died people cheered go months without eating out. circulating extraverts already caught it. MaSk SiGhT!!!! Reading makes think lockdowns total waste time, sanity, (mostly) money. Yeah thats good point dude Hopefully sub dead point.  experts say transmissible, that's makes successful virus. CT NH :) great news important note clinical trial done SA variant we've seen Novavax J&amp;J would naive us think still provides 95% efficiency new variants. think Novavax/J&amp;J reported dropped like 50-60% SA variant. Pfizer/moderna still work unlike AZ vaccines need updating again. way keep spread incredible slow: complete lock down, 24/7 martial law, National Guard Police force preventing people leaving homes without papers.

A message everyone swings sub.

THIS pro-lockdown crowd wanted talk 'real lockdown'.

**24/7 martial law. ""Your papers, please"". military guarding home stop leaving.**

Compared evil reality, 10% bump annual death rate small price pay. would trust wasn’t state owned propaganda site. opinion. Yeah agreed. disappointing Brit see studies today's studies, think there's lot overpessimism. Hardest thing vaccines production infrastructure, going get better time, even set back one vaccines used. ❤️ Anything suppository brave enough schools opened re-closed due teachers deaths. They'll go back staff vaccinated - think that's right call.

Everything else mostly open minus large gatherings masks requirements. rural schools open various forms. Increasing evidence mRNA vaccines reduce viral loads protects great news. Pfizer vaccine reduces viral loads, increasing evidence vaccines protect infection well disease. unexpected important support robust evidence adjusting cancelled trip see best friend girlfriends family regret deeply. 

Now know another chance. say “entire country” “all numbers”? Yeah aware large parts country open entire time. thought everyone knew conversely large areas country also still trying limit spreading variant strains apparently I’m wrong. northeast 100% “open.” True, surely mask mandates opposite lockdown, right? don’t wear mask don’t leave house.

We shouldn’t wear masks forever (and promise essentially nobody wants to), seems like pretty good way able go outside safely me.  Blood clot brain die covid best guess. fear needs ramped I’d argue SA variant immediate area, there’s need worry much. first discovered US immediate area (Charleston) two different people, neither contact traveled South Africa, suggesting there’s community spread it. cases still dropping sharply. said, scientific, 10% population least first dose far, would say yes, vaccine probably helping point. know stops transmission, question much. ""Choose""? US, sure truly case choice many dying people? sad feeling lot able afford choose. :( months. delta can. block middle row regional. Southwest costs less, packed plane weekend don’t mind others do. I've seen remove comments legitimate criticism various government spokespeople. whole ""surgical masks work"" controversy mods embroiled got crossposted /r/covidiots. Conversations lockdowns effectiveness stifled. Basically personal opinions enforced sub ""high-quality information"" rule. problem news like (negative vaccine news) tends get caught dragnet. I’m getting joke. don’t believe things come there. believe. Except it’s urgent stage since previous vaccination seems quite protective severe disease. Plus you’ll need single booster probably halves logistical burden. may even make covalent COVID/flu shot eventually. ""Trust science"" ""trust data""....unless science data tell story want hear. NYT link referenced tells story clearly. area everyone seems obeying rules. half like 99.5%.

Is rural South Dakota different? likely. even friends mine (urban) Texas Missouri say compliance high. reason let safety protocols. Another spike probable I'm hopeful people get selfish ways death tolls climb again. want get shit beaten moshpit badly. can't wait Summer Fall live music comes back.

These concert live streams me. Atleast enjoyed experience isnt game. bar scene overrun people coming revel gamr one mask wearing properly. We're year deep, nothing permanent except death.

At point we'll know long everything lasts impacts, everyone what's best Even bars open I'm at. thing lingering restrictions large gatherings masks.

The masks probably need stay quite large gatherings get general public. long go. news ripple US doubt Lol war... hogs storming federal biuldings? think holidays over. Im also worried super bowl, like 22,000 people there? Also easter coming up. Must nice. entire northeast locked year still trying put stop spreading variants. Futile apparently, yes, least tried I’m spinning negatively.... clear? great news looking one day’s numbers alone deceiving. article looked one day... compared last Sunday 7 day. Even looking relation last Sunday real good comparison could issues bringing numbers clear. Yea really make event. Spike Lee showed chatted people Yankee stadium one opened last week. Dumb ""good news"" since existed since March, people MD, USA chime in. 

I reading Gov. Hogan's ""Roadmap Recovery"", although I'm peeved specific measurable, seems like Gov. basing restrictions hospitalizations/capacity necessarily ""cases"".

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* going able use parking lot anyways. need focus production getting hands local pharmacies. Virginia 😒 companies spend lot money medical consultants drive decisions. announce solid reopening dates fairly confident ability safely reopen capacity allow least break even. going south since last summer NASCAR college football. Large outdoor events 25% capacity major driver spread read vaccinated sub, makes think 75% terrible side effects. know better still freaked out. 

We need get message better. people posting concerned side effects afraid vaccine ""take."" Ah. Okay. I’m south. We’ve barely closed anything can't speak state, Colorado already re-opening.

We place know of, CA NY eased restrictions recent weeks. Gotta imagine places there. Oh harm done think rude, think first reply bit blunt tbh too. Got bit wound stressed reading news today. Hope week gets better! extent restrictions closed schools (mostly teachers afraid go back), limited indoor dining, massive concerts/crowds.

And mask mandates. Ban travel then. Yeah, think 7 day average new cases 100k (per COVID Tracking Project) Friday, drop continues (about 35% every 2 weeks), getting beneath previous Summertime record 66k-ish around end month around 25k end March. 

Given speed vaccine distribution, could go faster also think unfortunately see lot restrictions lifted sooner (and people willing take risks get cabin fever), hindering drop could have. Uh...I asking question. no, I'm sure 'open' 'open'. live, we've apparently far open place, we've way since June. Booster doesnt AZ (test ongoing mix&amp;match)
But could choose freely would choose AZ Yeah reality go on. US, people 40 comprise 5,500 COVID deaths. Granted, that's lot people, 450,000+, hardly population worry about. trial incorporated people statistically unlikely die anyway, really impossible say vaccine people much higher chance dying. won’t recalling it. definite utility now- places like UK deal whatever comes future. suspect won’t awful, especially get effective vaccines vulnerables’ arms think conspiracy talk politicians wanting extend lockdowns long possible nefarious reason pretty there.

I mean, depends state. Michigan Pennsylvania, states swing, yeah there's one eye economy one eye health.

In Maryland, state RARELY goes one direction... It’s probably true close. can’t really fake much  Typical racist. I've doubt things will, least feel, normal fall.

I'm worried trigger-happy governors hit lockdown button late fall/early winter sign new winter strain. though? evades immunity extent, could spreading faster that. I’m guessing they’ll go “mandatory” “advised required” sometime later year. Basically everyone chance get vaccinated. long case numbers keep falling they’ll quietly forgotten.

I don’t think hard metric. Nobody really knows would guessing. Like everything else pandemic it’s going trying small changes adjusting see situation responds. ""likely incorrect"" lmao, even bother [modicum](http://features.commonwealthfund.org/closing-the-medical-research-gap) back shitty point think depends are. 

In Canada [entire hospitals dedicated COVID elective surgeries cancelled almost 8 full weeks. different management style US public element (so healthcare integrated re: government) even still-- idea can't operate someone's hip enough ICUs still serious. We're near herd immunity levels. Changes mobility causing this. Correct We're finally best something developing drinking problems! I'm tired Canada needing outsource vaccines. We're one richest countries world, ridiculous.  said 
 
Was spike? nuance required. need vaccinating purpose. ""other"" vaccines dominant enough pose significant threat time Oxford's vaccine readily available, means, use it. variants dominant threat emerging strains major concern, mass vaccination Oxford's vaccine might bad--it might work well, might give people false sense invulnerability.

As always, new science research conducted. help stop pandemic, used. That's matters. concern help stop pandemic, though, continue feature ever-evolving virus need get front like flu shot. lot worse places work Publix, used work making $17/hr part time stock clerk college shares 6yrs paid last semester school. still couple friends work there, used be, still good.  cultish, hours suck, bad manager make rough, OP seems idea. Pointing glaring issues pandemic handled require personally solution fits every single nation. got tired seeing misinformation spread #ZeroCovid people twitter whose singular focus stopping COVID completely ignores side effects takes get there. vent here. anti-lockdown, think COVID huge threat health system public, think need change behavior fight this. also think closing schools 10+ months disaster hate circles saying pessimistic thing means ""taking seriously following science"". Side effects lockdowns obvious threat COVID decreases. Seems unlikely AZ able stop spread considering even protect SA strain. 52.4 mil confirmed (43.7 mil EU contract + 8.7 mil Germany contract) based sheet provided Merkel &amp; Co. days ago vaccine- summit. 14mil predicted based BioNTech CEO's comment he'll supply 75 mil EU Q2 new 300 mil contract. I'm group c moving closer group time gone on. I'm weeks away 2nd dose, I'm becoming cautious gotten virus, and, point, there's chance might get all. want keep odds. people rabid ""normal"" need reality check, comment meant tamper expectations. Yes, I'd consider description ""normal"". Even correct, know political leanings put democrats work essential jobs ridiculous. think masks remain healthcare settings well. that's deaths toll worst nation!

EDIT: Sorry, 30th. US also source Q3 done vaccinating own. Thank you, you. :) zero examples people saying nothing change then? think one mesh covers meant keep grease popping 46% enough herd immunity. 

Herd immunity work way think - get ""half immune"" population half total needed.  get non immune population.

Imagine room 100 people it, 46 immune.  virus still going try infect 54 people. long enough vulnerable people remain, virus continue on.

Vaccination recovery give people immunity, mostly changes gets infected, many. right, makes sense do, no? Interesting.
I think it’ll probably level around 40,000- 50,000 new cases get close herd immunity. 

Deaths probably drop precipitously 65+ risk crowd vaccinated though. 

Barring things getting much worse new variants, think we’ll 1 major case spike people relax much deaths plummet. Outdoors.

Spaced out. Making decisions would much easier media could write like you. Thanks. Waiting confirmation Chechnya “When polls said half Americans would take vaccine, saying herd immunity would take 70 75 percent,” Dr. Fauci, took first dose Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine Tuesday, told Times. “Then, newer surveys said 60 percent would take it, thought, ‘I nudge bit,’ went 80, 70% 85% US population fully vaccinated Covid-19 country begin return sense normalcy, Fauci told CNN Tuesday dark winter Americans see end


I mean Google it. news saying. Stop. mentioning happened first couple months novel virus. Ever since scientists vs. Politicians masks.  insurance designed union, insurance company. chose OOP (Out Pocket) maximum.

I also employer based self-insurance. menu options premiums. took $0 premium $24,000 maximum out-of-network OOP. But, could paid premiums less deductibles OOP. rolled dice got away it, $24,000. One thing missing story whether patient could chosen different plan OOP cap.

Right now, $10,000 maximum OOP Medicare Advantage, reached age employer kicked retiree coverage. think absolutely nothing, think effectiveness massively overstated, studies ""proving"" work fell one 3 categories:

1. Models baseless assumptions. e.g. ""If assume masks reduce particle transmission 50%, R0 drops 1.0 25% less deaths no-mask model.""

2. Studies based circumstantial evidence. e.g. ""After Spain implemented mask mandate, cases dropped significantly. Therefore mask mandates associated reduction infections."" bonus points, many studies redacted Europe's fall surge cases.

3. Lab studies looked particle size made various assumptions particle size infectivity. e.g. ""Cloth masks saw 50% reduction particles compared control test. Therefore cloth masks would reduce infections 50%."" That's flawed logic consider people get infected encounter minimum threshold viral load, often exceed it. spend 30 minutes bus next someone COVID, twice likely get infected person wearing mask. probably gonna get infected regardless. There's never double-blind study comparing infectiveness actual COVID patients wore masks versus didn't.

Once factor stuff that's affected mask mandates, household transmission % infectivity asymptomatic people compared symptomatic people (symptomatic people infectious, also less likely go public places), I'm really, really skeptical much mask mandates actually protect others.

For real-world examples, look Minnesota Wisconsin. Neighboring states extremely similar demographics nearly identical case death numbers. Wisconsin mask mandate almost zero enforcement, packed bars, shutdowns. Minnesota mask mandate strict enforcement, attorney general fine businesses refuse comply bankruptcy, shut 6 weeks last winter. That's perfect double-blind study, comparison good ever gonna get. particular case, really hard argue mask mandate shutdowns much Minnesotans. western vaccine invaded Iran’s pure borders comment doesn’t get record upvotes I’m Article says covered kind thin metal cover looked way solid turned be. danger literally hidden him.  volunteer this? thought said people go horde masks like toilet paper? Pretty sure Fauci recently responded this. 40 U.S. theme parks avoided bubbles open eventually.

In Europe (and US?) live rabies bubble - let animals places rabies prevalent enter country. humans, two week managed quarantine would suffice.

There enough people within zero covid countries provide tourism other. happily fly within green zone, tell grandkids stories West heyday. Stories hard believe. got 2nd dose Moderna almost 2 weeks ago. ""warm"" whole day hit fever range 24 hours injection. realized fever going 101.9 decided take advil broke quickly. slept fine that.

Everyone reacts different I've advising everyone plan anything day case. Well thats good thing imo. numbers dropping sharply reasons vaccine, imagine like start taking affect. think that's fair. guess like: know, minor inconvenience \*could\* help, what's harm? also pretty obvious think sneezing mask open subway (I swear people go elementary school learn sneezing/coughing etiquette) would reduce spray drops. course, prove masks help all, I'm opinion big ask people anti-mask entitled. Yes, annoying, lot life annoying anyway trying help people. LA Dec/Jan pretty horrific afraid anything, want something provides best protection regular disease variants - lot people contract “mild” disease lose sense smell / taste indefinitely develop “long haul” syndrome. “Mild” covid always cold. good news, US Flu activity lowest February record. flu season incredibly tame accounts. almost certainly attributed measures taken combat COVID, like social distancing, mask wearing, hand washing. question regarding this. family ( mom, dad, sister) meet family barbecue home vaccinated risk have? Unless someone vaccinated visiting allowing visit either. go public mask socially distance others. vaccinated family collectively decide family get together see huge risk is. actually communicating wear mask whole time... maybe go ham one. tend agree see point wearing you’re close proximity others outdoors.

I MN it’s ungodly fucking -10 days end. Keeps face warm doesn’t bug much. That's one better metrics. Deaths also. opinion scientific data. equivalence social media created fear scientific papers.

Sorry said clearly enough. need accommodate weird views. sit quiet.

You get say ""but society"", trumpet individual rights others society. shush. mean everyday regular people rather politicians, Dems leaning demographics heavily outnumber Republicans leaning demographics. 
Top 5 states per capita death - NJ NY MS RI (4 5 blue). minorities, heavy dem lean, much 5x likelihood death vs whites, lean R. Although suppose deaths also elderly, leans R, disease behavior. Ok? Cancer definitely puts increased risk covid complications though... it’s kind important mention stories shared Well “When polls said half Americans would take vaccine, saying herd immunity would take 70 75 percent,” Dr. Fauci, took first dose Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine Tuesday, told Times. “Then, newer surveys said 60 percent would take it, thought, ‘I nudge bit,’ went 80, 85.


In words literally keeps moving goal people comply... definition ""moving goalposts"". Exactly this! think hospitalizations real variable watch vaccines could impact soon top seasonality declines. Here's vaccine eligibility phases far
  
Outside nursing home, geriatric population never time sign flood gates opened 65+ crowd. Oh really? got media gripe? happy science? communicating wear mask entire time? COVID denier? conciedence candidate (who changed nothing) gets office, world saved. People tired Democrat propaganda. Reddit go Goebbels-level media 100 years. day since January 8.

&amp;#x200B;

Interesting happened right new admin took power. Could directly related? sure made difference overall drops cases deaths. 

&amp;#x200B;

It sucks took new admin come many deaths could avoided. Seems like fall would realistic timeline. sure live live taking 2 months get first dose vaccine eligible.

We course talking wearing masks public spaces like stores. friends vaccinated earlier (or not) free whatever want private gatherings. thought Autism reason enough get vaccinated.....
/s wait til 'ole superbowl superspread kicks fam time stop living fear long past should’ve happened A) become clear many solutions way B) become clear media lying pandemic purposely publishing fear porn daily basis since started. plenty evidence vaccines reduce  still great. havent even dipped 3k yet, despite cases cut half. get lag almost month decreasing, shouldnt seeing deaths decrease faster now. issue define ""serious"" 

To long hall COVID, scares lungs, impacts brain serious. get feeling reading press releases friends long covid, need medical intervention defined serious medical studies. define serious. AZ/J+J stands today going get back normal.

Hopeful J+J second dose Navavax deliver better results. city healthcare workers know appreciated this. obviously hollow, sometimes symbols nice. really must desperate! Fauci said many times even get vaccinated still wear mask, can't travel, can't see family, etc. basically telling remain lockdown even vaccination. think make many people wonder get vaccinated first place. 2 weeks expected time begin seeing cases, deaths supposed lag 4 weeks.

This commonly held timeframe entire time. remember ""yeah 2 weeks!""

So would expect massive spike cases late January, massive spike deaths early February. Yeah, mask mandates all, health authorities exaggerating evidence mentioning uncertainty. 

[Compare American CDCs defenseless COVID-19,” said CDC Director Dr. Robert R. Redfield. “Cloth face coverings one **the powerful weapons** slow stop spread virus – particularly used universally within community setting. Americans responsibility protect themselves, families, communities.”

[To Dutch CDCs seems **likely** face masks help prevent infecting others, ""**but limited extent**. It remains important everyone comply the  coronavirus measures basic rules. Stay least 1.5 metres others, avoid crowded places if you symptoms, stay home get tested. Previous estimates indicated disproportionate number people public spaces would wear face mask prevent one single infection. However, number contagious people Netherlands risen significantly ratio prevention longer disproportionate. **It possible state certainty within short term whether face masks additional effect.**

These health policy officials looking data drawing wildly different conclusions present public. really fascinating. 75-84% effective dominant strain UK really really hope goal posts(which already shifted dramatically course last year) shift (mostly) normal summer completely normal fall. one 3 people immune would slow spread course. Slowing spread mean unable still spread, especially new variants considerably contagious.

You could well right, going around covid19 information subreddit saying stop posting information scientists good news doesnt make sense. 

Personally havent coronavirus yet 90%+ friends acquaintances havent either continue test negative. everyone know hasnt vaccinated yet im standing seems like early claim absolute certainty smooth sailing here. like ban Florida teams playoffs? Yeah people need eat inside restaurants go drinking bars allow food service workers starve... Maybe it’s flaw system flaw shutting businesses keep people safe starve lose minimum wage job. maybe instead giving money wall street churches, government bailed everyday people, actual small businesses... I’m interested repeating said. I’m aware could lead serious problem aren’t exploding origin countries? Cases plummeting. Truth told take covid serious people. wear mask basically haven’t left house anything besides essentials year. You’re seeing things aren’t there. far tell, Congresspeople short list. would mean chose get it. scenario 3 regarding ""normality"" must say makes sense yes? think that's people say want things ""normal"". That's great achievement, finalized deal January, 8th.

These doses possible new Biontech production facility Marburg, Germany (paid taxpayer money).

China managed secure 100 million doses facility back masks mandatory business closures like bars, entertainment venues gyms. Unfortunately not. Still convinced vessels convenience flags LNG even dual fuel 90%. mean, think depends you’re speaking you’re located. (From perspective US)

If you’re conservative leaning/rural area, definitely see posts “how dare people say restrictions must continue forevermore” would seem pretty extreme. Likewise, you’re place that’s severe restrictions, opposite viewpoint would seem crazy extreme. 

I say hard anti-mask/antivax folks life who’ve throwing parties living normally last year. also say folks seem expect living lockdown wearing masks rest lives. Social media mixed bag types people, sharing emotional/fearful/sincerely felt viewpoints matter. existing science support masks pretty shaky-at best probably help little bit, time don’t enough affect change things significantly. everyone wearing N95s would different story can’t really go pushing “any mask better none!” “only N95s stay safe!”. way public uses masks isn’t really way they’re ‘supposed’ used, like using sterile ones wearing correctly wearing beard. might help bit used perfectly it’s N95, part shouldn’t considered line safety danger like people. 7 day rolling average absolutely way go.

True, real numbers going better rolling average would make seem, since really trailing average. Even people 1B group still issues access vaccinations areas. imagine instead gays jews? ill sometimes cannot vaccinated. going help stop disease spreading though people still get sick. vaccine, treatment CNN seeing declining cases: one ever can....

Because doesnt exist , point. That’d seen sort phobic racist something. People go jail publicly shamed wearing them... like now. Two days ago tweeted schools re-open state. say ""he"" tweeted it? actually busy dying hospital, he'd previous 2 weeks. someone team used personal twitter account send message saying Covid big deal time congressman *dying covid*.

It's people party guy. guy. staff. gaslit themselves. Yes. Incompetence vulgaris. everything back normal, endless summer music festivals attend.

Music Festivals socialization experiences like high school sped x100. Overblown one possible scenarios direct evidence yet, media great accurately communicating risk sharing nuance behind truth throughout whole thing. Ah OK, we're getting somewhere. would say couple months opens up- say hopefully that's around June/July- hopefully start evaporating mitigation efforts. Oh I’m Op, realized reading idea *when* say “it’s go back normal”, can’t put philosophical value human life calculate cost saving one. matter give green light probably result least one death. that’s hard thing imagine conscience making call I'm way religious, keep husband thoughts make sure appreciate mean much husband you. Stay strong.  However, Iran accepts existence transsexuals natural state covers gender reassignment free. gays would claim trans order live they’re caught. vaccines widely available April, see widespread immunity end May. 

Right vaccinating rate 30-40 MM per month, 40MM done far. end March puts us around 120-130MM least 1 shot - 270MM adults. April closer 50MM, 170-180MM - north 60% adults least 1 shot, significant portion 1 shot only. 

With case rates already plummeting, numbers miniscule mid late spring. tiny case numbers empty hospitals mean restrictions gone. Vietnams population 96 million 200mil. Please Google it, implore you. evidence thrown far really holding much water applaud trying. 🥖 submarine? Idk I’ll bit careful say “you take breathe away” Where? When? volume? 'Read headline, one day Superbowl.' Novavax stronger original variants many politicians think died overall? 

[From local federal there's 500k politicians Even every politician got virus, would mean around 3,500 would die. reality maybe 30% gotten it, probably lower considering engage public much workers. December way way we're vaccinating? Seems pretty obvious. think country mentally economically survive another summer plagued restrictions. 

I could agree statement tried. Neither party wants restrictions. political capital implement all. 0% anything really loose restrictions summer probably enforced well. Welp, long SA variant ends posing threat new variants spring problem, good late summer would think.

Whether mindset people entirely different question.

But there's plenty things summer outdoors without pandemic force, I'm concerned personally. Yes Nevermind case numbers got worse election. Spikes infections holidays documented way back 1918 flu pandemic. nothing new common sense--you collect bunch people different households together indoor space pandemic odds gatherings someone infected spread others attending. That's common sense.  


Valentine's Day hopefully different though indoor dining bit cringe worthy. one eating mean stop spewing virus infected technically, still would bunch people gathering different households betting nobody present infected. I'm personally curious see pans NYC. Personally, I'd plan romantic dinner home. Looking % population immunized, NYS pretty marginal. 

Cuomo's vaccine distribution plan deserves scrutiny, seniors upstate really struggling schedule appointments.

Meanwhile Cuomo continues expand eligibility exacerbate current bottleneck. Seems like there's LOT assumptions who's spreading.

The poster talking cases, yes, slightly higher effect case counts vaccinating less likely slip asymptomatic cases, dramatic.

But healthcare workers outsized spreading amount? Doubt it.

People nursing homes? Definitely not. They're basically end node. 

I think people outsized share spreading pretty high overlap delay avoid vaccination.  Nurse Karen rejected vaccine inviting 4 families dinner party. Grocer Steve always nose hanging stocking shelves thinks Bill Gates going chip him.

While vaccinated population definitely outsized share hospitalizations deaths, numbers seen even bit longer deaths particular really trail cases due paperwork everything. basically says idea vaccine even works cancer patients since data says talk individual doctor. basing friends going cancer told chemo we’re told get vaccine. Ooooh bro don’t get it? lot built indoor dining still thing limited capacity. Creating enclosed structures like originally increase capacity Maybe changing PCR testing protocols what’s actually considered ‘case’ day Biden gets office. 

More political BS. restrictions NL gone insane even though winter peak less last spring/summer. curfew imposed, baselessly, extended baselessly 'hunch'. one asked us okay. Meanwhile cases remained pretty low Manhattan ""omg much density open restaurants"" 7 day rolling average absolutely way go. numbers depressed Sunday Monday, Holidays, many states report days.

I'm sure Iranian comments referring to.  I've seen lot now, honest question, trolling opportunity: guys think specific date matters? see specific *condition* (50% vaccination, cases 100/day, whatever), date thing makes sense me. guess maybe better way phrase question ""If going stop July 1 regardless conditions, stop now? even *last* July 1?"" feel weird mask outdoors, especially near someone else. watch TV shows, first thing think ""wow none masks on, tsk tsk.""

Yeah gonna take get past. experience well. Set middle night, felt awful day, woke middle following night sweaty AF feeling much better. wonder multiple levels Paradise stupid dead go eternally happy. Chin diaper. leadership dropping dead left right stupidity, might want consider criteria using select leaders, take advice grain salt. variant killing leading massive sickness age group (we're late 20s- early 30s) yes. variants showing that.

It still elderly people issues....and elderly people getting vaccinated....and vaccines proven prevent death among group even variants. 

Let rephrase: done summer even remotely similar situations now....we letting people want Lockdowns last forever change paramaters reopening. first time since pandemic, even feel like medical guidelines restrictive... understand continuing mask &amp; distance public spaces reach herd immunity. makes sense. continue mask &amp; distance vaccinated? They're asking much.

Since I'm high risk, I've isolating almost year now. get vaccinated need goddamn hug. need sit next someone couch. need hold hands. need look someone's eyes see lips curve smile.

I public spaces entire time. get vaccinated, happily wear mask social distance strangers - know people vaccinated virus still going spreading around.

But fucking tell can't loved one hug me. fucking tell wait 80% population vaccinated - people disregarded safety, pushed isolation trust wear mask. vaccine effective, solution society until/unless get - solution individual. would google advisory committee briefing documents watch meeting. internet.

As total disclosure raw data that's like tens.of thousands hundreds thousands pages documents may include things like original physician notes. doubt get those.

The advisory committee materials enough give pretty good picture everything vdL sagt viel, wenn der Tag lang ist.

Sah für mich wie eine Lebensversicherung aus und der Vertrag sollte besser auch ausgestaltet sein, ansonsten wäre das wirklich unterste Schublade, nachdem man den Italienern im Frühjahr während der Eskalation Bergamo mal lustig die Schutzausrüstung vorenthalten hat. hospitals.

As long try require masks concerts mass gatherings, I'm gonna put much fight. cousin fiance like them, 52, he's 55, health problems lifts runs daily. decided take vacation Mexico, pretty much maskless around resort sightseeing. 6 days got home, came Covid, gave sister cousin one grandchildren. sister died. cousin got pneumonia recovered. got blood clots legs looks like he'll recover grandchild ok. 

&amp;#x200B;

 cousin finally realizes wrong said never sicker life. He's still pretty much denial train . still believe deniers primarily selfish people use conspiracy theories denial rationales support able want. idiot see videos Er's ICU's look like easy Google many people hospitalized die flu annually compare statistics Covid. there's much evidence right face daily basis deny bad is. Completely anecdotal, couple good friends mine consistent stringent wearing masks, distancing, etc., messaged day board game said ""when COVID guys need play us!"" 

I think that's *most* general public might asked- seeing restrictions inconvenience pandemic, also expecting end date looking forward getting back things able do. 

Not anecdotally, know internet/social media amplifies polar viewpoints. Drill team six! Well lot people stupid... California opened up, plus holidays. Gas-lighting term questioning one's perception reality truth, right? so, believe right term use. think know virus dangers real. tried convince everyone otherwise slow economy means slower personal cash flow. isn’t article much opinion months ago, wrote Americans embraced backwards view coronavirus. many people imagined fight COVID-19 land war waged sudsy hand-to-hand combat grimy surfaces.

There way going know rather scientists people admitting that, fill science gap doom gloom guesses simply hold scrutiny.

Wisconsin another great example. saw vote person spring, told gonna disaster. S. Ct strikes covid measures, told MURDER.

Meanwhile, nothing happens WI September latest wave started every state normal wave like state numbers average far deaths per million, etc. Better MI sure.

I family friends WI. friend told day keeps mask rare case business requires it. one day approached Uber mask-less driver said dont need buddy. completely opposite Las Vegas yet data almost per capita.

&amp;#x200B;

I moron anti-masker/denier. followed data every single day beginning get impression others agree come similar conclusions own.  J&amp;J 60% iirc. great, terrible. big reason Scandinavian countries reluctant embrace masks want people think masks substitute social distancing. Meanwhile America sports arenas, casinos, museums, amusement parks filled people convinced mask requirement makes impervious COVID. it. picked 'Papers, please!"" route, panicked.

That's understandable. states too. 

March/April scary time. talk 4% death rates. Thankfully, turned 0.25-0.75%. probably still good enough get approved since concern SA variant far along process relevant

Oxford-AZ 10% effective African variant. get R0 anywnhere near 1, let alone below. Antibody tests negative. I'm hoping that's case though around numerous active populations point, frankly, I'd rather already done it. maybe fact wear glasses, constant stuffy nose, type blood made super resistant according random click-baity articles lol somw teeth removed felt badly wanted die illegal access dweeb. Majority politicians never tweet themselves, staff them. one said care roller coasters, care getting back living life fullest want to. virus defeated. Vaccines always light end tunnel, here. tell me?

I think there's question morbidly obese. (definition: least 100 lbs overweight)

If assume 5'0"", ""only"" 200 lbs (she's clearly, visually obviously nowhere even close 200 lbs) would _still_ 70-100 lbs overweight! Russians good scientists, never understood vector vaccine much better Western vector vaccines. agree sentiments. Unfortunately sub become inundated people 'want over', cautious sentiment downvoted oblivion. lot pent-up angst frustration flowing around undermine logical discussion decision-making.

That reality modern humanity; actually comes it, people value personal comfort collective well-being. truth live with, think futile push back it. Again...yikes. 

Note taken original point (being frustrated mere word ""experts"" past year) completely stretched suggesting anti-science/intellectualism, pro-invading Capitol, well-adjusted, Nazi. 

Go away. one Remember everyone lying us whole lives really works upstairs? Well still same. Exactly I’ve been. Got first dose shy two weeks ago, point I’m close end I’m taking risks Hope prepared another spike Super Bowl. think sub stay discuss topics like covid aftermath effects. Probably gonna lot studies era Aren’t zero vaccines connected long term issues? Like case decades. Make spotted cow. Coming stupidity, lol. Two hour drive problem. one symptoms problematic vaccine distribution. I’m avoiding anything, plan getting vaccinated one 2 approved vaccines USA soon can. 

Please leave alone, thank you. I'm member family living states. I'm from, parents live in, Barmstedt, Schleswig-holstein. want visit 😡 Herd immunity yes/no thing either don't. 

Why people keep saying this? quite literally yes/no thing. nature herd immunity yes/no proposition. herd immunity reached, changes mobility increase number cases. changes mobility increase number cases, herd immunity that's causing changes number cases...it's mobility! herd immunity levels reached remains 1 cases continue decline even changes mobility.  resembles science.

It drifts away science insistence everything ever know COVID already know now. 

Have ever said that? common mistake arrogant people like condescending anyone dares different perspective.

It's quite common mistake arrogant people assume right something feels right without presenting evidence supports theories. lol, always something spread. Let's turn agoraphobics. everyone vaccinated, even variants bad. still people getting sick, doubt variant makes vaccines completely useless. protection better none long end hospitalized serious issues. I’m D, rest family Bs Cs. Thankfully, none us gotten Covid, still feel jealous haven’t seen anyone 1 close family friend siblings going almost every day see theirs. PCR test almost never wrong. user error, contaminated samples etc etc could give false positive. also possible rare developed little immune response first time thus infected twice. Russian heritage don’t see shred xenophobia discussion. wouldn’t trust vaccine anti-Vaxxer Covid truther. 50 millionish people point. else need US country world duh boring dystopia kind post? time people Asia wore face masks slow spread infectious disease. basically grew first SARS outbreak (which hit several countries Asia hard basically non-issue US).

I'm impressed confidently wrong here. mere Google search reveal inaccurate assertion is. Hahaha, CNN bad. unique refreshing take.  therefore personally want maximum “idiot protection.”

You intend achieve avoiding vaccines proven nearly 100% effective kind severe illness. also wear one stores infect cashiers. :) Silver Dollar City opened June last year ran early Jan. figure able open height covid, summer breeze. enforced masks pretty diligently least. Keep mind deep hick country southern Missouri. people socially distancing game teleported past people get home? lol 
It stupid attend cuz there’s risk inside clearly Yes that’s take it. Thankfully choice country therefore comfortable MRNA technology. Thank you, im teacher, gf it, fucking fine. promise % people long haulers actually undiagnosed health anxiety. ALL, minor symptoms. governments terrible prioritizing. California suggested. tier system vaccine rollout far worst entire country article also touch hygiene theater considering mask wearing (such athletes sitting sideline immediately sweating face-to-face 20 minutes time) probably get wider helpful array responses post r/COVID19positive :) conditions keep changing.

We initially told flatten curve, keep hospitalizations low....the variants (which knew going happen) havent changed calculus that, simply mean vaccination needs occur faster achieve result.

I say pushback people posts seriously demanding need social distance next 3-5 years. accept shut downs even hospitalization rate low...how realistic?

We can't another year, never thought I'd say this, see point anti Lockdown people goalposts moving....we shutting everything ruining livelihoods stop cases, we're stop Healthcare system falling apart. 

We feel like safe us summer since we'll vaccinated ourselves, older family members. want parties get togethers, go bars etc. friend group put foot much it'll except. go make scene, we're probably going stop listening quietly. Yeah, like happened Christmas holidays... need contact EMA first request conditional market authorization. date non-Western vaccine makers done so. seems working now. sure happened.

Thanks though! course, that's said mid-late spring. Spring ends June 20th. started group B moved C learned supposed permanent lung damage. I’m singer, singer friends said can’t even sing usual level expertise MONTHS afterwards. Yeah, Caucasus. Balkans kindergarden comparison. No. 

We first grade Biontech efficacy 95%. EU doesn’t need F-grade vaccine China.  Pillow guy said now? Hell, open bars around stadiums people prove vaccinated. didn't. Could error, let check out.

Edit: Everything seems work end new old reddit desktop. CA saw cases explode, lockdown like UK, come thereafter. entire smarmy snide point loses steam look places NEVER really opened major outbreaks. See CA, MI, MA, etc. Also, go back UK look lockdown started watch cases go regardless (entire Europe) fall duration typical wave. Single dose excellent two-dose results? Chinese Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. thou 100%. teen shit still great income. Buy want, whatever want. 

Also stay school. Illinois. ever seen school fish? dudes never social distance 3 days test result ? US got PCR result hours able fly back Canada ... frankly I'd rather pay 500$ get result day quarantine hotels 2000$.These measures make sense, focus vaccination instead always blaming travelers comply self quarantine home ? 
We travel vacation, family US Europe, really choice. Novovax despite overall cases going due lockdowns.

Is really due lockdowns though? Cases across US well, even parts locked down. call anyone thread idiot - referring people encountered pandemic. offended perhaps it’s resonates behavior. 

Either way previous comment uncivil removed. you’re saying cases dropped 100k Sunday? Also winterweather already effect November (so doesn’t really matter say affects significant amount). Nissan Stadium Nashville huge testing site us. Vaccines given old people frontline healthcare workers right now. I'm sure Nissan stadium test vaccinate vaccines available. Sooo guess stadiums participating testing that's think participate vaccines? I'm sure stadiums may provided testing past year. pretty cool stadiums available vaccinations. Oh shut  That's still extremely high. Iranian clerics *obsessed* state becoming homosexual? Novavax UK? makes nervous. family UK. would like see them. would like us live, rather exist; costs worth continuing all. Seeing damage - suicides know - despair - destroying children - awful. said people lost sight: would drag hospital capacity frankly vulnerable vaccinated thrown done here... understand extremely cost effective way testing sewage tests running $500-750 

And would opportunity put supply chain reporting framework place support pathogens contaminants detected way.  not.

The UK rep. selected government pushing line backed UK up.

Keep ure fakenews yourself.

If hung friends hours wore mask whole time (let’s say didn’t), chances bringing Covid home unknowingly it? one suggested Maybe true are, slowly shut state run testing sites. 4 sites near us 1. caused really long waits site highly populated urban area.  get tested urgent care centers pharmacies free.  

They also shut public testing sites lower income areas, makes testing inaccessible huge portion population. sites located school campuses shut schools reopened replaced. 

I think really depends live. Hospitalizations deaths plummet herd immunity, though. S. African variant like covid-20 sequel last year. lockdowns never end Yeah...there going lot Millennials going deal life long consequences. sad situation, lot people want deal hand reality dealt us. arguing OP, me. country vaccinated larger % population America. Normalcy returns hospitalisations deaths plummet thanks vaccines. Midwest barely 0 lot people want go outside either. OHHHH.

OKAY. ""the fans buying cutouts"" missing link made make sense. Thank much, confused. need research damage suffered apparently asymptomatic cases. Chinese study found example lung damage lungs 30% asymptomatic cases, organs affected. far asymptomatic cases rarely get close examination. job still temperature checks.

When casino 80-miles east LA reopened last March, live broadcast KFI celebrate/advertise.

I kid not, show host (saying safe casino being) said:

Fans club buying cutouts sit “place” game goes on. Looking SB packed streets Tampa think Covid pandemic exist. think basically happening summer country. Regardless medical doomsayers say, Americans go back living lives normally soon. Losers say whaaaat?🤪 Yes, original posters claim actually vaccines work need give absolutely fucking delusional. Normality returns vaccines actually prevent hospitalisations deaths. 1 dose still amount protection.

Ahhhhhh ok. Reddit blows getting feeling behind comments.

To clear comment fuck CCP. stand people china CCP. quite English... Yea..........after multiple respiratory 'scares' year lot covid tests negative, started taking Allegra regularly lot issues cleared up. think developed low level allergy cat without even knowing it, thinking getting sick lot. Great, can’t wait get back normal. think, rate, able go back normal 0 capacity/activity restrictions summer. 

I dismayed hear increasing number politicians (and press secretary) say social distance/wear mask. That’s science based, all. 

I wonder society accept future lockdowns vaccine fully rolled out. sure hope participate True - question when, if. many people going die process. impacts long-haul COVID cases are.

I surprised end getting COVID shots every year like flu shots though. UK population 68 EU 447 million, according Wikipedia. AstraZeneca doses per capita UK. seriously less testing?

Probably downside vaccines, people figure ""eh end soon, need worry test"". Unfortunately seems zero covid approach solution. worked China, New Zealand, Australia east Asian countries. Australia right tennis championship held live audience. 

But doable countries virus already spread? group soon vaccinated well. Ah nope. would wager plan tweak vaccine address variants, given they've already built infrastructure mass produce doses one leading candidates developing world.

No idea happen US though. Still developed country. complete Yeah never understood this, cheap harmless method, promote vit , zinc selenium, works good still good plenty deficiency weird? Anyone buy shares Moderna. feel biggest issue clue soccer games make money. know clubs consist multiple teams. know teams play leagues. selling cutouts games

Who sells cutouts? part ""game"" purchasing? Americans come first America. Sorry. idea, I'm UK much aggressive approvals. think AZ running huge trial US read soon hopefully get (less muddled) data that. - AZ actually running one better Oxford run trials we've previously. Australia's GDP figures much better Germany US. Dang that’s crazy. Meanwhile cruise booked summer. cases dropped like stone.

Should concerned ? Public told trust vaccine study shows reduced effect South African variant 



The public confidence Oxford jab despite evidence less effective South Africa variant coronavirus, vaccines minister says.

Writing Telegraph, Nadhim Zahawi says vaccines used Britain “work well Covid-19 variants currently dominant UK”.

It follows announcement Sunday new findings show Oxford University-AstraZeneca jab protect mild moderate infection South African variant.

South Africa announced Sunday putting AstraZeneca programme hold poor efficacy variant emerged country. health minister suggested 22 per cent effective variant. 

A new Oxford vaccine beat South African variant likely ready autumn, designers said.

It comes amid concern reluctance get vaccine among black, Asian minority ethnic (BAME) communities. Royal College General Practitioners figures show 14.4 per cent white people jab compared 6.8 per cent black people. 

In coming weeks Government set plans increase take groups. 




More 12 million people received first dose vaccine, almost 1,000 jabs per hour administered one point weekend. Government course beat target offering vaccine over-70s clinically vulnerable people Feb 15.

Another 373 deaths reportedon Sunday, lowest figure since December, deaths, infections hospitalisations continue trend downwards.

It also comes ministers believe employers insist staff get vaccinated Covid laws governing health safety work.

The idea 'vaccine passports' - would allow employers insist upon proof vaccination - dismissed ""discriminatory"" Government, Telegraph understands issue centre row Cabinet ministers arguing favour scheme.

A collaboration Oxford University Witwatersrand South Africa found viral neutralisation sera induced AstraZeneca jab “substantially reduced” B.1.351 South Africa variant compared original Covid strain.

The study, conducted approximately 2,000 volunteers average age 31, could determine whether current AZ vaccine prevents serious disease death B.1.351.

However, Oxford scientists said likely so. pointed recent study South African Janseen using similar vaccine technology indicated protection severe disease preserved.

Mr Zahawi described emergence new variants Covid “worrying”, said: “We bear mind recent studies show vaccines deployed right across UK appear work well Covid-19 variants currently dominant UK.

“In terms variants, UK, need aware even vaccine reduced efficacy preventing infection may still good efficacy severe disease, hospitalisation, death. vitally important protecting healthcare system.”

A tweaked version “workhorse” AstraZeneca vaccine currently development, could rolled fraction regulatory hurdles seen first jab.

The team Oxford’s Jenner Institute said also preliminary stages preparing version combat Brazilian variant, one required.

Professor Sarah Gilbert, designed Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, told BBC’s Andrew Marr show: “We version South African spike sequence works. It’s quite ready vaccinate people yet.

“It’s easy adapt technology, develop new vaccine go small amount clinical testing, nearly amount go last year.”

She added: “We’re already working first part manufacturing process Oxford.

“That passed members manufacturing supply chain, go spring, looks much likely new version ready use autumn.”



Professor Shabir Madhi, chief investigator trial South Africa University Witwatersrand, said new results prompt change strategy.

“These findings recalibrate thinking approach pandemic virus shift focus goal herd immunity transmission protection risk individuals [the] population severe disease,” said.

This follows publication different results last Tuesday indicating Oxford jab prevents two-thirds Covid transmissions original strain, 100 per cent hospitalisations, 22 days first jab.

Ministers recognise disease defeated single vaccine drive, rather kept bay delivery series tweaked jabs combat emerging variants.

Professor Gilbert said could done rapidly minimum amount clinical testing, making use protocols used flu vaccination programme, known strain change, sees new versions jab rolled autumn.

One million doses AZ jab arrived South Africa last week health workers.

""We shall hold it, temporary, know steps next,” said country’s health minister, Zweli Mkhize.

He said: “AstraZeneca promising results availability. vaccine 22 per cent effective new variant.”

The NHS vaccinated nearly 1,000 people minute hour Saturday, Mr Zahawi said, under-70s begin come forward receive jab.

Between 11am midday Saturday, NHS vaccinated 979 people minute, making “confident” everyone high-priority groups offered jab May.

Officially, Government committed offering first dose February 15 top four priority groups, comprising care home residents staff, people aged 80 frontline health social care staff, aged 75 over, people aged 70 along anyone clinically extremely vulnerable age 16.

However, Telegraph revealed last week people late 60s already received letters asking book appointment.

On Sunday author Sebastian Faulks, 67, became latest person sixties announce received jab, tweeting offered one local surgery “even though I’m wrong age group”.



In contrast earlier rollout, Downing Street content allow parts country moved priority groups quickly continue pace.

The seven-day rolling average first doses given UK 433,8571.

Based latest figures, average 373,214 first doses vaccine would needed day order meet Government's target 15 million first doses February 15. sure got downvoted. made similar comment earlier golden child JT got hammered. ndp bed liberals conservatives got balls. liberals getting hammered this. pace roughly 1.58 million shots per day

Fortunately last week broke 2 million shots day. We're going relatively normal summer. doubt mind. Things going better hoped, despite problems left previous government. also measureable immune response vaccine much higher getting covid. natural immunity lasts begin with. Yup. reason auto manufacturers like Ford ramping car manufacturing little. chips available vehicle modules can't make cars. Article worth reading another day 3.3% hospital census drop United States.  weeks away summer lull levels continues think depend reinfection rates people likely sick covid testing available still good enough immunity. already evolved 3 variants reinfect, that's absolutely selection pressure yet. Forget ""if can't get global variant tracking regume place"", it'll happen regardless. tracking regime allow us see happen, anything stop it.

And it'll spread like wildfire vaccines adapted billions people vaccinated again, thus causing waves lockdowns.

The Spanish Flu ""miraculously went away"" mutated undercover variant symptoms could spread easily. one care. already produce symptoms infectious care kills done infectious. get worse time, better.

This really new normal. Well ""the rich"" countries trained scientists, built instructo instructor, developed tested vaccine, producing it,and paying it. get first crack? developing nation developed cure, would demand share worldrather take care citizens first?  exiting O\_O  What's rates hospitalization death? Cute think editors Covid respects white privilege. specifically temperature checks, COVID tests. Deter anything essential travel wealthy travelling or, accurate, deter anyone wealthy. 

This charge effectively ban travel anyone cares human rights refuse comply. leave sub, know. one needs hear dramatic farewell. 2 million doses day administered that's utter failure previous government prepare, new government job 2 weeks, infrastructure problems we've dealing with.

Things going even better hoped. thing almost fall. brutal news matter try spin it. TL:DR AstraZeneca vaccine basically work new variant, past infections mitigate either. 

There's lot people felt pandemic would basically follow pre-ordained course year summer. wrinkle means 2021 got interesting... less two weeks surge cases Tampa send life savings what, whats AUS recession compared fucked way, way better.

This original point, seems like changing subject now.  Alright, ""junk science studies"" prove point. Please, feel free post studies back saying. Relevant line first link, ""school closures United States found reduce COVID-19 incidence mortality think best strategy assume vaccines protect hospitalisations deaths take additional protection (against symptoms spread) bonus. stop restrictions allow natural infections top immunity: become common cold enough cross-reactivity previous infections stop developing further. escapes less likely since we'll get exposed enough keep cross-reactivity drifts.

The alternatives see really trying go zero covid, think possible world, now. would result extremely harsh lockdowns long periods time. Well know one place measuring temperature accurate, inside body, mouth food sensitive comes stable temperature, need us end drainpipe... already surprised dont spread morning accurate temperature check... finger.... foot's big toe... giggidy... yeah comes point enough enough. im losing percentage points total lifetime percent chance dying covid thats say fuck it. literally start argument saying stop transmission vitamins Could stop transmission prophylactic means like testing contact tracing vitamins but, no. profitable. Though facebook gets paid contact tracing without even knowing info they're selling you, somehow government can't without breaking constitution.

Regardless, never able replace unmatched results vaccine supplements; look polio measles. Ok much testing area doing? wouldn’t say “tremendously.”

Appreciate links though. hated song certainly hate song happen now, fall vaccinated perfectly see something like happening many people MS. large swath world population long haul symptoms, huge spotlight issue. cordial quiet see anyone suggesting another zoom holiday year &amp; shaming people choices thanksgiving Christmas 2021. nothing debunk idea recorded cases won’t necessarily result increased death. seen happen PCR test part problem. test picking “cases” people infected past, people may consider “false positive” whatever want call it. point testing increased cases actual infections picked up, leading restrictions may necessary. Many “surging” number “cases” identified also among young. matter terminology use, lot positive PCRs necessarily mean deaths. know people 80, can’t get appointment mid-March. expanding first priority groups willing unable schedule. Tables turned. need 70% people vaccinated end pandemic, majority eventually become gay. Yeah, I’d guess lot people first two camps haven’t personally affected? Poor guy must've jabbed wrong place Yep. Ted Cruz said national television. NOPE! Covid. Don’t come round facts nuance bigot cold. see happening, getting people bulk shop help especially mow intial shock pandemic gone therefore nobody panic buying. don’t see why. Covid got better. don’t ever want jam packed next people ever again. think ptsd year honestly Johnson &amp; Johnson fairly effective SA variant lot storage cost advantages AZ. What's point getting vaccine then? ""No amount kicking, screaming demanding""

It change things, democracy. look Florida. 

I saying good idea right now, people vaccinated, cards. think many people probably lying.

However, might telling truth. Honestly, I'm vaccinated yes I'm still required keep wearing masks things.

But here's thing... I'm still terrified. week since I've gotten second shot. I'm still scared hang friends, go grocery shopping, still feel need wash hands every outing. need afraid anymore. But... year built habits year afraid catching virus, year caution, year news stories people getting sick. still follow things part fear left me.

That might another reason answers. NYC, ordering food, would need order placed 3pm next-day delivery. Might different many restaurants likely placing high volume large orders. We're open VA? county online schools lol Yeah don’t want safe. want free left alone make decisions. Wait it’s country’s coronavirus vaccination program begins Tuesday honestly yes need wake smell
The coffee. Much country back 2019 normal already pandemic socially there. fact you
Think life indefinitely actually, Gross. isn’t based anything doomerism.

I don’t believe say “nobody is” happy dystopian fantasy life forever. rather seems like secretly thrilled. sub created back 2013. one makes head explode. Gotta love people grown easiest, free time history exist literally begging government boot neck. people protest police say “fuck government”. say “fuck government” least I’m consistent covid restrictions. Lmao mfers can’t even read. anyone remember bunch celebrities got tik tok sang ""Imagine"" us start politicians getting assassinated due covid19 policies 1st world countries unfortunately, that's bad news us means society collapsing. Cansino also conducted phase 3 trials Mexico applied emergency use there.  radical Islamist nearly 210,000 followers social media platform, Jerusalem Post followers describe Father Islamic Medicine, last year viral video burning copy Harrison’s Manual Medicine – considered authority trusted brand medical content – arguing Islamic medicine made books ‘irrelevant’. specific sources, understanding brazil variant increase infectivity (r0 Rt) vs UK. anything may slightly lower. 

JG Best way practice safe sex. 
1. Don’t sex. Imagine outside party came investigate US vaccine studies.  work covid testing site regularly run tests, frustrating. I’m get 2nd Moderna shot think everyone location getting vaccinated That’s completing list consists either non peer reviewed pre prints, mathematical models, studies ecological validity (ie study design reflect things happen real world).

That Chu et al meta analysis gets mentioned, example, reveal evidence masks. fact, said evidence masks weak best isn’t based research public masking (the studies analyzed largely poor self report studies Asia). 

This list also conveniently leaves recent studies ecological validity, recent study Denmark (some people call “Danish mask study,” think appropriate term “Danish guideline adherence effects” study): recent study Marine recruits also showed effect guidelines: RCT healthcare workers, shows cloth masks specifically opposite effects: point I’m trying make this:

A lot scientific research like sitting quiet room absolutely sound. room, quietest noises startle you, do, write paper saying “noise startles!” 

Cool, hear noise lab, real world loud. noise would startle quiet room won’t even audible street. 

Furthermore, absolutely way person living daily life wear mask “correctly:” CDC rest honest, would claim this: think masks stop spread studies shown masks demonstrate filtration effects blow aerosols lab machine. 

In end, end this:

 http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1174 last lockdown January allowed travel certain radius outside city, retail malls open, gyms open (outdoor only), yet campgrounds closed!! Professional college sports could happen fans, youth sports couldn't. priority opening money making activities. Messed up. looks like got control though group D. Still caught COVID. Sucks man. numbers dashboard even much worse state reports officially. Yes, possibly. case pretty mild, got immune reaction 2 weeks symptoms, even though I'm asthmatic. Also, unfortunately went girlfriends' house pick she'd come stay lockdown, infected sister. here's interesting part: saw sister 3 whole days symptoms started. self isolating. regret wearing mask inside home, maybe gotten virus well. Gladly, severe cases. Yeah, went C B hovering freaking everyone seemed gotten amongst relatives. practically bathing COVID seem stick wtf started saying “physical distancing” loathe everything term “social distancing” infers I’m done perpetuating harmful inhuman act. Physical distancing still allows connections bonds generally insinuates less loneliness. I’m completely anti term “social distancing”.  Often requirement business request patrons use masks. businesses ask enforced (and believe has).

Note *a request* business refuse service person wear mask. (My experience ask refuse service.) one fined false idea gets upvoted.

No one knows congressman's specific treatment recommendations doctors.

The CDC says people underlying health conditions cancer prioritized get vaccinated. Im glad they’re well, people like break heart. know many people died virus nearly hospitalized myself. get frustration man, make unscathed get vaccine living selfishly tough me. I’m realizing read threads much toll taken me. Anyway, sorry stepping this. hope they’ll continue lucky—you too. true all. It’s required emergency approval vaccine. It’s nothing specific Pfizer clarified repeatedly. sure people want anti-Pfizer vaccine.

[coronavirus vaccine DELHI (Reuters) - vaccine maker, including Pfizer Inc sought emergency-use authorisation COVID-19 shot India, must conduct additional local study considered country’s immunisation programme, senior government official told Reuters. literally described state systems. idea Sputnik V big goof Putin's political ambitions Russian scientists corruptible Russia xenophobic. Well, also politician tries impose get voted office (it goes well) murdered (if go well) Spring break March, expect cases climb around time. went grocery store last week gloves littered far entrance. tired seeing people’s dirty masks gloves thrown everywhere. forget trash cans are? shortened form ""buckaroo"", cowboy. usually threatening, usually means ""watch where' going"" ""slow down"" I've I'm borderline suicidal, I'm even joking. health worse ever been, sustainable even limits. Well Carnival one future cruise ship, LNG, thats

Feel free continue research. people actually prepare annual lockdowns restrictions might work, surprising people lockdowns like happening UK Christmas bad idea. Preach brother 

(Or sister) long vaccines circulating enough make r0 1, fine even people get less effective vaccine. Hmm, asymptomatic transmission almost strategies wrong, point isolate symptomatic people, governments destroyed businesses people lives, hand, asymptomatic transmission well-known fact, everyone sure case Sars-Cov-2, experts would wrong, every almost every mathematical model wrong, asymptomatic people immunity, would mean far achieving herd immunity. Lets make personal shall we? understand happy direction life taken. Nobody is, thats life right now.

No amount kicking, screaming demanding change fact exist pandemic. public restrooms spreading environment? study issue?

What “scientific bodies” issued guidance wear masks outside? really them?

Was guidance based science cited? Yeah, bugs people outside thread seemingly one three camps:

1. I'm going jump bridge next Tuesday exactly like 2017. need lick doorknobs NOW!

2. Antimask/Antivax/antishutdown/grocery store screamers.

3. Masks social distancing [unreasonable.]

The categories pretty wide nets, people daily thread somewhere reasonable inbetween. gifted gun vaccine. guess we'll see made gay /s thank you! appreciate super interesting. wonder would help autoimmune disorders like COPD. think anyone masks. People fed told nothing going change everyone vaccinated explicitly told vaccines would return things normal. 

Since transmissions happen small gatherings home lockdowns destroyed businesses people now.  think people ok dealing first 6 months so. Reminds Rabbi said Covid sent God punish homosexuals, ended contracting Covid himself. Agreed. seriously bad. People crying can't go bar (which now). Summer pretty fcking normal well. feel bad restaurant workers. shit gig anyways dependant dine service. financial help federal government. handled properly beginning Trump administration businesses affected would helped financially could survive without indoor service. Help business need shut contain virus go away faster ffs. Whitmer great job. Florida better reputation regarding Covid data transparency New York per covidtrackingproject.org unbiased source gets may actually lean left. absolutely reason lie Florida covid data tracking reporting. I’m getting tired hearing they’re “cooking books” NY almost certainly less transparent Florida point. been, easy given insanely widespread conspiracy theories days. read months ago. Basically chromosome lacks nuanced disease fighting capabilities nutshell. Covid hits men harder recover it’s permanent. Woman fight bit differently. It’s better long term survival comes cost, longer symptoms. could mark here, please expert correct oddly enough, high level clerics already gotten vaccine FYI I’m convinced “cow toe” new proper use term. Exactly. backed even messaging disaster corner ever openly explaining issue PCR tests (that can’t tell virus alive/infectious not). latter one NEVER understood, would’ve easy, didn’t even admit “wrongdoing”. *wasn’t* wrong time—when bunch SICK people presenting flu symptoms testing NEGATIVE flu, extraordinarily helpful test could tell sick with. went rails widespread asymptomatic testing general population, created much basically useless (or even harmful) statistical “noise.” Whenever read shit like joke they're using opening come closet Celebrating people’s death here. 

Making purely political comments - even worked essential worker months. respect opinion - suffered didn’t really care. too. ""When safe"" makes want scream since vague description vary drastically person person. Good summary current situation left Columbus, OH strain / variant (different articles keep using different terms). sure 2. Surely treat people better, still capacity system - good make therapies, enough space use them. therapies shorten hospital stay reduce severity thus requirements intensive care, increases capacity, still. Nothing misinformation.

Yes correct claims Oxford scientists taking data well founded. Group B since day one, gathering go outdoors came contact maybe 4 ppl outdoors (separate occasions) covid contracted yet. yeah would get tested encounter. 

I also know anyone contracted covid outdoor event. I'm usually playing volleyball, basketball, hiking hanging beach park.

Outdoor transmission seems suck ass, good. “Mask up”

“Shots arms” 

“Here’s we’re safety” (the things every business doing) 

“Surge/skyrocket”  Dont know got downvoted. many states still mask mandates Well, everyone working home without possibility distractions akin slavery. That’s interesting. assumed sub shows many ppl died would pro-mask. get frustration, don’t think frustration justifies abandoning things seem help? guess feel loop. Regardless exact holiday, would think would see massive spikes mid January, complete downward trend, right?

Now 5 weeks NYE cases halved. guy street thinks CIA talking dental fillings. sure deserves news article either.  I'm phone work. can't studies guidance format.

Nut guidance every scientific body stay distanced wear mask, even outside. Yoy seriously tryi g deny that, right?

And btw, people.keep ignoring things like public restrooms spreading environment? Anti-vax makes homophobic. True lol Tbh majority people care symptons consistute mild disease. long health services going overwhelmed restriction-free(ish) lifestyle, we'll prepared handle bit illness long SA variant become dominant and/or mutate further). course people unlucky unfortunately, can't keep locking every time someone dies.

I hope works us (even non-Brits seem criticising us exist, I've left sub biased toxic). Understood. lucky I’ve fared really well lockdown year, understand others it’s hard. There’s multitude reasons locking people home isn’t good strategy really need focus squashing whole. That's funny Thanks making assumptioms neo-liberal simp. see difference Biden neo-cons running office last 4 years. 

Mistook one frothing mouth q chuds whos panties get moist sound sort domestic war libs. Thanks making assumptioms neo-liberal simp. see difference Biden neo-cons running office last 4 years. 

Mistook one frothing mouth q chuds whos panties get moist sound sort domestic war libs. talking long-term effects since March-April 2020... still dumbfounds many people still focus death rates. new variations UK South Africa though indicate spike might seen Mid March. vaccines like half effective apparently one them. Hope get soon also forget many people also antibodies harder virus spread. sad answer one definitely rooted reality given terrible way many Americans taken (or taken) precautions virus. Restrictions fine. understand need lockdowns clearly work variety reasons USA. supported first round lockdowns support unless hospital space dire. I'll definitely walk try give Astrazeneca J&amp;J. point getting inferior vaccine better alternatives available. test frogs? 14 got mild symptoms. would interesting know 14 many though. Literally every player ref tested negative numerous times event. Covid present field, what’s need social distance??? technically indoors wide open doors, kind like eating garage garage door open. great bad sounds. lovely day too. 100% restrictions need communicated better leadership, iron clad strategy re-opening, relief/aid provided effected economically, mentally, and/or physically. Huh? No, dude, pointing article linked really bring variants 3 months ago. There's evidence ""man flu"" stereotype actual physical difference result differing response chains innate immune system. Men heavier cytokine response chain - involves feeling like crap, may also account portion higher fatality rates men COVID disease. think we'd first need define ""lockdown"" is.

I support something like European-style lockdown we've got curfews, people can't leave houses except essential business, etc.

Masking requirements fine capacity limits indoor restaurants, retail establishment, large gathering venues. Said restrictions tied hospitalization numbers (as well vaccination numbers point). I'd like see schools fully reopened soon possible, ie: teachers vaccinated given opportunity vaccinated opt out. something last month, thus failing two month claim testing swimming skills? It’s honestly scary attitude changed here, lurked awhile see straight anti-maskers deniers flooding threads. Asteroids still hit Earth. happened before. safe children? Experts concerned.  cause takes 3-4 weeks get second dose 2 weeks full efficacy. take 1.5 months first dose see full effects vaccine. Israel something like 50-60 percent first doses still haven’t seen dramatic drop overall take like month two people received second dose reached full efficacy vaccine. That’s look Israel’s overall data don’t see much change look granular level groups gotten doses see big improvements. delay first vaccination 95 percent efficacy month two see delay vaccination real world impact. That’s people say reopen everything may masks crazy they’re taking account. Like even everyone access vaccine may won’t immunized June July Give credit credit due: trump’s govt better job vaccination contracts western govt world. Yeah, celebrating dropping 3k deaths 7 day average like conquered disease silly. still way worse last April everyone first freaked locked hard. need drop 500 7 day average justify current reaction. cares cruise ships China producing 50% worlds pollution. bigger things worry about. tiny drop ocean pollution. amazing thanks much! okay? Like seriously. 

At point make claims say did. 

I’m going stop responding there’s clearly something off. 

You nice day now. women haul long men want to. According Brazilian corionavirus tracker, infections deaths Manaus starting go tracker weird let link individual cities' results (AFAIK), search ""municipio"". Every time showed crowd people masks pulled down. say masks haven’t done shit Bay Area numbers practically lowest whole state? feel grateful live gave fuck. sees election campaigning coming needs look nice. Maybe read commenting. crux argument hoarding vaccines citizens instead international distribution based upon relative need, they're leaving poor countries dry allow mutations spring up. Utah, governor away mandatory quarantines due exposure long parties wearing masks. 

You may think dumb, hundreds kids missing hundreds days school less 1% ever ended testing positive Covid. simply wasn’t spread school. daughter’s high school 1500 students, two positive cases right 25 kids quarantined, mainly due Covid positive parent. many Palestinians vaccinated? Oh, question makes sense :)

CDC currently recommending people who’ve still get vaccinated. 

I don’t see guidance delaying second dose, I’d imagine wouldn’t make sense get vaccinated you’re still sick. also say this, delay weeks month extra would still get second shot close recommended 3-week 1-month interval possible. **However, maximum interval first second doses either vaccine. **You get second dose earlier recommended interval. got second dose january every nation still need doctors watch immediate allergic reactions. takes 20 minutes per patient. legal requirement parts US too, nobody ever enforces it. Yes; you’re right. wasn’t 3rd world, switched descriptors. Thanks catch.  man reasoning pretty soon going ""just case, we'll stay lockdown another 4 months"" basically going lockdown rest lives since never vaccine developed 100% protection? Dodger Stadium vaccination site weeks now. use parking lot vaccines administered person car. They've administered tens thousands vaccines far.   doesn't? 


Masks done ceremonially fuck Europe South America. work offers flu vaccine figured I’d get it. Holy shit arm feel like shot 2-3 days. regrets. Honestly, expect much impact. spike Lightning's boat parade expected super spreader event. Cases literally declined Tusacloosa celebrated Alabama's win CFB Championship. article state anyone got severe case? Columbus mass vaccination site Ohio state’s basketball arena. imagine transition football stadium weather conducive outdoors. imagine Oregon Eugene Corvallis.

Major college stadiums bigger NFL stadiums anyway. It’s almost certain spike next fall/winter, question big is. Netherlands legal obligation wear mask public Inside locations since December. You’ll get fine don’t comply. seen maskless person supermarket since December. That's sexist. Men Women equal. saying something 'more american thing'...  can’t wait winning team go White House helmet overflowing signatures Good thing android vs ios like spaghetti vs fettuccine. would fight stay hospital dying right now. visitation rules eventually viewed crime humanity. things happen take seriously. think mean second dose Sure, both, it’s imperative now, phase we’re vaccinating elderly, create system east elderly get vaccinated.

Good lord go see parents they're vaccinated. insane. supposed wait for?! article specifically states women question 2 weeks post second dose yet people article still saying people need careful due varriances vaccine 100%. feel like everyone knew would happen, crazy seeing play real life officials going try keep restrictions place even vaccinations mean, vaccinating whole country variant known render vaccine ineffective still around... clusterfuck yeah see that. little change, big difference. Maybe tested younger cohort it’s unclear impact severe cases. simply voting party lines turned great CA

Should treat terminal cancer patients they're going die anyway? mean average time diagnosis death pretty short, waste resources them?

I'm getting feeling lot elderly people life. expect small spike can't explained normal weekly variation 1.5-2 weeks. Nothing huge, obviously abnormally large crowds bars parties houses across country, virus gonna field day.

There's grossly large portion sub would rather bite tongues admit infection rate affected human behavior, large crowds close gatherings create big spikes predictably. posting ""so much Holiday spike, huh?"" week New Years next week 4000 bodies zipped per fucking day average 4 fucking weeks. absolute massacre metric.

I understand desperation get back normal, gotta succumb reality, big gatherings still problem continue vaccinate vast majority *vulnerable* population. going current rate, that's gonna take couple months. mother fuckers wanna back normal NOW, TODAY, vote anything claims differently. Well all? Children get antsy end car ride guess, least reasonable.  wasnt sarcastic time genuinely applauding you

Its incredible many doctors just...cant use logic reason Two options

1. Assume efficacy data support assumption

2. Assume efficacy data present.

You seem taking first option, correct? article posted November 
Vaccines work.

Followed closely Could point scientific source shows:

-Outdoor Dining gathering small groups outdoors park beach significant source transmission

and

-A policy ban outdoor gatherings, police identify punish participants, lead people wanting socialize private homes, worry police enforcement much risky outdoor transmission?

What I've seen far California similar COVID trajectory Florida, lockdown: feel way, seen grandparents year now, social life dumps. way vaccination program going, can't see us continuing lifestyle social distancing masks summer (in US UK). Medical doctors usually forefront science. 

I understand deep need sarcastically dismissive, would make look lot less stupid even basic understanding talking about. 

Maybe trade time spend dick Reddit reading. Perhaps study two covid long haulers auto antibodies would good place start. There’s 99.9% chance flight arrive destination safely. take chance? 80% never attend concert.

I mean... what? barely dropped 3k deaths per day 7 day average, things still extremely bad, far soon celebrate much seem doing. bet many thousands dead next fall/winter matter do, especially many anti vaxxers preventing herd immunity. It’s going ugly while, need care long longer seem think. Virus running people infect yet. free vaccine cost $20 parking still walk mile stadium. That’s I’m leaning towards. Better safe sorry! wouldn’t even give second thought, friends people see preschooler playdates kid. It’s bummer isolate couple weeks also need make sure parents safe. Wuhan local government tried hide outbreak. Beijing took army locked Wuhan Jan 23rd. know severity lockdown. one right mind would claim China played virus Beijing took Wuhan. articles expats wished stayed China, plenty video evidence Chinese people living post pandemic normal life.

Look actually care, least shut stop spreading false narratives. Same! Starting spring (May) I’m going start hanging friends going more. area still bad we’ll wear masks I’m 20s, healthy can’t take another year lost lockdowns. internet now, everything line, even, nay, *especially* doesn’t make sense! schools corona gets wiped planet earth then. Tests per confirmed case getting better. It’s still bad kind expected actual cases dropping.  Where’s data? I’ve seen data SUGGESTING it’s less efficacious. general still enough prevent serious illness death. many times needs good news gets buried realize vaccine change protein produced cell infected virus?

this false? admit want COVID win? Yes, Argentina produce AstraZeneca, think CanSino vaccine soon produced here. Sure causing cases go though implying new variant entirely evades immune response, could ignite third wave. 

The U.K. variant respond previously affective [Monoclonal mutates vaccines work appears happening. 100 people dying Florida every single day. isn’t normal means. Instead fact checking accuse others spreading fake news?

I want post article „Der Spiegel“ behind Australian border guard: ""Cool story bro. DENIED. Next!"" Sample size ~2000. that, sequenced 42 cases, 39/42 SA variant (which shows dominant is).

Also, other, arguably sophisticated vaccines J&amp;J vaccine already shown, much larger trials, poor efficacy SA variant, expected AZ results would even poorer. one time seriously engaged Q person debate, brought USA Today opinion piece 6%. immediately found debunked, change mind (almost needless say). funniest/scariest part conversation started yelling, ""You're emotional!"" getting ready fight. 

I also mentioned excess deaths studies. told family members perished Holocaust, knew thing two excess deaths. asked thought holocaust going world right now; said yes. 

And yet, want somebody else deciding information privy information hide. That's slippery slope.

Thank god, thought one left areas doesn’t feel anything sped up.  seeing 2M? Bloomberg shows 1.5 million today.  Well, would final determiner right vote?

What final determiner ends group assholes anyway? think politicians decided ban everything forever instead actual plans get crisis. convenient, things get worse, add bans! produce vaccines fund medicines/cures? Yes, stick making lame insults people call bullshit. That's suited capabilities. That’s pretty much everywhere. lot countries, age death greater median age death. externalities associated response affects everyone. places US haven’t done anything. Lol. taking credit curve happened everywhere. ever heard phrase “nine women can’t make baby month” ? already evolved 3 variants reinfect, that's absolutely selection pressure yet.

You're fear-mongering without evidence. may make feel better, evidence driven. found comments boosters updating vaccines particularly ... also may able develop timely fashion, maybe four six months, consensus strain bakes lot different variation we're seeing boosters available fall Scaring people don’t ever get back normal again

Who benefit? wealthy make money owning things, producing things. It’s “subjective” fucking idiot Um, actually they’re still studying transmission. vaccine may protect severe disease without protecting infection contagion. theory OP could put family risk.

I’d hold either family vaccinated, studies come showing reduction transmission. completely ineffective. It’s 22% effective, means prevention severe disease, hospitalization, death higher that. enough useful SA becomes dominant strain might Culturally tight? Isn’t sort racist? Facebook jack shit. I've reported fake news / antivax posts many times, remain nothing happens. fun allowed ever even precautions least quarter stadium vaccinated. Yes, proof vaccination sort authentication biometric completely subjective bullcrap actual evidence. ""your body going used enough"", ""not going evolve much that"" expect scientific enthusiast. Unless cite peer-reviewed publications quantify statements degree coronavirus, please bullshit internet.  needs come back food. Best park skiing going lodge drink afterwards. Sorry honest. timing shots fair point. interesting see deal that. I’m sure Unions signed plan (I assume no), don’t know school push get agreement. Yeah, seen claims ""permanent lung damage"" asymptomatic cases can't help super skeptical Firstly, 62% totally useless, higher flu vaccines. looks poor considering mRNA 95%. Secondly, know doses yet, 90% effective dosage correct.

Source: guys actually wiping groceries? It’s designed updated. Booster shots adenoviral vaccines would theoretically get less effective since body develops immortal adenovirus itself. vector would trigger immune response neutralized anything useful accomplished. Yeah troubling sure, I'm denying Ehh, I'm able access another, effective vaccine within reasonable timeframe I'll wait. months, however, probably would get shot. would imagine shot truly extremely ineffective, governments allow people get revaccinated another vaccine. don’t really much conclusive data large numbers say that. Even AZ’s poor results small test. like anybody control group 100,000 SA variant. 

I think like Pfizer/Moderna perform better AZ data severely lacking far. go Buffalo try give vaccine 4 times miss attempt. Perhaps will, see CA voting one. Chinese media. old person going navigate giant stadium? many random people going bother going stadium? 

This done private sector utilizing system use quickly efficiently give flu shots year. disagreeing AstraZeneca. work SA strain.

Nothing article shared says Pfizer Moderna hit 50 percent. says less efficacy, we've already agreed on. say dropped 50 percent.

A news article valid source preprint. read preprint, judge science instead throwing door. Also, guess claim Pfizer Moderna NYT article based of? preprint shared.

Be honest. preprint gets peer reviewed, going change feel it? Moderna developing booster. implies expect needed. Needing booster two dose tough logistically handle vaccine huge deal breaker developing world. issue lack demand I'm also fine that. everyone wants vaccine one there's reason keep lockdowns going anymore. mentioned something similar (although happen men too) last week “mysterious illnesses” dismissive downplaying severity long-haul symptoms met “BuT hApPeNs 0.5% PeOpLe!” 

Andddd downvoted oblivion. feel like users sub pendulum right now. Moves back forth intellectual conversation dismissive, misinformation different weeks. *sigh* 

Thanks speaking  think reopen now, agree needs become ""immediate future"" conversation. instance I'd enjoy state's governor, Charlie Baker, announcing metric we'd need see happen restrictions lifted. could getting number hospitalizations, many people vaccinated, getting number deaths, many new cases.

I'd like something. finish line. would make much easy, mentally. I'd like lot governors that. point, AstraZeneca license one vaccines? 3-4000 people dying day. That’s big public health crisis matter want spin it.

That's probably one place I'll keep wearing them. Covid, way getting gas fingers... Hmm... Always great hear country's (not South Africa) option vaccine next months proving useless.

Ah well... fingers crossed get lot South African visitors people exposed South African variant. good thing count on, least SA pretty far away us.

Hopefully might get different option. doubt next year though things going here. want eyes, skin AFAIK. used disinfect rooms nobody's inside. weekly average new cases dropping 4500 every day since January 8. somehow sustainable we'd new cases March. Obviously that's going happen hope illustrates dramatic case drop been.

I'll definitely interested see drop levels off. Ideally I'd like see average number new cases 20,000 March. customers get angry masks smash things, maybe? much immunity someone get one dosage vs two?

After first dosage drasri less likely spread virus around? user name extremely relevent. It’s ridiculous. It’s like construction companies saying it’s okay ban harnesses falling building isn’t virtually certain kill you. point Publix decided potential profits important potential losses lawsuits trying best worlds. probably counted fact employees families wouldn’t able afford litigation fees. influenza role annual vaccines play driving escape mutants following flu season:

These poor citations. first study show driving escape mutant. challenge mutant arose culture. similar situation would occur mutant arises animal reservoir wherein limited protective immunity.

Your second citation development vaccines address antiviral resistance induced replication errors genomic reassortment. Limiting replication influenza viruses limits potential resistant mutants. 

I'm assuming third citation Rafi Ahmed (my former colleague) paper BMPCs seeing linked TOC. paper address anything saying. states BMPCs remain year. one sample memory B cells specific influenza. Mutant escape addressed anywhere paper.  

If wanted actual citation, would However, explain influenza cannot eradicated level clades sub-clades whereas entire subtypes influenza longer exist humans (and longer exist face regards emergence zoonotic viruses (animal reservoirs):

Again, two poor citations. first citation address influenza bats known reservoir human influenza.

As second quoted, influenza binds sialic acid glycoproteins, shared among species. difference linkage. Pigs alpha(2,3) alpha(2,6) sialic acid humans alpha(2,6) minor population alpha(2,3). Birds alpha(2,3). Pigs infected avian influenzas, drift leads alpha(2,6) infects humans. Receptors known. immune invasion needed. **All subtypes influenza today came species.** influenza never ""eradicated"" unless could somehow achieve herd immunity pigs birds animals serve reservoirs. Mutations viral pathogens reservoir hosts could lead things like swine flu bird flu suggested.

It's question ""can"" ""could."" fact do. would argue selection pressure virus jumps species would specific species (reservoir host). Viral evolution within population reservoir hosts selective pressure hosts immune systems. definitely increase propensity jump species, also decrease propensity well.

Given swine humans share receptor, swine influenzas readily infect humans. Additionally, given humans minor population alpha(2,3) linked sialic acids, bird influenzas infect humans well. Still, Pfizer shown prioritize USA (which vaccine export ban) highest bidders (like Israel), good EU got BioNTech deals European big pharma like Sanofi - time exclusive deals jeopardize immunization pandemic.

I think rip benefits distante future. Thank god. Getting second moderna shot tomorrow. NFL stadiums hold 60-70k people including parking. Theoretically could vaccinate many people one day they're currently nationwide 30 stadiums long supply staff. Logistically delivering vaccines smaller amount locations efficient stadiums going sit empty 6 months anyway.

We absolutely focus mass vaccination first knock comfortable way. Focusing mean local pharmacies forgotten either. cater comfort second priority. different viruses, no? Give 2 weeks. saw videos Florida massive Super Bowl parties. NC would call “open”. Still lots restrictions place. NY started expanding vaccination criteria people health conditions, seems like states still stuck phase 1a. got back skiing mountains parents+fiancé. 

I know venn diagram “people ski” “people accept risk life” basically circle, mountain normal felt months. Everyone happy nice other, besides things (high mask enforcement, spaced lines, one household per chair, indoor food, low capacity mountain) basically same. little better actually since mountain less people lol. 

But nice reminder internet, people ready done. aren’t totally “done” yet theyre still courteous (at least mountains California). willing jump hoops normalcy. 

Normal happen again. Might slower parts, happen. might people internet going stay inside “forever” plenty everyday people won’t. majority. Pfizer Moderna approved, Pfizer rolled out. think it'll totally back square one, delay dominant UK couple months get Pfizer Moderna vaccines many people possible hopeuflly curb spread. Good shit. worried they'll keep mask mandates way longer necessary. zero real-life evidence contrary.

There one. two waves Europe far. first one, far one biggest amount people infected. Still, way less people dying first one. multiple reasons is, point one thing. lot prepared first wave. many countries screen/test people enter countries. would also report infected Chinese citizens.  sure justifying ending “lockdown” 6,000 new cases per day. Nice try robot. Back Q1 2020 video health care workers China saying government lying state run media tried portray world pandemic situation well control. video evidence leaked morgues hospitals directly contradicted official claims made Chinese government.

I really know trying deny China lied severity pandemic early on. Also--and yes, may exceptions--you typically bring Grandma, Grandpa, Great Aunt Gladys Super Bowl parties. I'm sure overall younger demographic. Oh no, that's one Australia betting house on...

Cause can't manufacture mRNA locally

FUCK CSL lab incompetent bureaucratic ass even attempting upgrade equipment handle mRNA even news worrying looking study really want data. could better headline suggests (Small study size means there're massive error bars uses non-recommended dosage regime gives less protection should), could worse (Small study size means there's data severe illness young group means really know elderly). really want concrete picture. agree. think months we’ll look back realize dumb media hype almost certainly like 10+ variants already circulating (being global hotspot 8 months all) missed crap sequencing Yeah, need chill commenting biggest news day. dude following comments like insane person.

Get fucking grip. saving fucking UK commenting Reddit. Death, obviously.   UK ordered 40m Pfizer, like 7m Moderna. think total 300m-ish hold. won’t arrive later year. 

God hope Pfizer’s right cutting production time. 10% one shot. I'm sure probably contributing little doubt driving factor.  talking multiple variants common cold. People get one cold throughout life. wasn’t talking you. replying guy said governments focused eradication. Thanks. agree long-haul. know question difficult answer given what's currently known difficulty gathering information necessary, point asking ""preventing death,"" good, leaves door open many possible outcomes may nearly bad. 


We take comfort knowledge there's another, shelf-stable tool available fight this, that's worth something. Conversations reopening absolutely need going on, I'm hoping are. think reopening right good idea, beginning open next couple months reality. So, metrics place plans according metrics. Haha ""the UK country legitimately finished""... take day seriously 49.2% Americans age 6 months older get flu vaccine.

When account fact nobody 18 able get COVID vaccines (at least near term), probably equals number people get COVID vaccine (if 60% eligible get it). Isolate 10 days.

Presumably you’d know symptoms. mix optimism pessimism here. want things open widely vaccinations deaths fall cliff (hopefully late March/early April) think we'll see full scale national reopening around Memorial Day. Unless things go horribly wrong vaccine, think 4th July last acceptable goal post, even states like California. know pro virus, actually makes sick many likes posts get sub Fat chance. Maybe weeks. it’s “safe” stop wearing masks start grouping again, people stop. accurately described NC current status well. Herein lies problem. exit strategy even discussion going restrictions rolled back. Citizens need push restrictions (including masks) removed. Ah see, thanks response. trying correct either anything. pretty sure understand! don’t care saving lives. It’s solely feeling superior. 7 day average well half 4 weeks ago Mate, went comments. going U.K. comments American politics even comments Oxford vaccine, vaccine company. 

There’s need linking Oxford vaccine British nation. It’s vaccine. one cares comes from. don’t care Pfizer vaccine German technology. want vaccine works. Pfizer vaccine efficacy rate 90%. 

That's second link provided haha.  know teacher want teach person safe goes bars reg. Astounding. Tldr 'did research ' think Moderna said they're developing booster SA varient. probably would want boosters possible get efficacy back higher percentage. done since April, go get food literally every day, go grocery shopping times week, frequently order items online.

I've tested 11 times. negative. much time original one needed spread China Italy rest world. Exponential growth helluva thing. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* personal idea would rough level flu hospitalizations deaths. formal benchmark. think believe science necessarily. believe *want*, what's realistic, nothing else convince otherwise. may true, however vaccine two doses need spaced two weeks, another two weeks second dose effective. Even got vaccines today, would another month would work. 

They aren’t getting vaccine today. next week, maybe next three weeks. 

At point it’s worth shift gears change learning style that’s going entire year couple weeks person learning. Hybrid learning actually far worse, clearly shows 70% people don’t even want kids back class yet. 

Let’s stop trying push something half cocked, focus getting everyone vaccinated. reopen schools fall- without restrictions. Lockdowns work unless government willing pay people stay home cancel rent/mortgages duration. really simple. Oh ok, explains lot. really ever super active sub, I'm subbed see relevant news comes up. Perhaps time unsubscribe, time people working tizzy liberal boogie man. I'd guess 25% covid plus 10% vaccine (with overlap). That's enough start dent cases starting point 270k odd cases day New Hampshire, save click. get vaccine Falcons’ stadium, it’ll work awhile rapidly fail allow infection cases SA variant located isolated focussing resources testing + tracing minimise ability transmit aforementioned isolation. Lidl yet? It’s less trashy Aldi. becoming quite clear interested discussing science me. Nearly everyone wants things. Despite reddit says, people want live like longer.

Stay positive. Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J great track record preventing hospitalizations deaths COVID variants. Astra Zeneca might less effective, jury still there, many many vaccines coming next months. Yeah, really looking forward see plays us. mean liked Goff got him, like liked Gurley. something happened Superbowl lost luster. Stafford interesting watch, think may need to, least, get close get another Superbowl. point 3 days?

The rest article makes clear. 3 days allow test confirm covid19. test positive quarantine test upon arrival wait results — up three days — in designated hotel. Passengers test negative leave finish the rest 14-day quarantine home. similar Bradley effect except COVID instead elections. said almost. majority Biontech vaccine goes healthcare professionals majority AZ elderly. understanding well, I'm curious determined 10 days. measuring antibodies day vaccination phase 3 trial data, covid positive individuals reported showing symptoms? latter, understanding average incubation period virus \~5 days symptoms, mean antibodies appearing much sooner 10 days, protection starts days vaccination? walk one real slow you.

What sort people currently travelling UK U.S? Go ahead. January 2022! Set reminder click bait, bad works better night . authors confident results ... maybe point betting them? cash lying around would risk-free way double it, willing play around. nothing even close happening, zero chance. Sigh. Again, I'm comparing America. I'm saying mingle all. I'm saying mingle Latinos blacks whites America. cultural barrier here. feel like, along ""Bradley effect"" mentioned elsewhere thread, part think tour bus effect. took tour bus trip Florida Ohio teenager, bus pretty much 20 hours nonstop. end it, like remember time bus. life bus. I'm exaggerating, obviously, end full day confined inside tiny environment, kinda warp worldview bit.

I feel like right now, people saying keep masking forever, mentally bus. forgotten like live prior covid, therefore they're extrapolating forward, imagine covid life, that's they've adapted to.

""I can't imagine wearing mask public anymore."" Right, year staying house visiting anyone, mind normalized stuff point. world starts opening community spread drops low number, lot people going drop masks, going stop seeming normal. point, I'd anticipate continue mask sick, that's it.

(And yes, know applies people actually taking pandemic seriously many people never masked give shit social distancing, that's I'm talking about.) CO2 per passenger-mile, personal cars 0.44-0.54kg/mi.

Your units match.  Super bowl parties tend smaller gatherings people travel cross country like Thanksgiving. bump cases, going like Thanksgiving/Christmas.

Appreciate also mean understand situation. trying smart arse anything, really understand quick question.

Regarding 72% efficacy meaning 28% people given vaccine get mild moderate symptoms. right?

My impression % figures comparison. say control group 10 people vaccinated group 10 people. 2 control group get symptoms 1 vaccinated group get symptoms. 50% efficacy?

But read efficacy rate could assume 50%, 5, vaccinated group got symptoms, would massive exaggeration.

Am right? stupid? :) post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* One problem discussion whole least US, we've equated literally restrictions whatsoever ""lockdown."" agree. Even numbers inverted, still believe even 28% population continue wear masks over. 70% bit much. 70% US population around 230 million. reality they've received around 60 million vaccines, around 20%. There’s evidence vaccines stop spread virus yet. based two symptoms. cough sore throat would moderate case J&amp;J's trial.

You're talking definition confirmed COVID-19 case moderate case specifically?

In either case, JnJ opted release efficacy preventing symptoms, rather efficacy preventing moderate severe cases. Why, know, safe *assume* efficacy preventing symptoms would lower 72 % downward trajectory cases continues rate negligible number daily new cases April. Agreed Honestly majority population becomes agoraphobic, that's fine me. means go out, I'll see friendly people since toxic virtue signallers home. far events caused spikes.

There's absolutely evidence this. fine taking less effective vaccines younger low risk. means constantly get sick different variants quarantine trying live youth again, start leaning towards highly effective vaccines. Young people longer social distance vaccine, hopefully deciding give J&amp;J Astro-Zeneca younger populations doesn’t cause spread different variants. keep getting downvoted right? People thought going like SARS worst lockdowns, mask mandates border closures commonplace used all, except without human-to-human transmission would made us take less seriously. exception may Koreans possibly due history MERS MERS require lockdowns.

If China actually transparent beginning let jobs, people would willing trust government, expect distrust. say I'm fan bunker fuel, something else would probably burning producing emissions ships (and ~300 cruise ships). things target regulation, class also dump sewage directly ocean.

I've taken behind-the-scenes tours cruise ships I've on, (mainly newer ones) bring lowest decks emphasize equipment use avoid dumping anything dangerous. Yeah think understand good work well. Novovax VLP platform easy manufacture store. already used HPV vaccine got multiple variants one shot. one best efficacy outcomes original strain. Last checked india ordered one billion doses.

I think everyone move mRNAs expensive go Novovax. 

There's sense sticking AZ know things work. However, like impossible, summer. enough vaccinate society likely resume again. Okay, many vaccinations people recovered COVID already? live Tampa. much super bowl parties throw number progress? husband essential employee almost everyone works party. mention street alone counted five parties.

Wow, that's crazy. live Colorado, generally seems like opposite, maybe I'm getting biased perspective there's lot ""don't give shit"" people thought - interact them. feel like dumb narrative push. actually don’t think there’s significant percentage people trying perpetuate public health measures indefinitely lol guess.

I know 28 year old woman passed away random embolism. one idea, otherwise perfectly healthy.

It may tempting try ""connect dots"" try pin COVID, without actual evidence, type speculation avoided. flies face science. says risk serious illness Last heard, astrazeanca vaccine 22% effectiveness reducing mild moderate cases. yeah it’s great, better 10%. said Wednesday single dose vaccine protect virus **over** three months reduce spread two thirds.

Byzantine rules setting tiers eligible mean holding collective breath months road, another set moves gingerly toward restoration lives side divide. know KS, schools still hybrid/remote, white collar jobs still telecommuting, still can’t go concert similarly crowded space, I’m still expected wear mask public settings.

Fair point, jury still that. Definitely bad idea physically distance wear mask then. 

I’d say, mask vaccine like wearing condom using pill—- odds bringing covid home extremely low Getting yearly flu shots norm decades. Viruses mutate time, know this. We’re headed towards normalish summer whether certain group people like not. Actually, know two. We've monitoring people phase 2 trials. 9 months. So, least long. need normality back summer lockdowns can’t much longer  Prevent every death totally doable since means limit spread vaccinate public. Deaths still 3,000 day even hundreds deaths day summer predictions correct isn’t “normal”. mean, reopen want. vaxed partaking. Well, kind of. received 79,000 doses last week, top another 180,000 Moderna. There's supposed another 70,000 Pfizer week, roughly 730,000 15th month's end. planned 249,000 doses Moderna also scheduled arrive final week month likely reduced around amount last delivery, assume another 180,000ish.

*If* goes intended, that's another 1.3 million doses next twenty days. end looking least close this, fear we'll reach point public confidence simply collapses. People already edge. Ironically previous lockdown September, almost immediate effect cases dropped steadily.

I actually suspect thought lockdown would work equally well they'd able open back cases huge vaccinated population. didn't, whatever reason... possibly people less compliant lockdown know people getting vaccinated. I'm seriously considering one Dec. It'll cold way get away that. Plus, book next nothing right now. one I'm looking requires non-refundable $100 deposit. pay rest Sept. everything booked organized get like 7 mos wait see pandemic ends pull plug, $100. loads vaccines already way effective SA variant.

Many interact all, despite attempts engage games activities, several barely work despite pleas try, come office hours, many emails calls parents. started therapy depression anxiety. consistently bare minimum, besides ones parents affluent enough sit next help day. plenty data online learning pandemic none good. 

You definitely sound like armchair “expert”. surprising Reddit. Perhaps bit experience education, likely older grades. teach younger students. I’m sick tired adults including middle school/ high school teachers talking students need suck deal it, never personally young kids expected do. never done elementary school teachers expected do. treating little kids terribly ignoring needs months, essentially. year places! kindergarteners expected Zpom hours don’t interact kids outside screen- it’s ridiculous I’d argue borderline abusive. 

You love bringing low income students say already behind- that’s true. wooo boy, can’t wait see they’re going this. care? mental health issues, drug/alcohol abuse child abuse increasing, going see increased crime future, mark words. 

I don’t give shit think it’s hyperbole. doubt see repercussions choices students many years line. we’re talking 500,000 EXCESS deaths, ones could’ve avoided. able get second dose? ""vaccines reduce transmission"" line

That’s I’m saying. I’m saying don’t know yet. worry that. Many students live single parent household others live older relatives. want note Worldometer's count, today first day since November (and early November that) US recorded less 100,000 new infections. Lol make america great brigade incoming Meh, surprising. don’t know people bother getting fired kinds headlines anymore. It’s year I’m done caring people there’s point. Regardless, people going whatever want. Looks like accurate username. country from? Exactly. live Australia lock everybody complies. 1 new case day everybody went back wearing masks social distancing. look america seems like half country dosent believe it’s anything worry about.. Father-in-law fighting cancer since Covid treatments Covid. Still alive. Follows guidelines. Hell no. One thing pandemic shown alone - together. lockdowns restrictions *cause harm*. People leaving good vaccines shelves tiny incrementally better vaccine months road *will cause harm* countless others delaying return normal. true vaccines likely widely available may June. takes month first dose immunity. wouldn’t expect real immunity till late June July. don’t think lift mask mandates hit point. Service workers shouldn’t exposed regularly able fully immunized. That's right, finally dems agreed reps pandemic must ended. decided so, happen! Woosh Corona virus, Woosh B.1 variants! need anymore! hear parties want anymore? Go bad somewhere else! so, hard locked multi-million dollar mansions access every luxury world, completely relate peasants like us, many lives ruined mental well-being completely stripped away. 

/s I'm Scotland UK, see actually owe $42,184.20.

""Only"" $42,184.20? going say EMA approves Sputnik V? know new Safety Dance commercial going cheer people up...  Zero evidence assume already herd immunity ignore reinfections reduced vaccine efficiency.

I remember abunch people claimed herd immunity claimed victory last two times. Im hopeful going remain cautious continue atleast consider experts saying. Could please point view raw data? Everything read suggests raw data publicly available. hell is? 46% immunity would huge impact case numbers... That's basic math, man 40 million vaccine doses probably hurt either. get that, i'm wary baseless claims, concerned CDC post. Antibodies contracting good 3-4 months though temporary take masks? think mandatory mask wearing helps reduce transmission? Rhinoviruses really reinfect often actually. Corona viruses unsure deal is. guess many positive antibody testswhere people get reinfected false positives though, still fairly small number people. hope front line employees continue wear masks forever. There’s reason cashiers world breathing droplets onto me, pandemic pandemic. words, publicly available.

AFAIK sputnik data also shared regulatory bodies various countries vaccine authorized, too. Morbid obesity #1 risk factor serious COVID-19 complications, well expensive diseases, like Type II diabetes. 

Morbid obesity self-caused condition avoided little discipline.

Seems like bear least expense. Exactly, “Super contagious strains 70%!!!!!” Headlines silly. may transmissible, right it’s paper cases taking nosedive. people insist blindly following guidance staying home mass vaccinations risk hospitals overwhelmed goes away, they're virtue signalling. certain point think stop blindly hoping people power best interests heart. Probably not, people won’t go anyway. mean open bit, restaurants still pretty empty. Key subjective qualifier ""after COVID-19"", likely means drastically different things different people. ""clap 7pm healthcare workers"" shit think important note conclusion btw:  


""The high risk bias trials, variation outcome measurement, relatively low compliance interventions studies hamper drawing firm conclusions generalising findings current COVID‐19 pandemic.""  


Sounds like find much confidence study, though studies conducted show masks helpful. Yay! Let's spread B.1 variants, mean love fun joy! terms hospitalisations, we're getting closer numbers Novemberm Yup, anyone who's ever worked classroom knows this. still cringe student diagnosed SWINE FLU coming class. Kicked 103 degree fever ass right out. really useful question trials South Africa people virus received vaccine... get reinfected? answer long run likely get control  We'll call world's single largest vaccine maker, Serum Institute India, tell 'em bin them, shall we? assume footing $1.8bn vaccine doses. Oh, freezers need get developing world effective vaccines-- all, AZ fridge-temp vaccine-- we'll need invest probably one industrial freezer every 100km everywhere world, maybe another $12bn. 

Nothing ever easy simple sounds. Yes, would great make 20 billion doses Pfizer -70c, would impossible deploy would take probably 15 years make enough. ik least stories clerical misunderstandings masks made it. ya us stopping exports pretty expected given lot nations it. pulp thing btw lot overblown is. wood pulp used make specific type surgical mask, general n95 masks didnt use haven’t looked research smoking, specifically. went CDC’s “higher risk” list No, 100% agreement all. even remotely, even little bit. People wore '18 flu pandemic. People went jail wearing them. new thing particularly widespread/fast spreading disease. increases lot. addition looks increasingly likely going herd US actually going keep control. People get one shot look protected strains virus before.particularly South Africa possibly Brazil. they're similar think J&amp;J modified spile protein something. exactly same. would probably explain AZ vulnerable south african variant. I'm going bet vaccinated simply one *those* people says, ""Do say do."" thing is, constant 20000 daily cases generating enough hospitalisations overwhelm health system. Strangely, death numbers keep increasing unlike new cases remain constant good now. people care original. sequels ain't stopping one partying. Crazy thing Trump presidency saying wasn’t fault taking credit success Biden. 

Trump followers plain delusional. country live in? vaccinated?  planning get vaccinated? Peru something similar reward suffering one highest per capita deaths world good news super bowl mass gatherings dt Florida, large private gatherings, block parties. see stays true two weeks see increase cases, two weeks later hospitalizations, month later deaths. basically need improve shelf stability mRNA vaccines, viral vector vaccines completely obsolete. Nice headline scam article. read insurance covered almost entire bill.

They actually owe $42,184.20. 

If low income hospital work reduce get payment plan. Missing work trivial consideration compared potentially spreading virus numerous patients coworkers, mention getting sick missing much work mild vaccine side-effects.

Characterizing vaccination ""trial run infection"" also misleading. thing experience mRNA vaccines symptoms immune response simulated spike protein. experiencing anything close unique symptoms COVID19. suggesting lockdowns place hospitals overrun? speaking local grocery store emptied healthy foods....fish, poultry, fruits, etc.

Amazing. 

It seems people starting health issues lockdown stuff going about/sedentary lifestyle....

Never seen before. Nobody gonna check sleeping someone isn’t household not. Politicians know people break rules too, fact they’re breaking themselves. Date away. definitely agree last part. American conservative spending business protection really made much difficult needs been. people actually able stay home sick, think we'd lot less bodies, can't point study says can't sure. hypothesis vaccinating people other, unnamed, countries necessarily leaving people country unvaccinated practically morally superior?  morally superior since sacrifice well affluent Americans favor well poor non-Americans, practically superior since hypothetically effective reducing incidence mutations?  pretty much it?    

Which group Americans go unvaccinated order share?  I'm thinking wealthy, academics politicians celebrities.  

They want come say US get vaccinated order free doses countries.  ones considered ""vulnerable""?  children? virus novel once. People get re-infected Rhinoviruses coronaviruses time.....because drift original (novel) from.....but something totally new immune system seen once. Sure, that's hard evidence. link studies conclude that, see. kind matter though. still possibly spread even they're vaccinated. better question they're taking basica safety precautions, like wearing surgical mask, touching mask touching you. Yes someone process helping older relatives vaccine. Everyday becomes easier find appointments available every week supply ramping up. Hang Typhoid Mary!!!!!""

Lol, article clearly say either. spot difference? First wave, mostly NE. Second Wave, states, all, peaks 60k cases day. Third wave, virtually everywhere, 200k daily infections 2+ months.. Now, also vaccines coming out. comparable. ZERO evidence much prior infection another major surge. 1) stickers local Giant gone. 

2) Zoom meetings happening this. person business meetings also happening *now*. Zoom holidays *likely* gone? near certainty majority people wanna celebrate Christmas, something togetherness gifts, computer?? People holidays person 2020! 

3) ""Not normal back to"". I'm sorry- melodramatic NPR headline masquerading sober comment even *mean*? certainly ""normal back to"". Go bar maskless w/out capacity restrictions Friday night, go movie maskless w/out capacity restrictions Saturday, visit grandparents maskless inside Sunday. 

You're another world man. remember that, too. don’t think proven. Age one really truly significantly moves needle honest first flip flop knew people would go horde them, like toilet paper, leave enough people interacting people daily basis? one craziest questions I’ve seen here. course not. ever able order flu shot online? know refrigerated administered medical professional Interesting. hard time believing in, essence, worldwide conspiracy get people wear masks. Yap, BNT/Pfizer totally saved EU. huge outcry vaccines Germany. moment govt. announced we're getting 52.4 mil doses June BNT/ Pfizer alone, things calmed bit. we'll get another 14 mil extra 300 mil period. guess EU countries relief well. CDC [has smoking list risk hard scientific study quantify mask effects. 

The existing science 100% agreement masks extremely effective. really number. Sure.

The greatest number cases recorded one day U.S. Jan 8 308,000+ cases testing positive -- one week New Year's.

This follows trend people contact someone covid develop symptoms approx 3 7 days contact. thus schedule time get tested - day next day, couple days receive results (approx Jan 8 end time).


The greatest number deaths related covid recorded one day U.S. Jan 12 (4500 deaths) - 11 days New Year's.

This follows trend people covid develop severe symptoms, pass away approx 2 weeks contact.

Then starts show downward trend huge amount gatherings New Year's Superbowl.

Ready eat crow positive results increase 7 days? could plummet intentionally list every death covid. Battling lung cancer 4 years, covid, shot face, covid, natural causes, covid, TBI motorcycle accident, covid, complications diabetes, covid, influenza, covid.

You would think people would learn CDC published 200k deaths covid admitted comorbidities real number covid alone. Yeah type places probably always relied takeout anyways Could people likely spread COVID already done rest population abided social distancing mask wearing managed get yet? Wouldn’t mean effective population people virus could infect would much lower actual population, leading quicker drop transmission. ask question lot. optimist hopes actions governments buy citizens marginal health benefit. cynical side thinks easy way say ""look, something!"" public health officials ignore truly impactful measures like paid sick leave challenging implement. added links. anyone else noticed good portion posts sub involve someone saying ""I'm tired hearing everyone say \[extreme hot take one actually saying\].""? Clearly! lol good. care internet points. havin fun. :) 19 too, least another 6 months person uni stolen me. Really miss friends. use Novavax purpose, though? made multi-valent, easily updatable, normal refrigeration. AZ could make vaccine. didnt say anything grandmas might another commenter. guess think different saying ""It might possible still spread covid, smart use precautions study this"" reasonable thing say. Saying ""Remember Typhoid Mary!!!!!"" going scare frustrate people. honestly check worldometer you’re right, cases way UK SA way Brazil. know UK currently form lockdown vaccinating quite efficiently far know isn’t true SA Brazil. You’d think reading sub situation countries completely control variants. h? 

In November hit 80,000 infections per day 25% 20,000 vaguely remember that, yes heard much one way another since. Sweet, party time amiright? didn’t read way text. Happens us time time. Cheers \-Flexes butt- xD example country dont hospital vacancies anymore ran options lockdown thing left, situation. *gasp* sometimes care opinions people anime profile pictures, time, dont. ...and Biontech.  There's probably lot play here. myriad reasons could be: 

-they flip flopped already they're knee deep
-it politicized. 
-they figure even masks much they'll give people sense safety. IE safety theatre. really news. Since November? That's like 2-3 months ago. That's long... embarrassing fuck say something like that.

Yeah, killed anyone since November obviously I'm getting better normal. /Rolls eyes. still double rate last summer. Apart needing better PR writer, fine think going happen? spreading misinformation virus? Pretty sure he's good example do, least compared predecessor. makes sense. I'm singling out, necessarily, I'm sorry seemed way. hard look around see people close far insist living normally might literally never same! really glad they're healthy--I wish anyone. still leaves contractor line government decides funding, unstable president transition progress arguably wise thing take on.

Defense Production Act applies companies, labor (outside settling disputes). compel employees work prevent quitting. countries (which idea act came from) solve part actually able compel workers jail time fines quit refuse work. Amazing it. kissing homies spreads rona Except 10% population vaccinated additional vaccine way ramping distribution significantly. 10% vaccinated vulnerable 10% population. Combine fact large percentage US already COVID, combine fact number dropped significantly last Summer, Summer look **significantly** better? Yeah, people going partying right stupid isnt yet, things February 8th much better January 1st immunity vaccines vulnerable beginning kick soon, we're likely going see death rate cut SIGNIFICANTLY March. 

What reasoning expecting go Summer? Sputnik pretty good though, right? mind California gets vaccines faster. Whew. received first dose vacvine. concerned I'd get second dose wait forever get newer vaccine (when available) effective variants. autistic adult, probably lmao. nutcases think worst us. good Follow science

In trying times (more like trying patience)

Not really phrase seeing fanart anime characters isolation/wearing masks

By extension seeing franchises like plastered onto masks (looking Senketsu mask)

Experts

X company cares essential workers medical professionals got first? Yes, older people ones vaccinated now, even getting second dose think immunity would delayed. think Novavax/J&amp;J reported dropped like 50-60% SA variant.

This would require explanation. AZ J&amp;J use nearly identical delivery system (adenovirus vector) deliver vaccine produces identical spike proteins. huge gap two...? Tell it, 19 started began enjoying college life. I’ve locked home alone year. Never said that. careful. know live, lockdown. lol fuck folks pre-existing conditions immune deficiency, never leave homes again? feel comfortable ignoring disabled people?  getting thrown hotel balcony.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* want lockdowns reasonable

What would reasonable lockdown look like? numbers dashboard *are* state's reported numbers. cleric tested covid sticking magnet people’s asses? Pretty much. clinic volunteer simply comes shipment receive day that's it, everyone comes gets that. Pfizer go simply that's one received, Sunday AZ. cancer played big part well. Could elaborate that? Maybe mistaken schools, restaurants ave 50% dining (though guarantee isnt even close followed places), theaters open. Masks kids 5 years old (vs DC &amp; MD 2 years old) though admittedly compliance hit miss whole region especially kids.... You’ll also miss work catch covid...an immune response excuse put others risk, especially job involves close contact others. remember bringing countries. talking China. 

They hard plateaued 80k CASES. even deaths. country 1.4 bil. really delusional believe right? troll? seriously triple mask shopping. Double mask local shops.

And seriously apartment since entire pandemic began, go walks shopping. going bomb ass summer. I've seen Philly well. People gotten much comfortable indoor dining past months I've walked restaurant get takeout get hostess seated outside, increasing amount people I've seen dining inside, average (not including short period re-banned it).

Some likely due people group 'I'll dine outdoors least decent out, otherwise I'll eat indoors' winter changing preference, think comfortable it, especially vaccinated. finally recovered got taste smell back!!!! really scary never happened ever could happen humans ZC45/ZXC21-like bat coronavirus  able infect humans.

&amp;#x200B;

then **mutate**. 

so infect humans. species.

this good virus. 

more hosts = chances reproduce = preserve existence.

&amp;#x200B;

you're speaking 

**spillover** infections never happened.

and **zoonotic** organisms science fiction.

&amp;#x200B;

they're infection**, also known **pathogen spillover** **spillover event**, occurs population high prevalence comes contact novel host population. **The pathogen transmitted reservoir population may may transmitted within host **zoonosis** (plural zoonoses, zoonotic diseases) [infectious caused (an infectious agent, bacterium, virus, animal (usually **Typically, first infected human transmits infectious agent least one human, who, turn, infects others.**

Epicenter AIDS Found: Africa, someone ate sick provides increased opportunity transmission several animal hosts humans, would even bother take trials review make sure anti vector immunity factor. Maybe looking 2022 roll out. Global political clout, essentially. fed told nothing going change everyone vaccinated

Can give one example someone saying that? seems like large portion posts sub involve someone saying ""I'm sick hearing everyone say \[extreme position one actually saying\]"". Actually kicking, screaming, demanding rioting changed course history many times past. It’s got rights! source that? information lots public health organizations provided course pandemic changed time learned virus. lie say something know untrue. saying something believe true time, new information comes light changes understanding. evidence provided information knew untrue time?

I also repeat question think protected China from. Again, would happened China hadn’t protected it? 

You presenting theory China conspired together protect China unspecified harm. One could even call theory conspiracy “conspiracy theory”. conspiracy theory circulated past Donald Trump right-wing conspiracy theorists basis defund (but CDC, groups, provided similar, identical, information beginning pandemic), likely wrong (because lots people initially wrong) simply seek destroy international organizations part “America First” ideology. that’s you’re doing, I’d interested seeing evidence contrary. Might changed since last looked. control risk actions choose take comfort level. one owes emotional comfort detriment own. get say ""My fear important yours."" That's civilized society works. Also example. tried get appt. particular site ran appointments 29 seconds. UK roll boosters soon possible

They really can't though. That's downside using adenovirus vectors. develop immunity vector effective going forward. havent, I've part staying indoors much possible, triple masking go out.

Pretty sure he's troll guys lol Healthcare worker here. I'm cautiously optimistic, although I'm worried still one smallish surge left, mostly like said people getting social distancing quickly. Well, personal people mentality ae dangerous society harsh lockdown

We harsh lockdown. literally point pandemic, could freely leave home go vast majority pandemic hit. Well mean yeah. goal social distancing mask wearing etc never eradicate virus hospitals capacity. People going get covid die form covid decades case #’s hospitalizations deaths dropped dramatically United States allow people things tons people’s mental health gone drain EMA happy approve August longer interval happen. Gay living , yes  mechanic tell ""it'll disappear election"", wonder current thoughts Personally, continue monitoring case numbers. go movie theater amusement park unless good string less hundred new cases daily. I'm hoping vaccinations, see sting sub 100 daily cases state. Agreed. lot friends planning getting it. would love know survey took place way half America that. don’t think see day without 1000 deaths March. knows. Yeah actually happened. called advisory committee one Pfizer Moderna vaccines prior FDA decision. proceedings broadcast internet. 

They're going one J J vaccine also. No, cases actual infections picked up. infectious others time. We've gone 3 waves U.S. Deaths increased following cases every time every state. even debate point. go 3 waves completely wrong still argue NEXT TIME real casedemic? Lol Anyone half brain money move still CA point want sympathy fuck right off. nothing special Newsom, actually represents metropolitan CA dems quite well. Hypocrisy partying French Laundry lost. We'll see we're week superbowl. seems like lot discussion sub politically motivated. That's thing, yeah. think lot people first category posting ""I careful [they weren't], day 18 able smell taste makes wish careful"" gets ignored thread, solidly first category people get upvotes comments.  shall see really, future depends vaccines current (and future) variants. want lose progress made winter 2020/21 fuck summer 2021 exactly now. lockdown.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* one could seen coming. Keep 'er movin. pretty sure iran serious herd immunity going already though must idiot. referring deaths. Always last lagging statistic. AZ said working booster too. name alone Sputnik throw back winning space race. Russia smoke mirrors show, US. 
Edited. thread hilarious also gave headache. power words propaganda never cease amaze me. Pending lawsuits. Sounds like something rednecks South Park would say. 

Except that’s funny cartoon. ridiculous real life. live Canada. Social distancing policy prevents us getting closer two meters anyone outside household. technically, allowed date, without physical contact, bit unsustainable long term. Also, province, previously even meet single person inside outside, even mask social distancing. curfew make sure much social life 8 PM

Yeah, understand strict rules, gonna pretty rough lasts many years. uno reverse talked someone anti mask brought up. get though. I’m exhausted well. oh no.... I'm also betting another surge cases due Super Bowl gatherings. live mismanaged state country.

Citations needed. IIRC counter recorded significantly cases, almost additional deaths, like low double-digits. went sledding weekend. decent amount people around. Everyone masks far apart everyone, nice. literally couple hours talk anyone, enough 6yo say ""best day ever!"" 

Humans meant cooped alone. great social distancing, 100% affecting **all us** bad way. Well I’m side science one truly believe experts major scientists say we’d going back normal soon covid afterthought like Ebola nowadays AZs efficacy closer 82% there's 12 weeks wait doses.

Johnson &amp; Johnson probably reach level protection (80-90) two doses Honest answer: everyone talking Long Covid!, apparently common awful is. there's another excuse keep up. KNOW😩 I'm exact opposite. countries done well ones locked absolutely everything hitting zero COVID -- return full normal life afterwards (sans international travel, anyway).

On hand, seem measurable difference countries imposed harsh ""manageable"" restrictions months end Floridas Wisconsins gave public health middle finger looked back. go hard stop wasting life, say. white wine used red, rose? first shot turns gay second dose actually turns straight it’s really big deal. realize problems world exist aside COVID? mental health toll response COVID, COVID itself, taken people significant. addition there's economic side things.

Me personally? COVID nobody died COVID, lose job recently due second-order effects pandemic. addition last year I've developed lot bad habits due social isolation, especially alcohol, porn, internet dependency.

So feel sympathetic toward people suffer COVID, also lot shit going life that's due COVID. feel extremely sympathetic toward millions people going similar struggles myself. that's listing ways I've personally affected. can't even begin imagine much hurting kids. think millions Americans died alone last year causes COVID.

I want leaders form exit strategy soon, want people die COVID, want horrible second-order effects end soon reasonably possible. make selfish. People zero capacity empathy toward people suffering things unrelated COVID selfish ones. There's already highly publicized retraction covid paper Lancet. Politics why. bothered read replies thread you’d know. 

There war Middle East Asia end year. Biden canceling withdrawals. factor number mild/asymptomatic cases, we'll never know true number of, may well substantial.

Nor factor mobility (and safety practices) individuals immunity. Person may significantly greater contributor spread person B simply due person A's lifestyle. ""continue"" precautions take begin with? I’m Ottawa doesn’t impact me, sounds De Villa’s press conference REALLY doesn’t want reopen. think she’ll push significantly delayed. think sole driver no, yes think plays role happy that. 

I would agree part drop I'm sure post-end year stuff correction though. know downvoted, people literally miss work immune response. literature studies literally say normal body reacting spike, whatever. Everyone fucking Reddit expert. I've legit never heard ""mask casket"" one, automatically hate it. San Bernardino cal shit show general ban outdoor dining actually stop indoor dining, allow outdoor dining tons places still allow indoor dining, “outdoor dining” allowed say 50% San Bernardino restaurants reopened indoor dining billboards posters advertising Okay? voted Biden would recall Newsom, depending else running. head almost exploded. barely made 2 verses. bottom barrel awful. Seriously. people even realize they're asking for? They're begging government regulate freedom existence. I'm one say ""if like it, leave,"" really...if like freedom, countries functionally exist. Go try one size like allowed leave house see family whenever like. rights begging government take us, even ""these trying times."" Madonna, yes, infuriating. Possibly true, Biden admin authorize like quarter billion fund home testing. Biden admin isn’t worried numbers, due coincidence, focus switched testing vaccination time. please provide source? Yeah, but, much worse last couple weeks. Late 20's here... man, same. strong.  nothing courteous practicing safe hygiene. permanent mask-wearer someone let virus win pushes us closer ""new normals."" probably become racist symbol eventually. true. increased efficacy original strain booster 3 months. think honest, no. topic, like climate change, like scientific matter, never ever politicized.

Madonna yeah, insanely weird her. knows what's going head nowadays. estimates put 1/3 country already infected. Take account lot cases also people behaving risky ways, yes, probably herd effects starting show up. Tape top part mask, air goes bottom more, won’t fog much Texas South Carolina kind plateaud possibly rising slightly really nothing noticeable anywhere. hospitalizations low anyone else’s. Long-haul symptoms affect even 20-year-olds, know. worst one dying 70 years get disease. would fine think rest world comply. want lock COVID disappears (spoiler alert, never), go ahead.  deaths naturally cities, cities overwhelmingly liberal..I would say hypothesis staffing issue, tbh. need get lot people rather quickly. Saying ""While know short-term adverse effects, still know long term effects are"" one thing, connecting vaccines autism whole another thing.

Lol thanksgiving indoor dining lol bye Fauci keeps lying herd immunity thresholds well. triple mask like then?

Simple efforts wearing mask sick simple solution reducing spread respiratory communicable disease. easy, affordable, simple solution anyone do.

Colds annoying also drop someone else ass. I've enough colds debilitated enough could barely get bed, nose constantly running like faucet, persistent cough made chest burn.

Will completely eliminated? No. reduce number people getting sick all? Sure, enough people respect measure wearing masks they're sick. ah yes, need good proper crushing military lockdown. stick. totally remember local news saying “today swine flu declared pandemic” one cared. We’ve definitely lived one. World leading scientists agree AZ vaccine. hotline area? Call.

You know movie *Master Commander*? old seaman fingers tatoo'ed **HOLD FAST**. That's I'm doing. already been. youth limits. work, recreation, even risk would even clean done. rose petals can't go drain scoop out. That's got annoying I'm getting downvoted guys can't disprove thesis.

How 32 years old Teacher vaccinated tomorrow 60 years old Teacher wait 2-3 months get vaccinated.

That inconceivable happening right Italy. I'm sure take meaning. think saying spread SA variant inevitable, stoic take losses chin?

Lockdowns binary. Partial lockdowns still slow spread, know? yes, next pandemic handful cases somewhere, think buildings welded shut food delivered month prevent kind thing happening again. agree. Thanks guts say couldn’t. live life comfortable feel within limits lockdown rules. live life affect you.

If want wear single mask go ahead, judge. God exciting. Elating. Maybe late summer/fall we'll numbers low start move life. think Madonna found last century, 40 species relocated southern China, Laos Myanmar -- area genetic analysis suggests virus known SARS-CoV-2 first appeared. 

No one actually read article. amount times I’ve told people “global pandemic” redundant... 🤦🏻‍♀️ Literally 95% public health officials. Even Fauci’s saying can’t resume normal activity getting vaccinated full herd immunity achieved, isn’t happening 30-40% country won’t take shot. Far 1000+ deaths day national lockdown. Im vaccinated 10% effectiveness SA variant creeping us now. need booster vaccine that.

I want believe getting control yet much better everyone else. Thank service man, really appreciate it!

That's wanna hear right? anything people screaming making people stay home could considered selfish. me, would least choice whether decide stay home. scenario everyone must obey wishes. “We planning evaluating participants trial, 1 79 women got pregnant ditched 80 women kept foetus could finally begin phase III villainous plot win 2021 Shittiest Unscientific Study Award. Vote us Hague!” would worst thing short yet another variant even worse SA. may caught asymptomatic. Occams razor-esque explanation? Russia Russia, i.e. institutional bureaucratic inefficiencies and/or corruption causing discrepancies along way difficult cross t's. There's also probably non-zero amount ""wild hope"" involved process. 

While reasonable require standards every vaccine development effort, one expect get fully transparent picture stage. Undoubtedly kind mistakes handling data sets keeping everything order. Yes, double standard bells on. live northern Wisco every people come back visit always happy buy round two bill still cheaper would bigger cities. mean expensive beer I've gotten outside Madison Milwaukee probably 4.50 honest, question, saying really.

I left lockdown around fall, moved West Midlands, entered lockdown winter. Spiegel sits Hamburg, Moscow. Yep. Sadly. abundance caution, canceling/postponing * insert event * late worry variant others going take place soon now. Remindme! 60 days That's even point, definitely sending mixed signals dude talking possible reasoning vaccine definitely still give response. reason dumb ass reason keep herself, one arguing right wrong, I've legit heard given reason turning people work around general public. pitchforks come fucking quick half-read statements. confirmed. Hypochondria also higher among women. I'm saying women really really sick. wondering counting figured possible factors. Super cautious hypochondriac thinks society needs stop becuase scared. No. even mean? empty statement. idea downvoted. Missing mutations could easily change available epitopes antibody binding. sub tries really hard, sometimes scientific illiteracy prevails. Yes, one country planet, example ""natural herd immunity"" looks like country-wide scale. certainly saying herd immunity failure, would kindly ask refrain insinuating that. 

Sweden's cases dropping dramatically abandoned trying disease propagate population September 2020. become immensely strict limiting unnecessary human contact. 

Additionally, simply enough data suggest reinfections significant underlying variable. None. many US states simply tracking rates reinfection.

What credentials field made recklessly confident? propose unfounded notions make huge leaps logic, fact remains implementing policy needs done way prevents death overwhelming hospital infrastructure. best course action *never* permitting virus persist hopes achieving herd immunity. par saying flu virus ""disappear"" summer, quite frankly shows little understand talking about. Depends definition normalcy. personally get vaccinated, I'd say life lot closer normal time past year. oddly enough testified oath twice gay multiple interviews later life saying thing Fuck that, give vaccines think we'll return normalcy highest risk things (e.g. completely packed nightclub) June July. Masks probably around certain scenarios bit longer, like airplane, think they'll go away things involve right next random stranger hours. Man, really weird 3 weeks though. tempted ignore common sense safety measures plain house work; spite.

Same! Unrelated coronavirus: company awhile back required us attend training ascend descend stairs safely. shit not. made want slide handrails like kid spite. Bingo. People made minds March 2020 idea reinforced news outlets follow (FOX telling viewers scam, clips ""unmasked idiots"" clout-chasers saying outrageous things go viral Twitter) really drill there. Comparing Covid deaths 9/11 deaths Vietnam WWII. executive authority, presidential bully pulpit, used effectively honestly, powerful tool shaping national narrative even governmental power change policy. got first shot Novavax trial Sat. don’t know still enrolling think it’s given crossover you’ll get actual vaccine point. older flipper baby?

(You Google Flipper Baby, thing) Yeah agree this. feel like people drifting towards extremes around find middle.

I problem arguments say “we’re close let’s careful another 4 6 months” I’m fairly fed “new normal” “no leaving house till 2023” folks. ignores everything human nature (these parts life optional 3 month chunks they’re optional two straight years), point, ignores reality what’s happening medical science (if vaccines able greatly reduce hospitalizations deaths, absolutely need move toward normality.) I’ve putting dental care long, can’t even use covid excuse. Thank informing patients, would definitely feel way comfortable knowing protected. Probably troll, nobody wears three masks. people ""mentallity"" dangerous society? What's mentality?

I triple mask shopping, limited outdoor activity walks shopping. seen friends family.

I done everything part limiting spread virus keeping others safe, I'm dangerous? I'm seeing massive drop-off November January there

Think SARS-CoV-2 train, person walking. train moving, hard stop. period surge viral seeding period occurred July September. leads exponential growth subsequent decrease caused reduced mobility occurred beforehand. disease wave dynamics. know airport travel increased time.

Temporary increases travel little effect like holidays place already wave. experts telling us December doomed January February, modest decreases mobility known that?

Because January bad. hit peaks cases January. Deaths, lag cases, still going rather strong US. article single day. 7 day rolling average still shows deaths rather high. like models lot accurate think experts. probably detached reality think common. cases increasing anywhere US? think combo cases/hospitalizations % population vaccinated. Well consider Liberace then, I'm getting vaccine soon possible everyone yet. people stop wearing masks safe make sit harder havent vaccine yet. still catch spread it. let's makes sure float screw anyone hasn't. Tell coworker cases started dropping throughout western world time, unless they're proposing multi-national conspiracy, hold much water. Usually cell one x-chromosomes inactived barr body though, increase ace2 expression. clerics name? Al-aqs Jauhans Speaking though, I’m excited see comes mRNA medicine things like MS future. Especially BioNtech said mice Use pharmacies clinics, can, vaccines allow. More, closer home. Follow 7 day averages. Sundays always slower days still last Sunday  lied, living different life told people live. top Calis many problems, deal significant tax revenue drain people companies move away. good sign none-the-less. *All countries need vaccinated immediately stop variants

None questions answered, got efficacy % specific variant small scale trial. impacts strategy ultimately goal lower cases lower deaths. Whispers mask burning parties full swing, current rumor end school year. Question anyone restaurants allowed limited capacity: ever run capacity limit? Indoor dining allowed 25% 50% capacity (forgot which) around here, tried go restaurant know much demand is. people clamoring get restaurants turned away due limit, limits basically irrelevant people going ""no thanks"" eating pandemic anyway? Taking personal risk like climbing tree different impacted people's behaviour.

With drunk drivers, bow wishes insignificant selfish groups. campaign tell people drink drive, we're done need negotiate, need change majorities behaviours accommodate them.

I low risk group get 6 months sick full pay year healthcare free. protecting use mask get vaccine. protecting others, decision debate involving fringe groups, lack emotional intelligence Hopefully May US start opening full capacity again. People might still wear masks stores, theaters schools open. happens homosexual vaccinated?

I really need know!

LMFAO. Antibodies attach spikes rendering virus unable hijack cells reproduce.

I one would take given chance.  Yea fucked China PPE. stupid way thinking. It’s doom gloom. suggesting another peak cases? question next peak come low current wave go trends again. Hopefully get front vaccines, actual increasing spread transmissible variants occurring, point it’s real possibility either drive new peak slow descent current peak. doom gloom. SoCal spread blew up? probably saying whole thing over. turn out? reminder, please keep civil. Wishing celebrating harm befalling anyone result ban subreddit. Keep classy. TWO elected US congressmen died Covid? One 41 one 67. crazy me. AZ J&amp;J start shift towards young anyway, time Pfizer Moderna finally deliver en-masse developed countries. hope. 65 crowd main source spread population. Younger individuals are. lead less cases, less deaths. I'm aware state prioritizing essential workers. Everyone pretty much gave idea went age. [About We're year people still freaking seeing maskless people news OUTDOORS Tampa. I'm holding breath. Frankly, doesn’t matter haven’t paid vaccines. manufacturing plants US going use doses rapidly vaccinate much population possible. we’re done we’ll fulfill orders.

If don’t like build manufacturing plants. got one October. Super cheap time year. I'm vaccinated then, I'll upset. laughed way hard this! Fuck.  lol, what? flu shot worse getting flu? No. Covid also much worse flu. Illinois one worst death rates throughout pandemic, find state even plan distribute vaccine requiring reopen state. I'm sure anyone could proud handled this. Well we're supposed get 336k next week. get every week that's 2 million end March we've already received 1 million looks pretty easy hit 4 million mark considering size shipments increasing.

Moderna hand much hopes they'll hit order numbers Sameee hahahaha maybe Iranians always gay come blame vaccines haha thank god vaccine conspiracy theories hahahaha I'll actually answer questions.

Long hauler means suffering ""symptoms"" result damage virus physically done organs. longer symptomatic virus it, still recovering physically, months year after.

Symptoms typically:

- Shortness breath persists
- inability physical exercise without causing heart feel strained
- large amount GI/IBS issues, including intermittent nausea
- coughing cases still persist
- chest pains
- brain fog
- issues blood clotting
- issues general inflammation triggered easily (that lead symptoms, among others, happen).
- etc

Even mild cases COVID cause problems. pretty mild case months ago heart lungs starting feel back level normal. existing mild IBS bit severe gotten better. science beginning basically ""everyone stay home."" 

Where Newsome deviated science time, mostly open. Law medicine operate different norms. runs randomized trial raising minimum wage? Usually lawmakers talk base maybe experts choose feels like work. Level 1 evidence trillion dollars checks stimulus would help American economy first batch went Congress fine. 

Medicine bad experiences “probably work” evolved become evidence based. result experts hesitant recommend probably works aren’t sure. 

IMO field could learn other. hard imagine single dose Pfizer Moderna would cleared 50 percent efficacy mark two months case would approved. may well less durable two doses trials could measured anyway. think Fauci extremely correct operating norms medicine UK position sensible lawmakers treated look immigration wage policy likely long delay doses would become standard. 66% moderate severe cases, might add. J&amp;J report overall efficacy. Herd immunity isn’t zero sum. There’s prob enough immunity places slow down. Sorry sorry. So... ignoring state legislature deaths, one representative-elect (only 41 years old) one serving representative, (still 20-odd years younger average life expectancy birth) died COVID-19. 

And yet there's still assholes, party guys in, refusing wear masks political virtue signalling.

Honestly think Democrats use time floor simply hold minute silence fallen congressmen. Every single day. 40 cases total including placebo group. younger, one either group got real sick. logic prevent moderate symptoms young people, probably stop severe illness older people. Yes no. ""Mild disease"" still include pretty severe symptoms even land hospital, well long-hauler symptoms. also data hospitalizations deaths (they're guessing), sample size small South African trial. Maybe medical community regarded women hysterical human incubators

Can confirm, woman I'm terrified getting sort severe medical issue getting taken seriously. There's black female youtuber follow dealing half body randomly becoming paralyzed can't get proper medical care part taken seriously. think may endo well honestly bad BC even worth headache looking 3rd world countries need vaccinated immediately stop variants comments post wild 😂😂😂 I'm choking laughter hahahahahaha Dems gained complete control state government, state became MUCH better run (budget surplus, etc). comes open-minded redditors cheering deaths assume disagree with! 50 million people U.S. 65. far 30 million people received least one shot vaccine. Maybe quite near herd immunity, reasonable assume good chunk 65 vaccinated, therefore we're seeing less sickness therefore less confirmed cases? live green state give whirl things back little normal. Thank you! Washington state, last Monday first time could anything indoors pretty much, 25% capacity only. That's also Pierce, King, Snohomish counties believe, rest state still indoors activity allowed. facilities exist without corporate welfare paid taxpayers... gloom doom, boys, gloom doom. 🐧 👋 lol good riddance Yup. friend texted 15 us otherwise last group (30s, healthy, non-essential workers) signing up-my partner wait get confirmation jobs would count towards “community service” PTO day February spots taken releasing March ones day now. can’t wait Good luck getting unwilling populace comply. really unrealistic think Pfizer still hit targets though. 3M doses 6 weeks really much. Considering supposed get 20 million doses 3 months that.  fewer fewer people also care, decide there’s life hiding bed forever avoid one specific virus. 

And they'll shocked spread picks back mutations become common. politicians care population starts rioting continued restrictions, unemployment, on. 

Sadly, think demonstrated all-too-well past year powers really care riots mass unemployment. idk, there's also age old ""man flu"" stereotype. would argue men even mildest symptoms, we'd hearing LOT it. Seems like good way ensure cure worse disease. must brunch set. Sounds like he's trying set excuse comes closet later. 


Or, least, that's looks like me. Probably people gathering celebrate Jan 20th think “GOP backed initiative,” delusional. Lots people, republicans want Newsom gone. Newsom failed California also failed politician. broken rules lied it, butchered covid response, simply doesn’t care constituents. It’s time California gets new leadership. big cities disaster, jobs leaving, politicians corrupt, crime high, poverty high, pollution high, taxes high, record numbers people leaving state, rich CEOs Celebrities live million dollar mansions Beverly Hills pay almost taxes get special treatment government. However despite issues, Californians continue vote whoever next name every election cycle. Politicians need held accountable voters need learn enough enough vote new leadership current politicians aren’t job. too! least state trying tax 16.8%. fucking state want money. stink everybody made Net Neutraility, stopped trusting anybody social media provide actual reasons worry. No. virus similar ones found nature. Random mutations occur time. take lab mutate virus; that's strongest weapon survival. Viruses jump humans pretty frequently actually. plagues human history caused them. one exception. 

I understand need something big caused big event big entity. scary think big things happen control it. case, that's happened. series small, random mutations eventually produced strain virus crossed species barrier. Maybe something lost translation? What’s Iranian “Once you’ve one prick you’ll need another”? well, even locked now. kids still go school i'm at. thats argument.  reach herd immunity prevent variants spawning i'm about. Delta announced they're extending middle seat blocking April 30. see lot comments thread companies allowing mask usage early pandemic. early that, coincide early reccomendations Faucci wear masks? Yeah, Cuomo announced 25% capacity indoor dining, used proof ""life normal"".

Takeout, no, don’t wipe containers. risk picking food time spend waiting inside around others, interaction server brings food. Groceries, no, know surface transmission minimal. Exactly. Even data protection severe cases normal variant pretty minimal, basically data. 

Their current defense basically data implies vaccine really working SA variant, data set different variant gives vague indication (but actually statistically significant!) might extra protection severe cases top protection symptomatic cases, could hypothetically mean vaccine still protects severe cases caused SA variant. 

It seems pretty clear they're making strong case. I'm feeling optimistic AZ vaccine anymore, one probably getting phased plans near future. fortunately Pfizer looking great J&amp;J pretty uplifting results SA variant well.  don't? actually tell. immune response overwhelming laboratory testing don’t really need new trial, Pfizer came conclusion study believe two separate others

Why think AZ larger trial? lab testing showed inadequate SA variant. Moderna Pfizer’s case wasn’t case Absolutely true Sunday’s numbers. I’m way saying bad news remember Sunday numbers usually lowest week. recognizing bad looking Wednesday’s numbers, likely worse Sunday’s, saying getting worse. It’s 7 day (or more) average... daily numbers. Well, released all. leak/rumours surrounding study late last week, Oxford responded press statement. assume briefed media outlets, screenshots came from.

I know sure though, imagine SA government privy matters myself, making decisions best scientific knowledge available. also tend think second “officially” ease things you’ll add quite people potential likely infection pool.

Send condolences dad kid. see proof large rate people dying reinfections I’m really concerned. Getting positive result PCR test isn’t we’re ultimately trying prevent. understand argument.

The reason acting way right first time human history wealth technology attempt live restrictions.

The wealth part key. poor cannot afford live lockdown life. rich societies controlled rich people government workers (who may rich access perceive unlimited source paychecks). token dollars sent poor keep patient.

But money tap end. patience zooming ends too. keeps us together restrictions prospect largely soon.

Thus start hundreds thousands active cases (at least), takes darn long time get zero. 

Also, even close borders ""people goods"", goods gonna magically teleport themselves, people handling those. point might notice current flow goods in/out UK quite bit higher case NZ, far Europe - supply chains production capacities built around gonna change weeks. one getting vaccinated Iran? Well that's happens use bad antivirus. argument had, horrifically callous one, one had.

&amp;#x200B;

""This affects elderly dying anyway"" absolutely evidence anywhere near 100%. 18-day-old account posting nothing fear-mongering bullshit. What? Germany gets 66.4 million dieses end June? confirmed? vaccines recommended give patient compromised immune system. 

False. Inactivated virus vaccines recommended, specially immunocompromised patients. less effective, absolutely still recommended. 

Otherwise elderly pregant people wouldn’t vaccinated flu campains - completely nonsensical. wondered beginning probably explains CDC, Dr. Goal Posts recommending masks first months pandemic. simply evidence.

There still really evidence, would need kind study two roughly equivalent populations people, one wore masks another not, measure spread. study ever done.

There analyses droplets particles far sneeze travels guesswork model real world situations.

Most studies see post hoc statistical analysis try correlate lower levels spread mask use various degrees inconclusive, probably many variables play can't control for.

So really much evidence one way become polarizing thing people do. cruise industry one worst. It’s awful environment, tremendously exploitative workers. wouldn’t mind seeing permanently destroyed. possible live still respect peoples health concerns. comments got deleted ... exactly US. Tons articles much US ordered delivery schedule. may wait longer though.

The interesting piece point happens J+J two dose trial. two doses show similar effect two dose mRNA vaccine would probably change strategy bit. rate people vaccinated might waiting time that.  that's missing entire point, already enforced pandemic, even pro-mask communities. 

I'm asking simple question, anyone seen evidence kind growing sorry permanent mask mandate? happening. Like sure, could paranoid million things happening, tend save energy things actually happening. also improve vaccines now, continuing use them. virus going stop mutating, best figure approach help anticipate next set mutations. situation fluid, willing adapt. country mandatory masks outdoor, ridicolous, risk infection low outdoor dont think masks greatly reduce it. Russia earned every last drop skepticism they're facing here. xenophobia, application historical knowledge. flown lot lately, including internationally (S Africa UK). Everyone show proof negative PCR test boarding, masks required. think people problem masks flights, although study says flying dangerous anything else, masks worn, due airlines improving air filtration systems. even know servant means? Yep NIH needs Instituteof chronic disabling disease can’t copy link :/ Agreed.

If made kids sick instead killing people age older, airwaves would full pictures little snots miserable, country would actually tried fight thing. Side effect: rest us would safer.

The world might better place right scenario. he’s said hyperbolized true.

And gall try defend lack luster vaccine saying spread doses would probably result better efficacy. may well true vaccines like that, whole 3 week regimen creature conducting trial faster anything else. Regardless unbelievably premature data publish different dosing regimen effective. 

The saga AZ successful PR campaign make sub standard vaccine incompetently run trials. thing masks studies supporting idea they’re effective either computer models massively affected bias reliable source info, studies performed clinical, laboratory spaces don’t reflect real practical usage them, observational studies cherry picked support larger scale idea. sound pretty callous unfortunately. 

My comment explicitly related upstate, *vastly* different NYC (disproportionately older too)

I three 90 yo grandparents wild goose chase find vaccine appointments since first day they've available. 

I've volunteered drive grandparents 4 hour trip receive vaccine, grandfather never able schedule consecutive appointments grandmother.

Pharmacies beginning receive vaccines, appointments filled within minutes announcement.

Now, expanding eligibility younger groups, subgroups leapfrog elderly familiar online interface. 

Cuomo's plan works well NYC, similar enacted policy, he's leaving upstate dry. I'd curious hear experiences upstaters vaccine availability. 3 greatest compliment I've ever gotten. expect done recruiting? went B C. couple things influenced this. family members contract it, even know sick others solid 5 weeks. last weeks get closer able get vaccinated bubble shrunk even more. would hate get COVID making far. comment linking businessinsider automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Social distancing, masking time, rest measures fucking blow make life objectively worse. 

Fuck anyone doesn’t get vaccinated prevents us getting track return normal. 

I’m even touching person’s willingness put people risk longer pick literal scientific miracles we’ve offered. Absolutely insane. Yeah is. go comfortable, it. try encourage anyone come it. elearning really fucking kids many levels. I'm tired hearing everyone say vaccines cause autism! /s That's insane. guy complications lung cancer, fuck get vaccinated I'm idea people fully choose get vaccinated that's problem.

Tell March 2020 govt honest said 'this last mid 2021 maybe 2022' would go along it? course men die disproportionately covid start stepping nursing home deaths never said anything even approximating herd immunity via infection ""best course action"". Unlike you, however, refrain asking credentials - open forum anybody comment. need permission speak confidently subject, downvotes would suggest I'm well within guardrails generally understood science matter.

I sure familiar conditions outside Sweden, US essentially full-on herd immunity via infection since last summer. Restaurants open 100% capacity, families still mingling multi-generational get-togethers, extended families traveled country Thanksgiving Christmas, schools open many areas, vast majority people decrease mobility since last April genuflected New York cases ourselves. last administration primed country letting infections wash population essentially happened point. can't call case counts 200,000+ per day anything else that.

You can't keep trying prove negative without providing meaningful sources. Please provide sources back theory reinfections ""significant underlying variable"". Anecdotal fluff pieces Forbes NBC count. available piece research recently released Restricting reinfections probable reinfections only, estimated June 242 November 2020, participants positive cohort 99% lower odds probable 243 reinfection, adjusted (aOR) 0.01 (95% CI 0.00-0.03). Restricting reinfections 244 symptomatic estimated participants positive cohort 95% lower odds 245 reinfection, aOR 0.08 (95% CI 0.05-0.13).

Just silly typo. mother works district. far cases among students low, hasn’t outbreak yet.

I think qualifies? They’re masking ventilation protocols, assume that’s good thing. one hamburgers shoved throats become overweight, ate calories. mental health suffered greatly since lockdown, ready go back normal life even dream regularly (movie theaters, arcades, shopping malls, bowling alleys, bars). post gives optimism really needed, checked daily covid cases sharp decline since Covid vaccine administered. Comorbities i.e. serious heath conditions like diabetes, heart disease, cancer, etc. main thing increases couple Americans visit Barbados stay Barbados spend money Barbados, supporting local economy. 

A couple Americans visit Barbados cruis ship, pay money cruise ship operator, eat sleep cruise ship. biggest part added value goes cruise ship operator, fraction trickles low wage workers, cleaning lady. 

It’s shitty form tourism host country point view, little added value. Cruise operators actually make money tropical beaty/ touristic POI another country. cost (pollution, overcrowding) destination, profits go cruise companies. 

The sooner industry dies, better. AZ's vaccine 75% effective. exceptional, still great enough taper corona, bruh. mean considering performance COVID people literally refuse wear mask pandemic? can’t see willingly wearing mask cold. track record bad gets. Oregon. don’t vaccines yet everyone administer they’re yet. good idea. Fuck. I'm literally sitting ER right now. Definitely weird world wonder doctors running scans/tests even believe science. I'll disagree. Someone eligible able schedule vaccination ""irresponsible"" public health fully vaccinated person (myself) wanting wear face covering anymore. being, longer want divert default lifestyle accommodate hypothetical person's public health irresponsibility. situation would reversed; they're ones irresponsible ""covidiots""- suffer consequences accordingly longer responsible. Source: Trust Hmmm. call social 14 cases retirement home, probably expecting 3 4 deaths, minimum. mild cases fantastic result, great sign vaccines effectiveness.

We relying vaccine stop spread infections, stop severity Run audio gasping air 40% fatalities nursing homes, 80-90% among age 65+ especially comorbidities. fatality rate young healthy people source saying extension likely? I'm expert PB&amp;J sandwiches. Nothing wrong that. constantly bombarded articles &amp; opinion pieces like ""This PB&amp;J expert says this...and alarming"" ""That PB&amp;J expert reveals unprecedented new info PB&amp;Js,"" people never going want hear single thing mouth ever again, even technically right.

Edit: give ""anti-science"" garbage. tactic calling people Nazis white-supremacists they're side aisle. fucking lazy. Mask, distancing, private gathering limits still place, far tell re-opening apply businesses able serve customers store, 25% capacity. Teacher here. Find school following proper sanitation procedures. Awesome! depends mean 'normalcy'. likely hit 90% normalcy well, well August. would guess April. full, 100% normalcy? Crowded nightclubs everything open, everywhere? Likely late summer. cases likely drop low figure well then, people still begin leading lives returning normal spring. 

Its important note '70% vaccinated' figure misleading. need full herd immunity. need enough herd immunity virus stops big deal. handle thousand cases nationwide return normal. Gotta ramp dem inoculations. Right, makes us want vaccine feel like ""okay, going go forever?"" makes us want give up. god awful messaging  Tampa bay*
""Hold beer"" Wait, happens Iran? possible. wonder many people California open moderate Republicans always end voting Democrat Republican party recently went batshit insane. We're talking cruise ships. high? corona cases dwindling, 2021 great start :) constant doom gloom masks forever, even vaccine, makes people say fuck nothing. People need feel reward stop complying media can't help negative angle everything covid. Dan Rather literally bitching SB commercials sent bad example people without masks. world live now? thanks. thought. virus mutate infectious time less lethal caused asymptomatic infections, see play similar happening now? 

Maybe lot people infected mutation vast majority infections asymptomatic people getting tested. end result would lot closer herd immunity think are? 

I know Spanish Flu different family viri mutate existence?

This crazy rambling cuff non-medical professional. Edgy! Indoors, yes. Outdoors, seem safety theater.  Yeah absolutely does. work 2 different hospitals outside major city. One suburban area country area. definitely different perspective COVID them. nurses country hospital talked don’t make kids wear masks think masks make difference. that’d unheard other. I’m getting vaccine weds mom Saturday! euphoric 🥳 Yep exactly. mean kind makes sense, smokers lung health issues. study data. safe dispose masks abolish social distancing early Autumn 2021 assuming reach herd immunity summer (the U.S. gov't wants mass vaccinations Spring 2021). Oh no, idiots going start running without masks farting other’s faces. Stay fuck inside watch tele! mean use vaccines now. IFR Covid 0.4%, reduce 80%, 0.08%, far lower flu. vast majority people Reddit loser shut-ins. Since pandemic started, nothing changed. They're usual antics, screaming mommy tendies shitposting day. based international advocacy groups, including CARE ONE Campaign, say needed, calling $20 additional money fund initiatives like COVAX may easiest way forward, experts think it’s enough, program still drastically week announced aim distribute 300 million doses — enough cover 3 percent receiving countries’ populations — end quantity doses terrifyingly inadequate,” said Peter Maybarduk, director Access Medicines program consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. Seems reasonable. Hospitalizations low distant future percent country rises vaccine. hard justify shutting businesses case regardless whether even technically herd immunity. Interesting, US theory Christmas season increased infections, Sweden theory Christmas season decreased infections?

I wonder Sweden getting close herd immunity. states US North Dakota restrictions relatively rural population concentrated relatively places, kind like Sweden. Without many controls cases dropped stayed months.

The flip side high rate infections large portion population gets exposed becomes immune. Herd immunity on/off switch arrives gradually % immunity increases. one initially confused title? 

I re-read times, there’s way 100k deaths per day point.

I didn’t know 100k reported new cases day.

Glad see turn around hopefully get herd immunity end year! virus mutating lot well. new mutation we're risk strain resistant vaccine, antibodies developed people who've already it.

Have definitely keep pressure up. People getting lazier lazier they're sick it, feeling comfortable taking risks numbers go down. 

It's dangerous mix. never reach herd immunity? wait forever see loved ones start living again? Life full risks take every day. I’ve following guidelines best haven’t seen anyone besides doctor dentist indoors without masks almost year now. end? family friends vaccinated risk serious illness dying covid much lower even driving work store example. strain hospitals significant portion vulnerable vaccinated much lower well. We’re going wait around forever start living again. certain point it’s worth risk.  gives whole new meaning side effects vaccinations... Hopefully, sure thing. one thing show treatment works petri dish. another thing show works real live humans, serious side effects. New normal Oh,I wonder fuss then?! found interesting article referring study linked.  


And meta-analysis says asymptomatic risk transmission 40% lower symptomatic.  Makes sense. normally host massive indoor party everyone know celebrate intimate personal holiday. people might walk past even blocks later, wearing mask residential area necessary though.  CanSino agreed supply 35 million doses Mexico Malaysia talks get 3.5 million shots. Pakistan, one CanSino’s biggest trials conducted, get 20 million shots. There’s nothing wrong capacity. I’m guessing surge testing pre Christmas post Christmas. you’re negative, family get together on. post Christmas test make sure clear. mom (doctor) thing took every fiber yell right there. recommending vaccine patients though I’m lost reasoning... gone several rounds publix lack enforcement. POS company. wish alternative. Yep. could see death getting super low soon April, keep getting vax risk. states others succeed this, Virginia completely incompetent we've barely got anyone vaccinated. due pressure business groups, explanation bypassed quantitative measures tiered reopening. mRNA technology changes fucking game. People don’t seem really get yet worried short-term. get it. really do. won’t give shit also-rans years.

We focused ramping production mRNA vaccines. 

What say.. 21st century international travel begets 21st century biotech solutions. 🤷‍♀️ Yes, generally people pay trolls brigade threads Israel lol. hope die earthquake. way cure covid American manner also get vaccination McDonalds  heck consider political headline? never want hear read following words phrases rest life shit over:

* Wear mask
* together
* Unprecedented
* Social distancing
* Super-spreader
* Fauci/experts

Feel free add may forgetting. mean, there's difference virtue signaling genuinely afraid catching virus and/or spreading people household. I'd rather take less effective vaccin available now, effective vaccin available 6 months.

Give booster vaccin SA variant actually becomes threat. England completed study, preliminary findings Oxford vaccine prohibits transmission well prevents disease.

  Probably degree yes. 

That said, really hard know much spread reduced. something directly measured, really need wait see impact populations decent portion vaccinated. Basically, look numbers graphs US states different levels restrictions, correlation strength restrictions severity Covid. Plus, hospitals overwhelmed something imminent, resources create space-in fact, already haven’t needed to. I’m protecting elderly Covid, Covid restrictions tailored necessary. spread Covid mainly caused symptomatic presymptomatic cases-not asymptomatic spread, chance presymptomatic spread lower due symptoms like coughing spread particles. already know Covid works, it’s realistic idea US control it, measures really worth taking ones directly protect people could actually severely affected virus (voluntarily though, don’t keep house arrest.) cases went Thanksgiving...not indoor dining.....

There things called cars trains. I’m sure you’ve heard people using forms transportation go dine Long Island, upstate, NJ Connecticut anyway. 25 percent capacity isn’t going change much us. folks financial interests AstraZ? can’t understand irrational support company.

The reason simple: political.

There massive campaign show UK regulators faster EU, investment UK governement AZ vaccine great big deal - UK produce vaccines need anymore (typical vaccine nationalism).

So like Astrazaneca became banner Brexit, Boris desperately needed Herd Immunity disaster, overall pandemic management.

And working, people go completely berserk defend AZ UK Govt. decisions, **people joyful bash EU AZ over-promise under-deliver vaccines 50%** - like, delay breach contract responsible potential thousands deaths, fuck EU! Right?

Boris even commented UK roll secured vaccine leave England UK orders met - god forbid let manufacturer manage stock compensate part failure UK produced vaccines, help EU!

All want win stupid race, UK see better without EU, winning vaccine race. sad disgusting, participate vaccine nationalism brainwash people.

I really hope get SA variant control, they're going need mRNA vaccines EU makes wait stock EU gets fully vaccinated reciprocity behavior, going bad.

Currently countries exporting vaccines EU, India, China Russia - eyes UK Nationalists one that's worth anything India producing AZ.  Generally get elected aim improve lives everyone country, people like. 

Also wearing mask isnt dangerous person without mask, also increases spread infection everyone near them. Given deaths naturally cities, cities overwhelmingly liberal..I would say hypothesis incorrect. spike see super bowl would house parties, stadium audience. Even doubt there’ll significant spike. older population ones vaccinated right now. main spreading group. 48 hours Trump Twitter. Sign up! I'm men. single-dose vaccine efficacy rate 65.7% preventing symptomatic cases, 90.98% preventing severe disease. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* lockdown general, especially strongly 9PM-4:30AM curfew imposed country (the Netherlands). find curfew particular almost dystopian.

I supported lockdown first weeks pandemic, flatten initial curve. lockdown lasting close year, however, excessive. suspect years' time, people look back lockdown disproportional mass insanity. 

The jury yet, thinking retrospect realize increases decreases amount cases per day driven almost entirely non-societal factors like season, climate, hours daylight, (seasonal) use airconditioning, on, efforts little influence spread virus. pet theory mine mostly inspired fact cases per day expected effects spread based severity lockdown measures particular point time country match (at all) past 11 months. think one moments wrong, undoubtedly right either. 

It single biggest reason experts think cases dropped dramatically India hit hard NYC, summer estimated 25% city's population likely antibodies based test sampling. assumption antibodies prevent transmission way around. someone actively prove not, something people worrying about. What's ita efficacy severe disease and/or hospitalisations? goal? need NFL stadiums this? shortage retail pharmacies shots administered? think Johnson Johnson 51% (or thereabouts) SA variant. That’s coin flip, know, it’s better AZ! Everything read science perspective Russian vaccine good. 

They poisoned well PR stunts, think really evidence safe highly effective vaccine.  What’s better vaccine vaccine 10% effective?  China really pay this. Covid19 stage 4 lung cancer, want accurate. think issue conflating pre-symptomatic truly asymptomatic. possible spread virus actually start show clear symptoms, window fairly small believe less infectious symptoms fully kick in. also many people show mild symptoms throughout might believe COVID-19. Truly asymptomatic infections thing, said. use website correctly... supposed actually type search click button website gives unique URL share walk people google.

Some people really bad figuring exactly put search box get back information looking for. I’m sure smart necessary given widespread use vaccine already. India isn’t alone though, Japan requiring local studies approval. 

The important factor Pfizer reapply decide study. wanted people understand India didn’t outright reject vaccine. high degree confidence lab tests iirc third one they’ve done similar identical results. I’ve trying explain people sub people seem hell bent defending AZ I'd like see sources 90% new builds gas (assuming mean LNG/LBG). highly doubt I'm open wrong. entire thing spike. Here's first study vein, out. Oxford vaccine shown halt transmission well prevent  No. 

At best, say ""we yet confirmed experimentally whether vaccinated people transmit virus"".

There's certainly proof they're 'still highly capable' so, unless studies I'm aware care share?

Based centuries experience vaccination, extremely likely vaccines drastically cut transmission vaccinated hosts, real question big factor is. time give social distancing measures let virus take course. overriding aim must remain cut transmission rates. lower rates, lower probability virus mutating. also imperative public confidence vaccination programmes undermined. Vaccine hesitancy among adults remains issue everywhere. UK, AstraZeneca vaccine mainstay government’s vaccination rollout, experts Monday stressed still likely offer significant protection serious illness South African variant. distribute tasks local cops. They’ll free problem Dude, hyperbole much?

Less effective 'completely ineffective' women often work way harder men lot get done day, already tired run get sick. Therefore takes women longer get well. emergence mutated strains, particularly South African variant concerns effectiveness Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine it, shifted debate straight path might be. question quickly go back normality kind normality be. ever-changing threat virus presents means aspects pandemic life may medium even long term. remaining hopes speedy eradication Covid-19 look fanciful. ""Pain bias: health inequality rarely discussed - BBC Future"" They’re killing plenty people too. SA variant likely become dominant variant everywhere ask might nail coffin Oxford vaccine. must say Russian investigators, despite international scepticism, really fantastic work with, they've responsive, sensitive critiques paper, transparent they've told us safety vaccine."" - Richard Horton, Editor-in-chief Lancet

You're sounding bit anti-science anti-vax there, bucko. I'm sure know better! Big time dumb vibes WA state basically anything indoors except shopping wasn’t allowed, last Monday started allowing indoor activity 25% capacity. Schools still closed. $$$$$$ aren’t even close open. Last call 9 PM now. restrictions aren’t anywhere near California New York definitely aren’t “open.” Religions united this! Rabbi Daniel Asor (Ultra Orthodox) said thing January matters worship Jehova, God Allah - take vaccine avoid COVID, strike gay! 1 log Pfizer results field actually much.

Before result results Novavax J&amp;J variant would've said lab testing fine think actual data required, given size efficacy drops.

It's also really hard tell confidence intervals massive. Oxford confident vaccine still capable preventing death serious illness even new strains. vaccine that, sold cost doesn’t require specialist refrigeration store still useful. 🥅➡️➡️➡️➡️➡️➡️➡️➡️🥅 placebo effect effect telling people receiving treatment. want measure strong effect is, tell people receiving treatment, others not, see what, any, difference is. No. saw tagline immediately dismissed conspiracy theory garbage. particularly care nuanced garbage is. literally heard exact argument. election happened heard says ""it Trump still president."" We're literally doomed. That's I'm figuring too. 2 million/day pretty much gets us 70% fully vaccinated August sometime. 2mil/day right now, last 2 days. See ""Total number COVID-19 vaccinations administered"" page United States. 2.1 million.  Jerusalem Post hates Iran story disguised Iran hates gays story. implication, any, spread reduced vaccines. apparently DAMN good ones!  Moderna always best looking vaccines.

Only since results started coming near end last year. Orders already made prior that. order Pfizer people young healthy like me

AstraZeneca-Oxford still looks like great job preventing serious disease low risk anyway. J&amp;J definition moderate almost completely overlaps AZ definition mild. Amarillo similar system civic center. works great. state made city county governments limited ability create enforce covid restrictions. So, hard tell local governments fall side covid restrictions. Entirely possible mayor want superbowl 1st place mRNA vaccines stringent refrigeration requirements make bit challenging distribute flu vaccine. spikes correlated Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, NYE. data align expected timeframes.


So right. Holiday travel anything it. sub completely gone shit lately. bunch skeptics conspiracy theorists bitching moaning like lockdown protesters summer bitching haircuts. Essentially, spread limited infections reduced severity all? “bucko” mean? Unfortunately window eradicate covid long gone, going human race forever, like flu. aim bring situation dangerous flu! Better Zoom National Popcorn Day ICU Opposite Day! can't believe downvoted like that. made valid point. get copy pandemic prediction calendar? fucking meteorologists city can't even accurately predict snowfall 3 days now. Remindme! 21 days please source this? (limited, possibly wrong) understanding cancer patients may want discuss issue doctors, CDC universally recommend get vaccinated, furthermore increased risk severe complications COVID-19:

[Vaccine Considerations People Underlying Medical Conditions | think possible doctor recommended get vaccine; perhaps history allergic reactions? Thank incredibly thorough response. one things seemed insane read first glance help doubt. Historically assumption simply need study women assumed would react medications health issues like men.

This just... crazy me. course they're going respond differently. least immediate thought had. But... damn, guess way past. even true animal studies, btw - male rats male mice still likely studied female rats &amp; mice.

And damn, makes less sense everything else said far. 

Anyways, thanks info. wonder - I’d like confirmation another source, though true appalling  fun that.  No, doesn’t mean it’s impossible. hasn’t exactly number studies well transmits situations like that, although evidence droplets remain air long enough periods potentially issue. it? Probably major issue, it’s still worth wearing mask case.

If avoid people entirely you’re probably fine, pointing people masking aren’t overly cautious. doctors around recommending. pass even remotely near someone, need mask up, I’m you’re outside public must wear mask. Absolutely! hope EU approves well believe trials still progress yes. possible even beats AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine out, remarkable. Enrico Bucci Russian colleague Vasily Vlasov denies Sputnik V likely effective vaccine. whether really 90 percent safe substance least questionable, according researchers.

Only time tell, I'm optimistic Sputnik V effective criticisms based marginal discrepancies. Also, xenophobic people comments go straight hell. Maybe know something public doesn't? like doctor one first ""given"" shot. farce zooming push rod injection never pushed seemed empty. “They’re protesting want haircuts”

I’m sure nothing losing businesses, nah. located? seems developed nations opportunity everyone get vaccine end 2021. US, could early April. violent protest hotel owners expressing dissatisfaction social media backward way possible beginning summer ""you get vaccine, everyone around also gotten vaccine"" going true. I'll absolutely thrilled reach milestone **end** summer. Ugh last one lol

I mean, “pandemic” kind already implies it’s global close it. word pandemic usually defined epidemic spread multiple continents/distant countries. It’s like calling ATM machine. Hopefully trolling. think expect players literally jump part game, social distance. 

If saying game even played year, that's different argument. criticizing fact bought 100million Oxford/AZ vaccine ofcourse thats logical didn’t buy enough others left UK without options point start vaccinating Oxford/AZ vaccine. Also, using adenovirus second shot bad choice could known. top didn’t add 2p mutation (see: vaccine makers add 2p mutation thats way effective SA strain. dare say anything effectiveness Oxford/AZ vaccine get downvoted angry Brexiteers. seems like Oxford/AZ/UK rushed much deal withy consequences. I'm going assume good person meant first number, second number. Stupidbowl. friends work teaching community turned away stating getting vaccine. group grocery workers high risk positions. It’s probably already here. don’t test doesn’t exist! Right guys?! ...guys? Oh... dead. think 10% point, 15%? Hope feel good after. flu like symptoms first. felt much worse next day. Mega chills body aches. Also thanks much answering this! Hope get soon regardless mean testing positive days receiving second shot time fully protected shot good example... don’t see “learning live virus” indefinite masking distancing. That’s living that
Just isn’t sustainable. Advocating celebrating someone's death illness results ban. Maybe bit rounded really good due different AD vectors. that's fantastic idea. care winter. Blasting music window activity. Oh safe! That's great!

There's one vaccine right?

Strange professional responsible healthcare iran said that. iran joke. Well lockdowns curfews matched largest government handout history. People generally poverty, they're bored. Except small businesses can't get PPP loans whatever. agree impact kids though. lost year social academic lives they'll never get back. measurably worse outcomes ones “smart enough”? also evidence don’t prevent spread. Mask up!

Stay 6 feet apart!

.... worry, socially distanced, wearing masks, outside!

Selfish selfish selfish million 328 million 12%, contributing reduction cases, that's enough drive it

While definitely agree saying overall I'd disagree thay vaccination made difference here. 10% people, theory greatest risk, taken pool definitely makes impact. 10% paycheck gone would reduce buying power? Definitely. 

We can't go quick victory lap anything think appreciate small wins 10% population vaccinated ~year popped US one imo. 7-day rolling still 1.4, yeah, hopefully gets last couple days fluke. Average age 31 believe.  seems real difference vaccinated group control group.  one died hospitalised that's expected given age. NY got hit early even knew bad could get. Florida advance warnings still chose Florida. So, comment far removed reality. One shot vaccines game changers, especially rural area developing countries.

If remember correctly, J&amp;J also 66% preventing symptomatic illness. Advocating celebrating someone's death illness results ban. I've seen 1.5x 1.7x UK variant.

I seen anything SA/Brazil variant, understanding concern infective, antibodies/vaccines might less effective it, think current science showing vaccines less effective preventing symptomatic cases, still effective preventing hospitalizations deaths. Although seen confidence intervals, might talking 4 vs. 0 something like that. I’ve said I’ll say again: good luck getting people follow vaccines become widely available (people barely follow rules now). economy can’t take much this. Mental health can’t take much this. point it’s time move on.

This shouldn’t surprising COVID stay. don’t know idea eradication came that’s never narrative least. say articles like is, bottom genuine heart, “No. Fucking. Shit. Sherlock.” videos called 'outdoor' dining NYC make mockery policy. 

Recent video called 'outdoor' dining: Avoid topic political comments. Super Bowl party gathering much different Thanksgiving Christmas gatherings..?

A super bowl party, especially year, far less common Thanksgiving gatherings. know lot people invite elderly grandparents Super Bowl (not saying happen though). You’d think so, I’m 2 weeks second shot still get heebees see crowd somebody gets close grocery store. Oddly, place feel better work, taking care Covid patients. even read article calling lie? Jesus Christ, lazy 60 percent Israel’s population received least one shot, confers partial immunity, slightly half received second shot full vaccination. Among people vaccinated, COVID-19 cases hospitalizations fallen dramatically, according Ministry Health.

Per article. know, that's true. Dr. Laura Makaroff American Cancer Society [in far safety vaccine, every situation every patient cancer little different. there's spectrum anyone patient might cancer journey,"" Makaroff told CNN. ""The COVID-19 vaccine definitely safe people cancer important patients conversation healthcare provider cancer care team determine right time vaccine.""  guidance we're seeing — American Cancer Society leading oncology groups — COVID-19 immunization recommended patients active therapy, really understand limited safety efficacy data patients,"" Makaroff said.  limited data, many cancer experts, medical groups, doctors making big push vaccinating cancer patients — especially cancer patients [most risk  potential benefits far outweigh risks,"" said Dr. Brian Koffman, chief medical officer Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Society, group represents patients common adult form leukemia western world.

Of course, can't speak whether Rep. Ron Wright got vaccine many doses when. vaccine generally considered safe cancer patients. Ok. So, first all, nowhere cited say United States send vaccines countries instead vaccinating citizens. also mention word ""efficiency"" anything similar cited either. putting words mouth, also arguing article says something not. fact, thing citation says give NGOs money, fact, new COVID relief bill does.

I'll take lack answer mean article suggest U.S. sending vaccines countries instead vaccinating citizens efficient way pandemic.

Have good one. point think cases/ hospitalizations need get us loosen restrictions social activities? would assume goal post hospitalizations cases strict restrictions remain place Well someone mandate enforce it, would followed. one business complied another next door didn't, would incentive disregard rules stay business. ever get vaccine? :/ Oh could done along. road one had. Last year felt certain would vaccine would save us. Yet said done, Moderna, Pfizer, J&amp;J going ones end this. long takes anywhere else I’ll take Mask casket, still people can't go weeks without Applebees, Flatten curve, Variants,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure million ones really jump mind. makes perfect sense now.

Thanks clarifying. 72% Americans continue wear masks f*ck right Although prefer cow toe use forever, FYI it’s kowtow. fuck expect Yes understanding isn’t much evidence virus spread outdoors. get city people shoulder shoulder, I’m talking single-family homes you’re walking sidewalk rarely pass someone, step opposite side sidewalk easily 10 ft apart. 

I lean precaution better, don’t wear mask walk around neighborhood. also go way make sure I’m near anyone. light train coming last point one also wondering about. risk highly concentrated small % population, 80-90% fatalities 15% population. everyone told thing. people affected lockdowns (young healthy) risk (elderly health conditions).

The original ""lock weeks flatten curve"" became ""indefinite lockdowns end wear mask literally killing people"". message goal changed people bought wrong reasons. citing single controlled study grounds herd-immunity via infection working, seen Sweden work. gambled steadily directly infecting population failed drastically. 

What difficult us understanding population dynamics novel coronavirus insist new findings mean anything relevant context herd immunity? never mentioned politicians post.

I idea think matters now. Donald Trump president ""they"" was... Donald Trump. hell people talking about? doesn't. literally says ""any *one* of"" mild ""one more"" moderate severe. Found in-laws got first shots last week. let breath realized I'd holding. They're deniers, ""not gonna stop living life"" types refused take common sense precautions like, know, wearing mask inside grocery store. I'm shocked catch time. Thats definetly fair Ni hao ma? Stay fuck home, surge cases, spike cases. Good find, thanks! Sputnik 91%, agree CDC/NIH/HHS PSAs. reddit (at least mobile), I'm assuming elsewhere too!

Ya know, like actual somewhat competent federal response. least glimmer it. scary thought yesterday could mutation spread easier/affected kids more. sure likely possible is, can’t help thinking worst case scenarios. That's law state years. like want people dead.... whatever, done religious extremists. want potentially life saving vaccines, that's them. Maybe finally start getting rid whack jobs. Let kill off, I'm absolutely done. thing is, even 65% vaccines still prevent 100% severe illnesses. 

I already extremely low risk serious illness. problem even mild illness long term negative effects.  Host virtual get-together

Keep safe distance 

Flatten curve

New normal

Semblance normal key thing. wide confidence interval, means nothing. True, point red neck states ones smart enough limit people’s desires based science. definitely doctors backward-ass ideas women's health, think case wanting speculate much without hard evidence. 

It's easy suggest reasonable hypothesis like gender differences immune responses, indeed doctor article mentions Doctors aren’t sure may difference virus plays long run men women. One possibility may fundamental differences immune system, Hurt said.

But professionals lot cagier claiming know causes things; reasonable hypothesis still say they're ""not sure"". might perfectly capable logic reason, lot share reasoning someone released study back up. 45% deaths nursing homes 2020. states completed vaccinations nursing homes now. evidence vaccines effective even infirm? vaccine effective elderly infirm vaccine trial population see almost 0 nursing home deaths late Jan going forward. Absolutely terrible equally terrible thing Manaus' second wave city estimated reached 76% populace past infections. concern variant Manaus could resulting reinfections. awful honestly, need vaccines obtain herd immunity instead turning communities massive mutation pressure cookers.  praising him?

Yeah, Americans anything temporarily inconveniences them. 400k+ dead haircut demand one? Many choose haircut.

Time time again, reminded this. Exactly. People seem understand many hospitalized die still end permanent brain, lung heart damage. need everything stamp virus out, make epidemic ""only"" permanently disables instead killing you. Sure maybe accurate death counts people know much virus. even generous said China double deaths, still $10k margin error compared US's $450k. ""Imagine room 100 people it, 46 immune. virus still going try infect 54 people. long enough vulnerable people remain, virus continue on.

Vaccination recovery give people immunity, mostly changes gets infected, many.""

Except 46 people immune, 100 people would get it, case numbers would drop regardless herd immunity.

Regardless, answer somewhere middle. Rt *does* decrease people immune even herd immunity threshold. logistic curve. Herd immunity threshold Rt &lt; 1 thus pandemic burn out. herd immunity 75%, 70% immunity still massively decrease Rt thus case numbers.  Biontech partnered Fosun Pharma Shanghai Pfizer US back March. Fosun already paid 100 million doses. Yes, large difference J&amp;J AZ seems illogical We're saying amount immunity possessed population, plus vaccine deployment, impact plummeting COVID rates

Who saying that? Where's data? trying pass feelings data. science. Show serology data shows greater 60-75% population immunity needed herd immunity effects begin take place. 66% enough Manaus Brazil prevent another surge. data shows high levels immunity model, please present data I'll change mind. But, right now, much logical explanation reductions mobility. 

Hell, even use California example. California hard hit third wave. Herd immunity would allow immediate surge change mobility. But, guess happened? Christmas New Years contributed two peaks cases began drop, despite downward trend before. Washington State Oregon, thing happened. directly shows herd immunity effects mobility changes. That's science.  **Pam meme* they're picture titling information: “Nursing home outbreak vaccination; mild symptoms observed.”

Being sensationalist one service long run. too. much. February always bad month depression me, I'm struggling. right you. Don’t let sub tell it’s ok get friggin’ “mild covid” instead waiting bit. 

I know picture looks different countries, I’m sorry it’s going take longer get excellent vaccines everywhere world need be, simply isn’t case America young healthy people already low risk bad outcome need take mediocre shot ASAP. 

We wait.  Putting people risk? i’ve barely left home since March double masking since April - dare you. 

So insane way they’ve stopped using one vaccines already SA. feel bad people SA stuck ineffective vaccine dominant variant (like likely become UK.) Apples oranges. UK presently fairly hard lockdown, one SA lifting.

Meanwhile, states US even stay home order effect, Superbowl weekend. 1.) influenza sars completely different viruses. 2.) yes spread MORE, asymptomatic people still spread shit ton. meant impossible 100% know covid19. havent lockdowns. Certainly I'm South. 

And reason it'd different actually give vaccines. 

Combining two weeks true lockdown, appropriate relief check Americans, plus vaccines we'd roll time frame, yes, would totally ""work"" would accelerate recovery. 

Of course it'll never happen. dread waking news one day new variant evading vaccines, find set back months year. Wow, that’s disappointing. Basically friends work hospitals already gotten doses, don’t think work directly covid patients moment. Seasonality. lot people? Yes. hard cutoff much life willing give up. Why? would lab testing counts. 

It's real world testing.

We already see results Israel match Pfizer's trials. They're finding 95% effectiveness, Israel SA variant yet.

Basically new variants significantly different original, need new trial. Otherwise data show efficacy new variants could spending money something work. Pfizer expensive - suspicious $hills saying, ""No need new trial, trust hand dollars"" Didn’t say always meant going useless mutated strains like SA strain. Obviously 76-82% effective original strain turns good great start want effective mutated strains. Could worded bit different make clear. gross lack transparency, said. Scientists, including Russia, according Bucci, would still access raw vaccine development data. response, would received ""security department"" examine requests. Russian medical experts also confirmed SPIEGEL. behavior part state Gamaleja Research Center Epidemiology Microbiology Moscow ""The Lancet"" ""outrageous,"" Bucci said.

Four deaths reported far result Sputnik vaccination, said. Details circumstances, however, available two people, said.

There inconsistencies number subjects, said: Two numbers given ""Lancet"" article: one point, 21,977 study participants; another point, 21,862 participants listed again.

Questions arose calculating efficacy: example, 15 percent participants placebo group would formed antibodies day 42. likely, would become infected time asymptomatic course Covid-19. unclear whether factored calculations.

It also unclear number subjects ""vaccination group"" much higher interim studies final report ""The Lancet.""

In ""Lancet"" report, also discrepancies numbers participants infected Covid-19 despite Sputnik vaccination: according ""findings"" study, 16 around 15,000 test persons infected 21 days, whereas elsewhere paper suddenly 61 Covid cases group day 20.

See redundancy? think better assume vaccine prevents spread. vaccine history prevent vaccinated individual spreading virus? I'm gonna completely honest, I've read comment like 3 4 times idea means. Double secret mega gay, turn cross Elton John David Bowie. Hey, doom gloom. far I'm concerned, 2 weeks final vaccine dose, go whatever want, careful frequent contact someone immunocompromised. can't wait go Cedar Point again, hope safely June July. Can't wait stupid people call sexist. people call sexist, know why, will. agree conversation (although we’ve conversation pretty much constantly since first lockdown) whole point lockdowns, masks, distancing keep hospitals getting overwhelmed, right?

That point vaccine. vaccine, narrative “everyone eventually get let’s prevent hospitals overrun” legit. postpone Covid deaths saves lives keeping ICUs open.

Now vaccine, every day delay saves lives period. delays months. point disagree “the whole point keep hospitals getting overwhelmed”. whole point save lives. 

The conversation risk population vaccinated (soon) start balance relatively low risk death economic impact

(That discussion premature prior vaccine potential death toll among risk populations way high) guys holed house last year without leaving once? Sounds like pretty good time. national guard pricey. think free get gunned days? sheesh Please. Even circulating antibodies begin wane subjects infected, still retain robust T-cell responses bodies encounter pathogen again. SIREN study published last month could study five months post infection virus still novel us. Less 1% participants contracted repeat infections, subset 30% reported discernible symptoms. question always full restaurants actually even come close buildings capacity limit? don’t think would, would anything need change make sure 50%? dumb misinformed lol totally right, I'm tired logic. either work don't. think people want tanks patrolling streets people remain inside 24x7. variants? Thank you! sarcastic, would put /s like everyone else does.

Also im already clapping back militant anti vax vegan another subreddit attention kinda divided _only_ reason using vaccine passports travel. unified validated system making harder travel eventually. think post lockdown infections. School closures? No, favor point.

Schools never closed weeks. fact schools still closed almost year later reprehensible. Yeah see that. Texas people begrudgingly wear wear required. Costco might place stick around long time. first half,not gonna lie, got hook, line, sinker. Desiring things isn’t “red neck” it’s entirely normal part life vast majority people. went ER weeks ago three nurses asked said chose get vaccine. stopped going PT 5 healthcare workers turned vaccine, asked orthopedic doctor, admitted turned down, along nurse. Personally, don’t know single healthcare worker gotten vaccine. necessarily true. 10 percent population completely negligible. Also at-risk active front-line workers get it. impact random 10 percent population. opinion thread much optimistic many healthcare experts. honestly beautiful people. Syrian war started would scan FaceBook look profiles people part world people looked like models. convinced average people lol. No. don’t know antibodies prevent spreading viral load. Unless missed recent study, never confirmed. Yet something many continue repeat. 

So again: fact recovered vaccinated doesn’t mean won’t get others sick. Governments never much power 

This thing baffles most. would want governor full control stays open stays closed?

My fear whenever new virus hits, repeat lockdown measures again. That's course unless pass laws prevent this. American logic finest. would wear mask, even two, home alone?

If stay home, social distance, mask make difference. simple science. limits far virus needed viral load infect, travel. 

That Americans insist masks part every equation clear sign unhealthy obsession. people without covid spread covid Yep. makes remember huge fucking mistake blaming Enron Davis Yeah oversensitivity PCR tests part reason mess Illinois, Michigan, Oregon, New Mexico, spots pretty serious lock downs. Thanks explanation. hope keep getting better anyone read article anymore? spelled clearly, read it. Republicans upon hearing news: Thoughts Prayers. really think suitable word. We're turning point pandemic, pretty huge moment. Well also I’d like point lab testing Novavax’s vaccine didn’t produce level immune response Pfizer Moderna lab testing 

Im saying it’s 95% effective. Likely erosion. previous test, Pfizer found one dose vaccine suffered 10 fold decrease immune response SA variant people 80, even neutralizing antibody levels still range would offer protection. one dose much limited protection subset population much weaker immune response 

This study found immune response doses similar effectiveness UK variant turn similar wild type. It’s probably 90+%, could definitely see protection symptomatic infection somewhere 70+ range Agreed. I've following rules since March/April (can't remember NY put mask mandate effect). Getting 2nd vaccine dose week. I'm happy wait vaccines available anyone wants (so likely early mid-summer). I'm done masks distancing. exception might masks required awhile large events, planes etc... I'm willing put get concerts, sports events, travel etc. back bit longer, even kind time limit. wouldn’t trust guy. switched forecasting ‘nowcasting’ abruptly months ago ‘too busy.’ Really, consistently wrong background epidemiology. check ensemble models now: Bravo clapping back, beautifully handled Pride season huge year!!! It’s thought will, extent still unknown. Mostly metal fuck hardcore punk. Nah. republicans pushing trying divide dems. recall benefits anyone gop guess agree men prioritized vaccine. course always going order AZ vaccines? made UK makes sense supply perspective. reason they've ordered load Valneva vaccines production plant Livingstone. lot orders also placed trial data actually made available, get around supply issues forseen, whole 62% efficacy really perspective could take.

Nobody could predicted specifically AZ vaccine would susceptible particular variation SA, UK vaccination program started SA varient talked bar scientific circles, evidence higher vaccine resistance talked January.

These decisions made like months ago, back autumn 2020, also Moderna (actually 17m doses 6), Novovax, Pzifer UK vacinate entire adult population more. That's even counting AZ come booster shot (the feasibility know aspersions cast upon it).

I comfortable telling UK horrific response pandemic, locking far late ignoring science cause want piss anyone off, certainly fucked vaccination program, even they, rightly, reconsider sensibility continuing AZ main current vaccine 2021. Well given even agreed antibodies dominant form protection example T-cells processes (which measured) may form dominant form protection.

Neutralising titers =/= efficacy. test many times like, could 100 times still would replace efficacy trial, do, otherwise evidence limited best. go goalposts again. getting ridiculous. I’ve probably one cautious people knew throughout whole thing. haven’t perfect made conscious decisions things zero risk part I’ve following guidelines especially comes parents older/at risk people. haven’t seen parents inside let alone hugged almost year even though live 20 minutes apart. best believe I’ll giving hug relaxing precautions couple weeks passed since 2nd doses, agree. It’s absolutely worth minuscule risk us. 

How long expect us live like hermits? Even introverted people limits much isolation take. Covid isn’t going disappear time soon keep acting like “hang on” little longer lie. Yes variants concern boosters deal soon.

It basically one key mutation concern

And no, shouldn’t throw efficacy trials bin. case it’s necessary

You think AZ would conducted trial they’re lab testing didn’t show much reduced efficacy SA variant also depends state, sometimes city. Anchorage, AK, can’t go anywhere without mask (if it’s open begin with). Utah, pretty much whatever want without mask. work it’s required wear mask, Walmart nearby says it’s recommended customers (where almost one wears mask anyway). Guess got COVID? reinfection 6 months

Latest peer reviewed paper says least 8 months. “At least” still haven’t found threshold. Right, monitor infections spread, right? 

Again, that's determines herd immunity. variants worried hey

That isn’t new  Lmao dude, we’re really splitting hairs here. 90+ versus 95, results Israel aren’t even final, could certainly 95%.

This dumb conversation I’m done  thing is, even 65% vaccines still prevent 100% severe illnesses. 65% one, still 35% chance getting mild symptoms, - mild. 95+% efficacy vaccines, 5% people those, get mild symptoms. 65% efficacy mean 35% chance falling seriously ill, still lots protection it. remind election isn’t march 4th, inauguration day originally established constitution. vaccines nothing stop spread virus, induce herd immunity. Eventually would reach (or something similar called endemic equilibrium) infection alone.

It is, however, unlikely vaccines effect spread Possible new source renewable energy? see Olive Garden assume I’ve lost sense taste covid secretly?

Well, fair, whether visit them, whether allowed local ordinance visit them, whether safe different questions. definitely something getting overlooked. donate blood red cross, they're still testing antibodies, quick way get test (also, consider donating possible major shortage blood donations US right now. That's unfortunately one main reasons they're testing antibodies still- try get people donate). I’m surprised aldi’s haven’t suspiciously burned. concerned global availability, would make sense double J&amp;J then? seems like licensing/producing would much prudent move. Except said still know bits immune response (of lots still unknown anyway) important, know measuring right thing. that's invented things called RCTs efficacy trials.

If said remotely true could throw efficacy trials bin.

This new variant behaves substantially differently shown reduced efficacy every vaccine put efficacy trial. cannot simply use lab tests say eh fine. need actual efficacy data convincing. moderna vaccine 95% effective preventing cases coronavirus. 

this results showed fwiw. common misunderstand though. That's probably due lack tourism lack employees offices. would assume large majority offices still wfh possible. factors hurting local business like restaurants, despite open.

Most stuff allowed open capacity. demand there. Took long enough drive vaccination sites? Seems like simpler way spread people around large metro areas. getting NFL stadium pain ass. goal stop rise new variants, vaccine 10% efficacy simply slow transmission sufficiently. better, should. documented average r0 different variants? happen homosexual already? make become heterosexual? down? Understood! apologies, sometimes come daily thread vent really productive lol crazy seeing play real life officials going try keep restrictions place even vaccinations

Restrictions lifting across country. furthermore, never restricted seeing mother. b.c wanted safe. 

We went visit parents. self isolated 10 days, got covid test went visit. True -- many us living suburban areas hop cars drive CVS/Walgreens choice.

However living dense urban/inner city areas (also location many stadiums ballparks) may easier access stadium-- either pure proximity walking, public transportation special stadium routes capacity game day.

Also remember stadiums designed get people door, location (their seat, concession stand, restroom) certain degree efficiency little creative engineering, might great idea. Reddit like comment. headline made feel better comment brought reality back like it. certainly hope I'm wrong cases going up. restrictions support ones involves protecting vulnerable. data I’ve seen, social distancing, buisness school closures, masks helped us all, they’re harmful way live. let people willing stay work city avoid traveling. Cos women go Dr. question got answered different article: Wright received vaccination, unlike many House members. people Overweight actions. talking disabilities within context people cannot help it. 

Not sure would voted that. calling thing. people overweight probably could something thing don’t know looking feel professors business people lecture want morality it’s hollow.

Which decided get vaccinated pass vaccine vulnerable member family?

It’s easy lecture everyone else safe. think it'll definitely start driving depths soon given highly targeted efforts risk. Hah. I’d increased timeline bit, challenge accepted. Note left room plateau and/or moderate spike. get another letter like L B Q. one step closer Bingo! important point, supported trump voted impeachment. Also voted suppress legal votes. Wear mask, Stay alive. really. need eliminate Covid, SA variant going issue. One reason coins prioritized vaccination elderly. Israeli vaccinated pool age bias towards older side, whereas trials not. [Check gnarly live rural PA, may something it. happened Australia then? Lmao literally couple comments link article stating Israel found Pfizer vaccine 90+% effective practice two doses 

SA variant barley different well. one key different mutation, mainly forget Tampa, Florida, entered chat yesterday. (Super Bowl). Everyone heading home now. 😬 mean... you’re right. idea you’re getting downvoted. Super Bowl party gathering much different Thanksgiving Christmas gatherings..? would really odd vaccine effective preventing symptomatic serious illness, like Pfizer Moderna, also put huge dent transmission. (J&amp;J too).

If vaccines theoretically didn’t prevent transmission all, it’s unlikely virus would go inside vaccinated people mutate. Since vaccines produce pretty good immune response, limit symptomatic disease, hosts’ viral loads would presumably lower would long contagious period. would limit replication spreading virus, taking away chances mutate. ... what. starting think virus totally cured way sooner think. news coming Israel cured 29 30 hospitalized patients using technology protein called CD24. story. remember trembled 40 cases city promised 5G DEMAND 5G. Giving money countries solve anything. bid us drive prices like PPE last year. ones benefit pharmaceutical companies. Production needs increase IMO money spend helping countries focused producing vaccines US. way money spent creating jobs India Russia war? war vs people misinformed willing get federal charges cause talking orange told em thing? don’t know I’ve COVID (I probably could symptoms very, mild never got tested), period last month basically didn’t come. light took pregnancy test make sure. month heavier normal. Makes wonder, least. cutouts well pitch along we'd vaccine year so. We're fortunate live hypothetical. God, miss socializing much. miss sports concerts. also miss able go week without incapacitating inflammation across body. miss family friends died.  


But agree people breaking point. feel myself. hope find way make bit further. So, B.1.1.7 represents 6% Germany, 14% France, 40% Portugal 60% Netherlands, probably Ireland. despite overall cases going due lockdowns. Since tests don’t always catch variants cases go down. point think people would realize jigs considering guy passed. hand, staffers fqmily Herman Cain tweeting months died. wow p So, lost sense smell together covid back november. Thankfully I've regained it. However, never completely lost sense taste, get sort distorted. still is. taste things, weird tastes. can't really describe them, they're strange. Anyone else experience? drivel? nonsense. Allah creator everything existence... sounds like cool scenario. original reply response people going hog-wild thinking 100% immune unable hurt others. anyone else experienced persistent bloody mucus nose throat recovering COVID-19? It’s month half since recovered, likely longer since time tested longer contagious, yet still blowing nose coughing bloody mucus constantly. trying figure sort new long term effect chock weather. Variant ain’t gonna shit. vaccinated mean can't spread it. wont able go catch it, still give unvaccinated people, that's herd immunity works anti-vaxxers dangerous. Lmfao Realistically exit lockdown end April. Anyone thoughts article saw vast majority infections asymptomatic people getting tested.

The vast majority infections asymptomatic. vast majority symptomatic. end result would lot closer herd immunity think are?

We're near herd immunity. months vaccination getting assuming widespread SA, Brazilian, novel Kent variant spread. though. parents getting 2 weeks. Kinda nervous well. overweight hypertension. IMO ""back normal"" happens people decide they're willing take risk possibly catching COVID exchange living life.

Lockdowns long terms distancing healthy people showing symptoms never consideration preventing disease spread prior 2020. China instituted lockdowns, world collective panic attack, 11 months later people still afraid living life normally someone *might* sick *might* spread virus IFR 1%.

We've got vaccine. Cases deaths decline. 11 months. time get back normalcy **now.** influenza sars completely different viruses nunce. whole issue can't know sick not. point, found vial ground marked Pfizer, I'd probably pay back alley junkie inject off-chance vaccine fell back truck. true. Please let dentist know don’t want worked unvaccinated people. would love get rid idiots field.  Nah, Dems victims. Blaming everyone else problems articles clearly state opposite ""even get vaccinated stay lockdown"" claim. One even says life largely back normal. often quoted makes sense argument. reduced number deaths US COVID 80%, would order magnitude larger recent flu year (for wear masks), probably two orders magnitude larger flu deaths year.

There certainly reasons fair comparison one probably conclude comparing COVID influenza something done. going it, need actually it. trying sneak fake comparison push agenda ain't right. Looking way due undeclared incentives? Except money. upper middle class residents poking paid enough income tax California year turn projected $50B shortfall $70B surplus. god no!! please please please remember vaccinated mean spread others. can't catch it, still 'shed' onto people. Oh sorry hear that. kids elementary. Agreed. BioNTech said thing asked comment news. don’t wear masks? Nah, I'd say that's easily sensible group. I'll definitely end group B summer. Group get vaccinated, since I'm 22... unfortunately long time now. wash fruit general life advice, there's reason wash specifically COVID. -18F wind chill cutoff district

Cases coming down. propaganda little office. yikes sure would great would find statistics common condition is, besides citing number people Facebook group. vaccinated mean can't spread it. can't catch it, still 'shed' others. please careful. think there's better even chance we'll spikes larger record far new UK variant becomes dominant.

Time tell, hope right. arggh stop like facts. live love girls state one first lockdown last March. vast majority drop cases due mobility changes. say every single time deniers.

Cases explode, people stop mixing, cases go down, claim oh must herd immunity.

EVERY SINGLE TIME.

Look comments thread, shit ther eplies you, denial, every single time. Absolutely not. employment vaccine level number infected people. attribute vaccine anymore could people already infected.

The **biggest** players decline due season precautions. spike mainly due holiday seasonal spike people taking precautions sustainable increase rate. bound experience decrease sometime month two holiday season. warming weather many areas top also lead masks social distancing regaining full effectiveness.

Don't expect anything noticeable 50% vaccination rate expect completion 97% vaccination rate. Things always tradeoff.

I'd like point widespread, out-of-control illness carry sorts economic social costs compared lower-level spread. People never seem take account. UK, Florist, dropped high school

To say I'm stunned would understatement haha. I'm finding hard believe. Sharing profession/field internet harmless haha. guess gotta take word haha.

Why feeling like could ask anything regarding topic coronavirus vaccines hahaha?

Where interest vaccines science come go informing particularly Americans spoiled high efficacy mRNA candidates

Yeah, Novavax *the* highest efficacy 95.6%, original variant, that's data Pfizer well, that's fairest way comparing them. tech also weird interesting. First time heard subunit nanoparticles, although fair me, started caring vaccines recently vivo sera studies w single engineered mutations, ignores interactions can't capture complexities real life trials, proper comparison.

It's *in vitro*, no? So, topic, aware *in vitro* binding studies like vaccines official efficacy data too? ask would helpful perhaps extrapolating antibody binding data real-world efficacy would least give us sense two interesting thing I'm looking data heterologous prime-boost

My second question possible downsides combining two vaccines any. immunological point view, issue combining two vaccines. vaccines simply expose antigen. different ways, exposed different way first time around get booster shot using different vaccine negative implications second vaccine's ability produce antigen cells (if DNA RNA vaccine).

Of course, able predict efficacy, would perfectly safe assume efficacy would high would ZERO safety concerns, *in* *my* *opinion*. Simply knowing number efficacy would inconvenient, imagine cool thriller-movie situation one choice booster shot different vaccine, *personally* would ZERO concerns would enthusiastic taking expert ))

Haha sure. really stoked immunology, like lol. really wish expert. Imma become one. I'm reading papers field vaccinology general focusing mRNA viral vector platforms. Lots fun. Hanging eating pancakes home read article discussed mask use pandemic? hotline? Yeah, help

I've 10 years, unless hotline send wife, no, help. insurance here.             
No cap pocket, see option get one. terrible insurance. designed insurance company though, something employers union.  *waits two weeks superbowl celebrate news* acknowledged it’s certainly contributing decrease cases there. two countries? Drop deaths, maybe. But, we're seeing massive drop deaths. I've pointed elsewhere, article referring single day deaths. overall 7 day rolling average remains high.  terms cases, no, way early see effects vaccine number cases cases coming got numbers vaccines up. mobility changes, immunity, largest effect cases. anti vac person think dangerous allow oversight someone free say opinions clearly filtering. Like big tech companies hiding things best filter content push agenda. Yea forget facts, hurt peoples feelings. 450,000 people fucking dead care rollercoasters? actual fuck wrong people? isnt over, wont (this wont help!!). viruses give shit bored staying inside wearing masks. you. going 2 weeks, 2 weeks Christmas.

I'll admit went in-law's house xmas dad's house day (I've already covid) went nowhere NY eve. I'm sure lot people same. There's pressure visit extended family Christmas stuff NYE. millions upon millions doses AZ sitting around might well use though. It’s still net positive get people’s arms. Don’t forget k-12 students. Long term educational damage done here. Working public health, something really hit past year people super intelligent one field complete moron others. 

You good healthcare worker absolutely idiot comes public health guidance recommendations things like COVID. 

I've witnessed nurses urgent care centers tell overcounting cases test people 24/7. “Former British Colonies”

LOL. Enough said. think helped leadership actively undermining public health experts literal months. trust eroded long time ago. know recover this.  UK lockdown since Christmas.

Oh wonder going down?

Better add deniers arguments nothing. curious. anecdotal data (reports nurses) London patients arriving younger sicker, staying longer.

I think would help greatly data, finest granularity consistent anonymity, made publicly available central place. data scientists could pore look trends. going thru removing opinions information someone deems facts reminds here. post think something get butt hurt say. FB hope dies horrible death soon... tired Social Media thinking know whats best everyone entitled read/say. eat crow positive results increase 7 days? 

Remindme! 6 days don’t think AZ refusing make Novavax though. Novavax formula even shared? 

All companies working alone order protect profits interests. whole thing case everyone pooling research dedicating resources towards making whichever vaccines prove best - isn’t works though. apologies. would assume typical reddit speaking negatively Florida's covid response lol here. lost last semester senior year college graduation thought awful. I'm seeing kids lost almost half time college. feel bad them...  actual evidence back claim? comment masks, taken aback comemnt. I'm sorry able communicate better. Best luck. worried reinfection? friend going tough time I'm thinking offering couch sleep months. got Coronavirus month ago, works high risk job. I'm worried getting reinfected spreading let live me. I'm reading conflicting reports, anyone know likely reinfection is? I'm American I've living Germany little now, weird watching American response mask thing. Like, see lots people refusing wear mask ever, people completely lose minds someone wearing mask ALONE OUTISDE public park. I'm starting see people Facebook Twitter posting selfies wearing masks hiking alone middle nowhere, like kind political statement...

Like, hard controversial... closed space people, wear mask. not, don't. seems pretty easy most* people handle here, sure wrong people back home... Ugh. Massachusetts really needs start going vaccine supply quickly. According Bloomberg's tracker, we've barely used half doses sent state, making us one slowest entire country, Charlie Baker keeps telling people ""wait little longer."" maddening. One vaccines made here, rolling slowly deep south.

I'd love see dramatic acceleration Massachusetts' vaccine plan think we're stuck one slower states union, think acceleration incidental country's vaccination acceleration efforts whole. Google find rest. remains consistently pessimistic even vaccine rolls out.

[Fauci: Getting Vaccinated ‘Not Free Pass’ Fauci says it’s important wear mask even getting Covid US vaccinate 85% adults begin return normal fall, Fauci basically explained outdoor dining different ""tier"" other, risky activities, still guidelines even outdoor dining open.

Which make sense. problem? want go depth covid public health response, highly recommend podcast episode National Review:

[Special Episode: Dr. Scott scared right-leaning web site...this episode virtually politics free...in fact lot talk how/where Trump admin response went wrong.

Scott Gottlieb former FDA commissioner current Pfizer board member. He's interviewed practically every week Face Nation pandemic. 

Because FDA/Pfizer connections lot inside information vaccine inventory earlier, initial rollout / distribution went wrong, etc.

If want go beyond 5-minute media sound bites really great place it. feel EXACTLY way; alone. &lt;3 saying? wasn’t scarcity toilet paper? true article advocates using hair dryer add ""charge"" back masks disinfecting hot water.  would think clothes dryer would add ""charge"" back providing didnt use dryer sheet (which would opposite effect) People attended superbowl parties: ""Hold beer"" Theres thing called allies. America (and Americans) seem forget world exists outside US allies helped past. Canada followed US wars want Canadians die result. I'm saying US prioritize Canada way fact US 20x doses sitting storage yet used Canada received total. could send small fraction north would 0 impact rollout states struggling administer fast enough is. cases went way January - told opposite would happen.

No offense, keep daily happenings Idaho... grand scheme what's occurring US, Idaho blip. models experts say going happen next month month after? Cases explode increased mobility spring, right?

If mobility increases back pre-surge baseline, seeding period lasts months (small wave) followed large wave. trust data experts, I'm skeptical interpreting data believe figured every aspect COVID past present nothing left learn, data fully perfectly replicates everything happened, one possible explanation observed phenomenon. point yet, believe credible experts understand tend speak guarded, qualified terms.

Then want believe theory herd immunity somehow achieved there's reliable expert data suggests we've reached herd immunity? people clamoring herd immunity people claimed certain states like New York countries like Sweden achieved herd immunity back May June, respectively. much. We'll also see cases deaths per case naturally decline holidays weather turning around warmer.

Those actually going largest contributing factors initially. see effects vaccine substantial numbers immunized. Something like 2 3 times least, 50% population. ~~joke~~ prudent decision benefit health general population.

Why yes, good sir concur yes, agree would counter saying long-lasting effects Covid also become apparent time. me, problems we're discussing massive institutional failures things average person trying do. think government taken care us properly that's maddening.  vote stimulus? think sort people feel way settled daily thread. rest sub still lot doom gloom (though getting better) I've found subs dedicated COVID, vaccines, lockdowns get wacky hurry either anti-vaxxer stuff, COVID denialism, lockdown forever types, blind undying fealty #teamred #teamblue... daily threads best I've found grounded, optimistic (while also realistic) discussion. province happen 16th, smaller regions opening sooner, Toronto, York Peel opening 22nd. 

All zones except grey allow level indoor dining, bars, gyms, etc. Grey allow non-essential retail remain open. rest world adapt CCP corruption letting world know COVID-19 extent beginning — i’m supposed happy guy blasting song stuck 2012 Russian girl pretending mixing... no-one except two dancing... I'm hoping whatever expansions production pharmaceutical companies implementing employed quickly mass production booster shots variants. believe companies already developing booster shot South African variant. think deaths drop 500 daily, open everything. New motherfucking normal tippity top hated phrases list. Besides that:

Hang little longer.

Long-haul. vaccinations poised become available general public south border soon within 8 weeks...yeah shit soon. Nope, NY late react compared states sent patients back retirement homes appropriately reflect poorly mortality data. original ""lock weeks flatten curve"" became ""indefinite lockdowns end wear mask literally killing people"". message goal changed people bought wrong reasons.

100%. messaging horrible throughout this. extended first lockdown 30 days social media campaigns started, saw writing wall. response simply blown WAY proportion Ianal believe HIPAA applies medical providers people access medial records, random people asking it. want ask medical provider personally, see issue that. could also cancer killed him... heard terminal cancer quite deadly. 26 minute delay fetching comments.

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide However, open let covid widely circulate, possible immune vaccine escape new variant, repeat overrun hospitals, mass deaths, yes lockdowns.

It necessarily case evolving covid becomes harmless common cold. could remain as, become even more, lethal now. Manaus shows future could be.

Meanwhile covid zero countries, safe travel bubbles, look horror. Peak virtue signalling. ""Surge"" ""Foreseeable Future"" phrases added list.

And forget ""Alone Together"" ""New Normal"" ""Uncertain Times"" ""These times"" is...a really interesting take. Obviously knew “clickbait” thing, hadn’t made connection media became “free” (I’m 35, right generational cusp print news people buy transitioned online news, since quite young still mostly print media, hadn’t actually seen difference tone delivery). Makes sense though...and you’re right, don’t know solution either. know it’s tempting go censorship route, whole Covid crisis demonstrated problem that: whatever “side” biggest tech simply “owns narrative” actively CREATE whatever reality want (news sources pushing agenda “fact-checking” labeling ANYthing don’t want “misinformation” would honestly hilarious wasn’t disturbing). best recourse paradoxically seems throw proverbial doors open, give people information have, let make minds. Chaotic obviously, alternative true dystopian-level control everyone few. Karen. Also remember people beach called bioterrorists? I'm wrong. studies / meta analyses effectiveness masks He's missing ""symptomatic"" confidence interval.

I think accurate enough layman's speak. personal guess - someone who’s watching pandemic develop since early - it’ll go similar direction masks.

If remember guidance February/early March last year, general sentiment medical masks could provide protection wearer, weren’t worthwhile prevent spread virus used laypeople. 

After information came masks actually significantly lower transmission, tone changed pretty quick. Mask recommendations became requirements moral imperatives pretty quickly. think we’ll see jobs travel destinations requiring vaccines, strong public messaging campaign go get vaccinated.

There isn’t particular reason vaccines *won’t* lower transmission cut severity symptoms eliminate altogether. Hopefully we’ll get solid data next month two. optimistic.

I think next 3 years including year, see difference. Open summer close winter, due new variants.

After 3 years, expected pandemic continue albeit less severe life impacting way, masks continue. However, we'll better treatments dealing recently infected covid19, greater chance recovering little problems.

Those infected prior aka now, essentially fucked long term health problems. Unfortunatly them, damage long done. Yikes. Wonder J&amp;J single shot even way effective (57% vs. 10%) AZ? feels like lifetime go April 2 months away!! Add ""freedumbs"". We've vaccines barely two months. waaaaaaaaay early start getting sad worried never getting vaccine. Yeah, people say/predict behave necessarily much correlation actually behave, especially comes coronavirus stuff, public shame baked issue. majority unable adapt, it’s sustainable. i'm new york i'm student that's good news  funny seeing people talk like OP here.

I another thread question raised: ""When start discussion opening up?""

Like, discussion already happening. Places already opening up. know locality from, assure Governor, Mayor already discussion internally probably even putting info publicly. Thankfully I'm hearing much...wait mean ne... nevermind Yea idea people perplexed people going refuse vaccine. media constantly beats head ""nothing change everyone vaccinated"" new variant hysterical headlines, ofc people going refuse since told vaccines would make things normal again. That’s mild disease (I know JnJ says “moderate” definition moderate two symptoms, someone fever headache would counted moderate.) JnJ 85 percent effective severe disease 28 days 100 percent 49 days. Hardly coin flip. Relevant starting plummet quickly. isn’t vaccines (yet). may starting see combination seasonality side likely seeing herd effects kick in. Death apparently exist Covid? Ohio, pulling vaccinations away 65 older crowd vaccinate teachers. Yes, rise again, drop again, rise again.  spikes cases changed.  see weekly continual reduction cases due vaccinations time yet. I'm looking forward happens, hoping new strains come along mean time. US. willing get Johnson Johnson one. Things moving slow. sick tired worrying covid. abundance caution, continue abundantly cautious every disease eradicated. like it, nobody it? got it. encouraging outdoor activities summer instead continuing push ""STAY F*** HOME"" message huge mistake. JFC could use wishing abilities wish covid go away that’d great thanks 😩 debunked? Positive PCR results conflated infectious cases identified issue now. 

“ three sets testing data include cycle thresholds, compiled officials Massachusetts, New York Nevada, 90 percent people testing positive carried barely virus, review Times found.” Congrats, everyone Im surprised see many anti lockdown/ restrictive measures, including mask mandates. vocal minority missed hard data says masks closure bars/ close quarter socializing spaces ineffectual? Anybody else stop think “why got hot dog?” move on? consider group C. bad thing? Restaurants bars re-opened inside dining near me. comes another spike. shit never control everyone vaccinated it’s like half ass every time “tHe eCoNoMy” keeps going also learn better ways adapt ways far sustainable others, people still seem understand.

Wearing masks grocery store even work sustainable, socially isolated staying home months end not. Seriously. Fauci Biden etc. inside information vaccines US getting when. must wrong random people Reddit want back normal summer starts. People think every Swede Floridian hiding mass graves something. r/suddenlygay Wishful thinking opinion, time tell. “Stay safe.”

I officially built aversion word “safe.” times recent past tempted ignore common sense safety measures plain house work; spite. 10% paycheck gone would reduce buying power? Definitely. 

Definitely, significantly. Look much cases decreasing, try square 1 10 people vaccinated. Well, seem like let virus dominate life. Thought prayer time superspreader bowl need this? think everyone likes imagery, implies limiting factor physical space administer number available vaccines.

Maybe helpful couple months 🤷🏻‍♂️ enough people realize this, enough people follow guidelines correctly, enough people understand transmission works, enough people vaccinated even begin herd immunity, enough people educating recent information available. I'm doctor, best learn we've long way go yet. Summer feel exactly like last summer, hopefully fall we'll start seeing affects vaccinations. People definitly following restrictions really hate people think majority people throwing parties SPIKE 

SURGE


(describing something might happen) don’t data says masks “have helped all?” people hospital long time, occasionally multiple months. states reporting backlogs. couple days ago Indiana added 1,500 deaths toll. yet Al-Jazeera articles Israel treated absolute truth reddit I'm surprised see women truckers. bad, right included Nova dont think science says sitting feet away someone different household hour without masks on, sometimes semi-enclosed spaces like patios tarps sides, touching things waiters touched, using public restroom covid spreading risk? Women likely report symptoms general, likely seek care. 100% good thing, that's outlast us probably. Nope.

It's 95% effective preventing symptomatic cases 100% effective preventing hospitalizations caused variants similar original Wuhan strain type.

Unclear effective preventing asymptomatic infection. Unclear exactly much less likely vaccinated individuals transmit others. Good evidence moderately effective newer strains (B.1.1.7, B.1.357, etc) vitro research statistical human studies published yet. either close don't. Wal-Mart dangerous small, independent lady's clothing store 3 people inside typically. segment change risk tolerances adjusted post-vaccination post-decline (if, fingers crossed, current decline indicates spread lessening). I'm eating restaurants going movies right now, theoretically, three months decently-responsible COVID state seeing transmission 100 cases day J&amp;J made \*do\* get sick I'll basically flu, I'll absolutely plan barbecue-and-Marvel-movie night bros. ""Women Die Heart Attacks Men;Unless ER Doc Female - Scientific American"" sorts articles it. linked first google result got. Here's another. No, eradicate avoid risk mutations. That's think much change even people vaccinated. voted Biden supporting Newsom removed. covid response vaccination plan atrocious. Know lot Democrats turned also. r/whoosh

that joke response designed appeal q sensibilities create logical breakdown within illogical worldview. me.

I exactly going around licking doorknobs, want immune system trained ready kick ass get old enough cold longer minor inconvenience. 10-15x many vaccines given positive cases day. That's pretty damn good IMO exactly think point vaccine is? ...an intimate personal holiday people traditionally celebrate restaurant. throw homosexual thing times get focus women’s rights. It’s one tools.  Rebekah Jones always liar fraud.  People need stop paying attention her.  

Also well publicized lawsuit filed state Florida used grift tons money donations twitter white knights? quietly dropped last week. dismissal notice requested Florida state police pay legal fees judge denied that. That's sad fact going deal with. society adapt around virus, openly accepted obviously going part life quite time. year defined new strain.

I'm sorry, need accept this. unsustainable unable adapt. restrictions based suspected cases variants. Goal posts never stop shifting. 🌈 🐻 Thats fine long ok spread potentially shutting deadly variant opportunity. Either choices risk. camp doesnt want take chance variant could global killer ways makes current strain seem like warmup. dont think anyone home 24/7 right first inline. doctor got vaccine virtual right now. Literally sees patients person could jump line. Rest office wont let anyone sick got too. rollout disastrous.  think every right doubtful entirely new vaccines would pan out.

I'm happy did, agree premise variants certainly likely concern going forward. good news we've proven tech, adapt variants much quickly. drug, probably know, left Phase 1 Trials promising results, also small sample Aviv’s Sourasky Medical Center (Ichilov Hospital) said Friday 29 30 patients received EXO-CD24 treatment recovered three five days.
Many COVID-19 deaths associated cytokine storm, means immune system begins attacking healthy cells. EXO-CD24 treatment COVID-19 based exosomes, responsible cell-to-cell communication. treatment delivers CD24 protein lungs, helps calm immune system. I’m aware studies dynamics outdoor dining think would important add prevention serious illness AZ vaccine provide. South Africa variant (assuming supply limited) think might good idea vaccinate old people AZ vaccine die vaccinate young people vaccine reduced transmission most. 

That way protect old vulnerable, reduce community transmission greatest amount. goal exactly??

Getting click article. single goal -- algorithms designed make sure online content reaches goal -- is, hyperbole, threatening become downfall modern civilization.

The moment society decided somehow wanted news free online doomed future shameless clickbait, divisive sensationalism straight fake news. That's gets us riled up, gets clicks, clicks generate revenue.

Somewhere, algorithm realized ""Things looking better"" get much engagement ""Things getting worse"" get second headline, regardless truthful damaging untruthfulness society.

The goes political divisiveness, fake news, etc, etc, etc. Apparently really like engage content makes us scared/angry/upset. that's algorithms keep feeding us. caused great deal global issues already, suspect cause much future unless find way stop this. see stop it. worry, that's article says. OP one note, make everything that. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah it’s side effects check VAERS. 

Also allegedly 1% report VAERS grateful every country world participated massive conspiracy make Trump look bad. would say form social conformity rather genuine fear law, nowadays Singapore authoritarian country paper, really. Legacy actual authoritarian country 60s 80s though.

You'll honestly need one sociologist explain people followed covid-19 related laws here. different regards conformity say, Taiwan SK, democracies probably freer much. South East Asia similar too, flawed democracies lot freer paper laws suggest.

And yes, free speech corner's joke stunt. find activism online anyway. cameras, think basically like every city. Also similarly useless petty crime like theft shoplifting. much theft anyway, find students leaving laptops cameras unattended time. Police basically lambs lot lax think. Look interactions public. total 10 people they've shot city 4-7 million past 30 years. Lack intermingling(relatively) people social outside circles Asian city anyways. barriers peace tho.

Posting I'll censored automod low karma lol(just like I'm censored Singapore government switch defense attacking PM. least hope) someone work tell vaccine sterilizes people. admitted told family this. good. Grim milestone

Surging, soaring, skyrocketing

When safe. Hell, even word safe grates now. It’s definitely thing. Don’t worry much it. hope dad recovers soon! Downvoted defending men? world live folks 👍 oh, im that. glasses learn hate masks fast That’s small sample size it’s less meaningless watching WWII documentary day footage Japan showed people masks. One guy even chin. SARS may made widespread, start there. thought here. Sounds like Israel experiencing big number cases young people older people vaccinated. Scary af. vaccine eliminates case, reduces spread - can't spread infected. vaccines provide sterilizing immunity, reduce 95% symptomatic infections, that's big deal. Asymptomatic infections tracked, true asymptomatic infections low secondary attack rate anyways. neckbeards really milking finally pretend heroes.

Pretending mental health issues non-existant bad denying covid exists. Masks may while, degree social distancing. lockdowns wont last past 2021. dont think people tolerate past july year.

Not everyone meant caved undetermined amount time. Isolation creates stress anxiety many people. people chosing eating bullet risking covid. would rather risk covid mind you. yeah, stay cave want. many already checked disagree, they've bought many AZ ones Valvena. They've bought enough vaccinate population like 2.5 times over. they'd bought loads Pfizer ones they'd much better position supply issues kicked in. concern me, that's money losing inevitably get fined. So, cancer. died covid. gotten covid. could survived. fact. half truth. attribute 80% drop 7-day average new cases state (Idaho) last two months to? ""Changes Mobility""?

Yes, rather large decrease mobility.  increase mask use hurt anything either.  Whatever wherever. jab hoax! He's crisis actor faking death! died respiratory failure Corona! really demonrat! fake news!! /s don’t accept shit I’m vaccinated! Good they're fucking something. Although concerns potentially Streisand effect backfire happen. easily see antivaxxers push ""see, they're trying hide truth!"" angle this. r u aware US's sanction made ""they couldn’t feed family there""?????

If case population would starved long ago. currently line get vaccine. I'll probably line 2hr total get vaccine. going 5o keep isolating locking down, what's point? anything 2 hours. could work.

Eventually going take leap. horizon, wait? think careful translating social behavior among Asians released strict military curfew/lockdown (basically house arrest) American contexts. Unless every single citizen Wuhan nifty electronic contact/distance monitors used NFL, really know extent ""close"" contacts. go back work? meeting friends? indoor dining re-opened? allowed guests homes/apartments? parks/playground/group entertainment venues re-opened? many variables impact degree contact able pinpoint unless monitored everyone's movements 24/7. fwiw NFL electronic monitoring fitbit thingies this. That's lot people invested us never getting mess. don’t think subsequent spikes reach 300k confirmed cases per day  Would suffering asymptomatic/mild infection, possible even effective vaccines, still make prone long term side effects? Thankfully seem rarer reported though feel way times, it’s normal. Hang there, we’ll get past this. Congrats! gym saved mental health can’t imagine mine shutdown long. Enjoy getting back it! Dude, know live US nobody stops dating RIGHT NOW, long people ok it. get hating lockdowns - never hated masks. Social distancing masks stores mean one comes near everything kind quiet. love it. Probably Feb 29 gyms Toronto though, since Feb 22 annoucement move back Grey Lockdown. Gyms still closed get back Red. 

Correct I'm wrong. Well go out, see it’s true. I’m even gonna get ways people defy rules break “law”. Im UK variant spreads fast. Good luck stay safe. think hard works done yet cringe No, mrna vaccines. infected part virus DNA, neither living dead. Different kind vaccines. Everyone please remember trump distribution plan biden takes office. Oh god same.

I mentioned friend couple months back going coffee shop sit read bit (quietly, myself, socially distanced table since tables far apart now) like, wow STAY SAFE! 

I could rolled eyes harder that. 🙄 that’s talking. may right.

Where’s science? Unless name science something Very, solid advice. Social distancing fairly broad term West, much detriment. Blocking household mixing, case UK, sustainable long periods time.  Places like Germany, South Korea, Singapore instead set limits mixing, works far better fighting isolation likely ensures better long-term compliance. happen standard multiple treatments reduce severity organ damage caused covid19.

We reached standard yet, expect 3 years reach standard.

Unfortunately previously infected, damage long done. cares much protecting people around wants people around die. That’s Empathetic Way. people continue ignorant fact TWO judges signed warrant. Seems off? “In South Africa [Johnson Johnson vaccine] 57% effective moderate severe disease, 89% efficient severe disease death. Nearly cases due infection new variant.” 

[Here SA turned Johnson obviously used monkey paw. Italy (so sorry bad english) deaths people aged 50-69yo represent 10% total deaths, pretty substantial.

Overall death rates kind meaningless given [radical progress we've made treating lot decisions comes vaccine availability. Quit soon? (I know, can't prove wrong otherwise would, know honors sake.) superbowl. Give time. called moving goal posts. cant win move goal posts prove they're wrong something said would happen didnt.


I'm going say numbers despite photos huge gatherings large portion country still taking everything seriously. cold weather hitting people still working home spread actually contained extent stuck home. Also keep mind alot people already virus theory creating level herd immunity vaccinating also creating level herd immunity. probably helping situation well. lung cancer... seriously wtf post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* live? yeah covid restrictions going years lol. social end pandemic happens restrictions cease matter. am. 

Spending long time closely speaking someone without masks always seen covid risk, even outside. 

So enclosed spaces like public restrooms. I'm LA resident I'm overall unhappy Newsom &amp; local health dept. I'm left-leaning mean I'm pro-indefinite lockdown like others. understood harsh lockdown beginning since know much... learned transmission virus, effectiveness masks, relatively low-risk activities, stopped supporting indefinite lockdowns, especially outdoor spaces safer indoor spaces.

The problem lot upper middle-class residents think way handle lockdown... understanding virus spread much LA low-income essential workers sharing households. can't really shut businesses Newsom knows that. LA huge amount low-income essential workers live multi-generational households. That's reason LA got hit hard despite ""lockdowns."" cases surge again, people want every business shut Newsom knows can't necessarily without financial support ire businesses.

This last lockdown make sense lot people. Plenty indoor businesses could stay open outdoor dining &amp; campsites closed. asked present evidence outdoor dining contributes spread, LA Health Dept admitted evidence want different households mix. Well, tough shit different households gonna mix anyway; time inside homes. Hence major holiday surge had. rules seemed arbitrary, based actual science, turning point became unhappy them. Instead promoting reasonable measures &amp; frequent testing, Health Dept said never see friends family rest us knew work. Especially mutli-gen households.

The continuously shutting-down low-risk activities re-opening arbitrary guidelines eroded confidence local health dept. &amp; government.

So yeah, necessarily think Newsom handling super well, he's got ire sides aisle. anti-lockdown pro-lockdown crowds mad semi-quasi state he's put us in. keep changing ""rules.""

Not mention, Blueprint Safer Economy plan sounded fine beginning, 100% unrealistic now. can't move next tier there's like less 5 new cases per 100k people. Can't open ""normally restrictions"" &lt;1 case per 100k people. ever happen point? Probably not, Newsom going adjust plan well, going erode people's confidence. Better throwing trillions wall street I'm 11 months (as male), got ANA test done last week came back negative.

It hopes would autoimmune, seem (in case). Seems like help; unless Im misreading looked at. vaccine it. *always* going new variant it’s endemic illness. accept restrictions availability vaccine, never end.

And going entire decade without dating? bars theaters all? That’s stuff insanity. case vaccination limits, stop, COVID replicating. 

You did. think “science” centuries long tradition careful say specifically prove observation, prediction replication.

A lot people decided throwing “science says” front things believe makes extra special true, like “Simon says can’t argue me” science hasn’t said shit subject Shoot havent, I've part staying indoors much possible, triple masking go out.

Yeah, also see idiots even bothering wear mask. hope wrong, know more... ""new normal"" .... socially isolated staying home months end not.

I've it. No, great. fact, sucks donkey balls done. Obesity tough many causes. causes systemic poorer areas don’t much access healthier food options healthy food generally expensive. think government find ways help resolve that. government can’t “solve” help reduce it. Also lot schools area cut recess gym schools putting funding physical activity kids also help reduce it. Good comment? uses metaphor couched parable, talks (bad) habit especially common certain nation. bad habit exclusive property one 'side' said afflicted nation. ubiquitous, prevalence means 'sides' continue talk past say facts rather emotion. *That* fact, quite rare member either side recognizes fact, especially regard themselves. must one care cares think gonna life years. kids deserve see faces school play. Covid isn’t big risk kids adults gonna access vaccines year. long vaccines keep sick, don’t think need change lives covid anymore. 

The flu vaccine sickens hundreds thousands (just hospitalizations) kills 35-60k don’t stuff flu. covid similar earth covid? Sorry speak condescending twerps here. Suck easy, champ! fb would remove share button, would help greatly. segment change **if** things continue trend positive. really matter restrictions lifted. country going vaccinate elderly parents AstraZeneca. want that. Ok, thanks, I'll try finish it, hopefuly starts become grounded. Man, think case rate even death rate much lower much faster. We've already vaccinated around 10% population, majority vaccines given risk. see death rates start dropping like brick weeks. vaccines provide sterilizing immunity.  evidence COVID vaccines also provide sterilizing immunity. Public health officials clear ""they know yet"". 

Let's assume vaccines provide sterilizing immunity. case vaccination limits, stop, COVID replicating. such, protect mild disease. reducing infected person’s viral load, however, decreases transmission, providing substantial indirect protection. 

Let's spread fear mongering bullshit. Lockdowns going happen, however think lockdown length go learn more. 

But future pandemic defined variants, British strain, Brazillian strain SA strain proven therefore lockdowns happen, whether like not. 

I highly doubt would 2020 March lockdown repeat expect 3 month lockdown eventually, new strain winter continues problematic. Prove wrong champ. one downvoters give shot. South Africa began worry saw surge cases late last year areas blood tests suggested many people already virus. New variants responsible reinfections seen study Marines — done mutated viruses emerged, said Sealfon, led work Naval Medical Research Center. study involved several thousand Marine recruits tested negative virus three times two-week supervised military quarantine starting basic training. Commenters general tend less supportive lockdowns mask mandates lurkers upvote headlines. 

The daily thread good place vent people going struggles. Yes indeed :) understand. want anyone reading sub refuse vaccine doctor recommends it, read ""somewhere online"" vaccine kills cancer patients. Right saying safe limited efficacy data.

The reasoning Dr. Koffman gives article getting vaccinated vaccines generally safe proven efficacious, hospitalization rate for, say, chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients **89%** get symptomatic covid, **31% chance death**, literally anything safe *any* chance reducing chance getting infected worth shot. (Literally.)

That's leukemia, likely cancers similar risk/benefit scenarios. might true case friends specifically. I'm reading elsewhere Congressman Wright's vaccination delayed, plans ""in near future,"" according Texas Tribune. really unfortunate. it’s elderly people risk getting severely ill... two friends (20s) got ill, cousin ended hospital (30s), three boyfriend’s coworkers died (all 40s-50s). genetically at-risk well physically risk heart valve issue. Yes, continue stay home keep safe, EVERY gathering people participate in, matter occasion age people attending, puts EVERYONE risk due spread places like grocery stores doctors offices, need go to. I’m sorry, yes, pisses people still gathering.

Edit: However, agree less common holiday gatherings. still seen manyyyyyy Snaps parties, though :/ many Thanksgiving Christmas. think given context post, obvious referring politicians voters. increased out

Wonder long insurance cover treatments. said didn’t like vaccines Trump involved. today German media read retirement home 14 cases UK variant days got second Pfizer vaccine shot. 

The good news cases mild, still got positive it.

Source: Apparently, vaccine pointless people reluctant definitely shouldn’t get one, won’t change anything anyway.

I truly understand RELENTLESS negativity, point literally DELIBERATELY sewing doubt vaccine efficacy. terrible, terrible move. hope positive outlook literally banned now?? goal exactly?? I'm St Pete/Tampa pretty terrible. paid $25/ea go ""socially distanced/masked"" event party essentially bar cover charge. left immediately luckily friend projecting game side apartment building mile stadium, saw flyover fireworks person sat lawn chairs spread apart. Much better experience. People Asia wear variety reasons. someone lived many years Asia wouldn’t say care others West. ways it’s even less. It’s simple that. could easily see sizeable minority population still wearing masks occasionally, Asia. people don’t (or didn’t) wear masks regularly either. point return normality (as pre pandemic lifestyle), hopeful may summer (in US UK). risk population getting vaccinated, lead alot less hospilizations deaths. Question remains actually return normalcy ...

With said, I'm really hoping summer abroad London year get canceled 🙏 big issue pharmaceutical company seemed operationalized efficacy differently, I’ve seen. randomly test everyone involved others wait retroactively hospitalization occur. Without standardize definition it’s really hard compare amongst one another. say got vaccinated got doses. Don’t forget waited playoffs done 2 days Super Bowl announce this. end day, vaccine here, prevent severe infections, significantly lessen hospitalizations deaths. Many public health officials say need wear 2021 many people happy comply. one people ""ditch masks"" return normalcy. metric looking % people stop blindly following orders would prefer someone whole brain, guess half fine. Illinois state thank goodness. commenting CA probably mismanaged state.

The person hand waving deaths demand country falls poverty starvation make ridiculous pleas emotion cover fact you’re simply wrong. new information cases collapsing, deaths lowering too, vaccination drive gone great way mutations potential ""what if"" scenario.

I guess it’s complicated describe, gives credence concern variants covid would make exceedingly difficult create efficacious vaccine. it’s good know better handling variants others are. 🍆🍆🍆‼️ Same!

Oh btw...I'm Canadian, nothing 500k deaths Um... yes.

""China reports new local COVID-19 infection **for first time nearly two months**."" Aug. 19, Bourla implemented stock-trading plan, according disclosure Securities Exchange Commission.
The next day, Aug. 20, Pfizer issued press release featuring ""additional Phase 1 safety immunogenicity data"" confirming Pfizer German partner, BioNTech, ""on track seek regulatory review"" vaccine candidate October. Lol people say “MSM” like bad thing far reality based wherever people say “MSM” get “news”. legal weed must good there, ;) Walmart pharmacy... get flu shot there. covid vaccine? comment pretty dumb

 Next you’re mad cvs giving vaccine?  Covid smart virus. avoids protestors, Biden celebrations, it’s smart enough stay Walmart avoid take bites food mask off. Covid gets pissed hell visit restaurant 9pm, attend football game, drink airplane.

Very smart, covid is. I’ve noticed people *really* dislike post sources go anything positive. Sorry want facts, nice feel good ones. Brazil?  counts original variant obviously newer wonder connection hospitalizations down? Yeah, budget good shape coming 2020.

Short another pandemic coming, trust Republicans better normal environment (pre-Covid). Many people also extremely fatigued restrictions many able work home lives turned upside whole thing. People change. premise China decided lie 2 month long outbreak? decided lying zero COVID getting boring let's make outbreak spirals control wait excruciatingly long time lying finally over? common symptoms.

try look SOx NOx, thats cruiseships BAD BAD BAD. risk vaccinated, I'm assuming we'll see deaths drop dramatically well, awesome. talking western first world countries, though. paper link 3 months ago, variants rose prominence. worry much efficacy ""classic"" COVID, ever-expanding mutations. completely lost me.

Can please explain actual point? exactly Biden anti-vaxxer? Lockdowns stupid. Restrictions based case numbers stupid. work theatre (and also favorite thing world) new stuff gives hope. plus snow NYC making break every day. escape Florida family, much happier here, still worried future, career, life. know much take. Yeah, superbowl. another spike like holidays. 

Did anyone see superbowl notice players refs wearing masks *or* social distancing? Infuriating!!! like last year never happened! 

Rules thee me.

I words... sale disclosed months advance. Yes isn’t case new variants. AZ vaccine effective, 4 vaccines approved use. you’re wrong fronts. 

Saying AZ vaccine ineffective flat earth levels science denial. left hate science much?   Bunch VA... Amen mental health aspect. Psychiatrist Aaron Beck cognitive triad theory depression: 1) negative views self, 2) negative views world, 3) negative views future. 

It's hard see criteria 3 met within past year- 1) told selfish wanting fun things, 2) negative views world self explanatory, 3) negative views future? Good luck stuff look forward indefinitely defined pandemic. hospitals overloaded point people triaged dying hallways, I’d favor lockdown community hospitals could treat patients effectively again. I’m sure people (generally) realize exactly bad would actually happened.

Masks, distancing, hand washing? Probably okay vulnerable vaccinated. 

Capacity limits indoor dining, bar closures, restrictions businesses? I’m less favor those, unless hospitals get crushed.

School closures? No, favor point. True, local government fights stronger restrictions. Austria 100 days lockdown today partially reopened. Locking tyrol might lead violent protests government want risk it. Especially since hope getting vaccine soon people. simply fed up.

The cases spread fast now, though, also regions. likely get partial protection SA variant well, meaning may get reinfected likely milder infection second time. point isn’t gonna matter. Vaccine hope doesn’t work... well... Mother Nature cruel mistress best return actual normal anyway. Life meant lived. western first world countries harsh labor laws big protections labor force, unlike here. You’re new favorite person. Noted. read earlier afraid hope. take long time widely available around world? become straight get then? recently exposed someone Covid. I'm experiencing mild sinus congestion scratchy throat, mild headache little nausea. tested waiting results. anyone similar symptoms first started? I'm 28 year old female, underlying health conditions.

 Thanks original strain taken strains (SA strain example) media non stop doom. feature miserable “experts” find spread doom. makes impossible rational discussion dealing pandemic. everybody convinced thing kill them, cannot talk schools, vaccine priorities, reopening, return actual normal.

It’s disgusting really. Well, nice knowing literally anyone Iowa..... hasn’t experience  Nah. providing authentic experience would like China. think said 28% got vaccine, *when* infected, would develop severe symptoms. 50% efficacy?

Correct. correctly understood efficacy expressed. probably misunderstanding. know getting downvoted (actually do, whatever). already logistics place vaccinate hundred million people every flu season within span couple months remember ever driving NFL stadium get done.

With relatively slow vaccine production going (we're still 10 million doses week), there's reason believe thousands thousands hospitals, pharmacies, etc., etc. able easily handle logistics.

Adding dozen NFL stadiums PR fodder. *cries Canadian* CI also allows 50% efficacy, 10% lower bound. say wait actual paper come out. estimated daily new cases/daily deaths threshold, get under, masks preventative measures necessary? curious! also test far, far Japan.

It may Japan test much too. hospitals nearing capacity Tokyo area hospitals well.

Southern California, like NYC, hot spot due population density. seems California lot things ""right"" yet still suffered significant toll. Sorry guys go this. hope vaccines get rolled promptly enough prevent another surge. think starting effect last week two decline prior less likely due vaccine

If anything decline might speeding recently could due vaccine There's definitely talk California variant, getting clickbait headlines others. also little bananas would say places entrenched mask politicization. Make simple, effective tool protect public health pandemic, places made clear public health orders. refusal politicians certain areas acknowledge fact comes politicization. Using science guide public health politicization, refusing acknowledge science basic facts pander base politicization. Hello good sir,

Your pot full refuse. Well yes bad press, bad science, get go. dosing mistake falls Oxford, mixing data well. trial scientific. press Yes. goal isn’t hospitals overrun covid patients. That’s certainly highest priority need. also need hospitals able return level normal operations treat traditional issues.  configuring covid unit makes difficult things. doesn’t mean need get rid covid vaccines push covid like annual flu, that’s state need get to. BS. You’re making things up. sub slowly tipped *""they took muh freedums""* crowd jump half-sentence correlates world view ""other"" get them. think normal folks know behave pandemic moved away commenting crawled thrice daily anti-Fauci CJ along predicting certain group impose restrictions FOREVER proudly declaring recently ate indoors ""packed"" restaurant (congrats, guess?). behave ridiculously numbers people believe lockdowns mask mandates new normal. 


Things going go back normal. even need ""own x's"" get there. went back normal Spanish Flu, different. Exactly. information, imply case. touchdowns players tom brady personally invited play lol Hopefully means people age group start getting vaccines. 

If idea stop transmission potential new variants imparitive younger working age vaccinated asap. people keeping economies alive interfacing people most. uh are? something relatively simple makes people feel like they're something problem. certain point becomes cognitive sunk cost effect- ""well bought masks, spent $$, keep told work. put effort remembering wearing them, can't stop wearing even might holy grail"". Keep mind testing sites shut weather right now, there's little lift numbers 10th theyre set re-open, everyone stay calm! Keep looking 7 day averages :) Haha! Yeah, know. I'm giving hard time. :) thought funny phrasing. Definitely huge moment! problem! Fwiw, issue new guidance calling positive results, part least conspiracy. #of tests performed (USA) 25% month ago 

""Amplification"" tests reduced, reduce false positives.

The death rate useful metric.

Other stuff coincidence:

* Biden won, 2 days later vaccine.
* Election fraud allegations: big lockdown.
* Military protect Constitution: back normal - unless female athlete. Thanks award, nice person. Rises 84% second dose 12 weeks jabs. 62% including suboptimal 4 6 week jab schedule we've learned anymore.

edit: though agree comment, 90% 70% numbers released, ""dosing error"" data discarded indication they’d enough stockpile beginning vaccinate large percentage start? None know Death's matter looking COVID rn lagging indicator large death count past weeks due large COVID infection rates December-January. affects everyone COVID infection #s, lowest 7-day avg since November. rate we'll hitting summer lows 2-3 weeks, effectively bringing COVID control. able get vaccine appointment scheduled job?

She finally got first shot somehow ended going one schools nearby them. 73 year olds wander around get vaccine. sarcastic joke, guy. pointing funny phrasing. :) Possible. high risk though - FIL COPD MIL cancer survivor. 70s. asymptomatic, lottery. matters spike protein. JnJ AZ actually delivering spike protein. FDA coming guidance detailing handle follow-on vaccines. Apparently, believe need go entire process again. God, heart goes you. good words you, many us sympathize empathize plight. I've lost much faith American people this.  talking dad yesterday said, ""we remember country, too,"" hard feel way people living selfishly walking away unscathed, getting vaccines despite total lack concern. Thank kindness. unfortunately still lasting damage infection, hope youth allow heal coming years again. Best luck husband. also 19 started, turned 20 today 

Happy birthday guess LMFAO survey remotely accurate (I doubt it), implications would much serious amusement parks sporting leagues suffering financially. would indicate pandemic caused massive damage social tendencies.

But think vaccinations widespread turn like public response mass shootings, terrorist bombings, etc. lot people may sometimes feel bit uncomfortable crowd, means avoid altogether. Hope countries follow suit. 

Seems like drug need go trials phases used internationally. Interested see results Greece. know would much easier pull source ""discussion.""

I'll give example. said Joe Biden took vaccine. looked ""Joe Biden Vaccine"".

In five seconds able find complicated, fact.

Yet can't same.

Maybe, maybe, right here? hard simply say ""I'm wrong?""

That's all. nice day. WoRe MaSkS says they're going wear masks vaccines don't. think reasonable person would classify ""nothing going change"". know sick restrictions? Virus.

Know we're still talking masks distancing restrictions? many people US DGAF sense personal responsibility. countries around world masks restrictions that's right first time rather complaining -- includes government ignoring bad look.

The vaccine close. Maybe close like, made far make vaccine. think stupid feel time, got long-haul COVID could waited weeks. smoking significantly increase risk? seen evidence smoking per se. Reducing deaths 80% still leave orders magnitude worse flu. vaccinations help unvaccinated we're giving people pass asking everyone else still pay. 

We really need enough vaccinations create herd immunity drop prevalence permanently.  think one big exception going air travel. think masks still going required flights, along re-entry restrictions. think reason get it, despite upper SC hotspot, homebodies anyway ""not gonna stop living life"" meant father law still went Home Depot every days it. lied saying didn’t want take trump involved. nothing wrong vaccine. plays politics. area everyone additionally stood 6 feet apart (id grandmas run across street approached masked sidewalk) particularly indoors.

Hand sanitizer bottles everywhere, schools closed, gyms closed, museums closed, indoor dining totally closed, outdoor dining half year.

And yet still awfully. fact better Brazil Sweden. however metrically CA better UK also fairly draconian lockdowns. Honestly Newsom going get screwed either way trying vaccinate California must super difficult. However way vaccines distributed kind crazy. mahmoud ahmadinejad said don’t homosexuals iran, there’s really way knowing. next door neighbor infectious disease dock named 2 puppies Ace Spike.... guess anti-science first place could upsetting you. ended group people little negative effects ""no big deal dont get it"" Immunity vectors real concern. never said possible increase efficacy. said easy. compromises made - actual efficacy time two shots. simply fact ZERO concerns mRNA vaccines coming booster shot cover new variants. 

You're citing AZ's efficacy first two doses (the data place). come 3rd dose inoculate new variant, safe assume efficacy would abysmal ChAd vector used. get teen years still look forward adulthood, no? need buy one China EU. good J&amp;J one shot. making become personal, lets civil shall we? understand like saying.

I know else say you, hurting think pandemic over, forgotten done end 2021. Yup, May 3rd, 2013 specific. 


Remember, ""coronavirus"" generic name whole family viruses, many cause common cold. main focus sub past year SARS-COV-2 specific. I'd argue represents internalization fear authority... suppose possible internalization eventually resulted cultural drift towards Asian countries (wherein fear standing / criticized ostracized.) Could blurry line point. Anyway, point taken.

I think authoritarian paternalism bad mean imply citizens Singapore live fear knock door middle night, etc. get ruffled euphemism.

(But many points darker flipside them... shootings vs. America? Well, significant portion cop shootings involve gangs drug dealers. drug dealers America Singapore? Well maybe something fact freakin' execute dealing drugs Singapore... yes there's positive here, sure, let's totally gloss methods used get there.) Remind 5,000 people died 24 hours sometime last week Covid October. still get mucus production random times. It’s annoying. day little less frequent though. created account right time everything locked down. think he's either mentally unwell troll (or both.)  Florida wont. months. can’t find it. Sorry. OP picks chooses quotes like articles cause anxiety reopening. 

Read article someone else posted comments. Feel free continue research. pointed new ships going cleaner, didnt sign teach course. listen guy. ;)

Get get much poon teens. Enjoy youth. There's link huge comment relevant. Things moving lightening fast right now. Nearly 2 million vaccines administered days, third candidate expected approved soon. way CEO put ""We went phone call last March 50 million vaccine doses delivered already."" unprecedented speed.

A former FDA commissioner said weekend expect wide availability vaccines *April*. means May we're done - restrictions. rinos now-cons need primary least Trump trying pull troupes out. Biden putting back in. right, science assume negative positive supported data. logical would, tend approve medicines logical conjecture. What's flipper childer? Really? think entire country coordinated effort fudge numbers make things look better actually are? 📉📉📉❗ seeing crowd Saturday around Super Bowl dont expect stay down. expect abother spike people stupid.  many last 10 “made China” purchases fun? take argument long way rabbit hole interest in. choose travel vs buy tons crap, make choices wrong? That’s good rebuttal. Numbers absolutely fudged taken context. I’m saying that’s case numbers used lie. happened US? believe Churchill said Americans will, finally, things right, tried every alternative. Yes teachers priority help union well. It’s people without employer doctor help struggling. asses efficacy telling people control group vs telling treatment? 

I find hard believe behavior would similar two groups. 

Also studies work US, study design available outsiders view. 5 seconds find. Quit obtuse idiot. common cold cause long term effects. I'm surprised people continually make comments refuted spending 10 seconds internet try keep backing statements proven wrong. Good. We're almost done. Hope right. I'm brexiteer, UK gambled one vaccine, fact really sensible decision (that made government) spreading orders around prevent supply issues circumvent issues like one AZ vaccine. Pfizer, Moderna approved Novovax Janssen awaiting approval. UK seen appeal cheap locally produced AZ vaccine gone full pelt it.  far I’m aware Pfizer already tested vaccine lab using real SA variant found effective. second time data backing 

Man AstraZeneca brigade strong sub  That's correct. disputing that. simply disputing ""have reactor unsteady platform different beasts"" statement.

Regardless owns it, tech exists. Well cry wolf many times :p imagining that. reason second half? Coronavirus - II? Flu? Desperation? Pathetic...

It seems earlier reports, numbers Russia understated officials 6.5 time, fully correct. think people fully vaccinated hang together without restrictions, visiting people vaccinated would still consider *some* precautions, like masks and/or distancing, depending risk levels. Thursday get 2nd shot vaccine. I’m college student volunteer hospital able get early. haven’t seen grandparents great grandma since Christmas 2019 normally see every months. seen family members. 3 weeks (so I’m basically immune) can’t come soon enough I’ll definitely paying family members visit. I’m excited honestly able go bars without worrying spreading roommates hospital patients. Oof thinking “not first time people go Linc get stabbed.” Yes, unfortunately. would grow even faster without it.

Its R0 50% higher. vanilla variant R0 3.8, one might R0 = 6. That's [about smallpox rubella values guess. Sorry, replies seemed bit doomy gloomy probably hastily thought meant like too! agree sure. anymore don’t.  Non-Floridians longer eligible. Dumbest comment ever heard, lots questions humans clear answers, nothing less research done women (which likely incorrect). comment actually sexist nature hope self reflect it


You're confidently incorrect, busy calling others dumb sexist ignorance. could spent 2 minutes Googling saved embarrassment maybe used talking butt longer embarrasses you? 

There course miniscule chance simple ignorant willing relieved same, anyone reading comment thinking could true? Start *""Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias World Designed Men""* Caroline Criado-Perez book studies data need real bias affects women disproportionately, WRT medicine. idea countries require yellow fever vaccinations generally require people arriving countries actually yellow fever, typically require people arriving large cities - specifically encourage travelers. it. travel see family regret it. 90% number trial error, one dosage data misleading since actually tested AZ constantly used young people tests, leads better results. Nothing misinformation.

The Queen really proud you, dude. getting condecorations moment now. 

And totally foreign agent trying lead fall UK casually talking fucking vaccine. guess fucking terrible job. Cargo ships serve important role global trade. Cruises fun. vaccines actually available? disagree that. works, probably save lives even SA strain. 

It's easy say start making one mRNA ones, probably take year scale production, like Moderna Pfizer. mean time protect strains, possibly help SA strain, tweaked less time would take switch over. dolphins stadium get air think much anything known long immunity one dose lasts --- pretty much everyone gotten one also gotten second dose weeks later.

We know immunity natural infection lasts (probably year) even single dose vaccine generates immune response comparable natural infection. Owned nation states. private enterprise. AZ shit results every regard SA variant. lab results look good Pfizer/Moderna SA real world days. real world days showing J&amp;J novavax iirc good SA variant. AZ’s results show similar results terms severe covid cases control vaccinated group SA variant iirc. Depends looking hospitalisations symptoms.

If hospitalisations, bloody good.

How much worse exactly?

It 100% protection severe disease hospitalisations ffs. Smh, sub clueless. Personally interpret scientific study ""taunting"", fair enough.

It's bit unfair accuse vaccine nationalism. I'm attempting prevent misinformation sharing actual studies matter, rather potentially editorialised takes opinion pieces. everyone's interest want maximum success vaccines, includes best prevent misinformation could lead increased vaccine ... guess know racism is.

**racism**

You attacked me, others, due fact British, used devalue opinion. racism. metric.

I speak purely American POV here. Rural areas probably abandon mask mandates soon, even all. going coastal states try keep long can. insane criminal. Walmart one bigger pharmacies. companies large scale pharmacies something lol mostly depends public perception hard predict. enough people willing wear anymore, either cases / hospitalizations / deaths low sick them, mandates go away. Yikes, that's way worse thought. SA's decision drop using AstraZeneca one makes sense. 

I wonder put countries' approvals AZ hold, UK roll boosters soon possible. assume containing SA strain unlikely successful. Fuck, that's tiny sample go off.

Not really great dataset. Could please provide source? Translation 2020, 2 million 124.5 thousand people died Russia. 324 thousand (18%) 2019. data given Rosstat.   half excess mortality falls people diagnosed coronavirus. Coronavirus main cause death 86,498 cases; another 17,470 cases, coronavirus assumed main cause based clinical picture. 13,524 people, coronavirus precipitated development diseases leading death, another 44,937 cases covid effect onset death.   December, 44.4 thousand Russians died coronavirus - maximum months since start pandemic. Covid found main cause 25,980 cases.

I currently working distribution site, tell one African-American temps cease desist talk distrusting vaccine he's going replaced really haven't. First number find way headline 90%, revealed mistake small sample, 62%, stressed time two doses affects efficacy significantly, revealed recently efficacy 70% one dose. total mess. B.1.1.7 got new mutation common B.1.135 South Africa. B.1.135 *is* already partly vaccine resistant. ones keep moving. ""two weeks flatten curve"" one year ago permanent preventive lockdown. Ya big time bummer really understand idea ""well restrictions big deal we're really locked anyway!"" 

That argument used pushed idea keep restrictions longer they're ""not big deal."" restrictions anything, what's point them? Best advice honestly stop following news much can. They're really trying cash COVID fear keep clicks going. Every day one day closer finish line, it'll ok. obvious reason efficacy AZ vaccine much different J&amp;J. 

Immunology intuition goes die. No, virus doesn’t care. Fortunately, fewer fewer people also care, decide there’s life hiding bed forever avoid one specific virus. politicians care population starts rioting continued restrictions, unemployment, on. 

Short Covid magically mutating Captain Trips, end sooner rather later. lmao Incorrect. They’re already using stadiums themselves. Charlotte week ago started using Bank America stadium 80% parked walked gates 20% used drive-thru option. 

If using parking lots wouldn’t even need stadiums. hope political career term way Im voting recall putting GOPer power.

I think that's likely. Everyone know NY either ready start hanging things again. Lots early plans already made. couple contractors working house last week pretty much gave everyone wearing masks unless near other.

Even people know taking crazy precautions early basically like ""so seeing guys again?"" Schwarzenegger ran re-election Democrat Phil Angelides, California State Treasurer, 2006 elections, held November 7, 2006. Despite poor year nationally Republican party, Schwarzenegger re-election 56.0%  much hate Trump, hard disagree much used shit WHO. useless organization men even go doctors... people trial relatively young thereby significant risk death serious illness anyway. think way lockdown may made particularly ineffective. banned outdoor dining outdoor gatherings anyone outside household. That's extremely harsh, probably necessary given outdoor spread unlikely. fact, banning outdoor socializing may pushed people gather indoors private homes, increase travel state avoid restrictions- could pushed transmission cases up.

If Newsom actually followed science, could really chance promote safety still letting people socialize focusing people towards outdoor meetings. Instead failed slow spread created lot misery hash lockdown. figured locations already-they using stadiums Phoenix working safe efficiently hear. also 200 non-medical volunteers day directing traffic checking people in, end shift get vaccine would think would still stronger restrictions even people vaccinated dominant strains (in Europe/US)?

Because SA variant dominant one?

Vaccines safe.  


V451 vaccine shown GREAT producing antibodies Phase 1 trial participants discovered testing positive HIV. That's scraped.  


The russians keep saying side effects vaccine. later found 3 deaths result vaccine. testbed, Argentina, reported deaths already. they're dismissing it. also put trust single vaccine, others last extension. According Farr's law epidemics, february march happy months. climbs like space shuttles falls like rocks. true all. Tweaking vaccines possible take considerably less time initial testing. mRNA vaccines particularly well suited it, though may mean booster shots already vaccinated.

For average person, help vigilant getting tested. means tested exposure feel unwell. best know tweak vaccines figuring variants dominant becoming dominant. cases found sequenced, better idea we'll best tweak vaccines. answer reasonably give random stranger online, facetious got one-way ticket block list. “Afraid.” Stop living fear. getting fucking absurd. True, multiple reports already talked extension fucking hate virus. Studies show smoking puts increased risk. studies show makes harder get virus due nicotine taking ACE2 receptors.

Which one it? :/ can't FDA EUA something one shot..?

dentists already painkiller injections.. right 5.1 positivity rate weekend. change two weeks. dumb people understanding stay home super bowl. Me? wrong you? You’re putting bunch words mouth. 

I’m wondering caught variants early haven’t even led increased overall cases “origin” country, fear bit overblown. mean they’re licensed healthcare professionals learned immunization delivery school, absolutely plus! store yesterday one guys working butcher counter *clearly* sick, coughing mask sweating.

That would bad normal times, given last year honestly believe kept work. Cases falling Manaus mayor Wilson Lima laxed lockdown rules I’m Karen talking someone privately putting people’s health jeopardy? Nice. Sounds like they're meeting Wednesday make decision. doctor issue. human issue.

Doctor better able use letters name shame people.  much sympathy kids never got experience senior year especially. Imagine looking forward spending one last year friends well prom graduation suddenly you’re told won’t able that. original 1,000 deaths day also horrific large majority deaths concentrated one city, NYC. saw affecting city horror presumed would fate everybody country eventually. something like 56,000 excess deaths NYC 65 day span. 

Luckily, NYC worst, even hardest hit cities recent wave never came close kind death NYC saw. neither, except wife. I'm Canadian, living Germany. easy make friends here. We're retired looking forward traveling lot. used dance tango, 2 maybe 3 nights per week. Last summer could dance community backyard one else there.

We Football stadium, Qualcomm/Jack Murphy Stadium Padres used play Chargers used play moving Los Angeles demolished new stadium SDSU (San Diego State) built.  state run sites NYC sensible given relative proximity. 

 capital region/north country, available vaccine appointments two hour drive away (plattsburgh/utica). 

Why expectation 85 year old senior must drive 4 hours round trip get vaccine (if sign online) experiencing side effects? It’s front-line healthcare workers get vaccinated. It’s basically anyone works healthcare company even work corporate office. I’m consultant working project healthcare company get vaccine. got mine 7 days ago stomach cramps nothing else. Everyone reacts differently might turn big nothing burger like mine was. I'm sure remained constant long quite low constant reality. see graph worldometer. hospitals already starting depogram operations. Age 65+ accounts 80% deaths USA. 2010 40m people aged 65+. I'm sure number gone up, let's say 50m. goal hit 100m complete vaccinations April/may, think we'll 50+ age groups covered well 80% drop deaths. Likely we'll 10% saw peak.  OH GOD! BIDEN IT!!! FAST?!?!

 can’t wait see replies make difference though pathogenicity? covid bind easily ACE2 variants? ugh.....so true sad. \*looks clownery Super ""But vaccinated people crowd"" Bowl meant servant Yesterday wound situation close several people sidewalk partially closed got bunched together. wearing N95 still felt really uneasy.

It's going strange hell go baseball game. I'm gonna. Doesn’t story imply hospitals scam? overly cautious good thing? like new normal people either that's different saying ""we keep following guidelines months continue positive trend get another wave, still possible.""

Warnings work. Optimism long term great saying things improve tomorrow counterproductive. Last checked research said smokers seem less likely get infected, get infected seem worse outcomes. speculated smokers less likely get infected tend spend coffee lunch breaks outdoors, away unmasked co-workers indoors. Schools definitely safe. There’s need linking Oxford vaccine British nation. It’s vaccine.

Ah yes, vaccine developed premier British biotech firm, collaboration premier British University, funded primarily British government, vaccine supposed inoculate largest number British citizens, supposed inoculate majority citizens former British colonies could easily mischaracterized “The British Vaccine”.

Thank you. Germany extend lockdown 2 weeks. joke I'm sorry, totally wrong, I'm talking UK here, difficult continental Europe. island Brexit government, happy close borders **people** goods (hence comment starving accurate, Brexit what's going cause happens). two choices: let virus mutate control keep making problem worse vaccines work resulting rolling lockdowns, hundreds thousands deaths totally overwhelmed health service crashed economy actually deal all. latter lot less painful, trust me. would stay lockdown forever power Paw patrol. Looks like simple misreading CDC data me. New York state data city included numbers. soon Folklife hits masks comin off. spring break. worries. nice day! mom friend got bump week first shot December think slowly got suspiciously bigger finality better course 2 weeks. went doctors precaution. Idk friend know mom reacted quicker second shot. sounded like arm hurt day vaccine site felt hot also passed quicker. Hmm, may aren’t testing enough reason? precautions taken. I've noticed health experts worried variants. 

But whats anyways? think lying?

You think days away declaring over? okay? sort dehumanization fucked up. active social life covid. day rarely went didn’t interact friends irl setting. 

And didn’t flatten curve ffs. get worse worse Americans demonstrated lack personal discipline flinging little understanding science wall like monkey throwing shit. stop spread protect others. takes one infected person deciding wear it. California got praise early pandemic response year ago. San Francisco locked NYC see much first wave hit NE NW really hard. situation changed since lot good eroded. UK variant might dent decline, right UK seeing similarly massive drop cases USA. South Africa. Neither country intense lockdowns. going impossible contain them. argument is: people decide can’t stand anymore, we’ve enough now, thanks, virus go away... think argument second.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* don’t give people cancer treatment immune system vaccine would basically kill you. There’s problem extrapolating long term conclusions one year old virus. people long covid months, barely long enough begin studying. I’m seeing estimates 30% recovering patients signs long covid, don’t know long numbers preliminary. don’t know many still affected couple years decades.

What coronaviruses relevant. MERS 35% lethal livestock coronaviruses lethal that, aren’t using inform public policy. ...9/10 fraction, yes, whats point...? guess men likely straight die. Complications COVID-19 include cardiovascular diseases men unlikely get treated time. Also diabetes, men notoriously terrible sticking required diet. Nothing article says that. says virus become pathogen circulate years, even decades, leaving society coexist Covid-19 much endemic diseases like flu, measles, HIV. OMG. still spread virus!! GO OUT!!! Science can’t say it’s safe, give probability state consequences. way rely purely science take one two actions: assume everyone get give up, wait virus disappears completely (which isn’t happening.)

The point someone takes science says “these risks number deaths acceptable”, whether thats 1 death billion, politics.

edit: it’s like making personal budget. mathematical ideal amount money spend non-necessities zero. can’t quantify happiness terms ideal. 99% us occasionally spend money non necessities.  Can't wait til suddenly everyone autism can't kids...

That's there's absolutely proof works.

No safe trials.

Literally nothing good this..
/s high deaths single day, 5,000

Not true. ATH **recorded** deaths Indiana's extra 1.5K data dump.The real death number day around 3.5K

The real ATH Jan 12th, (because Christmas) real peak death curve Jan 21-22nd. (3rd 2nd highest death days). Why? Fenway always home green monster. Valentine’s Day live Iran they're going import Russian vaccines. safe? get one? heard they're tested sketchy. wanna get cancer whatever later. 

I could keep staying home.

I know health minister whatever said taking vaccine super untrustworthy. Science, bitches! fraction them, yes. mean see Novavax US coming months?  Archived link:  seen malls packed since 1990s. similar AZ - guess long term see vector vaccines quite similar efficacy. See y'all two weeks (Superbowl Super Spreader Spike) According logic leave house again, ever. There's ALWAYS going chance spreading Covid another disease someone else. Even got tested morning, could catch transmit later day. 

We cannot assume full responsibility everyone else's health, even contagious diseases. way lies societal breakdown. maladaptive altruism, will. balance collective individual responsibility healthiest approach conducive overall societal well-being. metrics also confusing well explained. Lockdowns going based case rates test positivity, wait said arbitrary scaling factor based hispanic covid cases. actually it'll ICU capacity. say ICU capacity mean actual ICU capacity obviously. complex time series model projecting ICU capacity 4 weeks now. can't see model. bulk vaccines going likely end hospital die virus, people likely end hospital die vaccinated material impact hospitalization death rates? majority vaccines gone 65+, highest risk hospitalizations death. actual cases probably much higher what's reported, good news we're least getting overwhelming healthcare infrastructure. know ""normal"" return we're lot closer six months ago. wonder co-worker's views mask use are. another steroid type treatment? different one? Sure, want live like hermit year, welcome that.

I living like hermit... Outdoor socializing simply big risk big sacrifice.

It also like ~3 month difference. doubt going offered vaccine like getting one locks particular brand forever.

If promised could Pfizer vaccine end summer, would take whatever vaccine wanted take today. Three think 1 ensemble 2? I’m ensemble 2 got shot yesterday hope it’s placebo. Although felt like cold yesterday arm sore today. Man, shit's really good. love I'm getting new music suggestions coronavirus sub right now. lol want put basketball hoops back up, seems like every state done it. evidence shooting hoops outdoors major factor spreading virus problem way worded, facts. said, point dramatised all.

Anyway, regardless opinion, thanks clarifying point. What's better? vaccine thats 10% effective, vaccine that's 50% effective? better vaccines, let's use soon available. Play Bluetooth speaker inside car drive fast next time! :D approved phase 3 trials, people rightfully suspicious. released trial data appearing response Pfizer's data. released trial data otherwise probably early (the number infections still pretty low) appeared PR stunt rather data conclusive. 

So many people got impression, going say great regardless. Selfish comment even make sense lmfao. like trying go burn can't read well enough pull lol. would nice Nurse Gritty gave shot though.  10% efficacy calculated 2000 people trial, 39 people infected. far conclusive trial be. (not mention nothing demography people trial) 22% link data cite. joke? unless least preprint studies, numbers completely meaningless. Frankly, would embarrassed release numbers public.  5 times many COVID cases reported cases (some estimates say higher, say lower), 42% U.S. population infected.  plus vaccinations certainly enough gain benefits herd immunity. share study shows reinfection happening significant rate? haven’t seen single one. hope regulators approve quickly, data positive. take vaccine available 89% efficacy UK &amp; US virus, 60% effective SA variant (for HIV-Negative). Prevents hospitalization death. similar J&amp;J single shot? would great True pretty good long since concert, becoming bitter sweet.

Although Behemoth's live stream fucking bonkers. personally think lockdowns help slow spread never stop it, long spreads illnesses deaths.

A lockdown completely halt spread very, severe done early spread, done Wuhan certain island countries. later looser lockdown less effective is. Lockdowns almost everywhere US category. CDC recommends covid, get vaccination 90 days passed. recovered covid last month, yet gotten first vaccine, wait 90 days passed get first vaccine series two.

If get first vaccine, test positive covid, don’t need delay second dose. However, you’re quarantine, wait quarantine head get vaccine. 

Sorry confusing — make sense? Essentially you’d delay 90 days haven’t first shot yet. Outdoor stadium, American leftists love point COVID infections surge w/their race riots BLM protests entire 2020 summer. maybe uptick.

I'd agree even stadium 1/3 full, good look considering US pandemic stats. 

... let people live way want. People make personal decisions differing levels risk aversion, vulnerable protected. 

Can't anything either way. exact problem wording. Exactly. world outside US small middle eastern countries, ability choose vaccines. take have, wait deliveries vaccines higher efficacy. many countries mean months vaccines severely reduced supply. I’m guessing he’s talking fans. 1/3 vaccinated healthcare workers, packed regardless tons massless crowds bars streets Florida saw Also gave Iranian cleric braindamage, preexisting condition? Irrelevant point. Hack planet! 👨‍💻 There's reason assume couple point mutations evade immune response, especially since immune system adaptable. spike protein tertiary structure, points weaken binding.

There's enough studies say definitively, personally doubt mutations enough negate acquired immunity entirely. done better job acquiring sufficient vaccines. time “tolerant left” dead. election showed left murder dozens cause billions property damage get little angry. US might end today 90,000 cases reported first time since Monday November 2nd

tune CNN 6 hear exclusive special actually catastrophe means we're going dealing 2026 considered impact private purchases pricing, thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

It frustrating watching gov nothing. Seeing people following health rules everyone close getting sick. Wanting vaccine almost instinct point, some. another trip Japan (my fourth years) scheduled November I'm hoping take it! truly great country hope get go!  cant move others, 60% world cant use mrna type vaccines cause dont logistics (cooling/handling) thats recipe mutations countries got fever 4 days first Moderna shot. Lasted around 24 hours.

The second dose, got week ago yesterday, fevers all! insurance plan substandard out-of-pocket maximum. one rest easy plan like that.   

I've high OOPs low OOPs. OOP option. absolutely crazy, outlawed. member states, all, want mRNA vaccines expensive AZ.

I think instead getting members agree vaccines, member states free select preferred vaccine form vaccine pool could procured EU bulk. would avoided haggling. 

However, may problem countries ended selecting failed vaccine neighboring country selected successful vaccine. would pressure share successful ones irrespective orders. Ultimately, single market maintained borders stay open, like US states going introduce border controls. mRNA vaccines problem able cover different strains/viruses once? far understand, Novavax (protein vaccine covid) cover even 4 different variants one single shot, mRNA stuck one much want seek higher side effects. mistaken? Maybe best way show someone love year take restaurant since indoor dining repeatedly linked infections outbreaks. anyone know happening? one changed anything they're vaccinations slow. theories reason? Georgian random passersby nice compilation possibly related like optimism, sure pulled numbers though. far cases right last summer, vastly contagious strains spreading like wildfire. Vaccinations slow, currently 3% received doses required, 10% received one dose.

People non-Western countries able get things called ""airplanes"" travel Western countries. Millions it. Viruses known respecting borders. *Sigh*

There isn’t agreed upon level antibodies needed neutralize viruses infections, it’s range. Sometimes wide range. postulate number 1000-3000 neutralizes particular pathogen, vaccine produces number 6000, it’s safe assume it’s effective. you’re vaccine produces number 2000, you’re still minimum number likely response isn’t overwhelming

In mRNA vaccine cases, cushion formed massive lab testing suffer drop still neutralizing. That’s Pfizer found 3 separate lab tests. 

Pfizer Moderna know trials, like conducted AZ expensive time consuming wouldn’t offer insight. already know vaccines produce immune response substantially higher needed neutralize even variants. It’s still way early declare “Oxford vaccine 10% effective SA variant.” tiny study. confidence interval -50 60.

Way thorough investigation needed think masks actually causing damage. see littered place. constantly touching face adjust mask leaving/entering store great either. Thing warnings true. media hardline lockdown crowd pretty much prognosticated sorts bad things, hit, don’t. remember people thought would 2.2 million dead year end, could get groceries, masked outdoor stuff could super spreader events, sports leagues couldn’t finish, etc. stuff double masking (why triple then?) variants. Every time something turns true, lose bit credibility—why think it’s hard get people use masks? It’s entirely possible areas without access don’t cold storage requirements needed Pfizer 100% dependent Moderna vaccines? county (not NY) flush vaccines due ability take Pfizer nobody else could handle 30 minutes struggling vaccinate want it.

My top concern becoming long haler. think specifically stating circumstances it’s acceptable eat outdoors, that’s sufficient count “safe”

Nothing life literally risk free, common conditions low enough risk qualify safe. Yes, theorycraft situations 10 people different households sit directly across circular table take turns breathing other’s coughs, real life, outdoor dining appear causing spread Africa paused introduction Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine preliminary trial data, first revealed FT weekend, indicated ineffective mild forms disease caused 501Y.V2 variant coronavirus.  variant, first identified South Africa dominant strain country, proving much difficult counter B.1.1.7, form first emerged UK. Today’s development another setback AstraZeneca. follows refusal Switzerland authorise vaccine doubts raised France, Germany Portugal efficacy older people. also stumbled appropriate dosage regimes involved public dispute EU supplies. Approval US, meanwhile, delayed insufficient data. Medicago currently Canadian front-runner. They're middle phase 2/3 trials. They're supposed supply Canada 76M doses approved, think make end year. mean, force negative test? Forcing positive test would different. fair US properly closing active cases. 100k-200k per day new cases x 14 days 1.5-3 million, nowhere near 10k active case number. Lots states reporting recovered cases. AZ vaccine uses monkey virus deliver spike. human body learn detect neutralize viruses, future injections may effective.

You limited amount times choice future boosters. may taking 10% protection today, losing 60% future booster rendered ineffective previous exposure.

It necessarily best choice take ""better nothing"" vaccine bridge n-month gap (AZ already working version targets b.1351 strain.). would exist one vaccine world, would case, alternatives there.mRNA vaccines seem limitation, good news.  someone said expect stay home orders every winter that's laughable. also permanent lockdown claimed.

Keeping mandates hospitalizations fall 65+ vaccinated, data showing vaccines reduce transmission comes out, accelerate loss trust.

Going along vaccines broadly Available. assume they’re referring Dems Reps elected officials, general public. worry us singles keep infection rate Valentine's Day. may doesn’t want miss work since vaccines essentially giving immune system dry run infection.

February 10: Kingston, Renfrew, Hastings - Prince Edward

February 16: province 

February 22: Toronto, York, Peel taking account *volume* air outside much air moves around, even semi-enclosed spaces. ventilation, means less risk, completely indoor space. mention low low risk spread fomites Yep sounds like false positive  seasonality side likely seeing herd effects kick in.

Nope, herd effects yet.  Total, US less 28 million people recovered virus.  Added ~42 million vaccinated (assuming overlap) that's 70 million 327 million people, 22%.

To reach herd immunity need ~65-85 percent, existing immunity due vaccines recoveries impact case rate much we're seeing, we'd need enough people immunity start ""fencing in"" virus, words situations can't reach anyone else infect.  

This would correspond small populations greater percentage people immunity, effectively herd immunity smaller scale state nationally.

So far, states vaccinating people area, rather they're targeting vaccines at-risk people, means they're going save lives, also virus still able spread. gamble. Define majority me. vocal suicidal redditors? US theory Christmas season increased infections, Sweden theory Christmas season decreased infections?

I think actually surge US Christmas look charta there's dips testing holidays increase 14 days Christmas look really remarkable, like continuation trend. think even US increase small family gatherings single day may offset people taking time wonder Sweden getting close herd immunity. states US North Dakota restrictions relatively rural population concentrated relatively places, kind like Sweden. Without many controls cases dropped stayed months.

Sweden really anything like North Dakota, people urban centers Stockholm, Gothenburg Malmö, fairly dense cities live rural areas. sure immunity playing role Stockholm really hard hit, true areas hard hit Sweden pretty average compared European countries. even answering this. longer acknowledge people claim wearing masks isn’t horribly disruptive anything buying groceries. second people misconstrued it. Michael Mina, one sources, specifically made rounds soon came make clear positives infections, false positives. likely infectious time test. He's hammering point home months. Yet, reason, people keep posting old article nobody ever clarified. really hope US take idea run it. imagine lot people, faiths, would feel lot safer receiving vaccine place worship volunteered vaccination site! 

Just general though, there’s much currently unused space churches/temples/mosques could become vaccination sites, medical personnel necessary staff them.  Lol  fact Sweden tried achieving herd immunity naturally failed. 

What proportion population infected point strategy deemed failed? group C 1/2? B 1/2? things solo beyond what's necessary, count one hand number times I've done things people live with. 
There's definitely lot people angry frustrated.

They're definitely vocal.

They're anti-mask, want wear anymore.

They're *that* anti-lockdown, want lockdowns reasonable. soon possible.

And tend much pro-vaccine, might seem little vocal though, take worth. Well, I'll best. promises tho! noted Rep. Wright battling cancer time hospitalized September due cancer. got meet number times; really nice easy talk too. RIP I’m sure there’s going use parking lots. doubt stadiums used could wrong. disagree take entirely. people still pushing lockdowns never gave shit economy. understanding whatsoever. bunch overly risk averse, morally righteous virtue signalers want shame people conforming views. 


Trying convince lockdowns bad based economics arguments fools errand. need non compliance restrictions need tell people push normalcy delayed forever go pound sand. That's way ends Nope it’s 95% effective *preventing new cases*. 100% effective preventing serious cases.  anything, sub feels like negativity exaggerating.

IF new strains everywhere, when. fear-mongering point. 

It likely elderly vaccinated, death rate drop point COVID thing distant one fucking WON. Stop drivel. Uneducated morons forcing people's hands. YAY!  lose trillions healthcare costs, single one look people caused it.

The re-open side objectively won. Hence everything re-opening. 

Are saying uneducated morons forcing Governors re-open saying California NY Governors morons? 

Either way, irrelevant. Everything re-opening whether like EXACTLY hit hard.  done arguing people looking learn anything. We're people like can't think beyond selfish, immediate desires.

Pot meet kettle. 

Here things failed learn today: 

\-The vast majority people care short-term results. Policies made cater vast majority people want.

\-Democrat Republican Governors alike want re-open everything February including indoor dining in-person schools. 

\-Once elderly vaccinated, death rate drop point IFR COVID statistically irrelevant people throw away masks gather socially. 

\-More importantly: nothing say matter. Politicians listen you. vast majority people listen you. re-open side won. expect covid case numbers rise Iowa coming weeks. Idiots. moderna vaccine 95% effective preventing cases coronavirus. 100% effective preventing serious disease. We’ve known months. want covid? That's get covid!  sit, UK making policies data.

my friend's FIL got shot Jan. 18-55. He's 80+

his booster   University Oxford today published [Preprints analysis data ongoing trials vaccine. this, reveal vaccine efficacy higher longer prime-boost intervals, single dose vaccine 76% effective 22- 90-days post vaccination. think much less true think is, least US (yes, know UK article). US ordered enough Pfizer/Moderna end summer. Nobody going force take shot point. 

Additionally, distribution probably likely based location, AZ/J+J vaccines easier distribute therefore better suited rural areas. seems likely that, choose, could probably simply drive city get effective vaccine. hate got downvoted you’re absolutely right. People legit look fat people like it’s fault ton different reasons, like chronic illness. Would prior infection protect SA variant, everyone susceptible SA variant... lost 100 million terms progress herd immunity... Epidemiology grad student here, specialty surveillance animal diseases. 

For herd immunity work certain number population vaccinated. covid estimated 70% order virus persist population. 10% likely contributing decrease numbers significant way still plenty hosts virus infect. excited honestly able go bars without worrying spreading roommates hospital patients.

They still studying spread virus approved COVID-19 vaccines prevent spreading virus now, experts sure. enough research matter, studies underway find out. still potential spread virus,"" said Dr. David Priest, infectious disease specialist Novant Health. ""The science ability spread virus experts certain vaccines transmission yet, state vaccines scientifically shown greatly improve person's chance fighting virus avoiding would doubt it? significant enough amount Americans shown refusal slightly change behavior way pandemic? would start now? Bars open like restaurants...so can’t like move around. sports limited wouldn’t consider open safer. safe. science still said going holidays. oh don’t want know reality thank vaccine makers turning mess around without we’d fucked, matter it’s Democrat Republican leading government. mean? want people staying home rest lives? see, makes much sense now. Thanks explanation. wore mask did, clearly enough

Well, maybe enough save said last month chance getting sick all, ~0% chance serious illness. 

Where getting numbers from? pretty unthinkable every neighboring country continent tracks whoever's leaking covid countries data corroborates China's claims, yes would delusional think otherwise point. Yes, lies political gain 95% getting severe cases. German retirement home 14 vaccined people got infected 2-3 weeks second dose shows well  I’m waiting Tibetan monk variant make rounds. It’s matter weeks billions die. works it’s way another variant remote fishing village South Pacific going around. one vintage variant makes smell burnt soil orange juice right dick falls toes swell beach balls. congrats neighbors :) you’re still isolation testing positive wait get second shot isolation time up. 

CDC recommends waiting 90 days test positive covid get first shot. But, shouldn’t need delay second dose already first test positive. almost half deaths *weren't* nursing homes - no, people nursing homes usually ""about die"" they'd hospice. They're need care provided home. Many live years. 

Please handwave deaths nursing homes away. mom 86 still trucking along despite COPD, mentally sharp tack. fact might couple years left makes time even priceless. multiply families like mine. trivial. Good thing don’t live close you. Sheesh! looked like superspreader bowl me, surprised. schools industries open !!! Theres always going cases !! curfew aint shit epidemic people realize this. Can’t wait vote get rid man. CA needs better leadership. 95% chance getting sick all, ~0% chance serious illness. 

This safe us could ever asked for. 

We’re going keep forever. eager know too... get it. Well, reason we're asked still wear masks, socially distance, quarantine possible, etc., yes? must smoking crack support restrictions. doubt myself, we'll know couple weeks. predict 100% confidence MSM watching slightest sign ""surge"" Superbowl. expect concerts, there's sports bars open Texas? thought Texas one open states there. Huh. Guess not. Sad moshpits turned :/

But hope get enjoy one soon! :D think Fauci extremely correct operating norms medicine UK position sensible lawmakers treated look immigration wage policy **likely long delay doses would become standard.**

I’m shocked continually dissapointed. people like pandemics happen let us live lives, mental health, economy. Covid decimated us will
Continue Yeah California lot great things Covid response made absolutely sense. Businesses San Francisco starting rebel government can’t make mind wants us. They’re shutting spaces felt safest (shouts gym workers busting asses give us ample space sanitation) completely disregarding hot spots (what fuck supermarkets you’re even counting stores anymore, aside Trader Joe’s).

Anyone half brain skeptical fuck comes Newsom. Fuck republicans double fuck Gavin Newsom pulling shitty political tactics end spectrum. Honestly county health dept says doesn’t really matter. 

Vaccines reduce risk minuscule levels. they’ve developed full immune response (7-14 days second dose), there’s absolutely reason people shouldn’t see again. 

People haven’t seen loved ones months aren’t going continue distancing loved ones nearly fully immune it, frankly shouldn’t expect to. vaccines stop UK cariant SA variant, SA variant become dominant. beginning, sure, reimposed outdoor bans November long knew safer. It’s math point. Nobody arguing vaccines driving cases US point. 3 months now, sure. SA becoming dominant strain US?"
