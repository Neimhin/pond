They Covid run population. Covid tested. people still walking around even realizing sick symptoms. 

Poor writing ability like tells go medical school. US 56% fully vaccinated general population?  Whenever see this, reminds Matt Damon Team America Trust science. Thanks reply got 3rd shot Pfizer hit bad day after. chills fever injection site pain headaches. day back normal felt like went tropical storm. first second shots cakewalk symptoms speak phantom arm pain strange. support staff vital keeping hospital running thou perfect reply *Seinfeld “that’s shame” meme* …so exactly said change rate hospitalisation? You’re…talking infection…still vaccinated person could Covid symptoms like unvaccinated person. whoever cares patient doesn’t fully gown droplet precautions risk getting Covid higher, employee doesn’t symptoms still infected it’s one big chain. 

As far reporting CDC, that’s job don’t know goes behind scenes. decades long pension either. tax payer, win win.   going make statistics look better

Or maybe…*because* statistics *are* better, that’s aren’t required tested. Let’s throw away CDC said second assume you’re right. would affect infection statistics. testing affect hospitalisation statistics? doesn’t. even bringing discussion regarding hospitalisation. last shift

Anecdotes ≠ CDC data

I assume required report hospitalisations, patients fully vaccinated etc. CDC would hospitals data, see… appropriately 10% hospitalised people vaccinated. claimed 70% Mate, can't support vaccine producer. Maybe companies move headquarters Texas. Let's see Abbott then. Correct - testing vaccinated inpatients Vs testing every unvaccinated patient going make statistics look better. 

The 70% coming last shift. 7/10 Covid patients vaccinated. day that, 6/10. last weeks hasn’t dipped 50%. honest, I'm fine viewpoint commenter's, really empathize both. end breakthrough case, luckily loss smell transient. Super weird, though: litmus test sticking nose bottle rubbing alcohol, even smell that! things lower risk clots surgery. years ago done that. Good. Yes try best figure  always opinion post-vaccine world. actually weakly opposed general population mandates simply causing **such** major pushback becoming fight getting messy. kids get vaccinated boosters want them, anybody wants get protection get it; choice.

Want get booster? Cool, probably pretty darn well protected.

Got shot got cold feet booster? OK, *already know* risk, nobody hiding you. Besides, protection still pretty good.

Don't want vaccine? Hmm... like above, practically everyone knows risks are, whatever reasoning is, probably can't change it. think healthcare workers need vaccine antibody test (assuming they're accurate... kept much track them).

*That said,* tend still ask reason genuine way. able convince good chunk friend family group get vaccinated hesitation mRNA technology. Instead taking debate head on, sidestepped told consider J&amp;J, since viral vectors used vaccines mature technology. worked! anyone tried pooh-pooh J&amp;J, told them, ""I doubt could convince people hesitant mRNA safe without longer term studies exact vaccine, effective vaccine virus, far, FAR better going unvaccinated."" eyes

And you…expect believe seen small number vaccinated people die

Yes, know still possible die vaccinated person. also know 5x less likely infected, 10x less likely hospitalised, 10x less likely killed. 

I don’t understand point getting Covid tested. they’re hospital reasons unrelated Covid…then matter talking vaccinated people hospital *for covid*. Even theory correct, means infection statistic affected. hospitalisation

How Scott?  theres much evidence opposite. 1997, political scientist economics Nobel laureate Elinor Ostrom warned policymakers creating “cynical citizens little trust one another” acting without regard people’s ability think themselves. Perhaps problems persist governments increasingly relied behavioural advice rooted research psychological biases. Although research intend promote view populations irrational, routinely highlights errors human decision-making, amplify views already popular among political  sucks, hopefully vaccine thing keep infection mild. data boosters still shaky there's telling would prevented infection anyway. pathetic part 99% unvaccinated coworkers wouldnt feel punished assigned Covid floor. It’s another day life we’ve lived last 18 months. people like wishing bad us. first nothing protection infection. 95% number published infection. protection started waning back ""it never protecting infection"" narrative shifted boosters infection again.  worldwide crisis, billions still first dose. sub optimal situation share holders concern. Pfizer around longer Moderna. knew subscription services key business success. approved Pfizer boosters. Literally real criteria adults getting Pfizer booster 6 months dose 2.

Moderna immunocomporized (3rd dose, rather booster, Pfizer although disctinction there). J&amp;J approved additional doses. ivermectin horse treatment deliberate misinformation. safe important treatment humans.

If someone told treat UTI horse paste veterinary supply shop, I’d still call quack pushing horse paste, even Apple flavoured penicillin Moderna helping people around world. Unlike Pfizer sells vaccines cost third world, Moderna focusing countries pay full vaccine price. Hopefully Moderna focus giving developing world first dose. rather filling bank account third dose, even major proven effect immunity. Well, COVID19 aint going anywhere. Would nice effective treatment around thing endemic. Specifically, Texas. Proof? moderna lower standards also give boosters. Say more...it interesting think interesting? Bye 👋🏻 stock price went $25 around $430 2 years. think theyll fine. Mild moderate infections still extremely unpleasant, keep work days consequences bring, cause long covid (half risk compared unvaccinated).

The policy stopping (and spreading comes it) absolutely outrageous.  48 ICU beds open entire state per latest Yeah, that. One guy accidentally drank industrial concentrated bleach destroyed throat. fish bowl cleaner one looked suspiciously like murder, know happened that. I’ll go step further; don’t want community type person are. They’ve proven incapable show basic consideration others performing simplest task imaginable. Imagine people neighbors greater crisis. Thats honestly way forward. going ""New Normal "" forever. means cases explode one dying, live it. individuals make intelligent informed decisions

but that's exactly OPPOSITE people (referring take Ivermectin Hydroxychloroquine COVID). 


Just internet mean true, many morons realize this.  lot things survivable - mean want contract them.

This right here. COVID vaccine available general public (SO brought home, works healthcare) It. Sucked. survived. worrying smell come back. ""fog"" go away. bet ass either things would occurred, I'm applying whatever assistance would available - government (imho) usa large portion CAUSED pandemic linger, they're going pay. Everyone long term effects (again, imho)

Luckily, far know, I'm ok. Time tell. Got Moderna shots, get booster available.

Meanwhile buddy mine gallivanting via plane, inconsistent masks, vaxxed. really want tell told ... truly hope catch it. *NOT* GIVE ASPIRIN SICK CHILDREN  Healthcare workers qualify 3rd shots Moderna, immunocompromised do.

But there's verification. got 3rd moderna shot weeks ago (and Pfizer 1st to, managed lie way too). lack irony ironic circles back around fucks ass. is, itself, also ironic. Well proper word rhymes “departed”, don’t think we’re supposed use civil conversation    actually read requirements? say everyone.

Everyone covered Phase 1B eligible boosters eligible. add medical conditions, like BMI 25 ever smoked, that's huge amount population well.

And say get indidually decided live work high risk setting. 

How basically everyone except literally live without needing leave house? here, although Quebec let get second Moderna dose needed travel, id rather wait booster needed vs getting third dose piece paper. felt miserable AZ mildly miserable Moderna want go unless medically needed. Maybe that’s was. You’re right though. I’ve aged much past 40 years dementia confusing “cures” chosen headline lie. Singapore [78-80% vaccination never let COVID spread that's entirety immunity. expected 85% needed herd immunity, 80% would leave R(t)~1.33 50% weekly case growth 5-day serial interval - almost exactly they've seen.

50% weekly case growth, even protection offered vaccines, likely cause healthcare collapse. need either flatten curve somewhat (when they're near apex surge) give vaccines. considering? Dammit ""science"" protection severe covid drop much, protection mild moderate covid drops, age groups, high 70s mid 80s, depending study.

Whether worth protecting policy judgement, scientific judgement, optimal individual choice judgement.

Experts disagree public health value preventing covid; undisputed consensus. 

It's going ""the science"" believe boosters right choice even panel approve increase protection ""mild"" covid (which still pretty damn serious). stop watching Joe Rogan parroting everything says. shit rots brain. He's pro covid moron knowledge 95% topics covers. Fuck Joe Rogan brainwashed fanboys. Yeah might approval doesn’t go sucks would resort lying protect themselves. data clear protection wanes honestly someone 65+ it’s comforting say “hey least probably won’t die”. Even don’t get hospitalized die, bad infection long covid could really mess up. Stupid stupid does. think matter dimwitted, think matter brainwashed. Smart people believe part rhetoric people saying.

Smart people believe conspiracy theories too. matter intelligence. 

It's important humble this, we're human many cognitive biases, even though falling anti-vax lies now, almost certainly fall misinformation later. individuals making intelligent informed decisions. fact going fleet farm buying horse paste proof that. Today I'm gonna post example media REALLY help things comes Covid... basically matter.

While searching news, found [this opinion Now, start bad, recognizes Covid eradicable eradicable soon. Navigating personal familial relationships become trickier. Whether like not, Covid-19 shrinking social circles spheres interaction. **After all, interactions strangers come additional threat exposed virus**. one really meet almost-friend, work acquaintance etc absolutely necessary? answer people no. too, virtual interactions become norm openness considering equivalent real interactions way would refused mere two years officials announcing Covid-19 stay, writing wall. government must consider sustainable measures combat surges threaten occur again, invest greater connectivity everyone access remote working learning. Furthermore, government services provision, tax collection etc must shifted online prevent many people possible line repeatedly that. virus stay **points physical interaction people must reduced every way possible**. Finally, poor access none measures offered Covid-fodder desperately need humanitarian assistance support. simple terms, resigned perpetual presence Covid-19 need mean similarly resigned death millions.

As see, turns another beautiful piece creative writing like ones saw March 2020. know, ones predicted world would become dystopian VR-addicted future Covid. Mind you, article posted **10 days ago**

Like, fuck's sake, people even realise articles gonna depress people embolden antivaxxers? incredibly effective vaccines reducing transmittion letality everywhere, Europe clubs reopening, countries even ditched masks... yet people still insist writing delirium caused many watchings *Demolition Man* posting Web. can't even... cold. 2 days, get second shot sinopharm vaccine. ok? narrative WHO/FDA changed, always going people believe WHO/FDA = science. either trust science don't. see, obviously lot politics involved directives (as discussed linked thread). mother Harlingen. know good people trying best. sorry Abbot. monster. right needing something gerrymandering. make hospital equipment. money motive, they'd keep everyone hospitals long possible... Nooooooo.... they'll spread covid... bedbugs!     Alberta, Canada: hold Red Bull… New York City vaccinated people total number city US even total population. Good! even that. sequel Sophie goes ""well gotta one then""  That's awesome. see news ignorant protesting going on, hope ends soon. coworker Kyrie Irving? KD burner account?

Lol, someone told that, believed them?  think story somehow ibuprofen bad would make Covid worse. Idk, feels like 40 years ago. Won’t know til get there. It’s possible third shot might make effectiveness infections far durable, might wane way first series did, something between.

I always like remind people under- over-counting explain cases structurally higher country compared another, explain trends, except short term variations due sudden changes testing policies. ""But test lot"" never good argument dealing exponential growth. Undercounting not, explosion Singapore real. Profit revenue minus expenses, including everything said.

If profit selling 1 dose $10, able sell 2 doses $20. Coo-coo coa-coa puffs? 😁😁😁😁 people vaccinated there?

80% 12+ fully vaccinated. Masks still mandatory, except clubs dancing. Theaters cinemas 100%, clubs 50%, everything needs vaccine certificate Friday Green Pass mandatory work. It’s stupid goal PCR test discourage travel (that’s government trying do) Good. appear research all.

Worst case still longer second dose, since get several times antibody titers third dose second. decay works [similar second could end annual boosters. research yet antibody titer decay rate third dose.

That's ignoring cellular immunity, research either. infection appear significant t-cell response, prevents infection even antibodies start dropping [this know third dose accomplishes well, change shape graph permanently.

There seem fundamental difference versus measles, infected due 12-day incubation period body fights contagious. Getting sterilizing immunity respiratory diseases lot harder fast turnaround infection contagiousness. used unironically go burger king wall st. cause served beer tap alongside chicken fries. Great dinner break heading back office long night. access drug condition have, every non-fraudulent study shown ineffective treating COVID-19? get prescribed headaches? Good grief assume fear Delta wave wears mask mandates going lifted. States want attach goal mandates know happen. Texan here.

The thing Texas islands blue sea red. facepalm hard rest country every time Abbot opens stupid piehole. we're gerrymandered hell, lot voter suppression laws hurt (largely liberal) minority voting rate, state comes bunch ""YEEHAW REPUBLICAN STRONGHOLD!""

The reality is, could get voting rights bill passed forced bipartisan redistricting, Texas would turn battleground state. would consistently Republican, would state would fight keep instead one could rely - could pull Georgia quite easily. state red districts, blue districts tend densely populated nearly 50/50 split. Doctors gatekeeping access medicine artifact time information scarcity exist society individuals make intelligent informed decisions. understand society quite yet trend clear soon. Next step: Matt Gaetz founds religion based pedophilia sex trafficking. I'll take frustrating maybe disgusting, think. Though really strong enough. Unless going argue hipsters around early 90s we're going agree disagree. Good.

Are people vaccinated there? let door hit ass way out. already enough shit clean up. Mmm Udon. figure Delta variant rise jumping vaccine fence? Pfizer’s press release stated they’d next couple months: “Topline readouts two age cohorts trial – children 2-5 years age children 6 months 2 years age – expected soon fourth quarter year.”

Source: Texas Florida look tempting. missed either NY anywhere else. ""Idiots leave city go idiots somewhere else"" clearly not, explicitly said news going zero COVID strategy. reality I'd imagine people hesitate drop restrictions right Biden put option forward. vaccine safe enough. 6 months free didn't, honestly probably already natural immunity point.

But 100% vaccination 0 cases seems standard we're still pursuing is. Cool. acquaintance moved Florida could live “free state”. Hey, idea freedom means. Let go, border open fully vaccinated individuals months, like 6 months late rather early take advantage holiday travel. Hey man, trying research see safe!  also like anti scientific implies illogical views. That's part worry since countries might accept sinovac. However sounds like (including US) going accept approved vaccines sinovac list. Agreed. avoiding mass death community. Whatever happened concepts solidarity, morality, giving back community? 

Citizenship include freedom harm others. part social organism. aid virus, deserve live free consequences. There's stupid there's anti-vaxxer stupid. NYC much better anti-vaxxer stupid people leave.  think that's hip anymore. IDK, couple genderfluids 30s came abode last month mugged me. One riding fixie one skateboard. things took hipster card laundromat punch card; threw rest wallet back. thing said pssshh disdainful manner. Ohhhh. gotcha. must've misread. work Waukesha. Fuck 'em. can't believe downvoted heavily this. There's safe effective vaccine $10 rapid home covid tests available walgreens. There's reason can't get together family lol Completely agree. first saw story, definitely written scare people. found actually happening, small number people got sick... frustrating Thank you! I’ll pass followers morons. Jesus Christ, stop headlines. Every mandate workplace large number people threaten leave, comply. Businesses losing less 1% employees mandate this. Fuck, military what, 92% vaccinated already?

Go ahead write stories better fucking find someone who's actually moving instead ""considering moving Florida""

Fuck, considered moving last year. never going it, COVID WFH made consider it.

Better headline: people consider quitting mandate realize easier get God Damned shot don't. It’s definitely error wrong number coming publishing fact? mean, gonna do, check 4 year old's driver's license? U.S.? get antibody tests, here's link [my previous I'm struggling understand point question is. poor science denial? areas Constitution allows. See 10th Amendment. You’d think people pretend they’re badasses time wouldn’t afraid shot fully vacicnated person, part agree mandates That’s perception wonder conservative media telling it’s working? seriously think need 100% vax get over? I'm sure satire. crazy think we'll see 100% Yes! It’s amazing, probably effective already see posts consp .iracy sub. screenshot twitter post says ""Japanese government eradicates COVID 19 distributing Ivermectin citizen. hear MSM!"" also believes moon made cheese Patrick Star logic comes play: ""Let's take Bikini Bottom..and push somewhere else..!"" see now, definitely error though. ""But Pennsylvania county — 830,915 residents, around 200,000 fewer Maryland counterpart — lower rate fully vaccinated residents, slightly 61% population.""

Got Sharpie? Idaho entered chat. Also maybe got raise new hospital - job market extremely hot nurses right gave bottle 91% isopropyl use cleaning 3D printer bed whiff, knock much. (had clean anyway, parts started falling bed)

By way, flairs one shots (the latter also one J&amp;J).

I'm feeling ill, got sent home yesterday work ""disruptive"" due feeling unwell. Stupidville matter know. proven ignorant facts hand, also lack ability recognize contradicting engaging logical fallacies avoid admitting things said objectively false.

Edit: another poster mentioned this, maybe Read table right hand side article. Good job Delta Airlines. model every corporation around country. High vaccine rates without mandates.

Neat! supposed travel Niagara Falls spring break 2020. obviously happen maybe 2022! Ok, that's still wild assumption make, get it, like unvaccinated people cops, try use logic. Texas getting progressively bluer I'm pretty sure anti-vaxxers moving tilting scales back way. probably concluded delta infective USA never reach herd immunity vaccinations. Everybody get infected several times lives, goal give people enough immunity survive infection without side effects. Yeah whole thing interesting wrestle through. Even though it’s field think ability understand various levels scientific processes without overstepping dunning Kruger territory. 

I listen pretty much everything comes TWIV since beginning pandemic.  I’ve also gone quite Vincent Racconiellos virology lectures Columbia even interacted personally amas q&amp;as. 

My biggest beef point expecting/instructing people recovered previous covid Infection vaccinated also Instructing people coming country dump two mRNA vaccines right top whatever (if it’s one licensed vaccines) quite while. might change soon though we’ll see.

Contact tracing also good countries, there’s large number incidents tracked exclusively outdoor events. events transmission type indoor component.   Yeah, mild come common cold, mild covid infection get granny grave infect her. well, seemed mild quickly get hospital aswell. Canberra Australia 97% 16+ first dose.  side note, OSHA early pandemic keep workers safe. Glad see role vaccination effort least.The way shit ends enough us get vaccinated, one way another.



From I've seen lurking medical subs, Joint Health Commission(s?) has(ve?) even worse. Basically silent/absent nationwide PPE disaster whenever local cases skyrocketing staffing ratios astronomical staff overworked abused, covid numbers drop back down, show tsk tsk water bottle nurses station. 


Anyway, think many us would prefer world need mandates could trust one another right thing communities. America. instead vaccine mandates people subsequently throwing tantrums social media, insisting ""right"" play chicken deadly, highly contagious virus.

I also don’t think done research

And lastly, don’t believe never vaccines (ones less effective, mind you) make giant hypocrite “Marginalized people”?? Really? You’re extending term “marginalized people” describe anti-vaxxers”? Marginalized people describes people discriminated intrinsic personal traits, as, skin color sexual orientation. It’s foolish use description people choosing protect themselves, families, communities devastation deadly disease. refuse protect healthcare workers treat refused ultimate treatment. Instead they’re abusing people trying help them. need hospital bed, available occupied somebody refused help themselves? 

I’m looking people; rather I’m tired I’m letting frustration. could’ve months ago, people refusing part get vaccinated. I’m tired trying understand “fear” whatever. vaccines proven safe, hell lot safer actual COVID. What’s afraid of? Fear excuse people stupid. Uh what? already know originated China. questions how. would greater good mankind know truth, get measures place prevent happening again. really blame point. Death getting placed unpaid leave, worse? Exactly. don’t want them. Listening Sanjay Rogan’s podcast makes hard believe neurosurgeon. stuttering consumes 20% podcast. knowledge covid seems lacking seemed aware things pushed narrative it. appears though part spreading narrative. unwilling look information goes mandating vaccine everyone. 95% people hospital vaccinated, that’s hilarious. fuck immigrants, got it, thanks I'm ok want silo away rest society. think wrong 5x tranmission? CDC says 2x, 5x.

The Pfizer study found ""conferred 95% protection Covid-19 "", hence 20x reduction. That's vaccine, one pay attention to. 10x fudge factor, since know particular vaccine got. That's feel though. seen roommate freaking wants apply get better job he's ""forced"" get vaccine Vaccinated people still catch spread covid. Even everyone vaccinated covid still going here. know never going go away right? Must individual schools then. glad able free summers. find highlighted interesting. symptoms considered “mild” CDC people losing mind they’re called COVID.   planning leaving well covid. research vaccines. aren’t end all. guys spread hate much side don’t agree with. It’s disgusting. Parading around better people getting vaccine. aren’t better person. don’t think they’re, create life saving medicines. Immoral? Probably, aren’t evil. 

I like think benefits outweigh risks. likely saved millions lives vaccines they’ve developed.  read Patti Boyd's book. comes poorly it.  NAFTA trade it, making movement easy.  line thinking used lot pandemic, something absolute worth doing. Masks 100% bother, vaccines 100% bother etc. 

It's numbers, somebody 70% less likely transmit catch covid wearing mask worth it. vaccine. said taxes going reduced 70% would worth it? 

I'm 100% sold mandate general public certain professions high risk (food prep) unavoidable (police, healthcare, grocery store) national security (armed forces) brainer. 

Another serious issue misrepresentation statistics. see bother 99% survival rate? Well 99% hospitals swamped even 99%, that's everyone averaged per infection. seeing multiple infections unvaxxed people, 1% fatality rate could every 3 months. look risks mutations could result either less deadly virulent strain. mutation risk. crux issue, prepared take small risk vaccination (0.0018% ?) protect elders much higher risk death even vaccinated. Personally, see duty so. Others self centric decision making process. ain't Sweden thank good goverment that. here, frustrated stupid Vox article went around convincing everyone can't compare vaccines without perfectly clean trials data. I've worked cleaning medical data before, knew much science actually gets done comparing studies meant compared, meta-studies. valid limitation makes comparisons difficult, somewhere public verbiage crossed line ""keep mind limitation"" ""throw science perfectly clean"".   may designed primary endpoint. literally primary discussion prior Delta, happened provide fantastic infection. policy shaped exactly infection fact vaccinated people spreading virus, were.

That said. Perhaps current vaccines ideal design infection, know fact good (lets say 6 months) fact hold fairly well infection. also know third booster, antibody levels much higher second. Therefore 6 months period could potentially year example. ideal, mean can't get job done. mention **the only** game Maybe spend energy instead trying argue booster, going shorten pandemic

That's dumb ass statement. Take look Israeli dashboard want see happens boosters deployed.  Canada pressured re-opening border. Shhhh tell liberals they're misinformed conservatives get downvoted Idk everyone else love care anyone willing bare minimum protect around them. example would getting vaccinated

Anyone else going statistic  Germany, Denmark, etc... Vaccine hesitant real phrase. ounce legitimacy pro-disease groups deserve.  use ""defiant"". people refused follow simple instructions school. dealt teacher, too. somewhat gratifying see finally forced meet consequences following instructions. Behave like child treated like child. Apparently oral fecal route.  answer informative regardless intention. way! Brooklyn alone recently tied Chicago population... pretty close it. seen different numbers. ""Why grandpa die?""

""Well nice cabbie told us doctor would murder him, tried onion tea instead.""

I want find person see bullshit tell they'll automatically believe. can't change company policy turn around fire people get paying unemployment.

If company dodge unemployment benefits changing policy firing someone violating brand new policy, would every time. thanks sharing, glad hear much better feeling  God damnit, going come Florida. I'm ever thankful corporate community stepped started enforcing mandates. government, unfortunately, dubious legal territory forced vaccines, large corporations bring lot pressure bear people simply defiant childish. So, almost effect government mandated it.   'forgot' card wanted Moderna booster Pfizer original series. Worked problem.

Kudos pillar humanity. Redditors can't accept fully vaccinated people moved back living life normally possible exception wearing mask public indoors non-social reasons. say nothing never took seriously first place never got vaccinated.

Redditors living world people still following restrictions, staying home, socializing in-person instead garbage virtual/Zoom crap living bubble. people outside Redditor circle bubble moved - taking precautions getting vaccinated shamed so. dispersion. get particle transmission less. get less effects odds getting sick sick. doctors saying constantly. know CDC tough job situation fluid, they’ve constantly shooting foot. Like Holiday thing last week. smelling larger particles come combustion. Think smoke inside vs outside. Outside, smoke almost immediately dissipates. Inside, hovers, long periods time. on-going experiments drugs already use.

“ ACTIV-6 master protocol designed test effectiveness repurposed drugs (drugs FDA-approved non-COVID-19 indications known safety profiles) reducing duration severity symptoms associated mild-to-moderate COVID-19. large, randomized, placebo‑controlled Phase 3 trial enroll participants least 30 years old, tested positive SARS-CoV-2 infection show two mild-to-moderate symptoms COVID-19 seven days. Drugs demonstrate efficacy reducing symptoms mild-to-moderate COVID-19 evaluated effects clinical outcomes (hospitalization, mortality) long-term COVID-19 Can't fix stupid. Unlike vaccines, tool treatment, protect general population.

Hence, deny scientific, fact-based results want take it, applied Darwinism. I've wondered smelling someone's cigarette smoke outside yet said unlikely breath airborne virus around you. Maybe different all. Sometimes smell cigarette smoke close, sometimes far windy.....if someone high viral load outside, sneezes gross droplets wind carries, similar? guess that's getting at...... completely understand hospitals facilities already understaffed several places, I’m going go grain say I’m actually pretty glad many willfully-ignorant idiots leaving medical field. submission linking msn.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Ground-glass opacities CXR noted people without symptoms (both pre-symptomatic phase totally asymptomatic infection).

Being outdoors it’s breezy means need distance indoors?  analysis problematic. 

It address proportion attendees vaccinated proportion respondees were. Trying draw literally conclusion (other maybe ""it's possible vaccinated people infected"") nonsense.  American 😂 Yeah turns GradeAunderA Fucking lol absurdddd.  Cope, dòómer.    World B. Flat. Biden compel private businesses?

The answer same; raw naked power. I'm pretty sure game power, feds win. Considering virus endemic that's ok. could still help UK alot mass testing still like almost 1m day given population 67m that's quite alot covid tests per capita. there's also fact started vaccinating teens recently inevitably lot teens start catching covid(though thankfully risk low begin with). Combine fact they've zero restrictions since July even face masks longer mandatory. 

Although tbh I'd say rather encouraging looking data. mean cases roughly similar level case rates back January sky high since July. time deaths risen marginally risen still fairly low. 7DA 123 highest went recently 143. Compared January levels hard lockdown similar case rates getting 1,200+ deaths day. Hospitalizations also remained lower January peak. anything data also proves effective vaccines preventing hospitalizations still catch covid. you’ve covid Moderna vaccine, nothing says need booster. happy strongest protection all, infected + best vaccine.

Wtf..? live 1 county son recovering corvid due circumstances, masks required ridiculous. classmates teacher well. see anything NEAR magnitude last year BASIC measure's place.

I'd like know get suit going. Pro-vaccine, anti vaccine mandate supposed make sympathetic towards Doom? makes sound like dipshit me.

I’m pretty upset. Oh no! Anyways...   We’ve seen worst Texas I’m surprise. Abbott would definitely cut nose spite face.  Sounds like shitty way go life.  Nobody needed here, decided anyway. People claimed injecting tiny vial vaccine somehow changes DNA, wonder people would problem installing couple pounds organ body entirely made someone else's DNA. surprised. certainly shocked behavior parents. 

I'm saying keep kids lockdown, also see reason take unnecessary risks either.

For example, eating indoors restaurant, even husband (daughter stays w/ grandparents) worth us potentially getting breakthrough case infecting her. what? meal? Risk getting kid sick eat out? plenty people exactly that. 

They're convinced ""low risk"" means ""no risk"" never going happen them. Chances are, they're right, anyone become unlucky one. Hello, fellow Washingtonian! lose sleep tonight large pharmaceutical company may lose profits.  That’s ridiculous.  definition over?

When daughter vaccinated. 

This going sound cold, perhaps compassion fatigue, that, care unvaccinated. get vaccine, not. Wear mask, not. take precautions party like 1999. Get Covid, not.

Social behaviors associated substance usage means higher viral loads per exposure.

Ergo - vaccination rates sky rocketed back close 100% (there medical exemptions real doctors allowed).

Honestly - vaccine mandates worked like charm push people getting kids vaccinated. Since kicked pre-school Dr.Sears space vaccine craziness went poof toward CDC recommended guidelines.

Are therefore, disproportionately, referring black New Yorkers. California mandate going effect October 15th. mandate require teachers K-12 public private settings vaccinated, submit weekly testing. 

If teacher refuses vaccination mandate comply testing feel free contact California School Board Association alert individual. understand impatience. certainly hoping get booster well.  issue Moderna based antibody count holding much better Pfizer. Pfizer induced antibodies start waning 6 months, Moderna’s not. Moderna used larger dosage. antibody count also proxy; really reactivity B cells matter. FDA need decide based data booster worthwhile. 

As friend, there’s way know booster would prevented getting infected. still high level active antibodies unless something else wrong. 

As someone works scientific field, science difficult time-consuming. don’t know correct answers ahead time. Leon County, Tallahassee, state capital, located It'd pain could track vaccinated allow employees vaxxed fly airports. think it'd way bigger hassle/cost requiring everyone vaxxed they're caving. believe ever claim professional.  take all.

I done fear mongering. Bye! Texas' ban appears run afoul Supremacy Clause Article VI US Constitution. authority mandates traceable constitution either directly indirectly laws passed Congress:

* vaccine mandate federal workers contractors inherent president's executive powers Article II Section 1.

* mandate businesses 100+ employees OSH Act 1970, passed Congress Necessary Proper Clause Interstate Commerce Clause Article Section 8.

* mandate hospitals condition receiving federal Medicare Medicaid funding part Power Purse Article Section 9.

The constitutionally tenable position Texas take enforce federal mandates, falling back unfunded mandate argument.

A mandate ban appears constitutionally unenforceable. anyone reaching 6 month mark post vax looking getting booster? even possible right US even concern mine? I'm healthy issues.

Pfizer. aren't. Long term immunity comes cells b cells. generally maintain antibody levels life, level wanes significantly. maintain population cells recognize pathogen quickly mobilize production antibodies. not? mandate requires?

The politics says need protection.

So guess... trust politics. Where's mystery? Olympics almost certainly caused spike people left, population kept wearing masks like always did. start calling 'vaccine hesitant'? use term we've always had, 'anti-vaxers'?

Why need another stupid term somehow mask one group idiots compared another group idiots? got J&amp;J I'm immunocompromised. Mayo Clinic told get Pfizer booster. mean “hyperinflammation” vaccine?

My point reeeeeee like outcome weeeeeee! comes states attempting supersede feds. Given criteria, approved everyone stay home recluses WFH. problem accepting scientifically pandemic vaccinated areas soon. I’m skeptical people’s ability socially move on. Covid intertwined moral issue, people struggling resume behaviors one time considered immoral. They're Christian. say stem cell line 60s used. Remember people expect problem solve fly, make kind compassionate decisions, know law lawyers go school 4 years pass really hard exam practice give power kill people order enforce said laws really don’t know.

Thank personally know he’s best person sound mind I’m glad he’s this. know fact crazy  96% doctors vaccinated anti vax doctors there. Unfortunately, vocally anti-vax get latched onto spread around worse covid. no, Moderna booster (third shot) yet approved unless immune compromised, age withstanding.

They compared IQ tests people previously infected people not. could people less intelligent give shit pandemic effects virus simply went party fun. can't control that.

What need call back certain amount people taken IQ test pandemic, see got infected meantime, compare tests previous results, compare new results infected non-infected people, etc.

AWWWW POOPOO PEEEPEEE difference. give ground. looking forward, need wary ""booster hesitant"", term I've already seen.

It comes making people something want workplace protecting workforce protecting employees customers people choose potentially spread completely preventable virus. get lots vaccines throughout lives detrimental effect

Yes, understand motivation vaccinate. chose get vaccinated. ran private business, would consider requiring employees vaccinate. However, comes state, think heavy onus falls upon citizens order determine exactly threshold risk breached order consider using force state fellow citizens. estimation, COVID, although devastating, cross risk threshold order comfortable that. importantly, available vaccines (mRNA/viral vector), impressive feats science/medicine, radical departure technology ever deployed scale, combination novel antigen, think sufficient reason people uncomfortable taking vaccine. remotely comfortable mandate, would personally need available vaccines either attenuated virus vaccine, synthetic protein vaccine (Novavax), even then...I would seriously conflicted mandate.

And two things consider we're actually serious done here. one, notion antibody test sufficient demonstrate alternatively acquired immunity absurd. scientifically literate person would contest this, fact proof immune response counted towards mandates US proof entire thing tainted political nonsense.

The second determining role vaccines pertains spread disease conversation drastically altered Delta changing profile immunity vaccine efficacy wanes. vaccines demonstrated highly efficacious infectivity spread 2 months vaccination, presence antibodies rapidly diminishes. remaining efficacy longer-lasting T-Cell immunity, primarily provides protection hospitalization death, fast enough prevent infection spread rapidly reproducing Delta variant. conversation regarding vaccines, framed it, entirely accurate. Vaccines administered months ago playing seriously diminished role regards epidemiological aspect pandemic, terms protecting individual actually received vaccine worst outcomes disease. Alberta, Canada, peers head, wanting join  ""I'm promoting random ass belief""

Ideally want low viral load. Eric, used love music, DEAD now. STOP CELEBRITIES/ATHLETES/ANYBODY NOTE TWEET COVID THEY'VE VACCINATED

I'm sorry, vaccines proven wildly effective reducing death/serious illness. need getting people riled caught post-vax Covid. paid vacation glass half full way looking it. Another way looking would forfeiting \~16 million dollars. Haha, important take stuff seriously. Everyone extent often blinded bias. really really hard it.

And that's say I'm better, definitely thoughts hardcore go wrong. Idk are, naturally given topic! 😂 Look cult deprogramming techniques. would bet there’s lot great stuff. You’re alone this! No. Stop. Don’t. really hope Pfizer boosters approved groups. seems pretty compelling evidence (from Israel, among others) limited 65 med conditions.

Similarly, Moderna may dropped much, seems dropped (per studies I've read), tho much evidence Pfizer. Makes wonder take longer drop (the load Moderna apparently something like 3 time vax load Pfizer, plus extra week shots). Could difference due timing amount shots, vs actual 'makeup vaccine'? Sucks right answer, 100% is. Far likely find better job elsewhere better pay get request raise approved. least handing letter resignation informing found better opportunity elsewhere. point try lure back promise raise--which gets stuck sort bureaucratic black hole dumb enough take word.

Not I've done anything. Definitely not, definitely get look absolute astonishment HR resubmitted letter 6 weeks later, citing failure approve raise even update yet. Like thought go find another job soon realized full shit fucked. I'm different you, ... would depend number cases/deaths. \*know\* yet, but, given experience viruses states/countries, no, mandate every winter.

There vaccinations (especially approved kids), reduce transmissibility; better treatments, people surviving infections getting natural immunity; reduce impact COVID, especially public health issue.

There also behavioral changes. people work home, classes online, people wear mask even without mandate; fist bumps fewer hand shakes. 

I definitely wrong, I'd surprised widespread mask mandates late 2022. Lol south , people still mask work . People either going tested vaccinated eventually especially federal funded jobs. Amazon , Mc Donalds , Disney, etc big companies already making things mandatory. gonna escape ??? Federal trump's state laws.

Imagine caring Moderna losing negligible amount money. multi billion dollar company.

Isn't governing body medical licenses? think medical professional causing harm would allowed practice. moderna listed there?  Either I’m immune it, I’ve already before.

Unfortunately immune system complicated that. fully understand exactly causes exposure lead infection, definitely complicated immune aren't.

* First, immune system made two broad parts: [innate immune [adaptive immune former mechanisms keep germs away body general like skin, mucus nose, etc., latter things like antibodies, B cells, cells learn identify fight specific pathogens. Sometimes get exposed virus, innate immune system able stop becomes real problem. Otherwise, usually takes adaptive immune system time mount response, sometimes notice (maybe little extra tired couple days even enough register sick) get noticeable symptoms like cold/fever.
* There's lot talk ""viral load"". Basically, viral infection made **a lot** viral particles. exposed single viral particle, almost certainly fail infect you. exposed enough, virus much higher chance getting foothold managing become significant infection. Asymptomatic people probably transmit fewer viral particles than, say, someone coughing you, although evidence transmit enough get someone else sick, mean always will.

This study 100ug Moderna, Moderna asking 50ug boosters. unclear difference would be.

In study, 100ug Moderna looks mostly best, Pfizer far behind. boosters significantly raised antibodies.

It's clear (unlikely?) FDA/CDC going authorized mix/match boosters based study alone, many limitations, even Moderna boosters authorized all.

Why? people believe vaccines, harmful selfish idiots, ""people different belief"". benefited getting vaccines lives, things like Mumps, Diptheria Typhus, Pertussis, Polio, Chickenpox, Measles, Hepatitis B, Rubella, among others. benefited people getting vaccines too, get illnesses prior vaccine. 

People refuse vaccines endangering others. understand that, there's reasoning you. ""It would nice eventually get back wear masks.""

How long think people need wear masks planes? 100% vaccination isnt enough remove environments already air filters, hope wear one everywhere go matter with, youre living fantasy world.  dad sadly these.

Also, countries world deal dumbasses. holy shit knew easy get rid ignorant assholes. line thinking used lot pandemic, something absolute worth doing. Masks 100% bother, vaccines 100% bother etc. 

It's numbers, somebody 70% less likely transmit catch covid wearing mask worth it. vaccine. said taxes going reduced 70% would worth it? 

I'm 100% sold mandate general public certain professions high risk (food prep) unavoidable (police, healthcare, grocery store) national security (armed forces) brainer. 

Another serious issue misrepresentation statistics. see bother 99% survival rate? Well 99% hospitals swamped even 99%, that's everyone averaged per infection. seeing multiple infections unvaxxed people, 1% fatality rate could every 3 months. look risks mutations could result either less deadly virulent strain. mutation risk. crux issue, prepared take small risk vaccination (0.0018% ?) protect elders much higher risk death even vaccinated. Personally, see duty so. Others self centric decision making process. 

Covid could isolated, could defeated. needed transparency China early on, needed stronger health service bodies correct, politically expedient overlords. needed actually lock country wide closed borders earlier. let get ahead us long time, mention reservoirs infections wild animals. 20% Hungary’s population 65+.  dispute ""sort true"". Boosters prevent infections \~10 fold lower short term minimum Pfizer Moderna similar vaccine, similar waning efficacy, Moderna's new data shows antibody levels boosters similar Pfizer boosters, etc.

But get wrong: matter FDA decides, trivial decision. 100% agree yes/no question based reduction infections. **very** complicated indeed.

My simpler point **any** decision ""trusting science"". already countries authorized Moderna boosters, countries not.

The reason **not** countries ""trust science"" countries ""don't trust science"". think great Italy accepting recent natural immunity green pass. sense logic gone window like US. definition science politically rewritten. numbers easily comparable. 

In link posted above, 65% amount total population (includes children young vaccinated). narrowed adults only, number 76.6%.

Your link percentage people aged 12+, seem way show data adults. Either way, clearly SJC number higher NYC. question much.

But reliable - honestly idea is, site found search compare metropolitan areas - NYC metro area higher vaccination rate next 4 largest metro areas (LA, Chicago, Houston, Phoenix). say... ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Italy little weird see argue you. sure become long argument though.

Almost 25% italy’s population 65+. don’t think it’s fair establish fatality rate them. Even found damning evidence lab-created China, still admit it. China we're talking here. talking hypothetical nobody discussing. Nobody's saying remove masks. Cool. Good. Moving city stuff. lost war, COVID stay'

I'm aware single shutdown last six months, stadiums filling state fairs held. went state fair state Labor Day. Many workers masks smattering masks crowds least 80% crowds unmasked. I'm guessing drove positive tests. state appears peaked last week, see.

My point is, first sharp downtrend united states due shutdowns curfews govt begging people gather. one could argue post-summer decline like after-christmas decline, people ""done gathering"" weather (north), ""done gathering inside"" longer hot outside (south). last CDC mandate could find subway/bus related Feb 1st - March 9th? 2021 (not sure end date).

Someone saw comment linked below. Much appreciated. can't fuck dog day get vaccinated night. Fuckin' embarrassing. 24 COVID threatening scraped knee. don’t even bother ‘they spread it’. 

Sure, ignore one main reasons vaccinate spreading shit around. Vaccinated, unvaccinated, dogs, cats. It’s good.

The good old ""do nothing approach"". googled it, answer got. 35% 2.87 billion people. could wrong. vaccines protect severe illness well. You’re losing plot here

Severe Illness thing people allowed care about. booster helps prevent getting illness that's big deal lot people, even care personally. I’m hesitant say anything safe hasn’t authorized yet. countries it, Canada, seemed work well them.

The NIH vaccine mix match presentation Friday’s fda advisory committee, released study today: personally (and giving advice it), feeling it’s almost certainly safe works well, wouldn’t want deal logistical headache getting something isn’t approved, particularly sneaky deceitful get it, likely right now. Could cause knows unknown logistical problems future (such improper vaccine card two cards since trick pharmacy, problems card accepted something, insurance company dinging getting something isn’t approved, etc).  African American vaccination rate NYC whites 98% survivable also completely terrible survival rate. get car accident, higher survival rate that, yet I'm still going put seat belt. costs nothing reduces risk death. New Yorkers rejoice.

I'd thrilled city vaccine mandate moron antivaxxers left. COME TEXAS Please don’t relo Philadelphia Go ahead add La, Ms, Al one miss make one big country own. many people US lie? considered overweight.

That's Pfizer. Moderna approved ""third dose"" short list innumocompromised conditions. current discussion approving booster similar set people Pfizer approved for. Nobody wants work! (fine print: terrible wages). agree 100% idea you’re talking colleges? never said anything colleges serve Jury August. Driving back forth courthouse everyday bigger risk getting vaccine.

Course getting vaccine would bigger risk far. Agreed. born Floridian craziest people know aren’t even here. old people. Stop sending broken people. 50% unvaxed 42% population vs 58% unvaxed 24% population
So total population 21% unvaccinated white vs 14% unvaccinated Black.
There unvaccinated white people black NYC guess comes trusting involved approval process... trust them. good reason too.  


As far approval speed... fools rush in. 


I need trust people ""much smarter"" am... bc choice, freedom. I've already COVID, get vaccine established \*rare\* side effects? say they're immunocompromised, there's proof anything. mom sure waiting evidence came out

I hear lot people want lie waiting approval. family members planning getting Moderna booster first day available interested claiming immunocompromised get illicit third dose. absolutely shitty narrative framing going much media frightening fuck. Everyone going amygdala give fuck anything except engagement clicks *laughs Montgomery County TX*

It blows mind year half people FDA CDC still asking ""Is something absolutely \*need\*?"" instead ""Could help?"" know boosters help. know similar side effects initial shots. what's problem? feel like already figured right way Pfizer boosters - people 18+ basically said ""We think everyone needs one want get booster go ahead, stand way"". wish they'd move along Moderna J&amp;J. least fully bless mixing brands people happen get Pfizer first round luck. I’m interested long would take could become standard Covid-19 treatment protocol.  countries ban Moderna younger people Good 50% unvaxed 42% population vs 58% unvaxed 24% population

So total population 21% unvaccinated white vs 14% unvaccinated Black. 

There unvaccinated white people black NYC Black flight According NYTimes 48.9% world population. massively impressive logistics effort. Truly amazing see People think that.

If 5 years crazy parasitic outbreak ivermectin solution, promise would large number left-leaning Americans would refuse ivermectin like people refuse vaccines. 

They're people, dumbest ones right equals left. anecdotal feel need say husband currently dealing breakthroughs moderna, think bulletproof thats doc said. (Though I'm sure still careful!) said, know people pfizer breakthroughs. I'm hoping Moderna booster approved, remember brand new study, *new* reason approve Moderna booster.

There finally *some* data mixing matching 3 US approved vaccines 9 combinations, currently authorized due lack data.

So example, indicates J&amp;J people need boosters, mRNA boosters may give significantly better results J&amp;J boosters... possible Moderna slightly better Pfizer here, though look pretty good.

2. takes time small group people exposed subject pathogen wild. vaccine trials nowadays pathogens rare. 

When run Phase III trial middle pandemic, conditions don’t apply anymore. end 40,000 participants doesn’t take long control group starts getting infected. That’s vaccines tested quickly. 30+ years development underlying technologies.

From outsiders perspective anyways, city life seems like sucks general. Isn’t obvious anyone would support drunk driving laws? comparison made thousands times it’s apples oranges. 

Drunk driving laws around nearly 100 years since 1925. 

One doesn’t take unwanted vaccine driving drunk. aren’t given shot will. Listen, want many people get vaxxed possible think best themselves.

Edit: I’m trying figure logic flawed. I’m Reddit it’s enough fully vaxxed opinion everyone jabbed kicking screaming wishes? Dec. 14, 2020, Nemerson referred day ""D-Day battle COVID."" Tuesday's briefing, said wrong informed attendees COVID-19 longer pandemic, lost war. COVID stay,"" Nemerson said. ""Because can't vaccinate enough public eradicate it.""

Scientists health care workers world moved heaven earth create vaccines manufacture billions doses 18 months. achievement go history one great triumphs 21st century. 

I cannot emphasize enough demoralizing health care workers cannot get Americans take goddamn miracle vaccine. 

We pay price failure decades come. One dose shows effort somewhat, still  study last year VA basically proved this, went undiscussed throughout entire two major pandemic waves around world. various usernames ranted eighteen solid months.

The total disintegration primary care respected institution immeasurable costs population US. thank you, sounds pretty mild  Interesting case study itself. Charging people insurance results 90% compliance. Threatening fire people results well 99% compliance. Offering people chance win lottery even $100 gift cards getting vaccinated results barely 60% compliance.

If people like ""stick"" take ""carrot"" often. matter advisory committee says..I suspect CDC give go ahead far, significant danger seems potential benefit based prelim studies. 

I mean, admin explore use traditional avenue get infection/hospitalization rates even small bit. Yes I'm aware position, I'm clarifying appropriate framing issue is. Either bought fake vax cards apparently sale now.

People crazy, whole covid/anti-mask/anti-vax situation shows many crazy. This. ""Science"" tell us whether giving boosters. gives us insight potential costs benefits giving them. Policy makers weigh costs benefits according value systems. Two people agree science says, disagree appropriate policy response. except said ""no"" Delta \*more\* transmissible variants (5x, think?). 5x transmissible indoors, 5x transmissible outdoors ... highly transmissible? call.

Transmission risk outdoors much smaller indoors (delta not), vaccination reduces chances something like 10x-20x, crowded place increases risk. risk particular event also small. super-hard give accurate number.

How risk averse you? much want go event? much masks annoy you? Well yes. endemic. doubt it'd make much difference since someone infected COVID infectious symptoms appear. Actually, that's may contagious. unlikely would know theyre contagious virus late.   problem they're officially considering protection hospitalization. dropped yet, based trial participants know coming. 

There's lots experts disagree many reasons (contrary one brilliant poster thought, something invented serious expert thinks) probably contentious try squeeze things past experts committed ignoring mild moderate infection. China: ""lol no""   ulcerative colitis got third (full) dose Moderna 6mo post 2nd shot. Side effects similar second shot, felt like flu/hangover. I'm glad got full dose, I'm pretty gnarly immunesupressant therapy :D entitled old piece shit turned be. depends. Maple Leafs fan? I'm suuuuure CCP would cooperate. One reasons is:
“Active treatment high-dose corticosteroids drugs may suppress immune response”

I friend told Walgreens taking high dose prednisone got first two shots got booster problem. 

PS…if forget card they’ll give new one 3rd dose it. Hypothetically speaking could remember bring card 5 6 months booster accidentally get 4th shot…  really understand hype around this. got shot like vax wear mask sometimes. hard Im sure people get day... don’t like don’t like don’t like 

Vaccine fully cooperate fully, I'll take damning evidence itself. Rofl! exactly. know nothing Candian law, hospital setting sounds like good idea. chance someone can't vaxxed medical reasons want worry tangent. want see family? Yeah, others. Well there's new low ""keep calm"" propaganda.

But case, I'm going freak out--I'm going directly nearest Regen-cov infusion site, taxpayers pay $1500 infusion, FDA panel still approved essentially free Moderna vaccine booster would almost utterly eliminate possibility breakthrough infection. know almost one see this, hoping helps you. forget person behind theory, South Park actually right this. 

The correct answer two fold

1. Lay information clearly non politically possible (this done certain extent sides still highly political it)
2. SAY ANYTHING. engage, feel sorry, happy, mad, anything say regarding subject. Let stew mind solitude. hard social media.

The reason works easy find mistakes / grow one pressuring to. allows escape method 'just telling anyone' ect ect. problem people hate wrong, 'betray tribe.' things combine, take lot change opinion, best way let think without outside pressure. pressure applied often make double opinions already formed. American never summer homework. lived across various states growing east coast west coast. never thing me. Uhhh. concerts go year ago?  risk incurred others remaining unvaccinated (compared vaccinated) sufficiently high, risk incurred vaccinated sufficiently low, comfortable forcing people vaccinate? 

Yes support drunk driving laws mandates deadly airborne disease stopped whole world 2 years. admit logic doesn’t make sense.

Tell support drunk driving laws.  Yup. Pro-vax scientific-minded here. Generally early-adopter I've wearing N95's realizing SARS1 already known airborne meant SARS2 likely well, despite WHO/CDC first said.

I trust scientists, CDC, FDA, etc. saw much early messaging tilted towards ""what's best whole country"" propaganda trying incite panic vs. communicating reality severe lockdowns needed.

I trust profit-motivated pharmaceutical companies pushed soon, capitalism pushing hard everyone get back work regardless safety. I've waiting make sure another [Dengue vaccine (where vaccinated first made actually infected later *worse*) unknown-unknown pops like major autoimmune problems 2 years out. (Though point feel vaccines unlikely major issues like that)

Also perverse disincentives... workplace continue provide SARS2 rapid antigen tests undeclared vaccination status/unvaccinated. feel like good idea *everyone* keep tested regularly even vaccinated least hospital capacity stabilizes. Even vaccinated want prove status workplace, feel that's medical information they're entitled have.
- - work pushing everyone back office ASAP vaccinated... they're wearing masks, feel good idea current non-sterilizing vaccines since they're going spread SARS2 hospital capacities still maxed out.

I totally fine continuing take strict precautions, eat anywhere indoors, etc. get much information make best decisions. definitely looking like getting vaccinated right away would've better decision waiting, I'm fine taken risk yet. (Oh, I've kept advised others *to get vaccinated* concerns would probably turn OK).
Apparently latest research info Canada shows delaying time 1st &amp; 2nd mRNA doses 4 months provides 11% increase protection hospitalization vs. shorter weeks gap, that's good know. feel like could remove ""even virtual war"". straight weaponized virus disinformation, blew back them. Oh god they’re gonna come Texas 🥴 comparing different circumstances. delta now, plus open country, plus behavior changes people, vaccines. 

If want see effect vaccines, need compare variety settings (since cannot run controlled experiments). hell point? means Kyrie essentialy gets paid vacation, incentivising anyone get vaccinated?! I'd stick Pfizer. least short-term, know effective. immunity wanes, we'll know first (thanks Israel), easier know get next booster compared getting one dosings Moderna. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, partly depends age sex. Healthy young males probably avoid Moderna boosters higher risk side effects less gain. Yeah, there's reason need federal mandate. odds surviving fully recovering monumentally better vaccinated, though. Diease vectors lol get grip. Oh horror, im vaccinated might get common cold symptoms oh lord save me. havent concerned virus since April 2020 im gonna get concerned. vocal concerned group I've met whole thing country people line. Ive damn near coast coast work people really care. “They want shoot people” incredibly lazy take. 60 million interactions police public 2018. 1,000 people killed police (41 unarmed). 

Are bad cops? Absolutely. also get punished appropriately. reform absolutely essential, say want kill people lazy true. isn’t true all. guys want seem loving caring spread hate platforms. It’s disgusting. stop calling “vaccine hesitant” like real reason avoid point call are? Antivaxer fucking idiot fine. matter fact think drunk driving laws relaxed. 

That doesn’t change fact strongly disapprove vaccine mandate. hoping someone would mention purple onion tea! 


First all, stupid person taxi driver tell someone go hospital someone struggles breathing? ""Duurrr durr they're gonna kill there, better suffocate home""? 

Purple onion motherfucking tea? family counting lucky stars buying lottery tickets man survived covid. different ivermectin fanatics? #Don’t let door hit ass!  A: ""Only 1% people get corvid die/get seriously ill.""

B: ""Only 1% employees required get vaccinated, quit.""

If concern people, see B be. 15 unvaccinated friends finally got covid past month living life normal past year half. sniffles, took week work perfectly fine.Covid kill everyone gets 🙄 survived never take useless shot. lived life normally, without masks isolating still outcome take precautions. yeah...who stupid one think authorize 100mcg dose reject 50 first place almost result probably big decrease adverse effects. nothing value lost.  Probably combination Delta relaxing restrictions. I’m sure probably exemptions medical conditions like PEG allergies anaphylactic reaction vaccine places. Happy Cakeday! Except land free saying, ingrained legal fact. Specifically vaccines mandates entirely scope federal governments power drive vaccine mandates every person country.

Vaccine mandates argued back days polio settled then.

Today covid causes disruption global scales, freedom movement states single state vaccinating threatens commerce medical systems surrounding states. federal level issue state coordinate neighbors effectively federal government can.

I also find personal medical freedom touted hypocritical people met use excuse. use basis banning abortions, right self determined death. Seeing fine 2 regulated government's prying, vaccines controlled?

And unlike 2, vaccines direct immediate health consequence people around individual question. Pregnancy contagious all. Covid is. Americans cope hard pretending reactionary bullshit tried true American tradition? Canadian thought much higher tbh, 71.9% entire Canadian population fully vaxxed, places Canada obviously much higher rate.  Yeah got mine around April Friday. Monday morning woke sweaty little off. called sick feeling better afternoon. hypothesized perform poorly found mRNA+AZ worse mRNA+mRNA AZ+mRNA.

The trend (including heterologous mRNA study) seems weaker vaccine followed stronger one good, reverse good simply two doses stronger one. leave individuals unable receive due legitimate medical conditions? Seems like they’re lost crossfire. parts bolded literally true. sure think creative writing. Interactions strangers carry exposure risk. Different people going different tolerances risk and, article claims, answer reduce points physical interaction. Great. They'll probably move island *we'll* deal them. think share antivaxxers already. Toronto: joke you?  see ya, luddites! Making one concession, them, like house cards. means everything could deserve self-evaluation. 

Any reasonable human already self-evaluates time time, nothing new threatening. folks don't. mean heavily tied something identity changing mind akin death self (in eyes)? death person appeared others? mean peer group treat like traitor?

I mean, means get new friends means maybe really take look yourself, strengths. fact see deep moral failings. view weak. fun surrounded disease vectors wondering going get breakthrough, worrying variants. Also, people occasion loud, obnoxious, aggressive. around see it. Yay! Buh Nah they'd throw bunch misinformation cause increasingly.

Look vaccines. clearly protect serious disease yet people believe  36. signed Walgreen's site. even bend truth, said Pfizer booster secured appointment. Signing state's system let me, signing Walgreen's website straightforward easy. surprise racist fuck.. think it’s vaccine they’re told do. They’re used giving orders, can’t fathom shoe foot. Well danger 2 shots still high enough require masks, follow regular people strong enough immune response yet.  may Thanksgiving highly vaccinated states (like Northeast), especially children age 5-11 get vaccinated November.

I one vaxed counties one vaxed states (Maryland). need get kids vaccinated yesterday, boosters everyone vaccinated 6 months ago (lets stop charade 2 shots 3 - 4 weeks apart --- one shot J&amp;J adequate long term protection -- not. Data countries shown 3 week spacing Pfizer doses great short term weak long term, example). 

We going need wear KN-95 type masks public places.

We cannot let guard down. People June. 

In long term need make sure get much vaccine meds parts world.

Someone needs make vaccine formulated (and powered) Delta variants. COVID game town days vaccinating strain circulated almost two years ago.

Also, need proactive things scientists CDC FDA data want (they way slow highly reactive)  13 months second third doses?

I'm person replying to, think meant Moderna clinical trial, got two doses really early relative general population, already gotten third dose.  he's definitely backside career.

That's sensationalist. He's 29 coming statistically great season. Well advisory committee compromised government employees.

Despite test positivity rate 0.08%, refusing stop testing us weekly. missing something, make sense? anything, gives wrong perception vaccines work well, absolutely do! 

From perspective, clear COVID spreading campus. university already moved goalposts several times weekly testing go away, even though positivity rates gone literally every week since arrived campus. first modeling cases going accurate, 2 weeks positive data. 4 weeks ""2 weeks"" they're telling us testing around ""foreseeable future"".

Definitely Chesapeake officials taking dangers Covid kids seriously. absolutely right. I've seen make drug argument before, perceive tells lot perspective.

It really interesting topic discuss.

Thanks back-and-forth. paragraph prior says People used marijuana 7.8 percent greater risk experiencing breakthrough infections, even though marijuana users trend younger age fewer underlying health troubles.

Not sure there's contradictory information article Same, kids 2 4 called big family Thanksgiving again. Plattsburgh mall better prepared onslaught Le Quebecois.  Many kids overweight grow it. living overtly unhealthy lives. Whether realize form fat shaming via fat blaming. 

If trying take expressway YTA, one direct way it. solid social safety net. regards Covid specifically, think lot working class people don’t trust medical establishment feel routinely rips off. Air movement usually notice outside - even still-feeling day, air moving indoors. Also sunlight - virus denatures really fast light. evidence substantial outdoor transmission right now. 

Think - lots people like basically spend extended time indoors non-household members wear high-quality masks. lot outdoor transmission, people like would getting covid would pretty clear getting park, etc. even worse lmfao pathetic using name get stuff high disregard others. 


either way he’s guy won’t get vaccinated looks like tool. $15 million dollars drain reason Wisconsinite here. confirm anything outside Milwaukee Madison “real American” Care explain study statistically underpowered? Okay, that's genetics. awful? Generally curious Even vaccines, would happen eventually. respiratory pandemics history lasted couple years even without modern medicine.  legalized murder, yeah kinda rather surprised turned pro vaccine. great but, see Biden signs rural Wisconsin. That's shift.  denmark, Sweden , norway, America, East europe, UK wont places end mandates 2022 ? feel like I’m teased this, seems they’ve settled first weeks November. I’m curious see younger kids there’s much info them. Well stated. I’m really making argument - opinion see others might perceive pot vs vax support moving goalposts. 

You’re obviously schooled law can’t disagree anything laid out.  I'm regularly trump territory Wisconsin, beautiful land lot dumb ass people. actually Biden signs there, even saw ""trump lost lol"" sign UP, hope slowly changing here. beginning yes. actually dont think lying. basically willing lock single case, mass test release. 

Its going interesting see happens long term. measures sustainable borders hard closed. happens 2023? 2025? wonder long population tolerate this. want clarify things. Many, arguably most, overweight children come low income families. considering may necessarily eating much nutrition facts they're eating. Even bread, staple low income homes, spiked unnecessary sugar. Second, health foods expensive making budget many poor families. Lastly, mentioned exercise. lot kids live neighborhoods conducive frequent outdoor activity. Usually needs adult supervision often homes parents work home enough supply recreational time kids. course could point kids living conditions again, responsible current circumstances. US created perfect storm poor health obesity within impoverished low income communities. 

I think considering social implications important blaming child weight. Typically there's far consider ""they eat much exercise enough."" Deep fry Anti-vaccine sentiments truly baffling.

Essentially sore arm 30 minutes chills following day Thank you. reason I'm getting downvoted reason Delta ravaging half country right now.  Air exchange. Many buildings relatively poor ventilation. indoor air remains stagnant aerosolized particles linger, becoming concentrated time, therefore increasing risk transmission. 

Being outside allows better quicker dispersion aerosolized particles. hangs friends there, make sure families ""quarantined"" two weeks first.

As far consequences, grandmother living us, asthma health issues, including son. I'm much less worried socialization issues one million chance dying. He'll fine socially think. ""so means he’s literally sitting home cause can’t go places without vaccine card""

We talking Kyrie Irving random dude... pretty sure go places without vaccine card lol. Covid Classic, much better New Covid. stuff awful. odds sooner later catch covid, give mama, grandma say, hope Drop bucket compared the, it, 3.5 trillion government spent last year ”fix” economy lockdowns NPI measures destroyed it. Pretty sure spent trillions year, haven’t paid close attention preserve sanity. ...not till he's vaccinated, no. see couple problems argument.

First, prosecutorial discretion around centuries pre-dates United States. tradition rooted older English law. well-established practice correlate levels trust government.

Second, federalism US means police powers follow federal/state divide legislation. Federal officers enforce federal laws state officers enforce state laws. State officers may arrest people federal charges turn federal government (and vice versa) jurisdiction state laws they're charged enforce.

The federal government fund federal law enforcement pursue low-level offenders (e.g., casual marijuana users). enough DEA agents. means prosecutorial discretion necessary requirement law order want DEA focus violent dangerous offenders, pose risk society.

Nevertheless, maintaining federal laws still gives federal government leverage low-level offenders offering immunity exchange information serious offenders).

I agree marijuana legalized nationwide I'm looking forward day happens, federal marijuana laws really apples-to-apples comparison federal mask mandates.

A apt comparison would Texas refusing enforce federal vaccine mandates, authority do.  merch local sales right now, focusing selling beer online.

No mandatory testing *possibly* affects infection statistics = true

More infections leads hospitalisations=true

No mandatory testing affects hospitalisation numbers = false

Not knowing infections would affect “10x less likely hospitalised” statistic”. knowing infections affect percentage vaccinated vs unvaccinated treated Covid hospital. person hospital, they’re either treated Covid they’re not. know patients are, correct? know ones vaccinated, correct? understand unknown infections affects two points. White House confirmed Tuesday night fully vaccinated visitors Canada welcomed land border crossings next month; however, officials would specify vaccines would accepted mixed doses meet eligibility tests  Coworker unexpectedly took long term medical leave back problems he’s years, we’re guessing it’s avoid vaccine mandate.

Picking entirely random drugs EML reference see Atropine, Diazepam, Insulin. 3 examples entirely different classes drugs cause overdoses used improperly. 

Ivermectin mainly used treat parasites humans animals. work rare cases things, including flaviviruses like Dengue WNV. However, its' efficacy SARS-CoV-2 well documented.

Singapore considers recovered patient + 1 dose fully vaccinated (~50k people). also ~200k sinovac doses (~100k people) administered private clinics, people want MRNA vaccines. figures probably aren’t included source.

Population counts source also probably accurate (it [fallen since start pandemic).

These 3 factors may address discrepancies. First 28% people 15% adults fringe. 45% country still vaccinated.

In many cases, may even get opposite situation: vaccinated people may feel get away taking *fewer* precautions. Right - aspirin reduces risk heart attack stroke, also increases risk dangerous/fatal bleeding (especially older people). risk bleeding worth already heart attack stroke before, general population risk worth benefit. shh.... memo said keep quiet that, remember! Counterpoint: Idaho *so much* vaccine we're throwing away every day! vaccine! I'm part volunteer study got booster last week

- 4 weeks vs 3 weeks doses, also effect durability protection Time update resume seek employment elsewhere, going get better there.  want covid stick around multiple years?

Alpha variant almost ended life. Delta almost ended niece's life faces recovery may never come. Good. That's quite logic there. basically let summarize... CDC suggests vaccinated people still need mask control spread. obvious reasons, spread = bad outcomes vaccinated unaccinated.

Also FDA/CDC suggests boost restore vaccine efficacy infection, relevant metric vaccine efficacy hospitalization. Infections, potential long covid, spread, longer relevant warrant mitigation via boosters.

The math checks out. Alright, pass original comment talking about. doubt -- inexplicable author chose angle otherwise good argument. ""Expand internet access minimize unneeded bureaucratic steps"" something makes sense gets much broader support ""physical interaction people must reduced every way possible.""   Disease vectors also 48 hours. 9+ months. waited last 48 hours time. beyond ridiculous Canada pressured opening side months ago yet somehow US accept visitors country significantly higher vaccination rates. I'm sure I'd feel safe venturing country, least option available snowbirds people family there. it’s Bec I'm Crist fan like Trump 2020 I'd swim across pool full broken glass cast vote DeSantis next year. can't wait. Hesitancy choice. choosing choose. extent concerned safety refuse drive reasonable speeds wear seat belt. curiosity, protests prohibitions mandates? turn people moving town NY license plates amazing. food delivery nearest “good” grocery store 25 min drive. NYC’er afford move out, none amenities used to. house buy usually back market months.  You’re right. That’s choice Delta obviously done good job communicating employees fence. 

I’m sorry, I’m pro vaccine anti mandating it.  I’m MN, I’ll it’s fucking maddening watch shit. Rural counties low vaccination rates contributing 2 3 times cases per-capita basis, Hennepin (most populous, home Minneapolis) contributing 1/2 2/3 much per-capita basis. Wouldn’t know it, rural folks decry metro violent, liberal hellscape redeeming qualities qualms taking hospital capacity… exactly it. build whole new identity without including anti-vaxx part it. drop it, walk away, get whole new job without consequences trouble caused anti-vaxx contrarianism leaving vaxxed staff behind find replacement.

They get month off, get vaccinated, start new job new hospital raise nurses high demand, one new place knows backstory.

They'd rather pretend whole different person somewhere else appear changed mind were. cowardly. point negative immunity? think lead? don't, hits them, either double stupid. I'm well aware pharmaceutical industry operates, thank you, asked *evidence* claim discrepancy FDA/CDC makers vaccines entirely based potential profits - broad explanation pharmaceuticals work capitalist society.

The incentive revenue inherent implied, therefore burden *you* prove factors weighing decision (since one making assertion), least health medical studies. evidence? compelling evidence proves CDC/FDA leading entirely primarily health concerns Moderna, Pfizer, J&amp;J concerned profits direct opposition health standards? simply operating assumptions slanted thinking towards capitalistic society suit preconceived notions? yeah, suppose right. Bye. Buy-bye. real Sophie's choice. I'd wish could fire person dramatic moron.  Bye, Felicia. really, deadly younger folks (yes fatal, enough statistical impact). refuse get vaccinated elderly neighbor pay. reasons believe spreading misinformation students lying school vaccine status? case, may reasonable concern. foolish social media family gatherings, I'm sure school would want response information. Whoa whoa whoa let’s knock working home, don’t need fix something isn’t broken call proepidemics live. ""isn't real"" ""overblown"" ""got 5g tracking chip"" vaccine passport ""sign beast""

take pick ridiculous non-reasons. flat earther made lens fit onto camera order prove hypothesis? According them, flaw simple, anyone solved yet?

Almost conspiracy theories easily disprovable claims like this.

My favorite chemtrails one. Like, trails right there. rent plane, go up, take samples, blow lid whole thing. would cost maybe million bucks, tops. amount consipracy idiots willingness spend money bullshit, can't get 10k people donate $100 prove government literally poisoning everyone? Same. mentioned doctor said breakthrough cases seen area individuals Pfizer vaccine. think complication factor distribution plan. sure go pharmacies mass vaccination sites. finalized plans course efforts currently go straight pediatrician offices school-based clinics.

I hope transparency good communication. much stake parents board inconsistency booster approval process, hope things seamless. Except BK abbreviation Brooklyn long hipsters thing. Good riddance vaccines still effective Delta. Exceptions ALWAYS made people health issues mean can't vaccinated, basically come certain allergies. [A fatal dose aspirin calculated 500mg/kg body think might info useful near future. vaccine hesitant still concerned getting covid... there's reason believe that's case here. seems lot like happened Florida. cases big vacation/tourism season ended cases began dropping.

Title ""Anti-vax New Yorkers consider leaving city mandates take effect."" sugar coat it, point still ""hesitant"" anti-vaxxer. Based current trends probably still ok.

Absolutely stupid. friend who's nurse antivax right mandate. another guy know get shot unemployment ran find job lol going say - aspirin shortage 3...2...1...  Could someone please confirm this:

Where Moderna half first 2 shots?


Has confirmed? specifically going manufacture Moderna 3rd shots/booster shots? let door hit ya ass way out.  Seatbelts airbags don’t prevent car accident injuries deaths! auto damn slow preventing 100%?!?

This fastest vaccine ever developed… order magnitude. 

A much better question everyone isn’t jumping chance 93% protection. snake oil. Comparing COVID-19 vaccine Tuskegee dumb hell rich old white people *skipping line* order get vaccine. doubts safety eliminated right there. think craft sharpie map previously suggested get Buggs dress sexy lady bunny, plan might work! Well, good news? still would love one, because. mom third shot Moderna (not booster since approved, third shot thing) due immuno-compromised immuno-suppressing medications. 

I asked doctor could get one (new baby family I'm going visit getting flu Tdap) said breakthrough cases seen Phizer, want that. much rejoicing. thought ivermectin supposed taken weekly? wish media would stop printing stories like this. creates larger echo chamber fence. ""See Martha, told who's thinking quitting/leaving/not getting shot. us!"" vaccine, free, worked. Next time we’ll prepared.  


/s Bye. Florida Texas thataway ↓ Honestly covid vaccinations even top 200 wouldn’t live dumpster fire city Same. Came post message encourage others. legit review fine, fuck people posting reviews political disagreements. balls say brewery one political. hypocrisy astounding. high vaccination rates, wouldn’t need mandates. 

The problem whole sections country won’t take it. probably underdosed purpose sell vaccines.

That's stupid take. best dosage amount gets job done more. Pfizer dosage sufficient protecting people within testing period that's went with. considered moving NY? Sounds awful like “if X elected POTUS, I’m moving Canada!” really don’t understand vaccine hesitancy guess propaganda hell drug. people dying COVID people living long COVID you’d think maybe would clue realize taking vaccine better that. guess decision isn’t based much reason.  sure done research studied carefully what's it.

Well least you’re violating someone’s rights. glad see story take ""FDA staff declines endorse Moderna booster"" bait many articles taken. Staff taking position determinative, IMO decided, least part, Pfizer boosters approved. Yes, there's less data Moderna (no Israel), studies logical reason think protection one decays, also (albeit slower rate). possible Moderna might get tweaked (8 months? smaller group?) see scenario there's flat no.

But, that's point - OP saying unvaccinated kid(s)... \*really\* depends situation. families gobs school-age (under 12yrold) kids/cousins/etc. families, might smallish gathering mostly vaccinated adults &amp; teens, whole calculation becomes much simple. Community rates also big role determination too. I'm MN outstate areas absolutely on-fire right now. I'd reluctant gather unvaccinated family members areas kids unmasked schools, example.

We let teens get together vaccinated teens/families indoors/unmasked need get back sense normalcy &amp; pretty safe scenario. perfectly safe, that's level risk we're willing take. let unvaccinated kid indoor playdates friends yet, go way arrange endless outdoor social time &amp; goes school high quality mask mask-mandated school &amp; seems going pretty well.

Good leave please don’t need here. hold weight? Vaccines don’t guarantee can’t catch Covid potentially pass others, significantly reduce chances so. vaccinated absolutely help protect people well yourself. That’s science says, that’s support. Pretty sure distribute different vials kids doses, dilution different adult vials. Measuring 1/3 volume dose already tiny would difficult.

That’s interesting. Cancer isn’t listed duty deaths, that’s understandable typically would treatment would likely take leave work. 

But look details Heart Attack, describes detail heart attack brought something like moving barricades, trapped building, engaging chase work related duties. went home shift perfectly healthy uneventful day suffered heart attack home would death longer considered on-duty death? yet Covid deaths considered on-duty?

IME New Yorkers incredibly kind people I've visited, zero tolerance kind thing. like Warren Commission, Clark Panel, House Select Committee Assassinations, Church Pike Committees, investigating JFK assassination coming back ridiculous lone nut fable large majority people never accepted. 

No one trusts government anymore lots valid reasons. don’t “conspiracy theorist” critically doubt “official government stories”. all, people don’t run propaganda programs…. governments DO. I’m agnostic whole lab leak vs natural origin. know blind faith governments, corporations (including MSM), international agencies, individual Facebook posts good way find truth. many times people going try use argument holds weight anymore? trusted science, know youre saying make sense. So, latest data I've seen CDC says 57% Americans least 1 dose vaccine.

The 2020 census shows population 331,449,281 people.

That means least 188,926,090 people COVID-19 vaccination.

For conspiracy theorists (one told vaccine would kill 3 5 years, proof data), that's 188 million examples vaccine fine poison. Also, it’s neurotoxin Covid messes blood brain barrier ways don’t understand yet. Thats really fucking stupid. Yeah, they’re charging people extra insurance they’re unvaccinated. 
Intuitively, seems like would effective mandate vaccine reduced Long COVID symptoms

I find bit fascinating honest, care elaborate? not, worries, glad feeling better. ask know lot people still feeling effects long Covid. Fuck that! send here. got plenty idiots is. need more. Vaccine mandates 98% job survivability.  visited NYC two weeks ago next nothing could done without vaccinated. Even hotel asked see vaccine card. you’re living unvaccinated, go home grocery store, guess. There’s pretty much nothing NYC don’t think city miss decide leave. 

Or, know, could get free safe jab two arm go back normal life. 🤷🏽‍♀️ “Doctors gatekeeping”… mean entirety prescription drugs work?

This **not** immunity wanes time, FDA CDC consider immunocompromised people need 3 doses trigger full immune response first place. really unrelated question boosters, even though authorization additional doses allow people get dose *acts* booster attesting immunocompromised. rest NYC give fuck. Stop announcing leave. part? 

That police officer incredibly dangerous compared professions, like delivery drivers, similar driving interacting public, often victims violence, yet manage preemptively shoot people?

Or police officers tend violent much higher rates abuse, job also domestically?

I'm wondering part obviously fucked organization filled obviously violent people trouble understanding Vaccine mandates around literally centuries, barely anyone problem now. People like told basically immune Covid's effects they'll get runny nose. understanding already place mask policies, combined existing air filtration airplanes made safe comparison similarly crowded areas. 

of course im sure cases transmitted airplane. nothing works 100% time, even vaccine.  Yes obviously that's unique opinion one also shared numerous experts including FDA CDC panels.

I'm promoting random ass belief nobody else holds, definitely Dr. Fauci health agencies several countries. ""My dog ate vaccine"" link Reddit's front page.

But agree, small subset people vocal committed idea ZeroCOVID speak discuss things COVID like highly effective vaccine already saved hundreds thousands lives allowed people go back things like do. thing can't stand online shaming vaccinated people normal things safe now, like going concert. certain point time thinking seen socially touch publishable. vaccinated people living lives concerned COVID. importantly, worry vaccine

This rational stance take, I'm tired people insisting take seriously. vaccine never dangerous risky virus. can't legitimately worry something billions people done without issue. also sucks people get 100mcg dose possible 50mcg dose good booster dose. 100mcg one currently authorized that's pay taxes. stuffy nose feeling tired spooky Yes Kyrie apparently rational.

Wiggins antivax soon 40 million dollar salary risk got shot. 

Simmons talked big game reporting 6ers gets trade, losing million dollars missing preseason games got ass Philly fast knocking arena door 6ers front office even knew. 

But Kyrie showing signs backing getting vaccine. Apparently ego worth 15 million dollars.  Pfizer drop protection antibodies waned? 

There difference moderna 7-8 12-13mo?

But main point protecting *only* severe illness bar. Time ask raise. Seems like value company increasing... Yeah, people haven’t murdered someone shouldn’t voice deciding murder illegal too. countries 80%+ still problems estimates 10% 20% people get covid get long covid, calling ""post covid-19 condition"". 

I would consider case serious carries kind risk long-lasting symptoms. Good. documented cases multiple people testing positive 1 infected person flight. don’t know kind numbers people looking say superspreader, handful time.

The US isn’t testing tracing passengers. wonder we’ve given industry pass otherwise it’s detrimental economies way life. Oh look, ""my precious sensibilities hurt"" cop-out. 

Who would thought! 😂 think could, bare minimum, apply level hospitalizations must get mandates removed. Hospital capacity play role well, open ended mandate nothing kill morale. city empty. offer incentives land city. Modern homesteders. TIL nearly 2/3 African American population NYC doesn’t matter, according Reddit user u/toasterding Good point term efficacy. guess referring efficacy infection, agree, need use specific verbiage, powers need better data collection system. lol, nice job editing ""10 days ago"" forgot change copied ""someone's"" comment passed No, unfortunately need draw blood test. see dark future anti vaxxers. losing jobs, leaving jobs need, losing money, losing homes going debt. get jab. countries take them, either. fact many countries even let visit without proof covid vaxx.   fooling anyone pathetic nonsense. 

❤️ 40hands Absolutely ! Damn I’d never seen one refer city Manhattan, would pain though. purchasing power one-time fine ($5) upheld Jacobsen v. Massachusetts 1905. never gave information/misinformation. hell talking about? No, I'm not, want split hairs. believe garden variety stupidity going them. Bye! Take easy!  Good grief. vaccine long enough know going kill get it. 

Let 'em leave. cares. Maybe listened scientists said COVID would rapidly evolve mutate, vaccines would never eliminate COVID. saying Spring/Summer 2020. Maybe use memory. 


Maybe testing lasted normal, multiple year timeframe, delta would emerged changed things? emerge vaccines approved all... Somebody must posted article before, similar comment. Wow, that’s population less 150M. Can't argue . Yup. makes compelling looking people infected, found far less transmission households. Obviously, going confounders real world data, followed trend data we've seen, yayy! conservative media hosts need Ivermectin - they're vaccinated. I'm hoping *at least* fear losing health insurance cause lot hesitant folks rethink positions.

It's one time actually think tying health insurance employment possibly positive thing. never managed get page. Half us walked away. lose war kind attitude. fucking dumb you? Damn. [these wrong? sure 85% subset population (as every media source does) simply misleading stating that?

I'm really confused. point 84% fully vaccinated cases rising 50% week, that's crazy bad news.  figure it’s helping. It’s like it’s gonna decrease immunity all.  Hmm get free, readily available, vaccine prevent possibly dying disease 1-2% mortality rate 25% people experiencing chronic health issues lose primary source income. possibly decide?!

/s frankly, FDA final say. CDC does, far understand. like Walensky showed middle finger Pfizer authorization, opening teachers, health care workers, etc. I'm failing see downside this. thousands deaths vaccine. amount money going ""cover"" kind side effect. one people died... feel like vaccine worth risk  Great Culling began. yes can, im talking much safer would really make them. fully vaxxed crew/staff means masks longer required, would cases airplanes become common currently required masks high vaccination rates? God I'm happy I'm school.  threaten good time. 

I guarantee majority New Yorkers welcome decision.

You're telling get rid anti-vaxxers make housing affordable fewer people competing homes? best thing happen NYC recent years. many people arent comfortable flying next screaming newborns either, doesnt change happens almost every flight im on. 

Im necessarily requiring vaccine them, dont know really accomplishes grand scheme things. Vaxxed people still spread it. id actually curious see happens when/if masks longer required plane type impact would have; even everyone board vaccinated.  whole thing FUBARed disgusting. need stop using word efficacy without specifying EXACTLY efficacy we're talking about. would need pull numbers Israel, IIRC **hospitalization** efficacy slightly dropped Pfizer 65 group 6 months. simply kind data regarding Moderna another Israel provide us data. US absolutely abysmal able collect sort information. Scott G gas harping CDC absolute inability collect data, constantly resort Israel providing information. far efficacy **infection** shown significant drop-offs time, albeit Pfizer Moderna.  Trash taking out. Nice.   see harm making boosters available option anyone feels need extra protection. Less illness seems always preferable. weird Minnesota far behind everyone else wave.

Ya I'm biggest hypochondriac got fully vaxxed Moderna, sure side effects feel completely fine daily life public much less stressful, takes big weight shoulders knowing protection serious illness breakthrough cases.

Don’t let door hit ya way out. dropped /s figured obvious think right clarify. 

People still using vet doses Ivermectin. many people US lie? considered overweight. Remove misinformation first work sensitivity internet. Flu hurt bad last year due Covid measures. masking/distancing, varying levels compliance, effective ban international travel. Everyone complied simply flights available countries willing accept visitors. 
Flu migrates hemispheres. Flu Season wanes North picks South comes back again, without vectors travelling people can't that. able vaccinate way outbreak, point mandates? hold breathe pass someone. think gaggle hillbillies walking Tractor Supply buying horse dewormer using artificial intelligence information gather make ""sWarM IntELligENce"" decisions?

lmfao.  Nope, wrong. Singapore 84% fully vaccinated, 85% single dose  went New York I’ve honestly never felt comfortable eating drinking inside checking vaccine cards door. Obviously know it’s fool proof breakthrough cases still makes feel better.

Print shit put face require across US. lets tiny bit normalcy I’m it.   They’re far less likely spread multiple reasons 

1. They’re less likely contract all. Can’t spread don’t it.

2. infected, you’re less likely symptoms, viral load lower, also reduces chances spreading. 

3. body mounts faster response infection, clears virus faster, meaning window transmissibility smaller. Nah want either Plus always talk shit soon they're lose $50 whatever get vaccinated.

There drive giving free beer got thousands vaccinations.

These people idiots. even mean? 'work together'? careful mean hiding forever like Chinese places do? Taiwan entry. gonna shut island forever? cause… cause hate them! Got J&amp;J county health department drive through.

I ask doctor, went walk-in got it. even entered info computer, thought would deny me. 

""Is first shot?""

""Yes."" (Didn't lie, first shot...of Moderna)  think particular goal could set 8/13? example, hitting 733 downslope? no, speed decline might happen again. assuming basing mandate hospitalization rather deaths, cases, presence outbreaks, icu capacity, ventilators available, medical staff patient ratio, possibility. Moderna nothing value lost. say reporting vaccine holdouts astonishingly bad across media landscape. reporter offers zero context numbers used headline article. good piece context information anyone actually digest information would many individuals work city Boston. quick Google search reveals city employs 18,000 people!!! quick math everyone. 812/18000 = .045= 4.5%. less 5% Boston city workers refuse vaccine mandate placed unpaid leave would appropriate line. Another way put would 95% Boston city employees comply vaccine mandate. wonder ""journalist"" leaves context? guess lack context point.  Flu underestimated. Get flu vaccine PBR...how normie....Narragansett...sigh Harlem.

Mariah ~~Dillard~~ Stokes Shades made so. Well, mean plague rat problem bunch plague infested rats jumping ship bringing plague them, so, fits isn’t solving problem. moving elsewhere. stopped reading first sentence. opinions meaningless. ""most cops can't abide fourth amendment"" killed people blatantly made up. get it, like cops, cool.  goal isn’t protect loved ones illness, goal oppose liberals costs People got two Pfizer doses get moderna booster. all, it’s effective company made best vaccine could, unlike Pfizer, probably underdosed purpose sell vaccines.  Diseased Tuskegee. Plenty cases blacks native Americans experimented recently 1970s. bread lot mistrust community government health programs. going vary handily person person state similar slightly less second dose. YouTube university good teach replace belt drive specific clothes dryer Pro covid Cool, fire 10% borough xxx? now. Seems covid solve beginning pretty obvious covid doesn’t spread much outdoors sound like “move Canada preferred candidate isn’t elected” folks. PLease do. still pretty good protection overall. COVID going away, point got say deal try get everyone take vaccine. 

I cannot comprehend getting vaccine, seems almost inevitable get covid point, would want level protection symptoms??  Two Women great too. try grab case whenever I'm state. Funny cops can’t abide fourth Amendment body cops absolve level accountability killing another person.
No citizen could ever get away killing unarmed people excuses cops make.
And ability make choice getting vaccinated protect people around claiming job protect people around seems biblical level hypocrisy.
But hey long cops get keep claiming job dangerous number one killer cops last two years Covid guess it’s cool.
I mean it’s good sound bite.
It’s also bullshit. That's rural NY too. Trump flags everywhere, liberal flags think. Depends isolated place is. that?   Nine months ago couldn’t get even wanted to? please, want crazies Florida. enough. swear, media always tries lighten touch discussing chuckle heads, call are! Sadly, understand even did. ISIS educated bunch. Lol dude totally missed argument. guy deleted comment talking thinks officers forced vaccinated. referring break infections  think it, returning Texas Mexico probably ethical thing anyway! Might morally sound inflict Texans them, oh well. good! take care. Right, lot scare stories delta people casually walking someone outdoors jump. Translation: Singapore almost cases virus spread like wildfire outside country. vaccinated everyone could soon could. new wildly spreading strain got there, people got sick couple people died. still like thousand percent rates elsewhere.

No one ever claimed vaccines 100% effective. vaccinate everyone, vaccinated people get sick. Duh. There's disproportionately large population New Yorkers vacation homes live, well people moved New York.

Not exactly looking forwards dealing even anti vax crowd coming job wasting time telling mask useless vaccines devil.

1: I'm vaccinated, went trip earlier year Cali GF requirement there

And

2: I'm supervisor, make rules job. Corporate does.

I've dealing BS year already. want too, never gonna happen people like keep letting things get worse. dummy exodus? wait extra week doses. Haven’t reason studies support gaps much longer that? need mask? Apparently concerned. COVID 3rd leading cause death 2 years now. We're 720K dead still climbing. risk dying COVID greater risk dying even getting sick current vaccine disease. considered moving cards us. I'm torn intense desire leave also feeling pissed us leaving means they've sure can't vote bullshit. However, get chance visit NY, assure I'll showing vax cards hostesses probably complete strangers help make jerk-wads TX assaulted poor hostess. Meanwhile Russia... setting new time record daily deaths. Usually people go leave, everyone else work harder pick slack. Companies want hire temp probably ineffective suck time away people training. jobs attractive: expected fill shoes full-time employee get paid crap short-term contract. 9+ months

I know still happy people getting vaccinated, see people getting cringe little. Seriously? following decline protection all?  semantic, technically getting moderna ""booster"", getting moderna ""additional dose"" authorized immunocompromised people part original course immunization, booster. additional dose authorized help trigger original immune response people weak immune systems, way combat waning immunity time.

On practical level, means getting third short original 100 mcg dosage, proposed 50 mcg dosage boosters. Perhaps undercounting might wrong word rather timeliness testing reporting case counts, influenced factors lead under- over-counting. Total cases equal, country efficient/aggressive contact tracing testing cases rolling faster.

And people continue making stories levels. still going unnecessarily alarmed 10 cases going 1000 cases versus 1 case going 100 cases. There's term this: terror management theory. people face mortality illness, double coping mechanism get extent, really makes sense context. government program trying give black people shots, sure, would suspicious hell. white people vaccinated hundreds millions. kind sketchy medical experimentation racist white people, first foremost white people? ride motorcycle? Yeah, weird logic. think serious COVID happen mortality rate low, think vaccine side effects even though rates much lower. Fun fact: coming NYC take left turn Albuquerque, indeed wind El Paso, Texas. lol get ivermectin generic drug let door hit ass way agree. mandate boosters every six months. vintage hipsters

That's got oxymoron. Baby Aspirin totally screwed stomach. Ugh, horrible. able take actually helps unfortunately.  know making millions dollars it?

Edit: correct words. I'm blanket calling ivermectin horse paste.

Ivermectin active ingredient horse paste. also available many forms, including formulations designed human use.

Many people getting human use kind, buying anything contains active ingredient ivermectin available local ag supply store.

Honestly, could care less people got doctor prescribe human appropriate doses ivermectin designed people. may even strong placebo effect people truly believe help them. likely health risks doctors phoning ivermectin prescription would lower people using formulations designed animals. don’t. media needs bogey man.
