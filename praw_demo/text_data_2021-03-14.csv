0,2021-03-14," yup, high 20k day multiple days - 600 looks worthy 'Wow' rate we're going 50% (127 million) adult population (255 million) US could vaccinated (at least shot #1) end week, absolutely wild Twitter could unban him? could save lives so. dude makes like 400k year. course touch. Trump retweeted video head, edited onto Bill Pullman’s body, giving speech. CCP bots downvoting reference, Ohio guidelines translate less 834 daily cases two weeks straight. currently around 1500.

IMO basing case numbers stupid literally encourage public test less manipulate numbers.

I also really like idea tying reopening vaccinations. basically mandatory vaccines. thing happened aunt, shrugged off. assumed Walgreens setting second shots 28 days after, since that's within appropriate timeframe shots. Easier trying precisely track shot inventory thousands stores. know scientific data side effects, I've heard news personal experience (my parents 2 grandmothers)

The data vaccination process spanish, graphs speak themselves. 4 millions already got first dose 1 million 2 doses.

The sinovac vaccine similar flu vaccine, pretty much safe, know going effective enough, let's hope is. watched JAMA interview two top US doctors worked separate pregnancy units. recommend Covid shot pregnant women. Except fact? statement counter point all?

You can’t one job well, screw follow job use excuse “if didn’t first job right wouldn’t even here.”

It’s like excusing failing university exams, saying “yeah hadn’t aced SATs wouldn’t even here”. keep performing. much beach, packed beach starting point. people going take virus somewhere.

The risk relatively low, still risk. Lol, OK. Significant hospitalizations leading overrun hospitals also significant concern. death significant issue, man. Long term heart, neurological lung damage count too. know what. could actually why. meant go week. Netherlands lockdowns curfew.

There measures take. Must CA got vaccine much quickly people expected, people updated opinions predictions accordingly? Here’s don’t get. one point saying don’t anything. Outdoor dining allowed pretty much everywhere. Gatherings allowed cases need smaller. You’re asked wear mask. could get upset truly locked down. throwing tantrum plans little smaller, eat outside instead in, wear mask? That’s ridiculous. think guys lost week winter storms. right. 

except fact Trump particular job right, would mountains vaccine production now. find sometimes take get point, sometimes ledes buried middle piece. refreshingly that. Meeting people outside nice weather vs meeting people closed spaces cold.

I think that's what's going on. good news comments said year ago many different reasons. Exactly. keep hearing argument don’t know long term effects covid… also don’t know long term effects vaccine since long term stage 3 clinical trials don’t even end January 2023, it’s really crap shoot. deaths hospitalizations continue go even next week reopen get ironic satisfaction fact all-time top post subreddit forever ""flatten curve"" infographic. post aged well yogurt container left office last March. That's wonderful news. husband supposed go Israel 10 day tour September. ""Quarantine Masks Forever!"" crowd Reddit inconsolable pronouncement. see US vaccination numbers, awesome. Washington we're still phase 1b vaccination getting appointment still difficult people eligible. someone eli5 go subset people even able get it, within handful weeks, everyone able get it. Even mass vaccination clinics, appointments easy get. Thanks info! hope better! It’s like politicians giving full control make decisions based expertise single subject allowing balance cost-benefit analysis. 

If put counterterrorism experts give full control policymaking, come bunch insane policies make sense objective get rid terrorism; account matters like human rights, economics, etc. problem careful balance right makes anti-science murderer cares economy people. Exactly wish governments would implemented mask social distancing guidelines, mandates. fine bejeezus businesses openly flout mask mandates, make people love government. makes non-compliant businesses turn speakeasies. much immunity get pfizer 2nd dose 7 days getting it? true. OWS well manufacturing ramp up. first part funding vaccine development good, yes.

Issues always black white. praised one job well, criticised another job well. absorbent state switched that, disaster crashing website never-ending waiting room site.

Meanwhile, dad's state, signed list healthcare system. 35,000 people list, going sloooow. ended playing website refreshing game Walgreens got appointment 65th birthday. Damn conservatives ruin lol Avoid politics. I've already seen plenty people sub arguing need worry kids catching COVID.

Nah don't. They'll eligible vaccine time year fine. silly comparison. comparing US's 7 day rolling average based slowly confirmed CDC numbers ""foretasted"" weekly UK number sometime future. CDC number article delay nationwide data feeds slowly confirmed CDC's state officials argued CDC figures accurately represent efficiently administering vaccine doses receive. CDC says data may reflect reporting lag five days.

The 7 day rolling average US already 2.54 million, accelerating rapidly. 

But let's talk per March 11, US .67 UK .50. That's vaccine doses per day(but 7day rolling average) per 100 people. Saturday? US .77. take 7day rolling average? 1.38 per 100.
The UK Saturday? .67

btw, get another look Chile! They're leading pack 1.47 7day rolling average! Faster per capita US, UK, Israel. russians? Interesting. point towards examples people taken Moderna, Pfizer, Johnson &amp; Johnson Sputnik vaccines died directly result reactions vaccine? NYC throughout pandemic, pretty sure rates high part because: 1) we're world city oodles people pass through, significant community spread elected officials decided act (highest case rate NYC actually 7 days initial lockdown), 2) density reliance public transit, 3) getting hit first, winter months gatherings we're mostly indoors, 4) Cuomo putting ""convalescent"" COVID patients back nursing homes furthered spread. 

Our initial lockdown actually arrest viral spread kept things getting bad could have. we're still looking ~30,000 dead NYC year. Without lockdown last March hard know would happened (and studies arguing kicking week earlier would cut death rate half - again, hard know). sure better allowing others invest manufacturing country, still doses paid ineptitude.

EU paid 7 times less per capita US UK, expecting results. tad irrational, think? people don’t click articles. read headline start scanning comments.

So reddit queued outside vaccine place nearly 2 hours wind rain didn’t see one person complaining. It’s British way. Yes, it’s disingenuous AZ it’s defenders (including sub) say “it’s within normal baseline blood clot issues”. specific, rare blood clot low platelet issue. 

Being pro-science means don’t discount stuff don’t want true. need investigate further. one times think Fauci way conservative says, almost detrimentally so. July 4 really long time away. even continued CURRENT pace vaccination (which won't, it'll keep increasing), pretty much every adult wants vaccine one like early June. 

At point, over. even matter cases doing. Maybe they're ""spiking"" (definitely would pathetic spike compared we've already) virus still ripping schools populations unvaccinated people. still matter. point, literally one favor continued restrictions. Vaccinated people immune want life go back normal, unvaccinated people wanted life go back normal along. Even could make argument point technically right thing continue restrictions, going zero public support going fly all. done. EU would fund capacity EU. uncertainty great then, EU chose fund dexterity different solutions unlike UK US.

US also funded AZ, hit disappointing results much invested vaccines manufacturing. AZ also massively delivered UK, supposed get dozens millions doses 2020. well enough funding production early larger scale.

The EU got bargained for. **You cannot pay 7 times less, later expect result.** Downvote will, denial never solved problem. don’t. it’s true. people die delay, goes.

&amp;#x200B;

The data support stop normal Sunday states report. important compare Sunday Sunday 1. never said one side, unless that’s took “redneck.”

2. Yes could ignore hot stank coming mouth, enough push virus away! that's true, statistically difference.

Not stats AstraZeneca showing.. that's actual evidence severe unusual symptoms occurring vaccinated populations rate different unvaccinated population, that's legitimate concern


One doctor treating 3 patients still alive said seen anything like it. patients symptoms identified countries, taken increasing overall mortality, increasing number significant clotting events, regardless location etiology, 


This could cause both. cases severe normal clotting events. also much, much harder treat using blood thinners patients already low platelets Even know fact vaccine cause additional 5 directly caused deaths given population, also know delaying vaccine X number weeks cause 25 additional deaths, ethical thing still issue vaccine.


The thical thing figure significant risk inform population. decide ignore symptoms, telling people there's need wait investigate, tell people vaccinate anyways, revealed correlation clots vaccine, never going get population trust again. Good luck getting try get people trust next time vaccine needed hid underplayed side effects risks last time. I’d give DNA get Disney, doubt it. place awesome. ""The heat kill covid wait see"" Well one country print 6 trillion dollars. reserve currency advantages. Deaths already getting car accidents. going impossible ask people keep following guidelines time summer gets MALCOM BULTER! UNREAL!  Yeah bbq going matter Fauci sounds like absolute worst holiday time. know become prevalent. relevant. shocking people sub places even make effort understand.

The fact small cluster 'unusual' (although specific unusual) cases observed millions doses trials. One thing clear far far low make conclusion from, sub well versed confidence intervals now. seen clot cases usual rate maybe would merit, far nothing indicate anything beyond half dozen cases. Investigate want, stop something proven save lives due tenuous link evidence. It’s big circle really. First POTUS taking seriously. led states trying form arbitrary responses basically prove political point, (you go Costco can’t buy paint) . Later became clear protests dangerous unless you’re protesting civil rights. many politicians caught breaking rules ?
Fauci camera saying don’t wear mask (a video get banned sharing ) basically lying manipulate behavior... matter noble cause .. 

After think Americans thinking straight? Congrats. county well. 800 vaccines available 7,500 due. 58yo T1 diabetic one working lung, I'm still current. Luckily, wife gets Wednesday. Air enters cabin nozzles leaves vents floor. airflow pretty much vertical travel far. none wouldve mattered Trump's Operation Warp Speed I'm HS principal, hybird. kids eat classroom remainder year.  population this? EU continent? Biden able vaccinate pace 

Operation Warp Speed saved America. death's door. Americans think normal America vaccinated. virus around mutating every human vaccinated. Fauci, we’d masked living bubbles next 50 years. He’s doctor can’t consider factors beyond public health saving every single person physical harm, matter repercussions  got shot yesterday. reckon happen trust vaccines AZ turn safe keep vaccinating people either way. Yes, paper short term might safe people, since (possible) deaths AZ seem extremely rare, practice trust vaccines go drain massively, door trusting Pfizer, Moderna J&amp;J gets thrown wide open let possible unsafe vaccine street. case AZ gets proven unsafe vaccinating anyway, would vaccines safe one proven unsafe also considered safe standards. end people would otherwise accepted vaccine would refuse now, total deaths would higher covid would prolonged even more. 2 week delay, end probably mean little AZ vaccine generally given less vulnerable people bulk vaccinations Q2 anyway.

It's 'het zekere voor het onzekere' couple deaths, country/EU wide trust vaccines. 

The problem humans irrational animals, everyone thinks rational untill shit hits fan. this, one human dies due AZ vaccine proven cause, would much media shit show hundred would safed deciding keep going vaccinating untill know sure AZ truly safe not. end scared faulty vaccines kills maybe 20 people country disease killed 16,000 people right now, rational all, especially looking numbers, could sway public trust vaccinations big time, could result worse result said done. wrong two accounts.

1. one side political spectrum. extreme ignorance general ass-hattery sides around.

2. going away find different annoying things do. Shrinks far right red parents family members always job security It’s distressing things look good, there’s still 7k fellow countrymen ICU thing. important remember human toll here. That’s I’ll keep part long necessary hope too. Atlantic normally produce things aren’t cogent? Tommy's sadly exactly ""all there"" days. outcome care about.

It is. Death outcome COVID could possibly justify policy changes implemented last year. deaths go away, policy changes need go away. already posted File Super Bowl spike headlines February. HA! yeah ok. T\*\*\*\* base started making mockery virus led us hole climbing of. know sure. Hearn implied died delete instagram implication even making second post telling antivaxers duck off. another headline claims cases deaths falling across Europe. 

Hmmm.  great site. used Colorado find appointment first shot week. Also shared parents group became eligible able find appointments. american tax dollars helped development. sell? trying failing like New Zealand


We actually like Taiwan, went straight action never really lock down, didn’t let COVID get uncontrollable foothold country. Thanks. Good luck you. can’t get Pfizer, Moderna J J? Sorry it’s taking long there. Keep head Based People Fall: ""Fauci lied again. said we'd get Snickers bar, actually got Milkyway."" multiple people removed, fine unless get symptoms reason think COVID. like US needlessly hording supplies. They're used domestic vaccine manufacturing facilities.

I see US would feel obligated export critically important vaccine components middle unprecedented vaccine manufacturing effort. seems right along lines Italy blocking vaccine shipment Australia. things settle down, we're taking care first. Taiwan great place, hopefully go back one day. That's pretty weird personal diss make YellowDouche  wear mask wherever required people just...over top. 

Someone whining city sub joggers local trail weren’t wearing masks even though it’s remotely crowded there’s plenty room passing runners maintain clearance. 

I’m sure they’ve told people listen science million times, science says method transmission exceedingly rare. US there’re sub-tiers within sub-tiers. constitutes Phase 1B right isn’t necessarily constituted Phase 1B weeks ago, since eligibility list expanded. example, Arizona, Phase 1B initially applied adults 65 specific frontline workers; got expanded 55 many essential workers days expanded individuals high-risk conditions living congregate settings. 

They made confusing, probably made didn’t want groups complaining weren’t Phase 1.  keep hearing UK South Africa variant. However look two countries trend lines look great. Poor Italy Brazil spiked again, two countries variants first found extremely well. someone explain better? I’m genuinely curious countries aren’t struggling all. say dumb you? I'm sorry, upset st Patrick's day comment. Plenty people screamed void super bowl valentines spread events unironicaly, thus comment. absolutely positive large majority businesses, particularly big chains, going continue require masks 2022. essentially costs nothing want bad press.

For similar reasons think we'll seeing large indoor events 2022. doctor interviewed one doctors treating three patients Norway stated clots brain stroke. I'd agree otherwise, trust high position doctor more, honestly. Could simply less symptoms less transmission. large percentage kids covid asymptomatic rest mostly mild symptoms.

Compare viruses cause gastroenteritis (noroviruses, rotaviruses) flu, tends lot symptomatic kids. I'm cynical anyway. severed remaining trust institutions. know 20 people fear workplace post-pandemic, could get fired going somewhere crowded hours employer views unnecessary, basis “your endangering coworkers staying home”. 

Going might viewed way making inappropriate social media post. Allergic reactions exist, discount those. highly rare insignificant occurence aside though, right. wear masks start pandemic

That's shortage, medical personnel around infected patients day needed general public. PPE. Later, supplies increased, people started making masks, research revealed effective mask wearing was, advice changed. 

Scientific medical advice often change new data comes circumstances change. shortcoming, strength. political pressure Trump administration come answer boss wants hear even match reality really wearing him/

Politics! contagious even deadlier variants, sound like greatest idea.

Of course time implemented much worry. Still reduced dining CO - can’t even get vaccinated yet “tbd” events like happen UK? People Fall: ""Fauci lied again. said would able everything open 4th July many people got sick couldn't! Oh well guess I'll keep ignoring masks health safety guidance got us surge begin with."" cares works, sing best marketing name drug past 30 years.  Can't see happening stupidness going multiple states repealing safety restrictions everybody flocking spring break party masks go home states they'll start super spreaders. favorite stat look vaccines 63.4% entire population gotten least one dose. That's nearly 2/3 (statistically) vulnerable group, amazing. ""How's mahi-mahi?""

""So-so.""

""I'll couscous.""  Hooray! guess? get safely go back world try get life started? problem lot us. Still confused people even accepting guidelines given givt instead doctors tell them. 355 million vaccine doses administered far. 

We also know case parts vaccine even *could* something like reused old vaccines extensively studied. logical reason pause vaccines simply bureaucratic one. People died things need put hold. people socializing, lot people can't go back work. that's problem. cares?

Infected people virus mutates. infections, mutations. infections, even asymptomatic, mutations - perhaps vaccines effective against. know much time transpired vaccine hospitalization? I’ve read, sounds like happened really quickly vaccine Trump's popularity dependent never asking followers think anything rational. People gonna likely take risks Spring Summer since general narrative it’s safer it’s warm out. 

Some people might get back side caution degree next Winter, depending successful vaccine distribution is, “hunkering down” probably won’t necessary extent last year. one vaccinated person Pfizer trial reported symptoms considered ""severe"", oxygen level 90%, require hospitalization. people low oxygen levels normally, especially smokers, one benchmarks trials used define severe infection. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

I'll echo sentiment. stupid shit like opening up, easing mask mandates, returning everything normal achieve herd immunity (quite obviously yet), else mutated strain could bring us back square one. Non medical professionals understand this, makes cringe. state live in? I’m 40 able register get vaccine less week. I’m Texas. bad everybody busy phone never truly going end, it? Even vaccines, people ever going move pandemic, they?

I wrote much longer comment talking feel way darkest days, despite vaccine, AutoMod removed idk triggered it. 

I'm trolling. very, depressed. need 2019 normal back. I've given much slow spread minimize deaths road vaccine, feel like vaccine good enough thought breaking me.  Sure, know social isolation lack school kids

Yep, know. AAP consistently advocated re-opening schools, part gets cherry picked ""when safe so."" 

I number teachers family, including wife, levels. Kids acting responsible way schools duration day. 

And teachers state able get vaccinations yet. 

I'm re-opening schools, even CDC's guidance fails metro area many community infections safely re-open. also covid doesn’t really spread much schools, seems poor decision kept closed 

That depends entirely data got cherry-picked. Covid spread much schools numerous levels precautions taken, students follow guidelines spaced apart appropriately. parents keeping kids home symptomatic. That's happening live. 

My daycare kicked one kids adult exposed boss reminding mean *I* work home. Like put bowl food water 1 year old hope best 8 5. 

We close adult population vaccinated, school year almost over. see unnecessary risk live. people back behaving like normal, what's debate see opening back up? According that's already happened. Preparing incoming students event happens. It’s better over-prepare restrictions limited opposite, matter unlikely. countries lower vaccination rate US..... last naturally occurring case smallpox reported 1977. 1980, World Health Organization declared smallpox eradicated. Currently, evidence naturally occurring smallpox transmission anywhere  people part back behaving like normal, numbers still falling like rock, people vaccinated constantly. figured, long comment idk phrase I'm SOL Japan 30 years ago USA year growth anything maybe. Spending printing money diff. second flu would devastating Healthcare resources (in US). need much lower that. Thank much!!! got one son nursing student. I’ve trying three weeks CA site garbage, he’s literally class day site clinic I’ve trying help. I’m cry relief. Mostly title doesn’t reflect reality. 60% hospitalized patients (not 60% people confirmed infected) form symptom 6 months after. importantly 60% muscle weakness next highest symptom depression anxiety sleep problems. Muscle weakness like hallmark hospitalized particularly severe illness kind. get put vent weeks you’re likely lose muscle mass. conclusion study bears out. says flat longer hospitalized severe illness likely experience lingering symptom. imagine lawyers playing commercials saying received Covid vaccine call immediately 1 year. article could said Tommy Hearns anti-vaxxer. didn't. two months ago, Federal vaccination program.

It make sense state governments play heavy role program, US large diverse place, state governments (in theory least) know local populations potential complications better Federal government does. similarly, states delegate cities localities finer level control. 
So that's reasonable.

But vaccination started previous administration, really plan coordination Federal level. basically threw vaccines states said ""Have it!"" led confusing patchwork plans varying quality, depending competence, motivation, resources state government.

That's changing presidential administration motivated solve crisis. takes time clean mess magnitude. US (exporting J&amp;J Moderna, importing Pfizer AstraZeneca) COVID vaccines....

I don’t really know anything Chinese vaccines defending them, butt particular point deal breaker, perhaps rethinking order... Thanks much, appreciate kind words! came find comment, lol! certain medical conditions. put originally high blood pressure. becomes eligible March 15. It’s amazing vaccine front runner last spring summer, it’s nonstop issues since September onward. I'd also OK urged occupy iceberg launch sea. meantime, yes, get shots. hard tell online people experiencing symptoms motivated go online write it. go ""covidvaccinated"" sub, it'd seem 95% people feel sick days Pfizer's data suggests opposite, minority experience symptoms like that, though tiny minority. 

I got 2nd pfizer days ago far symptoms minor. soreness shoulder ear side injection hours, nothing noticeable, shoulder soreness started bed time. Almost everyone experiences that. maybe felt bit fatigued following day enough take nap go bed early, also drink stuff caffeine throughout day maybe reduced symptom. feel sick think fever. let’s see. said “For lives, fucking humble” defined American idea nationality defines (which happens European country). 

Yes, thought clear enough comment targeting personally whole thread. guess I’m sorry ended person commented comment implicitly targeting arguments made last summer European countries citizens take pandemic seriously Americans. Embedded idea cultural. Specifically Europeans willing sacrifice come together tough times Americans erratically individualistic.

Yes point good vaccination roll invalidate less culture timing/better governance.

I’m belgian,lived U.K. height pandemic (and US).

If think better governance, bridge sell side note. Ironically, northeast US, virus always taken seriously than, say France month ago.

Shocker; areas affected worst took seriously. think took seriously. get it. clearly offended probably got hyper emotional.

Ah yes, “hyper emotional” side “I wasn’t serious geez” Severe enough hospitalized, though. Blood clot brain considered stroke. like safe havens NY CA Actually, no, beneficiaries Trump administration policies Thank you. I’m trying convince family take scared needles insist J&amp;J good. Sending FDA submission definitely seems appropriate Vice article... Regardless, dick chart helpful understand. expect see frequentcy normal healthy people. Rare. 100% protection figure clinical trial. think clinical trial number exactly equal real life studies, that's understanding science/statistics. also think people get shaming people without masks--they love moral superiority high. Like little modern busybody church ladies something--they want give Karening. 

The masks give shortcut figuring good people bad people are. Israel done great job vaccinating reporting real world data, particular report bit vague unhelpful (as statistician). throws lot percentages none basis vaccine efficacy percentages we've come see manufacturers. information needed translate efficacy. would caution anyone using results without understanding thoroughly. Lol 80+ upvotes ? numbers decreasing whining understating. Lot hate filled people sub. I’m NJ too. 46 years old? eligible? I’m older you... this? Apparently HEB offering excess vaccine doses shoppers pharmacy closes don’t get rid them, don’t know list. 

I already got first dose GF going tomorrow 6 (pharmacy closing time) see get one.  It’s already like town, wanting kids back full time social distancing. Yet last week 8 covid positive cases school district. compare vaccinated versus unvaccinated within country. High levels spread amongst unvaccinated mask far dramatic decreases vaccinated population. Like many countries, Israel sizable anti-vax population, though Israel many anti-vax religious reasons. unvaccinated group partially vaccinated group driving numbers. matter? Lmao  China less 100000 cases reported .

Meanwhile western countries 10 20 times higher per capita reported cases others . Looks like western superior bubble slowly bursting name-calling others left Learn fucking cope man, God lost. think that’s - shut-ins probably overrepresented Reddit user base like idea hanging house day feeling like they’re missing social life.

The way people talk end pandemic abstract concept instead something already progress makes think aren’t looking forward much rest society. unlikely. textbook vaccine symptoms. you’re worried get test cvs. easy especially insurance.  Nothing *ever* fair comparison pro-lockdown crowd numbers fit narrative. course, comparing New Zealand's outcomes US totally fine.

You look numbers states uniform policies, even look specific regions given state locked heavily see appreciably better, average, places not. look global trends see entire countries lock (Sweden, Japan) still fared worse many countries locked heavily.

The goalposts predictably interminably shift, excuses found wave away every example lockdown failing produce desired outcome, matter what, conclusion always may still bad given instance, would *obviously* worse without lockdowns. evidence actually bear regardless much lockdown proponents would like to. Things enjoy closed? act dumb online? genuinely don’t get it. 

You say things continuously get deleted don’t stop second think “Maybe I’m asshole...”

As example - COVID data track COVID outbreaks occurred. Like, people don’t think idiots think disease doesn’t exist. You’d rather mock idea instead engage it. understand information?

And I’m curious comments, I’m entirely curious act like online. What’s point? Reddit replaced social life? know how? I'm glad think like you. one saying this. 🙄 Sorry list all. EITHER WAY going slower states. 😏 main point. Louisiana something right could take notes. sure Bangladeshi safety precautions beyond hygiene recommendations given, one US quarantined year, even close.

Wash hands, properly wear mask.

Not.

Too.

Hard. Oregon, teachers vaccinated starting January, schools delayed opening April. teachers unions saying didn’t ask vaccine, need new hvac systems, “why bother 2 months”? entire point waiting could hey vaccinated. 

It’s really vile situation. 

Oh district using federal relief money pay daycare teachers opening. know, ones told parents awful teacher killers teachers weren’t babysitters. Parents gotten daycare help year 😂 

Personally, don’t care it’s 2 months, letting teachers unions get way matter principal point. take weirdness look issue want terms conservative (keep same) liberal (try something new). hold one identity blinds us other. Can't really take people using random teacher breaking law sending home kid shit Sweden seriously. news precisely crazy stupid thing anyone Sweden do. also know case parts vaccine even could something like reused old vaccines extensively studied.

This correct. Oxford/AZ vaccine first vaccine market use adenovirus vector. similar traditional vaccines uses weakened virus, traditional vaccines virus vaccine virus vaccinated against.

So no, regions stopping administration AstraZeneca. Furthermore, Figliuoli working better vaccination plan aiming 500,000 doses day equal 3.5 million doses week things start getting better get first J&amp;J doses.

The tier system seems good keep cases 10/100k/day. many people, that's good enough. Eventually, re-opening goal. would keep restrictions cases low? cases increase again, we'll put back restrictions, that's purpose tiers.l

For others, lower risk tolerance, can't see anything cases &lt; 1/100k/day (or even lower), opening indoor dining (while weather allows us easily dine outdoor) delay moment feel safe going outside again. met friends year, even outside, see people things 100x riskier.

You know memes front page reddit living cancel plans staying inside gaming day? people saying life hasn’t changed all. course hasn’t changed them. weren’t around friends family constantly. weren’t going sporting events, concerts, eat groups. it’s easy France they've opened new departments hospitals specialise long covid. get real official IMO. Oh. Yeah that's great. looks like dust mask, wont much vs virus pandemic. I'm telling saying ""Many people want it"" vague also speculation. Several countries already using it. Central Eastern European members EU. Italy plans well producing it. 

Also, EU equate Western Europe, there's reason assume Western European countries take either. Yeah, I've never heard someone Ireland referring Emerald Isle Israel left lockdown month ago, talking about? Pretty much everything open restrictions left airport size events capped 500 300 weddings. Austria one nurse died blood clots two hospitalised - worked hospital.

This interesting bit. problem generally AZ vaccine would expect clotting spread population fairly evenly. get tight cluster would suggest something else play. Oh wow coffee yet.

Well effective Pfizer, sure give shot. two doses? either article written Big Pharma pushing people vaccinated, thus increasing revenue, complete misinformation, both.

Using vaccine sold profit, that's first one way.

And we've supply shortages ahead boom whilst capacity increased, that's second one way. I'd heard great Ireland. Confused We’ve also ramped testing huge amount. I’m honestly surprised still seeing cases drop week week. would expected see rise increase testing schools opening still great! Anyway, cases don’t matter anymore, hospitalizations deaths matters now. mean last March, mean, yeah, would totally deserved treatment simply refers whole island i.e. Rep. Ireland &amp; N. Ireland wait one never-ending lockdown like Ireland. really sucks. already guess read literature-review study well. study question. Although understand confusion links awful translations floating around. yes many many people would equate vaccine russia unsafe comes from. EU politized everything Russia? Florida enters chat don’t think serious happened Norway.

There 2 fatalities, 1 vaccine. makes sense. They're skeptical AZ allegedly unsafe, comes from. reason thinking people take Sputnik V russian vaccine. get tested? Isn’t waste dose you’ve covid? saving lives saving face. people scared astrazeneca shot they’re sure hell gonna scared russian shot says article talks fact started. Every time go drive-thru think courageous people like shown work since pandemic began.

The text compares natural infections one dose vaccine. 94% refers symptomatic disease only

Nope, I've said, 94% figure citing recent real world study Israel, shown Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine 97% efficacious preventing symptomatic cases 94% efficacious preventing asymptomatic cases.

The study alone changed consensus reinfections, fact looking genetic sequencing must know time run, US sequencing less 1:350 tests absurd.

Sometime next weeks, someone 2 shots + 14 days going put ECMO machine. 

I suppose happens, it'll also meaningless data blip you, too.

*No one* trying make feel afraid, reinfection rate clearly already 10%. CMOs around world clearly working assumption.

It really something else implied might block allowing see data, pulled song dance, maybe know little sequencing? I'm sure you, seem much less informed medical sorts bump into.

Anyway, wished nice day time back. Anyone know efficacy sinovac coronavac vaccine first shot? 

I cannot seem find anywhere. Quick someone phone EMA, MHRA, redditor can't explain this. change wording ""Israel significant lockdowns restrictions last 75 days help achieve rates"" 

Why would make intentionally misleading sentence? true technicality, reality Israel lockdown half time. say Israel totally open, restrictions still 

It's completely open, pretty damn close. thus we'll worse outcome given we're rolling back little-to-nothing? 

Vaccine efficacy nothing restrictions calculated vaccinated unvaccinated conditions.

I'm sure use Israeli data conclude vaccines work alone, data suggests opposite. Sure restrictions completely lifted yet, that's Israel extremely cautions. Still that's clear trajectory we're going. 

We're going lift mask mandate soon, open airport even further, allow clubs parties. next week. taking measures data showing vaccines sufficient.

The problem article posted OP data detailed enough. ""After 2 doses"" time period includes first 1-2 weeks, vaccine achieves max efficacy. Worse that, lag infection, illness severe illness, people hospitalized days 2cond dose likely caught vaccine effect (12-14 days 1st dose).

This completely theoretical discussion, looking Israeli COVID deaths February get this:

 

\- 935 COVID deaths Israel February.

\- 553 unvaccinated.

\- 240 1 dose (so 1 3 weeks 1st dose, 2 unprotected yet).

\- 142 deaths 1st week 2cond dose.

\- **0 deaths 1 week second we'd lump deaths second dose together, we'd wrongly underestimate full effect full protection. India exported nearly 60m doses inoculated around 27m Indians date. Production scaled well they’ve allowed product sent western world. However, send places approved it. Vaccines valuable commodity they’re going send places it’s approved - would ridiculous. It’s EU approve SII, weeks behind countries. “In current recommendations Smittskydd Stockholm explicitly stated recommend masks classroom environment moment,” said.

The kid returned two days later parents agreed kid wear mask. nice school closed two weeks due high number cases.

These people dumb adults Liberal? conservatives quaking boots referring sub sample individuals received lower first dose, UK Yes, recovered Sunday. Hopefully back ""normal"", previous days blip. many geezers holy hell

I mean nice see venturing first time long they're vaccinated worry lot killing roadways. send states gladly use them! contact you? first week ago. 36 health issues. told asked I'm getting early doctors local area banded together came plan early on. Theyre last 2 groups now. Here’s good article explaining ahead vaccines. No, it’s Biden. think 107 million doses administered, severe side-effects would pretty well-known. Yes that's true. wanted see common practice countries. actually direct quote data findings sections study. 189 seropositive participants, 19 (10.1%) least one positive PCR test SARS-CoV-2 six-week follow-up”

Ignoring essentially potential argument study design validity, merits doesn’t entirely prove reinfection, data impressive alone. None colleagues friends would particularly interested study. 

From things you’re saying don’t necessarily convince there. Fundamentally agree you. different reasons. Primarily still don’t know variants play unknowns regarding vaccination campaigns. 

If breakthrough infections occur don’t think it’s going neccesarily vaccine failure, Americans unhealthy, whatever you’re theorizing. rather mutation selection pressure virus itself. 

The reason even asked begin claims made, particularly “high reinfection rate” breakthrough cases, profound would change way public health medical professionals view current virus landscape. concerned fallen behind data. based presenting personal review morning seems fears weren’t warranted. Free birth control life - even better! They're run federal government neither community transmission 200 days. NRA? ugly circlejerk typical uninformed claims. doesn’t appear result that. appears result large orders US government made long time ago. Agreed. Additionally would mention easy find extra doses penalties using them. I'm 50 people know vaccinated already. Florida ton old people dude Look re-educating sense smell - started early possible time good. involves repeated exposure diverse stimuli. March 1st. EU still auditing.

The EU still hasn’t approved them, U.K. weeks month ago Serum Institute major player EU slow deal them.

The EU dealing yes, taking long? late start approval process still it. need pull finger - time essence. That’s entirely accurate. AZ/Oxford plenty diversity Brazilian South Africa trials. errors dosing, trial protocols data. Oxford decided wait complete US trial. numerous discussions public comment FDA matter. EU bought vaccines manufacturers without actually ensuring they'd delivered ensuring ""they would best possible"". got garbage deal. bad batch happen issues need dealt with.

Come can't scientist running around jabbing people completely unregulated radar also skipped numerous trials steps

Clearly guy well established, highly qualified skilled would set dangerous precedent others allowed go ahead going see happens next weeks Florida.

Their 2020 spike biggest May/June/July assume it'll year, thats heat drives people indoors there.

If counties start looking like Miami-Dade it'll sooner, Florida looks rough 4-6 months, yeah.   Cries Germany forget territories What. The. Fuck. thought U.S. second. can't 7%+ population every week? extent did? Multiple different vaccines huge orders? Yes. 

If - vaccines? US take military force? doesn’t make sense many Europeans claiming taking vaccines. vaccines yours...did steal them? answer aren’t legally don’t them. funny many anti-vaxxers comment sections seem 100% ready take vaccine even clinical trials.

Something seriously wrong people. Take precautions 3 weeks vaccine. neighbour caught Covid 2nd week jab (confirmed test). Symptoms extreme tiredness breathing difficulties, jab may reduced severity illness ? Guys. think government functions helpful? Yeah, well, one guy subreddit. expect? Florida good example. governor made decision early accept high infection rates death. people advocating Florida’s approach successful haven’t considered many lives could saved much illness prevented following basic science guidelines. 

We going see happens next weeks Florida. Going interesting watch. That’s true. 

Really happened Europeans thought better US could beat covid good behavior lockdowns. result didn’t focus much vaccines. they’ve found boat want vaccines. happens one sided press doesn’t expose everything going on. case, operation warp speed. huge deal last administration likely even shared country even though last administration likely television every day. I’m sorry press citizens disservice. semantic failure. Words meaning.

Won't pick one?

Israel longer lockdowns, wrong way said it. 

If change wording ""Israel significant lockdowns restrictions last 75 days help achieve rates"" becomes entirely true.

You say Israel totally open, restrictions still here, citing Green Pass numbers today ignoring severe cases lag infections.

Does change point Israel's restriction policies robust US, thus we'll worse outcome given we're rolling back little-to-nothing?

Of course not.

So yeah, kinda think belaboring nothing.

That's reality here. got first dose Monday. admit, sort flubbed questionnaire get 1C. defense, last time weighed doctor technically 30 BMI considered obese, regardless, almost cried. ""goal post moving"" aka changing ur oppion new information, data science. ECMO basically life support.. lungs work point. Well starving people many countries right now...are sending food ending famine? could. Sad you’d rather let die. 

Your government letting people die. It’s responsibility US vaccinate population. aim anger wrong entity pall. 

EU produce vaccines make vaccines manufacturers produce faster. I'm usually paranoid, read cases, think whether could small interventions foreign nation could benefit unstable Europe. UK ofc.. doesnt take many cases build untrust population.. That's fine, make sense context vaccines. doesn't. safe effective. get look good. rightly so, tbh. ""At least 10% 18-20 year olds infected variants April December 2020 significant mutation spike protein, strict observation six weeks, using 100% mask discipline compliance, already reinfected end year.""

Is study actually says, read it.

Given Americans *tend* older 18-20, overweight new military recruit, generally observe 100% mask discipline (nor get six weeks year strict isolation), passing around variants established escape mutations:

Do think 10% goes up. down?

Sorry Doc, I'm sure really grasped study says, easy knock straws hand.

3-6 months breakthrough infections, like said, we're investigating now. 

As far total antibody resistance measured maximum throughput number? Trying game absolute antibody response get given vaccines distributed population. Well dude, can't understand study linked, I'm sure ever going get that, frankly.

Do pass study around amused colleagues, you, **doc**? US regulator approved finished US trials, think work. Oh knew Get get head get head get head EU rhetoric ramped clear AZ needed authorization deliver parts UK. essence case AZ promising doses EU chance ever receive indirectly blaming UK, US India delivering doses EU contract AZ. say average. [They first real wave COVID vaccinated rate like reason susceptibility still high. sad. Everyone consuming dihydrogen monoxide, pandemic itself.  think nose thing government issue - basically broadcasted spreads coughing/speaking. everyone thinks wearing mouth okay, despite every flyer rules released mouth nose…

well cancer treatment stay safe side… know 60% nurses Poland said won’t get vaccine… good luck! ;)

get vaccine first, shots, otherwise might pretty dangerous going anywhere near anyone works healthcare. they’re infection vector #1, followed teachers… refusing wear even masks… Trump tell followers CPAC? everywhere go see it. cant escape please think underestimate much people miss mundane, “nothing thrilling” experiences, much actually matter. 

Seriously? really believe coronavirus still around neighbor street people like went Chili’s weren’t supposed to? Wow. statistics reported originally based flawed testing methods produced significant amount false positives. testing method revised post election indicating dramatic drop worldwide. 

Recent reports dramatic declines may appear attributed vaccine efficacy considered authentic testing methods flawed beginning, whether testing methods originally used put place bad actors amplify ""pandemic"" narrative decide. Yes, 16/1. I'm pretty sure say ""delivers according schedule counting arbitrary date mention"". Jersey. somehow, texas going down.

We're water yet want last year college ruined covid variants chance. want people chill little longer there's end sight Saturday

and that's Israel. *might* reason fewer deaths (or anything else) reported day... know happens people vaccinated Sputnik EMA approved. eligible vaccination passport retroactively?

Why be? exact vaccine. Independence Day victory music played throughout country: That's false Probably COVID killed many already. Check New York Michigan stats this. Hello beautiful, soon vaccinated people. Let's go actually get number means something. many people per day matters get significant percent vaccinated. time now. Sorry. fuck guys?? Yeah Brazil definitely didn’t well.. surprisingly still lower death per capita US state average could reporting though. Russia bad, grr. Well one thing Massachusetts cases rising. plateaued around 1.5% positive rate 100k tests.

Our summer average 1.5% 10k tests. nursing personal care homes local area restrict even deny visitation even close family. Depends facility.

# CORONAVIRUS/Taiwan COVID-19 drug gets positive review, clinical trials advance

 

Taipei, March 15 (CNA) Taiwanese drug developer Senhwa Biosciences said Sunday investigational drug treatment severe COVID-19 infections received positive reviews independent monitoring group United States, clinical trials go forward.

The oral drug Silmitasertib (CX-4945) currently phase two trial Banner Health-University Medical Center Phoenix, Arizona, sponsored research.

In evaluation March 11 data first batch patients, Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) said need modification trials.

Senhwa Biosciences proceed recruitment patients treatment severe COVID-19, company said release.

The DMC, also known Data Safety Monitoring Board, independent group clinical experts monitors patient safety and/or treatment efficacy data ongoing clinical study.

According U.S. Food Drug Administration's guidance, DMC advises sponsor continuing safety trial subjects recruited trial, well continuing validity scientific merit trial.

Senhwa Biosciences, also operational base San Diego, California, said plans complete clinical trials Silmitasertib (CX-4945) second quarter year. Yes. did. people us magically different people everywhere else. literal anti lockdown protests world. 16/1 “alt-right” groups spreading city aggressive messages towards population saying city actual state lockdown people work commerce die hungry houses municipal government fault. happens one government sphere could/should provide money relief/stimulus federal government still denying covid power offering nothing population hands Bolsonaro loved claiming left alone politicians. don’t know begin reply alt-right though maybe good start would trace federal governments around world provided population help people commerce such? Anyone good start me, maybe already done research news? Oh, source? Actually want see problem fixed. would introduce additional logistical complexities mention societally problematic sort people previously infected treat differently unvaccinated/uninfected. 

I agree would find equally societally problematic sort people vaccinated not, suggested (or already done) lot countries.

Plus countries lacking vaccine doses useful push already infected back line? British variant 60% contagious? That's 1.6x, 15x. Technically its

Ireland + Northern Ireland = Ireland

The name state name island J&amp;J yesterday confirmed Norwegian government able deliver doses EU end April. Since already doses delivered South Africa, don’t find unlikely happen. Norway know nursing home, work veterans home, allowing visitors, employees must wear masks unit yoh must also wear face shield. Temps taken checkpoint even leave cars, etc. also empty units specific need quarantining residents positive come contact someone positive. that's true. plateau now. must imagined Fair. Updated vaccine approved US, many countries shut using based one death may caused. can't find total worldwide doses administered, EU UK 17 million yesterday. amount caution evident possible 1 17 million chance dying good news.

If turns caused vaccine, 2,000 times likely die motor vehicle accident year die vaccine. three vaccines choose from, using different technology AZ vaccine, known deaths caused them. Two many doses administered far AZ vaccine. can't even get AZ vaccine US. within one thread, apologies.

Okay, apology new account 90% posts negative towards AZ vaccine. Pretty obvious.

I would still advise ad hominems. personally would always address argument try refute it. always personal attacks response view opiniom someone holds. brutal year pandemic killed half million Americans, despite unprecedented measures curb spread – including mask-wearing, physical distancing, school closures economic shutdowns

Small quibble. wording suggests measures nothing. nothing nothing. I'm 31 grandma 97. wild. unfortunately dementia can't really see anymore now, still knows voice. Haha yeah nothings worst chin nappies. sure they’re trying fool virus themselves. Honestly hope gets better guys soon. I’m waiting situation get better Poland soon could travel cancer treatment. issue poland also get fined go court win… judges say government can’t make people wear masks businesses refuse service customers without masks also government can’t close businesses. open don’t wear masks shops don’t refuse… there’s hundreds lawsuits always fines government.

hence nobody actually cares… issue production, contract sends vaccine America fill finish.  Hoping get J&amp;J vaccine future. Maybe bad take, already covid want one shot done get with. Hopeful feel okay! Yup. place needs disinfecting. Member states hinted commission take passport shove up. comment xD Eh, kinda. Assuming Anchorage, got something like 170 people per square mile. Brooklyn 36,700 per square mile. Hell, Anchorage fewer people per square mile medium sized southern town grew in. situation, compared people living urban areas, quite different, need different levels caution. saying go fun vaccine, encourage others follow suit without framing situation adequately. live virus vaccine cause positive test. decision us make individually

Oh? ask member small group every person live comfortable group meeting without masks? ask coworkers?

The people you’re considering yourselves. idea, excited happening. elderly are, far, at-risk severe illness death.

 I'm optimistic many states U.S. open vaccine slots adults end March. thing don’t understand, UK said export ban. AstraZeneca saying wanted ship doses UK EU, possible. true?

Both true. uk government spoke sending backed eu rhetoric ramped up. can't send uk order elsewhere without permission done export. really think considering Brazil. Luckily Pfizer delivers according schedule. Imagine that, reliable partner. great need context - compared rest world? Well done! Can't wait turn. end near, once, good thing! accusing AstraZeneca? simply read comments see case.

Perhaps within one thread, sure view think OP spreading

It new account 90% posts negative towards AZ vaccine. Pretty obvious. wonder anything weather.. Texas normally comfortably warm winter overcast northern states people probably spending time outside. Amogus We’ve got crocodiles we’re known gators. people downvoting saying facts? getting ridiculous. Seems like mention anything negative gets shat on.

Not everything gonna sunshine rainbows, people. Cases chance tic back ARE. long vaccines outpace infections we'll fine

Can y'all PLEASE stop telling people get vaccination totally clear Fair points... Since getting vaccinated waiting requisite 2 weeks 2nd dose, wear loosest cotton mask comply policies.

Prior that, wearing tight-fitting silk mask filter Hershels. like reddit largely immune misinformation.

That's interesting take website allowed r/The_Donald exist years lol Right... exactly Israel hogging pfizer vaccines like 9 million people? obsession chili’s?

Well, though, extent. keeps virus circulating, increase odds getting sick even vaccinated. circulates, likely worse variant pop up. arguing giving resources people need more, taking resources someone give people need equally. 

The sickest person getting treatment every country guaranteed sicker least sick person we’re treating right now. don’t need equally. aren’t nearly enough healthy 18 year olds living cancer patients America make redistributive scheme work.

You’re either quibbling thousand doses idea far reaching implications recommendation are. this. name single resource distribute way you’re proposing distribute vaccine (globally, according need) I’ll concede point isn’t batshit insane. saying UK export ban conveniently ignoring fact way producing vaccines UK without obliged deliver vaccines UK first. export banned private contracts instead explicit law.

One export ban though. paid factories set up, get first order. That's usa sitting millions unused authorised doses. even show card ID.

I'm least 35% convinced anyone street could flash fake badge security desk, stand line vaccination center hospital work, get vaccinated. Enter-o-cocci sounds like worm nightmares What? Texas better state Michigan terms death per million people. That's OK, everyone mainland Europe going get wish, oxford vaccine stopped rely solely pfizer vaccine vaccines arrive later year. great thing acting one way 100 times different way 1 time got bases covered. Amazing getting downvoted lol. see whats going here. Exactly. Please stop making stuff up. so. object; ""who"" subject. quite useful. ignorant thing say. 

The entire point vaccinated move life. Yeah, totally bullshit math numbers. Also imply need 6x number. Ever think antibody levels could HIGHER required? Diminishing returns, ring bell? 

Wouldn't Americans ALSO less likely proper immune response covid can't properly generate antibodies vaccine. think MAYBE correlation might, oh idk, even little bit? argument. Effectiveness relative number.

But already agreed last paragraph, literally address main point wrote. I'm parent, let kids get vaccinations yet? enough time passed approve it? think right. really know right thing is. whole thing mess. NM amd centralized system must say working well. register let know time go. Multiple vaccination sites. tell go really organized. really complain. book apt.

I thank actual laugh, think actually proved right, thanks that.

Yes, that's happened here, seem overlook studies using MoH datasets.

You're welcome, wonderful rest life. now. hope smart enough keep down. nice get options wait. :( Random question, green card American citizen get appointment/vaccine? This. like since January put words mouth twice, even close saying, really know help you. Translation: even close done July Oh!! Thanks clarifying!! :) really no. We're holding steady around 60,000 new cases per day. good all. health experts also saying It’s hard believe people actually stupid.  You’re conveniently leaving something separates us countries us. 

This magical little thing called vaccines. Mine 101 actually measured. highest fever I've while. agree worth though, especially since good within 24 hours.  Yeah elected Biden... hence gone soon. Ah okay, thought case damn, it’s even him— there’s hundreds good people worked make happen regardless politics. Smh can. don’t listen Fauxci  33k car deaths 2019, hardly comparable Covid. said thing every country went another lockdown. fucking cares Fauci says point?  Still looking 100% number, huh?

Should've cited sources before, we're talking completely different things. numbers displaying 99.2% (and referenced article) simple count hospitalized percentage.

The study cited 97% study (by pfizer) includes demographically matched data - completely different methodology. think actually proved right, 97% number higher NEJM study uses methodology. thanks that. get sentiment. subreddit optimistic lately. educate lot rich Chinese dont they? Even US believe Here’s good one journal: It’s totally false, understanding several women even got pregnant vaccine trials problem. I'm SF things loosening quickly. I've seen restaurants North Beach packed indoor dining. feel comfortable indoor dining yet, case counts low. Ah, right. probably don’t want take advice someone who’s dealt infectious diseases five decades (and turned tide AIDS epidemic). bet local governments going fine. /s EU ones AZ doesn’t sound like exported uk EU nations?

Here’s thing. vast majority variants cannot super rare case reinfection og wuhan strain. sketchy SA/Brazil variants still aren’t big worry front. Esp vaccinated folks. Brazil thing you’re citing debunked. Manaus never herd immunity. discussed length science COVID-19 sub thought pretty clear here. lane. Warp Speed funded research development 6 vaccines. Pfizer one them. 

The government commit buying Pfizer vaccines, get FDA approval, funds came Warp Speed.

* ""Pfizer chose risk money vaccine research take federal funding order avoid bureaucracy politics, Pfizer’s CEO Albert Bourla said. said investment far least $1.5 billion.
* 
* ""I wanted liberate scientists bureaucracy,"" Bourla told CBS September. ""When get money someone always comes strings. want see going progress, type moves going do. want reports. want that.
* 
* ""Basically gave open checkbook worry scientific challenges, anything else,"" said. ""And also, wanted keep Pfizer politics, way."" guarantee vaccinated Americans get infected (and seriously ill/dead) significantly higher rate Israel, think agree this, 

We unvaccinated group. Therefor, efficacy similar data Israel, within expected margin error.

But *so many more* complications Americans Israelis lower initial antibody defense vaccines begin with. 

Total bullshit napkin math numbers, but, assume average Israeli gets 6x antibody response vaccine degenerative effect/major policy change, okay?

Before consideration comes play, Americans average going get 4-5x response, right bat, get complication.

So no, margin error going cut it, WAY Americans going MUCH sick vaccine literally less effective veins, that's first hurdle.  It’s actually rather nice leading world COVID-relating thing positive once? three lockdowns, Petri dish schools, *Eat Help Out*, one highest per capita death rates anywhere Earth, collapse swathes entertainment industry... it’s nice good news once.

Then again, refuse get optimistic see hard numbers, seen hard numbers solid month two. can’t hear people saying “we’re well now” without also hearing ghostly echo ears last September. time different, know, forgive cautious. Last time different too, look got us. would absolutely get father evaluation medical professionals pulse-ox 90 positive covid test. new variants reinfect people recovered covid could start new outbreak. believe me, go look what's happening Brazil... massive explosion virus country theoretically herd immunity now. 😂😂 Sorry... still sure think lane like 😜 it’ll nice go back staying inside choice valid reasons afraid Americans states didn’t report today. don’t think that’s accurate. Tomorrow slightly accurate. Sweden going herd immunity myth That's 100% AZ. AZ applied approval States, they're dragging feet (they say month), especially since company recent scrutiny nations (such Ireland, Thailand, Norway) vaccine bad effects (e.g., blood clots). UK locked down. 

SA younger population although lots AIDS patients mean... mRNA vaccines development like 10 years prior covid. alter covid. yes, choice important means people get vaccinated.  Lying public effectiveness masks people can't trusted make informed decisions downplaying effect vaccination ending pandemic order prolong relevance spotlight. Blows mind, cost benefit equation. Masks cost almost nothing, level distancing, least indoor minimal cost. We’re close end this, can’t people little bit neighbor little longer.

I don’t know say year in, it’s you. Yeah individuals odds survival even minor symptoms really good getting better, average everyone gets transmits it, someone else gets sick sooner later someone dies. say successful 70-80% adults fully vaccinated, far maybe 10%. best evidence evidence saying affects fertility.

You could also google search first 20 links probably convince her.

Ask sources real scientific journal, tell mother law believe crackpot theories. Ding osterholm said January UK variant would cause massive third wave March. Hmmmm know bet it’s infectious asymptomatic people r symptomatic due higher viral loads Maybe get it, effectiveness vaccine based rate infection vaccinated population VERSUS rate unvaccinated population. Something like Israel much looser restrictions vaccinated group worst case scenario number.

 guarantee vaccinated Americans get infected (and seriously ill/dead) significantly higher rate Israel, think agree this, unvaccinated group. Therefor, efficacy similar data Israel, within expected margin error. pearl clutching. whole point darn tier system clearly outline metrics necessary. well met metrics it’s good enough? stop think it’s reference story Transmission rates among vaccinated people shown minimal. concern new evidence showing it’s common originally thought. Let vaccinated people celebrate man. locked year people finally get immunity, it’s time treat vacation see family haven’t seen months. people vaccinated everyday adults fully vaccinated summer. could another spike then, minor spike won’t lead many deaths severe cases high risk groups vaccinated. That’s cool!

Here Massachusetts, majority births mothers 30 older decades now. Due this, fleetingly peers (30-somethings) living grandparents even fewer kids living grandparents they’re 30s. Insulting someone's intelligence resorting ad-hominem makes look weak pathetic. Congrats. thought states prioritization.

The CDC gives recommendations states state plan (mostly using CDC plan starting point). shot 2. flu like symptoms weekend alllll good. Super excited immune Covid French gov anti vaccine got J&amp;J save dumbass place 3 million doses ? That’s bad France 67 million. mean it’s inline much EU exactly lane then? I’ll wait still drive cars fatal traffic accidents? soon East Bay pretty much everything open capacity except movie theaters, etc. news outlets going report covid gone? Cool. fucking get mine??? insulting insist someone wrong can't google, ""hospitalization death.""

[Down date group above).

You need link 92, right?

You one, yeah? You’re right. I’m still going wear mask social distance. mean me, might finally go eat, get haircut, go movie...things many people throughout pandemic. However, summer hits everyone wants vaccine get one though, think bets off.

A Facebook friend mine complaining day covid can’t see kids. She’s nurse eligible vaccine since January. Someone comments called said didn’t trust vaccine, regrets now. people left without vaccines people like her, I’m done putting life hold. yes, realize people might able vaccinated medical reasons, probably staying home reach herd immunity. Yes, Israel good test theory. different possibilities: 

1) Israel basically achieves herd immunity vaccination cases eventually get zero. Mutations occur countries impact effectiveness vaccination therefore Israel remains virus free. 

2) mutation Israel get vaccine-resistant strain (called ""Israel Variant"") virus attacks everyone already vaccinated.

3a) Israel drives cases near zero, mutation occurs another country vaccine resistant. new vaccine-resistant variant gets Israel spreads among population despite almost everyone vaccinated.

3b) Israel drives cases near zero, mutation occurs another country vaccine resistant. Israel manages maintain tight border controls prevents new vaccine-resistant variant spreading there. would probably achieve putting incoming travelers quarantine enter country. 

The first scenario best scenario. Second worst. 3a pretty bad, 3b alright. 

What policies would recommend instead? think really good solutions. mass vaccinations might potentially make things much worse, vaccinating might better vaccinating middle pandemic. 

I'm sure really know point. Maybe bubble vulnerable people let virus run course. 

Maybe try get certain geographic areas completely free covid gradually try expand areas. point, almost seems like impossible task.

Maybe government nothing let people businesses decide do. Maybe send vitamin pills everyone something like that. 

I agree vaccines potential get us situation... also potential make situation much worse. would hold mass vaccination know more. Maybe try one country, keep boarders super tight create vaccine-resistant variant, spread around world. See possible completely eliminate virus without consequences small scale attempting globally. Maybe pick island nation test case variant created viral immune escape, spread around whole world. No, didn’t. I’m fluent hillbilly. fun guns fighting COVID private businesses. Typhoid Mary .... enough said. point? bottom line still exceptionally well despite bugs there. tell totally cool less fertile want kids, see plays Haha, that’s good EMA pro-AZ (or anti-AZ). EMA simply far reason doubt safety vaccine. even talking about? world live laws hugging?? words, read page 149 bill opinions it.

And questions... Good news - last week, got [an Israeli showing Pfizer vaccine ~94% effective preventing even asymptomatic infection! get infected virus, shed. So, least 94% effective preventing spread. sort incentive suggest? Imo, “jumping line” irrelevant point. people desperately need it, likely gotten now. desperately need haven’t gotten it, chosen get/don’t take seriously. vaccines need go people, it’s absolute shame wasted. happen luck get vaccine, take it, don’t feel bad. vaccinated eventually, getting month earlier “you’re supposed to” doesn’t make much difference. 

But hey, opinion. You’re fucking delusional, hope never leave home again. downvoted 17 million Oxford/Aztrazeneca vaccinations administered worldwide 37 cases blood clots reported. proven casual link blood clots vaccine time. many 900,000 people affected (1 2 per 1,000) year United States alone clotting events without getting vaccinated all. Correlation equal causation. 37 cases blood clots 17 million outpacing amount clotting issues would occurred anyway within general population. still quite ways go, rate, U.S. reach herd immunity midsummer Vaccine trust high Pfizer Moderna

German here. social context, almost everyone, including people sceptical vaccinations general, positive towards BioNTech/Pfizer Moderna vaccines. time, everyone hesitant outright hostile towards AZ product. terms vaccine acceptance, huge mistake ever give approval AZ product. know people eligible COVID-19 vaccination make appointment afraid would receive AZ product. Yea, we're nation comorbidities. ""LOL, impact people 70!"" early stage diabetic, obese, high blood pressure fairly normal. 45% Americans high blood pressure, 1 3 prediabetic, 42.4% Americans obese. There's still long road go go ""The people left low risk!"" EU vaccine nationalism again. Scaremongering safe vaccine British cover terrible vaccination procurement scheme. could virtue signal without though!? margins live events razor thin. Anything short 100% available capacity going enough justify full reopening. 25% capacity restaurant reduced staff. Reduced sporting event attendance still generate TV revenue. Concerts shows really work way, general. 

I miss live events immensely hope we'll see return summer. Woah never tought Id see reddit! Jokes aside we’re good logistics things require money, time come soon too! Pfizer actually delivering, understand people attack them. AZ bit disaster. single bill helps Americans directly, passed within couple months Biden's projected 48, 25% deficit left last 48 months?

Did happen read page 149 bill linked to?

And know percentage previous deficit helped Americans directly, all? numbers acceptable deficits helps Americans directly? This. Birth control leads thrombosis rates 20 times higher reported now.

It’s insane. bureaucrats dream. used work Novartis plant Marburg (now BioNTech) 5 years ago. 

Paul Ehrlich Institute German, bureaucratic mindfuck ive ever chance work with. Age 24, doses Moderna done. effects sore arm sore lymph nodes first dose. Second dose got rash. 

That's it. 

I ran four miles days got it, 18 two days dose two. yeah right mean saying quasi ineffective encouraging people get much shooting foot could say evil muslims steal doses meant partiotic hard-working americans. gonna suspend distribution days resuming it.

It's easy suspend distribution vaccine fuck what. lied lost credibility. could’ve told people make t-shirts, no, chose lie. depends prevalence &amp; positivity locale. Even within SoCal, zipcodes &amp; neighborhoods minimal covid, meanwhile crowded urban barrios ghettos still double digit positivity. safe way wear N95/KN95 like going plane. number theaters around you, try find one located upscale community lot Seniors, go off-hours/matinee. Silver lining means vaccine working. body learning fight. Get lots rest make sure drinking water. Sorry obvious advice lot people drink nearly enough water dehydrated really impact fast feel better. definitely true countries better reporting - given specific symptoms result hospitalisation, intensive care admittal even death, vaccines SII going nearly solely healthcare workers, would noticed.

And UKs reporting definitely good, there's many detailed reports published weekly detailing every moderate severe reaction.

Note India UK administered AZ doses entire EU (the UK least double own, sure India probably more) there's too. part makes sound bad? made Washington sound bad, yes, Starbucks. chance healthy 20 year olds medical front line workers? I'd hope understand people might find AZ particularly untrustworthy. Fight? activist judges India stick noses everything? matter national security national welfare anything judiciary related. I’ve thinking useful would flu. reason current flu vaccines hit-and-miss start growing viral material far advance, guess strain going dominant year. There’s lot less prep time needed mRNA vaccines, they’ll accurate idea strains vaccinate against.

Heck, might even figure way make universal flu vaccine, take guesswork entirely. none taken agencies following procedures trust outcome investigations thorough AZ vaccine investigate doesn’t signal vaccine unsafe, signals strict scrutiny. If/when cleared again, tomorrow weeks, wills signal safety vaccine even confirmed.

While might intended message, it’s necessarily one received people hesistant vaccine. They’ll focus fact serious enough incident suspended vaccinations “better safe sorry” don’t want risk getting it.

And knock-on effects people feel can’t trust drug trials vaccines missed this. It’ll give support claim rushed thorough. Says guy even bother focus self-manufacturing creating homegrown, domestically produced made-in-Canada vaccine. He's relying purchasing imports foreign-made vaccines countries overseas. eating popcorn, mask wont movie. vaccine proven provide 94% sterilizing immunity. problem people don’t wanna get vaccinated. AMONG US I'd guess manufacturing error.

Doubt UK hiding data. thought already said safe. Kind of? absolutely sketchy. Sets awful precedent too. happens future authoritarian leader like Hungary's Orban decides make harder certain groups get vaccine order demoted second class EU citizen? great question.

Getting good reporting data hard enough accurately compile is, but, optimally, EU officials would tracking manufactured batches (lot numbers), they're going, getting them. 😱 Mogus got Pfizer allergic penicillin sulfa. fine little side effects. scientific links case study 'rare cerebral vein thrombosis' ? really Miami 5300 cases day compared NYC’s 6670 despite NYC 16 times population  percentage people blood clots vaccine absolutely tiny comparison rolled dice Corona died. lived, great.

That's yesterday's data. sunday's tend least reported days. Today likely see bump. Yeah you. still hoping continued decline case counts, also totally surprising end idling pretty persistently high case count better protection hospitalization death due widespread vaccination adults. Time tell. Sounds good me. never pay much attention downvotes. Echo chambers looking comments entertain us usually happen.

I think lot good discussion Reddit sometimes though good.

I agree, probably 1-2% drivers “doing whatever want” road. It’s decision based science.

I know British tabloids frame different way! children. sure good thing ends minimal linkage wonder countries regret lot. Every day matters vaccines weekend Southern California first weekend felt normal since started. population done I've posted times, might seem repetitive who've seen break state state, give good idea global participants, US whole. Graphs near bottom. Notable features include significant hump deaths around march /april primary affected travel hub nations, trailing rise secondary infected countries eastern europe, russia, parts south america. Exactly god able save brain cells restrictions lifted  Probably not. I've already vaccinated. Oregon general public won’t eligible several months still people going spring break likely months now. It’s pretty safe assume exposed Covid story month going convincing vaccine hesitant people get shots. Approving AZ counterproductive that.

It’s dumb &amp; unfortunate personally hope isn’t approved basis. poster replying called several heavy lockdown states, hence comment. want see lockdowns affect covid, let's look much relevant death metrics, vs meaningless case numbers NY NJ, poster children lockdown come first second. Looking back holiday caused spike New York last year? natural spread virus without distancing masks? already vaccine, thanks.

Israel pls let Yeah, seems like doses distributed much higher though..

If supposed 240 million doses delivered April 1, means need send 105 million next 15 days = ~6.5M day.

1. zero commute time costs
2. dealing troublesome kids
3. supposed last 2.5 hours day districts
4. Half teachers even seem teach long

&amp;#x200B;

And now, teachers actually get paid teach Zoom got teach classroom.

I can't believe people seriously think teachers want return class ""when safe.""  Canada. grandma still gotten vaccinated. 💉🚀💉🚀 Compared several hundred? Certain areas Michigan open everybody now. got first dose Moderna vaccine today. Massachusetts 270k, that's less 5 days worth. 
Pennsylvania million, still little weeks worth. (They caught bunch recently started school staff.) taking side here, providing link. else supposed relieve nice vaca Hawaii? pretty obviouss trolling, dude. one wants wear mask reason rest lives. even make sense. check posts. schtick. ask straight out. Maybe never seen trolling internet before? Maybe unfamiliar sarcasm? knows. they're arguments, lol. They're CDCs. course correct. hundreds thousands maskless spring breakers refused social distance come back Florida, going problem. like saw Christmas new years celebrations. enough people vaccinated shit yet. Please consult physician. Pretty sure doctor could ethically provide guidance without knowing father's particular case. anyone else qualified. Less, given effective vaccine compared flu shot. Thanks! I'm still playing safe, least couple weeks second dose.

Thanks! Clearly bottling capacity EU, since managed set short notice. days ago J&amp;J insisted bottling must happen US. I’m relieved “our” doses confiscated US per US export regulations. I'm 47, life grew left long long ago. farts

Is really thing? Anti vaxxers going go bonkers this, even US AstraZeneca vaccine isn’t even used. Personally think big false alarm create vaccine hesitancy. Yeah welcome EU, enjoy stay never concerned hesitant. Based demographic groups want get vaccinated, can't help notice line very, closely people higher average infection rates. Infection gives similar immunity levels vaccination. They're getting immunized lethal means, that's choice. something concerns me. Thanks, that's really helpful. Yup, that's tax money work. Money that's supposed used PPE instead used fund lazy, selfish teachers. teachers get paid money teach Zoom 2.5 hours day. Yeah like remarks everyone job work home, also expecting people totally limit sphere social interaction household year literally delusional, mean ever done long human history? Part reason ""tons"" doses thrown away clinics lax guidelines because.... supply outstripping demands tons places. prevent risk getting shot

That's mentioned specifically places way demand supply. Despite people lying and/or clinics even asking eligibility STILL plenty shots go around lot areas around USA. think countries success ivermectin ignore fact US ordered vaccines JJ nearly eight months ago start exporting finished product EU manufactured EU? 

The EU didn’t place orders timely manner US UK front queue. Stop mad people front queue mad people put back queue.

My dad 75 years old city health system beginning vaccinate people age group Coronavac. However, January discovered kidney disease. vaccinated? know! leaves us ""hey look me"" virtue signaling bragging posts acquaintances.

&amp;#x200B;

/s - case painfully obvious. particular cases show immunity earlier variants not? (were previously infected earlier strains?) so, immunized period immunity starting fade (the 8 month cuttoff) ? America really good lot. BAD nationwide collective action led government. circumstances I'm actually ok that, things like pandemics reveal double edge sword. could even worse getting rid virus. emagine going president, he'll start world war tweet read still make vaccines dont know talking about. see lung doctor think could make difference even mild-moderate covid could devastating already great lung stuff.  forgot 5: noone interest finding issues UK

i judge possibility not. I’m getting vaccinated tomorrow Sacramento. It’s d@mn time. long time. Imagine public outcry inmates get go literally anyone else. top still get assholes argue shouldnt waste good money them. It’s clear true. vague reference contract Europe requires production needing filled US. say US mandated that. Given US party contract, seems issue J&amp;J EU.

Reading lines, seems like enough production capability complete full process locally (in Europe) therefore meet contractual targets, final stages vaccines must completed US plant. again, clear wording article vague. I’m sorry think are?

Someone literally watch Fauci lie later admit lie. changing stance.. literally openly admitted lying. I'll post evidence I'm computer like, block then. responses really pathetic far, suspect I'm blocking next one. EU countries. Countries advanced stages negotiating vaccine deals, EU called back make big show unity waste 3 months.

What's even worse national leaders could told EU suck complied anyways (don't want ruin chances getting sweet EC job pension line) I'm asking blindly respect people. I'm asking respect scientific process public health decisions come it. We're time we've made science enemy actual virus. 

I encourage revisit stances. Good luck.  talking gene therapy? guys dont make it? developed netherlands made either netherlands belgium. guys put bottle put label it. Thats it. export ban dont know get back send get bottled. need make bottling facility EU done april. yeah kinda problem believe time wrote comment Arizona’s death rate 60% higher California’s. 33,000 lives aren’t significant? Anywhere see daily number vaccines administered brand? Danish medical authority = ""the EU""

Norway Iceland = ""the EU""

EMA = ""the EU""

Indonesia = ""the EU"" believe San Francisco 30, almost realized I'd going public point summer. they're successful creating pan-coronavirus vaccine, absolutely could eradicated. then, we're playing whack-a-mole variants, there's basically 0 chance ever truly eradicate it, although might get point nobody dies it. totally hear that. I'm also waiting. extremely difficult wait—I want go back life. partner decided we're going wait turn, use personal connections privileged information jump line. worth, know waiting alone. Wow, amount assumptions draw saying blindly respect someone insane, especially considering much try respect fact reason.

Nothing said political. spoke reasonable fact, claim love. need rethink statements. wonder will... Nah, same.

The issue reported Pfizer Moderna. also extremely unlikely caused vaccin.

Heck issue reported one-per-three-million vaccinations.

And statistically higher people get vaccin.

It's good double double double check. still much ado nothing Interesting. mean would still prefer mRNA cause real world data efficacy looks little stronger data wise wouldn’t waited offered J&amp;J. Either way doesn’t matter cause already second shot Moderna. Idk states seems NJ getting barely J&amp;J. sure function us good storage capacity sites J&amp;J we’re getting almost three weeks according governor. not. know certainty vaccines prevent symptomatic infection exceptionally high rate. data yet conclusive, suggestive also prevent high rates asymptomatic infection, well. 

I think confusion stems vaccine effectiveness measured, communicated. saying supported Trump saying believed flu, bad fever fatigue muscle ache? Thanks! figured ""...at least one dose"" would include second one well, makes sense. still get fuckwits think altering DNA simply shares letters NA dont know actual difference paid fuck attention biology class kid school. Whoops think anti vaxxers confused people trust government.

Most speak want vaccine agree vaccines general. one That's part reason I'm confused what's going Europe. medical experts seem surprised happening, said there's like special protocol needs used treat patients prevent brain hemorrhages. think 1 2 deaths here, maybe there's difference treatments something? Idk  Thursday. said vaccine safe based data received UK/India/etc. primarily administer AZ vaccine. mean single batch vaccine made different factory could've faulty. point moot, gave reason government takes seriously comes making public health policy citizens. Yeah moving fairly quickly think quite much urgency part herd immunity achieved without kids MHRA collaborating EMA investigation. tons throwm way, prevent risk getting shot. capita Florida somewhere middle states excess deaths.

Perhaps learn bit statistics, particularly concept per capita data. already understand concept perhaps use rather posting misleading information sounds crazy, might genetic. People Finland noticed association narcolepsy particular [swine flu Finnish people world's highest concentration HLA-DQB1 gene, one predisposes people narcolepsy. Somehow vaccine triggered people. Oh, makes sense. figured ""...at least one dose"" includes 2nd round well. long think it'll take get everyone April 5th? hope add ability book appt right app. would huge. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since personal data already, pretty easy implement. :) worry luck lasting? good thing cases going vaccinations going up? talk hopeful US new surge cases  Actually European standard 1 meter, 2, believe. US Super Sized 6'. What? vaccine entirely designed produced EU usa. ship them.to guys get bottled. thing put bottle put lable it. uncertainty caused export ban need make bottling facility isnt done till april. yeah USA blame here. 40m second doses, complete vaccinations. ""Boooo!!! AZ vaccine bad!!""

Why making comments exist? news stories medical issue

The experts matter definitely disagree you: know even tried yet suffering long. inflammatory disease...get rid inflammation pain goes away. That's steroids do. TL:DR: headline misleading, disease endemic similar less impact seasonal flu. mental physical health society destroyed due prolonged arbitrary lockdowns, significantly assist reducing spread population whole. areas (those states) better handled health society whole.   I'm nurse takes least 3 triage calls day patients concerns vaccine get. answer almost every question ""Doesn't matter, get ASAP"" Germany probably anti-science Country EU tho, regretted lot. 


Time move populist hell tbh, unfortunate week EU. didn’t know US didn’t approve AZ. explain link sources why? yeah, sorry hear man. frustrating scary. wish best y'all. really DING level headline I'd like watch Ding Hotez jello wrestle biggest scare monger title. it’s worth, one EMT coworkers contracted covid early July, tested negative contracted christmas eve severe symptoms. saw natural immunity period ~6 months. Truly hope Moderna Pfizer offer longer term immunity that.  There's definitely psychological barrier. Hopefully us get vaccinated positive results others feel reassured. much time spent America past year? adults, 85% 16+ either recovered least 1 dose. They're already prepaid. Trump bought vaccines, Pfizer delivering. end using 60 million them, goes government Pfizer Well, blood clots extremely common medical issue. Millions people getting jab daily, extremely likely coincidence.

To add it, countries (like mine) vaccine still given people pre existing medical conditions. People heart disease lung disease manner conditions would also carry risk blood clots.

I got Astra zenica jab today. feel fine far check back week I'll let know died. unreasonable through. people thinking know scientists dedicated lives this. Okie 😁 That's awesome. Thanks. I'm Serbia. EU countries want take risks mRNA vaccines, spent time haggling prices...when would worth shelling hundreds vaccine one person reopen vaccine. Israel better targeted testing. We've always confirmed cases, look hospitalization deaths see completely different story.

Israel 17 daily average deaths last week, that's equivalent 615 deaths US, US 1288. double Israeli number. people think California open eligibility all?

I started calling around get waitlist extra doses got nowhere. Starting get impatient :| would indication numbers faked? Texas high numbers recently Definitely possible, extremely improbable. AZ says 60 testing production 20 done independents. top that, batch tested following events.

Also batches account millions vaccines, cases seem localized.  Nobody wants admit Norway, Iceland, Thailand Indonesia EU countries.

If politics involved, would stopping vaccinations easier nothing stake AZ delivers nothing anyway. alive? Yeah, doubt storage. could factory produced from. common factor EU getting AZ factories within EU? know conspiracy stuff AZ smuggling vaccine UK, doubt true. 

Stumbled across article: difficult set different factories different countries exactly thing - might right - **IF** really problem. would certainly explain incidences EU countries get supplies know? work education (age health wise, would qualify yet otherwise) closed event Thursday I'll get first dose, Pfizer. Philadelphia. I'm sure cities northeast still case. let lunatics get down, easy trust me. vaccines rolling ridiculously fast pace contrary everyone thinks, need vaccinate every human country order stop this. Jabbing vulnerable first (as are) end this, close.

I also try remind Corona subreddit all. imagine years memory, still people posting potential surges sheltering place. Pay mind. ridiculous decision, data 10m+ AZ doses given within UK alone show increased risk blood clotting. issue batch related rather widespread problem

And batch related, problem? next batch? AZ failing continuously produce vaccine properly? Wait vaccination help protect people around him? still transmit virus even you’re vaccinated. They're likely die car way school. That’s thing though...I don’t know stores go without mask even today. Got Moderna today. sat back car started laughing! never thought would happen. 

1/10 soreness scale yeah, I’m waiting hit later tonight unable sleep. honestly might comforting even know it’s working.

2nd dose bit nightmare, oh worth done it. April 12th! Spanish company Reig Jofre also fill-and-finish Janssen? Little confused need sent US fill-and-finish.  


Or maybe production set way fluid/substance manufacturing sites needed supply many fill-and-finish factories make final product? ever subreddit complain u.s wants vaccinate population give away Brazil. stop including previously infected vaccinated though separate groups 

In Israel mostly are, recently get vaccinated recovered. 1% 56% vaccinated also recovered, strictly first doses. Yes gone slightly since posted said symptoms seen 3rd week (not sure many days though), extrapolated back infection 2nd week. Maybe national electoral politics, reputation concerned safety vaccines, handling pandemic.

In unexpected turn events, institute cares vaccine safety pandemics issue recommendation based vaccine safety pandemic handling. Helps forget origin Kansas Flu

Well 1) common name Spanish Flu, 2) Maybe calling 1918 Flu since we're supposed using names locations epidemic naming. fact Europe locking crazy...how slow vaccination?  Someone Reddit = ""the amount anti British sentiment exactly anti European sentiment"" Probably hardest hit country. vaccine. break population receiving vaccine smaller smaller blocs course likely see statistical anomalies smaller blocs get evened whole population.

&amp;#x200B;

I think justification could run concern specific batch / contamination, seem they're reacting. Everyone SF recently saying ""LoOk STupId TExaS iS"" I've responding ""I want part experiment, hope goes well sake"" hooray! 🥳 One journalist = ""the German media"" doesn’t harm U.K. way. 

The EU would like scapegoat U.K. failings vaccines, making look silly ‘the U.K. stealing vaccines’ ‘the U.K. hoarding vaccine supplies’. mention individual governments saying AZ quasi-effective 65s.

The EMA, MHRA say it’s fine. really political act caused lack vaccine trust especially ‘the British vaccine’. blaming EU? states individually suspended somministration J&amp;J vaccine AZ vaccine use platform lmao Maybe Europe wasn’t haggling price non-profit vaccine could secured stronger procurement logistics.

But British people said AZ vaccine sold cost that's UK generous nation world? haggle price something sold profit? Could one wrong?

Nah, British EU bad. Many people know though Good luck!  thing called learning. try still case? Lol “all that”? half dozen sentences? won’t read you’ll comment telling go away? works. 

You could’ve responded instead shouting idiocy haha.  bare minimum, normalize taking days work/school feeling well. U.K’s Independent MHRA scientists using data recommending jab safe. Everyone using data it’s fair expect different outcomes. always human element involved decisions like these. It’s funny reddit preaches skepticism wealthy hates large corporations unless they’re drug companies immune civil complaints.

Frankly think benefits vaccine outweigh risks shit ton people someone legitimately cannot understand another person would hesitant they’re closed minded None restaurants like (In NYC). I've also dined places country never experienced that. sure live, issues sound uncommon. Food slightly overpriced ($15 - $20 meal), mean time people, enjoyable. going break bank paying little socialization environment. Hmmm. vaccine likely contributed killing 50,000 punches head. Interesting. ""Corona problem, old people die, 0.3% dies, reopen everything!""

""I 0.006% chance blood clots. I'm taking vaccine!""  Well last time flattened curve exact thing started entire new wave. take genius figure out. find really interesting UK we're still splitting age way 18, age brackets 40-49, 30-39 30, whereas US seems making free-for-all 50 45. Given there's significant death rate difference start getting 50 see why, splitting age definitely help manage demand.  Send Canada please \\o/

We still 1.5% population fully vaccinated. BC rollout still high-risk conditions seniors 80+. might also help alleviate sting Trump attempting block medical supply shipments last year.  guys bottles labels? Seems like something else play... Surely must realize incredibly stupid read comments random people internet claiming BS bad faith, first hand experience opposite.

I see would easier see shortcomings, though, can't even correctly describe situation. honestly getting pathetic, burrowing ground realize arguments hold up, help you.

Don't feel little bad constant misinformation spreading. make obvious propaganda account wanted ... higher IQ Idaho residents bwahahahaha! 

OK wanted get bearing like.

Enjoy stay South Dakota. 
After all, pretty hard manage highest death rate covid WORLD one point, one lowest population densities world. Quite feat.

My favourite story friends unfortunately live South Dakota got kicked auto dealership insisted wearing masks height pandemic.  im ready TWERK Population-weighted density. Can't someone please please please open sort program get doses ""non-essential"" recipients want get vaccinated can't? would, present, crawl 10 miles broken glass get vaccine. I'm ""essential"" qualify anything yet. someone eligible want doses, give someone like me? case EU, individual countries. instance Norway (which halted Astrazeneca vaccination) part EU here, Belgium, continue AstraZeneca vaccination. even started today vaccination bigger scale, bit delay due planning building bit vaccine buffer protect e.g. always reliable 'best effort'- delivery AstraZeneca. sending people back home vaccine available also good (that happened already last months). talk New York variant potentially reinfecting, can't find evidence it. would figure folks reinfected, stories would news. wrong? Income health tightly interconnected. People start caring basic things sanitation struggling feed families. middle class increases, governments also improve leading long-term gains. One main issues flu jab basically guess variants show year (note flu variants different cross-immunity really thing like covid variants) one main losses efficacy fact many cases involve variants vaccinate for.

However, new research suggest there's factors play (such immune response) mRNA technology help with. hitting 95% though.  Well suppose everyone around Cold War. from, mind sharing? see comments lot agree views, wanted kinda say hi hahahah (extremely weird, know) YASSSSSS ""Usually"" fun word throw around. No, ""usually,"" not, also means ""sometimes,"" do. [This article PE DVTs forming ITP patients. think point lot people trying make numbers significant enough point causation (only correlation), that, numbers, AZ slightly safer Pfizer vaccine (and say someone preferred took Pfizer vaccine). think perfectly valid countries investigate occurrences also can't start forming opinions information simply deny findings inconvenient knee jerk conclusions come to. EU exporting lot vaccines least Putin might actually deliver vaccine agreed upon, would make Russia better ally UK.

The entire reason behind manufacturer certain British vaccine delivering basically nothing. way day later ones? Yeah I’m seeing well. Normalization vaccine becoming rampant desire return normal. know people hated idea taking vaccine vaccinated type 16 deaths Saturday. deaths island Sunday. onus prove it? mom prove hers? Point is, EU put export restrictions vaccines like UK done. ? Another one forbidden subs point. r/t_d took place LONG time ago. Lol blind optimism? know sub on? think match up. people hospital ECMOs received one dose. woman hospital 2 doses second dose week ago I’m honestly glad vaccines distributed quicker also raises possible problem: 

people end carried away safety, thinking it’s okay follow covid procedures, would put people risk even though rate getting covid decreased. Ever since governor lifted covid procedures could uprise covid cases depending people deal covid. people able grasp seriousness pandemic start wouldn’t many deaths throughout months. Lockdown shouldn’t lifted, people should’ve spent time trying stay safe instead protesting, might’ve able handle situation effectively. I’m still eligible one haha  vaccine still shelf life even stored correctly. 

The side effects seen general population. Many countries still using vaccine. US would liable side effects sold vaccine another country, suggest ridiculous. countries approval process care FDA says. already dismissed claims. getting tired jabs US.

I see might wanted there. Haha! personally: makes suspicious AZ, far vaccines not, knowledge, issues like this. I’m worried presently. picture you. problem. helping fellow American. great day Clearly *Everybody Dance Now* Tell boomer Yeah we're definitely gonna cancel everything next 3 years 70% world vaccinated  Lol, taking credit vaccine refusing take public... baffling know single Americans racist, dumb, uneducated, sociophobic, knows use internet? 

Americans bigger problem russians internet. real problem come 80% opposing 20% many people read headlines go straight reading comments. comments dominated one agenda, agenda influence people. Numbers? Yeah, numbers small say vaccine caused events (CI overlaps zero). Numerically higher mean say there's statistical certainty caused vaccine. way every year flu. Just, no. Trump influence like baby gun. honestly trust fuck saying ""I got vaccine people say made aborted babies"" something?

I mean banned Twitter reason. Asking say stuff would enable ego Thank posting this! Okay. Breakthrough cases literally guarantee vaccine 100% effective. less 100% means. absolutely happening. Like second link search linked doctor saying that. Wtf dude? 

Please review follow data antibody titers next question. Last check gone up, decreased little become stable plateau. Classic controls system (which body many of, including immune response) 

How use collective antibody response anything?

How this, metric, mean metric, show American's antibody response due something poor immune health? 

Most rest pure speculation entertain. worse vaccine does, need policies place, better everyone vaccinated.

Cool, still tied back vaccine effectiveness. showed 100% figure. really interested unsubstantiated ramblings arguing ignorance(thats real term, im calling dumb). can't tell I'm wrong things ""really complex"" even provide explanation would impact thing I'm talking started whole conversation.

Please stop changing goalposts. want get detailed explanation, I'm ears. please go tangents. California really detailed plans allowing reopening counties hit certain benchmarks cases per 100k test positivity rates. isn’t like Texas reopening fully, smart taking slow. San Francisco positivity rate 1% less 5 cases per 100k people day, masks still worn everywhere. bonus points call spring breakers millenials consistently promising delivering.

I totally fine that. Much better guy promised us world every two weeks. time virus brand spanking new damn idea long pandemic would last. It’s natural people freaking considering worst case scenarios.  makes glad don’t believe science otherwise they’d better understanding natural selection. Uhh yeah, Florida *is* rich fuck. That's point. *seen* number old rich white conservatives here? UK make AZ, European leaders shit talked restricted use face minimal evidence.  think right. people think stay lockdown ages.

I live Sydney. lockdown since first one April-ish last year. Guidelines policies Didn’t health officials say thing months ago? Even true, significant majority Americans vaccinated then. people expecting announce Twitter? Usually, elerly start fearing death younger people, knowing live much long anymore. 100 Americans die per day, average, car accidents. We’re yet.  I'm happy guys. I'm British expat stuck 3rd world Europe chance getting vaccine summer. still pay national insurance I'm hoping fly back vaccine turn. vulnerable population vaccinated 

I friend suppressed immune system co-morbidities. trouble getting vaccination slot. found one. first shot scheduled Thursday.

I another friend still finding vaccination slots people. oh QLD doctor? Ok... week it'll zero cases again.... point is, covid circulating community. vaccinated, let it'll around like common cold. believe real scientist reddit arm chair ""scientist""  Nothing 100% safe. vaccine, medicine; hell, everyday activity like driving car 100% safe. Please show data ""breakthrough transmissions

There yet, new. First datasets 3-6 months now, earliest, we're report now.

Search ""breakthrough infection covid"" search bar.

It even happening quickly (I want sound alarmist, like escape mutations, happening quicker people predicted 'should'), [but short? two shots + 14 days (or whatever turns be) highest antibody response, getting shots *about* good going get, response degrade time. America already seeing clusters these, possible even transmitted hospitals. 

That's collective antibody response

Well, that's vaccine studies are, I'm trying rude. Look SA vaccine trial antibody response compared Israel. 8x compared 6x compared less than, depending vaccine trial. less Americans get vaccinated (in context) ? RELATIVE RATE. said advantageous? talking about?

In scenario, vaccine efficacy rate lower expected **AND** falling fairly rapid clip, absolute worst, NIGHTMARE scenario becomes two things:

- Americans get less vaccines international counterparts

AND

- Americans lose even social trust institutions believed vaccines would make loved ones effectively immune

These things coming together walking chucklefuck alley underoos on.

The lower vaccine efficacy, need 100% population taking it, willing take boosters, cynical results.

The worse vaccine does, need policies place, better everyone vaccinated. likely say much.

stocks shorting stuff like ensue delivery carriers.

carriers business means deliveries happen. know hospitalization rate non-vacinated individuals? **According new study, antibodies induced COVID-19 vaccines less effective neutralising new circulating variants novel coronavirus, ones reported UK, Brazil South Africa.**

**The study published journal Cell noted neutralising antibodies induced Pfizer Moderna COVID 19 vaccines less effective coronavirus variants first found South Africa Brazil.** Yep first read it.

Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* hope someone clarify then. Cuz I'm certain problem certainly would clearly stated so. often know. pointed higher. case 3 vs 0. suspect know yet vaers db people dying mycocardial infractions. It’s probably cus they’ve locked long feel sense release. Everyone hospitalized one dose vaccine. 100% effective far... doses Thing is, Trump spent zero political capital OWS. would happened matter president. yeah, go trump parade, really nothing it. Money authorized Congress, signed. interdepartmental coordination done bureaucrats . say it? mean never move on? Absolutely. know 2 people personally told outright want keep wearing masks forever. It’s sad honestly. take anything. waste time   Texas one coworkers upset company still required masks even though governor dropped mask mandate. He’s vaccinated newborn, people idiots. Oh no, course. summer certainly safe so. people saying “we live lives” since covid started, attitude part put us bad state. Deciding live “with” deadly virus instead take necessary measures combat it.
Lucky us, vaccines made insane pace, safely start live lives again. deciding whatever want face catastrophic pandemic it’s legitimately safe selfish harmful. It’s asking almost much.

Historically speaking, can't agree. one mildest global traumas generation face. 

I've watching lot historian reaction videos youtube quarantine, say, feel like soft marshmallow compared brutality past centuries. reputable source increase effectiveness time Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine? 

What vaccines? I'm interested Pfizer / BioNTech. I've done quick Googling, articles appear different times past weeks, worse, usually narrative text various orders various figures time frames.

Is anything table? example, rows days vaccination columns levels problem, maybe separate tables depending various factors? Fact is, fertility impacted contact COVID. aren’t double blind trials suggest that, even anecdotally lot women distrusted menses cycles due COVID. based alone I’d think vaccination safer bet.

Also due first principles vaccination medicine, there’s nothing, absolutely nothing, suggest mRNA vaccination affect fertility. Yea average American moron. look sub full low IQ mouthbreathers. Look story Boise housing market.

Its Californians, someone lived Denver lives SF, Californians ones always take blame. Well, every day surge come, 2 million people get vaccinated Lol, say it... I’m confused need government tell allowed allowed do. go it. making up? think people dying think variants going increase infections like Italy, France Germany? it’s JJ, 2nd dose usually worse Almost half total vaccinations Moderna using Johnson Johnson shot. early days JJ shot, already used 1.2 million them.

We even begun using Astrazenca shots.

Your comment makes sense. 😂😂😂 that’s scientist call ”an insignificant personal anecdote”. LITERALLY 1-2 months away widely available vaccines, year can't wait another two months highest possible chance avoid problems?

The problem people like Fauci Biden keep saying ""maybe couple people get together summer"" ""maybe we'll get back normal sometime next year."" Meanwhile, CDC's saying ""vaccinated people definitely fly see relatives out-of-state.""

Seeing this, can't help doubting we'll really open month two.

If government wants take course, trumpet far wide. Put stuff line know empty promises they'll go back blithely ""two weeks."" Pre-plan massive Memorial Day parties. Promise resign there's single restriction still effect Fourth July. we'll know mean two months last two months. never said anything justify position, anyone downvoting provide objective justification disagreeing me. ""you're wrong."" Really appears people believe negative rights view opinions facts regard. meantime four times UK data stated. lack appointments elderly system state set rather problem personally creating. refusing vaccine could mean state see slackening demand current eligibility tiers move another eligibility group (or adults) earlier. Get soon able get general population gets order reduce spreading group setting impossible socially distance none kids get vaccinated. girlfriend's grandma get vaccine point too. agreed natural infection guarantee someone would fight infection future easily, said applies vaccines. Vaccines definitely superior sense, I've explained. Immunity last longer vaccination getting naturally infected. really feel like digging publications. 

Well, 10 second googling **It true natural infection almost always causes better immunity vaccines** Whereas immunity disease often follows single natural infection, immunity vaccines usually occurs several doses. However, difference vaccination natural infection price paid immunity [ I.e get sick natural way] 

source: could still room reduction shedding onward transmission. Yeah, 94% 100% that's tall order vaccine. 

No, 94% refers symptomatic disease (and addition fair suspected cases included) terms reduction asymptomatic reductiom viral load, room improvement much higher 6%. really vague, summary qualified person.

It's vague in, asked could link source proves longevity/strenght vaccine induced infection better/longer lasting natural infection article simply makes guess ends 'probably' without actually tested politics money obviously  ECMO isn’t basically life support - it’s literally extreme form life support It’s number cases, obviously millions blood clotting cases Europe every year. Norway Denmark seeing combination symptoms highly unusual can’t explained looking blood clotting. well cases nothing vaccination, typical blood clotting cases, possibly cases common cause - currently investigated. sounds like he’s sort emotional crisis. somebody says someone else welcome wear mask forever way means implies wants COVID go forever he’s evil grandma killing anti-masker. Maybe short term, scenario keep using AstraZeneca indeed becomes proven small risk might get blood clots. created situation young healthy people take vaccine risk getting blood clot might higher actually exposure covid. 

Convincing new anti-vaxxers vaccine safe close impossible. Even scientific proof batch safe. say: remember safe vaccine March?

The taken precaution seem like attempt ensure many people jump ship become anti-vax. [I got morning Germany. thrombotic events HEB fucking pussies. CVS, Walmart, Walgreens, big stores still requiring customers wear masks. Mask mandates ever applied public places. politics think Paul-Ehrlich-Institute playing? EMA said cause clotting

The EMA [is vaccine. ITT: it’s geopolitical !

I'd get it. EU can't keep GDP Chile? What? Politics =/= Political organization. Think 'office politics'. right, statement much blanket statement time tell happened here. single dumbest person know prison guard MA. glorious failure Poland inept government. many deaths fucking nothing. wish governments would proactively reach get senior citizens vaccinated. vulnerable. expecting compete scheduling vaccination really elder neglect. you’re eligible means state believes there’s significant reason occupation vaccinated. potential spread virus pretty disastrously position, passing children work could pass atrisk elderly people live with. means get vaccinated. someone like girlfriends grandmother, almost cases elderly point, itll matter days secure appointment. you’re crazy, yes, get vaccinated. want sensitive take time get girlfriends grandmother appointment, likely better computers. That’s exactly said, absolutely idea you’re claiming I’m fool here. fact see certain states open certain ones lock scenario play out, whole country lock again. never really first place tbh. July 4th celebrations going massive year. scheduled COVID shot appointment next week! happy relieved actually brought tears eyes. I'm ""only"" 37, immunosuppresents medical condition state opened eligibility us. like idea forcing unvaccinated, ignorant people onto others literally cannot avoid them. Probably article focuses patients. Similar cases reported patients least three four cities across country. Additionally, one hospital contains national center haematology, people usually admitted across country condition warrants specialized attention, patients may various places even they’re hospital. turn, take it. get make rules, obligation follow them. Soon US we’ll point everyone offered vaccine. point could careless rando anti-vaxer gets Covid spreads his/her family. Slow vaccination program concerns safety citizens = good; Slow vaccination program incompetent procurement contracting = bad. English miles better German anyway wrong thinking approach properly? Vaccine priority given people actually constant move, getting together groups, people working....those people would spread most, elderly, even go out. wrong? surprisingly new “variants” started showing right started vaccinating people. trying scare people getting vaccines quick possible    prevention measures input hospitalizations/death measurable output

That’s really works. 

It doesn’t scale.

Huge chunks pandemic (at several different levels review) critical masses/tipping points. (This true viral loads relate likelihood infection. It’s outbreaks work. It’s herd immunity phenomenon.) wrong Usually I'd say nonsense conspiracy theory shit past moves comments EU countries AZ make wonder whether political move. still remember accused UK rushing approval process December pfizer went they're much thorough rush approve quietly moved approval timeline US/Canada also approved pfizer days later. Since I'm actually German, might case, lol. mixed German word, ""suspendieren"" Come home!!!!!! think caught conspiracy peddled urologist writes Newsmax investigated Medicare fraud:  Making fun asinine overused memes reddit beats bloody pulp = asshole, k 17 million people. literally know anything person insanely rude. Among Us 😳😳😳😳 get one Iowa literally reason. basically open everyone appears least one case Germany. one read far.

(In German) woman treated blood clots bleeding mouth legs nine days receiving AZ vaccination.

They say anything specific batches though.

While unfortunate, understand reaction. lot people already scared vaccinations cases remain ignored anti-vaxxers gain steam. You’re listing far-right/ right wing leaders. That’s authoritarian means. Maybe google definition all. Paul-Ehrlich-institute makes guidance political organization. No, bloody reaction. last lockdown mean.
My memory timeline hazy, know shitload restrictions anywhere else. logical brain understands whole ‘greater good’ past twelve months caught hit mental health six. going sub months. ""weird"" people apparently support masks want hide behind them. introverts never want lockdown end. fucking tiring. place went golden repository breaking info non stop shaming people want get sick. believe 30% country estimated virus. event, vaccinations targeted vulnerable, current rates decline, we're set see lowest hospitalizations country since last April end week.

I agree lot unknowns medium long term, short term, we're currently winning fight. Call local pharmacies grocery stores I’d distributing there. Ask unused vaccines 5:00 clock! really hurts virtue signaling. think need Google word ""suspend."" Norwegian media reporting symptoms patients least three four cities far away other. sure big one batch is, would assume cases multiple places lowers chance it’s one batch(?) People suspicious time. like ""no thanks"" missed stuff says that!

Surely need weighing everything though. many *may* impacted rare side effect compared many die delay vaccination. That’s understand delays Norway, Ireland etc. Covid rare there. However, Germany?

Sure older people may need more, fault I'm eligible take want go get signed up? acting crazy here? anything think better approach would suspend particular batch AZ rather vaccine itself. anything still big if, problem would probably b3 confined quality control issue like certain batch rather vaccine  “The compelling one compulsory, indicates authorities think useful.”

But made compulsory (which wouldn’t, reasons others already described) bet ass people would’ve rioted. imagine they’d want avoid that. Thank you. estate tax impacts top fraction 1% - probably top 0.5% people die, children still inherit millions, potentially billions, please. data actually shows AZ vaccine marginally safer. effectively same. race virus, four months eternity, epidemiologically speaking. Unfortunately, term, lots factors *could* work together outpace success vaccination front.

As right now, 15% population fully vaccinated. additional 6% received least first dose. That's 20% population *plus* previously infected recovered (and know overlap) level protection, rest don't. Let's conservatively put number non-protected 70% population. THEN, factor number people fully vaccinated, nonetheless become infected symptomatic enough get tested test positive.

That's population potential hosts virus *right now*: 70+% U.S. population. 

And news vaccination successes spreads eligibility expands, creates gap people *act* everybody vaccinated actual work getting shots arms still done.

Combine people seeing falling number cases January peaks good weather pulling people homes community settings, governments (particularly state &amp; local) sending signals ""it's over"", larger larger share 70+% population inevitably going engage activities contribute transmission.

We see TSA airline travel, daily travelers approaching 1.5 million per day figure: still well normal (2019) numbers, much higher typical numbers 2020. see restaurant bookings retail foot traffic rebound.

This wonderful course, LONG actual work vaccination - instead good news - outpaces increase transmissible activity resumption. not, hard envision final surge. Though course, final surge happen, *should* less devastating vulnerable - still potential unleash lot unnecessary human suffering. led believe variants COVID mutated kind unstoppable monster hell-bent killing spring breakers… Maybe Jason Voorhees. always get COVID mixed up. probably calibrating expectations based people upvote Reddit. case, they're lying...most real world studies shown ~0% hospitalization...seems vaccine good, here's optimistic:

1 year pandemic veered control, first attempt developing vaccine yielded pretty phenomenal outcome: country bit less half people fully-vaccinated, 92% hospitalized received vaccine. pharma companies call quits now, would decent success, reason optimism they're still developing better vaccines (and ramping production capacity). say one optimistic (and probably forming decision optimistic rather taking Reddit upvotes face value). mostly political real shame EU playing people's lives like this. AZ vaccine safe others. Indeed am. can't justify 3 week quarantine, home hotel! realistic fly HK vaccination. 

UK going good rate, officially everyone offered first jab 31st July now. redditors calculated current rate, offer first jab everyone 18+ end June. far.  dog fight, quick google shows texas tests roughly 1/3 per capita new jersey i'd imagine contributes last somewhat i'd bet weather plays role weather enforced lockdown probably helped lot weeks ago.

i guess we'll find weeks trend continues they..want medal? even 1 shot concerning, especially may need urgent emergency care vaccines. it’s nowhere near endgame EU brain damaged said hunch. actually done science. percentage people getting blood clots AZ vaccine Pfizer vaccine. vaccine. next door Brazil Chile like saying Montana neighboring state live northeast say let's try stick data become complotists. people who’ve vaccine clots too, higher incidence who’ve vaccine. I’d understand precautions normal medicine rollout, aren’t normal times, we’re global pandemic, right Germany one worst effected countries Yh UK data think like 2 cases pfizer vaccine compared AZ. UK clearly safe. makes wonder big related vaccine probably issue particular batch rather vaccine itself. IIRC Italy another European country suspend certain batch AZ vaccine rather AZ itself. try, lot hardcore anti-vaxxers family ""did research""

Very hard help brainwashed individuals Oh boy. Talk goal post shifting. one said 100 percent. one thinks that's realistic. want admit clearly right. simply stating every medical expert world is. want team pillow guy. OK. I'd rather follow actual experts saying. I'd rather look numbers, say ""yeah. need careful. We're woods yet"" like thoughtful, intelligent person. Absolutely! need know this. last understanding Biontech holds rights together US giant Pfizer. Also Biomtech company working vaccine. Also none countries resources fight legal litigations companies held international courts. Another aspect Germany currently speaking favor releasing patent would expect first one enforce patent. Maybe mean person's demeanor? people obnoxious visible, evident minute two. soon begin speak. school this, British International School Stockholm, broke law sent kid home.

Americans likely dumbest western nations. inconvenient it, they'll literally pretend exist. ignore science, bothersome. That's week, total. actually 5 million now, month! wait ant free ? Everyone wants things return normal. However, lot people afraid things get worse people let guard pandemic contained. I've gotten first jab getting second soon. counting days daydreaming constantly able get together friends close indoors next month. also recognize lot people Bay Area able get appointments vaccines, watching hoping things get worse get chance experience hope. get it. fatality rate already lower point. 70% Americans age 75 received first shot. it’s 50% 65-64 crowd. top virus minds covid 19 attack HQ recouping planning next viral assault. AZ doses bought paid U.S. government, matter AZ non-U.S. company not. rightfully _our_ vaccines since placed order company last year. Anything whether U.S. would approve vaccine circumstantial incredibly jumpy think Biden actually approve them. take kind arguments whether true answer _everything_. Like said, takes time patience, come weeks whether FDA would authorize AZ borderline immoral block private company selling life-saving product customers lock away warehouses slowly expires.

The U.S. blocking AZ selling anything, quit making things up. issue AZ ask U.S. led American-owned vaccines nations, happen. doses speaking paid owned nations, they're _American-owned_. America's fault nations' priorities got screwed terms managing vaccine supply line, America still facing 5,000 cases 9/11 every single day.

However it’s highly unlikely you’ll need ventilator die Covid fully vaccinated. Honestly get bad head cold others around they’re fully vaccinated that’s fine. Annoying, terrifying. Every Western country ordered. Canada ordered per capita, effect.

Conclusion report:

Conclusion: combination mass vaccination infection prevention measures recipe global health disaster. Following science, one conclude age groups (possibly exception small children) heavily affected subject rates morbidity mortality raise much faster much higher expected occur natural course CoV pandemic. particularly apply sequence mass vaccinations following first infectious wave parallels natural infection (i.e., immunocompromised people elderly first, followed younger age groups). one, matter, granted right implement large-scale pharmaceutic non-pharmaceutic immune interventions, especially viral pandemic, certainly without in-depth understanding immune pathogenesis viral pandemic. one follows science, nothing science, becomes extremely difficult label ongoing mass vaccination campaigns crime, public health also individual health. 

To substantiate reasoning above, manuscript first explain components innate immune system protect Covid-19 render infections asymptomatic. go explain detail how, immunologically Covid-19-naïve population, selective (i.e., adaptive) immune escape shifts first wave disease death elderly (and immunocompromised) subjects outset pandemic got away asymptomatic infection (i.e., younger middle-aged population segment). Similarly, explained accelerated viral immune escape asymptomatically infected population finally shifts back burst morbidity mortality elderly, population eventually controls pandemic controlling viral immune escape. already illustrate critical importance desiccating changing contribution innate adaptive immunity population’s overall immune defense viral pandemic.

A subreddit likely filled hypochondriacs definitely taken scientific proof!!! currently using Pfizer AZ, total doses 50/50. Moderna coming April, maybe J+J spring too. Give chinese one please Yeah shit, take medical degree say this. can't believe seem bother anyone guy making shit year sure existence racism among part population would reahape entire general western sentiment towards Asian countries.

Also, even racism exclude acknowledgement Asian culture harder working higher functioning. lot racists way legitimately scared high functioning Asians whole. zero last sunday due delay shared link That’s happened me. Little congestion nothing else. Chest X-ray ekg came back clean fortunately Son got 1st Pfizer shot tested positive 10 days later. Dec 26. Went get second dose Jan 8. Smell returned date taste 60% smell screws it. love it! 2.4m/day, US 16-17m admin per week, ya'll 1/5th size, 5 would equivalent 25m/week here. Good luck! want visit England Thanks clarification! died allergic reaction. Got epi fine. *...If...*

You always say anything couch statement appropriately. matter least 45 times better getting vaccine virus.

But that's really question anymore, multiple vaccine now.

So AZ vs Moderna VS PfizerBiontech VS J&amp;J

If AZ would actually kills 1 4.5 million others don't, using AZ anymore concentrating others seams reasonable long students get half (or less) tuition since getting distinctly lesser experience anticipated seems fair. 

Its actually kinda nice university encourage students go somewhere else better accommodations early. Little time make plans. Even can’t open up, best idea disregard actual common sense detrimental stuff gets better? We're really kicking overdrive now. 32 doses/100 people, USA far behind UK's 38.  27% adults gotten least one shot, states far (New Mexico 37.2%!!)  Cases still dropping despite UK variant states opening up. Hospitalizations 40k. Deaths mid 1000s. 1.5 months open season, soon start sharing Canadabros Mexicobros administers record 4.6 million vaccines doses one day, 105.7 million doses total

The title article appears contain misinformation: ""...4.6 million doses one day..."" article body mention anything number doses one day.

As March 15, 3:00 EST, none ""Trends Number COVID-19 Vaccinations US"" CDC site corresponds ""4.6 million doses one day"" misinformation appears article title. literally CPAC. They're going away! They're becoming LIBRUL!!!!  ^^^^/^^^^s ok sure full quarantine saying living life like year “not hard” ridiculous countries ECMO machines used dire circumstances even patient single dose vaccine needing ECMO commitment cause admirable. It’s funny incentive ‘the pub’ person! UK manage problem? single experience magically dictate happens anyone else. There's data suggest vaccine helps prevent infection transmission though exactly conclusive. least enough CDC. official recommendation still distance anyone vaccinated, least now. always meet smaller gatherings keep distance.  Since vaccines tested since summer 2020, information durability protection. Data phase 1 trial Moderna vaccine suggested neutralizing antibodies persisted nearly 4 months, titers declining slightly time. Given absence information long vaccines protective, currently specific recommendation booster doses. However, companies developing vaccines could administered boosters, also coverage emerging variants SARS-CoV-2 less susceptible vaccine inhibition. (Last reviewed/updated 24 Feb Specifically, right recommended people wait new changed vaccine hope effective emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, though Pfizer Moderna developing modifications existing vaccines designed specifically broader activity emerging strains. (Last reviewed/updated 5 Mar annoying because, given really indication plans make sense, announcing now? ""up us"" regardless cases - restrictions can't kept place majority population opposed Drunk driving illegal yet 10,000 people still died 2019 it. Clearly current measures aren’t enough. suggest solve issue? Banning cars would help. Don’t Obesity isnt contagious...

That doesn’t matter. We’re talking deaths, contagion. Speaking which, 300k people US die every year obesity. What’s solution epidemic? know sure, transmission probably reduced quite bit. I'd whatever feel comfortable with. Lol yeah Utah (1.6 million first doses + 8 weeks) legislature basically told governor F masks end April 10. keep hearing cities counties cannot make mask mandates here, expect businesses own. think places probably start drop May June guess. 

Honestly, governor's original plan probably slow. think cases continue drop even April 10.  Even due vaccine, still orders magnitude safer virus. know realize talking to. post history shows need go back /pol/. Thank god world going away thinking. hope force every vaccine possible point. Anecdotally, jiving we're seeing employees contractors work got sick. really want get covid. effects I've heard range fatigue (the common) neurological disorders. Yes. I’m hematologist top head see DIC, TTP, ITP, antiphospholipid syndrome. one likely association prior vaccination ITP.   yes got pfizer. rare. something fringes going on, fact, India getting vaccine, people thrombocytopenia told proceed caution. least here, EU pull finger fucked. Thank fuck. First thing I’m gonna shit go local get fucking hammered. it’s theater. There’s lot political pressure re-open schools right now, that’s hard 6-foot social distancing. they’re going Fauci say “the science” shows 3-foot social distancing safe.

Whether think it’s time reduce restrictions time shut things (or something between), admit propaganda. anyone really thought people going stay home till everyone vaccinated?

This normal yes people tired pandemic. pick large set people though look weird patterns find some. Thats people cautious doesnt mean link even likely one.

Thats true whether blood clots baldness. Keep watching story develop youll see soon enough. Im planning get vaccine next week...just wondering, able transmit virus non vaccinated people? family members vaccine yet, social distance them? fucking moron.

After 2nd shot, I'm going regardless, going bit weird first. That's all. Given immune response vaccine, many years, possibly life long. That’s conspiratorial thinking. Maybe government restrictions private businesses don’t matter much individuals going do, that’s reason CA FL COVID outcomes despite vastly different government approaches.

We’re still Westerners, regardless state, Westerners don’t like placed house arrest year without due process. think that’s better explanation relative uniformity outcomes across Western world conspiracies involving number cooking hidden death totals. That’s state. Louisiana governor announced eligibility expanded qualified signed Walmart.com got first shot next day 15 minute wait second scheduled month later. it’s “in US....” Sweden baffling public health decisions last year. 

always delivers.  It’s weird watch tables turned like that. dont know anything blood clots

I’d like learn whether experts think observed blood clots/low platelets statistically abnormal (or not!). doesn’t seem like views topic really relevant here. tldr: nah nah nah nah great can't one nah nah nah nah Israel tiny population... Yeah, bit worried i'm brazilian things ugly here. He'll pigs fly. Norway extremely wealthy country. There’s reason couldn’t manufacture vaccine. Shit man, I'd take pooled dose point. reports people got Covid 19 well got vaccine? wonder symptoms experienced. course, go hospital, wonder bad symptoms got unlucky vaccine much effect on. That's amazing! theory agree you, ""stay home, stay safe"" people way year us losing patience. would really like year belong people willing live reasonable level risk. everyone Covid. Well said. vaccines safe, it’s weird many people seem want fail here. EU literally seized vaccines meant Australia lmao agree although someone graduated college understand frustration end. mandate something semester 5+ months line fluid situation? thought another mind-numbing semester probably getting them

I think end though definitely right, vaccination numbers speak schools fully normal august. take genius look current rolling 7 day average along # already vaccinated conclude policy made person school fall right literally posturing change administrators realize reason Good points 

I wonder things would spread surfaces.

Wonder bad would gotten rollout state frustrates me. 1 underlying conditions still can't get shot begining next month. Mind sharing link that? 12+ months studying tracing, found infinitesimal number people actually contracted virus outdoors. Like literally 40 cases whole planet they’ve people close outdoors contact. Outdoors activity one respites cursed year. Scolding people going beach one best ways get general public give safety measures altogether. Case point. Hear one thing like disagree run actual topic. 


Of course fake news gets left way prevalent right. Anyway... saying scientists ""king journalists"" somehow massive conspiracy? Would love hear works fucking moron Yes, death negative outcome. Also, allowing uncontrolled spread could lead variant sets us back square one. Case numbers important metric.

Vaccination rates lead lower case numbers anyway... not, bigger problem. J&amp;J good reputation industry. say something, there's good bet they'll it.

It'll get better soon. Honestly biggest hope companies start producing J&amp;J product license killer product. always true. you’re admitted hospital, added risk catching something even Covid-19. It’s unfortunate circumstance. guys remember this? still wear mask I’m vaccinated? it’s killing people actual virus did. Here’s numbers dumb fuck. 13 people blood clots UK AZ, 15 Pfizer. Get right ye. got mine Friday think flu shot worse. itched weeks. think mostly reaction bandaid. proud EU seizing vaccines meant Australia. lot people risk- generally lower risk- like they’re super elderly nursing home bound. anyone 60 that- good Pfizer Moderna. probably lowers odds spreading even get sick- it’s harder get less sick person. People getting fed prolonged lockdowns. Unfortunately see &amp; protests around world unless governments get sh*t together Morons Masks college sound like much problem me. Things get dicier though housing question. production comes online, probably safe bet stop whole world gets vaccinated.

These plants going running balls wall criss passes. going get better every passing month. say compromise, I'm that. think cautious still start going back, still mask least bit more. caused big rift people think free-for-all things opening again, especially Texas. I'm side - OK, lot vulnerable vaccinated there's probably going uncomfortable window time people start interacting regardless agree it. step caution think soon point everyone vaccines. think responsibility us wear masks people like newborns CAN'T vaccinate mask numbers drop significantly. also understand cannot mask forever ever. matter middle ground transition... gonna ugly. :( really wish best. I'm hopeful looking numbers saying vaccines working. Maybe it'll little bit longer. ever get 0 feet? - Fauci's Paradox  expected cases drop rapidly Israel have. True, falling, rate decline seems steeper countries vast majority still unvaccinated. UK, believe MHRA individually approve batch sent out, case EMA.

[Are approval, **each batch** COVID-19 vaccine approved via EMA tested:  vaccines used immunisation programmes  done official medicines control laboratory virus doesn’t spread easily outdoors, they’ve found takes roughly 15 minutes contact Covid-19 positive person contract virus. risk catching Covid walking person outside low. people around masked, fine Trump started Operation Warp Speed. Imagine going bar trying flirt girl staying six feet away fucking mask on. fun never hugging friends. cardiologist told one hotdog year baseball game. Doctors parents sometimes. use need higher efficacy overcome antivaxxers. send North American allies help need help most. Hypothetically, vaccine would protect you. need time pass receiving body 'get trained', getting infected vaccination site would effectively getting infected scenario. Theres way. fucking flaws BS. COVID borderline hypochondriac. Except completely unnatural normal slightest, guys seem complacent masking well I'm surprised. bet looking forward blood test get disney land. true, hard situation. need keep people moving fast possible minimal turn around time.

And generally good job sanitizing everything, problem super pathogens easier create situations. Even went scorched earth style cleaning, something would eventually evolve could survive it.

Best luck you. throughout air pulled vents, mixed outside air, run HEPA filter, redistributed. air fully cycled clean air approximately every 2-3 minutes. also don’t want give anti-vaxxers new ammunition. 

Same here, still want investigate properly.
Anti-vaxxers bit dumb partially care say anyway cant tell trying overly dramatic mock people serious. either way, one expects 0 deaths. isnt possible illness. still around 100 people year die chicken pox. Even 100% effective vaccine (no thing) still always people dont get thr vaccine whatever reason, arent fully vaccinated time get infected (like article) etc. 

No scientist government official would ever demand 100% compliance effectiveness vaccine. Pi Imagine sort person think somewhere ""deserves"" pandemic circumstance. Wtf tendie. I'm american, working, got vaxxed. Can't wait till everyone choose get vaxxed sit back watch people chose pretend virus real amusement. don’t think we’ve seen daily result low since September get it. I've seen same. Close friends family, opening soon going solve that, lead another lockdown. Look Israel great example. able vaccinate large portion population opening up. Let's see stand month way people vaccinated. Maybe need guess right. pandemic taken toll me. don’t think anyone expects 100%, also didn’t mention timelines illness course vs vaccination. Latest research saw pre-print showed best response ~14 days dose two, almost effect dose two day 7. Covid kook I'll buy beer either way gotta promise relax bit dude. Incidence young stroke varies 5 15 per 100 000 person-years many European studies. Stroke young incidences exceedingly rare. unfortunate coincidence occurred taking AZ vaccine. yay China took aggressive measures combat covid, uncomfortable reality worked.

Personally like losing time work. also like working sick job half physical labor need good health.

Also smile can't see around eyes fake smile. always still see real got first Pfizer dose today (yay!) I’m little worried went local pharmacy get little crowded. know i’m paranoid anyone know happens hypothetically contract covid around time receive vaccine? idea. like optimistic. Dr. Gregory Michael FL one first die thrombocytopenia shortly vaccination.  expert field Michael Dr. Jerry Spivak, professor medicine Hematology Division Johns Hopkins University School Medicine Maryland said:

“However, based rapid onset, severity, similar time course thrombocytopenia several patients within period, exposed vaccine men… association [with vaccine] considered real, opposed coincidental. Vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia recognized rare event, one die it. Dismissing event coincidental merely possible injustice Dr. Michael, scientific inquiry, harm others may experience adverse event. So, yes, proven otherwise, consider COVID-19 linked event,” said Spivak.

America bad place ago point seemed one continuous wave, things finally starting look here, see EU facing....my heart goes all. Shopping way different gym. one sweating mask taking eat store (or least shouldn’t). Gyms restaurants almost make mask removal necessary, latter literally does. gyms safer others, probably, things linked massive spread. seems pretty clear stuff often done safely nature make safe. can't say issues unrelated know, considered weird rare young people coming brain blood clots low blood palatels. Thats stopped AZ vaccination, investigate it. 

As simple that. Nobody saying vaccine cause know yet. concerned might that's want check.

I'd swear good nationalism making people think jus plot country.
People get mad medical officials wanting make sure vaccine safe initially thought! 

If put vaccine hold later gets proven vaccine part cause impossible get people trust vaccines... Therefore, think something investigated, rather get hundreds affected issue. welded people inside apartments. normally care much China inside country, blatant PRC simping.

You can't trap people apartment welding doors. things called windows. Yeah, insanely disproportionate number cases deaths America Trump office seems say opposite. downplayed lied entire time office. lies grandparents believe needed isolate. covid. tell nothing who's office. Also, Trump plan give states vaccines say ""YOU GOT HERE!!!!"" 


Some states robust public health planning execution, don't. even best state can't even hope come close economy-of-scale massive capabilities full weight Federal government bear.

I think Covid related deaths bound keep happening society happy reduce similar thing normal flu normal flu death rates Pfizer exported EU maybe 20somethings could cool heels literally month half vaccine widely available. like mirage, big wave always two weeks away... probably would continue cluster fuck before, especially since wouldn’t mattered anymore election.

Wow. seem really worked up. know it’s tough covid ending. it’s going alright. many things optimistic right know everyone super positive concerned. However,I think bit much say take precautions protect kids vaccinated. Recent research (not sensationalized news sources) starting show post-viral syndrome common covid viruses, severity initial infection predict long covid long covid happens kids too. Many parents okay taking risks similar see colds flu vaccine possibly way kids worth cautious longer avoid potential long term effects. need information long post-viral syndrome covid lasts kids, prevalent different age groups quality life impacts be.

Id say pointless considering vaccine immunization.  point know long vaccine last. mention people vaccine still carry pass without knowing. really make sense Irrelevant. oof, buddy... Spring breakers hooking sharing cabs beds = bad. average person looking get away cursed year covid taking basic precautions enjoy beach = fine. 

Remember media uproar last spring giant party Ozarks? One single case traced back it. Ongoing socializing indoors without masks leads easy transmission. outside within earshot someone else safe essential activity anyone participates in. Nice. able get like 40-50 appointments people it’s always great feeling. 16+ vaccinated May US. Google "" J&amp;J vaccine chart looks like dick "". Seriously. look FDA submission, there.

But either way cant directly compare Moderna Pfizer, trial populations different, especially due variants. That’s read?

The pandemic going cause reduced economic growth anyways, people naturally started staying home cases got bad.

The 13,000 deaths still happened significant, tens thousands stake, possibly 100k given US numbers.

So no, one person, tens thousands, life ruined wear mask raging parties? 

If you’re fragile there’s helping you. None little details importance, sheesh 🧐🤣 math 100 days less every adult wants vaccine it. 

4 million shots day great place be. Damn that’s huge variance. bad didn’t realize 17-18 high You’re right. won’t anti-maskers shown narcissistic sociopathy. course won’t care effects them. brain can’t work way. mean, you’re getting source information, spreading like gospel, one source, that’s you. quick google search shows info nurse inaccurate. reason concerning getting worse. not. cases really big deal, especially fewer fewer people dying.

Otoh, lack activity variety people allowed NNN &amp; LS regulars dominate threads since still fired push divisive comments. ... things closed capacity restrictions exactly hard see would less activity would however expect see otherwise healthy people either group. combination clotting low platelets normally associated serious underlying problem. acutely botched surgery, severe trauma sepsis.

What's done done. Good luck, Miami.

I'm saying things moving along slower should. Sure though, go off.  Sure, know social isolation lack school kids. also covid doesn’t really spread much schools, seems poor decision kept closed he's willing say Fox press conference say press release willing say Twitter banned, makes think would willing say Twitter now?

If wanted say it, could call press conference tomorrow every major network would show up. got first Pfizer shot Friday. Saturday, arm sore, became fatigued, 100.9 degree temp 45 minutes. took fever reducer went away. Sunday, pain injection site gone felt like someone jamming thumb armpit. Pfizer warp speed vaccine. 

And competent President would used WPA order MRNA-capable manufacturers produce Pfizer vaccine started showing stage 2 efficacy. competent president would hundreds millions Pfizer doses staged vaccine sites ready jab moment FDA approved it, ending Biden took office. vaccinated becomes something like 99.9%. Definitely--weak chins, bad teeth, acne, patchy beards 

Forever lockdowners--""I scared leave apartment gamed day *before* COVID like people living normally."" *cries kangaroo* wife officially retired making vaccination appointments consider work finished. started effort get parents grandparents vaccinated mid-January snowballed 330 vaccination appointments made need eligible. 

It like second full time job us (on top 2 young kids well) relieved say “mission accomplished” kneejerk defenses ""this cannot possibly us"" serious consequences *is* contamination issue. 11-12 shows 12k deaths, 33 day. Obviously numbers vary year year. got AutoModed string used. somehow massive conspiracy? Would love hear works fucking moron

I never said anything like that. even remotely close. point talking you. course Florida going top 4 raw death count 5th largest state 7 million fewer people 4th largest state almost 10 million less Florida. 

The difference death rates Florida NC/VA mostly due Florida people 65. 30% people 65 34% higher deaths per 100,000. Honestly far quality life goes, every year gotten better exclude fact really allowed socialize normally. able pimp home ""office,"" shall say, year.

If save much money vacationing hanging out, never would able to. Although, I'm ready get back living. Material goods take far. Instead...we got stable genius threw hissy fit anytime someone got recognition. fair, Texas didn’t time prep centralized system. virus hit, almost overnight, vaccine ready distribution. upwards year prep, I’m sure state government would created safe, effective efficient system vaccine registration. biggest concern point really children. aren’t eligible vaccine may mild symptoms cases, still learning could long term effects. Chicken pox annoyance, shingles nightmare. welcome wear one forever. Nobody going stop you. 17-18 flu season shows around 61k deaths. roughly 170 day

Personally could see Covid going lower. Way people gonna get vaccination get flu vaccine say every government everywhere. many governments never appoint right people positions. Tanzania's health minister currently mask vaccine-denying. country health Minister approved use deficient face mask produced buddy's company. pandemic conceived scam make money? no, that's ridiculous. people gonna anyway? fuck yeah fiancée 1a(healthcare worker) got vaccine Jan. I’m 1b got first dose two weeks ago. Also TX. Increased availability day. figure Reddit, get dose, pretending it’s 1a god damn lie. you’d ok ruining 40 million people’s lives year save 1 person? mention, feds best public health minds gov't. sure amazing people various states, dream type role CDC NIH. opening soon going solve that, lead another lockdown.

no won't. there's enough immunity now, vaccinations happening fast enough, even everyone went fully back normal, would significant difference outcomes. Naw, blame US UK. Deflection works. whaever do, never take responsibility. It’s politicians ages. 

Meanwhile, VDL cronies reap rewards. USA UK shipping enough vaccines, would gladly buy them. J&amp;J got approved, first doses arriving May, think. overrun hospitals severe problem causes deaths. \*Cries Brazilian Portuguese\* Well. It’s known manufacturing making proven drugs China.

The Chinese vaccine pushed even finished trials. Chinese importing western vaccines export Chinese vaccine, that’s need know. Yes works. vaccine works 100%. Boutros Boutros Boutros Boutros... Boutros Ghali 
Something want say that? every adult vaccinated, 90%+ drop cases deaths drop 95%+ regardless whether people follow covid guidelines. really us. That's point vaccine.  except fact Trump particular job right, would mountains vaccine production now.

pfizer didnt take ows money. say 109% protection severe infection? thought 91%or 95%? person obsession problem. citizen Canada also leave Canada quarantine tell you’re leaving. also stay mom problem depending old (if she’s 65 older need consent border agent approve it) drive around lot work (from far south Olympia far north Marysville everywhere between) see good portion people still wearing masks. know it’s everyone everywhere, it’s reassuring seeing sheer amount people surprising areas actually still wearing them. 

I’m hopeful summer. Best movie speech ever.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Maybe antivaxxers finally shut hell up? Ignore I’m drunk  lockdowns? difference Liberal guidelines Conservative guidelines basically 100% shutdown masks everywhere vs 100% open business mask. yeah, sounds like want FDA rush things instead taking sweet time studying effects vaccine.

No sound like all. suggest try rereading post try use reading comprehension skills learned fifth grade. Anecdotally isn’t case young person know that’s gotten Covid. We’ve little symptoms quick recovery time. probably worst young people know gotten still never bad symptoms. never actually felt sick even. fatigued awhile it’s likely due fact got Covid wasn’t fully recovered mono. federal vaccination program coordinated states?? It’s everyone’s nightmare, American British tourists dominating world. better areas much worse others....sounds like Florida nutshell APS associated Covid-19 though? wouldn’t think so. Haha thanks Florida really phases. 

And medical conditions already allowed. work highly effective likely immediate 50 million vaccine surge. 

The political optics exporting government paid vaccines others Americans want would career ending. Great. lets reopen That’s argument? Obviously go outside you’ll see people aren’t following it. check restaurant ledgers, earnings statements airline companies, hotel tourist bookings you’ll quickly see people following recommendations... Agreed. Masks need permanent. honestly think vaccinated people wear masks, point think safe go back normal? ""Vaccinated people still spread virus"" seems like roundabout way saying, ""You need wear mask socially distance long transmittable diseases exist."" may tell offer drive too!!! right TX may open going places. Hehe. Don’t feel relieved yet, you’ll feel pretty shit tomorrow. would start dosing Tylenol stay ahead it. 

My experience went like this: got shot 3PM, felt perfect 10:30 started noticing aches, 30 mins later 100.2 fever aches bad hurt move. 12:00 fever aches started going down. Went bed 12:30 felt ok bit feverish still. Woke fine, boom, around 11AM hit fever aches chills headache like driving nail top skull, lasted day. Began subside 11PM, woke next day (today) feeling good new. WTF rant suicidal COVID removed trolling?????

Thanks. helps. People downvoting article clearly meant suggest massive portion people get covid going pretty substantial long term effects, even though article doesn’t even say that. One main symptoms looked fatigue, could fact everyone lockdown, article even mentions massive issues individual studies looked at. 

“Due representation hospitalised patients severe COVID-19 reviewed studies, findings considered representative milder symptoms. long-term impact COVID-19 quality life general population remains unclear.” don’t even really conclusively say much sure happens. danger isn’t beach, bbq, ball game... danger go home with. said, it’s still unprofitable try shame people outdoor recreation. California tried shutting playgrounds camping— didn’t better it. pretty crazy things moving slowly compared states. definitely wait long vaccine! really get took long either. Hoping ramp distribution lot next couple weeks, sister get vaccine asap. I've heard Hardin, Orange Jefferson counties vaccinating everyone (if get appointment); y'all able drive one maybe would feel better getting vaccine (since still TX)? Dang thought SC bad. We're phase 2 already people 15 medical conditions put elevated risk able get them. That's...not immune. many people medical reaction vaccination?
Just put question bed. Probably one there's standing bars, places 50% capacity, sporting events, concerts, people scared interact, entire stores closed completely, places closing early. We're still partial lockdown. every part world childish Americans, throw tantrum asked wear thin piece fabric nose, desperate first chance take like they're worst oppression ever. parts world consider big deal helps stop global pandemic. Sweden 70% forest, theres quite lot Swedens area 0 people. exactly happened UK. closed everything schools essential businesses, saw schools basically driving spread. point Boris Johnson shut down. No, Americans selfish, own. cant reconcile level selfishness, that’s fault, don’t stupid assume everyone shitty you. That’s weakest excuse selfish behavior is. 

The level stupid anger possess astounding. man openly admits moving goal posts. 

“ telephone interview next day, Dr. Fauci acknowledged slowly deliberately moving goal posts. so, said, partly based new science, partly gut feeling country finally ready hear really life must extremely lonely masking social distancing anywhere close normal you. mean, teachers, staff, workers vaccinated, contact infestation spores children. hope states businesses reopen stop biggest depression world ever seen. us already bankrupting kids generation stimulus stuff unemployment people even unemployment rate 6%.

I’m California seemed mess first, seems better. Good luck! Lol problem. It’s definitely a...busier...comment I’d intended. anecdotal experience change anything. full lockdown, sure. concerts, sporting events, dance clubs, large parties still limits people like naturally gravitate towards 'smaller' gatherings like eating outside might think things normal, people want enjoy actual fun events crowded bars again, anywhere close normal.

That's problem. age 50, extremely unlikely die covid. reason people might hop anti-vax train need mind take risk thrombosis prevent something wont hurt you.

By stopping early, limit amount people become anti-vaxxers. end easier become anti-vax convincing someone new batches vaccine completely 100% fine trying get anti-vaxxer take vaccine. provide scientific evidence batch 100% safe, anti-vaxxer say, remember batch March? argument never win. lol @ making decisions 5 months unpredictable situation

I'm sure students happy they're one 5% still forced online classes didn’t read article (paywall) assume he’s cautioning due newer variants significant impact kids, vaccines approved kids. vaccinate adults summer cases go nothing shouldn’t necessary.

If enough people get vaccinated keeps burning slow, variants impact kids precautions fall would advised. $.02 Quite. I’ll call poem: Year Hell Yes, always going case. fully vaccinated appears extremely rare. yet 18 make &lt; 0.05% covid deaths.  It’s actually pretty similar. EU distributing member countries. 

How similar? EU country. EU also delivered countries outside EU (like Israel). anyway, EU countries deserve vaccines US say, countries Africa? 

I say that. Deliver Africa, Asia, wherever needed stop selfish nothing stopping individual country developing producing vaccine. 

As matter fact developed produced first Covid vaccine world... depend foreign country something, might happen. 

You also depend vaccines developed foreign countries... Sorry inundated responses, parents received email confirmation followed letter. scheduled first jab Saturday.   👏 typical Friday 14 months ago me:

I got up, went work office saw unmasked faces coworkers, ate lunch them. work swung bar happy hour beer friend. met fiancé packed restaurant dinner either went friends ~20 people would went night club.

Which things west coast Friday? AstraZeneca hardly delivered anything last weeks. Yes might someone get vaccinated 2 weeks later, sure brief closure cause “thousands extra death” vaccination efforts go Pfizer Moderna, vaccination resumes AstraZeneca everything shelf administered time. 👏 Thank Operation Warp Speed! Btw what’s “my agenda?” Human rights? yes case you’re right. Human rights agenda. What’s yours? Trying suppress every instance anything deemed critical Israel’s inhumane policies? That’s true, source we're definitely vaccinating people 30s rn netherlands, large scale anyways. we've got bunch elderly immunocompromised ppl get through. Oh no. 

Anyway. It’s actually pretty similar. EU distributing member countries. US federal government distributing states. anyway, EU countries deserve vaccines US say, countries Africa? human egoistic you’re districting EU?

There nothing stopping individual country developing producing vaccine. depend foreign country something, might happen.  ... everyone wants vaccine gets one. one really cares people selves really *is* personal choice. it. Oh guess sort bad behavior negates Israel’s responsibility? hear wealthy suburb Florida got priority vaccine first came out? nothing new. key figure would like see. fact Netherlands latest country suspend AZ vaccination following Norway, Denmark, Italy, Austria Ireland said ""added information"" would support decision, I'm really wondering know sharing GP yet.

Would countries really suspend AZ vaccination blood clotting occurrences following non vaccinated population? Surely make move.

Something right here. people take risks

This makes sound like risk affects person taking risk.

It objectively selfish irresponsible unduly put risk getting covid putting people risk. don’t think opened middle &amp; high school hybrid idk handling it. speak elementary dumb. hospitalizations plummeting faster cases cases trend downward average age. 

I’m losing sleep bunch 25 year olds get covid. hahaha. know...I know. spoke chicken pox/varicella mentioned names. Maybe know lol.

EDIT:

as chicken pox...honestly, consider big deal. feel getting vaccine every 4 5 years (that's I've heard) troublesome getting kid feeling little itchy. Though, got ""itchy"". ended going hospital big lump neck/behind ears. Swollen Lymph nodes, maybe. takes 2 weeks second shot get full benefit vaccine. You’ll protection though question never vaccine increases amount blood clots population. question vaccine rare side effect dangerous/damaging affected.

That makes sense. question. vaccine rare side effect would show repeatedly given big enough sample size population...and doesn't. general population stop giving vaccine general population? 
 
His response essentially saying ""disprove vaccine caused this! evidence! That's cheating!"" 
 
Very bizarre response. almost like he's looking excuse stop using vaccine. meant like mandates laws. Vaccinated people shouldn’t fly recommendation. Non vaccinated people flying since start pandemic really means nothing.  grandma passed covid January. I'm glad someone office actually working end this. way much needless suffering past year Feels like they're right Nana. hope still waiting tut silently!

France pissed Macron. certain Romania influence vaccine procurement strategies, I'm sure play role pushing certain vaccines others, unlike France. It’s possible, probably unlikely. Flu-like symptoms (aches, fever, fatigue) common side effect day getting vaccine. 

If develop cough, sore throat, shortness breath, loss smell etc., it’s likely flu COVID. vaccine side effects also last much 1-2 days, would start getting suspicious point. Yup. I'll never live something like again. entertain option want, end next time.

If future humanity really looks like rolling waves 2020's greatest hits ad infinitum, frankly dignified alternative.

It way though. Imho vaccine passports overrated anyways. legal problems: Giving special rights vaccinated people people still even allowed get vaccine kind sketchy. Basically makes everybody get vaccinated second class citizen. Primarily younger people one even argue form ageism.

But besides one wonder many restrictions even still place vaccine passports finally ready? use logic friend. worthless here. ""you cant buy vaccines, also cant manufacture ours. Youre gonna wait year vaccinate population first. Get fucked"" Stop advertising citizens return home country? literally official immigration Canada website. literally law.  Yeah 27 states different buying powers competing other, seems like great idea split union. blind hatred towards EU upvoted...

Did read article? sure going here. 17 million people vaccinated AZ-Oxford vaccine. 37 people developed deep vein thrombosis/blood clots. unusual amount people normal circumstances. sounds disproportionate ban suspend vaccinating people due this. world truly gone mad. boat here. 

One shot, 100% protection death. I’ll take 1. spreading absolute BS based little factual data

2. obviously idea manufacturing processes think switched. Especially vaccines referencing highly specialised -80 mRNA vaccines.

Less November, still.  got source that? Good!! prevent massive civil unrest. we’ve though, won’t support government giving away vaccines Americans need them.

People US may understand massive rage year Covid. American political figure agree selling giving away vaccines. Free speech? banned immediately saying taken Donald nut jobs, comment deep within thread, place longer conspiracies fanatical trump bullshit spewed cult followers lmao Well Europeans care. media, won’t receive vaccine soon. 

Americans also care anti-American slant European media threat democracy. leadership can't come sort incentive getting vaccinated, lots people gonna bother. one millions young people decided accept risk COVID, getting vaccine literally zero personal benefit. Wait, die people die time coincidence die adverse reactions vaccine, unfortunate acceptable risk certain point. 

How different saying “this virus 2% death rate, skewed heavily toward elderly and/or unhealthy”? people dying acceptable risk, go entire year lockdown bullshit? something makes vaccine death due adverse reaction less troublesome virus death due adverse reaction? read press release; know says. pre-edited OC wasn’t clear — read like misunderstood purpose perhaps study *instead of* work booster, isn’t reflected press release. 

Thank clarifying.   happening, right now. It’s already California. Let spread mutate little unvaccinated population we’re back last summer. think people running get vaccine overblown manufactured virus real people need help. shoe fits. Modern batch testing EU UK incredibly stringent. cannot see bad batch could possibly introduced supply chain. Especially formula processes almost definitely aligned across manufacturing sites.

I've good quaratiner mask wearer, think I'm spending summer masked inside I'm fully vaccinated, lying yourself. true literally everyone know. correct, BioNT created vaccine; Pfizer partnering marketing distribution. article specifically talking US.

It’s unbearable stretch, definitely feeling tired last days normal. Thanks! whether people took unprecedented measures seriously causes quibble. Unprecedented measures taken curb spread

It’s funny thing English language allows make act ignoring measures taking measures. old people died. It’s part nature lot elderly die outbreak. people don’t view way though, see they’re loved ones purposely put harms way. think one guy New York hung banner bridge said like “Cuomo killed mom”

The part find truly shitty though governors knew this, especially Cuomos case anyway. authorities started catching tried fabricate numbers hide did. 

Cuomo honestly worst perpetrator all. refused use resources like hospital ships turning nearby stadium triage hospitals claimed overflowing sick. make self look good cost innocent people lives. made completely new mRNA vaccine. mRNA vaccines still brand new technology. FDA approved *any them* outside emergency. bother reading article notice *brand new vaccine attacking vectors virus.

Oh, thing ""off-shoot"" vaccine. I'm Europe mainland (Switzerland) wish continue Oxford vaccine. according actual article.

But hey, there’s non-zero chance even mask so... Listen, I’m thrilled project warp speed happened, obviously. trump spent 99% last year saying covid fake encouraging people wear masks. lots people died couldn’t listen smarter people around make masks political statement. didn’t secure enough vaccine entire population, plan distribution beyond “let states figure out”.

Do think Tennessee foreign country?

Are stupid? Anything better now. Currently 100,000 spring breakers florida. unvaccinated. hop planes back 50 US states. call people are. Huge selfish assholes fuel pandemic several months. toilet paper right now. Let's real. Things keep mind:

- ""60% *patients*"" subgroup COVID cases. ""Patients"" implies study limited severe cases required medical attention.

- ""Long term effects"" ≠ Permanent effects. COVID many cases takes months fully recover from. mean never recover. still level understanding, even long? see companies want establish new production plants countries. I'm sure could supervise process make sure standard upheld. person infected variant vaccinated, even vaccine less effective variant, still prevent severe infection hospitalizations right? LOL thought that. fun begins! can't resume normal activities fully vaccinated? That's absurd. Exactly, 100% agreed.

Yes, it’s total nonsense; Russia start production first time Europe factory northern Italy; fast go still won’t able start production December! even got Sputnik provided plants abroad still production capacity low now, won’t make difference matket half billion people EU Dudeeeeeeee I’m talking PR marketing perspective 

How convince people think science fake gay take vaccine based science? got Moderna one would happily taken Pfizer J&amp;J.  address point. news coming suspending vaccine, already news side effects. ignored would brew conspiracy theories. semantic failure. Words meaning. Israel lockdown month ago, schools closed, restaurants worked delivery only, gyms closed, events closed, traveling cities except work medical reasons etc.

Now 84-85% adult population green pass. Gyms open, restaurants open, **no restriction travel**, events happening 500 people, malls open, weddings 300 people. 

You parades 500 people, 50. Thanks that! reading elsewhere Reddit people felt like crap 2 days many “normal” stories. ask leaving cello taxi. start getting new strain booster shots? September, October?  scientifically makes sense. COVID vaccines proven prevent spread, proven provide mucosal immunity may create asymptomatic carriers. still spread virus, allowed anything unvaccinated people aren't, considering may still able spread it? Oh, know. play coy regards US; case.

Oxford never applied EMA US FDA requires phase 3 trial carried US represents US demographics. related issues trials. issue we've short supply. supposed 30 million doses long UK we're still even close. Surely Ireland island since bordered Northern Ireland? October. last March November 546 deaths, around 5,600+ 250,000 confirmed cases. Hahaha yeah plastering news blown proportion concerns definitely going help vaccine uptake! 189 seropositive patients resulting 19 hypothetical “reinfections” isn’t exactly great data claim.  Oh yeah believe letting people choose. discussion government’s messaging strategy it’s awful whole time.

 shouldn’t telling people “get vaccinated maybe sit backyard July” telling people “get vaccinated you’re DONE. Immediately.” 

THAT messaging would effective convincing people get it. I’m getting want DONE they’re probably gonna make us take anyway. 40 blood clots 17 MILLION vaccinated people...? bad news? reminds somewhat reading chloramphenicol. people able take fine bacterial infections, could also sometimes suppress bone marrow unlucky individuals per every ten hundred thousand so, basically death sentence due irreversible aplastic anemia. still unclear genetic quirk made completely toxic some. Yeah think happens willingness vaccinate treat cases like absolute caution? drops percent think damage versus suspending week ultimately vaccinate number people?  Coming country Russia got caught hacking parliament computer systems, I’m starting doubt Russia’s intentions quite frannkly. Lol right Texans best make happen. Herd immunity great. get vaccination. 12 week gap recommended Astra Zeneca MHRA seems reasonable explanation. Thank you. think also important volunteers knew following normal protocols set german authority/EMA/international medical community. mean confusing want punish people want vax yet want mandatory, seems counter-intuitive. Either believe allowing people choose get it, Unless already low dose aspirin regimen would start one unless discussed doctor first. qualified make recommendation depending circumstances, least far qualified random people internet. Meanwhile, canada cant get shit together Since vaccine made UK it’s looking politically motivated day. Imagine 32 people 14 million issues stop giving vaccine risk thousands others lives. Ridiculous! Sweden nothing! Herd immunity!! /s Thank you, I've seen UK statistics agree indicate AZ vaccine safe. However, UK used AZ vaccines produced Belgium, batch related UK would unaffected. 

Also, understand it, Danish Norwegian health agencies arguing blood clots uncommon, specific type blood clots seeing, clusters appearing, are. bet Boris May 6th. EU say fuck drop AZ vaccine imo.

It's easy say American spectator sport, Europe pretty much vaccine supply all.

The US UK getting 50% population vaccinated EU barely progressed month. one control group lottery none vaccinated group did, would believe vaccination causes lose gambling? care less made it. matters vaccine proven highly effective safe seems Europeans, whatever reason, best destroy reputation. decisions regulators fully approve already cost many lives. creates long term mistrust like whole shitshow saving masks healthcare workers. 

I confirm that's created lot mistrust me. know best interests heart, make judgement based evidence despite expertise field. That's uncomfortable position in. reason read comment Dan Carlin's voice (from Hardcore History podcast)

*""Can imagine must like? Listening music ageyn...and ageyn...""* Assuming think happening DIC - disseminated intravascular coagulation. It’s estimated 9-19% ICU patients (see source below) usually result sepsis. Seems unlikely doctor never seen it, unless saying never seen case linked vaccine case it’s possible still never graph comparing movement Nordic countries seems show Sweden restricted travel less early days pandemic, significantly later stage pandemic.

One possible intepretation early higher movement Swedes helped increasing spread early on. higher spread Sweden could reason restricted travel Sweden later pandemic. 

An interpretation along lines made articel Svenska Dagblade today: probably pay-wall).

And please, trying argue neither ""Sweden bad"" ""Sweden good"". pointing data. amazing think people die this. Europe cases going up, around 1 100 cases die unless get vaccine, yet something affects 1 400,000 evidence related stopping vaccines administered.

Imagine bureaucratic closed minded can't see obvious balance risk here. really doesnt sound great.
israel lockdown, many vaccinated recovered STILL significant case numbers even hospitalizations.
in ""but akshually circumsized men age 22-28 wednesday 17,3 days dose 2 werent hospitalized"".

i think US rude awakening. already planing victoy parades COVID. oh boy... I've read likelihood either bad luck due either random chance environmental factors(more likely) narrow genetic predisposition would almost entirely within Northern European populations (much less likely).

If vaccine, vaccines manufactured specific place specific batch believe we'd see things globally across EU. far know EU batches split among member countries fairly evenly bad batch effects would seen across EU.

&amp;#x200B;

I seen elsewhere symptoms like reaction get vaccinations (the number saw 1 25,000 reaction chicken pox vaccination similar characteristics clotting low platelets) given fact seems tightly clustered case compared vaccines going suggests may environmental factors involved, case could involve anything recent exposure virus hungover taking something (as far know hangover cures involve something opens blood vessels, including brain, gives possible clots better access there) I'm statistician tend range analysis data set,  answer probably yes, no. literally every reputable scientist predicted second wave. See reply above. Sources didn’t happen. It’s bad here, roughly 500 new cases day past weeks. Roll vaccine slower hoped still 3.3% population fully vaccinated UK 2.3%. UK going 12 week 1st 2nd jab isn’t recommended drug companies government taking chance. may pay time tell. far though pushing forward fast first doses. one closest sources that? reported. EU fully expected get doses produced Indian facility, regulators site approve facility. 

So call bullshit that. essential thrombocytopenia (too many platletes) take medication it. makes nervous getting vaccine. I'm already predisposed blood clots bleeding. Question regarding AZ vaccine: saw news ""scandal"" regarding vaccine causing blood coagulation issues (I know proven, also 100% disapproved). 

Is recommended take aspirin vaccination order thin blood?

I already first shot 2 weeks ago, I'm curious herd friend taking aspirin daily safe. national policies? blame EU lack vaccines, plain simply fault got text. lovely feeling. Wow, that’s serious screw up. Thanks answering question! Alabama. wondering “which state.” don’t know that. don’t even know that. That’s investigating it. Bureaucracy über alles. Australia lol. We’ll vaccinated 2030. can’t wait visit Ireland done dusted. Hang friend.  pleasure turning 21 last year. hopefully get pleasure goin bar first time year next pretty simple guys: 


MURICA FIRST, PARTNERS SECOND 


So partners turn backs US. Murica first leads Murica alone. GL future. Irish person ever referred Ireland Emerald Isle. lockdown, even use vaccines have... LOL. much happening also applies Australia, New Zealand Singapore.

It also aplies China, probably makes angry.  Maybe did. like million people day didn't. odds still wayyyy better getting covid.  AZ/Oxford screwed UK/Brazil trials data issues, pulled application wait US study complete. think they’re gonna give us back freedoms reason? took away practically reason enjoyed power.

Plus it’ll liability thing companies. Vaccinated people less likely sue catching establishment  yes head doctor hospital, ordinary doctor people Independent understand we're getting little AZ vaccinate one week investigate three weeks month.  EU hasn’t approved Indian plants - U.K. others have. explain EU far behind others regard? emergency situation EU regulators failed get ahead paperwork. It’s blatant fuck behalf. We’re talking world’s important vaccine manufacturer EU seems gone: meh, we’ll get round eventually. probably time rest world notices Australia New Zealand there's new outbreak. months things normal make headlines.

The rest world understanding Australia effectively dealing six smaller countries state managing health response. seem assume Australia goes lockdown there's new case whereas usually one city generally case NSW. Thanks - don’t know much process. I’m supposed US EU couldn’t use trial results.  [Will link older waiting US trials finish. ask approval FDA require analysis based US trial data. relatively soon hopefully month end.  Zürich, can’t even register yet. Kantons here. AFAIK don’t even enough doses vaccinate risk population. Italy threw guy jail successfully predicting earthquake. not? know UK left Europe :think: sound anti-vac. important past vaccine rollout speed. get first vaccine offered you. sound rather villainous More... ""Liberal""?! That's it, I'm wearing mask time now. tricked anything liberal! don’t sound like fearmongering me. Lots people quit wearing masks vaccinated. Headlines like hopefully reduce number make decisions (and policymakers behind setting laws). California urbanization rate 95% Jordan urbanization rate 91.2 percent. Greece 80% urbanization rate half death rate. 7% less urbanized yet 50% less deaths. 

What's next excuse? People still listen WHO, said evidence pandemic February 2020. lost credibility I’m 41 medical problems (that know of) got first jab yesterday. don’t think long get text link follow. That’s got mine anyway. think covid died respitorary issue think fair game say covid cause. one altruistic reasons supplying vaccines. Pfizer e.g. supplies money (and brand image), there's nothing wrong that. Supplying political image look wrong either, country would that.

Neglecting buy vaccine (and hence, letting people die) give political clout *is* disgusting thing do, though.

By way, I'm sure they're giving Russians even *more* brand image acting way. (a seriously pissed person consider family quite risk virus, also summer person lose second summer row, doubt get turn first dose August September, let alone second dose) Sputnik vaccine looks like forbidden fruit paradise, thing could greatly improve life politicians let have. Nobody listens Karl Lauterbach, neutral reads facts. predicted second wave. Yeah, famous eu coubtries like Norway, switzerland US. first stopping vacxibe two even apporving it.

That's literally case every modern country/state.

In words, even vaccine sound, smells like quackery. considering nothing equals death Germany 300 000 people +- 100 000 (instead 70 000+ reacted late AGAIN), shutting economy 18 months we're willing do, what's best suggestion? still correlation two experiment groups, placebo vaccine? studies lead approval vaccines done. mean successfully prove causation, absence it? brief:

The breakthrough covid phenomenon investigated. knowledge hasn’t large amount cases reported time. Even going google search request can’t really come conclusion: 

Minnesota’s department public health wants track notified they’re saying anything case numbers. lot public health departments issuing directives health providers. Minnesota’s shows google. Oregon hit 4 cases (albeit interesting since there’s reports immune evading variant Oregon it’ll interesting see develope. 

You’re discussion breakthrough covid though making sound like much catastrophic is. 

Everything you’re saying collective antibody response sounds cockamamie lot really interesting logical leaps taken almost appear like sort bias guiding idea that. 

And made claim reinfection apparently walking back on. 

Otherwise agree you’re saying fundamentally. Americans world looks like it’s going prematurely walk back safeguards vaccines full picture what’s going on. specifically like point Americans let it’s going ruin perception vaccination undermine efforts further. 

I assuming may actual data support saying 3 points really interested see data was. doesn’t look like do. interested arguing further. good day. isnt single plster defending AZ doesnt post UK subs. Nlt single one. “It regrettable countries stopped vaccination “precautionary” grounds: risks real harm goal vaccinating enough people slow spread virus, end remember last time happened said “no evidence” something Yeah, statistically significant difference found sure mechanism investigated.

But investigations take months years need know vaccine safe now.

Tbh, I'm pretty sure safe given already passed previous trials. weird put ""occupied territory"" footing ""country, province, region."" quarter Ireland occupied British. ""province."" Ah yes blame EU national policies. Get fuck out. Same. really care someone get vaccine. choice bearing health. Go nuts, unlike mask, they're hurting IIRC AZ even using new mRNA tech? standard approach using modified chimpanzee virus, no? Let’s remove aspirin shelf well u stroke ! Science one way street.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Er yes.
.. country country/province/region/occupied territory.... vaccine showed side effects, report claimed. also apparently 97% effective vaccinated. This, report stated, proven serological tests. vaccine could, reportedly, easily produced large quantities would soon possible vaccinate everyone Germany.

Will imprison inventor even vaccine proves good? Cool science whether Brexit good idea not. 

My agenda distributing expert opinions leading scientists regulators including EMA, MHRA, ISTH scientists I've following COVID news nonstop honestly never came across that. doubt read that, random article panic bating mean that's consensus. Media outlets tend report speculative information settle facts. agree basically everything said. let ask one question response:

Do think want vaccine treated second-class citizens, i.e. cannot travel, cannot go events/stores, etc.? is, say, punishment risking getting covid enough? Especially considering even get vaccine may still able spread virus anyways UK still using Astra Zeneca vaccine gives little protection SA variant? agenda british nationalist brigade setting narrative subs. Florida really phases.

Yes say, I'm impressed US response since January. would explain lot. difference found deemed statistically significant actual difference expected extend population. nice him.

side note - cnn need video playing boomer segment host talking mean say people trust anything Russia? aware widespread distrust western vaccines. LOVE Sputnik V, obsessed Pfizer-BioNTech well. dad take day. Yeah know. pointing ‘long covid’ basically different post viral syndromes. Lol. 

Judging comments quite agenda. Pot calling kettle black?

My comments backed world leading scientists regulators including EMA, MHRA, ISTH scientists  Europe completely failed accrue enough vaccines populations meaning October target date completion instead May like countries wonder stronger immune system makes likely experience side effects. father (AZ) brother (Pfizer) issues immune systems experienced side-effects whatsoever. mother (both AZ) hand pretty good shape experienced similar side-effects. definitely got hit worse. Disgusting. grand tbh. best, everyone blaming government opinion no-one prepared something like this.

Our vaccine rollout joke though. market propaganda everywhere. Reddit certainly it. even cia stooge AMA got cought. Also, paid propagandist dont usually stick one site. Nice deflection tho. guess nationalists free, would better you, least got money it. Good. Ideally, people able choose vaccine want take later year, vaccine uptake improved among hesitant right now.

I know certain groups put lot trust anything ""Western"" would prefer vaccine developed Russia. may good reasons train thought, ""deprogramming"" brainwashed would much difficult offering Sputnik V. far know, great vaccine, they'll take it… not? largely agree everything you’re saying. There’s quite wallop claims made thread chain that’s news lot colleagues.

Besides that, made claim find dubious? Happy lay out, lemme know get once.

If following chain, see people like move goal posts lot talking covid around longer they'd like, so, I'd love litany 'wallops', go there? right, oversimplidied comment astra zeneca, clear that. (I secretly redditing job ^^' ) market think Reddit comments? think would pay bills haha? doubt. talking hospitalized patients here. Careful word scares/triggers certain group people regardless understand actually means. 2.5x2=5? True, EU put aside ""conflicts"" Russian use good importantly readily available vaccines save peoples lives. There's lots possible reasons, example:

\- vaccine may causing clots

\- vaccine could differences batches

\- UK may also problem, accurately identify them, decided cover up.

\- Certain populations could predisposed side effect others, due genetic environmental factors.

It's impossible say certainty may differences UK countries - hence need investigation. Risks? did, said ""restrictions"" instead ""lockdown"" see, usually use ""policy.""

But catch semantical failure, want see throw 50 person parade it? payed this? Dude go read wrote.

Her **sending kid home wearing mask public health directions**.

Wearing mask **not** directions. think news? teacher fucking idiot, international Swedish standards.

It's okay misread things. Yes, also need clear potential side-effect. 
 
Pretending anyone favours. there's side-effect disclosed, absolutely need pause investigate. ""Forces"" forget 28% Israeli total population 16, since schools opened 50% new cases within 0-19 demographic. We've also testing per capita states. Deaths fallen 74%, entire month February single person died 1 week 2 doses. 

8% may sound lot need understand hospitalization lags symptoms lag infection. need know soon 2cond dose people hospitalized. days second dose really reflect much full efficacy vaccine kicks week two second dose.

For example month February:

\- 935 COVID deaths Israel February.

\- 553 unvaccinated.

\- 240 1 dose (so 1 3 weeks 1st dose, 2 unprotected yet).

\- 142 deaths 1st week 2cond dose.

\- **0 deaths 1 week second parsed time 2cond dose, may lead us believe still significant amount deaths second dose, soon second dose, caught probably developed symptoms getting second dose. Probably, text us first US rate average. article specific Bay Area. mean like American Swiss ones, even approved AZ? Isnt tiresome defend corporation id whole repuatition UK depends it. nationalists really project feelings everything. fuck? standard monitoring severe adverse effects. common shots even donating blood. 🙄 actually read it? Schools back person kids except red towns (something like 4-5% kids), everything else open. Sure restriction max number people allowed really enforced, bad. happening 

There lockdown, everyone go wherever want. pocket expense. insurance, pay it, Medicare prescription insurance pay it, neither gov't pays it. billed/paid less $20 per dose. Yes. Post viral syndromes well accepted science. then. I’d also love see information “high rate reinfection” I’ve seen 2-3 known large clusters none US. 

I largely agree everything you’re saying. There’s quite wallop claims made thread chain that’s news lot colleagues. ""The European Region includes 55 countries stretches Greenland northwest Russian Far East near Japan. ""

Bringing context 20 million administered vaccines see talking about. lot Russian accounts pushing misinformation. Got nose bleed covid, standard symptoms including confusion slept two solid days constant nightmares. 

After that, start every month dip energy could sleep full day effect. 
After week low energy go back usual ammount.

I keep regular 15 minute exercise daily, I'm 19 making covid symptoms rare dips beyond concerning me. basically agreed participate SinoVac trial company would give first doses got approved (which did). also contracts Pfizer AZ.  Lol oh got bro! guys alt feel like shouting stupidity? World Health Organization school re-openings, September Teacher support staff keep least 1 metre students. **When maintaining least 1 metre distance practical hampers support students, teachers support staff wear mask.** Pfizer Moderna vaccines use different technology, neither associated blood clotting issues. (It’s important note blood clot issues AZ patients millions people, isn’t known link - it’s investigation.) 

My parents worried getting Pfizer vaccine news reports allergic reactions floating around January. three us got doses issues besides normal immune response effects.

Currently (according CDC) yet safe resume normal activities, even vaccinated.

No, crystal ball know variants matter. promising data, also variants beginning escape immunity. massive uptick asymptomatic cases easing restrictions case numbers crushed means millions dice rolls mutation puts us back months beginning.

I know lift, title Reddit submission says “more liberal“. implies still least super-minor restrictions. I’m asking likely return completely normalized state, like flu. mostly Sinovac.. Pretty much pace vaccine. Thrombo means he’s LESS likely clot.  yet vaccine him?  Make even thinner created clots?  Seems like opposites going here. Yeah measles would good example experts also told us wear mask first live rural county USA one gave shit cares still dont people need fucking get life realize stuff getting better doom shit stop would hold every dose produced country given citizens. would force everyone back bargaining table. life death.

The countries would block key parts supply chain. commission backed last time. would wager there's list somewhere countries exception list going block. still think 15X contagious probably misleading. evidence I've seen suggest 70% contagious. measure contagious something many people infected individual likely pass virus to, 15X multiplier puts us past estimations measles, contagious disease deal seems implausible. aware mRNA jabs effective four weeks post first jab J&amp;J entirely right? GET HEAD point? seems like perfectly reasonable statement, sure you’ve heavily downvoted. Day 12 effects Pfizer vaccine really start kick up. think there’s correlation age brings years compounding interest wealth? Nah, can’t be! gain traction here. Oh, I'm accusing bot. would horrible. think 100,000 already bad enough. actually really good example. feel like pretty much stopped still estimate least 450 people died flu flu season (it isnt yet). 450 still ton 0 compared normal flu season crazy low. That's silly.

I sure view think OP spreading, know I'm supposed address.

Are accusing AstraZeneca? simply read comments see case.

If something else, go ahead say it.

I feel pretty good standing view there's nothing wrong posting articles dubious sources. 

To make ad hominem response hilarious 😂 takes time build factories...

The uk started nothing. rich countries invested manufacturing. point countries relying AZ produce usable product. product usable country either without find replacement amongst scarce available options. expedient solution AZ produce viable alternative. None Makes sense considering number adults believe Bill Gates boogey man throw tantrum wearing mask. Qnd yet half UK vaccines Pfizer came EU. Yeah little that. signed state portal opened group got notified could try book appointment. hurt sign ready group opens up. think Hungary mask wearing ""mood"" bit better, almost everyone wears inside, street so: [I took images 2 weeks ago](/r/hungary/comments/lt7xj1/helló_tavasz_avagy_a_képeken_egy_maszkos_embert/)

But [numbers even compared Poland, adjusted population: 1.7x daily cases, 2.2x daily deaths, 1.5x people vaccinated. Got mine Friday happy report arm 80% back normal today. Still probably won’t working shoulders little passive pain gone I'm missing something. Seasonal flu children enough fill ICU capacity. incorrect assume mass vaccination older population likely go ICU *not* going free hospital capacity? thought something like 40% COVID deaths seniors, seems like immunizing population ease acute crisis hospital capacity.

Honest question. doubt motives, see plenty comment history pushing back anti-maskers pro-virus posts. argument makes sense. someone uncomfortable working restaurant dine service, free to. McDonalds near hiring, dine-in service example. people quarantined back early 2020 advised, restaurants would open full capacity now.

False. Even countries strict quarantining compliant population (Australia, South Korea, etc.) restaurants *nowhere near* full capacity. *Life non-Palestenians move back heavily restricted states? Doubt it. many news outlets get incorrect. Austria suspend AZ. stopped administering specific batch. Probably 100k doses AZ administered Austria last days. kind tendency shady things like poisoning citizens etc make scared. 
must fake news. Nah carry producing countries problems it, UK eg. question whether something wrong latest batch delivered EU blood blot issues happened tied vaccination, somehow prevalent younger cohort.

A batch problem likely something. agency said otherwise. I’m talking patient vaccinations. don’t know you’re talking about. Please, worried enough COVID go open bars. Please try get BMI down, dangerous.

Use vaccine go gym, also bars :) trying kill expensive elderly. stupid, diabolical.  what’s difference forced vaccination entire country? either believe patient rights don’t. Okay, refute they're saying bring discussion back think main issue is. thought accusing *me* russian bot posting article Sputnik V. could anything. Hell, could something stupid children shorter, they’re spreading droplets adults breathe. particular IQ requirements prison guards see. mean wait eventually send email it’s different UK regard. people impatient want speed getting one. referring British variant, spreading primed now.

Believe not, people choice live lives it’s self evident people ok employers forcing vaccination. totally. get tested anymore feel slightly ill reported cases drop quickly. pretty prominent spreading views OP has. surprised take. Honestly, think started getting ridiculed noped out. 

I mean, people wanted masks outside mask mandates every flu season (whatever is) indefinitely. 

The ones get ""We know vaccinated people spread COVID! Continue staying home mask-shaming!"" 

Yes, know. possible vaccinated could shed insignificant amount virus antibodies stop virus possible vaccinated people become ill. We'll never eliminate 100% risk standard. 

Telling fully vaccinated person mask distance actually protecting anyone; compelling participe charade sake getting everyone else keep playing along. Macron told French people vaccine ""pseudo effective"" 65s generally seizing hysterical headlines French media, definitely they're desperate British vaccine fail face UK's overwhelming comparative success.

Hard taking vaccine desperately hoping turn work cause serious side effects. Probably some. met played many people level classical music jazz don’t really get excited like meet celeb. extremely moved. tired defense.

Buying vaccines =/= putting vaccines arms.

To fair split. Norway says ""as precaution"" ema, amount others, say fine. I’m Russian intelligence wanted promote strategic political aims Russia would exactly going thread. Multiple accounts shallow histories changing subject supposed US vaccine hoarding accusing every person expresses skepticism Sputnik V biased Russians, downvote anyone else oblivion.  See, make sense though; saying keep guns response measure intended keep *out* certain places. implies going use guns forcibly gain access places shooting anyone attempts keep out.

Usually 4th amendment message see repeated, one form another, ""I pursue private lifestyle want confines home long I'm hurting anyone use force protect right needed.""

The message sending though, this: ""If deny access specific properties grounds unvaccinated presence could harm others, use lethal force needed order gain entry anyway.""

So really want double check here... seriously message trying communicate? Here’s vox article citing Carnegie Melon study correlation race vaccine hesitancy. *cries Canadian* things continue decline, yes, large areas country go lockdown.

This imaginary pipe dream. reason people really want Covid keep trucking. Seems like one people. Keep wearing mask. thanks making assumptions intent one sentence. asshole keep wearing mask forever, give crap. completely awful, Texas ranks almost exactly middle deaths per 1mil US states, us average. Definitely show absolute magnitude tragic covid been. never necessary won’t post vaccine either... Coronavisus. vaccine asking about? Im Israel got pfizer one. I've heard experienced many types side effects hear anyone vomited, immediately later. really good news enough ""priority"" groups wanted take vaccine.

Countless lives ruined generations live poverty lockdowns, no, can’t wait month half. 

Lockdowns harmless better sure necessary. know, overwhelm hospitals? hospitals area overwhelmed? Mine aren’t. They’re laying staff. wish, traffic still horrible here. Oh look epidemiologist live high mask compliance area (including me), fully vaccinated 2 months, lay shit gonna fault.

What I'm commenting absurd concept people US wearing masks forever, won't. incredibly low probability anyone dying go Chilis

Clearly fundamental understanding virus even someone to, affected would people making personal choice take risk.

Blatantly untrue; wait staff forced often can’t survive without job. Anyone live people interact (at work, etc). risk. essential tasks like grocery shopping, you’re putting people essential tasks risk.

And start typing: yes, fully aware irony wait staff would lose job people didn’t go restaurants; reason it’s still valid argument because

a) takeout still exists primary way eating 

b) people quarantined back early 2020 advised, restaurants would open full capacity now. viral loads new virus strains 15 times contagious.

I'm sure NY variant indeed contagious, ""15 times"" mistake, right? mix scepticism tried true vaccinations scepticism Adenovirus vector vaccinations. ok?

for scepticism vaccine. 
its fact see little reason inject substance body likely cause get symptoms similar cold worse actual desease suppose prevent less symptoms all. age group is.

Except countless bans mod team hands imposter sus! Sure, cold kill injure you... we've won. Israel loosening restrictions, America.

Israels restrictions still lockdown, 70 straight days, airports quotas per day many people come period, strict bans number areas, etc.

MOST easing restrictions called ""Green Pass"" system, letting vaccinated people certain areas like gyms, keeping unvaccinated (as policy).

So, policy perspective (and there's LOT reasons vaccine lower Americans Israelis population standpoint, even part argument), efficacy *will* lower here, level regulation begin with, ease countries. 

The point say vaccines work. point say vaccines work alone, country, certainly large challenges America.

Period study over, real world, even antibody defenses highest country low strain variation compared US, we're seeing people two doses getting sick.

I know what's going make click vaccines cure (alone) America, let's hope happens soon. 

It's not, month. Miami-Dade fire people gleefully talking open Florida despite fact they're enter covid season depending least year's spike. Idaho new trendy place Californians like move now? many produced in/paid countries, sent US bottling/finish stealed export ban ? Freedumbs covid! necessarily upset, want see another Florida situation everything's wide open damn early. Find - Google makes easy. Independent research part science. I’m waiting point mentioned “Fall”? pretending that’s said something argue with? One inspirational posters I've ever owned 10 Star Wars quotes. need people like office! Stay lane Fauci. It’s super short, incredibly moving remembered forever. It’s Gettysburg Address movie President speeches. Yes study showing hospital spread left significant source spread. What’s ignored severity cases number deaths correlating previous, unrelated hospitalization. lot countries. It’s hard know say this. Like it’s almost mind numbing.  Glad could put together got crayons made digestible could told that, save big study. 🙄 idea you’re talking getting 1A. 1B ass get shot along dozens 1B people know? idk, mass vaccination sites giving thousands thousands doses people 1B every day, able sign 1B people appointments every day. could put anti maskers educational facilities teach proper science. Also state employees keeping close eye make sure mask doesn’t come even fall beneath nose. Pandemic state California pushing 6 feet mask. signs government offices saying mask necessary 6 feet. conference rooms signs telling people mask necessary conference rooms 6 feet. Come FL. haven’t several months. right. I’m glad redditors consulted economical flow boosted stuff like american rescue plan example. Something i’m sure fauci created himself. TOUCHDOWN companies even *now*? would start time pandemic better? literally understand word immune means trying act like correct lmao Oh, cases drop. Arizona's basically opened everything back despite ridiculous amount cases. We're clueless. true ? 

It used like France since last week, AZ vaccines roughly 40-50% 1st dose total number. Italy threw guy jail successfully predicting earthquake.

Source, please? thing find six statisticians jailed six years said idea severe earthquake completely ridiculous, six days happened. That's US refuses export vaccines made country. EU already exported vaccines outside Europe, used population. ROTFLOL. 

Good luck that. believe COVID-19 wait three months get vaccine. immunity still get shot. *does happen* spontaneously normal people. rare happens reason. Yeah. mean maybe minuscule chance vaccine causing Blood clots. Perhaps it’s even true Bill Gates putting microchips it. let’s take vaccine argue years afterwards - PUB!  That's funny, countermeasures we've taken covid, flu deaths pretty much *have* stopped That's Norway said. Previously healthy younger. Tell can't get anymore June.

They'll protest government says, ""oKaY GuYs WiN,"" line smug faces celebrating another ""victory"" meaningless lives.

You can't use logic people. Also instead warning FDA authorities transverse myelitis cases (and subsequent suspension trials), Astra Zeneca broke news investors meeting (two hours meeting FDA). 
Also AZ resumed trials without asking advice guidance FDA EMA, complicating purpose trials get approval authorities. malarkey evidence seen dinner. kept telling ""it's research wanna take vaccine rushed trials."" course kept asking thought world gain making everyone infertile shrugged said ""They're company, customer."" also right go work somewhere else they're direct contact enclosed, vulnerable population. People used make fun US vaccination response miles ahead EU. Actually sanitize groceries antibacterial wipes. Yes, know risk getting Covid low touching surfaces, understand bad luck. lot. knowing bad luck, I'd guy get Covid bringing home groceries someone Covid hands touched getting Covid touching said items. deal clothes. reply argument post? Beautiful. Nothing shows defined phases. Desantis randomly adds people decreases minimum age. stated beforehand one groups would educators people aged 60 older people get random doctors notes. 

But that's at. calling wearing mask, hygiene Bangladesh.

Getting covid waiting covid vaccine would suck unimaginable level. true. headmaster support Swedish recommendations. face masks recommended schools, recommendations either.

This basically decision single privately owned school. people lazy read lazy comment, people quoted article want choose 1) following advice doctor 2) would difficult make second appointment 3) religious objections particular vaccine. 

Regardless, America enough vaccines people able choose variety reasons none business. pharma industry, test things constantly. statement, AZ said test 60 times production independent source tests 20 times. Additionally, believe numerous sources tested specific batch yet find anything.

So, technically possible, realistically chance bad batch astronomically low. 

Additionally, batches small. sure we've got exact number, we're talking excess million doses, spread widely across Europe elsewhere. cases we're seeing localised. Yep, it.

The Republic Ireland best EU long time, North consistently punched lowest per capita case rates U.K. basically since pandemic began. Wake educate please, I'm anti-vax btw, I'm concerned citizen gonna take big pharma government tell too. Especially evidence science raising worrying concerning problems vaccine. called common sense, called scientifically literate.. anti-vax.

Government friend. take long? Yes. issue. There’s simply enough doses available. Signing contracts Hungary handful vaccine really Russian (and Hungarian) propaganda never read this. live near beach go lot. would think I'd come across story Sputnik V vaccine peer reviewed Lancet European American (!) vaccine experts 90+% efficacy symptomatic infection. also 100% effective preventing death disease.

Exactly. that, fact US holding millions AZ vaccines

My understanding (could WILDY wrong) they're 2 things: 1) holding already produced AZ doses 2) actually holding export ingredients necessary plants Europe produce vaccine themselves. second thing true misunderstand really really hard? “Always wait permission feel accomplished, thats motto”  would international condemnation screams boycotting Russia China.

SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7, variant first detected UK September 20201, spread multiple countries worldwide. Several studies established B.1.1.7 transmissible preexisting variants, identified whether leads change disease severity2. analyse dataset linking 2,245,263 positive SARS-CoV-2 community tests 17,452 COVID-19 deaths England 1 September 2020 to 14 February 2021. 1,146,534 (51%) tests, presence absence B.1.1.7 identified mutations lineage preventing PCR amplification spike gene target (S gene target failure, SGTF1). Based 4,945 deaths known SGTF status, estimate hazard death associated SGTF 55% (95% CI 39–72%) higher adjustment age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, care home residence, local authority residence test date. corresponds absolute risk death 55–69-year-old male increasing 0.6% 0.9% (95% CI 0.8–1.0%) within 28 days positive test community. Correcting misclassification SGTF missingness SGTF status, estimate 61% (42–82%) higher hazard death associated B.1.1.7. analysis suggests B.1.1.7 transmissible preexisting SARS-CoV-2 variants, may also cause severe illness. I'm sure increase confidence. already sceptical due told effective. Also, one-two punch winter surge burn lot hosts. Combine low hanging fruit group got infected got vaccinated, cannot see another huge surge happening. US knows get people vaccinated quickly another spike kill lot people. spending money getting vaccinations cheaper hospitals getting overrun. countries people follow rules mitigate spread desperate. Four months total lockdown trick. need lock another four months least. Interesting bit data here. seems average person (from study’s findings least) lowered contact others since February 2020 around 40%. big dip right pandemic hit something like 70% typical behavior, number crept 40% months wore became difficult push lower.

Along poster said 1B including 16+ qualifying conditions, NM also quietly vaccinated pretty much educators within past couple weeks prepare school reopenings April. ""Most people"", making things fit little narrative. lot people working companies large capable infrastructure still tech issues WFH. school districts couple middling folks used smaller footprint needs. 

Now they're trying serve every teacher's WFH needs, also teachers support entire class's technical concerns. Imaging trying help 5 students figure 5 different tech issues instructing 25 students time. quite easy job shit posting day. really, variety reasons - - world make plans. Based. don’t know anyone else feels way, personally, everything starting ever-so-slightly feel normal. sense shift peoples mindsets, restrictions loosened....it really might months :’) anyone using right now? EU pretty much stopped antilockdown argument too. trillions spent covid, could done quite lot probably (almost certainly) saved lives end day. message every single life matters, can't let people die trade off. I’m young healthy, COVID least concerns.

Yeeeeah that's works. uneducated really understand things talking about. would suggest browsing CDC page since use fairly accessible language. Best luck that. Cue yells now,""SUCK RETRAIN!!"" Thank you. Ive found norweigan articles none could see directly state hospital. Eagerly awaiting. Yeah don’t even get started Though announce ""reprioritization"" 1B group favor 60 qualifying health condition, whereas straight lottery among ages within group. Yeah fuck anyone can’t take break times right? Thanks much list.

Just wanted put here, Crush Curve Idaho also helping people find vaccination appointments help get wait-lists, great resource UK manufactures far reported one case blood clots. ...and probably expense citizens lives. really sad situation. you’d rather get sick still wear mask? People covid don’t special mask exemption card, they’re still wearing mask. wonder US travel ban end. Probably end May. Yes. 

This golden opportunity actors fill leadership void left wake vaccine nationalism west. Yeah, gonna tough. Helping help others reasonable. state inmates like 1A Moderna - feel thing time. arm sore hours later needed much longer nap normal couple days. took band-aid blood spot. feel great three days latter, important part. can't wait second dose two weeks ago. Canada knows it’s doing, maybe keep border closed US go away. Although would prefer alternative take get, 0.00005% chance dying brained. probably best... even approved

I see going wrong, though. asinine, b) nobody said wear mask time get vaccine, going around people vaccinated.

There always unvaccinated people. It’s annoying vaccines touted ticket back normality, yet there’s people thread defending fact country 90% 16 older population vaccinated STILL adhere rules. I’ve talked coworkers share sentiment. can’t go back normal that’s point? normal, mean masks, “social distancing”. thing, know.

I’m young healthy, COVID least concerns. Thanks information. 

Santiago amazing; feels like modern European city much advanced United States place. would utopia country severe income inequality caused unrestrained capitalism. Darn Chicago Boys. sane authority kill vaccination effort handful deaths 1000s dieing every day. How? cautious opposite hoping people get sick. would awesome Biden gave similar speech July 4. Unfortunately case Michigan. Cases trending last weeks. Quit whining deal man like fr it’s nobody’s fault deal Let's wait July 4th guys come visit us again. give us enough time vaccinate enough people last rounds virus fizzle out. shifts complicated sadly world detailed health studies started 13 months ago continued decades. guesses extrapolations. 

Sub-Saharan Africa way many health crises solved reasonable cost. world interconnected. Utah saying April 1st weeks now. Sorry, got mine. meant vaccine kids. That’s cap shit want even half bad flu 🤷‍♂️ still getting equivalent 80000 US cases per day... government gets plenty wrong, never said didn't. 

At point though, dozens pharmaceutical companies, millions people vaccinated I'll effects, lot idiots claiming conspiracy theories. found link website well. Yes never better opportunity push global health equity hope doesn’t go waste. think applies improving sanitation access treatments diseases like TB like said malaria parasites, Covid vaccines supply limited right now. 

UBI would probably less address diseases certainly would help people maintain basic standard living. feel like opening BMI 25 go general public point test positive COVID-19, COVID-19 disease caused SARS-CoV-2 virus. test positive virus. would patients admitted hospital disease caused SARS-CoV-2 virus. Thanks British vaccine failure beginning end. Vaccinations today 16.3% one week ago today. used to… 1989, that’s whole generation away.  know China’s rollout slow? there’s many people vaccinate? daily rate super low compared population. developed countries get doses ordered first, blocked patent waiver aan te WTO. Increased production developing countries would accelerate vaccination developed developing countries alike. Right India lesser extent China Russia basically vaccinating rest world. watched playing FB page throughout pandemic. seems nice like great person. Sucks dumb stooge like Bolsonaro. Maybe Lula get elected next year improve things.  think we're going blanket reopen border reported cases safe-ish level countries, proof vaccination difficult implement. need passport get Canada anyway there's reason stamp in. median age entire african continent 19, compared nearly 39 US. know covid really kill young people, given relatively young African countries fair say likely severely affected.  Like airport jams Trump ban? Try posting r/Jordan Jewish posting history see fast get banned. Taos makes sense. High density, high tourist, localized area Hell. I'd drive chance!  idea tightened rules 11th hour. rules place place LAST YEAR.  “2 week” fools...I tell Texan virtually nothing changed here. Masks still required major indoor spaces Right! government never gets anything wrong! I’m sure liars picked correctly.

Give government power said! Since J&amp;J got funding US's Warp Speed program, US administration probably insisted late stage production take place US soil control vaccine goes.

Sanofi's CEO announced last summer US would get priority vaccines French company received US funding. country fully up.

the things closed gyms… restaurants can’t indoor seating hand uber eats, glovo, pyszne, wolt, etc. deliver.

everything else open. say 50% occupancy nobody checks that. 

in (so far) 4 locked states (within last 10 days) difference hotels, cinemas, theaters, shopping malls closed.

so… it’s open… we're happy rest world, hard understand heartbreaking living worst moment Brazil rest world finally getting mess. agree. I’m sold idea Texas early. far numbers don’t bear out, let’s see things go. I’m less concerned daily infection rates, key metric hospitalisations deaths. risk outcomes mostly vaccinated. may see shift infections younger folks (as Israel did), shouldn’t lead lockdowns risk bad outcomes managed vaccination program. let’s see. Norway party EMA EU vaccine procurement programme though, EU schemes matter. They're probably close get EU without actually EU. yeah, production capabilities Canada reason begging world sell us. 

Obviously, citizens get taken first bottom list.

Me, 39 yo male, fairly fit, im expecting dose somewhere September-October 2021 didn’t say hasn’t hatred towards AZ Europe. said specific issue example that, good rigorous science. Ah, see. Thanks clarification. I’d love see go there, then, rather sit unused. feel like plenty manufactured use US time comes might used existing ones put much better use elsewhere. crazy, everybody brainwashed beyond using fundamental logic reasoning. pharmaceutical companies definition fucking evil, people intimately trust them. Yeah, that's important point too. felt need clarify person widely used AZ's vaccine is. seen similar numbers UK results Pfizer Astrazeneca. Also US reporting back Feb Pfizer Moderna.

The EU countries seeing anything seen across vaccines. Could come source calculate please? economy!

i love argument. shows none people ever actually looked economy really doing… cause economy killing it. Yes J&amp;J good vaccine, Pfizer Moderna still substantially better insane. J&amp;J good enough healthy people, saying someone lung problems severe enough need see specialist getting mRNA probably better decision higher efficacy preventing even mild case could much worse someone like that. believe answer? Half kids 0-16 yrs old vaccinated.

Also, positivity rates dropped 10% 2.5-3% since beginning February. comments removed spam 😂😂😂 Yeah, didn’t testing virus basically got city measures taken.  sure get outside much possible day. helped ton take walk around neighborhood day. Stay strong, whole situation definitely sucks ass, we're almost it! one actively sought? Canada one without manufacturing abilities Covid vaccines, US/EU/UK. 

Other Chinese Communist Party is. still central. geographical, cultural, historical… look russian occupation poland also “free” side things. want booster trigger immune memory response rather still remaining response first dose, try maximise formation duration immune memory.

These vaccines that. Many efficacy 90% similae regimen one tested AZ (Pfizer, Sputnik, Moderna, Novavax). wanna see ther trial concludes, one UK might off, already bunch issues terms design execution. - South Africa. Many African countries received COVAX scheme - Somalia got first doses today example. got second Pfizer dose today! sore arm first one Ive heard second packs punch. I’m weird “waiting feel like death totally fine” period. I’m glad I’m fully vaccinated! guess what, 30 most? Assuming morbidly obese, longshot reddit know, chances dying covid ballpark took gamble played science experiment everyone UK. amount European apologists bad science amaze subreddit constantly. NJ densely populated state country situated multiple international transit hubs. always going ground zero this. also populations steadfastly refused follow health mandates. combined prisons complete mess nursing homes losing 1 7 COVID last year come ghastly totals.

Down? compromised immune system kid one weirdest things remember doctor saying stand close microwave lol Huh, New York Times reports 1403 deaths March 14th 1403 13th. Oh well, huge difference.  


I agree there's good chance we'll dip 1000 month. made earlier prediction middle uptick created wider range uncertainty looking data That's source anchors outlook, want suggest expertise.  


Here's hoping see sustained upticks average hill here! 

RemindMe! 2 weeks Germany governing party Merkel already flailing, got completely railed regional elections looking huge loss upcoming general election.
The biggest issue disastrous handling pandemic, especially failure secure enough vaccines. 
I 100% guarantee last thing politicians want right potentially lose millions doses stick brits.

And yes conspiracy theorist. wanted add also pfizer vaccine! mostly tired next day slightly sore arm :) okay! RemindMe! 16 days baby Lol. Québec worst numbers US pandemic. Get grip like soft power helping people developing world. Helps forget origin Kansas Flu. Along couple centuries oppression. that's true. (Sputnik V, Pfizer, Moderna, Chinese vaccines, Novavax etc)

That's true. That's tested get trials done quickly. reason assume ideal. 

Out established vaccines adults one think short gap booster rabies vaccine, special case.

Generally want booster trigger immune memory response rather still remaining response first dose, try maximise formation duration immune memory. US rich country producing vaccines allowing exports. Indonesia. Reading snarky EU comments last summer telling Americans dumb still COVID.

Now Americans vaccines paid bill last summer. cases way down

Lockdowns void sale, delay bill bill due EU Us Belgium really need some...

We 12m residents shipments like 98.000 week... never mask mandates lol. people literally learned anything past *year*. Every time dip cases, everyone like: well, guess okay go back normal! they're shocked cases go again.

At least time I'm cautiously optimisitic amount people getting vaccinated enough combat dopes trying rush. Fine, get natural coronavirus instead.  willing dig data, one dose mRNA vaccines effective J&amp;J three weeks. course CDC going say fully vaccinated second dose could reasonably take less precautions point. Personally I'd prefer mRNA reduce chance ever deal sick COVID, even severe.  Perhaps AZ failing manufacture vaccine properly?

But can't be! can't Brits fault. must EU! Well, without way verifying vaccination status, see solution. US public seem interested vaccine passport. Reliable Covid data possible African countries. Malaria parasites deadly, though, much cheaper treat. 

This pandemic highlighted important health global basis. hope courageous world leaders bring better Tomorrow everyone. $1.9T per year global UBI providing dollar day everyone developing nations. Sounds like much realize means running money printers little real costs US EU. Brrrrr. Trump? also click-worthy headline. Osterholm doom gloom seemingly pretty spot thus far right? know that’s guarantee future predictions Please show data ""breakthrough transmissions"" ""collective antibody response"". Im genuinely curious heard that. Also, I've already explained lax policies probably better effectiveness measure, better health. 

So less Americans get vaccinated (in context) ? RELATIVE RATE. said advantageous? talking about? People high risk get vaccine already regardless age Florida answered question perfectly response nitpick arguments insult ignoring everything else. Whats happening young people getting cases? Giving Conservatives hope guidelines “Liberal” nice little slight. It’ll long July 4th. Y’all love hating Florida, it’s justified. Vaccines open anyone meets requirements, mass vaccination sites go to. We’re pretty good job though first weeks mess. took lower age it’s cause lot old retirees compared states. I’m pretty pleased progress Covid R0 factor 2.5 30% gotten 30% people vaccinated R0 decreased 1.0 (2.5 x 0.4) means dies minimal amount precautions 1 10 wearing masks.

70-90% needed probably going happen. needed. need vaccinate everyone 65 around 20% population deaths something like 95%. 

Also, cases Mexico going dramatically got already 🥲 agree, pretty measured overall lately Oh I'm sure texas florida stay open. matter happens. others, much. Sounds like fool honest. basic reality. things continue decline, yes, large areas country go lockdown. really hard imagine, considering happening world again? wear mask fuck everyone claiming prematurely clearly entire summer northeast  Still sitting NY waiting go age 65. Hope continues soon indoor bars nightclubs reopen also. Know many people work area. Live Soma it’s dead many closed businesses. Heard Mission North Beach lively now. start middle terrible show top denials covid threat pushback related shutting down. Nobody page supplies shit show. terribly. countries didn’t well probably many worse. leaders responsibility change leaders. Happy many places world including states but, American, jabs well deserved. Lovely assumption, considering said politely stop making things literally nothing else UK 5 million week gonna done Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine aka Vaccine Death... disaster waiting happen. aint taking crap. definitely take it. soon offered vaccine. mean cast doubts, addicted papers love reading comparing vaccines. defenseless market forces. issue tariffs, subsidies much keep inland production. aware willing.

But besides, think international companies ditch us short bans international pandemic? That's scare mongering big pharma's bidding. tried murder , BS killed 100 thousands. I've already made argument, twice, still unedited go read again, see repeating third time going help you, sorry. lol imply term really touch old person. thank suggestions, however misguided may be. Aside putting Trump, name one thing Fauci done help end pandemic. better good considering damage done early mask guidance. USA UK producing vaccines. Companies are. Eh, grandparents Florida told doctors turn went doctors office shots, sounds pretty similar they’re describing UK Osterholm quite fool opinion, much fear mongering enough logic. 10% country received doses. able hit 1/3 vaccinated sometime everything .

 state engineer one. Well, clear, we're already seeing lower 6x antibody response, so, bullshit *might* like, illustration 'UAC', use see many us die, Ugly American Co-efficient. Americans ALSO less likely proper immune response covid can't properly generate antibodies vaccine. think MAYBE correlation might, oh idk, even little bit? argument. Effectiveness relative number.

No, long list reasons. try shorten up, little information already shows higher rate ""Break through"" transmissions, addition high rate reinfection, variant diversity came effect.

In short? measure countries' collective antibody response pretty effectively many people kept ground course last 15 months.

That best indicator get future antibody response look like.

Basically, information says vaccine work much less effectively American's bodies, America's policies incredible logistical challenges small country simply doesn't. 

This course totally bypassing likelyhood less Americans get vaccinated we're using vaccine lower efficacy rate aren't.

And many other, super short sum list natural consequences sure happen.

So no, vaccine working less effectively American's bodies way advantage unless love lockdown roulette. Unfortunately small percentage people fully vaccinated. make sense slow bit that's case? Like, smart stuff? still insult me, that's lowest thing anyone shows really argument. Well move lives running around vaccine right visiting unvaccinated populations could spreading virus. 

Do understand this? UK quite strict lockdown since early January transmissions greatly reduced. also vaccinating massive scale hopefully we’ll soon see benefits.

Italy many European countries (especially CE Europe) experiencing infections caused UK variant. story first came out, suspended flights UK. UK variant cases must’ve incidence high growing. Thank memeworthy edit. true. It’s probably also haven’t really seen anything quantify person; I’ve back school true November lockdown well. Next time I’m train it’s somewhat back normal probably it’ll finally sink I’ll breathe little easier.  773 new cases reported yesterday (Saturday) - lowest daily number since November, 1,864 new cases Friday, 2,398 new cases reported...

That’s one hell standard deviation. stay strong stay healthy, every one asshole 10 love guys. lol wtf even shit? ""naturally gravitate towards smaller gatherings""

What next, gonna lunatic mob purge people perceive introverts? He'll move goalpost somehow. population US roughly 330M people. 107M vaccinated. That's 1/3 maybe dont advertise it? refuse get optimistic see hard numbers, seen hard numbers solid month two. 

The number new cases falling two months  Lol you’re fool think states governors certain party lock again. Cases not, social end pandemic nearing accelerating fast. point become one half country functioning normally half locked down. Also, act like guy one flaunting covid guidelines, literally said guy welcome wear masks forever. Eyeroll. Can’t believe we’re still debating masks whole year. got guy's, pain last twelve months need little sunshine. Meanwhile Oz probably vaccinated ten people far 😷. Yup... watched interview several months ago activist news cycle. constitutes dirt, it’s pretty tepid. Dude leading NIH focuses lots stuff, people protest bring AIDS attention, helped lead way change death sentence handful pills someone take. obvi. guess I’m sure I’m supposed take away that. best friend :aborted fetus: remark , gone deep end since covid. turned super religious , Ive known 35 years never like that. ( BTW even abortion) I'm still waiting... pathetically, course. 

Hey, quick question go... happens data set publish raw data/preliminary analysis complete actual study? Oh yeah, shit ton analysis. peer review. I'm confused think data set produce one set results?  True, human trials like 2 years tops requiring info long term effects. think german immunotherapy drug?

It's thing since 90s get it, ""traditional"" method thing quite bit longer ""genetic engineering"" piece attached it. Yes, get mRNA directly effect genes, designed so. side effects potentially different traditional vaccination.. slowed adoption, well study. mean actually considered intellectual ""backwater"" due lack data around it. theories seem sound. see.

No long term studies primary issue. replaced emergency order. understand why, yeah, preference. vaccinated, whatever hell want. aren’t problem. problem people like wanting dismiss logic science makes uncomfortable odd reason. 

The vaccines greatly reduce transmission odds even contracting covid. 100%? No. 100% never going happen. Oh I'm sorry I'm hundred deaths less 2000, like care many die Yeah brings case protect damage Fuck government.
Not single incident millions shots, yeah let us sacrifice lives keep dragging pandemic. patients admitted hospital people tested positive COVID? compelling one compulsory, indicates authorities think useful.

This entirely wrong. compulsory current approvals Emergency Use Authorizations, can't force someone get vaccine fully approved FDA. none vaccine manufacturers entire dataset that's required FDA approval yet, *can't* approved yet. Sure does.

It’s dramatic writing 101.

Juxtaposition heighten contrast.

Vaccine = effective

Other measures = ineffective

Skillful writers without even noticing happening you. see reducing risk older loved ones personal benefit. /r/iamverysmart Quite idiotic decision. cases blood clots Germany. vaccine administered hundreds thousands people. I'm one them. stop vaccinating UK authorities quite clear assessment. government incompetent? crazy worked pharma manufacturing years never saw bad batch get checks patients.

It happened always caught testing.

AZ would never let happen submission EMA/MHRA fully document testing process, must concrete approved.

People know nothing love chat shit extremely small chance even develop blood clots. panic them? really make sense delay vaccine seen concerned it. GET HEAD GET HEAD GET HEAD GET HEAD GET HEAD GET HEAD GET HEAD GET HEAD GET HEAD GET HEAD GET HEAD GET HEAD easily disporvable lie. evidence least 6 months. Anything beyond speculative reason believe may longer. Either way still get vaccinated ASAP people, even exist, dumb. day inauguration already approximately 1m doses day rising. 100m 100 days always pretty much common sense. People often complained EMA's slowness overcaution

As aside, caught defect Pfizer's production line beginning would result vaccine diluted significantly.  confidently say I'm going lock summer starts. I'm vaccinated everyone else summer too. can't make vaccination end point, end point. too. But, fine EMA monitoring situation. clear neither us going change minds waste time 😭😭😭 Vaccine skeptics gonna vaccine skeptic matter sub popular first months much know kept learning. really much going right keep people returning sub every day participating discussions. Mainly similar updates vaccinations numbers infected / death stats (since they're increasing lot unlike December January (in US), people stressing (in US sub dominated US residents)). Biden said US share vaccine can. understand politically untenable share point time. epidemiological standpoint, make sense, either. Another dead Norway rare blood disorder.

Even though cases pretty stagnant since Feb 1st, deaths free falling. expect continue vaccinated rates continue increase.  compelling one compulsory, indicates authorities think useful.

That valid line reasoning. reason compulsory governments generally ability force they're citizens medical procedures. Damn, don’t know happened you, I’m sorry make asshole. hk people handled virus well. gov didn’t. fkcd beginning people hate many things obviously liking beating kids pregnant women starters. Funny space man game consuming I'd probably giant asshole it. probably good thing I'm random bum. partly Covid got first, also hospitalised flu entirely plausible infected covid died especially peaks

I suspect large overlap demographic people likely die flu likely die Covid UK forecasted dip vaccination rate mid feb followed bounce back mid march. depends, UK people turn receive vaccine cause scene one want, even giving volunteers site hard time. many states US, seniors vaccinated, cases down, weather warming, restrictions gone nearly gone. Effectively grand scheme many people much US. New York State alone saw combined 15,000 deaths nursing homes AZ contractors test 60 different stages production. Independents test 20 times. top that, specific batch tested following events. Nothing indicating problems quality.

It's still technically possible slipped every single check, probability miniscule. much possibilities way higher probability - still keep hearing 'bad batch' top possibility. Except summer time... South US hit hard summer, seems like could congregating inside centralized air conditioning. Great news.

Despite this, however, Chile still midst steep 2nd wave, pace meet surpass record new daily cases within next week two. Mogus reference one point nursing homes comprised half covid deaths. 5 governors directly responsible many thousands avoidable deaths. Yeah use cutting line mate surprise me, people selfish fuck

Ah British tut silently, especially working class haha, we're pretty prone telling people fuck hahaha far immunity, I’ve read generally lasts months, maybe even year more. It’s hard definitive new virus.

I think, least early on, recommending people covid wait 90 days get vaccinated, haven’t really heard much lately understand largely figured would better delay giving someone immunity favor prioritizing none. shouldn’t health reason get one whenever can, since vaccine distribution ramping significantly, I’m opinion 90 day courtesy wait window point.

I believe received monoclonal antibody treatment, recommendation would indeed best wait full 90 days receiving that, I’m sure haven’t heard may obsolete recommendation. Please check doctor knowledgeable health professional case. way happening March. seem like throw away. Antimaskers gonna antimask.

So put blind faith vaccine okay. scrutinise that's bad.

Ive looked data around world case/ deaths fall similar rate vaccinate countries not. Thats possible, pretty simple well. Manufacturing vaccine done flick switch, process American vaccine manufacturing functional while.

you can't give system another country without extreme caution, mess manufacturing suddenly people start dying bad batch vaccine simply work, try hold US liable.

You might onto something. Letting virus run rampant leads virus variants we've seen. mutates, chances death transmission increases. mention potential changes death sickness demographics, well potentially limiting vaccine effectiveness. equation simply death measured two contexts. imprison inventor even vaccine proves good?

To even scientifically examine vaccine good completely new trail following scientific standards conducted. sure vaccine even still needed time finish trail. like enough different types COVID-19 vaccines already available. difficulty produce enough everybody actually get vaccinated. Devil's advocate: sub absolutely imagined would happen. fact, believe quite thought really high chance number millions.

The fuck supposed mean? Thank 2% magnitudes higher expected death, that's why. deaths post vaccine lining expected death percentages - meaning people get vaccine higher risk death causes getting vaccine, look pre-covid stats I'd prefer even robust estate tax. done right could completely end annual filing income tax. Cases started going Minnesota, really worries me, especially hospitalization rates also increasing. 

But vaccination rate risen dramatically past couple weeks, maybe case rate go level off. gonna lie, I’m hesitant getting vaccine. yell me, seeing peers people know getting kinda beginning change mind.

The writing paragraph article meant exercise juxtaposition.

Vaccine, effective.

Other measures, ineffective.

However, places took measures (in strict sense phrase, I.e., actually adopted them—and “took measures” loose sense phrase) quite well quelling spread reducing deaths.

What is, then, subtle twist truth purposes article writing. think you’re impression I’m avoiding vaccine fear sort?
In reality, I’m avoiding vaccine fear COVID desire forced take shot conform governments desire. 

I don’t care doesn’t kill me, simply choose take part project. 

Ironically, every argument use touting small risks vaccine apply analyzing actual risks COVID. 

I’ll me, you, better off. 

Blindly following science literally dangerous path forward. rolled flu shot would amazing. New york California come mind. Yeah looks like nobody agrees certitude warranted. society, part educate legitimate/illegitimate fears vaccine show value benefit amazing treatment. suspicious probably furloughed job nothing else right now, like many others. course would closely monitor main reason furlough, post reddit? love often people decide good ideas rollout started. 

It's really frustrating, obviously people getting vaccinated perks incentives. Conspiracy theorists skeptical people usually get irrational fears get something it. Thats superficial, ugly dirt poor people also stupid what?

May check mirror while... money talks need consider EU shouldn’t considered first world countries anymore. can’t even keep governance, competence, growth, GDP countries like Chile anymore chungus blood clot specific side effects Norway, Denmark, Slovakia etc. fit statistic normal blood clot needs investigated connection vaccination.
Also statistic works ways say would died anyways devil saying ok younger people die vaccine seems totally fine significant..  understanding, seems like it, eventual proliferation mRNA vaccines countries available right (since mRNA vaccines lot flexible production variants) Also long term effects could bad blood clotting mild loss smell. pulling data from?

that matches top ten locked states right? covid global pandemic. CANT really solve unless everyone else world too. globalized world, potentially dangerous strains mutate another unvaccinated country make way cycle would never end. Stop dense. [...] *“The dogs achieve good results average accuracy 95 per cent,” it’s shown. “And chance false positive result dogs minimal.”*

At least results reported seem promising. according article, dogs already used detect corona virus Airports land countries Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Finland, France United Arab Emirates, dogs already used airports land borders. People arriving plane immediately tested using dogs.” Getting vaccine isn’t protecting you, it’s reducing eliminating risk spreading others. 
wow thanks. soooo eye opening. 
yes, know.

who exactly protecting then? 
the people got vaccinated first? 
after older people vaccinated one left protect. 
for younger people desease (statistically...) joke. threat all.

so again, would (or anyone else age group below), absolutely noteworthy risk getting severely ill COVID, take time go doctor inject substance likely make ill days?

herd immunity also reached letting virus run course. 
I wait till catch naturally thank much. 
shouldn't much problem since high risk groups vaccinated long age groups turn anyways.

how many times gone taken flu vaccine far? 
every season without fail? 
surely.

I know easier write people anti-vaxxers instead thinking outside small box. Chile Brasil next Door lol they're really far apart #amogus What’s ridiculous thinking Denmark Norway political motivation suspend vaccine, it’s developed UK. Hell, AstraZeneca part Swedish. 

Our doctors seem encountered cases outside norm, opinion. They’ve made decision cautious. disagree decision, conspiracy theories tiring. people incapable waiting turn? wonder much attributed vaccine vs lower population actually vulnerable + natural immunity. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah death rate mention genuine, ever use calculation risk assessing. saying use vaccine, saying ignoring cases may result bigger refusal vaccine ultra cautious awesome! thanks much, added. fyi there's typo first link (an instead p) - figured i'd mention people navigating comments. thank helping fill list!! vaccine approved EMA safe abd effective see issue. appears rather effective vaccine help EU vaccinate population sooner go it. man sticky thread sub many helpful resources mind boggling Biden already working new team long inaugurated. Actually, Obama Biden actual playbook prepare protect country pandemic. t**** soon inaugurated back 2017; dumped whole thing didn’t make look good. That’s like coach leading team field saying “I’ve got plan...just go whatever want.” previous administration nothing get big pharma start working vaccine. political; it’s way things turned out. DPA what??? vaccine election day someone named t**** indicated political party created vaccines. Big pharma good it, got right work meant mega, mean mega $$$$$$$$$ them. Actually, already working vaccine requested administration.
Then t**** threw playbook made look bad, course dumped. one make look bad...even orange thinks. plan behind eight ball beginning even goof ball excuse it. Disinfectant! saw live jaw nearly dropped floor said it. thought watching Twilight Zone said that. tried ignore questions every time asked. bet wished hadn’t disbanded pandemic team. almost nothing ENTIRE year! admit Biden done mere two months t**** even accomplished entire year. thought “would create panic.” No, didn’t create panic, he’s done good job making worse. didn’t create panic, sure knew ignore mess everything up. Proof positive...just look tens millions getting vaccinated t**** ignoring continued spread. T**** absolutely nothing. T**** easily responsible 200 thousand 500 already died due total ignorance, confused do, prepared all. leader. understand people Pfizer also blood clots. Yes did. 

I keep seeing New York targeted happening states throughout pandemic well, even saw results. 

I know better option one. Hong Kong resident? so, yeah itl obv quicker there. also pay jump queue Dubai. currently illegal leave UK purposes.

FWIW friends 40s getting bookings last week 20s 30s open soon enough. difficult find replacements. people don’t want work prison environment. Short staffing already rampant. think vaccines fully approved opposed emergency use see mandated frequently facilities though. GET HEAD GET HEAD GET HEAD article written fine. project anything, sides argument project things - like did.

I think well-written, wouldn’t allow ambiguous projection. got first dose felt completely normal. Meanwhile, husband got J&amp;J felt like absolute scum day half.

 I'm assuming Pfizer, second dose? depend person? Indeed. EMA work quite thoroughly therefore couple weeks slower counterparts. mentioned offhand “I got mines, get yours”

Hardly urging becoming former US President, especially hordes media available him. Go FOX News tell millions viewers get vaccinated. Cuomo shambles would seem American education better previously thought. apprently lot grammer school alum high school undergrads remarkably well informed epidemiology, working prison system. think regulators trying cover arses.

There's logical basis think there's link given millions doses doled number cases blood clots.

But, safety regulator gets fired overly cautious safety issue. people feel like lest turn wrong hauled parliamentary committee similar explain themselves.

They'd rather postmortem say ""out *abundance caution* took decision temporarily suspend research performed"" ""based preliminary review data see reason concerned suspend vaccine new data obtained"". anti-mitigation people sub well, especially daily discussion threads, though hard tell many may lean way politically (populist / authoritarian right (sometimes misleadingly branded ""alt-right"")) since one sub's main rules political discussions. 

Not sure find data much country helped businesses hear UK European countries done better job US, places end closing result countries. US between.  complain people sharing happiness? Probably gonna get voted going EU seem political COVID-19 politicalized.

Last year EU leaders saying AZ work people age 65. true, saying gives blood clots, whats also true.

There many people paranoid taking vaccine really helping things.

Also something really simple fix issue. give person gets vaccine heparin injection. Looks like Paul Ehrlich changed ministry said new guidelines implemented recommendation Paul Ehrlich Institute, Germany's authority charge 15 events deep vein thrombosis 22 events pulmonary embolism reported among given vaccine, much lower would expected occur naturally general population size.

This move murder. one thing postpone vaccine appointments middle deadly pandemic, another country 32% feel safe taking AZ vaccine begin dwindle further. 

Is vaccine supply really bad appropriate scapegoat alleviate political pressure? states, like Washington, taking doses elderly give healthy twenty year-olds governor afraid unions, course lot us aren’t vaccinated yet. said cause clotting.
The EMA said cause clotting.
The MHRA said cause clotting.

This reeks FUD. want see real-world evidence vaccine safe, remember 10 million jabs administered UK, without effects, dramatically stopping hospitalizations deaths.

Meanwhile, many thousands Europe die due half overall vaccine supply going unused.

Just stupid. months come, heads roll reckless decision. 30 cases clotting 5000000 vaccine recipients. promising canine studies pilot programs year now. 

None ever seem evolve widespread use one seems figured dogs detecting Right. Pfizer also data-sharing agreement Israel help study vaccine. [It’s unique think point people making made massive fuss it; shouldn’t secretive affair learned got vaccinated someone administration leaked information. I’m expert really silly move Germany? countries done far pretty low rates disease, hundreds deaths day occurring Germany right now, surely last thing need blockade vaccinations? need also understand number deaths attributed COVID greatest piece fiction ever written. There's death COVID, death COVID pretty much death inside hospital. counted every death put COVID. Why? Cuz government writes check hospital COVID deaths. sub US-centric, 99% comments refer US daily vaccination updates, Fauci, etc. t’s easier go country’s subreddit. userbase sub American, 106+ million shots administered already, amount activity decreases get shot there’s reason ever even come back sub. True really relevant point.

Like, things, 10% participation rousing success. things, 90% participation good enough. Say want might actually encourage people skeptics take vaccine. seems farther along miracle drugs. bigger news?! Thats bad. Shoulda worded better.

Not mention going back campus person UGH. I'm excited that. makes feel like another ""wave"" cases US, deadly/overwhelm ICUs easily. suspend them. put halt many countries stop using it? 
It seems like big deal, evidence says isn’t? 
Is political decision?
Now vaccination even slower 😪 ridiculous decision, data 10m+ AZ doses given within UK alone show increased risk blood clotting. issue batch related rather widespread problem, long enough since beginning rollout doubt would seen events actually problem. been.

This seems like unnecessary knee-jerk reaction doubt u-turned within week, slowing rollout within Germany hampering publics trust vaccine doubt cost lives. UK data clearly non issue one redditor posted below. exactly sure compares European countries. One issue could potentially quality control issue? Like something vaccine big it'll likely issue particular batch rather issue actual vaccine.  I'm seeing US peak 260k cases (7-day avg) day peak 60k cases now. 77% drop total. seem like nursing staffs special drop. looking eligibility requirements hard find anyone technically eligible point. 

alabama 3.3 million people 18 roughly 1 million 55, that's 2.3 million people ineligible last week. week 2 million people added leaves 300,000 ineligible...oh wait, forgot nurses, doctors, paramedics, police, veterans, etc etc i'm gonna figure nearly everyone eligible. 

below (incomplete criteria) -  


In addition age 55 older people intellectual developmental disabilities, groups included extended eligibility people age 16 64 high-risk medical conditions include limited following conditions:

* Cancer
* Chronic kidney disease
* COPD
* Heart conditions heart failure, coronary artery disease cardiomyopathies; immunocompromised state
* Solid organ transplant
* Obesity, BMI greater 30
* Pregnancy
* Sickle cell disease
* Smoking
* Type 1 2 diabetes
* medical conditions determined medical provider

Also, critical workers following areas recommended vaccination Phase 1b eligible:

* Transportation logistics
* Waste wastewater
* Food service (includes restaurant staff)
* Shelter housing (construction)
* Finance (bank tellers)
* Information technology communication
* Energy
* Legal
* Media
* Public safety (engineers) That’s reasonable. thought talking little extreme. Exactly. statistic meaningless unless least know proportion vaccinated population. example, ~60% automobile accidents deaths people wearing seatbelts -- useful itself? Sounds like wear seatbelt, right? fact 90% people wear seatbelts, 10% unbelted drivers account 40% deaths -- power seatbelts.

Also case hospitalizations, use different cutoff least 2-4 weeks second shot. likely infections hospitalized people occurred vaccine took full effect. 

Another major difference probably vaccinated population tends elderly -- prioritize elderly? two populations different, random. People seem latching fact blood clots forming people low platelet counts drawing conclusion clots would impossible. Germany also stopped administering AZ vaccine notice.

Sucks gotten first dose choose stop good. date source? reasoning, curious focused deaths misinformation comments.

And also better people refuse take vaccine misguided attempt stick government. people spreading disease incubating variants bad news us all. Exactly Yeah around half country vaccinated, much half vulnerable. Makes doubt 90% efficacy numbers touch.

7/41 = 17%, crudely get 83% efficacy preventing hospitalsation? mean going old people, AMAZING amazing thing ive ever heard.

I know i'll get downvoted, im saying vaccine isnt incredible, happy proven wrong. partnered reason. Another self-destructive decision condemn Germany many months death.

Presumably testing antibodies ro see signs covid Never underestimate stupidity conservatives. Can't wait pandemic guy become irrelevant get vaccine now? Fuck. I’m 26 want shot. initial answer consisted two statements: AZ vaccine still FDA review come weeks 

Which true (it's review yet), trying rush FDA instead letting review what's best America abroad?

Which remotely say imply. 

So see answered anything ""perfectly."" nitpicking, literally entire post either wrong untrue. 2nd reply simply doubled down. I'll try best re-iterate stance 3rd time. AZ going approved time useful States. **do not** think FDA rush anything; quite opposite. think Biden reasonable thing acknowledge vaccine part arsenal, lift export ban. AZ US company. AZ vaccine developed America. borderline immoral block private company selling life-saving product customers lock away warehouses slowly expires. Medical experts warn might never shut fuck up. got letter phone call. Okay worded wrongly. meant 1a wrapping opening up. moving slow though. 1a done 1b nearly done now. mean moving fast all. part stand see rest said make sense. definitely going slower though.  would interesting analyse blood getting vaccine see rare blood condition. 

Given low numbers, surprised one-in-a-million condition people naturally vaccine reacted that, rather direct side effect vaccine. pointing single doctor seen something enough say it’s rare. I’m sure feel detecting infectious diseases dogs also contract disease looking plenty methods detect virus well enough. 

Do canine vaccine? know zoo animals getting vaccinated. That's Moderna, AstraZeneca. Houston seems like 1:10 lol. people seem want mRNA parents teenagers looking Pfizer. Still long way go. Florida December, summer spring.

It’s supposed remind people isn’t yet. think he's still tryna connect him. Dude alot people get Depends state many ""overweight"" get it. Since people, even fit people, overweight according BMI probably eligible. Definitely glad notion take hold.

I saw lung doctor last week first time since getting vaccinated... said make getting vaccinated priority replied I'd already vaccinated hospital work, response something effect ""you get Johnson Johnson shot, you? condition get Pfizer Moderna.""

I pretty stunned medical professional given everything I've read JNJ. (For record, got Pfizer vaccine say matter would happily gotten whichever offered first) prisoners die, prison guards easier time it. And, prison guards better medical care prisoners. So, basically prison guards deliberately trying kill prisoners make job easier. 109 million doses include 2nd round shots 68 million Americans one not. child 3 he’s in-person daycare kids age likely would same. wear masks daycare.

I find unsure cautious scientific approach. Wait see totally unreasonable, particularly November/December 2020, since new types vaccines. However point, we've already waited seen. Nowhere say that. think year ago 75% people supported Trump? clearly know absolutely nothing United States quit talking. number fucking bullshit, lol. Come on, can’t possibly believe that, you? Probably something straightforward like say. can't help think nutty anti-vaxxers! course scientists bad. agendas. one political party America demonized extent crazy. bit half voters? 

DJT got 46.1% vote. actually rather substantially less half, even though seem like anyway problem world need work together working all...

I agree you, look post history, see support exporting vaccines/raw materials, *to degree politically feasible.*

I think US can/should export AZ vaccine. think US exporting vaccines approved here, because: (a) still one hardest hit countries world (b) this, DJT president 2024, guaranteed--also bad whole world. Flu labelled covid.

Let's make lies J&amp;J like new super attractive woman moved across street guys want get lol. 

In seriousness mind vaccine get could choose I'd probably choose J&amp;J. hate needles lol thought get stabbed sounds less scary me. understand people probably not, assumed cop way patient would been.

Also Macron said although weirdly enough one ain’t much quoted ‘quasi ineffective’ comment Say link, yet amount people affected rare scenario amounts substantially less number people would die early due COVID infection due receiving vaccine shot they'd otherwise had?

nb, know answer course, pointing may necessarily make sense. Don’t think people would lie vaccines like that. Younger people seem intense side effects AZ general, possible.   Dude, get high horse.

I think clear way courts might go. think really depends particulars case brought forward arguments made.  


All said, think last point probably important. coming months looks like death rate fall low risks posed unvaccinated worth hassle trying impose restrictions. Serious question: article say 109.1MM doses, covidactnow.org tracks CDC data say 68MM? exact quote CDC reports 68,655,000 Americans received least one dose.

Hi there! Please [modmail like included [studies Israeli Scottish studies show case. Basically tested unvaccinated vaccinated people regularly compared rates infection.

No worries all. buddy. lockdown probably taken year two life, pale comparison post-lockdown bender. Well case US playing bit dirty. (at least now) demanded doses EU must filled finished US. Basically would mean raw material shipped US, filled finished shipped back EU. Problem US export ban, means domestically produced doses would effectively confiscated US. EU asked guarantee would get doses back, US could give that. looks like EU least small political win - finally. say exposure? I'm going argue someone putting words mouth. I'm saying people exposed traveling spring break exhibit symptoms whole level would result increased testing positive results. course plenty exposed. numbers show it, affected care. felt way. felt like one least invasive shots ever received. arm definitely felt next day though.

Be grateful live country funding science plentiful allowing us great vaccine developments scientific research. 

You position judge scientists. may reddit army support reddit qualifications don’t really give clout. too, high five! CURRENTLY similar death numbers Zero deaths reported yesterday San Francisco, live, 26 new cases population roughly 900,000. Since article Bay Area, yes, cases deaths hospitalizations extremely low moment, tons people getting vaccinated every day. Intentional sabotage? weird considering wasnt happening Israel UK.... got first Moderna shot today company, I'm surprised quick efficient whole thing was... queue less 10 minutes. Hopefully sign process administration getting faster, everyone access vaccines soon! claim somebody wants this? defenitely fucked up, thats sure. still ridiculous export like 10 million vaccines UK alone ship nothing back. understand small production UK only, tf would still export production facilities themselves. Same.for USA. export neighbours export nothing back. Atleast help neighbour Canada litterally nothing. 

Also dont worry people see goverments doing. Trying shift blame others mostly Astrazenica's fault. Schools vaccination programs, pushing vaccinate local communities vicinity schools.

Yeahhhh, here’s thing...the people hesitant also unlikely convinced government campaign UK emergency authorisation, means test every batch quality safety, EU conditional authorisation something, means don't? thanks links! think there's something that. Eventually going vaccines people wanting them. happens, it'll EVERYONE come get yo shot. may coincidence. would check doctor ear infection. dad lives assisted living facility Indiana contracted COVID last April. 

They wanted send ""COVID nursing home"" one point &amp; end go tested 3rd time, came back negative.

But scared sent different facility know &amp; staff know properly communicate (he aphasia). able help complications.

His facility basically like little studio apartments-- completely self contained space &amp; able quarantine fine.

He luckily got COVID minimal symptoms-- diarrhea worst him. 

But god... hard time. felt helpless, esp mom &amp; living far away. anything could really hope looking would good him.

That's breaks heart read deaths happened nursing homes. people completely mercy others &amp; completely failed. Trolley problem correction actually useful cycle thresholds made election. u ok? Thing is, real backlash start months US UK start moving towards normality countries still spooling vaccine rollout. 

I wonder country wide case FOMO looks like? Well, even choice? Godzilla vs Kong comes once!

In reality though, usually use local case count/positivity rate determine risk/likelihood exposure. cases relatively low, likely okay wear good mask good measure. wrote, COVID expert, data scientist easy spot spike trends past year -- weeks following major holidays vacation periods.

Keep preaching truth, brother Ok shall. Seems like know spring break caused surge though six weeks? False negatives intended outcome. ct high first place. one recommended high. technically don’t know yet it’s vaccine. I’ve read, like 4 cases Norway (2 deaths now), 1 Denmark (died), sounds like Germany people type clot based phrased announcement. 

Personally, feel like there’s either like environmental manufacturing issue that’s going since UK vaccinated millions people haven’t problems. whole thing bizarre though, unfortunately, feel like won’t truly know what’s going quite time. It’s also bizarre vaccines aren’t causing clots (at least level). Maybe California

[Total Deaths Per Capita Mortality Daily Deaths Per Day Rolling Average Deaths Per Daily Confirmed Infections Per Day Rolling Average New Infections Per Perhaps issue latest batch(es). ඞ Many announced date open 100%, latest I’ve seen may 1 date Biden set.

I believe Michigan open anyone well IDK permanent damage vital organs deterrent death.  dont live death.

But brain damage america. good luck getting assistance think reason lot elderly/pre-existing condition crowd WANTS vaccinated already vaccinated. morning Mississippi 10,000+ appointments available. continue delay rollout many open slots? covid kinda sus reduced cycle threshold 40+ normal levels January. reduces false positives. serosurveys cumulative (ie- estimated cumulative total infected date) snapshot (ie- amount positive anitbodied people date)?

That's good question. cumulative. tell, take waning immunity account presuppose (previously infected) = (seroprevalence antibodies time study). specifically compare estimates total number known cases date.

Of course, degree waning immunity infection impacts numbers, impacts direction toward fewer people antibodies today, i.e., toward possibility another surge. personally believe major *yet* (based know current variants, absent emergence ""monster"" think we've certainly gone 50% infected, least major metros.

I'm saying gut estimate 100% *wrong*, I'm saying certainty might bit premature. Again, can't wait see recent seroprevalence data. Going tell us LOT whether we're really finish line thing.  far evidence death Denmark corona vaccine COVID-19 -AstraZeneca vaccine causally linked. 

Absence evidence evidence absence. wording suggests measures nothing.

I mean, anything. Go look Europe, lmaoooo Democrats going cuomo unlike republicans, hold party embers accountable thing like sexually harass staff cover covid deaths. republicans bitching cuomo shove ass unlike democrats, republicans moral center. US persistence, digital acumen, network informed friends. factors correlate strongly income ethnicity. assume Chile. EU already knew position US UK purchasing vaccines. really nobody blame rules game known them. try play hardball especially UK rather silly arguments decided officially buy vaccine later dates said countries wait line. 

Look, live Germany (and 17 years prior Canada), countries royally screwed lack vaccine availability. difference EU production capacity, buying power pay whatever price vaccine (just like rich countries). lacked far political wit understand crisis, need swift decisions bickering shenanigans. over, leaders parliament held accountable mistakes picked 100 percent me. issue majority seem think isn't. get 70 percent continue wear masks social distancing would improvement. I've also taken doses moderna. going indoor gatherings neglecting mask wearing untill we're done this. Yeah, it’s strange. think it, I’m starting think manufacturing issue something. Alternatively, maybe countries better reporting? know instances US people low platelets Pfizer vaccine (a doctor died), nothing like we’re seeing right AZ Saudi Arabia sourcing shots India blood clot incidents reported fear mongering going endanger far lives possible blood clout incidents confined EU factory sourced shots. Border closure never solution pandemic. Borders mostly opened since last summer. Real effect comes prohibiting mass gathering closing schools. remember that. needed shut border completely non-americans chance containing covid early on.

Yes know democrats would opposed this. go movie. death wish lol. sent FDA yet, seems they're referring peer review (or sort review least). I'd hope efficacy results trial come next weeks, definitely FDA decision. Surely live data millions doses would helpful Biden Harris discouraging people taking vaccine last fall election. murmurings States may follow suit? 

Champing bit NY get shot. cases spiking let go wild? sounds like terrible idea. anecdotal evidence conflicts other. now? Amongus possible vaccine getting suspended political reasons? (So governments later blame vaccine safety rather incompetence ordering/rolling out). Otherwise it’s difficult explain stopping them, prevalence thrombosis vaccinated people indeed less unvaccinated people. Unless cases/instances don’t know about. UK still full go ahead, far know. Perhaps find whole lot incidents? reports people German subreddit family friends got blood clots vaccine whose doctors draw connection (and presumably report cases). NOOOOOOOO also said proof human human covid transmission spreading several countries, masks point. Hard find reactive organization lately, state otherwise when(if) whole world already clear.

Also, ""the vaccine"" exactly pure compound like refined table salt, maybe AZ trials exactly same, maybe quality control flaky... clear easy make right, since AZ trouble trouble meeting quotas, put even pressure rush production... bulk clotting cases reported EMA said DVT pulmonary embolisms. common thromboembolic events typically affecting 1 1000 per year. I've read ""unusual"" cases seen Norway. wider cases outside Norway less common brain clots? believe halting AZ rollout globally would overreaction. Europe throws dangerous third wave. Miamian here, that’s elementary school mandatory requirements Another thing replicated UK. neither things America, though suspect politicians sides would blocked attempt either those. 

You remember Trump trying close border China Democrats saying allowed that's racist?

This strange. vaccine rolled around ten weeks across 17 million people vanishingly small number cases. problem vaccine would expect spread fairly evenly across whole continent relation number people vaccinated throughout last two half months. 

One hospital reporting three cases time young people seen brought several times evidence issue AZ vaccine. Three cases small time period localised geographical area really point general vaccine problem rolled long time across large area. would suggest something else caused this.

The UK published data kind thing Pfizer AZ remarkably similar area. Please enlighten Ok Mr lockdown conspiracy / conspiracy viewer. prevalence long COVID.

Reminds r/news threads full anecdotes people saying something effect ""long covid"" covid destroyed lives thoroughly death would mercy. IDK make cause never really tried discussing someone J&amp;J already way arms AZ. Source? wait Wednesday EMA

But MHRA already explained link. number blood events expected normal population.

You're welcome offer. temperature side, like safe. No? Couldn’t find anything close concerning Pfizer Moderna J&amp;J matter. location. age. People 50 low platelet counts don’t usually get brain clots. Germany doesn’t act unless there’s actual evidence concern. 

The cases extremely unusual. Caution good thing. Scientists handling it. sure? K Looks Spain well. point might easier list countries suspending it. Maybe, need fill 60 beds bet ass they're going agreeing steep discounts monthly fees. Especially people ask ""How trust allow family die negligence?"" They're similar. main difference J&amp;J uses human adenovirus AZ uses chimpanzee adenovirus, special insights particulars production process, preservatives, etc say might important difference. I'm right overreaction AZ probably *doesn't* actually cause clotting disorders deaths, really matter they're similar, it? Anti-vaxxers! amogus? Impostor? amogus? I’m 65 pre-existing conditions able book appointment first dose coming Wednesday Kaiser northern CA. happened lot sooner expected. 

I thought would getting mid-April. Super stoked. never said immune catching COVID chances getting sick significantly reduced. entire point reduces severity minor annoyance majority people. First all, I’ve done nothing wrong, merely stated opinion. don’t share anything covid related FB period. Second all, certain countries HALTED distribution investigate happened AZ. means could something actually wrong, hence looking it. never endorsed encouraged anyone (who hive mind regardless actually use brain given them) get vaccine including AZ. suspicious. ECMO =/= Hospitalization make cancel vaccination plans one study.

This one study comparing immunity vaccines immunity infection, lot studies showing previous infection provides natural immunity covid. Well laws Polish think COVD rated nonsense. guessing attitude comes homeland also people experience side affects getting second dose Moderna vaccine much first shot? amogus !remindme 24hrs Ya legit people sub questioning whether public even made aware this. It’s insane I’m shocked. sub one failed vaccine away total breakdown i’m discord someone canada told expect till september. meanwhile get second shot next week. couldn’t agree more. Especially unfolded LTC homes pandemic. It’s complete utter failure. Lmao same. said encouraging news. mean we're woods yet. Anything objective thought seems construed anti-vax propaganda. record I'm much pro vaccines. Miami Beach name city. specifically referring people beach. First sentence article: ""Spring breakers Miami Beach continue pack bars restaurants amid coronavirus pandemic rising count variants."" Also article: “Obviously, you’re swimming ocean, risk extremely low,” Marty said. “If you’re crowded space indoors, that’s poorly ventilated, lot people bubble, risk becomes quite high. continue measures exist protect infection, means distance, cleaning, masks.”

Looks like poutrage misplaced. grandpa 2 strokes February, 79 fragile get one...
I hope die... Random events actually surprising clumpy.
The vaccine produced quality controlled, fine.  Moderna doses given Europe outside trials: 0 Foolishness forever humanity’s downfall didn’t Dr. Gregory Michael get Pfizer? thought new blood clot concerns Astra Zeneca. 

Is general (very rare) side effect vaccine? reason it’s making headlines many people getting vaccinated short period rare side effects become noticeable? evidence COVID vaccines causing different side effects? dont know anything blood clots.

If pick large set people though look weird patterns find some. Thats people cautious doesnt mean link even likely one. Same. people want get shot get with, get back front-line jobs protection asap  basically, 1a 1b bigger vaccinations began? 

And next weeks see appointments much easier find move 1c beyond? stop there? sounds like American cancer patients pretty good. take cancer medicine give third world cancer patients. It’s fair right? that’s done maybe also strip prosthetics vets. subsistence farmer probably needs more. vaccine may important one arsenal ease deployment. habit slanting statements effort produce desired behavior.  Coworker SF bought house Boise. trying convince election rigged since November. Tutting jump queue? Source? One article... I’m hoping mid May. second shot 2 weeks. We’ve rescheduled trip 5 times really don’t want make 6. Putting terms dullards Texas understand. Australia cocky? think anyone catering vocal minority. vast majority data supported virtual learning throughout pandemic. Obviously needs end safe (aka fall semester), posters need calm realize colleges, society looking somewhat like used September. worried nothing. give vaccine million folks, *wave arm* million folks placebo arm, expect get number heart attacks, strokes, etc. Enjoy day tomorrow. Ehhh. Apparently, Ireland tried Oxford vaccine UK, blocked [reported Pretty funny admit would rather let people die give vaccines need. Really painting great picture USA here... Bye. okay may worded well. opened 1b shots past week. far know TX really dragging ass getting vaccines out. waited long mine. seeing states. Arizona, Louisiana Alaska. 

My husband went Louisiana get rate May could get it. 

Now said blaming healthcare workers anything like that. amazing deserve nothing credit. 

I'm understanding took us 3 months get 1a states already opening pretty much everyone 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

Apts hard get though. younger sister struggling get somewhere. offered take state us turned us down. guess see long take her. target audience. Phew time first day spring superspreader event. Thromboembolic conversion look like this. Clearly government great job long term planning since plenty vaccine. not. America doesn’t owe vaccine. Look country government.  Exactly, remember said 90% February 2022! sound right all, what's math pace keeps getting quicker day. first shots going almost double week? We're 70 million far. everyone chooses supposed vaccinated May 1?   supposed happen takes two months ""much liberal""? Canada sadly bit behind mark summer.

probably mid-august. Yes, lockdowns last resort. QLD locked one two cases recently feel confident variant cases had. QLD feel confident, health teams job contained. Hopefully lockdown time.

No way NSW lockdown case. must plane rides last month felt chillier pre pandemic plane rides. may sound cold I'm sure I'll get downvoted 7.3k 328 million incredibly small number. can't allow feel distress long death suffering exists always will. need unexpected triggers like that😭 Baffling. Thank kind too. rough year almost came angrier hateful person I'm trying best. 
Hang there, best luck both! Yeah especially vaccine tracker says 90% US vaccinated early August current rate. people changed mind science established contracting covid surfaces uncommon compared close proximity others.

It’s hard remember much panic driven simply knowing facts last spring. guess I’m misunderstanding you? I’m TX well they’ve allowing 1a 1b get vaccinated while. 1c starts tomorrow. However, many people 1a haven’t gotten shots yet, appointments hard get. saying too? Glad got shot btw. :) Tyrants never allow us done gives power. Stop listening them. don’t speak Norwegian expertise medicine immunology. combination low platelets blood clots something occurs similar rates unvaccinated population populations people taken vaccines? Nice! oh. important k ow take allergy pulls take vaccines; unlike previous ones.

besides that; I'm mostly ok academic/healthcare report time. Yeah get Twitter tell people well versed study hemoparasite vector transmission wild animals. known vector transmission corona viruses. (Not even mentioning Covid). Hence absurd claim made. remember set goal beginning, people questioning whether possible made mistake. like drunk driving obesity

Drunk driving illegal... Obesity isnt contagious... got doses flew Arizona recently. stuff AZ outdoors stuff. plane ride everyone wore mask bad. Traveling within US right longer huge risk like months ago. zero issue people traveling unless anti vax types idots never get vaccine. Good point, neglected look. Thank kind point out. Thank again! talking about? Amazing. conservative growth rates get us 4M/day end april. Putting everything together, 360M shots end May Americans want end June.

Given J&amp;J production estimate along estimation 30% unvaccinated population covid (and maybe 2/3 immunity), herd immunity memorial day (70%), June really chasing people get vaccinated. 

How quickly everything opens seems based sociological choices stragglers getting vaccinated anything else. Big deal multitrillion dollar economy, every week extra get, worth like $100B.

What excited aside life? Nba playoffs full crowds. Playoffs start around memorial day. I'd agree would certainly save many lives Trump willing make clear, no-nonsense public statement people get vaccinated. 

But would have, year 2020, saved many lives Trump sort person who'd sort thing first place... refreshing majority people neither want need government parent them. actually expected opposite reaction.

""But far getting together friends going restaurants, etc, planning start living life again."" Luckily consistent current CDC guidelines. People railing CDC guidelines right they're extremely unintrusive vaccinated beyond still wear masks public. key selling point AZ one cost fraction others. It'll become dominant vaccine across world. That's pretty false equivalent. look percentages. US able vaccinate 2-3 million people day that's less 1% population.

The US footing bill too, rest world eventually benefit. 

Even possible US somehow vaccinate countries, think unreasonable vaccinate population first. Can’t wait till people like go back ignored It’s like made decision blood oath. They’ll likely adjust things look good, it’s better prepared remote learning not. downvotes?? That's really good question asking. Questioning vaccines make u anti-vaxx Oh dear.. would think people would gathered statistically significant sub now.

There anecdotal reports doctors saying cases unusual, stats new issue is. taken AZ vaccine, think that's enough worried?

They likely also breathed air, drank water etc. lead us ban air water, need evidence that, moment Good job, case wrong link, created countries worth anti-vaxers. one's going trust suspect might deadly side effect chose ignore it. Norways Pandemrix vaccine 09/10.

That hasnt shown happen vaccine. Isn’t Israel already true litmus test?

Aww appreciate that! day's work! impossible cases *not* drop vaccinations continue...

The use supply great either, points distribution issues. choice, half US act like babies. vaccinated many yet.

as well sometimes rare generic sequence specific racial subset shows often. less straightforward science gives anti-vaxxers ammunition. Experts explain data terms general public understand try water even arguably noble public health goals - creates long term mistrust like whole shitshow saving masks healthcare workers. loop. nearly done? vaccines effective strains except African variant? Australia accepting cases enough people vaccinated. can’t keep COVID cases zero forever borders open, whole point vaccinating stop hospitals overflowing. lol know 50 vaccinated contacted emergency room - ten sent hospital

Probably connected 50% selfish would rather put others risk miss hair cut. question whether enough reason give much attention couple cases thrombosis, quite common also noticed clinical trials. Unless known public point, think so. whole scare 'free', cost terms lower vaccination rates. One rarely dies participating lottery, least outside Russia.

With risk like 1 2000 10000 death, I'm concerned dying, double digit percentage long-term damage I'd like prevent. plane air get “recycled”? front? back? vents strewn throughout?

Genuine question. Lol trollpost backfired where’s bot votes?  Interesting countries run authoritarian assholes done worst covid... tell funny jokes. Thanks. honest, Astra Zeneca approved US, would issue getting based know right now. preventing mass vaccination sites opening within next 3 weeks?

Also, ""they"" one giant entity, experts disagreed contradicted eachother many times this, even popular ones like Gottlieb, Fauci Osterholm. got mine.

Until person isolate? let panic addicts self-righteous loons get down! ✊🏻

No wonder many americans died covid deniers everywhere. thing is, GOING reaction second shot (Pf Mod) first shot J&amp;J. felt pretty ocky full day shot. That's actually body teaching fight something never encountered before. mild flu-like symptoms. me, lasted one day. woke day 2 100% again... far severe reactions, severe (read: anaphylactic) reactions shots site. flag people history anaphylactic reactions anything (myself included: bananas). great one day feeling like crap. Thank much this, really helps hear folks situation. developed produced vaccine what’s problem?? government giving away vaccines countries citizens vaccinated? sounds like problem country opposed US. You’re using US scapegoat. don’t think anyone answer this. One thing keep mind, though, 95% isn’t 100%. Well let's hope better '29 never even took vaccine?  UK's plants authorised EMA.

Everything EU says UK, basically political nonsense. will! Hang maybe, maybe, know they’re talking listen them. Instead see crap “now people listening they’re addicted spotlight!!” widespread distrust science experts ignorant! Biden prioritized teacher childcare worker vaccination. States trying take credit it.  shoot ‘em all, right? way, can’t spread virus, right? know people get JnJ US here, know 20+ people least gotten hospital doctors office, excluding people know work hospitals (myself included) likely got job. Fauci indeed triger anti science conservatives. growth rate 3 weeks ago, whenever pre snowstorm week was?

Be nice range expectation ramp to. clear theres lot headroom ceiling, particularly stimulus funding increased supply cities? Outdoor use still common DC, Philly, NYC I’ve seen last couple days. oh, actually LOT data it.

[here whole B.1.1.7 strain, keep hearing about. 

In thread links bunch studies well. sub downvotes facts &amp; data match political agenda beliefs. nuts here. going back normal soon! Sorry world rainbows flowers. rollout overwhelming success, we're approaching 5m vaccinated per day. I'm starting understand oblivious. Seems like immune basic math. UK basically zero vaccine production capacity COVID. 

Theresa May's government realised 2017 (IIRC), got ball rolling. facility signed meant running years time. They've doubled funding now, it'll finished summer. 

But UK's vaccine production capacity created last year, response COVID, basically writing AstraZeneca blank check saying 'get us domestic production'. two weeks conclusion false alert, hundreds people got health issues example bad batch? think trust AZ would close zero many people continued vaccination countries EMA investigating possible risks. Agree completely! There's reason throw arms air go, ""Meh, is. somehow accounted people insufferable jerks."" alternative? anything? Sure, cultural change happens slowly, part letting people know actions unacceptable holding accountable. number people clots meaningfully higher people vaccine compared funny thing year ago, wearing mask form punishment/a deterrent/shaming technique encourage hospital staff get flu shot. 

Now ""omg could even think leaving house without mask?!"" 

It'll interesting see happens 100 day mask mandate expires. probably able book receiving letter FYI um much better could possibly want??? seriously, 200 children nearly HALF MILLION casualties US. That's almost 33.333333%! 

&amp;#x200B;

:) helped 4 people find appointments today! that's hope too. planning trip year, waiting. 2 pfizer shots done little hope smarts humans ain't so. made up. behalf us: thank you! data disagrees position falsified. 

I believe you. made up. extremes. every ""The vaccine actually microchip tracking device"" also ""Vaccinated people still need live vaccine"". dangerous. spent time covering destruction Trump's old hotels, much pure delight Reddit Twitter. Oh dear... alright, let's this, suppose..

Ok, so: counting blood clots, there's increase part population received AstraZeneca. clots lungs legs, common types. That's fine. But, Norway countries see now, severe types blod clots (located stomach brain) combined low platelet counts. seen unvaccinated population.


Are me? reason show statistic, there's severe cases, looking stats covering blood clots, make difference. obviously makes large difference affects. let repeat: see people received vaccine. ""regular clotting issues"". combined low platelets, clots located brains stomach. normal pattern that's enough reason concern medical officials. 

I really hope gets proven vaccine cause. trying convince others make happen.

Let's wait till investigate cross fingers hoping related, let's stop pretending that's serious issue that's wish. Israel thousands people getting confirmed test literally 41 ECMO machines entire country.

If person two shots mRNA vaccine, plus whatever arbitrary amount time we're deciding counts 'full protection' ends ECMO, change stance say even society that's fully vaccinated free death Covid? 

Real question, hostility. dishonest rhetoric? What's you? Meanwhile canada.... That's thought, considering barely started deploying vaccines less year enough data long term effects. Thank information! stop selfish stay f*ck home /s Yeah, media taken away nearly means effectively communicate people.

Fauci *you* ask Trump make pro vaccine video post Twitter account behalf? Oh wait, Twitter probably ban account result lol Don’t worry, it’ll soon enough won’t listen anymore. It’s going nice going back pretending half people around us aren’t belligerent rednecks. Never anything assuredly politically safe move. really, Pfizer deliver AstraZeneca cannot. 600M doses order delivered summer. explain further? saying virus spreads less outdoors saying Covid doesn’t spread outside would make masks outside pointless? mean; US trials taking long compared European trials? I've seen number Europeans, comments Ars Technica, complain we're sitting freezers full stuff, AZ's factories ready go manufacture, they're dying we're effectively hoarding stuff need. know something Euros don't, simply disregarded haste get anything people? I'm schmuck cellphone seems we're going use it, whatever reason, say much start exporting will. Fuck. best friend Paris admitted ICU Covid yesterday.

They got spouse, school forced attend class person despite BEGGING school let distance learning. instructor enforce Covid protocols coughing class.

It's infuriating. definitely helped I’ll explain why.

In final days Trump admin, distribution horrendous communication around non-existent. States promised different amounts every day trouble planning whether use reserve shots gamble they’d enough 2nd rounds time came. fact bad, HHS even started telling states vaccines around January 20th. first things Biden admin smooth communication. immediately implemented plan tell states expect terms deliveries 3 weeks out. huge shift vaccine planning. sudden states could count arrival second doses freeing doses 1st shot. want proof this, look percent vaccines used change weeks following inauguration. went 50% near 80%. Biden admin took major steps increase cooperation states. includes steps terms partnering black brown churches distribute vaccines. groups among vulnerable skeptical vaccine. partnerships communication play huge role declining daily deaths. also signed orders allowing pentagon finally deploy troops help vaccinate. early February plans deploy least 1000 national guard members set run vaccination sites around country. sites get going still vaccinate 6,000 people day. Many units already started vaccinating folks definitely part increase % used overall increase seen. also taken personal steps expected leader reinforce trust vaccine. Biden took doses national TV actively encouraged people get whatever shot could turn. Trump secretly got vaccine January told one. points make, think 5 major things wanted point out. Please don’t let anyone convince good governance doesn’t matter. crucial lead us listen experts make best decisions info available. last 50 days serve reminder actually looks like.

I’ll also admit I’m missing big parts like deal Biden struck J&amp;J Merck, moving timeline shipments pharmacies, purchasing doses move timeline overall. Certainly someone skips queue, though loud enough heard Dancing public kills 7 grandmas day, believe. AZ selling profit anyway, unlike vaccines. countries purposefully tank public confidence vaccines biggest loser, far, country itself, AZ. politicians hide fact screwed ordering vaccines biggest loser, far, general public, vaccinated long time comparable western countries. Damn good. Silver u countries better us manufacturing capacity could (and was) built course vaccine development, tiny populations, made deals laws preclude government making—for example Israel centralized detailed medical records population went all-in, giving information Pfizer along buckets money, purchasing vaccine agreement country willing commit even moderate purchases

Trudeau saying we'd donate extra doses came international backlash Canada purchasing several times amount vaccines necessary inoculate population, continuing increase purchases specific vaccines showed evidence safe effective (e.g. increasing Pfizer/Moderna purchases). idea donating ""extra supply"" would result slower vaccine acquisition administration opposite expect—over-purchasing means earlier deliveries doses  ""Yes agree experimental. Anyway let's talk experimental vaccine"" News outlets sources can't provide (something goes right)

""The lockdowns worked!""

(something goes wrong)

""We need lockdown harder/longer!"" made comment another thread, outlines exactly Biden admin helped. 

No I’ll explain why.

In final days Trump admin, distribution horrendous communication around non-existent. States promised different amounts every day trouble planning whether use reserve shots gamble they’d enough 2nd rounds time came. fact bad, HHS even started telling states vaccines around January 20th. first things Biden admin smooth communication. immediately implemented plan tell states expect terms deliveries 3 weeks out. huge shift vaccine planning. sudden states could count arrival second doses freeing doses 1st shot. want proof this, look percent vaccines used change weeks following inauguration. went 50% near 80%. Biden admin took major steps increase cooperation states. includes steps terms partnering black brown churches distribute vaccines. groups among vulnerable skeptical vaccine. partnerships communication play huge role declining daily deaths. also signed orders allowing pentagon finally deploy troops help vaccinate. early February plans deploy least 1000 national guard members set run vaccination sites around country. sites get going still vaccinate 6,000 people day. Many units already started vaccinating folks definitely part increase % used overall increase seen. also taken personal steps expected leader reinforce trust vaccine. Biden took doses national TV actively encouraged people get whatever shot could turn. Trump secretly got vaccine January told one. points make, think 5 major things wanted point out. Please don’t let anyone convince good governance doesn’t matter. crucial lead us listen experts make best decisions info available. last 50 days serve reminder actually looks like. personally:

- sucks able see people's faces/smiles
- Harder understand people
- work keep face clean
- Something always remember leave house
- pain headphones
- Sorta dystopian looking
- Getting cold/flu every big deal Whatever do, solution come risk destroying trust vaccines. opinion, stopping early looking potential new complications trustworthy choice. rather unethical ignore new potential risks continue hope everything turns false alert. doesn't, damage done lot worse. makes guys feel better, us strictly vehemently following guidelines ragging friends going ignore reality vaccines working. still one people, point compromise things start easing back normal. Whatever may disagree otherwise, agree guys things getting better time start easing back regular life. Personally, want wear mask maybe mid/late summer feel people shot, that, I'm going probably stop wearing it. bad New York won’t allow Awesome! vaccines here, really last leg race--hunker down, paris pupperinos! got text February (no idea why. I'm 51 health issues know of). asked 50yo obese husband fit end day. pleased. call irrational, Ted. us two functioning brain cells know virus real *and* overblown. thanks analysis!  still hit 3 million yesterday regardless. Great stuff I'm saying, please take vaccine, vaccine, soon can, right?

But also pretty clear 100% severe infection protection even mRNA vaccines bunk.

Israel two half months serious lockdown American standards, population, much, much healthier Americans variety reasons.

All going effect vaccine efficacy rate US.

Be smart, even get shot.

Thank you. ""Month so"" 2 months, whatever, point still stands. I'd like mention sake fairness transparency, state centralized fashion like that. Everyone signs wait list using standardized web form state site, call text set appointment turn.  also text week let know lost track still queue.

There way state (aside standing line chance get leftover one end day) I'm really pissed pandemic misinformation seems like time high. nothing Biden. vaccination programs many countries would collpase come sudden stop. would one last authorities recommend thing, turns related vaccine. 93 year old grandmother hasn’t either. Riddle that.  agree. Millions dead, still thousands still dying every single day. 


Even assume extremely rare side-effect causing handful develop serious consequences, benefits vaccine would still significantly outweigh that. need prove wrong Yeah, makes sense. think relaxing general we'd end relaxing further. one lockdown sure. GA opening 4 new mass vaccination sites hopefully get gutter getting people vaccinated contribute increase numbers local cases. get cases within hotel quarantine every day acquired overseas. That's hotel quarantine. Yikes! trooper Sorry, allow self-promotion. Fauci caving 'big sticker' ;) 2% won’t effect hospitals? Admit it, Trump still president, everybody else would giving zero credit. Trust less for.... not.... accounting non-trustinf idiots trusting them. Bit self fulfilling prophecy there, think?

I sure mean by: ""After one kicked trust less"". saying trust government comply, due actions pandemic got worse, getting worse trust government more? better test description ""bike fall"" meme, seen it. mean, unequivocally concerning, pretending otherwise help anybody. There's actual verifiable scientific proof concerning. question remains answered concerned need be. blip radar, something prolong pandemic?

I personally think mild concern worst, need data come actual conclusion. ends arriving due vaccines that’s science end. social end. Suggesting people overwhelming influence use power encourage others get vaccinated literal definition public health advocacy. way country opens up. Removing comment chain derailed off-topic politics. Amusing, since enormous percentage life saving drugs come China... people don’t realize doesn’t hurt though rise blood clots vaccinated group vs non vaccinated population, however Norway, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Austria Netherlands state reactions need investigated closely. Might wanna tag specific countries ... reason to. number blood clots vaccinated people general population. hope work means. Literally every living former president went camera promote getting vaccine. okay finding places air Sorry, appear misinformed CCP propaganda. Taiwan country. amount lying change that. accept won’t hit herd immunity vaccinated people want Wearing N95s long period time hard. properly fitted, 0% leakage. allow FB social media type influence weather get vaccine not.  I'd rather wait time facts come vs people throwing said said nonsense Yup, companies already based country helps - throw enough money AZ, GSK etc one likely pull need. without local infrastructure harder

To clear, I'm saying happened without pharma companies based UK... helps lot already relationship, local infrastructure supply lines etc Oregon seems alright far. appointment scheduled end month, I'm 50 severe asthma  might missing reading report explained decision taken. not, about? theory vaccine increases amount blood clots, causes small amount severe blood clot cases (combined low platelets).. necessarily show statistics.

That question. vaccine ""causes"" severe side effect, cause rate statistically distinguishable unvaccinated population, effectively cause side effect meaningful way. matter side effect sniffle head exploding. fact, want say actually ""causes"" side effect, statistically distinguishable way, also essentially argue replacement. say, 1 million chance dying blood clot taking particular vaccine, also 1 million chance dying blood clot taking vaccine, certain vaccine causing blood clot directly, must also preventing number blood clots order offset additional numbers still balances out.

This say researched, case confounding factor would make much likely subset population (like perhaps drug interaction), macro level reason stop overall administration mean time, given known risks *not* vaccinated. Possible, unlikely. Occam's Razor play. simplest explanation vaccine symptoms. Bay Area don’t see people outside without mask full stop peak “Really? fuck 2020?” Ironically lower vaccination rates Europe mostly caused AstraZeneca delivering 25% target. much bigger hit vaccination effort temporary stop ever cause. Vaccinations EU mostly done Biontech anyway, seems like capable procuring large quantities great public trust. guys actual idiots? Science viruses don’t care feelings. always side caution uncertainty field anything happen. Remember last year warned everyone like “yeah right”. Shocker right? It’s job say absolutes extremely optimistic. virus isn’t going away, it’ll subdued. likely hood it’ll become another seasonal flu deal with. It’s still prevalent dangerous regardless vaccine rollout hit critical numbers vaccinated. mean fulfilled promise us yet either. EU countries even want AZ. Stop crying it. You’re part social class stayed home took pandemic seriously. Pretty much coworkers, family friends, took seriously stayed home. one office, WFH since last March restaurant since 2020. 

Of course depending living may surrounded people go work contact people day maybe didn’t stay home result. college took away spring break year get 16 weeks zoom hell early tell, really, probably nothing. OK, point taken. good evening. Yeah south koreans seem moronic many americans turned be. World Health Organization European Medicines Agency said reason pause vaccination 

I'm confused, recommending pause vaccinating AZ vaccine? teach state relaxed rules regarding COVID. means rest country. Lol seem awfully triggered concerned. Maybe take breath there, buddy. government isn’t concerned temperature.. hostess Applebee’s wants damn job minimize staff members’ risk sit eat meal. 

The government easily find whatever wants needs anyone.. vaccination status temperature nothing need hide freak big brother knowing 🙄 74 million racists, liberal means satanic rapist  seems backward anything. set benefit farmers iirc. makes sense time we're winter *maybe* rolling back months summer since sun set time get pretty late northern states. Really, that's necessary either sun rises earlier peak sunlight days well change much. 36k USA cases today? God hope find 20 years covid damages developing brains, goes dormant resurfaces later like chicken pox herpes.

I understand think kids need protected. Death risk here, there's lot know does. followers believe pandemic first place lol Europe isn’t EU 99% chance losing lottery someone could tell first two numbers play, would ignore them? California good look compare since many regions *ignored* governor fully open anyways. source says otherwise: Luckily, loud minorities. normal people fall squarely ""once I'm fully vaccinated, I'm prepared life return normal."" Residents $250,000 eligible Florida Played gig couple years ago. Got interact bit. nice sweet anyone ever met. Isn’t people think? care loved ones hell lot anyone else lmao Europe botching vaccine roll out. lag far behind US, UK, Chile, Israel.  I'm Virginia. Thanks tip! I'll check FB Exactly. know convince 30% want take vaccine take it? Tell ""you go back 100% normal worries anymore."" Translation "" still want relevant "" effective B-117, B-117 much obnoxious original SARS-CoV-2. Higher severity, much higher transmission. B-117 could kill *a lot* people next half-year mass vaccine.  Flu US would equate 80 people per day. Same, I’m 30 even past year way better teens early 20s I’m convinced “I’m wearing mask forever” code “I’m really fucking insecure appearance” Florida, fight crocodile it. That’s interesting, thanks sharing! wonder people affected vaccine mild thrombocytopenia didn’t know it, vaccine agitated it. That’s excellent point, bet commercial real estate investors mainly pushing this. money tied office buildings don’t want loose ass. School free daycare parents especially single mothers website. prevent infection transmission?

We know whether vaccine prevent infection protect onward transmission. Immunity persists several months, full duration yet known. important questions studied. 

In meantime, must maintain public health measures work: masking, physical distancing, handwashing, respiratory cough hygiene, avoiding crowds, ensuring good ventilation.” Downvoted sharing actual important information lol. People want told everything ok Extremely unlikely. slim chance getting first place. extremely slim chance strong symptomatic infection. fine. It’s getting slim odds. You’ll fine. Still propagates belief Manaus 70% seroprevalence Non zero, close zero. Extremely low worth worrying knew things getting ""back normal"" couple weeks ago walmart discovered started receipt checks again. mother nursing home hit 1 year ago. 40+ deaths.  quickly, locked place.  staff wear full PPE day long. 9 months later finally let 1 day week, 30 minute visit, full PPE. declared imminent allowed daily basis. 

Masks suck especially wear day. 80% population vaccinated, virus continue infect people mutate even worse mutations. Idk what’s flu usually per day? one gives shit amount it’s probably magic number

Edit
After googling looks like 150-200 day depending year. sounds right informative made immediately think US governors prematurely (and dare say ignorantly) remove mask mandates. Yes, small chance catching isn’t enough reason, still spread too. vaccines basically eradicate serious infection - hospitalization death - could still catch spread others aren’t can’t get vaccinated there’s still studies doen efficacy newer strains. yes, masks still necessary time being. research support argument? Sure, citizens behaved badly. mean majority did. Well, I'm gainfully employed, things enjoy currently closed pandemic thats that. Glad invested comment history. 120,407,530 past mark Vaccine side effects work way. vaccine gone days remains immune response. autoimmune conditions side effects vaccines either happen 2 months don't. also people literally never Asian country I'm really scratching head explanation Oslo vaccine. Three people previously healthy simultaneously develop rare, almost contradictory condition. Even without countries suspect hell would immediately stop trial *long* investigation.

If alternate explanation...what it? Eligible May 1, vaccinated. It’ll probably take another month two May 1 get everyone vaccinated, hopefully restrictions mostly gone May 1 anyway declining case numbers. imagine best world anything still good person Yo-yo is? imagine world would like us like him? state? Houston, sign county, city, one several hospital chains, pharmacy chains, think 2-3 organizations. one individually best, centralized system would much convenient people use smartphones internet much. sub cesspool year lmao you’re really asking pass COVID vaccine injection people, even clarified you’re hermit anyway another comment FFS dude. could find article Florida talking it. called around put waitlists across multiple don’t think health safety others inconvenience US primary care system could handled vaccinations, states thought better hand pharmacies, vaccinate intermittently previously staffing significant numbers vaccinations. Congrats lottery! It's... open. dual citizen enter countries land border. literally nothing stopping you. doesn’t mean last 6 months, means “we information durability protection”. Could 6 months, could 6 years, could 6 decades.  


Will likely need sort booster road, quite possible. going die 6 months jab juice doesn’t work anymore...unlikely. Yes we’ve 3 lockdowns, 4th, 5th, 6th lockdowns  made point. 

Okay, point also dual citizen need point fingers.

And relevant because? Gas stations always low mask usage areas. 

Even rural area south ga people masked, still are, store, *except* gas stations. Probably thinking ""I'm running right quick"" chance fully vaccinated person (3 weeks since 2nd shot) could still get pass you? Provided still kept distance mask? *Laughs despairingly Texan* Literally nobody thinks vaccines, lunches, anything else spring thin air literally free. think people concerned insurance works. deeply sincerely hope rise cases doesn’t happen that. idea point won’t, certainly hope not. Niccceeeee!! Thank information! I'll pass along sister! Also, thank friends family getting vaxxed! Jesus Christ relax. made point, throwing fit?

I'm also dual citizen point fingers. know me. see freedom end tunnel. ... comparable *un*vaccinated people. snowbirds headed north already? Holy shit. y'all'll done next month? ""Liberal covid guidelines!? America!""

-Republicans probably I’d disagree...between manpower Military, Ready Reserve tbat could recalled service crisis, Veteran’s Administration, Federal Government LOT resources available put shots arms manpower-wise.

However, it’s even people give injections. It’s using FEMA coordinate agencies across Federal, State, Local spectrums. It’s management logistics helping set mass vaccination sites. There’s LOT Federal Government could Trump admin literally said “fuck it...states, vaccines coming...sometime. We’re sure. get it, you’re own.” like Memorial Day unless California New York. July 4th worst case scenario point. know. white house source confirmed right cpac. secret.  I’m going debate lockdown pros cons, say it’s surprises people can’t maintain quarantine year. It’s asking almost much. know won’t become long term issue vaccinated people? would Hearns make post Hagler hospital fighting vaccine side effects died? even said, “he’ll fine could use positive energy prayer full recovery!” Seems odd say howdy. post comment removed suitable r/coronavirus.

Investigations performed. don’t know definitively, probably cold-like symptoms I’m getting tired jabs US. It’s like it’s place struggled contain COVID-19 hold line public health measures, anti-vax sentiment uniquely American. Things turning around watching things unfold Israel gives hope US vaccination campaign yield similar results. Cheers Israelis, let’s hope success story replicated around world! comment article it’s English. say it’s long virus get over. seems average time feel better 3-4 months. think people expect quick recovery that’s Covid works. obvious bullshit poll obvious, literally go outside tell looks like people following restrictions nonsense. AstraZeneca's contract EU specifically allows supply British plants. better 
""we're money........ *mogs ears rise anticipation* .....WE'RE SHIT LOAD MONEY"" speech? exactly made? article pretty bad explaining actually done.

Walmart pharmacies. live city Yes last Queensland Perth lockdowns felt like over-reactions since clearly tied border. NZ locked twice recently clear border link UK strain. multiple border failures, one involving South African variant, lock knew index case clear border link. won’t get vaccine passports. dummies die it’ll killed first night. rocked Well done NHS! amount organizing make happen impressive! correct. take example, acute myocardial infraction, aka mini heart attacks, original safety study pfizer actually found ""The common serious adverse events vaccine group numerically higher placebo group appendicitis (7 vaccine vs 2 placebo), acute myocardial infarction (3 vs 0), cerebrovascular accident (3 vs 1)."" going see, based study, acute myocardial infractions. 3 20,000 (how many vaccine group) = .00015 every 100k see 15 acute myocardial infractions certainly small percentage people die it. Lol give break.... It’s happening now.

(Since asked.) One great thing he’s added FEMA sites. There’s also coordination transparency states. likely would gotten somewhat better Biden competent team AstraZeneca hardly delivered anything last weeks. doses stay shelf. approved start vaccinating again, massive overcapacity administer doses  Thank J&amp;J! 86 year old grandpa got vaccine wouldn’t kick house. You’re salty 😂 applied university fall 2021 really hope able normal classes Looks like I'll holidaying within UK summer then. going make jokes funny. pandemic almost Three different webpage translators. Even body translation states ""coronary artery disease"". Try finding link English post majority people sub read it. That's interesting way saying ""cases steadily declining week week"" Check cdc vax site. shows percentage adults fun look every day post-christmas peak Ireland. ""Hey Mom, sorry I'm coming grams birthday stupid idea want get sick. idea it, that's business, mine. I'll catch next time.""

It flies everywhere start standing yourself, slave people want do. vaccines primarily deployed UK? Quite weekend!!! little chunk adult population right  „Ihr seid doch Spinner.” 41 here. Got email yesterday I’m presently sitting vaccine center another.... 4mins 23secs. Life good! vaccine distribution terrible. variants outpacing vaccine new information better share it. not, add sentiment 'they went fast, check enough, I'm going get vaccine'. literally said ' moeten altijd het zekere voor het onzekere nemen ' opinion true. always measure risks real risk hurting vaccination effort, leading thousands extra deaths (in Holland) compared couple cases thrombosis. nil risk COVID, put risk unproven vaccine others. Nobody ask somebody risk life another. Life's tough, rough, unfair, concerned whatever social rules we've written time terms soften blows people, treat everyone equally.

This warning shot, we're lucky that's was. Imagine MERS level deadly, COVID level contagious. worse.

Hopefully people understand need world governments prepared, point, electing infantile children idea (or capacity) handle something like this. 

Climate change ensure see another one lifetime. one tough you, next time worse? say, videos feverish struggling breathe photo op funniest moments 2020 current vaccine distribution Biden’s work. seeing result ordering previous administration. would rarely hear people here. article mentions single patient connected ECMO machine already vaccinated two doses.

so severe. think point. Sure, suck! suck lot less consequences *not* wearing them. ""Of 41 patients connected ECMO machine - 82%, 34 people - vaccinated. Seven patients received one dose vaccine, single patient connected ECMO machine already vaccinated two doses.

Of 41 pregnant women women given birth hospitalized virus, 92% vaccinated. Two women received one vaccine dose, another woman received two vaccine doses, less week passed since infected virus. means pregnant women currently hospitalized virus, single one vaccinated."" 

That's particularly important note could literally go Fox tonight say single patient connected ECMO machine already vaccinated two doses.

this part article actual amazing stuff Unlike mitigations, taking slightly less safe vaccine would risk individual mostly. restrictions limits gatherings feel like taking risk like laws drinking driving. It’s personal risk case. That’s don’t see connection mahbe blame politicians fucking things up. EU capable handling chose  many people CPAC use CPAP sleep apnea unless 36m exceeded, means we've got 48m doses Pfizer Moderna alone coming August 1 September 30—cause total order 84M 09/30 US export ban prevent pfizer meeting contractual obligation countries though 

I think Canadians Mexicans might beg differ.

J&amp;J delayed thanks fears EU produced doses can't filled US planned there's guarantee get blocked way back. ally are. Europe gets even behind... fact downvoted wild. big news. guess stop driving since emissions per passenger-kilometer drastically different two. fail biology? anatomy? Yeah lol r/collapse Let know happens. Next year senior year quite honestly, keep restrictions us next school year, I’m going listen. already took much kids age, vaccine completely available public become matter people taking risks.  Lol believe Biden anything it. Vaccination rates already accelerating Trump. Vice versa It’s pause assess issue. don’t think Austria, Denmark, Ireland, Netherlands, Italy Ireland irrational. really prudent. I’m gonna honest, Covid insignificant kids young people can’t accept anything less normal school fall. can’t. I’m okay people disagree this, can’t stand parents actively keeping perfectly healthy child school Covid concerns. That’s unreasonable.  seems like every time people's expectations exceeded, they're moving goalposts. bought six different vaccines hedging bets work out—and Sanofi's dud, *most them* work (who thought even one would?). second line Moderna 3rd 4th Pfizer. delivered doses March going millions expected timeline able willing adults vaccinated gone end year, September, sometime September.

1.5 years health measure introduction full inoculation willing able adults absolutely amazing me. thought would take longer develop vaccine, let alone test, manufacture, distribute administer several. put Trudeau, he's figurehead masses people working tirelessly get done. think parties would similar results yeah agree hardly surprising vaccine experimental extremely rare side effects (pfizer IIRC, clue rest) nothing heart disease. possible since virus badly affects people diabetes, lots people undiagnosed diabetes finding it? vaccine found. Telephone poles probably owned Zuckerberg he's banned posting well. main things Biden team brought table organization focus. still plenty scientists bureaucrats good work Trump administration seeing great results good people working Trump laid foundation current success last year.  


However, lot good people work ground level lot chaos upper levels Trump administration. observer could see Trump focused election, November 3rd, Covid.  


Take something simple like Trump's vaccination. easy score him, inviting press watch get vaccinated could encourage people get vaccinated scoring political points touting government's role helping vaccine development distribution. event never happened people even find Trump vaccinated months after. Trump focused trying overturn election fighting covid, unfortunate American people Republican party. many doses purchases made Trump administration, messaging mixed one give credit.  


Biden, hand, made covid priority generally stayed partisan fray. administration done much biggest proponents might suggest, actually starting zero came in. able clean things bring order vaccine pipeline. executive branch can't make vaccines thin air, help organize connect millions moving parts, cutting red tape cutting checks necessary keep things moving. much one big thing countless mundane deals details add well-oiled pipeline. think opposite effect. vaccine stored away couple weeks. batch happens bad whatever reason, tens maybe even hundreds people die due thrombosis. would healthy person even risk getting vaccine chances becoming sick minimal anyway. 

We currently luxury position people want corona end obtaining 70% vaccination rate seems doable. happens bad batch stop time. Reaching 70% close impossible. 

Its convincing anti-vaxxers, ensuring rest wont jump ship. complaining taking risks. complaint getting made fun decide take 1 risk month, people go 24/7 365 whether we're pandemic not. coronary heart disease? punched translate web site failed, miserably. It’s 60% heart disease covid infection. Small gatherings? LOL. downvotes probably come people totally fed constant moving goal posts, especially away original goal flattening curve. sold on: let's lock down, hurt country economically hopefully slow disease.

And terrible surge November December part January.

But surge long over. curve flattened (well, flat.. free falling). Hospitals overwhelmed, vaccination rate, never overwhelmed again.

We've done set do, let's start returning life. Let's put goal posts back started. irony wouldve downvoted hell called anti masker saying different context. concerning part afflicted individuals sometimes uncharacteristically young blood clots decided stop using AZ it'd pointless that's main vaccine now. fail see irony? don’t opinion lockdowns (Also weren’t proper one can’t really say anything bad experience is) Dutch minister health says new evidence besides thrombosis. really really really pro-vax. bad thing study side effects putting everyones armes. South African variant highly prevalent Netherlands? People hard-on “Asian countries wearing masks” think adapt going disappointed. Im moreso complaining getting ridiculed trying minimize risks venture outside house. ridicule living like baboons thought virus all. feel need make fun me? long they’re enough sequencing testing availability remains high. actual title (as English) "" 60 percent coronary heart disease suffer side effects"".

It translates to:

A Norwegian study late effects coronary heart disease shows 60 percent become ill struggle late effects. Women often affected.

A Norwegian study 2,600 people shows startling findings regarding long-term effects covid-19 infection, reports TV 2. University Bergen, together University Hospital American researchers, conducting study.

- saw patients six months, saw 60 percent long-term problems. saw many ages 16 30 difficulty concentrating, problems breathing memory loss, says Professor Rebecca Cox University Bergen channel.

The study Bergen shows women struggle late effects.

- reinforces said along covid-19 like regular flu, fact still say. must added significant number late effects, says head department professor Department Emergency Medicine Dag Jacobsen Oslo University Hospital. What's see? Vaccines end game. playing rules before. word phrase ""A black cat went past us another look like it."" Yep. Get in! California made big issue shutdown beaches summer. hundreds protesting, Newsom caved. stop opening cases fall further. rate they're falling, we'll probably hit 0 like 3 years. still severe disease vaccinated people. bit vague extent. time Israel release decent result severe disease vaccinated vs. unvaccinated, e.g. Kaplan-Meier curves, normalized age group size. data, need type lines code. think scientists know doing, think underestimate level risk people willing take

This literally motto people anti lockdown. haha irony Let's actually get cases first

European, part European Union project... distinct difference. No, British one tho pretty big red patch arm shot Friday, warm used kids forehead thermometer 101.1°F. painful I'm worried it. Underrated comment. currently vaccinating old people 30+ even 50+? Also, risk ""healthy"" younger people become severely sick still percent, pull through. UK de facto export ban, vaccines produced locations delivery obligation UK first, addition AZ contract obligates AZ well delivering 100m UK first exporting anything UK supply chain. 

People saying UK export ban conveniently ignoring fact way producing vaccines UK without obliged deliver vaccines UK first. export banned private contracts instead explicit law.  US, move along. Okay, UK starts exporting 100% vaccines ot produces EU. 2025 everyone EU gets first dose. 2029 everyone second. Nothing stopping pharma companies setting production UK exporting 100% vaccines, hence export ban. Masks ? Hopefully June. social distancing measures law dropped 21st June. Border quarantine? Depends well world tbh, us. know people started scoff suggestions public health officials experts may indeed want push appear pessimistic stay spotlight. 

The thing talking handful - Pandemic brought forward every health official *every region* *every level* government *everywhere.* 

Consider fact may well time many people care say. Now, can't assume narcissists heart make assumptions character like them, totally conceivable *all* them, must *some* like like public eye. Large, albeit earned salaries would play factor well sure. Yeah, bit half gotten one dose. That's far ""vast majority"".

And like people think restrictions alone responsible mental health issues not, know, millions people dying.

I know, man. insane. Maybe people US finally able go experience semblance normality, like since spring-summer 2020
(Yes know didn’t say exactly joke) Well EU much choice point. Thanks PR campaign AZ vaccine, Europeans take anyway. guess plan. politicians convince people want AZ vaccine blame EU commission securing enough. Trump sucks don’t recall ever doubting vaccine Currently 18s unless they've got condition makes vulnerable though... one started suggesting conspiracies secret agendas here. Something also weird many weird blood clotting cases several countries last 10 days young people mid 30's 40's. AZ vaccination. sort clustering blood clots havent seen Pfizer vaccine example.

Considering UK mostly vaccinated 65+ AZ would think would *more* cases blood clotting sort population nada. Makes question whether something wrong latest batch delivered EU blood blot issues happened tied vaccination, somehow prevalent younger cohort.

Don't forget AZ trials complete shit show could pick blood clot issues. AZ export doses UK. wont UK take cleaners breach contract.

Why EU take AZ cleaners breach contract make sure company never gets business EU single market again? we're betting patch release every year too. right. reminds end infinity war, thanos sits smiles distance.. shoot tbh new cases related outbreak Ursus Fitness, gym

But assured sub gyms quite safe! Yeah should, since got vaccine January, many news sources covered it. Also Michigan. Proudly representing whole Northern USA!

LA County = death rate 0.377%
Orange C. = death rate 0.140% means effective export ban, matter UK says. Can't stay locked forever Yeah, do. got letter week vaccination. people believed people caused America put warnings plastic bags. contributed yesterday. got slight headache fever. I'm sure they'll gone tomorrow. volunteer vacicnators already given many shifts due high uptake enough supply. shortage people willing administer vaccine, supply. Got it!

EU fucking joke. surely continue give jab given evidence does, 

They gotten AstraZeneca vaccine. mean that's cause, unlikely either. evidence trials, doses given far cases usual


I know become prevalent. relevant. shocking people sub places even make effort understand. 


The problem specific cases severe unusual, might caused vaccine. feel people freedom masks summer (as opposed wearing much school now), hard time justifying enforcing masks come fall, especially high school. ya see stats (at least USA) majority people 65 received vaccine? Cause people actually get affected.  Yeah, neither party particularly close liberal classical definition feel people freedom masks summer (as opposed wearing much school now), hard time justifying enforcing masks come fall, especially high school. lol playing devils advocate, even clots caused vaccine, you’re still likely struck lightning effected. Hardly grave danger it. didn’t get it, they’re still living shadow , morgues lot less full

I’ve found there’s difference truly ignorant people wear masks go lives . live town full people trying escape nonsense elsewhere. would expect increase point. think it'll interesting see limit reached terms demand finally overtaken supply. feel like get around 50% adults first dose first dose number actually start dropping. ah ok get you, bad. That's bad machine translation. say mean COVID-19 elsewhere article. severe symptoms loss taste smell exist, get virus getting three vaccines currently available U.S.? can’t read yo-yo without thinking Kramer’s head injury lol Poetic isn’t it?  Britain true litmus test well vaccination curbs viral spread.

As today 24,196,211 (or 45% UK adult population) received first dose COVID vaccine. There's speculation receive shitload new vaccine supplies therefore UK adult population could potentially receive first dose 31st May.

Kids returned school 8th March 12th April earliest non-essential retail, outdoor leisure facilities beer gardens re-opened. 17th May plan re-open indoor restaurants pubs rule 6 active, also relax social distancing rule 30 outdoors, June 21st plan lift social distancing restrictions. \~0.8% mortality rate. What's point? Society grind halt years come?  I’ve thinking too, particularly re: LA area. believe mostly identified local variant unconnected Kent Manaus ones knows. would think could analyze thousands positive tests month half ago get better sense this. evidence children don’t transmit Covid rate. 

Hopefully thread isn’t filled people claiming science wrong catch unrelated viruses children, like others topic. Head local city/state sub you’ll probably find tbh got first shot today mass-vaccination site. nurse told they're giving 5,000 shots day now! Amazing.

ETA: I'm US, UK. EU exported 9 million doses Pfizer/BioNTech's vaccine UK, UK refuses allow AstraZeneca send vaccines UK EU. Interestingly, was. 100 million 300 million 1/3 Finger crossed still looks like variations lead slower drop rather increases great news. misread original comment So... go ""the science"" (in quotation marks science behind selective lockdowns), going numbers above, hard lockdowns result 7% decrease deaths (not accounting obvious differences like much older population - 20.5% age 65+ FL, 14.3% CA). mention Florida better 26 states various forms mandates lockdowns. too!  anyone know would prove blood clots caused vaccine? said doesnt matter age small time frame. Thats worrying statistics, probability 37 yo die blood clot 0.000xx number. happened 6 people time, probability happening randomly number multiplied 6 times itself. small small number!

So lets look point point. six 37 years olds die claimed 37 youngest age 6 people died? Details important.

When say probability 37 year old die blood clot 0.000xx mean exactly? mean probability given 37 year old die blood clot week? Id shocked high, frankly. xx medium 5-0 would 10s thousands people mid late thirties dying blood clots every week EU. mean per year, still hundreds given week. mean?

Also cant find data points look unusual vast sea data say QED trying to. Thats well known mistake. wikipedia entry it. notice example used extremely similar one well known examples also. quite similar conversation. I’m one 3.2 million got yesterday! get Daddy's permission post reply? ;) Last good Smith movie Headline downplaying study, found 60% tested positive(!) long-term effects. Literacy challenge, huh? worst hit country vaccines way mess created.

The vaccination rescue mission would lot quicker FDA acted excellent Phase 4 data UK. could still save lives spacing vaccine intervals releasing AZ stockpile arrogance prevents happening. ""If eat meat, can't pudding!"" Amogus would define authoritarian? statement antibody levels comes already known based phase 2 safety Immunogencity data picking steam, US vaccinated 11% population. Ya'll acting like almost done. Astrazeneca said apply EUA US, likely approved next month. way US Government give doses paid for, intended citizens. Also, Canada pay doses, US did. i’m sure it’s states faking numbers, truly possible explanation Same. workout 6 days week like, days muscle soreness combined one 1-inch area arm. Oooof.

Lots opportunities there! Use resources find. enjoy yours. that's want. want e with. bad feel same. Saying 4th highest deaths super disingenuous. also one populous states country. deaths per capita they're around 26th 27th better average. state oldest population vulnerable population US big accomplishment Policy matters messaging matters well. late March 2020 still supporting full mask usage: Point proven, thanks Despite religious, country (Belgium) got hit worse US Brazil.

For sure population density weather play role government made still makes many mistakes. list endless.

Czechia, Slovenia, UK, Hungary Italy also worse US. Apart Italy, none countries known ""imbecile, selfish anti-science religious people""...

Countries well Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, New Zealand even China pretty well. massive surge post election, talking about? blank last three months? No. I'm quite selfish you. Wear mask stop scummy. UK experienced TE's Pfizer vaccine neither higher would expect general population. Makes wonder going on. Whooo... bbc article. ""Anger, outrage"" Sucks already leveling cases instead declining. testing method revised post election indicating dramatic drop worldwide.

IF true, would seen dramatic drop case numbers, hospitalization &amp; death numbers remaining same. seen places case numbers dropping, followed hospitalization death numbers dropping similar level couple weeks later... expect change testing, expect change actual cases.

Also numbers necessarily dropping everywhere, dropped places 1 3 reasons, spring starting end traditional flu/cold season, increased phase 2 measures, Canada much country partial lockdowns since December! (that straight Christmas Easter without able non family member house), places like America, fast vaccine programs. valid reasons. virus isn’t deadly enough force mandatory vaccination people. /r/nextfuckinglevel should, won't. was/is failure leader. got vaccine secret. base weakened get vaccine, party well future. Welcome back spring, like call it, “COVID allergies?” season! sickest person getting treatment every country guaranteed sicker least sick person we’re treating right now. don’t need equally. aren’t nearly enough healthy 18 year olds living cancer patients America make redistributive scheme work. 

Did miss point saying entirely understand reply think disagreeing me. also saying doses destined healthy 18 year olds living cancer patients America would solve vaccine shortages places. 


I following example provided person replied highlighting ideal give vaccine healthy 18 year old lives cancer patient giving cancer patient themselves. You’re either quibbling thousand doses idea far reaching implications recommendation are. 

I'm proposing anything. I'm saying less ideal.   this. name single resource distribute way you’re proposing distribute vaccine (globally, according need) I’ll concede point isn’t batshit insane. 

My point less ideal healthy 18 year old person lives cancer patient get vaccinated actual cancer patient. I'm proposing anything, I'm saying inevitable due sad state world (nation states acting self-interest ideal solution global). 


If explain inability point resource distributed universal manner nation states makes point view things way batshit insane I'll concede response completely moronical. even mean? Based what? countries given huge amounts vaccine happened, could ""easily"" happen? strange line thinking people, like they're looking excuse stop using vaccine pandemic evidence contrary somehow count. UK basically zero vaccine production capacity COVID. true. CSL/Seqirus GSK two biggest vaccine manufacturers world.

I personally worked vaccine manufacture COVID, UK largest lines world.

We absolute world experts pharmaceuticals reason excelling; give big credit NHS government rollout. (Despite much praising government time pains me) blood clots already co-morbidity covid anyway? one compare natural rate target population.

But, honest, look UK they've already vaccinated millions people without problems. check [the original HHS document right ctrl+f ""malign"" find smoking gun, deserves quoted full: Health Cooperation U.S. Humanitarian Leadership  malign influences Americas**: OGA used diplomatic relations Americas region mitigate efforts states, including Cuba, Venezuela, Russia, working increase influence region detriment US safety security.

Thanks posting enjoy silver! think mucosal immunity different conversation.

I think pertinent scope conversation given type protection induced natural infection respiratory viral infection, mindful factors comparison natural vs vaccine induced immunity 

 current vaccines shown incredibly efficacious. 

Indeed. disputing that, study supports view. also seen studies existing vaccines administered Intranasally vs intramuscularly indication Intranasal route good superior, that's especially intriguing context coming closer 'sterilising immunity', blocking chance progression LRT, lung reducing onward transmission. Here's one example; 
 Vaccinations offer longer lasting immunity compared natural infection

I presume talking covid specifically since know yet account vaccines existing long, instead speaking general. Could link source Also, everyone fights infection develop antibodies all

 True people do. average seroconversion rate iGG iGM 90-100% Even across studies asymptomatic seroconversion without neutralization capabilities people mild symptoms, somewhat moot imo study refers *only* detectable antibodies (and everyone vaccinated produce sufficient antibodies infected necessarily mean fight future infection easily. 

True, goes vaccines. Broadly speaking, vast majority people infected vaccinated previously fight future infection easily. That's really immune system tends work Irrespective whether immune system primed needle still take study grain salt,

Why? Im confused, there's nothing really controversial here, decent quality study. 

 really shown vaccines give stronger immunity natural infections.

Could link source that's shown? Preferably scientific source talking head CNN stated it. seen decent evidence relation sars cov 2. referring vaccines/diseases guess counts would slightly less helpful Unthinkable atlanticists european elite would rather people die admit russia made working vaccine.

The european elites also dipping quietly dubai private jets get chinese russian vaccines DL denying people think one part adulthood nobody tells kid (to discourage trying make difference, obviously still can) dependent behavior others.

I know tons things excited right ton good news right now, can’t help melancholy about... people... days. Nothing wrong it.

There higher incidence blood clots amongst people Pfizer vaccine Astrazenica one.

But lower incidence amongst general population, ridiculous fannies it. wonder many people sub would think public health experts came said, ""Isolation good mental health, everyone must spend 7 hours day others house?"" Would agree shame people stayed home? next excuse?

You started cherry-picking data trying engage bad-faith argument.

The excuse explanation – epidemiologist, trying offer insight might influence development pandemic. I'm merely pointing cherry-picking data points shoehorning arguments support them, that's disingenuous best.

You argued California deaths Sweden population density, comparing Jordan – again, based population density. point population density country area useless metric – many factors impact – population age structure, living condition, social behaviors, more.

Not mention whole fact entire argument started consider California's strategy 25 people per square km California 97 per square kilometre. people may different thresholds feel safe

And opinions completely fucking worthless don’t know shit infectious disease. many 500+ people died virus year think felt like perfectly safe? right. Florida covid death rate 148 per 100,000 vs Calinfornia 143 per 100,000. somehow florida, population density 1.5x higher california, much older population, managed pretty damn close deaths, without kind major shut downs. I'm circle jerking desantis, I'm circle jerking actual statistics show Florida decent job compared many states. California's unemployment rate 3 points higher Florida's well. Alligator. 

There maybe 2,000 crocodiles Florida. 1.3 million alligators It’s wording. “I know it’s party here, but...” come it. It’s condescending, that’s people downvoting. aunt who's prison guard AL.  
She's full Q, believe virus even real. Posts crazy stuff day.  
Would really suck watch. Everywhere go think also shows influential music be. speech near powerful without score behind it. experience people wanting choose Pfizer/Moderna versus J&amp;J usually solid reason. People wanting choose Pfizer Moderna usually (only seen one valid reason far). know variants everyone likes dismiss “fear mongering”? infectious. means tier system metrics designed original strain aren’t going enough something like UK strain. I’m going see excess death calculations Texas. It’s hard believe state death numbers fear state may necessarily follow guidelines reporting/determining covid deaths. would incentive companies based EU then. want deals host country.

Most agreed US export ban. Trump added end December, well qfter qll deals made. 

Also question answer yours. UK funded partialy AZ plants, yet even deliver promise UK rely EU.  data based on? UK vaccinated 20 million people seen less blood clots among vaccinated AZ jab alternatives like Pfizer. Neither occurrences expect compared general population. try calling another location? got thing called around got it. Also try calling place different time. Ok, let’s call Night Living Dead... oh shit, double fuck! Haha PCR test cycle times reduced resulted drop cases, we're also seeing fairly similar drops hospitalizations deaths. Since deaths lagging indicator 3 weeks look drop cases 3 weeks ago compared deaths today get rough idea effect change testing protocol reported cases. case previous testing protocol led many false positives, change fact millions people died worldwide. anything would stress importance mitigations would mean covid may contagious thought, much deadly thought. I'd rather second dose perfectly fine vaccine, thanks. that. love fact choice. agree. go talk Coronavirus literally anywhere else Sub people still think theres going restrictions 2022. got told wearing ""rose colored glasses"" suggesting think 3 months away taking masks. sub, I'd chewed far conservative estimate returning normalcy. People need accurate info hope again. Probably 80% elderly homes dead. Don’t let kind bullshit excuse people like Cuomo, Whitmer, Murphy, Newsome Wolf did. They’re murderers endangered vulnerable people COVID political gain. 
LOCK! THEM! UP! Fuck oh, one special people. 

have fun reality buddy. #SUS! strict lockdown states worse outcomes states opening up? Interesting. new job made eligible, something wasn’t expecting. get jabbed Moderna tomorrow. elated. 

I severe anxiety. pandemic nearly killed me. panic attacks every little “symptom.” Pestering partner, asking constantly felt okay. Constant worrying everyone else life doing. Wanting cry people around, previous years made huge strides socially. It’s hell. 

It’s going huge relief go visit parents take bus walk crowded store without fear. I’ll still mask people vaccinated, internally, I’m done. cannot wait grab drink works hang vaccinated friends.

The EU commission dropped ball big time, end day. blame game necessary they'd done better job. compared states like Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire. Cant choose dude, dinner menu checked, they're decreasing lot either. even then, said certain places NY they're rising

And EVEN THEN, one state wrong rest isnt bad. point still covid real variants. need take long walk short pier encouraging need revisit southern hemisphere variants become dominant summer.

“Next generation” means it’s offshoot current vaccine.

We tend celebrate we're vaccinating hell population, know there's end sight. ""rEmEmbEr yEt"" messaging new, novel, helpful. sort infantilizing repetition obvious fact grates. 

If majority saying ""you know, I'm getting shot another month two yet, golly gee I'm gonna go tonight without mask swap spit every stranger meet cases falling fast!"", I'd say sure, reminder would helpful. vast majority aren't.

 Rich elderly family members die death tax like what, 50%? 

 God forbid generationally stolen wealth go collective US budget Pfizer not. 2 weeks... spike /s Zombie Bot.

Google Sahin Bundesverdienstkreuz. That’s messed dude thought trying third shot booster... makes sounds like completely made new vaccine require two more. lot people turned Moderna due larger side effect profile. would preferred Pfizer since covers new variants. even put new officers/deputies corrections duty period time field work.

Wow sounds awful, like training police treat public like convicted criminals. nursing home new map? downvotes? I'm surprised activity Europeans. shouldn’t wait, able book website shit vaccine like idiocracy Cant agree more. fun googling finding it, post question find right Hi nursing home nurse here! I’m California yes, exactly said. Mandatory masks, visitors except cases end life. visitor dying patient, required wear mask, face shield, staff basically required rapid test prior entering building (we test door). Weekly covid tests mandatory employees. new admissions go one hall quarantine 14 days moving elsewhere finish therapy move permanent room they’re long term. one empty room case positive case haven’t yet. Also residents vaccinated. Every employee screened prior starting shift. 

However used work nursing home accepted covid positive patients rehab (a lot people don’t know skilled nursing facilities, assisted living, type nursing homes increased required level care nurses staff 24/7 also serve rehab facilities age ranges vary greatly length stay little days). shitshow imagine I’m aware. previously stated defending anything do, simply stating poster said fact export vaccine import others “all needed know” judge them. I’m surprised anti Vax position assumed healthcare professionals. It’s like everything scientific terms treating patients don’t faith it’s turn.

Yeah I’ve already got 1st shot Pfizer. don’t think would able get treatment time soon even complete vaccination. Ah well, it’s bad lot people going pandemic. governor Michigan literally paid people return gag orders. Wonderful example sources Reddit coronavirus science. comments Novavax trial SA? mean one third potential participants previously infected included trial? thoughts virus appears rampant SA. thought implications reinfection? None whatsoever.

No serious person doubts reinfection rare. rare question. elderly risk everything, though. old, many comorbidities one infection away death. humans place lot value keeping people alive long possible. Oklahoma essentially open, lot people interested getting vaccinated super easy see clinic going show wait excess vaccines. also following guidelines getting shots arms super concerned group clear appts covered. Go away think do. maybe unplug whatever propaganda listening to. elderly risk everything, though. old, many comorbidities one infection away death. humans place lot value keeping people alive long possible.

Europe massively helping well moment, needs legal action NI even improvement. EU stop vaccine shipment may get King Boris First - would probably look good armour, slowly slipped side horse resounding tinny clang. know there’s difference “scientists didn’t find evidence covid kids” “scientists found evidence covid kids”?

It’s kinda like that. Hey fellow Belgian! Dude, need step away computer get grip yourself. Feel free Google words ""unacceptable Pfizer"" find statement referenced different news site might prefer, rather trying deflect. Pretty sure English term. Dr. Peled Raz said temporary emergency law governing Israel’s response virus would easier amend regard health workers others potential harm patients, adding would justified.... “You want nurse won’t get vaccinated?” said. “Either get vaccinated choose another profession.”

This seems like common sense. Healthcare workers basically become vectors they’re vaccinated. sub always always obnoxious. I’m convinced half users trolling. guess. Anecdotally, know someone got blood clots 1 week taking astrazeneca vaccine Three strokes imprisons many non-violent crimes. profitable prison legal system US. Ah ok, im sorry. plenty deranged people actually believe (not sarcasm, actually do), thought one them. Sorry confusion realize ""masks need permanent"" sarcastic anti mask statement, right? Oh sweet summer child. thought serious? thought actually wanted wear masks forever, there's pandemic? Oh. adorable. *Pats little head* duration quality immunity vaccinations natural infections, know reading viruses SARS-CoV-2. I'd need put bit effort finding actual study. found site immunity the vaccine stronger natural immunity infection?

“The first time body sees spike protein, activates immune system cells begin recognize develop antibodies protein,” said Boslett. response may similar whether first encounter infection virus first dose vaccine.
Studies mRNA vaccines suggest one dose may offer 50 80 percent protection symptomatic COVID-19, though data needed, said Boslett. “We know get amount protection one dose vaccine infection virus, don’t know either case long protection lasts,” said. cases reinfection reported three six months, protection one dose vaccine also may wane timeframe.
“However, get second dose vaccine, you’re training immune system,” said Boslett. “You’re strengthening response antibody-producing B cells you’re also activating memory cells stick around much longer.” Getting doses vaccine means body shown spike protein multiple times short duration. “So immune response might bigger, better longer lasting getting infection one time,” said.
Because booster effect important, Boslett adds people COVID-19 still recommended get vaccine.
VERDICT: also seen studies existing vaccines administered Intranasally vs intramuscularly indication Intranasal route good superior, that's especially intriguing context coming closer 'sterilising immunity',

I remember big fan intranasal vaccines 😂

In clinical trials COVID-19 vaccines, sterilising immunity defined decreased likelihood detect viral RNA upper respiratory tract. said, important estimating effective vaccine preventing transmission. Pfizer's vaccine shown 94% efficacious sense recent real-world study Israel. published data intranasal vaccine efficacious Im confused, there's nothing really controversial here, decent quality study. 

I find controversial, *is* contradictory I've heard shown past. That's all. I'll wait see data maybe even read takes study make presume talking covid specifically since know yet account vaccines existing long, instead speaking general. Could link source that?

We know reinfections strain virus shown immunity lasts 3 6 months natural reinfection. Vaccines *expected* provide immunity much longer lasting.

Virtually fact free story....did symptoms vaccine? conditions may caused it, merely triggered vaccine? exactly symptoms long shot get them? Seeing Canada. bit crisis Pfizer move planned upgrade Puurs facility, couple weeks Pfizer deliveries, sucked, side upgrade, Pfizer Moderna filled 1st quarter delivery guarantees March alone, extras. rate cases stalling. Even drop hospitalizations slowing. Meanwhile, Germany ... Urgh US footing whole bill. developed countries [pre-ordered excess (which funds vaccine development giving researching institutions resources front), similar measures.

Don't get wrong, US global leader vaccine development manufacturing, ""America Alone"".

The US also engaged bit ""vaccine Nationalism"", [restricting vaccine caused bit hiccup vaccine supply Pfizer Canada, Pfizer planned fulfilling Canadian orders Kalamazoo facility back November, upgrade Puurs, Belgium facility produce enough vaccine doses fulfill non-US orders. guess short term, got vaccine available US faster, caused much angst Canada countries Puurs production curtailed short time. Long term, sounds like non-US capacity added compensate.

All US lift restrictions exports sooner rather later. December 2020 Executive Order complete ban, requires US orders filled vaccine allowed exported. original US orders 100 million doses Pfizer Moderna vaccines, IIRC, exports may happening soon unless options covered executive order. half chostochondritis meds, believe long Covid might had, something like that. could possibly suggest doc meds associated chosto try them, promise similar symptoms. friends Norway, medical field see much rare issues due population size. Figures still dropping though... Go figure. didn’t say that. Considering US keeps hoarding vaccines, can’t blame them. hope Europe forget behavior US go another international militaristic tantrum. No, species failure, prove it. Would gotten one weren’t planning kick otherwise? depends several factors, including location, job, prior health conditions, etc.

It there. nothing todo vaccine. 

correlation causality same. seen side effect people got Pfizer Moderna vaccine, also important remember Norway started using AZ vaccine mid February couple thousand people vaccinated 3 young people getting unusual blood clot cause concern. hope weird coincidence, could bad batch. likely get fined, imprisoned.

Still sad apparently created cheap effective vaccine, however undermined sticking regulations record, also plant Porriño (Galicia, Spain) plans produce Sputnik, although gets EMA approved. Source (in Spanish): producing Novavax, released approved. responded different day posted. Let's see Ireland two days row. That’s apparently good thing, means you’re producing immune response! Yay you. know posts starting look like spam, I'm trying make sense all.

On one side, AZ, EMA MHRA saying number blood clots seen higher expected happen general population, there's reason stop vaccinations.

On other, health agencies Norway Denmark claim type blood clots actually pretty uncommon, clots coinciding low number blood platelets.

Can someone make sense this? also find strange 3 health workers hospital fell ill Norway, EU countries adverse effects. due bad batch, clusters normal? blood clots appear Europe? Could genetic? can’t decide I’m seething numb it. grandma little younger (upper mid 80s memory serves) diabetes stroke survivor, still shot yet. feels like aren’t even trying true all, simply say nobody ECMO machines two doses.  giving us information.  people upvoting blatantly wrong comment lol. Good job keeping ahead curve guys, well done! issue know much cannot speculate well. says sounds like makes sense, novice things. tend put faith Fauci days. know knowledge motivation make things work vaccines, issue almost certain he's already that. ~Roundabout JoJo plays~ variants even exploding numbers. measuring recently. ""new"" CA variant first discovered almost year ago yet keep emphasizing ""new"" is. single teacher working privately owned school likely breaking law sending student home example ""Swedish public health decisions""? good stuff. Canadian government isn’t quick vaccine 50 year old I’m expecting see name list least Teo months. aren’t even done vaccinating elders 70+ yet. probably start vaccinations ages 60-69 somewhere around April 1st. Anyways dear Neighbors south keep efforts morale! also read long covid peer reviewed papers, think something accepted science nowadays. Prior infections help too, big question whether 50% degree immunity enough prevent variant rapidly spreading. I'm sure us know answer yet. Dude go read wrote. 

If wearing mask public health directions yes, baffling polite term. 

Would rather use another, accurate one? 15 clotting cases Pfizer vaccine 13 AstraZeneca. normal rate doses given, none described unusual. take comments sort lowest highest see -60+ comment yesterday call hypocrisy condemning people beach /r/pics.  They're Hank Aaron also. Unfortunately much changed Biden Administration people expected.

America First Trump legacy Biden follow. reports serious side effects unusual blood clots etc? Well Italy starting July gonna begin production Sputnik vaccine, I’d say EU definitely showing interest vaccine. Don’t see reason Eu gonna refuse doses. bangladesh nationwide mask mandate. we're debating 2 masks, i've heard conflicting views on. right (probably not, still) *increasing* people's chance catching double masks bad Maybe so, expect every major country move domestic vaccine production near future. becoming big vaccine export hub world unrealistic either way. [You really tell they'd happy hear wrong they've gotten it. Last year news actually told us COVID ocean water would wash shore infect people. said one worst places could possibly be. wish joking. year ago, saying everyone going get COVID, half country would die, society would collapse, blah blah blah. Yeah COVID really bad it’s almost like wanted things turn chaos. tried smoking pot? EU members much pride

*Cough cough* dump cut Ursula *cough cough* google ""student sent home for"" get sorts bizarre anectdotal reasons kids sent home world.

I good morning laugh. lane seems making morons feel inadequate. figured would put behind. think would uld put far behind. yeah guess is. People taking AZ vaccine. couple outliers like Norway (not even part EU) Ireland’s suspending AZ norm. haven’t heard big refusal get AZ, frankly there’s old fucker who’s going pass vaccine I’m sure there’s bunch young people waiting go back normal. 


I really hope they’re gonna speed vaccinations cause otherwise I’m gonna get mine next year rate. Hard compare case counts countries tests per capita test regimes different. 

Looking deaths, Israeli deaths fell 65 17 74% reduction. California deaths fell 575 227 60% reduction. Israel markedly better looking accurate statistic.

Furthermore, Israel lifted restrictions California afaik, still sharper decline deaths. Yeah, really think did. explicit recommendation wearing masks schools far know. reasons matter. matters safe efficacious. definitely trying look good, course. deciding take vaccine stop looking good really bad public health policy. can't wait articles come next week California packing beaches wonderful is. reports, vaccines. scientist can't comment means. agree wait see comes investigations. want vaccine really

There’s absolutely way things get worse. would ever get Chinese one? Seriously





If get vaccine called Sputnik? take live Sweden? obviously stance spreading misinformation, domestic articles reports criticizing decisions since March last year takes time build factories... wish EU would stay one let member states buy themselves. Much efficient. EU usual take months negotiate contract. destroy anything touch. understand clotting issues production problems. what? understand arguing against. 

I saw Swedish, agree reasoning general? reasoning school gave bullshit, clearly, think teachers kids would ill ease kids came school wearing masks. would feeld thrusted responsibility equipped (or paid for) handle. send kids home, they, principal, reasonable people, fully sure would get phone call 'the situation'. family member got nursing home. dead though nobody knows died. Yes, experts opinion coronavirus doesn’t belong r/coronavirus. pandemic really exposed people.

same thing. Proof? Wow, chose one doesn’t work 😆 okay, measles, then, sake example? Yeah social media make effort thoroughly investigate source information every comment. people would that, particularly gullible ones. tips (or links tips)? US basically hoarded vaccine supply little luck variants. enough cases, guess? Smallpox actually human disease completely eradicated. However, point still stands, close everything winter flu season. hope somewhat soon things go back normal, know I'm one wait covid restrictions extremely important things done. hilarious beautiful thing that’s confusing guy died Pfizer vaccine, literally one dude think, also blood disorder. 

But blood disorder blood clots blood thin. 

So got Pfizer vaccine asked blood thinners guess would make worse. 

With AstraZeneca vaccine seems create blood clots rather thin blood I’m completely confused. bougie SAHM best friend get people won’t stay home. Because...most us don’t rich husband zoom calls rich lawyer daddy fund us sitting home? P.1 accounts 0 ~3,000 cases Colorado sequenced. could months would spread enough found, B.1.1.7 been.

Side note: found 5 cases B.1.351 prison, 85% inmates vaccinated next day. Sequencing matters. I'd like know US plan enough doses. doses going population inoculated? largest trading partner, hope Canada getting majority vaccine exports, hopefully moving date. Big sticker fine white girl water bottle money one wants wear one forever. want wear one till confidently say over. numbers leveling like 60,000 cases day deaths far 2000 per day. guys going set us back months keep shit up. Good. Entitled idiot.  know 7 people I’m good go. Feeling sarcasm 😂 That's mutation works. Mutation random. Conditions select winners. best way prevent mutations prevent infections prevent replication virus infected. Vaccines fantastic job both. much hope correct. Many elected officials get daily briefing high horses follow common sense people... actually suppose do. live experiencing morning rush hours evenings. people masked including go store requires masks do. Unfortunately “they” say it’s over.... shall see. know lot details, [this suggests US sitting Astrazeneca doses waiting trials finish. can't think good reason they'd intend keep within country. Looks like there's consideration allow go Brazil? That'd nice happened. Please hold hope little longer, I’m confident things almost completely normal states summer. Don’t anything drastic, it’s worth it. variants aren’t gonna matter soon people actually risk vaccinated thought articles insane LAST spring summer. Can't believe we're again... beach probably one safest places go.

Still waiting ""Office Shaming"" articles, though. Offices reopening unnecessarily cause asshole middle managers, trapped gossip standing doorway mask barely nose. Bizarre rules wearing masks halls kitchen sometimes meetings, obviously there's poor ventilation knows? love you’re lecturing people emotional softies can’t handle minuscule risk virus. old sickly vaccinated justifiable rationale keep living lockdown paranoia. emotional softie here. completely sidestepped questions, see you’re looking reflection. You’re looking outlet. hope find solace bitterness. Good luck. it’s crazy much sub changed year. would murdered saying something like last year really think could related people previously Covid infection, young healthcare workers prime people previous infection. might body doesn’t get rid Covid well people. already know people tested positive Covid long time too. 

Even case Pfizer Florida healthcare worker. fair protesting masks, want everything open. yes many aap protesting curfew makes sense seeing they’re opening gyms, movie theaters etc. cases continent, many restrictions, curfew makes sense. US....""just keep trying log in...you get point maybe turn"".

Yeah, that's ""freedom"". /s Wait, aren’t vaccinating close 5m day now? 

Edit: sorry, realized article UK think sell (I also think help donate countries can't afford it). country feel love selling vaccines use them? countries love US hurting economy spite them?  So, J&amp;J shot provides equivalent prevention severe disease hospitalization Pfizer/Moderna vaccine. However, provide level protection long Covid? Given doesn’t provide level protection infection w/ mild symptoms/asymptomatic infection. Poor phrasing Well country behaves like spoiled children, maybe need parent. long people continue wont good another 2 years. Downvote me, truth hurts flu way deadly kids nobody shut schools every kid vaccinated. Flu one required public schooling. Corona harm kids way elderly sickly. required get even pediatric trials done years now. Jojo destroyed perception reality.  US handling much better Europe countries? simply variants? worry duct work buildings. Air intakes care far apart people especially office buildings. issue, hospitals room air exchanged every minutes.

Right afraid go MLB NFL game (outside) outdoor dining going indoor gathering figure serious variants going be. Also, I've Pfizer shots. see variant booster future. Lots people lived restrictive manner last year. Everyone limits. spread means chance mutation, mutation could well effective circumventing vaccines well current treatment methods. investigated. there’s much evidence wide-spread heighten risk. would seen many cases, given millions vaccinations occurred. it’s surprising countries crack on, unless investigation complete. Pfizer vaccine suspended this? 

A better title thread would probably Northern Ireland Department Health reported new COVID-19 deaths first time since October Sunday.

Ireland 16 deaths yesterday.

FWIW, link daily reports Thank you. Would really nice understand science behind statistic. Fauci needs spend time explaining vaccines work efficacy numbers really mean. Way way way many people think J&amp;J inferior. thing liberal god forsaken state. 1,000 times lower mortality rate per capita...
I would choose vaccination rate day. Damn, got lucky 

I fully prepared worst honestly, wasnt bad. friend (21M, type 1.5 diabetes) said got worst chills imaginable moderna shot 2 god...moderate chills. also lasted day 2 days. hey, I'll take vaccinated believe end. individuals may never move this, vast majority absolutely will. 

You must understand, there's whole lot many states right moment. Wanna go bar? Depending are, that. Wanna eat inside restaurant? Depending that. Wanna go movie theater? Depending that. Wanna go walk/hike? anywhere. Wanna hang friends? responsibly.

What mean? Well means cannot comes personal risk assessment. Right may feel comfortable activities listed (despite fact may allowed live). However, day passes, activity becomes less risky safe. 

This say feel COMFORTABLE living normal life again, many normal activities you, they're already write out. vaccinations continue increase, cases/hospitalizations/deaths continue decrease, getting closer closer point say ""ok, I'm ready dine-in/go see movie/go bar etc."" That's look this.

I know feels like point close yet far away, feeling frustrating/stressful really near. really getting close. point persevered, managed make long way. anything shows caring kind person, shows wise understand world much bigger individual desires. please, keep little longer, prepare epic Summer friend.

Thank you. analogy I've seen works best, opinion, 9/11. know old enough remember world 9/11, different. Even 20 years later, still fully returned normal September 10, 2001.

The pandemic probably similar. year next go on, normalcy return, little remnants there, like people wearing masks whenever they're sick, possibly temperature checks get large events, vaccine passports international travel, nothing new, may become commonplace.

Will get 2019 normal? Maybe 100 percent. like 99 percent normal, either later year (most likely), early next year (less likely). come time able whatever want without restrictions fear virus. But, like said, may remnants, like way worry TSA airport 9/11, that's accepted fact life.

There light end tunnel, we're gonna get there. promise. don’t live like this. mental health matters too. Go need healthy. Leave house. Socialize friends. Many many people tell places like FL never really changed. part year. Go live life. You’re going get vaccine day now. Don’t listen doomsday media headlines written profits, don’t listen overly cautious “experts” never say “It’s time!” State fair, smooth butter 92yo grandma vaccinated? Tons hospitals PHUs 80+ 2 weeks now. What’s reason hasn’t vaccinated? year ruined taken spontaneity life, laid off, haven’t seen family 15 months, I’ve basically locked inside. DONT think people suffered greatly past year you’re sociopath. Weird gathering ex-presidents urging people vaccine Trump show up. must tried inviting twitter 75% number second study credible. first study, pretty good research time. took lot blood donors seroprevalence test, (using logic time antibodies lost month more) funky math get final numbers. raw numbers interesting start high drop. consensus seems overestimate - donating blood free way get antibody test, thought they'd would participate. raw numbers dropped bit 30% (northern hemisphere's) summer, likely represent true number since (as believe) there's all-natural-cause mortality graph Amazonas (population 3.4 million), possibly Manaus (population 2.2 million). Median age Manaus 26 2% population 70, even absence medical care would expect high IFR. Anything 30% attack rate first wave starts give non-credible levels IFR.  second wave caused roughly twice many deaths.

As additional deaths beyond first wave, second paper concluding attack rate continued rise nonsensical. actual serology numbers continued drop, sero-revision calculations made seem rise. logical conclusion lower numbers different model estimate herd immunity threshold 30% attack rate 65%. 

Manaus right equator Amazon, gets lot rain. first second wave happened ""wet"" season. intervening period ""dry"" (less rainy) season. give possible explanation managing many months total suppression. We've seen people forced indoors, spread increases.

Nonetheless ""good"" explanation data. P.1 P.2 responsible almost cases start wave - end, P.1. December, P.1 outpaced ""wild lineages"" nearly 4-fold per week growth. indicates either ~2.5x increased contagiousness (and, presumably, increased mortality go along it) high level immune escape. still know which. Same, 2nd moderna Friday. felt fine friday night Saturday day, bit fatigued achey night (nothing bad, kinda felt like big hike). Might bit low grade fever couple hours manageable nowhere near anything Flu-like dreading. guess CDC wait recommend lifting restrictions including mask mandates minors access vaccine hospitalizations deaths Coronavirus normally see flu season. Houston eligible, call wait speak person. Ignore recorded message saying full. call morning get shot afternoon. basically cut red tape, made easier adminster vaccines, try get much support rollout. guess we’ll normal June nice. I've worn mask work every day year now. annoying times big step remote learning. Got week ago. mild sore arm 2 days 4 days light diarrhea 2 days. Nothing diet usually causes issues knows. I'm 50s expected destroyed it. AZ get approval, assume would end april - thats another 50 million vaccines 

We believe roughly 30 million doses available US government end March, another 20 million, total 50 million, end April.” movie would thousand times better without stupid ""comedy"" Smith. biggest factor lot population aren’t gonna go back non-essential businesses without Fauci’s blessing he’s still saying “Stay Home” much possible, outside hanging friends willing show vaccine card. definitions immune immune definitely would!  misread numbers number first shots done, thought 100 million United States open schools. Pray us. hospital 30 positive patients first time months! Please keep Dallas! think it’s actually side effect people trapped inside week snow storm, it’s probably go governor lifting mask mandate. celebrate. misread stuff thought hit 100 million first shots knows hospital though. cuz went getting shot (if even did) mean that's there. Vaccinated 10% population lot different 90%. It’s difficult concept. it’s high enough percentage it’s fine. Maybe quarantined, California, we’ve told gather people outside household year. Even outside wearing masks. Currently allowed 2 households, outside wearing masks.

Even COVID-conservative friends abandoned recommendation. meet backyards, space chairs out, eat lunch together one weekends. Even correct, 1 4.5 million fatal side effect.

The fatality rate virus around 1 100,000 young children markedly worse everyone else. thought US hit 100 million shots maybe world stats US stats 🤦‍♂️ Let’s hope vaccine safe works. would unfortunate unaffected wasted entire year going public health officials get nothing. something consider.… fact seems like that’ll change year 10-20 person family gatherings Thanksgiving/Christmas allowed step right direction also disappointing. Sounds almost exactly like happened Worcester Massachusetts. built gigantic field hospital DCU Center downtown, torn apart, covid returned, rebuilt it. Lmao. what’s stop everyone wear mask even everyone vaccinated? seem guidelines keeping people flooding beaches tourist traps live. roads parking lots filled state license plates. bars filled one distancing. even locals go places. Tourism full effect. No, article say anything deaths left reporting/removed YouTube/taken Facebook. death known caused vaccine, said likely caused vaccine. source article claiming vaccine victim's father. Even so, got second shot died.

I would faith current administration mandated EUA. even EUA status back October, would faith government then. I’m happy you! I’m glad able help son! check comment. it’s due almost complete ignorance rules. people gather, party, travel, wear masks, etc. postman never wears mask runs around apartment buildings day, taking elevators etc. also people apartment complex uses masks inside building perimeter complex. everyone else doesn’t. actually look weird us wearing one, think think infected. meanwhile it’s mandatory wear masks outside, everywhere, unless you’re alone park forest. 

so that’s why, pretending virus real real damage masks hurt economy. everywhere, it’s social acceptable even promoted. say, sure fellow American? say CPAC. didn’t make big deal recommend getting it. information true reliable, would argue right thing do? 

Of course lol. deliberately withholding (equally true) side story.

No one withholding anything here. agree case

Well go then. understand everyone wants look inward, protect citizens first. behaviour damaging relationships countries going forward. countries fall far behind others vaccination, could dire consequences rest world later. look Brazil believe groceries/clothes spread covid, would want wait everyone household vaccinated stop. Sure, that's fair. think agree, :) think I’ve ever heard referred Island Ireland

This Irish British include republic Northern Ireland together. terminology used original Irish constitution claimed North, food Friday agreement. Isle, yes.

This tends used non Irish people live America never actually here. rising trajectory daily new cases visible eight states.

We 639 deaths far. 10 age 50. 96 70. 


We've suddenly four mysterious blood clot cases can't explain, couple days, healthy people 50. many people using AZ vaccine. 


With numbers certain using vaccine worth risk. investigate 1) related vaccine, bad luck, 2) vaccine, common issue, 3) vaccine, it? second shot, fill paper work again? walk show card jab done? You’re right. studies linking interaction paradigms social media susceptibility misinformation. downvote system would certainly lower exposure consumption misinformation Facebook Twitter. crazy thing relatively high vaccine uptake is, higher percentage population. That's telling there's something different DoC population average, maybe vet candidates needs looked at. Hmm agree case, ""Posting reliable information cannot possibly bad"" absolutely always true. Take example 2016 US election - wikileaks published steady stream Hillary's emails.

All information true reliable, would argue right thing do? 

Pushing one side story, even true, absolutely bad thing deliberately withholding (equally true) side story. love salty licorice. right time start returning normal.

So people die along way simply wanted go Chili’s month vaccinated sacrifice you’re willing make, right? Ah, get downvotes coming from. It’s make sure microchip activated frequencies synched.  NM. quite sure verified this. know verify via medical records database back end something like that. Either way, would want one ""tests"" system. glad rolling seems rolling well. 

I can't imagine easy task account. largest vaccine effort ever see lifetimes. level play technical accuracy emotion. playing different. played Dvorak cello concerto brought house, encore played Bach cello Suite No. 1 wasn’t dry eye room. That’s next level (or 10 levels up...) Potential deliveries supplies hand hoarded. EU repeatedly found true . moment looks like 4 people many millions? I’ll take odds.
Something saw news, theres link vaccine causing bloodclots, one thing definitely cause clots Coronavirus.
But hey, lets stop rolling immunisation population due extremely low chance causes complications selfish thing I’ve heard day.

I’m young healthy - I’m worried falling seriously ill get sick covid. empathetic human beings worry getting sick subsequently spreading people risk complications and/or death.

So many people subreddit already made decision social lives worth well-being others, mental gymnastics required defend position. TRANSLATION: predicted end last week, cases keep going without stopping due widespread ignorance refusal adhere mandatory restrictions mask use along little restrictions control execution restrictions.

The government announced cases stop, next step country wide lockdown. 

As reminder Poland lockdown means cultural venues hotels closed. sort workplace construction zone, factories etc. still open government “suggests” work home possible. Also mask use mandatory places work nobody follows requirement nobody controls it.

There’s also reports widespread abuse loophole professional athletes go work gyms gyms sign members professional athletes tug war nonsense. Meaning everyone still goes gym.

Doctors warn hospitals filling patients getting younger ans younger.

On upside, 3 month extremely slow vaccinations, 10% adult population received least one shot.

… prime minister consistently wears actual mask instead vented pm2.5 smog sporting year.
(There ministers still wear vented masks.) EU responsible Anyone aware reddit forum discuss side effects covid vaccines? Unless got johnson &amp; johnson, please wait recommended time SECOND jab. incredibly important detail. Luckily everyone, new admin happy share vaccines /s probably do! work indoor tourist trap. absolute audacity people scream us requiring masks ridiculous. want hear kind reason -- pitch fits Covid cleaning enforced employee wearing mask. Ever since reopened, county climbed back kept moderate level cases. closed, cases dropped drastically. mean, I'm one press correlations, think interesting. Yeah, cuz everyone gets Covid dies.

Very strong argument... needs requirement jobs.

The threat unemployment make people reconsider. care health others falter livelihood risk.

Unless work home, never go outside food dropped front doorstep walking disease vector.

We already fire workers whatever reason might well use power good. data shows promising results, also need know many people ""1 week second dose"". like 100 (I know probably much bigger that), data meaningless. preach it. amount people sub can't understand astounding. Every single traffic accident death preventable, there’s still little support banning even private motor vehicles. even account 1/100 number. check thyroid function, pandemic I'll seeing doctor blood tests critical care here.

Its bloody annoying since used great sleep tolerance good recovery.

To help offset periods I've started taking hydration tablets, power naps weeks well, less work I'm able to. 

It partly helped, though I've got clue placebo point.  EU one blame themselves.

They blame imposing strict export ban vaccines day 1. otherwise EU would 34 million additional doses already, would exceed Israel UAE vaccinations (because countries import EU - Israel IIRC used Pfizer/Biontech Belgium, UAE used AZ Italy, Pfizer/Biontech Belgium Sputnik Sinopharm). Maybe EU vaccination rate would even exceed UK, procured least 9 million doses ""made EU"".

The US UK playing hardball, hoarding production themselves; buying additional doses EU production, pressuring everyone else buy EU vaccines instead Russian Chinese ones, cherry top chuzpah tell everyone ""the EU starting vaccine trade war"". mean supply population first..... others, can't help others dying unthinkable? It’s vaccine published phase III data &amp; effective. wouldn’t EU consider midst pandemic - Shambolic journalism authorised last year though, counts. need therapy. SoMa always dead begin with, add fact offices shut double dead. North Beach Marina generally super alive, Mission Polk. truly great see. way! Wow, sounds like loving family. @cap251978 need snarky question. Thats going make people ask US evil party here. So, technically possible, realistically chance bad batch astronomically low.

I agree unlikely, impossible, investigating seems like good idea Pog Gotcha. :) Like said, parts *could* reused. adenovirus capable causing blood clotting. withdrawal agreement longer place. superseded Brexit Bill.

There’s usually good reason it. People shouldn’t pressured get one, that’s beyond insane informed consent all. 

Me personally, want J J it’s one shot. I’m terrified needles know won’t come back second dose. one works me. Exactly.

The EU messed big times vaccination response.

it time swallowing pride. Getting vaccinated requirement keeping certain jobs,like prison guards. Trials kids 16 beginning. months. well really need ramp testing genome sequence kids. kids italy getting new variants. 

it sucks, kids new frontier point. need start monitoring like crazy see spikes, intervene get vaccinated 

haven’t heard much development, plenty test kits easy celebrated grabbing mushroom Swiss Whataburger. Anyone want see video? everything starting really pick up, Plague Inc comparisons definitely spot on, reason, actual ""cure"" progression rollout really captured it. Can't wait message pop saying eradicated. Oh, wait.. Florida exists. UK's plants authorised EMA.

They been. withdrawal agreement means uk plants authorised. EU says UK, basically political nonsense.

Mostly. backstab remembered. :-) Sites like reddit largely immune misinformation.

Of course intellectual-ish user base feel option downvote content valuable too.

Especially since downvoted comments hidden default. loosest one find get away following mask rules. EU commission embarrassing spat AZ recently want shift publics ire AZ. look another Chinese expert somehow knows nothing Chinese vaccine?

Ok.  Sounds Like effects Long Time Alkohol drug abuse Safe Virus harm harming myselfe everyday even remember happened Last year haha Life mich fun Long Term fucked skrrr Bitches Care tho I'm European.

I think Biden right thing. Europe big enough figure itself.

But soon countries like Brazil need help. virus isnt going away, unless control every world. thought people sub apart crowd. change? Well well.. Tell politicizing vaccine? got FEMA Navy administering shot (in Florida) completely free, take insurance card anything. like lighting cigarette gas leak right smell gas tiny bit less minute ago. tell someone can’t get cruise ship unless vaccinated, get vaccinated wanna cruise. 

Your gonna bring anyone side words think it’s fake. However, government sets restrictions (obvious tk essential) people group get vaccinated move 

That said people become even vaccines justify chip nonsense. say world? No. Morning. Take deep breath, life get easier. folks stopped disinfecting clothes groceries back April, turns known cases virus spreading way.

So yeah, stop you’re vaccinated. pretty much stop worrying Covid all! distinct difference EMA approval EU contracts.

If member state procures additional doses approved vaccine outside EU contract, vaccinated vaccine still receive vaccination passport. unlikely case EU negotiates Gamalayea institute contract EMA never approves vaccine, vaccinated EU-procured doses Sputnik get EU vaccination passport either.

What know happens people vaccinated Sputnik EMA approved. eligible vaccination passport retroactively? wrong there's practical problem involved, namely: people want prison guards. There's already dangerous manpower shortages. get more, convince people take job. usually involves budget. even could it, hiring training time would months even year.

You release prisoners point things get real squirrely. 50% serious violent crime. fever body jerked awake every time crossing wake sleep state weeks months insomnia kicked bad wasn’t sleeping days one hour still get jerked awake got end last March would nightmare nightmare sometimes 3 one night actually nightmare covid dream blue moon nightmare rarely digestion still mess dunno, walking ramp thing pretty fucking stupid. Okay. disagree. confirm case. know 25 people fully vaccinated none vomited side effect. None reported nausea side effect me.

I say day second vaccine (moderna) mostly felt like hangover, including ever slightly nauseas. Never came close vomiting though.

I’m sure it’s possible, seems relatively rare side effect. Cloth everywhere else; KN95 work others’ comfort Well, right, really nothing suspicious going 😂😂😂 Go ahead read write sub. weird thing bring up.

Also, US literally written report. admitted it. literally nothing accuse off. Who's one acting like bot here?  fill paperwork again. I’d venture Corrections lot overlap demographics attitudes police departments, many oppositional safety measures photographed wearing masks public duty. 

Some county city jails (depending state, crimes 90-364 day sentences) even put new officers/deputies corrections duty period time field work. Denmark 6 times densely populated Sweden...

So argument probably dont hold up. feel like we've horrible movie past year we're part dawn next morning begin see sun rising. Viral vector vaccines new unknowns interact immune system. mRNA vaccines bypass immune system initially use LNPs. There's absolutely theoretical reason side effects much different traditional vaccine. That's part frustration among looking vaccine. appreciate local approach distribution, methods vary wildly state state (from layman's perspective) feels wildly uncoordinated national effort. 

Ex: area city/state/county hospitals place. area, city/state/county local health department giving clinics based front-line workers only, elderly added last week. 2 weeks ago, part organization (i.e. municipal school employee, town service, corporation) running clinic get appointment. end day, taking elderly (65+) without appointments ""spare"" doses. Hospitals zero doses. Primary Care physicians zero doses. (note: major front-line lists calling registered residents priority order now...but call you, way around)
