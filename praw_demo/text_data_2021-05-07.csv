0,2021-05-07," go?  variants would deadly O2 treatment available. Yeah people can‚Äôt take jokes days. people bashing Florida yet get downvoted. guess everyone works Norwegian carnival whatever floating death trap. everyone subreddit seems talk shit useless washing hands preventing Covid. seems reason even washing hands begin with. Like wash hands regular basis even prevent spread Covid. mean would explain much contagious flu, right? (assuming Flu transmitted respiratory droplets airborne) South Korea state internalized HVAC systems increased spread like year ago ? .. recall reading must using internet explorer web browser. really sucks came proper mitigation strategies airflow filtering, encouraged outdoors safety, could spent less time disinfecting groceries. Totally! Go CT; it‚Äôs interesting compare handled things states, particularly south also even New England. think general us willing accept it, follow rules, get vaccinated without bitching. We‚Äôre small enough state really felt community banding together, here‚Äôs pay off. Feel really lucky living (as much ah bitch taxes non stop) generally understood actual outside event super spreader, indoor event held afterwards. wear masks all. Seems extension long took acknowlede human human spread, breakneck speed compared this... I‚Äôm graduate school semi-large state school officially announced they‚Äôll requiring students staff vaccinated Fall.  Yep. I've deleted, blocked, estranged many dumb fucks thing. dumb fucks respected profoundly. brought absolute worst people. specifically mention crowded events concerts sports games main source, makes sense people often shouting saliva flying directions. 

But normal social event outdoors friends, feet apart? chances slim. immunity from. don't. It‚Äôs sad state affairs epidemiology virology takes best scientists world year agree particular virus spreads isn‚Äôt effective measure protection. tells little effort made pandemic study viruses classify properly. need remedy loved one adverse reaction drug put body.

They Farts mixture gases like methane hydrogen sulfide. size molecules around 0.5 nm, whereas coronavirus particles ~100 nm, approximately 200 times bigger. 

I'm saying makes difference cloth masks discussed, materials filter 100 nm particles letting small molecules. really appreciate correcting me, reminding importance accurately stating things. EUA would instantly revoked emergency declaration pandemic removed, vaccine ‚Äúactually‚Äù approved. 

My opinion Novavax key global fight, it‚Äôs going play big role US. think it‚Äôs supply focused India, hotspots. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll provide long duration memory immunity, it‚Äôs sterilizing antibody protection, especially variants remarkable. thought FDA wants wait months let antibody titers die down, get cellular response data TNF-a TH1. think obvious annual vaccine too, company almost instantly designing 
co-influenza/Coronavirus vaccine proof concept. It‚Äôs perfect reducing high levels community spread rapid robust antibody response first dose. It‚Äôs easy distribute too, they‚Äôre small company.

 know happen friend necessity mother inventions. Thanks knowledgeable, providing nuanced discussion helping correct me. correct. takes one simple wind gust bit covid infect you. average, takes upwards 10 minutes socializing indoors infected person get infected. implying stagnant air virus high density. yes, wind might blow virus direction, going small amount reach properly high viral load infect. guess. Back day, good grades good SAT scores unless shooting Ivy League.  Airborne = smaller particles. need respirator tight fitting mask (and honestly googles). sneeze apparently travel 27 feet easily. ""not single person got covid restaurant""

This sub, every fucking day. Post case studies contrary, mods remove citing ""politics"". No. Yeah one news reports learn vaccines work many times could tell Fauci wondering hell Trump going about. Around here, last heard, still don‚Äôt vaccinated order give vaccinations. Doesn‚Äôt seem best idea me, reasons people might think. Imagine someone hesitantly going vaccine starts asking last minute questions reassurance......and find person they‚Äôre asking doesn‚Äôt want vaccine. know, I'm thinking approve one use first. big deal strange me. Lol anyone ELI5 outdoor transmission factor ? travel air ? positive person 10- 20ft apart open filed get infected ? India researchers talking spread corona virus help pollens somehow explains sudden spikes allover India March although might coincidence. 

There article local news paper village Maharashtra got infected storm span 2-3 day people started showing symptoms Village . ""no shit Sherlock""

A quote 90s seems stuck Remember back January 2020, believed Coronavirus stocking supplies conspiracy theorist. Ahhh days. Agree. Beautifully stated Good study. 

Imagine suspecting airborne, n95 negative pressure room, walking covid isolation room.

That's like year ago. even face shields time first major supply face shields donated local 3d printer enthusiast made visor frame bought bunch material make mask. godsend. That's exactly cousin said sent her. kids 5 9 years old. Surprised left tweet up, thought would memory holed long ago. Sure buddy, happen every flu season literally running wood cremate dead bodies. many Americans become stupid? vaccine ever heard contagious smallpox vaccine. give someone welt similar one caused vaccine itself. Yep facebook scientists rant can‚Äôt trust science. Can‚Äôt wait. preferred distance next closest human (other wife, since like her) 1000 meters. 

Unfortunately travel living got flight sat next guy reading book Q Republicans committing acts terrorism way glorified them. recall name book, read back cover reading. 

Folks, going make it. hope low. would‚Äôve thought? people vaccinated = less new cases, less hospitalizations less deaths. Science works Low efficacy vaccine combined loosening restrictions third wave happening time forget temperature checks, fix rather tragic places like Cambodia Thailand, looked largely escaped pandemic earlier year could optimistically assumed that, vaccines, end sight.

Here's hoping New Zealand (where live) next ""success story gone bad"". DeStupid strikes again. incredible stuff CDC, keep  sitting outside park yesterday. number runners ran close bench unsettling. know say outdoor transmission almost impossible people breathing heavily without masks sitting. stretched legs front times runners would move bit farther away, couldn‚Äôt stop thinking droplets headed right face wind blowing me. can‚Äôt good I‚Äôm again, vaccinated not. submit time Sinovac decision come days. Badly need 2-11 approval July/Aug minimize ‚Äúback school‚Äù spike bound happen autumn winter. Yep, wish would waited instead guilt tripped getting offered couple months ago That‚Äôs seemed obvious me. people China getting apartment building different floor. lawsuit. lost revenue. Costs lot money prep ship turn around. See Norovirus outbreak pre covid era.  ‚Äúon-the-fence‚Äù person I‚Äôd love get insight seem like somebody pretty knowledgeable.

I‚Äôve COVID. incredibly minor me. Slight fever, body aches, lost sense smell three days. Whole ordeal lasted less week wasn‚Äôt worse usual cold (Again, experience. aware many COVID carries *substantially* higher risks ‚Äúcommon cold.‚Äù I‚Äôm trying diminish threat COVID obviously poses.)

I‚Äôm young, fit, eat incredibly healthy. Don‚Äôt drink. Don‚Äôt smoke. 

What‚Äôs risk getting vaccine me? I‚Äôm already group incredibly low risk personal experience shown body perfectly capable handling virus.

Which brings vaccine(s) themselves. people know gotten shot minor side effects. Aches, slight fever, headaches, chills, etc. I‚Äôve two friends needed take day work shots side effects. side effects shots seems exactly side effects got getting COVID itself. (Again- personal experience) 

Why voluntarily expose common side effects vaccines carry (soreness, fever, chills, headaches, etc.) open slim possibility developing serious complication? Especially seems vaccines don‚Äôt necessarily prevent entirely getting transmitting COVID? 

I‚Äôm still set natural immunity now, studies shown lasts months. Would crazy wait fall? Especially there‚Äôs already early news we‚Äôre might need getting booster shot fall anyways? 

Sorry- turned long post. Thanks reading. üôèüèº study convinced stay indoor spaces. missing last part tenth amendment. often gets overlooked, powers reserved federal states people. remember government class correctly, intent even state level it‚Äôs absolute. rights powers intended reserved people unless explicitly stated otherwise, fact it‚Äôs big part framers didn‚Äôt even want bill rights, felt sent wrong message.

But agree commerce clause potentially diplomacy powers (these foreign flagged ships) likely cases brought. point point many possible constitutional arguments, stronger others, challenge particular law. work days, turned everyone using multiple times day try ""hot"" go home. sitting dead battery almost year. people (like school Florida) actually think vaccine contagious, therefore want vaccinated people coming near them. Vaccines appointments across state weeks. opposed actual data? Japan actually used research Diamond Princess quarantine measures failed greenlight 3C's campaign last February. huge reason Japan relatively deaths cases. people scrubbing everything wouldn‚Äôt false sense security?  mean, much *safe*. airplanes actually better many environments change air frequently fresh outside air HEPA filters. know might stretch, but... even read link provided thread? Getting college gotten lot competitive. Still overall nothing's really changed. Cases downward trending require Pfizer license IP

I mean, plenty vaccine companies licensing (e.g. Novavax), there's enough manufacture. suspect Moderna &amp;c. would happily license IP like moderna snap fingers competent partner.  going since April 12th. Maybe bump spring break, whatever now. Overall middle pack can't say mask shutdowns worked work overall numbers.  thought already known ages ago.  Doctors lawyers make lot money lot people get health care law despite lucrative potential

What they're costs way doctor, even research (think Chadox), also trials regulatory approval. blame biden happens.

Dear Leader actually virus, experience know handle it. Biden wimped took vaccine. Weak!   It‚Äôs month since Florida opened everyone, it‚Äôs difficult find appointment there. Inventing free Oxford did, conduct trials, work regulatory agencies, etc. costs lot push finish line! state simply doesn‚Äôt power make law limits this, it‚Äôs explicitly power given either constitution

This actually exact opposite stated. States considered inherently power decide matters explicitly reserved federal government. 

As another person pointed out, actual constitutional violation would come commerce clause interstate international commerce explicitly reserved federal government thus state make laws concerning activities. ships elsewhere.

YASSSS! Winning! Slay, queen! Numerous government officials sides: *(nervous laughter)* requested priority review, asks FDA take action within 6 months, compared 10 months designated standard review.‚Äù ... that‚Äôs one way reach herd immunity... disaster live through. Yep. choir. knew then. even weirder sinopharm got first approval sinovac, considering sinovac used EU sinopharm. They're saying Donovan soon wonder 60 days.  way air filtered planes strongly reduces airborne pathogens plane. completely, recorded plane cases. millions fly day don‚Äôt hear much it. There's thing ""full approval"". weasel language soften fact gone approval process.

inb4 ""hERetIc!"": happily got it. dunno find surprising kind obvious know, ever watched someone smoke cigarette go outside cold day. baffles mind people think they're 6 feet away someone means they're safe. Crazy people are. air. moves. We've known fact since last January December. Basically since first doctors treated died huge viral load took despite super careful surfaces cleaning hands. Shocking people made rules based nothing. yes, I'm talking CDC. knew better. talking about? Florida one worst outbreaks country last June, bad enough NBA seriously considering moving bubble stop using LabCorp state‚Äôs testing relocated testing resources specifically dedicate testing Florida Texas‚Äôs outbreaks. Get ‚ÄúEverything fine last summer‚Äù sure not. Don‚Äôt bringing math this! spidey sense says that's bullshit. Idk, think would vaccine rollout beginning anything else. know. Getting additional vaccines first round mixing brands authorized deemed necessary time.  want catch spread others.

You're literally never allowed leave isolation rest life then. current restrictions able go work today feeling pretty safe. 

And rest us able meet able provide parents 98 &amp; 94 still live home feel pretty confident posing risk psw's visit evenings. 

I really care felt like. feel like restrictive like it. feelings important mine, right restrict movement feelings. point explosion graph new cases?  unbelievable year plus this, still see people masks covering nose. can't even wear mask right place, there's hope correct seal.

EDIT: study even mentions gave multilingual, pictoral instructions 24% participants wore right. Geeze, people! frustrating someone whose productivity skyrocketed since home. offices makes anxious hard focus. home get much done, faster.  numbers seem show exceptionally rare transmit outdoors. 

I think really overstating it. 

 a¬†[systematic published studies transmission novel coronavirus respiratory viruses, Razani colleagues found **less 10 percent cases described spread outdoors.** also found frustratingly papers detailed settings clearly compared indoor outdoor situations.  takeaway it‚Äôs impossible get infection outdoors, even though published, clearly proportion happens much lower,‚Äù Razani said. added: ‚ÄúIf going beach ‚Äî beautiful thing ‚Äî avoid times it‚Äôs crowded, mask, Plan B.‚Äù

 risk outdoor transmission respiratory viral infections hypothesized low, limited data SARS-CoV-2 transmission outdoor compared indoor settings.   conducted systematic review peer-reviewed papers indexed PubMed, EMBASE, Web Science preprints Europe PMC 12 August 2020 described cases human transmission SARS-CoV-2. Reports respiratory virus transmission included reference.   identified studies found low proportion reported global SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred outdoors (&lt;10%) odds indoor transmission high compared outdoors (18.7 times; 95% confidence interval, 6.0‚Äì57.9).** There's like three one? Lol. many people 16 dead covid USA population Body shop hemp hand cream might smell best - hemp-but sting. Yeah. I‚Äôm Los Angeles literally everyone know, including friends, family, coworkers, students, get least gotten first shot. It‚Äôs nice. I‚Äôm vaccine passports think absolutly noting someone hospitalized eligible 4 weeks. Everyone been

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* link seem break variant cases. Someone told day vaccinated people ""shed"" virus particles make non-vaccinated people sick. vaccinated cross paths vaccinated person get sick cross paths someone covid. Let‚Äôs honest, it‚Äôs effing ridiculous us citizens cannot enter country fully vaccinated without test they? Kidney transplant patient, experience may differ heart, liver etc patients.

Shortly vaccines received Emergency Authorization received letter transplant center saying taking vaccine strongly recommended. wish saved letter, remember saying anything vaccine less effective. 

The first 90 days transplant highest doses  immunosuppressive drugs. transplant functioning well point dosages gradually tapered maintenance levels. WBC levels monitored lab tests every 2 months. 

I received transplant 1997. get sick often, hits hard. told necessary get sick often, sicker pick something. experience. 

BTW fully vaccinated. many side effects, sometimes wonder effective. However, read lucky experience side effects. 

I easing restrictions. plan things summer planning trip Sept. live life, COVID existence living surviving. Weird comment clearly says ""variant cases,"" like OP does. How'd miss that? People knee-jerk words ""essential oils"" matter context LOL. positivity FL. heard TWiV, ""Then enough testing.""  Agreed. real fear retaliation Trump. could see Dr.Fauci Dr.Birx. remember Dr.Fauci made first media appearance Biden won, could see much comfortable speaking without fear. Cases? No, haven‚Äôt. Yah Big Gym pretty much controls CDC. problem go 9 weeks first second dose? Hey you! Yeah you! Where‚Äôs mask dammit? Don‚Äôt see you‚Äôre speeding Covid person 100 ft away you! Bees terrify me. I'd rather get anal swab. Free bees wear mask? airborne makes scarier require droplet carrier meaning wear masks even people around public. least wear k95 kf94

Not possible: expensive service life 3 days (7 taking hi-tech washing facility, course poses problems). also hard breathe boot case yet change mind, vaccines shown high efficacy preventing transmission individuals, time. Please feel free get Tetanus shot, affect yourself, emotional well around want get lockjaw. Covid, slowing variant production preventing long term, sever disease, death. GET VACCINATED. FTFA:

 *Right now, virtually every single gram raw material produced shipped immediately manufacturing facilities converted immediately reliably vaccines shipped immediately around world (91 countries date.) proposed waiver COVID-19 vaccines, threatens to¬†disrupt flow raw materials. unleash¬†a scramble critical inputs require order make safe effective vaccine.

It seems crux issue. investigated false, require Pfizer license IP pay fair market value licensing based tiered system Pfizer already place.  really idiotic sitting alone park somebody approach tell wear one. people getting vaccine already dumb enough, dont know good idea cut education lol mean realistically social distancing indoors really difficult. Masks, covering cough, staying home sick, etc good lockdown measures. 6 feet distance hand? much. first all, droplet precaution already travels 6 feet. social distancing guidelines guidelines social distancing flu understood droplet respiratory infection. know young age taught wash hands droplets travel throughout whole indoor room. Since covid contagious, whole 6 feet distance beneficial.

I still nursing textbooks cover lot basic validation skills. 6 feet distancing, droplet precaution covered fundamentals validating nursing skills (donning doffing PPE cover this) 6 feet recommended distance flu.

Most social distancing policies great actual act distancing 6 feet bit flawed guideline/policy covid.

And yes crowded indoor areas need negative pressure work well.  already two doses AZ vaccine, harm getting dose different vaccine? Specifically, Pfizer?

As explanation: know AZ shown less effective variants Pfizer. Wondering elderly parents get better vaccine can. statistic coming from? checked worldometer‚Äôs Covid stats yep, Florida steady last month cases lower March/early-April. hope enough go back second shot. Hearing states that's become issue. 


So close guys, give up! I‚Äôm PA couple school districts already making plans clinics students 12+ anticipation approval next week. Trying prop Modi regime huh? Believe not, government agency perfect Trump start perfect he's gone. doubled two weeks? it‚Äôs crowded shoulder shoulder risk increase.
Perfect example would Trump‚Äôs Rose Garden press conference Supreme Court Justice Amy Comey Barret. considered super spreading event even though held outside.


Taking walk outside keeping good distance everyone else. risk zero. 


Attending crowded music concert 10,000 people without mask covid test vaccination.
The risk much much higher. Shedding product live-virus vaccines. 

With exception oral version polio vaccine, 1950s, vaccines produce shedding. 

None COVID vaccines produce shedding. Wtf? Y'all tripping. don‚Äôt know know outdoor transmission. numbers seem show exceptionally rare transmit outdoors. think along pushing outdoor dining/gyms/etc.. half capacity indoors. plane tickets visit 92-year old grandmother June, along wife 2 kids. Florida backwards shit hole can't get control, know even go, kids can't get vaccinated yet, think responsible subject state full backwater rejects get vaccinated wear masks. ""It looks like writing reddit post..."" Even basic cloth masks prevent far virus propelled mouth catch particles. Multiple layers better, etc. it‚Äôs reducing spread. It‚Äôs going stop completely. said last year based multiple well-documented case reports much longer-distance transmission downvoted hell. cdc read? everything outdoors summer. helps lot. forget people breeding stations new variants anti-science post I've read today. pushed family start taking actions. Buying masks, stocking (reasonably groceries), cancelled spring break trip March 2020 time get refund. people listened then, especially previous president, could‚Äôve saved lot people.  Meanwhile America prominent scientists thinking it‚Äôs highly unlikely states hit herd immunity. many people aren‚Äôt getting shots getting fast enough. 

Super sad see home eaten away massive disinformation campaigns. Things feeling hopeful CT. Life getting back normal. Traffic worse ever, restaurants busy. Looking forward good summer. idea going Florida. Testing low mitigation measures place.   women got pregnant trials undetected pregnancies beforehand seemed similar pregnancy outcomes regardless whether got vaccine placebo. 

As run mill side effects, think people bad detecting selection bias everybody unpleasant side effects shared making look like really nasty flu like symptoms several days shot, happen isn‚Äôt nearly universal internet would make seem. ursine mammals defecate sylvan environment. Thank China!  Idiots. excess deaths respiratory diseases 790k since beginning 2020. includes flu pneumonia well covid, testing flu cases way due mitigation. 


We 600k+ deaths start 2021, people continued get sick die large numbers two months. scientists trained roughly 150 bees Pavlovian conditioning method gave insects sugar-water solution time exposed smell coronavirus. research continues, van der Poel said scientists believe achieve 95 percent accuracy rate use multiple insects sniff sample. time scientists wanted train new set bees, used refrigerator natural external temperature cool make less active, van der Poel said. No. Literally none. That‚Äôs thought too...? anti-lockdown scumbags gloat Florida reopened explosion cases? specific concerns technology? point pandmic hearing lot people test positive say, ""I thought immune, taking precautions long time now.""

Friendly reminder immune simply virtue sick yet. Anyone ship without vaccine volition. Exactly. ships port replace ships will. Covid variant cases exploding exaggeration Man wish got older dose. Would love fly around clippy. CDC Trump, yes. Glad they're finally cleaning mess predecessors left behind. I'll given credit that, clearer direction going forward. ‚ÄúThere community without choice vaccines available it,‚Äù Camara Phyllis Jones, family physician epidemiologist based Atlanta, told me. ‚ÄúGiving options another way signaling value people equally.‚Äù

I agree part. pretty obvious we're good changing perceptions we've failed year convince people put masks socially distance. give options let people get get, whatever reasons are. (Some even prefer J&amp;J mRNA sounds spooky them)

If end much one kind another going unused, many areas world would happy take hands. one friend seems anti vaxx I'm totally surprised like little annoying. friend redneck actually got vaccine even though gotten flu vaccine ever. like there's surprise you. Cruises disgusting even covid. Couldn‚Äôt pay ever sail cruise.  one, meaning nothing publicly funded ever actually become marketable product general public take advantage of. 

You look much government-funded research actually turned products consumers could use prior passage Bayh-Dole Act. Hint: lot.  God protect stupid CDC want alarm anyone facts. /s information 18 months old cruise ship enforcing safety mandates?! Casinos, bars....the list goes plenty inbred people white criticism. Inbreeding related vaccine hesitancy. Explain France then. get Vaccine live, also. survive proclaim way best! think one thing learned significant minority population care anyone themselves. Like, point actually *dangerous* public health crisis. always assumed people like existed, didn‚Äôt realize bad. take breathing hardest? lol Come Chicago April October. trip gulf would hell trip... would it. also hard breathe boot

No aren't. takes getting used body naturally want panic bit breathing warmer air used to. like snorkeling scuba diving. hard breath apparatus, new going feel hard breath going anxiety panic bit. 

The vast majority people saying ""it's hard breath them"" experiencing anxiety/panic actually breathing impeded. Oh come on. Well one things traffic horrible many parts FL everyone moving lol  La la land sure does. I‚Äôm vaccinated still wear mask out. Masks becoming less less around us though.   people living streets, covid usually problem since density people high.
As slums, Dharavi, India's biggest slum, covid hotspot followed model worked pretty well. personal experience, lockdowns work people able quarantine (There's many people streets, gardens (which actually supposed closed lockdown aren't) etc) people able gather (or able gather sparsely). Trains, gyms, shops, malls places typically see huge crowds social distancing disappeared. Sure shops still operating usual (because bribes) crowds big usually would be. Florida opened vaccinations everyone 4/5.  people states resigned prominent positions due negative effects including threats violence loved ones confronted homes speaking truth advocating public health. Earth revolves around Sun.  Try dicks servers, get used busy lol Okay explain doctors nurses India going survive this? videos pictures see hospitals jammed packed covid patients, I'm sure circulation great hospitals. even nurses doctors get sick, PTSD many may face future? We've multiple outbreaks San Diego directly connected gyms ignored lockdowns mask mandates. Many many cases. sure gyms absolutely hot spots here. free choice one complain. end deciding vaccine take really hard though, although fantastic job.
 
Until late local vaccination center sitting AZ, one wanted appointments 60+ only. dropped priority completely si many people want it, can't get appointments anymore. tomorrow big vaccination day giving AZ everyone without appointments otherwise many doses get wasted, consider taking jab, although could wait like month get mRNA may better alternative, vaccine getting wasted, thus protecting 2 persons 1 better live Goa confirm true... entirely fault fck\*\*g government

\- lockdown namesake.. actual proper lockdown start Sunday 9th may - 26 May. almost 20 days cases started surging.

\- state borders still open visitors, High court interfere state government impose necessary Covid -ve cert entry BJP govt sitting asses.

\- mentioned Health minister article scammed money Covid aid sanctioned state buying ventilators 800K rupees/ ventillator states purchased 200k/ventillator.

\- chief minister puppet Modi government..He know anything say "" Nothing worry, fight together"" . catching virus, entire ship quarantined vacation ruined, fact turned nightmare, yet youself vaccinated ill? bet so. Oops wong sub lol. Los Angeles. Right, cdc acted alone influenced anyone high political position. Smh former Floridian think many terrible people interacted makes total sense. I‚Äôve trying tell friends family months get laughed at. year half late Might want specify city. That's vaccination social duty everyone able functional immune system. Yeah it‚Äôs baseless conspiracy theory. would expected report confirm type diabetes, 1 2, caused. They‚Äôve long history vaccines recalled due number problems going back 1970s. result they‚Äôre one skeptical nations comes scientists invented first N95 gave interview one NPR's shows last year. said personally owned 7 masks, put paper bags, rotated them. say left car begin stink, likely sum amd heat degradation. Found vaccine card downtown female friend missing their's DM name confirm. I've going gym 5x weekly since June 2020. family members too. None us caught anything. Masks required exercising state. one place pandemic felt like pandemic exist hardly people wore masks minded distancing. interior gym basically pre-pandemic.

It's pretty crazy dearth gym outbreak reports given know transmission. I've barely found reports Anglophone countries, Korea, Japan, HK-- places there's enough activity low enough surveillance effective. friend taking hike tomorrow. first step taking get back normalcy. Gotta start somewhere left Toronto end October, 1 2 weeks closed gyms 3 weeks.

From friends, never got better. said December 2019. 

I cant believe took long change droplet borne 0 symptoms. know 10-12 peoples status side effects. 3 4 0 side effects. minor symptoms. Worst person flu like day. fine - get shot. Cases [definitely dropping Florida like this! depends you‚Äôre going. don‚Äôt like here, wouldn‚Äôt say entire state ‚Äúa backwards shithole.‚Äù am, there‚Äôs people getting vaccinated, every store &amp; restaurant still requires masks, etc. thought transmitted skin contact! Controlled studies shown 80-95% protection infection re-infection, similar vaccines. assumed protection severe outcomes stronger, vaccines. small number anecdotes death second infection.

The real answer though vaccination infection incredibly effective. think masks stop us licking stuff? sure check person‚Äôs post history New Orleans, much. enough slips ships sail Florida. two similar people job telling this, honestly feel zero truth it. REALLY go faster that. Why? ok.. like 15 months. wtf? jesus many since 99% school shootings didnt actually happen

&amp;#x200B;

this comment make exhale nose tho figure years ago pretty nuts uninitiated. Fucking duh! Huh? thought announced like year ago that's wear mask? ask August July. month later would late. provide cite showing isn‚Äôt happened? I‚Äôve heard multiple people claim wasn‚Äôt fired refusing fake data, haven‚Äôt seen article supports claim. far aware continues assert asked fake data.  knew DeSantis trusted. man corrupt handle COVID-19. wonder variants explosive Sunshine State. theory extremely effective. low-dosage slow-acting AZ vaccine build cellular immunity, high-dose mRNA cause cells freak multiply. probably great get close together, waiting multivalent B.1.351 boosters could give better result (several *times* better, Moderna's ongoing phase 2 trial press release day). cruise ships stop NOLA? Mississippi deep enough get there? absolutely. like best way cheat exam understand important concepts beforehand material memorised. months recall read risk transmission fomite almost non-existent. definitely airborne could see true world general, necessarily United States. certain red faction giving green digits various organizations keep quiet avoid mass panic. Maybe since one half year, definitely since reports covid found 27 feet away original place transmission ship infection rates.  I'm surprised 5 days wait now. 7+ day waits region US especially surge last summer winter. time got results another 3-10 days that, entirely useless info. unrealistic part movie **is things hopeful end** Many people convinced peers children. many it‚Äôs sometimes worth it. risk getting vaccine me? I‚Äôm already group incredibly low risk personal experience shown body perfectly capable handling virus.

Hmm, can't answer question well. I've read people write things like ""It likely natural immunity won‚Äôt last¬†as long as¬†the immunity¬†given by¬†a vaccine,"" know data base of, can't really statistical analysis long immunity lasts virus immunity, much less comparison long virus immunity lasts vs. vaccine immunity.

I know differences *side effects* getting vaccinated vs. getting infected though. one, body *thinks* getting attacked, things create immune response, result fever chills general exhaustion. another, body *is actually* getting attacked, things create immune response, result fever chills general exhaustion. latter, body probably suffers damage since getting attacked.

You lost sense smell, means virus *did* damage cells (the virus usually attacks cells nose, mouth, lungs). people, damage much, others, damage pretty bad. ""long covid"" pretty bad people...the damage lungs may extensive lose lung capacity may never get back. friend mine completely lost ability taste certain tastes taste receptors badly damaged. yet regain full taste palate.

It seem like suffered enough damage affect time around (e.g. maybe cells healed maybe permanently damaged feel like loss lose cells). future would probably better body attacked, body attacked again, may lose cells every attack--until lose many notice lost lung capacity ability taste certain things.

Sorry mate, thanks taking time write post ask question, give partial answer. =/ norovirus stuff years back end thought getting cruise ship. new language, posted online, change agency‚Äôs previous position infections acquired ‚Äúclose contact, airborne transmission.‚Äù

Airborne means float air relatively long time relatively far distances, opposed falling ground 6ft expelled cough sneeze. Simply transmittable cough insufficient label pathogen ‚Äúairborne.‚Äù news cases kept rising, super surprising. surprising therefore news cases dropping.

Colorado Oregon finally dropping well. 50/50? would news. Thanks, Florida.   Cruises traditionally cheap warm weather trips. lose cheaper 3-5 day Caribbean cruises can't leave Miami, Ft. Lauderdale Tampa. Pretty sure felt pressure woman pinching skin actual needle. literally weeks away enough people vaccinated move past this.

You idea we're weeks away. We've weeks away year. literally dumb fucking rock believe point, even making rational arguments position lol. would hilarious react minor risks support fucking government coming forcing everyone else believe stupid propaganda believe. learned trust timelines given government haven't, supporting care basic human rights long someone convince give increased chance authority stop anyone moving around implementing public health measures know wasting venting me.

Because dumb quoting bullshit propaganda attempt pacify me. terrible person need hear understand it. supporting things destructive society responsibility tell terrible person invalidate viewpoint people stop agreeing bullshit rules, quickly stop. fucking rocket science, obv we've confirmed smart. poor little offices empty minions boss around :""( Umm care provide sources?  I‚Äôm pretty sure everyone did... LOL Yes, that's woke sister may gotten hearing problem (nearly deaf) chicken pox child (that vaccine developed) North America, Toronto lockdown longest time. One month would blessing here.  Imagine virus even deadly.  Known since january 2020. called fear monger. oh turntables. problem, think COVID still thing? really develop something less severe throughout years, pandemics develop endemics. need vaccines especially vulnerable, younger ones develope much bigger immunity, reinfected handling better, especially retracting unprepared.

The reason much dangerous lies within power duplicate within cells. use much cells potential create copies, bigger growth rate familiar exponential growth now. reason, mild covid severe explained (idk much argued came conclusion myself) too. think it: later body detects virus, bigger damage be, like taking late measures. flu slowly go 1 100 like 10 steps corona 100 8 9 steps - exponential growth kick - 1000 step 9 10. 

So body detecting fighting virus severeal hours late make huge difference. Even vaccine stops inhibits one point virus dock, really put much speed exponential growth, seems work well. way bodies adapt years It‚Äôs 88 Houston tomorrow Texas Louisiana significantly farther Eastern Caribbean Florida.

That said, I'd love see cheaper flights San Juan, Puerto Rico cruises Miami shunned.  They're moving wear masks. They'll disappointed - loud obnoxious violent - find can't get way even Florida. news, water wet... Toilet paper western concept. don‚Äôt really need it, batteries important. Good choice Matt! Oh, that's perfect. Still would prefer Mr. Burton's Neighborhood Reading Rainbow segment, though. unrealistic thing contagion lack anti-mask, anti-max plague rats demand ""muh freedom"" claim virus hoax entirely.

Basically writers underestimated human stupidity. else wearing masks, using internet explorer? Flordiaman policies causing Florida among highest COVID hospital rates country. Tell people trade car one without anti-lock brakes, air bags, crumple zones, seat belts, since despite innovations still die car crash. ...after year come conclusion...lol I'd head America months you. September trials yet finished? forget religious leaders.

Covidpositive science absolutly one base covid understanding According COVID-19 vaccines effective keeping getting sick, scientists still learning well vaccines prevent spreading virus causes COVID-19 others, even symptoms. Early data show vaccines help keep people symptoms spreading COVID-19, learning people get vaccinated.‚Äù Right. think vaccine lot number vaccine date/ location going crucial valid vaccine passports they‚Äôre hardest part fake. roll eyes people posting cards social media covering names. antivax/ vax hesitant friends take lot number, location, vax date register rightful person register.   That's grade propaganda there. things can't Michigan right now? uhh...that's one poll says all. says fewer 30 ""strongly agree"", also says 65% plan get one. COVID 19 vaccine numbers USA around Jan. rollout sped up, increased 70s, likely Japan too. almost vaccinations vaccinated around quadruple did. Weird crossover, Im it!  anything circumstance, one. bottleneck expertise + manufacturing, IP.

It's like multiple (good) vaccines, there's monopoly IP licensed out. Trump human being... get it.

There. Fixed you. Heck ya going back normal!
Just nfl draft 116 thousand coming cleveland. promising studies there's new one ongoing campuses answer question ""vaccine escape"" mean make vaccines 100% useless drops 50% efficacy threshold considered good enough? Also, vaccines still able prevent severe illness least death? Everyone get Fewer 30% Japanese people believe vaccines.  entirely true EU shouldn‚Äôt dictate what‚Äôs best developing countries. 

If EU buying huge quantities cheaper vaccine, distractors would say squeezing poorer countries, buy expensive one, dictating poorer countries ... even though EU largest rich-country donator. People want EU evil seem unable see anything comment around developing countries already procured certain amount Pfizer vaccines still waiting arrive richer countries hogging 

This makes absolutely sense, EU also waiting, everyone still waiting except UK Israel. EU using sorts vaccines, hypothetical countries, stuck Pfizer, need get whatever available proven work ... EU done initially. Florida‚Äôs leadership unparalleled pandemic preserving quality life citizens maintaining death illness rates par country average.

(it sarcasm...) That‚Äôs awful.

I‚Äôve taken every possible step since day one, watch rural American city throw extra indoor parties even poor wife worked extra shifts ICU try save local residents overwhelmed hospital.

Well faith we'd get 70% vaccinated ever did. Either way, effed up. worries mildly inconvenienced unlikely series events leads people dying can't take basic health precautions want viral incubators? LOL yeah testing numbers? Comparing apples oranges. Sorry EU, believe freedom here. mean, pretty sure delayed doctor appt statistically better chance causing harm, ok? 

Did ever worry before? I‚Äôm guessing no, post viral syndromes always existed. 

I mean you, bigger things would worry long covid vaccination personally. understand irrational fear, compulsively check tsunami routes go coast, statistically know chances ridiculously low big earthquake going happen day, makes feel better. don‚Äôt think doctors office legally answer question even every person vaccinated never going change.  You‚Äôre right posing risk can‚Äôt get it. many people really? don‚Äôt know anyone can‚Äôt get it, people know usually can‚Äôt get vaccines able get one (genuine question, trying debate)

In terms people don‚Äôt want get it, say let go get Covid. end ICU, that‚Äôs issue. mine, I‚Äôm getting vaccine avoid pretty much everyone else west soon able confusing GDP per capita GDP. country GDP hundreds. GDP per capita divides GDP country population. lowest GDP world estimated 57 million USD Tuvalu population ~12000. GDP per capita helpful giving general wealth estimate GDP population divided evenly amongst population. GDP per capita however doesnt help determining country's purchasing power. better measured GDP alone, GDP per capita. true. NACI said ok wait **up to** 4 months. many doses coming summer, one actually wait long. stop, cooped cruise ship would drive lot people daytrip people vaccinated still get sick? woman died covid despite vaccinated.

Thanks outstanding advice.  immunocompromised risk stay home. rest vaccinated population stay home too? Moderna run trials time? One group gets double placebo, one gets double vaccine, another gets one vaccine, one placebo? seems like would covered bases. Yeah know anecdotal, that's entire takeaway doses. started getting dehydration headache within couple hours first dose, would day sports sun. electrolytes roughly gallon water problems. Second dose started chugging right away. Nobody ever told hydrate before, though guidance now. wanna put vaccine roll pretty poor beginning incredibly slow developed nation. Things definitely ramping people 18 able get first dose. Lol real. Especially someone heavily relies reading people's lips, particularly loud environments. mention: I'm smiler, lot friends too! hell downvoted beyond me. really tools lurking I‚Äôve seen concerning pictures New York‚Äôs ‚Äúoutdoor dining‚Äù. looked like many locations unventilated tents, kinda ruins point. I'd listen man read phone book would like think happening, people normally respect pretty dismissive science regards covid sub really amuses denial limitations vaccine long Covid. thing matters going hospital dying.

No, really don‚Äôt want virus system shown cause long-term health damage significant portion people infected it, even didn‚Äôt ‚Äúsevere‚Äù case acute stage. you‚Äôre fine that, it. would prefer know whether people whose air going breathing taken sensible precaution immunized. still pose risk unable get vaccine. you‚Äôre going get vaccine bs reason, shouldn‚Äôt allowed socialize public. stay home fear going anywhere year selfish people simply refused even bare minimum help stop spread. stay home now. Nothing.  Children similar/less risk flu. mention vaccines going approved increasingly large swaths children coming weeks months. we're gonna enforce vaccine passports protect children, absolutely flu. Protection getting infected 100%, even mRNA vaccines, value rather high still uncertain. Vaccinated people get infected may still spread, even rate may reduced compared infected unvaccinated people due faster immune reaction . Furthermore people may lie vaccination status, mix vaccinated unvaccinated people without masks. 

Even individual feels risk low enough, risks add may slow decease cases hospitalizations society level, situation improves enough due getting closer herd immunity, risks become acceptable. Ya big new issue. People refuse protect themself want everyone else change lives sake.

You don‚Äôt get upset wan tpeooke restrict lives refuse take medicine animals infected mean reservoirs. requires actually maintains population. Fair point.


 idk. know spam real tho. im sry judgemental really frustrating failures communicate effectively sometimes. They‚Äôre saying ‚Äúnobody physically stopping driving‚Äù.

Everyone Trump Cuomo badly fucked up, CDC may fucked worst, combatting things like entire job. Nope, sticks super effective: reason herd immunity anything US can‚Äôt go school without getting vaccinated. shit. obvious year ago.

Oh homeless people trying go party !!! Somebody think !   Working hours anti mask area hospitals pandemic must rough. I‚Äôm now...10/10 would recommend Remember everybody shit United States handled COVID? Good times. India going make United States seem like New Zealand pretty soon tools 

If ‚Äútools‚Äù mean bots, yes. saying they're 50 times smaller comparing per capita vaccinations? would size country even matter then? downvoted since they've done studies already continuing so. suggesting scientific all. literally karma bus. Wait hear CDC recently announced COVID airborne! surprised, average intelligence low.

Most people follow uneducated idiots, rather educated scientists dedicate lives decades research proving validity vaccines.

Also, currently live semi vaccinated world, much horrific diseases pre 1950 common place. Ask elderly person (over 75ish) eradicated diseases seem fun. Therefore youth/middle age today see massive advantages vaccines bring. Thanks reply, I'm wife, lol. replies eased mind bit, make look forward getting vaccinated even more! America prioritize critical thinking education. really meant political, certain party whose core beliefs outside economic policies would totally blown apart real basic critical thinking skills. Hi! I'm wife, lol. yet vaccinated, I'm breastfeeding newborn received conflicting info pediatrician OB early on. Recently though, CDC said safe nursing mothers get vaccinated, may even confer immunity baby, getting vaxxed ASAP!  ... manufactured EU, US still heavily restricts vaccine exports source simply mind?

The comment looks like speculation ‚Äî says ""could be"".

No sources needed opinion.  least include US headline? always straight-assume, talking generally, mean states?  enough supply vaccinate everyone tomorrow enough solely rely vaccinations.

There would herd immunity scenario. declining cases, declining hospitalizations, declining deaths, demonstrated **herd immunity** effective means controlling virus, *what is?* 

What data metrics indicate control virus? Could run 2 studies time? 1 single dose 1 two doses? didn‚Äôt that? It‚Äôs mostly encouraging unvaccinated partially-vaccinated people also keep wearing masks. Nobody likes feel like odd person out, they‚Äôre likely ditch mask nobody else wearing one, even know really wearing it. fact piloted Utah shocking. sounds like something cons would instantly reject I'm sorry hear that. hope feel better time treatments improve. Thanks sharing experience.  one except antivaxxers expect anything 100 percent. never assert anything hundred percent effective, without empirical evidence. two days me, woke felt completely fine. also shows completely idiotic full shit people are. Even pandemic rarely occasionally saw people wearing surgical N95 masks. ever lived spent decent amount time East Southeast Asian countries seen well.

Some people medical conditions weakened immune systems use precaution. sensitive pollution. already sick something continue daily lives courteous YOU.

Regardless reason, personal freedom right? crowd passionate about??? Obviously not, talking point stupid people parrot. Question people got Pfizer vaccine.

On first dose, sore arm couple days. never really bad except bed day got 

Was second dose really much worse? expect need sit days after? I‚Äôm nervous :( get vaccine there?  Partial herd immunity still enough contact tracing contain outbreaks way, though.  issue though lot people think vaccines 100% preventing infection, case article says ""being vaccinated indeed associated significantly lower risk testing positive infection"". total doses, new people. US never came close vaccinating many new people day. highest peak ever hit 2.4 million, highest 7 day average 1.9 million.  like optimism everyone‚Äôs ability remember put things bring appropriate.

I think poisons filtered activated charcoal, sure works covid. Please push exports Latin America Africa. Deaths tell exact story. It‚Äôs testing issue. south west still remain better northeast. likely that‚Äôs weather milder. 

Not sure I‚Äôm downvoted. Okay, even scenario, need keep get second shot, make convenient wallet size people don‚Äôt lose forget put it? ordered far got ones actually delivered.

 Additionally ordered far pharma companies deliver Basically, prior infection counted first dose vaccine, you‚Äôre getting second dose symptoms first shot. absolutely use GDP/capita, cost living baseline negotiating contract/aid, especially things like medical.

Source: side trying charge country much possible medicine long time.  I'm vaccinated (over 30 days ago) took covid test yesterday, negative. think good idea everyone get tested least post vaccine, ensure protected, research impact vaccinated updated. quite interesting. two year old diagnosed type 1 earlier year, pandemic peaked here. hospital recieved 6 children newly diagnosed, within days.

Normally said, recieved maybe 5 month. didnt recieve many upcomming months, country locked down.

Maybe covid triggered it, maybe not. suspect not, sick weeks saw type1 symptoms.

But 100% something this, understand doctors, would developed diabetes anyway, point virus genes would trigger it. can't compare India December India still much population vaccinated.

Again. Without controls place they're providing good environment virus easily develop means escape current vaccinations extend pandemic globally. always around.

Covid still proven endemic population still opportunity prevent possibility. suggesting vaccines irrelevant even though data proves they've effective controlling virus.

No, I'm explicitly saying they're effective means controlling covid. Especially extreme infection rates known rate evolution Covid19.

Considering 5-10% infections need hospital care, would true mortality rate higher 1.5% good margin. Deadlier Spanish Flu? It‚Äôs death. don‚Äôt want find later kids caught Covid rare cardiovascular disorder. Take chicken pox example. generation‚Äôs parents parties get kids infected chicken pox early risk serious complications low young. Years later learn virus stays dormant whole lives comes back shingles immune system isn‚Äôt strong enough suppress anymore. Nate silver stuck baseball statistics Florida NEEDS UNDERSTAND pedophiles, mean rest US are. Lmao kidding. seriously guys, FL needs shunned. never drink bourbon scotch night. Can't alcohol one canceling alcohol causing sober whatever. Agreed. People seem hyper tune every single thing happening body vaccine. focusing almost makes severe minds. 

I‚Äôve friends side effects sore arm. others typical flu like symptoms lasted 1-2 days. miserable others back normal that. mild flu symptoms last 36 hours. it‚Äôs true need figure aren‚Äôt able scale raw material faster. Measles vaccine shown shed. rare instances, infections occurred source found vaccine-derived. Okay second C stand for, then? Yeah got mom get vaccine dad cause job brother won't... 75% family got it.. he's scared second one though let's see. friend though idk I'm gonna convince needs cause travels lot around USA Canada. Multiple organ involvement. ACE2 everywhere. Pfizer licensee, like Fosun. remember discussion random guy here, said it‚Äôs big issue ‚Äúthe wind blow droplets away‚Äù asked wind blowing direction?

That‚Äôs say people infected outdoors that‚Äôs true, it‚Äôs perfect example typical conversation regarding outdoor transmission. NH, nearly businesses still requiring masks, least seacoast region am. may different story parts state (where saw different signs last November). I'm pretty sure Faucci said one point picked 6 feet achievable goal, would prefer much distance mitigate spread. Super interesting, cheers that! saved future reference :)

Yes, share enthusiasm everything mRNA, need careful say things like internet, ‚Äúopportunity‚Äù prove platform goods administration hundreds millions doses slingshotted science place think us thought would take another decade so. in: kind ‚Äúproof concept‚Äù anyone wanted live (or live) through, holy shit science exiting. I‚Äôm guessing know mean. 

But yeah, TON regulatory subtleties play here, given complexity landscape general, never mind Covid specifically, it‚Äôs something rises level public discourse (and I‚Äôm super mindful ways talk stuff, since often misinterpreted and/or weaponized). 

Your point Novavax‚Äôs performance variants exactly kind thing hinting comes grey area around ‚Äúadequacy‚Äù - going need nuanced decisions whether simply solid efficacy data X/Y/Z variant adequate secure authorization similar efficacy implied/anticipated proven degree statistical certainty currently available vaccines. 

Based bunch not-great analogs, lean towards thinking things like indeed work favour Novavax like...but that‚Äôs definitely sure bet. 

Anywhoo, appreciate science-y insights, yeah, definition old adage/warning ‚Äúliving interesting times‚Äù! run office vote! Pretty sure Floridan policy point take put risk. people putting risk accord, honestly fault point getting vaccinated. rumors schools get state funding might able actually mandate vaccine unless gets past ""emergency use"" stage, sure true not, might state specific thing (I live PA go PSU - lot people around anti-vaxxers hear lot wall stuff, I'm sure actually accurate not)  weird world now, get voted agreeing people. free lunch. cost someone, somewhere, money produce. Woah, trying all. made judgements post. I'm 100% pro vaccine wife. think everyone get it. trying see anyone experience. Sorry asking help? virus shed mRNA vaccines. Yep, disagree FDA wants done via public meeting experts. Thanks orange buffoon previously charge politicized vaccine approvals. Yep, I'm agreeing you. live virus vaccines definitely shed. mRNA vaccines. IMHO... flu

Family friend going this. one reasons got vaccinated. Maybe leave house day safely. easier nothing all. I'll take ""Strikingly Obvious"" 100, LeVar.  don‚Äôt understand delay either. month ago Pfizer requested authorization age group, everything said would given 2 weeks. supposed given week, Monday, Wednesday?

People taking cruise going want port call drive to. board states sail right past Florida way exotic locales.  Um, no? Governments pay it. understand want. cost money produce vaccines, fact. company cannot provide free, best provide cost. instead, governments pay produced provide ""free"" people. 

The limit production vaccine production facilities, raw materials provided them. Releasing patents could result whole bunch generic producers clamoring raw materials screwing everything up. Plus quality control issues. magic button going make vaccines magically free plentiful everyone. So, I‚Äôve gym couple times test since fully vaccinated one wears mask. get wearing one cardio machine something, one wears mask anywhere despite supposed gym protocol wearing one walking around went knew would ‚Äúdown‚Äù times going.

lmao took precautions around cancer patient blamed him? Lovely people! forgetting big one. admitting virus airborne severe threat stagnant air environment indoors, **it also means schools were/are safe.**

Schools opening means society pretty much ceases function.

Sadly India people, case many health issues afflicting country. thought pick safest distance multiply 2. Yeah freaking stupid. need give benefits vaccine. Got link? cool. 

I hoping someone per county US since much better others would highlight vaccine benefit. wow kind bullshit everywhere actually! couple morons making news march 2020 italy

look dick nose P OMEGALUL RTUGAL force get vaccine stay home. done smallpox - constitutional. anyone know guys beards like shave create perfect seal? hit 28 hours second dose symptoms (just sore arm).

Yeah suuure... Uk 3 months.

Maybe Covid 21 we‚Äôll figure out.  gotta start somewhere Well sinopharm test Brazil though CDC says vaccinated people need mask crowded areas like live performance, parades, sporting events. 

They don‚Äôt rules definition small vs large are. use common sense unvaccinated people (or people sure status) means risk. draw line. Former tight end Kansas City Chiefs?! Yeah. found contact transmissions extremely rare.

The hand washing thing another flu precaution method carried over. Though admit prob know contact transmission back then. mean flying right isn‚Äôt safe? mean, way, living promise introducing people Jesus. 

If enough people get Covid, get meet Jesus *really soon* really excuse, comparing US states different size absolute numbers best metrics... think effective, two doses. problem chile EU approving Sputnik V. lot unnecessary deaths could've prevented first 3 months year approved it. need tho confirm me.  soon statistics countries proved masks hugely effective reducing transmission disease, apparent.

At least % virus reduced mask.wearing.  big events still banned, capacity limits, masks places, despite zero cases. count for? kinda nice see honestly since ever read online people awful side effects, whereas felt literally nothing first dose Pfizer. Like nothing all, barely even felt needle go in. making paranoid nurse something wrong, haha.

Anyways know side effects usually worse second dose I'm Canadian *just can't wait* wait 4 months it... Wash hands! /s  Yes Mass one highest vaccinated states. Last looked way national average. Yes.

And profound waste everyone's time.

Because care Pfizer.

I care people free access vaccines.   coach baseball team (Joe DiMaggio league) kids know get it‚Äôs laps every practice. 

I couple hesitant anti-vax parents rubbed one kid, can‚Äôt blame him. 

12/14 least first dose. half got J&amp;J they‚Äôre good. Maybe updated population data new census numbers? tracker google show dip. dont see be. cant wait leave  Hey Everyone, really looking encouragement anecdotes....My wife got second Phizer shot 2 weeks ago STILL feeling significant side effects. mainly extreme fatigue nausea/brain fog. go doctor told give month, admit seen hit anyone hard her. missed work day mine felt rough couple days, nothing like gone through. doctor mentioned seen people every day this, I'm guessing hits everyone differently people struggle more. know anyone who's effects long? Beats hell getting COVID without question, wondering anyone positive stories could pass on....Thanks.  Let's make happen. understand delay authorization. Perhaps something fundamentally different immune systems 12 - 15 year olds compared 16 year olds. support delay. Otherwise, let's get it!   Yes. That's point. everyone else picked speed time. isnt increasing pace, wont increase pace substantially end year fueled poor supply, slow distribution one highest rejection rates world mean, it‚Äôs approved technically they‚Äôre right.

Depends country. fully approved EU. mean, talking end March, places don‚Äôt rhyme Morgia Malabama still severe shortages. Manufacturing still behind schedule, doesn‚Äôt matter ALL.

I certainly didn‚Äôt anticipate fact we‚Äôd less third people first dose multiple states May due lack demand. missed whole point. really especially since biggest value J&amp;J vaccine single dose used transient vulnerable populations. government said, ‚Äúthis may dangerous keep giving homeless‚Äù would go poorly damage faith vaccines far pausing ever could have.  Also min wage laws US flagged vessels.  Flag designates labor laws vessel follow. Like ocular protection. Even liberal Reddit see lot people hating idea vaccine passport. Taking stand ""nobody check vaccine passport"" plays super well place like Florida. Personally care, got vaccine mind showing anybody wants see it, I'm vaccine passport anywhere wants implement it. Yeah thought bit stretch, wanted certain, live couple immunosuppressed people. Oh yeah! got back second vaccine! Texas Georgia... Among states.  Cant new plan never plan begin get worse predicted? ""We've told problem idea serious YOLO"" strong message either. That's essentially I'm feeling right now, mildly feverish, sore, general cold-like symptoms. Good know normal though, quite hypochondriac sometimes. thank you! unlikely. Probably saw J&amp;J products. bunch benefits ship sea loss life trumps that. Currently chance semi-rich would ship sea. Um, nobody wants AstraZeneca Two weeks. can, three weeks. vaccine administrators tell ask ‚Äúany recent organ transplants, bone marrow, etc‚Äù getting shot. 
Then tell absolutely vaccines within two weeks time. places better others info, though. Two weeks. Congrats! 

Wife works medicine helps. Feeling like shit day second shot common. did. next morning woke felt like shot. ran high fever really tired. honestly felt like sleeping. kind nice.

Maybe eases worries.

Btw, don‚Äôt understand downvotes here. people downvoting honest thoughts/concerns? Yee SinoVac one that's 50%, SinoPharm higher efficacy. Probably sides bit grandstanding Florida eventually says alright allowing vaccine checks one situation.

Makes sense come allowed check vaccinations. ""grandstanding"" would make look like fool. wonder Massachusetts specifically performing? 50+ year old American, I‚Äôm plenty embarrassed generation, too. me. want research mRNA vaccines would consider them. I‚Äôd feel comfortable type vaccine. guess may fact actually emerging common cold coronavirus would lead us believe?

I'm glad vaxxing thing existence. Yep yep :) placebo group unblinded vaccinated February. can‚Äôt ‚Äúgo bar‚Äù NYC. sit table bar establishment. spaced seating *some* actual bars, standing allowed. 

It mirror experience meeting friends bar all. really good Math logic  reason wait two weeks? country imposing longer wait? Play fire you‚Äôll get burned. they'd like ""sure 1006 people got sick time ship, probably sick already got allowed require tests Florida beforehand. Besides we're incorporated Cayman Islands immune lawsuit anyway."" wanted come back comment let know vaccines know lmao EU. week people late 50:s started getting first shots.

We're fair bit behind US bad really. We'll get soon enough. poor countries worry about, might need years get immunized.   Isn‚Äôt crazy. find asking aren‚Äôt social distancing remember going isn‚Äôt norm.

I last summer strict lockdowns still occasionally now. girlfriend got J&amp;J shot 6-7 weeks ago still small lump shot administered. slightly subsided time, sore pressed symptoms side effects. moving arm pain, visible lump bruising around spot. Early red/what looked like irritation, along light bruising. 

Is something concerned about? I‚Äôm right place, could someone possibly lead better subreddit? Thanks! I'm sure believe evolution, natural selection work. People stupid adapt crisis eliminated. Clearing shallow end gene pool, speak.  there's outbreak ship, going entire ship quarantined...

In case, Floridaman government seems unlikely quarantine cruise ship even outbreak writing laws expressly forbidding covid-testing prior cruises. Would federal government quarantining it? thought would EA September. elaborate bit this. I‚Äôm uninformed certain topic. 11 million? damn say safe?

this covid vaccine proven safe. full stop. problem vaccine hesitancy. Governor Florida take family tour India/Brazil prove us Covid-19 fake.  actually read article recently: spike protein alone able cause damage vascular cells animal model, I'm qualified napkin math subject, suspect that's two vaccines tiny chance blood clots. Gamestop thing hilarious piss-take. certainly gave nominal douches lightly participated delusions grandeur. Stop pretending medications vaccines 100% safe. part problem vaccine hesitancy. Nah moral superiority altruistic world view shunned symptoms?

It almost certainly effects vaccine. 102 temperature 6 hours. minor headache think helped pounding water.  (Lessons learned drinking.). good thing many people‚Äôs experience go back almost 100% rapidly. never 102 temperature felt almost normal 2 hours later. crazy.

Hope quick recovery well. nothing worry Right, whole [Poop debacle couple years back example flooded human waste, A/C running water, passengers left survive limited food water. Triumph given nickname ""poop cruise"" passengers forced use bathroom bags. lot historical. Florida still Spanish territory 13 colonies declared independence England. Since got added later, idea ""East Coast"" region already somewhat defined. anecdotal evidence doctors hospitals across globe. Pretty sure can't that. certainly charge higher premiums (rightly) smokers. got dumb dumbs trying tell wear stupid surgical mask even outside. fence mostly due ‚Äúlong term effects‚Äù concerns

From I've heard, important target ""on fence"" people ones already made decision even hearing evidence.

I'm doctor, take advice grain salt, like make following comparison.

* COVID-19
  * know short term effects
   * Possible loss smell, awful diarrhea, loss lung capacity (\~80% chance)
   * Possible hospitalization (\~12% chance)
   * Possible death (\~2% chance)
  * know long term side effects
* Vaccines
  * know short term effects
   * Possible anaphylaxis (Moderna/Pfizer, &lt;0.001%)--easily treatable wait 30 min shot monitor allergic reactions
   * Possible blood clots (J&amp;J, &lt;0.001% chance)--easily treatable get medical treatment experiencing symptoms like dizziness, limb pain, etc.
  * know long term side effects

&amp;#x200B;

So...your sibling gambling either way. Gambling long-term side effects COVID-19 bad, gambling long-term side effects vaccines bad. know short term side effects both, seems like possible long-term side effects COVID-19 probably worse possible long-term side effects vaccines. Incidence seems hit turning point, daily vaccination rates impressive levels there. Really good news, best wishes everyone Germany! Yep got older dose vaccine.

Im odd man guess. pretty sure know happens live better Also, California's higher case numbers basically turn amount people immunity. California had/has 3.7 million cases. That's almost 10% population immunity virus.

Oregon had/has 190k cases. That's 5% immunity virus. Half California has. counts. Yes completely agree. One country already put statement couple days ago. said pay hospital fees get vaccinated. smart move. misleading trials number people placebo group got severe disease died likely tiny making data accurate). 

Exactly. NVX-CoV2373 effective severe disease: five severe1 cases observed study, occurred placebo group. 

Five. sample size 5 severe cases. 

Just 1 two cases would greatly change calculated efficacy.  fact, even say confidence levels Severe COVID-19 like calculations....because would gigantic range.  Oh no...

Anyway I've saying since start pandemic. messaging masks terrible lot people know think surgical cloth mask protects them. pushed hard everyone least wear k95 kf94 masks back became widely available. hope still pay bunch overtime janitors fog wipe surfaces work. That‚Äôs worked really well far. Religion dying out... Literally. America bad. Slowpokememe.jpg picked full face respirator P100s several months back. Everyone workplace used got weird looks too.

you can't covid vax make MMR less effective whatever. Lol choose trust someone based what? ignore 10,000x lied, trust told truth one time?

Not trust works bro they‚Äôre battling roster spot training camp, final determining factor regarding makes team, doesn‚Äôt, could come whether vaccinated ‚ÄúYeah, would, would advantage,‚Äù Beane said asked question, hypothetically Yes!! bare minimum none done impartial third party one tub worked best moisturize get super dry. one lotion bottle quite rich.

it makes sense.. sending people schools bet. continue person ceremonies Sunday.

People learning mistakes.... AGAIN. what's alternative? give lose money? CDC done poor job handling pandemic start , first told us buy masks would hurt healthcare system wearing start .  wanted people take vaccine CDC could said vaccinated could resume normal lives . 900, 000 deaths took freaking year acknowledge virus airborne threat us figured ?

Obrigado! slide covers deaths rising falling case scenarios (R 1). situations, death rate lower prioritizing 65+. Vaccines free.

They must purchased country.

But also true N95s expensive, there's lot going around, thrown away every 3 days tops (7 new washing technology)

So everyone wear N95s one pie sky ideas  [Erectile occasional covid side effect. would ok-ish airlines temperature checks turned away visibly ill passengers.

How stupid possibly be? You‚Äôre right, since OP‚Äôs article discussing FDA strictly looking US. doubts FDA approve time. Seriously, got car sick road Hana one driving! Vaccine uptake UK would beg differ Yeah it‚Äôs conjecture. Truth is, reasons people aren‚Äôt vaccinated yet run gamut perfectly legitimate completely illegitimate. hesitate label someone latter unless they‚Äôve given reason to. fact getting everyone vaccine wants one gonna take little time. Rushing label people anti-vaxxers isn‚Äôt going make go faster.  fault refusing take shot, still insisting keep calm carry on? that. study indoor stagnant airflow, social distancing doesn‚Äôt work prevent transmission. Thanks, think factors population density. reasoning important this: New York might higher % vaccinated compared Missouri, Missouri lot less unvaccinated people walking around absolute numbers. virus still easier time spreading area higher density unvaccinated. also neurological disease. Obvious clickbait clickbait article antivax deceptive. Australia NZ hoped open back vaccine passports article shows likely possible. huge gamechanger us big news. Zero Covid strategy less 5% populations single dose vaccine, can't afford let even single positive case slip through. Except national governments powerful, actually federation. Drs allowed contradict practice work time far late word gotten out. something world beginning watch them.

They spent six months denying problem arresting anyone said otherwise. Even discovered highly contagious allowed millions move New Year N95 masks maybe, basic cloth masks. Exactly point. department said. unsure like data

Bottom line vaccine compensation program exists bc people serious reactions vaccines used many many years

Even one million people severe reactions one loved one matters

If worried would assume bad reaction please talk dr remember drs push masses bc opinion match company owns practice 

Safe most, nothing safe all, people reactions anything depends afraid  Oh dang got moderna Nick Cordero. (Just add name anyone who's already familiar.) son one, yeah. :( sad. go cruises. terrible environment unhygienic.  Lol. Good. Serves Florida right.

In US, though, always going keep R~1 mitigate. soon cases started dropping we'd push back reopening. Germany that; suppressing. Vaccinating people likely spread virus make suppression much easier cheaper. Definitely safer long acid cut mixed substances thing Seychelles used Sinopharm AZ. AZ actually lower efficacy Sinopharm Sinopharm getting fingers pointed at. Wonder works. 

Let alone leaving fact symptomatic cases unvaxxed 1 dosers. Among things.

Cruise ships actually infamous unsolved crimes happen aboard hard investigate crime scene sea guests trampling 

Not mention jurisdiction conflicts location ship vs country/state ship registered to. good news side, Bloomberg's Tracker stat countries administered enough doses cover 40% population flat declining cases, currently US 39.7%. wear mask. airborne. stats re-infections? many died infected twice? wonder safe people feel recovering/vaccinating basically 1-year data probably operate Florida ‚Äì in, port call, like Key West ‚Äì longer sail Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Jacksonville, Tampa, etc. *really* hurts ‚Äì there‚Äôs definitely money people coming land hours drinking couple quick tours, losing hotel rental cash, restaurants bills, expenses associated staying couple days before/after cruise going suck, hard.

Sucks suck, guess. seems impossible pick move traffic somewhere else. 

Too bad cruise ships can't easily moved anywhere, potentially water... Yeah, fairness numbers pretty low overall suppose it‚Äôs mostly comparison at, could worse Yup. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs also cropping up. noted women‚Äôs periods getting vaccine too. disease thats contagious *and* deadly hard come by. deadly disease kills host transmit - least much damage easy isolate quarantine. Transmittable diseases typically less deadly spread fast.

Covid highly transmittable, much deadly. Cant say every strain since we're looking double mutation means theres covid19 strain much transmittable deadly strain december 2019

Usually pandemics history 100 years apart may last one lifetime global warming, next one could much sooner. Well apart minks, documented cases spill back, far know. Vaccination become mandatory pretty much everything soon FDA etc full approval given.

The report outlines nasty disease - different acts compared common cold. believe would necessarily become harmless common cold, even prior infection, place gamble countless millions lives. Vaccine hesitancy massive issue Japan. It‚Äôs gonna rough go things there. mean margins write loss? think handle $2.5 billion loss either way??? trusting government. Except morons aren‚Äôt getting vaccinated  Oh yeah, 50% number repeated over, literally study produced 50% also said vaccine 90%+ effective serious illness... 90% ever gets picks up, 50% does... wonder primary efficacy symptomatic COVID-19 50¬∑7% (95%CI 36¬∑0-62¬∑0). secondary efficacy cases requiring assistance (score‚â•3) moderate severe cases (score‚â•4) 83¬∑7% (95%CI 58¬∑0-93.7) 100% (95%CI 56¬∑4-2100.0) respectively.

Solid fucking plan. Masks help stop droplet transmission, like flu pandemic. airborne transmission? Aerosols lingering air much longer droplets.

I think misunderstanding purpose statement maybe phrasing response bit odd. intent even state level it‚Äôs absolute. rights powers intended reserved people unless explicitly stated otherwise,

Reserving power people absolutely nothing whether state make law something, issue here. intent statement, others essentially creating process interpret crimes create laws. 

In essence is:  
Fed govt make laws regarding subjects explicitly allocated feds states make laws regarding subjects granted explicitly feds granted explicitly rights people actions/subjects covered first two inherently considered lawful.

That say, state/local law around something, federal law around something, something considered lawful cannot arrested/imprisoned lawfully something explicitly covered fed/state/local laws. 

It's catchall phrase codifies idea. also perfectly legal states laws around masks, quarantining, etc.  think NHS, honestly. centralized system wonders relative messy chatoic US situation. lawyers make lot money lot people don‚Äôt get health care law despite lucrative potential.

Thank goodness vaccines although still marathon, least stupid can‚Äôt endure ability intelligent human life progress. that, simply mean advancements discovered real heroes save humanity time history. moving goalposts. 

You asked example vaccines profit motivated delivered. Cuba multiple pipeline.

You want quibble instead measuring whether saving lives requires capitalism, decided adopt argument cannot count widely used. need word embargo sanctions want use metrics.

And also, again, I'm really interested saving capitalism. proven capitalism necessary pharmaceutical research. Yes, that's turned off. little real. I've rewatched times skip part now. need adapt lockdowns culture infrastructure place in. Argentinia covid spread slums government shutdown entire neighborhoods assisted people outside period everyone isolated tested certain period. quarantining inside neighborhood.  admit much dislike Gwyneth, gave accurate portrayal real seizure movie history.. know someone close epilepsy, haunting watch. people wonder half country skeptical CDC. done horrible job messaging. essentially common knowledge last summer. wrote. Everyone know survived ""pandemic"" flu amount times I've partying without getting it, says something.  way accommodate infected people negative pressure rooms hospitals. kept telling healthcare workers super thin surgical masks sufficient prevent transmission. implication silenced spreading true information Florida's corrupt odficals want spread. happened all. article events. back implication. Pfizer‚Äôs research budget 2020 9 billion. 2019, [8 increased research budget billion change. That's it. That's all.

It's basically normal year Pfizer. similar budget multiple years outside pandemic.

I problem capitalism... that's exactly Pfizer indefensible. Oh sweet diseased chorus music. CDC Trump, yes.

Exactly this. former administration everything could hide scale catastrophe us effort keep economy going election.

We're talking crimes humanity stuff here. Yeah, get it?

How many deaths take fact it\`s airborne?

Their reason \`just catching latest scientific evidence\` disavow accountability deaths could prevented. mean, ways, covid deadly SARS social distancing like did, pandemic would 2, 3 months tops. SARS, symptoms showed 1, 2 days tops, 30% death rate. People would fucked around that. people died ironically deadly.   Yes 6 ft workable places like grocery stores, whereas set that, people likely even try vaccine CDC guy disobeyed CDC orders. Walgreens sells home tests. One box 2 tests 20 bucks. BinaxNOW product sure CDC knew year ago lied us expediency. (A Google search find articles year ago describing Covid airborne.) lied whether wear masks thought enough masks basically tweaking lies year long give us guidance economy required.

Now vaccine admit true nature virus.  Welcome March 2020. mean people living apartment buildings? people getting exposed stepped hallway? seen kind spread apartment complexes believe fit? [You No, [see I'm dead serious. made resolution day Capitol insurrection watch anymore news rest year. consumed tons news daily various sources. watching morons scale walls day run wild Capitol halls like dam breaking me. stress anxiety bottled since start pandemic came gushing out.

 first time 30+ years felt depression, anxiety, even paranoia. First thing decided completely cut news. it, cold turkey. are, May 8th still consumed one bit news check Covid numbers trends every then. I'll tell you..I feel one thousand times better. like clouds parted sun shined again. point I'm even sure I'll ever go back consuming news level beyond basic. refreshing constantly kept fear feel like new man. math yet even get Canada's population correct, baseline calculations. kinda obvious though think it. fact institutions trusted uphold public trust shit like makes worse them. 

At point, can't blame people walking along lines. Yes, meantime, places fresh waves could face many months heavy restrictions and/or deaths vaccines quell pandemic. malicious, sure, really truly dumb. Like grandma work wearing mask knitted. terribly effective, dearie. Shaving became thing US military WW1. clean shaven face helped ensure better seal gas masks. concept considered civilian life now. Brb, gotta go shave. ""SOOO anyways shit piles way 2 story, previous high, shovelling shit probably help. mean 1.5 stories 1.25 stories higher places shovel shit. Anyways knows helps."" Math checks Yeah man remember first 30 mins felt like watching news. felt nausious halfway through, really felt like months away that.

Dont get wrong situation bad, hard imagine could worse. Covid isnt especially infectious, least compared something like measles. deadly SARS.

In another world hard imagine could rest movie actually happen. Ok but, 90 percent reduction risk spread outdoors, well 20x number cases year ago. So, still pretty fucking dangerous playing high school sports masks, even outside only. vaccine getting US FDA approval India?

All I'm saying is, businesses start forcing coworkers get vaccine, might well force get all. ü§Ø Noooo way. sounds like problem capitalism. would agree there. capitalism definitely perfect, falls short pharmaceutical industry we're talking they're spending advertising. 

even still, $2.5 billion losses, written not, readily swallowed suggest... Lucky Meghan Harry took care Piers Morgan Idk taking temps, many people really like one thing like masks - cases still rise say ""see masks shit"" infections caused people wearing them. 

Regarding temps must say checked one single time throughout whole pandemic. really think coyld useful especially beginning pandemic, several airports, crossing several borders checks measures all, despite mentioned news.

So write anything seem ineffective due lush implementation Long enough take pictures sign leave went though? mean take someone court coughing stick ‚Äúassault deadly biological weapon‚Äù? went watch movie first came demand turned beginning mother epilepsy, like begining scene. covid came around wanted watch again. like life imitated art movie.

I remember Fauci saying 70% efficacy would fucking great way back July. 

Efficacy useful viewed perspective trial.

Pfizer trial. Moderna trial. J&amp;J trial. can't really compare efficacy rates since trialed different populations different times year different parts globe.

Likewise, Sinopharm, Astra, Novavax, vaccines trialed variables well. efficacy useful respect trial groups. 

There studies recently Pfizer efficacy looking closer 80% real world spite trial efficacy like 95%. necessarily mean Pfizer becoming less effective, larger trial group efficacy less so, vaccinated groups encountering virus often. Whatever happened slowpoke meme? needs CDC labcoat retweet CDC tweets. Goa, beautiful place visited. beach party scene. Sad hear it‚Äôs tragic state.

I'd like point hundreds human cases influenza zoonotic origin make big deal correctly determine human human transmission. 1918, 1958, 1968, 2009 influenza zoonotic origin caused pandemic. last pandemic H1N1 2009, scientists called alarmists declared pandemic suggested mitigation. balancing economic growth keeping COVID cases control. One close borders cases like North Korea, quiet lot people die running money. British delusional willing listen words mad man looks like he's tango'd, easily.. fully expect hard core base supporters would likely jump bridge told would ""Make America great again"" many people also see vaccine form ""Dem dang Demo's cuntrolin' us, like robots"" type injection... hate that. know everyone infected. remember artist said pepe outv restaurants much likely get infected (though make leap causation). soaring subreddit people like cult here. ""waaoww science!! Trust science give big government rights name science"" Thanks bringing back comment. stopped getting better, get ""much worse"" guess say wrong that. millions texans got vaccine last month certainly helped.

Looking data texas DSHS probable cases dashboard: seven days following comments, cases continued steep drop they'd since January (3000 700), reversed course 7 days comment went 700 1000 held rest month. April looking better.

So guess charitably speaking get worse get better either. right direction amount. That's much better performance feared enough say probably wrong.

I expect vaccine rollout go quickly did, expected partying saw spring break. shit thought Ontario went lockdown three weeks ago? Case rates come down... see they've extended May 20. :( vaccinations picked up, that's good. Already way pandemic. I'm Hopkins lacrosse fan. We're basically two types people would count 16. sorry thought wrong first! know lot people watched last spring couldn‚Äôt bring to. bad enough 12 Monkeys (the series) Utopia also revolved around pandemics. symptoms associated diabetes? Sounds like something CDC would say. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre currently incompetent cuz shit bad last century ain‚Äôt making changes century either.‚Äù vaccine 94% effective. vaccinated get COVID, pass others, even die. Ideally, get vaccinated everyone else does, fast, transmission drops low levels everyone parties like 1999. go crazy vaccinated one else is....it make bullet proof. Sounds like heaven dude live? unfortunate can't move government completely lockdown movement. lol trending Netflix suckered Clever organization. stupid fuckers run life line rate vaccinations issue. Vaccinations began late December 2020 global average still 19 million vaccinations day. lot countries aren‚Äôt going able reach herd immunity vaccinations end 2021. heard another way describe flows like cigarette smoke. person 6 ft smoking, much smoke would inhaling? Outside breeze, much, poorly ventilated room - lot more. Actually Mypillow guy played Jude Law. hucked Forthysia. Mike Lindell hucked poisonous plant. I'm sure interview Anderson Cooper YouTube. 
Actually, I'll link it. think so? last time lockdown many died starvation forced away place work inability get proper food. scenes last lockdown awful. Indian variant fatal younger people? heard news people 19 35 age group dying. using Internet Explorer? Vaccines still highly effective death serious disease variants. can't endless lockdowns. That's, uh, bad. I've going gym 5-6 days week since last fall almost everyone wears mask, time.

You switch gyms. Also sick get part depends virus load exposed to. farther say, less virus get exposed to. many healthcare workers got sick, infected much larger initial dose. like 100 different vaccines works using different methods delivery. People really going allergic them? Covid influenza competing hosts too. January 2020 China lock - totally obvious millions people coughing other. did, although mostly include Notre Dame follow hockey. Huh guess wear masks assumed worse start virus airborne. moved shut everything including air travel. Aggressive action would saved hundreds thousands lives. look Australia New Zealand. Unless classroom know children get suck spread germs /s France's health system less nationalized United Kingdom's. France, insurance publicly owned, insurance care publicly owned United Kingdom. I‚Äôm sorry nothing link indicates cases dropping right now. suppose you‚Äôre measuring compared peak winter, link posted clearly shows us middle spike, around 800 cases per day, opposed 200 per day April. Right. Droplets primary transmitters. Airborn less likely still happens. fomites (surfaces). that's part poses pepe say surface infection concern things line cleaning groceries ""theater"". not. much less likely mean 0 risk. fast thing spreads every precaution helps. saw Anson Democrat guy last April sneeze package veggie left front hall. one win ever convince covid risk me. apply groceries. know someone annexed coughed picked nose picking something putting back shelf grab. scary thing true... Forsythia? Hydro...

&amp;#x200B;

I also watched March april last year wife knows happen. didnt know word contaigon meant pissed (We non native English speakers) Prevent? No. Reduce? Yes. Reducing total transmission still extremely good pandemic like this. sat Trump watch that

Trump: movie?

Aides: No. ...Although, one character played Jude Law might find particu

Trump: PASS. hope went okay. Big 10 14 teams, unless counting hockey affiliate Notre Dame lacrosse affiliate Johns Hopkins. Zeynep one best discoveries come dark time governor equivalent asshole wiped taking sloppy shit. US, pretty much every country. far know, well developed country island handled covid well. Seems like countries got ""F"" comes handling pandemic. doesn‚Äôt sound good. I‚Äôm imagining people turning mushrooms. now?! Wtf CDC fucked millions people listen instead decided interpret wrong way. decided become CDC push message nothing day we're still learning it. Lol 

It's public warning system manages disease control. previous administration organizations behind decided fight reality push disinformation. could big global leaders instead tried hide it. China made mistake. want secure much wealth possible protect families ensure lineage carries on.

You speak suggest stop claiming do.

*What guy talking?* honestly worked cruise ship never seen serious outbreak. American living Thailand, I‚Äôve appreciated restrictions people follow guidelines past year. feeling nervous current situation Bangkok. cases months ~2,000 day scary. West Virginia's bonus retroactive Watch what's happening Israel. literally data whatsoever. might even know within order magnitude many people India infected dying.

It's worth noting young people still high rate hospitalization - 1.7% aircraft carrier outbreak, instance. hospital care available really know mortality would age group. lot mild reinfections happening (theoretically possible low levels immunity mild initial infection), probably notice lot countries. experts think (unproven either way) vaccination higher level immunity young people way really end pandemic.

There certainly countries noticeable rate hospitalizations deaths second infections. barely even anecdotes happening. Goa biggest tourism hub India wonder government lax. Count Sweden. our""CDC"" still wary sceptical masks general public 5% uses them. Help!!! taking tb test 3 weeks getting second dose interfere vaccine efficiency? realized you‚Äôre supposed get tb test waiting 4 weeks second dose. Please help F**kin Visvajit Rane. sitting ministers state hand glove keep tourism buddies happy, thats going forward lockdown.

Ministers happy open state peak tourism months, expressing regret now? Take pince salt. care. literally yhe best medical facilities available them, thats Government hospitals, common people rely on, overloaded. 

If truly cared, would make sure Government hospitals par private ones. Addendum : click 7-day rolling average cases. 50.7% used sypmtomatic cases general basis comparing vaccines. vaccines almost 100% effective serious illlness death course use comparison measure. Well outside air exchange simply bringing pushing out. You‚Äôve got filter in-bound air, you‚Äôve got condition it. things take energy. need power fans overcome resistance filtration. higher % outside air bring winter requires heating vice versa requires cooling summer. 

You start getting far outside air territory longer meet energy efficiency requirements states like California fan energy conditioning energy exceed prescriptive limits. work around obviously nuance things start get prohibitively expensive exotic HVAC systems. mean previous pfizer vaccines wont considered FDA approved wait new ones approval? genes tied malding? Asking friend... heavily influenced China, especially US exited last year. countries world suffer mass deaths destroy economies better China. certainly knew though, take look PPE (head toe covered, respirator, surgical mask goggles stop health staff getting infected) versus countries whatever. Thank saying this!! agree! think CDC gets paid understand contagious diseases? neighboar Cambodia almost good now... :( Thank god got vax‚Äôd! think anywhere totally figured who's best vaccinate risk. 
Then ever changing realities ground. 
I think one expecting close schools probably teachers got prioritized. 

It looks like places Canada able start vaccinating evey one wants one end may. Yeah , I'm completely devastated... article mentioned, vaccine war EU AstraZeneca probably helped. feel like brought whole country together aftermath brexit lol. Even Remainers like ""the EU fucked one"". EU exported 200M vaccines. import less effective vaccines instead beyond me. think before? mean, published book, FBI watching people bought it, good them. technically anything illegal, point low hopes ability avoid drain society. Droplets comprise water vapour breath. super microscopic. Water droplets mere micrometers width absolutely hang air. every day speaking terms might confusing scientifically blatantly obvious happening 2 januarys ago people choose ignore it. country noticable rate covid reinfection? running online covid narrative variants going cause breakthrough infections reinfect people blah blah blah. even countries high amounts variants seeing noticable amounts reinfections. know seroprevalence study Brazil lead researchers think reached herd immunity turned incorrect, even that's matter documented reinfection.

Like study Lancet recently says prior infection provides protection at. 95% efficacy rate done Qatar, country deal UK variant SA variant.  ‚ÄúWe bunch post-COVID patients they‚Äôre young lungs look like pulmonary fibrosis,‚Äù De La Zerda said. ‚ÄúWe start looking transplants.‚Äù

Plus news earlier today CDC nature airborne transmission...

Not sure we're woods, yet. CDC director one person. caliber research educational material US CDC makes available free, rather remarkable. organization whole lot appointed director. often repeated rose garden event caused infections reddit, no, likely 'official' reported source [indoor afterwards. flight. wearing mask. It‚Äôs named conference hexadecimal Seems run gamut pancreatic (type 1) and/or insulin resistance/not producing enough insulin.

To point though breaking study seeing distribution diagnosis would helpful sweeping generalizations article gave. /s? Shave? stay home get wife grocery shopping N95 mask. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre young! We‚Äôre immortal! (cough, cough). can‚Äôt taste beer‚Ä¶‚Äù Anti-fungal medications simple fix. may cause severe side-effects, organ failure.

India's heat high humidity make recovery challenging. Don‚Äôt say Florida ‚Äúthe farther north go, South gets‚Äù? I've heard nothing ludicrous complaints slow rollout been. Yet major nations, we're behind US UK vaccination rate. SARS Covid caused Corona viruses. virus causes SARS known SARS-CoV virus causes Covid called SARS-Co-V2. use military pass rice goods. matter resource allocation will- need make trade off. COVAX?  January February Canada vaccine failure, record shows. don‚Äôt really give shit unvaccinated though. Kids aren‚Äôt risk, haven‚Äôt gotten vaccinated yet adult it‚Äôs damn fault. 

For immunocompromised people allergic vaccines‚Ä¶.I‚Äôm sorry that‚Äôs large enough population care. thought White House infections (when Trump KellyAnne Conway caught it) outdoor event. well, endangered species now? opinion, I've disappointed rollout province - particularly idea vaccinating teachers ""can't work home"" working home month two eligible vaccine grocery store employees genuinely cannot work home.   things true 7-day case average rose almost every day March 19 April 27. Since April 27 dropped every day. could call plateau think 15-20% drop 10 days counts drop.  water wet I'd also like go back Vegas go Spring Training point - I'm eligible get vaccine next week fingers crossed get appointment soon! DeSantis stuck idiot sandwich predicament. something clearly help economic stability Florida, appease base something super stupid like grandstanding COVID passports. understand law passed tells business can't require something like that. shoes, shirt, service. can't vaccine added list? make law forcing businesses allow people without shoes shirts? People Goa aren‚Äôt rich neither poor also. tourist state govt. loves money so.. *if you‚Äôre outdoors lol. Yeah public health officials making good case way this. Damn. state üòÇ. didn‚Äôt lockdown state depends tourism. Also casinos India. Casino money huge, practically control govt. Indeed is. Oh, old news. Fuck, got scared second. Somebody's little drone project drone business got little insider boost, was.  There's still people wearing tshirts makeshift bandanas. surgical mask cloth mask basically free days. countries 0 community transfer? Really good point Indian doctors working United States they're actually going Telemedicine medicine help fellow Indian doctors combat COVID-19 India. actually said tonight's 11th Hour Brian Williams.  Shit, saw guy wearing yellow ""NO FORCED VACCINES"" shirt day without mask I'm exactly surprised. sabin vaccine poliovirus also ""contagious"" thst live virus used become virulent strain spread fecal-orally.  it'll disaster rest world spawns variant vaccines can't prevent. we'll right back March 2020. Sure binary. reduce it. interesting things cdc: 

""The age-adjusted death rate homicide States 12-month period ending 2020 Q2 6.6, greater age-adjusted death rate 5.9 2019 Q2.""

and 

""The age-adjusted death rate Influenza pneumonia States 12-month period ending 2020 Q3 13.2, greater age-adjusted death rate 12.4 2019 Q3.""

and

""The age-adjusted death rate unintentional injuries States 12-month period ending 2020 Q2 52.5, greater age-adjusted death rate 48.0 2019 Q2."" think another thing childfree people picking slack parents kids remote learning. really sucks everyone. Droplets mean surfaces only. Droplets hang air, fall. Aerosols (aka airborne) hang air much much longer, like smoke. smoke vs mist, we're realizing COVID-19 kinda between.

The terminology little confusing. ""Masks better protecting others"" type wrong messaging detrimental U.S. early on, continues today. Masks absolutely protect wearers, maybe much others. think doctors nurses wear masks hospital, protect patients?


The truth probably something like this, masks form short supply due people buying hospitals needed every piece get. CDC probably thought saying ""masks protect wearer well others"" would make mask shortage even worse hospitals, de-emphasized self protection part.


The problem basically lied Americans. *They went far announcing multiple times Americans recommend general public wearing masks time.* Absolutely criminal. make people trust wear masks later on, told wrong misleading messages begin with, give reason doubt you? Long term, gave fuel anti-maskers.


They told Americans truth. Tell us true nature virus, airborne. Say masks critical reducing virus spread saving lives, country short supply them, need stay home save hospitals become available. Also ramp domestic mask production.


There much incompetence many levels. Jones challenge state's data cases, deaths, hospitalizations, testing, used data state dashboard.[15] initial allegations amounted disagreements method state computed test positivity rates,

Yes, FL counting every single test administered negative negative result positivity rates case tracking, time counting multiple positive tests person once. 

So end situation lot people testing daily multiple times per week, every single time test negative getting logged test used compare positive results, again, counted single time even person also tests positive multiple times. 

They artificially deflate positivity rates artificially inflate testing rates. choir singing super spreader freakish happenstance! See, air vibrated right amount keep water droplets suspended! Ya gotta believe me! P.2 descendant P.1; common ancestor B.1.1.28. news confusing, since talk P.1.1. descendant lineage-defining mutations say are, also articles saying P.2 (incorrectly) calling descendant P.1.  P.2 also pretty old (older P.1).

But think know answer question, regardless. Feel weird right every aspect beginning (distancing, contact, masks,etc). don‚Äôt feel smart, feel scared sad many people were/are stupid get heads around something simple especially ‚Äúexperts‚Äù Dude, [Trump privately knew severity yet still acted way did. People sure value things way.  think due exposure different media different languages. lot anti-vaxx sentiment French language media, people believing sorts conspiracy theories France, example myth mRNA vaccines cause infertility. Sure, doesn‚Äôt affect elderly people, still negativity around vaccines impact language spill French speaking population Belgium. issue people lower level education income harder reach vaccination campaigns. especially case Brussels. noticed thing Germany, sending mobile vaccination trucks certain parts Cologne big cities. I'm doctor, 90 low. Good care physician I'll thinking tonight. happened exactly Cambodia? 

(Though fair, we're *that* complacent - still reasonable community testing rate. Still, outside Auckland there's Covid community year, lot people bother barest suggestions requirements currently have). post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Many covid-positive kids asymptomatic. feel unwell, reason stay home. Plus, masks curbed spread illnesses, kids gotten ill lot less.

The issue one single asymptomatic contagious kid infect several classmates, also asymptomatic bring covid home. And, without regular testing, find silent outbreak grandma ends ICU. Mocking another commenter fair sentiment certainly dragged couple cruises child. one got sick. It‚Äôs really ~~realistic~~ optimistic possible outcome movie concerning pandemic that‚Äôs gotten bad.

Dude ignores think finds way reliably cultivate virus studying, eventually allowing scientist find vaccine months later. Virus killed every medium something.


I watched march20 details get bit fuzzy...ironically calmed since obvious nearly deadly. Interview screenwriter couple days ago, might find Yea. Would've made comment long list failures.

Point being: there's line, selling overpriced jade vagina eggs claiming they'll heal ridiculous way cross people. snakeoil, unethical, enough stop enjoying good at. Thank you. feeling crazy reading this. People even forget one point, ordered report CDC new cases. People seriously forgetting charge last year encouraged misinformation. they're seriously seen source trusted. guess can't comment without breaking political rule...

I'm taking new administration, finally report things better. tried little support got. Yes stop surface cleaning theater now? British state geographically centralised functionally contains significant structures independent power led non-political (or least party political) experts.

Obviously NHS part state structurally lot independence means associated people‚Äôs minds current government.

Likewise, politicians gave enormous deference independent agencies like MHRA committees like JCVI respectively approve vaccines set vaccine priority. equivalent Macron giving opinion efficacy vaccine.

Even government‚Äôs scientific advisors SAGE part government employees felt free share positions certain issues public.

All together allows faith system whole depend one‚Äôs views Jupiterian central figure politicians specifically. would love see source latest scientific evidence they're referring to. don‚Äôt climate control ships, climate control container (air sea).

And medical/vaccine shipments require extreme temperatures typically packing box/container dry ice. Ireland one cohort uptake 102% people thought. administration spend three years dismantling destroying every government institution, surprise every institution becomes failure face actual challenges. duh Sounds like house whether there‚Äôs pandemic not, lol. Also systems won‚Äôt work without power anyways. bands? cAn'T bReAtHe CoVeRs NoSe Yeah, definitely disagreed Fauci's messaging there. said 'masks effective', honest said: ""reserving masks hospitals effective stage pandemic, feel free wear home made masks, might less effective could help."" clip fauci floating around internet undermining mask mandates globally.

He might've thought white lie right thing time, huge downside. man hope so! many favorite bands gonna tour 2020 favorites released dope albums 2020. things would sweaty mosh pit summer. :/ assume every Japanese train packed brink less train = less people. Making public transport worse could encourage people take car bike.  news: water wet They‚Äôre important - home automation systems require batteries UK health secretary... based response it. joke.

I‚Äôm seeing big need batteries. 

I guess radio could important, I‚Äôm still seeing pandemic takes power. elaborate please? Well, CDC...it took year figure out. Idiots. Airborne? say? 
And there's wondering put face mask ever I'm outside home. 
Phew, relieved made right choice. read article, must say it‚Äôs example good journalism. Super controversial Australia experts refuse consider possibility ‚Ä¶ still big deal. day, one French ministers saying they're working hard distribute supplies someone first appointment home second vacation. mean, guess increases compliance...? Yeah agree you. past year taught everything need know stupid people are. every way someone screw whats done Errrr don‚Äôt go send thoughts prayers instead /s way previous administration politicised things definitely affected much people trust going forward. example specific thing: even thought mainly spread droplets, functionally that's essentially spreading airborne, fact, that's briefed Trump beginning pandemic. crazy they're changing advice publicly now. *India entered chat.* comment higher up.

Was incompetence around purpose actually ‚Äúcontrolling disease‚Äù.

When said, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt wear masks time‚Äù shocked. made zero sense. strategy ‚Äúnot create shortage ppe medical personnel‚Äù could honest said, ‚Äúlook, need cover face anything right now. cloth, bandana, shirt right‚Äù. 

If came new strain airborne HIV even thin barrier protection like bandana might prevent getting Face AIDS people would wearing underwear face working together stop spread.

You got opposite. Everyone other. Fighting virus kills 500k people. 

So plan next deadly virus? need give us plan now. 



Again, incompetence purpose. upper limit particles able float actually 100 microns, five microns, generally thought. whole article worth read. makes lot sense Let us, bunch people without PhDs virology, pathology, epidemiology explain much CDC fucked stupid incompetent are. totally understand hurdles against. amazing, thanks! shit. closing beaches probably stupid idea huh? noted year ago Italy. speed, wouldn‚Äôt surprise Canada first western country fully vaccinate majority population. month already hit 70% mark US set July soon thereafter start giving 2nd doses, potentially done small number weeks giving enormous supply Pfizer Moderna. J&amp;J released help too. people freaked Ebola patient managed fly US. Ebola relatively easy contain, could've dealt minimal measures.

I know much bad faith driven political motives, able judge risk properly, shows people's opinions allowed amplified media. would also add India Brazil well. vaccination rate nowhere close US. Still relative good compared western outbreaks. Isn‚Äôt ‚Äònot spending time get vaccine‚Äô definition stupid? better Americas past America better future vaccinated recovered. really much different dorm room. said, maybe throw cruise sickness rates. Contracting covid surfaces likely, worried, wash hands touch face. things handling cash worth even without risk covid anyway. give state art technology away Russia China? You‚Äôre alone. anxiety depression gotten worse too. Don‚Äôt forget also claimed mask weren‚Äôt effective protecting virus mask shortage. 7 months pandemic officially ‚Äúrolled back comment.‚ÄùüôÑ Perfectly balanced little late! summer, poll found 75 percent Americans 71 percent British people open taking vaccine one existed recommended **government**. 

The key word **government**. Brits trust government Americans, government telling us take vaccine - *NHS*.

In UK notified eligible get vaccine NHS, book NHS, go NHS hospital, NHS doctors' office NHS vaccination site get vaccinated.

The NHS trusted brand. part state, seen political. NHS institution trusted doctors, nurses healthcare professionals working public interest.

Anti-vax arguments compute NHS side debate. **If vaccine ""dangerous"" would NHS giving out?** ‚ÄúFirst all, start working bank.‚Äù  Exponential growth issue here. Stay safe! reason treated seriously SARS people think 0.1% chance dying (or whatever is) acceptable risk somehow. virus morbidity SARS MERS (was around 50%?), they'd contained shit it.

This virus sweet spot exploiting terrible people assessing risk exponential math. That‚Äôs way works. outside vast infinite area viral concentration goes zero near instantaneously. virus doesn‚Äôt clump together viral friends morph something like targeted missile aimed nostrils. 

You don‚Äôt need put tripping hazard front deter runners. causing danger them. mention, aren‚Äôt vaccinated point? takes near zero risk zero. making movie consulted real scientist it. said if.  Ah Florida land stupid ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è batteries fit ass too. 10/10 Matt! They'd much valuable if/when mains power cuts guess? torchlight dark nothing else, also good radio, walkie talkie etc. since I've seen can't recall utilities still reliable movie though. Obviously. guess made statement beginning would set fire cities start massive orgies. really like comment. true, funny, well written... Really nice comment. Eh, super spreader event probably indoor reception outside ceremony. thought established new variants deadly? Belgium single healthcare system clear branding like NHS?

I think us Brits trust government all. *do* trust NHS vaccine rollout explicitly covered branding.

A lot anti-vaxxer messages work Brits seems nonsensical NHS, institution trust, would go along anything risky malicious. may UK, Spain similarly high uptake (e.g. 98.6% over-80s received least one dose. region literally report 100.0%, left get rounded zero!) people especially satisfied stumbles low speed vaccination program. possible good vaccine confidence without factor. Lol wtf Flashlights, radios, things like integral staying connected alive situation maybe something like pandemic weakened ability respond another incident extreme weather (*cough* Texas). tell maybe hundred thousand died starvation last lockdown. point would worth risk go back lockdown since dying everyday Covid. British government framed vaccine drive something patriotic. emphasised *British* vaccines speed *British* vaccine rollout source national pride. Getting vaccinated (and certain extent, obeying recent lockdown) characterised something individuals could help country. Right beginning pandemic, powers made effort invoke wartime spirit came fighting virus.

Anti-vax attitudes started thought vaguely *un*patriotic.

The EU's cockups disgraceful behaviour regards vaccine war godsend regard. lot help narrative.

Politicians US could learn lot this, although doubt current administration would seen sufficiently sincere eyes demographics persuade. It‚Äôs outside vast infinite area concentration exhaled infectious virus goes zero near instantaneously. Add wind dispersed even quickly. 

In contrast, inside without ventilation virus concentration increases infectious people breathe out.  infectious person like point source gradually increasing concentration infectious virus could breathe in.

Add ventilation give virus way diluted more. facts combined effort, biontech moderna license upenn. closely connected tho ofc one biontech execs upenn professor table bottom Sad last us noises  70% fully vaccinated Yukon. restrictions get vaccine based age health. family friends gotten second shot.
 opening travel restrictions 25th May. media trying make look bad they're opposite they're saying getting results?  Good Canada kind pointless comparison? doubt makes difference. probably makes feel safer, beneficial. gonna get elevator, gonna get riding someone sick. rides later, elevator probably infectious. Plus someone sick could ride elevator literally right clean it. way know. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt make sense.‚Äù

Logic necessarily accompany greed pride. There's huge bandwagon people blame Justin anything everything. take one ""high risk"" postal codes? 


Hamilton still booking 50+ areas :( There‚Äôs little change day day life? 1/100 chance get pulled getting replacement officer know license. 

People forget ID home time nothing happens typically side effects first injection. Stop testing yourself, you‚Äôre causing anxiety. 

‚ÄòUsing data published study Pfizer vaccine, Public Health England determined vaccine efficacy 89% 15-21 days dose 1 ‚Äì dose 2 day 21. range 52% 97%. days 15-28, first week second dose, protection first dose estimated 91%. range 74% 97%. second dose would expected confer immunity within real question is, happen earlier? Super Variant? got nothing back up, seems media trying make look bad they're opposite they're saying getting results? China's Taipei benefited rest China's response COVID. Clearly USA ignored much information could. personally know 3 people died, 2 50s neither immune compromised overweight smokers Disantis guy...he knows he's doing!  ///////s think long suspected never proven. studies like droplets fly mouth long virus remain alive suspended lab. conclusive basically making educated guess.

I would assume changed guidance got facts, new studies completed something. web site say. jOe RoGoN sAyS FlOrIdAs gReAt pretty clearly *Diamond Princess* New York City.  Absolutely would probably take outcome like worse convince deniers pandemic needs taken seriously it‚Äôs late everyone fear everyone.  takes long time analyze critique research adopt airborne travels air. needs able remain air extended period time, infectious levels, able cover extended distances qualify airborne. need examine cases means transmission illnesses airborne. Herd immunity kicking Can't drive, seems like that's worse...  And, know, able drive... Private businesses whatever policies they‚Äôd like. know couple literally flew US get it. That's thousands dollars least. Americans throwing away. Pfizer one expensive option favoured developing countries. this, EU frees lot cheaper vaccines affordable markets. time, EU Germany invested development Pfizer vaccine, makes sense.

In words, ""rich twats"" right thing, usually case EU.  really fuckup came bad management. 1/3 America still thinks Democrat Hoax Masks Take Freedom. 

Oh, remember pumped Hydroxychloroquine, said could use bleach inside us?

Never forget gov lie masks start sandbag healthcare workers, Trump got rid strategic stockpile. Yukon, around 70% fully vaccinated (both doses) ill opening travel restrictions 25th. CDC gutted leadership scared compliance last administration 
It‚Äôs late least backbone brought back Downtown Ft. Lauderdale packed tons people masks Cince De Mayo fuck? literally linked factcheck.org article budget.  Guess what. *You* one rich twats. people want next thing *told* keep safe

and next week, something else... said think government *or* corporations power determine gets participate society. It‚Äôs really new information though. We‚Äôve solid evidence year. [There‚Äôs steadfast refusal acknowledge whatever reason. yea didnt say beginning masks barely helped?? first told us buy masks would hurt healthcare system wearing start 

I maintain still correct, awful job explaining people. Instead telling truth, lied. reasoning real. supply chain handle it. still barely can. Except that‚Äôs did. took year tell us could go outside without mask. going outside start.   homeless, poor elderly people without smartphones? going digital app allowed places? phone dies layover? can't prove vaccinated. Ugh. feel right (and pro-vaccine). 

And they've already showed vaccination stop spead it; lowers chances getting sick like vaccines get herd immunity. feel like way track people without changing privacy laws. wash hands, dont touch face 10282174 times.

There need wear ski goggles. somewhat effective expected work long periods indoors significant numbers people. Even fitted N95s exposure limits. don‚Äôt need license everywhere go though. Nobody asking see it, unless it‚Äôs bar DMV. vaccine passport, making seem like you‚Äôll show wherever go, whether movies, Walmart, restaurants.  ""Political speech removed"" 

Wow, selective. comments full people referencing Drumph. remove too. sick seeing people keep inserting name every comment. means masks 6 foot thing little impact transmission (as empirical evidence shown while)

The implications huge economy terms ‚Äúsafely open‚Äù agree. Trump corrupted every institution could intentionally undermine weaken democracy. owner Putin. 

Also STILL happening. panhandled  find time get new one, little nothing changes interim. minor annoyance buying beer. still get gas station grocery store though. crore. fall right side political spectrum can't life understand people side absolutely refuse wear masks, get vaccinated even acknowledge pandemic. fucking insane. can't value ""muh freedom"" safety problem police forces control. also people like left seems shitheads mayority right. Canada absolutely fucking rails right never ending lockdowns idea what's going on, realized covid spread primarily driven behavior prioritized freedom last summer. Since then, states locked us done way worse sure shocked see I'm sure I'll get banned fair bunch unfortunately. Like many south, amount covid deniers area (and feed) staggering.

Some people Trudeau/Libs matter what. turned entire identity. virus enters body starts multiplying. body turn starts trying kill it.

Higher initial viral load means higher final viral load body needs fight finds right way kill it.

How much matters varies greatly person person. gotta get ‚Äòem they‚Äôre sleeping Canada 400k today. Twice much Netherlands comparison. think comment understood. certainly directed anyone forum involve 'incivility'. big deal. I'm happiness getting along. Same.   True want moderna stonks keep rising help understand relationship global warming pandemics? global warming would mingle population groups climate refugees seek countries? Pillboi there's wildly different variants increase reinfection risk, might logic introduce something could increase spread. But, think vaccines distributed going shown effective variants, that. Half half, least. lot people time, maybe ability, keep news. necessarily fault. order enough people right things protect others, clear messaging absolutely necessary. frustrating widespread damaging corruption is. Humans best amazing could achieve truly amazing shit (like developing multiple vaccines novel virus year using cutting edge technology). 

So shitheads end charge? true countries across globe needs fixed. literally coworker tell going get vaccine ploy government get address social security number. insane oblivious people are. Every day since began scour Internet find what‚Äôs happening India continue horrified humbled find. want express overwhelming feelings have, fear, sadness, anger simply words. experiencing unthinkable.  I'm speechless. coffe shop? Yes, Swiss cheese model. cloth mask still reduces particle/droplet flow. two people wearing masks properly suitable distance apart negligible risk. rely one measure, inadequate. Help? EU isn‚Äôt asking help exports US EU, don‚Äôt need that. It‚Äôs countries outside EU.

Nobody addressing point point invalid first place. Oh believe me, blame politicians well üòÇ sadly I‚Äôm sure even come already barely know scope suppression intimidation campaign trump waged CDC. It‚Äôs quite scary. Canada also ratio ignorant cultists think hoax. NJ? Give world need. kids Qanons refuse. implied Texas/Florida could go way India.

Texas - 39.4%

Florida - 43.5%

India - 9.7%

You can't ignore discrepancy. agree you. Hospitalizations younger people deaths really tell whole story especially without data. Go read posts r/COVID19positive however find plenty accounts younger people dealing sorts COVID-related health problems. almost none fatal, many long-haulers serious ongoing health issues. think research needs done area real data. don‚Äôt need to. enough still exporting metric shitton.   conspiracy theory, evidence Florida lied numbers. It‚Äôs debunked many times countless data scientists, sure, believe bunch conspiracy theories. Yup, got vaccinated participate vaccine passport. someone require proof go there. Eversource delivery charges! Sure, couple weeks media found something new make world sick worry. Nope. Ended three months ago me. Everyone else fun scared movie came high school didn‚Äôt watch till last summer husband wrapped series. movie completely different I‚Äôd minds eye past 20 odd years. friend said last year: ‚Äúwhat humans virus planet earth, Covid way fighting back‚Äù

I like ‚ÄúMaybe. that‚Äôs depressing contemplate.‚Äù absolutely protect wearers, maybe much others.

This true also needs qualification. N95 KN95 masks, properly fit, extremely effective. surgical mask tight fitting 2 layer cloth mask reasonably effective. surgical mask tight fitting 2 layer cloth mask better nothing particularly good. single layer poorly fit cloth mask favorite sports team logo bought gas station effective all, neck gaiter bandana improvised ""masks"" lot people wear. Even posted nuance - lot people incorrectly leapt correct premise ""N95 masks must properly fit work"" incorrect conclusion ""if professional trained fitted N95, better equally poor fitting cloth mask"" nonsense.  25-61% yes one scary things Coronavirus family. mutate new forms reinfect people. people don‚Äôt make decisions based math. brains didn‚Äôt evolve way. educate rise base emotional responses. tiny poo particles

I believe scientific term farticles. lol, side Turkey, government refuses offer Biontech buy vaccine near-cost (due goodwill Turkish founders) use intermediary companies cahoots profit life-saving vaccine. It‚Äôs 900 millions extended 1.8bil. it‚Äôs booster shots 2 years plus possible shots variants concerns. means everyone would get booster shot year possibly extra shots variants require specific modified shots. allowed donate sell whatever extra guess.

I could excited!!! wear blue one (like ones give hospitals) N95‚Äôs company supply. Probably made cotton. Makes sense. I'm Pasco county. Chick-fil-A outlets. None employees wearing masks. International Mall tampa 50/50 mask compliance yesterday. PT correct doesn‚Äôt need quarantine unless symptoms. wife vaccinated? super low chance would catch it. isn‚Äôt, still low chance PT probably didn‚Äôt catch also likely wouldn‚Äôt spread even catch it. could forget incorruptible bastian justice stay safe well! wife vaccinated? know seems like reddit crowd media far concerned variants virologists.

Good Man, that's awful. I've Goa. Really beautiful place friendliest people. unrealistic part decided people get vaccine near end--just random bingo number style pick birthdates. That's strange way nation-wide vaccination attempt.

Kinda wish bracelets like got sometimes though. get gold? point proving? make even remotely thing comes effect humans. Everybody comments apparently ""expert"" knew along, course based anecdotal bs, still knew CDC come reddit asked redditors. need actually studying things. EU (population 448 million) going 1.8 billion *additional* doses? rest world? point reduce places get shots least enforce booking system. Hearing vials filled perfectly good doses wasted breaks heart wait least another month live, also people won‚Äôt shot even year. Hopefully Biden right thing allow Pfizer, Moderna J&amp;J export vials US demand for. Yeah, too. knew droplets traveling room room board cruise ships. I'm still convinced they've known whole time want freak people masks really effective.

I wore reusable respirator p100 filters exhale port filter time needed go semi-crowded public locations whole year. Like grocery store, places. Yeah, got looks since care people think me, continued wear it. 

When single use n95s started coming back Amazon, bought use cloth mask. good p100 respirator, much easier communicate. Also, I'm fully vaxxed I'm little less worried airborne transmission. Still wear n95 double mask public though. already two good ones recommend.

1) Frontline - China's COVID Secrets Totally Control (Alex Gibney) use battery operated bidet course. still spreads surfaces. anything Covid taught me, it‚Äôs continually massively underestimate dumb people are.

Ah look substance personal attacks. middle man ? fucking dear ! antibody tests check antibodies spike protein, vaccine produces. took test tests antibodies parts virus return negative regardless whether vaccinated. iirc Manaus, Brazil believed number around 60% new topic, name laughing here.

- Enclosed spaces inadequate ventilation air handling within concentration exhaled respiratory fluids, especially fine droplets aerosol particles, build-up air space. 

- Increased exhalation respiratory fluids infectious person engaged physical exertion raises voice (e.g., exercising, shouting, singing).

- Prolonged exposure conditions, typically 15 minutes. CDC CA data far, &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;1% persons vaccinated tested positive

Genuinely curious, thought mRNA vaccines ""95%"" effective. turn way less 1%? 95% mean something else? Like ocular protection, man, can't read? ^^/s

(To TP: use words used previously define trying say.) I'd like go one Antarctica point, that's cruise I'd ever do. would definitely want passengers vaccinated.  many developed longcovid?  government telling us take vaccine - NHS.

The Queen also got wheeled tell people get vaccine. *two* trusted orgs, monarchy NHS telling people get jabbed. actually don‚Äôt disagree - point waiver make possible create doses developing counties, ingredients exported countries. US simply let countries like China buy materials mass produce copycat vaccine - makes sense, China normally willing pay much western countries raw materials. 

BioNTech licensing technology countless producers already developing world producing cost. material ingredients supply improves, able supply huge chunk world population. seeing 82% figure? want read it.

Also, gears work modestly well dense cremation smoke India right now.

Kids throwing her, adults aren‚Äôt social distancing, get close contact kids can‚Äôt wear masks, she‚Äôs already planning quit end year. Luckily family afford many teachers forced risk lives everyone thinks need schools open. believe countries world ought discuss topic waiving IP case pandemic. true waiving IP change anything short medium term. 

From understood IP waiver (correct I‚Äôm wrong) means anyone manages reproduce exact formula let‚Äôs say Pfizer/BioNTech allowed manufacture without pay royalties. force companies share fabrication process. Meaning labs world would first reverse engineer existing vaccines figure manufacture think mass production. would take months years, solving current urgency see India amongst others. 

Lifting block exports vaccines vaccine material however could immediately impact, tomorrow. 

So case EU right say IP short /middle term solution would better prioritise exports. 

That said, EU‚Äôs position clearly sign big pharma saying: protect interests, protect come back manufactures. 

And believe IP waiver conversation happen, least mechanism place similar situation would happen future (it could help dealt start different sides already discussed done stress emergency situation). mean US, right? EU already exported 200 million vaccines. far understand, France stood 100% behind purchase, questions. don‚Äôt think France ever intended block anything.  Yeah, kinda weird. it‚Äôs first real-time experiment Coronavac vaccine, I‚Äôm real curious experiment goes.

""We're advising wear masks time"" - early March 2020

""If scarf towel anything, wrap around face"" - late March 2020

Oops Here's bigger problem: idiots. many people see even cover nose mask? among many millions people way permanently damaged this. knighted, humble opinion.  Brazil actually better expected. already administered 50M doses surpassed UK doses administered. Impressive considering UK started vaccinating December started almost February.

Now pfizer doses coming coupled vaccines, Brazil totally vaccinate everyone eligible year. article bs. One morons friend mine who‚Äôs engineer raw intelligence anyone I‚Äôve ever known. also hates woke people and, association, liberals. 

So, he‚Äôs refusing get vaccine reasons. sarcastic? really need /s that. many people believe garbage. I'm totally convinced hopefully ever find ""~~Canada's~~ Australia's vaccine roll biggest failure modern era""  Imagine trying hard news like becoming commonplace, one reasons could due fact people getting vaccinated, hence probability ineffectiveness increases. 

But let's face it, vaccines guarantee total immunity point.

Extent efficacy + side effects luck draw. reliable entity Headline still pessimistic. actual number stated 0.04% 4 10,000 unvaccinated. number go higher time passes, still go get shots.

Peter Sandman, mostly retired risk communication expert, along wife Jody Lanard, published series emails earlier year reply Maggie Fox, science writer editor works CNN papers. think really enlightening explaining CDC fell hard pandemic. [http://www.psandman.com/articles/Corona44.htm](http://www.psandman.com/articles/Corona44.htm)  still happening enough people, think Yeah I'm truck driver experience people already got first shot, I'm essentially forced schedule sick days recover vaccine case also can't move arm much couple days.

That needle phobia try think much about. I'm probably behind couple regular vaccines it. certainly agree that‚Äôs problem, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs cause given nasty look (still common bay) outside without mask given recent CDC guidance mention framework this, areas outright banned (with coming seems like), numbers already tanking making passport redundant.

It's simply policy workable.

 Businesses implement it, pain ass much easier tell every employee vaccinated.. 

people use private gatherings trust others lunatic asking see everyone's vaccine passport going ostracized..

Domestic travel already implementing massive cost..

And see many large gatherings like baseball started begin people without passport? There's reason add later..

Couple even progressive areas going mandate (because can't really afford cost enforce it) left like what? School international travel? things actually framework require vaccines? becomes another shot record enroll school, checked everytime, becomes another vaccine yellow book going another country.

No one cares vaccine passport right now....people businesses going care 2 months numbers even lower now. They're conclusive, tell us something.  Apparently people don‚Äôt phones and/or internet access apparently means one able take advantage technology obvious things. anyone think may another surge winter? Wokeness wokeness. friends SF want  That's awful. get severe case did? wear seatbelt may never get accident?  rich countries will, it‚Äôs matter time.  understand logic, need look provided potential confirmation theory. 

But things like viral load HC workers get rather slower immune response called ""immune imprinting"" due exposed greater number pathogens? mention they're often stressed overworked. true, would expect similar things teachers get COVID regardless they're remote class. That's worryingly soon true. Source? Dear god please  completely missed point. completed quarantine period Turkey instead UK save money. There's way could brought virus Pakistan. New York situation first wave too. basically raided authorized use

This dishonest interpretation situation. username password use gathering data. figured access emergency messaging system even though supposed decided use push agenda. access removed shortly thereafter. small portion population cannot get vaccinated medical reasons.

The concerns passport temporary used stuff like going grocery shopping.

At point, enough people become vaccinated natural immunity flames out. ones refuse take vaccines? may end killing chance might ending restrictions, masks included. Herd immunity won‚Äôt possible due good portion people refusing get vaccinated it‚Äôs good see J&amp;J also exported US EU. Interestingly US J&amp;J doses far know made EU US plant issue - emergent plant approved EU doses used here.

I went bit outside topic there. point many key ingredients materials vaccine production restricted export troubling production elsewhere IP protections. None charged anything. much faster 6 months. vaccine, EUA widespread use make unlike anything previously approved FDA. Actual vaccine uptake across EU 80%+ Hawaii strict testing quarantine rules dont they? new information **has significant implications for** indoor environments, **workplaces particular,** Dr. Michaels said. need better focus good respirators people close people long periods time,‚Äù Dr. Milton said. **‚ÄúA surgical mask**, even it‚Äôs tucked edges, still **not really going give enough protection you‚Äôre meatpacking plant** elbow elbow day long people.‚Äù

To protect American business interests. dying disabling way, finally ready introduce science workplace safety guidelines. introduced earlier, corporations might held accountable even *pay money* mismanagement mistreatment. France already donating WHO. vaccines flown regular cargo airplanes. Currently Pfizer example made 3 countries manages beautifully ship doses around world.  Thank you. No, all. I‚Äôm mean spirited!! studies **suggest** vaccine works.

Where's *proof*?

/s Rich countries stockpiling vaccines poor countries even buy open market. great strategy!  severe covid infection covid vaccination like sars mers, like previous coronaviruses. single (severe) infection sars believed still give immunity 18 years ago, although antibodies began declining years. Antibody decline covid infection appears around antibody half-life. phase 1 trials, booster shot 6 months gives substantially higher antibody levels original vaccination.

Some related basic though, asking every business bouncer door.

I'm tired hearing ""basic"" ""simple"" covid mitigation measures are, no, they've upended life.

And asking businesses enforce policy give shit enforcing we're endgame. openly said television push old people cliff failing economy worth death somehow

keep mind pushing somebody cliff infinitely humane way people covid die Thats nice take u left lot context. Nyc lost 30 thousand people first 2 months testing. time shut late. Since nyc lost 20k. Florida lost 34k texas lost 50k warnings nyc gave nation. Canada Mexico also receiving millions doses AZ USG. see pessimistic, vaccines already showing effective reducing spread even 50% population vaccinated. gonna likely booster shots coming around time well.

Are saying 82% Ireland's population age 34? rural NY college 60% students opted get J &amp; J offered it, maybe 10% going elsewhere get different vaccine.

I think it‚Äôs important note federal government stated consistently always going case. Despite offering timelines forecasts consistently exceeded, chose pretend catastrophe. Fully vacinated know fact? stories ppl vacinated getting covid friend friend stories. Uh, 7-day average infections per capita higher northeast south west. risk group group? 

Because vaccine prevents severe cases almost 100%. 

Not sure think going happen, masked following safety protocols anyway. never going get satisfactory answer question, seems like crippling anxiety might reason worried. Sticks going help vaccine hesitancy, need carrots. Vaccine passports probably happen that's encourage vaccination. Honestly easiest way probably cash incentives shot, confirm.  Counterpoint though: kinda good. need start exporting vaccines countries actually need them, including closest allies. ramp really fast US focus neighbors first course. Antivax people never got fear needles Thanks! medical reasons. nurse telling everybody drink 3 weeks! guess wanted moms sober mother's day lol Linking paywalls allowed. statistics gathered various professional collegiate sports leagues played fall 2020 reflect well.

There's alot back forth certain things, bad data put retracted, generally clear message level risk mitigation aiming get populace to. guidance seem consistent level risk analysis least I've received it.

Also, fair this, political charging conversation I'm sure make clarity easier.

I zero issue taking minor personal inconvenience help whole. I'm vaccinated think everyone should. also think level guidance inconsistent lacking direction best.   really know anything origin COVID. There's nothing discuss.  Anti-vaxxers pointing vaccinated people still wear masks asking, ‚Äòwhat‚Äôs point vaccinated still wear mask?‚Äô Good that‚Äôs thought beginning lot across pond propaganda machine called Fox News blaring misinformation every night. Hydrate! he's wrong. can't point people talking precedents yell ""slippery slope"" consider winner. someone provide logical reasoning think corona passport lead current issues issues line slippery slope. someone says, ""corona passports?

Someone raising concerns corona passport like privacy implications something like slippery slope. $8 ? point try chances J&amp;J.

EDIT: Fix link. literally seen reliable source claim stockpile exists. expiration thing sounds like straight lie. sure facts right this? Perhaps, seeing kinds increases US stage vaccinations. France country watch since trust levels vaccines low, much lower US, fact. Yep. evidence works. use evidence. states, pick New Jersey say that? New Jersey one heavily vaccinated states, probably be. fund 100 percent development costs, BioNTech repay Pfizer 50 percent share costs commercialization vaccine.

Total development costs billion. Pfizer kicked half bil, fronted BioNTech another half bil.

So entirety EU kicked much single American company, Pfizer went way decline money offered US Yeah, pretty much econ 101 logic mixed one side basic patent law arguments. Patent guarantees always balancing incentives providing patent protections costs incurred due reduced innovation production resulting patent granted monopolies. Given historic failure patent protections incentivize vaccine development, clearly costs patents far outweigh benefits instance. vaccines cannot produced without funding guaranteed markets created governments willing spend public money buy produce vaccines, public say regarding distribution vaccine associated IP. too. know family like too. crazy time. Even though there's minimal value vaccinated people wearing masks, two problems stopping it:

1. everyone vaccinated also stop wearing masks.

2. REALLY want case counts drop, mask wearing free way contribute this. send left food ya ask me, governors same.  click then.

The virus contagious everywhere reach herd immunity quickly normal winter. feeling going see cases rising soon. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going catastrophe anything think zero covid mentality going shut months I‚Äôm asking *why*.

Ignoring statements without numbers, like approach. Almost every article touting ""hospitals filling young COVID patients"" never seem numbers data. would helpful able compare new numbers past trends younger age groups. used be? severity worse? bad lungs, new young people seeing along? underlying conditions obesity common factor? many questions unanswered. difficult determine things indeed getting worse 'young' people news simply focusing since older folks vaccinated hospitalizations deaths drastically decreased.

**Florida‚Äôs Covid Hospitalizations Spike Spring   wonder Trump administration anything it.  think might standard British English. find off-putting odd see US publications. talk like that. Went hike near SF weekend, maskless Im vaccinated outdoors. Half people pass would stare put masks despite fully outdoors, distanced, heavy winds. think getting normal interesting coming months‚Ä¶  South Korea one border, 50 mile wide demilitrized zone riddled mines. think effectively say island since close 100% international travelers come airport. cause becomes slippery slope. Spanish flu happened system tragedy, passed. go route vaccine passport risk opening variation civil liberty cases. I'm saying used loosely. people understand main use international travel pandemic began first place, stay within confines international travel used deny people service local bar restaurant. you‚Äôre willing drive, I‚Äôm positive get vaccinated today Woodbine Racetrack postal code. That‚Äôs got vaccinated yesterday. got it. There‚Äôs money pandemic prevention. much earn selling surgical masks go 10 cents piece? It‚Äôs far profitable let half humanity get infected sell vaccines, remedies, hospital procedures, funeral services on. like war, pandemic profitable business involved. countries can't afford $20/shot massive state-of-the-art mRNA production facilities ready go?

This dumb take; talking making generic aspirin. course. 

I think answer far closer ""lockdowns good"" ""lockdowns bad"".

First, understand reality know full impact, death rate, communicability, etc early on. fact, still fully understand things, moving target mutations. So, erring side caution good. wait react, late. And, fact, happened US. states like NY, CA &amp; MI got hit hard early. already loose community anyone reacted, state federal. 

Secondly, politicization common sense responses like. Wearing masks &amp; staying away other, massive mistake. misinformation ""it's flu"", ""i'm young I'll fine"" (sure probably will, grandpa aunt sally who's recovering cancer won't, ass). 

There LOT learning past 18 months next 18 years. little reason think lock downs frowned upon history. strongly believe anti lock &amp; anti mask movements looked upon confusion &amp; disgust, ""it's obvious, argument this?"". 

Honestly, think got lucky. actual mortality rate even little bit higher, things would got LOT worse, fast stupid politicization response coming Trump &amp; friends. politicization happening time every reason believe WOULD worse. smart be, ya expected..Goa packed crowds surrounding states ,partying like tomorrow, masks, social distancing,casinos, bars, beaches, restaurants huge floating casinos, open 24/7. Technically high risk area I'm one letter two streets one maybe looked way? giving Pfizer exactly put back fridge, think happy enough people turned could use stock. Agreed. pointing US Europe handled covid horribly placing blame Trump, CDC, etc really make sense. Really, never? get past every disease vaccinate without something similar?

Its paranoia point undue burden something simple dead battery could cause idea gains traction? Moderna Pfizer/BNT use similar chemicals. Pfizer/BNT Europe get DNA plasmids Pfizer plant Missouri. Also much medical treatment 20 Euros get you? population level, much c19 treatment 35B Euros get you?

Not everyone c19 needs hospitalization, keep people hospital, go staying shorter time, less people needing months rehabilitation, imagine country save 35B Euros back pretty quickly. issue really Canada vaccines- UK mostly AZ proven effective longer term doses. It‚Äôs looking like work way Pfizer. EMA approval isn‚Äôt anywhere near. ‚ÄûGermany‚Äú isn‚Äôt buying anything. Haven‚Äôt known along?  Ok, 6 people many? post link article?

218 villagers. didn‚Äôt read excerpt, would read link? think want go ""90s night"" overpriced club Chelsea husband never struggled mental health life. infected year ago hes wildly expensive therapy crippling anxiety paranoia. Despite mild case COPD 32 despite history heavy smoking lungs covered scarring. mental health toll real devastating see action. feel like would anything everyone vaccinated don‚Äôt even know comfortable mass gathering vaccine status uncertain. work going call people back fall despite vaccinated I‚Äôm terrified go mass transit. see sign, would take business elsewhere   Speaking airborne transmission‚Ä¶ Ok, 6 people many? post link article?


Zoonotic influenza infections come close contact animals, like chicken pig farm workers. find hard believe 3% southeast Asian people work chicken pig farms Hating teachers isn‚Äôt new thing, it‚Äôs typically norm. teacher dares treat job like job instead martyr students, demonized. Also unions vary across state. states anti-union, teacher unions powerless. won‚Äôt get that. paranoid thinking got us disaster already! 600k dead maskers afraid liberties taken away piece cloth. normal times don‚Äôt see ever get past don‚Äôt vaccine passports really take close look vaccines sites. postal codes outside ‚Äòofficial‚Äô list eligible certain sites.  Oh right. remember thanks  comment referring Alberta (which Canada), let's go States now.

Vaccinations dramatically increased States compared months ago. I'm saying reduced infections deaths bad thing. saying reopening everything without adequate one-dose two-dose vaccinated population provide herd immunity transmission COVID-18 invites preventable infections death population. Hell, Alberta currently much higher proportion population vaccinated (one dose) covid-19 months ago, that's stopping highest COVID-19 infection rate North America.

The article highlights increase preventable infections younger populatiom Florida, would exacerbated Canada, especially Alberta, even level full vaccination reached Florida levels.  like don‚Äôt argument keep saying ‚Äúpeer reviewed.‚Äù 

The study shows Florida discrepancy excess deaths. That‚Äôs true ‚Äúpeer reviewed study‚Äù correct. However, compare differences states, it‚Äôs outlier. 

So yes, study right. 

What‚Äôs wrong idea Florida intentionally cooking books grand conspiracy downplay covid rates deaths. 

I know people blinded ‚ÄúFlorida bad‚Äù plenty legitimate criticisms Florida‚Äôs response don‚Äôt require false exaggerated allegations cover up. extremely irresponsible guests ashamed. get vaccinated ASAP.  still green...that's I'm saying. Obviously hit beginning cause next nyc hub world... Pa somehow get hit wave. everyone north east better. argument real world large scale data shows effective AZ JJ. complicated. matter bring inactivated vaccines supposed less effective results prove wrong. vaccinating really fast hopefully soon worldwide US? last time checked, world revolve around US Yes, completely forgot mention that. It‚Äôs bit gamble. There‚Äôs almost evidence vaccines delayed 4 months still effective. 

I imagine could turn bit disaster frankly - large portion population thinking immunity, taking risks 4 months shots. Canadians lovely 4 month wait doses ...isn't great. 
Source: waiting 4 months dose #2 think AZ vaccine? Dammit hate right this. need read whole book like get gist. going gain great insight first 20 pages. reading book like like it, 99% time. Same. It‚Äôs still job ppe wear stated otherwise. Approximately one two infected. Hospitalizations/deaths COVID vaccine really rare, must weren‚Äôt vaccinated got it. Hard say weren‚Äôt vaccinated Yes. few. cannot? Alabama doesn‚Äôt worst vaccination rate country... tons data supporting efficacy mask usage. South Korea. 

Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong well, Asia suppose islands. Vietnam apparently poor fuck. Basically East Asia took seriously proximity China whereas West napped pretended would never happen.

Then Iran came.. still can't trust news ayatollah.

Then Italy came.. inaction inexcusable.  swabs collected residents within section Sao Paulo, Brazil, 18 years age older suspected COVID-19 symptoms. Patients tested homes supervision trained healthcare personnel. tested positive COVID-19 -- least two following symptoms: fever, cough, sore throat, change in/loss smell -- classified mild cases -- assessed presence psychiatric symptoms approximately two months levels depressive, anxiety post-traumatic stress symptoms reported 26 percent, 22 percent, 17 percent, respectively hope brought food plan camping New England general absolutely kicking ass this, I'm NH last checked leading country % adults vaccinated. 

NH, MA, VT, CT, ME, Hawaii hit 70% target believe, I'm really happy see it. Well like said it‚Äôs peer reviewed wants contradict study study Tweets Numbers deaths underreported fear. Especially really high positive test rate means many likely even getting tested. Also die without able get bed hospital, official cause death  use many carrots sticks get everyone vaccinated. make life pain ass people eligible won‚Äôt get vaccinated. 

We need better system vaccine passport papers though. Blockchain verification would work well. Sputnik V least effective vaccine. 

They fast release without proper testing, later tests shown good is. fact, EMA approval expected soon Germany already agreed buy substantial amount contingent approval. 

Turkey couldn‚Äôt even get Sputnik V due numerous fuck-ups government caused significantly gave Russia upper hand type negotiations. 

Instead, Turkish government bought Chinese Sinovac, less 50% efficacy, paid $100 per jab, essentially using entirely siphon money state reserves. works people give damn health.

i took sinpharm becaue option back then

it kind works, prevents death like 99.999% cases vaccinations end pandemic rich countries back normal fairly quickly. need eradicate disease make largely irrelevant. Unlikely. Maybe privately owned places, big public stuff going keep things PR reasons. would wear one let known willing wear mask anyone uncomfortable West Bengal hotspot.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* dilemma entirely making.  definitely uniform. doubt West Coast Northeast reach probably exceed numbers. rest nation, particularly South, it'll struggle. chief minister thinking economy people Goa Honestly, I‚Äôm fucking sick worrying idiots don‚Äôt want contribute ending pandemic. state, plenty supply point get sick unvaccinated, that‚Äôs dude. vaccine intended pathway normalcy vaccine passports ain‚Äôt chief. call ask. I‚Äôm shy asking vaccine status people I‚Äôm come work house, example. Webmd lmao Congrats Enjoy! I'm Pfi Guy 100% serious ilness, 83% mild case, 50.7% infection Hahaha, no. Remember two weeks flatten curve 13 months later? year, impact debatable people risk vaccinated, thus deaths hospitalisations hugely lowered. then, cases? Cases matter people dying suffering severe cases, they? We're never going eliminate virus places, possible worth cost. acceptable create essentially two tiers rights based personal medical decisions, even year (not likely it'd ever go away implemented it)? ITT: Snarky comments, look substantive discussion elsewhere. Yeah higher morbidity rate virus has, less efficiency has. needs hosts survive, spread, mutate. 6% population got first dose month ago more. 6.4% India's population 65. according standard definition ""the vulnerable"", indeed vaccinated vulnerable now.  existence individuals like reinforces need end restrictions anywhere everywhere possible immediately
If keep locking stuff cause people scared, never get back normal better rip band aid  Thanks editing saying ""sound like twat"", weird framed bad guy, get downvoted someone tries using ""most them"" literally describe single case, clearly fear mongering Why?

No ones going want enforce it, everyone around vaccinated really little chance actually causing serious harm others That's exactly problem though. really wish could go back normalcy this, truth opens issues. antivaxers either. Eventually going see people anyone POI. 

Should also make criminal passports excons? Well, probably let countries dangerous past. people deemed special needs? Elderly risk covid? Etc. 

I genuinely think shit like end happening *knock wood* way hell I'm policy even slightest chance happening, even want drink packed bar like annoyance real issue. suspect okay - people underestimate impact voluntary measures contain. say, everyone nervous. Ugggghhhh  problem simply manufacturing either. also distribution. cold storage chains required mRNA vaccines exist shoddy parts world. said lifting restrictions still help extent especially cheaper ones like AZ J&amp;J. man actually heartbreaking. imagining 80 year old India can't get one low triage list, yes. Please! I‚Äôm growing concerned border going stay closed far long fear, there‚Äôs little movement even discussion it. do? resident here. Definitely looking forward little vaccinated summer New England bubble here. got hit hard seeing light end tunnel nice.  I'm sure right place ask, vaccinated people still need wear masks? immune? Doesn‚Äôt matter. They're talking usefulness vs uselessness grand scheme things. They‚Äôre talking unrealistic vs realistic regarding movie current pandemic reality. 

Your point merit hypothetically speaking, irrelevant response comment above. 12-15 get us % needs go WTO. seem whole lot support Europe though, least enough. Different countries different libraries point masking limit probability transmission completely remove chance transmission.

It tool along social distancing keep R value less one. worked much time.

But much math say ‚Äúderp masks don‚Äôt work.‚Äù  Wearing mask outside crowd lingering one place unnecessary get 2 doses vaccine 1? That, pull Bush warn (read: threaten) things would go Hell get second term. places never really locked continued live life fairly normal even without vaccine. life lockdowns forever even life worth living. worst came worst, could stay locked forever, I'd take chances virus 99% survival rate. Life always risk. Tell it. embarrassing EU screwed badly. can't think obvious example EU system shined still screwed up. EU politicians half asleep wheel. fuck? $4 covishield dose? That's AstraZeneca licenced India right? That's twice amount charge EU, supposed produce cost? changed? Increase raw materials? find without words express well.. Aren‚Äôt allowed decide want small room someone hasn‚Äôt vaccinated virus causing worst pandemic hundred years?

So go, simple that. also natural end flu season people start opening windows spending time outside. believe covid cases saw drop time last year. Interesting. wondering old ones could perhaps used boosters. Like give J&amp;J booster got moderna/pfzier vice verse. Although afaik data back doubt companies would want either due business reasons. mean either loneliness die Covid, would wanted? say thing. Trump's loss due response Covid-19, finding vaccination plans despite claiming want fast track recovery help.

It like Trump cannot multitask needs focus one thing time. knew elections coming, stopped everything campaign, prove walking Covid hotspot. Shocked pikachu face we‚Äôre actually like 25% british Would mostly non-EU countries point. EU quickly ramping already likely enough almost adults want July/August. also already exported 200m+ doses Certainly for-profit, drug war supported jails now. So... Florida want go cruise vaccine passport governor allow them... mean can't go cruise even fully vaccinated? able travel countries require them, state exist? 

And vaccine passport privacy thing kinda dumb. plenty countries need certain vaccine travel like since I've alive. wondering poster thought didn‚Äôt phrase well. weird way ask question. 10%ish population India speaks English. ok. it? know. reference ?  700 pretty low. gotta remember, **a lot** people country. hard conceptualize 700 people, let alone 300 million. 400k peak though? Netherlands inoculated around 120k consistently past days, really insane single day records. countries can't afford pay Pfizer jabs? 

Get COVAX, buy AstraZeneca, buy Janssen, buy cheaper vaccine. 

And going complain poor *""deserve"" ""inferior""* vaccines, keep mind millions millions people EU also receive Janssen AstraZeneca vaccines, like father did. EU ordered hundreds millions vaccines. inferior vaccines work...

On top that, BioNTech already said ready sell vaccine cost price poor countries, like AstraZeneca Janssen already doing. Moderna already shared enforce IP. looking numbers New England flexing COVID like nobodies business. entire region including NY, MA, CT, VT, ME, NJ, RI, NH 6k reported cases yesterday positivity rate less 2%. Deaths, hospitalizations, well. Coupled top tier vaccination rates area determined stomp COVID out.

Seems fitting first area US get worst 2020 we'd first really get handle things. easy. part production chain done limited number companies right now. See Really? Thats huge, would take though?  Yep. rest world going figure solution, without America.

Half Americans even passports probably people screeching ""vaccine passports"" since know CDC [vaccine thing long time. submission linking news-medical.net automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* limit though. Resistance COVID-19 dramatically higher traditional anti-vax sentiment. seems yet another example absurd political polarization. conservatives getting ""prove"" overblown young liberals getting sort revenge boomers. strange.  Good news üëçüëç Lets treat patient's bfre skin starts bloating Corrupt government less trust, like US? first, moved stop spread pretty quickly. suggested everyone wear face masks ‚ÄúDo medical workers.‚Äù

As opposed earlier message of, ""Don't wear mask medical workers!"" Man coworker got played board games four six hours. None others tested positive... 

I think it‚Äôs bit complicated.

If that‚Äôs case, wear masks all? [curb enthusiasm: shorts bad Canada gets shipments twice week though depending vaccines get week. keep storage allow us enough get next shipment maintaining somewhat steady vaccine rate number doses storage falls throughout week. ‚ÄúYou provide list claims perceive failures think Science respect pandemic.‚Äù

I believe people assume lot science is, really is. hear many people say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe anything, science.‚Äù Aside ridiculous, unless infants, human can‚Äôt believe anything, religious otherwise. also makes science identity. 

Throughout pandemic, seen science abused extent. Science make policies, much pandemic policies based little evidence, even logic. live NY, 24 hour subway service recently resuming, year closing night scrub purposes preventing virus spread, already could guessed pointless year ago.

‚ÄúWait. know travels several times distance?

...From recent scientific experiments paper(s) challenged earlier hypotheses, that's how.‚Äù

My point evidence 6 feet social distancing never particularly strong begin with, especially extent public policy made concerning capacity limits. random number created, based hypothetical *maybe*, virus spreads less distance. That‚Äôs passed ‚Äúthe science‚Äù many experts, used influence policy. obviously, waste time.

Once again, see scientific research valuable method, repeated testing. Obviously none done prove social distancing effective, yet passed ‚Äúscience.‚Äù

Just like obsessive sanitizing, like hand washing, like shutting outdoor events, like staying home, little evidence supporting them, voodoo. cases rose spite this, always scapegoat.

‚ÄúThe Science basic epidemiology, virology, biology, chemistry, physics, probably many areas know name can't think of.‚Äù

And yet, point past non-pharmaceutical methods like lockdowns ever used stop pandemics. lockdowns sure didn‚Äôt stop pandemic regions them. whole lot damage, though.

Of course, lockdowns always experiment. *Maybe* this, virus stop spreading. based actual research unprecedented, frankly quite draconian policy worked, mostly hypothetical. 

Too bad hypothetical carry millions extreme poverty, destitute, hunger. bad hypothetical didn‚Äôt take account diseases COVID-19. Even thought lockdowns work (I don‚Äôt), carnage leave calls question they‚Äôre actually good idea. But, oh well, wasn‚Äôt focus.

Actually, feel might confrontational first reply, apologize that. different opinions much ‚Äúscience‚Äù actually valued throughout pandemic. Germany currently 4/5 days ahead France total number doses administered, gap huge. people partially vaccinated less people fully vaccinated. women experiences time month abnormal vaccine? got first shot 3 weeks ago. period right delayed bad one really weird..heavy even 6 days, emotional (more normal, crying everyday/depressed)
I heard vaccine caused women feel cycle differences..just would like know others personal experiences...thanks! also input supply problem lack qualified people run facilities exist. 1 shot vaccines international donations vaccine 3rd world likely get vaccinated. don‚Äôt say.... Except Bangladesh - probably corruption/lack testing. bound eventually happen. 

I NZed (New Zealand) COVID Tracer app installed phone Ministry Health since wanted see general idea one would look like USA. thankfully pretty straightforward quite secure fears secure easy use gone. hope USA version effective easy use.

I would lying said daunting regards new technological future headed towards. Thankfully NZed presume USA handling extremely well grateful for. Potential? I‚Äôm sure needed choice shitty journalism combined slow website full ads (in subjective opinion) good journalism nice-ish website. between. Agreed. things never, EVER short supply stupidity idiots let generation anti vaxxers raise generation anti vaxxers used work hotel owned cruise line. Whole ships full people coming infected Norovirus pretty common. Like several times season common. unpleasant. competes one Eurovision 

Lol, well settles it.  Depends talk to. lot people state NJ really sick masks wanna take soon. eager everyone vaccinated. Sorry case state. :( hit 0 doses day early July less half population fully vaccinated.

That's terrifying number balding people died covid would better measure. Lots young people hospital tend die often consequently longer hospital stays. No, we're still actively trying drive numbers flu vaccine groups, telling people take preventative measures, staying away obviously sick people, etc. idea declare covid done hit flu numbers insane, know spreads much easier flu.

If prematurely stop caring taking appropriate precautions, it'll come back bite us ass. never understand people moronically short-sighted. many examples exactly pattern need, many unnecessarily dead permanently maimed care? He'd gotten bored five minutes, turned gone watch Lou Dobbs Hannity Faux News ""real"" information.  wait there's ebola outbreak Florida. Imagine well that's gonna go. TIL üëÜ Pfizer Moderna basically price. Moderna bit expensive EU, mostly US funded, BioNTech bit expensive US, mostly EU funded. That's easy google. find multiple articles. ""Pfizer, Moderna Say Booster Shots Probably Needed"" first one showed up. find many this. DeSantis made clear support vaccination

This going need source bold claim. support vaccinations? Really, I'm going need source that. ""SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positivity protects reinfection least seven months 95% efficacy - EClinicalMedicine"" estimates immunity length minimum limited much time we've collect data.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* seems bar graphs?

I found state compares national share vaccinated people‚Äù

But can‚Äôt zoom last weeks. can't compare India December India still much population case loads evidence successfully controlled environment.

Variants always around. increase vaccinations coupled decrease cases, hospitalizations, deaths indicate control, does? Show data.

You're suggesting vaccines irrelevant even though data proves they've effective controlling virus. part I've never heard of. We've spent last year tanking businesses, pile crap logic ain't going work here. Saskatchewan highest doses per 100,000 outside Territories. Anyone age 12 eligible May 20 starting book second doses Monday. per capita terms, NYC last year India now? India worse?  Sticks banned south anyway... feet right now. found husband sleep walking last night, building shrine Bill Gates reciting windows user agreement. Yeah knew AZ delayed dosage protocol. wanted know Pfizer one. said delayed dose work like dose AZ. mostly they're choosing this, people businesses aren't.

As long stays choice people calling mandated. getting covid made fat (quarantine working home etc) Ah, old True Scotsman ey. Alberta Canada through.  don‚Äôt worry still think Canada nicer America(this coming American). Bullshit.
It‚Äôs almost exactly one full year AstraZeneca vaccine entered phase 2/3 today everyone unblinded.
I don‚Äôt remember exact dates Pfizer/biontech roughly timeline.
Please stop spreading misinformation. article say? can‚Äôt understand Finnish.   Im sorry fail?

200 milion doses administred 200 milion exported think reasoning politicians say design enough times won‚Äôt get voted slow rollout. Anyone else J&amp;J vaccine experience rib/chest pain? bad third day sure, gott'dayum kicking day 2. Real response :

""What-?""

[Hangs Up]

Source: Used work Walmart.  70% SA strain, 80 UK one. It‚Äôs Qatari study published two days ago google mRNA. That's all. sayin. I've tried make simple easy comparison global covid-19 cases deaths, controlling population, interest anyone!

Further UK specific analysis vaccine data found also interested!! friend Lauren takes drugs MS suppress immune system. got vaccine it‚Äôs unlikely protect doesn‚Äôt build antibodies like me. She‚Äôs basically resigned shut-in long time people refuse get vaccine. Fraction deaths preventable despite news shoves throat. unhealthy twilight life. Big country = big numbers. Cant expect level compliance feel owed country 50 individual countries. Embrace reality head sun light it‚Äôs late. Cyclical patterns infection rates common. Dropping case loads evidence successfully controlled environment.

Again verbatim arguments saw December surrounding India. read article? That's true single household gatherings situation seems different. hairdresser seeing potentially dozen people day. Germany views one dose J&amp;J fully vaccinated. Probably good idea turn words something detailed, make clear actually going increase vaccine supply fast world needs nice gesture. Oh man. see upgrade option? pay extra? I'm gonna ask security update (booster). also sweating green liquids?   Moderna vaccines going Canada produced Europe. weeks ago export ban vaccines produced US. Moderna vaccines went Canada made US facilities. don‚Äôt see every business social gathering asked use this. seeing colleges clubs private events choose use this. one asking show document visit uncle‚Äôs house. think gonna start mandating masks, nah? üòü Ron Howard voice: getting results. read somewhere yesterday UK variant actually dominant strain India right now. looking understand appeared younger people dying higher rates wave previous. article (CNN) said 1. Young mortality rates higher. proportion. Overall cases higher. 2. UK variant overtaken dominant variant 

I know subject article studies looks like across three states. Protest marches last summer resulted next zero covid cases. went every night weeks end Milwaukee, WI around US. Nobody would argue trying keep social distance. activities safe, encouraged say June everyone vaccinated wants be. it‚Äôs choice, people get covid, that‚Äôs them. I‚Äôd also prepared say open everything now, initial reason restrictions overwhelm hospital system well prepared deal potential uptick hospitalizations. April, people already wearing masks. uncertainty around masks February March.  Germany view one AZ one dose j&amp;j fully vaccinated?   got moderna arm pain. arm pain isn‚Äôt bad tho feels like shoulder workout helped buddy move bunch shit day sore shoulder. didn‚Äôt get side effects anyone else family can‚Äôt speak behalf go. Now.  Good lord, collectible mentality come from? keep seeing pop up. No, there's reason right take another vaccine series first. shots desperately needed places like India friend already well protected first series. Wow, shocking thinking it‚Äôs evil microchip  far past 6 months 6 months first doctors etc got test subjects they‚Äôve done trials 10-11 months old still immunity moderna saying since moderna shot try keep releasing one booster shot fall cover variants high efficacy variants right current vaccine fall 60-70% efficacy etc. far immunity vaccine trails still stands trials 10 months old initial two dose vaccine looks good year far antibody wise boosters prbly year variants arise. fact mRNA means easily adapt new variants make additional boosters cluster variants breaks out. right least Moderna it‚Äôs looking like reguler two shot booster yearly . get resounding ‚ÄúNO FUCKING SHIT SHERLOCK‚Äù one? Question: (over 18) take younger brother minor get vaccine? Parkinson's related infections, it? reasoning behind design? can't think advantage slow roll out? /r/COVID19 professional discussion happens. Correct.  It‚Äôs okay vaccine replying strah's inquiry Canadian vaccine sourcing. obvious necessary bcoz lot people think vaccine 'doesn't prevent infection, mild symptoms' case money talks. Pfizer won‚Äôt bite hand feeds it.  5 months since AZ rolled still shred real-world evidence breakthrough infection *of variant* problem.  Literally public NY schools

SUNY said mandatory vaccine yet Unlikely. Unless pathogen‚Äôs protein vaccinated epitopes bio-identical own, (think group strep bacteria), autoimmune diseases tend result exposure contents body‚Äôs cells, immune system doesn‚Äôt typically interact with, sufficient exposure (e.g enough cells dying sensitizing immune system), start recognize foreign pathogen. course genetic loading sort thing, mechanisms work try prevent sort thing happening, generally tend develop. got jobs yesterday too! opted xray vision update- pretty sweet! üòé Moderna needs 100mcg mRNA whereas Pfizer needs 30mcg efficacy. approved vaccines, Moderna expensive. Pfizer bucks less Astra dirt cheap comparison. NZ one world leaders vaccine hesitancy long trend going *downhill* time. world asking America cure world pandemic That's I'm asking really. Everyone I'll see vaccinated, besides kids remote schooling. feels weird year opening things like this, even safe fully vaccinated people. family  Uhm Moderna made United states 3 facilities company located Cambridge? Americas vaccines largely made house. AZ JJ made europe make JJ aswell. Pfizer moderna doses largely made here.

We also paid millions ordering vaccines countries can‚Äôt afford them. Full approval kids. meanwhile moron governor ended covid mandates said ""done covid"". Yet obviously, Covid gonna like ""hold beer"". Notice time talking vaccine *preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections*, preventing COVID-19 disease developing. Yeah that‚Äôs pretty accurate  don‚Äôt know they‚Äôre related. Think it‚Äôs body like hey don‚Äôt move area figure wtf going here. would slow roll design though. What‚Äôs advantage slow roll ? able ""jump ahead line"" get shot Phase 1, even though essential worker. local hospital basically begging folks walk shots going waste. Dont believe it. baseless assertion evidence. believe Mexico one-time.

It's still existing contracts - increase exports. movie, CDC (Laurence Fishburne's character) orders CDC labs destroy samples virus.

One CDC lab guy doesn't. keeps virus samples alive active develops vaccine. broadcasts miraculous rebellious information CDC.

Laurence Fishburne ""this great news fuck follow orders napalm samples virus?!?"".

So part saving humanity movie dependent active mutiny safety protocols supposed one safest places Earth disease. Pfizer shifted existing-orders Canada Belgium Kalamazoo week.

Mexico got one-time 1 million dose export.

There significant exports happening, US supply 70,000,000 shots! They're probably focused Europe now. 

Likely people went claiming US worst handling everything India.  understand slow reporting look per capita basis peak december-january much less severe locations, exchange drop-off also much smaller. areas shorter waves high intensity longer waves lesser intensity tends balance course full year Dddduuuhhhhhhhh There's already enough data get approved. It'll 60 days Adults vs total population. trying block businesses requiring vaccination. 

I usually ended FL least year, that‚Äôs happening anytime soon. lot deeper that. CDC made reputation century ago arguing idea diseases carried air, fact passed contact. one organization's central tenets years, usually right. Like powerful organizations, extra slow second guess key part belief system. honest, lot businesses would loved heard truth could made adjustments stay business (mainly improving ventilation). CDC let down. Yep. get decided want Fox news Facebook, gossip around ideas decide convincing. excuse runs dry, move next rumor conspiracy theory Sleeping home, happy Florida's governor made great decisions. I‚Äôm confused 70% first dose comes from? I‚Äôm seeing around 57% 

CT great though consistently strong entire vaccination campaign believe 13 last 14 days reduction hospitalizations, pretty great!! Tuesday's headline: ""Governor Desantis repeals Covid vaccination passport ban, encourages companies check."" going pay

The tax payers, course!

More specifically, want take Medicare social security fuck poor more! That's asshole posting   actually cruise booked Norwegian got cancelled due covid. know I'll ready follow that, certainly would never get ship enforce everyone vaccinated. That's plain foolish. really close 50k cases though worldometer, would first time week so, think stay referring places requiring vaccine approved? wait till start calling airlines cruise lines cancelled. really? people caught on? known since April .... 2020  planning visit Orlando family seeing shit voter suppression law enacting, speak wallet boycott Florida. like USA one. Look Serbia example: bought enough vaccines vax population 7 times over, everyone wanted got shot yet 30%ish population vaccinated. got many jabs left foreigner go get confirm least one person know adamantly refused became mandatory them. P.1.1? Anyone know mutations P.1? binds ace2 receptors basically everywhere body. People experience respiratory issues first that's initially gets in. I‚Äôm requiring vaccination let everyone stop social distancing masking. still gonna mask distance, it‚Äôs dumb mandate vaccine. Floridians go doors heat... beaches, rivers, lakes etc it‚Äôs outdoor state. think vaccinated people shed virus so... Feel blood boil that, situation become politicized drove people away right thing. It‚Äôs sad CDC continues fuck even new leadership. ‚ÄúGold standard‚Äù ass. US health bureaucracies. Remember said evidence human human  Sorry OP meant say, ""no one smart"" think you‚Äôre absolutely correct. I‚Äôm paraphrasing here, think emphasis helpful placed putting everyone mask, focus putting elderly at-risk populations N95 masks isolating them.   J&amp;J vaccine demonstrated 100 times safer Tylenol. deepest sympathies families person died good God, what, 7 MILLION doses? Indian media trying deflect massive Hindu gatherings kumbh mela - bought year forward astrologers blame tiny groups minorities shopping. Well worn path Indian media unfortunately  Unsurprisingly, missed point. China studying mixing concerns efficacy vaccine. think thei vaccine works well results Brazil concur. mixing way save face.

Chen specifically say shortcomings CAL fined directly link recent COVID-19 cases occurred among airline's personnel among employees Novotel Taipei Taoyuan International Airport hotel CAL dormitory.

The CAL dormitory seventh eighth floors one two Novotel buildings, one used provide accommodation dining services general public, Chen said.

The fine set meeting previous day responsibility carrier hotel -- part CAL headquarters complex close Taoyuan International Airport -- many cases discussed, Chen said.

Over past two weeks, 11 CAL pilots, eight relatives CAL pilots, CAL flight attendant, six Novotel employees, three family members tested positive COVID-19, according CECC.

The cases Novotel employees, family members, pilots' relatives considered transmitted domestically, though exact source employees' infection yet pinpointed.

The infections pilots, however, yet classified CECC either domestic imported.

On Wednesday, CECC said based genome sequencing results, determined virus CAL cases genome sequence virus found many Novotel cases.

It admitted, however, still know source infection virus spread among patients.

The Novotel airport hotel consists two buildings, one designated Taoyuan City government quarantine hotel October 2020.
In building, dormitory, CAL's standard dormitory flight crews since epidemic began, continued used outbreak.

Chen said dormitory registered Taoyuan certified quarantine unit still used CAL flight crews required quarantine without city's approval, Taoyuan could fine hotel NT$15,000 violating Communicable Disease Control Act.

Also, regular hotel guests given rooms eighth floor CAL flight crews mandatory home quarantine, Novotel could also face fines Tourism Bureau, Chen said.

On Thursday, Tourism Bureau fined Novotel NT$150,000 mixing general hotel guests CAL flight crews quarantine floor, calling threat public health.

Meanwhile, Taoyuan Mayor Cheng Wen-tsan (ÈÑ≠ÊñáÁá¶) said Friday city government written ticket NT$15,000 Novatel applying building designated quarantine unit.

As city take action earlier CAL dormitory complying quarantine rules, Yang Sheng-ping (Ê•äÂãùË©ï), head Taoyuan Department Tourism, said Novotel expressed interest early March building CAL dormitory certified quarantine unit.

The city rejected hotel's request management difficulties, Yang said, adding CAL flight crews found staying building time city inspected building.

The city continued issue travel subsidies general guests hotel thought mixing CAL flight crews quarantine general hotel guests one floor would happen.
Also, central government's authority manage CAL dormitories, Yang said, CAA ordered carrier make sure dormitory well managed.

Given island nation strict inbound quarantine rules fine long keep quarantine enforced. world whole? Yeah pandemic last long probably. specific countries? Eh could see less Fall, depending well vaccine drives go. much manufactured, approved, effective it? It‚Äôs difference something like candle smoke (hanging air fine particles) mist spray bottle (it may hang air couple moments fall ground much faster). statistic? never linked source. Clearly CDC shows cases vs deaths gives CFR 1.8%. linked source. math you. opposed to? Bro America fucked. I'm really hoping feel like shit tomorrow; otherwise vaccine experience anti-climatic thing entire life want money back. Yes, that's right, $0 it! post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Profit main motivator. They've shared technology poorer countries vaccinate. actually wouldn‚Äôt need check vaccine passport key west it‚Äôs fine. check launch stop Key West don‚Äôt check again. School ventilation problem pandemic respiratory viruses childhood asthma causing lot sick days. There's resistance deal want spend money, etc (will cut political rant). unique idea even believe conspiracy keep control. mean margins write loss?

I mean exactly that. Pharmaceutical companies spend advertising research lot research expensed written losses think handle $2.5 billion loss either way???

I told you, eat loss. write good portion still far less money spent lobbying, advertising, class actions. 

If Pfizer worried losses, stop paying advertisements label products pediatricians. I'm happy saved Pfizer money! general, socializing outside talking, risk infection. Even Fauci original spring outbreak said fine, people backyard. 

Think Covid like carbon monoxide. requires certain amount, certain amount time, sustained time, infect. Outdoors? expands endlessly, never building density required infection, diluting rapidly outwards. High wind helps obviously, required. Even low winds still moving virus much issue. 

When comparing amount viral load inhaled, indoors vs outdoors, probably less 1% outdoors indoors, judging research airborne viruses. sense, would conversing someone many, *many* hours, even days, reach equivalent 10 minute average indoor infection time. 

Consider fact opening window room increases average infection time 10 minutes 45 minutes average. Let alone literally outside. 

Now, real issue shouting, singing, laughing loudly etc. stuff normal droplet transmission becomes issue, airborne transmission. choir, sports games, concerts etc 'loud' events horrible spread compared many types events. It‚Äôs really realistic possible outcome movie concerning pandemic that‚Äôs gotten bad. useless organization. Everyone brain known year wonder there's FBI hotline people sort thing now. two wrongs make right? I'm going back gym I'm vaccinated. (Or say indoor portion, using outdoor area year). you, conditions different everywhere. FWIW I'm public health program pretty cautious. healthcare system proud of, many US citizens question much it‚Äôll cost get vaccine? side effects may cost jobs well. already has. hot fuck Florida right now. Florida üêê It‚Äôs great! years ago wife wanted take cruise weren‚Äôt interesting ones Southern California live. And, think Florida pit. So, flew NOLA day Christmas, great time including New Year‚Äôs Eve. Jan 2 boarded cruise Mexico. Great vacation. Uptake vaccines high UK. antivaxxers really got strong hold. There's strong aura pride positivity around covid vaccine programme, despite criticism AZ disputes EU.  I'm professor R1 program. I'm allowed back fall without getting vaccinated. said, got vaccinated earliest chance could! (All faculty know super excited allowed higher education priority group) Yes that‚Äôs got. Nope, can't either. Definitely good thing enable everyone 12 &amp; take Pfizer Biontech vaccine. Within age 12 16 year old group Middle School students carry high load COVID-19 year later... Gee... Thanks.... developed less year? correct this. Immunity prior COVID infection studied par effectiveness Pfizer 2-dose regimen (at 94%) preventing future symptomatic infections COVID. virus vaccine stimulate antibody production memory cell reactivity manner. benefit vaccine ravage body process achieving immunity. Yes.

Literally vaccines profit motivation.   would Florida pass law this?

Are literally legislating anti-vaxxism? Governments pay it. company cannot provide free.

I'm saying government pays government limit production vaccine production facilities, raw materials provided them.

Yes no. vaccine manufacturers problem vaccines use mechanisms. That's also problem, problem. Cost also problem. Infrastructure efficacy (thinking South Africa particular) also problems. 

In fact, failure contain virus actually putting artificial pressure vaccine distribution. 

And publicly funded pharmaceutical research essential. along. Glad see efforts hard-earned tax dollars! Truly money well spent... Yes. reason that's hard get people partly selfishness partly think scale population, single person. people argue mask effectiveness, I'm approaching public health view, everyone wears mask reduces transmission. they're thinking there's still chance personally could infected, masks ""don't work.""  us got Moderna. non stop Michigan news rise cases, they've dropped substantially, nothing. accurate tell real story all. look happened. willfully ignorant hate politician/state. fair taking temps shown almost useless. Also, bleaching surfaces dangerous virus bleach dangerous people think COVID extremely low chance spreading surfaces.

There's actually fair bit cruise terminal construction anticipation things starting back up. problem real solution ditch masks main idea focus distancing moving stuff outdoors, plus paying people stay home.

Which mostly thing learned 1918! That's masks fell here, dropped recommendation due lack effect. spent year relearning damn lessons. Yeah crap, it‚Äôs effective, least Pfizer moderna. countries don‚Äôt option? Like really it‚Äôs hard understand, guess people can‚Äôt get logic.   Huh? fucking year it? dunno ~~Miami~~ city mayor sound happy interview.

I'm super happy see track finally become airline pilot last summer COVID ruined me. might make summer all. 


Keep demand coming!  Nothing really, choice western vaccine Sputnik Sino I‚Äôd absolutely choose western vaccine. Idk entirely would. second time work, heard customer say they've wearing masks moving Florida. say good riddance. CDC put 95% threshold guests, that's children go.

And think there's alternative 95% threshold met, something onerous achieve. I'm wondering Disney Cruise Line going make out. guess 12-15 year old (I think) vaccine coming soon, bet 5% normal cruise population line 12 years old. latest numbers surpass even yearly tolls height opioid epidemic mark reversal progress addiction recent 87,000 Americans died drug overdoses 12-month period ended September, according preliminary federal data, eclipsing toll year since opioid epidemic began 1990s. üòàüòàüòàüòàüòà desantis looks mostly like poorly shaved armpit  worried? No; fully vaccinated, 94% protected severe illness associated COVID even considering level risk based age predispositions, may reduce further. Healthy, fit adult, age 40, predispositions, level risk drops less 1%. *LOT* less 1%.  Chinese pharmaceutical company making vaccine? Med schools Law Schools reject tens thousands applicants every year, thats isn‚Äôt them.

There's everyone wants one. nonsensical monopoly scales monopolies Doctors Lawyers driven money!?

There doctors lawyers poor poor countries. driven money therefore possible pursue professions reasons money. point. ignorant claim otherwise.

You speak suggest stop claiming do. unfamiliar, Nova Scotia part maritime ‚Äúbubble‚Äù number isolated eastern provinces required anybody outside area quarantine 2 weeks - even Canadians. amazingly long time - places like Australia, Taiwan, Vietnam like.

Sucks things taken turn worse :( cases also getting Vietnam. went local cases 50 day now, it‚Äôs little complicated new variants. Hoping things get control soon. design mRNA vac sin fatally flawed. understand urgency either. obvious people take longer transition wearing masks, none business. really learned today Sars2 airborne disease. Anyone seriously paying attention knew time last year. No, learned today society's functions left people appointed politicians. might refuse pay treatments patient decided vaccinate. cases par California heavy locked states? hiding bodies everywhere? Sort waste time even debunk anti-vax propaganda. People eat already made minds vaccine looking anything gives positive confirmation bias. send covid hoax people India instead. didnt belive seems high, but, checked correct, thats 2019-2020, worse years. Still glad checked though already posted Reposts removed. new CDC director worst. Instead telling vaccinated people get back normal literally say unmask around vaccinated people. help? People need motivation get vaccinated. providing that. already posted Reposts removed. Whelp that's enough reddit one day. correcedt shortly nonsense COVID airborne took year fix - looks bit different me.  likely people showing symptoms given tests available confirm infected treatment. Like measles side caution would treat like airborne (like shown several examples early pandemic) proven wrong enjoy cruising go two three cruises year, I'm going start back see US cruises dealing things. I'm much worried covid someone getting sick whole ship quarantined, ruining cruise. even quarantined, ports allowing anyone treating like plague ship.

My summer trip going 2-week southeast US road trip. I've already got hotels booked about. 59 days go!  also running rampant area near half global population. opportunity mutate unlike anything we've seen thus far. I'm hopeful, feels premature say end near massive battle potentially beginning. covid announced airborne actually mean? anything different?  That's pretty early. Good you.

Now, imagine CDC scientists listened Taiwan, knew December 31, 2019. intelligence agencies also knew around time. Imagine government told us truth early nature virus, came sensible strategy close international borders, instated mandatory quarantines anyone entering, told Americans stay home 4-8 weeks federal state governments worked together establish procedures contact tracing, ramped sourcing production masks, using defense production act. words, copy Taiwan did.

I would called authoritarian something said needed lock hard 4-8 weeks starting March 2020. really radical facts trickling out? would saved 500k+ American lives, well close domestic economy.

The U.S. information needed react properly, political leaders CDC failed us. one thing anything face virus. another thing tell lies American people, recommend general public wear masks time. Absolutely criminal. CDC announces water wet. updates come. don‚Äôt remember much first months 2020. It‚Äôs honestly blur. 

I use Reddit *a lot* year ago too. still struggle remember news covid. Like, I‚Äôm sure know probably read Reddit, *don‚Äôt remember* that‚Äôs kind scary. news, sky blue Also ""Big 10"" 16 teams it. College sports beyond sight God. Still universal densely populated Hawaii. Also still far lowest case death rate. Go figure. Jesus, fucking gym.

Half people wear masks staff something every time complain. refuse put signs telling people need wear mask.

This virus taught significant number people selfish idiots. care anyone. wonder people locked would crime mostly disappear. suspect would. Outdoor school 1918 winter thing. People damn soft Private lab, CDC. Hey, I! bought 20 dollar pair lab goggles sealed like ski goggles, clear. catch virus going eye, tear ducts nasal passages. slim chance.... chance.... covid 19 terrible disease. kill enough,and latency period absurdly long contagious. 100% right death rate leaving space people speculate response. problem catch early may never know appears China didn‚Äôt want admit thing catch early. spread, there‚Äôs amount social distancing measures outside effective vaccine would stop it. can‚Äôt shut world 3 months, many variables exceptions. Alachua Biden+27 county record, probably representative state. CDC new Internet Explorer reputable publishing estimate return sort normalcy? know much longer I'm going genuinely lose obvious time first Chinese lockdown January 2020 latest. locking everyone getting sick people coughing faces....only airborne virus could spread like that. point know use ""strain"". Feel free ignore article. right point comments proved. comments australian coronavirus sub maybe comments /r/straya I'm sure. Link single comment COVID rates actually coming Florida, states come rapidly Florida lagging behind relatively speaking. look data, COVID numbers infections 40% month ago Florida.

Basically could lot better, things improving regardless.  ‚ÄúTrust science.‚Äù 

Maybe science needs move little faster efficiently? Eat shit still, like less reliable quick tests, tool filter least cases earlier spread it. Even detect 1 10 cases, combined everything else add get max.

About masks: many people seem want live illusion can't real. Really blows mind many can't cope accepting fact pandemic could hit us like usual every generations ever change behaviour. endgame yet - shows people never get message Oh word!? Chinese vaccine a‚Ä¶ questionable efficacy rate cognitive dissonance. People economic thus social incentive believe information. people choose believe information. Also hotel owners, owners golf courses. Damn that‚Äôs really cool solution. Thanks info! Huh, super interesting! definitely getting confused meant ask slums. Thanks filling in, it‚Äôs much appreciated literally sinking ocean leadership won‚Äôt even acknowledge climate change soooo... future doesn‚Äôt look bright. Exactly.

They still seem like great academic institution analyzing disease, comes decision making controlling disease doubts ran similarly trusted institution old. seem CDC eradicated smallpox; seems different institution different cultural values. nations using Pfizer, moderna, AZ JJ Lithuania, Germany Spain currently ahead us less 1% terms doses administered per capita. 7 day vaccination rate took hit last week supply dwindled ample stock overtake coming days. Moderna comes obligations May June, optimistic think start get steady supply US shortly get 1-2M AZ states well likely finish 4th Israel, US UK. really. many places N95 masks were/are reserved intubation invasive procedures medical workers ordinary surgical masks. Everyone N95 masks. town rapid tests, 3-5 days get results. She'd show appointment pain hands, they'd discover fever, send test, reschedule came back negative. whole process would repeat. half dozen times doctor said screw saw inspite fever. Privately felt like trump wanted virus kill many people could would make economy boom, like war many people died exonomy booms.. especially killing elderly people draining Medicare Medicaid. think strategic. Sorry jaded going four years trump administration.  Lol Yay! great relief get first shot in? Happy wife. :) really disturbing say first western country... right answer. whole debate aerosol scientists vs. doctors physics education still hung miasma theory. Doctors rightfully fight century ago, kept science since. Wow Florida Florida. Hate southern states. True, think culture problem permeates institution. Instead head 10 year appointment similar someone top profession, 1.5 2 year political appointee amenable governing party power fired President time. promotes short-term thinking focus causing fuss, opposed long-term thinking focus keeping country healthy regardless politics.

They still seem like great academic institution analyzing disease, comes decision making controlling disease doubts ran similarly trusted institution old. seem CDC eradicated smallpox; seems different institution different cultural values. Exactly. one frustrating things roll out. Hahahaha everyone already knows! Ever heard ASHRAE, CDC? Silly puppets Well that‚Äôs kind understandable. need groceries live. without sports camp  places they'd refuse vaccinate case? Like personally I'd understand asked come back next day wait half hour round passers-by, I've never heard declining open new vial appointment.  Yes it‚Äôs almost cherry pick stats one point time support world view. That‚Äôs new haven‚Äôt seen before. honestly thought trying pass smelll vagina fresh mountain mist. wearing cotton masks?

Cigarette odor sticks bad cotton. 

You even test hovering white patch cotton lit cigarette see catches fumes. TIL Macron part MTG wing /s airborne virus spread, Late party usual. make schools windows open prevent school shooters getting easily. ‚ÄúI wish innately rational.‚Äù supposed assume rational like yourself? don‚Äôt sound rational me.

Are saying humans tend irrationality? sounds arrogant, assume ‚Äúrationality‚Äù mean, ‚Äúpeople different opinions morons, I‚Äôm smart, wish people could like me.‚Äù

What ‚Äúscience‚Äù taking here. science justified lockdowns never worked, destroyed economy? science justified obsessively washing hands, never necessary? science justified shutting outdoor events, never big factor COVID spread? science justifies 6 feet social distancing, despite arbitrary number, fact COVID spread effectively several times length?

By way, despite tied religion, mentioned superstitious believing breaking mirror gives 7 years bad luck. None voodoo ever reduced COVID spread though.

Controversial statement too, mean science said masks weren‚Äôt necessary, said masks necessary?

Now, might say, ‚Äúoh, science changed.‚Äù know what, don‚Äôt think actually value ‚Äúscience‚Äù that‚Äôs position. Science, plainly defined, study natural world. scientific research process, something ‚Äúbelieve.‚Äù

What makes scientific research valuable, opinion, scientific method, I‚Äôm sure learned school. things accepted established ‚Äúfacts‚Äù science, must looked, tested, demonstrated again. single study might suggest correlation ‚Äúprove‚Äù it. Something peer reviewed mean true. science worth anything, ‚Äúfacts‚Äù able change whim. like masks effective one day, effective another.

Another note here, scientists viewed clergy, authorities faith, researchers, research point ‚Äúscience‚Äù plainly defined.

I view somebody respects science, scientific research. don‚Äôt believe people preach ‚Äúscience‚Äù sub either understand science respect it. Tell India. british american Utopia? liked liked british one better How's attitudes Japanese general public towards vaccine? Uh, article thread about? don‚Äôt understand pessimism I‚Äôm seeing lot places herd immunity impossible achieve given variants vaccine hesitant people. Israel seeing virus bay 60% vaccinated. would US see similar results, especially since seeing cases go steadily now? keeping getting vaccinated right now? caused though why? Whats rights given up? Alcohol disinfectant, ingest lots that. comes multiple formats, too, beer, wine, margaritas... relevant live vaccines, idea vaccinated person made ill infect others, rare. rotavirus vaccine babies example 'shed' advised immune compromised people try deal baby poo little vaccine avoid catching rotavirus, there's basically risk people healthy immune system. 
   
So shedding kind thing, certainly covid vaccines live  Praise be! still alive talk harrowing experience! already poisoned organophosphates, microplastics, antibiotics, radioactive waste. What's little salt? well said. virus known WELL advance. Hey guys, would like join EU? slot opened recently :) editorial least *mentioned* possibility easily spreading variant coronavirus could least partially responsible unprecedented rapid growth cases. UK yesterday labeled strain B.1.617.2, initially found India, variant concern ability spread easily. you‚Äôre wearing mask

Hence multiple things, there‚Äôs magic bullet Even getting affects mental health. Michigan, also large state. point is, see Florida least 2x across board statistics justify repulsiveness thrown COVID response. Lockdowns restrictions come cost cost nowhere worth benefit. numbers reflect that. worked Reagan watched TV film [The Day

Considering obsessed Trump hollywood, definitely would done something different. interesting something never considered. It'll good case study end pandemic see vaccine uptake health systems ownership.  health care systems government owned operated vaccinating private component? Good. screw now! I've got close family states i've seen since October 2019, feel like keep waiting... agreed. orcs  elaborate? Im super mentally tired guidelines. Vaccines lockdown isnt going make work faster opinion. Deaths super low since vvulnerable population vaxxed. look hospital beds Florida every state every day? Agreed. year people still claiming ""forgot"" masks decode go store. Moron forget, need mask 
with even leave house. point, basic keys wallet.

I always least two masks lose something another one biggie. really hard masks expensive especially  sure, good way promote idea getting vaccine people might already hesitant.

Likewise, I'm UK despite fully vaccinated willing take tests, I'm still banned entering US see partner. travelling Mexico Turkey however, I'd free enter, vaccine not. can't help question approach international travel. capable deposited onto you. also reduce flow volumes may prevent aerosol escaping, could reduce distance travel. wish could move Florida still lot dumbasses denial.  use middle man. need use middle man, maybe providing value. got voted down.

However, stories like make optimistic plenty room vaccinated percentage climb running heavy reluctance. stop Lysol wiping groceries now? beginning: spreads surfaces. advanced living Water droplets. spreads living spit. finally reaches airborne state. 

Most rapidly mutating virus ever? Check. 
Went stages spreading ultimate airborne status: check   

So deadly it‚Äôs currently rampaging unprepared countries: Check 

Looks like simulation living decided play quick Plague Inc game That's case smaller alachua towns surrounding counties. They're militantly anti-mask scary. I've screamed wearing mask car random ass strangers cars. (I work 12-18 hour shifts hospitals MEs offices common forget I'm wearing mask.) that's even mentioning Gainesville bar club culture. They're packing places every night unmasked college kids. Makes really wonder WTF years royally fuck confronted something about. never understand... Plus, could politically influenced, about, know, science?! even Europe supplied vaccines, *didn't interfere* drug companies biotech companies deliveries. 

I generally like Biden, understand Americans get priority, extremes US's vaccine nationalism left bad taste mouth. Refusing export vaccines neighbor Canada perfect example. Exporting would gift US government, would simply *not actively preventing* Pfizer/Moderna/AstraZenica wants do. never would worked. Even somehow got Americans would still need workers keep food production going virus likely ""everywhere"" February.

Then add fact gotten zero cases April 2020 would made way back country somehow next year lock downs would begin again. point protests would begin ernest. Oh man remember early days too. remember thinking, ‚Äúmaybe get n95 mask hardware store‚Äù, find sold everywhere. announcement mask shortage public direction buy them.  received first dose Pfizer vaccine 16 days ago. Today, curiosity, one autotests tells developed antibodies Covid. result negative. don‚Äôt seem developed antibody. normal? mean something wrong injection vaccine? Thanks information. USA .. places like this. There's mask mandates unless company wants make one even one really kicks people out... least don't. sister who's Canada surprised went Walmart saw people without masks cause Canada kick people call cops people wear masks... kinda wish strict though. people jail want get sick better. body temp spikes period. fucking blows actually first sign period start I‚Äôm typically average temp feel massively uncomfortable. doctor told actually KNOW ibuprofen, hypothesis. Agreed. Honestly, shortage masks first place. Common Sense dictates matter time United States got hit something nature needed better prepared. would situation walk pharmacy today. Get vaccine, wait three weeks ditch mask stop worrying others. No, third per capita. That‚Äôs direct indictment approach. large states much better. Anyone comparing anecdotes non-official per capita numbers make claims relative state performance lying you. Yup, look Japan Australia comparison.  situation could much different.  

Canada's delivery schedule closely tied what's happening EU.  funny last month would read article Canada's vaccine rollout, one Germany's pretty much article.

Here's daily doses per 100 G7 Nations. Really hard distinguish Canada, Germany, France Italy chart.  UK, US Japan Half society average IQ..... told us wearing N95 masks bad, lost credibility. think depending context could also use refer different legal systems, common vs civil law. there's still lot commonalities US commonwealth nations could. seems mutate something pretty bad anyone that's vaccinated still get sick still mutate something like India's variant mixture couple variants... One spreads well one kills... happens might screwed transforms something vaccines cover like India one vaccines (it seems) it'll harm people vaccinate sure people did. Religion dying cause least less thing bad thing. purposely corrupted Trump administration. It‚Äôs prohibitively expensive. Yes, know. 

I think it‚Äôs crazy last 30 years, minimum standard middle-class house ballooned ‚Äúneeding‚Äù 800sqft per person bit yard, granite countertops etc, school work it‚Äôs fine packed like rats warren. 

We see difference health adequate vs sub-standard crowded housing makes. yet society we‚Äôre cool increasing divide quality private lives, public life, spend many waking hours, left stagnate. 

It hurts everyone run shared institutions like industrial chicken farms. could better drastically different investments. would cost huge amount yes, wealth there. Healthier citizens would create wealth top that. 



As result 1918 flu pandemic, building codes northeastern cities changed require excess boiler capacity, apartment dwellers able open window without getting hypothermia, fewer died. 

Decades passed, people noticed ridiculous energy waste, eventually fixed problem new construction. are, ability Covid-safe indoor environments depending largely age building. forget soon, cities empty consequence. There‚Äôs environmental cost too, though it‚Äôs much harder calculate. You... live hospital? lmao seems people don‚Äôt know difference ‚Äúdroplet‚Äù ‚Äúairborne‚Äù.  shit Sherlock cell nothing. New Zealand entered chat US haven‚Äôt. N95s ‚Äúaerosolizing‚Äù procedures. Otherwise nurses doctors wear regular surgical masks. supplies available could wear N95s potential COVID patients. still can‚Äôt wear non-tested patients. they're like 30 bucks easy wear It‚Äôs almost like nuances can‚Äôt paint whole state one big brush. Hang chill Floridians. mean guy wasn‚Äôt correct. reducing larger droplets important.

I believe may confusing definition aerosol respiratory droplet.

Aerosols generally considered suspended particles &lt;= 5 Œºm droplets much larger. Droplets considered material source airborne transmission due fact incapable suspended air due size.

The comment made /u/cologne2 correct noted previous comment. You‚Äôre thinking type 2 predispositions pre-diabetic prior lockdown. diabetes caused viruses typically type 1 due autoimmune response. Given type 1 shows children primarily children facing great levels covid exposure, it‚Äôs shock you‚Äôre seeing childhood type 1‚Äôs dramatically increase. What's wrong you? agree. person told idiot. really amazing thing guy managed get Mars tarp roof space ship . guy live pandemic disaster Mars‚Ä¶amazing.  Went disaster might keep going on. government said didn‚Äôt need help UN, US, China. Another disaster. know this? Yes PP shouldn‚Äôt said that. However, powerful surface sanitizers companies doused everything beginning pretty harmful. kind stuff hospitals say use caution handle without gloves breathe in. People also used harsh chemicals clean houses including groceries. It‚Äôs bad CDC wasn‚Äôt competent enough upgrade recommendations discourage heavy surface sanitation. Later companies continued say ‚Äúhey we‚Äôre safe, we‚Äôre cleaning surfaces‚Äù mention HEPA filters ventilation like. kind thing mostly medical theatre. frustrated ways balls dropped Uh, said alreasy UK. guarantee we're selfish anyone else planet. Probably so. us born NHS understand crucial socialised healthcare keeping us healthy, body, mind wallet. Beyond that, we're really different culturally Americans all, outside whole obsession guns religion thing. Christ, horrible choice make.

Is anything help? ‚ÄúAnglo saxon countries‚Äù usually refers countries primarily speaking English (UK, US, Australia, Canada etc..)  shot could get help protect Covid terribly deadly discovered disease inflamation clotting. town deaths near-deaths young adult old holidays. Many occurred stubborn people insisted gathering others multi-generational homes one essential worker brought infected fragile one despite precautions. EU leaders treat US like dogs, US decides take care itself, EU leaders start demanding help US. Typical.

Let‚Äôs EU pay it‚Äôs fair share (other) US tax funded research development drugs treatments instead letting citizens get gouged hospitals insurance companies.  Better get stretchin' then. do'er. think single thing anti maskers shit done right point CDC done stellar job.

I'm advocating ignoring science fact let's honest, virus massively mutated course. clearly basics transmitted, works, lower risk spread balanced necessities life figured now.

Their guidance vaccinated person sit public park outside without mask ridiculous me. That's well 1% probability start vaccines 95% efficacy. Like, level risk mitigation aiming here? What's standard? make political like U.S.  Blocking flights mean denying re-entry. They're making harder people certain geographical area arrive directly country. Given high number COVID+ people coming in, legitimate risk breaching quarantine. That's realistic achievable goal. first rule management. Get correct data Working president willing big money interests would extort pressure stir chaos undo all. happened state.

 state locked intending reopen three weeks immediately wedding cake baking housewife generic name hundreds every city (something like Emily Brittany Smith, made background hard find) suddenly showed protesting state government center others Reopen Movement. guess big industry big politics money. sister nurse worked Covid patients. getting vaccine ""democratic hoax."" vaccinated agree.

The protection high enough vaccinated great risk, unvaccinated putting risk. slippery slope demanding vaccine passport.  Yeah I'm social distancing masks well out. getting flu 2020 really nice. think US gets claim pants-down status. shit telegraphed us multiple countries clearly Zelda boss's next move. indoor stagnant airflow, social distancing doesn‚Äôt work

And sadly lot cheaper tell people wear mask stand 6 feet apart tell building owners upgrade ventilation systems, mainly former. both? Maybe virus airborne also travels respuratory droplets. in, school gym windows wide open, small chance catching germs someone 6+ feet away, biggie, infected person sneezes mouth, die ventilator. I‚Äôve reading article like 10 months now. everyone act like new revelation? 6 week interval chosen trials minimum amount time needed.
It done expediency. 
To complete trials faster.
Not optimal immune response. 


When policy adopted. 
Single doses efficacy form England Israel available. 
So data supporting longer dose intervals.
The decision made data. 

It's seemed worked person pointed deaths 3rd wave surge cases. Vaccine cards treat country apart.

I would love torn apart Oh think govt expand scope?

No, already live extremely authoritarian society. Conservatives warn us vaccine passports lead government overreach, also believe armed bands government agents allowed kill anyone everything say. people greatest defenders government expansion. want impact them. Guess what? Public health perfectly valid purpose regulating individual behavior always been. realize difference.

The difference droplet aerosol. types airborne spread. particle supended air, two forces acting - gravity air resistance. Droplets mainly affected gravity, inhale quickly fall ground. Aerosols mainly affected air resistance, suspended lot longer time drift lot gravity eventually brings ground, lot easier breathe in. John Oliver episode testing covered CDC's duck ups pretty well. Came back toward beginning pandemic. slow Japan?   Less effective vaccine might serious side effect seems like reason pause me. options could see going benching worst performer might issues seems like brainer. Basically think CDC differentiates ‚Äúclose contact‚Äù ‚Äúairborne‚Äù. Close contact transmission close proximity, airborne like 6ft more.  Yeah study Starbucks South Korea cemented me. masked staff members spared. worked covid units September last year. Covid never thought need airborne precautions.. droplet precautions. Droplets don‚Äôt stay air long don‚Äôt go much farther 6 feet. Hence 6 feet rule everywhere. Calling airborne virus much worse implications. can‚Äôt believe took long figure out. make sense, old people voter base.

If monumentally fucked covid response would sewn election bag.

IIRC around Jan/Feb obsessed focused impeachment, offloaded covid concerns Kushner company. Kushner insider claims every decision done effects election mind. Kushner fucking incompetent, put Pence charge. Pence looked damn good cameras, Trump pulled Pence started talking TV (a disaster). CDC get audited something? I'm cautious/concerned type, I've supported vast majority mitigation efforts..

But I've come realize statements without real numbers mostly ignored. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think balance alright better new channels dumb horny headlines would called authoritarian something said needed lock hard 4-8 weeks starting March 2020. really radical facts trickling out? would saved 500k+ American lives, well close domestic economy.

India would seem counterpoint that, hard lockdown early on. get wrong, think hard lockdown early pandemic could absolutely stop spread within country. countries implement protocol, follow lockdown ban international travel duration pandemic could restart time. quite Asian countries hailed absolute success stories early experiencing first heavy Covid surges - Cambodia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, etc. lot bad news make ‚Äúsick worry‚Äù  might actually surpass UK. Canada‚Äôs age eligibility lower provinces UK‚Äôs. incredibly smart decision. Kudos though goes UK bravely tried first proved works. US needs make change map country.
Add new border line,and call stupid line. lot less people right next massive nation tons extra doses, canadadians less hesitant americans, pass us fast. approach whole things since February 2020 pessimistic CDC. say something safely, add one extra layer precaution top that.

They say it‚Äôs safe small indoor gatherings masks? I‚Äôll small outdoor gatherings masks.

They say takeout safe? I‚Äôll cook minutes get home.

It‚Äôs clear beginning CDC erring side recklessness, wrong tactic. wiping packages thoroughly probably necessary while? Yeah, didn‚Äôt hurt anyone.

In absence information, it‚Äôs best cautious. Agree, us much appreciation NHS respect work it, apart small minority little gripes like waiting times. narrative start lockdown protecting NHS overwhelmed. also think strict lockdowns, vaccines seen beacon hope get us pandemic. 

I think fact supply vaccines bit lumpy still done priority also helps weird way. scarcity aspect makes seem like 'win' gets turn. Perhaps overabundance US leading bit apathy amongst cohorts. People funny creatures something seen scarce becomes appealing. think people really know though. example, went visit someone last winter person wore mask room together. Yet, soon different rooms, person's mask came off. stop virus spreading though, still build room.

The CDC findings basically says 6 feet apart enough indoors. need good ventilation.  Cases actually high per capita border states, FYI. pandemic hit poor/developing countries hardest, there's one thing that's made crystal clear countries fall category despite much experts tell X country going powerhouse etc. country's covid response good know stand world response bad hanging thread, there's newsflash. small observation small-town. hope someone study see bears out.

 noticed addition mask use indication political leaning, absolute mask-haters know seem subset people who, post-age-35 adults, overtly seek compliments appearance. 

They post lot selfies, answer fake personality tests Facebook, known overly flirty womanizers even married attached. never got past stage life needing (and seeking) constant reassurance appearance attractiveness self-worth. vain; insecure. suppose ""players"" among might sex addiction masks cut ""fishing"" opportunities use smiles signaling. constant compliment seekers upset masks rest us even among taking virus seriously wearing them. saytrump acted way purpose. It‚Äôs gift Putin. wanted America suffer not. would society cease function?? country schools closed long time fine, ideal worked. Ignorance bliss.

Maybe shouldn‚Äôt hang r/coronavirus Thanks broseph It‚Äôs air ... seriously non-N95 masks even work? It‚Äôs like virologists wear medical masks. political appointees there. N95 masks protect wearer, surgical masks (not much people, least). guidance still people wear N95 masks every day due capacity constraints. middling performance. It‚Äôs simple. can‚Äôt claim FL middle pack performance relative states despite mitigation measures place (and made mitigation measures illegal) spiking head pack hospitalizations pandemic receding hard virtually every state took measured response. Florida aggressive anti mitigation efforts state America current performance showing public health cost approach. Unfortunately instruction manual pandemics. one dose strategy saved lives. Look case curve, look death curve. Cases went up, deaths hardly. strategy worked. Plus, we‚Äòve ordered enough doses boosters, needed.  India countering 400,000 daily cases side world.  ordered idea vaccines going work ready first.
So ordered enough every producer cover every one. 

It's like vaccines sitting warehouse. even made yet. 

Once Canada vaccinated doubt hoarding all. We're 20km  Doh. Thought covid coverage outside that. Sorry. :/ can't trying hard enough. long result pushing developing countries' promised Pfizer vaccine shipments queue make way rich twats.  Don‚Äôt forget untapped resources produce N95 masks. factory owner even testified contacted government offer switch making PPE. told weren‚Äôt interested.  Repost April 2020? Right? hope? didn‚Äôt know vaccines would approved produced/shipped first, ordered enough cover entire population multiple manufacturers. eight doses per citizen doesn‚Äôt even include options doses needed.

We‚Äôre going see new endemics popping over, can‚Äôt imagine bad towns cities far fewer vaccinated people. 

We town rural WA state 25% town got infected. Unsurprisingly, 10% town vaccinated. live hand mouth, could.

Now festivals, rallies, can‚Äôt blame society can‚Äôt distance distancing. it‚Äôs Biden admin recently stated support lifting patent protections COVID vaccines Nature pretty forgiving. sell insurance this, affordable. (‡∏á„ÉÑ)‡∏ß cynicism unwarranted. people started masking early people like Fauci told us to. well documented outbreaks Michigan driven primarily younger population, especially high school athletes testing higher rate general population. 

Israel early attempted open schools early failed miserably. 

The UK shut entire school system even shutting every non essential service awhile schools driving pandemic. easily verified information, something I'm going spend time sourcing info on. impossible say COVID 19 airborne schools contribute spread, especially many older buildings poor ventilation. giving companies ""an incredible leg up"" kind imply helps capable manufacturing vaccine? embarrassing amount trouble understanding this, friend explained expressed exasperation people self educating acting ignorant. 

She pointed yes peers may work hard desk jobs, often listening npr working checking news breaks etc., huge numbers people working multiple minimum wage service jobs juggling childcare may checking HHS &amp; CDC Twitter updates forwarding links concerned friends/family 20x day. didn‚Äôt create tripping hazard. enough room run side path, didn‚Äôt need get close. Obviously noticed someone going trip would pull legs in, I‚Äôm allowed stretch sitting would object comparisons? 

Unless arguing nations handled pandemic much better unfair comparison? Japan received 70 million doses EU based factories, 40% total exported within EU, per contract Japan Pfizer. Airborne droplets fly people's mouths noses relatively short distance fall ground. They're relatively large, pretty much old mask, even T-shirt, blocks them, there's direct trajectory droplets emitted mask, OK airtight around sides.

Actual airborne transmission, post about, refers virus hanging air itself, possibly hours. Scientific consensus refused acknowledge recently (see, example, [this May 2021 Lancet). mask airtight going awful lot that. virus much easily get surface mask around completely unprotected sides. Real depth analysis there, doc. Even someone like who's lucky enough sit home day, devastating. üòî Came know demise friend's dad today. lost many known people man. infuriating. last 3-4 weeks, everyday wake hear known people passing away. helpless afraid. Exactly. safe sudden turns ""you hang fellow vaccinated people"" that's assinine. go public vaccinated, safe, period (at least extremely high degree) Perhaps handle well. mean obviously cut transmission ton, seen low flu rate. fact basically stopped influenza year pretty big thing. shows everything huge effect. Imagine much worse would otherwise. Outside densest areas pretty decent job keeping things functional. 

You can‚Äôt expect 0 deaths. something bad Covid I‚Äôd say whole alright. Could better? Possibly. Could much worse? Definitely. Canada get lot doses EU, contrast none US? telling Texas Florida offering virus exposures vaccinated individuals good thing?

Yes, Texas Florida go way India significantly extend pandemic everyone globally.  Yeah, different comments posting places made remember. narrative beginning airborne, stayed home masks useless. narrative droplets, masks social distancing happened outdoor restrictions relaxed. narrative airborne again, wonder happen. People paying great deal attention India South East Asia. fight beginning there. European Commission currently portfolio 2.6 billion doses half dozen approved contract guaranteed 900 million potential 1.8 billion doses EU made 200 million doses available 450 million citizens almost many exported bloc

4.4 billion doses enough every single person EU get nearly 10 doses. might need booster shot every year, imagine exported? Actually, I‚Äôm not. birth country, least. simple countries planet cannot afford buy Pfizer vaccines people STRAW MAN

(walks away)  would masks less effective stopping airborne transmission versus droplets? Everything I‚Äôve read says masks help either way. big difference airborne particles spread droplets. states for?

You'll see Two Weeks‚Ñ¢. Except somehow used people states smugly pat back. previous administration essentially went war CDC. damnedest force downplay Covid.

They're still recovering. Yeah super frustrating. Even people work clinic like that. Fair enough, still small citation? two different scenarios, driving without valid license (serious) failure produce license (minor) It‚Äôs roughly every 3,484.5 6,969. Plus news earlier today CDC nature airborne transmission...

If think big news I'm afraid rest opinions topic really worth much. Yep covid many times contagious flu Oh ok thanks org gets politicized act way CDC did. CDC great record politicized Isn‚Äôt free market works anyway? Super excited this. get use air north vouchers see family! greedy found fourth ring Dante‚Äôs Inferno. Corrupt politicians found lake boiling tar eighth.  Millions would rate 1/1,000. Consider around 3% people village history SARS exposure SARS patients SARS 2015, international team scientists collected blood samples 218 villagers Yunnan lived within four miles bat caves. Six villagers antibodies coronaviruses related SARS-CoV-1, virus caused original SARS outbreak early 2000s. None six individuals known history SARS contact SARS patients observed bats flying villages, suggesting possibility direct infection.

These infections apparently common. Alternatively, they‚Äôre desperate paying top dollar try recover situation, left far behind countries. Buying Pfizer saves embarrassment try cut deal AZ... Hey uhm... think new information. people this? NY seems way shut people unvaccinated possibly getting sick. I‚Äôd ideally prefer open everything 100% right restrictions. I‚Äôd rather world go packed concerts need show proof got vaccinated dystopia locked world live now. Almost negligible compared long covid generalities befitting academic report likely didn‚Äôt take time read. lot people calling CDC please forget CDC outright directly obstructed Trump. Yes essentially That's QR code phone that's sent people gave vaccine walk go walk show card they'll give QR code CVS whatever. way  probably 10% population that. give way much credit. average American considers trip Walmart outing. law area clearly states license caught cop 24 hours show license going office. Nothing wrong that. license driving law either... 

But yes agree vaccine passports exist..  reading something mean support written? everyone stays echo chamber.

Understanding another persons viewpoint vital going change mind.

I know nothing person mentioned I'm defending him, again, know nothing either... Losing license prevent driving though. risk, sure, nobody physically stopping driving. great, vaccine safe enough vary dosage without causing overly-damaging effects.

It's relatable comparison also different live virus start multiplying rapidly, given high enough initial viral load overwhelm immune system's response. would whole point. require vaccine passport place, mask wearing social distancing place gone. Yes exact thing happened Arizona Florida last year heat hit. vulnerable people vaccinated, can't see different, less dangerous mutates much slower. Millions sounds bit much, doubt far undetected vs detected zoonotic influenza infections. Southeast Asia, South Asia, Southern China like 2 billion people, climate population density facilities influenza infections year round. still use sails cruise ships? 

/s radical time, amount shitstom american people would cause told stay locked 8 weeks would've astronomical actually correct depending state. know state (WA) law must license ticket stands even hold valid license. Keep head up. focus positives. I'm sure Tampa lots positives. food good? I'm fully vaxxed I'd go without worries, are, like guy said, call ask wanna know dying discharged.

Well, that's grim. 

They kick 'em die? ;-) shitty cloth masks wear provide *some* benefit definitely end they‚Äôve made be. reputable scientist known better part year related aerosols. 

The whole concept ‚Äúit fine wore mask‚Äù huge driver spread pandemic. protection mask nearly offset increased mixing folks perceived protection masks. 

I also don‚Äôt think bad there‚Äôs really another viable option. It‚Äôs misrepresented year masks = magic bullet stop spread. They‚Äôre outside, little chance possible covid spread. Much less ‚Äúsuper spreader‚Äù event. sorts events encouraged order get society back normal. read 35 billion Euros‚Äîwhich relatively cheap given cost continuing lockdowns.  Thanks assuming give shit laws license every time drive. driver's license suddenly make lose ability drive. driving recklessly license license that's important part. EU country exporting vaccines, Russia China exporting far vaccines EU understand probably consider ones legitimate honestly believe want acknowledge country Canada shortage N95 masks. province specifically stockpile 55 million let expire instead hiring like 5 people rotate stock hospitals year. needed masks even pandemic still buying manufacturer instead getting allocated stockpile might expire 1-2 years. complete waste money lot deaths result. Call don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs you? dude actual government told us that, bold face lie short masks health workers. went far say masks detrimental  No, health risk get participate society there's way prevent spreading virus. CDC joke. remembers said DONT wear mask virus came states?! Walmart? No. That‚Äôs essential service (groceries). Movies? Yes. That‚Äôs essential service. Restaurants? shouldn‚Äôt need one takeout eating outdoors, eating inside. law break? Point people refusing vaccines gives virus opportunity develop variants. seeing variants around world. happens, chance things might resist vaccine.

No one saying let's panic. vaccines push important. much cdc fucked up.

And may fully CDC's fault.

Here's op-ed Dr. Pierre Rollin, retired deputy branch chief CDC's Viral Special Pathogens Branch, says legislators put crippling regulations CDC made difficult retain/replenish talent stonewalled CDC's famed innovation disease research (blocking CDC using non-FDA approved tests even tests created CDC used CDC reference labs - regulatory capture) - [Why CDC sidelines CDC even use alternative diagnostic assay COVID approved blocked Trump's FDA pending emergency use authorization know quite well Trump's handling that. CDC make use use someone else's tests, wait FDA's big pharma friends Yes worse runners cyclists- studies showing unmasked spewing 3 times year sgo 1st bog itallian lockdown. 

Im 99% sure read march closent could find april 2021 

Slipstreams dangerous- runner takes ypu walling mask less good - even mask well. Aerosolizable equate airborne. qualify airborne need demonstrate ordinary conditions infectious aerosol. happens lose drivers' license?  Yup. This. saw people buying weeks - years toilet paper hand sanitizeer thought people couldent trusted stockpile medical masks - lied mask effectiveness benifit hospitals medical staff. 

I mean get thought process caused alllot damage people still think dont need mask. Yes. Everyone CDC apparently.   mean, one days people going wake see much Republicans fucked up. debauchery weakened authority stripped pockets CDC. Ireland household quarantine anyone tests positive seems there's different guidance different countries. CDC like slow kid learns everyone else already knew almost 2 years ago. lie something easy check? Unless death rate per capita matter. aren‚Äôt wearing N95 mask, it‚Äôs mostly prevent droplet transmission, airborne. go back licking counter tops? Sweet. I‚Äôm gonna go ahead guess zero chance young people overwhelming Florida hospitals. Seasonal change bit well  Patriot act also supposed year, know, stop imminent real threat terrorism? I‚Äôm glad government stopped spying us longer necessary. they're backwards shithole, cases/deaths new York? 

Everyone acts like Florida worst state, yet they're middle pack every covid metric (without fucking children learning, nuking actual data sub might help long I, unvaccinated person, resume normal activities, sure. deliveries US Europe 1 million doses so? Japan UK received much more. Exactly article:

""We confident 2 doses BBIBP-CorV efficacious preventing PCR confirmed COVID19 adults (18-59 years)‚Äù

But guess clickbaity enough unfortunately people refuse read headline let alone dive deeper facts. analogy start pandemic could used it! Everything said true, would equally true could ""catch sugar"" someone candy talking near you. Sugar, like insulin, something ""catch"". worst-case scenario, spike protein saliva (which another poster indicated be) would akin exposed allergen. Unlike allergen, tho, remarkable thing happened, would get immune response COVID-19...which exactly give vaccinations. vaccinations easy catch, everyone vaccine producers would happy. biggest determinant age, politics. Young people problem. Thanks! CDC politically corrupted. Ultimately organization name today Trump administration. technically correct say CDC mishandled things. historically CDC gold standard public health organizations public health response. recognized globally leader space. like scientists working CDC got science wrong. bullied silenced, communication world altered. frustrating see people losing faith CDC, actions politicians.  hope evolve Spanish Flu 2. Florida handled coronavirus better states, nuked economy so.

Michigan completely locked yet higher per capita hospitalizations, deaths, cases, etc. well yeah US already vaccinated majority adult population. it‚Äôs harder sustain kind rate. Canada hitting similar wall Oh yes, Michigan never did. well states. Israel UK. real surveillance testing done, found schools contribute quite Abit spread virus.  Please, safeties sake use batteries flared end! No. full approval existing vaccine they‚Äôve distributing. know long affective antibodies would getting vaccine?

There's definitely covid depression, due antibodies. get vaccine worry it. long antibodies effective people contracted virus.

This depends highly severity infection. course do. would ok dropped required mask wearing

1 other, silly Underrated comment! think fucked made mistake, likely curb panic. Everyone knew right away airborne, trump even said recorded audio interview first arrived US. 

They said wash hands, social distance, stay home etc first, kept people freaking causing panic social unrest, though still see panic buying. month later said wear mask droplets, still say fully airborne people sketchy freak many people would avoid work (which bad essential food mandatory supplies keep society functioning). 

It balancing act. many people willing let die also entire society collapse. say panicked, highly doubt it, legit desensitized start lockdown, eased us slowly admitting contagious was.

Those us could see writing wall knew full shit airborne, majority people managed keep dark long enough everyone settle long haul lockdowns go full blown panic mode hey guys.. there's new variant.

what do..?

India Covid crisis: election rallies help spread surge cases moves restrict election-related activities, [**campaign rallies voting states ruling party India, BJP, rejected idea link rise infections.

Millions attend Hindu festival India COVID cases relative. Many follow rules, complacency starts set in.  Never change, Florida....

Actually please change, crazy fucks Electricity: 20$

Delivery fee: 100$

Damn must heavy electricity Please don‚Äôt fall trap thinking makes CDC incompetent. science works. new data comes in, clearer picture gets painted, new recommendations/information come it. would actually worse CDC didn‚Äôt change guidelines time went on. 

The report virus airborne new information. thought aerosol droplets contained virus...so like someone sneezed, saliva came contaminated. logic behind 6 feet apart; someone sneezed coughed, staying 6 feet apart would allow avoid droplets they‚Äôd fall ground. 

However, they‚Äôre saying virus hang air extended periods time (especially indoors and/or areas poor ventilation). sounds like small change...but really big implications.  Damn enough vaccinate SEA countries Mandating would much, least mentioning possibility infection via contact mucous membranes wearing goggles high-contamination situations one can't avoid (like stuck seated small indoor space bunch unmasked people full work day...) could means lowering one's risk. I'm opposite problem, keeps dropping out. See time Reddit. low opinion China. masks comparatively wear masks flu seasons though, even mentioning social distancing. long hauler unintended consequence games goes multiple ways. Locking caused lot people weight gain, missed preventive care screenings, mental health issues, missed education opportunities disproportionately effecting poor, etc. 500k countrymen dead sunday afternoon ya? Yes one shot isn‚Äôt 50% effective, especially younger people 80-90% effective. advocating people skip second shot, advocating misinformation. Similar here. 38, conditions, I'm university professor teaching on-site classes groups 30 students (maybe next year restrictions get relaxed), age prone socialization partying, baby want give long covid. maybe go 50-somethings definitely go 20-somethings... long wait much teaching double masks, really want ditch age groups finishing 40-49 group maybe among last able get vaccine. get hate giving insight around others. biggest takeaway easy pull massive lifestyle shifts due perceived threat. Like personal responsibility exist anymore governments shut entire industries always knew airborne, would explain spread like wildfire. Probably massive. end benefit higher. I'm hoping cost matter country. Seems like Biden EU said much want vaccine first. Americans getting fully vaccinated I'm hoping see shipments central America begin pick up. nice beaches though, although would never want visit Miami ""This video essay, raw nerve""
- Dan Olson, talking Contagion I've seen (not read) studies regarding contradict other. One might correctly done really matter looking headline. People tend quote studies align opinion. Although stores also prohibit weapons protected second amendment, although love angle like reasonable prophetic predictions person following news could made. Vaxpass last year maximum. implement it, save tons lives getting people get vaccinated. Hell 10 million would huge allow us start getting 2nd shots. Yea relief. much change terms masking keeping distance definitely huge stress minds. 

Also sweet Microsoft swag received 5g upgrade unexpected! /s
- written new Microsoft surface pro 7 üòù Please make said store bank. BO likely can't smell though. Problem solved! /s invented made vaccine sooner! Fail!

You really clue....... Oh mean variants already vaccines work on? Riiiight, let‚Äôs panic. know people's opinion teachers union plummeted selfishness anti science Ski goggles usually sealed misting problems. Paint lap Google's really want particles eyes. Using outlier countries barometer prove argument. better comp would western countries Europe, Florida would 18th 47 (upper middle 47) deaths per million @ 1660. Sweeden, everyone ragged on, ironically median (24th) 1396 per think really call infectious disease killing people scandal, especially literally hit everywhere. Unless willing lock boarders completely (no travel, immigration, restrictions), 18 months kind unavoidable (for third world countries probably 3 years). yet, states opened schools never saw increased spread yet. even enough Canadians yet.

The plan always give away surplus countries need them. get them.  Apply reasons flu understand illogical.  talk wife February 2020 trip visit family Hong Kong seen years way make look like Nostradamus 0 evidence.

I drew every new point evidence came out, related historical knowledge first 2003 SARS1 outbreak. 

We sent HK family care package masks, sanitizer, vitamin C tablets, herbal teas, etc.... took long arrive ended sending back us plenty supplies outbreak worsened home.  actually research dangers fucking bleach?

Dangers include:

Losing dick. thought established back suddenly changed mind masks? No, makes masks government restrictions nearly useless. completely missed point risk hospitalisation death covid young people much (or even lower) flu. rational act flu season. Red governor bad. Blue governor good. Right? Government see anything anyways, let‚Äôs ban passwords install cameras bathrooms! 

Your ‚Äúlogic‚Äù mind-numbingly stupid. government already abuses authority citizens‚Äô rights make easier? says needs implemented government? Private businesses could require like require masks now. Even places mask mandate like florida Texas, businesses still requiring them. know business better everyone feels safe. Playing long game Maybe start wearing masks something limit spread airborne particles...

Oh wait  Yeah, depends context suppose situation, would ironically amusing. it‚Äôs frustrating asinine I‚Äôm left wondering human race made long? Im tired shit. CDC hasn‚Äôt handled airborne element covid well all, say least. knew beginning possible, believed uncommon certain situations. 

I didn‚Äôt understand last part comment, locking down. people work home, reducing indoor capacity, distancing measures help suppress spread airborne illness purposes preserving hospital capacity. mean masks weren‚Äôt useful initially conveyed? hope future zombie movies stop using CDC ""place be"" safe. Temporary government measures rarely turn temporary. K. said China soldering people apartment buildings December 2019. Leading minds here. Lol currently facing charges criminal stalking; previous plea deal drop rescinded due criminal activity. 

She lied role Florida‚Äôs Covid response; filled data ArcGIS template fired locking lead GIS guy dashboard management; state eventually go ESRI even get access back.

She‚Äôs bad news, even Jake Tapper CNN says word unreliable. think anyone posted one fuk Yeah makes sense add that. digital drivers license stupid card they're gonna make something different completely. (I'm pa) everything catered Americans? EU correct one. IP waiver short term solution, US allowing exports is, particularly there's supply demand currently. time. Except research funded governments world mosrpt cost nobody ever talks that.. leaders say safeguards prevent anyone‚Äôs information stolen, critics argue much personal data phone ***is risky.***

at least purses wallets fingerprint locks. fatigue come back day 3/4. It‚Äôs unheard exercise helped scaled back quite bit found could little day. Electrolytes help well. unusual. people recover quickly. Others take bit longer. I‚Äôd rest feel better believe that. NJ target hit 70%. 12-15 year old vaccine approved, we're likely smash it. Besides, wanna see NJ mask years years come. Even Murphy want that. hoping remove mask mandate. see lasting long.

Secondly, articles like discourage people wanting take vaccine. point vaccinated return normal life. pessimistic articles come out, it'll discourage public. Interesting! Thanks posting sources, good reads Carrots work. Lots Nepalis cross border work India, get quite political times. car USB port situations.

you look getting one. originally likened someone smoking joint party side room, long would could smell it. course, see marijuana smoke. Agree points Instead mask could wear ‚ÄòI‚Äôm vaccinated‚Äô button. well that's problem  think don‚Äôt care. u dude. I‚Äôve lived worst place thing per capita multiple times high risk family apt complex almost one gives space wears mask. don‚Äôt even mask mandates. wearing mask works it. walking around without one encourage others get vaccinated? would assume im another person refuses wear one? I‚Äôm telling anyone else vaccinated? barely two weeks past second vaccine. always reevaluate time goes on. shot. fittingly American. Doesn‚Äôt seem unrealistic it‚Äôs widely reported herd immunity may tough achieve US private businesses define requirements type business willing conduct? Darn. link? it‚Äôs literally flaired ‚ÄúUSA‚Äù. don‚Äôt blame lack awareness anybody else, that‚Äôs you. still MIGHT you‚Äôre also coming outside There‚Äôs lots ignorance too, it‚Äôs vacuum, huge swaths people can‚Äôt distance matter want eat. percentage risks, like guaranteed get situation, expose enough high risk situations probably get it. I'm seeing articles saying MAJORITY parents want kids vaccinated. includes parents vaccinated. strange, that's polls showing. Ireland ? nah, thanks shitty ‚Äúinput‚Äù discussion anyway Hm. seems immunosuppressant. Nice. one depends EU defense. depend US. know frankly massive relief know private companies virtually unrestricted access personal information behavioral data, government made database check vaccination status draw line

/s Officially, required indoors crowds. 

Unofficially, us wear put others ease strangers can‚Äôt know we‚Äôve vaccinated.

I think self-serving purpose vaccinated person wear mask protect infection caused variant might harder current vaccines thwart, isn‚Äôt likely. also vaccinated wearing masks safe.

Do think attitude encourages hesitant get vaccine actually go get one? 

Do think ‚Äújust safe‚Äù attitude encourages people trust science demonstrates efficacy available vaccines?

Do think helping hurting situation? clear PA. still give ticket... Even first time. like know are. They'll look info car documents (insurance, registration). show license 24 hours. make sense you? reason license show legally drive look already systems cars... makes harder them... law 24 hours go police office show id ticket thats it. pay right also think yeah penalty license. I'm guessing states like idk.   True it‚Äôs crossed log names location used. It‚Äôs easier guess name friend know would harder know lot number unless saw somebody else‚Äôs card. That‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying people shouldn‚Äôt showing part card social media. definitely difference, much sub implies. reliable factor predicting vaccine uptake age. Nearly 50% young people vaccine hesitant 65+ demographic 10% hesitant. Despite want ro imply biggest issue conspiracy theories; complacency. People (especially young people) stopped fearing COVID long ago really care enough get vaccinated. need bring vaccine they'll probably never go seeking out. beauty technology possibilities creates also capacity imagine solutions ideas come innovations.

No. vaccine *not spreading vulnerable populations*. protects well great, entire point getting enough people vaccinated protect **cannot** vaccinated health reasons. feels like clickbait discouragement. might seem like stretch now, opens door things like makes far easier require ‚Äúpassports‚Äù kinds things.

Pfizer buy vaccines. government entities, costumers case, (public) funds BioNTech vaccine came EU member states.

But funding development BioNtech vaccine first came China. March 2020 Fosun Pharma invested 135 million USD development BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. April 2020 BioNTech signed partnership Pfizer including 185 million USD investment Pfizer development BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. private investments. Later, June 2020, BioNTech received 120 million USD funding European Commission European Investment Bank. September 2020 Germany (EU member state) invested 445 million USD BioNTech well. Thus total EU member states invested around 565 million USD development BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. US government invested BioNTech vaccine Operation Warp Speed, Pfizer decided taking funds program development vaccine.  Japan lot vaccines delivered used much it?

It like one week... I‚Äôm curious Disneyworld do?

I feel like wouldn‚Äôt good business either can‚Äôt least require employees vaccinated. ever good time Disney fight get want, would this. ever catch nightclub Vossi Bop comes on, realise error statement. would they? intended block deal would become public regardless. ""Die Welt"" garbage newspaper published garbage publisher [Axel shitty source drew even shittier conclusions. vacinated, go get vaccinated. best thing prevent covid work retail 16 year olds work company fully vaccinated.

Yes herd immunity thing strive for, may possibly way ""incentivize"" people get vaccine otherwise wouldnt.

That said, 16 year olds 60 year olds dont, 60 year olds flat see vaccine viable option exist life get it.

Public health safety overrides first amendment (which extreme hate speech protected, example), really force vaccine people theory. Whether that's good bad you, would say best interest long term public health, even though dont like idea.

I'm fully vaccinated though, eventually I'll comfortable saying fuck em dont want it. Engulfed. language Western media uses foreign issues really sensationalized. disagree lot levels. India's first lockdown, called one brutal inhumane. Could better? Absolutely. best poor nation could 

The situation polar opposite. first lockdown PR stunt promote strong man image, literally cities 0 cases shut. Right now, healthcare facilities collapsing, need lockdown right now. Maybe nationwide, atleast guideline something guide states. 

 vaccine roll-out criticised constantly. yeah make many mistakes. far see 3 countries - US, UK Israel actually managed right. Everyone else failed.

There levels failures, Indian government easily worst failure. mean health minister telling parliament government never planned vaccinate everyone, simultaneously promoting fucking coronil. buy doses advance, exported doses vaccinating at-risk population. rejected foreign vaccines delusion nationalism, building 20000 crore building delhi, completely unneccesary. give grants manufacturing companies time. clearly wanted save money vaccinating bare minimum, countries might failed, atleast lack intent. 

 week, 30 countries EU/EEA administered total 150 million doses. India - much much much poorer nation administered 167 million.

We around 3 times larger EU well. no, poor nation excuse picture government sanctioned 20 thousand crore rupees central vista, could bought 100 crore covishield vaccines money, assuming RS200 price. simply ridiculous. 

 one point, nations made 14% world population pre-booked 50% vaccines.

And reason biggest vaccine manufacturer world one them. BJP government book covishiled covaxin vaccines either, could have. Hell, India 6th largest economy world, could easily first ones vaccinated. spoke mates Netherlands, Italy Switzerland (I normally live Holland. Currently back home due pandemic) - one age group 18-45 anywhere even close getting vaccine yet 25 year old received first dose.

Genuinely happy getting first dose. Sincere congratulations. hoping get one too. case simply anecdote truth at-risk population vaccinated, forget 18-45. nowhere close main reason 2nd wave. 

They simply are. would tried vaccinate at-risk population fast possible, trust me, intent possible, could avoided overloading hospitals people died due lack oxygen. 

And let's forget BJP government OPENLY promoting kumbh, enforced multi-stage election west bengal, Modi boasting huge crowds rally day 2.5lakh cases. leader nation does, expect people. Maharshtra undergoing brutal second wave, prime minister health minister rallying 24x7 bengal, instead helping Maharashtra, trying prevent second wave country. Here‚Äôs something positive least. Painful Always check. Good job! I'm vaccinated think government (or corporations) power determine gets participate society. poor government. Sending man hell. what? Even America 100% vaccinated, rest world still full blown pandemic still seriously bad news. people get ever newer variants. Asia right getting hit variant variant coming worst hit countries.

No matter well country, rest world still shambles, eventually fall like them.

This absolutely necessary rich countries actually something besides hoarding vaccinating own. DRDO lab Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy's Laboratories developed anti-Covid therapeutic application drug 2-deoxy-D-glucose Drugs Controller General India (DCGI) cleared drug clinical trial results showed molecule present drug helps faster recovery hospitalised patients reduces supplemental oxygen dependence.   subs like dominated depressing insufferable shitheads. coming something historical context wasn‚Äôt even bad took 15 months... live greatest golden age world ever known. yep... hopeful problem. shall call science 2.0 one time they.lied twice last year would mean something. instead another business motivated making.decisions based money science. didn‚Äôt misplace gave America didn‚Äôt want say loud.

 Kurt Stenger 06.05.2021

The pressure U.S. government agree release patents Covid vaccines ultimately became much: would actively engage talks World Trade Organization (WTO) temporarily lift patent rights Corona vaccines, example, Washington's Trade Representative Katherine Tai announced. world must respond global health crisis extraordinary measures, said.

The background debate request India South Africa submitted World Trade Organization back October. calls suspension certain aspects TRIPS agreement intellectual property rights vaccines, medicines medical equipment connection Covid-19. countries would agree waiver - USA EU countries particular vetoed far.

Since Joe Biden took office, increasing calls change position USA. Experts NGO representatives launched appeal, April numerous Democrats U.S. Congress joined in. Incidentally, demand also directed directly U.S. government, National Institutes Health (NIH) possession important basic patents mRNA vaccines due joint research manufacturer Moderna. patents could released immediately, detour via WTO would take time. fact movement probably also connected fact vaccination campaign USA, advanced stage, faltering large number skeptics, vaccine doses available abundance.

The inequity distribution Covid vaccines date evident. Seventy percent orders date expected go developed countries. G7 countries already projected oversupplied end summer 2021. World Health Organization (WHO) recently sharply criticized fact Africa far accounted 2 percent vaccinations - 16 percent world's population. Even considering continent less affected Corona regions, glaring disparity.

But patent release advance global immunization Global South all? answer cannot given blanket manner differs different types vaccines. mRNA vaccines, outlook negative. U.S. manufacturer Moderna already announced October 2020 would enforce patent rights Covid-19 vaccine. probably mainly image reasons, date one accessed patents. Since completely new manufacturing process, one actually anything patents - probably several dozen vaccine. Even big pharmaceutical companies, new territory; junior partners small biotech companies Moderna, Biontech Curevac, first painstakingly trained. takes many months set convert single plant mass production.

In order able expand production mRNA vaccines, cooperation needed all. Large corporations experience mass production, sufficient capital. collaborations exist: Biontech, example, production carried Pfizer, China, Fosun Pharma Shanghai taken commercialization. aim therefore expand licensing partnerships. Countries could provide financial support this. another option manufacturing countries: ""The TRIPS agreement would allow member states establish special form compulsory licensing pharmaceuticals manufactured exclusively export least developed countries unable themselves,"" explains Reto Hilty, director Max Planck Institute Innovation Competition.

For production, however, entire know-how also basic patents would ultimately passed on. Since novel process seen great future prospects diseases, neither U.S. EU willing so. pharmaceutical industries declaring weeks case research innovation vaccines new Sars-CoV-2 mutants would hardly continued. Whether empty threat cannot answered. lobby finding ears open.

However, expansion mRNA vaccine production would also fail due practical problems. global shortage important precursors. one manufacturer modified guanine nucleotides, serve cap vaccine molecule, barely handful lipid nanoparticles, package mRNA ensure better transport body's cells.

For covid-19 vaccines, story different. Vector vaccines, harmless viruses effect enhancer trigger immune response, already produced Ebola epidemic. Inactivated vaccines, inactivated virus components administered, use time, including hepatitis B influenza. ""For conventional vaccines, supply chains already exist,"" explains Sebastian Ulbert Fraunhofer Institute Cell Therapy Immunology. ""Mass production viruses something well established recent decades. we're talking production specific viruses Sars-CoV-2 vaccines.""

With technological knowledge available countries, well experience production, patent release could potentially help. quickly, possibly end 2021, experts suspect. However, Astra-Zeneca's vector vaccine already produced every continent except Africa (South Africa skeptical unclear efficacy virus mutant rampant there), large quantities produced India world's largest vaccine maker. Astra-Zeneca already criticizing India hoarding large quantities supplying poor countries agreed. subcontinent currently suffering huge wave infections. problem patents, produce two vaccines, including one developed themselves, little production capacity vaccination campaign barely making headway.

A patent release would affect others Astra-Zeneca: U.S. group Johnson &amp; Johnson, example, producers China Russia. countries already supply numerous countries Global South use foreign policy purposes, much annoyance USA. would thing past manufacturers countries enter production themselves. U.S. government's change course patent issue also clever foreign policy move?

Products vaccines play hardly role patent debate. Yet therapies covid 19 diseases less important vaccines. Thanks capacities India, example, low-cost generic drug production could provide important services fight pandemics.

Back vaccines: patent release would perhaps bring something half year. could also take even longer, since slightly modified vaccines would go new approval procedures basis patents. India shows faster solutions needed. all, huge mass production various Covid vaccines going many regions. problem relatively high price mRNA vaccines - here, home countries could exert pressure - and, all, distribution: rich industrialized countries secured 1.9 billion vaccine doses need herd immunity countries, criticizes Tom Hart, executive director development organization One. would diverted.

But time factor also plays critical role regard WTO waiver itself: proposed waiver patent rights would apply duration pandemic. Since vaccination campaigns progressing well many countries countries epidemic control certain measures, point declare pandemic over. Then, poor states still deal Corona waves - usual tropical diseases anyway.

Despite that, CDC still cleared going massless outdoors fully vaxxed folks. Yes unfortunately. India Nepal open borders since travel India banned many countries, many Indians taking flights Nepal.

Additionally world mothers decending onto goa behaving like ain't pandemic Early Chinese studies posted like February 2020 detailed bus passenger transmission. obvious then.

Oof Thats evolution works. Stupid people make stupid decisions die off. Modern medicine society postponed things, end stupid people every year.

The EU perfectly capable producing enough vaccines needs, well export countries like Canada Japan (since US unwilling export doses recently) done since beginning.

This demand US start exporting countries order meet GLOBAL vaccine demand, i.e. outside EU US.

By way, Biontech/Pfizer vaccine developed Germany Janssen/J&amp;J vaccine developed Netherlands (or Belgium?). 100% ""developed made USA"" vaccine actually Moderna (but Moderna also production facilities Switzerland countries). except asymtomatic transmission anybody first week two infected symptoms appear (and never symptoms still transmit) common way.

Vaccine rollout privatised, monopolised underfunded. Experimental vaccines used pfizer etc kept away.

BJP RSS main reason mess. cornered money, centralised pandemic response, flouted norms, called massive elections held massive festivals. 

nice try though. Israel already vaccinated majority joke is, much population focused supposedly try create hysteria, fact almost every mistake made attempting downplay events. Well actually did, stopped/slowed delivery significantly months plant retrofitted increase capacity, promised increased deliveries done Better get vaccinated something okayed emergency use studies longterm effects virus 99.99% survival rate age demographic. EXACTLY I'm talking say even though hate hate hate large corporations normally, eliminating patent protections guarantee people get access shot. 

We live terrible world run terrible people, think opening manufacturing vaccine suddenly lead everyone getting along manufacturing pennies dollar, proof positive happen. 

Would alternatives patent eased? Sure!

The science yet conclusive this.

First, vaccination magic shield. _can_ vaccinated still infected Covid-19. infected Covid-19, certainly transmit virus regardless vaccination status. Though open questions transmissible virus might be, typical vaccinated person's viral load is, etc.

Secondly, far ""herd immunity"" goes there's generally little distinction required largely immune due exposed virus vaccine. Herd immunity similar concept fire going runs fuel burn. enough vaccinated people infected person likely encounter small percentage vulnerable others relative number would unvaccinated population bring R0 sufficiently close zero, reached herd immunity.

So, question herd immunity virus needs whether non-infected vaccinated people transmit virus. present, best evidence strongly suggests people vaccinated likely able significantly transmit virus.

As research conducted coming months definitive answers question.

For moment, however, lack sufficient evidence abundance caution means official guidance presume vaccinated individuals capable transmission.

In short, _absolutely can_ reach herd immunity vaccination get enough people vaccinated quickly enough prevent mutations virus. Profiting backs poor sick, profiteers ashamed themselves. hope friends Nepal finally get vaccinations help keep communities families healthy. vaccination part science go well comparison?

Masks work catch wearing one. nuance much public unfortunately. Trump also vaccinated.. tried keep secret followers.  Yeah. It‚Äôs hilarious. Gov telling companies - projections. majority 12-15 adult sized seems like straight forward. haven‚Äôt heard issues 16-17 year olds, probably similar ? agree. personal protection 50% way fucking lower 95% (i know numbers rough, 94% 95% huge) Yes, course. trying speakof people yet vaccinated. Ya doesn‚Äôt make sense, ‚Äúeast coast‚Äù usually means like North Carolina Maine. people might disagree, south it‚Äôs South, still technically America‚Äôs east coast, kinda seen way? doesn‚Äôt make sense. I‚Äôd say vaccine passports become norm, expect see this. irony people selling fake vaccine cards fully vaccinated themselves. I‚Äôm guessing indoors storm. Yes China bad Xi Pooh Bear. Reddit says so. tax payers? making gov't pharma companies immune. already posted medical standpoint treating airborne start. Negative pressure isolation, N95 masks, etc. None ever changed. need CDC tell us. What‚Äôs wrong nasal swab?? need remedy loved one adverse reaction drug put body.

The govt pays. part Florida talking about? It‚Äôs like North Florida all. work hospitals see hospitalizations. Ships returning United States federal jurisdiction assuming said person isn‚Äôt interacting me, example conversation presumably without mask, outside. many minutes conversing many? person talking loudly it‚Äôs windy? 

You shouldn‚Äôt concerned briefly walking jogger, agree there. Right. It‚Äôs doubly absurd. ‚Äú considering lockdown‚Äù ... uhmmm what. considered now? feel bad people. leadership horrible. keys:

* No-cost: free masks distributed door-to-door

* Offering information mask wearing via video brochures

* Reinforcement in-person, in-public

* Modeling endorsement trusted leaders

The important one person reinforcement someone ask put mask. little bit shame awkwardness mainly reason. well know FACT China since Feb 2020  established National Health Committee Especially tests required vaccines available... principal things, Nepal govt victim here, middleman blamed It‚Äôs common Type 1 caused viral infection. people get caught ‚Äúdurr diabetes caused fat‚Äù don‚Äôt realize type 1 caught all. It‚Äôs autoimmune issue viral infection cause it, it‚Äôs virus nastier widespread. 

I worked elementary schools quite awhile common time kids get type 1- likely schools Petri dishes don‚Äôt enforce rules like coming school sick sorts weird fuck viruses spread like wildfire.  eyes. Come visit see yourself. Always quite amusing see non-Brits make statements like that. we're armed AR-15's, mean tongues Boris' asshole. you‚Äôre going make claims like NEED provide source. you‚Äôre saying directly contradicts lot people heard vaccine. really want take baseball bat lindells head.. sorry, whiffleball bat, I'm violent Maybe America UK.

Edit: user name doesn‚Äôt check 50 percent, every 50 100 people. last 24 hours I‚Äôve seen ‚Äúnews‚Äù Covid 19 deaths almost million US, Covid 19 spread via airborne several ‚Äúanonymous sources‚Äù hit pieces recently ex-pres. Wonder media feels need scare people submission again? unlikely real factor. Health workers often seriously ill got infected thus likelihood serious illness same, occur group. lost part hearing due swine flu. Lost part eyesight kid due chickenpox (pox leading corneal scarring eyes, really gnarly, I‚Äôm lucky blind. one family needs glasses except readers they‚Äôre quite older.) Also vagina candle exploded someone‚Äôs living room Hopefully next time debate half year still fail provide simple facts disease prevention spelled breathing wrong Yes, temporary. Deliveries expected decrease coming weeks. virus airborne almost year half still know anyone who's gotten despite town supposed ""hotspot"". Bad headline.

Read article, folks. We've got fair share UK knew aerosolized March 20‚Äô. save EU right now, good news.
Still weird see seem fully change single-source strategy. wonder Moderna going do, expand massively Switzerland shot expensive developing countries. no, guarantee much possible dont matter stats area. September everyone offered first shot, regardless whether they'll take not. nothing uptake. delay due uncertainties regarding J&amp;J vaccine. Hello, got first vaccine pfizer yesterday, today woke extreme dizziness can‚Äôt even get bed! normal. pisses much knowing anti vaxxer anti mask anti everything cousins right thinking they've game beat government shit? Bruh please save child late I‚Äôm 100% people wearing strongest mask access too, it‚Äôs ok protect yourself, especially way early impossible get even surgical masks, let alone n95s. Sounds like wasn‚Äôt case person replied to, that‚Äôs said it. catch what's going India. thought ppl getting vaccinated vaccine news r flying around recently. I'm 37 underlying conditions severe enough get ahead line. really frustrating knowing vulnerable Covid-19 lot 50-somethings getting shots now. Safety testing...? announcement huge contract extension comes European Union looking ways meet challenges necessary booster shots, possible new variants drive vaccinate children teenagers. 

America‚Äôs Pfizer Germany‚Äôs BioNTech already said would provide EU extra 50 million doses 2nd quarter year, making faltering deliveries AstraZeneca.

In contrast oft-criticized Anglo-Swedish AstraZeneca, von der Leyen said Pfizer-BioNTech reliable partner delivers commitments. suppose get letter since February still received one get vaccinated, life rich country üòë Japan would like word, it‚Äôs ok Olympics!! much wish past administration would forthcoming doubt would made much difference. anti-maskers Covid deniers would still done damage. didn‚Äôt get ideas administration administration got ideas them. Virus smarter us CDC historically competent. recently been... strong. Airlines. People still learned never learn. drag humans new sub? mean guy wasn‚Äôt correct. reducing larger droplets important. Yep mention people vaccinated thinking safe variants not, probably safer may get less sick still catch spread new variants. That‚Äôs everything need know Yeah, occurred forms. early COVID TwiV episode last year talks Hong Kong. Aerosolisation bad plumbing. Abstract:

Deterioration sometimes unexpected SARS-CoV2 infection. aim study establish laboratory predictors mortality COVID-19 disease help identify high risk patients. patients admitted hospital due Covid-19 disease included. Laboratory biomarkers contributed significant predictive value predicting mortality clinical model included. Cut-off points established, finally risk score built. 893 patients included. Median age 68.2‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ15.2¬†years. 87(9.7%) admitted Intensive Care Unit (ICU) 72(8.1%) needed mechanical ventilation support. 171(19.1%) patients died. 

A Covid-19 Lab score ranging 0 30 points calculated basis multivariate logistic regression model order predict mortality weighted score included haemoglobin, erythrocytes, leukocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, creatinine, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer. Three groups established. Low mortality risk group 12 points, 12 18 included moderate risk, high risk group 19 points. Low risk group reference, moderate high patients showed mortality 4.75(CI95% 2.60‚Äì8.68) 23.86(CI 95% 13.61‚Äì41.84), respectively. C-statistic 0‚Äì85(0.82‚Äì0.88) Hosmer‚ÄìLemeshow p-value 0.63. Covid-19 Lab score easily predict mortality patients moment admission secondary SARS-CoV2 infection. simple dynamic score, easily replicated. could help physicians identify high risk patients foresee clinical deterioration. Florida also number 3 population size. nothing damning here. another manipulation data drive narative Sweden like one 5-year block every 3-4 weeks. Currently 55-59 year olds 18+ underlying conditions live, that's expected last least end May. end June might 45-50, opening everyone 18 September. Scares think placing government completely charge healthcare reason. 

They incentive function well shows viruses becoming smarter faster pace us wouldn‚Äôt go store like that. Everyone done disservice focusing deaths hospitalizations much. early pandemic data started coming multi organ impacts Covid, starting cardiac issues blood clotting. locked hard vaccination remained cautious even vaccinated long term impacts disease frightening. doubt many people would say life long diabetes reasonable price pay engaging year distanced social activity. guess less noise scent signal, mask restricting particles get nose. like idea too. Could be, elevated awareness scent wearing mask. Probably combination variety things. entire post everyone's reaction shows extreme lack critical thinking, fact checking, basic knowledge subject matter. frankly embarrassing. Thank you. blows mind. Otherwise rational people, disregarding every ounce logic could mustered... Completely nonsensical. matter, spike protein, whole virus. can't replicate itself. can't infect even get body own. Palm Beach County here. I've seen signs like that, doubt second. We're surrounded cavemen. believe length trial least 3 months demonstrate safety depends long takes enough infections placebo group demonstrate efficacy.

For instance, 12-15yo enrolled January submitting 4 months later, unfortunately community rates age group high.

Under 12yo results, therefore sooner June, depend community rates. study knows many positives need providing September estimate based that, imagine conservative, predicted December previously, could sooner. keep zombies away United States individualized society. freedom benefit individual rather greater good.  Point need choose energy (battery) wiping ass water, would choose toilet paper? lucky... assholes also car distributor Nepal Toyota. Exactly, don‚Äôt bidet let ass air dry. bother wiping it‚Äôs gonna get dirty again? also wanna mistaken antimasker. sorry.

This sort mindset needs stop needs stop now. posted believe we're hitting point U.S. there's big psychology issue play. live SF CDC local government said stop wearing masks outside, still lot people outside wearing biking/running/etc. reason person wearing mask person B wearing mask, reason person B wearing mask person wearing mask. stupid.  Agree. whole ""Florida mask all!"" bs - bullshit.  government might requiring masks, businesses are. vast majority people comply. Michigan ... majority cases 40. Type 1 known caused viral infections it‚Äôs autoimmune issue. It‚Äôs really covid virus, virus it. However, nasty covid much exposure it, it‚Äôs showing noticeable uptick.

This really life didn‚Äôt understand people wrote ‚Äúas flu‚Äù like ‚Äúany mild illness.‚Äù lost part eyesight hearing due viral infections young (my sight due chickenpox, partial hearing loss due flu) hell would anyone want gamble like this? really think instead talking generic long haul covid, seems sound similar chronic fatigue syndrome, talk conditions like Type 1 diabetes develop. think right!

It‚Äôs Public Relations Move improve supply-side all. Everything know Jacksonville learned Good Place. Wow... 18 months later. 2025 Alberta news.. water, WET! cdc make statements like enough data absolutley sure, tough gather properly half fucking population supposed do. Yeah, Diamond Princess me, too. Word people getting virus China pretty contagious. cruise ship would best venue virus basically anything spreads quick it. Might first case close proximity real killer virus. Next places basically bars, restaurants, nightclubs, parties, family get togethers, etc. 

The worst spike cases always seemed mostly come areas seemed enclosed remember family get togethers controversial hard knock since everyone‚Äôs protective family. always knock public gatherings soon turns private, hands off. yet another instance much basically fend virus pre-vaccine. Based behavior, may like years years perhaps turn deal flu. Hopefully vaccine‚Äôs effectiveness stay‚Äôs year year updated shot seems takes one mistake we‚Äôre back square one. hope nothing else new comes up. ""Sars-CoV-1"" (and believe Sars-CoV-2 well?) confirmed outbreak apartment building virus spread plumbing house ventilation bath rooms, something like that. doesn‚Äôt actually go veracity claims all. 

Any issues woman may relationship don‚Äôt discredit claims. 

Florida pretty clearly trying downplay severity pandemic early reporting deaths cases state people caught Covid Florida related state, despite ongoing tourism many snow birds effectively living much early pandemic. later reversed course started report limited data state cases deaths don‚Äôt appear comparative totals vs states. One could argue primary engine FL‚Äôs middling economic performance pandemic willingness export Covid long tourism remained open. think read wrong sell potentially harmful products, even capitalist society. However, $75 candles harmful far know, unless price inflated shake disaster victims full lead toxins. There's hunger among never end. half expect op-eds coming next 6 months like ""10 reasons need another pandemic"" omits 'I desperately need attention' reasons 1-10.  universal Leon (tallahassee) also heavy leaning believe several governments across world got caught pants speak, US . France fell victim nonsense, told masks necessary ? masks reserves years cutting public health budgets. Greed pure simple  think downvote record me! Every self-righteous cockpirate give pat back! made world better place. Well, he'd waited 3 weeks start medical bodies essentially said caused thousands avoidable deaths. eat help think helped along significant resurgence October time. letting meet Christmas, help start year spike. 

So say UK best terms lockdowns decision making regard. Really we've turned corner smartly threw insane amount money vaccine processes orders. That's best decision they've made pandemic TIL, thanks behind, talking Spanish flu kids passing around mild severe colds past 5 weeks want get shots lol. Anyone minor cold get vaccinated? Yeah I‚Äôve seen 2 ships docked time. Others could anchor river would disrupt traffic.   Floridian, damn frustrating. Ron DeSantis absolute fucking dogshit, many people love part gets it. Key West part state Florida, cruise line allowed check passengers vaccinated, Key West like Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Orlando rest Florida

DeSantis toad Bullshit. live USA.  He's not. took two seconds look posts see he's lying shitbag American. can't read article. difficult. US equivalent 3.27 million jabs I‚Äôm sure recognized long time nothing due talk masks potential people use excuse wearing masks all. Super convenient comes shortly mask mandates lifted throughout many parts country. He‚Äôs talking pandemic status; endemic status inevitable. That's wrong, knew early want talk it.

Believe me, avoid making statement forums pointing low death rate end day compared many infectious diseases death rate isn‚Äôt high. It‚Äôs infectiousness really got us screwed. 

That said numbers also ignore devastating toll long term side effects, message always deaths people rely anecdotal evidence. know one elderly person survived don‚Äôt care. public health messaging missed mark many ways.

It's incredibly frustrating. That‚Äôs population votes Republicans. Hmmm. Almost correlation GQP anti vaxxers conspiracy theorists. acknowledge possibility moved money opportunity opportunity b. know happened. discount all. 

But example, keeping fairly stable research development budget huge risk. shifting one opportunity next. going vaccine, would something else. 

Pfizer offsets R&amp;D budget lobbying slightly tweaking formulas bypass generic drug status. risk bigger head business model. 

But also know risk scary. Researchers trying develop mRNA therapy years even attempt failure, would usher trillion dollar industry. use cases mRNA limitless.

US reap sows. really wish true, reality EU (and so-called Western world) bows US. Especially since they‚Äôre back high HP low Downforce package. earlier studies Scotland Israel already show this? generally agree sentiment.

The original EU strategy purchasing stupid seemed somewhat driven ideology politics actual pragmatism really practical long term budgetary considerations.... even safety matter. 

The lockdowns cost Germany alone billions day, EU gained absolutely extra safety spending months negotiating liability Biontech/Pfizer &amp; Moderna ... letting Astrazeneca pay much less liability know turned out.

I would hesitant draw conclusion herd immunity behaviors haven‚Äôt returned normal.

Also herd immunity single one size fits number. depends virulent virus also behaviors population density. would require lot higher percentage people vaccinated Manhattan achieve herd immunity town 300 people rural America. Good you. People need start normalizing wearing masks outside.  things seemed pretty obvious even back Feb there's difference looks like X going record expecting preparing X. People (media eapecially, here) jumping declare pandemic Jan/Feb, really yet. There's harm rushing go record stuff like early. Accuracy information important, even directions say anything masks working? data shows cloth paper masks make impact cut transmission small amount, important control epidemic. 

The issue many people think masking cloth/paper masks foolproof everyone would wear masks pandemic would over, isn‚Äôt true. 

I agree important tool, cdc government could done lot recommending producing high quality masks would made difference. Trump human being...

Anecdotally, Taiwan practically measure except mask wearing within country time. However, local transmissions able spread out, despite numerous cases asymptomatic patients running around (they're found family members showed symptoms diagnosed). many logical explanations Taiwan able keep lid except universal mask wearing.

God knows, can‚Äôt tell many times I‚Äôve asked there‚Äôs earlier sunset event, many times day them. I'll look these, thanks! Education probably another difference, evolution science taught standard UK, whilst US always case. Actually they've decades, mostly prevent kids jumping leaning window. significant pain whole arm 36 hours that‚Äôs all. It‚Äôs understanding side effects mild first dose Pfizer. fully intend get second dose, scheduled 3 weeks. think stimulus checks could reason well. major problem Curevac also need import chemicals mostly need rely US US blocking exports kinda stuff What?? Haven‚Äôt known virus airborne beginning? January 2020, one could possibly imagine bad Covid would be. 

I remember seeing people claim R value 6 late January understand saying. people given 6x's std dose pfizer ok. kids vaccinated younger people seem getting more. don‚Äôt want even chance could bring home. Overly cautious fine way us. Agree not. It‚Äôs going stop me. shot rest world, mask me. checked nearly 70 million now, enough fully vaccinate remaining canadians.  Florida's death curve look like anyone else's.

Citation needed vaccination rate. Around 1% population per day. 


Canada 38 million people. 
The US around 328 million people. Yes. height cold got 2nd shot. next day wasn‚Äôt fun cold actually went away way quicker usually would. attribute immune system high alert vax.

Edit: word already lots N95s regularly get really bad wildfire smoke. remember one wearing mask going grocery store SO, would contactlessly sanitize hands wallet parking lot got out, back early March. May well looks like demand dropping significantly (outside 18 age group- due approved yet) Correct. lost maybe 560k point unclear effective vaccine rollout be. 

We still averaging 700 deaths every day considering CDCs job CONTROL DISEASE think it‚Äôs fair leadership err side caution rather bow political pressure lie severity pandemic (redford trump admin). get participate safely society enough people get vaccinated. 45% isn‚Äôt going cut need incentivize people get it. see reason continue using vaccine passports we‚Äôve got enough people vaccinated reach herd immunity it‚Äôs tool get us need go. Look Israel want see successful example vaccine passports. autoimmune diseases triggered vaccination well? Florida restrictions like 6 months par California harshest. know state I'd rather living in.   respect passion commitment getting people stopping spread misinformation, agree. suppose would counter argue slightly open compassionate people, regardless experiences are. win lot hearts minds, believe long run increase participation help suppress misinformation.

The vaccine safe. safer now, science. good one. totally agree you! don‚Äôt mention data minimize, someone public health degree knowledge base properly understands terminology recognizing poorly CDC handled communication throughout whole thing. Unfortunately lack understanding leads people falling comparison trap pointlessly. believe different communication could helped. ultimately, US mentality often breeds selfish behavior lack care others. care would found reason part sadly. quite likely situation occur. However something like N440K higher immunity escape god forbid something even worse, alternative. next months Asia going determine next couple years rest us. JnJ shot chills/sweats night. Woke body aches headache, slowly went away night. Also woke extremely thirsty.    bad form ask barber vaccinated?

I'd really like know sit chair, I'm honestly conflict averse, especially people service industries. people care anyone else anyway. Well, choose to, depend us get safe. would fucking hope otherwise wearing fucking mask. far know, examples, well developed countries handled covid well islands. US fucked up, countries. point give fuck laws anyway, probably worrying law's best use time anyway. happy one 400k yesterday!! Vaccine hunters tweet 6.45 spare vaccines, lining 7.30, vaccinated 9.30! Great Friday eveningüòÄüôè certain officials threw different herd immunity percentages people think made absolutely progress reach number.

When Israel 56% vaccinated basically declared victory also tracked 15% people recovered considered immune. know number recovered US would different that. Israel, little overlap groups people recovered vaccinated last. US. even overlap US easily get 60-70% immunity. it‚Äôs fucking may LOL would apply people going back home FL doesnt require makes going easier lol  Fragile ass. Quite true, names used way.

I see article article ""COVID virus"" hardly ever references SARS2 closely related SARS1 precautions could've taken earlier &amp; learned valuable lessons without much fretting about, ""Oh *novel* virus"". Let's compare covid flu. flu. Agreed. lot problems country big money immense power. need reigned in.


On lockdowns US, let's pretend kind lockdowns anywhere ever going enough. lot people still go work. Lots stores still open, even though essential. State borders never closed down, people could still move around worse hit areas others..


If want example real successful lockdown, look Australia. Painful, fucking worked. blocked state borders locked affected areas. strict well. US, even California, never enough ultimately prolonged problem. Wrong. get ticketed producing license, also provide proof licensed court date ticket recinded.

Furthermore pulled three years. I'm worried that.  thinking.

The people government surveillance happy person like. Ridiculous. vaccinated, you‚Äôre incredibly safe. risk serious health complication COVID vaccinated person far lower million risks taken day day ‚Äúlike driving work, example‚Äù

Burdening vaccinated accommodate unvaccinated dumb imo way make sure discourage future vaccine adoption opportunity cost. still suggesting given profit 2.5 billion risk took. 

pfizer slightly tweak formulas bypass generic drug status. make head?

the risk certainly scary. mRNA vaccine never brought market before. failure would brought trillion dollar industry? who? saying things substance. 

this accomplished publicly owned pharma company. didn't. again, saying things substance. Iceland, wonder why... still imminent real threat, decided comes different group people now.

And next year, parameters expand include people house party un-vaccinated friends... lot people quarantine exposure symptoms. Like friend mine flew back India vaccinated symptoms quarantining 2 weeks. said, therapist vaccinated would worry. Almost good telling us vaccinated people allowed outside without mask away people.  *is* America. amount fellow citizens deaths make remorseful. ain't getting pulled over, still drive. particularly smart thing like lose ability drive without want. said airborne time too. CDC decided ignore Airborne droplets

Everyone know operating assumption breath air air contagion it...  Better late never suppose Math difficult media people want score political points dunking Florida. 

When vaccines protect older people, number older people hospital goes down, makes proportion younger people higher less old people hospital. 

Not mention hospitals space (because vaccines work) going admit people wouldn‚Äôt admitted times stress. 

So middle school math hard reporters, reaction apparently create headlines without mentioning actual numbers looking proportions. strategic mind.  . Poor government regulations enforcement . get vaccine today? Tomorrow? area prevents getting sooner? delay? sorry situation. Also, mask primarily prevent spreading much catching it? Good luck!  US 33% population vaccinated demand going down. Right incentive get vaccinated benefits vaccine, small benefits certain franchises like Krispy Kreme give out. people refuse vaccine likely also people go stores places without masks on, cannot used persuade them. Next stimulus check people vaccinated would increase vaccinations. Walk vaccines would also help too. Notice lot annoys much days, like everyone trying make money putting news behind paywall days. much spend insight Yes, let‚Äôs bend backwards protect the... checks notes... feelings morons. That‚Äôs shocking thought lot idiocy poor mathematical scientific literacy‚Ä¶. fuck engineer fall crap? ""Masks, social distancing, Mr. Clean risk... christ, what's next Covid!!?"" India counterpoint, different cautionary tale. Early lockdown would effective US. mean dont continue managing pandemic lockdown over. See Australia things realistically go decent response. UK 51 days ahead us terms doses administered per capita. highly unlikely happen unless vaccination rate drops cliff boards one Elons rocketships. yet opened indoor dining NH June last year. KEPT open winter. people wonder don‚Äôt want work service jobs anymore.... opposite reaction, want stay far Florida possible. Ok. then, give back now, please? reason articles like get upvotes people hate Florida governor Republican. plenty states much worse. Considering Florida's senior population spring break surge College students, DeSantis done amazing job. Don‚Äôt worry, eventually catch gain immunity hard way. point, everyone wants vaccine probably already received it. American here. everyone scrambling üßª, got bidet. Best decision ever! interesting. I'll let 22 year old daughter twice know true anomoly! ‚ÄúThen, bank *voluntarily gives us money every Friday*. It‚Äôs diabolical.‚Äù Winter coming... later Oh agree. 580k+ lives millions jobs lost later, still radical? 8 weeks real lockdown effective methods isolate hot areas blocking borders would kept us mostly free virus, allowed economy survive. Maybe need reevaluate thinking diseases public health? please calling jab news. vaccine, news companies cool trendy using dumb term hospitalized &amp; surviving exactly great either. 

There's financial impact paying care, economic impact people work force, human impact long term disability damaged lungs &amp; long term effects.

Why keen ignore casualties manage survive? Outside cities people generally wearing masks. exceptions generally mask mandates low participation rates rural areas.

If thread Florida know state talking about. funny rural America similar many states. agree QR code  real story people fear DeSantis run president trying kneecap happens. 

Though fair, people trying kneecap Newsom future run trying (and probably failing) recall him. 

So story politics. Well ok also oxford/AZ vaccine produced, cost, loads developing countries world IP offered directly partner producers. elderly relatives Colombia mostly vaccinated AZ vaccine (apart Chinese vaccine) produced Mexico Argentina. 

The U.K. manufacturing capacity make meaningful contribution world vaccine supplies. majority EU countries. important note CDC update SARS-COV-2 still **Not Airborne virus**. Particulates linger air, mean airborne virus. big difference true airborne virus drifting particulates. speak American, English. /s According Joe Rogan everything Florida fine. No, problem getting vaccines first half 2021, later problem. point cutting deals AZ proved unreliable ... unlike Pfizer. price vaccine never top issue EU, cost pandemic orders magnitude higher.

The attraction AZ ethical matter principle, AZ turned bad management. blew it. think fair assume Curevac, Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech use less chemicals, considering technology. Possibly crossover J&amp;J AZ know enough know need. 
 
Going production first advantage able set contracts, meaning Pfizer likely locked supply chemicals within Europe, leaving little Curevac unless secure contracts suppliers (f ex US). 
 
Had Curevac managed deliver months earlier they'd far better position supplies. 
 
Otherwise agree Sanofi likely good call time. situation AZ/UK US refusing exports shows value supporting companies. able practicing personal protection immune compromised person always ability choose. I‚Äôm questioning whether secretly stopped significantly reduced usage Az. suspicion have. didn‚Äôt want use middle man. agreement Serum Institute India directly, turned around mandated middle man paid , involvement deal  Protect Patrick Stewart costs. CDC saying now? M95 masks high demand reserved hospitals whole two classes citizens BS. people choosing vaccinated...

imagine US handed $100k everyone. imagine opportunity would provide. imagine group people say want 100k. people second class citizens. willfully denying make things better them.  well *then* was, agree there. Though 2022 see Spring Training option go living Canada. entirely true EU shouldn‚Äôt dictate what‚Äôs best developing countries. developing countries dictate what‚Äôs best them. want purchase mRNA vaccines it.

But comment around developing countries already procured certain amount Pfizer vaccines still waiting arrive richer countries hogging pay wrong levels.

My point hope deal result developing countries pushed back wait even longer Pfizer vaccines richer country jumps queue pay more. I‚Äôm saying that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening it‚Äôs public fact richer countries hogging vaccine supplies got $$$. Oooo see evidence? Im 30 1 shot family party stressing right üòÖ idea passports local activities isnt logical either. Drive outside major city sometimes. I'm 'purple' county Florida gone red last 4 years.

Most people masking perhaps couple larger chain stores.

I went Winn-Dixie Covid shot. people wearing masks employees. got heckled getting shot heckled wearing mask half hour there. little downtown, easily HALF businesses anti-mask serve wearing one. work kitchen. fucking feel you. many? far surpasses population Europe. that's even counting doses already hand Aging narratives became negative pandemic worsened across 20 countries. Globally, scores trending neutral Oct‚Äô19 Feb‚Äô20, plummeted Mar‚Äô20, reflecting COVID-19‚Äôs severity. Pre-pandemic (Oct‚Äô19), UK evidenced negative aging narratives; peak-pandemic (May‚Äô20), South Africa took dubious honor. Across 8-month period, Philippines experienced steepest trend towards negativity aging narratives. Ageism, pandemic, ironically, predicted COVID-19‚Äôs incidence mortality rates, cultural variables: Individualism, Masculinity, Uncertainty Avoidance, Long-term Orientation.

the suggest extensive, culturally sensitive awareness campaign. I‚Äôm
not seeing countries devoting resources time soon unfortunately. I'll tell likely go US.

There dozens different passports made dozens different companies trying get sweet data, it'll complicated businesses larger venues say fuck whole idea. Meanwhile states outright banning them, already going follow, people unwilling use anyway.

Couple fact courts low key overriding emergency health measures emergency health measures local levels likely fight taken Supreme Court vaccine passports almost definitely end 6-3 decision saying can't enforce them.

And plus population that's tired covid 2022 election coming up.

Yeah going big thing here. want read source repeating claims want substantiate claims reputable sources?

Or want assume think undeniably correct disregard evidence contrary?

Any fine; let know don‚Äôt waste time. It‚Äôs ok sorry snarky human challenge trials, larger injection gap, national medical infrastructure.

UK thinks outside box little. 

I like it.  now, 100% submission never demanded vaccination. Therefore, case recorded human history, including past pandemics much higher fatality ratios. Yes, recent news shown low enough consider herd immunity status, doctors cleared people masks even vaccination. Effect severity huge, transmission yet cleared dude. lot number, location date apply every person got shot date location, using vial box lot number it. friends go together shots, numbers identical you. see you‚Äôre trying make public health issue political one, that‚Äôs pretty stupid you. shouldve led. Also far better start people car. France GP visit 25 euros. vaccine well worth price. think anyone complaining private companies earning money pandemic full shit. I'm British find offputting dumb too, call vaccination, injection dose whatever. likely temporary measure ensure superspreader events things open fully. People staff deserve feel safe environment. Nice see Adam Driver enjoying really ought know better. India good digital vaccine certification system linked identity cards. vaccine :/ Advocating celebrating someone's death illness results ban. Humans pretty adaptable resilient. Even done absolutely nothing covid wouldn‚Äôt threatened survival species. might let collapse western civilization humanity would survive that. Nice reply , covered points also Murphy required nursing homes house COVID-positive patients. Northeast well great vaccination rates, NY NJ leaders great job infecting killing seniors last year. CDC tracks breakthrough infections, far reported 600 hospitalizations 100 Covid deaths among vaccinated, 95 million vaccinated people. would stand reason vast majority people died vaccinated. However, deaths could occured long time ago, reporting lag long 60 days according 
The Swedes disagrees assessment. 

""Sweden‚Äôs top epidemiologist admitted strategy fight Covid-19 resulted many deaths, persuading country avoid strict Sweedes different American's. Even without lock take social distancing &amp; masks seriously, apposed vocal minority rebelling simple protections.  bet decade virologists acknowledge covid virus indeed airborne, needs large viral load infect ppl, least original strain. Indian mutation may fact much contagious.That's infecting households who're isolating &amp; hunkering separate apartments, central AC system. hope too. Second day 90+ cases per day, new secondary cluster discovered everyday 4-5 major hospitals lockdown. Everyone really nervous atm. People saying since late 1980s. long time, looked like world would dodge bullet densely populated SE Asia. Looks like delayed. absolutely sure is, trying flippant. sorry troubles. problem enough testing though, can't see problem really looks like. go fix it, can't tell getting better not. 

I heard issues government allowing needed supplies past airport. heard problems politically(as always around world), think supplies like oxygen, oxygen generators needed medical supplies greatly needed now. Specifically though, disease mitigation needed. People need Isolate sick. People recent prolonged contact need Quarantine stop chain transmission sick. many things, testing right there, know sick not. Otherwise India start Stay Home orders, people listen that. course need vaccines.

It much complicated, wish typing alone would help, specifically, thread 50% people testing positive story headline. podcast referencing Week Virology, good thorough long time running show given great amounts good information along way pandemic, would highly recommend listen. anywhere, forward good information find people know trouble. 1 year late.  far, it‚Äôs states actually bought it. Nothing happened Germany side. EMA process forever far failed provide sufficient data. Got vaxx appt. 2 weeks now. 31 male TO. I'm saying AZ J&amp;J would better. mRNA ones however better. J&amp;J clearly enough 1 dose that's selling point. Also Chile uses Sinovac, UAE Sinopharm, there's guarantee Sinopharm good Sinovac. I'd look Chile's depth data numbers 67% symptomatic disease 80% death, low considering former number. Like said can't get anything else, sure get something. I'm yet convinced vaccines adequately control things without public health measures. Let know Sinovac Sinopharm country looks like Israel. I've waiting. Also check Bahrain's lovely case rate right now, majority Sinopharm country. Argument finished. Absolutely reason release proper trial data, begs question they're trying hide. knew start (in China). people stressed, taking care dead important counting I'm concerned balls.  Yes far I‚Äôve read anywhere. many people save? 

We know accuracy, years. Quick answers hard questions usually wrong. need estimate also cost lives. I‚Äôve people life take lives lockdown

I'm sorry hear that. isolation &amp; economic impact hard us one way another. little doubt, death's caused lock dwarfed saved lock down. Especially early idea treat disease. said, personally, reality may make feel better loss &amp; lose jobs businesses homes

This, again, failure government. one party refusing pass aid programs would help avoid scenarios. corrupt administration use funds intended keep things happening piggy bank &amp; cronies. countries, countries similer ours, weathered financial impacts lock downs much better did... part, compliance &amp; better coordination. Here, states going hard lock &amp; neighboring states pretending nothing happening. made everything worse &amp; actually extended need lock downs. Let‚Äôs see 1 data point actually anything

Several data points refer following article. acknowledge &amp; refute arguments. serious illness death matters though? so, number used? 50.7% repeated vaccine half effective media? going happen Nepal curropted govt middle men seek commision. exact thing happened baccine Yep, Brazil another country run populist leader. 

Such populist leaders rather waste energy gaslighting censoring opposition actually damn useful thing. 

In case Turkey, it‚Äôs bit worse. Erdogan actually rather smart, like really smart. chooses knowing well consequences alternatives. 

It‚Äôs corruption purest. pass certain threshold longer resort corruption goals, corruption becomes goal. can't make probably neighbouring developing country start producing cheaply? many countries start manufacturing it, drives price whole. 

Also maybe single corporate stop bullying countries then? Canada currently capability manufacture enough vaccines think, import them. 
The rate vaccination seems par country (Spain) EU countries adjusted total population. guys late start. going thumbs answer question? Hey geniuses! Give solution problem instead complaining! I'd willing risk getting COVID-19 go Darlington, tbh. 1.) relying old information, 2.) even interpreting information correctly. early days vaccine, know sure prevented spread time study that. one saying ""It prevent spread."" saying ""We know yet prevents spread."" Research actually happening suggests exactly that. say BLM protests last summer? guess no. Thanks response. genuinely curious since social contract days. Oh agree actually infected like far highly confirmed cases. However wording used. article literally said.

"" meaning rate infection among untested population may higher. ""

Which bullshit, Rate Infection among untested absolutely higher. Neither us know book he's speaking jump conclusion.

I mean, c'mon man, saying ""You're going gain great insight first 20 pages"" without even knowing book? better. certainly say watch list. said FBI watching people buying specific books, good them. 

My judgement guy purely based book reading. factors including clothing, mannerisms, accessories, etc. 

The fact matter human, make judgements every human meet. you. pretend otherwise patronize please. Yes, aerosols quality mask becomes much important. 

A cloth mask paper mask (which vast majority people wear) going block droplets, much less effective stopping aerosols since get gaps larger holes lower quality masks, recommendations masking made assumption droplet transmission many studies you‚Äôve referenced look droplets. Suraj vaidya - also consulate Philippines, business magnate
His wife &amp; Vijaya Duggard. Another business magnete  it‚Äôs it‚Äôs fucking fact Yeah sorry political agenda???

/s US exporting vaccines, reducing number places get vaccine US terrible idea. Send sites less supply don‚Äôt need it? Sure. we‚Äôve reached point need vaccines many venues possible reach people. means walk-ins (no booking system) well. AP worldwide, everything catered America. good.
We need vaccine passports encourage people. US vaccinating 3.27 Million day.**

So little less US late March mid-April peak. last time US hit 3.3 million May 1. Vaccines cut even asymptomatic infections. infections, spread. That‚Äôs whole damn point herd immunity. Let‚Äôs stop spreading misinformation, K?   really hate calling vaccine ""jab"". feel like carries negative connotations. probably though. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

That science referring. 

You provide list claims perceive failures think Science respect pandemic. 

Unfortunately, us taught well Science school. sure hell wasn't. get inaccurate, inadequate, incomplete idea. figure last 10 years, well middle age.

Science whole system several things. science justifies 6 feet social distancing, despite arbitrary number, fact COVID spread effectively several times length?

Wait. know travels several times distance?

...From recent scientific experiments paper(s) challenged earlier hypotheses, that's how.

Conducting research test existing hypothesis crucial part Science.

We must always able challenge update understanding. 

Rigid thinking dogma antithetical learning.

I remember paper early pandemic attempting test spread virus inside bus. kind sketchy remember hearing time. papers read looked spread apartment proposed transmission plumbing, fecal matter, etc. saw day new paper shows virus spreads much, much farther indoors.

Maybe looks otherwise Science work.

We know Jan, 2020, hypotheses tested accuracy.

What else do, guess hope? think help us learn virus (or anything else) works. least, nowhere near reliably ‚Äúscience‚Äù taking here. science justified lockdowns

The Science basic epidemiology, virology, biology, chemistry, physics, probably many areas know name can't think of.

We know ways viruses spread, know viruses operate infect, replicate, understand viruses molecular level, sequenced tens thousands virus samples. 

The knowledge control epidemics built colossal mountain research numerous areas.

With new research specific virus, idea early might spread, well enough know letting people congregate closely would spread happened Wuhan, like cold flu. decent idea even Jan likely outcomes based sex age. knew hospitals would able handle load sick people.

We knew keeping people congregating would do: reduce number hospitalizations per day deaths per day. there's ocean data confirm this. see numbers rise lockdowns lifted. see fall place.

Out time gotta go. Idk aware but, posts ""flair"" them. tells country article about. yes, American study American organization United States. really hard believe? spread misinformation. Yeah I‚Äôm saying horribly may bit hyperbole. Evidence measures stopped flu, means lot slow Covid. think we, developed world, far better horrible. consider fast got vaccine there, think honest fair ourselves. pretty damn impressive thing. covid vaccines, provide piece paper nothing name it. nothing look against.

Huh? Mine kind vaccine lot number date got shot. places recording card? However, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York rapid decline Florida mostly flat.

The article specifically says Florida declined 10% last two weeks. That's flat. fear mongering vague article zero contextual statistics end? anyone know vaccine working well vs Indian variant? (Moderna/Pfizer) yea miscommunications happen things text-only bro fuck think requirement vaccinated things like concerts bars would fine purely recreational. aside recreational activities doesn‚Äôt seem appropriate.

People don‚Äôt like acknowledging big picture scary offspring. epidemics pandemics like gremlins waiting turn nasty, expensive, life-altering. Well since vaccines per-capita expense, would argue GDP per capita serves fine analyzing country afford buy vaccines population. Well since vaccines per-capita expense, would argue GDP per capita serves fine analyzing country afford buy vaccines population.  Ah sorry - went completely head! doctors cleared people masks even vaccination

More political move one based science. Yeah. pandemic greatly accelerates efficacy trials. freakanomics podcast head Moderna last year start pandemic. explaining phase 3 trials longest phases, due safety checks, due long takes placebo group get enough infections demonstrate vaccine effectiveness. said would greatly accelerated due pandemic level spread. CDC hasn‚Äôt really lived reputation one forever sorry.  can‚Äôt count many times used case study talking friends family 1) it‚Äôs definitely airborne move vents reach people enclosed space, 2) masks work. Yes, never concerned kids getting Covid, spreading it. Plus, 12-15 supposed approved shortly US.

I asking full-grown adults can‚Äôt get it. medical condition people prevent getting it? downvoted lol funny. US currently exporting doses Mexico. Well I'm fully vaccinated still I'm still scared. ( got Sinopham VAC)"
