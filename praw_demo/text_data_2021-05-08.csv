0,2021-05-08,"  I've heard India problem place they're giving vaccines hospitals hospitals currently overrun covid patients. true? I've heard one goes pharmacies get vaccines mass vaccination sites exist. Yeah I'm guessing month two they'll either send code app they'll tell go CVS pharmacy get code. hard tell correct dosing is, source 'ineffective' done way. think one things scientists say ""we know prevents infection yet"" people take mean EVEN PREVENT INFECTION! told doctor vaccination center skip alcohol beer included two days getting shot. really made point stress me. Makes wonder give impression party girl who'd head get drunk right getting jab.   china US? OK 19% say definitely get it, that's basically adult population. instant, majority eventually get vaccinated That's exactly true. safe sure, definitely completely safe. Especially also close contact someone cannot get vaccine.

And one people cannot get vaccine medical reasons? guess view people die anti-vaxxers party, then. EU exported ~200 million vaccine doses. really comparable unless obtuse. already have. Thank you! Well, again, antibody half-life 1 year less SARS-2003, SARS-2019 study that's done date. *is* concern mild infections might give many antibodies thus lasting sterilizing immunity.

Protection complete. Controlled studies shown 80-95% protection infection reinfection, means reinfection would extremely common sufficient exposures. seem trend common different strains though, little strange. new strains seen simply contagious therefore outcompete point SARS-CoV-2 changing active selection pressure evade immune systems. 

But objectively yet happened. Israel instance difference distribution lineages among vaccinated unvaccinated, lineages dying ~65% vaccination levels.   That's disgusting. considering moving US work big tech firm pandemic ended honestly sort response y'all gonna decades. think I'll set sights EU instead something. Alright. research widely available, I’m personal bidding.  Thank weighing in, couldn’t tell talking about. Hey too!! I’m writing naps overall I’m good. Hope you’re feeling well :) don’t know, haven’t seen it. Don’t know many vaccines had, immune hx is, anything else. cases happen still vaccinated people, article studies go that. That’s herd immunity help transmission goes general   True, complaining people doesn’t solve anything rarely see typos AP I'm surprised, reading wrong Shows staunch principles anti-vaxers are. “I’m going let Bill Gates microchip me...unless get free beer it.”  keep saying somebody doesn’t care enough go get vaccine, recommendation CDC Biden Fauci isn’t going changes mind, something like money makes say hey, don’t really want vaccine, dammit I’ll beer.

Take notes hope people smart enough get first dose even smarter enough get second dose. Yeah, couldnt care less ""place"" we're able meet beat targets, are, fun bring placing people convinced things going badly despite us one top countries world this. Didn’t NBA player get Covid despite fully vaxxed? Congrats getting vaccinated! :) got stab yesterday solely EU said they’ll take summer vaccinated...

I literally incentive get stabbed...my state NY made quite clear near going back normal...and given incentive get vaccinated...I’ve actually seen state proposals force claim haven’t stabbed better experiences... CBV4 enterovirus coxsackievirus type B4 (CVB4) another virus observed induce diabetes specifically changes / damages pancreatic cells.  

In people history prediabetic indications, Covid produces dangerously high spikes blood sugar - suggests also involvement pancreas. 

Isn’t worn body overactive immune response?

Researchers suggest since receptor SARS-CoV-2 expressed endocrine pancreas, could operate lead diabetes similar way CVB4 does, independently immune reactions. I'll know back normal go Costco giving free samples. miss last July ten cases day. I’m lucky wife vaccinated, despair rest country. think ordeal unleashed whole slew mental health problems folks haven’t Covid all. people worry pandemic winds down. Excellent, fewer people less trouble voting. pesky poor die can’t afford medical care.
That thinks problem. “problems” taken care virus Consent vaccination contingent state law, varies. state in? states require consent legal guardian (which would qualify unless court deemed legal guardian) states, Idaho, necessarily require it. Get vaccine want vaccine second agree that.

Honestly, opt vaccine valid medical reason, *deserve* shut society. choice affects *everyone* come contact potentially deadly way, *not* matter personal privacy.

I deserve know risk I'm exposed consent it. want vaccine, that's fine, right put people risk without consent. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

My idea dystopia always one people self-concerned minor inconveniences like wearing mask carrying piece ID literally believe deserve right harm others spreading virus them, government nothing protect vulnerable.

A year later that's still opinion. Moreover, vaccine passports become mandatory many places giving business. Harmful at-risk populations can't get vaccine medical reasons.

I'm thinking super variants cause rising cases developing countries strict lockdowns. think looking measles-level contagion rate. CDC admitting virus remains contagious air, aerosols one main ways transmission. also think that's several epidemiologists believe world get control 2024 later. developing countries continue spit variants countries relax restrictions, reverse happen, put us vicious cycle years since countries lock borders completely. global are, I'm sure end. alcoholic ( former 15 months sober ) we’re dumb shit lol long non-electronic alternative issue.

But we’ll see goes. US hitting antivax wall pretty hard right now. Yup, nationalistic angle exactly I'm worried about; approval could well coerced dear leader desperately needs something save image. Yea that’s fair enough hahaha even need next appointment. fiance forgot gave new one  It’s low intelligence. People don’t trust it. Source?

They done away masks public major mistake.
I hate wearing mask last outbreak Perth glad people wearing masks.  Google maskne drugstore pull article affordable products (drugstore cleansers, treatment products etc)! vaccines use? Israel use? Free beer! Tomorrow. Several actually proposed that. (John Delaney first article, Steve Stivers R second article)
 Based ratio infections vaccinated unvaccinated (1:4) vaccine efficacy around 84%. may worst vaccines would still end pandemic month enough doses. Casting doubt extremely counter productive.

Seychelles 35,000 unvaccinated people fully open borders. really simple.  go goals studying Sydney got shots saw place nearby offering pizza &amp; beer free got shot site. Pretty brilliant IMO. mean anything. 35% population unvaccinated keep flying sick tourists infect them. vaccinated population getting sick.  Wish state stuff like :(

The downside place everyone good little compliant goody two shoes. Doses Mimosas  Alcohol weakens immune system Europe add fatalities countries. Still, export bans put place. EU exported much put peoples’ arms. That’s still ~57% total population, first dose. shooting 70%+ population fully immune, requires people second doses... Today 2 weeks since 2nd shot. feels really good point. Yep. people always selfish extent, last fourteen months showed far ""some extent"" is. Seeing many people put convenience people's *lives* irreversibly damaged faith humanity. idea: Another round stimulus, tied whether someone gets full immunization (2 shots Moderna/Pfizer, 1 shot J&amp;J). People need drink getting vaccinated probably kind stop one beer . not. Stop giving breweries bad name. wouldn’t “they” thing, would vary location haha....that said, love even offered all! curious think someone shouldn’t? can’t mandate people stay home due 15% 16 population potentially exposed something considered non-lethal problem. It’s *only* you… it’s could pass to… could inadvertently hurt. Fucking selfish pricks. many terrible things disease explain people care others whole level 🤯🤯🤯 like Thanks man, I’m good .

I saying back excuse reason drink, even wasn’t good idea.  dad got extra day vacation getting his. knew least two people work got extra day off. maybe use inferior vaccine. even chinese officials said confident.   EU allowing companies export terms agreed, instead blocking it. EU making money corporate tax. That’s article says. vaccinations Israel shrink obviously- old habits hard break. It’s hard living fear others seeing damage pandemic caused going back normal way living. expect people little reluctant see people living normally follow suit realize things improving  Dear USA, worried ""vaccine diplomacy"", send vaccines world shut it. Seychelles, Israel. definitely frustrating, even bizarre gym fresh air would feel great even without pandemic. Would also get rid body odor.

It'd tough thing mandate, encouraged businesses early on. Nobody (in USA) going implement enforce this, entire point moot. Next. Tell Boston man. vaccinated city opening 8/22. Vaccination rates opening dates negatively correlated anything. already hit 70% target last week. Sbux giving two hours pay per shot Sounds like need beer n' brats vaccination centers.

Biden totally jump this. pass grilling wisdom increasing vaccination rates. feel like Biden knows work grill. article:

Seychelles reported nearly 7,000 Covid-19 cases since start pandemic it’s big deal country population less 100,000. Earlier week, archipelago announced new measures, including shutting schools cancelling sporting activities, two weeks curb infection. Peggy Vidot, Seychelles’ health minister, told press conference Covid-19 situation country critical right despite “exceptional efforts”.

Experts watching situation Seychelles closely says effectiveness vaccines. According Washington Post report, surge new cases may confirm Covid-19 vaccines used country “have comparatively low effectiveness.” Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow global health Council Foreign Relations, told Post situation Seychelles making critical case “consider effectiveness vaccines range reach meet herd immunity.” Please, get realistic view go, going massively, massively, disappointed.

Mainly ever law requiring this, clearly political started position everyone plan put law.

So...no, see happening. Thankfully NZed presume USA handling extremely well

UK government also taking similarly proactive approach? poorly informed. SII capacity make 1 billion doses year last year. companies well. funds directed towards increasing SII's production capabilities, neither happened Bharat Biotech till Mid april.

One second, please.

""The youth"" told stay home, save grandma, protect hospitals overrun, flatten curve on. lost jobs, endure remote classes, stay home care children, put plans lives hold virus disproportionately kills elderly, mostly spares them.

And did. Due virus enduring lockdowns, lost opportunities, businesses, jobs many cases, plans financial security. could even say 2020/2021 might impact youth way 2008/2009 did, worse.

Throughout time, told point reduce number cases, limit deaths minimum save many lives possible. Every time uptick number cases, blamed (mostly) young people flaunting rules. Let's kid - curfews measures targeted elderly, targeted youth meet friends, go gym, gather on. 

Then, got vaccines told wait line protect elderly vulnerable first. pretty universal across Europe.

And now, elderly vulnerable getting vaccinated, get enjoy freedom (even though virus objectively dangerous them) youth still going endure lockdowns impact knows long - even though, again, virus big risk them.

“Companies risk losing women leadership … unwinding years painstaking progress toward gender diversity.” possible women. It’s possible anyone doesn’t mean got flawed dose. Thankfully, one benefits vaccine even get Covid, severity infection greatly reduced. sober text article match sensationalist headline (again).

Don't know coronavirus limited potential mutate meaningful way? vaccines work hospitalization death. COVID-19 never going away. Sure is. sell something save lives (say, water house fire), act reliance (waiting water said coming), fail deliver, people die (the house burns down). Sure, large gatherings, people need choose one. Instead, insist neither. government signed stupid contract made agreement honor it. honor contract force company give away stuff free frankly stealing. stuff cause legal Co tract says so.

 like abuse power come pandemic. may seem like good idea opening gates lead abuses end someone corrupt leader again. Trump, id say seems really high possibility.

Add this, drug companies point raw materials weak link would exacerbate problem seems highly valid me. seem like effective move regardless whether want screw drug companies. reference to? Threes problems sure hasn’t collapsed. close  get ridiculous idea anecdotes bear relevance scientific data? fully vaccinated, go.   arm canada spending day trying track vaccines. Wild times. Sources this? haven’t seen reports variants making vaccines obsolete, even future ones. Plus booster shots coming take care variants.

I don’t think it’s good dose reality, think overly negative. exactly I'm looking tickets AMC right :) lot people theater? agree. many dont pay attention news that. News makes seem otherwise... arent many motives like said something makes joke light hearted thats good thing. Kind insulting make whole ass article something people think easily Self diagnosable completely valid approach opt vaccinate citizens first. Especially situation bad US. criticize that.

But situation US relaxed quite time export bans still place. affect vaccines itself, way, also raw materials necessary production therefore directly harming global production efforts. someone actually experience HEAVILY daily basis, whole article garbage. I'm thinking going AMC see movie week. San Francisco fully vaccinated (2 weeks second dose) - think safe go? maybe better question is, think risk getting COVID-19 theater SF? drink beer pandemic. probably ever. gamble health worth sometimes. always anxiety. become hypovolemic dehydrated hand you’re petite.

Secondary infection post covid, it’s generally happening patients autoimmune disease, still scary. *salutes* Than* hurry, NZ. supply vaccines. made purchase deals early multiple vaccine makers hedge bets. buy bulk huge price US willing pay manufacturers us much lower list. 

Australia also put lot faith AZ vaccine, making deal manufacture it, blood clots abandon it, make late deal Pfizer arriving Q4, they've got choice wait. Yes.  think point everyone would rather work home, lol. MEGA VARIANT distortions data maximum India, especially RSS/BJP ruled states! even look outside events had?

I wonder made us pay vaccine sites offered cheaper, organized “vaccine clearance” days, would work? think so. ""bump"" might better word here, think may right. Govt need anything. serum does.

SII probably largest vaccine manufacturer World, never produced vector vaccine mRNA vaccine before. licensing agreement Oxford vaccine allowed acquire adenovirus vector production technology.

One could argue that, combating pandemic, may better SII produce traditional deactivated vaccines (like Chinese), substantial track record doing. 

India's demand waiving vaccine IP also aims long-term goal acquiring Western technology rather short-term goal combating pandemic.  We're 50th country population density. addition, India, largest vaccine producer world, delayed development vaccines producing AZ (SII - largest vaccine producer world) J&amp;J (Bio E - another producer huge capacity) example. 2 companies projects delayed (at clinical development stage), one could argue deals Western companies lucrative profitable Indian companies. hand, Bharat biotech (who deals western manufacturers) brought finish line even trying develop vaccine US partnering small US company (it way around, Bharat licensed vaccine). 

So question is, SII Bio E dragging feet vaccines, like know make them, produced many vaccines past massive volumes data far covid vaccines quite good. get finishing clinical trials vaccines (instead starting phase 3 ""soon"", narrative months) could producing huge quantities already, vaccinating population. capacity accommodate licensed own, not? idea vaccine received?

India trying contain virus giving vaccine away countries build Prime Minister's image internationally. vaccines produced, unplanned manner political gains - meanwhile cluster community transmission ongoing, Central Government decided announce virus gone.

As today, India hardly vaccinated 1% population. Thousands die due lack planned Healthcare infrastructure, many politicians hoarding oxygen cylinders, concentrators, ventilators, ambulances (yup! Ambulances too). look like harder scale compared mRNA ones

Do mean harder produce larger quantities? Yeah, that's trying say.

They might ignore 12-15 vaccinations reason. get cleared within days?

Quite normal years see folks coming medical centers wear masks public transportation Dallas.  Real world breakthrough case data available now. Read it. It’s X-factor here.

Hope side effects stay mild end - good luck! Dodgy pfizer Malaysia too. Less thousand cases day month back, 5,000 yesterday. Unless you’re India maybe, chances testing positive take random test symptoms without knowingly exposed small even you’re vaccinated. Kinda pointless „research“ Remember “Texas Lt. Gov.

If small amount still piss poor argument lower numbers people getting vaccinated. get sides - would less protection vs variants, would mean ppl would getting covid twice say within 6 months. seen scientific literature. probably Caucasian likely Caucasus region either.

This corruption highest level. Pfizer shares must well today. agree comment delete one above. People lie. People lie even internet. People lie even social media attention karma involved. People like attention.

You see can't taken seriously? last count, average 9 states. rising 1 2 every couple days likely continue bit.

I'm happy we're well also sad many states plateauing early. 6G either already coming up. stay competitive lol It’s possible “live life” also taking precautions. think ""one two doses bad"" story ""severe side effects common"" stories anecdotal. Side effects higher vaccines (probably dosages higher, since lot trials pin perfect dose), far universal.

Both doses extreme dehydration (easily fixed) sore arm. one night bad sleep (athletic strap put recovery level comparable run half-marathon) each. second dose felt like total crap 48 hours days 9-11, idea related. Wow, maybe tell people vaccine prevents people getting COVID! now, thought got better 5G coverage. That’s got mine. /s  think title truly understands meaning ""give."" actually BioNTech vaccine invented [with help EU [pair Turkish role Chinese's Fosun Pharma Chinese market: ""development"" helped getting trials regulatory approval done [vaccine candidates created past mostly manufacturers distributors. reduce chance dying. Pretty simple folks thing better free beer free beer food  think research giving vaccine public...? approved children yet, probably want supply that. see waiting reason.  realize 2 months since Texas opened right?

Florida opened 7 months.

WAIT, WAIT IM TELLING WAIT.  stick right shoulder best bet immediately get shot, rotate shoulder around around 2 3 minutes. got sore arm first shot took advice friend nurse second shot barely felt second shot next day described above. home?  require schools private businesses require proof. healthy individual makes choice get vaccinated that’s choice follow consequences (good bad) actions.   Cambodia bad situation well, Laos. Vietnam also seeing spike cases. could pass law force check, like force check id selling alcohol young people. goal law could encourage vaccine adoption limit unvaccinated persons spreading covid. course individual bars little incentive require vaccines without legal pressure, like incentive prevent sale alcohol minors without legal pressure.
My personal take see rare covid becomes couple months. heading near zero, pass law. today, covid appears heading near zero US next several months. Today day second jab. can't imagine going today hangover well, woof! second dose sore arm fell asleep couple hours. It’s amazing folks get simple allergy, cold, cough, etc tend science consume medication. comes pandemic don’t believe science. mine noon, felt bit tired 'off' quickly 2hrs after. intense symptoms (feeling sore, headache, throat ache, shivers) started around bedtime, 11pm so. felt 90% back normal 10am next morning. Unfortunately miscalculated risk aversion. Theres always chance vaccinated likely kill send hospital. pointlessly irresponsible Tam mislead public fuel vaccine skepticism. fired. rats

Try different hyperbole. Referencing bubonic plague death rate treatment 30-90% death rate without treatment Covid (which death younger folks much higher older folks) silly.  Life pretty normal apart masks places US point. I’m florida first lab party yesterday fun elsewhere, businesses, venues events increasingly offering special access treats show evidence, flat-out requiring proof service. charged felonies including forgery government seal identity theft Pfizer, CVS CDC, district attorney's office said. 40 state attorneys general last month warned social media online shopping platforms crack sales blank fraudulently completed cards. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Sorry, graph Illinois whole US (on google's covid stats). Idk. seems like they're still useful despite difference effectiveness. may mean need population covered. Idk Seychelles, Bahrain, Maldives look like they're like Uruguay Chile, think still early stages vaccination campaign-- something like 30-40% coverage. 

Also mRNA vaccines harder use, cost more. Big problem middle, lower income countries. think could afford gamble billions early pre-orders like high income countries Jun 2020. Back then, stuff vaporware.

So far. Wait next year. Jimmy Kimmel recently said there's lot Americans who'd take day get free key chain. know people think climate related coronavirus

It's climate per se people/scientists/Doctors etc. say related Coronavirus. people change behavior/their interactions due climate. Northern Hemisphere Winter people huddle inside. rather spending time outside fosters spread infection. 

This change behavior driven climate/weather. Hope didn’t sound like either wings

No didn't. Im worried Eid celebrations havent even come final day, sign worse things come.

Sad true. Hydrabad looking next epicenter unfortunately care Canada. US nearly poverty/population density problem India. Hey buddy it’s republican! It’s anti government! 

Use brain! First shot works well J&amp;J. Depends mean. increase cases? Yep, coronaviruses highly seasonal. Enough cases cause widespread strain hospitals, unlikely. things bad US COVID current situation looks like things over. deaths per captia still twice Canada, according popular media terrible shape. you’d foolish underestimate much people love free beer. vaccinated private matter, violate bodily autonomy forcing anyone vaccinated. People simply go places. local businesses, think depend heavily much staff vaccinated. Like work staff fully vaccinated way state, I'd already feel comfortable without masks, think wearing mask 2 minutes sit table bar much anyway.  That's incorrect. depends argument made. nervous government corporations making group gets compared diseased vermin.  That's called slippery slope fallacy.  kids understood statistics, they’d pretty upset arent concept same.

Sometimes reward dumb lazy still better society. Seriously. 

Every time donate they’re like “no caffeine alcohol rest day.”

I’m like, “my body choice!!!” Ah, yes, unironic bribery. We're talking social security net. data breakdown ""breakthrough cases"" vaccine? Trump. Biden saved us. Even wiping equipment gym prevent covid, prevent staph infections fun speak experience. Horrifying wonder going open tourism soon. Think like wrapping cats pill sandwich meat trick taking it. Dude managed freaking impossible!

If situation might able convince mother two brain cells never came that. reason father fear, nowhere, surprised us since repeatedly hinted ""wouldn't smart"" get vaccinated (I used much offensive word). 

Again dude, kudos, hell them! 

I'm getting 2nd shot week! Sounds like something republican would say.  See: Patriot Act.  Israel stats bit skewed haredim poor immigrants Ethiopia Starting president Serum think we're kind talking apathetic people here, though. hesitant, simply lazy get shot. lazy part end pandemic that's killed 600,000 fellow Americans.  can’t manage Covid vaccinations widely available everyone, it’s game over. Cases falling Bangladesh, B.1.351 making majority. Surprising, right everything's control. also close 0 cases day! Lolol, took minute. nope! unhealthy behavior like drinking heavily low blood will, donating blood fine you. joking around. 4,03,000 30-40% vaccinated, still want rest following guidelines. Individually street, can't tell vaccinated, risking idiots claiming they're vaccinated way disprove it.

So scientifically, advocate policy (a political move) best resolves that. common tactic improve sanitation areas lacking, absolutely scientific also political tool. also Murphy required nursing homes house COVID-positive patients.

As New York one attacking Cuomo. good policy.  Right now, Indian people don’t information necessary make right decisions. government actively promoted superspreader events premise pandemic over. censoring information producing fake death numbers downplay crisis.


On top that, Prime Minister Modi actively sabotaging India’s Covid response political purposes. doesn’t make sense India’s response bad leader cares stopping Covid.


I think Modi going wait peak hits, act like something claim flattened curve. Modi gets opportunity, try perform sort authoritarian power grab something like cancel 2024 elections. Instability making Covid crisis worse help him.


On hand, Indians accurate information Covid spread last year, helped make good decisions. here. Sore fatigued still able psych final issues. I'm sure look best proctor care. Yes, that's true. case, someone's done research though. 😀 rebutted one like pouring water duck's back.

They'd rather believe twat Facebook town idiot. thing was, people took virus extremely seriously, sudden new year started cases decreased people fed media sources pandemic 'won war' parents often watch Indian reality shows pandemic referred past tense. hoes mad hoes mad That's interesting. university town (Ghent, Belgium) despoiled excess car traffic 1980s. inner city mostly pedestrianized now.

I one immediate family able get yesterday wife booked next week. Long covid amalgamation many symptoms: anyone one around dozen symptoms longer certain period time (3 weeks?) contracting covid generally counted.

There hard set definition, minimum that's generally included long covid data sets keep eye peer reviewed studies come in.

One important thing note key create bassline 'control groups' people contract covid separate signal noise. Society large going lot trama anxiety manifest neurological physical symptoms. get bottom problem develop effective treatments want focus cases induced contacting covid. Interesting - shrink think that? anyone else taking 2nd Pfizer vaccine get really stuffy nose lots mucus??? check numbers - disappointed, that's better expected! forgot Ventura County one thing another? government India fault “Muricans” dunce Ventilation much harder improve, though.

A large front investment building, even possible. buildings poorly thought out, properly ventilating never going viable.

We really better buildings, seriously don't, obvious focus things achievable. Here's today's update, commentary today, numbers.

**CDC** update first dose shots:

34,451 first dose shots. Last week 51,448. 

7 day rolling avg 29,417. 31,845 yesterday. 

4,115,668 residents first doses - 59.71% (4,081,217 - 59.21% yesterday)

74.28% adults now

At rate, first dose shots:

On

May 15th - 4,321,588

May 31st - 4,792,262

June 15th - 5,233,519

**Eligible population numbers (based 5,540,726 population)**

**Fully vaccinated estimates**

Using date 95% adults dose 1, get second dose 31 days later (1 month Moderna), plus additional 14 days immunity kick in, put us date of: Sunday, August 1st (- 29 days), 95% adults fully vaccinated.

Notes: 

* Pfizer EUA expanded age 12, eligible population updated approximately 6,101,782, estimated 12+ population using 2020 census (7,029,917 overall) (not 2019 estimate). FDA EUA 12-15 expected soon, probably sometime next week Same! got mine yesterday NS. Wife booked next week. People shooting vaccines free beer? Wild country live  Whatever works used stones destroy stones Surely hungover one beer? county! sure ashamed proud…. Never underestimate power booze. Uh huh. gets full formal authorization still refusing take excuse. Ironically though, looks like US UK passed well us. Higher price, grant still. Best way get drunk you’re budget Bars already look/scan IDs go bar... Restaurants sell alcohol also to... hard scan QR code giving seats patrons. takes literally 1 second extra. keep restaurant safe... I'm sure government smart put law saying they'll shut FDA safety violation like they've already shut businesses... Already rats restaurant they'll shut cause pass inspection. start spreading virus cause check vaccine passports shut down. hope instate it. F antivaxxers. never allowed restaurant ever again. Get vaccine they'll allowed in. allowed participate society....that's way get get vaccinated... 

They still order groceries car order food delivered pick inside whatever eating inside. work home also. Make natural selection great again. Whatever takes [not It’s funny they’re named Corona Brilliant pathetic im hoping don't. shitty initial response was, hope country suffer same. mean “for now”

No vaccine ever give complete immunity, likely ever live world Covid thing 

Just gotta learn live rather live life fear paranoia 

What’s next? longer eating food might choke? would done free, nice perk vaccine trial in.  would bar check vaccine cards now? laws requiring so.  lot things leaders could done time, I'm incredibly disappointed didn't. want see pressuring people, circulated tips taking care pandemic, might done bit good -- physically mentally.

My upper back got really bad 2 months staying home. took 45-60 min walk nearly every day, that's enough make sitting around entire rest day. ended PT, really want pandemic, great state mind -- focused making progress, also kinds problems cause directly. Imagine science. You’re essentially testing things see true false. soreness may little sleepy first dose. Second dose last week arm definitely little sore, tired next day, me. he’s idiot... think biggest blunder aside focusing disinfecting floors (and countries literally spraying streets, trees, birds disinfectants) promoting opening windows doors businesses more.

I'm saying open window would prevented pandemic, course not, many places perpetually stuffy obvious help situation.

I thinking months ago saw restaurant's ""outdoor tent"" four walls closed! open damn thing get inside. Technically, guess fit CA's outdoor policy time, could also argue building ""outdoors"" able eat inside logic.

Anyways. Regardless mandate, stressed importance airflow encouraging businesses leave open front door, open many windows possible, try get fresh air in. know took forever barely admit airborne, promote insane cleaning ever mention airflow?

Even now, tell bus rideshare drivers crack window? simple thing could really cut viral load. Don’t let fool you, evangelicals Baptists love booze, won’t drink front pastor. certain construction worker [One Froggy Evening (Warner Bros. always knew would work. approved. christians hate booze

You're place clearly want push narrative. provided single piece data - conjecture assumptions. can't say I'm surprised though. Thank you! Look post history sub run. Good, don’t get drunk. mean, already started ramping exports coming weeks since started give time. Okay, question why? flu vaccine different context?

Because see way. Well, exposing everyone covid one way get immunity! Okay first amount protection get vaccines real world 95%. 

Those results studies last spring/summer cases much lower variants. factors known skew numbers maybe update information. 

It’s reason need 90%+ vaccination reach herd immunity whereas last year needed 70%+. 

Second yes, asking people I’m close contact vaccination status I’m vaccinated, demanding cards people don’t trust. too.

Great solution allow anti-vaxxers create second class people making public spaces dangerous anyone cannot medically get vaccine.

It’s minor inconvenience carry another piece ID. sound like sort person bitches CVS wear mask. Gross. dont degrade man, focus what's important dont get distracted Hesitant vaccine? bout five dollar beer? Lol Jabs dabs? Wait get first sentence. serious?

I'd expect dip high.

People gonna need peace, love understanding y'all. Hopefully means experience he’ll diving least. hero Herd immunity going local think.

If everyone town vaccinated, hopefully they're going alright even town hour away high vaccination rate. sounds serious Agreed!  extremely impressive achievement considering rural nomadic mongolia (iirc 1/3 nomadic/semi-nomadic) definitely help end current awful outbreak Mongolia going through. 
I'm guessing spend much time around bars restaurants hilarious little would checked.

First, checks this? alcohol based alcoholic enforcement board jurisdiction, health department? barely able stop businesses operating last year!

And who's going pass law? even pass proper covid relief...this far controversial.

I work progressive area bars restaurants. hundreds clients go establishment. Wanna guess many times I've seen someone ask vaccine card someone comes in? Like actually literally zero. ""I firm believer people. given truth, depended upon meet national crisis. great point bring real facts, beer."" drinking, eating bathing beer vaccinate. Places that, really working well. Money buy beer? CAN'T BUY US!!! beer? Oh, well, case! wrong messaging developed countries well? It’s much doom Whatever fucking takes. need start offering blowjobs, it. Beer liquor never sicker Wonder much easier would get drunk blood donation. ~12% higher bal? This. 

Last year, India gave 4 hours notice world's strictest lockdown.

This year, despite less 10% population first vaccine shot, enormous political rallies religious festivals. Plus contagious B117 strain.

Horrific heartbreaking :/ know state (ID), removed residency requirement couple weeks ago. Anyone 16+ get vaccine now.   Brexiters going wondering UKs share vaccines Great question.  one beer wayyy potent giving blood theory intense brutal lockdown last year enforced police. But, leaders decided defeated Covid, opened political rallies huge religious festivals. One festival 3 million people week. Personal anecdote: son recently tested positive. making stay basement 2 children tested negative (getting re-tested tomorrow). husband vaccinated, going spend time regular basis, kid alone basement 10 days. tested Thursday negative. Yes! prevent infection! Exactly that’s what’s f’ed up. world me, me, me….is simply disgusting disappointing. mean, works better people get also decreases chance exposed. sub: SMH 1 100000 chance clots. Get fricking AZ vaccine. that's nothing.

Also sub: OMG 1 100000 chance death. Vaccines mean safe! got second Pfizer shot! 🥳 overestimating many people care ""super spreader events"" risk getting severely sick covid low, personally vaccinated. Got different local grocery store.  think sub's rule headline match article's headline exactly. agree, would nice posts made location obvious Delaware New England RI showing #9 list. double checked. I'm talking specifically flu look situation nursing homes. took strict precautions (at least around essentially isolate rest world), virus still accidentally carried lot places people take care elderly sick.

Why? lives outside workplace (with, even careful, least close contact spouses kids around even people work/school...). scenario, whole societies took precautions, wore masks etc.. Imagine easy would chain reaction happen one vulnerable gave damn. So, unless want lock caretakers along vulnerable, way shield reliable manner.

On top people actual caring facilities, tons high risk people ages living amongst us. Wearing masks public would hardly enough protect many infected care-free people encounter. mention psychological terror trying protect high risk patients care for/live max trying navigate world care. Free beer tabs jabs. Yeah, question? Let’s keep people alive healthy.   One point make easily faked *wasn't* incentive use sort official document.  think need drop whole Get Vaccines People argument bc obviously didn’t work convincing folks wear masks think lot us really learned selfish people past year. think need emphasize positives vaccine vaccinated only. got vaccine prevent getting severe case Covid feel safer near others indoors. others, positive might free beer. Buffalo thing do.

Source: Buffalo. Vaccines improve odds. 

There's nothing fair this, is. please tell joke. exactly point getting vaccinated again? Seems like nothing changed 3 weeks vaccinated. Indeed. Much like social/physical distancing, vaccination something works fullest community level. Places weaker sense society may struggle this. Meaning? got second shot Safeway gave coupons 10% groceries total (up $200...so $20 off). didn’t know surprisingly nice bonus. don’t even think they’re advertising it, should. could nice incentive especially people already coupon. used quite bit couponing partner first got college less money, could tell really good coupon deals (people post things online) shelves wiped clear them. That’s big subsect people could entice there. tend privilege actual human lives ""rights"" legal entities, we're gonna agree disagree one. case, we're talking government granted enforced monopolies form patents rather equity stakes. Texas Florida stack comparison India] irrelevant current conversation. Florida could create even **worse situation seeing India currently.**

Choose one. unfortunate, know risks going out. vaccine passport would also serve exclude them, right? can't get vaccinated mean can't sick. Congratulations!🎉 Fight fire fire That's said before, link gave work.

Novavax also enter cells, generates measurable cell response. *offers free beer*

*gets vaccinations Erie County*

Government: “How make sure everyone gets vaccinated?”

The evidence right fucking there. Give people incentive lol Cant fucking believe price low haha 1 beer took Great news, thanks much sharing!  Everyone says political, honestly makes sense. weak political response denial almost certainly cost election. think much better explanation forget politics, remember money tied hotels restaurants — devastated COVID. yeah would prefer phone tied hip time. I'm replying I'm also really curious this. seemed absolutely squashed problem India, seems like rest world finally getting control, India explodes. expecting headlines summer last year, are. They're actually still middle pack testing rates. found cool new dashboard CDC 

Florida testing roughly rate Pennsylvania Wisconsin. rate slightly higher Washington state's. CDC page go in-depth positivity rate, they're line many states 6-10% range. don’t actually need bring next appointment. forgot mine car wrote new one second dose. lot vaccine hesitancy government level. Free beer free beer free beer freedom free beer? ...no, wait - what? paying attention states................ lol. jesus. so, point vaccinating. GOT IT. sad Americans' paranoia government leads make decisions harmful health health communities. also depressing principles skewed free beer takes undermine paranoia. Current alcoholic, former drinker ;-). I've traveled world never provide anything like that.

Governments free require want, travel places do. right choose give personal medical information to. job gives $50 everyone get second shot Perhaps EU banned exports they'd able vaccinate people quicker? Americans still waiting vaccines exporting tons politicians would crucified streets. think anyone would stand that. sidenote, Krispy Kreme donut campaign going? know people getting free daily donut? fuck NK Southeast Asia Erie County, NY Buffalo. close enough Erie, PA.  Yes, applies one specific company even close delivering promised (and still isn't).

Meanwhile, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna Janssen obstacles whatsoever exporting product.

US: exports banned.

EU: Exports reported. fall unreasonably far behind commitment us, may decide prohibit exports.

See difference? think havin excuse tell buddies. never heard advice anywhere. think that's vaccination period. sure. 99.9999% percent isn’t 100, sure.

But 0.0001 percent chance getting hit asteroid today still go outside. fun aspect, privacy concerns go right away. works.

For example, technically smartphone useful device tracking datamining you. people love apps. also people can't wear seatbelts due thoracic problems. shut highways them. could always cross-reference lot number date location. would copy info legitimate card unless name checked too. years statement made less mad understanding anything. take personally accept fact. some, sure. also boat load vaccines prove attending school.

Is seriously new information you? Antiguan here, hearing misfortune islands south everything go depressed state many governments either care dropped ball otherwise position negotiate better/ higher doses. also AZ, PM Browne apparently initially ordered 5000 doses population 120k.

Hard fathom region catch developed societies, still battling thing well 2023.  Covid deniers always depended taking advantage areas doubt. bad news bars forced check IDs… stack comparison India?

This irrelevant current conversation. continue ignore data proves Texas Florida different position India December. 

No, I'm not. I'm seeing data rest data demonstrates Texas Florida could create even worse situation seeing India currently. need take measures beyond vaccination programs control virus concrete data shows otherwise, simply speculating.

No, I'm extrapolating incomplete data.

You're speculating assuming data complete drawing conclusions. Pigouvian subsidy action. technically true, right time push messaging. Luckily she’s advisor. power. keep face clean clear without scarring.

Be careful you’ve reusing disposable masks lot going without frequently washing reusable ones. It’s breeding ground staph Yeah great. What’s sad share huge rock humanity people won’t step get vaccine pandemic that’s sake humanity. everyone other. Offer fools share rock free beer come crawling hovels. 'Muricans fucking privileged even need convinced take fucking vaccine people India dying droves. Ridiculous need adopt strategy NYC well.

Please discuss drink options would result best turnout. dumb. Somewhere along way someone give need adapt. Keep going growing! (4 years sober)  much hesistant population young may possibly drinking age. also evangelical christians hate booze much time have?  Guess better leave bar go back home. Beer cheaper.

Just make sure billed vaccine they've already shots. going lose something like this, need better organization skills. lose Social Security card Debit Card? don’t see “vaccines won’t stop transmission” ever argument getting vaccinated. vaccines can’t stop transmission, rational choice it’s even important get vaccinated, don’t get seriously sick *do* get infected. covid-is-a-scam crowd’s arguments haven’t gotten better pandemic progressed. “I support export control mechanisms put place European Commission. support fact must block exports long drug companies don’t respect commitments Europeans,"" IIRC, found benefits single drink reducing inflammation, worse immune response drinking 4 day.

It's medical record. secure document/proof anything. Shut nerd literally named ""Shot Chaser"". Get’r done. However gets done, don’t care. weeks we're absolutely going hearing stories people getting way two shots free beer. ""I've 48 shots, dude. Every Friday Saturday night hit spots get shot free beer. 5th one tonight."" Haha, hilarious... Florida go ahead call bluff Important keep perspective vaccinating peak levels USA, every day, thousands get vaccinated. I'm disappointed low uptake among young people. facilities kids kept cages. PTSD living Pandemic and/or stress returning normal year high stress (similar troops returning home). feel like surprised actually works, but... I'm not. long people choosing get vaccinated I'm whatever takes! yet single anecdote someone infected full vaccination dying confirmed. Every time either lack confirmation (easy) turns infected full vaccination. suspected cases.

Let turn around: many deaths 2 months first dose, 1 month second dose? don’t carry covid vaccinated unless breakthrough case, rare.

Vaccination mandatory, since government bunch pussies, we’ll block fools somehow. Nearly half **one country** (India). Holy shit. happily give $2k bj ya man. disgusting people want send military ""help"". Several countries already sent helped without threatening use military. offensive man.
look comments also. top rated comments saying us govt send military anyway least sanction india. old ""spreading democracy"" lie.
No sane country would want invite US military country. US citizens live offensive world think brown countries waiting white masters save then. 
I know downvoted like cant tolerate truth. meh. 
As Indian, know well thing want vaccine materials oxygen cylinders. it. need white saviours teach us ""democracy"" like teach Pakistan, Afghanistan middle east. Young people really need step game. Everyone get vaccinated there's excuse low numbers younger demographics. ""Here's means"" = Well clearly article worth reading bump two brains cells together might spark better comment stupidity vaccine help prevent spread, well. top post sub type two studies showing that. much agree opinion phone thing, second part comment outdated information since proven false. heard as, ""how stop baptist drinking beer fishing trip? Invite 2 Baptists."" absolutely true. Public health authorities reported breakthrough cases, may be. Ahh Buffalo NY, city Alcoholics, failed sports teams. home town.. reminds joke heard reddit years back. What's difference catholic baptist? Catholics say hello see liquor store.  I'm sorry viking logo.   Bah guess I’m small group zero reaction. 1st Pfizer felt like mild bruise injection sight. dose 2 36 hours ago far it’s uneventful. bruised feeling spread 1st dose, noticeably milder. Yes, also consider day hundreds still dying number could far less people getting vaccinated more. Also immunity likely wanes time also racing well. got second shot lady told alcohol 15 days. society values personal gain caring people, result. dont win game love, win stepping toes building moat around island. too, young dumb.

Notes:

* Source data downloaded [CDC vaccination demographic trends Data appears date reported, though CDC indicates ""Date Administered"". Race/ethnicity sex data also available.
* Texas (about 9% US) excluded CDC data, tables match national totals.
* CDC reports vaccinations 0-17 age group. 16-17 age group size derived 2019 Census estimates comprise 11.4% aged 0 17. Assumes 0-17 doses given aged 16-17. Thanks fixing link. 

Novavax enter cells. simply protein injected bloodstream. theory different inactivated vaccines, though include proteins novavax really absolute ton important protein. measured reasonable amount cellular immunity, though real world trials suggest could worse mutations vaccines.

This interesting reading inactivated vaccines. hand seen high level protective immunity, across strains, within short period second dose inactivated vaccines. looking good Australia honeymoon. got married end 2019 BTW.  Jeebus sorry read friend. COPD?! Wtf. seeing someone well? Medical trauma joke emerged species 50,000-70,000 years ago, invented writing 5,500 years ago, figured vaccines 80 years ago. course fucking morons, evolutionarily still cave-people. Yeah, probably right. let media trick clickbait headlines seems. Still, numbers pretty pathetic consider 1 Billion doses given there's nothing special 12-15yr old immune systems would cause think would react differently. Tell someone ONE beer see well stay sober haha. celebratory bud light second dose. don’t trust people restraint though! helping would even worse shape different climate?  still August entire state well.  think private businesses going go back mask optional CDC gives clear.

Local businesses would case-by-case basis. national chains, right CDC all-clear. There'd much problems people living near state borders.

For example, live half hour DC Virginia. lot people. imagine many annoying customers would ""Well Target that's 10 minutes away Virginia says wear mask DC"". Presumptuous assume anything beliefs, suppose that's happens live outside, envious greatest nation Earth ever (or ever) see :3 Yea buddy say soldier hurt like day others end spectrum said really sick like 2 days after. Modi didn’t listen advisors predicted outbreak happening political reasons, I’ve read. wanted large campaign events. heard either, valid expression. ""I agree purchase"", ""I agree purchase"". Oh that's retracted show happily buy beer.  Whatever works Whatever works! Great! Whatever gets 'em shots! like playing airplane game babies get eat creamed potatoes. Ah, sinovaccine 50% effectiveness. surprising. Israel used Pfizer. That’s data. are, it. reward though creating social pressure. [Natgeo good piece worked normalize polio work gave $1000 getting shots, boss said get twice he'll pay again.

Really tempted try see get 3rd shot.

Haven't yet feels wrong everyone chance get yet (beyond US available) isn’t study. It’s one guys opinion Got keep strength up. sounds like mayor problem anything. Except EU said would talk put concrete proposal, instead talking could done can’t done. 

So instead getting together working solution, want us figure present plan say terrible doesn’t take account input. get covid, kill someone love. got 2nd shot 5/7 Pfizer- BioNTech may onto something here. least means people showing follow shot needed. Well yeah, also Ryan Reynolds. vaccination *rate* evidence EU *de-prioritized*? Well technically catch spread since vaccines aren’t 100% effective. real world chances happening low.   hope ever dies gets respawn smarter person bother read article? It’s sad incentive all. you’re still wondering covid decimated country way did, needn’t look understand. America wanted it. paid it. passed tests purchase agreement would using it.

That's serious German press saying. impression US trouble getting people vaccine bad reputation AZ makes hard sell American public would prefer Pfizer anything. soon approved going generously give Indian somewhere else. 

I sorry European perspective America playing America. Biden much America First WRT vaccines Trump.   sure I'm afraid, quite large proportion apparently since government favoured heavily British produced. actual medical benefit reason wearing masks vaxed? cant catch spread it, seems like theatre point. response ""what happens anti-maskers pandemic?""

Who cares Misleading title article. need put division everything. us man women others suffered equally. like women fear life family members. you... gatekeeping not-yet fully defined medical term actual medical researchers? American, hope subsidize hell vaccine countries get/afford it. Oh carry strongly fight obesity, child trafficking promoting mental health advances.

/s Whst talking specifically? areas people cautious covid likely get vaccinated likely cautious opening up. extreme areas full people think covid like flu unwilling get vaccinated protest lockdowns. plenty sources say epidemiologists believe 9 months believe variants render current vaccines useless. boosters solve problem variants could evolve current catastrophe India rest SE Asia? That's wildcard could extend pandemic even US administration concerned with. research, read article. Here's one simple google search yields. another variants rendering vaccines ineffective, polling sources describe happy path ending pandemic? 

The problem many sub, including admin locked thread NYT article saying misleading, believe living sitcom everything ok end season. That's reality. Look happening world. number global cases all-time look like succeeding vaccinations, shutdowns social distancing mask wearing? getting worse. pour every resource effort helping developing nations contain spread, instead trying open Broadway ballgames, wont anytime soon. think still case used given glass Guinness donating blood Ireland thought rich iron. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* line peaked last year time practically lockdowns extremely strongly implies herd immunity contributed peak.

Nonsense. Unless 10 million Indians died point, India nowhere close herd immunity.. super, duper small amount people can't get vacc, bruv: small worth anyone vaxx cards. government gets power like giving back. 

dude, can't. seem like reasonable enough gent - bleep mean this? keep seeing vaccine cards bandying line make sense me. i'll outline below:

1. *what 'power' goverment getting? vax requirements place long time - including especially international travel*
2. *how would said 'power' help future regarding, 'muh freedumz' - gonna make us show vax cards diseases what?*
3. *carrying around card name, date shot, type shot signed technician far, far cry 'private, medical information,'. agree/disagree* Source given AZ vacciens away?  Ok France highest number anti vaxxers per capita world. hostility different generation? like ""the youth"", reversed. wait age see least behavior older generation becomes understandable you? without evidence.  continue fucking assholes reason society continues accept despite fucking assholes. Maybe, free beer free beer. exported that.

Not true.  End personal risk yes, still small chance spread (no near much unvaccinated still 0) received vaccine yet best exercise precautions anyone vaccine yet hanging w them. IE still need wear masks public awhile yet. vaccine hang inside though go nuts. great, hope non-vaccinated people same.  You’re intellectually dishonest here. Europeans say “export” don’t mean donating vaccines, they’re letting companies sell move vaccines EU.

You shouldn’t lie know. still believe ? still believe SARS -cov-19? 
Do still belive science ? anxiety sometimes makes brooding useless stuff ah well thanks needed comforting seem like happy people another country suffering makes country look better somehow. competition instead real people dying daily. Dunno, gave idea. ICU hospital capacity seemed major problem while. Mirror works EU: Source: trust bro 😎 Looks like AZ yet confirmed. class severe disease doesnt change fact vaccinated STILL got infected several requiring hospital intervention. part scaremongering? Anything vulnerable 

which would vaccine working intended would concerning... It'd ha quicker say friends stop talking ass there's evidence immunity would 
completely fade year working immune system  intubation doesnt mean severe severe. asses individual obs charts that. Yeah unfortunately right, ant-vaxxers following evidence based findings, reinforce idea vaccines work. catch variant suffer greatly others vaccine, say vaccine created rather reason, perhaps bad health begin got bad luck tougher strain.   Yeah I'm sorry. would happen infected situation? Would vaccine protect me?

No, afraid. Shots take couple weeks. still, used precautions, odds side. Kids age inside bars begin singling individual case

Literally, multiple proof anything put context

The article say proof, casts doubts questions regarding efficacy vaccine groups, mentioned earlier. actual studies show outbreaks frequent expected, we'll talk.

And think studies start come from? first step ladder study strength 'case study'. Another step 'series study'. constitutes series study since multiple patients - even care home. However, article literally uses care home ONE many examples current spread outbreak particular efficacy figures vaccines applicable large populations

This categorical wrong. Modern medicine groups efficacy individual structures - thats say vaccine shouldnt given pregnant women - made blanket statement general population. article highlights efficacy vulnerable (i.e. large population) may greatly reduced patients required hospitalisation, recovery attributed vaccine instead intervention administered hospital. 

These vaccines given elderly first deemed benefit. wrong, vaccines offer benefit thought certainly protection thought, vaccines offered next group, children attention schools. Right 4 hours shot arm fucking sore like someone hit every 10 minutes fascinating differently bodies react shot. first AZ shot arm killing two days. even sleep properly. pain started like 5-6 hours shot, progressed something uncomfortable every movement hurts. disappeared. little bit, runny. mostly fever/fatigue. Deaths increase certainly always lag case increases. Normally I’d agree stance unfortunately reaching herd immunity means endangering actually cannot get vaccinated legit medical situations diseases disorders care much hitting 70%. managed avoid sick year (besides covid) suffering stupid cold🤧, boohoo.

I want refund life. 😒 probably equal lower canada currently. US still reporting hundreds deaths per day actually happened weeks got 2nd Moderna didn’t get anything sore arm. almost disappointed expecting crazy bad side effect bodies different ig don’t care anymore.

Exactly. People stopping care really really long, change days actually sunny that's enough rarity Hamburg. vaccinated people allowed whatever want, pretty soon going non-vaccinated people also whatever want 

 - dont care anymore.

 - Police can't go around pulling everyone street, asking show vaccine cards. parents (both elderly) 2nd dose vaccine (AZ) two weeks both. That's right? End pandemic them? understand 70% effectiveness means (OK, kinda do, enough feel confident)

I first dose AZ Thursday. imagine, still ways go me. Go back Xbox sub  someone paywall access give summary? euro-nationalist

That's Pfizer BioNTech started working mRNA vaccine development back 2018. exactly partnered develop vaccine. link refers ""collaboration.""

Pfizer paid **for access** research collaboration like Chinese Fosun Pharma I've linked elsewhere, Pfizer alone contributed loaned money development Europe combined.

Sure did, like single-handedly partnered BioNTech, without Pfizer BioNTech would never ever come idea, right?

What Pfizer buy way stakes one prospective mRNA startups, one started help German going try inflate national ego, least link contradictory info post.

That's rich considering that's exactly whole lot Americans doing. Creating narrative ""good"" vaccines come US BioNTech vaccine suddenly American invention American Pfizer single-handily invented paid themselves. 

The countless countries, governments, people involved? trying inflate national egos, unlike Americans, known never ever something that, humble it.  submission linking webmd.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Curious mostly Chinese Russian vaccines, people worried China's influence?

Some big nations help, choose to. people expect Serbs suck die pandemic, what? European money came September anyway, manufacturing Germany domestic meeds. development done late stage trials concluding. 

European nationalistic garbage indeed.  That's drink 6 pack Anywhere /r/Coronavirus balanced *discussion* happens. sub arguing *your* sides points. That's take anyway. funded 100% development costs buddy. That's good  Well better does. places can't wait, like literally.  Pathetic. American problems require american solutions ""Maan, thought vaccine giving 5g nanobots autism, I'd anything beer."" Like said, restrictions export bans lifted quite time now.

I get restricting exports controversial decision EU (and tbh commission kinda fucked ordering process), think sharing vaccines world especially poor countries good thing.  flowed India time aswell, no? that, Italy legal drinking age 16 buy alcohol Scotts beer wine meal 16+.

Shot, shot, shot, shot, shot!

Everybodeyyy!!! Hey! I’ve fully vaccinated 2 months. went theatre weeks ago great. theatre allowed go without mask long seat. 10 people (was weeknight late showing). you’re worried, go showing hours - guarantee you’ll theatre mostly :) 

Regardless, you’re vaccinated otherwise healthy, odds getting covid moderately busy indoor place still low. Cuomo sending covid positive patients nursing homes, vulnerable population... course least 1/3 covid deaths New York back manufactures

The time re-evaluating cost vs benefit mitigation measures US quickly coming nearly half country least one dose final announcement masks distancing go can't come soon enough  completely valid approach opt vaccinate citizens first.

It's selfish export virtually nothing long. vaccine rollout like 10-20% behind rn right due exports, it'd still pretty fast. least save money groceries spend alcohol.  feel like would ok large music festivals sporting events basic day day essential locations? can’t see enforce that. government medical industries driven controlled corporations people's best interest mind.

Tbf loan token one circumvent Trump's malicious contract terms (which forbade exporting like literally). think it'll repaid. It’s difficult strong misinformation campaigns malintent many people general lack knowledge (to put less succinctly, lots people stupid)

He isn’t disagreeing you, kind thinking whimsically think we’re going able get everyone vaccinated. Seeing things slowing down, I’m interested we’ll even get 70-80%. Either way we’ll return normal eventually, mask mandates, social distancing, prohibition large gatherings last forever Someone start petition WH this. Anyone gets fully vaccinated gets six pack courtesy Uncle Sam. Yeah, many people comorbidities put risk strong enough response vaccine? really need J&amp;J vaccine this. many going get 2nd dose?

On daily deaths chart, hover April 2020. two weeks 700 every day. April 17 1000. athletics vaccinated come Japan?

Besides many actually are? Tens thousands most, could mere number delay public getting vaccinated?

Maybe issue supply evidence right fucking there. Give people incentive lol

For us incentive ""Don't die live permanent lung and/ heart issues...."" hey throwing beer top helps... go it. Pfizer Moderna vaccines provide extremely high level protection. Based alone risk factor dramatically lowered otherwise would be. risk transmitting virus others also lowered dramatically. wear well fitting mask provides small additional protection top this.

If exceedingly small group vaccinated people catch Covid, virtually guaranteed minor case cause severe symptoms like needing supplemental oxygen hospitalization. risk death Covid probably functionally zero assuming specific underlying health risks.

So guess I’d need know feel concerned about. people fail conceptualize dramatic twenty fold reduction risk is. went daydrinking \~12 hours second shot. worried I'd feel waking up,

Had coconut water straight getting vaccine, drank plenty water. Woke feeling great. hangover, even sore arm (had hell sore arm vaccine #1). true. source front read last week one local state roundups breakthrough patients definitely contracted full vaccine time elapsed died. IIRC 80s however. Sputnik V used there. Cases dropped zero even faster Israel Pfizer vaccinations.  wonder doses come from. Cons normally pro ID hope get back second Pfizer Moderna.

Simple, offer booze proof shots.  I'm NJ fully vaccinated didnt know this. Thanks!  People already vaccinated gladly availability issue Canada here.. u guys leave ur houses? Dam wish vaccines Brazil... I'd take one without beer part Looking status people living slum, natural assume so, beside issue caused unemployment can't simply simply resolved distribution food. frustrates much see stories like this. It’s enough vax free due Dems gvt? really need persuasion via booze? Imagine buy like 20$. Absolutely worth we’re bribing people booze, we’re likely never getting Covid. bet get Covid boosters every year like flu forever. civilized. Imagine vsccine people willing get imagine sitting amount waving towards countries without vaccine.

Kind hilarous think it. Dats humor.

Cant USA bomb ends quicker? point would polite. Sad country. would actually really interesting see much would pay people. people would probably decide get paid $50-100. might need $500-1k decide might worth looking real facts vaccine. people would absolutely convinced government trying pay take shot destroy lives amount money worth letting government destroy life. 👌☮️ hear yet. know similar would've expect anything different Gotcha. Hopefully means country go back normal soon. thinking try collect all. Like Pokemon!  TBH think scared seeing spike threatened progress forward let fear get better making statements. 

Which cause bit public messaging nightmare CDC White House. meant correction tip human human:

Per se. per say.

Much love. Perhaps got tell ""please take vaccine order making trouble others""? Lol rare brain cancer know effect immune response. also found it. also wear found want set good example others. Novavax highest efficacy, 96%, classic strain. fell quite bit B.1.351, near levels worst vaccines classic strain - would still end pandemic month enough doses.

The novavax vax lot spike protein. spike protein may absorbed cells, inactivated virus might be, special protein gets taken targeted cells. missing something link give says 80% efficacy death

This issue measuring every vaccine death - looking day death. vaccines take month give protection, infection within first month could easily cause death within months 2 3. mRNA vaccines nice give protection week, far tell level seems close 100% *every* vaccine can't measure difference.

The Seychelles interesting data point. cases rising despite 65% really fully vaccinated, looks weird first glance. 80% positive tests unvaccinated people, (assuming homogeneity obviously false) shows 84% ish efficacy vaccines. well vaccinated tourist country entirely open borders, means they're going keep cases client countries stop massive cases. first glance looks like failure vaccines, look 80% number shows even worst vaccines really work.

Side note, feel really interesting discussion, apologize jumping earlier. posted incorrect link really thought purpose end conversation. Says lot. anything, needs controlled Bangladesh right humanitarian distaster Myanmar, Myanmar people, fucked military forces, resources deal this. think thing people need consider looking data.

If constant state decline like currently even slightest disturbance trends technically going spike, even tiny enough brief enough mean shit grand scheme.  ride share australia crack window &amp; wear mask - rider /passenger / also sit back seat -&amp; uber-pool last year either.  Surprisingly, yes! mean 4 PM movie amount people expect 4 PM movie Friday pre-pandemic. honestly thought there'd far less people. 40-50 people theater.  It’s probably people putting forgetting schedule right getting free Krispy Kreme doughnut go brewery beer. sounds like good time me! Go Bills! Go Sabres! means doses (Canada) supposed get Europe go somewhere else. make sort thing.  EU/UK, IDK rationale could restrictions restrictions sake. person 10 years ago. politically motivated therefore complete lack understanding Congress. Hell, didn’t even know CNN leaned liberal Fox News leaned conservative. pandemic happened 10 years ago would like deer head light regarding vaccines. beer would certainly thrown edge get shot. 

I won’t judge anyone convinced get shot free beer. guess could work, wonder companies would find worth government would bother.

There's going to, already is, massive push get back normal covid, idea lingering covid restrictions passed government likely going large political liability. think great, love Buffalo!! two get two beers since I’m double vaxxed? :(( :)) consider differences British english American english slang. line logic, yeah totally weird news outlets titling articles slang. Wise - know long covid variant shite going keep going for. 
Wise- oz Govs get better quality quarantine operations set up.
Wise- sufficient population vaccinated/then boosters Indian variants. Calling “surge” bit dishonest. Surge implies something exponential unmanageable support social security nets?

You realise they're help people also keep people using criminal methods earn.

Not everyone welfare dumb lazy many reward betters society. What? I'm one said vaccines still getting arms, still making progress. vaccinated day became eligible.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  models article infections surging right now. simply off. texas covid deaths, though going down, indicate catching number people infected. I'm confused, one post talks vaccine demand supply shortage, much screwing countries sake, post saying bribe ppl get it? incredibly selfish viewpoint say ""I need get vaccinated catching covid big deal family"". whole point people get vaccinated better absolutely everyone. get vaccine massive, lazy child. CDC telling fully vaccinated people wear masks outdoors help people believe say. Why? They're good. reaction second moderna shot. felt miserable exactly one day. got shot Friday, Saturday felt terrible, Sunday morning like nothing happened. can't argue results. Using ""common sense"" anything terrible way debating getting world view.

Conservatives use term ""common sense"" time make point. 

Even people left know use ""common sense"" come incorrect conclusions. Evidence used anything else, common sense. There's probably social pressure still wear mask look like anti masker. Yeah.

The concern 65% fully vaccinated yet still bunch cases. also really small sample size tourist nation fully open borders. Looking 80% positive tests unvaccinated actually indicates really good (better expected) vaccine results. problem latest data used models March, US beginning see bump due B117 variant. simply outdated point. states completely open might change law. Right can't cause people fully vaccinated make law 70% vaccinated fully opening make restaurants want to, use QR code patrons. might hope that. It'll safer everyone do. Gyms thing first time scan they'll info. hard gyms fastest way spread virus let people masks gyms gonna spread non maskers. planet fitness say ""show us QR/vaccine card first time come in"" hard. system come go time cause it'll locked scan card. mostly asking USA let Pfizer Moderna good capitalists sell stuff produce USA around world.  awful idea Til small country (size) Nepal pop 30m. dominant dangerous variants coming countries? Give pint, take pint! Wait no... revised, fucking stupid. enough people world never get vaccinated ensure setting 0 goal never going viable. goal get everyone wants vaccine vaccine, throw open let rest people learn personal responsibility means practice. Obviously incompetent leadership. Close yr eyes dead weight arm - let go limp shot / might make difference fir next time ☮️ huge difference disease prevention infection prevention.

The initial studies disease prevention, exceptional. know actual infection prevention studies like this. Which, thankfully, also appears exceptional.

For comparison, polio vaccine protected person vaccine, could still spread virus around them, prevent infection. Apparently Moderna planning combination flu/covid shot Ah right thought Seychelles concern previously vaccinated individuals *hospitalised* Covid. Instead it’s positive tests possibly asymptomatic? area pretty much everyone point. life less normal that's meant. mean, want free beer? many interest here, though, logic is:

Poison + free beer poison 

Since think vaccines like long short term poison. 

Hence, claim solid. people fucking stupid. sure alternatives. thought far. press briefing Wednesday, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said ""we path this,"" maintained ""variants wild card could reverse progress made.

But hasn’t every study piece data collect pretty much contradict stuff variants? try keto someone dining seeing friends leisurely shopping nonstop entire vaccine waiting period (and whole pandemic that), still like calmly see 2 weeks up? I’m used thinking parents hard new baby obsessed indoor dining socializing. finally safe hang vaccine alone?  hearts go India Reddit comments meant solve anything. guess CDC considering states open throughout May, honestly, actually don’t expect surge. Texas ear full baseball stadiums weeks hasn’t seen surge. think vaccines starting take hold limit spread, actually don’t think CDC’s prediction true. Pfizer actually 7 days! Wow truly first world problem solving right here. would say probably yes, you’ll confusing data situation given US CDC database Canadian database probably aren’t linked. Bring documents Canada vaccine pharmacist knows type date first dose was. may register CDC database well. 

Then bring CDC card back Canada doctor record received second dose. US death rate still higher almost every country. used total train wreck make suddenly success ""only"" 700 deaths day.

It's absurd things used basic common sense like vaccines controversial people like you. goal always used vaccinated everyone. Every kid vaccinated dozens diseases even wipe ass. suddenly mass vaccination much even possible? Ridiculous. Whoever said clearly never met coworkers.  cases continue decline, eventually even small pocket cases could called ""spike."" towns you’d never want move to. It’s worth paying beer tax live somewhere doesn’t make drink. Go Bills!!! Go Bills!! Go Bills!! Interesting, since aren’t even hundreds countries begin with. many people dying vaccinated old first. Plus, vaccines last least 6 months, that's long they've follow up. strategy vaccinate everyone. happen. strategy mitigate harm. Even getting non vulnerable catch recover helps. state fewest cases we're paying places like California NYC get open naturally immune population much bigger.  🎵🎶 Champagne vaccines, help get throughhh 🎶🎵 Go Bills!!! Biden uses $1000 gas grill, guaranteed. second shot wrecked me. awake night fever, headache eyes, next day slept day weak anything. Real eye opener. humans simply want feel secure friend gave blood low funds eat after, passed got take ambulance ER (which help broke). 

I'd love see burger shake joint blood drive give free fries discount meals folks give blood. Help make sure people replace give. Actually maybe broccoli (for iron)??? donno, nutritionist might better suggest. It’s almost like exact trend happened last year. wonder many people gotten multiple shots get free beer? I've worked many Indians love people. God truly hope get whatever supplies need 12 hours 2nd Pfizer shot really feeling it.

Burning nose, congested nose ears, feel really groggy like fever. 

Anyone else really congested nose post 2nd vaccine? one like lukewarm beer.   Whatever takes! don’t think weed thing work it’s making people smoke paranoid anti vaxx. trustworthy opinion? Exactly, main point still stands. Good know...

On top that, source says given 185 million USD, get optional 563 million dollars later needed. funds needed, already given BioNTech? so, given? give source that, would great. means according source, total potential investment would 748 million USD.

Nothing ordinary partner invests large amount, that's exactly partner. could see ""internal"" investments, basically investing vaccine developing, producing marketing together BioNTech. much BioNTech invest development? right mate, can't argue that. Take care yerself. meningitis b shots fuckin doozy  cannot really separate legal entities people easily that. Patents owned inventors, people, legal entities. inventors sell inventions anyone company choose. That’s patents list names inventors, ones afforded original rights work. 

So see break funding contract fact government choosing steal citizens rather pay market value work. Morally wrong, especially government afford pay value return gets purchase product many many times greater cost.

I used term equity used term control. Control use product ownership, equity. 

The cost vaccines, ranging $10-30 west incredibly good value. government return dose huge, take lost GDP date starting point. steal property inventors top this, would wrong. vaccines private property, sold great price grateful deal have. certainly pointless. Huge areas world still need vaccine, many countries particular Africa received one single dose yet. We, entire world, need vaccines get hands stop pandemic. fair, knew work. according study, *really* work. 

I'm still skeptical though. Gonna wait till there's evidence *really, really, really* work. Well, increased liberties, expect see rise again. Simply due number pissed people going circumventing regulations. Absolutely unbelievable full national lockdown hasn’t happened now. Arakan Myanmar passable border Bangladesh India's border Myanmar much longer far porous. refugees military crackdown coming India, Bangladesh. neither located next densest population centres. would Thailand. Still vast majority supply coming EU. It’s even comparable. 

And US still sitting 50m-60m doses AZ using. somehow know better virologists afraid happening then? subreddit become anti-vaxxer subreddit? 16 buy beer wine

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Ok, definitely read article. know. get saying. want pandemic over. infuriating see people make wrong choices selfishness plain stupidity.

But anger convince anyone. really hopeless cases, ignore those. wasting energy that, even Reddit.

But like said, totally get mean. Check BBC Financial Times articles. Yes. yes. Patanjali sketchy know enough Nuclear medicine comment paper. case, I'd hope DRDO Dr Reddy's getting involved (given Reddy's manufacturer vaccines medicines) there's possibility real drug. I'm behind anything strategically give unused doses small portions closet allies need end pandemic re-open all. Canada Mexico first protect North America whole. Giving 10% produce keeping 90% practically best choice. 

The thing though is, even give away produce. give like 10m-20m AZ stockpile we'll never use Canada fully vaccinate entire pop. rest 40m go Mexico/Central America. 

I know what's stopping them. Pfzier export ban expired. already know AZ FDA approved long time vaccine loans circumvent Trump's ban AZ.

By time Biden Administration anything now, it'll late still welcomed. ""export"" anything end June pointless. really hope poorer nations start receive vaccines output increases US nearing finishing line. need everyone protected protect everyone. 
Just shame slightly easier vaccines distribute (of approved ones)also look like harder scale compared mRNA ones. PC's Manitoba literally frothing mouth thinking opening up. 

All going take deaths hospital admittance reaching point stability hospitals function without collapse everything back menu. matter second dose, percent first dose even that's maybe. sorts headlines true, opinion, sound misleading, Germany’s cases going up. 

In reality gradually trickling down. We’ve gone 169 cases per 100,000 two weeks ago 122 cases per 100,000 yesterday. Last Sunday 16,000 new cases, would big improvement. 

Perhaps even impressively, least Hamburg, rained basically every day two weeks people seem like meeting outside. people meeting, likely indoors, yet cases still dropping, likely due vaccination programme picking pace. mentioned zoo Monday week really one giant reentry. 

There zoo plus actually going restaurant, getting haircut, walking packed fast food place going mall twice wanted pretzels.

Thank Pfizer Today someone (IRL) tell furious friends aren’t still staying home. reasoning vaccinated people still commonly get severely sick, spread virus, die; since many new variants vaccines don’t work against, acting “normal” anytime soon foolish.

TBH, came blue. CO, cases stayed mostly flat despite restrictions lifted. friends - even cautious ones - starting move on. Lord knows traffic back normal. (Maybe worse normal lol...)

The good thing is: think I’m moving beneficial ways too! severe OCD spent lot last year feeling suicidal due pandemic-related stress. kind conversation would sent spiral last year. Now, know fall back reputable studies I’ve read experiences, feel fine. Personal growth, woohoo. last time citizens want it. already helped saying ""no thanks I'd like go vaccineless"" haha. Look way: one neighbors figured really good incentive get folksy folks vaccinated. That's good. alcoholic, I’m sure feel this. poor grasp ""democracy"" functions countries victims coups prior legacies tyrannical leaders. first lockdown apparently severe economic consequences, severe government dare repeat it.

However, virus really care economy. Despite central government calling lockdowns, many states forced lockdown accord anyways, healthcare system overwhelmed. Turned choice ""take serious blow economy now"" ""take serious blow economy anyways additional millions deaths"". free choice actually understand choosing.

No comprehension, true freedom. Pretty simple really. toaster zero freedom. Minor correction: Wuhan lockdown unquestionably strictest. literally sealed people apartment complexes welding doors/gates shut brought military enforce it.

India probably one strictest lockdown national level nothing Wuhan lockdown. Using knowledge customer base better image.

It trashy nice time vaccination. I'm unsure blood harvest though. happens, might well science various effects multiple shots. People fcking stupid.

That became obvious pretty early pandemic. low intelligence.

Not trusting scientific process 400 years enlightenment telltale sign someone either poorly educated intelligent. somebody doesn’t care enough go get vaccine, recommendation CDC Biden Fauci isn’t going changes mind, something like money makes say hey, don’t really want vaccine, dammit I’ll beer

Different messages go different parts brain.

To according ability. EU still 3x smaller. EU takes 7-8 months open vaccination, administer rate, we'll take 2 fucking years open up. fucked us. 

As nation tried push limits, dick measuring terms absolute number doses administered. India largest manufacturer vaccines pre pandemic, shame due incompetency government take long get vaccinated. 

I get saying (presumably) outsider view, trust me, government fuck lot. expect health minister says parliament government interest vaccinating population, done vaccinating bare minimum. 

We would avoided crysis undergoing right government pushed quicker vaccination America given away vaccines Canada Mexico large volumes spouse's small workplace, 40+ shots, old enough teenagers. 

The 20-35 year olds gotten yet, getting sick. 

IMO, owners give small incentives get it. second AstraZeneca vaccine yesterday. Side effects mild. basically light headache comparable typical migraine headache persists day long. Pain injection site almost completely gone. first dose knocked though. haha smugness feels absolutely tactless consider people died India today government fed lies encouraged behaviour killing them.

But yeah, publicity good publicity USA USA USA india still billion plus need vaccinated. 

even competent government would struggle overcome significant milestone, let alone India's corrupt system.  China does

*Maybe*. EU count exports. started counting late countries, e.g. Israel. Real number probably much higher (that's graph says 200**+**). Imagine queuing around block something costs bucks...

I guess student I'd probably it. fact, unemployed I'd probably it.

OK, get it. None currently discovered variants problem vaccines far many epidemiologists agreed point variant appear escapes immunity enough.

I'd like see source virologists certainly agreement that. nothing magical mutations ensure they'll get dangerous. Well, check this:

[I Travel Remote Village remote village hidden mountains southwest China. hardly find another residential area remote one. paved roads, electricity, running water, even internet access. last decade, Chinese government done lot work build infrastructures places, last groups people living absolute poverty are. Sure, permanent damage done free beer. worth it. got take ambulance ER (which help broke)

A uniquely American story.  Donate give away much different export kind jump I’d surprised see us get behind politically practically time near future. good explanation also demonstrates *frustrating* still done would cost *nothing.* happens morons charge. Trump, Modi, Bolsonaro really pathetic Shots shots Aw man, hurt almost much meningitis B shots though Probably convenience.

but yea didnt follow Buffalo Bulls, looked wow dominate That's simply unfortunate. Also heard last time Liberals take bit due slow vaccine rollout. right here. whole difference US rollout Canada EU rollout. US large orders delivery Q1 Canada EU large deliveries Q2. Half AZ delivered Jan-Feb after, one unconfirmed, second means million doses since AZ deliver e.g. J&amp;J US shipped Leiden Europe 20+ million doses, bottled US. counted. BS. Honestly, holding back quite bit. know pages US blocked trying access europe.

*We recognize attempting access website country belonging European Economic Area (EEA) including EU enforces the* [*General Data Protection *(GDPR) therefore access cannot granted time.* It’s Buffalo, surprises here. know, mate, estimated 900000 Americans dead COVID seems pretty bad me.  jokes. stats show 18 65 year old Republican males likely get vaccinated. really happens could ever need people vaccinated fly countries. not. Defense Production Act still effect preventing private companies exporting freely global market. crucially vaccines actually distributed global supply chains raw materials thus slowing vaccine production around world. Serum Institute India one biggest global producers called disruption biggest challenge face produce vaccines. Curevac Novavax cited disruption raw materials market reason slow rollout anticipate lower production approved Europe. even stalled negotiations Novavax EU cannot ensure stable supply moment beyond already committed.

Lifting ban mean need give vaccines away free. would allow global market return normal function, companies buy sell goods need efficiently free market allows. India using capacity produce poke vaccines many people possible- India given 165 million vaccines already, problem population high still drop ocean. 

People compare ""per capita"" rates say India badly vaccination reality manufacturing 1 million vaccines takes amount time effort whether population 10 million 500 million. We're talking international travel. Every country right deny entry based condition see fit. 

The concern people proof vaccination required go buy groceries. very, very, low chance. things life zero. certain point might well asking ""I've got vasectomy gf/wife IUD, still wear condom prevent pregnancy?"". See: Patriot Act. talking about? nursing home policy huge controversy Cuomo. mentioned NY NJ post reason.

It’s good policy. Nursing homes required take people streets COVID, keep COVID-positive patients. caused completely preventable outbreaks among vulnerable population. logic prevent hospitals overwhelmed, never happened field hospitals quickly assembled. policy stayed place risk overwhelming hospitals subsided. Worst hangover life though  actually depressing. people putting community risk basically pretending reservations safety quickly released vaccine least reason behind it.

Changing minds couple beers proves ethical reservations, they're selfish scared needles.

I bet announced free vaccine period would end months cost would rise $100 would suddenly lot less anti-vaxxers there's talk ending vaccine passport program certain amount time metric hit. words, 80% population area vaccinated, business longer use passports. 

There's also talk passport can't used. example, want used grocery store things like sporting events concerts? worried Women hotel service seen hard times. many options there.  Australia too, except case even bother try move deliveries up. waited start March originally planned. editorialized title even close saying article actually stating. . 

“Public Health England sources say, increase may coming end, meaning may reflect rise travel rather significant community spread.

Two key factors favour - vaccines appear work well variant dominant virus circulating UK (although uptake Indian community little lower) plus still significant social distancing restrictions place help limit spread.” Barring premature death, elderly day would hope younger generations wouldnt abandon us. Dont abandon elder guys?. empathy. like us worn bodies. call 14 people caught covid didnt get seriously even though demographic risk. isnt evidence vaccines work dont know is.

Take antivax nonsense elsewhere. Israel free chulent given whoever vaccinated (in certain city majority charadi good incentive)  get fake vaccine passports live/work area never mandated masks first place. means expert, something personally wondered variants something concern regards virus, viruses simple understanding viruses mutate thus create variants.

Also, would imagine folks made vaccines would know potential variants would accounted choosing target vaccines 

Again, expert stretch imagination, maybe probably missing something important. look graphs new cases places experienced resurgences (like Michigan), see there's plenty time happen. Well masks wear cotton - know cloth masks aren’t good medical ones! waste gets me...

I got Pfizer. know nothing’s 100%...I’m anxious paranoid. workplace requiring guest-facing employees wear masks times guests. workplace isn’t requiring workers get vaccinated, think mask requirement mostly aren’t requiring employees get vaccinated might also brand reputation little bit, since people offices (not me) don’t wear masks don’t think people guests (me) to. One higher ups said work places start relax mask wearing likely will, too, employees. Like...why would require guests wear masks outside employees to?? Sounds like brand reputation me. Two face govt, one hand pleading foreign aid, hand given lipservice fighting virus nothing. honestly think trump re-elected would cases, deaths, fewer vaccinations? Same!!  Yep. Stimulus fuck vaccine. want people right thing? obviously pay masses so. many step beer image incentivized $$. I’m fully vaccinated incentive humanity large. brain obviously works like not. shopping mall belgrade decided give 50$ voucher anyone gets vaccine guess one day 1k people showed up. What’s wrong sub whole “iTs fEaR mOnGeRiNg” thing?

Like say, better prepare worse instead burying heads sands like early 2020.  ban traveling southeast asia, donate vaccines wanna talk playing statistics, start incorrect mortality statistic literally play cherry picking whose death think matters, throw nonsense fatphobic bullshit kicks.

Just say don’t understand contagion care anyone keep moving. Oh okay, even better! WTG 👏 Florida currently 3.6K hospitalizations average 66 covid deaths per day. worse many European countries. Luckily going steadily seems. governor opened state... ready export variants nation. Florida “we get tourist money get plague” state. hope so. two boys age 11 14 family get vaccinated soon government gives okay. Mortality Covid 0.3%. Take deaths people 75 age, Takeout people preexisting health conditions. Take fat obese people majority ICU. (these fat people 1000 times greatest health cost society).

Less supply, lower vaccination rate (vaccinated people % population). Europe deprioritized getting supply since wanted cheap, vaccination rates piss poor. Even ten seconds googling would’ve told this: end State Alarm invitation party, it? probably hits key demographic- I'd suspect alcoholics less likely social distance, HIGHLY motivated free alcohol. 

Honestly, wish ""let's put pandemic behind us"" rationale enough, theres certainly acceptable ways motivate people. pass another stimulus contingent vaccination status. Lucky all. seem anecdotal best. experiences others know had, side effects experienced/ experiencing. Mostly fever, headache fatigue day second shot pain injection site. Nothing changed since then. Found someone doesn’t kids think parents comfortable gambling kids lives. trajectory Manhattan specifically, vaccination rate nearing 70% adults, super encouraging. Positivity rate probably going hit time low week cases falling 40ish% w/w every day. comes despite socialization unquestionably highest pandemic.

It looks like Northeast states going hit 70+% adults, look really well positioned see regional cases continue plummet moving summer. think basically declare victory fellow Americans Northeast! EU even recieved 50 million doses faster expected Pfizer. recieved doses 6 months earlier expected.

Due Pfizer’s generosity, need US slowing down. claim less prioritized?

Because literally less prioritized, evidenced piss poor vaccination rates vs. US. Ten seconds google one thing possible once. turns out, factors younger.

And there's nothing condescending pointing differences access broadband internet services, reality months largely white populations driving communities would never previously visited snapped appointments vaccines online-only appointments.

We've vaccinated 400 Canadian truckers, governor announced we'll vaccinating 10,000 Canadian teachers think first Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont.

What would enough you? 32 shots? never? want permanent restrictions? [Here's New York's guidance Scroll last purposes document, minor defined individual age 18. Minors need parental guardian consent receive COVID-19 vaccine, except rare instance minor part group law gives right consent care (e.g., married minors, minors parents pregnant, minors military).  general, strongly encouraged parent legal guardian accompany minor age 16 17 provide in-person consent vaccination dose.

Providers may elect whether accept written statement consent parent guardian, parent guardian available phone provide consent vaccinate unaccompanied minor.** NYS COVID-19 Immunization Screening Consent Form may considered purpose.

Sounds like bring written consent and/or make sure parents available via telephone, fine! Why? vaccinated point choice it?

Why people got vaccine continue masking? protect ones didn't? Airlines I’ve seen certain medical centers prohibit well. 

I’m talking vented N95s. guess headed north south border soon. Decreases chances visitors spreading virus reopens borders faster. Definitely not. 80% cases among unvaccinated, indicating vaccine effectiveness around 84%. actually higher two vaccines trials showed, probably means vaccines preventing spread better infections. 

They tourist nation fully open borders. Cases can't go zero long people keep entering country. group wont get vaccinated, get big rona world gets back order Give regards mothers like man, finished unpacking lips. Pew pew pew Hey.

Ooh, spicy! follow Fox news commentators, ones got vaccinated? politicians. I'll add one. Good see scientists job.

They even proof read articles like anymore they? Well he’s quite hard Covid much worse, much wider spread disease we've encountered flu. clear I'm favor socially mandated (through workplaces shit) flu vaccines well. Also reach herd immunity there's pretty decent chance mutates evades vaccines more. selfish scum active threat deserve participate greater society normal people. good lockdown requires financial support enough claim victory COVID masses people end dying something else? Thank Connecticut! Yep downvoted anyone said otherwise really distancing measures people really behaving corona? live NYC too, mask compliance excellent neighborhood. I'm sort low-key traumatized I'm wary getting optimistic... 


I'm mostly replying say username, ah, \*cracked\* up. What’s difference mRNA vaccines Johnson Johnson vaccines, terms risk catastrophic side effects? 

The news reports referred happened someone took Pfizer Moderna vaccines. One Florida another Utah. gotten ton bad press angles. would surprised summer camp guidelines significantly relaxed next batch CDC guidance updates. mean much thing mutate turns itself? would think mutations regards 'spike' somewhat limited makes error genetic code can't work around? way base here?

Country wide 50% end July Yep. sub ""Listen science!"" comes vaccinations *scientists* say still need careful guard becomes ""Don't listen them! scientists need fired!"" makes 0 sense. practice R keeps dropping including past month one wears masks outside anymore (and wear properly inside well). currently 0.74, 10 days behind.

I considered optimistic like you, certain lifting mask mandate would big mistake. never imagined vaccines would work well really do. really better be, paying much child go College would require safe environment I’d curious would enforced. doubt every place check vaccine cards - there’s way tell otherwise who’s vaccinated. Cloth masks filter something. particular way take lot velocity away air, surely cause aerosols settle faster. vented mask (disclaimer: pretty much wear vented mask fully vaccinated) might actually accelerate air breathe out, spreading aerosols around more. Even sub-1000 injustice. 673 new cases latest daily report.  long term issues really concerning. wish would approve vaccine kids. Stresses kids can’t vaccinated yet. Fingers crossed!! also illegal spit public sidewalk Virginia, would result class 4 misdemeanor. But.. pretty established want turn western countries internally spreading misinformation. can't new you? anti-vax anti-mask movement that. could get CDC revise idiotic summer camp guidelines. Outdoor masking children 90 degree heat cruel unnecessary. I’d bust enough people vaccinated public health benefit making unvaccinated people wear masks outweighed value encouraging people get vaccinated. Reuters article corroborating entire Russian version history, word word.

Their government, nothing xenophobia, denied population access safe effective vaccine despite one worst affected countries world. think mean educational level can’t speak obviously, mass site western ny originally opened zip code nights weekends start. first shot 9pm Sunday March 7th follow day time slot.

That zip code first week special circumstances including BMI almost everyone qualifies for. March ended anyone original zip codes 16. mid April it’s open everyone 16+ running 18 ish hours day 7 days week. That’s remember spell state / yes taught way. Ugggh... One would assume mostly untested COVID deaths. IHME deaths model putting us around 900,000 total COVID deaths now. IHME dubious, I'm sure actually come accurate number here. Vaccine passports good. selfish enough get vaccine available condition would prevent getting one dont deserve participate society need survive like grocery trips similar. genuinely hope entertainment businesses start requiring proof vaccination. wanna concert filthy disease spreading pricks. want wear mask rest life that’s decision. longer keep mask mandates going eventually people start ignore it. mention it’s great way get people vaccinated. Get vaccinated yet still mask distance bar Brooklyn last night sat bar first time since last February

Wait what? thought going start may 17? crazies everywhere. ran outside today, 1h local pond (in MA, relatively near Boston). Roughly 80% unmasked, got funny looks mask 2-3 people. Especially 12+ range able get vaccinated hopefully week, I'm sure things open sooner. Massachusetts! Let's win this! Smell dry soap multiple times day. got smell back that. That’s wonderful!!! state Maryland could get board. would someone *too* careful terrify you? affect all. He's definitely paranoid give af wants careful, whatever floats boat long hurting anyone else. basic principles? Nature ≠ destiny morality. even premise ""nature"" implies selfishness time valid. Altruism evolutionary basis. I'll bet 100 bucks 50% fully end July.

4 months maximum min. AZ there’s pizza chain accepts pesos. currently asymptomatic covid. get vaccinated? comes anxiety like that, exactly rational, reassurance actually serve reinforce fear.  


You gently encourage gradually face scares facing lizard brain calms down. would probably benefit exposure therapy. Way go bashing New York. almost appears want good news city. criminal keep hospital pressure is, also longer 80 year olds hospital. We're 60% OMG... may opinion topic, try use sensible arguments... It’s demand. Connecticut’s vaccine rollout well organized got us fast start. asking curiosity. I'm trying get feel what's going elsewhere world. I'm Canada sure lockdown forever point. since October talking easing restrictions August.  Stay home you’re sicc, come you’re thicc One first fifty? Please report back second dose. Schools thing real impact, would criminal open schools. really cannot sacrificing children save 80 year olds. Vaccinations keeping up, risk massive outbreaks.  supposed worst working system get shot.

But sure symptoms, go it. makes sense people come campus aren’t students? Schools, shops, outdoor drinking (terras), field lab experiments.

Looking almost weekly test brothers kids getting, opening schools definitely bad move. Indian statistics fake.

At least 1 million people died Covid India, country path cross 10 million deaths. virus magically disappear instant hit 70% vaccinations. Calm give little time.

Connecticut's 7 day average still 500-ish. 500 new cases virus every day ""herd immunity."" number fall sharply soon continuing mask appropriate help speed fall along. cases fall almost nothing see restrictions lifted. kind measure indicates they're middle/where get stat (genuine question) drink year since nobody masks liquor store I'd pull mask sign person delivered unaffected, still, vaccine clinician told that. way know I'm planning drink long, long time. really makes irritated I'm fully vaccinated live area noone getting shot wearing mask. work retail wear day long interacting people refuse to. giant farce point. fucking great! everyone though, 35. resistant demographic white men 40. reason downvoted. pastor able ignore indoor mask mandate feels like it. probably meant “capacity,” lol. honest mistake. That's insane anyone believes that. nationwide lockdown happened yet?! government terrible. Merck. Tbh need  Depending long visit risk way covid. No- I’m even scheduled get first dose June- they’re extending length shots 4 months, so….yeah we’ll lucky people fully vaccinated end year. early end curfew early people this. done gradual removal measures this. Cancer patients risk daily diseases. Covid unique regard. start going flu season 10 years I’ll call selfish protecting them. Hunker forever love cancer arrogant anti masker! middling economic performance though. Reopening early didn’t actually yield better economic outcomes locking down. It’s hard know exactly take away doesn’t seem real benefit Florida approach net. Washington 49%. county 21%. 3rd education level.  Astrology bs correlation still exist. Haha that’s point. Vaccines clearly main factor get world eventually better place. optimism air palpable

There also pretty great deal pessimism given 0 impact re-opening plans currently 1.5 months behind every state entire country. Boston specifically planning opening summer. Chris Evan’s indeed nice ass Yeah that’s didn’t feel necessary specify 👍 richest man India, like 10th world astrologer consults every decision with.

Mukesh Ambani. Upvoted I’m sad nobody got satire. vaccination going Vietnam? article mentions 850k~ seems quite low large country  NJ. thing anymore large part country, that's smart, is. Original D614G mutation infectious viral titres G614 virus significantly higher (2.1- 8.6-fold) D614 virus (Fig. 3b)."" 

Other papers give range 3 9 fold higher infectiousness saw average 6X thrown around somewhere can't find now. let's call 6X now.

This baseline mutation original Wuhan strain new variants quantified against, D614G variant took world short order every single variant.

 P.1: est 1.7-2.4X infectious (than D614G), looking around 12X.
 

B.1.617: number known yet expert link says looks like looks like B.1.1.7 squared. B.1.1.7 60-80% transmissible D614G, 10X Wuhan, B.1.617 could easily 20X need nitpick exact numbers since tricky determine pretty certain B.1.1.7 10X bad Wuhan Indian variants seem overtaking could easily worse. People forget intermediate D614G step responsible early waves Spain, Italy, NYC, first variant truly take world, much much infectious Wuhan strain, benchmark people talk e.g. 2X increase new variants. Lol quite obviously got covid. Get test. I'm scientist like butt stuff. think symptoms develop like 3 days yes? mild fever chills right morning moderna vaccine shot presumably. felt like spreading arm way covid would incubate fast? Yes agree points.
Asi said elsewhere afraid masks restrictions permenent never ending fear what-ifs. Especially Canada 40% first shots everyone 2 shots July talking stay home order August. Toronto lockdown since October. 
So I'm tired point. That's way works. Yes, effective, whole population suddenly drop precautions terrible idea. We're far better easing restrictions, allows us keep eye numbers outbreaks. jump back normal tomorrow something goes wrong, we're back square one. know want that, I'll take slow reopening reopening.

(I know have) thought well, seems Kaiser reserving Pfizer second shots 16-17 year olds tried. I’m worried tries again, insist Moderna second time, he’ll unwilling try again. It’s delicate balance trying convince go.

It’s especially frustrating know Rite-Aid Walgreens giving Pfizer area, doesn’t want get pharmacy. number Covid deaths drops number flu deaths annually, that’s right? We’ll take annual Covid shot everything gets back normal right? agree. I've heard mixed things whether snowbirds included towards Florida's case/death statistics, would obviously make big difference. Can't find definitive source.  Thanks tips. promising! We're going home! Makes sense :) Late reply, wanted say congrats! time Mother's Day, too. Lovely news. Love going take public transport. Many people rely public transportation everyone avoiding worried would scale back years come. Sorry nothingbis mathematically impossible. Identical timeline/symptoms mine. No.they.don't.

Astrology pure pseudoscience doubt credentials claim otherwise. Wow it’s almost like virus real virus plan American government ruin election! legislation decided duh Sherlock. Isn’t US state Texas? I’ve legit people argue trying use pesos money buy something lol I’ve order comments. AZ would lose popularity countries would want Pfizer instead Personally I'm going keep wearing mask indoors while, even though I'm fully vaccinated, precaution. I'd hate everyone drop precautions suddenly see spike happen amongst unvaccinated people, whether choice condition, could slow reopening.

So longer wear outdoors, problem hanging vaccinated friends. still wear indoors carry sanitizer me. want careful we're certain back normal, I've long guess better safe sorry. jump back something goes wrong risk shutting again, I'd rather ease back making sure good mitigate risk. Blame whatever want. Cheapness, red tape, (most likely) both. US tons bureaucracy way - recognized ahead time, cutting red tape one explicit goals Operation Warp Speed. EU’s incompetence Americans celebrating unprecedented declines COVID deaths many European countries midst another wave COVID. structure entire society around accumulation wealth, don’t surprised people prioritize money people.

Why downvotes? answer spot on. haven’t cold since pandemic started, gotten COVID. Wearing mask big deal. I’m oppressed, it’s really inconvenient unless need sunglasses time, don’t smell anyones ass breath. 

And frankly people still driving need wear masks assholes refuse cause new cases. 70% Connecticut hit. Factor cases got well 80%. Unless missing something?
I concerned masks permanent thing now, places requiring masks indoors 70% vaccinated alleviate concern. formating something companies donating anything. Yes, definitely glad he’s willing general. frustrating he’d already vaccinated pause come week later, plenty availability can’t find particular requirements yet. He’s one four people know area least one shot, three seem gone full antivax. way? Disgusting good news don’t anything optional vaccines influenza. Sounds like good plan covid ask It’s pronounced Colonel it’s highest rank military. second chart speaks itself, Maybe notice, one ever determined flu deadly enough warrant community government action front. type realistic timeline ending restrictions tied vaccination rates.

No, doesn't. Community health restrictions continue based many people dying disease.

If community impact disease becomes flu like, we'll take flu like actions. Morning, angle.   must hating Modi much. scrolled comments filled 'Modi'. 

When blame everything one person, shows lack informative decision. agree Modi govt could handled situation much better going pay someday, factor current situation. 

I say wrong, suggesting blinded opinions broader perspective. all, cared enough India. That’s exactly right. Unfortunately, takes time steps 1 3. Nah that’s false equivalency international travel domestic health policy two entirely different things. countries point likely require vaccine proof travel non-citizens. Commission ordered Biontech next two years, yeah fine. logic lockdowns forever ability eradicate flu now. 

There type realistic timeline ending restrictions tied vaccination rates. CDC director needs lay pills comments. Can’t admit wrong losers practice isn't. Phoenix metro area, depending city fully back pre-Covid. masks anyone, distancing plexiglass down. cities still mask mandates, employees (like 80% time) wear patrons wear one walking around immediately take seated. I'm guessing red purple areas like end month. Thanks media it’s propensity cover stories based fear, outrage, controversy, etc. need lockdowns keep polio bay... kids get it, “when 70% globe vaccinated”. That's another problem entirely deal counties 

But agree need dealt local officials going CDCs head wanting people take precautions they've said longer needed bullying people around point  Make atleast 1770 per million. India heavily underreporting numbers. personally know many people could get tested &amp; passed away due low oxygen. Cremation reports local reporters already suggested Dude. easily scalable. WTF ""standard"" mean? Yes made long time mean easy make massive quantities. talking nanoparticles general, talking lipid nanoparticles mrna vaccine formulations. even check devices biontech talking about? Ffs seriously. Continue believe want. Fine. Totally normal. arm bled like elevator scene Shining, head popped shoulders busted ceiling clinic. nurse turned camera winked. Freeze frame, roll credits. lot people get vaccinated predominantly white states. People color effected epidemic disproportionally, institutional racism obvious new norm. Norm norm, always been.

Yep. 10 worried American owned Merck would prone Trumpian interference AZ got deal. export ban Trump duly brought vindicated decision; EU would even less product Merck vaccine. Full throttle MDW. Beginning End rescinding masking guidelines vaccinated people completely

The thing is...in many places effectively nothing. cautious county officials say ""well we'd like follow CDC guidelines, also can't implement vaccine passports therefore can't say does/doesn't need wear masks indoors...so we're going keep masks requirements everyone safe"" literally happened county *outdoor* mask mandates, case numbers right good. Breweries giving corona beer. Breweries beer. offensive tell breweries make corona beer. Yes, that's problem talked about. need set functioning network dozens suppliers deliver continously good quality. similar car factory. also need several months year set get running. Especially, use new process. I'm guessing they're called ""The New Normal."" Good them. That’s excellent community service. I’m Florida plenty places closed due covid. Maybe depends part Florida you’re in? Incentives matter. I’m real glad see politicians finally caught on. Masks required outside all. Restaurants works full capacity, football stadiums full capacity, hell finally got married last week 300 guests. Life Israel looks pretty much like right now. Hope it’ll last still social distancing required. 100% open mean ""full"" tables still 6 feet away other. comes next I’m currently day 3 sinus infection. Day 2 counting afternoon started feel come on. I’m already vaccinated first half Pfizer I’m due tomorrow second dose. I’m worried I’ll feel worse now. anything worry about? reschedule? feel like immense ass couch bound weekend. Nanoparticles also standared since around 2005. new thing nanoparticles used medicines, many people sceptical.

Ok, accept want see press releases companies.

Here big environmental NGO talking databank products nanoparticles reaching paints, detergents cosmetics bycicle parts fridges. dad said lady told believe masks Abbott walks Gee wonder numbers lower? Nope, Moorish sovereign citizen movement based Chicago black version buys self serving, BS “legal theories”. That’s vaccinate 12 people get there. speak badly J&amp;J since mRNA? *laughs Mothers Day brunch maple syrup* lot weird beliefs actually non-existent laws allow get everything taxes legal charges myriad ways. 

Which make fun time trying get follow kind rule regulation like Tell state ASAP found like, year, Dracula real person.  sort route goes Georgia Miami via Key West? I've eating restaurants past year never gotten sick. Sounds like good reason bring back Conch Republic. Bullshit Cali high IQ. literally tech engineers Don’t know got idea refuses therapy. There’s therapy available live right now. hearing facts *does* work her....which is, know, asked facts. obtainable bubble. Since way without Lockdowns, much appetite used get guys calling last workplace claiming “of Moorish descent” therefore exempt rules institution land. 🙄 suspect far away announcement. anecdotal evidence matter. case now, unjust brush science-based public health measures. coordinated response isolation cases, testing, contact-tracing, etc. could saved lot lives past year. Additionally, many people acted responsibly avoided getting sick spreading virus, following measures dramatically decreases one's risk. Dicks freedom  point, people need two shots 3-4 weeks apart, two weeks vaccine kick in. Let's call 5 weeks become effectively immune. 

I live area expanded eligibility everyone around 4/20, trying find shot early like trying buy concert tickets, pretty difficult frustrating.

In addition tough find vaccine within day two eligibility expansion, people shift workers issues caused trouble finding time slot works them. figure majority people wanted able get shot within two weeks 4/20.

So ton people able get first vaccine appointment 4/20-5/3 takes 5 weeks become immune, think June first would fair date start winding restrictions. Exactly. People really thick right now, want say it’s partly media’s fault. 

I’m definitely liberal, admit hyped clicks &amp; views. 

I get kid Tdap shot show proof 7th grade. meningitis shot college kids essential required. 

They need stop playing anti-vaxx hysteria ratings. Real news shit happening every damn day, cover instead. feel like we're cusp CDC rescinding masking guidelines vaccinated people completely Fauci kind telegraphing way conservative style messaging allows. 

Especially since CDC already inched forward direction revoking masking vaccinated people outdoors. cares? Move on.  Love it. We’re least week. Thrilled made pandemic! Damn that’s huge. AZ 42% (at least one dose) huge difference cares?  don’t think anybody considers locking pushing people poverty success.

What people don’t seem understand lockdowns intended eradicate virus. They’re meant keep healthcare system overwhelmed collapsing, unfortunately we’re now. Well didn’t work I'm sure everyone fully vaccinated, everyone wearing masks. Maybe totally understand article, headline basically saying 2 things essentially unrelated? Florida reported 10,000 variant cases entirety pandemic also surge overall cases spring break. headline would make one think 10,000 variant cases result spring break. eating restaurant see Dr. Fauci chowing crowded one. pfizer one week wait, least I've seen ""I vant inject blood!""

- Dracula probably Sovereign Citizen types special kind crazy even conservatives make fun of.  Pfizer wants deal governments private entities. said India changed approval process asked Pfizer reapply. 

They likely want orders numbers government place, likely want government take responsibility handling vaccines delivery.  Therapy. refuses hear logical explanation thoughts flawed, refuses therapy (I've using Better Help), there's much anyone her. Tiny state, rich fuck. Also water wet. article’s even Indian government *BLASTED* Koi nhi.

I think time stop blame game identify real enemy virus. can't get job done critizing govt, center state. People come together, fight virus win it. 

Once over, time held people accountable deeds. Truth Please restate you’re saying. read it. still idea argument is. Better zero cases?

I agree great but…… super easy fast get vaccinated got mine hartford Pratt Whitneys runway. got second shot lot cars first time went. Beside fact ridiculous restrictions, feel like they’re shooting foot lmao. can’t buy something dollar store, you’ll go Walmart. you’re going inside two stores around twice many people. Makes sense Exactly! heart breaks people like chefs customer service people work boiling hot kitchens deal general public global pandemic. Wearing mask Uber ride outdoor bar end world.

To 2nd point, completely agree. places even put significant restrictions place, let alone lock down! feel like people much faith modern medicine. I'm reading nonfiction book 1930's time period people dying left right ridiculous, modernly curable things. modern times, people seem think nearly every single thing cured even ""bad enough"" make seek medical help. Hi, autoimmune conditions inherent restriction clinical trial, individuals autoimmune conditions still part trials, still appeared safe effective! CDC says people autoimmune conditions receive COVID-19 vaccine unless there's another contraindication (like known allergy vaccine something). dozen (at least first world). accounts really scary ones. predominant language Britain? actually conversation partner yesterday. live NYC, everyone (at least neighborhood) incredible mask wearing keeping distance. Looking rest north east data that's come pandemic, ever move New York, see ever leaving north east. Shits kind wack elsewhere. even talking about? ignore question? Again, let’s start basics. little building blocks build from.

Basic obvious truth 1: EU done dog shit job getting people vaccinated vs. US. True False? Many 9 5 closed Sunday  Free taco Tacobell would probably work cheaper. Seems smart. Yes  pause didn’t stoke hesitancy, potential dying blood clots specifically adult population? I’m hopeful vaccinated people won’t required wear masks indoors within next weeks. Memorial Day seems like unofficial end. then, anyone initially wanted vaccine fully vaccinated (since vaccine open everyone 16+ April 19). 

Fauci also seems hint change coming ABC morning. person Biden admin also hinted change morning CNN. definitely seems like CDC drop bomb pretty soon state vaccinated people won’t wear masks indoors means need another lockdown summer june gain much. Bob baffert failed drug test I’m seeing less less people wear masks outside New Haven, even that’s gonna start go soon. Even people really scared covid restrictions.  pint pint, soul soul. Lucky! excited state get 70% mask mandate lifted! don’t mind wearing one teach group fitness masked great experience government interested saving lives wouldn’t allow things get bad. definitely consider win. live Chicago Florida difference far damage done local economies stark. many favorite little bars restaurants went Chicago, downtown ghost town, Florida pretty much business usual. teachers thing joke. Ship don’t make teacher dive many hours get shot.

Truckers anyways teachers not. Congrats first shot! That's exciting. That's horrifying. falsehoods spread Facebook something? got funky cold Moderna? Right, but... mean, Trump idiot.  wrong basically getting information mainstream media company press releases. massive amount resources put scale them, mean easier scale up. Correlation equal causation, reddit scientist knows that's day one stuff. shot drink beer bad. Dropping shot beer gets weird plenty articles around India like national media allowed speak out, easy find accurate measurement. find anecdotes several cities.

&amp;#x200B;

Only crematorium numbers give reasonable estimate. First all, easier scale traditional vaccines.

That's wrong. European facilities AZ monthly output 8-12 million doses per month. Yes, know, SII bigger plays league 70 million per month, Biontech, small firm pandemic, started February 68 million 83 million per month. Let guess, Modi voter? got text Friday believe CVS regarding walk availability. I’m getting #2 next week I’m set, it’s cool see. sure place it:

I German live DR. first shot Coronavac (you get one here) last week receive second shot May 31.

2022 move back Germany. guess booster shot needed. Probably Biontech.

My question: matter receive different vaccines? mixed start another vaccination routine whatever available Germany then? Think vaccines plus natural immunity. herd immunity yet, enough reduction susceptible population bring us towards containment combination distancing masks. 

We came close another spike B117 would bet vaccinations reason didn’t go like UK. There’s data Israel B117 spike vaccination drive see differences vaccinated non vaccinated populations. Personally, I'd call fourth, maybe thats :/ got mine Friday!  Hopefully second shot rollouts go much quicker, know started pharmacy vaccinations speed things along! mention even easy distribute, especially regions like India Africa Nobody could've seen coming. /s

Like 6 cases six million OMG!!!!!1!!111 operation sign paper saying 1 100,000 people DIED it!

I mean anti vax nutcases better wrap cocoon stay bed rest lives!  state 30% fully vaccinated. it’s hard imagine going get past 50%, let alone 70-80% needed herd immunity... Thank this. considered ""lazy"" option. might make yet. fully vaccinated 1 shot vaccinated?  Yea, think want believe going shortly vaccine here. unfortunate news everyone... Ah old Russia enemy narrative. like cold war never ended. search “covid-19 vaccine” google gives interactive graph Heh, imagine said ""one first 50 states"". know, good news doesn’t create anxiety lead clicks. “If bleeds leads” old saying… getting way better homerun pitch.... would probably consider win considering Florida lower end lockdowns Florida one oldest states wide margin do! Hopefully disappear summer. 

States covidiots may see another spike fall though unless vaccinations pick up. yay we’re top r/coronavirus Yeah, right. That's exactly going go, sadly. Like guys really need it. Send poor countries. Riiight. First all, easier scale traditional vaccines. wrong pure simple. least right now. Second, even future change face medicine, help pandemic now. made clear spike works antigen, regardless delivered. Data valneva others shown inactivated virus works well, even exactly match mrna ones (neither AZ JJ). trying learn something new emergency work people India, Africa etc? 70% adults vaccinated, population. video shows stats worst hit countries according excess mortality instead Covid-19 figure given country. Methodology explained video. Mortality data taken official mortality registers, Eurostat dashboard, Karlinsky &amp; Kobak World Mortality Dataset. Hmm hear ending? Oh yeah, one year ago cases dropping. know yet. things strongly hint limited potential scientists remain cautious predictions easy. someone outdoor wedding June, like massive weight lifted likely go online make appointment next day point. 

Just day fuss, crowds store anything. Connecticut news website going written local point view, international one Outstanding Connecticut! could mutate something worse, there's argument long term, less deadly mutations take hold. host can't pass virus sick dead.  common sense prevailed all. Otherwise Texas wasteland dead people Florida. Also Nicaragua, strange 80% less covid cases neighboring countries. I’m sure density population never wore mask, let people thought right. vaccinated point choice it?

That I'm already seeing sentiment, others internet social circles well, frustrating me.

No, that's true. I'm someone still fully vaccinated, medical reason it, hesitancy get it.

I've wanted get vaccine soon possibly could allowed - without trying circumvent process.

Connecticut opened vaccinations everyone 18+ April 1st, first time made eligible it. mean somehow immediately available everyone. signed vaccine appointment soon could day, earliest appointment VAMS system - system CT promoted source scheduling vaccinations - May 1st.

I frequently rechecked VAMS, well Yale, CVS, Walgreens, portals available area try find earlier appointments, unable find anything. called many places governor said going start rolling vaccines, never found opportunity earlier May 1st. way, great fucking job government creating enforcing unified platform vaccination scheduling. like whole year could predicted vaccinations going necessary.

I fortunate get 1st, clinic full people attempting get first vaccinations. means everything goes according plan, vaccination well peoples' vaccinations fully effective around June 12th.

I feel like things way explained us state government, got quickly common person situation would able - without qualifying early, working company somehow get jump line, getting extremely lucky, happening know somebody knows somebody.

Texas, like many U.S. states, doesn’t require residency Covid-19 vaccines. Unlike Mexico, vaccines go around, U.S. states offering incentives. New Jersey week announced “shot beer,” offering free drink participating brewery adults received first Thursday, New York City began promoting travel spot vaccine seekers. Florida officials announced April would rescind residency requirement put place initial surge vaccine tourism. Alaska, Gov. Mike Dunleavy said travelers could get free vaccines state’s major airports starting June 1, effort boost Texas state officials said foreigners account tiny fraction shots administered, travelers often list local address Mexico’s travel agencies, battered pandemic, quick spot opportunity. sold U.S. tourist packages March April 170,000 people, seeking vaccine, said Eduardo Paniagua, head industry association. U.S.-Mexican border closed nonessential ground traffic, travelers enter plane. Anyone wants get vaccinated today. waiting, appointment needed free.

I mean, disproven single confirmed anecdote. Eventually it'll happen. difficulty confirming time infection makes hard though. NEJM Seven deaths Covid-19 also recorded among vaccinated persons: five first dose two second dose.

Given doses separated 4 weeks 20% deaths occur 4 weeks infection, stretch think (measured time death; time infection known) infections prior vaccine protection.

Does strike anyone man science? Agreed organization director looked new director, fact found (happily) Redfield out. Considering amount times norovirus something run whole cruise ships, great records quarantine. letting people balconies time there, feasible fell upper floor lower cases. wonder would last longer, infection covid vaccination? think jury still I’m encouraged recent research 95% efficacy least 7 months post covid infection published shit! may seasonal factor, cases dropping almost everywhere states opening restrictions getting lifted explained vaccines. I'm talking china right revolution. that's communism, communism never exist. ok country communist? countries capitalist better terms corruption? America paid vaccines go countries too.

America tried buy vaccine exclusivity even vaccines. one example, one actually came public.

But would naive assume time tried, telling many ""behind closed door"" deals like went successfully through. probably important patents rn, especially coming Canada's POV Giving Vaccine probably easy part.

This head CDC onset COVID, longer head CDC. smart decision, agree certainly seems be, countries it? Pfizer wanted flexibility, strings attached warp speed basically meant FDA nose stuck lot normal. Pfizer wanted enough transparency make approval easy, much slow development.  Honestly doubt it’s due injection itself.

I inject estrogen 2x per week needles techniques used vaccinations. never wind muscle pain.

However, vaccinations sometimes get sore arm well. Nothing wrong it, means body launching response vaccine way it’s supposed to. they've already purchased vaccines companies too. contract. total, they've purchased way total population EU

As another comment pointed out, they've purchased enough every EU citizen get 10 doses. smells like corruption and/or incompetence me.

Life many risks. could get hit car, get mugged stabbed walk. ex could stalk kill sleep. can’t continue living fear. necessarily. That's usually shakes out, covid-19 100% mortality, still trait asymptomatic transmission 2 week incubation period, would still spread really easily. think fleshed plan. hope need 3 doses per year. makes sense actually need. 

Once new mutation shows takes time adjusted vaccine produced, always remaining ""old"" vaccine, help mutation. Copypasting comment important context: 

It looks like previous head CDC, Robert Redfield, appointed 2018 Trump, without fanfare longer director CDC Jan 2021.

I suspect people become much less cautious get vaccinated, resulting surge cases. Pfizer Moderna production specifically get ramped much possible, vaccines give us greater hope herd immunity. Sputnik V also seems highly effective based studies San Marino, shitty Russian diplomacy questionable production quality may ruined reputation. Whatever works.

At end day, correct. hope get back second Pfizer Moderna. It’s percent. fair, nearly million people died Covid US. Things really bad. Mine started five six hours shot, peaked around 12 hours. 100%. know already.  thing half vaccinated. vaccine isn’t puzzle. dose intervals stretched.  looks like previous head CDC, Robert Redfield, appointed 2018 Trump, without fanfare longer director CDC Jan 2021.

About Robert Redfield: 1980s Redfield worked closely W. Shepherd Smith, Jr. Christian organization, Americans Sound AIDS/HIV Policy, ASAP. group maintained AIDS “God’s judgment” homosexuals, spread America weakened single-parent households loss family wrote introduction 1990 book, “Christians Age AIDS,” co-written Smith, denounced distribution sterile needles drug users condoms sexually active adults, described anti-discrimination programs efforts “false prophets.”

Do forget individual. sadly, common sense isn’t common. weird read Murphy remove mask mandates restrictions couple months election November polling moving wrong direction favor restrictions. hard validate masks big chunk country including blue areas getting rid mask mandates lower similar vaccine rates evidence case surges. Mark words vaccine linger long body, immune system's memory. Plus they’re allowing us half vaccinated, unlike country manufacturers instructions. joke. state well. feel like push begin lowering take time folks getting vaccinated. pretty level 2 months well.  people need hear this. amount people think invincible post vaccine alarming. It’s still time hunker down/ Australia, tool code word dickhead two three papers this, one them: Yup shit article. Uses stats like 46 percent adults fully vaccinated ignoring fact 54 percent population received one dose. Ignores fact kids eligible next 2-3 months we’ll easily get another 5-10 percent kids. Ignores fact we’re still 15-20k first shots daily. Ignores fact groups lowest vaccine percent highest percent amongst cases probably 20-30 percent natural immunity. Classic doomerist bullshit. NJ.com trash blood clot risk still lower death debilitation virus. 

If get virus, yes. low chance getting virus depends age. think background Germany AZ recommended 60+ only. literally compared gdp per capita budget per capita completely differemt. states budget percentage total gdp apply budget capita. literally skipping crucial steps. Funny thing even that. problem 10x worse non capitalist places like communist China, NK. ""Think stupid average person is, realize half stupider that""

Ridiculously low risk Bc stupid remember people mass downvoted derided conspiracy theorists saying exact shit would happen last year? gave canada's share production Germany time kinda yeah Singapore checking in. numbers still far peak had, there’s definite spike cases Indian strain racing get control.

A cluster discovered one biggest hospitals snd entire hospital locked essentially taken offline till it’s staff patients cleared infection.

The strain demonstrated aggressively infectious potentially virulent well   need competent government bit less idiotic public /s

JK, good news. I'm sure far extended, company subcontracted Los Angeles County distribute vaccines, Carbon Health, that.

My mom also got one actual LADPH Healthvana, one else family has, know works, lol. group collecting data. contribute experience research. full SHIT!! It’s plummeting places vaccine available masks use blossoming areas isn’t, Florida highest hospital numbers right now, made 30 per cent generally agreed less five scale, **while also** showing falling level agreement time.

It's both. getting worse.  Even absence state, city, county mask mandates think private businesses going go back mask optional CDC gives clear.

That's experience, anyway. first mistake consulting WebMD. probably both. following daily cases MH regions country since feb, definitely seems contagious. I'm discounting terrible, criminal mistakes done government, religios gatherings means though. catastrophy collective effort covid movid CDC full crap! I'm glad person forget wearing mask work field normally requires masks. Lol Californians strange crowd Maybe people want leader life tend corrupt ones. It’s airborne, vaccines still work. I've annoyed last year assume vaccines work crowd.

Considering time last year 50-100 vaccines worked nothing particularly odd covid. inane default assume NONE would work. Yeah take bit getting used to. get together two, probably start feel better. It’s really nice feeling initial anxiety subsides, socialize again. asking solution problem already way solved.

Numbers plummeting. vaccine widely available. exactly trying accomplish point?

Living life never zero risk. surprised, people trying cope also nothing keep occupied tbh. definitely drank significantly 2020  no, really?  I’m glad stating obvious it’s obvious everyone apparently. UK barely slowed down, all. rate first doses administered dropped start April second doses start, [overall rate still available limited age groups (in England least), 40s becoming eligible week ago. Take-up first doses far 66.8% adults, something like 20% eligible yet, there's lot hope it'll end somewhere high 80s low 90% end vaccination campaign. ... exports important vaccine components key ingredients lab equipment, disrupting supply chains worldwide slowing production vaccines parts world.   ... loan Europe Gives sooo much hope. seen GF since October really like seeing progression % vaccinated time. NJ, notice everyone's wearing masks :| would herd immunity scenario

No, would supply. believe one second enough demand achieve enough immunity achieve heard immunity. expect unvaccinated population independently take appropriate measures prevent transmission within communities. data metrics indicate control virus?

Traceability, non-exportation, low test positivity rates.

When trace identify likely source infections act reduce future cases tied source.

Often identified source exported cases indicates there's significant uncontrolled community transmission.

Low test positivity indicates high degree public engagement, proves local authorities testing ahead cases becoming infectious, gives much better insight infection levels entire population. Stick tested protocol, anything else total unknown. Unlikely series events like losing phone. Yeah something extreme stretch 🙄  Excuse me, stop equating Indian government India. India victim, suffering crimes Indian government.  US doesn’t use defense protection act secure materials anymore? DPA maybe doesn’t reject exports, forces companies produce American uses first. prefer used finger?  regional mini Indias soon enough. one reading happening Covid mutations? many people ignorant? Yeah that's excuse too. US export controls vaccines supplies. Demand outstrips supply. 40 percent GOP doesn’t want get vaccine NEVER reach herd immunity enough people don’t get (they think 90% herd immunity) opposite terrifying situation may arise contagious, deadly mutations fight immunity. race getting many people vaccinated humanly possible slow mutations. passport urge people get vaccine. need socially “force” people get it. fears based nonsense misinformation. cannot allow it. Plague rats gonna plague.  Microchips arent micro feel bumb skin dog know Mid summer hit temperature rises people head inside air conditioning. Spring Fall lower cases since i's comfortable outside country. really hard tell current drop places springtime vaccine.

Most northern states flat last summer case numbers, southern states wave starting late June. precautions, lot people north able spend summer outside. cases started rise late October got cold out. Could related drug alcohol use? Florida place young people go specifically party  Really hard compare were/are probably undercounting cases etc.

But NYC population like 8.5M remember one point last April averaging 700+ deaths/day. India population 1.3B+ currently like 3700 deaths/day. numbers, NYC way worse per capita. True man. mean, even say. critisize people went kumbh, RWs say critisize muslims too, that. critisize people eid celebrations, LWs say critisize rhe hindus. 

People realise making attacks based religions. Covid bigger everyone's fucking religion, totally inconsiderate too. Covid secular, kills everyone equally. People understand simple thing. disappointing stopped/slowed delivery significantly months plant retrofitted

That EU interfering. Pfizer retooling facility increase output. Even EU impacted that. Still much higher death severe disease matters. “poor” countries plenty corrupt rich people forced pay bill. PA get another 24.1% population get 2nd dose, get rid mask mandate. Hes saying believes he's saying someone told

Apologizes realizing covishield AZ vaccine though. got warnings all. told wife ibuprofen, acetaminophen.

I think they’re making shit since IIRC Pfizer (what wife got) hasn’t said anything needing worry this. chills well. helped sleeping ton, staying hydrated lots pho! hope able get sleep knew wouldn’t *too* hard convince people. They’re using two different vaccines different efficacy. One them, Covishield, AstraZeneca vaccine good. know [100% preventing severe (eg hospitalisation) Covid. one Sinopharm. 

Given Seychelles used 60% Sinopharm 40% AstraZeneca, working backwards 84% average efficacy number, since know AstraZeneca 100%, think makes Sinopharm 73%.

Texas story. things don’t add up. mornings post FL going like India. see it'd unconstitutional. government broad authority spend basically however fuck sees fit, long violate limitation (e.g. government cannot allocate money quartering troops people's houses).

In essence different targeted tax break: it'd government financially incentivizing specific behavior wants see of. Imagine included Buffalo wings. Looking Bills performance last year, I’m sure you’re talking about.

Not mention Buffalo Bills rise college football basketball.

The Blue Jays count suppose. Yeah self respecting person Erie County getting 5G Corona. Labatt Moosehead. you’re afraid world *still extremely high* level immunity, nobody’s making go outside. You’ll never 100% safe, Covid anything else. could get hit car, stung bee, torn half escaped circus gorilla. highest currently attainable level immunity Covid isn’t good enough you, guess that’s tough beans.

That said, certainly don’t get call somebody else anti masker evidence strawman somebody easier argue evidence suggest are. rude you. Europe usually go high risk high reward. US easier defend everyone always jumps it. not? There’s vaccine skeptics countries, it’s US issue.

However, US farther ahead vaccine rollout, it’s also first see resistant remaining population is. hate people need given treats right thing makes sense. office waiting state country meets least min threshold completed vaccinations population. ... dont want blood!

None protests every protestor getting close physically possible every protestor moving several hours. 

The majority involved people marching one location another. 

Spectators games sitting next several hours moving get use bathroom get refreshments. 

These two activities same. it’s choice, people get covid, that’s them.

No. absolutely absurd ignorant statement completely ignores fact SPREAD PEOPLE. cannot understand someone still pretend make argument good also prepared say open everything now, initial reason restrictions overwhelm hospital system well prepared deal potential uptick hospitalizations.

PART reason reduce strain hospital system. Guess wait free house live NJ seeing insane comments FB posts this. can't believe pissed people getting it! past years really brought crazies lol work gives 4 hrs pto go get shot 8 hrs use whenever fact Yes, sad true. 

Hey congrats getting first shot! 👍 healthcare system “collapsed” though get idea healtcare systems health fact, that, UP, india's populous state.... thing relatives unwrap dead body receive hospital, check eyes kidneys havent stolen. like learned literally nothing last year all. would hate true natural instincts? denying basic principles life disappointed behaviors deriving them? butt chug [No, delivered 44 definitely catch spread vaccination. Definitely much lower chance, zero.  thats .041 lakh deaths, Also outlets post articles publications, without linking original article banned imo Many unfortunately brainwashed extremists claiming vaccine evil. comment likely lost, I'd gotten third shot known thing. brewery, Resurgence, amazingly good beers 10 minutes door. People asked Chile too, cases finally dropped. think Sinovac good vaccine, seem take longer work mRNA vaccines, latest research suggests 74% protection around 9 weeks, 14% first dose. author taken different approach like people involved certain jobs affected. data article also suggest people sector affected much some.
So title along line said above. Actually think AZ manage deliver 100M end June, already delivered 50M large deliveries Netherlands started. hit target, least come somewhat close. predict full 300M delivered late fall/early winter. guess covax least 150M doses. said thing…. Seriously lost faith Humanity May ""meaningful"" still cause necessary inflammation trigger immune response training? stupid prime minister worried image. first lockdown happened promoted strong man image, national lockdown right would show government failed job. Blood alcohol content goes less blood put alcohol in. No, bad January. healthy 30 something bed week. next week could barely focus anything.

I totally see people die it.

Also, infections, whole argument pointless, millions people died it. 

How keep pithy pointless comments current pace AZ probably take end 2022 deliver current order... think even 100M June bit unrealistic moment. ....they’ll fade irrelevancy? DPA block exports. free export reached requests. Isn’t exactly EU AZ? meet obligations export. relatively free flow materials things constrained. VDL said herself. it’s like hoarding materials. Hell, don’t even enough producers resorted fo reusing supposed single use items. sorry, novavax curevac, really? take supplies away actively produced vaccines divert ones still tested? beauty science: supposed stay away alcohol shot beer helps get vaccinated beer ok. almost twisted logic anti vaxxers. guess takes beers appreciate epidemiological soundness approach. ""We've found highly unusual correlation people received 40+ shots vaccine cirrhosis liver."" Bunch stupid hillbillies probably fast easily virus propagate population, much impact sufferers health systems.  viral diseases capability either vaccinated irrelevancy (i.e., smallpox, measles, etc) simply threatening (i.e., influenza -though get wrong, that's say flu cannot serious.) Happy mothers day folks! Let's kick covid ass today know colds flu airborne? studies point back idea up? That’s concerning. Cool! freedumbz! laugh, grandma exactly got county’s notification free shots Netherlands: half country stayed home today grandprix (S)pain Ajax Feyenoord.
But day four row new daily vaccination record (123k). Day four row less infected, day four row less hospital IC beds use. Ic finally comfortably 800. 66% ic beds occupied.
Its ten days since first reopening, ~160 carehomes infected (1 case 30 days), 20 percent peak February. Deaths going raise 23/day again. Hopefully soon minimum 17 day two weeks ago. Meanwhile, Quebec supposed set standard universal “free” healthcare, curfew since january (with fines 1500$ outside), restaurants closed, gyms closed, mask mandate, outside gatherings, limited access stores etc... it. Last day moving get together friends. recommended. He’s going IMPALE you....with first dose, come back three weeks so... guess question is: horrible things we're predicting happen vaccine passports (or like) inevitable? way respecting privacy safety? doomsday nightmare scenarios bound happen? Would helpful /u/Purple_Draws would clarify arguments mean. it’s infinitely likely someone eats another undercooked bat current virus mutating way changes spike protein point vaccines aren’t effective expert! say invitation? People still meet small groups seems certain % population acting like we're 70% vaccinated. Marca españa is. huge part societal response that.

The data doesn’t back paranoia. risk reduced MASSIVELY. people fail comprehend big twenty fold reduction risk is. It’s virus, moral agent strikes dare “not right things.” one best vaccines ever created, full stop. basically can’t get much protected virus this. You’re much protected Covid flu average flu shot, instance. risk severe issues basically zero. much time energy put worrying getting cold weekly basis pre-Covid?

Since beginning we’ve wanted easy set rituals gives us feeling control virus. thing ACTUALLY gives us control vaccine. Don’t get caught tribalism “whether we’re right thing collectively not” always people fail live that. There’s lot research demonstrates “blue people” tend massively overestimate risk vaccinated, “red people” tend underestimate risk general.

The masking difference longer significantly affecting protection virus *you vaccinated.* Florida also people 9 European countries posting articles? Cortisone treatment vital treating covid, drs chose give diabetic steroids imagine felt steroids less chance harming covid does. that's fallacies work... need prove negative logically impossible (from Book Bad Arguments): slippery slope7 attempts discredit proposition arguing acceptance undoubtedly lead sequence events, one undesirable. Though may case sequence events may happen, transition occurring probability, type argument assumes transitions inevitable, providing evidence support that. fallacy plays fears audience related number fallacies, appeal fear, false dilemma argument consequences.

For example, allow people uncontrolled access Internet. next thing know, frequenting pornographic websites and, soon enough entire moral fabric disintegrate reduced animals. glaringly clear, evidence given, unfounded conjecture, Internet access implies disintegration society's moral fabric, also presupposing certain things conduct.""

.... also curious, whole book really excellent, almost bought conspiracy theory mother law xmas thinking better lmao: JHU 7 day average. ya, JHU higher dailies Free beer pizza, real end covid Exporting vaccines countries necessary. India position like US stop exporting. 
And ""politicians"" hoarding concentrators,ventilators ambulances? Straight lies can't produce source Moon/Water thing say kidding. good scientific proof things already think know. Guess depends Exactly. dont get big deal boosters. Little kids get vaccine several times over, parents bring in. Booster shots going new process.

Maybe everyone get them, anyone got vaccine natural immunity immune system total newbie recognizing virus. 

There plenty cold causing viruses like RSV would really bad got first time elderly people. Covid likely like endemic. When? sign trend rate people vaccinated right isn’t going add additional 5% so. places ok much south live going get close. 

*edit* take back partly. still seeing sharp decrease cases, deaths following concerning eventually to. Still, don’t think going hit time low cases time soon.  I'm assuming Bharat producing capacity. Also, benefit multiple types vaccines reduces (though eliminate) chance bottlenecks production. Bharat inactivated virus, az/j&amp;j viral vector Bio e protein subunit. Lol, they're resorting bribing common man alcohol? bizarre reeks desperation. re-route north - Canada take hands. Define flawed dose? nothing “guarantee” therapeutics/medicine. Yeah would possible focus Indian vaccine production capacity towards Indian vaccine (Bharat). Would benefit production capacity prices? wouldn’t either Okay, let try lol want vaccine, easily get here. Easily. way awhile.

I wished states announce similar lockdowns too. 🙄

Edit - I'm talking Tamilnadu Yeah, quite unfortunate India produced exported quite disappointing amount vaccines considering population. fourth terms COVID-19 vaccine production third terms COVID-19 vaccine exports.

Honestly I'll take it, I'm happy things getting back normal. People probably doubled business train wreck company? It’s consistently going though. It’s stuck around 700 3 weeks.  Oh right, got cha.

What comment though?

The low mortality rate? deaths flat nearly month, around 700 day, like said elderly vaxed death dropped much it’s going unless significantly young people get vaxxed. Well, risk sounding dumb: sure point considered infection vs disease. thinking covid disease something persisted long infection (""long covid""), assumed vaccine may prevent initial cold symptoms would prevent longer term symptoms.

I'd upset too. large part population alternative. pew thing too, also thing past apparently. place masks required preschool, ""as close contact there"". next every. Other. Area. Yeah bay areas pretty well!  higher problem humanity whole healthy people getting vaccinated US UK refusing export vaccines at-risk people abroad get vaccinate rather vaccinate people burden hospitals that.  Yeah dad got yelled guy Friday similar way. gotten office building require masks guy said thing him. Free healthcare mean unlimited unfettered access.

There's many beds, nurses, doctors, etc. That's staying home for.

It's cost saving measure, prevent getting care.

It's system overwhelmed someone needs care turned away everything capacity. need retool bit. Massachusetts trying reach hesitant underserved communities shifting shots primary care providers, community clinics mobile pop ups. 

I know people never going get shot mass vax site, play games required score reservation early on, would get shot offered doctor. lmao law recently changed nicotine products (including cigarettes vapes) bought 18+. absolutely does, clickorlando??? 🤦🏻‍♂️ know downvoted. probably ok since masked up. Colleges requiring vaccines hardly new thing. news article TV station web site. Typical It’s CDC clue it’s - they’re jobs. point CDC concerned public health threats, real potential, advise people governments best course action would be. almost like worn masks, socially distanced, washed hands regularly instead crippling economy hardcore shutdown...

***ALMOST*** Yes, yesterday took 2nd dose moderna Hartford CT, expecting 900+ people yesterday may want wait 70% chance second jab Germany here: raise long lockdown November 2020...but seriousness. Good job Canada vaccination champagne recently. seem similar vaccination numbers really feels like turned corner week.

We get ;) docs called Vlad there. Remember, cold flu season coming long well. Plus possible variant concern may pop breaks eventually.

I'd recommend maintaining social distancing, wearing mask (N95 better since affordable again), washing hands 80% EtOh using regular foaming soap warm-to-hot water -- watch video surgeons wash arms hands follow guideline. 

When must press switches like elevator buttons use elbow instead fingers, bring pen use that. 

With services like UberEats, GrubHub, etc get high end restaurant food like Olive Garden comfort home.  really need rush this. Slow methodical stamp cases along continued vaccinations course.

The person replying say that. think concert opposite effect intending. whole crowd vaccinated still required wear masks incentivize people don’t want vaccine get vaccinated sends message “even vaccinated, nothing changes.” concert better preview post-pandemic world. Also need mass sites weekend evening shifts. Fantasstic* THANK already. told to. Massachusetts, Vermont, Hawaii. Cries Floridian.

Thank you! questions Israel drop social distancing rules mask mandates like Aus/NZ? They’re even better spot countries. neither! can't upset? two weeks past first vaccine pretty well protected, yes, pastor make decision, right.  left feedback Twitter show how/why update table? everyone brain knew would worth pause Florida 3rd nation per capita hospitalizations. matter slice it, Florida isn’t total disaster people thought would isn’t success story either. think truth Covid hard deal FL worse experience (and continue worse needed) approach. Yes, fully reopening capacity restrictions May 19. Masks still required think changing soon recommendation seeing numbers falling cliff.   hope Would cool resumption J&amp;J vaccine got 1/1000th media coverage pause Full capacity isn’t coming May 19th. Restaurants I’ve definitely half capacity You’re getting worked nothing. one said minorities can’t make appointment. said likely less fixed work schedules therefore less flexibility knowing time get vaccine. 

Another reason side effects. plenty people would get vaccine don’t can’t afford take day two off. We're 30%. agree you, think pastor making decision. Oxford's defence, time AZ *only* option maintain profit requirement. GSK went Sanofi. Don’t make waiver, sell cost. Keeps raw materials going used best, makes vaccines affordable majority, enables majority look can’t. politicians complicate everything. Make vaccines, distribute them. 1st state, 2nd, 3rd? Fasstastic!  know got downvoted. top comment says ""you cant catch spread it"". pointed that's true. There's opinionated claim here. What's issue? choose vaccine caught it

Quite frankly really don’t care know downvoted. Michigan Native here, going convince people get vaccinated? states 70% adult population vaccinated, every adult wants vaccine ample opportunity vaccinated, daily positive test rate 2%. states really reason indoor mask mandates continue.

Fantastic collection resources. Thank posting it. 1) article explains they're wrong. 2) sure that's relevant. 3) Again, strawman.  current total population vaccinated divided number vaccinated (which 80%) tells portion people vaccinated are.

So 30% total vaccinated 30/80 37.5% adults.

8%/80% 10%

60%/80% 75%

80%/80% 100%

Or prefer another way, multiply 1.25. That's nice offer, logistics moving many people probably practical. they're always dead last every positive metric True. Mich steep climb weeks, peaked since declining. bit startling, though, see quickly resurgence came - roughly three weeks [minimum exponential especially states extended decline.  

Hopefully enough folks gotten jab keep events getting control. suggestions J+J still available? free pot would too. maybe even better. true live that's place matters That's thing many politicians acknowledging. Opening paper really anything. Supply chains still fucked up, people basing behavior numbers ""my god AMC open pandemic over"", enough low skill workforce going work really need money even they'd like money. tour numbers could bring vaccine-hesitant tent.

I’m sure that. 102 degree fever day last April, followed kidney problems pain urinating tested negative STIs/UTIs, followed heart palpitations I’ve never truly recovered from. tested negative drive thru test site I’ve told may tested early didn’t administer test correctly. can’t prove it’s COVID really weird. reaction first shot either.

However, trend similar countries (sloping downwards). Fingers crossed worst behind everyone countries! don’t agree. Transmission virus already low begin outdoors, I’m fully vaccinated I’m highly unlikely carrying virus first place, chance carrying it, highly unlikely transmit someone else due much lower viral load. somehow happens, odds still highly favor they’ll fine disease serious often. level risk bothers someone, probably stay inside forever life lots risks. maybe get vaccinated “can’t” catch either. Either way that’s them. evidence capitalism makes worse? home variant COVID-19 cases country.

Doctors might headline misleading. numbers sunk week week around 18-20%, line accelerating pace vaccination current batch restrictions beginning work. evidence delayed side effects? stats don’t lie. people fine; don’t even realize it. outlier indicative trend. That’s way life works. Glad you’re still us, friend. Good avoid fear-trap. fair, person likely suffering crippling fear/anxiety coloring attitude. Using phrases like ""vaccinated people commonly get severely sick"" shows science based attitude, projection fears outward.

Still, frustrating try move beyond pandemic feel like others trying dig claws drag back murk persistent panic that's at. think so. using Chinese vaccine high efficacy.  Good. They've made rollout frustrating Ireland. I’ll also repeat said another comment thread.

What's silly act assured right can't possibly know, take much time energy shoot suggesting *possibility* scientifically cannot yet ruled out. retraction, consider else sars2 could end inside cd4 cells without spike-mediated fusion, let know think something Traveling makes sense certain contexts ; vaccine passports attend baseball game seems overly restrictive.

The people say masks ones say won’t vax.

Also, herd immunity, vaccinated population, shit doesn’t mean 20-30% “don’t want vax” entitled so. Unvaccinated people vector virus incubator mutations. choosing vaccinate, regardless reasoning, becoming chance vaccine resistant strain make hard work rest us moot.

Others feel duty proactive try save many lives possible. truth federalist system government, get past emergency stage pandemic largely becomes public health issue hands individual state resolve. editor who’s laid past, kind “passed spellcheck” error present future, editors getting axe like never before. First copy editors, responsible making sure weren’t typos style errors, section editors, manage reporters make sure contextual errors don’t happen, along many things. News doomed sloppiness algorithms behind software “Grammarly” good enough replace human editing. There’s enough money support professional staffs anymore. Internet made everyone expect free content, sites lowest staff costs charge least ads, that’s ad money went. barrier entry used printing press, competition eyeballs less significant. barrier internet connection, almost everyone has. covid you’re still expelling valve. Even cheap masks better one valves.  Glad music ears, certain would? lockdown ""skeptic"" brigaders use ""restrictions forever"" bad-faith strawman. repeat lot, never true.  South Korea. Yeah, am. legitimate proof saying otherwise? making assumptions reputable reporters reported major outbreaks deaths due farmers protest sites definitely read kumbh Mela government rallies bring major super spreader events. Honestly, whatever takes. bet gave everyone crisp $100 bill got shot almost everyone would vaccinated would small price pay.  Telling people wear masks March 2020 definitely bigger fumble Yes, right, reason behind decision giving AZ anyone wants infuriating.
A large number Boomer generation Germany rejects AZ vaccine instead wants get BioNtech/Pfizer Moderna.
So AZ doses piling boomers incompetent interest solidarity younger generations. Jealous. state broke 25% see getting higher 50%. Source back claim still there. one works Sundays. Good gosh, people you’re hanging with? Probably not, vaccines provide immune response almost everybody, half people significant side effects  think (not anyway) forget first variant transmissible. seem misinterpreting original study start. increase infectious titres equivalent variant directly many times transmissible. 2 separate things altogether, first study posted even notes ""increased replication (infectiousness) MAY increase transmission"". suppose would common misunderstanding actually said, mistakes happen. also vitro, even mentioned previous comment, vitro always show real world examples variety reasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

You read study learn increase infectiousness (titres) necessarily equate increase transmissibility. Remember, terms we're discussing, infectivity transmissibility 2 separate things. Study: zero evidence 20X increase transmissibility current leading variant original strain. assumed degree increased transmission (several articles lots numbers modeled out) based increased infectiousness (virus' ability spread/establish infection within body). Ask visit doctor refuses respect decision. try diagnose reddit knowledge There's lot could say for, really think one them. ""one 1st"" real big brain nonsense phrase Yes, even immunocompromised. That’s likely editor. days editors considered expendable fat news organizations. industry relying spellcheck, interns reporters screen copy. even leaving page designers. Part reason don’t buy “they won’t vaccinate wear masks, oh well, screw them” mentality. might kids could seriously affected well. need reduce spread virus. Make sure mask distance, especially campus buildings classes full capacity. Sad Kentucky noises. major outbreaks reported protest sites. protests sites site vaccinations farmers. Weird blame protest literally mismanagement government caused millions people lose lives. Kumbh Mela also huge contributor. True, fair lot factors affect immune system strength - sleep huge one example. would nice idea maybe distribute pamphlets information sheets along vaccine. Even vaccine made, information would good know. many people drank usual messed sleep schedules lockdowns - increase risk disease exposed. 400,000 India alone.

Many spreading lies Facebook strut front every camera find. watch news take notes... Another dumpster fire headline:

 [Florida reports 10,000 COVID-19 variant cases, surge spring break - ABC News 

So first glance, casual reader could easily interpret FL absolute explosion COVID. 10k cases day? Variants overwhelming everything? Seems like case first blush. read, mentions total number variant cases seen course pandemic. down, almost sheepishly, confesses COVID cases declining state.

I'm exhausted little wordplay gimmicks pulling. Exactly. mixed reaction saw headline. one hand think great we're sharing excess people Canada need it, hand frustrated excess supply there's still large amount people gotten it. Recently, saw deal would give free drink vouchers got vaccinated event, know much North Dakotans like binge drink, maybe motivate us. think mostly motivate slackers would get vaccinated super lazy motivation get shot. belgian experts virus claim prove models. 
But yeah, Politicians want vote want big festivals august indoor parties july. Yes, telling Poland Ukraine got identical huge peak due B117 variant, hint Russia.

All numbers invented intern Kremlin. unit Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co. agreed establish joint venture BioNTech SE local production commercialization Covid-19 Fosun Pharmaceutical Industry Development invest much $100 million partnership including cash, according statement Shanghai Stock Exchange.

MORONS! prefer plague enthusiasts... Sir Stalin 🙏🏻 Deaths lagging indicator. past month saw surges Michigan couple states. surges over, next weeks deaths start falling well (look much cases falling recently can’t expect death drops follow cases drops time)   Americans bitchier.  mean faculty staff, mandates agreed upon consulting respective academic councils unions. far invited ""guests"" like opposing sports teams symposium speakers workshop attendees they'll probably require proof vaccination recent negative covid test enter campus buildings. suspect public venues like university galleries, museums &amp; libraries open public next year give colleges period see case rates particular area. states may see minimal covid activity winter they'll fully re-open public sooner. Kids likely get sick school lunch COVID NC vaccination goal set end mask mandate. 
 
The problem people refuse get vaccinated ones ignore mask mandate social distancing guidelines. Well like people live North Dakota want them. Risks never equal. That’s everyone different insurance premium. got first shot 2 hours ago. Let tell you, amount people trying talk insane! ""The ICUs full people vaccine!"" ""They telling everything happens vaccine!"" 

I stayed course. far good, 5G reception got better too. real quote? like Hillary fine enough don’t like quote. Everyone suffers. Except rich. Fucking shoes man. Fuck things. hinder freedom. young (18) completely healthy person beyond surprised gotten sore arm first one

and second one sore arm feeling pretty tired day Good, would even consider donating incoming deliveries Covax focus mRNA immediate effect. Might slow vaccination process short term may reduce vaccination hesitancy longer term. Besides, may another mRNA vaccine Curevac weeks. countries doesn’t that, least know risk low, know look terms side effects.

Eh, right, Germany example giving AstraZeneca anyone wants get vaccinated immediately, boomer generation wants good stuff rejects AstraZeneca.

I 20 year old male decide now: Either get vaccinated AstraZeneca wait minimum 1 month get BioNtech/Pfizer Moderna.

This situation sucks, think take vaccine AstraZeneca. know talking about, took ibuprofen shot, hours afterwards anyways. say take shot makes sense shouldn't, wait 5 hours shot fine. took felt symptoms, pretake it.   pamphlet Walgreens recommends NSAIDS side effect relief.   usually anywhere day half 3 days part. That's timeline picked people. side effect response due immune response developing virus, case spike protein create antibodies. However people say feel side effects whatsoever, I'm wondering means immunity would poor immune response? know lot older people side effects, lot younger people around age side effects?  Thanks tip sub, completely missed it.

I’ll stop coming here. sub seems pro-vaccine overall, indicative conspiracy-driven community. Good. won’t allow discussion around fact virus may mutate? it’s fear mongering? shouldn’t sPoOk yOuTh telling careful still ongoing? They’ll downvote en masse use ad hominem say remain cautious. Weird.

I’m done. fucking wish FOX would emphasize vaccination more, fine methods propaganda spreading. God, make pin goes open carry gun proclaiming vaccinated superior super powers.   guys come home PTSD missing limbs easy. /s required schools, colleges, airplanes, trains, ships, theme parks, bars, hotels, restaurants etc. Hello someone explain almost 500,000 pneumonia deaths within United States, that's 36 years combined almost? link sex age deaths different columns one covid, pneumonia, multiple combination columns. 

The columns combine covid pneumonia equal separate columns covid pneumonia, column end table includes flu, pneumonia, covid? 

I guess tabulations off, many deaths attributed pneumonia past 36 years combined almost? Thank sorry asked reposted, tried searching similar discussions before, yet came Ehhh prefer way less anti-vaxxers anti-maskers here. We’ll pass long run lower chance creating terrible variant. Maybe need wait infections start going down. hope world far behind It’s selfishness mixed arrogance. people think “did research” smarter experts. huge swath American public think “opinion” valid experts “opinion”. get one quack Dr researcher goes experts people grasp onto say, see told you, Harvard Dr says vaccines dangerous. 

When point every expert disagrees probably wrong don’t want hear it. experts saying bring R0 1 exactly # (55%) people need vaccinated? tfw Mongolia get vaccines literal nomadic goat herders rednecks America still going ""Imma wait see"" love CT even there's large population people genuinely give fuck think stupid wear mask want get vaccinated ""they already covid bad, vaccine could effects know about"". dumbass friend fucking pharmacist want vaccine exact reason. blame older generation Developed BioNTech based mRNA research Drew Weissman Katalin Kariko Unniversity Pennsylvania funded research grants US g government.

Just BioNTech licensed technology UoP mean everything BioNTech extension invention UoP. Due nature cutting-edge research BioNTech does, licensed whole lot different tech whole lot different places.

If simple UoP research, nothing would stopped Pfizer everything own, want explain that? BioNTech involved all, [all US companies, inventions, actual successful candidate funded Pfizer tune 100%.

Again: That's works, candidates selected properties, funding. narrow funding far say ""This particular batch exists Pfizer"" experimental vaccine development. quickly side effects come you?

I exact thing second Pfizer dose Friday afternoon 2. 2:30 entire upper body injection side sore. 4 feeling feverish. Felt like shit day Saturday, woke morning feeling like million bucks, arm even sore. I'm sure glad swapped Saturday shift today. wanna see Batzorig Vaanchig sing live ✌🏻 don’t understand virus. virus experts still recommending precautions. Thankfully people like don’t set policy. Again, read carefully, said still go things see people. immunity 2024? free samples today. (WA State) trays full usual, looks like handing one time. take though. mother immunocompromised. took many precautions much. can't suddenly seal fucking eternity. I'm seriously worried mental health point, piece shits like help. Listen, I'm saying vaccinated need worry. worry 95% less, (at least) . supposed ""card"" everyone going close contact with? can't get vaccine medical reasons weigh what's important you. worried continue take every precaution necessary.

And anti-vaxxers find fake ""medical reason"" well. Bottom line, can't get vaccine, treat every stranger also it. Around 80 percent people Seychelles recently infected COVID-19 vaccinated, top official said Saturday.

Assuming homogeneity (note: terrible assumption) [61% population fully means 39% account 80% remaining 61% account 20%. Unless bungle math, gives 6.26:1 risk ratio unvaccinated:vaccinated therefore **84% vaccine efficacy**. Seychelles using essentially worst vaccines have, still working *extremely* well. Neither bad me. arm soreness much worse second shot otherwise zero side effects. truly depends person.   No, probably not. Long covid serious symptom   Almost certainly yes. words, full shit. Got it. Lol no, lot conservatives, even parents thinks colleges turn ppl marxists… necessarily antivaxxers seems doesn’t specific side sticks messaging awful. may create vaccine hesitancy.  continue think way Canada never fully reopen ever Thanos approve Whatever works. simple ones dangerous ones. Vaccinate all. free look up. Use words like big boy.  really hope big push improve ventilation systems schools businesses. confusing gdp divided capita equal budget divided capita. completely different. country taxes 100% gdp.  Capitalism. structure entire society around accumulation wealth, don’t surprised people prioritize money people. That’s interesting take. think conservatives irrational desire “freedom” distrust govt (because they’ve tricked rich people vote best interests that’s another conversation).

We banded together 9/11 even though didn’t turn well (despite killing Bin Laden repeats attack scale). want ***layover passengers*** get plane, quarantine, resume trip home? get Turkey entering Turkey must negative Covid test within 72 hours. also must negative PCR test leave country. ***Foreign tourists are, however, exempt Turkey's current lockdown rules.*** Yeah, I've heard multiple businesses, they're surveying employees get sense landing stated. Calling jab funky fresh home dog now, ""robots"", making people unintelligent. actually ""Bill Gate's Satan Infused Nano-Tech"". :)  South interior West never reach herd immunity. New variants could potentially dodge vaccines could develop there. surprised. Fertility inversely correlated secularism, intelligence, education, income. I’m sure simple.
