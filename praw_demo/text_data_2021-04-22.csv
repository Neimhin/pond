International Space Station? Assuming still all. Please refer clickbait trash sites like buzzfeed.... Biden Fauci take notes jesus Close India received second dose week ago, found buddy mine lunch two days ago (unvaccinated turns out) tested positive.

What banning Indian passports Well yeah quite private universities already requiring fully vaccinated every school country requires fully vaccinated normal vaccines regardless attending school COVID-19 another list vaccines required attend university makes perfect sense. We‚Äôve got deadly virus vaccine works course you‚Äôre going require students get vaccinated don‚Äôt entire camp going lock people want get back normal lives vaccine easiest safest way gives people immunity virus.

&amp;#x200B;

It‚Äôs logical step  FDA fact sheet Pfizer vaccine, dose 0.3 ml diluted 1.8 ml ""0.9% sodium chloride injection"". Perhaps people administering vaccine prison dilution step.

Starts bottom page 3: Yes messaging utterly sucked. Complete opposite done. Credit American People actually getting 52% vaxxed support / incentivization Biden admin fauci such. They're still preaching double masking instead hey lets get everyone vaxxed ASAP, vaxxed theres need masking. anti maskers/vaxxers already wearing masks following visitation guidelines anyways. Give people followed advice reward getting vaxxed.  Yeah lol EU shitting AZ probably made popular lmao It‚Äôs funny low figures hits family. 
But die one day no? What‚Äôs fuss 5-10-30 years missed time loved one.

Even 70% population wants booster that's much ask pharmacies even split 6 months  I‚Äôm really sorry you‚Äôre going hope get vaccinated soon.

Be strong, you‚Äôve got this! frustrated many people never changed anything stop spread covid also refusing vaccine, rest us dealt consequences. traveling attending certain events require proof ‚Äúfull vaccination‚Äù you‚Äôre considered fully vaccinated 2 weeks Johnson Johnson shot. mRNA ones, it‚Äôs two weeks second shot, 5-6 weeks first.

So...why ""?"" Tuberculosis 27.3% mortality rate India, comprable covid-19 whatsoever. many doses administered? closing 200 million vaccinated 308,745,538.  28% country age 18. pretty good. Lmao totally agree first statement, think we‚Äôll reach higher levels vaccination Canada US.

Obviously US head start due vaccine procurement first. think population overall receptive vaccinations. Although loud minority spout anti vaccine nonsense. mother one üôÉ  Vegan TST member. took J&amp;J religious purposes. 70% entire population, adults. got first dose. know lot talk slack demand say anecdotally pharmacy NJ went busy steady stream people coming get vaccinated. 

Lots people referencing first dose too. I'm hoping catch many college students possible get vaxxed summer break. I'd love see mobile sites set around college campuses. PLEASE, PLEASE DELETE THIS!

Realistically, don‚Äôt think we‚Äôd see number people lining booster shots. Outside elderly, people underlying health conditions, people working healthcare/education/with public higher risk job, don‚Äôt think people go it. masks summer
I bet...well airports probably find bizarre complaint. Commercials stores much ""normalising"" mask use, mask use already normalised marketing companies rushing make marketable products. 

They putting masks ads unless polls focus groups already told would get better reception viewers get buy products.

Well Im tad sore arm 1st shot. Feeling lil tired achy alot today (grocery shopping cleaning fridge) got Pfizer. However sister lives state Moderna 2nd shot gave full body myalgias (pain) Bayer back &amp; Body helped fine. dad 69 aide effects Moderna all. good health medications all. Im okay intermittent boosters keep protected. Holy shit, going wild monitor. quit January 2020, guess go back now.         /s Indian hindu festivals like Kumbh Mela large election rallies BJP party parties spread virus widely.

Also may appeal groups like Polish church doesn‚Äôt stem cell tech AZ shot due that. Better seal away forever pal. like odds take chances. Okay, let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre vaccinated COVID reduced cold.

Why would still need restrictions cold? Higher chance slipping shower braining toilet tomorrow. got theJ &amp; J first came out. I‚Äôm prone blood clots take aspirin maybe helped. Still, seems rare. sitting world leader used insult yet?

Could anyone speculate Johnson &amp; Johnson might available United States again?  u/FalalaLlamas notes immunoglobulin treatment recommended. treatment commonly suppresses inflammatory effects natural immune response. may case vaccine clot side effect body reacting low platelet count (producing clotting agents). IVIg would reduce reaction.

Administering Heparin prevents clotting (and would normal treatment clots) could cause body increase response causing clots. 

As others noted, side effect requires almost opposite treatment normal procedure one would choose faced CVST (which rare). Don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre downvoted, makes perfect sense. 

Modi isn‚Äôt taking virus seriously, rest world shouldn‚Äôt pay price Indian variant spreading countries. goes bolsonaro Brazil variant variants. lot confusion adenovirus vectors, media continually reports adenovirus vectors traditional.

They traditional almost definition. first adenovirus vaccine -- ebola, made Johnson Johnson -- approved last year. given people.

Adenovirus vector vaccines revolutionary mRNA vaccines. brand new unrelated type past vaccine.

Vaccines past based either:

* Attenuated viruses type target

* Live viruses type target

* Less-risky related viruses, like cowpox smallpox

But basically causative agent, closely related one.

Viral vector vaccines different, much similar mRNA vaccines. carrier virus, say adenovirus, generally causes mild cold, genetically engineered include gene protein target virus. case Johnson Johnson's adenovirus vaccine Covid, encodes gene Covid's spike protein, like mRNA vaccines. adenovirus modified prevent replicating itself.

The adenovirus infects cells, causing pump Covid spike proteins, like mRNA vaccines.

Like mRNA vaccines, adenovirus vectors researched testing decades, past years, hurdles prevented used, J&amp;J's Covid vaccine second ever approved humans, first last year, given thousand people. moments. Here's issue: domestic production vaccines like US has. import (we're even pulling COVAX, crying loud) frustrating ride seems like every week deliveries get slashed.

I got first dose Moderna week half ago maddening seeing headline shipments cut. ... you‚Äôre still pretty unlucky got covid. It‚Äôs like half people planet contracted it. I‚Äôll take chances wear mask. feel people tend grasp situation looking numbers.

I'm director Big 4 firm. wife's doctor. probably top 5% India income. unable find ICU bed uncle whose SPO2 level dropped 81. managed buy oxygenerator trying manage situation home. word ""shot"" need inserted every American headline? could left word vaccine substituted clear. supposed go last year.

Fingers crossed!!! 
Although biggest problem CureVac mass production since don‚Äôt big pharma partner ... Thank you, I‚Äôm sorry loss. truly horrible. Pretty standard universities...it went ‚Äò07-‚Äò11.... dunning-kruger syndrome dangerous. go on, propogate bullshit vaccines cause autism maybe let kid catch preventable disease reason fact mother imbecile.  lot universities already campus vaccinations, I'm guessing common place fall we'll swimming vaccines. Jeez, first question: predicted peak would 180,000/day. 15 days later, 350,000/day. happened?

A clear, nonsense question. Karan Thapar necessary evil. I'm sure 100s people immediately recognize report potentially embarrassing symptoms immediately really good evidence everything copacetic. They're still going recall newsom matter much media tries spin it. done streets walkways lol. look age group affected. Covid-19 fatalities almost exclusively among older population, blood clot issue opposite. AstraZeneca paused Denmark 4 cases blood clots 2 died 140.000 administered doses. 7 people age 40 die Covid-19 13 months, AstraZeneca out, vaccine program delayed 3 weeks. decided add weeks re-vaccination Pfizer Moderna, first shot vaccination program delayed 2 weeks. still low infection numbers, additional deaths anyone 40 2 weeks unlikely.

Of course situation completely different countries. take Brazil high infection rate maybe mutation dangerous younger people, danger dying getting seriously ill Covid-19 likely far outweigh blood clot issue. Mother god. nice knowing you, India you, wise ways California like? I‚Äôm also mechanics could different today before. HIPAA doesn‚Äôt usually apply schools universities ‚Äúcovered entities‚Äù like hospitals, doctor‚Äôs offices, etc. Nexus got back home (living Germany now) x-mas border agents checking everybody thouroughly, including flight history. Ah shit Unheard whole virus, protein subunit vaccine, sure. mRNA vaccine, ever tried humans before? Lol undercounted what? Where‚Äôs source actual risk significantly higher currently know?

Young not, chances dying covid much higher AZ vaccine. Hell chances developing blood clots higher covid. 

And that‚Äôs short sighted way look things. Even covid low risk you, spread somebody who‚Äôs higher risk. never contracting covid yourself. You‚Äôre going spreading blot clots people got AZ vaccine. vaccine prevent spread virus? BEGAN 2 weeks ago. IIRC ran around 10 days, approx. 2 million people visiting day.

Fuck. always, Trudeau waiting house fire bring bucket water. done long time ago, especially news articles seen recent past flights coming lot positive cases Sad times live in. Stay safe bro‚úäüèΩ make vaccine federally mandatory then? Today first day vaccine intake drops 3 million day. i‚Äôm waiting üôÇ Well one infected vaccinated Covid patients developed symptoms, unfortunately resident pass away. fact vaccinated individuals caught Covid didn‚Äôt really get sick still positive sign. Canadian, make sure remember helped us over. It‚Äôs EU continue largely EU going forward well. I‚Äôm mid-30s U.K. due get AZ Tuesday. Hope decide soon... current rate vaccination, country it‚Äôll least 5 years till get jab. one available rn AZ. Less silly people America. Shit North Americans full morons got first AZ shot country live in, going back US June, miss second shot. I've told ask doctor US getting second shot different pharmaceutical. I'm fine that. However, we'd like stay 72-year old fully vaccinated mother-in-law summer. wife first shots. (Apparently first shot gives 80% immunity). 7-year old not. Would safe? quarantine? think exactly works. HIPPA thing, schools can't automatically get transfer health history (of vaccine records part) without consent. likely signed something authorizing college pull vaccine history California vaccine database (i.e., there's way highschool legally able automatically send vaccine history college). already virus? getting autism vaccine likely getting autism squats. Nobody ever gotten autism vaccine meaningless worry about. like worrying vaccine causing child sprout wings. I'm saying impossible child sprout wings vaccination, would certainly first time ever happened.


It's reasonably worry potential long term side effects vaccine. Autism one possible long term side effects need worry about. brand new vaccines? coffee cigarette, way wake know trust say this: nearly intelligent think are. part covid rules made sense whole year? you‚Äôre getting second dose, hydrate like madman immediately after. must chugged three bottles water even got home, Gatorade plus extra glasses night. side effects needing pee like racehorse. stress body trigger outbreak comes herpes viruses. Chances actual COVID infection would‚Äôve triggered outbreak too. Probably deaths undercounted 1 35 death rate covid already extremely low. choice guaranteed exposure low death rate vaccine potential exposure low death rate disease, insane see people would choose rhat option.   UK 32 people hospitalised contracting virus 21 days first dose AZ/Pfizer.

This total number 74,405 admissions.

So 32/74405 = 0.04% Pfizer Moderna full approval well schools go back session fall. announcement California actually contingent vaccines getting full approval. concerns actually taken account. vaccine doesn‚Äôt get full approval, aren‚Äôt going see public schools requiring without getting legal nightmare.  media punished censored posting blatant stuff.

This America. don‚Äôt censor media even they‚Äôre stupid. thought best vaccine one get!!!

Guess add line long list lies we've told throughout covid. People try link autism vaccines spreading misinformation need silenced Yeah basically infectious disease spreading around world pandemic, things vaccinate don‚Äôt fit description slightly disagree. countries throwing vaccines bin instead donating lending. seems unfair opinion. 

I'm suggesting countries donate vaccines vaccinate own, instead provide fair share population around world. needs global solution global problem. 

It's like climate change - can't solve problem one country stop global warming. Inclusiveness required. j j ? Yeah. know Pfizer one either lot side effects. guess different studies different participant pools, maybe Swedish study lower sample size, maybe small enough 80% efficacy looked like 45% efficacy.

You can't trust singular studies implicitly, need consider evidence studies topic together. experts helpful, since read studies understand enough know relevant. Restrictions continue pandemic over, assholes safe, wear masks, get vaccinated.

Feel free complain restrictions if/when they're still place pandemic over. went quick rabbit hole back up, realized many things vaccinate never worldwide pandemic understand provide context.

Unless google fu failed find worldwide pandemic tetanus think vaccine prevents transmission virus? concerned meeting s/o covid month ago? think 3 weeks already since recovered. didnt get tested heard people still positive already feeling okay. 

I might meet weeks month half since ha covid. still meet him? I'd guess felt anything day jab, body already noticing adjusting. alone likely difference weak case COVID much serious bout. wearing mask gathering large crowds poor management genocide. vaccine prevent transmission virus, protects severe symptoms. love California, wanna go soon pandemic Car crashes kill lot people.. however spread exponentially.

Plus already I'm recommending mask wise cars. set rules like drive side road, speed limits, make sure safety hardware intact working properly. 

So, wear mask... keep arguing computer never go outside... good either way ;) true. get antibody test long enough vaccination come back positive, since covid antibodies.

But test positive covid, since vaccine covid, (very oversimplified) small part covid enough immune system gets idea real thing looks like. Counterpoint: first mRNA vaccine used protect incoming outgoing transmission virus, makes think stipulation? Yeah, ask come large numbers rally Bengal thrilled large crowd. commute 20 minute walk. definitely affects thoughts wfh I'd put like this:  
\- crazy much likely beleive something predisposed matter weak evidence,  
\- much inclined disbelieve strong evidence supporting something predisposed believe. 


Unfortunately like virtually everything reduces cognitive load deal much. real way avoid it, constantly reflect believe things try adjust priors accordingly. better others, think many - even - people try all. \#bountyvirus brother previously infected covid chance? got first Pfizer shot couple days ago got pretty sick. Better protection Covid. Moderna started KidCove last month, Pfizer started enrolling last week. Pfizer‚Äôs trial 6 months long. earlier possible we‚Äôll see approved kids 12 probably 7-8 months. also data long term effects Covid. symptom stayed parosmia. things smell weird me. Since shot, gotten little worse, read parosmia sign nose healing. total anosmia couple weeks, guess I'll take get point. Interesting, well it‚Äôs documented MS symptoms actually improve pregnancy. MS autoimmune.
Also wondering many reporting unexpected bleeding, could interfere early pregnancy? got 2nd dose Pfizer without many side effects all. 

My wife got 2nd dose Moderna yesterday developed huge swollen welt hours later. barely move, nausea, local general pain, whole 9 yards. Hopefully side effects pass soon, pretty rough her. Yep, unnecessary places like US nearly surplus doses. Seeing others optimism helps me. pandemic taken mental toll me. wife covid last June. two little girls November. can't wait till kids get vaccinated, know risk low especially since already it... mind constantly wanders.

A normal fall would awesome... sounds like saying linger air person left like smoke. You‚Äôre conveniently ignoring existence children, can‚Äôt get vaccinated. realize usually don‚Äôt get sick, kids know many parents unwilling take chance. Also, long kids continuing serve reservoirs spreaders virus, numbers get low. live NC governor announced phase restrictions yesterday. plan, restrictions would remain place longer places like schools camps full kids. think that‚Äôs reasonable.

Edit add: also question everyone either safe chose get vaccine. I‚Äôve read couple articles suggesting nearly half immunocompromised patients might get immunity vaccine, aren‚Äôt really safe numbers down, even get vaccinated. US use language donated 4 million AZ doses Canada &amp; Mexico last month. They've got figure way donate since look like we'll even need it. mean largely irrelevant MP/MLA election. 3 state elections 2 national elections. lot Chief Ministers who've power 20 years straight. Naveen Patnaik one.  people covid rough first shot second easy shot That‚Äôs still well global scale. even developed nations.

And importantly Canadians follows happened rollout U.S., slow feeling start ramp quickly supply chains/logistics/messaging availability get ironed out. seem month behind us vaccination pace. really understand wrote this. never said need 100% effectiveness. saying guy saying public officials stop talking masking social distancing dumb idea still vulnerable people population reach herd immunity. Yup. solution. casinos offer people $25 credit etc... Silly incentives people would fall sarcasm? BV-1, Texas I'd say 70% fully vaccinated, certainly better quixotic, thoughtless approach Texas Florida. remember seeing long time ago 10 years smoke free lungs something like 90% healed Hate pass judgment state like West Virginia seems like he's trying get people /something/... maybe even put constituents position they're inclined get second dose. I've lived years, here's trick. want get kind certification stamp etc, ask FAKE one, yes works way too, natural law India get scammed request FAKE one get REAL one. Works every time 80% time. took mean previous occupant zero idea impulse incentive people right thing. Good betting man summer semi-normal fall normal

That trajectory vaccinations suggests Explain sources cherry picked? THIS. Can't even tell many people told gotten yet bc money insurance. Ask India. I'm Johnson&amp;Johnson single dose paper garbage fine example cherry picking sources. 

Also peer reviewed. 

Embarrassing comes Oxford ask me. body work tried claim 60% covid hospitalizations Michigan people already vaccinated. Everyone called bullshit cited numerous articles pointing couldn‚Äôt true. still stuck ‚Äúwhat family member works healthcare‚Äù told her. It‚Äôs crazy people believe anecdotal evidence. May 1st many follow suit. majority private schools require it. top-ranked schools require it. 60+ group stopped increasing well.

That's said. that's definitely case all. Neighbor definitely dumbass. cases seeing respond anticoag traditional treatment makes worse, require IV immunoglobin treatment ass? got first dose couple days ago, caused 12-18 hours pure suffering (fever, chills, aches, vomited). covid back February, I‚Äôve hear vaccine worse side affects previously contracted virus. I‚Äôm scheduled get second dose month, reaction likely better since evidence body responding? mRNA vaccines used decades üòÇ gee. idea country filled flat earthers global warming Chinese fart...why country might need extra assurances answer us achieve herd immunity backs population least likely suffer COVID 2 people use dubai instance stopover point, one person india, chance second person could infected without stepping foot india. safe solution close everything odds dying covid 1% you‚Äôre 50 healthy. odds debilitated long haul covid around 10%, odds infecting someone else pretty high. average every group 100 infected people creates 80 90 newly infected people. 

All all, 1 death 220 million doses? That‚Äôs insanely safe, means help stop thousands dying becoming disabled. Could agree more. find hard believe can‚Äôt take counter medication take gene therapy treatment hasn‚Äôt studied long term it‚Äôs ‚Äúsafe‚Äù. Canada seeing Pfizer Moderna vaccine appointments get filled immediately among 55+, AstraZeneca sitting shelves expire, open 40+, waste vaccines. Seems like similar situation. Even vaccine 1-40,000 risk blood clot, likely much higher chance serious covid complications. fairness well educated state might smart neighbors getting vaccinated ICU patients among 70 year olds went around 500 biggining march 336 since vaccination ramped up, problem 50 younger groups. 


Again, pretty awesome first world countries access mNRA vaccines everyone rejecting vaccines they're good mNRA ones would kill lot people. Johnson Johnson causes pregnancy solid day, body aches pretty severe gi upset Kelown came back bite incentive force vaccine passport  point something out: 90% immunity would every single person country getting vaccine since vaccine 90% effective.

Yeah buddy, that‚Äôs vaccines work. MMR 93% effective first shot, two 97%.

There 1282 cases measles documented 2019 anomaly year. 2018 *375*. would expect many many times based flawed immunity logic.

You don‚Äôt need 100% effectiveness reach near 100% immunity. virus doesn‚Äôt travel path, does.  Ministry Health reported 1776 new COVID-19 cases diagnosed 22nd April, increases total count 235,274 cases. represents variation 0.76% numbers reported today yesterday.   cases reported via PCR test 277 via epidemiological nexus (someone reported symptoms living confirmed case via PCR test). represents highest amount cases reported single day.   registered sectors country, corresponding 197,627 adults, 17,692 elderly, 19,840 minors.   cases women (+942 today), 118.588 (+834 today). 206,696 costa ricans (+1632 today), 28,578 foreigners (+144).   199.779 recovered (+400 today), 3125 dead (+10 today), means amount active cases 32.370.

Ministry Education also refusing shut education centers (they reopened year fully back normality, masks social distancing), even 700 cases coming schools month. also teachers died due COVID-19. Isn‚Äôt normal viral disease? unless every country earth bans India. could work find concerning deem something safe without long term study subject. Time tell suppose. comply punished lmao straight outta 1940's germany get herd immunity matter what. Prior infection counts. Depends where. think almost states august, earlier summer I‚Äôd bet money larger differences open different states are. second dose made feel ill? long side effect, feel now? asked wife thing. never able get vaccines safe young, death rate complication rate COVID less vaccine, safe say worry then? get we're trying prevent transmission, every adult choice get vaccinated not. Every country Earth needs follow suit Vaccination age group (18-45) opening next week India probably going az one covaxin production still ramping others going available till May end . parents already done first shot az waiting second due 30th April . complication , articles surely giving much assurance getting vaccineted shot az . Probably going wait Sputnik . normal feel fatigue two days shot? well today, around 8:00 got fatigue trying finish discussion class go sleep. Yup! 2019 feels great! seriously study see long term effects be. vaccines worked way people think (ie aren‚Äôt able stop asymptomatic spread) there‚Äôs reason anyone 40 would ever get one. Fortunately that‚Äôs case, case receiving vaccines put anyone risk you‚Äôre 99.999% population reading unbiased doctors say article written cbsnews blatant propaganda. concerning teen would one million times better getting vaccinated instead going Oh gotcha, way reports saying stopping doses side effects - made seem like avoid kind - get one put arm sooner! state.

Damn, that‚Äôs sad now. Gotta start live little Last week 46% large study. aware anything ever shown 90%  USC requires international students show proof tuberculosis vaccination don‚Äôt remember asking full vaccination record. Scientists San Diego get caught rest world year later... Anyone common sense figure dont need mask outdoors.  I've seen Youtube comments worse logic that... Based current data demographic people primary affected appears women 20-50 years old. 

So far 1.4M women group received J&amp;J shot 1 233K issue 1 1.4M died. CDC study, Israel study, 6 month update clinical trials change anyone's mind? Nope. 

Dumbass neighbor getting vaccinated means next dumbass neighbor gets vaccinated. 


WTF? I'm probably mistaken another European country.

I hopeful months US enough demand Canadian Mexican neighbors sent excess come vacation receive vaccination gone stage 1 2 completes trials initial analysis. two stages, although stage 4 waved. Stage 3 deeper dive trial data often requiring data acquired. 

Considering many people outside trials taken them, wonder data used part stage 3. 1. trust everything read Internet

2. everything doctor thought covid contributing factor. cancer patient likely quite vulnerable covid, although yes might died soon regardless. Sadly seem number people covid primary reason death opposed lumping people contributing factor. think point people fear restrictions death, since death extremely unlikely average American. Pfizer vaccine needs diluted saline solution. forgot dilute it. No, it‚Äôs normal pandemic viruses come waves. thing happened Spanish Flu. Seriously. really think lot people abandon BS reasons getting one financial incentive. think lot people sincere anti vaccination beliefs cave pretty quickly 100 bucks. Biden lot power here. 

You mean handlers. doubt he's actually know time. yet smoker anomaly showed Italy's data too. lot people smoke China well, also represented data.

Italy suffered bad likely one elderly populations world along southern European culture people *much* closer contact socially northern europe.

No.  Actually, autoimmune issues ones getting first. people hesitancy ones allergic reactions injections before. even recommended get one shot, stick around 30 minutes EpiPen case, reaction, take second dose.  Totally incompetent leadership. many people must die. uk 66.5 million people. big enough sample size see strategy comparable.

The UK also better uptake people 65+ aka vulnerable people first glance read Latrine Population likely train wreck. People hospital coronavirus tested regularly, counted. large pool left infect possibility developing variants maybe less effective versus vaccine. Lol states like Texas Florida gave giant middle finger that. Self reported side effects reliable. That's controlled clinical trials.

Not real scientific result.

Edit: article even points explicitly:

""Reports prove medicine, vaccine medical device caused side effect, suspicion may have."" Hey, they‚Äôre gonna rolling thru U.S, don‚Äôt see reason can‚Äôt vaccinate now. It‚Äôs like day 20 you‚Äôre covered day 21 are. It‚Äôs gradual **Moderna vs Pfizer vaccine - Considering pregnancy**

The university issue mandating vaccinations (they actually made flu vaccine mandatory year well), far long covid vaccines EUA mandating it.

That said, know legal implications whether *could* mandate it, guess would mean lawsuit least. think they'd covering bases legal disclaimers worried legal implications. It‚Äôs impressive really. didn‚Äôt absolutely screw pooch vaccinations wouldn‚Äôt problem are.

‚ÄúThe side effects usually higher women child-bearing age that‚Äôs produce estrogen, explained. estrogen able stimulate immune response binding immune cells producing antibodies.‚Äù



‚Äú‚ÄúEstrogen doesn‚Äôt cause cause antibody responses vaccines, it‚Äôs women tend higher incidence autoimmune disorders, things like lupus, rheumatic arthritis things autoimmune body‚Äôs kind fighting itself. think there‚Äôs real biological plausibility we‚Äôre seeing,‚Äù Dresser said.‚Äù



‚Äú‚ÄúIt‚Äôs driven estrogen responses hormonal responses,‚Äù said, adding **this side effect may seen clinical trials requirement women partake they‚Äôre going getting pregnant, meaning could form birth control.**‚Äù Also, massive undercounted deaths covid point figure could also achieved low vaccine coverage. quite good seems covers time small percentage vaccinated.  yeah right  news jab spoken favour it. got second Pfizer shot yesterday. side effects whatsoever besides little soreness injection site. sister got well. tell vaccine prevents death/hospitalization? pretty important metrics.

The 3 million+ deaths world point important metric is. Yeah one hurt worse covid shot honest. Maybe already got covid already immunity. 

Or maybe lucky. sure thing even spouses would give other. 

It's actually rare members household transmit other. Lots ‚Äúmight be‚Äùs ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù‚Äôs - nothing new unless missed something. really definitive info yet. feeling better today? know feeling vaccinated. much risk still CDC giving advice shop visits smoother, they've giving think might still get covid vaccinated.

I can't help feel want speak area (FL) vaccines fully available since first week April insane amount positives right now. Nope. Nothing. mostly white, female, healthcare workers. presumably best case due age. I'll research that, thanks. Yeah I‚Äôve downvoted oblivion saying I‚Äôll say again. vaccine end goal never was. end goal always reducing community spread low levels... vaccine merely tool get there. goal isn‚Äôt reached, isn‚Äôt reached... long folks still getting sick dying coronavirus still need certain restrictions control spread. Yes indeed, know know ‚Äì partly issue poor science journalism. think might engender trust carefully crafted articles specifically go facts means means.

As currently stands, people read heading promise. promise that, completely met, work vaccine acceptance.

That unfortunate, since scientists best situation working clock. vastly better result point results all. 

Ultimately, sense control. people accept vaccine willingly, reasonable expectations efficacy safety, better able make sense situation happier whatever occurs ‚Äì even rare negative result. ‚ÄúI made decision, made call, unfortunately didn‚Äôt work me‚Äù psychologically much acceptable ‚ÄúNo one one listened took concerns seriously, I‚Äôm mess.‚Äù

Nothing life 100 per cent bad things happen everybody ‚Äì whether results psychological trauma dependent sense control, perhaps also sense belonging. 

To support vaccine acceptance, then, must listen take concerns seriously address concerns realistically regarding knowns unknowns, leaving room error bad luck well optimism. didn‚Äôt know viruses partook extreme mountain climbing. utterly impressed this. lot undocumented residents US may may identification, one want show. also ton supply 10 dollar shot, cares.  someone wants spend money plane ticket fly Atlanta, get shot, wait 3 weeks touristy things, get second shot....I say power them. Spend money US, we'll float cheap vaccine shot. wife got sure, never tested positive &amp; also said symptoms mean ever course. still isolated due exposure her.

As well, COVID 19 recommend vaccination still, long wait 90 days recovery (or that).  Ehm... think good enough?   economists want tell people respond.

Of course countries nationalistic. government moral legal obligation protect citizens. Oxygen usually tank form, thankfully. Tank fittings pretty standardized, too. hospitals usually order place welding shop does.  That's nuts. personally think 100% festivals. kind spread within month norm. variants must exceptionally transmissible. feel you. convinced getting yearly shots least while. going people don‚Äôt get vaccinated. states struggle get anywhere near heed immunity because, somehow, vaccines political now. assholes saying cure worse disease. won‚Äôt get shot help protect humans help economy get moving heard % follow second doses really high Yeah, M-F 8a-5pm mass vax sites downtown easy people like work suburbs. able find Sunday slot semi-local pharmacy instead, think lot people waiting for. 

I also think grocery stores pharmacies, hourly intercom announcement ""FREE covid vaccine walk-ups taken right now"" help. reasonable question. Lots medical treatments pregnancy difficult test ethics involved. know trials people found pregnant got pregnant first trial gave first data safety. 

After really first people get vaccine, mostly healthcare workers high risk getting COVID risk fetus, compare COVID risk potential risk vaccine. 

My cousin position January difficult decision her, ultimately decided get vaccine 33 weeks. Sample size shouldn‚Äôt make numbers lower. estimates study fall within 95% confidence interval estimates CDC study. means two estimates statistically same.

People need realize lot uncertainty true efficacy first-dose studies. really certain like 50% 90% effective that‚Äôs talking super vaccine hesitant evangelical day told point antivaxxers able without much real world consequences (the occasional measles outbreak). time different. pro-life stance called question it‚Äôs obvious places large % evangelical holdouts keep getting waves people still dying areas moved on. people know gotten sick 2nd dose already contracted covid. One got week getting first dose. None sick enough go hospital anything ride day two. case acquired hotel quarantine? Yes, except one. I'm almost certain answer yes, think proven. Good It‚Äôs fear-mongering kids can‚Äôt get vaccinated yet. Got 2nd dose Tuesday kicked ass, feels good worry anymore. needs arrested tried crimes humanity testing vaccinated asymptomatic people relatively low rates covid region, positives false positives,

I understand saying, I've done Bayesian calculations before, true positive sample small chance contaminating another sample, vast majority positive results true positives.

You saying specificity test unable balance lack prevalence. saying specificity problem decrease prevalence also decreases. Well that‚Äôs freaky. Glad homeschooled kids past year. live Houston suburbs, there's large chunk population visiting family dining restaurants since last May, getting vaccine equate ticket back normalcy minds Ok see. Sorry reading comprehension seems taken hit since got second jab ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è wow hope get back normal soon  Yeah, feasible fan never-ending pandemic. short walk home city‚Äôs downtown go various bars restaurants. put mask leave home. I‚Äôm concerned infection walk don‚Äôt feel like fumbling around mask come restaurant. Wearing mask minor inconvenience unless work someplace wear 8 hours. even know April 22 June. 10mo odd transmission outside quarantine 

Except local case January also resulted lockdown think biggest ""downside"" feel accepted unnecessary risk.

The second dose/immunity occur mid July (after 2nd dose beginning July).

I think natural think one would taken Pfizer June, 2 months now, would better, quicker, risk free immunity.. Thats want. don‚Äôt want vaccinate rest life 3 times year time new variant pops up. please don‚Äôt take anti vax. that‚Äôs it. really dislike idea. They‚Äôll latch onto next one. It‚Äôs really variants mentally don‚Äôt want move worrying covid various reasons Sorry got downvoted right. updoot, sorry couldn‚Äôt still spread virus getting virus 12 days asymptomatic carry? realize articles reporting known statistics ‚Äòpoint estimates‚Äô. estimates come lot uncertainty, journal articles calculate. Namely, 95% confidence interval first dose studies high, like anywhere 50%-90%.

What means is, repeated studies 100 times, expect 95 estimates reported 50% efficacy 90% efficacy.

So studies contradicting  Please show evidence 700 mostly younger people entire ""long hauler"" placebo/plea attention. Nobody give liars time day. increase severity illness kids number. I'm seeing trend new variants hitting kids harder. Oxford vaccine proving good UK going 1 jab 3 month gap proving, again, best option. Actually says happened producing plants well export restrictions. 

A lot countries producing plants export restrictions (or restrictions came play later stage, like EU countries although export requests still granted) therefore far vaccination campaign lot production exported countries. 

As article says, truly pandemic global population reached herd immunity. definitely see point view long think using inductive reasoning. Anti-vaxxers, hand, field day it, least that's saw social media. ‚ÄúBetter‚Äù

Here headline: Scranton Area Paper Company, Dunder Mifflin, Apologizes Valued Client; Companies Still Know Business Done. Okay? observation, originally mine, validated research veterinarian consulted specializes disease. Wow, amazing! almost like made begin with. Nothing sounds worse long-term battle memory fog! convenient long haulers vague, unverifiable symptoms! People refuse vaccine don‚Äôt live isolated Covid island. spread enable endangers can‚Äôt vaccinated vaccines don‚Äôt work for. spread enable also allows variants develop. Continued restrictions community spread protect community, unvaccinated. 

As simplest example, 10 year old cannot get vaccinated. absence herd immunity, 10 year old goes somewhere indoors restrictions, materially higher risk would indoors everyone masked distanced. don‚Äôt care kids. reputable medical analysis shows really hurt covid

And again: jot base society incredibly immunocompromised, never never should

People lost concept risk - reward analysis. large swaths people safe getting. pfizer vaccine? I‚Äôm genuinely curious days dose 1 Pfizer, essentially reach maximum coverage vs getting severe covid. basis UK delaying shot 2 3 months.

If CDC estimates right, roughly 99.995% chance survival...likely higher given age health... they?

I've thought quite bit recently. main reason care hospital workers significantly traumatized watching people die horrible deaths virus. Imagine trying help people gasping air days weeks last breaths, knowing there's much do, year straight. alarming number nurses reporting PTSD mental health problems.

Cardiff Wales, announced today they're sending invitations 28-29 year olds, hopefully long! free look end February. number hospitalizations people 50-69 skyrocketed since. 


In fact 50-59 60-69, hospitalizations flat month month February starting explosive growth mid-March.    even need ask? Really?

Absolutely, yes. lot comes demographic factors. I'm trying make excuses anyone I'm trying blame anyone, different groups people tend less willing others get vaccinated. United States, nation immigrants every part world, prone fact relevant logistics abilities. large pool different people, hard find unity issue like one since different groups peoples attitudes pretty much every issue think of. think would great could move past issues, that's reality situation.

Also, issue running people take bit misleading. I'm sure different United Kingdom, United States people kind outreach get vaccinated. young, healthy American, figure getting vaccinated. text messages telling appointment nearby, spots walk grab one, gotta figure schedule it, go process setting up, go wherever- might hours away- get yourself. people serious risk, lot decide that's worth trouble even they'd fine getting offered them.

And matter 95% people vaccinated also bit different situation. That's referring older population exclusively eligible while. United States, everyone sixteen eligible, makes sense we're seeing 95%.

I hope informs debate also second doses giving different second dose vaccine based potentially exposure rates time. EU exported 77 million vaccines, far.

Glad EU work Sanofi. realized mistake, went correct it. exact thing said earlier, pointing waited late! Putting order January super late! got late game, paying dividends they're delivering huge chunk vaccine.

Apparently Ivy League schools arent worried legal issues.   reason think vaccines won‚Äôt work variant

The hiccup administration vaccines. Somehow top ten country February fell off. guess Moderna CureVac used well, Pfizer/BioNTech main vaccine. mRNA definitely seems way go (for richer countries least) J &amp; J trial conducted later, ""variants"" contend time. I'd wager surface seems ""less effective"" based respective trials mRNA might far real world scenario we're well past time OG COVID main variant. absolutely agree need one-shot. Hopefully one come along carrying excess baggage J&amp;J. Biden administration lost confidence it, impressed Walgreens experience. seemed schedule many people here. first shot okay, one person me. second shot arrived time, least 5 people me, arriving shortly me. waited almost hour get shot.

In contrast, I've heard people say good things megasites state. They're efficient despite lot people. 10k per day conservative, regions actual toll estimated 24-27x official  I'm Dallas area, market shot county give options, texted ""your appointment 3:30 Wednesday"". county signed said show time Wednesday 9am-6pm, *possible* arrive 6 would also improbable mercy traffic. Maybe changed since then, reduced demand I'm sure would.  Indian uk variant means lowering incidence besides vaccines, too. think safe say seasonality point. We're much open last spring. indoor dining people hanging out. Last year April May. India spring right exploding cases. noticed friends got pfizer vaccine received minimal side effects. everyone know took moderna side effects like aches, chills, fevers, etc. still feel like crap Friday. got vaccine #2 dose Tuesday. Well, free country like, I'll certainly wearing masks often. choosing proactive health mandating everyone else also wear mask. got second dose days ago experienced sore arm. know worst experience loudest wanted share mine well went mega site; time, hard find appointment doctors note county federal megasites accepted eligibility context what's going on, couple days ago Quebec opened AZ people age 45+ walk basis demand skyrocketed. Glad see this! would love outdoor masking become thing past, lot media groundwork recently surrounding outdoor masking fairly useless situations.

Everything said makes sense here. mind outcome much, though hope indoor masking go away bit earlier (but hold breath). doctor called ask got already soon. Yeah, that's Fauci saying. 70% low end. 

""I would think would need somewhere 70, 75, maybe 80%. population vaccinated, number I‚Äôve using it‚Äôs it‚Äôs estimate. make extrapolation infections. say 75 80 85% we're vaccinating children yet, there's that. necessarily failed, definitely delayed. vaccine provide good enough protection ampng elderly adjust formula phase 2 trials. trying new, adjusted vaccine, although available time matter. older risk factors get it. you‚Äôre healthy 20s would definitely think risks.

Blood blood god, uh, Air the...air...plane...? Again, simply speaking facts factual data J&amp;J causes blood clotting issues rare cases.

Its irresponsible ignore that. Word. work healthcare, personal choice vaccines less important protecting health patients.   Read ""Swole doctor throws 60 AZ Covid vaccine doses following no-shows""

me:I think heavy... Ah, that's relief. Thanks response. difference covid flu right covid currently circulating much higher level flu ever does. even though lower overall death rate flu kids, U.S. kids died covid far (297 one year) die flu given year (record high 188). I‚Äôm sure numbers compare worldwide.

Regardless, I‚Äôm aware anywhere schools reopened person learning. Mine person learning six months. lucky. exactly like hacks allowed one patient ventilator. desperate move. can't keep clean day refuse it. many medical workers got sick. desperate first thought reference Ice Pirates (1984) cult classic üëç

Edit: Expanse fits bill also Pfizer/BioNTech may even best alternative poor countries due relatively high cost requirements cold storage. regard othe vaccines like AstraZeneca J&amp;J better, likely bought great amounts Western countries.

I even suspect many AZ doses bought will, example, sent COVAX EU countries run people give vaccine to. Medical records, like vaccinations need submit proof for. did. That's everyone wants fix this, think can. best-case scenario rarely ever comes pass virus. Without specialized treatment, syndrome stop. going get much worse. case numbers per day still ROCKETING upwards sign slowing down. Also true. Seems fair. many people getting third shot USA part Pfizer modern trials think we'll hit 70% total population point approved children administered schools, New Hampshire one state that's already crossed 70% eligible population receiving least one dose think half states country potential cross number well.

I also agree general mention prior infection, think 20%. think way, way higher. point I'd estimate least 110,000,000 Americans infected point. Trust me, scarier old people around constantly anxious want see die pain may school attendance, reasonable accommodation required disability sincerely held religious belief workplace. See question hard disagree tbh. explanation function spot on, 2 shots exactly same, don‚Äôt change dosage shot. got it. think Coca-cola McDonalds spend much money youth sports?

Buy goodwill money made harming people. living NYC, could never got vaccine.  never able afford car life, anything 5 miles away much possible task me. I'm sure poor people dealing well. Thank ! Feeling excited get feel sick? Basically everyone work taking vacation day scheduled 2nd shot. little extra cash would pretty nice! Amen. One cats *ridiculously* expressive.

He's also *very ridiculously* handsome. Yes that's Republicans say. Meanwhile, keep creating tons waste goddammit that's way things. Oh restrictions forever Except apparently March - June last year. Missed opportunities. would seem, frankly I'm glad hear it. feel better soon! 

People life believe side effects long accused infected COVID again. took 3 tests came negative. People need know shots cause side effects harsher longer lasting some.

Since days feeling bad second shot, felt better ever. post-covid symptoms struggling year completely gone. know shot truly happy it. There's lot press expert commentary past week outdoor masking unnecessary/overkill. maybe ""100 days masks"" gets renewed another 100, indoors-only.

The ""100 days"" thing applied settings land federal government gets direct oversight over. includes many public parks, could potentially drop outdoor requirement make nice difference visibility (although pretty much optics, almost zero difference actually controlling virus).

That would also kick masking-indoors road till mid-July, point every adult U.S. wants shot gotten theirs. also gets us window seasonality vaccination COVID deaths hospitalizations, probably even cases, extremely low levels. could potentially another optics thing 4th July suggesting indoor masking go away. lie -- said ""we'll provide best effort, X million vaccines."" reason people took ""Welp, they're definitely going produce deliver X million"".

I get people versed contractual legal-speak. AZ totally screwed here, lie -- said they'd best effort deliver many could, gave upper limit....then hit it. even come close. EU done better contingency planning.  sounds counterintuitive. one shot, way practical.

If could choose vaccine would get (and no, anti vax) would choose J J reasons.

My last choice would AZ, ""efficiency"", countries using huge gap two doses, much three months. vaccine passport enforced it, sit wait despite wanting vaccine actually getting vaccinated.

Well informed people know vaccines work prioritize practical fastest solution. People extreme different reasons It‚Äôs quite ironic, deem dangerous population, issue letting neighbours use it.

Not sure you‚Äôre bringing US this, going go strawman debate. Amazing people still ""just flu bro"" thing 2021 ""Any risk"" sure, risk literally everything covid disappeared. 

That said, way think given effective vaccines risk likely much lower flu everyone vaccinated. 

If 2018 bat eye something like this, would say go it. 

But again, risk elimination possible. forget recent discussion top minister focus cow science. fact told bang vessels, chant 'go corona go', shut lights light candles drive virus away. overwhelming number people actually it. vessels banging thing announced think people would really it. Sunday enjoying lovely nap rudely awakened horrendous racket!!! 

And article BBC recall reading. said something Indians generally immune covid living conditions. encouraged virus contained Dharavi. ministers top doctors claiming reached herd immunity. said residents Delhi already antibodies. look Delhi now.

Considering Astra Zeneca vaccines US approve never will, hardly generous act charity. alternative binning it. Sadly, think modeling takes account oxygen supply. could wrong though. What‚Äôs opinion honor system involved, example, someone never intends get vaccine pretends they‚Äôre vaccinated go back normal?

You accept vaccine coverage never 100% COVID cases never zero, thus possibility always going exist. best thing personal level get vaccinated it'll virtually guaranteed harm whether asymptomatically spreading.

I mention ""what spawn new variant?"" one ""costs"" could associated Group B because:

 - Partial vaccine escape going continue mitigated protection offered exist shots severe disease/hospitalization/death, really care about;  
 - Full vaccine escape theorized likely take years, even possible all, due existing vaccines target spike protein;  
 - mRNA puts us position roll boosters rapidly;  
 - reservoir unvaccinated people variants could develop going huge remain huge internationally several years. Whatever size aforementioned ""Group B"" U.S. (people get shot matter what, stop following restrictions public health guidance says so), guarantee drop bucket compared billions people around globe take 2023 us get vaccinated (if all).

Besides which... concerned possibility new variants hatching virus spreads around unvaccinated people, entice get shot telling life get back normal after. see low community spread U.S., tradeoff worth making. public transportation. live Midwestern city, don‚Äôt really good public transportation, places drive 10-20 min. 

I don‚Äôt like taking mask outside house since can‚Äôt properly wash hands. Technically could wait put get store, also long hair, takes bit fussing get straps place crazy hair. Yes, transmissibility matters. COVID dangerous flu transmissibility reasons; less likely get seriously sick COVID, likely get it. said, I'm sure COVID transmissible flu fall, even among unvaccinated children, adults mostly vaccinated. That's obviously limiting vectors transmissibility. antibodies. would need vaccine? crazy state specific is... Washington state Hawaii opened eligibility everyone Monday appointments exist plentiful.

I think dust settle pretty high number outside deep south. Totally. difficult catch individual, address potential concerns, help availability issues.
We starting enter difficult stage vaccine people point US, earlier thought would. painstaking phase putting lot efforts individuals maybe hard reach.

Johnson &amp; Johnson likely resume soon make easier kind outreach clinics anecdotal, I‚Äôm hearing many people (usually 20s 30s) already Covid, ‚Äúall antibodies‚Äù now. don‚Äôt think need it, confused whether need it, also long Covid can/should get it. Many also believe never get again.

I think need higher level messaging directly address issue.  don‚Äôt understand there‚Äôs rush get 3rd Pfizer vaccine ready. $$$? Oh worries, I‚Äôm Howard Hughes type shut pandemic. take sensible science based precautions like masks indoor dining indoor socializing. said, shop grocery store, outdoor dine, see friends outside responsibly, etc. mostly commenting close finish line weird impulse restrict don‚Äôt fumble one yard line lol. Going large-ish one (20 people) weekend. fully vaccinated see risk personally. ride public transportation?! drive, wear car. put whenever get car public setting, take get back car. one-in-100000 risk going show group 15. Anecdotally still run people think really hard get appointment, apathy going way get it. think would wonders partner every employer say 50+ day nurse shows give vaccines. 

I know flu vaccine, many people get it. Makes really easy even need plan anything. still got week/ two weeks go get good protection. always depend individual situation well, individual immune response, viral load, exposure time etc. broadly yes fair level protection 2-3 weeks after.   environmental impact enormous. made plastic, amount masks discarded environment last year amount hundreds billions. Keep forever world drown rubbish.  I‚Äôd rather catch COVID Pfizer Moderna appear effective, boosters coming fall, won‚Äôt happen J&amp;J. know hospitals India among best world. great hospitals poor ones take virus seriously live parents age 65 poor health, thank much. talk much like risk assessment covid infection justify getting vaccine. young people high risk getting seriously ill dying flu? No. many get vaccinated? help prevent breakthrough cases happening susceptible individuals, INCLUDING people actually can't vaccinated due medical issues. whether risk. also save ass ways. die mean get sick dog, case novel virus wind long term damage last months recovery longer. Plenty folks 30s gotten seriously ill hospitalized covid, even die. overall percentage small? Yes. even go 99.97% chance survival virus chances still better magnitudes get vaccinated.

Thank  would follow doctor's advice Cases deaths. reading comprehension seems bad mindset. Conservative government feel safe custodians NHS. I'm Wales health looked devolved government least. starting lot availability vaccines everywhere state, every county, best advertise social media TV there's lot interest first doses anymore. Walk appointments available every county. 97% Israel sure, closer US. here. many people taking seriously. Yeah, know. Sadly. true, im guessing meant US trial. Eating outside safe. Italy needs open already. also ""collapse enthusiasts"" want see civilization end least go downward spiral. them, think, hope lives miserable societal collapse seems like way ""out"". Others confidently predicting societal breakdown due COVID can't admit wrong. don‚Äôt advocate keeping restrictions certain amount, specific availability vaccines. think that‚Äôs different issue entirely, you‚Äôre right, shouldn‚Äôt hold back society people still refuse vaccine.

I commenting simply using honor system means allow vaccinated people renter society. wouldn‚Äôt fair people vaccinated people unvaccinated could lie participate same.

As far kids go, I‚Äôm focused health risks much daily lives impacted ‚Äî they‚Äôre exposed unvaccinated, they‚Äôd quarantine miss school/activities minimum ten days, close unvaccinated contacts would same. depends vaccine... countries vaccination program toddler hood matter politicians do, someone complain. roll eyes point.  Send bad boys Canada pleasee people almost every article talks covid sentence variants. especially notice article referring good news. lobbyist = bad evidence?

Again, India vaccine. could wave use businesses use vaccine. works really well. not.

Tell me, facility would using IPs India willing put money it? CDC put guidance saying ~80% protection first Seems unlikely true J&amp;J trial, trialed South Africa also, variant taken there. Good one r/Covidiots worked somewhere range 2800 hours(lot OT 2020) outside home warehouse crap ton Covid outbreaks since started last March. also 90% family's shopping cannot afford wait Walmart take 2 weeks deliver Instacart expensive.

I Never high temperature got sent home, def never Covid. Company provide shots us, got own. Received 2nd shot 10th. Wear mask wash hands, fine.

TL, DR. Live life, take normal precautions. sneeze face 2 feet away covid checks see there‚Äôs roof proceeds. Ah yeah, global conspiracy Modi, leftist vehicles as... Time? waiting this! Look know probably lashing able get vaccine, that's awful. I'm sorry. REDACTED REDACTED up.

Yet another reason leave CA... around probably since beginning. media uses another ad revenue stream. see variants seen back July. US really good getting people immune, whether vaccines natural way.

New nurses doctors eligible work yearly enough spots part big centers, nurses part time random clinics new specialist physicans surgeons often subspecialize additional fellowships get advantage get position someone retires. 

So part, non-issue. 

Perhaps rural centers might bit harder staff people. Thank you! Thanks quick reply! Good know makes sense! Honestly shouldn‚Äôt hold economy anti-vaxxers. Open things back get sick, get sick. think Covid conspiracy theory anyway. I‚Äôm baffled removal. coming from
PEW KFF, political organization. Sociological trends clearly impact vaccination efforts sentiment. 

Removing posts like seems particularly unscientific negligent. Sounds kinda like Texas right now‚Ä¶I really hope I‚Äôm wrong, think TX gonna get clobbered people start congregating indoors summer. third Americans fully vaccinated. think point yet start sending Moderna/Pfizer/J&amp;J vaccine countries. Astravenica sent abroad, FDA approved yet (although approved use Europe).

Vaccinating 300 million people massive undertaking. Add top fact vaccines bit temperamental shelf stable. read article, closures part shifting mass vaccine sites mobile sites. balancing act send shots, sign done. yet, still lot people continue act six feet kind magical coronavirus barrier.

That's originally promoted. thought covid spread via droplets would fall air traveling farther six feet. messaging also way focused exact number. say distance better, try least six feet away people.

They took painfully, almost negligent, amount time acknowledge covid spreads via aerosol particles go much farther six feet. Even that, public awareness campaign tell people amount distance safe indoors. Kumbh Mela

That local event. Barely people outside UP, usually sadhus only. know, I've it. space time cases show relation event. Three six wives reported cycle changes husbands wife experience. currently hormone suppression regiment due planned medical procedure cant tell personally still waiting get second shot. People suck... insight paused lmao hope. hope. agree decision, think pause already irreversibly damaged reputation J&amp;J vaccines increased vaccine skepticism. part CDC‚Äôs guidelines encourage rote compliance instead actually reasoning underlying principles.

There whole lot people good nuance reasoning. think CDC went simple, easy-to-understand guidelines (distance, mask up, wash hands), everyone ""gets"" constant reminder protect danger can't see. start qualifying guidance based circumstances, widespread misunderstanding bound follow.

tl;dr: People stupid.

PS - Congratulations yer first poke. guess Chinese mostly Chines vaccine Americans mostly American vaccines. /s mean weren‚Äôt excited see trailblazing University Maryland follow suit dozens universities already announced mandate? Well suit don‚Äôt want loop North Northwest Texas Technical College announces mandate. Depends state, experience NY. many states, sign website that's it. Also many states explicitly require residency.

You call ahead find out. FDA/CDC quietly paused J&amp;J vaccine point baltimore factory snafu lack supply . period done additional research come conclusion, released results one fell swoop along additional guidelines goes back ‚ÄúYea, airborne risk, biggest risk still droplets.‚Äù

The Korean restaurant HVAC study basically confirm this: well mixed air, obviously gravity effect people certain distance away infected. able stay air significantly length time, would expect tables exposed.

Right now, I‚Äôm still going change opinion Direct Contact Droplets Airborne Surface primary risk factor decisioning tree. love seeing downward trend far things gone vaccination roll out.  US: 41.5% 1st dose

Canada: 27.5% 1st dose

We're catching pretty quickly tbh. Thanks biggest one opinion is, ""well still wear mask follow restrictions, exactly point?"" Like everytime fauci says something like he'd still go indoor restaurant biden zoom call wearing mask despite vaccinated, going drive on-the-fence people away some. 2nd Moderna Wednesday nothing sore arm light fatigue, definitely universally bad. nervous JJ vaccine get Moderna Pfizer instead. 3 thought Moderna looked safest. found pharmacy Moderna went that. okay slight risk JJ okay. [The UK currently 7 day incidence rate 26.3 per 100,000 EMA's study, ""low"" incidence rate 50/100,000. UK half that. they're confident data (particularly part ICU admissions, important data IMO), MHRA really need update guidelines stop giving AZ vaccine anyone age 50 right (or least inform risks beforehand). literally dangerous young people accept vaccine reject it. crucial properly conveyed British public ASAP.

They though, cos bought much AZ stock want use it, risks damned. Cool. 6.5 hrs track lol lot. think they‚Äôre readying big push May get return ticket, would look booking vaccine date. lot places booking weeks out. hard change minds hesitant take vaccine? Well, like Upload-Crouton-Array said, lie. CDC repeatedly said hang inside masks social distancing fully vaccinated people.

But may true need convey that, getting vaccinated might change everyone's life immediately, things never go back true normal without many people possible getting vaccinated. Anecdotally better, that's people likely confirmed COVID before. note March 2020 COVID tests thought nearly accurate now, antibodies wear faster long-term immune memory, antibody test 6+ months March 2020. Yeah let people decide upvotes/downvotes, censor people based personally like dislike. Great moderator! Yes think so. shitheads still support shambolic government. Thats real tragedy. Right? Isn‚Äôt strain that‚Äôs wrecking havoc Brazil already variant concern? 

Isn‚Äôt exactly kind situation people speculating could lead strain (at least level ) vaccine resistance?

As side note: I‚Äôm wondering no-shows. people unaware second dose necessary, issues getting second dose people didn‚Äôt exist first? brother lives Chicago, knows people drove 4 hours (one way) south Illinois get J&amp;J shot.  Antivaxxers one month ago: ""They're gonna call us threat society outcast us!""

Antivaxxers now: ""Vaccinated people threat society need outcast!"" Hospitalizations going way New York last days along positivity rates low 2‚Äôs (it near 3 while). Great news warmer weather coming Literally exact experience. ‚Äúfriends‚Äù think it‚Äôs selfish want things return normal 4th July whole thing exacerbated immense pain nonstop self reflection. 

So glad things looking up. well strong friend. Mine started 10 hours shot lasted 24 hours, almost minute. like light switch turning off.

So, 34 hours shot totally normal. Also gather fully vaccinated people, aka seeing friends family first time year. unbelievably needed thing. biggest concern one catch changes trials??? Didn‚Äôt trials go like months?

Blood clots would sometimes show 2 weeks menstrual changes would sometimes occur woman‚Äôs next cycle (which 28 days). 

How heck one see symptoms EUA approval? testers tracking volunteers trials, come none issues come now? Same. laughed. saw comment downvoted sad. *cries Canadian* balance think right decision. vaccine still best reaching transient populations people less stable living situations.

Every vaccine given one step closer getting back normality. Restrictions masking stopgap measure get us point vaccinations protect us. That's always case. Restrictions drop cases, hospitalizations, deaths Covid longer pose threat disrupting healthcare services, numbers reflect vaccination rates high enough (or enough people suffered infection.) restrictions go beyond point Covid less threat flu, consider replacing people keeping restrictions place - yet, patient. side affects 12 hours starting 12 hours mark. held taking anything till 24 hours turn took advil, kicked side affects Although think people get vaccine, requiring illegal current laws. can't discriminate based thousand figures, included.

""You still avoid medium large-sized gatherings.""

""If travel, still take steps protect others. still required wear mask planes, buses, trains, forms public transportation traveling into, within, United States, U.S. transportation hubs airports stations.""

For 30-39 year olds, risk death COVID-19 3-4x higher, risk death vaccination 20% lower. So, run numbers above, it'll hard stretch set numbers justify waiting couple days, let alone year olds older? numbers completely lopsided favor AZ vaccine orders magnitude.

To preempt ""But new variants"" argument - variant far likely 1) develop outside US countries vaccinated 2) evolve become less dangerous 3) thwarted vaccine since vaccines attack component virus makes effective human body.

(Also, ""social pandemic"" dumb idea reality) get both. sure point don‚Äôt think dead people ‚Äúhop‚Äù another manufacturer... Haha I‚Äôm fun quarantine with. 14 days straight drinking games. Want join? changed definition herd immunity beginning covid, remember?

""a concept vaccination""  know nothing course know actual truth forgive J&amp;j actually aggressive since one done? Ban flights India. Problem solved.

Of course government dumb that. probably new variants causing it, read one man brazillian variant mild symptoms died pretty fast, we'd better hope vaccines work variants, doubt see people interested getting booster original 2, may cause faith vaccination deteriorate Man, happy quickly Israel vaccinated, went fast really get see numbers actually start drop off. hope one quarantined length time üò¨ Vaccinated people get infected. asymptomatic. even get symptoms. opposed guy who‚Äôs worrying 1 dose vaccine efficiency changing 90% 80%? Lol 
If that‚Äôs popular topic parties I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm invited! picture tells grim reality. 
Something occurring many places India.  


This person's family, friends, acquaintances 56 deaths 24 Margherita? talking point since day one, roundly disproven data takes days covid die surfaces. would wait days accidentally bring gym items. known *long* time? like hygiene theater, *just now* considered??? 1 day?!?!  say herd immunity possible vaccines restrictions? think people aren‚Äôt vaccinated cautious indoors people places masks come off. would places like restaurants bars gyms,‚Äù Schooley said.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 1.4 Billion people live India, US population rounding error compared that. It‚Äôs either falsified negative testing got covid right testing. need negative test 3 days flight. Ridiculous. response measles outbreak back six years ago. *was It‚Äôs less natural infection. else explains Indiana Ohio fire Michigan was? border wall force field.... Although situation improving US, aspects situation legitimately concerning brushed rug people want optimistic I‚Äôm worried going second crisis Covid over, dealing long haulers.  wondered ""herd immunity"" antibody study done indicate close herd immunity. try find data later. either data wrong, antibodies stop new strain? CDC revise guidance masks outdoors necessary. That's studies saying months. personally wear one outside unless crowded situation, I'd never think indoors public without one. find interesting comparing cases MI vs MN various spikes. add gaps two, equal end. Absolutely, fact group started vaccine clinics Manteca &amp; Fremont Sikh temples well. seems reasonable. relaxing rules requiring masks indoors important safety measure. model rest country.  told it‚Äôs normal things change bit. didn‚Äôt call paranoid said don‚Äôt be. love able compare states metro areas, normalize per 100k residents US big country lots wonderful leadership prioritize different values. states prioritize individuality, sacrificing measures benefit greater good. Good them! I‚Äôll stay state I‚Äôm happy sacrificing little bit individuality greater common good. statement accurate. claimed reports CVT (the blood clots) also happening getting mRNA vaccines, are. questioning, hoping someone bit knowledge could enlighten, call paranoid. media loves giving us fear. Turn TV stop reading headlines like this. Go enjoy life. another plane available?

There's answer. *cue Family Guy clip* Gotcha, noticing today higher last week, guess maybe blip. watch week. Metropolitan centers hardest places get vaccine. re-edit comment accurate? would 98.8. 1.2 % die. 

Except isn‚Äôt even true US. 31.9 million known cases country, 569,000 deaths, it‚Äôs closer 2%. 

And fact announced today people who‚Äôve COVID, matter mild, 60% likely die 6 months cohort haven‚Äôt, makes vaccine REALLY good idea. Duh CDC forecast says case rate stays roughly level least May 15: pessimistic is. folks know forecasts, whether takes vaccinations account? I'd imagine downvoted global numbers mostly reflection India seeing absolutely zero connection topic diminished hospitalization US seniors. without discussion posting details numbers high sure feels like needless fearmongering added positive news post. must terrible, that‚Äôs seriously odd.

Hope there‚Äôs answer soon. There‚Äôs definitely peer pressure effect too.

When you‚Äôre surrounded people gotten it, you‚Äôre much likely get you‚Äôre surrounded people haven‚Äôt.

There seems tipping point small majority people getting leads almost everyone getting it. actually Canadian nationals returning India breathe air someone virus breathed out, virus gets lungs disease start.‚Äù

Thanks captain obvious.... different respiratory virus contradict CDC?

This CDC says regarding people COVID-19 cough, sneeze, sing, talk, breathe produce respiratory droplets. droplets range size larger droplets (some visible) smaller droplets. Small droplets also form particles dry quickly airstream.

This CDC covid page:
 Important Ways Slow Spread

  Wear mask covers nose mouth help protect others.
  Stay 6 feet apart others don‚Äôt live you.
  Get COVID-19 vaccine available you.
  Avoid crowds poorly ventilated indoor spaces.
  Wash hands often soap water. Use hand sanitizer soap water aren‚Äôt available.

Seems like stating nothing false wrong. Maybe argue disinfecting surfaces particles forming extra precaution hurt anyone. 

Another trash article. 75 million people exposed covid. misleading incomplete stat. actually know percentage, yet. reason patient. need learn social distance OK. misunderstand read. Weed hell drug lol New Hampshire highest vaccination rate country 1st doses (59%), yet still increasing confirmed cases. What's going here? Thats extremely high vaccination rate. case, attribute state decreases vaccinations instead factors play ? may factors going isolate vaccination impact seems. think probably take another couple months really know. dumb idea regardless. virus give shit tired. owe anything. re-surge vaccinate enough people, already looking like won't, misinformation read right. Yeah, mostly younger healthy people issues... people allowed planes positive. got stop. chart FT highlights drop ICU admission rate elderly people lower age group predominantly unvaccinated. gap startling places like Chile. say don‚Äôt know either lol. went get 1st shot today Walgreens. first store in, 13 months. almost forgot stores etiquette distancing. India worse position US UK ever were, combine absurd population. It‚Äôs normal things change bit. Don‚Äôt paranoid. results good it‚Äôs pharmacies. Last September, got flu shot yearly check asthma, pulmonologist office. 

The dermatologist mentioned Husband office got 100 doses COVID vaccine, offering patients needed them. Hand Covid guns Covid vax bullets Vaccinated, we‚Äôll ‚Äúvaccinate‚Äú dumb fuckers. It‚Äôs American way end. ATF vs Wacos known? busy shipping countries brownie points people die. also probably already covid. Insurance yes. strong arm providers. 

Luckily able find doctors trust, earn overtime. think doctors go profession genuine desire help. Wow. hang around bunch adults. apologize loss, truly.

There maybe last sentence. Or... could both.  honest say gonna annual shot while... Nah - especially given logistics temperature-sensitive vaccines off-grid environment. It‚Äôs also far civilization case severe reaction. nearest hospital 2.5 hour drive $30k helicopter ride away. That's tip it, gonna spend less grand huge festivals. ignorant people high school Facebook think covid/restrictions hoaxy. [medical I'm sure extent religious doctrine says must avoid modern medicine. also seems like [tested TIL New Delhi part Delhi. point even vaccinated reinfected COVID cases. silver bullet deniers saying cases non-existent India. pointed 200k cases day, said high population issue.

Source?  Happened lot Germany. negative outcomes far know. Curevac coming soon use mRna immunity many diseases wanes short period time. disease specific. hahaha made laugh.

I Israel though love bacon I‚Äôve alopecia universalis 15 years. Within 3 days first covid Moderna shot, hair body started regrow. month later, it‚Äôs still growing. I‚Äôm amazed also perplexed. anyone know could possible? It‚Äôs definitely possible contain anything happening India right now, no. cases spill across world along variants developing there. 

An escape variant isn‚Äôt unavoidable though. Like said before, seems fairly unlikely true escape variant may ever occur. It‚Äôs even theorized might even possible really smart thing targeting spike protein covid. theory reasonable, viable mutation virus could radically alter vital spike protein vaccines wouldn‚Äôt work it. 

That said, that‚Äôs theory, already know variants develop vaccine still effective less-so. question still remains far go. hope India doesn‚Äôt answer question us. know left behind 3 young children. really sad.

I hate take seriously. Poor woman died helping others. Like thousands doctors nurses around world. dont think know much type people go festivals, festival group vaccinated. Part Delhi.. think he/she means hopefully restrictions one day lessened DC. still strict restrictions place.   Holy shit. similar story here. Interesting shit open, people die economic burden pandemic. really, normal way doctors assess whether immune protection disease antibody titers, b cells. go doctor tell can't remember childhood vaccines get check antibody titers see need. vaccine assessed normal way vaccine. 


Yes B cells give immunity antibodies wane, correlation. longer antibodies disappeared, likely rest starting wane also. too! Big pharma amazing job bringing brand new technology pandemic small fraction time used take.

Must nice people who's lives saved grateful.

Clearly down-voters common sense way damn thing would work. would righteous. God save us World idiots.

Fire away down-voters -- prove mettle. sent bunch surveys staff volunteers pretty much everyone (except vocal minority) said wouldn‚Äôt consider without proof vaccination. 

Antivaxxers show discussions get heavily downvoted fact-checked. How? understand effect. people stil somehow harbor virus? really need give numbers. understand it‚Äôs difficult, even someone supports mask mandates it‚Äôs easy feel like bullshit. There‚Äôs definitely failure leadership among Democrats give easy ammo ‚Äúshutdown forever‚Äù people. worrying probability may infect another mammal yet unknown animal coronavirus pick virus' genes, creating another hybrid virus infect humans.
This likely happened already. Yeah illegal member states aprove order own. Might trouble traveling within EU non EMA approved vaccines thos. know bunch people (including me) signed one two waiting lists patiently waited contacted. worked fine also lot people hunting open appointments like Terminator, it‚Äôs creating situation providers long waiting lists others tons open appointments.

Lansing‚Äôs started walk-in hours mass vaccination sites, got two siblings waiting line agree go tomorrow get vaccinated. Oh ya. 6 doses vile. possibly mistake made. sadhus already renounced material world live wild. don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd lining medical care carrying non existent communities.  Yet Biden still demanded states open X day did. Biden lot power here. Remember business taking money giving health service. two DTaP booster shots within couple months one Australia went back UK needed polio shot remember P stood Pertussis Polio gave lol.

So I'm super immune now. perfect, least better Texas. every single person. that's message want give, hopefully convince 70% people. Tobacco industry worst radio 1, trusted news source, different articles Belgian press. 20 around 40 Indian students sick tested positive Indian variant. expect got infected superspreader bus Charles Gaulle airport. Half students sick also vaccinated. Indian vaccine others Astrazeneca one. known vaccins already work less Brazilian variant, atleast infection wise, looking effect Indian variant. also 4 known cases Indian variant unrelated students. already spread going on. Yeah... plan using mask public rest life. sick year, there's whole privacy aspect. like people can't tell i'm gEt vAcCiNe   That's impressive, good job UK. point, need start restricting places based vaccination status. allow people gotten go large events like matches concerts. covid pandemic killed 10 times many people serious flu season would, roughly 40% people contracted covid living long-term, potentially permanent disability result.

It active global pandemic could easily kill tens millions people 100 million control it. Comparing flu bizarre. flu pandemic serious 1918, yes would support similar restrictions place.

I also think put expectation place people cold symptoms flu season wear mask symptoms go away.

I'm sure think vaccine passports quarantines place pandemic sociopathic paternalism. anything incredibly socially conscious. Sociopathy intentionally removing lifesaving protections mass casualty, mass disabling viral outbreak controlled. Requiring people get vaccine normal thing mature responsible societies do. goal slow vaccines get put arms. call hesitant. countries vaccine shortages, matter willing get vaccinated population is, there's enough vaccines. Sounds like J&amp;J back table tomorrow.

Will interesting see demand today‚Äôs true loss There's peer review study years worth data since first vaccination. educated opinion based everything know vaccine responses still worthwhile. brother, first shot tough, second like nothing. Go figure..
Personally, first Pfizer yesterday. chills, today muscle cramps. Hopefully second dose go smoothly. it‚Äôs CVS, absolutely. reschedule 2nd dose wherever there‚Äôs availability. first Waco 2nd Austin (roughly 2 hours apart)

Edit: changed cities change states long availability state GOGOGOGO

If USA makes shit go away rest world follow. Holy shit. USA, may back lead. Brazil right UK actually (22). see Brazil's numbers would less reliable Peru (1), Mexico (2), Ecuador (7) Bolivia (18).


The countries actually worst ones people hear much (due leaders' political views suspect). Except Cuba might measure proving places require it. That‚Äôs horrible thing say Got 2nd Pfizer dose yesterday 24 hours later feel like shit. Chills, bad headache high fever.. Tylenol anything else try ?   person's pedantry still accurate though. person said 'this age group's account 99% deaths' accurate. Thanks sharing scientific article. think fear panic clouding people‚Äôs judgement. it‚Äôs important already research follow science. 

The paper says he‚Äôs first person North America reinfected Covid. So, chances reinfection appear extremely low. 

I want iterate purpose vaccine provide immunity. person natural immunity, don‚Äôt see would subject vaccine long term safety data doubt we'll enough everyone, I'm sure 65% population actually want vaccine. want continue restrictions indefinitely people want jabbed.  Kids dying covid statistically significant numbers. Got 2nd dose Pfizer yesterday afternoon. Really feeling side-effects. Fever, fatigue, muscle soreness everywhere. It‚Äôs little scary. scary covid still.  tobacco? 'I need vaccine. need start smoking'. 

They never give up. like used doctors past say smoking healthy. hope you‚Äôre wrong. Seems quite pessimistic. Interesting. good news, mutant strains start become dominant, may need (ongoing) booster shots. guess, would getting many jabs done becomes politically impossible. Awesome bro, still another week left, 2nd able go back work.  problem refuse medical care dying sadhus COVID-19 contagious that's particularly ethical. Maybe charge people higher health insurance people wold candid smoking. think activities flu season thousands people die year intentionally killing people well?

I disagree suggestions, legitimately sound insane. risk compensation extreme paternalism, almost sociopathic level. table suggest UK actually over-reporting covid-19 deaths?

The way England bad, count anyone tested positive changed, there's still questionable methods used. Mostly daily figure issue. Long term less so. Maybe trend planned obsolesence products sceptical jaded, wouldn‚Äôt Pfizer invested interest recommending third shot anyway make way monehs? want know still give pets fully vaccinated. I'm fully vaccinated, worry could become infected symptoms, inadvertently give cats. Air hunger. It‚Äôs caused anxiety. get anxious take shallow breaths fills blood CO2, makes feel like need breath Seems like delayed reaction. I'd advice speak doctor run tests safe side. Texas numbers way down. Reddit scientists promised Texas DOOMED reading right? Cases jumped 68 week?! less 1 million new first doses last week. Assuming new cases actually occur last 7 days, WAAAAAY previous estimated occurrence. matters many people forced wear masks whenever visit business. mandate apply them, severely overestimating important is. 

If mandate rescinded, businesses continue requiring masks, general consuses fear happen anyway. 

If mandate stays, businesses decide they've enough, people going wear masks president says should. same. isolation ended 20 minutes ago now! hurray. really get sick, actually emptied sinusitis before. Got first shot 2 weeks ago. I'm due 2nd shot May 3. noticed relief four days. I've allergy sufferer 40 years. I'm looking ICU graph. January first roughly 950 sixty people ICU. closer 1125. 336 789 60-70 year olds.

Admittedly fewer 70 total numbers higher claimed gone instead.

The 60-70 current ICU patients gone 50% around 500 750 last two months. Even death certs. sure bill ‚Äúexplanation benefits‚Äù - free places charging insurance administrative fee (which fully covering) believe UK cons? (Spoiler know some, curious others think) saw Bush/Ashcroft 9/11 thought, ""how make confusing?"" mean.. duh.. right mind would think something kills lungs would HELP something attacking lungs? Yeah, annoying live world idiots, understand frustration. tested? pregnant woman risked life child test it? get contact local university scientist. talk mRNA tech good health problems. No. I'm never been. whole Brazil state? find first time around think individual risk is, function case rates population?

If vaccine blocks transmission well enough plummet case rates, does, provide extraordinary protect individual disease, absolutely allows behavior change. 

And fulfills public health goal turning covid crisis something manage, like flu. google lot mainstream articles last days. least academics brought public eye. saying people get around - see planes arriving \~50 people sick ICUs overflowing Canada say ""majoring minors."" Would suggest nothing sacrifice citizens? I‚Äôm much less concerned mRNA, it‚Äôs temporary code essentially teaches cells recognize virus react appropriately. Much concerned non-mRNA since got sick shingles vaccine months ago. scientists want cdc do? Update guidance spreads, what, differently help stop more. answers question seems Keep us informed works . Thx ‚ÄúAnd need update recommendations things saying sufficient. masks people high risk wearing need improved.‚Äù

People high risk need wear n95 masks go indoors. live little Russia NYC vote Republican.  yeah man, WV fucking crushed getting vaccines first started distributed. love goofy lil state much, made even sweeter. [ol party switcher jim justice things right Moderna hear bit likely give side effects dose 2, that, little difference. Get it! don‚Äôt understand that. wear mask it‚Äôs bad second don‚Äôt need never again. Texas let 'er rip 7% partial vaccination, including opening everything rescinding mandates - mask, distancing, capacity. Fortunately people businesses populated areas kept supposed to, helped keep spread down, we're still around 23% fully vaccinated. vaccination sites shut unfilled unkept shot appointments, ironic difference February.

Once head rural, people operating like 2019. case death rate currently previous average, seeing inverse drop increased vaccination. Last polling said around 40% adults refusing vaccine. think depressing would get sick vaccine we've spent year protective measures, depressing would virus escapes vaccine despite effort. Central Texas recently discovered variant positive test college student...  What‚Äôs hospitalization rate one jab. Gotta close zero? assure global entry knows entire ticket last leg. evade buying completely independent tickets rechecking baggages etc would huge pain so. Slightly tangential, wonder offered pay people pick card, would get people vaccinate greater numbers. case entire US big citifies college town liberal small town rural areas conservative. ever asked vaccination records 4 schools attended. ü§î wife too, already gotten it. Hah. It‚Äôs ridiculous. father who‚Äôs 62 lives Hamburg hasn‚Äôt vaccinated...meanwhile, study US getting second dose tmrw. issues symptoms Moderna? local office giving shot taking walk ins waiting lines. itially thinking pfizer. young women odds hospitalised covid developing blood clot pretty similar; young woman would skip AZ pick another one choice. Otherwise AZ perfectly fine.   studies. Yes. fantastic. However; Help skeptics push transparency. Earn trust people. Unite them. Dont allow billion dollar social media industries 'fact-checking team' delete masses posts people talking bad experiences ""misinformation"". Manipulating biased media makes people skeptic. Stop hypocrites assume skeptics evidence blind faith. Yes didnt read entire article didnt check references didnt either. skimmed it. funding particular studies? studies suggest opposites? dont studies get mass media coverage? lets allow people ask questions. 
Once transparency somewhat achieved skeptics join ensuring everybody right.  higher now.

There also incidents although they're giving numbers yet. seems still inline likely Marks Dr. Janet Woodcock, F.D.A.‚Äôs acting commissioner, said clotting disorder appeared nearly rare hoped would recommended received cases, isn‚Äôt avalanche,‚Äù Dr. Woodcock said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing big surge, great Marks declined specify many new cases confirmed, said rate disorder expected higher ‚Äúin terms order vaccine? Pfizer Moderna unbelievably safe. Like, shit. That's exactly supposed work.

If folks want go back normal, gotta something help end it.

Crazy needs said, looked like slick move. yeah today decent uptick, hopefully nothing trend anything. Probably blip. Understood! I‚Äôm sorry loss wish best luck! use AZ old people theres solution. lot countries enough vaccines choose from. Oxford study disagrees primarily electronic health network used US. got Moderna vaccine back March buying broccoli asked pharmacy extras missed appointments. US made lot mistakes people stupid regards covid far vaccine goes (in Florida*) ....if dont yet scheduled either dont want work 7 days week time. Kids getting shots (16-17) 12-15 approved mid-May (before run adults). Trials already underway young 6 believe. Remember started hey wash hands  whole point masks preventing carriers spitting droplets aeresols That's case couple weeks now. think saw somewhere like 70k doses Mississippi folks kind sitting hands ass. 

I cant speak area Florida pretty damn easy get it. even need appointment anymore. Nicotine binds ACE-2. receptors Covid binds to. means Covid would need compete nicotine order infect, infected smokers higher expression ACE-2. hypothesis makes sense. really bad dizzy spells almost passed out. I've never experienced anything like honestly really scared me. (I would gone doctor I'm uninsured American...) one denying difficulty meeting doses expected. I‚Äôm giving clarity difficult manufacturing companies normally happens doesn‚Äôt show news every paper.

The vaccine worked shortages multiple countries never news. congresspeople ask criteria end rules, refuses provide any, repeatedly, think becomes clear ""we're ready recommend now"" close to, identical to, ""we'll never recommend change"". 

It abundantly clear criteria NIAID CDC willing publicly share order remove recommended restrictions. either answer (which means they're incompetent) they'll never recommend removing restrictions (which means they're unrealistic, least consistent CDC's unrealistic recommendations [no red meat cooked well-done, alcohol child-bearing-age women, etc]). 

I think I'm misinterpreting Fauci's statements all, I'm giving benefit doubt like are. isn‚Äôt exactly solution people live India. international sub know. need pee poop eventually federal government one.  would masks even get aerosol particles? thought small get through. whole point masks stop droplets says really contribute spread? Thank you. reasoning behind article Source that? receive bill all. get vaccine? lodge complaint. Feel free reference website: participate CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program contractually agree administer COVID-19 vaccine regardless individual‚Äôs ability pay regardless coverage status, also may seek reimbursement, including balance billing, vaccine recipient.‚Äù¬† Biden enough hair really mohawk.

I would love know- experience tinnitus? We‚Äôre going benefit colleges requiring vaccinations. It‚Äôs great. hope institutions get board requirement.  frustrating even female ob/gyn would say that!

I've done quite bit reading around it, seems 2 theories make sense. 

The first endometrium actually part immune system (yeah, never knew either) ""mobilized"" immune response like parts body is.

Maybe paper additional confirmation. 

Maybe heart radio best source date vaccine information. also think restrictions removed regardless whether area actually reached herd immunity, certain point, remaining vulnerable covid choice you‚Äôve made it‚Äôs one‚Äôs responsibility protect that.

Then let choose get kids vaccinated. then, restrictions remain cases haven‚Äôt fallen off. reduce transmission zero individual level, limit transmission enough new infected person infected less one person average, new ‚Äúgeneration‚Äù virus smaller.

That‚Äôs I‚Äôm talking about, actually matters public health epidemiological perspective. Given sub we‚Äôre in, I‚Äôd expect people able grasp that.

The population level effect matters. kind piece shit be... Except case new variant evades RT-PCR tests beginning. people may genuinely think tested negative, test positive later. also need states lift restrictions vaccinated people. would hard enforce catch someone lie vaccinated, messaging ""If fully vaccinated, go back everything March 2020."" Even don‚Äôt vaccinate 70+ people. Often appointments available. Germany total failure. answer government lockdowns police. meanwhile people die. comparison? misinformation?

There argument saying large number people get less effective first dose get second doses, virus might higher likelihood evolving defeat vaccination.

There's also argument countries want make vaccine policy strategy gone rigorous trial. Yeah, kind weird would go partial.

Plus, need give time take effect. 70% full + 2 weeks. scares me. plenty supply many people hesitant get vaccinated. sure change communication get shots arms.

Better chance winning lottery, believe. worth, dumb question all, especially day age extraordinary levels vaccine hesitancy. know armpit could hurt shot saw doctor post somewhere people general risk blood clots various reasons. don‚Äôt know kind news big deal 168 deaths millions enough make concern. kinds deaths related vaccine? know, ones don‚Äôt want us know about... Thanks totally got tinnitus pandemic suspected covid early hospital went access testing yet. worked events industry constantly flying interacting coworkers also constantly traveled right shutdown. every headline vaccines use word ‚Äújab‚Äù? like journalism handbook says everyone must use word describe specific thing?

Test accurate done soon infection. know latest development, 5-7 days infection minimum read reduce significantly odd false negative. Basically tested negative could say: 5 days sampling probably it. tell little time after, would need test every day that.

So test prior departure upon arrival mean filter cases, all.

This place: LOL KNOW BOOSTERS EVER   hard tell, possible psychosomatic symptoms compounding long covid care collective good. people get vaccine, better herd immunity, protect vulnerable. Hopefully vaccine prevents long term issues first successful vaccine then? Like without phases testing, first get approved whether premature looking big picture. 100% population affected lockdown: fear, unemployment, social isolation, depression, drug abuse, etc even though 99% people contract Covid fully recover. 

If 1% vaccines administered adverse reaction, 600 million vaccines administered, that‚Äôs 6 million injured patients. Covid death toll 500k. OK people suffer Non-Covid reasons? describes symptoms almost exactly. (Second dose Moderna, male, early 40s) FDA &amp; vaccine manufacturers already looking expedited approval process boosters become necessary

So yes would need tested, full scale trials. What's difference ""full approval""? dad got vaccine weeks ago, he‚Äôs nonstop ringing ears ever since. researched side effect people ringing months far hasn‚Äôt gone away. anecdotal experience, I‚Äôve seen vaccine troublesome. get side effects rare, real. lockdown never end, bad much people still think health. think so. That's military, apparently. That's soldiers allowed decline COVID vaccine host vaccines required. know study talking conflating anything. 80% protection symptomatic infection 14 days plus first dose 90% protection symptomatic infection 2nd shot Re: long term side effects. considered development clinical trials vaccines. clinical trials set certain amount data would available participants received final dose. Possible long-term adverse effects vaccines expected present least month, 2 months, final dose, waited data available making decision whether vaccines safe effective use.

So perhaps something challenge whether substance truly unknown, planet first vaccine type cusp 1800 (That's typo) humanity working vaccines since then. We've eliminated smallpox.

Once SPF (sun protection factor) goes 30, increase protection negligible, according Skin Cancer Foundation. long ago, SPF went high 15 30. However recent years, sunscreen manufacturers arms race, marketing products SPF 70 100 even higher. Unfortunately, high SPF give people false sense security assume, say, SPF 70 twice effective SPF 30, far true. 

""If look real-world studies people actually putting sunscreen on, SPF 50 probably best terms getting protection want,"" Board-Certified Dermatologist Dr. Bobby Mansouri said. ""Once get higher numbers SPF 70, SPF 100, diminishing returns much sun protection get."" That‚Äôs cool! Yeah, global pandemic holding door open Kroger whatever. I'm mistaken statement said people prepared receive booster shot sometime end year, little bit different. Thats managing peoples expectations. people think get 1 covid vaccine they're good life...we know yet. mean, need new flu shot every year.

I'd say goes anywhere 3-7/10 ""loudness"", kind hard rank subjective things like T. that's problem lies pegging lifting restrictions metric. need entire adult population vaccinated, would need wait minimum approval emergency use minors enough taken reach 70%, even Covid rates drop unthreatening levels. Obviously common sense decision would likely made point...I would hope...but reach point Covid poses greater threat flu, better back life normal. dumbasses downvoting idiotic. probably even know LaVeyanism is. Someone telling truth. Clinical trials 2023 zero liability baby come missing limb. Tough choice thing I'd highlight - doom-and-gloom way - significant difference vaccine ""sufficient"" efficacy vaccines super-high efficacies we've seen initial mRNA results, comes complementary measures. (admittedly small-n) example OP, vaccine efficacy particular variant 75%. That's still _great_ efficacy vaccine, raise percentage population need vaccinated get us sufficient herd immunity, may mean universal masking still needed cases drop, least continued universal masking would drop cases faster. (Whether tradeoff, everyone least choice become almost completely protected hospitalization death COVID, worthwhile not, different question one pointedly _not_ addressing here.) phobia needles no.... really think does. really work go get covid vaccine people calling ""jab"" place really helping things.

But, private university decided requiring vaccinations. also us teaching campus person much whole thing. make argument public health issue best interest everyone involved, would correct, still requiring vaccinations students.  Ok, you‚Äôre disregarding data article commenting on, got it. open then? I'm scientist too, I'm rightfully sick people know first thing topics readily dismissing findings actual experts hand. may blunt, basic, factual questions asked. We've spent last year sugarcoating responses conspiracy theorists nutjobs. worked well us. 

There's material difference attacking someone pointing odds concerns unfounded. allow person Operating Room watch surgeon's shoulder ""have concerns"", act like opinion merit voice baseless concerns peer-reviewed studies widely accepted scientific community? Asking someone arrived concerns scientific pedigree (or lack thereof) may political way handle things, think we've caught many flies honey particular instance.

Can't bothered. Chile starting issues vaccinating hesitant 50 years old, especially week news (AstraZeneca Coronavac effectivity). I'm realising sub's news trend going globally, too.

I wonder what's gonna happen start vaccinating 30 years old lower.

Something that's talked what's going happen *everyone vaccinated.* going die? guess vaccine skeptics pandemic deniers? Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Fear sells. extremely antisocial behavior young person doesn‚Äôt .4% chance dying Covid. all. Same, felt every joint/bone injury I‚Äôve ever had. pull over, get car stretch driving day after. alien DNA upgrades doubt. shame placing burden vaccination young, instead makings adults, bear real responsibility risk, responsible vaccination.

It's like climate change. Let's make sure children solve problem created difficult us. H1N1 vaccine speedily developed, subsequently aggressively administered Finland H1N1 epidemic caused severe narcolepsy number teens children. known long term trial. H1N1 never became issue globally, arguably risk poorly managed.

I think goes without saying long term studies absolutely necessary medicine, people right point out.

The risks always balanced. high risk contracting Covid, vaccine safer bet. True, 95% efficacy mean vaccine prevent incoming transmission all. China - joke you? Biden say? remember report vaccines went UC Davis grad school 2012 maybe lost mess documents search high low for. UK full lockdown three months (you argue wasn‚Äôt proper lockdown hell lot restrictive US) suspect immunological, like immune system gets stuck self perpetuating inflammatory cycle.

It looks lot like ""chronic lyme"" me, still debated whether still actual infection yet understood auto-immune thing.

They frequently seek treated repeat courses doxycycline, along antibiotic effective Borrelia bacteria also anti-inflammatory properties.

I personally think kind inflammatory cycle interrupted kind intervention I'm genuinely surprised still much firm science this. time tell, tend agree you. 

California likely widespread natural immunity communities vaccination rates lacking; poorer communities, POC, etc.

It high vaccine rates boot, making cases sink like rock.

NY also seeing rapid drop last two weeks well, likely similar reasons.

This also suspect WA increasing numbers (although nothing drastic), low infection rates throughout whole thing there's likely less natural immunity vaccine rates reached critical mass yet. put processes track people asked everyone arrives carry negative RT PCR test. practically ground wanted people smooth experience possible. turned blind eye requirement tests.

Focus government make event success, want limit number visitors. gave birth April 14th I'm getting first shot Sunday! wanted wait need Tylenol/Ibuprofen pain relief blunt immune response. feel comfortable getting vaccine pregnant either, able work home minimize contact others. 

My decision likely would different potentially exposed COVID every day, way vaccine harmful developing embryo/fetus virus itself. fair point. long term effects known.

im right try experimental medicine, dying severely ill patient. whatever them. 

with long term studies, fda approval mean nothing. forcing healthy children take lunacy/tyranny. avg age covid death higher national age death, world gone mad. dont care many brainwashed people believe lies. shove vaccine ass. 

stockpiles building up, people refusing take jab. maybe next fake pandemic take one. Actually strong evidence vaccinated massively reduces transmission. I' even going bother feeling concern go beyond hype stage find more... Mask mandate probably outlast tier system

Everyone agree closing business actually hurt people even it‚Äôs necessary.  hand, mask mandate really hurts people‚Äôs feelings allowing businesses open faster RSV. common potentially severe respiratory virus young children.

I‚Äôd say thank Bibi fuck guy. Thanks Biontech/Pfizer medical crews horrible year higher chance getting infected asymptomatic, showing symptoms big fear Pretty hard!

Who going decide essential travel, going verify it? someone India says mother died, someone US says father Brazil death bed, verified? Pop. 1 billion, average age 29, 50% aged 25. think one two might make through. Seems like studies different populations time frames. Unfortunately consider variants driving efficacy Scientist helped develop Pfizer-BioNTech Covid vaccine agrees third shot needed immunity wanes

A business agrees buy product. Got captain.


Unless peer reviewed paper this, we're still we-dont-know phase. Oh can‚Äôt find vaccine appointment now... I‚Äôll wait late May earliest even able apply vaccination, probably wait month longer actually snag appointment. India comma way.
Although check marks (Lakh Crore) bit off. vaccinated still get COVID. severity symptoms may less still real get covid even though vaccinated. high case environment, like India right now, makes sense take risk. low case environment alternatives available vulnerable vaccinated, gets harder justify. 'alternatives available' that's especially important - AZ nothing. Go Cal Poly!! Buzzfeed. Yeah, used verb context. People refer getting vaccine ""getting jabbed"" one ever calls ""getting shot"" ""getting shotted"".

It's kinda like difference drinking punch punched. That's look rates rather raw case numbers.  

US sitting 200 daily cases per million UK 40 daily cases per million. Yeah googled according indianexpress, around 30% tests false negative. That's ridiculously higher thought would (&lt;1%). makes much likely test result relatives false negative. also means situation much worse thought is, even accounting underreporting. announced six months data hope means go full approval asap businesses require vaccination. hope places allow religious philosophical objections, medical. make employee prove religion forbids vaccination. really dislike people hide behind religion get something like this. new COVID-19 related deaths yesterday 63 new cases. Situation Israel getting better better. actually know single fully vaccinated person got Covid. Even it‚Äôs 95% effective still 5% chance getting (assuming situation unvaccinated person would get like prolonged close contact infected person).

That doesn‚Äôt change anything whether it‚Äôs good idea get vaccinated. It‚Äôs brained drastically reduce chances infection US great. done least 4-6 weeks ahead EU. That‚Äôs great effort. summer completely normal, probably well. 

You go back normal soon. 60% Israel look case numbers. Precisely. OK dose 1 dose 2 carries similar risks, risk vaccine becomes much higher risk serious COVID complications. growing evidence mostly prevents transmissions even symptoms. vaccine using Brazil? That‚Äôs bummer dude, hope goes away soon feel better. CDC advises people already gotten Covid still get vaccinated. Immune responses vaccines robust natural immunity. I've seen social media every wacky theory imagine backed similar BS. Bottom line people lie. maximum 4 months, supply that's coming June July likely going 3 month interval... Good. get second jab? I‚Äôve first one sure get second one? really, REALLY like hearing shit like this. wish could get everyone fucking page end thing. infuriating. I‚Äôm pretty sure saw 91% claim Moderna. Depends area. GP comes Derby city area got invited last week, jabs Sunday (wife Pfizer, got AZ). 40 nothing could move us list. think Fauci speculated bit ago would reapproved today. speculation could outdated Yeah, knew immediately anthrax fit description, get passed human human, also gonna give benefit doubt that's something people get vaccinated for. even varicella fits description, still pandemic it. yeah, I'm really sure person thinking vaccines for, besides flu polio. proof vaccinations attend schools. that? Fauci said possibly today Get Facebook. mean, really anything celebratory 2 weeks shot two regardless. India cases high changes risk/benefit - definitely worth getting vaccine offered ASAP (also believe reported VITT cases India?). 

If I'd running direction vaccine available. similar no-brainer UK February (when dose 1 AZ), cases low vulnerable vaccinated becomes different proposition... shocked US news agency printed headline mildly misleading sake gaining clicks ginning controversy. 

Shocked. I'm sure mean ""will protect incoming transmission virus."" sounds like insinuating vaccine protect Covid? using fair bit logic, request fake one get real one, receive asked, fake fake. received fake one, good you, got fake stamp.

aaand, i'm done thinking rest day suddenly little scary isn‚Äôt it? Im nervous going gym like kid nervous starting new school. earlier figures effectiveness preventing hospitalisation, latest figures infection.

Sweden 45% 14 days, UK 65% 21 days. Everyone else also loves trading despotic nations.

Now look daily new cases chart see drastic fall cliff happens line elderly started getting shots. not, oh people washing hands, effect vaccines! Yay! Yet still know 4 people refusing vaccine. Lame!

Also, maybe thats friendlier, I‚Äôve noticed strangers talk line again. like that. continues, gladly eat crow wrong. herd immunity only.. get it, super spreader. get jabbed think Swedish regions looking open vaccinations everyone May June Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions.

thrombocyte = thrombos (clot) + cyte (cell); i.e. platelet

thrombocytopenia = thrombocyte (platelet) + penia (low)

thrombotic = thrombos (clot) + otic (associated)

so ""thrombotic thrombocytopenia"" = clot-associated low-clotting-cell condition, whereas ""thrombocytopenia"" = low-clotting-cell condition (more generally). Ya'll seriously need stop complaining. Assuming rather young, among like 0.5% privileged people world right may marry volleyball. six months right? may get booster around 4-6 month mark protect baby grandpa.

For example, pfizer vaccine largely two components. lipid layer forms shell. RNA component inside shell. Lipids surround cellular membranes. RNA body uses instruction manual make single protein makes alive. nothing completely foreign body already . difference RNA contains instruction manual make COVID viral spike proteins teaches immune system fight covid. 

If get infected covid, body also see spike protein + much could deadly since replicates. 

You make sound like complete mystery scientists stumbled upon discovered works without mechanistic understanding scientists winging it. ignorance astounding. Learn biology.

Even tens thousands people dying vaccine, many many died die Covid. even logic looking number deaths, still settle ‚Äúvaccine bad‚Äù? friend pregnant reactions Covid vaccine. I'm pregnant extremely tired bit achey mine. Everyone different, seems. think expectations unrealistic.

Remember start pandemic? covid cases started cropping particular location, doctors reviewing previous patients see whether symptoms, recognised coronavirus labelled properly right tests done. all, nobody knew coronavirus actually country, necessarily known looking for.

The sort thing happened here. vaccines rolled out, monitoring system put place track adverse reactions. millions doses given out, sorts symptoms reported nobody knows whether significant. Eventually start see repeated pattern symptoms related clotting, becomes apparent serious, researchers comb back early reports see whether simply spotted time. Maybe terminology used quite same. Maybe combination symptoms quite same. researchers know they're looking for, much easier find.

If they're pregnant - may make sense stay home safe, since pregnant anyway, give birth baby. always vaccinate baby feel like want to, I'm saying - I'd rather wait pregnant (even though I'm man, there's tiny chance ever happen)

One intake nurse, family doctor, well 2 vets, concured corona family virus possibility. could remember right term... Zoonosis think. common cross barriers. normally group colds.

Primary symptoms sore throat, sneeze, feel like intense allergy symptoms. remotely life threatening three us (myself two cats). worried though sore throat bad us, went around twice (I careful enough break chain). ended seemed like light pneumonia. can't say anything *""brain fog""* unfortunately. COVID people could weak immune system make specific antibodies. Therefore can't detected it. person's immune system proves capable defeating disease tools already available necessarily create specific antibodies dedicated disease. I'm pretty sure covid last March (tests avaliable time, like flu I've ever had). first shot, feel slight burning sensation chest like much, much milder version one covid. cleared within day. I've also body aches, lingered past two weeks. Weirdly, pain injection site, still ended massive bruise around it. IDK what's that.

Getting COVID vaccine shot getting COVID immune response except getting vaccine much much lower chance killing getting COVID.

United States, never full medical system top that, COVID *very* deadly people go without oxygen. hypoxic severe COVID, likely die without care. Hypoxia medical emergency.  Well always designed single use, makes sense me. I‚Äôve never seen pre 2020 source favor reusing masks. do. 

No don't. That's said contractual obligations UK first foremost, due amount spent, UK paid first. says contract signed.

Funnily enough, also wrong. apparently able send 700k doses UK production Australia February. think UK contract specifies can't supply EU?

And able partly supply Australia, send single dose dozens customers overseas? blatantly obvious why: political decisions, commercial wanted to, could simply block export these

To purpose? UK can't use ingredients can't make mRNA vaccines. would mean would longer get Pfizer, mainstay UK whereas UK paid way per dose

Here's thing EU UK contracts: signed time. contain ""best effort"" clauses. EU contract specifically states nothing impedes AZ fulfil contract them. EU contract specifically lists UK plants manufacturing sites. AZ says can't provide jabs UK EU, lying start.

Further, said many times AZ UK government, Oxford, AZ sells jabs cost, profit. yet everyone complains EU paying enough. square circle? saying pay more, get ""better"" contract? would call bribe, Whereas EU actively stockpiling AZ, using them, blocking exports left right centre. 

What? Complete bollocks. handful countries temporary halts, couple others decided use AZ all, handing others. complete myth EU sitting huge stockpile AZ doses ‚Äî¬†they jabbing fast EU even said would help expand capacity, proceeded provide 0 funding.

That's rumor. even explicitly contract EU help AZ can't ramp production own. bear mind EU already provided 340M upfront, AZ delivered anywhere near target. much money EU supposed hand can't anything it? Fucking good. think companies forgot train well. Nope. Disposing masks patients common sense. Using masks day long cooking One Pots insanity we're getting away from. didn‚Äôt pay attention. article argues there's much difference, legally speaking, full emergency approval.

Weird expectations massive weddings never stopped either, Modi‚Äôs huge campaign rallies Getting first pfizer today, get protection 1st? Alabama, Kansas, Kentucky Oklahoma sure far behind. we're back square one... that's way we've ALWAYS done it. Insanity  think even see cases coming winter see much death hospitalization many people 65 getting shot. might rise cases think truly scary metrics hit anywhere near earlier levels.  think mean spike like last winter spike like flu season. 1. mRNA vaccines target spike protein.

2. spike protein needs fit human ACE2 receptors infect people.

3. Human ACE2 receptors going change.

4. spike protein can't mutate *that* much, virus infectious.

5. Ergo, mRNA vaccines remain reasonably effective quite time, despite variants appearing. hadn‚Äôt Pfizer available convenient location would willing get J&amp;J one. risk incredibly small. Also want able vaccinate high risk groups like homeless need one shot solution. seeing what's happening body cremations India seem outlandish Serious question, maybe overly paranoid one.

But yes, I‚Äôm anti vaxxer. definitely know you‚Äôre talking thing natural unnatural immunity.

Ohhhhh see. you‚Äôre inferring I‚Äôm anti vaxxer simply used term ‚Äúnatural immunity.‚Äù

Willful ignorance something proud of, friend. I'm you. like constantly fear dark. Yes mutations happen, yes probably reduce efficacy vaccines. know however somehow magically spread, even unlikely wild pace render existing immunity (whether natural via vaccine) completely useless. Meanwhile technology, manufacturing capacity, experience update vaccines needed. quite possible years we're going getting boosters prevalent ""problematic"" strains. None end world. Right need establish baseline immunity. happens next problem another day. Drink lots water! need carrots summer sticks fall.

Try carrots letting cruises sail vaccinated passengers only. Work large companies offer vaccine discounts. Public service commercials real creativity popular stars like Morgan Freeman, Rock Tom Hanks. Sporting events full capacity vaccinated fans.

Everyone world seems ignored Pfizer quoted saying likely need third shot. likely period time fall first wavers needing shot. enough? still aren‚Äôt enough regular vaccines.  ü§î

I‚Äôm best shape life becoming logistics issue well. industries diverting supplies hospitals. shortage tankers transport oxygen. government airlifting 24 tankers Germany. Look pictures festival tell dangerous not.

Also decent chunk festival indoors. Hotels lodges crowded. Trains, buses going crowded.

Also  full immunity wouldn‚Äôt need second shot. 

I‚Äôm realizing confusion might ‚Äútwo weeks second shot.‚Äù understood mean getting second shot 2 weeks I‚Äôm sure correct. That‚Äôs assuming people haven‚Äôt seen family friends it‚Äôs really exciting haven‚Äôt stopped White House Press Secretary's response source. word play pretty much cleared imo. sure trying get here. responding someone said UK lower case rates US population smaller, explained person used case rates rather cases. made assertions cause was. Yeah glad know vaccines working!! suppose don‚Äôt consider well friends, family, neighbors, economy rest world. virus likely zero effect them.

Misinformation. virus zero risk political, vaccine

Wtf shit even mean. opted get J&amp;J since 1 shot. It‚Äôs annoying know 1 shot Pfizer would given even better immunity. Agreed. reason I‚Äôll wear mask outdoors I‚Äôm going somewhere need mask nowhere else store face.

Sucks work covered federal mask mandate I‚Äôm fueling airplanes outside 90¬∞ Florida heat mask on. remember one emerging Long Island assumed UK. knows. know it‚Äôs important grand scheme, don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm vaccinated now. Unfortunately, wish sooner. Could really helpful earlier large vaccination rollout, can‚Äôt say see becoming ubiquitous. thing happened me. Fucking weird virus behaves, right? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Let guess, working home come relatively unscathed, fuck everyone else struggled get food table risked lives so. need ""chill."" right? Asymptomatic mildly symptomatic cases flu don‚Äôt 10-30% chance becoming long term health problems months initial infection. need learn long term effects, believe continued mitigation measures justified based raw case numbers risk. think government (more Florida states true everywhere) focused death focused long term risks. Indian hospitals forced crowd source oxygen via Twitter. Specifically ISIC hospital nations capital. got help last hours. Problem incentives yet individual get vaccinated besides health. private schools, companies, entities require vaccines saying yes absolutely private mandate wacky hat Wednesdays

And even might want take legal liability. workplace decided potential risk company high mandate vaccine still EUA. They‚Äôll reevaluate they‚Äôre fully approved use. ones who've got 1 shot almost definitely take second. think challenge getting first shots out. Quintuple mutant joined chat. I‚Äôm NY...Western part it...we actually story news day walk appointments starting extra supply...

I know people want can‚Äôt get it...but think we‚Äôre rapidly approaching point 90% unvaccinated choosing get rather can‚Äôt get it... Time mobile outreach. Start pushing vax like ice cream bars mobile health vans.

Catch ""impulse buyers"". :) Didn‚Äôt recover like year ago wife? Man whats ""experts"" going TV still claiming NEED 80%+ vaccination rates? 

Israel shown herd immunity might start showing early 60% (or maybe 65%) vaccine plus natural immunity. 

The US likely needs around 50% vaccination rate get 65% immunity natural immunity included.

Obviously better, feel throwing crazy numbers like 80%+ makes people already apathetic towards getting vaccine care even less.

If told people 50% population vaccinated non mask restrictions lifted 60%, masks gone, would see flood people lazy rush get vaccine. 

Instead hear 80% think ""meh whats point wont get there"" CDC tracker considers fully vaccinated soon get last dose series doses. It‚Äôs shocking anyone wouldn‚Äôt want shot. damn excited got mine. Tonight I‚Äôm going see friend also fully vaxxed. going eat first time since early last year. wouldn‚Äôt want that? get hug friends family  ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è yep, crowd wants one shot...like come people Lmao New York variant quite time now. first appeared samples month November. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

Kids went remote, grades went shit. - we're already discussing summer school No, worst part actually scheduled 2022 (last kumbh 2010), brought forward one year advice ""seers"". 

Jfc Right. Even America we're still trying figure bad covid truly terms infections deaths, looking excess deaths help us get idea. I've heard similar stories Italy, especially smaller, rural towns. 

India's problems unique, magnified size socio-economic issues. Real world studies using public health data. Israel, UK Chile good examples places done this. Many scientists different opinions you. Would love see debate around stuff. transparency. believe everything IPCC publishes gospel material published private sector evil - that‚Äôs science

That‚Äôs religion friend living Mumbai. appear super fucked. Give children sucker good. Last time heard people escort oxygen space si-fi movie. People pass Times Square aren‚Äôt people need walk clinics. Manhattan problem demand. Put clinics Bronx deep Brooklyn. much hesitancy there. biggest event festival supposed happen next week. still ongoing. many devotees head back home. get going? Anecdotal, since I‚Äôve back gym I‚Äôve much, much better mood. 

I peloton dumbbells home, gym game changer  Also, least area, know many people able get county health department mass vaccination sites. person know got shot teacher. Everyone else, grandparents, friends, etc got signing directly hospital Walgreens. India currently desperate ban export USA preventing increase vaccine production would need. makes sense one reporting that. 

That said, knowing vaccination campaign slowing us, might time consider least slowly open valve exports. need ship everything bits would help without endangering second dose remaining people get vaccinated.  People won‚Äôt get get something it, don‚Äôt blame them.  
 
Even though I‚Äôm vaccinated already, known expected act though didn‚Äôt get least another 6 months(still wearing masks, still social distancing, etc) would far less likely get it. Yes, mask mandate still exists inside, people usually wear public places I'm seeing. every thing pretty much back normal - live shows, parties, theatre, education system. Thanks well wishes, hope see results countries too! Megasites nice people want stay cars. people choice. particular vaccine. Agreed. It‚Äôs shitty, fear-mongering title  iirc Mississippi legit worst state hesitancy low vaccination rates overall may passed peak (emphasis 'may') make wave over. Infections still 30k day, declaring dangerously moronic. Disagree point #1: although they‚Äôre currently eligible vaccine, children still catch spread COVID. Therefore, it‚Äôs useful correct include denominator vaccination rates.

Good think I‚Äôm vaxxed Clearly youve heard 40k universe Next stop: 333,333,333! TIL..thanks I'm 2 weeks 2nd shot, safe go living like covid real? know much ask early but. 

Mind sending volunteers vaccines sea? imo pressured get sinovac.

Especially nowadays, random act kindness would lot. Aren‚Äôt going pretty large amount cases deaths right now? Hopefully. question remain: people still want J&amp;J? unfortunate happened vaccine, many ""safer"" option offered trusted company. Treat like cigarette smoke. circumstance person smoking could smell smoke, could potentially exposed virus. hangs air too, fine particles.

Wear eye protection. Ten percent risk catching eyes. Eye glasses provide good bit protection.  Damn. Thanks reply That‚Äôs easy say hindsight. turned larger issue? anything, reassure people safety monitoring working. choice vaccine take Pfizer moderna Yeah hard time believing this. might true single emission bunch respiratory droplets. concentration covid droplets 6 ft away infected person going higher 60 ft continuously emitted. Depends ask, really. valid excuse companies who'll fire getting it? lol, apparently not. know high degree confidence vaccinated chances getting infected detectable level decrease dramatically. 100% reduction 80-90% reduction (with mRNA vaccines). 

If infected detectable level almost certainly cannot spread virus meaningful way. 

So least know around vaccinated people much much safer around unvaccinated people without knowledge infection status. 

Further evidence vaccinated later become infected viral load lower average. likely means ability spread virus even become infected reduced. 

All doubtful chance spread go zero 80-97% reduction likeliness spread possible. adults world can't get vaccinated. Canada 40+ far. J&amp;J got green light again. got push reading comment.

Open everyone. Looks like don‚Äôt think significant risk women. warning women 50. Generally 2-3 days. fine end weekend. 

I second Moderna shot 2 days ago feel effects 24 hours later. Felt sluggish, dazed weak. Left early work go lie bed several hours. Felt fine today. 1st shot fine second hit hard. taken following day off. Got first dose Pfizer today. expecting feel shot based past vaccinations... Super fast, felt like quick prick something injected. normal? forgot put bandaid arm drive through, painless whole thing started second guessing even got jab lol. normal Pfizer light quick prick, rather feeling injected arm/muscle? ""The research adds growing number findings suggesting need chill relax"" really not. understand math behind risk (and, HCP should) there's question. also like working Ford driving Honda. believe none people died given Heparin. Oh yeah. I'm fully aware I'm problem here. Well Pfizer available 16-17 year olds. Moderna J&amp;J remains 18+. early speculate k-12, that‚Äôs also different beast since effects seem (somewhat) limited adult populations. early contraction lead something later stage life like chicken pox/shingles? so, certainly, that‚Äôs decades out. Right flu vaccine fully approved? covid vaccines still EUA believe made mandatory yet employees. could wrong. Death long-term negative outcome COVID-19. many people facing long-term problems loss smell, tinnitus, fatigue. We're still learning possible long-term brain lung damage. vaccines appear prevent almost certainly stopping virus moving lungs, remaining basically head cold even unlikely event get infected.

As something terrible happening future: main concern vaccines acute reaction, allergic reaction ingredient. ""Terrible"" things arise getting exposed medication vaccine 1-2 times; incidents long-term negative impacts drugs emerges drugs consistently taken long-term. 40k+ people mRNA vaccines ~9 months now, hundreds others participants earlier Moderna mRNA vaccine clinical trials, confident nothing bad going suddenly start happening. mRNA works body well understood, going start giving people cancer 5 years. point, people absolutely understand risk. living rock. Would trade 1 year life back percentage chance hospitalized? Absofuckinglutely. Especially young person, elderly vaccinated I'm happy take risk live normal life. That‚Äôs fair Well droplet transmission less contained 6 feet. year ago, that‚Äôs assumed spread primarily. problem also spreads via aerosols, really confined 6 feet. data supporting aerosol spread emerged past 6 months so. Sadly seems way. Reckless behavior catch covid recover whatever big deal already even reckless behavior think pause happened begin with. Get word health officials they‚Äôre dealing best treatments.  People history fainting needle procedures also unlikely feel comfortable mass event. nothing ""gubment."" I'm going Walgreens across street walk case issue. doubt faint vaccine, fainted injuries often ever since IV insertion failing like 10 times eventually went hand. people like genetic fainting issue problems, going private doctor's office would still lot preferable bad experience Walgreens worker trained administer shots 2 days ago. definitive proof plus common sense vaccines significantly reduce transmission. 

If you‚Äôre looking less skeptical side, could say public health authorities using abundance caution making blanket statement want totally sure. 

On skeptical side, could say public health authorities don‚Äôt want people stop mitigation measures, they‚Äôre totally forthcoming. 

But look experts really study transmission vaccines, it‚Äôs clear vaccines significantly reduce transmission. zero spread? No, nothing zero, it‚Äôs enough make difference.  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Yadayadayada, yes every vaccine assume every medication brings risk‚Äòs.  Got first dose yesterday many f** variants there? science says vaccines work. End story. woman 50 concerned, switch Pfizer. rest, risk like zero. 6 days I'm right you. Literally counting down. mean, long list want? 

Outdoor transmission. Post vaccinated transmission. School based transmission 6 vs 3 ft social distancing guidelines there. Mask usage restaurant settings. Temperature screenings. Eyewear protection recommendations. Single vs double masking. goes on.

There many areas CDC officials opined clear evidence based standard cant even keep track. one knows actual number is, imo double looking many cases deaths know network network big. problem likely self resolve also. women reporting symptoms effected reported asked they've taken JJ vaccine given Herepin. say yes, they'll approach differently perhaps reduce eliminate mortality.

What we've seen contract tracing studies restaurants get infected well beyond 6 feet closer general, likely infected. depends lot specifics ventilation system airflow within room. contact tracing studies, there's usually sort fan blowing air infected person towards infectee.

I think there's documented case 60 feet.

The cigarette smoke analogy good one. Suppose bar one person smoking. sitting across table someone smoking, they're blowing smoke face, going breathe lot smoke. next table, six feet away, get lot less, still some. 60 feet away, ventilation, eventually smell builds up. upwind person smoking, smell much less downwind.

Our governments (and thus, populace elected said governments) need demand funding research mRNA vaccine tech, production / storage / distribution. two differ principally Moderna vaccine uses engineered set lipids microencapsulation permits higher storage temperatures (-20 ¬∞C vs -70 ¬∞C

Isn't Pfizer also stored higher temperatures now? Yes female. That‚Äôs I‚Äôm even scared! invite attend niece's 10th birthday party tomorrow. seen year. I'm vaccinated attendees, all. they're coming NJ's hot spot. I'm really unsure. I've waited year see parents socially distanced (medical professionals), I'm ""But..."" point should, hit demand peak plenty vaccines. would say Canada‚Äôs bad - recorded 360,000 vaccinations yesterday. Considering size population, that‚Äôs pretty good. I'm anti bigpharma curve looking plump hell. hope serves warning anybody thinks herd immunity way go.

I also hope election campaign killer.... context Vaccinations either term well recognised although UK tend use Jab rather Shot.

Out context though Jab makes think boxing Shot, depending state mind either drink (shot whisky good) gun (not good).

This thread made think words different meanings depending context. English word Set meanings 430. know idea high.  it‚Äôs contagious virus, long incubation time. Also every pandemic ends 1-2 years. Pretty sure Small Pox around 100 years finally eradicated it. Polio ravaged Americas early 1900s declared defeated 1994.

I personally blame companies do. going say AZ consistently failed say others. Sanofi GSK vaccine restart clinical trials messed adjuvant mixing. White House given faith J&amp;J meet dose goal CDC paused federal shots J&amp;J.

Sometimes want smash head wall.  Sadly lots Johnson voters. He's taking credit vaccine rollout dedicated NHS workers volunteers.   Sure--the pandemrix issue GSK. hot-button topic caused scientific community take hard look adjuvants (which since cleared anything narcolepsy cases). hear saying, think necessarily relevant cautionary tale situation couple reasons:  


* cut dry sounds. [No causal ever established, even multiple studies. Granted, absence evidence thing evidence absence--it may well case did. However, say vaccine triggered ""safety signal"" medical community set pause review. hundred people got narcolepsy, 90% live-virus variant vaccine. sounds like lot, smoking gun, especially since rate narcolepsy occurred ended around 1 18400, overall population received vaccine large begin with. 
* Narcolepsy autoimmune disorder. current prevailing theory happened comes [2015 study Stanford](http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2015/07/side-effect-of-flu-vaccine-yields-new-insights-into-narcolepsy.html), shows evidence mechanism might caused narcolepsy. turns likely case [microbial immune system mistakenly attacks part body shares similar protein microbe question. Narcolepsy likely caused immune system attacking hormone hypocretin. turns part H1N1 mimics portion hypocretin receptor. portion virus contained protein found much higher proportion pandemrix vaccine H1N1 vaccine time (Focetria), suggests pandemrix vaccine likely responsible. However, larger conclusion study draws link influenza narcolepsy. sum up, *there high likelihood people got narcolepsy vaccine would also gotten narcolepsy catching H1N1.*
* scientific community learned lot episode, difference test sizes H1N1 vaccine Covid vaccines massive. stage 2 trials, around 2k people tested pandemrix. case Covid, studies north 45k. study linked original article, N=36000 pregnant women, billion people taken vaccine worldwide. statistical perspective, means chances study misses anything vanishingly small. narcolepsy example brought up, length time really smoking gun (and again, hard call anything smoking gun, incidence rate small vaccine use discontinued almost immediately, meaning much data study). issue 2k people study. 2k people, matter long waited, none people would developed narcolepsy, since study 1-in-9 chance including anyone would extremely rare side effect begin with. That's large sample sizes important. 

I'm longitudinal studies. saying completely reasonable. think bit ridiculous people act like waiting scientific studies come later disregard really sound, **large** scientific studies coming now. pandemrix episode cautionary tale consumers avoid vaccines might magically long-term side effects future--it's cautionary tale vaccine researchers, clearly already took lessons heart designing massive studies used continue use test covid vaccines. developed Zika mRNA vaccine got fast tracked approval 2019.   worse part event happens every 12 years, year scheduled happen Explain please. probably bronchiolitis! kids tested positive RSV past, oldest struggled youngest.

The political messaging also extremely positive, especially Boris Johnson. Again, that's good older demographic (who tend lean right, might expect).

I saw someone point older British people tend greater respect authority compared Americans generation. I'm 100% sure that's true, definitely believe it. Rather rebelling sake rebelling, they're likely they're told, even they're massively enthusiastic it. catching covid motivation enough? half vaccinated got gave girlfriend wa fully vaccinated, moderate symptoms, none.

Congrats pregnant, I've got infant home myself--my wife clearly watching findings studies like closely, want sure wife's immunity shot pass child, understand caveats surround immunity, like last past wife stops breastfeeding, much immunity passed along, etc. 

Second, asking questions. ""expressing concerns"" showed complete disregard experts behind study. There's huge problem people wanting get vaccinated every internet expert share opinion trust it, they're skeptical ""long term effects"", etc. ask valid questions. someone started giving advice fix car, eventually ask mechanic engineer, you? asking someone disregards findings massive scientific study voice ""concerns"" somehow offensive? asking ""how know wot long term effects fetus"", would valid question valid answer.

Informed consent how? know yet exactly triggers clotting. risk picture way complicated N deaths / vaccines. ensure volunteer actually understands risks may facing? can't. One week full immunity second Pfizer shot. don‚Äôt even know want lol. Maybe arcade something find one open. think eradicated vaccines continue effect variants? see flu different group viruses different type vaccine, probably fairly small percentage population get annual flu shot. everyone Covid vaccine today would really hard spread mutate something vaccines can't protect against. might well say nothing eradicated vaccination, would untrue. uncertain how, still. article covers various scenarios pretty telling people we're really 50% mark pandemic. something people want hear, variants, vaccine rollouts re-openings happening (especially schools fall), think we're easily locked another year bouncing around measures, restrictions perhaps even lockdowns certain areas. there's answer getting downvoted. contributing nothing. Well, average person, bet left ball countries planet would consider AZ ""reliable supplier"". 

There vaccine producer managed fail constantly, every step: messed testing, lying, hiding side effects, PR, reactive communication authorities, vaccine factories authorisation, delivery. 

With delivery least, can't remember 1 ocassion actualy delivering agreed quantity agreed time. week failed deliveries Poland Ireland. I'm talking 10-20% less target, like 10-20% delivered. 

I'm really surprised organisation keeps CEO gang. know sure would jobless less 3 months failure rate would half theirs. data striking. study pretty flawed. 80% people get vaccine, can't drop pathetically minor interventions place. that's good enough incentive, know is. mandate vaccination, cases except allegry/similar medical reason taking shot would medically deleterious.

Experts say 70-90% required herd immunity. 

Removing protective measure reach immunity actively killing people. Much like reopening last year killed hundreds thousands people could lived we'd serious like Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam. 

Israel declining cases amid reopening reopened fully vaccinated people vaccine passports subject mandatory scanning. I'd fine similar measure US. People seem opposed.

Israel also dramatically significant protective measures did. encourage look history MRNA vaccines. You‚Äôll find long history adverse events prevented passing animals studies. want articles, I‚Äôll happy share doesn‚Äôt. US seniors 80% vaccinated 66-96% less susceptible catching virus adding cases world count. stop. We've top we're bottom. Feels good man far public messaging ""Vaccines useless nothing change, bother.""

Will stop this? one saying this, see saying enough I've actually noticed pattern. weird concern trolling. Viruses always mutating, could infectious trust knowing media there, attributing ""variants"" giving sensational monikers take focus away government's failings missteps. enough Biontech adults Germany

Your words god's ears. know posting stuff like means openly state can't basic maths, right? proud like 8% country vaccinated. puts top 10 world it‚Äôs still even close herd immunity. Covaxin used booster? Iowa Prison staff enters chat ...  mean maybe keep use one sick help give others, ya need everyone mandated used point. Immune compromised people die anything. don‚Äôt personally know any, won‚Äôt subject unknown side effects unknown person. 

I‚Äôm curious, think I‚Äôm immune Covid? going make extra vaccines going make them? India‚Äôs vaccine monsters already licensed western vaccines made house. Meanwhile Pfizer waived exclusive rights MRNA vaccine extent BioNTech find production partners make it. Likewise Moderna boosting production Europe. vaccine factories sitting idle could making shots? US Western Europe around size population look difference US. We're great. guess prideful. heard Rutgers parent complain university President Rutgers taking away ‚Äúchoice‚Äù requiring COVID vaccines Fall. handled well, among things telling FDA authorization probably emergency-based Fall. could think ‚Äúshe choose another school!‚Äù already vaccines. know expecting.  I'm - let's hopeful next week. early 30s, healthy, careful getting Covid risking side effects, albeit relatively small sound like good deal all. getting 80-90 percent people getting vaccinated. public knows this. Experts know this. Politicians know this. also see real life (Israel) much compliance needed order suppress virus. Israel nearing 60% they've open weeks plummeting cases.

Reopening occur everyone chance get shot.

This seeing places like California, Rhode Island, Connecticut already announce reopening plans. Waiting 80% people get vaccinated option. one thinks people don‚Äôt get vaccinated (health reasons aside) still want go restaurants etc selfish assholes. Southern California 23 million people. might close whole area includes LA San Diego. Way back when, cited studies suggesting heavier particles vapor mouths would sink within six feet lateral distance. major health organizations reaaally reluctant suggest virus could hanging onto smaller air particles would float rather sink. obviously know better.

But now, think main benefit puts inherent limit many people fit space. There's coffee shop go to, line space three four people standing six feet apart spills outside. Nobody police anything; people walk go ""Nope"" stand front door instead. actually great system, even though stated purpose really true. Literally opposed figuratively? Maybe want look word ""literally"" means.  Also look ""pride"" it. Good luck. Common. worries. thing ethical perspective? Yeah, dare Abbott open Texas 40 days ago covid cases balloon *checks notes* HALF West Virginia's per capita. Don‚Äôt worry European politicians thing.   know threshold immunity virus never reached. even comparable SARS-CoV-1 MERS. 

It theorized somewhere 70-90%. Although doctors guessed 60-70%, seems 70-90% commonly considered window. 

I'm targeting upper 50% range recognition due caution. EDC Vegas postponed October nothing afraid mRNA. find Pfizer shady company. Even recently put information find deceiving.

Got Pfizer round one Monday morning fine Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Last night woke headache extremely thirsty drank water went back sleep.

Besides isolated cases, US healthcare system wasn‚Äôt overwhelmed. Entire hospitals built covid didn‚Äôt even take patients. people hospitalized past year hospitalized covid. 

Another fun fact. americans die every year cancer died COVID total.  H.I. roughly 70% saying 80-90 Turn lungs abominable, blacked out, appaling, hollow masses even viruses want settle there!

 ~Start smoking today~ would imagine would get choose take AZ offered options left. bit confused comment though? scared mRNA really equally scared DNA AZ. new technologies fact, mRNA vaccines paper are, least, far less likely cause problems AZ/J&amp;J - effectively bundled less extra ‚Äòstuff‚Äô job. (Indeed also looks founded real life). 

Novavax true traditional vaccine bloody good one however. sure average person understands ‚Äúreliable supplier‚Äù means. Manufacturing vaccines usually country somewhere short doses company tries manage supply constraints. normal course business.

I imagine nightmare companies trying manufacture large amount doses timeframe never happened before. Supply always guessing game market dynamics determine many vaccines actually needed. company met monthly discuss supply assumptions market moving forward, mainly needed able signal supply chain felt may need doses MONTHS advance.

Each pharma companies trying manufacture doses get door ASAP also building/creating specific manufacturing lines time. THAT‚Äôs reason ability produce doses guessing game start. isn‚Äôt world say ‚Äúyou said would 100M doses date, they?‚Äù Everything guess could possibly produced.

Also immune suppressed people cannot take vaccine sometimes diseases carried animals. Whats EDC Yup, 5 people knew waited J&amp;J. cancel happened, went got Pfizer/Moderna, schedule out, etc. difference asking getting answer soon vs. asking conditions giving specific response.

If read message described two conditions make sense.

I want see end, can't keep eliminating extremely mild restrictions place every time reach new high plateau cases. That's killed 600k people past year. need stop that.

Surely theres barrier people coming high risk countries? negative test required? quarantine period? Anything?! sure please tell Meanwhile Canada, messaging basically opposite far.

We literally don‚Äôt know means long term don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good, we‚Äôre going hearing long time. agree you, sad avoiding death incentive enough. pretty clear (close medical consensus) blood clots real characteristic laboratory signature widespread clotting, low platelet counts, reaction PF4. basically happen (except administration heparin, drug) constellation symptoms diagnostic. 

Whether stop vaccinating young female patients important hospitals appreciate new syndrome treat like old clot could induce stroke kill someone. recognition public beneficial even fearmongering bad. politicians busy shipping countries make look benevolent. few. Perhaps spread continents. 6 clotting cases found among **1,402,712** doses administered (as April 12th) affected demographic (women aged 20-50). So, demographic, risk actually lot higher, since denominator lot smaller 6.8 million.

According CDC presentation last week, risk clotting J&amp;J vaccine found *3 times greater* would see general population (for age group). 

You view full CDC presentation slides (From April 14th): Indians blame USA.

1. ban started Trump era
2. India Govt ample time give orders procure raw materials advance. orders like overnight Amazon orders. get raw materials April one needs give orders advance Jan-Feb, Ofcourse Govt sleeping pushing blame game
3. India always option going 200 countries, dependent USA though?
4. USA seen 500K deaths twice number cases full right support people. Biden announced plan vaccinate 100% USA 4th July companies working it.
5. India got serious raw materials situation getting totally control. blamed USA instead.
6. Modi shifting blame. Modi's incompetent leadership lead this.
7. India recently many big gathering events like Farmers protest, Kumbh Mela, Election campaigns Ramazan prayers. Goverment firm policy advance. even government tries something look like going specific groups only. rarely wear mask outside. data doesn‚Äôt support all. certainly makes hesitant get kids vaccinated. Hopefully we‚Äôll know soon because, agree, I‚Äôm okay either. edited comment sources first observed there. scientific names like B1.234 hard remember. one dose number keeps creeping down. First everyone saying 90 percent one. 80. this. believed? Wow, that‚Äôs insanity me. posted body‚Äôs response thread. Graves‚Äô disease (hyperthyroidism) vaccine messed levels (could possible, haven‚Äôt tested yet) absolutely could affecting period.

People started J&amp;J fully vaccinated already 2 weeks. extremely easy way even safe. Thank much backing cause!!! FOURTEENTH medical professional everyone vows stand us, prevent THOUSAMDS people changing minds getting vaccine. 

While ask spread message (you even copy paste original save time), also accept monetary donations 1st world currency. Again, ask money thank ENDLESSLY comment opinion!!!! CONTINUE HERO!!!! No, genius. need hear opinion unbiased scientists. weird ridiculous way state vaccine effectiveness. Using absolute risk reduction, vaccines effectiveness:

Trial A: 

1% placebo participants infected 
0% vaccine participants infected 
100% efficacy 
1% ARR

Trial B: 

3% placebo participants infected 
2% vaccine participants infected 
33% efficacy 
1% ARR 

Looking way biased highly effective vaccines produce statistically significant results fewer cases less effective vaccines require infections produce results. 

And even going use method, least use updated numbers. Pfizer's latest update US trial start April shows 3.7% placebo recipients infected 0.3% vaccinated participants infected, ARR would well 3%. Yeah, think comment BS. Everyone know demographic scrambling it. friend recently diagnosed serious blood cancer. googled it, one strangest things smokers significantly less likely diagnosed it. would seem actually one disease smoking protects against. already observed California Bay Area. far cases death rates still trending makes sense, realize 20k day death wave almost completely irrelevant US, UK, Israel, UAE, countries lot vaccines, right? countries showing massive decrease hospitalization death, cases. can't say ""even though New Zealand zero covid, New Zealanders start panicking 20k deaths per day countries."" Similarly, can't say Americans Brits Israelis start panicking, either. Ohio, DeWine strict sticking procedures way precautions going get taken away get 50 less covid cases 100,000 daily 14 days. What? I'm Minnesota know soul gotten vaccine. Everyone jumped still jumping fast possible. like read word said, especially part wearing mask flu season lol

I've snuck decade-bracket feels almost cheeky.  Good Wear 4, even better. two cases person got entire vial (6 times dose) Israel. Neither suffered harm. tiny sample size seems like big deal. kidding? Look Facebook Twitter. many people believe vaccine prevent getting Covid, spreading it.

The CDC goddamn idiots this, like everything else, going prevent us hitting herd immunity.

The worst bit thanks CDC crappy media, perfectly reasonable well intentioned person could believe that, conclude point sick two days get useless vaccine. Maybe. Blue Ridge Rock Festival got confirmation state Virginia they're good move forward 2nd week September.

Not mention new covid variants affecting young people infants too, best young people like stay indoors. Phase 3 clinical trials indeed complete. 3rd phase approval process not. They're waiting feedback FDA determine move forward approval process additional data needs collected. often requires analysis existing samples taken trial participants, would require another trial.

At least sister telling works process pharma company. looks like might numbered approval phases differently[ shown process appear 5 phases 1-3 complete. Probably true. one study found virus intestines months recovery. literally need vaccine mandates.

Suddenly people stopped dying things life expectancy skyrocketed it‚Äôs likely 20-30 % deaths COVID accurately reported India. real number deaths may well 600K - 900K range opposed currently reported 187K. difficult wrap mind around it. Meanwhile tens studies showed masks reduce viral load. findings literally change nothing, show one paper said masks stop virus completely. Thats double masking thing. Even 100% effective benefits. percentage 18-22 year olds teach? percentage 18-22 year olds parents? percentage university students 18-22?

Edit: still attend school virtually. one holding education anyone's head. seems simply dont resources count deaths, much less give medical treatment people severely ill die.

Meanwhile, think whether people upset leadership representing situation publicly probably falls along partisan lines. I've heard Indian politics gets uglier US politics so....

Its sort moot point know simply unable fully track cases deaths right now. Wtf talking about? licensing deals struck Oxford Astrazeneca, various governments. EU plants also owned others, eg Novasep (now Thermo Fisher) Belgium. 

Since country bloc force private company hand IP give private company manufacture? might well claim EU commandeered Sanofi manufacture Moderna, somehow stealing first.

That broken record btw remains biggest global exporter vaccine. religious aristocracy exempt though. sometimes felt like weird drip lungs happened awhile stopped completely pfizer shot.  Indoors, maskless, mixing households die this. would rather get Covid recover instead getting vaccine early stages data long term effects.

Why would think know long term effects covid?

There cases lung scarring affecting people mild symptoms. Cases heart damage, kidney damage, neurological issues, chronic fatigue. affecting young, healthy people ‚Äòrecovered‚Äô. It‚Äôs rare, vaccine side-effects.

As vaccines, vaccines long-term negative effects. Side effects happen quickly all. There‚Äôs reason different. fact, mRNA vaccines work, there‚Äôs even less reason think would. vaccines aren‚Äôt new either, they‚Äôve development decade.

So whole premise question wrong. Even young, healthy person risk long-term effects covid far worse vaccination. news really, systems already require full vaccination. vaccines EUA covid vaccine get added list. LOL...

What actual fuck? 

Welcome April 2020... check account. know personally run it, still. What's treatment cases? tried google find much, Heparin counterproductive shifted UK China? show bragged twitter everyday?

They‚Äôve said make exceptions doctors notes clear exactly exceptions be. Sadly hit impenetrable red wall. wall thicker middle thinner top bottom hit numbers current political state. mistakes made times single patients beginning vaccination.

What's absurd someone given vaccines administer clearly even remotely qualified giving I'm pretty sure everyone medical profession knows point MDVs. require reconstituted. requires someone actually read instructions.

And repeated mistake 77 times. previously heard happening 1 patient mistake realized. pretty incompetent.

When happened previously, recipients mega doses fine BTW. wanting left alone, sure prick people.

Coz mUdI bad. also takes time people build immunity getting jab. It‚Äôs instantaneous. Rather, terrible headline. like ""teen develops auto-immune response, doctors know better administered heparin nearly killed her""

The pause sorting happening correctly treat it. fact heparin frequently one first choices doctors treat mystery blood clots huge part issue. know that's problem, going forward doctors advised absolutely administer heparin patient suffering mysterious blood clots getting covid vaccine. India puts commas different places West Indian government embodiment laziness.

They simply managing count everything. holding government accountable karma whoring proud done it. Autoimmune exemption makes sense. 

My wife one Dr advised get vaccine ASAP. issue way treat diseases giving medicine lowers immune system. COVID would wreck person autoimmune disease. Oh yeah forgot I‚Äôm old fuck thanks reminding Modi's response pandemic unmitigated disaster. Saying could've handled much better big understatement. difficult compare Trump Modi, awful leaders ways.

First all, ran economy ground two month lockdown starting March 2020. Deaths continued rise exponentially throughout lockdown, continued rising several months lockdown ended. especially harmful people stuck inside tiny homes without reliable Internet access, sacrifices nothing.

Afterwards, Modi gradually stopped paying attention pandemic actively encouraged large gatherings without preparing spike cases. companion crisis US long hauler access medical care file medical bankruptcy even health insurance. I‚Äôm receive astrazeneca vaccine, reading bit blood clots seems associated low platelets count. Would make sense couple blood tests check levels platelets following weeks? May help detect unlikely adverse reaction earlier? throwing away money useless blood tests? abusing others, show shallow are. work 40 paisa. hope pay enough, sir. also lift mandate single press conference too? Stop it! Facts hurt feelings! I'm undergrad, quick google seems imply policy undergrad grad students since least 2017. sure always way grad students. Genuine question, makes nervous long term effects vaccine COVID-19? wearing respirator? finding makes level 4 pathogen. worries, figured miscommunication! Uh huh. Lancet is, however. report saying new study published one respected medical journals blew CDC's WHO's recommendations last two years water called behind science.

About fucking time. mean, likely COVID spike causing issue, ""vaccine"" part. people problem highly likely develop real virus.

The real issue doctors trying treat heparin. auto immune response aggravated heparin auto-antibodies bind create *more* clots auto-antibodies.

This patient likely would far better outcome used heparin. Holding education kids heads. What‚Äôs percentage 18-22 year olds died? Much less 1% talking symptomatic infection only? post appears sort COVID-19 infection (symptomatic asymptomatic), 90%+ figures remember seeing always ""symptomatic COVID-19"". Got second dose earlier today. nice feeling second jab. We‚Äôre almost mess can't say without explaining hell comment wrong. Fucking useless, smh this. true. Yes did. Once, single press conference.

The message sent eliminating mask mandate experts said safe much worse.

For example, local HEB, lifted it, almost every shopper wore mask. soon lifted it? half people stopped. tell message think responded to? understand point although maybe better way put it. 

The USA, despite resources tech everything pretty hit 3k fatalities per day. could partially avoided mask mandates closing Florida (well see point, spring break). 

5000 deaths per day, 3000, 100 many deaths. Yes indeed proportionally size country resources much compared high numbers USA, point you‚Äôre making, yet tragic number, also avoidable. 

I‚Äôm sure number reported India actual number cases hope get better soon. even mean ""most countries""? That's nonsense. early birds like Israel, that's easy rich 10M pop look after. even overpay massively promise Pfizer access populations medical data. everyone else ordered broadly time. Famously, US commit major orders Trump. EU early vaccines, like e.g. Moderna, ordered ahead UK higher quantities. idea suing Sanofi ludicrous, obviously contracts conditional vaccine passing phase three trials. vaccine, contract, reason pay sue. EU ones bet Sanofi, US UK also major stakes development.

I genuinely know deal offered January. EU locked 200M Pfizer doses November plus 100M optional. plenty Q1 2. even close AZ numbers. Maybe people understand comment lighthearted joking manner got downvote two people started Dogpile. people start seeing ton downvotes assume intentions purely based backlash. people could negative hell it. Plus lot times mention people downvote due similar situation like Streisand Effect. We've known can't inside lots strangers sharing air year.

2. Following increase manufacturing capabilities. SII contractual obligation ; send 100 million vaccines able send 18 million. Following UK filed lawsuit them. imported vaccines took praise themselves. 


3. Age cap blunder allowing 45+ citizens get vaccinated. Indian Boomer population bang thalis rather getting vaccine. disinformation campaigns huge.


4. increase oxygen production since last year. 


5. paid media works wonders dissing ground reality actuality spreads like fire form cremations, blame then?

You‚Äôre interpreting correctly. virus 8x prevalent compared variants cases people vaccinated. People unvaccinated protection variant, see lower ratio B.1.351. doesn‚Äôt mean completely ineffective, it‚Äôs less effective compared variants. Osterholm lunatic wrong pandemic. think people extreme end cautious (like me) mistaken ""not wanting covid end"". think cases still go places reopen, cases something like 5% serious were. Case counts soon meaningless people getting sick really matters. mentioned places, variable data anyone point too. 

It's likely immunity week, likely enough throw caution wind. basically forever    got first Pfizer shot 17 weeks, little man still amazing! get second shot 5th, I‚Äôll 20 weeks. Fingers crossed wonderful outcome none happening, tilting windmills goal remains same: achieve herd immunity.

We yet, could get without kids significant portion us mix ignorant, lazy, uncivilized. are, need 12-15 year olds soon. wait that? course not. 

You proposing world usa overly cautious coronavirus policy. anything but. got second shot Pfizer yesterday like news! Exactly. actual data supporting kind vaccine-defeating variant fact data shows vaccines effective them. whole variant thing phantom. stats referenced official government Canada covid stats website: doesn‚Äôt make sense vaccinate everyone (build immunity) something affects primarily aged 70 80 plus. I'm arguing you. Probably COVID individual level less dangerous flu, spreads much easier problem, especially since vaccinated flu covid.

I'd send kid person school vaccine authorized, probably I'm strongly leaning towards keeping remote without shot. Yeah. partner going ease way back in, starting eating outdoors semi-crowded locations, moving indoor dining (@50% capacity) within week two. sometime next weeks, we're hosting gathering vaccinated friends. June I'd like living life again.  is, elastomeric mask, aka gas masks.

Many medical facilities already replaced N95 reusable half full face masks, PAPR. Obviously also facilities behind times, idea half mask Sad knew would happen. poor country many disadvantage access news quality education, bound reality. may 16+ would need parental consent, may unfortunately Welp, looks like J&amp;J used males Friend mine lives rural VA local WalMart accepting walk-ins couple weeks. Entire families going. think become widespread literally within week two, vaccine available everywhere walk-ins. get mine next Wednesday. 

I'm nervous also suffer general anxiety disorder...so comes turf.

I symptoms first jab arm pain. Whew. Good. many times think N95 KN95 re-used fashion? Twice? Thrice? weird right? One difference exposed covid last November. Kicked ass five days heavy fatigue couple weeks.

So maybe immune system freak vaccine? knows. Okay, think different attitude toward risk people. Nothing wrong that, trying convince people stop hyperbolic, they're trying convince treat things emergency, neither person going get anywhere, two different views world. Lol easy incentivise workers. I'm sure well would translate across America  Israel hit herd immunity 56% vaccination including 15% recovered. US getting close 50% we're still vaccinating 1% eligible population per day even demand slowing. absolutely doubt reach herd immunity weeks already. id absolutely necessary. Without protection longevity. makes entire thing pointless weeks. I‚Äôve gone eat times. Still much else I‚Äôm at. I‚Äôm hoping point summer there‚Äôll concerts attend. Undercounting likely. ¬ÆÔ∏è still buying $5 chicken Costco; theirs. Costco sell amounts really comparable small pharmacy even regular grocery store; apples oranges. Nice evening out, red wine rona.  Yeah, wouldn‚Äôt want offend New York race would we? Indeed SII commercial agreements place Indian govt waited 4 days ago went crap give SII another company money expand production facilities asking long time.  ones live Israel. Yes viral load covid high enough cause sort illness she'd almost certainly tested positive. thought clots mainly appearing people low platelets? Haha yes agree good thing reducing variants. questions along lines trying understand give rise new variants likelihood variant created someone immunity concern. want equip real facts data conversations people use argument well prepared. He‚Äôs somewhat right though. I‚Äôve asked restaurant I‚Äôve quite restrictions lifting. live work Tel Aviv btw.   Palestinian Israeli Hospital Jurisdiction, yes obviously counted. 

If not, no. lot cases people getting infected even getting second dose. 

Define lot. getting second jab much much less likely test positive. lot mean 80% less unvaccinated equivalent groups define words saying reports seem accurate.

Totally anecdotal therefore worth discussing. Less flu shot? FALSE. 78 Million flu shots given 2020 (most ever year), us 135 Million+ individuals least one covid shot. far successful vaccine campaign one year US FAR.  know talking about. rofl Sorry Canada... sure reach first pretty much reach next couple months. large urban cities liberal/progressive type people getting vaccine. rational solution ""all students must vaccine time FDA (or FDA equivalent) approved vaccine available them"" Also, saw posts anxious 2nd dose. want say understand you, I'm 28 get second dose next week + horrible health anxiety. cannot postpone vaccine (I live UK), definitely (if get it, dose def go waste goes principles). makes feel better, friends gotten second dose fine. 40% population first dose. he's still saying lock downs used last resort.... Fuck.. Shouldn‚Äôt aggressively redirecting vaccines places like India? It‚Äôs bit perverse people refusing take vaccines many parts world literally drowning dead bodies ""Sometimes randomly ping super loud fade course minute two""  ""fleeting tinnitus"" everyone gets that, time time, often.

Been year mine, sounds like old tube TV left somewhere room.   maddening first 4 months, slowly got better would ignore time. Yeah plus people want go back second shot would willing get one instead Kinda feel scammed getting AZ 2 days ago.. Cool. good site keep latest full approval vax? stupid title. That's good news countries robust vaccination programs production capabilities. 

A lot don't. Hopefully given lot help summer. almost guarantee happened.

Meanwhile schools closed Toronto lockdown since October. madness every level. husband COVID. 4 people among 6 people COVID. symptoms. certainly trouble breathing. oxygen suddenly drops 83%. lung 30% involvement. pretty sure COVID. Yay! Fuck Cancer. Japan's lack urgency troubling Olympics coming up. parent disagree put perspective. 

In 2018, 20,599 kids hospital flu ages 5-17.

For COVID-19 age group 1672 last year. 

I remember 2018 schools closed, masks required time people freaking every child hospitalized. keeping children home right fear COVID-19 thing every flu season kids safe infecting kids. feels like hypocrisy to. Nah fuck that, anti-mask, anti-vax, anti-science bullshit far harmful ""incivility""  Official deaths 2k/day. Reality estimates: 10k/day. 

It's grim. hell. friend Alexandria go Fredericksburg 40 cases India variant already. little, late, story entire pandemic Canadians. pretty simple, everyone wore mask November, stopped wearing them, started wearing March.

/s Agreed, mRNA research done years prior really helped. 
I wonder though traditional vaccines would filled place anyway? 
Certainly clear mRNA way forward, Moderna / Pfizer still would pumped vaccines even old attenuated (is right?) type. may true, judging trends countries good vaccination programs one safest countries planet near future. point ""the US safe now,"" point ""the US really worry global wave everyone knows happening next weeks."" Instead seeing massive surge cases like countries right now, we're seeing plateau. Plus, even though new cases staying constant, deaths plummeting due high risk groups heavily vaccinated. 

Besides, comparing % recorded deaths vs % population terrible way compare us global average. Healthcare infrastructure reporting varies wildly country country. look India: conservative estimates say undercounting COVID deaths several times. areas disposing 20x many bodies following COVID protocols official recorded deaths. believed Russia is/was missing COVID deaths, well, extent India. simply can't compare data countries extremely poor healthcare infrastructure country one best influenza-like disease surveillance programs world virtually unlimited money brainpower throw gathering data. 266 deaths 0-17. 2063 deaths 18-29 year olds. Covid 100x deadly vaccine. lol Send North... Btw greatly appreciating posts yours. enough people get vaccinated, spread, virus mutate.

Vaccination definitely good thing reducing variants. Definitely good EU. ensured second generation booster shots 2022 booster shots (third generation?) 2023. one deal enough vaccinate entire EU population, including children, two years twice, assuming 2-dose regime. 

The EU also receive enough vaccines third fourth quarter year give population third booster shot fall (from Pfizer, Moderna, CureVac, Janssen, AstraZeneca probably NovaVax). new contract ensures long term protection CoViD-19.

But possibly bad news poorer countries. billions doses available anymore poorer countries coming years, probably still searching first second doses then. know. told reached limit. Went COVID aladeen COVID aladeen. lot cases people getting infected even getting second dose. news reports anecdotal evidence. 4th day getting 2nd dose anyway. parents got vaccinated last week. would age limitations here. saying reports seem accurate. 5Gmen  It‚Äôs definitely improving expanded eligibility AstraZeneca it‚Äôs going better  Hopefully USA send backlog AstraZeneca Canada. Family member something someone shared Facebook We're not. Declines pace okay expected, especially given 50% US adults received first dose. states open vaccination everyone, becomes easier schedule vaccination local pharmacy, logical demand mass vaccination sites reduced. sites exist launch vaccination campaigns, vaccine reaches local pharmacies sufficient numbers. See, showing work whenever want pretty normal field, casual insubordination, drinking job, wearing flip flops, spending hours lunch. despite this, line professional decorum unambiguous behavior risks creating hostile work environment people intentionally controversial make people feel less welcome, worse - going around baiting people controversy. can't imagine kind professional setting *would* allow things... Thank God!  seem misunderstand point. No, kids ""masks removed everywhere else"" school- would silly. Kids would continue wear masks anywhere they're close contact unvaccinated people outside household, obviously includes school. 

So no, we're going ""continue this"" simply sake kids. simply explaining parents different situation many people, feel comfortable kids around bunch unmasked adults uncertain vaccination status. ""we."" ""open.""

All us reduced restrictions. ""open.""

The state play varies wildly, almost woods. seems like gross misunderstanding rational utility theory cost-benefit analysis.

As we've seen states like Michigan countries like Germany, ""flattening curve"" may help keep hospitals overloading, reduce overall cases much time.

At point, everyone probably going get covid eventually get vaccine. someone who's never going vaccinated, restrictions going prolong time little bit. least US,, we're close enough herd immunity states open (Florida) antivaxxers overload hospitals. everyone else, prolonged restrictions would hurting economy, mental health, social lives marginal benefit. already made lot tradeoffs covid, continue afterwards well, live world infinite resources zero risk. Uk type export restrictions lol. need quarantine, going person public health guidelines. exposed could therefore expose people around you. Reschedule apt. Tylenol safe take pregnant, effective fever reducer. doctor advised take one fever, first second shot (24 weeks pregnant second shot two weeks ago). Further, uncontrolled fever issue first trimester due risk neural tube defects, less concern second third. again, uncontrolled, Tylenol effective fevers reported typically super high long lasting. you, risk COVID (and three times likely pregnant person end hospitalized due it) significantly worse risk needing take Tylenol. wife talk doctor ASAP. diminish tragedy getting VITT CVST, treatable caught early. Heck, Hillary Clinton 2012 ran president 2016. VITT really comparable CVST, similar numbers might apply:

""In 2004 first adequately large scale study natural history long-term prognosis condition reported; showed 16 months follow-up 57.1% people full recovery, 29.5%/2.9%/2.2% respectively minor/moderate/severe symptoms impairments, 8.3% died. Severe impairment death likely aged 37 years, male, affected coma, mental status disorder, intracerebral hemorrhage, thrombosis deep cerebral venous system, central nervous system infection subsequent [systematic nineteen studies 2006 showed mortality 5.6% hospitalisation 9.4% total, survivors 88% make total near-total recovery. several months, two thirds cases resolution (""recanalisation"") clot. rate recurrence low (2.8%)."" end goal always reducing community spread low levels

The end goal reducing harm people. still massive amounts community spread, vaccine brings hospitalizations deaths miniscule number, community spread vaccine merely tool get there

If vaccine get us there, game over. Restrictions going away, one way other. Even turns vaccines help (they do), even cases deaths go (they have, will, permanently), scenario never going back normal life.

 CDC came tomorrow said, ""yeah see mask mandate ending ever,"" everyone would take masks immediately. measures taking followed *because* temporary. school district forced quarantines testing well (I've kids tested school many times). 

In case everyone area chance get vaccinated hospitals fine really care raw case numbers anymore. Yes forced healthy people get tested we'd turn cases see point. stress case numbers flu season watch state every day. different older vulnerable vaccinated. basically line thought. hoping find paper discussion virologist (or something close) talks virus pressure mutations. everything I‚Äôve heard seems like limitations replication weight potential pressure induced variant  People hesitant get vaccine going megasite. available pharmacy pick prescription, might get around it. Without vaccinations, exposure based immunity covid-19 fragile, short-lived, vulnerable near term reinfection variants.  lasting immunity without vaccination - that‚Äôs going keep circulating good long while. See Israel, multiple countries look similar coming months find interesting literally news sources reporting Indian mean first dose 80-90% protection severe disease/death even older age groups according real world data UK. depends much risk willing take risk vaccine definitely big drop. 

Here UK get second dose 2 months first might well make substantial protection provided 2 weeks first dose Isn‚Äôt U.K. did? Seems worked really well them. 70% adults actually get right? think that's super reasonable especially considering close are. states saying something like this. lot people know getting second shot right around now, let's get rid masks soon. lol thanks live Germany, it‚Äôs kind hard believe time lines. Personally know two people able get vaccine went ‚Äûloop hole‚Äú methods (i.e. visit grandpa sometimes). Even older people know, formally invited receive vaccine, either haven‚Äôt able make appointment appointment sometime May. I‚Äôm priority group idea I‚Äôll able make appointment we‚Äôre even close done 70+ population. 

My entire family US vaccinated friends back home least first dose. Okay first 3 AZ factory's UK funded British taxpayer, one Belgium. UK's backing funding AZ sold cost. UK effectively subsidised cheap vaccines world. explicitly forced this. EU put order late, contract ""we hope deliver xx amount xx date.

UK plants focused supplying UK. UK actually exports lot raw materials needed types vaccines. UK, wanted pull king dick move like USA could block raw material export, don't. still exporting these, whilst EU stockpiling AZ whilst one using they've trashed it, whilst also asking more? can't even use ones have.

Thing India example, manufacturing AZ many countries including EU, EU stockpiles use them. Best luck baby Absolutely privilege insane, people vaccine hesitant see going countries crazy/shady people get vaccine, they‚Äôd make appointment local cvs get vaccine first thing tomorrow morning. PM India suspected holding fake graduation degree, nobody dare ask Variants occur naturally virus mutate replicates spreads. 

Vaccines limit spread replication, therefore mutations limited.

I get people mad this. threat vaccination program people voluntarily refusing vaccines. fact, making lot people refuse vaccines.   effective things. problem less 30% total US population fully vaccinated.

Edit: advocating states use national guard go neighborhood neighborhood get job done. force anyone, show offer it. could done matter weeks. Strange. issues locally me:   mean necessarily? course strict restrictions would save lives.

I agree worth cost. I'd rather risk people's lives able live life normally without mask. I'm guessing majority world agree me, us wear mask flu season. Oh god BBC report...I can't even begin imagine folks going through...I sorry India dealing :( Vaccination Demographics update 2021-04-23

Luckily we‚Äôre hitting mass vaccination approach optimal months. Dude, 50% US adults gotten least one shot. We're waaaaay past ""approval"" anything formality. Personal experience well. 
My grandfather vaccinated AstraZeneca first dose March 3.
Later March, uncle family COVID, including people contact. 13 person covid matter days. 

The person got COVID? grandfather vaccinated. Well damn son... Looks like need second opinion. Thanks.

NOTE: second shot. bad reaction first shot. That's 0.0006 percent chance getting blood clot better chance dying coconut falling head  J&amp;J vaccine reported 66% effective moderate covid, 85% severe.

Im interested see 7-day goes next weeks. misinformation, please ignore them.  want stop mutations export allowed &amp; countries producing mutants given priority. Pandemic became worse due mutations One dose immunity lasts way longer weeks. people coming ridiculous conclusions? It‚Äôs definitely common sense among vegans.

Of course, we‚Äôve got anti-vaxxers nut jobs like group, large ask vegan, they‚Äôll say course they‚Äôll get vaccinated. vegan friends either already fully vaccinated process getting vaccinated. No. could let people want AZ it. Vaccine confidence Britain high, takeup. minimises risks proper informed consent. Also, everyone 50 vaxxed, vulnerable groups, cases low... much harder justify insisting low-risk groups get AZ basis protecting others.

AFAIK enough mRNA cover 18-30s. let whoever wants AZ get AZ mop rest remaining mRNA stocks incoming Novavax, might alright.  would certainly convince people go get vaccinated, it‚Äôs better all. Besides that, would powerful tool workplace, policy could enforced. good news. hope public universities follow suit. Vaccinations plummeting, cases stalling, can't find goddamn vaccine appointment.

Everything bad news. risk variant comes along breaks vaccine protection? hit 70% vaccinated promise masks walked back people pissed and/or refuse wear masks. Hopefully won‚Äôt happen it‚Äôs hard rule out. Well still many second doses give elderly! wonder could certain allergies? 

I got 1st dose today answer allergic certain things like eggs bovine something-or-other. 

On way home remembered hearing Jason Mantzoukas talk pretty deathly egg allergy wondered folks like could get vaccinated... Kind strange question, would possible get second dose Moderna/Pfizer vaccine different state got first? I‚Äôm supposed get first shot coming Monday, I‚Äôve planning traveling another state stay fianc√© due stressful situation going family home.

I know normally prefer get second shot location, home life circumstances severe enough need get safer environment. wondering typical ‚Äúrules‚Äù sort thing speak. Thanks advance think one important thing keep mind this: giving goals directly achievable almost equivalent giving goal all. horribly stated, let try rephrase. did, indeed, give goal hospitals went certain utilization elderly deaths went certain percent, would expect public do? feel agency. keep doing. going bars, continue. supposed feel like making big difference? stayed inside stay inside hope others well.

However, give goal person feels like agency goal causally linked ACTUAL, REAL goal, see much greater response.

People machines order get desired results, might need reframe issues directly relevant ideally solution person feels like direct hand helping with.


Additionally, feel like comparison flu quite point. lot potential long-term effects people catch covid.

Flu? sucks. runny nose week. Covid? Well, hope prepared breath funny later life develop brain fog substantial amount time. honestly knowledgeable long term effects I've heard, clear difference flu covid. still vaccinating 40; vaccinate younger people, incidence probably go (somewhat) change mind anyway. already it? hope answer 

I spent time give way valuable information I've upvoted thousands times exact thing sub before.

So definitely me. People hesitant continue wear masks need incentive get vaccine giving minimum percentage mandates lifted logical motivator. Anti vaxxers impossible reach I'm talking them. People hesitant made time appointment whatever reason, laziness you, ones reach thats ones giving clear goal reaches. follows Covid pattern, time detect one cases, likely hundreds thousands already spreading incubating general public... BOOM! Symptoms appear hospitals slammed. Started top you‚Äôre actually change anything going away completely federal government. possible promise accurate date decision made states businesses. Come lie. got tested due PM's efforts Delhi. testing facility central government. CM Arvind Kejriwal busy inviting farmers Punjab spread covid Delhi. Yes farmers super-spreaders Delhi. still going back home.

Also Delhi CM spent TV ads could spent fight pandemic. pronounced Spaceman much delusional intentionally kill people rather mandate vaccination, keep restrictions place people vaccine passports.

Israel broadly reopened fully vaccinated people, everyone else still stricter restrictions every US state has. sure reading otherwise.

Just yesterday opened slightly more, still restricted many US states. virtually community spread due months actual lockdown like smart country. US get 130 new cases day, yes kind move might rational. Still, ""completely open."" 

""The cabinet approved Wednesday loosening number coronavirus restrictions, number new cases day remains relatively low. maximum number people allowed gather outdoors raised 100, cap remaining 20 people indoor gatherings.

Large outdoor stadiums allowed host 10,000 people instead 5,000, indoor stadiums able host crowds 40 percent capacity, maximum 4,000 people. number people allowed participate event involve seating food increased 500 750, mass participation sporting events like marathons able include 1,000 participants. (Ido Efrati)""  It‚Äôs people fence, countries difficulty vaccinating population due logistical/availability issues. Ouzo. went expected. Opa! Implying that's real risk. Lol tough call. buckets AZ mRNA sitting picked would no-brainer. refuse AZ mRNA later involves delay. get infected delay. recover. even likely spread someone else thus someone else...eventually lives lost ruined delay.

I'm pretty sure math going say take get soon get -- alternative death, probably others. unnecessary death nonetheless. What's likely. us jerks one us. What's common denominator here. hope answer let anti vaxxers die

Listen, I‚Äôm good justice-boner story people suffering (hello Ted Nugent) kids can‚Äôt get vaccine right I‚Äôd love reduce number plague rats openly roaming streets. It‚Äôs easier get shots arms. I‚Äôm informed retired guy- expert. best guess is: 1) India variant circulate America 2) cause plenty infections, hospitalizations deaths vaccinated unvaccinated folks 3) eventually there‚Äôll booster vaccine becomes available (one already exists) protect us India B1.617 variant (at least). Shouldn‚Äôt testing see individual antibodies opt get vaccine? article mentions it‚Äôs due fact vaccine-induced immunity lessens overtime, coming one year benchmark from? 

Assuming first batch people participated human trials coming year since vaccinated, wouldn‚Äôt seeing breakthrough cases true?

I wonder hypotheses partially new strains we‚Äôre seeing countries low vaccination rates concern vaccine resistant strain could emerge? Ideally Well, want people get vaccinated fact far, today peak pandemic, really good reason that.

This article painting nice picture situation actually extremely ugly looking that's dangerous.

So unless people want part 20k day death wave probably get vaccinated. People refuse wear masks won‚Äôt start vaccinated populations are. reasoning flawed. Absolutely. They're mooching immunity *while also* raising risk everyone. bullshit Sure, clear refusing possibility (the Halix plant problematic). rather claim problematic there's little evidence either way (as far I've seen). DC controls individual states‚Äô mandates exactly? certain point anti-vaxxers ones needing hospital services, provision certain amount hospital service disease/condition (with priority vaccinated) leave rest hospital everything else.

If anti-vaxxer needs treatment covid ward busy... take number. long ago first shot? I'm wondering long-term thing you, vaccine recent immune system otherwise occupied. example, environmental allergies act cold/flu.  country actually EU successful vaccine roll atm? Western regulators found effective, surprisingly.

Which regulators? like this. hope states copy idea.  r/nottheonion People travelling indirectly India require second Covid test connecting location. meant curb loophole . one cares...""

Ah see. 

Nobody cares death rate hit 20k deaths/day.

Lets see, r/coronavirus really care anymore bunch jerks vote train comment?

Hmm... trade US going full-NZ literally impossible.

The mob mob reason. 50% adults one shot - not? *holds flashlight face*

Thanks odd. US paid Emergent Biosolutions license manufacture, Serum Institute India used Bexicmo Pharma also internally. Thailand Siam Bioscience, South Korea SK Bioscience, on. made many, many places, diversity ordering many governments. almost like wanted hedge bets non-AZ production sites, could pay somewhere it. EU would pay more, said EU politicans looking rather populations, trying throw others bus.

Merk dropped pretty quick, EU could struck manufacturing deal manufacture also running many months ago.

But didn't. on. EU story seems broken record ""could of, late"". sign take things Reddit pinch salt lol PG county well serious right now?... I'm virologist, basic high school education. 

Vaccines ""normal"" virus (DNA virus) 1 shot life. due low probability mutation type virus.

Vaccines ""coronavirus"" (RNA virus, like flu covid, shot every 2-3 years.
This due high probability mutation type virus. many strains covid mutations, strains tetanus.


We got new type vaccines used covid. Usually use ""corpses"" weakened viruses even parts it. covid, we're injecting ourself mRNA, alter DNA. need shots.

This really new new shit, genetic therapy studied many years now, new usage vaccine really know long term problems could provocate. get wrong, rare thrombosis cases, really know example problems prions similar, relative new technology. source states vaccinated? source states vaccinated?

What lesson here, children?  like last 2 times. know old saying, fool once.. long lasting effects Covid worry you? guess I'm less hurry ditch masks young kids- even eligible vaccination fall, earliest. obviously keep masks then, ""no masks mommy daddy, two keep on, k?"" something anticipate successful parenting strategy.

It also seems like masks last restriction get rid of- maybe transition full capacity masks first? ask, joke real lol Thought knew already. I've living. affect herd immunity benchmarks sort what‚Äôs expected? I‚Äôve seen 95/90/80 Pfizer, definitely understand real world situations change things. don‚Äôt provide anticoags vaccine? Problem solved. That‚Äôs great! way stay 5% then. ‚ÄúIn conclusion, affirm without doubt, based test comparison proportions confidence interval, well paired tests used Wilcoxon ‚Äì Mann ‚Äì Whitney test (Œ±: 95%), data variables (P&lt;0.05) obtained indicate chlorine dioxide effective treatment COVID-19, making RT-PCR negative one hundred percent cases 7 days, significantly rapidly modifying symptoms disease, significantly reducing laboratory parameters normality within 14 21 days‚Äù Total, think around. 51% eligible (around 250m people 16) crazy, either lot people weren‚Äôt take up, causing announcing least twice hour whole shift.

I know people signing pharmacy online, first I‚Äôve heard offering walk-in essentially. There's reports long haulers feeling better fully recovering symptoms getting fully vaccinated. Wtf, why? still get it. dumb wearing mask cost   think strong government pressure put folks get vaccinated, doesn‚Äôt work need force  Second shot chills, fever, feeling super weak middle night. Woke extremely nauseous too. side effects subsided afternoon India fake cert industry EVERYTHING solid numbers yet much reduces spread? I‚Äôll bet it‚Äôs way better 95%. doubt they‚Äôll find handful cases definitely came vaccinated person.

For public health, 95% solution 100% solution. infected person would normally spread 2-3 people (it‚Äôs lower that) population vaccinated one twenty catch it, one ten, cases quickly drop zero.

We don‚Äôt need perfection. need R value 1, keep there. That‚Äôs it. common knowledge China dealing initial outbreak. discussed multiple times last year yet keep seeing articles saying new discovery. think need full approval cannot force people get vaccine emergency authorization. voluntarily get vaccine emergency authorization, fine. 

Then question still remains happens international students/employees got let‚Äôs say AstraZeneca Sputnik V approved US. someone thinks restrictions end pretty soon, tell one reason. Personally believe restrictions end period time vaccine widely available people. believe totally divorced case count even hospitalization death count. different different areas - example, Arizona, there's already full vaccine availability adults roughly month now. think wait maybe 1 month, people plenty time get shots get waiting time, bets off.

The reason believe simple. moment reasonable opportunity get vaccine decline opportunity, over. Immediately, longer anyone's responsibility protect covid. certainly longer government's responsibility. catch covid point that, got one blame yourself. come time situation describes 99.9% American adults. time far future. time, herd immunity? metrics super low? hope so, rather doubt it, least everywhere. matter. time, everyone one group - group got vaccinated, group chose live covid. Neither group needs wants protected restrictions. Damn, imagine getting milk bread offer fucking COVID VACCINES speaker, people rush there, must nice american. Wouldn‚Äôt concern India sealed rest world banning flights country. even know process ? 
3 days time takes get RT PCR test results , test #1 boarding flight 
Test #2 - done immediately landing airport people sent 3 day quarantine designated hotel charges 1500 fucking dollars 3 days ( results arrive ) 
Test 3 done 10th day home sample sent switch health
There series tests done people coming AZ also ten per vial (sometimes 11) 40 yo woman?

Regardless, I'll gladly take jab instead you
I'll sacrifice  Meanwhile, live 55+ people love Facebook misinfo jealous 80+ gang we‚Äôre getting mRNA doses turned noses AZ, held line everyone else. Thankfully govt finally started offering younger folks it‚Äôs flying shelves damn. embarrassing. Vaccine hesitancy real problem here. So, expect 9/11 2.0? dont like trump, encouraging vaccines  you‚Äôre clearly paying attention. seen misinformation constantly.

It‚Äôs masking, it‚Äôs vaccine doesn‚Äôt stop getting spreading it, can‚Äôt change behavior, what‚Äôs point? It‚Äôs tremendous argument hand anti-vaxxers, goddamn reason.

Just say vaccine works incredibly well, prevents nearly disease transmission, does.

Scroll Twitter, comments sub, local covid Facebook group. You‚Äôll see constantly, even anti vaxxers. think enforcing vaccines great due slippery slope nature it

It's slippery slope. nothing new, thing long vaccines thing. keep seeing news people aren‚Äôt getting vaccine US. It‚Äôs starting look like it‚Äôs going struggle hit herd immunity since people don‚Äôt want shot... drink tar downing Clorox pills. Awesome!! Double protection!! Maybe n95? cloth otherwise? Horray! number ppl 2 vaccines sure, uptake rate way lower October 2nd, 2022 yet? way way waaaaay likely die, become disabled covid, get love one critically ill.

Me? No. obese get plenty amounts vitamin gladly take chances covid apart experiment vaccine tested humans. People keep going this, states phased redlines, months.

It's odd people think collective target motivate people stop something doing.

Where incredibly mask adherant people chafing ear loops, completely uninterested vaccine? met one. 

Places high demand vaccines mandates. vax reluctant places places dont high mask compliance restrictions.

This whole thing giant, reddit group think red-herring. need accessibility better messaging, really need better scientific education.

The reasons different populations want vaccines various. need tackled locally different ways. Maybe it'll help jackasses keep implying government wants keep masks lockdowns going forever.  already updated procedures 

What mean? Denmark [completely AstraZeneca vaccine. Well, late me. started smoking read paper, I'm stopping now! vaccine absolutely prevents spread covid, CDC half dozen double blind studies conclusively proving yet, say does.

The vaccine heavily reduces spread COVID, eliminate it. people bitching mad 95% solution allow act like 100% solution. became eligible April 5th Oregon. I‚Äôm essential worker group second last opened. -_- public health point view, distinction getting covid, suffering symptoms unable spread meaningless.

Seriously, don‚Äôt get sick don‚Äôt spread it, don‚Äôt meaningfully disease. Sure, vaccine doesn‚Äôt magically stop virus entering system, means immune system clears it‚Äôs gets toehold, didn‚Äôt get covid. like half preprints /r/covid19. preprints end bs invalidated time.

Like whole Vitamin thing, able go vial day. Stop negative. people know deal stock. Yeah, feels like we're moving snails pace Canada. 


As today, we're 26.7% population least 1 dose, 975k fully vaccinated. Ever heard phrase ‚Äúnever meet heroes?‚Äù applies countries too. elephant room providing ZERO incentive vaccinated.

The vaccines extremely effective, that's incentive. government required give cookie make something that's much interest. Positivity rate. 

3% lower 6 weeks means virus remission. Places like Lon Angeles county starting move direction. Unethical, case least, impractical, too. Oh ok sure I'm voted. Theres literally news articles pulled blood clots reported ppl AZ dose Ya talking april 22nd, 2021. know CDC gave mixed signals past CDC lists perfectly fine. WV, MS, CA religious exemptions schools. MS WV even let doctor write medical exemption -- done health department. correct, suggest read short little article.

The fact immune systems quite complex antibody titers one many things consider, including long B cells live. 

As article states, flu titers whole lives flu strain changes much. fact probably happen COVID. However, strains fine body handle without vaccine longer really novel virus people. 

Like said - get flu shot. continue get covid vaccine. However, think way currently discussing it, good want people get vaccines, seems bit self-serving. major indian politicians lose elections personally. 100s examples. Karunanidhi, Jayalaliltha, Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, etc. even big deal mean ""they cunning"". Extremely poor understanding Indian politics. seen reason believe hesitancy anything fact can't whip mask second get first shot.

Me neither, have, however, seen increasing number people never worn mask gotten vaccine trying push idea got rid mask mandates people would get vaxxed. reality people want people wear masks makes question aren't. second shot three weeks ago. fever, woke feeling shitty. really hope it‚Äôs Covid. so, even it‚Äôll mild, can‚Äôt imagine 10 day quarantine small place... *person

6 possible cases, one person potentially died J&amp;J vaccine. One hospitalized critical condition. great odds you‚Äôre way way waaaaay likely die, become disabled covid, get love one critically ill. Absolutely. India likely infections maybe even deaths right? US death count likely undercount. know two people basically dying anyways covid delivered final blow. 60s got covid hospital conditions. way could gotten it. Tony‚Äôs family even took antibody tests make sure didn‚Äôt infect him. Flawed analogy.

You need 3 planes. third plane lifted one engines fire. would choice one risking catching COVID.

You 1 million chance dying AZ, 1 250 chance dying COVID. 

Maybe another vaccine 1 million chance dying, wait weeks months it, meanwhile final wave ramping many places world.

The verdict still pfizer Moderna don‚Äôt cause bloodclots, they‚Äôve disproportionately given older people far. now. saw reported 9 per million study post earlier. Still significant risk. 

I mean, British noted AstraZeneca COVID shot clots to168 them. type vaccine type Johnson &amp; Johnson. know issue look it'll unpaused shortly. 

Denmark already updated procedures copy that. Double check hit muscle shoulder instead vein. Done. Lend? type disease. Since mostly kills people past fertile years, selected against. Instead, gradually evolve become contagious less lethal join regimen ""minor"" diseases like influenza did. could possibly imagine tobacco companies, lied fucking heads almost century tobacco addictive causing cancer, would stoop this?

I mean, sure, put in-house lawyers charge health addiction studies conducted, claimed government see research results shielded attorney-client confidentiality laws, still...

I shocked. great news! I‚Äôm glad people finally waking many people believe vaccine prevent getting Covid, spreading it.

The vaccines effective make far less likely get COVID, also make les likely spread it. outright prevent either. based reports here, lots early heavy periods, let‚Äôs say someone newly pregnant, like first weeks.... See mean, person would definitely want period come. think idea virus airborne, thought settled last year; is. But, envisioned happening transmission (i.e.; hence mask) would another idea be? kind figured case right around time decided wear masks know. I'm asking person source ""the government trying hide it"".

NZ banned anyone India last 2 weeks. Transiting countries won‚Äôt help. may stereotyping people buy less populated places worse opened getting vaccinated? wonder got J&amp;J shot would count approved Pfizer Moderna ones are.  Flu cold.

I'm willing bet seeing say things like, ""we'll need keep wearing masks social distance time being"" incorrectly interpreting mean ""forever"". I'm seeing lots frustrated people reddit elsewhere making exact mistake.

If like find video literally saying we'll keep things *forever*, I'll happy stand corrected. Exactly, law refined strengthened overtime loopholes found abused. Religious exemptions investigated well, call church talk pastor make sure actually is.

In end true medical religious objections rare accommodated. California puts work make sure exceptions actually true anti-vax BS. think that‚Äôs legitimately British equivalent ‚Äúshot‚Äù. Sounds weird ears too, don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre trying cheeky. 

Can Brit confirm? 
50% monkey pocket already lot places vaccine uptake slowing. doctor texted two weeks ago stating eligible contact appointment. I'm currently getting hit ton bricks. Worst headache think I've ever had... day.  conditions list change past couple months? Many many state universities already vaccinating, mRNA vaccines. trouble convincing students get it. I'm doctor, heard, first jab catches body unawares. body realizes ""if see virus again, I'll get em."" second jab, recognizes virus mounts immune response makes suffer lol.

That's also people COVID before, first jab worse -- body already recognizes virus sick.

But again, people reaction shot. husband got second dose days arm soreness hours one night bad sleep it. Seems like fair trade. least get less weird looks snide comments.

Honestly don‚Äôt think position unreasonable one. someone self-destructive immune system I‚Äôm really tired seeing anti-vaccine rhetoric. Vaccines real modern marvel it‚Äôs frustrating see science discarded usual facebook ‚Äúresearch‚Äù. seem like someone head straight, respect personal decision. clear sub wrong. 

The German buy conditional upon EMA approval, happened yet. 

Russia technologically capable making good vaccine, politically capable hiding fact made good vaccine. 

We know applies EMA conducted evaluation. main issue lot us sit tickets couple months take perfectly safe flight eventually depart. We've lived isolation surviving fine year now, couple months avoid hopping plane slight mechanical issue. many given? type scenarios happen existing vaccines? Tetanus, polio, flu?

 multiple 0.05% case fatality rate whateverfor healthy young people. Wow look 1/500 X 1/2000 = 1/1,000,000

It's open shut debate, UK government literally math said low incidence covid model UK 30s higher chance going ICU vaccine induced blood clots covid Yes remember reading developing COVID vaccine year like learning speak Spanish year...but already speak Portuguese. analogy always stuck me! Slippery slope legitimately bullshit reasoning. Plenty sporting events let bring food bag transparent. rights infringed agree private luxury event's rules.

That's wonderful initiative.

Thank bringing up! Well, would go finding vaccines would safe pregnancy not?

Genuine question. UC‚Äôs don‚Äôt remember CSU‚Äôs (more specifically CSUN) asking vaccination records back 2016.   easy say comfort couch! mean, whatever think, sure that's it! That's called medical marijuana None yet. didn't. western regulators approved yet; investigated EMA. Yet likely still make wear masks social distance. sent bill $45. vaccine free, sites charge vaccine administration fee. say this?

No one wanted hear you‚Äôve made lot people unhappy reason. Instead Fauci saying ""we'll still social distance mask forever even vaccines,"" maybe say that.

Well good news Fauci not, fact, saying that. 50% still good, flu vaccine 40% effective one complains, every country access pfizer moderna Sinovac/Sinopharm vaccines options that's way better vaccine.

Chile using hospitalizations among 60+ people keep going down. article one - Canada seems based ‚Äúwait 4 months doses‚Äù nonsense want money. hoping number people saying one gave less sides other. Negative tests within three days think. Like literally anything general populace, health care, policing, nearly everything gov't does. reactive. ... ... seriously? random color system? hate it. ever customs? Playa dust forms protective layer lungs; feel sorry coronavirus trying find purchase there. flip side, anywhere else world could get away ridiculously elaborate full face mask? Except healthy 30 year old country low covid incidence wait extra weeks get another vaccine close 1/250 chance dying covid time. start getting pretty close 1/1 million well No. actually heavily-discussed point, three shots turn covid something far less threatening. pro's con's like choosing car based cupholders. general consensus costs/benefits vaccine vs. vaccine *specifically young people*? shot takes 1 hour, 2x month. It‚Äôs easy.

Wearing helmet car rest life would massive inconvenience.

Also, shot protects around you, helmet not.

Also shot free, helmet not.

Also, one important- you‚Äôre donkey. Zero question India either lying massively counting Covid-19 fatalities. could maybe tell people, yeah? I‚Äôm saying condition may near asymptomatic cause problems later. physically? 100%. Including mentally? Less probably still people.

Since pandemic started started running, play team sport basically often now, started eating healthier replacing gym lifting functional strength bodyweight exercises. I've also probably drinking less.
It's hard healthier pandemic, things outside open lot time think stuff like exercise diet Fuck it, go spit people's mouths sneeze nose. universities already require half dozen vaccines intend attend person.

Hand Foot Mouth already pops enough. word ""jab"" need inserted every British headline? could left word vaccine substituted clear.  area high prevalence, would still slightly cautious numbers start come down. still risk virus high prevalence. state like California something, extremely low risk. I'm fully vaccinated California zero concerns. say Michigan, I'd cautious next weeks. says ""study finds"" must true. Canada ask started trip generally. I've never go passport history we're apparently COVID times well. dont kill messenger Nonsense. 

They‚Äôd never restrictions case. Americans want restrictions, politicians implemented likely lose careers it. even implement first place science? know part make sense. explain Italy suffered quite bad covid? i'm correct lot people smoke there. Plus fun triple mutants... No? home infect immediate household. That's bubbles thing. gotta bring Mountain Dew levels up. Give everyone gets vaccinated $100 bucks you‚Äôll take care lazy people  r/murderedbywords I‚Äôd interested see math this. doubt good comparison. fact found handful doctors signing disproportionately huge chunk ""medical"" exemptions.

I'm scientist that's reviewed data covid studies spare time myself. honest--if actually training ability make heads tails study like this, pushing blatantly uninformed opinion leans conspiracy theories mass media manipulation. 

Either go get degree become scientist, pipe let scientists speak. Liability exemptions thing [with every even ones that've around decades. companies manufacturing paranoid, like businesses usually potential liability. There's nothing special COVID vaccine here. also mandated flu shots last fall top prevent flu cases taking hospital time Oh trust me, that's mean. right bulletproof logic. This! Please give us right choose. want go back office ü§Æ Kay tough guy. Considering 20% West Virginians children 18, ineligible vaccine, think they're getting 70% entire population time soon. schools attend? Vaccinations records (not covid) mandatory schools I've attended. hate freedom? fuckin hope so, man. whole thing gutted faith Americans. state currently sitting 13.6%, rising. Hospitalizations town steadily increasing, fuckhead governor removed mask mandate schools (you know, *only* sect population *can't* get vaccine). see signs getting significantly worse gets better. Sure I‚Äôm invincible, guarantee I‚Äôm healthy friend. What? It‚Äôs rare all. Lots women periods pregnant. told mot rely missed periods determine pregnancy. person uterus?  terrible use statistics. author comparing deaths past flu seasons, mask wearing, social distancing open schools covid deaths masks, social distancing classes conducted Zoom. 

A apples apples comparison would confirmed deaths children flu since January 2020 confirmed deaths Covid time frame. would shocked flu number 10 20 Covid restrictions side benefit drastically reducing effects flu past winter. state (Washington) ZERO flu deaths season anyone age. That‚Äôs unprecedented. 

Another thing. Flu deaths estimated. confirmed like Covid deaths usually are. number flu deaths children extrapolation available data rarely test flu.  don‚Äôt think ever basis reality Send way. folks can‚Äôt quite understand people don‚Äôt want get vaccinated, we‚Äôre clearly supply constrained get worse approve use teens. UK acceptance rate incredible. Jealous.  send country needs wtf Though it‚Äôs documented rare Nooo totally fine! Remember still 50% people get side effects all. Since got fully vaccinated, many friends family members well. single one experienced much. sole exception mother law whose work insisted get vaccination 3 weeks testing positive Covid. side effects nasty (but like hospital severe anything).  need worry :) California variant? New York variant? BLM rallies last summer showed substantial increase cases mass gatherings outside, obvious months now. better worker protections require workers show work respiratory illness fear fired. opposite. Lmao dawg. Waiting tell need 5 shots. üòÇ mask. 1 mask enough need 2 more. UK, AstraZeneca vaccine longer recommended people 30, since higher chance developing brain clots becoming seriously ill/dying COVID. currently deliberating whether raise limit age 40, risk-benefit ratio also good 30-40 group (I read Financial Times article someone posted earlier.) 

The J&amp;J vaccine, resumed US, likely come warnings clots, and/or restricted certain age groups. clotting affected women age 20-50, CDC found risk 3 times higher would expect general population. 

I know countries completely ditched AZ vaccine (like Denmark) since found risks outweighed benefits.

As Moderna/Pfizer vaccines, yet heard major problems, still soon tell. clinical trials won‚Äôt another 2 years. above

To what? two secondary sources get info source /u/nightcrawleronreddit gave you? sources back damn thing saying, first one actually CDC also continues recommend **people fully vaccinated keep taking precautions public places**, like wearing mask, staying least six feet apart others, avoiding crowds poorly ventilated spaces, washing hands often,"" 

Literally nightcrawler told you. thing CDC says ok post-vaccination gathering vaccinated people. supposed respond here? refute statement all. even asked provide source info, dig one up?

I found [your though seeing bothered. Again, say damn thing vaccinated people needing follow guidelines. data regarding breakthrough cases. know that's nearly statistic matters, right?

Fauci, back december, made clear population would need vaccinated us approach level normalcy. We're current already running [vaccine we're near 75% mark, acting like we're clear? last ...polls suggest **significant portion** Americans refuse take shots, potentially **stalling nation‚Äôs recovery** pandemic... 

Celebrating win game really, really stupid. need continued caution vaccines roll out. suck wear damn mask. Holy fuck can't believe people still bitching them.

That's completely fine. That's CDC says ok start post-vaccination; gather vaccinated people. problem CDC still recommends following guidelines **in public**. Which, I'm standing, talking about. supposed interpret this: Now, choose maintain extra social distancing feel need it, that's fine. you. see scientific reason tell everyone keep level restrictions before. 

as talking indoors? Everyone thread talking eating indoor restaurants shit. deniers see vaccinated people **out public** following guidelines they're going give **whatever guidelines they've begrudgingly starting following**. 

It's simple follow don't. There's rising level compliance, however small. They'll give instant see 'radical left' about, vaccinated not. 

You answer important question asked vaccine-resistant mutation gets foot hold denier-rich neighborhood stop spreading? 

It's like virus going able tell stubborn assholes anyone else. ideally, I'm realistic think acceptance rate high enough achieve otherwise. saying day one.

Risk self-- public health experts determined risk Corona virus vaccine less risk virus. Yes, correct young person likely mild disease. young person, also less likely ever experienced type moderate severe disease life harder put perspective.
You could mild Corona virus symptoms feel unwell days. type ""unwell"" severe sniffles. example, sick enough week barely drag body bed toilet four times day, hospital, that's considered mild disease. let tell you, actually living week... feels like forever.

Link commentary: purposely obtuse? real. I'm Christian I've studied theology lot essentially legit religious exemption vaccines. getting vaccinated, lack science literacy special religious priority. According number Indian posters, both. Difficult get testing scale problem levels government making much effort accurate count either. state asymptomatic rate referring to? infection rate? nah guess uneducated guess immune systems fighting virus whole time halfway job. vaccine gave immune systems right instructions things finally started going well, stay virus free long keep boosters. West Va get 70%, even less hope FL. Kinda lose leverage open EVERYTHING last summer, tell local gov't can't enforce fines, etc.

So FL plateaued 5-6K per day; race Michigan consistently worst. Possitivity 10% last looked.

This article linked above. conflating two different studies. one 6 cases triggered pause first place. WellI mean sample population increases Numbers subject change. it‚Äôs really basic statistics Nah Totally normal sucks. Moderna side effects unfortunately. Holy fucking shit. periods go off-cycle sorts reasons, including stress. nervous vaccine would definitely induce mental stress, mention added physical stress body dealing antigens introduced. Anecdotal info periods off-cycle one two months anything worry about. point data collected people ties tobacco industry means analysis, treatment integrity even integrity data collection question.

Oh well then, maybe US shouldnt hoarding MILLIONS vaccine doses acually act like supposed ""leader"" ""free"" world Exactly. wonder people anti-vaxx masking ü§™ though fuck ppl risk getting sick vaxxed person sooooo follow science guess? I'm firefighter every person department getting tested every week last year. People tested positive also numerous antibody tests. vast majority either developed antibodies lost within 2 months.

That may half tested positive asymptomatic. Many others mild symptoms. extremely sick March 2020 kept natural antibodies got vaccines December January. boosted levels 20 fold  attended CSU did, require full set vaccines could attend, even live campus. [usual set rate 2 weeks like day getting vaccine? Cause used lot higher 2 weeks later. issue take extensive care myself? Yeah use interchangeably talk shot... American. better asking current vaccination, one first, wear fall That‚Äôs efficacy works damn it. another failing public health messaging.

First off, calm down. got hot writing response read whole conversation COVID infected 10 100 people, situation 100 vaccinated 1 person would infected.

Yes, literally everyone understands this. change fact 10 people still danger fail mask social distance reaching herd It‚Äôs 10% still get corona. That‚Äôs statistics work. take account chance infection mean anything.

You take account reach reliable number regarding herd immunity. discussion 10% danger reaching herd immunity, 10% danger people vaccinated OP saying hear messages masks going away social distancing stopping we're yet - purely thinks sway antivaxxers won't. Statistics matter, context post replying top 1 person infected isn‚Äôt getting serious illness.

This simply true. recently major case vaccinated nurse infected elder care center worked vaccinated people died result. vaccine mean everyone magically immune - saying fucking idiotic send message ""mask social distance"" we're sure thing control. I‚Äôm 24 weeks pregnant get mine weekend, it‚Äôs something feel comfortable family baby weighing knowns unknowns. also totally understand mom wants wait baby born questions concerns outweigh getting it, especially without longer term studies would impossible point. plan participating CDCs data collection experiences pregnant women vaccine learn much possible quickly possible women make informed decisions vaccine future. Congrats new baby. CDC recent study showed 80% 2 weeks 1 dose 90% 2 doses American healthcare workers. Higher study post lower study link. Here's thing long one dose provides half protection two doses, every study shows, giving two people one dose provide total protection giving one person two doses. great job vaccinating things related. Covid ate it‚Äôs way LA winter leaving unreal amount immunity path really isn‚Äôt it‚Äôs public health concern don‚Äôt want students dying dorms exposed COVID-19 there‚Äôs available vaccine.

Chill dude. discussion use different vaccine got AstraZeneca (first dose) Health Canada determines can‚Äôt used age 40 going forward. maybe using different mRNA nursing homes PQ Moderna sourced. NACI doesn‚Äôt recommend mixing vaccines time research done.  hypothesis virus lingers long covid patients immune system can't fight virus optimally. vaccines give immune system extra power fight virus. Would like see mRNA vaccines especially adept whether applicable vaccines. quite disappointed nurse aunt explained getting covid big deal , body builds immunity get infected... vaccine kills people ... blah blah blah 

 


I'm tempted send study . know someone whose medicine long could weak conceptualization feel healthier mean healthier . Even he's looking self-interest, would realize getting vaccinated allow reduction preventative measures return normalcy. OP can't grasp that, well, they're bright. swear god multiple articles title like 60 consecutive weeks respect others health lives. Young, healthy people die too.

Then think many potentially pregnant women could've taken women vaccine, waited enough time give birth, collected data - almost impossible get legit data short time 

Studies happening right - real pregnant women, we'll able get first less legit results year two - saying 

But end day wife decide less lethal means would less incentive treat vaccinate it. would create selection pressure. That's HIPPA violation Imagine that. country Covid cases highest deaths aggressively immunizes citizens. I'm 27. refuse tell refuse give business, there's real moral reason tell you. Hold up, telling American government prioritized getting citizens vaccines looking outside borders???? That‚Äôs crazy!! 70% eligible never tested positive, never tested someone got J&amp;J NY, wish research real-world effectiveness vaccine. Food thought: case count per capita 12% US case per capita, tests per capita 15% US testing per capita. exactly chose get vaccine. already two kids, unfortunately need sure I'll too. 

I waited days shy second trimester get first shot, three weeks later got second (Pfizer). tried headache couple days. biggie. Plenty people look extremely small risk still want it. truly frightening depressing. Good.

Nonetheless, want take vaccine, freedom to. freedom drag employer patients - trashed immune systems Cancer - along choice. freedom refuse disinfect going sterile operating room, smoke patients room, either.

The metric hit.

I'm sure they'll announce next milestone shortly two metrics come within view. impatience lack common sense astounds. risk tiny. US overflow vaccines, EU JJ vaccine crucial part getting everyone vaccinated timely matter. risk unvaccinated compared JJ vaccine much larger. mistrust outside ""vaccines work prevent Covid serious symptoms deaths"" ""the benefits largely outweighs risks"" proven scientific studies independent said governments? fuck WV ever going get 70% partially vaccinated.... 70% eligible population 70% total population? latter, WV get ever, first, it'll another 2-3 months...  politicians following availability rather using position queue jump. Tbh ethical way. Plus position health he's rather low risk bet he'd get best treatment contract it. 

Getting AZ vaccine think important people hesitant one even though safe effective First- vaccine, believe work etc etc.

Some doctors keep saying winter could see another spike, I‚Äôve yet see numbers attached. Surely won‚Äôt go back last winter unless variant somehow evades vaccine?  Pretty sure somewhere mutate mutate anywhere.... New... York.... New.....Yoooorrrkkkkk worldwide cases past week came India.‚Äù They‚Äôre suffering enormous wave right case graph looking damn near vertical. unfortunate. certain point, need seriously consider public health guidance switching gears ""fully vaccinated people done masks distancing"" order curtail vaccine hesitancy.

Maybe now, yet.

But early/mid-June, first-dose vaccination stalling around 58%, we're seeing huge reduction hospitalizations community spread like expect? Yeah, put table.

""You can't go back normal even get shot"" huge morale blow I'd bet opposite enshrined, able entice 5%, maybe 10% overall population fence.

""But anti-maskers lie vaccinated!""

Okay. objection implies sub-group sub-group.

Group A: People enticed towards vaccination promise get lives back. would otherwise bothered shot.

Group B: People following restrictions, longer promise offered Group A. would gotten shot regardless.

Pursuant many people actually comprise sub-groups, becomes question whether marginal benefit Group exceeds marginal cost Group B. Sort like [scene Fight (but less macabre).

What benefit get Group A? people vaccinated hamper ability virus spread. also virtually guarantees none wind hospital, morgue, long-term COVID-19 complications.

What cost Group B incur us? might spread virus more.

But like likelihood goes 0% 100%.

Just they're following restrictions mean 0% chance spreading virus. Human error, risk compensation, physical limitations non-N95/equivalent masks, etc.

And stop following restrictions mean they'll 100% start spreading. They'll recouping population immunity effect even we're herd immunity: 50%+ vaccinated, virus would simply fewer paths them. portion Group B likely already natural immunity.

So maybe something like they'll go 20% 65% likely infectious virus. (Just spitballing.)

So risk harm pose population? really start hitting vaccination plateau, people possibly spread would be:

 - adults decided vaccinated  
 - Not-yet-eligible children (who generally higher risk flu)  
 - High-risk people medically ineligible vaccine (unfortunate, large group, one that's ever going 100% protection, one also live cautiously even pandemic)  
 - rare vaccinated adults virus breaks (who virtually guaranteed mild asymptomatic cases)

So social benefit Group exceed cost incurred Group B?

Like said, maybe today. maybe eight weeks it'll different story.

At point, we're still willing let go restrictions vaccinated people, ask ourselves: really important? Winning war behavioral control sub-group dishonest anti-maskers/anti-vaxxers, winning war net public health benefits versus costs? read? said metric phase 5 hit additional vaccination goal would remove mask mandate. telling happening Illinois Chicago someone lives here. things open again.

This gets root it. want people get AZ regardless risks concerned individual public health, concerned able go shopping/to bar quickly possible, ending furlough schemes soon possible. Okay excuses NYC residents now. 5 weeks today (or let‚Äôs say 6 give people whole week) NYC needs lift restrictions. probably won‚Äôt, literally excuse get vaccinated want don‚Äôt want it, good luck immune system  do. dont want rna vaccine Why? didnt get sick ansymptomatic carrier going somehwere get tested could possibly spread it. Even get sick, would pretty sure sick test wouldnt really tell much didnt already know  normal show peoples medical business?  obviously apply usage us regular schmucks spending quality time around COVID patients. continue use N95 KN95 masks errands hang sunlight 30 minutes. make 70-80% fully vaccinated? Push results actually want see, copout. pfizer True, unless work 100 high risk people (say healthcare workers ppe) Yeah lmao I'm actually idiot.

""the gubmint?"" results peer reviewed discussed scientists 100+ countries including allies bigger question pause ends still wants thing? Like, yeah sucks make two appointments (I got Moderna, personally), can‚Äôt imagine people already waiting long get vaccinated want get J&amp;J even it‚Äôs convenient. I'm panicking point, India looks like turning giant variant factory right now. even bother conversation all, body choice. able refill national stockpile now. smart compare US. couse need vaccinate 3 million people day since massive population. Proportionally, we‚Äôre vaccinating rate now. Canada vaccinating 3 million day would comparable US vaccinating 30 million day. That‚Äôs logistical impossibility. ugh still requiring masks social distancing protect unvaccinated populations, whats fucking point get sentiment hesitancy due history, rich privileged white people cutting lines get jabbed, would lead believe vaccines safe get. astounding consider much we're going study era history knowing we're living it. many trends status quo disrupted! find press statement accompanied vizualisation: refusing tell means vaccinated. child's dentist told us even sat everyone office already vaccinated waiting second dose. look another dentist. know sucks fair Africa always going last comes jabbing arms.

Now US UK well way tapping demand, suspect inequity diminish somewhat. American population support distributing vaccines allies neighbors, US purchased stock it. ALWAYS intended single use masks. won‚Äôt! can't help think Trump would actual PSAs would help ton wife received J&amp;J vaccine last month fine Nobody knows sure. Hopefully fall well back masks enough people get vaccinated cases don‚Äôt fall dramatically colleges worried liability may still require them. We‚Äôll much better idea august. pandemic taught us lot change couple months think good reason believe may necessary. complaining gone phase 5 yet?

Funny, CDC godliness say vaccinated people congregate vaccinated people private settings. guess that's ""no change behavior"" tho. unlimited talk text sure kicks ass health care. own, science based. dumbass nurse doesnt want get vaccinated go work oncology ward people dont even immune system I'm glad theyll fired. dont get ignore data common sense regarding kinds fields work, health care different?

Really? That's think? EU banned exports, like US, would far farther rollout. didn't, made sure countries also get fair share. US, meanwhile, happy enough let means J&amp;J, Moderna, Pfizer, sell huge quantities globe decided keep instead. EU supplying US' closest allies neighbours. much reluctance America get vaccine? read somewhere they're finding difficult find people take vaccine, 50% vaccinated.

I totally agreed closing schools pandemic hit, data, think time reopen kids/parents want return person learning. Honestly sooner even. I'd say memorial day. key metrics going plus seasonality plus vaccinated. We‚Äôre starting hit wall antivax nut jobs vaccinating half adults. 

I'm sure that's issue, yet. think we're hitting wall people care enough getting vaccinated schedule appointment. past year, news talking ""Killing grandma."" Well, 80% ""Grandmas"" gotten vaccinated, lot people mindset worth trouble personally concerned getting vaccinated.

Walk ins help since makes process even easier, think open constructive discussions ending restrictions would help even more. kind stuff happen because, like said, we're hitting wall, pretending everything fine without changes solve issue. Moderna takes two weeks second shot max effectiveness (and J&amp;J two weeks one done), went two weeks blanket statement? 

I know, week two days second Pfizer, considering fully vaccinated now. got hair done yesterday first time 14 months, grabbed drink indoor bar last night, plan in-store shopping weekend. Flying visit in-laws next weekend, too, I'm nervous, due usual fears turbulence, COVID. 

I've cautious entire time, I'm vaccinated, time live life again. thing happened Moderna doses ""asymptomatic testing"" refers testing people WITHOUT symptoms. saying ""asymptomatic carrier"". could also say non-symptomatic. Testing non/a symptomatic people going lead lot false positives, especially population circulation low is. BTW county originally said orange/yellow tier test asymptomatic people, yet schools demanding anyways unions.  right they‚Äôll still blame ‚Äúbig city liberals‚Äù somehow. ""Fully vaccinated"" rather arbitrary term. actually know maximum immunity achieved. 

14 days kind like 6 foot rule, makes sense practically easy implement like 5'11"" unsafe 6' 1"" perfectly safe. I'm opinion never reach 70% vaccinated number minimum necessary begin thinking reaching sort herd immunity. Maybe sort scenario like 50% vaccinated 20% already contracted degree natural immunity likely outcome. I'm reminded old saying ""You lead horse water can't make drink."".  think one way incentivising vaccination rollback government subsidies covid treatment vaccination. free cost later think lot folks decide get shot. would rather listen Q Fauci that's you. Hmmm never crossed mind. can't take vaccine. remember hearing pregnant woman could take assumed kids well. Honestly thought hospital first receive vaccine??? pointed requirements you, remember? one read cited. 

You call people idiots, 100% current messaging state get vaccinated can't change behavior, driving vaccine apathy. state reasons India‚Äôs covid growth mishandling true. excuse US ban raw materials vaccines. 

Though agree, India prepared think ‚Äúexternal sources‚Äù raw materials all. Appreciate comments like this. day 5 still feel 80%. I'm sure I'll 100% shortly. Anxious I'm sure head. Dose 1 nothing compared dose 2, I'm bad yeah person want get vaccinated go work different hospital. I'm hoping lot remaining people lazy schedule appointments anti-vax. imagine waiting J&amp;J come back well (have friends like this, convince get vaccines). Fortunately nobody believes RW Canadians anymore. ""Family member works healthcare"" = saw post facebook. Primarily price higher. Pre-pandemic, could get 50 N95's $10. Hey now, that‚Äôs nice. Cruz looks like recently shaved ballsack. 

Don‚Äôt mad us sending you.  Hasn‚Äôt India also one prior wave COVID? mention Indian population younger US, age #1 risk factor COVID death. Plus India less obesity.

So deaths may undercounted India, highly doubt it‚Äôs anywhere close 13x undercounted. fair lot credibility. still want fully vaccinated people wear masks stay 6 feet away people about. also want people wear masks alone outside. think following sort science.

Is organization uses science data advice? binary. Someone partial immune response may contract covid would otherwise; someone exposed significant viral load might contract even vaccination complete (rare, happens). vaccination helps severity either way. one today. many more. Phs also papers effects 3 weeks piece shit. Good hear got cleared out! yeah, idea. thought face neck that's it. No, cuz UAE isn‚Äôt accepting passengers India right now. "" risks equivalent, course: Kids 8,700 times less likely die COVID-19 [compared older ‚Äúeven risk particularly high, you‚Äôre still going extra protective kids,‚Äù says Sandra Albrecht, epidemiologist Columbia. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs human nature.‚Äù ""

Yeah...no. serious understatement. many things much dangerous kids covid, expose daily basis live lives; can't take fear we've adults covid transfer kids, react differently, ""extra-cautious kids""--it's totally inappropriate terrible risk calculation. Yes thanks vaccines tough Yep, inference. important relevant digesting media mean yeah, 1/125,000 people allergic reaction.

There's really way avoid that, that's true medication, really food anything else put body.

Give humanity 950,000,000 bananas see allergic reactions similar scale Better wasted I'm sorry loss. hope find peace. Get back someone actually loses job healthcare coming sick. No, you‚Äôre much likely lose coming in. Pre-pandemic, either hospital, hospital. 

Methodist scores win three fronts: good PR, excising anti-vax element among staff, decreasing absenteeism asymptomatic covid. Die........ I'm sure mean. Long term effects what? vaccine? something else? haven‚Äôt eaten inside restaurant year it‚Äôs obviously unsafe unmasked strangers share airspace community significant COVID numbers.

Same here. crazy sitting inside bunch maskless strangers. way? isn‚Äôt Interesting Approval requires six months worth study data. Pfizer Moderna already that, asked full FDA approval. hurry protect literal plague? TL;DR There's ***specific*** known reason get booster year, crazy possibility either, think non-panicky conversation mostly prepared possibility.

The vaccines verified work reasonably well variants **currently** (with varying degrees evidence).

When scientists discuss possible need boosters, usually either 1) know long protection last, and/or 2) they're considering possibility new variant show ***actually does*** reduce vaccine efficacy significantly.

\#1 looks pretty good now, major indications suggesting vaccine-induced immunity lasting quite (but course know know).

\#2 main reason ***everyone, even young/less-at-risk people, get vaccinated***. allow virus circulate, chances give virus develop new mutations could chip away vaccine-induced immunity.

It may likely (like rolling 100-sided die), people allow get sick, times we're re-rolling die new mutation. Oh yeah? How's Kentucky doing? Handing money? America world lol. lol People even get 20 days vacation time. I‚Äôm looking forward 18-29 reaching 50% first dose.

1 mad extensive tests . 
Now think allergic PEG .
She well moment. 
But done . md said everything checked check allergies. 
Big mistake Eh, there's lot people varying reasons -- actually met single person that's full ""this hoax going get freedoms destroyed"" whatever real life, lot vaccine holdouts know like:

* ""Eh, well, I'm young, even get covid probably really affect me, I'm hurry""
* ""It's kind far, appointments hard make, I'll wait bit""
* ""[x] person know/that related crazy side effect [that fever] I'm little bit scared -- I'll wait""

Not everyone extreme point view, people listing reasons know, they're relatively normal, well-adjusted people.

Biontech developed core bits vaccine first supply chain mass manufacturing worked out. partnered companies lot heavy lifting supply chain side, including harder parts like actual mRNA production. Chugging along. Little lower hopefully we‚Äôll get back know there‚Äôs lot concern ab raw number first doses dropping, also fewer people still need first doses. 

80%+ aged 65 already one vaccine, ~60% 50‚Äì64.

As long we‚Äôre hitting .5%+ per day getting vaccinated among eligible age groups, still think we‚Äôre well. (All ranged .6%‚Äì.7% today)  fluid scientist Youtube (Aaron Collins) done measurements this. measurements masks worn 40 hours showed degradation. think probably reasonable number going grocery store. said, want walk ICU ward mask old. 


40 hours point N95/KF94 pretty worn (with bands breaking polypropylene bit frayed). seems reasonable me. exactly, herd immunity also achieved immunization (vaccinations), body built immune response without virus ever entering body. can't think place reached herd immunity solely everyone getting infected.

Also, everyone needs infected vaccinated reach herd immunity, achieved natural reproduction number R0 virus falls 1. didn‚Äôt mean sound like sort misery dick measuring contest, surprised case numbers low per capita basis considering footage coming India. worried people injected live-virus vaccines, could 'shed' virus infect others. super rare existent chance possible -- EXCEPT COVID VACCINES LIVE VIRUS VACCINES lol....But stupid stupid does, even explained, numerous businesses still standing firm this. Morons. Take vaccine.

Sinovac Sinopharm give substantial immunity. good others, something, lot better nothing. get away Cincinnati sure, last 4 presidential elections overwhelmingly favor Democrats though.

I think bigger concern point 3 think it...Ohio widely vaccines available anyone wants one month now, pool willing participate received shot previously gotten Covid likely pretty small. Again, they're asking 30-50 people though hopefully they're able find enough candidates--the $950 participation $$ help Welp tried. herd want immunity there's much do. reason.

But short list illegal reasons like race age. SF indoor dining last year. open weeks fall reopen till like Feb. guess meant (2021) year might true now. purposely ignoring taking anything away people vaccinated? attend virtually. Mandatory vaccines returning person learning.

By logic, public elementary school student FORCED vaccinate vaccines mandatory. good thing. unvaccinated child (or young adult case) absolutely right spread preventable illness public areas, absolutely free chose homeschool children. 

When vaccine comes along FDA approval whatever, stop offering virtual classes vaccinated individuals, since rules pre covid would still apply. Covid another mandatory vaccination like ones already exist. Frame patriotic choice recover economy (because matter think covid over, others return normal case/vax numbers show it). Frame race us countries. Get shots people woodland camo hats vax stickers chanting ""USA! USA!"" good. Moderna 80 percent effective 2 weeks first shot. Congratulations vaccine. dude, vastly undercounted real figure somewhere around 10-17k day gonna rise least month  people know hurry. got second pfizer yesterday arm even sore. üò≤

Regardless, place needs fix mistake. think that's accurate way put it. (Doctors scientists sit room plan ""Hey.. lets make sure design 2nd shot intentionally make people sicker 1st shot!"")

You're body tends react significantly 2nd shot because:

* body already 1st shot.. immune system knows ""invader"" is.. reacts aggressively. 

* 2nd dosage larger.. body handle already 1st ""primer"" shot. 

It's designed ""boost &amp; train immune system"". .and ""make sick"" nearly scale.

For instance, southern California, providing free dodgers ticket anyone getting vaccinated could great way getting people board, younger groups, even something simple $50 textbook certificate local college could also useful. 


The government (obviously people using approach, unlikely becomes), try fill gap, could useful. themselves?  Really interesting. learned something today! Thanks thoughtful response Can't get infected dead Might variants? least germany, vocid infections B137, similar many countries.

Take care mental health transition back normalcy yall. everyone wants vaccine chance become fully vaccinated, re-open everything drop restrictions. There's sense waiting people get vaccinated refuse vaccine anyways... let take chances. rest us want go back normal. Right? try reply politely also super frustrating someone would reply information they're sure related vaccination. Especially something serious bold saying get immunity. Thanks re-inforcing vaccines provide immunity -- hopefully people read comment OPs. Probably, old attenuated vaccines still development early trials, mRNA vaccines widespread. Thus would still strict lockdowns watching ICU fill rates. Though perhaps latter year things would good. Got Walgreens half mile house (literally walked there). 20 minutes out, 15 minutes post-vaccine waiting period.

If University Western Australia maintained online learning WFH instead getting students staff back campus, perhaps happened guy stayed one residential colleges. Like, still middle god damn pandemic, come on. I‚Äôm talking people Reddit claiming know vaccinated people got COVID. know redditors American?  studies show reinfection common. happen, reinfections known rare infected. happen reinfections usually mild compared original illness. known length time long natural acquired immunity lasts, say definitely ""fragile short lived"" evidence based. Please spread misinformation. understand. get back normal unless more. India evidence that. vaccines effective variants. hundreds variations India present moment. cannot vaccinate them. 70 kids hospitalized nothing tighter restrictions don‚Äôt happen Globally far poorer countries, don‚Äôt think Pfizer produce 1.8b 2 years. also let‚Äôs keep mind pfizer still expensive vaccine, vaccines market. Hopefully companies like AZ JJ able fix purity issue (if that‚Äôs really causes clots) production issues. hopefully contenders solution ready well (regavax, valvena, ...) Bad enough I'd willing take suggestion another parent, people childcare vaccinated well month. also totally reasonable work babysitters vaccinated.

Another way think getting vaccinated protect kids. things start opening liability unvaccinated. Fewer things done remotely may interact unmasked people.

Get vaccine protect kids. can't imagine guilty would feel got daughter seriously sick decided follow recommendations free vaccine. [Here paper provides evidence vaccination substantial impact levels results ONS survey, stating 10% people test positive covid symptoms twelve weeks paper stating vaccines high level efficacy infection, symptoms (which default prevent chronic post viral logic, guess I‚Äôll go diet ensure neighbour loses weight. 

It ensure someone else become ill. certainly ensure make somebody else ill.

Or put another way:

You can't stop neighbor run car everything power avoid hitting neighbor car.

Feel free ask questions. actual scientist, may help. I'm vaccines. eventually take vaccine turn. Also need AZ vaccine take it. i'm saying understand young people take vaccine. 

Because old people people higher risk vaccinated. protected. family talking already vaccinated. taking vaccine give higher chance dying protect exactly? i've many bars maskless since started allowing like 6 months ago i've gucci distribution specificities bounded (can't lower 0 higher 1) considered 'beta distribution.' median biased estimate toward bound. 

For example, let's say want know odds fan b-ball game hitting half-court prize shot. test giving 100 fans 3 chances hit shot. 95 miss 3 shots. 4 hit one 1 hits 2/3. (each fan may distinct probability likely better others, know one we're gonna get limited insight good one is). 

Now want ""best"" estimate random fan hit one prize shots. Using median, say 0 (the median mode 0%). Using mean, we'd get \~5%. Even fans missed 3 shots, 0% chance success. slightly higher (how much know).

Alternatively, could take 100 NBAs best free throw shooters give 3 shots each. lets say 70 hit 3, 25 get 2/3 5 get 1/3. best estimate picking one predicting performance given free throw? median mode 100%, mean would 89%. would 89% confident hit free throw (even picked one got 3/3 test run even picked person hit 1/3).

As make test trial larger, instead 3 shots give 10 shots, see distribution shift toward 'true' representation middle many players get 8 9 shots, thus shifting mode away bound making median better representation true best estimate. happens, median biased. 

Similarly, huge trials tests, would likely see many fall away 100% specificity (it can't get better since can't get specific bounded). happens, using median biased toward bound. 

When DOH nurse called me, told skeptical (but course agreed quarantine) asked thought odds repeat test positive, given asymptomatic vaccinated. said likely not. According calculations, much less likely not. turned not. That's essentially value trying this. want able predict transmit infection get sick. never see future certainty, hone sharpen understanding probabilities better predict future. better job predicting future good understanding statistical modeling (i call model now, thanks).

Say covid outbreak (which gonna happen almost surely). think government still snap lockdowns stamp clusters. know vaccines 100% effective throw variants mix, covid never going away. guess want understand post vaccination world going look like countries adopted zero covid. think also help people get *their* doctor. Lots people certain areas USA trust ""gubment"" trust personal physician.  you‚Äôre asking merit claim, don‚Äôt know way better looking either info came from. mean makes sense, adults vaccinated there's one group still exposed, children. 

Since children likely show severe symptoms (although still important remember still possibility get bad to) think might big deal general right? serious things look into, like showing elevated Biomarkers Related Blood Vessel Damage **in Children SARS-CoV-2 Regardless Disease Severity.**

What consequences could blood vessel damage lead to? TMA (Thrombotic Microangiopathy), clots. medical condition tiny blood clots damage smallest blood vessels result injury brain kidneys.

In children cancer, TMA associated increased risk severe illness late life, high blood pressure, early kidney damage, cardiovascular disease.

Microvascular Injury Brains Patients Covid-19.

TMA symptoms also intersect lot long covid symptoms - Fatigue, Dizziness, Shortness breath, Bruises, Confusion, Sleepiness, Seizures, High blood pressure, Fever, Neurological manifestations, etc.

I think pretty important information I'm going write separate comment thread top reply you. trapped Western Australia?

I'm guessing 21 days design allow 14 days vaccine take effect, another 7 days infections incurred first 14 days manifest. Or, may tried determine infection happened, culled results came 21 days. Either way seems pretty clear ""X effective days"" exactly study attempts determine. look numbers compare Pfizer easy come conclusion Janssen safer vaccine Pfizer. 

The reason simple: Janssen, single shot vaccine, need drive vaccination location once. Pfizer two times, puts double risk dying traffic.^(/s) would wary using masks long. point seem start disintegrating, want breathing little mask particles. interesting going forward moves.

And then, also take account time scale. hospitalizations 4 months. person rejects AZ today, take 4 months offered mRNA vaccine? think cases, answer take less.

I could tell standing 60-6000 feet away burning building amount unsafe, mean amount unsafe standing 6 inches it. That‚Äôs straight lie, said time time vaccinated people hangout vaccinated people without masks.

people average average intelligence think way N95s minimum protection brief exposures. Keep mind 95 means stops 95% particles certain size. Depending toxin (we really know viral load COVID-19 infection) certain amount time contaminated environment, probability infection N95 much different protection. Plus without eye protection, still another unprotected pathway infection. Really, properly fitted, full face respirators P100s way cover bases. write anything remotely similar that.  


I going let pass, since doubled deserved called out. remind proverb heard long time ago, goes something like this:

 
The emptiest cans make loudest noise.

If want appear like fool next time really dense? cannot compare J&amp;J published % directly Pfizer/Moderna. completely different things. compare efficacy one vaccine 2 weeks shot midst variants (J&amp;J), efficacy another vaccine 6 weeks first shot (and followup second shot) variants widespread (Pfizer/Moderna)? think?

Shit, months likely still get Pfizer booster shot even J&amp;J initial vaccine. like taking one type today would forever void taking another vaccine type future... Hospital workers spend lot time around immunocompromised patients could die otherwise mild infections.


If refuse COVID-19 vaccine, shouldn‚Äôt allowed work hospital.  believe case unpaused imminently. pause also make sure underestimating problem. example, believe take two weeks manifest, legitimate concern vast amount people vaccinated within prior two weeks could lurking problems, pause let's see really 6 approximately 8 million. Forunately seem less case. 

They articulated reason pause clearly avoid media undermining confidence vaccine. think #staythefuckhome crowd morphed ""but variants?"" crowd. everyone digesting article infers thing

‚ÄúIf‚Äù creates hypothetical, shouldn‚Äôt used base inference on. Multiple perspectives offered topics/discussions, like now. doesn‚Äôt really support assumption everyone perceives way. 100% fault one entity people infer things, it‚Äôs definitely fault headline/article case people don‚Äôt comprehend language it‚Äôs meant. Disenfranchising people just-so-happen disagree called dictatorship think 100 people say allowed die unnecessarily people stop wearing masks? think it‚Äôs odd position take, well threshold right now.  celebrate we've counted dead. fellow Indian, I'm shit scared Michigan Detroit count.

Every vaccine world either weakened form virus (Covaxin developed India), produces spike proteins body (virus vector like AZ/J&amp;J/Sputnik mRNA like Pfizer/Moderna/Curevac) consists spike proteins directly (Novavax)  Yes no. early tell.

This first _confirmed_ death due reinfection variant almost certainly first.

Most cases dont get sequenced reported reinfections known _true_ reinfections. possible people undiagnosed symptomless, minor symptom cases, getting symptomatic infection getting diagnosed.

The good news, like suggestting, common weve detecting now.

The bad news. victim fairly young, 39, variant running rampant across Brazil areas like Manaus high infection rates crossed herd immunity threshold new cases hospitalizations remained high.

Theres still lot open questions. Big one long immunity last much protection left starts wane risk posed variants? Good know. google-fu lacking, I'd love know process people in-the-know expecting timeline. also thinking average case, lifetime pandemic countries apparently look FDA help make decisions countries.

Sounds right.  alternate headline actually, indoors safe, matter far apart people. must indoors people, wear mask stay short time possible. known awhile people got stuck hygiene theater marking 6 foot distances. Probably idiots. based data huge existing sample set. Here's actual non peer-reviewed study pre-print:

They're saying general population benefited it, 65% reduction. 
 
In fact, study says: ""Objectives: assess effectiveness COVID-19 vaccination preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection community."" article says ""Scientists team said findings supported UK‚Äôs decision prioritise giving first shots elderly vulnerable people delaying second doses."" appears relatively healthy/young person, worst thing happen vaccinated get exposed covid get cold. big deal.

I'm trying provide logical reasons sometimes there's overlap altruistic argument. bluntly honest stance initial comment sounded pretty uninformed me, claimed vaccine work. 

This started discussion vaccine efficacy anyway, refuted single point grounds, neither countered point vaccine safer covid. counter point trust information. forget US government distributing vaccine. largest scale, dozens countries getting vaccine people's arms fast can. Pfizer Moderna submitted vaccines EUA end last year 2 months safety data. Since 200 million doses used America alone 4+ month period. mention many world leaders received form vaccine, including former President Trump President Biden. Nearly recorded side effects previous vaccine seen within 2 months distribution. Again, choice, I'd hardly call vaccine untested point. tons available data without full FDA approval going done least next 8 months. 

I aware many instances past causing distrust government big pharma. ask situation hands now, sense vaccine spread simply widely circulation long huge red flags something truly wrong. Never response medical community scale, truly believe seeing vaccine moreso would scenario point history. point nothing else say, wish well, regardless whether thoughts inconsolable. care anyone says.

Yeah rate. Hi, understanding vaccines generally work correct! However, think sources hearing vaccine misunderstood statement 6 months. makers vaccine found remains highly effective *at least* six months; can't say longer distributed big enough numbers longer that, likely it'll last significantly longer htan -- probably least 12-18 months opinion, admittedly speculation.

Unfortunately, media sources saw press release misinterpreted mean vaccine *only* effective six months, true.

So reason efficacy might decrease time sometimes, memory cells produce antibodies die time selectively pruned away re-exposed thing they're supposed recognize. That's normal process, means every then, booster might needed remind memory cells die. There's also possibility mutation -- unlikely big concern near term, medium long term, mutations could slowly reduce efficacy vaccine, again, need booster get memory cells recognize new form.

* refusing perform medical intervention and/or 
* refusing provide private medical details said medical intervention, 

without 

* providing verifiable support continuing job cause disproportional risk others and
* showing reasonable measures prevent risk and
* providing legal basis.

The question becomes: case hospital? legal grounds fire workers based HIPAA protected private information? 

I think many us Reddit answer question sufficiently well. However, legal basis seems iffy. addition, kind blanket threats might set unwanted precedents future.

Perhaps different opinion you? article said, 22,2% population first dose. current average ~480k doses per day, 25% early may pretty much given (~2,3M people).

This totally line previous statements regaining trust vaccination efforts ""underpromise overdeliver"", hoped greater commitment, especially buying Sputnik doses Q2/3.
I preferred 33% first dose end may ( ~9M people), still seems feasable within 20 days current trajectory, given major issues arise.

I know rant valid critism, feels like generating positive headlines combat negative feedback new lockdown laws. I'm working home, going out, ordering groceries. Also, relatively healthy 31 year old, I'm far ""at risk"" group.

Why take potentially dangerous flight I'm taking flights first place? use cremation data estimate number cases deaths rather rely China's official data, [you'll get different China started hard lockdown started virus already rampant. higher number initial infections Wuhan, there's way virus would spread provinces resulted significant numbers cases.

This virus also cannot ""crushed"" agree due China's harsh restrictions, unlikely reached stage many thousands people dying day, China's data remotely accurate. think depends. adviced take whooping cough vaccine pregnant baby would protected. didn‚Äôt take it, I‚Äôm afraid needles, vaccinated kid little born instead. Yes, I‚Äôm horrible mum, I‚Äôm afraid needles let go it. 

There‚Äôs also fact breastmilk filled antibodies. 

So depends disease vaccine i‚Äôd say. end disproportionately shutting black people higher education, know black people much higher rates vaccine hesitancy. Late June here, I'm lucky I'll probably offered vaccination thanks work. Others age probably get second dose late August/ early September still requiring masks reasonable? point everyone eligible get vaccine appointment, labor day going unfilled. think right. thank feedback. 

All statistical calculations require assumptions. fully intend use fair unbiased assumptions, based feedback better justified assumed specificity (now estimate 99.4% based data, rather 99.9% based pure guess). 

NYT says 'a true positive likely' providing calculations. think 'estimate 95% false positive 5% true positive' ""factually"" correct implies exactly opposite, yes, getting odds requires assumptions.

Thanks again, try head advice! won‚Äôt lie, fully vaccinated nice.

It's like people fear mongering Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, yeah causes clots people, literally one 1 million, would inconsequential fully understood exactly causes it, immune system, particularly couple interleukin factors affect coagulatory cascade Sorry, typing phone, responding pointless comments assume automatically distrustful science default really warrant much effort book.  


By way, ""study"" analysis existing data. ""conclusion"", it. even read it? ""A variant called B.1.351, first appeared South Africa, may ability re-infect people recovered earlier versions coronavirus. might also somewhat resistant coronavirus vaccines development.""

Done throughout entire pandemic. anyone fit healthy year pandemic quarantine? think meant reply someone else. said pretty much reaction vaccine despite Covid past. 

As healthcare provider disagree hide side effects, though. People deserve fully informed decision making. Hiding reality side effects breeds distrust medical system, pharmaceutical industry government.  seems like topic discussion later on, think anyone impression permanent vaccine, way headlines reads vaccine effective. Yeah. Makes sense. Mass wants em wonder benefits financially people getting 3rd shot...kinda like pharmacy employees recive bonus talk one getting flu shot. Historically, every time go ""free"" anything -- usually annual wellness visit --- received invoices several hundred dollars.  US healthcare system, ""free"" means charged hundred bucks. saw ‚Äòem post records Facebook. also promise statewide pizza party! I‚Äôm saying vast majority people cease care sort mandates lockdowns hit point vaccination numbers. fascinating, thanks link. ok flu deaths every year, go fun. Awful. personally wear mask every second every day rest life, leave home absolutely necessary. think way vaccine passports events. make fence sitters get it. 276 people die per day blood clots, gambling man, I‚Äôm sure many people vaccines die blood clot next year without related Ok, go roll dice kids, then. heard people saying ‚Äúfitter‚Äù actually saying ‚Äúless obese‚Äù And, boss probably happy office full workers much less likely spend weeks hospital disease.  day PTO avoid weeks hospital bills, well worth it. 43 32 years smoking smoke free for....

234 days smoked 3282 cigarettes...based app.

I laughed covid hit read pro smoker study. knew time quit Covid good nudge. 

I'm happy say never think smoking...ever. crazy (good crazy).

I lucky physically active adrenaline sports semi pro / pro level whole life. think without I'd bad shape. Well long social pandemic over. I've pretty concerned catching social covid. I'm glad educate Daddy. really love educate. Asymptomatic spread much big player although many people Asymptomatic still unclear.  California's numbers lowest contintental US, maintained mask mandate slowly lifting restrictions. n=1 proclamations helpful. Anecdotal evidence - sister nurse working 2 different long term nursing facility. said half staffs 2 nursing facility got Covid(including her) none smoke got infected.   Based efficacy rates real world, flu shot nearly useless. gives real hope. big 3rd group, wait see / fence sitters. get vaccine don‚Äôt see point it. pretty bizarre. Like, I'm expecting entire world stay locked kids (and know risk get minimal), I'd still rather avoid getting possible. I'm trying throw Measles party here. use Moderna trials example:

ARR = (185/14073)-(11/14134) = .0124 1.24%

185 number people got COVID 14073 unvaccinated group. 11 number people got COVID 14134 vaccinated group. Also, participants necessarily ""exposed"". Many probably stayed home, wore masks etc. That's % numbers low. 

So absolute risk catching COVID unvaccinated group 185/14073 = 1.31%. 

The absolute risk catching COVID vaccinated group 11/14134 = .078%. 

So absolute risk reduction 1.3% (unvaccinated) - .078% (vaccinated) = 1.24%. 

Basically unvaccinated group caught COVID rate 1.31% goes .078% vaccinated group, total reduction '1.2%'. I'm rounding numbers add exactly. math, .078% happens 6% 1.31%. That's relative reduced risk 94% see 94% efficacy. 

You remember clinical trial period. trial period, 1.3% unvaccinated people caught COVID. That's problem using absolute risk. 1.3% caught trial, life end trial over. 98.7% end catching COVID months trial still catch later on. ""absolute risk"" number change longer time frame. let pandemic run unchecked, masks, vaccines, social distancing, better believe 1.3% catch COVID. 

Relative risk reduction good job showing vaccine efficacy. Absolute risk dependent time frame study protective measures taken. longer pandemic goes on, higher absolute risk trend. happens clinical trials finite time frame. Ice cream vaccine truck. I'm foaming mouth right now. God love vaccines. True doesn‚Äôt give incentive fence sitters get vaccinated. ever end? gearing another major lock-down? cogent questions lack empirical evidence. take chances thing like this! covid (supposedly)

Just stop. People experiencing real pain ""supposedly""-ing away. That's bs. Post covid syndrome real thing. Maybe several different things. Dysautonomia likely big part (I know POTS, one form dysautonomia, diagnosed post covid lot people). dysautonomia developed case flu 11 years ago. people forms dysautonomia, often developed viral illness, surprising others would develop covid given many millions people infected.

So quit underhanded bs. hard enough time getting doctors believe us. Invisible illnesses real. Okay Doctor, say. sure 60's obese, 20's fit healthy much. Well follow fucking data stick official recommendations Heath experts/officials. don‚Äôt want state give morons pass wear masks spread shit around like million Typhoid Marys people coffee industry shit Yeah, no. social pandemic ending fast there‚Äôs nothing government it. everyone wants vaccine people won‚Äôt care anymore. they? Get tested maybe careful next days know results. also dont worry much, good chance fine. Watch symptoms, maybe wear mask week. 1 week second dose pretty high protection. odds contracting one lunch slim. agree, frustrating. really encourage get it, stubborn people stubborn. feel like people honest you? know couple people said arent getting vaccine vast majority people life already it. see country 50% people one shot makes wonder many people saying got social pressure havent actually. 6.8 million think. covid kill you, lung caner might. officials health advisors blame people rather taking responsibility themselves

Well one think blame rests individuals. electeds much babysitting. fact individuals arent taking responsibility *precisely* problem. hate treat grown adults like children needs done, hats West Virginia knowing audience. risk probably low CDC's recommendation quarantine since fully vaccinated. Well done UK AZ!. Data lie! bad reactive proactive... little late... Downvoted caring his/her kids. sub lost mind.  Let's take Pfizer. risk getting infected placebo (non-vaccinated) group 0.88%. vaccinated group, risk 0.04%. difference two ""absolute risk reduction"". USA going faster UK. USA caught UK per 100 basis doses (66) moving quicker, soon surpassing them.

That said, UK great, too, huge deal. I‚Äôm upset much ‚Äúnormalized‚Äù, I‚Äôm tired fact even trying watch tv show see store logo, I‚Äôm reminded pandemic. yes *understand* it, enjoy seeing faces. show/commercial masks on, I‚Äôm rid ability even though always day day life. longer seeing face characters seeing live normally strange, anything else.

The U.K. highly successful annual flu vaccination program high uptake year, people familiar board getting jab  super informative chart posted within last 2 weeks illustrated rare complications vaccines showing cubes columns cube represented 150,000 doses. 

Does anyone link that? I‚Äôm searching everything think doom scrolling nothing. 

Thanks advance! road don‚Äôt get COVID reason!!! california? Don‚Äôt lowest cases? Nice! testing less cases  lot good decreases happening I'm worried anti vaxers. danger mitigated even get it.   information?   would really nice PCPs also following patients find doesnt yet holding back. high risk family friends test positive still waiting call one wait list signed months ago. tried telling call wasnt coming schedule one adamant. One already hospital...so frustrating. really God‚Äôs chosen people.

Them New Zealanders. sure get chosen God seems like‚Äôem. flu emerge ? Fortunately true.  would get second vaccine, long term immunity covid likely dependent getting second dose.

Also, risk blood clot around 1 1000 flight, 1 2000 taking contraceptive pill. Risk blood clot AZ 1 250,000. 

Obviously, think best talk doctor want best advice. contractor stop house yesterday bid work need completed outside backyard (I live USA) told could come house rather go around opened door conversation went like this:

Contractor: ""OK great, people let us go house. ""

Me: ""I'm fully vaccinated worries here!"" 

Contractor: ""Ah, one people turn zombie."" joking. though would turn actual zombie vaccine would hurt somehow, etc. certainly taking it. 

Me: ""Well guess case 150 million zombies."" looked funny me.

Contractor: ""Well I'll one shooting shotgun.""

Me: ""Well guess I'll know look for.""

Awkward silence seconds moved on. 

This guy business owner, presumably well self (based busy said long would take get work done due demand). works people's houses time. etc. etc. 

This problem have. COVID going anywhere 20% population USA never going take vaccine. boosters even higher percentage take those. 

My view vaccine keeps heathy (at least level risk line flu/cold/etc.) going live life. think should. going stop thinking worrying 20% going take it. virus circulates populations serious illness death happen, point cannot worry it. everyone chance get shot, I'm moving on. Sadly, family members group. 

Sigh. Reminds Austin Powers‚Äô dad hated Dutch reason. üòÑ Variant1617

It spreads rapidly, almost double. cases UK literally doubled now. Worst vaccine status ""unsure"" comes helping fight one. 60 might work country small Israel, one like US lots travel communities threshold could higher. saying it‚Äôs guarantee, possible reason holding 80 places, especially rural South, going bad outbreaks urban areas states general enough vaccination mostly suppress disease. vaccines FDA-approved emergency use authorization talking cases weeks weeks even Europe. decided real tons cases Yes!  way proof vaccination required many things. 

If like find job different field they're endangering at-risk people might sound stupid Herd immunity kicked yet tell half population wear masks, half won't. 

You beat Covid19, ignorance NEVER defeated. me, try save want saved. right willfully murder people. Glad cleared wait mandates start employers. Right we're seeing cruise ships, colleges/universities, stadiums/large venues (like Madison Square Garden).

Business liability insurance employers dictate this, remove option lot people. US India last year. year high levels natural immunity vaccines. decision make 2nd vaccine appt, I‚Äôm little confused much immunity 1st shot
I got 1st dose week ago (Pfizer) going post pone 2nd dose (by week half) due wanting chance feeling like crap right person (outside socially distanced) graduation ceremony birthday party week before. 

So question. studies say level immunity 1st Pfizer dose 3-4 weeks out? Thanks! I‚Äôm wondering risk feeling like shit side effects maybe miss socialization protect more, I‚Äôll relatively protected already 1st dose?

I still getting dose 2, postponing (or strongly considering for)

Thanks input! Okay take every school states (even though big ones going make people get it) let‚Äôs say HALF rest colleges do. That‚Äôs 2000 posts alone will! Thank you, kind stranger :) Meanwhile, Vietnam holding steady 35 total Covid deaths. Adenovirus/viral vector vaccines 'traditional' vaccines, they're still new. probably never viral vector vaccine covid unless vaccinated Ebola part experimental study. Correlation mean causation nuff said. people, know many, mindset ‚Äúother people get vax life go back‚Äù needs loosening rules vaccinated people   Hospitals previously required vaccinations, hospitals I‚Äôve worked specifically required flu vaccines opt out/training order refuse certainly precedent knowing. wish best Alabamians, ranked 49th measures: thank God Mississippi Vaccinations exist adults point. valid right now. losing ability track rates natural infection people test less, unfortunately. they‚Äôre refusing get it, $25 isn‚Äôt going change minds. seen concrete timeline. article read said meet advisory committee may choose so. see anything calendar yet though said approval weeks submitted 2 weeks ago. know many people 25-30 gotten covid intentions getting vaccine You‚Äôd really hope countries EU would listen EMA this. It‚Äôs pretty blatant places high infection rates unlike Denmark/Norway worth it.

Should also really begin prioritise MRNA younger people it‚Äôs seemingly flip side places. better understanding flu infects children Covid does. Inflammatory disorders common post Covid post flu children. Flu spread also seasonal possible children avoid high risk
situations relatively short period time. 

You can‚Äôt go school without proof vaccination, even diseases don‚Äôt really spread anymore like Polio. 

These ‚Äúsweeping social restrictions‚Äù mostly wearing piece cloth face letting bars restaurants crowded. many people think die let people stand crowded bars without piece cloth face? Trust me, person care whether wear mask lol simply true... 

workers work Israel work money ideology. Palestinians want get vaccine Israelies do. Arabs WB actually want simple life hate jews tend think. 

Again, vaccination centre Arabs WB built Area C WB. 
Most workers got vaccination voluntarily ""they know Israel"". even know Hebrew, want survive COVID-19 us do. CDC ‚Äî state governors. It‚Äôs CDC‚Äôs job tell us safest possible course action is. It‚Äôs elected officials‚Äô job decide whether implementing policy worth costs.

Let‚Äôs let politicians hook ‚Äújust following CDC orders‚Äù. buck stop somewhere. mean really care random people street think, point really fuck anti-vaxxers take rather refresh web page hours instead chill car watching Netflix It‚Äôs also worth noting opening well.  positive test rate Delhi hit 36%, exceptionally high.   However, daily confirmed cases doubling every 10 days, expect hit 1,000,000 confirmed cases next week. 

Compared countries, India appears severely [underreporting though. 

Although people taking conspiratorial view, India historically registers 86% deaths, [only 22% registered death given official stressed state hospital systems patients dying line enter hospital ([BBC addition historically bad infrastructure, imagine numbers look much better actually are. 

It's absolute tragedy, absolutely one worst worst situations since pandemic started. getting worse quickly. good him. need push people get vaccinated that's bullshit contact Krispy Kreme Coronavirus opportunistic, entire family one lie hospital brother get enough rest. cannot push body covid. Also covid tests accurate comes confirm presence virus accurate comes confirming virus left body. Illness pass (if make it), sure trace virus laying dormant somewhere body, waiting right moment restart illness? studies confirm reinfections possible studies flat disprove possibility virus staying inactive inside body illness ran course?

I fully vaccinated prior contracting covid, like entire family. Vaccine Sinopharm, China. stop infection made parents chronically ill. CDC following form science. got kidding right? Sadly, true... looking Oklahoma, Texas, universities southern states. (Yeah, Oklahoma University). think higher vaccination rates lead less restrictions idk tell lol That's kind hospital would choose go to.

Hasn't gotten much press, huge Covid infections come hospitals. think right demand anti-vaxxers work me. lot 'armchair immunologists' \*super invested\* ""There never exist effective coronavirus vaccine"" dogma last year, ever since whole slew surprisingly effective COVID vaccines hit market, entire worldview collapsing around hoping 'mutants' finally prove right. call condition 'terminal case Dunning-Kruger' still forced wear mask fully vaccinated

Until vaccinations get point lift mandates, wearing mask make look like one them. Sadly. don‚Äôt wear mask anywhere it‚Äôs required, especially outside, I‚Äôm gonna go random person either, really don‚Äôt care do. think healthcare places much high morale anyway. also super demoralizing healthcare workers deal coworkers refuse get vaccinated Yeah, think people want skip vaccine, live bubble.

The people want get vaccinated probably never cared restrictions, pretty much suggestions one cares low density areas. care them, probably notice rest neighborhood barbecuing every weekend together.

For them, getting infected 2 week almost-enforced curfew, ""grandma die **because** Covid, died **with** Covid"". vaccine means extra effort getting risk side effects 3 days, objectively worse usual barbecue. VIP culture? everything collapses name dropping VIP culture fails. Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* numerous reasons? Really curious people saying, except fact ""it's new.""

Anti-vaxers heavy skeptics litany excuses get it. mRNA one concern, fact none current vaccines actually fully approved (emergency auth), cannot sue makers side effects, etc. heavy mental gymnastics get shot varied, cannot encapsulate all.

mRNA ""new"" help adoption, even hundreds millions shots delivered, tiny fraction heavy side effects. Oh God poor thing oppressed get something could possibly save life others around oh God okay? Mega sites nothing internet savvy. Earlier demand far outpaced supply, much efficient states send big incoming bunches doses handful mass vax sites specialized storage equipment instead thousands individual pharmacies. situation flipped...there‚Äôs enough supply make practical distribute bunch little shipments local pharmacies dr‚Äôs offices.
If anything, local pharmacy, grocery store pharmacy even mobile vaccine RVs ideal not-so-internet savvy, mass vax sites. emerging variants. 900k worldwide cases I‚Äôm concerned odds variant developing could escape vaccines. longer takes, likely variants. variants scary part. becoming endemic real issue Sure, [here article January 11, 2020 Flying carries risk DVT around 1 1000, maybe get vaccine get flight. justify spending public money Knesset.

It really hard, though. First off, extremely easy PR win Israel globally. used push Israel's image worldwide, saying care looking neighbors. pushes goodwill Palestinians, ESPECIALLY West Bank Palestinians, could disenfranchise Hamas. Finally, better protects Israelis prevent variants get around vaccines, protects settlers soldiers alike.

I think would tough convince everyone Blue White Supports Labor supporters Joint List. Sure, convince hardcore nationalists support Likud Yesh Atid like, good ever goes Muslim will.

Also, current Bibi government. currently emergency shared power situation. Bibi's corruption trial might change even further. Appreciate consideration. Thanks vaccine 99.99999999999% survival rate chances still better vaccine Actually kidding California beat MD believe you. I'm fan Greg Abbott politicization ""masks = muh freedom"". live red, semi-rural area (between New Braunfels Canyon Lake) masks HEB gone 95% maybe 85-90%. overwhelming majority still wear them.

Home Depot hand.. You‚Äôre forced wear mask government, random people. That‚Äôs choice CDC others made. Even countries large amount cooperation people, governments haven‚Äôt given people back much yet. makes think even cooperation CDC others would recommend vaccinated people wear masks? don‚Äôt think amount compliance would actually shift policy personally.  Imagine that, countries money influence get vaccines right away. 0.2% populations poor countries vaccinated. 

And we‚Äôre still trying lockdown IP issues. pay prize. point general public going travel far vaccine twice potentially sick 2 days. want vaccines moved local clinics across street. next step give \~case vaccines every local clinic. Ya get angry bb forst wirst think want continue restrictions much longer sake children, need show real data indicates children risk. fair great many US headlines involve shots different kinds. Typically American get guns involved whenever possible.  Herd immunity happen regardless many people get vaccine. unvaccinated eventually get covid become immune die. There's way avoid it. incentive they're vaccinated deadly disease. difference someone coming Israel Palestine knows Israel. work there, see eyes everyone getting vaccine (Israeli Jews Arabs alike), etc. They‚Äôre also much likely moderate (I mean wouldn‚Äôt work Israel they‚Äôre extremely anti Israel). 

If put vaccination centres WB you‚Äôd Palestinians aren‚Äôt liberal, they‚Äôd rather get sick anything Israel. vaccine uptake would abysmal. 

There would also undoubtedly much anti-vaxx rhetoric Israel tempering vaccines example. wouldn‚Äôt argument Palestinians get vaccinated Israel since see process everyone, literally walk vaccination centre. Uhm, one suggesting that. wait science, geeze. Exactly, thats shared you. Correct information imp, problem r still getting manipulated &amp; fake info public domain media &amp; politicians  headline simply referring ""One dose Oxford"" sounds ridiculous. Man, able get vaccine adult must fucking lit.   logarithmic scale terms light reflection. So, higher SPF bullshit. need protection, wear shirt hat brim. Freakin' tourists.

Still wishing export ban lift though. Places like India, Italy, hell, practically country doesnt deserve level heartbreak tragedy.  mortality currently around 20-25% known cases far. quite easy compare two.

Also 29 low infection rates risk covid literally 0 (well probably close exactly zero). good, makes great job visually showing relative risks involved. 

For clicked through: series charts comparing estimated risk VITT (dangerous blood clots low platelets) AZ vaccine estimated number serious Covid cases prevented taking AZ vaccine 4 months. comparison made different age groups, high/medium/low Covid infection rate community, estimated Covid hospitalizations/ICU admissions/deaths. 

Since cases VITT serious obviously result death, think relevant comparison ICU admissions. case, seems country high incidence AZ still given age groups, low incidence restricted old.

Another point note estimate period 4 months. Depending if/when vaccines available country, guess would need adjust time frame. FDA gives full authorization, we'll see liability insurance kicks in. price hikes requiring may make change decision.

Just sad scenes outside hospitals - Indian govt really farked up.

You let pedophile work day care. let anti-vaxxers work frail elderly patients pandemic. Enough died already failure protect.

So worry workers morale. I'll give precedence killing people. Great job, Germany! :) Haha, exactly. entire time pandemic answer question ""what happen [x]?"" ""the dumbest, partisan-polarized thing think of.""

This states (or still have) outdoor mask mandates states mask-free 100% capacity indoor dining. Yes close almost every damn school country months flu. schools stayed open, think would lot 297 deaths.

The new variants appear start affecting younger patients severely too. [This reports 70 hospitalized children current US hotspot Michigan, including five PICU one hospital.

I worry could less severe version what's happening India right now. Adults thinking pandemic vaccinated stopping masking distancing, translates kids same, packing schools autumn leading colder winter months, we'll another wave going schools winter hitting kids hard. Haha yeah let groceries delivered. meetings Zoom. It‚Äôs indeed bit culture shock speaking live people (face face) I'm still concerned variants. ones know vaccines effective against, course, new variants yet mutate existence.

Okay, would expect case 6-60 feet, 1 6 ft. seem glossed whole point  90% world envious Canadian vaccination campaign look way. Totally, trying imply situation bad. unequivocally awful there. 

My push back implication vaccines likelihood ineffective new variant. 

In coming weeks we're going see several articles *""unknown whether variant able escape vaccine immune response,""* intention readers think *will* evade immune response, prompting click article. 

My suggestion everyone remember variants, predatory messaging is. underestimate many people plain lazy. Making appointment waiting lines something people want do, especially younger. hardly incentive young people vaccine. 

This absolutely true. friends afraid get vaxxed anything. want deal it. They're essential workers never stopped going work largely never stopped going bars/restaurants. absolutely zero incentive deal wonky Walgreens site afraid doorknob licking days over. Thanks science!

Why give shit lol? wanna risk death that's montra, job protect stupid stupid.

And amount people can't get vaccinated small minority easier tell quarantine instead rest us cater them.

And no, protect everyone, hate break you, society always always death, weigh risk accordingly. covid becomes minor cause death instead currently large one is, gonna time go back normal, even people still die. Hmm maybe. I‚Äôm smoker chain smoker smoke 1 2 cigarettes day go store. Strange thing mom infected covid 6 months back. stayed mom room since frightened alone, never got infected. brother tested positive 3 days back. roaming together 2 days yet get infected. Idk it‚Äôs smoking antibodies tho wanted comment say hope accepted another top choice school everything works you! Second shot acquired! need wait next week two...

Quick question argument hear pop up:
Are variants less likely happen unvaccinated vaccinated individual? 

I hear people argue vaccination say variants created without vaccination. Also, heard podcast pressure (on virus) vaccinated individuals cause mutations... 

Does anyone sources read this? google anything variants get vaccine effectiveness them.

Thank you! keep expecting common sense measure applied places, just... isn't.

Mass vaccination sites meant get many people vaccinated quickly. downside people travel (sometimes far) get twice. low hanging fruit.

Many people hesitant get vaccine still easy communication getting vaccine (cost logistics) subpar. Lots vaccines, green pass (aka vaccine passport) encourage everyone take them. gets people GOING! ""*Shenanigans? tobacco industry?*""

**It's likely think.** Everyone jabbed today gets August date 2nd dose. It‚Äôs ‚Äúup to‚Äù anything. It‚Äôs 4 months, period.

Welcome covid America, always risk getting sick somebody thinks vaccines contain aborted fetuses (a real conspiracy theory I've hearing). worst I've ever gotten flu shot sore arm.

The mRNA vaccines inject pieces live virus - shot instructions make spike protein, cells grab make (because messenger told to) immune system sees spikes goes, ""Well supposed here.""

The reaction, especially second shot, entirely immune system getting arms. mRNA spike proteins destroyed, calms down. us that's 24-36 hours.

I think adenovirus vectors may potentially longer reaction people since virus vector penetrate cells, immune system even red alert longer period time. Great news!

Some napkin math Germany: 

93 women (including risk preexisting conditions) younger 40 years old[ died Covid  
606925 [confirmed cases among &lt; 35 (so even ignoring mild cases went unnoticed)

The age ranges unfortunately match up, even using conservative bounds (death group women&lt;40, infections group women &lt;35) risk death confirmed infection 

93/606925 = .00015

Combine risk getting infected first place quickly getting place individual risk calculation speaks vaccine. that's conservative estimates given data. heads up, paper Pfizer shot. someone say IRL curry &amp; spicy food good immune system that's India relatively well regard Covid cases.

...I really equipped respond said ""yeah mate maybe eat curries"". assumes 100% population would get COVID without vaccine. 5% low number. anybody know good, succinct, somewhat easily digestible resource summarizes percentage people (nationally globally) who...

-have COVID-19

-have COVID-19 symptoms lasting ""long"" period time (arbitrary, head means longer 1 2 months)

-have gotten vaccine COVID-19

-have side effects vaccine lasted ""long"" period time (again, arbitrary, since people seem get side effects less week--usually less 2 days--in head means side effects lasting longer week two)

-have ""severe"" side effects vaccine (in head, severe means seizures, blood clots, symptoms rise ""fatigue, sore arm, fever"" people seem experience)

Here's ask:

I already fully vaccinated, somebody important life hesitant getting stuck head can't possibly know long term side effects can/will seen COVID-19 vaccines. case, somebody knows personally (a 21 year old male) experienced seizures 1 day getting J&amp;J vaccine (the seizures attributed vaccine), like looking numbers page hesitates side effects vaccine.

But, thing is, already know COVID-19 persist prolonged period time patients. people experience COVID-19 symptoms *months*--so called ""COVID long haulers"". Yet living life past year would call ""selective"" quarantine (she mostly stays home 6 days week, seems one two social events month goes involve people multiple households regions), really one close call COVID-19 exposure. So, her, living pandemic year, still even caught COVID-19--let alone worry potential long term impacts her. dodged long, continue living like living? introduce variable that, would almost certainly reduce impact COVID-19 still caught it, can't guarantee get also studied long enough know introduce long term issues.

But think risk avoidance backwards here. worried long term side effects, getting vaccine still, me, clearly best path forward. *To knowledge* nobody long term side effects vaccine (setting aside couple recently well publicized J&amp;J clotting issues, even know long term), yet also knowledge, people long term COVID-19 symptoms. I'm looking better numbers back notion far likely get COVID-19 long term symptoms get vaccine severe side effects--let alone long lasting side effects it. There's old adage circular logic makes dizzy. Dude, kid gets vaccine, terrorists win.

*Because everyone wins* also factor reduced transmission getting jab? There's much worse things dying, long covid passing mum dying refused AZ jab. longer take vaccinate, puts us worse positions regarding breakdown heathcare 

I'm happy AZ vaccine, feel much less stressed out.

It's either stay anxious/stressed. take it, 0.0001% chance dying. Obvious choice, plus people vaccinated less strain health services. risk pretty low, I'm sure much riskier things day day basis.

I see things higher chance killing would otherwise. see get spread around, people die actions would feel? spinning here. don‚Äôt care recalled. come on. reporting factual numbers. saying news/media making fake numbers up? got mine yesterday!

US Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC) originally recommended test-based strategy discontinuing isolation, requiring 2 consecutive negative reverse-transcription‚Äìpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests least 24 hours apart. However, experience COVID-19 accumulated, learned small number individuals continue shed virus long infection. Given appeared virus persistently positive individuals replication competent minimal risk transmission sufficient time passed symptom onset, CDC shifted symptom-based strategy July 2020, advising isolation precautions discontinued 10 days symptom onset patient‚Äôs first positive RT-PCR result, unless patient immunocompromised severe disease.  issue *JAMA Internal Medicine*, Mack et al examine National Basketball Association (NBA) 2020 closed-campus (‚Äúbubble‚Äù) season assess whether persistently positive individuals transmit virus. **Among 3648 individuals undergoing RT-PCR testing NBA bubble, 36 persistently positive cases (34 men \[94%\]). persistently positive cases produced 1480 person-days close-contact activities transmission events detected.**  many ways, NBA bubble season, fixed population players supportive personnel participated daily testing many exposed regularly high-risk indoor, unmasked, close-contact activities, ideal experiment test transmissibility persistently positive individuals. However, group predominantly young, healthy individuals, none persistently positive individuals study required hospitalization. such, results generalized immunocompromised severe COVID-19 infections. Moreover, person-days maskless, close contact happened minimum 2 weeks initial infection given NBA‚Äôs cardiac screening protocol, many initial infections happened longer 3 weeks arrival bubble. such, study unable provide insight ideal timing discontinuation precautions general public. limitations notwithstanding, real-world experiment one unlikely repeated provides convincing evidence symptom-based strategy discontinuation precautions right approach.

Not necessarily. difference may statistically significant flu, since number possible deaths much smaller covid. mean, sort get it. best option probably always going use brand new, sterile, n95 every chance can. I've become little profligate masks since got past new year surge, got vaccinated.

I'm lawyer law student I'm trying speak place experience but, far understand it, main issue that, even everything gone unrealistically perfectly AZ plant production issues whatsoever, AZ still able meet even remotely close delivery targets, still would scale deliveries 50-75%, completely unacceptable considering life saving medicines we're talking here. Meaning never world AZ would able deliver even ballpark numbers sold vaccines on. That's ""best reasonable effort"", that's fraud. 

The issue apparent lack professionalism AZ, that's elitism speaking. AZ consistently (heavily) revised delivery estimates week even mere days supposed deliver vaccines. comes something like national vaccine rollout involves hundreds thousands medical personnel, doctors, facilities tremendous organizational effort own, that's also completely unacceptable, wastes precious time money actually costs lives. 3 million.

CDC even said people vaccinated get together wear masks.  Many countries won‚Äôt begin vaccinate 2024 current supply predictions. We‚Äôre looking less 0.2% poor countries. better solution: go this, other, ""holistic health shop"" ever. sounds like even okay risking lives still enjoy freedom.

Not quite. deaths clearly able prevent, immoral to. Yes, draw line somewhere, number deaths blends statistical noise. probably (hopefully) June. definitely right think lot things taken consideration making decision open?

No, political decision I'm glad finally nice out. turned backyard socially distanced speakeasy friends neighbors. I'm looking forward open next fall. school district remote late March, hybrid currently, offer remote option entire next school year. need look closely, I'm leaning towards taking remote option.

My son young, I'm worried content instruction, past year surprisingly comprehensive. may well actually learn ahead school peers offer large component self directed learning math language arts pretty good doing, keep forging ahead own.   Yea, India Brazil swimmingly. 

Some countries going starting vaccinations 2024. It‚Äôs like folks don‚Äôt want it. governments line 100+ countries lifting IP laws countries aggressively immunize citizens. vaccine almost certainly makes impossible transmit Covid. They're designed teach body attack Covid kill it.... teach body Covid live harmony lol. 

There's clinical proof YET vaccine prevents transmission, come eventually. Researchers saying know transmissibility post-vaccine mean transmissibility exists. .... elastomerics filter air going yet? already problem them. doctors wearing hospital there's risk even COVID concern COVID partition hospital medical staff could introduce secondary infections patients. Either way feel like misses point end day AZ still managed provide EU second largest amount vaccine company far, think point understated.

I mean, EU supposed grateful getting 30% life saving product paid something? Another way look EU get 70% vaccines promised, would enough vaccinate 35 million additional people save thousands lives. Another problem argument is: low go? low AZ deliver EU allowed stop grateful? 20 million? 10 million? 5 million?  comment ridiculous? one suggesting there's motivation government keep masks place.

So - think motivation is. would LOT easier J&amp;J. need get back use ASAP get lot creative vaccine outreach That's quite normal viruses. Viruses often share features, protection one (say common cold) lead partial even full protection certain level exposure Covid. hypothesised reason children suffered way would expect. cross border walk in? literally pointing regardless covid, fresh air drawn space. could give fuck less relevance covid spread. drew 95% fresh air time, still gonna exposed. saying restaurants indeed draw fresh air spaces.  Well yeah correct incredibly misleading. 

2 500k 3 100 millions massive difference like researchers know much bigger dataset existed.

Also nowadays journalists jump news create drama imagine good idea say ""omg mRNA vaccines also bad AZ"" bigger dataset European data shows false. not. HIPPA people think is.  wish mandates would update science comes out, unwillingness leaders flexible infuriating. know 100% 25% open. example, mask wearing outside mandated anywhere, maybe discouraged. government showed public proactive, reared us locking us year public moral would much higher. Part there‚Äôs much paperwork vaccines get wasted open batch get used. work grocery store pharmacist told schedule sure use. case schedule 10 vaccines day, batch gets opened time, don‚Äôt want risk opening another batch even one get wasted. perspective it‚Äôs better keep 10 vaccines ice still good use 9 allow 1 get wasted. Obviously public health isn‚Äôt good, reality overworked even Covid can‚Äôt dedicate time paperwork bureaucracy. 

So ultimately think (in admittedly amateur uneducated opinion) really needs happen excessive paperwork wasted dosages needs eliminated vaccine administrators feel free give shots whoever ask long got supply. Complaint/symptom, fine. they're diagnoses.  amount ppe world going overwhelming think about. Sooo much extra trash. Sigh may surprising shortages nurses etc may simply work. 

Don't get started nursing homes. many people say ""just fire period get vaccine."" simple unless want shut due insufficient minimum staffing levels... pay lot more. better option problems may ~10-20% people ‚Äúdead set‚Äù it, I‚Äôd say there‚Äôs like 30% relatively apathetic.

They may relatively young, don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre particularly risk, may hesitation vaccine don‚Äôt see super necessary.

Those people need reach incentives get it, like discounts sporting events, free ‚Äúshots‚Äù bars get shot, making requirement university, etc. 

The last 10%-20% likely won‚Äôt convinced anything. last priority. full approval usually take 6 months application FDA would drop everything else work Pfizer approval? wasn‚Äôt. Again, shitty joke. truly shame Ohio one best children‚Äôs hospitals country (hence, trial happening here) conservative, antivax population. Facebook comments types news stories make think one kid inoculated.

Besides, get ultimate VR upgrade vaccine? beats VR headset market.  quickly reaching point vaccines people willing take them. J&amp;J effective MRNA vaccines, think would make sense giving Pfizer Moderna. 

People going get J&amp;J catch mild non-symtomatic COVID spread around unvaccinated we‚Äôre never going get mess. exact line logic thinking too, keep wondering I‚Äôm missing something simplification. Hopefully not.  ü§î

Probably women... thought normal given someone else‚Äôs medical information?

No? might thinking HIPAA privacy laws, affect whether health-care providers share info without consent. definitely apply *you* giving info anyone asks. also apply employees give consent boss share info.  thought got vaccinated could ""get"" covid suffer mild symptoms 95% time 5% time suffer severe symptons. mrna vaxxes anyways Yes vaccines work Thanks info! People die disease time. think makes sense put year round mask mandates save lives?

What disease? last time global pandemic killed almost 600,000 Americans year?

If thinking flu, kills far fewer people, mainly span like three months. think *should* explore mask recommendations, even requirements, public places (peak) flu season. Also low-hanging fruit like Plexiglas barriers. absolutely nothing would warrant year-round mask mandate, making strawman. viral vector vaccines like J&amp;J target spike protein too? I'm pretty much back normal. Traveled spend weekend mom first time year, ate without worry restaurants varying mask levels, (vaccinated) friends over, etc.

Once office opens back start concerts/festivals again, difference times occasional wearing mask indoor public spaces, minor inconvenience worst. Yeah, find irresponsible. Avoiding indoor gatherings marked effect infection rates live. currently highest number cases ever, it‚Äôs indoor restrictions strict enough.

It's weird thing randomly say know effective... well... that's easy way filter idiots would bring average scores down... think able hit 50% Memorial Day? weeks ago 50% 5/2 way back 5/15. disagree neutral.

I, too, enjoy beating old people Happy cake day! Yes, India definitely facing difficult situation hospital system failure. Even I, person normally opposes lockdowns, thinks lockdown might necessary.

But think media people subreddit hyping drama this. acknowledge difficult India without talking ‚Äúannihilation‚Äù Indian people. countries faced severely strained hospital systems due disease, too. unprecedented, despite what‚Äôs reported. *Amy Coney Barrett enters chat* Whenever new variant discovered, vaccine status unknown. trend vaccine works.

It‚Äôs frustrating whenever new variant comes out, media news implies vaccines don‚Äôt work it, simply study done. Yet vaccines proven effective new variant study performed. 

We reason think vaccines won‚Äôt work variant. Except theres metrics besides vaccination. Theres hospitalizations spread. right page too..


People idiots can't understand faster vaccinate faster things go normal. FWIW work large state university system we've told prepare fall schedule based 2019, 2020, classrooms back full capacity everything person. means distancing least default (no idea masks) classrooms large enough accommodate full capacity *and* distancing.   Pfizer Moderna vaccines likely get full FDA approval point summer. There‚Äôs literally nothing changed would cause approved. Since given EUA December, we‚Äôve collected vast amount data showing they‚Äôre extremely safe effective. New England, general, great vaccination uptake rate. town smashing across board likely hit local herd immunity levels middle/end May even including sub 16 crowd. Nope. Heard straight doctor see. Basically low level certainty. happen know confidence interval 2 dose clinical trials ballpark? idea would see full authorization?

So like said, currently reopening motivation people get vaccinated, manifesting already. One big local headlines County (outside Chicago) can't get young people vaccinations filling 10% appointments. city, demand highest, allowing walk-ins everywhere demand plummeting. 

The vaccines work, public health messaging political leadership going tank success.  entirely many people, 13 million people won‚Äôt die vaccines now, even India behind rollout. 

My point society would collapse Indian people (1.3 billion strong) would ‚Äúannihilated‚Äù even faced absolute worst COVID offer. acknowledge tragedy without histrionics. india breeding grounds mutants emerge?

I've lucky enough lock since first shot. wife go work, lot office still remote, skeleton crew. got 2nd shots last week, I've used instacart grocery shopping last month.

Time tell central govt serious enough. 37 year old male Finland, underlying conditions medication, received first shot Moderna today. received SMS week ago healthcare official region live in. called inform must received mistake, since high risk group, told come get shot today. reason think I'm queue surgery. 

No side effect far, except came home, took nap something dont usually so. Shot given 10 hours ago. Second shot given 12 weeks.

I'm kinda excited this, especially since aged parents also got first shots couple weeks ago. sure though wait second shots meeting indoors again. today, double dose Moderna me! Vaccines required, along masks social distancing. horrifying watch. grateful chance get vaccinated people. Canada embarrassing.

Why Ontario turmoil US seems chillin?

No? Lol think means in-person schools starting next fall? sure hiding, maybe peacocks spending time sucking mangoes. original phase 3 trial results suggest close zero. vaccine group started diverge placebo group 10 days, effect seen 14 days. point I'm tired repeat argument again.

Not saying vaccine completely ineffective. terribly effective. Lockdown fear full hospitals probably kept crowd inside. 


So question you, hospitalizations highest they've despite 42% population vaccine 31% fully vaccinated. vaccines funneled outside older population? Ohio 39% least one dose, according Google. They‚Äôll sure hit 50% end May, probably get 60% end June, everything open pre-pandemic normal fourth July Yep. I'm seeking medical advice (that would silly).

I'm trying connect w/ people who've similar experiences... know... internet stuff. pick work idea is? Without paid time lot people good know need stay home common cold. wife tested positive likelihood getting sick right youve sleeping bed covid different someone got grocery store.

You cant see difference situations? USA, sure it. would serious breach New York swimming vaccines. It‚Äôs locked city one wants go day bound come sooner later, still political leaders accept done..God save people now. like devil Recommend use persons

4 million+ males got shot none severe side effects, would decide allowing shot males age? dumb decision around regarding issue.  US manufacturer, however, counted level production currently seen result defense production act amp up, place since January typical US production products materials.

In short, production needs expanded elsewhere, well. many countries feel need invest part vaccine making process. Sounds like right track. fine. really big deal. ask doctor why.

So answer question; plateau, peaked currently going down.  Actually, exact point original comment- challenging husband go unmasked public kids, kids still wearing they're vaccinated.

Nobody's making wait anything pediatric vax (also, waiting issues mentioned either- literally still original vaccination timeline).

Such boneheaded decision Indian government let happen. Respectfully, incorrect. culprit *is* ‚Äúfree DNA‚Äù, doesn‚Äôt mean old DNA fragment cause rare complication. specifically DNA closely mimics PF4.

""Although found enhanced reactivity patient serum platelets presence ChAdOx1 nCov-19, likely vitro artifact. **It well known adenovirus binds platelets causes platelet activation.**""

""However, interactions vaccine platelets vaccine PF4 could play role pathogenesis. One possible trigger PF4-reactive antibodies could free DNA vaccine. previously shown DNA RNA form multimolecular complexes PF4, bind antibodies patients heparin-induced thrombocytopenia also induce antibodies PF4‚Äìheparin murine model."" means active part vaccine unlikely culprit, ‚Äúfree DNA‚Äù refers basically scraps inactive adenovirus DNA fragments solution bypassed filtering process. DNA fragments mimic PF4.

This complication, called ‚Äúautoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia‚Äù caused antibodies recognize multimolecular complexes closely resemble platelet factor 4 (PF4), usually drug Heparin. PF4 complexes come viruses well, adenovirus well-known culprit. [Adenovirus-induced almost certainly case adenovirus fDNA culprit given ‚Äúantibodies SARS-CoV-2 spike protein cross-react PF4 PF4/heparin complexes molecular mimicry.‚Äù German scientists claim ‚ÄúChAdOx1 nCov-19‚Äù unlikely cause - levels platelet activation spike protein alone elicited levels low enough considered inconsequential reactivity, words, ""in vitro artifact"". hypothesize something else vaccine cause, point adenovirus fDNA likely culprit. 

Since DNA Inovio vaccine replica spike protein, already know antibodies spike protein react PF4, zero indication rare complication would caused Inovio nanoparticle DNA. ‚Äúfree DNA‚Äù made equal - would mimic PF4 cause issue.

I've read, vaccines give protection variants that's relief. may need booster like said soon tell. may maybe risk need it. Day zero, day 14 day two weeks later consider fully vaxxed Children young adults nowhere near risk 65+. deaths (550K ish) ~75% elderly people comorbidities, according CDC numbers. Ages 0-29 like 0.5%.  That's cute. long, they're going start lining kids up.. 

so go schools... 

for toddlers, pediatricians eventually start adding COVID list vaxes.. know one knows sure, i‚Äôm looking thoughts, college requiring vaccines year. talking mom said think that‚Äôs good that‚Äôs case better restrictions since everyone totally vaccinated. said thinks we‚Äôll still wear masks. anyone thoughts? really don‚Äôt want wear masks 24/7 classroom, i‚Äôm tired type beer? Remember, HIPAA means healthcare provider can't give information out.  mean can't.

This would require employee give information themselves, healthcare provider. Or, least, employee authorize disclosure information.   that‚Äôs carrot stick, federal state government whole like reach ‚Äúx‚Äù % vaccinated lift restrictions, instead it‚Äôs arbitrary phrase ‚Äúonce infection rates lower‚Äù definitive value. would first case hear lol specificity fixed test characteristic change changing disease prevalence (the PPV does). So, yes, prevalence goes down, fixed specificity ""balance out"" lack prevalence. 

Take extreme examples, population everyone covid, positives true positives. Alternatively, population one covid, positives false positives. go one extreme other, proportion positives false go up. living toward version positives true (in setting pandemic) getting least closer end get people vaccinated get closer heard immunity, getting (still small fraction, more) false positives.

there ways get false positive besides contamination. using short probes, non-specific targets, many amplification cycles cause false positive PCR detecting something else (can viruses). UNC system opted learn covid bungling last year require vaccine. Big mistake. There‚Äôs mass psychosis going India, Hinduism become extremist longer dharmic. Bakhts don‚Äôt see Modi now, frankly, doubt ever will. I'm waiting hear side story.

IIRC, India banned exports Covid vaccine theraputic drugs countries. reasons, doubt. still seems bit ironic they're complainers here. Yes!!! 

Also T-Cells, B-Cells parts incredible immune system amazing vaccines activate provide another layer protection virus variants. asymptomatic carriers... means virus showing it. ""asymptomatic"" means.

So ""false positive"", positive caught otherwise thus spread disease further. words... saying ""Good job catching asymptomatic kids! Thanks stopping spread!"" realise difference timescale data gathered much data gathered stringent criteria are? traditional vaccines. adenovirus based ones. Maybe occupied areas proper Palestinian controlled areas no. According Oslo Accords, Palestinian Authority responsible healthcare Palestinians. think Israel give vaccines don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs responsibility. Gotcha. can't get information themselves, require give yourself. That's sort distinction looking for, thanks! represent Mississippi mock Congress High School flabbergasted terrible true. numbers, least around here, 60% returning second shot.

Also, spacing 3 weeks 2. apologies, didn‚Äôt mean hurtful way. thought funny misreading part.  I've read anywhere 60-80% first dose, really depends risk tolerance. Delaying end world, really ""right"" answer ""No way reduce vaccine hesitancy,"" says scientists regularly tell can't anything vaccinated. tell experience shopping last couple weeks. count them, approximately half saw.

I believe you. Curevac possibility. Hippaa would keep accessing chart without permission. Theoretically could vaccinated get fired refusing give proof, hippaa would cover that. liked sound joints jabs thing NYC chain mRNA actually simpler, mRNA spike protein cells
Other vaccines longer chain,

Then mRNA spike protein

So mRNA appears simple enough less could go wrong. Wish also get flu vaccine way sooner better looks like wait years combo mRNA vaccine.

The US what, roughly 40% first jabs now? EU countries mid 20s%. 77M extra doses, that's 17% EU population, much consider population 16 years. yes, would much US realized mistake, went correct it.

Again, seem understand private companies. Pfizer could simply said no, would end that. is, given Sanofi working vaccine, astonishing worked deal early Putting order January super late!

WTF talking about? order? Sanofi thing nothing orders. ordered much would ever need already last EU also screwed immensely striking deals like late; contingency planning.

The EU ordered hundreds millions doses, way needed, mid last year, every major viable manufacturer. like every country. countries significantly ahead either tiny, comparison, and/or banning exports (US UK), and/or happy use probably inferior Sputnik Sinovac. Canada vaccinating light speed moment. Increased Pfizer deliveries help immensely. Yeah definitely preference due that, too, prior droping ball even pause. seems like J&amp;J indeed gamechanger way many us hoped. give pleasure make lies perpetuate climate fear depression? fact see irony comment hilarious lol. actually 'motion confidence' leads vote house. think vote confidence confidence, confidence vote used interchangeably discussing it. might wrong. Good. remove export stop new notations come around resistant. Good. Fauci saying J&amp;J probably going reapproved today. specific committee meeting scheduled? expecting news? paywall me; says must vaccinated June 7th. think least Pfizer could get full FDA approval then. Whoever writes articles really needs start differentiating vaccine hesitancy vaccine apathy. There's big difference ""Do put body"" ""I wanna go hassle.""

We're probably going past point people willing work vaccine within weeks. amazing got adults reaching point. burden government make vaccine truly effortless get. Go people are. employees every CVS, Walmart, Walgreens, whatever else country asking every single person see they'd like vaccinated. Hell put shopping malls sporting events, not? Wherever massive influxes people capacity store vaccines, pop vaccination locations.

Journalists greatly exaggerate subset country want vaccinated. statistics issue legitimize panic. cannot emphasize enough much think we'll easily able reach herd immunity without forcing anyone get vaccinated. people would outright refuse vaccine really matter. feel serious issue subset population whose interest vaccination extends ""Yeah sure, not?"" nothing further. That's needs addressed, successfully vaccinate apathetic even need think hesitant. take-home message vaccines going work New York variant South African variant U.K. variant,‚Äù said Nathan Landau, virologist N.Y.U.‚Äôs Grossman School Medicine led study.

I think soon know variant originating India Well virus won‚Äôt either, definition. try redefine definitions like change meaning ‚Äúis‚Äù like like post-truth dystopia. mean, duh. Unless venting air pulling fresh air in, breathing indoors means slowly mixing whatever germs entire space. Without properly fitted N95 style mask, gonna breath little every germ place while. extremes continue override common sense?

No way! /s pick different career. Healthcare isn‚Äôt Give patents allow less developed countries make vaccines scumbags know get doses, highly immune while. know get one dose, short term quite immune. know long term, watched people who've gotten one dose get second.

So, maybe it'll turn one dose still gives long-lasting immunity, maybe not. know. take risk?

Be safe side (and get bit immunity top); get second dose. right We'll need clear policy reopen things young people like (concerts, movie theaters, etc) get certain percent vaccinated. link says got form clinical trials.

Which problem. Pfizer trial, example, sample size infections 1 dose 10 people (9 placebo 1 vaccinated).

With small sample size, unlucky case two swing efficacy rate huge amount. ludicrous make decisions based that. US we've given 220 mil vaccines least 1 dose 90mil fully vaccinated still going, India half 20mil fully vaccinated got 4x population 1/3 land area going spread far quicker mention India still developing country probably less infrastructure That's exactly employer did! brought vaccination site 2 doses Pfizer vaccine gave everyone got fully vaccinated $100. wish employers would something like this! great way incentivize people get vaccine! learned school, called vote *no* confidence, also taught motion brought affirmative votes indicated. many tests per day. point positivity rate go number positive tests plateau, difficult tell time whether wave truly peaked limited testing. Lmao everyone vaccinated, think absolutely reasonable students expect normal campus experience get 70% partially vaccinated, get 70% fully vaccinated bet masking/distancing fade away rather cut date, state makes rules ultimately thing governing rules local cities/towns actually enforcing them. live state mask mandate lifted august 6th everywhere except schools government buildings, local businesses required them. county example followed state's lifting april 6th, small businesses required mask longer. mandates big box stores, percentage people wearing mask.

anecdotally experience going grocery store home improvement stores, less half people see store wearing mask, means half masking, sort surprised me. sure long last. stores signs doors saying mask distance, single employee saw enforcing rule.

my theory increase get vaccinated inch closer summer time. running bet friends family memorial day see people wearing masks public people wearing masks public.

bars restaurants around requiring masks servers/bartenders wearing masks essentially means county far tell. wife vaccinated fear children, get vaccine eating outside getting take out, easy summer.  Despite lack commercial air travel time, 1918 flu eventually made even remote villages Alaska. (In weird twist fate, [best viral we've got flu came bodies dead buried permafrost.)

So I'm guessing spread would slower, would still made across whole world. rail steampship travel, regular movement people continents (particularly Europe colonies). think Biden administration encourage masking public spaces majority residents county state vaccinated. think it'll forefront covid mitigation efforts. Right trying convince public get shot. That's main goal, going take concerted effort constant barrage messaging reach fraction 35 40% that's anti-vax. People get sick easily planes. feel masks required planes rest lives hopefully not. would also like peer reviewed source backs claim

I love anti-vaxxer logic.

""There population high spread infection covid death, population started getting vaccinated high rate rates covid infection death declined. must something vaccine vaccines stop spread covid. lying eyes must peer reviewed.""

&amp;#x200B;

Also, think read paper keep summary, based route whereby SARS-CoV-2 infection acquired independence mucosal systemic responses, must mucosal immune dimension COVID-19. Whether makes significant contribution outcome SARS-CoV-2 infection, exploited good effect diagnostic purposes therapy prophylaxis, determined carrying appropriate investigations. [**Table lists potentially important studies undertaken elucidate mucosal immune responses SARS-CoV-2 infection.

They saying catch covid vaccine triggers immune response covid perfect match, continue investigate this.My response ""No, shit, sherlock"" FDA has, even pandemic, restrictions place one facility produce one type vaccine. pushing stop producing AZ J&amp;J site necessarily due AZ issues rather sticking prior mandates. fact one vaccines approved also plays things.

There articles rumors AZ doses discarded, J&amp;J doses entirely plausible mixup ingredient AZ used J&amp;J doses. would mean AZ doses made fine, hence passing quality inspections fine. anything know know week ago? Yeah definitely one thing, seasonality definitely factor. things reopened July, stayed low long time like November something spiked again. think seasonality along lockdown helped first wave.

In India's case, may reopening outweighed seasonality. honestly, one knows. Florida never shut super well. Tbf that‚Äôs asymptomatic infections. found 90% reduction symptomatic cases almost 100% reduction Severe cases. shouldn‚Äôt anxious. Basically get likely won‚Äôt even know. actually stops getting virus? thought prevented getting bad symptoms? true make get vaccine. MHRA change tack soon calling vaccine rollout meet criteria mid summer, according Dr. Tam. Yep. got texts/notifications lot clinics around walk appointments.

An example would Costco $5 rotisserie chicken, front page great deal ad, perhaps $10 gift card would appropriate vaccinated customer.

Stores pharmacies could even offer vaccine shopping trip, turn around say gave X amount vaccines helped community, try encourage worried store safe fellow customers likely vaccinated.

TL:DR: Stores try spin way get customers door Yeah healthcare workers absolutely required know someone got COVID March. August crashed motorcycle 150mph died. never know COVID going get you. Good call. We're going need come winter. people can't take multiple days work can't plan lives around somewhere two weeks later J&amp;J vaccine could huge. already data shutdown J&amp;J vaccine large use minority communities expect continue shutdown ends. much easier targeted vaccine campaigns difficult reach areas worry going back doc talking grandchild grandparents health?

For individual, confident keep safely well isolated time takes access mRNA vaccine, guess focusing low incidence graphs. job forces contact lots people daily basis, might need look high incidence graphs. big, also relatively densely populated.

Wow, pretty sad heart disease cancer related deaths remained fairly consistent. would've hoped would much steeper decline...  anti-maskers going flip one, guess also think vaccines bad too? several places US already have.

Seems like article calls doubt idea many edicts imposed us even kept us safe Yup, said I'm ""efficacy"" arm, want stay ""safety"" arm. 

I like ""but yo, got J&amp;J Pfizer, mess data?"" said no. /shrug Look one post see even specifically noted Pfizer Moderna, incidentally currently vaccines available United States. arguing something say. 

And even said that, including J&amp;J vaccine, yet repeat vaccines less deadly population compared COVID-19, original argument (which seems deleted). Blood clot risk less one million (for J&amp;J) still lower risk blood clots COVID. We've come long way doctors trying sous-vide masks attempts disinfect them.

There even video recently BJP politician deadass making patient ventilator drink ‚Äúgaumutra‚Äù (cow piss) claimed could cure Covid-19. I‚Äôll link find it.

Edit: [Found Let's Canada! Would nice vaccinate Americans prefer JnJ, allowing US vaccinate rest world faster countries experts suggested vaccinated people need wear masks, gather indoor..etc

so really variation avoid vaccine, would change argument. National leader gets early: using POWER POSITION cut line? DISGUSTING CORRUPTION! 

National leader waits turn line like everyone else: COURSE lets grandparents guinea pig. far I'm concerned, wants everyone get it, FIRST roll sleeve! kids back school since September New England, full time since October. Middle schools went full time January, high schools March.  fine. Teachers staff chose vaccinated (which them) full immunity. elementary school 400+ students known in-school case since late January, that's less 20% students voluntary remote learning.  

Remote ""learning"" unmitigated disaster lifelong repercussions students. day lowering average nothing J&amp;J pause? Probably something along lines ""get covid shot type, fully approved not. want one fully approved, options available.""  TIL

Thanks teaching me! America could also allow exports vaccine ingredients would help lol could go nationwide lockdown call army keep people locked indoors

That's strawman. real point is, ***don't*** always opportunity right reduce deaths. We're unique situation risk covid going every single day people get vaccinated. low enough yet--thousands Americans still dying every week--but going down. save many lives staying careful like mid-June, course that's moral thing do.

I'm glad Texas seems gotten lucky, general, evidence available suggests keep restrictions around little longer. Many countries are, new strain virus relax attitude many people causing spread everywhere.

But lady died long released hospital. sick leave since November fatigue memory loss minor heart problems unable go back work. 

Her heart finally gave months problems, something seems common among COVID survivals. Even vaccines 80% effective reducing severe cases variants still far beyond threshold effective shot. mean, can't worse Emergent amiright?  Now, now, imposing lockdown really simple, especially considering bad economy already is.

But organizing rallies letting Kumbh Mela continue honestly worst decisions ever. Yes completely understand limitation mothers new world economy prioritizes getting back work rather raising children. Thankfully companies sympathetic extended leaves new moms, realistically unless law mandating percentage paycheck paid X amount time post-birth, breastfeeding remain difficult many moms. fortunate run business, able build wife's schedule around breastfeeding, mothers luxury. take criticism all, definitely part conversation. know might make sound like asshole wouldn‚Äôt mean contracting virus, would safe vaccinated people go bars, concerts, travel?

India second biggest exporter pharmaceuticals US (China first, lol) good luck dealing horrific shortages drugs medical equipment that's horizon, hope nothing going right might already strained US hospital industry made super susceptible collapse supply lines suddenly wiped out. it‚Äôs fully approved vaccine everyone wants vaccine chance become fully vaccinated

Maybe coincidence, doctor eye specialist thought could related. know several people got shingles Moderna vaccine. still probably better get shingles Covid though. you‚Äôre right ! don‚Äôt know long term effects!. happens years road people crazy side effects covid? since won‚Äôt know, stay lockdown couple years see. (and doesn‚Äôt matter you‚Äôre vaccinated, still get covid suffer long term effects) read article well weeks ago (though can't remember exactly title would link it). Basically would mutate entirely new virus order evade mRNA vaccines. 


I wish CDC would emphasize risk variants could spread amongst UNVACCINATED would evade vaccines. They're inadvertently (or purposely?) whipping lot fear, empowering unaware beat fear drum spread misinformation. know downvoted, right; brother working Sanofi ramp actual manufacturing vaccine, results trial elicit strong enough response, decided stop tweak formula.

We're point people ignore ""OmgZ Canada!"" posts. always kind dumb getting dumber day.

Source: Canadian. We're ok. St Louis went drive hour get appointment half empty walk mass vaccination site downtown felt like week. I'm glad people getting it, wish rest would get butt get Logically makes sense (does mean happen course). Like /u/pizzainoven said, going depend individual communities. Low-vaccination areas going behaving totally like normal then, going church, high school football games, big family Thanksgivings Christmases, etc. people hoping rely herd immunity going find they're part low-immunity herd, we'll see wave cases, hospitalizations, deaths. surprised see times next couple years, like bouncing ball coming rest. nothing affect vaccinated people. Good.

Now accepted insurance. I'm still paying ER bill assaulted day Thanksgiving. I'm disputing that. saying restaurants businesses general required code draw x% fresh air ventilation systems. supports fact illegal all, time other, contrary Jake said comments. Thanks. think honestly cry whole shit over. past life seems distant. I'm probably stereotypical extrovert, love around people. Imagining possibility later summer Germany...Man...Life sweet again. keep study? sorry guys AMERICA FIRST!!! idea P word curious now. probably arent even allowed reply tell hope option! school currently saying distance option fall. I‚Äôm hoping rethink vaccine yet. Right half families chosen remote. Even half decide return fall, still leaves quarter kids school good options there‚Äôs vaccine yet.

The spread concerns well. seems spread easily kids immunity. really hope don‚Äôt find concerning long term effects mild cases later on, do, whole lot kids risk. eligible certain age, before. expensive try get eligible. Hopefully 9 million people ready go well eased week half first dose. Cases low enough, felt comfortable going little more. got second dose past Saturday, I'm basically comfortable whatever point. already extremely high level immunity (more would gone J&amp;J) cases continuing decline. I'll wear mask businesses mandate it, that, I'm back normal life. yet restaurants one dangerous places circulate air everywhere also maskless people. Thank Christ variants new strains. 

Correct please I'm wrong though something:

Are strains likely occur immunizations met? Like would catalyst virus mutating order better chance spreading new host? understand (it's lot) variants structurally same, strains structurally different? Sorry I'm dense want know variants strains watch for. Yeah well good thing charge. rule law make citizens stateless. That's UN convention, I'll remind you. 98% transmission work grocery stores one worried that. get person downvoted correct. gets approved, I'm fine employers making mandatory. different talking point, relax, buddy. implying use entirety available data within set studied? Smart thinking ND, also humanitarian thing do. 
Reasons blame CoronaVirus 2nd wave completely Modi Government


1. allow foreign vaccines. Said we're self sufficient Indian. allow private firms manufacture COVIDSHIELD COVAXIN. 


2. Following increase manufacturing capabilities. SII contractual obligation ; send 100 million vaccines able send 18 million. Following UK filed lawsuit them. imported vaccines took praise themselves. 


3. Age cap blunder allowing 45+ citizens get vaccinated. Indian Boomer population bang thalis rather getting vaccine. disinformation campaigns huge.


4. increase oxygen production since last year. 


5. paid media works wonders dissing ground reality actuality spreads like fire form cremations, blame then? 



6. imagine first stock deal vaccines India Jan 21; nations back May 20.




P.S Mandatory desperate clueless whatever MMS said letter, followed word word single day. Vaccine inventory really clotted pause üò≥ Funny, thinking people like you. Miscarriage first trimester common, usually unknown reasons. typical thought something wrong fetus developing body recognizes it. far evidence increased miscarriage rate pregnant women vaccinated beyond normal rate pregnant women receive vaccine.

The typical statistic quoted approximately 25% pregnancies end miscarriage, early woman even know pregnant yet.

Source: female, pregnant. told everyone won‚Äôt let us go back normal kids aren‚Äôt vaccinated! ‚Äúscience‚Äù sooner later gonna say it‚Äôs risky kids, long term effects, ect. people still think we‚Äôre normal summer. üôÑ think might confused ‚ÄúMEGA site‚Äù is. Mega site = baseball stadiums, Convention centers, etc. article linked talked lots SMALL sites like Bread City DC, small (and awesome) nonprofit. smaller sites, churches, mobile clinics‚Äîthose targeted towards disadvantaged members community. Agreed. cherry picking desperation - thing they‚Äôre justify mixing brands 1st 2nd doses.  certain point, need seriously consider public health guidance switching gears ""fully vaccinated people done masks distancing"" order curtail vaccine Maybe now, early/mid-June, first-dose vaccination stalling around 58%, we're seeing huge reduction hospitalizations community spread like expect? Yeah, put table.

Fully agreed! frustrating people fully vaccinated we're still act like we're still middle pre-vaccine period pandemic. least start saying ""No masks outdoors"" ""make goal July 4th drop masks social distancing get back normal life"". People died hospital hallways streets elsewhere pandemic, too. Health care systems overrun countries.

I‚Äôm denying deaths tragedy. think India needs lockdown, I‚Äôm normally anti-lockdown. I‚Äôm saying hyperbole we‚Äôre seeing pointless totally ignores large India is. precedented. clinical guidelines followed such. opinions written social media platform)

This quoted Facebook post.  gets approved summer people find new talking point actually already see pretty big difference metro/non-metro death rates, non-metro areas failed learn much first wave hit metro areas: (definition metro bottom). Agreed difference likely diverge even future. ability there, lack political prevented happening. Years ago, kid started mowing lawn, actually used cutting grass allergies bad (my parents box them). time reused them, got irritating allergies seemingly disappeared. you‚Äôre worried people cautious?  saying along. Yeah Americans self centered well may mark beginning end pandemic impacting everyday life NYC. Cases plummeting, getting vaccinated never get easier, natural immunity absurdly high. Come June/July time-frame, think impossible officials justify restrictions anymore (even indoor mask mandate) Yup, FDA approved.  Right, there's evidence there's going short term healthcare collapse due anti-vaxxer RNs, I'd maybe change tune, ways solve problem society long term mean involving anti-science people healthcare. Otherwise vaccine FUD. masks designed single use, part consideration different patients doctors different diseases, viruses, bacteria. Making single use prevents cross contamination patients hospital setting. mean get there. part country get hard way. Reading summary slides, looks like strategy unpause J&amp;J vaccine administration providers make recommendations based higher-risk groups (says mostly females &lt;50). Looks like they've created alert mechanism people report signs symptoms thrombosis. I'm hoping best here! Time start shipping vaccines overseas folks. need US point What's bet, struck down? I'll bet amount comfortable $5k Since multiple reports saying virus probably airborne, sorts masks help? cloth masks useless?  hate using term, actually pretty ablest you. deaf hard hearing people rely lip reading communicate world China offered help India - forget Kashmir/Aksai Chin help other. personally chose Pfizer vsafe data showed substantial difference fever rate (less likely Pfizer).

I say OB told get whichever one available first (at time Pfizer Moderna available). nope read subreddit, comment, sequenced everyone got infected, found 95% original virus. friend‚Äôs father dentist. caught COVID emergency procedure died. hope dentist get vaccinated soon. US what, roughly 40% first jabs now? EU countries mid 20s%.

We'll see numbers hit week, US like 55-60% first jab, 40% fully vaccinated 16+ age group. They've handed 220M doses. rising 5% per week, bit slower earlier, bit faster start second doses, first jabs necessarily slow pick pace swallowed initial wave first jabs.

The EU waited Phase II data nearly vaccines ordering, countries already bought initial production slots back June/July. November started going buying spree culminated lot contracts signed Nov/Dec/Jan. deals starting come fruition, great! realized screwed October, went buying spree try make mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

The EU get kinda bad luck draw. bet AZ, GSK/Sanofi, early one produced. GSK Sanofi whatever reason getting sued despite vaccine never even making approval stage.

&amp;#x200B;

But January late -- first dibs Pfizer vaccine June, balked. could another 100+ million vaccines delivered took deal. went back negotiation table November able secure small amounts due Pfizer excess capacity, go work deal Sanofi, took January. Yes, impressive. less impressive taken deal originally given June.

&amp;#x200B;

I think point we're mainly agreeing -- I'm saying EU's decision wait Phase II data many vaccines committing funds damning AZ's failures deliver. focus blame EU spreading risk around, focusing blame AZ. There's enough go around, time June/July understand EU's reluctance make deals spend cash. 

My family lives Europe July booked trips US visit early winter knew decent chance they'd need go get vaccine (and hopped over). EU citizens looking July saying ""eh, seems bit risky"" making contingency plans, big diplomats seen also. could said don‚Äôt want legal issues . that‚Äôs waiting  think? sweet summer child betting window open now. much would like wager? it‚Äôs not. would asked doctor told you."
