Neither us issues wearing mask 8+ hours time. None. 32k deaths!! Good job nyc!!  Oh definitely. appearances me, cloth mask fine. get taste ""long pig"", nothing else satisfy craving. It‚Äôs apparently going take rest country many stories details pointed get point across.

Numbers pulled CDC American association whatever disease, add fact American barely get enough sleep storm brewing. want something people want. fair world others suffer stupid people.

What would get plan world innocent people would suffer can't prove done enough earn bed. would get priority based affluence.

The justice system least pretends rigged providing council judgement peers. argument. reason barred entry.

There alternative ways almost anything. Utilize options. Literally thing anti mask excuses happened 100 years ago, sure much learned.

Im legit trying asshole youre bringing kid outside house without fucking mask you‚Äôre absolutely ‚Äúno mask‚Äù idiots we‚Äôre seeing.

Note: According Worldometer, Massachusetts report numbers today, 49 states Washington D.C. have.

Fortunately, deaths reported Alaska, Maine, Wyoming, Vermont today. honestly best covid related conversation I've Reddit 5 months. 

That's really interesting unexpected. Like friend, I've read resurgence symptoms recovering specifically exposed another covid positive person. sorta makes sense would think body would ready grapple covid shortly recovery.

The eyes vs processing thing makes sense too, although million dollar question causes different reactions/symptoms

When say elevates NO, mean covid does? causes higher interferes replication Pretty much, yeah. Excluding Sweden failed optimally execute strategy areas (like protecting elderly), strategy succeed fall based vaccine becomes widely administered. longer takes, better Swedish strategy is, vice versa. can't remember issue read person expierience really bad nerve pain around face masks made worse. 

I Could also imagine person, particularly kid, autism experiencing sensory overload would trouble mask. Isn‚Äôt disease health experts worst nightmare. I'm trying figure can't get covering piehole keeps breathing viorus someone.

If need numbers, look published studies. need work you?

Joking aside, right wear mask plane. airline also right let fly plane can't follow rules. Good. I'm going debate here, caloric deficit way lose weight. lost 80 lbs tracking calories walking/jogging 60 minutes day. tracking nutrition, realized could eat (at least volume-wise) eating healthier foods like cruciferous vegetables, fresh unprocessed meat, eggs, yogurt, grains. end came calories. 

Sure, eating avoiding certain foods help, gaining muscle help keep raise metabolism bit. consume 3000 calories every day burn 2000, gonna gain weight. Consume 1500 burn 2500 gonna lose. Simple math. 18 really healthy almost died flu too. first time it, never ever anything serious happen that. Scared shit me. love goalposts shifted cases instead deaths now. Let's put scale perspective, since good math logic. statistics mandatory everyone.

Also probably: Cuomo standard-bearer, hero story.

And because, use imagination, conceivable Florida could someday bad New York, means DeSantis (as example) done horrible job.

New York New Jersey combined 1,706.7 coronavirus deaths per million. rest America (the 48) 313.67 coronavirus death per million. two states alone 3 times worse Italy! stats likely ignore gulp whatever divisive drivel media feeding today: also forget New Yorkers fled lockdowns started happening...Florida! medical quotes.

 Blame game escalates Catalonia grapples second wave virus. 
Mis-steps weaknesses exposed Spanish region endures new round restrictions. 
-

Jose Luis Morales Rull, lead coronavirus doctor one main hospitals Catalan city Lleida, took first time months Spain‚Äôs original lockdown ended June 21. single Covid-19 patient remaining, looked forward closing dedicated ward going back normal. returned work two days later 16 infected patients, numbers stopped rising since. Dr Morales week opened fourth Covid-19 ward treat influx victims second wave infections around Lleida regional capital¬†Barcelona prompted authorities impose new restrictions province. 

Catalonia, 16 per cent Spain‚Äôs population, accounted almost half its¬†16,410 Covid-19 cases recorded past two weeks. ‚ÄúThey underestimated enemy,‚Äù doctor said. Spain one hardest-hit countries virus took hold spring. contained original outbreak enough late June largely reopen economy return healthcare management regional governments. virus could begin spreading almost immediately Catalonia two northern regions, Arag√≥n Galicia, exposes mis-steps glaring weaknesses official response, critics say.

 agree animosity separatist-led regional government ‚Äî Generalitat ‚Äî Madrid authorities contributed Catalonia‚Äôs problems. But, say, existing tensions compounded lack preparation, complacency failure track cases, underpinned false assumption would plenty time second wave hit. ‚ÄúThe health authorities thought we‚Äôd hiatus virus summer, although I‚Äôve idea data based on,‚Äù said Alex Arenas, epidemic modeller Universitat Rovira Virgili Tarragona. ‚ÄúThat looks like monumental error.‚Äù¬† Among first hit second wave Lleida‚Äôs care homes slaughterhouses. different reasons, residential centres meat-processing facilities vectors infections around world. generally contained systems infections tracked.

But July, tens thousands temporary workers¬†from Morocco sub-Saharan Africa began arriving Catalonia annual fruit vegetable harvest. Many undocumented, living together crowded apartments open, making difficult monitor. population virus took hold ‚Äî hidden first among young able-bodied workers mild, any, symptoms. ‚ÄúBy time realise there‚Äôs outbreak group like this, already lots cases. don‚Äôt think anyone thought widespread,‚Äù said Mar√≠a Jos√© Serra Spain‚Äôs epidemic management agency, confirmed 700 temporary farm workers infected Catalonia. one point, 60 per cent Dr Morales‚Äô Covid-19 patients labourers, though fallen 15 per cent virus spread widely.
 
The vituperative arguments Catalonia‚Äôs shortcomings failure deploy sufficient numbers contact tracers track infections. Madrid government returned healthcare management regions called develop tracking systems but¬†did say many staff hire. Health experts say grave error. ‚ÄúThey could said, ‚ÄòUnless hire tracers won‚Äôt allow move next stage de-confinement‚Äô,‚Äù said Helena Legido-Quigley, Barcelona-born associate professor public health¬†at National University Singapore.
 days first lockdown ended, Catalonia fewer 200 trackers, Mr Arenas said minimum 1,400 needed. A¬†May¬†contract document Generalitat health system,¬†first reported news site ElDiario.es,¬†anticipated hiring 182, believe would enough second wave hit autumn. ‚ÄúThey said first didn‚Äôt trackers caseload low,‚Äù said Ada Colau, Barcelona mayor, whose party allied far-left Podemos, junior partner prime minister Pedro S√°nchez‚Äôs coalition government. ‚ÄúThey insisted prepared weren‚Äôt.‚Äù Others say inadequacies confined one region. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs equally bad Madrid places‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚ÄâThe tracing seems completely under-developed,‚Äù said Miguel Hern√°n, professor Harvard‚Äôs Chan School Public Health served Spanish government pandemic advisory board.

The Catalan government odds Madrid long Mr S√°nchez declared state alert March 14 effort halt virus‚Äôs spread, confining people homes seizing control security health services regions. Joaquim Torra, Catalan government‚Äôs president, labelled ‚Äúfailure‚Äù, saying Madrid slow act failed provide enough personal protection equipment hospital staff. Ms Colau said Catalan government take share blame. ‚Äúspent lot time making statements press little time managing. we‚Äôre seeing consequences,‚Äù said. Catalan government said ‚Äúprioritised saving lives times‚Äù crisis. week, Catalonia continues grapple second wave infection, government filled vacancy head public health, post empty almost two months. regional health service also pledged hire 500 trackers ramp-up virus testing. Dr Morales said Catalonia‚Äôs experience cautionary tale parts Spain. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd scared Valencia. pear peach harvests end here, it‚Äôs orange harvest September. olive harvest Andaluc√≠a,‚Äù said. ‚Äú[They] keep Lleida mind warning, thing doesn‚Äôt happen them.‚Äù Short term thinking likely combined belief COVID ""overblown"". one two die, blame old age.

I'd think like ""no tests, problems"". test find someone infected whole place enact measures adds cost. nothing hoped (prayed) nothing happens come without extra cost. Heard Radio yesterday, quite amusing. Ignorance always likely conspiracy. conspiracies never happen, do, successful, must people involved possible.

Good point critical thinking. shame no-one really teaches that. ü§∑  DeSantis care many people get infected. seems ignore understand 41.2% adults Florida higher risk getting serious illness become infected. oh said it? he'd definitely never lie.HURR DURR CHIP ME, DONT WANT TRACKED needs balance safe trying live lives. live Southern California outdoors. Outdoor dining reasonably safe. Three households bad given circumstances. way paranoid. perfectly reasonable eat outdoor restaurant. 

There really thing cautious. allow something. Realistically speaking low risk. It‚Äôs worth making complete hermit. wouldn‚Äôt eat lot, ONCE. I‚Äôve heard sorts excuses old people ranging ‚ÄúI survived xyz disease 30 years ago I‚Äôm strong‚Äù ‚Äúdemocratic hoax‚Äù ‚Äúit happens Asians‚Äù. Except that, people businesses, is. Also, Trump would never actually put national strategy enforce it. Unless something abusing protesters federal police. 

Millions people businesses already bankrupt. Millions people facing eviction end year. 

Congress shown incapable providing lasting, working, accessible financial support citizens across country isn‚Äôt mostly earmarked business bloat political brinkmanship. 

The best scenario economic health recovery US soldier everyone wears mask. seems people half that, nothing effectively recover end. 

The best lasting situation COVID turn lethal kill million two asinine nutjobs country people take reality seriously again. way people take seriously kills someone close them. Otherwise we‚Äôre going opening closing destroying remaining economy foundation people deniers shit everything done control it. 

The market time high, though, that‚Äôs nice. /s  Yes, absolutely right, acknowledged that. ""Luckily"" depression comes functional OCD add-on, means use energy cleaning instead finishing vast amount work need get done. 

I hate everyone assumes working home great; everyone living space conducive working productively. I'm even talking animals children, though pet learned lot new ways get attention since started working home. infect families heavy viral load* I'm sure think easy never struggled.

In case, someone looks different, mean deserve die go bar eat restaurant indoors go without mask. 

That straight heartless.  Eating COVID viral particles concern small amounts. likely food massive numbers unless infected person sneezing food reason.

This virus adapted attacking human lungs, swallow food going lungs. goes right stomach full protease (protein-breaking-down) enzymes, fun fact: viruses made proteins. deactivated basically instantly. Yes, he‚Äôs reporting governments handling Covid. Well person sick weak can‚Äôt wear mask airplane, aren‚Äôt chances dying mid flight much greater? don‚Äôt blame airlines wanting fly - flight attendants take risk people kick bucket flight. 

(Sarcasm, way) Lol what? Dude guaranteed die get it. Hell people even symptoms. That's nonsense. Acting like Darwinism false. likely people get it, pass people higher risk die, still alive 

I forgotten dumb sub Ok Karen really easy get COVID. Stay home. Like, really, could anything simple? zero chance family get disease stay home. absolutely must venture out, make fast wear mask. Again, complicated. protecting sick vulnerable. keeping local hospital beds available them, know absolutely needed locals. 

Did read gambling addict analogy? might well say gambling addict - ""what kind country provide financial support someone need?"" keep giving money lose; take entire extended family them.

The thing advocating result deaths; Texas states handling better. Yep, mostly still poor. US stole Brits. is.

You find loads counterfeit goods many south east asian countries. west problem everyone best friend. like China poor. like India best friend west, 20 years later they're wealthy strong they'll next evil empire lol.  @ next time lol would love see shocked pikachu faces get fucked.

they get subreddit called covidjustice content like this. i'd sub sec. Wow, get automodded like earlier. moron going ignorant MAGA sheep told Arby's disgrace?

This running gag *The Daily Show Jon Stewart* years:

-  hello neighbor. work suburb Fort Worth. Let tell crazy mask story! still can‚Äôt believe happened tho. Let set stage. making drinks espresso machine. lady ordering POS. keeps pulling mask talk coworker tell needs stop safety ours. laughs continues anyway. give one go. Nothing. upset also Tired Overworked elect get fast possible expense everyone else line drive thru.

Before leaves, actually real pulls mask licks palm hand slaps right center order pick counter. Tells us good day smile dares us react. don‚Äôt. Joke her, green apron renders us dead inside. She‚Äôs even verbally abusing us it‚Äôs even bad could be. watch leave. Someone goes sanitize everything breathed touched.

I feeling defeated encounter today you‚Äôve shown change frame mind thankful work group people put bare minimum care choosing wear masks work.

It‚Äôs shame neighbors dumbasses psychopaths. may early notice something serious. 

In first week March 3 nearby HEBs positive employees. That's started proactive. 

Meanwhile former employer busy checking completely undone 'cleaning checklist's sending corporate they're still alive then. mentioned height Italy covid too. knew lot people soc media angry doctors etc understandable, imo facing super tough choice. government responsible fault mishandling it. hospitals protocols like resources tapped out. It‚Äôs sad come due poor leadership irresponsible people following health recommendations.

Edit: spelling good points forget depression up. guarantee accounts least it. There's guy thread says he's showering weekly. Big hits rather dirty energy required get clean. Yessss wear mask fuck off, die care. Modi trolls army downvoting thread ... Considering Stephen Miller, may planned smoother pillow sooner later. death schedule. got sneezed several kids last year teach 3-5th grades.... important dollar store you‚Äôre going pandemic? Stupidity. Ignorantly assuming everyone downvoting sheep highlights ignorance. plenty reasons people can't drive far. Lack license, lack money, disability, car, etc. common sense, dense person needs explained. come lack oxygen vital organa. Apparently dip even know damage done.

Even reason get oxymeter understand business interest pathologizing behavior counters productivity recognize behavior comes treat that. dystopian. Emotional Support Animal. people legitimately need one, that's airlines allow it. 99%^* people bringing ESA avoid airline's pet fee bring animal otherwise allowed cabin. supposed note licensed therapist, websites give one fee real consultation/diagnosis.

And get started people put fake service dog vests untrained pets bring everywhere. I'd love bring dogs everywhere go, respect people.

No, attitude knowing there's way China cases that. countries around rising numbers, ? C'mon. cops every crossroad commerce travel completely stopped... 

But believe China great want. Give fucking break won't? Man, fucking spoilsport, thought I'd controlling room's light mind ***and*** safe Corona-chan one fell swoop! Propagandists trying hard humanise terrorists like him, gulfnews propaganda piece nothing else.

I‚Äôm 23 horrible! targeted Chinese man, 3 people wearing masks too! Rules rules: exceptions. believe ethical prevent situation happening first place Coming NY I'm waiting reinfection....


People already starting revert daily lives bit youth baseball started again(which irks me) tehyre 2 things bad R u asking doctor research , lol Early reports say plenty heading without. Shops saying enforce someone tweeted large supermarket store someone door said masks required went in. One piece police advice shame wearing masks, another know hidden conditions. Chaos far away seems!  would argue legitimately pathological response fear many. people absolutely terrified idea COVID real, latch anything would make fake. COVID real threat, means health authorities either hopelessly ignorant *maliciously lying*, arguably makes little sense would maliciously lying know job all. choose believe, way rationalize desperately need true: COVID real threat. someone get denounced rabbi???

That's like lawyer testify you.

Oh wait, that's standard Trump admin too. LOL. page learn upsides vacination show arguments beacuse im tired bullshit antivaxers, ignorancy conspiracy theories. People caught virus. realize? first days testing positive Vietnam basically Jerusalem WWZ except wall didn‚Äôt come down. someone explain use mask has, one around? take L keep moving dude That's Ozone mask must ass. kind cardio mask breathing heavy af. run marathon without one. assume gives respiratory system workout. Seeing lungs overcome added air resistance wearing mask adds. That's bad news USA office industry... open space offices seem dangerous environment people. [Case  Quiet pervasive. can't remove without acutely aware covering something up, making noise fill void someone else used contribute life. expect quiet broken familiar things, sometimes heart drop suddenly remember been. 

It really brutal part grief. There's great thing rage at. there, reminding isn't. 

I great sympathy sadness mother's situation. Exactly said would happen New York hit hard. Unfortunately, definitely got plenty deniers (not gonna call skeptics that‚Äôs unfair legitimate skepticism) UK.

Compared States though I‚Äôd say we‚Äôre lucky mainstream figures support them. need defund police military, fund healthcare system instead. Option A: keep Patient X ventilator live, Patient dies home.

Option B: Patient X sent home Patient gets ventilator, little 50/50 shot survival.

Which ethical? know. take chance die mathematically optimizes combined survival rate? 

Basically, moral risk die save one sure? need research understand basic competency trusted individuals medical fields might know bit reality showrunners. RIP, friend. It‚Äôs nice knowing you.  Yeah thing it‚Äôs another person younger you. better chance ( usually ) surviving also much live through. know, it‚Äôs shitty I‚Äôd rather stay home I‚Äôm comfortable. already going die virus there‚Äôs still cure, it‚Äôs bad it‚Äôs going end well anyway. Things might ""better"" city upstate bad/worse ever. County work announced outbreak another nursing home. cases high, takes one dick weed Walmart super spreader general public virus. Obviously two people same, teenage brother Down's he's really good wearing mask he's told to. (Maybe years wearing eyepatch pirate costume got used things face?)

The day told phone ""You wear mask people get sick. virus. mask goes nose."" he's better lot neurotypical people, haha Get high horse. thought pulling carry-on first class overhead bins. CRJ700s (I'm pretty sure that's since ERJs retired now) least three rows first class too. really bulkhead, curtains. respect them..... need respect her.

It would like stopping blind person getting carpool. actually enforced...it would probably enough. Well case... Speaking super spreaders..... Sort of, said there‚Äôd increase deaths, was, I‚Äôll admit wouldn‚Äôt guessed 300% increase 200% (doubling 38 75+) Id expected.

My point still stands. Cases equal outcome.

From beginning June daily case counts increased 1100% yes, daily deaths increased 300%. That‚Äôs still large disparity. Cases seems peaked week ago suppose might see deaths approach something 150 per day range maximum. Corona Karen. keeps doubling down, sick. since you‚Äôre sub know will, please take care listen body. know don‚Äôt know know you‚Äôre going get better   kind shocked many anti-mask incident videos YouTube.

SMH try something. nothing done?? 

Field hospitals. 
Overflow ventilator splitters
Bring nurses + doctors states.

Oh, wear f‚Äôing masks!!! risk avoid taking risk shouldnt take I'm hoping people recognize continue make mask wearing less taboo, like countries, even pandemic gets control. Maybe enjoy less colds flu result years come. Facial burn scars leave ears deformed mouth? completely right.

Unfortunately, actually sub coronavirus itself. anti-Trump sub coronavirus theme.

God help among 95% world's population live country governed him. still going hear time, Americans think world revolves around them.  usually call Mini Goebbels, like better. ""There's room top,

Meanwhile, Von Mises jaw-dragging idiot whose ideas would lead us right back serfdom pretends trying avoid.

The gold standard recipe massive, crushing poverty. Value-based currencies ineffective currencies precisely human population economic system constantly expanding, gold-backed (or value-backed) currency uniquely unable cope with.

Basically, Mises institude group rich folks trying impose serfdom everyone, pretending exact opposite. fact still funding ought tell exactly represent - common folk.

Louisiana, Arizona, Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina, Georgia noted areas higher concern California Texas right now.

Even said, biggest issue frustrating end administration still never treated NATIONAL problem. Focusing individual states point us little good, virus longer compartmentalized specific areas. way going even moderately successful strict federal guidelines, half states completely failing own. won‚Äôt able use phone credit card social credit system don‚Äôt get mandatory vaccinations sounds plans. incorrect. things progress viable vaccine months world enough manufactured able inoculate ‚Äúregular‚Äù citizen.

Except small American counties battlefields. could absolutely prevented politicians simply implemented measures overwhelming majority medical experts said needed. failed. committee deem COVID-19 patients likely die send home family, Jose Vasquez, county health authority, said news conference Tuesday. Hes intelligent manipulative patient norm though, correct?

I think days past symptom onset ability infect others drops dramatically. Otherwise girlfriend live would caught it. state got sick, came home 4 days symptoms started. isolate March supposed symptoms cough, fever short breath develop. Slept bed. They're wrong; much, *much* safer anywhere world US. problem is, they're infecting rest world leaving, dooming death-ridden hellscape we're destined for. Apparently got old shit.

So? Want put scientist robes predict % world die COVID 19 end century? ""so far"" highly intellectually dishonest dismissal hard cold facts. course far. That's way present day historical data works.

You think proving point trying (and failing) dismiss facts agree narrative. 

Also, saying dying worst part COVID? What's worse death? really going tell parents kids ""hey, kids got easy, death worst part virus""?

I'm sorry simply can't deal intellectual dishonesty. come say came say: ""we lockdown vaccine distributed everyone I'm comfy staying home"". Makes sense, they're fit fly glad insisted wear mask.

Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett announced Thursday re-impose certain restrictions,¬†including closing bars,¬†to curb troubling rise number coronavirus cases Marion County.

Marion County bars nightclubs closed shutdown earlier year shutter doors least Aug. 12, Hogsett said. Restaurants return 50% capacity indoors bar seating. restaurants must close hours midnight 5 a.m.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

In addition, gyms fitness clubs go 25% capacity. Tattoo parlors, hair salons, spas open appointment only. Retail stores malls go 75% capacity, libraries 50% capacity curbside pickup encouraged. ¬†

Social gatherings limited 50 people, meetings events 250 starting Monday.

Hogsett Marion County Public Health Department Dr. Virginia A. Caine said increasing caseload left choice act.

At pandemic‚Äôs peak thus far county saw 200 new cases day average. late June seven-day average number new case dipped 45. Now, Marion seeing average almost 100 new cases day.

‚ÄúWithout response trajectory undo hard work put last four months,‚Äù Hogsett said. ‚ÄúWe cannot let happen.‚Äù


Indianapolis‚Äô¬†poor showing drew White House attention Wednesday, according a¬†report Center Public Integrity. private call local leaders around country, Dr. Deborah Birx, leader White House Coronavirus Task Force, singled Indianapolis 10 cities.

Each city list, included Baltimore, Cleveland, Columbus, Ohio, Nashville, Tennessee, seen positivity rate increase, Birx said, called leaders¬†to take ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù steps control virus.

Marion County seen average positivity rate coronavirus testing climb low 4% late June 10% currently, Caine said. Neighboring counties also seeing increase cases.

The one bright side: far, hospitalizations appear flat past weeks, though emergency room visits COVID-like symptoms ticked slightly,

One likely reason stems demographics testing positive. initial shutdown, 27% tested positive age 40, Caine said.

That shifted 55%, 20- 39-year-olds accounting 44% cases.

Officials decided intervene places population likely gather, often without social distancing abiding mandatory mask order county put place beginning month attempt tame virus.

‚ÄúWe really get ahead cases,‚Äù Caine said. ‚ÄúIf don‚Äôt get ahead cases really rapidly, look risk transmission occurring.‚Äù

Health officials fear young people getting infected today could spread virus parents grandparents, leading increased hospitalizations deaths later. States Florida Texas, saw younger people fuel surges case numbers month ago, reporting record number hospitalizations among ill.

At start month, reports coming states led Caine Hogsett enact mandatory mask order, even though Marion‚Äôs numbers yet started rise dramatically.

By last week, changed. Marion County state whole started seeing alarmingly high numbers. Earlier week, demurring several weeks, Gov. Eric Holcomb said would put place¬†a mask order starting Monday.

Over past two weeks Marion County‚Äôs mask order, health officials tried first educate establishments following order, Caine said. Businesses comply received $50 citation second complaint $500 fine third.

Since mask order went place, health department fielded 250 complaints, 75% citations issued gone bars restaurants, Caine said.

Wearing face covering simplest thing anyone protect virus, Caine said. people able that, said, ‚Äúwe never reach new normal seek.‚Äù

One burning question many remains happen schools. Thursday Hogsett pushed answer question, saying earliest Marion County school district start in-person instruction Aug.¬†5. said Caine would give guidance schools next week another week data.

As rest city begin experience semblance normalcy, Hogsett said answer rested largely actions Indianapolis residents.

""We must better, especially younger adults social settings,"" Hogsett said. ""If want bars clubs return, better city."" suppose idiots wearing masks would listen Obama president told wear mask? don‚Äôt.  that‚Äôs assuming immunity virus/vaccine lasts great length time. don‚Äôt even enough data know yet. actually thinking too.

Dr. Goldman among camp researchers believe chances getting COVID-19 fomites probably much smaller originally thought. Although support hand hygiene cleaning disinfecting surfaces, suggest measures, physical distancing wearing masks, play far bigger role preventing spread new coronavirus. they‚Äôre right, means pushing elevator buttons, touching door handles allowing children outdoor playground equipment less risky previously believed.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve [still] got protect yourself,‚Äù Dr. Goldman said, emphasizing people ignore seriousness COVID-19. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôve got protect correctly ‚Äì worrying surfaces, worrying breathe.‚Äù

Saskatchewan records highest daily COVID-19 cases, province urges number rural communities limit spread

Alberta highest daily COVID-19 jump since May, return shutdown planned

Court challenge launched Ontario disclosure COVID-19 testing police

In comment published Lancet earlier month, titled ‚ÄúExaggerated risk transmission COVID-19 fomites,‚Äù noted studies upon assumptions surface contamination based reflect real-life situations. example, multiple studies suggest human coronaviruses survive surfaces several days. However, studies, researchers used amounts viruses several orders magnitude larger people would normally encounter, said.

Some studies used 1 million 10 million infectious virus particles sample. would equivalent collecting droplets 10,000 100,000 infected people applying one small area, Dr. Goldman said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs absurd,‚Äù said, noting doesn‚Äôt dispute quality research. Rather, ‚Äúit nothing real world.‚Äù

In studies using much smaller quantities, human coronaviruses shown survive much shorter amounts time. one study, said, survived one three hours. different study, said better reflected amount virus people would typically encounter, infectious virus particles found hour.

Another problem types studies many looked presence what‚Äôs called viral RNA, nucleic acid virus, necessarily presence actual viable virus ‚Äì is, virus that‚Äôs able cause infection, said Gerald Evans, chair division infectious diseases Queen‚Äôs University.

RNA sticky molecule, said, explaining adheres surfaces difficult get rid of.

‚ÄúPhysically, looks like goo,‚Äù said.

The tests many scientists use, like used diagnose COVID-19 people, home piece viral RNA amplify target detectable, Dr. Evans said. However, tests determine whether viable virus there. so, scientists need take sample collected area put cell culture, explained. viable virus present, infect cells culture, whereas viral RNA, own, not.

Dr. Evans said researchers China, conducted environmental study hospitals public places, able find viable virus highly contaminated areas ‚Äì namely health care settings, certain hospital bathrooms change rooms staff removed personal protective equipment.

The risk catching COVID-19 surface also depends presence viable virus, much deposited there. Dr. Evans said people tend shed greatest amount virus particles upper respiratory tract within day two developing symptoms. mild disease, eight nine days sick, ‚Äúthe amount virus they‚Äôre shedding that‚Äôs actually infectious virtually zero,‚Äù said.

Transmission fomites also depends many variables, including material upon deposited. virus able survive long hard, non-porous materials stainless steel, exposed environment than, example, palm hands covered respiratory secretions, said.

High temperatures high humidity seem reduce ability establish infection, though relationship always clear-cut, added. Moreover, ultraviolet light sun likely renders virus inactive, using outdoor playground equipment probably risky, said.

Given factors, Dr. Evans said it‚Äôs still worth investing cleaning disinfecting.

But, said, ‚ÄúThe problem disinfecting protocols ‚Äì I‚Äôm way‚Ä¶ ‚Äì it‚Äôs really addressing major route transmission, respiratory droplet transmission.‚Äù

Samira Mubareka, virologist infectious disease specialist Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre Toronto, said similar thoughts Dr. Goldman limitations studies discussed Lancet. However, still personally wouldn‚Äôt comfortable allowing children play playground equipment.

Dr. Mubareka said there‚Äôs general consensus close, sustained contact infected individuals leads transmission, it‚Äôs hard determine situations whether virus spread contact fomites shared breathing zones.

Among households nursing homes, lot transmission occurs, ‚Äúit‚Äôs hard separate two things. co-exposures.‚Äù

Since many variables could affect whether one catches COVID-19 fomites, including human behaviour ‚Äì whether children touch faces contact shared surface ‚Äì Dr. Mubareka said risk vary one situation another.

Wtf nba getting tested frequently fastly You‚Äôre rock star. sanity saving me. Thank much posting! children teenagers died must undiagnosed old age? Yo fucking good. Every day I'm astonished people's definition ""sticking man."" can't wear mask due ""medical"" reasons, allowed public due ""medical"" reasons. 

Grocery stores drive store, load car. Almost businesses services. reliable vehicle, someone else pick groceries, get everything else shipped you.

This time Karen's &amp; Kevin's about, complaining stupid shit even exist. also time people ignorant. Maybe someone told flu? aggressive. B. E. Aggressive. wonder big pool size PCR test Urumqi, 600,000 person per day capacity already. Must like 50 person pool something. people ""need"" companion animals? people phobias allergies (life threatening). never understand people don‚Äôt give crap virus... it‚Äôs terrifying thing ever. Lmao oh complete conspiracy theorist okay. Well since logic apply world course makes sense selfish wear mask because...reasons guess? weird support government much time think they're going put tracking device vaccine. Like pick, one lmao. like scary old Democrats gonna sneak facilities making vaccines spite follow every boring move. already track know everything phone smart devices. 

Also I'm pretty sure fucked even closed borders China, already spiraling point. 

Yet though, mask? think every mask tracking device hold vaccines ready? whining ""muh freedom"" someone asking something? also pitch fit stores signs saying ""No shirt, shoes, service""? Clearly infringement rights dick hanging moments follow logic. like pants protect anyone anything either makes even less sense.

Oh god.

I gave good example someone, horrific workplace injury mangled nose/mouth point mask would restrict breathing doctor thinks best interests wear mask.

Saying ""There reason"" ridiculous rebuttal point; ready spend hefty amount. get eBay, pay it. Kn95 lot cheaper need make train medically challenged people. Like Polar Express plague doctor That's super cute! Wish Luxury. Normally panic catch next tin can. EMT asthma, wore N95 I‚Äôd go cough lung outside take breath put mask on.

Just throwing there, i'm perfect health horrific workplace injury damaged nose/mouth point mask would obstruct breathing much?

My point discussion ""mask/no mask"" ""go out/don't go out"" doctor airline.

Saying ""wear mask"" fine, ""if can't wear mask medical disability, excluding you"" imho outright discrimination. **CANT** follow rules discriminatory. Hey know what, point you‚Äôre voting idiots like guy go ahead get fucked That's hot take dude. here. Unless I'm attack mask bother bit. attack excuse someone away people, remove mask, use inhaler, put mask back on.  doubt future learn history. use hope we‚Äôd learn adage don‚Äôt learn history doomed repeat it. point wouldn‚Äôt surprised future pandemic winds repeating stupid lessons learned Spanish Flu.

Bear mind even super strict lockdown today, would see numbers continue rise 3 weeks. That's happened Spain one hardest lockdowns world.  think too, also read headlines saying minorities, poor, people color basically dying much higher rates...

Hmmmm.  Weird. almost like wearing mask hard.... synthetic meat also plant-based meat. ""common"" meat extracted bodies cows, pigs, chicken etc. not, indeed, grow plants. Actually, often give one comes first. 

And beds fill, like easily kick out. They're barely conscious can't walk steps own.

You're fucked selfish anti-mask idiots got infected 3 4 weeks earlier, took hospital beds. ate three bites rice one piece broccoli, likely full trying get eating it.

The doctors nurses carry sadness rest lives.

I still remember many faces give black ribbon since ambulances capacity bring back local doctors unable save them.

It really sad hear rich country like US end getting horrible situation.

I really hope find way fix it. Anyone else feel like 2001 space oddysey runs around spaceship? That's jogging back forth five paces keep excercise. Also, local public health nurse state epidemiologist say every single briefing unless otherwise indicated doctor, everyone wear masks. can‚Äôt contact people outside family unless it‚Äôs medical reasons. say nearly everyone can. say that? I‚Äôm medical expert idea maybe can‚Äôt. say every medical expert earth says blatantly false. Even CDC little disclaimer there. reason even included post (although immediate concern behavioral rather medical) always so. I‚Äôve never heard doctor nurse briefings say everyone, it‚Äôs always nearly everyone. 90% New Zealand uninhabited. Density cities Denver. It'll show excess deaths eventually. However, remember lot people even trust death count, try explain excess death numbers work think confuse inflate number ""fancy math"". problem, pet peeve mine People contain multitudes. UK built several ""Nightingale"" hospitals March/April exhibition centers around country. Luckily never needed peak quite overwhelm cortical care capacity. I'm astounded populous states like Texas capacity place far timeline. helps Jacinda spend hours bragging could identify elephant remember 5 words.

Bloody show-off probably gets poo toilet well. Fucking intellectual.

I've rip dramatically take gasps air climbing series stairs apartment. still wear get inside home. sounds pretty horrible. sister worked retirement home briefly, conditions awful. liked residents, hated working there. Right? friend COPD working since started. Wearing mask 8-10 hrs day. screenshot use it?
This exact reaction response got back family left utterly speechless hardly put words coherent sentence. 
""We THIS!"" could get out. :/ saw som say vaccine poison used safe thought smart u think bill gates is? could company funds get unsafe vaccine past cdc administered govt. hes nerd Northeast got hit hard back testing capacity, widespread public use PPE, good knowledge virus would spread wild. 

The South excuse irrationally, immorally, incompetently theyve handled pandemic.

Pride cometh fall. would got formul√¶. logic, 9/11 completely negligible 2,977 people died even worth talking about? one missed hour's work victims' families quiet, think? that, Texas governor would even time burry head sand, would fill hospitals nationwide ones Texas. 

That's like captain Titanic telling everyone grab bucket start bailing, rather telling everyone get lifeboats. worsening problem wasting time (and lives), there's one real solution.

Or, say like lending money gambling addict. help them, lets dig deeper owed real shot beating disease staffed hospital bed.

Then let Texan take hospital bed Montana (or your, anyone else's) parents grandparents may need. encourage entire family max credit cards help fund gambling addict. lost credibility lied masks pre-existing immunity. virus new mean forget everything ever knew. friend called Karen used date fifteen years ago even write back much now. think pretty depressed it.

I mean, union organizer. completely reverse Karen meme.

It's bitterly unfair people use people's names insult, _and_ total assholes politely point out. many border crossing Vietnam countries yet again? 22? many roads, like 16?

Ofc great find border crossing Austria Germany within random 10km stretch. Vietnam basically islands jungle.

I hope happen. Eventually, enough people get sick enough people lose family give America choice along. Exactly happen, one say. social political aspects *by far* difficult part epidemic modeling. exact problem culture talking about. enough expect people something, say *they should*.

If want people *change behaviour*, really need pragmatic.

The pants analogy work well already established behaviour people. Wearing masks, keeping away others, proper, regular handwashing *new* things people.

I'm sure sectors performing poorly. I'll interested sunscreen performs.

Are people showering taking worse care themselves? Maybe, lockdown change fact humans prefer clean.

The social pressure applied schools. applied government. taxes supposed for. coming home trip mid-March day everything shutting down. toddler licked elevator airport. nightmare. Gov. Greg Abbott issued orders reopening state, overriding local control decision-making, COVID-19 cases surged.

He directly overruled orders local authorities.

But right, many people may engaged unsafe activities resulting sickness. opening without ensuring proper safety protocols engaged careless too.

I agree, everyone look themselves, also look elected leaders should, least believe, look society's best interests mind. Leaders need held accountable, otherwise they're anxious increasing stock prices keeping everyone healthy. Make sure mask comfortable (doesn't fall off, tight hurts ears, etc) - fine. may forget get excited, simple reminder solves issue. possible Fidel Castro ordered hit Kennedy put end numerous US assassinations attempts Fidel's life?

when fresh high school, went Germany lived 2 half years. Even without speed limits, usually drove around 130kph(which around 80mph?). course, probably old VW Golf fast enough.

At time, realize serious was. remember trooper asking make sure showed court. young dumb, sink next day. Even worse, consider bringing attorney. showed court figured would pay hefty fine way.

Fortunately, 5 merit points never traffic violations. judge imposed $300 fine plus $100 court costs. paid clerk. 

That end story. already mention young **and** dumb?  traffic conviction followed 11 years.  DMV rules allow removal 11 years 1 month.  time, unable get decent job.  Employers running background checks could see reckless driving charge.  :( ...are aware kind monitoring required someone anesthesia? It‚Äôs exactly benign procedure.

And many people US think masks ask. *facepalm*

This meant even justify reconvening group discuss declaring emergency 29th even Chinas government previous continuing lying obstruction meant certain agreed. Finally declared emergency 30th. then, Italy already gotten well way eventual collapse.  
Again, seem imply find Trump crews response anything contemptible.

If STEMI, want open heart surgery field hospital? Or, want certified cardiac center, even stop ED, go right cath lab see bad are. right operating room, highly trained doctors, nurses anesthesiologists spend entire lives preparing save life, minutes? 
Do want go dedicated cardiac unit, nurses work daily know help rehab, prevent post surgical infections, know exactly titrate drip, work code again, want field hospital, staff best, actually specialize need? 


There simple answer this, whole, totally ignoring ramifications suggest. average flu season kills around 37,000 - covid killed 140,000. suck. rhymes schmeath schmanel Asthma sufferors usually breathe better mask without since blocks things brings attacks.

Locking would slow it, enough break like Italy had... unless it‚Äôs enforced. National guard. Cellphone location surveillance. Hefty fines. 

Otherwise, we‚Äôre better enforced mandatory masks, etc locking towns X percentage cases. Then, rest state &amp; country provide support. 

I also think it‚Äôs unfair whether someone gets chance live die based solely age comorbidities. 62yo diabetic contracted covid one trip doctor grocery shopping working wearing mask. Otherwise, stays home. 22yo caught covid huge block party? fair non-compliant person gets hospital bed? 22yo asthmatic diabetic compliant, 35yo no-comorbidities caught covid bar hopping?

Is likable now?  NYC right grim months. mean, can‚Äôt assume everyone still hates hitler anymore. locales at? people know want people vacationing pandemic. (And places tourists go, locals tend avoid. Maybe went places traditionally lot masking involved?)

I comment - food shelf, volunteers patrons maintain strict pick up/set procedures masking distancing. (And volunteers wear gloves hand wash before.) Libraries also intense conservative. strike touristy spots though.

Church Street sounds like nightmare right - since March, went hiking month ago, narrow trails make almost impossible maintain distance unless go early. College kids clearly taking seriously - masks - rich older trust funders pretty much thought whole thing lark - hiking quickly checked list - especially popular spots.

Honestly, I'm surprised even vacationed anywhere, esp state. 


 
Edit: I'd curious know demographic age wise people saw without masks. influx college kids refused quarantine intense. There's LOT people coming back grad/undergrad degrees simply care. mean they'll enforce it. curbside pickup McDonald's app errored told go pick up. There's sign door says masks required indoor customer mask on. went drivethrough elderly lady taking money mask on. coughed sort towards elbow actually air. (Haven't seen around lately. Hmm.)

I went Wendy's today carry-out means going in. sign saying masks required. course customers sitting eating masks on. That's expected probably going (even mask on). also customer walking around without mask. Behind counter, employees masks one saw nose uncovered anyway.

I‚Äôm NY I‚Äôve good job much since March. far know haven‚Äôt virus (antibody test confirmed months ago.) Still, there‚Äôs way I‚Äôm going visiting parents (in 70s,) time soon. don‚Äôt want pass virus around. Plus, they‚Äôre another state, think complicates things more. microchip computer two different things. use, computer needs power, processing capability, memory, sensor input device kind get data want, output kind send data. 9nm chip referencing single memory chip, useful way own. M3 mention later smallest computer world small enough injected syringe, much less invisible naked eye.

Even basic tracking purposes, going simple possibly get, RFID tags placed skin small enough hide fluid, need large needle, tool looks nothing like syringe see exactly going you. top that, reader needs close range pretty much requires physical contact, know think government tracking without knowledge.

It's simply technologically possible conspiracy theory true. wish was. technology would allow also allows kinds things. could probably cure cancer tomorrow kinds microscopic computers. really wish right, simply not, technological level would take this. Stock Markets longer reflect economic realities since Great Decoupling mid 2000s. Army helping state case needs quickly build surge capacity hospitals Covid-19 cases continue rise, seeking contractors build temporary facilities 10 days notice. state doesn‚Äôt know many facilities needed where, officials want get idea quickly could build surge hospital capacity, case, according notice.

Hey, fucking hospital worker ICU waiting list.

They know. state knows.

It's ridiculous think otherwise.

Also, know this. sure working hospitals???? Facts prove what? Shaming works? think people prefer think worst. Boris clearly bright guy. couple years ago almost moved apartment fourth story. decided people told us elevator sometimes didn‚Äôt work, wouldn‚Äôt able take elderly dog elevator reliably. 

Funny random life is. one fact kept us elevators. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Yeah, can't find mention status anywhere either. 3 weeks... seem like went hospital funsies lollipop. twitter feed totally ""lalalal nothing happening nothing see here!!!"". anyone looking way convince anti-vaxxer reads romance novels life, read book might work. book ""On Ocean Boulevard"" Mary Alice Monroe. overwhelmingly vaccines, child ill measles subplot. make vaccine case different way, illustrating ill child get measles. assumes people vote retarded. know trump elected example

You know answer right there. I'm facetious. Although literally 100% retarded, voted uneducated, racist, mouth-breathing, brain-washed type. Sounds like kind Friday night! Couldnt agree more. hard breaks heart might harm relationships this. I'm gonna put child risk sake peace. sucks even see there's even risk all. July 4th? üëçüëèüëèüëè speak facts!!! Makes sense tbh since already knows scary virus is. lead horse water, cannot make drink.

I‚Äôll dig around way back machine. literally said ‚Äúto provide digital ID everyone born 2030 immunization ‚Äú kept talking people I‚Äôd prone poverty Im ok this. (If wears mask face too). Something I've struggling lately, relation covid vaccine, this. seem two extremes, middle ground. remain quarantined (work remote) decide get later date feel confident it, anti vaxxer now? 

...venting based real life convos. Yep, based current trends could vacinate 50% 20 30 year olds cut total infections half. Except due position constantly getting tested along people around unlike general public whose access tests limited

You reaching argument gave several worse examples people spreading virus, accept meme misleading think teenagers left home alone day going partying (or worse)? cells buddy Remember Swine Flu outbreaks/scares? would thought death sentence going school school. 

How went fear giving barely fucks COVID-19 ass backwards. Uh, no.

McConnell controls goes onto Senate floor.

You‚Äôre mad shit getting passed? Look asshole. Two negative tests symptoms.  Village highest STI rate per capita US. It‚Äôs social community US residents looking travel, World Nomads never stopped offering coverage. pandemic, travel advisory exclusion explicitly cover quarantines. covid covid includes trip cancellation, trip continuation, medical illness. policy fairly plain language questions. price coverage actually went _down_ well.

More info Make sure select US resident coverage available residents countries currently. actually
Sounds pretty fun. course pandemic. wealthy community? Super duper* oxygen possible got covid-19 embarrassment tried fight home alone. there's vaccine, get lasting immunity, several years garbage economy pray virus probably mutates obscurity like 1918 influenza. Like buddy Trump? Yes. Here's latest case/death charts Clark County (Las Vegas), plus 7-day like cases spiked weeks ago deaths following suit. Amazing folks choose disregard this. Oxford others aiming fall approval?

And think people misguidly thinking won‚Äôt vaccine available everyone local CVS. health care workers risk vaccinated fall see people returning pretty much normal. improve public health? refuse leave. Honestly. leverage anyway. one immunity covid19, 30 year old better chance newborn. Another reason anyone matter old strong protecting themselves.

My point right everyone needs protection. thats 100% accurate, babies born passive immunity mothers lasts weeks months longer drinking breast milk. work health sciences. studied human a+p years. first year life need get breast milk, one immunity covid. new virus ages risk statistically people age 60 dying higher rates. agree, it‚Äôs something probably want avoid quarantine avoid potential outbreak. 

Whole team goes doesn‚Äôt affect specific team. records aren‚Äôt even, games need made etc etc. it‚Äôs snowball effect. 

That said. Soto last night today good start baseball December/January likely baby boom, surprised February-May depression births almost cancels effect out. Lots relationships fallen apart this, there's ton people simply good match stuck together day long made clear month two. also seeing lot new relationships forming lockdowns. knew It‚Äôs already pointed out, Donaldo compares Donald nephews school sent questionnaire parents felt certain school restrictions. 

**70%** parents responded **won‚Äôt** send kids school masks mandated. 

I truly don‚Äôt understand it. IT.IS.SO.HARD. Back spring, able take care school stuff (Kindergarten, also extremely organized, honors 7th grader needed lot guidance getting used distance learning) morning. got 5AM add older one's assignments Google Calendar, create Google Tasks. taught well, take management that. Plus great organizational skill have.

At around 7AM, woke got fed. started school stuff breakfast. then-Kindergartener able independent all, literally sitting computer full-time. finished around 11:30AM, point made lunch entire family (my husband working home full-time well, would occasionally help older one Math, possess particular skillset). would start workday eating lunch work 5PM I'd stop make dinner. ate dinner outside play time around 8PM, I'd put 6 year old bed. bed, I'd work rest day sitting couch husband watched TV. able schedule meetings hours 1PM-5PM, thankfully. possible husband, meetings pretty much entire day. refused let COVID-19 get way enjoyment ‚Äì even pandemic changed tourist town love.  much fun,"" JaNeen said.  shows shuttered, half casinos closed, there's always someone telling put mask on. 

They‚Äôre much concerned dead town told wear mask 145,000 actually dead country alone. rapid testing read likly silver bullet this. Even though less accurate, time factor huge. changing topic man I‚Äôm talking said wouldn‚Äôt vaccine approved next year 99% false. can‚Äôt declaratively say something like Yea elderly aloud vote Anyone estimate R0 Florida right now? Slightly 1? die covid pretty stupid question know POC stands person color, BI stand for? wish could go back 2016, elect nice competent lady listened scientists. really say, ‚ÄúA broken clock right twice day.‚Äù  still two negative tests return active roster though? Re-post. literally backup plan. Schools open many parts world months now, enough sample size us derive conclusions from.  .0001% entire world population (600K COVID deaths vs. 7.8 Billion total world population) died COVID.

So 2.7% infected COVID died.  people exaggerating infection mortality rate (IFR) creating ""solutions"" based paranoia factual science. 

As morality rate even worst part virus. also highly contagious there's preexisting immunity, spreads fast infects huge numbers people once. Ever hear phrase, ""a small percentage big number still big number?""

That's mention potentially lifelong complications leaves behind kill.

The fact focused much existing damage done looking ahead damage come shows either ignorance dishonesty part. Either way, spreading misinformation. don‚Äôt know people think Gates Pandemic. Bezos one making billions it. would assume vast majority anti-Vaxxers voted him, voted üéâ lmao Like rich buddies ever wait hospital bed. world pricks got virus, thing they‚Äôd given cot revolver 1 bullet could decide go. world isn‚Äôt just, they‚Äôll get best medical care planet need it. Albetan here. unaware situation im sure interpret compared rest canada. bad something? sure would agree fed money wasted. money used buy assets gov't still has... however investing money best negligible returns.

The $2tn Cares Act portion already wasted... spent avoid situation find today. unfortunately, really argument stay home order.

we fragile place. despite massive amount money thrown around (by way, throughout trump's admin), US still effectively zero cost borrowing. little sign fragility that.

I'm far concerned economic impact letting thing rip. involve quick recover decimate sectors beyond gov't money back-fill. wrong? feel like broken record point would absolutely awesome vaccinate everyone vulnerable health care workers fall. I‚Äôd feel safe least small gatherings point need dick. news reports I've read, they've gotten pretty good social distancing, extent despite shutting economy, experiencing demand slump similar countries lockdowns. fair, events work highly qualified individuals/crews. would require every single asshat country least brain cells, apparently much ask. Bullshit. trump crony through. She'd rather million Americans die contradict orange head approved yet? No. üìà Good

üìâ Bad

üôà That's part people get. mom used say ""some people believe shit stinks they're nose deep it"". true saying sadly. Gargamel, smurfs figurative minorities articles I‚Äôve read, many hours games low educational quality video typical unsupervised screen time problem? actual screen time causing cognitive / attention issues?

I don‚Äôt think studies done show kids exposed high quality educational content fare worse didn‚Äôt get education all. agree statement schools don‚Äôt coherent plan, take issue implication 4 hours (hopefully, quality) screen time detrimental children given options have. Huh.  many lives stake much damage economy get released earlier think. US 1000 lives lost probably 10s millions dollars lost economy every day drags on. yes, usually FDA takes 6 months approve, going shortcutted. say shortcutted mean probably submit paper typically sits unread waiting everyone able get together meeting two weeks one doctors vacation.

Normalcy regardless cost. think sports starting wasting thousands tests daily athletes? they‚Äôre boomer age: [‚ÄúIntruder ‚ÄúStop Humanoid‚Äù Berzerk voice might amusing mix up. Also, made comment information school district employees contracted virus. teachers classroom. get contracted? infect other? wearing masks? go church? info, just- ""school district employees get COVID-19."" vote away fools. FUCK. Apparently, death contagious Reddit comments. Thanks, died. Thank youüòò, need hear sometimes bullshit. school open one gonna stop parties  Idk think people actually principles, def exception rule unfortunately Yeah I'm pretty sure Maine NH already ""14 day quarantine negative COVID test within 72 hours"" policy place. That's higher every neighboring country reason. 

Keep sucking Sweden though  don‚Äôt get anti-mask folks. 

They want ‚Äúgo back normal‚Äù refuse bare minimum would help get there. 

Wear damn mask. It‚Äôs simple clearly helps prevent spread. speak ill dead, say obituary well written. friend mine LA diagnosed early June. 29 great shape. Even helluva time (""sickest I've ever been"") couple weeks never hospitalized. officially cured signs virus.

But six weeks still struggling. Short breath, fatigue aches body. worried might long-term damage. 

I think people really underestimate virus. fake goldü•áü•á group make disease thats ridiculously illogical statement. takes two people germ theory true. Comparing Boris Trump severely underselling intelligence. There‚Äôs kinds self-awareness intelligence behind guy knows take advantage making punchline gives shit... can't read vaccine information unless fucking hospital specialized machine. fucking lock doors make drive thru only. need UBI til next spring. Nah demonstrating oligarchs charge give fuck you. Yet keep participating dog pony show. I'm white? I've never referred white whether Miami Gainesville Florida. Upon seeing everyone thinks type hispanic (most white people guess Mexican Puerto Rican). White typically means European descent (which have) also African, Asian, Arab, Native American ancestry (like Cubans) would choose identify one part myself? interesting see declare white without ever even laid eyes me. mix proud, ever identify white partially true. Also truth denying? Hispanics white eyes white people, point completely missed it. Maybe Cubans white family), majority country, white, brown. I've kicked places looked like dog color skin (not Miami). tell I'm white, white people certainly treat like am. (Not implying whites racist, saying racist ones definitely treat like I'm white, 95% whites I've encountered treated perfectly fine). use word white Miami means Jack shit that's rest country uses it. tell Im ""plugged in"" Cuban diaspora everyone thinks born Island heavy Cuban accent Spanish, speak cubanisms daily, live espresso, I've lived Hialeah (North Cuba) entire life (25+ years). happened empathy posted threads piggish, bigoted vet? None made post.

RIP children. Oh, alright.

I'm really sure relate word ""idiot"" ""low IQ"", thats fine. think I'm idiot. That's cool. think least reasonably intelligent, disagree. I'm aware know well enough assess enough call idiot anything, I'm emotionally invested Reddit posts enough try hurt feelings. 

And.... ""privileged"" kind lost meaning days. I'm going participate race bottom trying keep score privilege points, thats completely okay. wonder, though, kicks, town idiots, make us ""less privileged""? again, think whole concept privilege used days used label people. think everyone America among privileged people planet. 

""Conspiracy"" really mean anything days either. term used label viewpoint ""wrong"" viewpoint. Conspiracies happen always happened. word even dirty word way used today. Cesar assassinated. conspiracy? whole ""Trump-Russian Collusion"" ""conspiracy theory"" whether true not? really depends person's worldview shaped young age, guess, definition word ""conspiracy"" mean ""not true"". even little bit. insight, appreciate feeling sorry town, pretty well. community pretty close get along. us wear masks, don't, nobody calls idiot gets angry. day, borrowed neighbor's goat clear brambles poison ivy woods. consider privileged blessed lived good life. Finally mask order get behind... problem financial health suffers, health follows. Fucking Catch 22, man. Exactly. There's filter front face, requires work breathe out. much difference people adjust it, strenuous exercise wear quicker. Hope wrong, three time catastrophic. looking numbers, going right. shame. learned virus come collect. AZ isn‚Äôt listed There‚Äôs way tell level community spread places. don‚Äôt know sure. trying let person know that, places, school building empty, people work year. it‚Äôs really bad contact tracing pretty impossible. I‚Äôm sure teachers partying. teachers school employees know careful nervous going back. there‚Äôs always every crowd not. Johnson smart man playing idiot ride Trump like wave power. Trump actual idiot. could New Zealand

This completely impossible number different reasons. Jesus Christ, Halloween going shit show. 

Can imagine right wing nut jobs ‚Äúexpressing freedom‚Äù trick treat kids getting pissed people visibly home choosing open door. heard might vaccine fall, I‚Äôve also heard Fall 2021, it?

No one knows sure. Possibly early end 2020 Oxford vaccine, long take administer millions people anyone's guess (I'm guessing mid- late-2021). However, vaccines' efficacy expected 100%, likely require one dose, thereby possibly doubling (or, even tripling) demand.

Nevertheless, effective therapeutics, including antivirals like Remdesivir steroids dexamethasone promising significantly reduce mortality infected, way. effective therapeutics, things far less scary, even see vaccine mid- late-2021. bubble getting popped. It‚Äôs shutdown bill sense doesn‚Äôt forcefully shut nation. However includes extended direct payments citizens, necessary shutdowns. 

But bankroll shutdown that's I'm saying.

States cannot financially whether another lockdown. Congress needs financially fund lockdowns states. bill, fucking lockdown bill, Also, dems literally 0 ability force vote senate. Don‚Äôt know about. posting trash copypasta order get downvotes?

Dems literally go work time Repubs bring bills floor.

Literally.

You're attempting make legal argument using word literally incorrectly amazing dose rona-reality made IQ jump. live pretty reasonable state schools going open kids wearing masks instruction, breaks meals. 

I shocked bc that's like 90% day more. Right, original point makes sense. ""Hey, least we're peak death"" isnt exactly analogous virus control hospitalizations currently time high deaths incline. beans sell lol..

Boris switched saw public mood also stood personally gain it.

Boris always eye becoming PM saw May lame duck.

So struck deals, switch sides went. Yes, that's sorta I'm thinking well. Obviously testing 100% population, virus lot prevelant know.

Perhaps closing herd immunity realize? New York great example use well. Given densely populated city is, make sense cases spiked city lately. People less social distant month ago, cases still decline. Perhaps population built decent amount immunity, like said. guess imagined fall cases severe drop positive results. problem friends southern US states think everything covid19 hoax fake news. case counts, death rate, severity etc. think it‚Äôs political end November. lockdown again. think mask don‚Äôt work want schools reopen. 

I don‚Äôt see change covid19 affects personally getting someone close them. Sadly time would support lockdowns, hand. I‚Äôll pass. wait Time get good butt sit. Much country took attitude President did, meaning many states cities villages decided either bad worst already passed. going disappear one day, like miracle! 

I want make fun people, even President. horror movie shit think people possess capability come terms it. need much strict withstand order get this. Hopefully people starting realize that. see happening, year long time stuff change better... worse. dumbest comment I‚Äôve read while. Everyone conservative knows best.
Robert anyone criminals take responsibility killing people? actions veteran contribute consequences people die guns? punish law abiding citizens like actions criminals? Criminals definition break law care gun laws, criminals always going find ways kill people, without guns.

But agree maskholes refuse bare minimum protect community wear mask. selfish see actions serious consequences. Ohhh scary! 8 bits information, specifically whether vaccinated! horror! neighbor got back Disney. Waiting hear coughing. openly? ""following autopsy"" part headline really hit hard, yikes. forced compliance mask. think common sense compel people it. 
A good study came recently basically states well provides little protection greatly reduces severity Covid. 
People turn Covid Kill. Mostly likely won‚Äôt kill you. mortality rate low. 
What likely given possibly permanent disabilities stoke, lung damage, heart attack, etc. 
Common sense say, want reduce symptoms catch Covid He'll use vaccine make untold billions dollars Fauci also 79 years old...the prime high risk demographic. wouldn‚Äôt recommend dining either. healthy 20-something, hand, risk dramatically lower. Birx Trump stooge, unlike Fauci However, I'm antivaxxer, take vaccine long sufficient transparency vaccine works tests gone through.

That's actually accurate comparison read yet. last form responsibility. shouldnt people able make decisions Hmm, seeing Trump three months behind wearing mask, let's assume takes another three months make decision. brings us mid-October.

(All them)   know I've read Trump's mind.

We develop shrinking ray inject Marines infected take virus hand-to-hand combat. America, Fuck Yeah! awarded grades depending average percentage grade across exams. 70%+ first, 60-70% 2:1, 50-60% 2:2, 40-50% third 40 fail. 

I'm simplifying Oxbridge grades really awarded basis curve.

Generally employers use things screening ask grades 2:1 higher. #StayTheFuckHome one particular statement might true rest actions exactly line safety ""We longer ask people stay home, we‚Äôre trying get back much closer normal, ability dispense social distancing measures depend continued ability drive said: ‚ÄúI think rely massive common sense British people far delivered results we‚Äôve seen, that‚Äôs going work.‚Äù

Relying ""common sense"" ""no longer asking people stay home"" sake trying get everything ""back normal"" way we're going things right now. plenty kinds idiots here, unfortunately. big round applause Governor Rona DeathSentence getting numbers quickly.

Soon they'll overtake New York California cases US. Exactly. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going hope way us safely weddings next year! That's called presumed positive. reported positives confirmed positive (from test)

Presumed positive close contact people (such living house) likely want waste test. already week long backlog, want minimal number people testing. Pathetic. Find mask fits, stop ass. could make national center job would prevent pandemics I've realized reason can't notice *problem* examples literally know history. #winning Yep, economy Florida gonna get even worse virus running rampant nukes alone thing keeping us shooting war China. They're like nails big stick

Not mention logistical delivery systems, like submarines, planes launched aircraft carriers, missile bases etc agree hero worship. time criticize taking long (a matter days) making terrible decisions nursing home patients, also think important congratulate changing course really seeing NY first wave completely. Cuomo's mistakes - devastating, realize - took place short period time still know much virus. back washing hands emphasized masks not.

The mistakes governors California, Florida, Georgia, Arizona hopefully end costing far fewer lives. they're unforgivable mind governors known *exactly* needs done months, months prepare, months learn Cuomo's successes mistakes. No, called wrong making huge mistake.

It's called making one call countries Asia made opposite call. deaths entire continent Asia.

It's called making call tell people wear masks, despite little evidence showing masks work. So, words, THINGS would help lockdown, lockdown bill.

Yes, know, that's I've saying. people realize die virus, instead virus causes complications result death. Covid known attack organs, lungs. 

 Another less graceful kind way put this: people fucking idiots. wearing dong.  Wrong, media blame millennials caring another country hurting billionaires ""who make jobs"" Maybe believe we‚Äôll effective vaccine year‚Äôs end that‚Äôs assumption I‚Äôm skeptical about. saying happen get vaccine covid-19? sounds like saying every person world get it, till forever. maybe get multiple times resistance temporary.

I believe happen. herd immunity make harder harder disease spread. hear lockdowns work?

In case purposefully inflammatory, recent evidence that's half dozen countries I'm assuming referencing (below). state 90% Americans say wearing masks. also says Americans say see half people wearing mask Funnily enough can't turn lights


www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-bannon-conway-meetings-light-switch-darkness-a7565136.html much winning magaland Oh hey, throwaway account keeps spreading anti masker crap anti protest stuff. WAY, expect see today. /s running president. I'd vote American might help. Quoted article, *"" know two doctors saved lives hundreds patients medications, fighting state medical boards save licenses reputations. ""*

When scientist saying early biased.

Best case scenario works lower mortality 5% relative group receive treatment (control) ""high risk"" group he's talking 20% overall mortality rate treatment group would 19% overall mortality. order doctors ""*saved lives hundreds patients medications""* would prescribe Thousands (approx 20000 minimum) patients specific high risk category.

This simple tin foil hat 5G, rigorous science either (as presented). may right, may benefit. study warranted. coming Yale, expect credible, science data needs speak itself. far yet make compelling case. talk Trump like that, friends. like pour vape juice fuel car vape. What's actual research t-cell immunity covid 19? I've seen immunity anti-body responses Guess found something he‚Äôs Yeah essentially useless compare US general basis wiling Europe seeing geographically similar size extremely diverse throughout communities. Anecdotally, East Tennessee, 95%+ wear masks places like grocery stores pharmacies. Roughly 50% wear gas stations liquor stores . nobody wears daycares (including teachers/workers). 

That last one.... Ugh.

Those places I've lately. Moving isn‚Äôt reasonable variety reasons. like people telling teachers like quit also isn‚Äôt reasonable. sure also working face shields. He‚Äôs slightly tolerant them, depending day. airlines don‚Äôt say whether would accept reasonable alternative. certainly good tolerate one other, totally agree. Hopefully airline won‚Äôt make policies rigid. agree need find way weed fake ADA card people. drives crazy. It‚Äôs exactly people hurting people real issues. Imagine kind person voted man so, sorry. perfectly justified eating hot pizza car! winking time saying it? Check mate reddit. Yup. one biggest less-immediate concerns pandemic: inevitable process wealthy using crisis gather even larger share nation's wealth themselves, American citizens lose jobs, businesses, savings (if any), homes. Economically, similar massive upward transfer wealth saw wake 2008 recession.

Wealth inequality already extraordinarily high country - richest already lion's share wealth - going go higher billionaires add hundreds billions dollars wealth millions Americans struggle pay bills feed families. PPP/extra UE running Congress seemingly unwilling extend help, wonder: breaking point?  nieces nephews home-schooled greats also home-schooled. went college, one PhD, seem ways work. Delusional cunt. way Anti-Masker:

The truth is, cause people major problems, specifically mental one. think logically: person worn mask life, suddenly situation forced way. Every human develops level Claustrophobia, evident first time sky divers. situation body used to, there's fear response, panic however mild is, causes reactions we've seeing.

We need stop making fun, help out. choose wear mask, unless requested reason, Help show okay. also helps me, still get claustrophobic response.

Get it? remember certain documentary called Fahrenheit 911 SAMs club sent email survey purchase used entire thing talk manager wearing mask nose. reason people wear masks incorrectly make even madder ones don‚Äôt wear one all. think ironic say lives matter protest way puts lives people trying protect jeopardy. I'm going need one study beleive claim protests propagate spread virus. March 2022 maybe. lot posters completely touch reality average American. places US virus control? places spiking ones didnt spike back April. deaths whole still decline since end April.  play basketball every day keep body good shape therefore virus able harm me.  could wrong, awareness anti-vaccine sentiments USA mostly clustered around affluent, white, ***left***\-leaning Americans (particularly Pacific Northwest). understanding least Trump came along; anti-intellectualism disdain expertise science certainly worked level anti-vax distribution across aisle political right, especially among working class, well.

Do anti-vax roots historically run right wing politics Britain? can't trust fauci thinks cuomo good job getting virus control, did... Alright. I'm US citizen actively rooting rest world ignore us. We're country madness.

So really think I'd get point I'd feel way. proof of, GuvnorOfficial, surprise you! dense? assume intellectually impaired way. I'm done you. Good luck life. seasonal summer lovin' blast. odds happening close stupid country becoming?


Which part can't happen? Someone school can't become super spreader? super spreader can't lead whole school quarantine? school can't see epidemic? teachers students can't die it?

This impossible isolated cases. school area people tend underlying conditions, obesity, mortality rate could trend average.

Hello folks. I've interested emerging evidence surrounding obesity's marker risk factor severe Covid-related illness. tried analysis mainstream media's coverage found interesting things. 

Hoping learn discussion whether initial media bias playing link harm good. 

Would love know opinions.

My Motherfuckers. also live area. Can‚Äôt stand them. Someone posted video FB packed members community got panties bunch viewed ‚Äúsnitching‚Äù ‚Äúbeing Karen‚Äù. Even owner chimed in...man, massive piece shit is. 

What I‚Äôm trying say is...Fuck Hanover‚Äôs. really. Running 3.2mi twice week ballpark running 20mi one run. Well, repent yeah, whole idea salvation that, accept savior repent sins saved Thank you! article lot information digest context first notes read:

Context:

* professor critical since start used language ""active euthanasia"" taken news outlets across world (and subreddit) painted picture swedes intentionally killing elderies. time also nurses replied strongly accusations.
* FHM (Public Health authority issues recommendations pandemic) different Socialstyrelsen (Board Health Welfare, oversees care homes national level) authority different IVO (Health Social Care Inspectorate, investigates reports mistreatment hospital elderly care). Sweden elderly homes managed municipalities private companies, hospitals managed regions - two different administrative levels, also complicates coordination. long article posted back analysis situation created spring ;

Now article:

Seems professor estimates 1000 lives could saved patients received individual assessments (several municipalities reported general assessments made start pandemic places investigation IVO) nutrients/oxygen instead palliative care (also something government stated since done elderly homes allowed patients sent hospitals). estimate correct, mean bit 25% elderly deaths Sweden avoidable. also mean Sweden would still 4000 deaths Nordic neighbours.

P.S. Seems AutoMod deleted translation, try repost again. live complete lack energy. Go girl, give nothing. measures effective. Vietnam porous borders next door Cambodia disease exists. 

Most likely previous non-serious Coronavirus infections Vietnam (perhaps endemic) provide herd immunity. interesting neanderthal gene variety responsible heightened susceptibility almost wholly absent among Vietnamese (but Cambodians).  suggest earlier Coronavirus gene sweep population - speculation point . ‚ÄúHey I‚Äôm lockdown, may well shorten life expectancy.‚Äù We‚Äôre sorry you‚Äôre disappointed

Hopefully next pandemic lives expectations course are. less affluent still well going try hiring teachers table create ""mini schools"" kids. True Pundit? Get outta crap one year now. clear. can‚Äôt predict one month future. let‚Äôs believe predict one year future? That‚Äôs America works sadly. People double behavior America matter what. whilst deliver justice feel good it, deepen divide.

Take American lived nearly 2 years abroad. see everyone children bickering. Doesn‚Äôt matter who‚Äôs right wrong, divide deepens. true goal get everyone wear masks, way America. Shaming definitely works countries America. seen anything ages, 14 day quarantine visitors plus anyone contact confirmed case great, putting quarantine centers even better. 

where states live small town state rarely makes national news, covid positive teenager visited mom work, employers multiple tests stay open without requiring employees tested, schools told 30 kids class crammed like sardines, one positive mean everyone quarantine, ones sitting him. 

rip us Actually choice buying car getting healthcare. people can't afford both. That's ignore illnesses. also battling disease ravages body.

RIP. It‚Äôs good skeptical, sometimes crazy stuff happens. know tour bus driver Alaska asked got job, told kid ignore everyone tells life, follow dreams. end ride, father reveals he‚Äôs astronaut flew space shuttle (this back still flew).

After trip, bus, driver overhears father say son, ‚ÄúYou dream driving bus, dream driving shuttle‚Äù. 

The bus driver shares funny story friends, one happens cousin connected astronaut program, funny story bus driver overhearing astronaut‚Äôs advice son gets back astronaut. finally bus driver learns story got back astronaut, completing circle. Fecal matter actually incredibly good transmitting covid.  hyperbolic.

I dislike either option, really. include false negatives calculations? true infection rate could significantly higher. admissions hospital. understand sometimes hospitals reluctant take admissions care homes due expected surge younger less frail patients could withstand covid-19-treatment. elderly frail care homes generally frail often one two infections away death per se lesser chance withstand live really tough covid-19-treatments hospital.

But given medicaly needed oxygen treatments breathing exercises ample coughing treatments cough medications intravenous Vitamin C-treatment instead easy prescribed palliativ care.

The hopefully drastic necessary changes care home nursing facilities coming autumn. changes like see doctor visits see patients person often twice year enough job security hourly staff enough PPE:s staff patients. UV-sanitization forms sanitizers enough oxygen care test patients coronavirus health status therby minerals vitamins give patients supplements help that.

At time, Danish tourists Spanish region encouraged tested return.

Danish tourists avoid traveling popular tourist destinations Sunny Beach Golden Sands.

In Ministry Foreign Affairs' updated travel guide, takes account latest infection rates EU United Kingdom, Bulgaria gone yellow orange . means unnecessary travel discouraged.

If already staying Bulgaria, stay holiday over. However, Foreign Ministry calls Danes Bulgaria pay special attention travel advice corona pandemic.
The new travel guide also includes one advice Danes visiting Spanish region Arag√≥n. rising infection rates, people get tested get home. However, travel guide Spain general remains yellow, thus encouraging travelers extra careful.

With Bulgaria orange category, unnecessary travel Bulgaria, Luxembourg, Portugal Sweden discouraged due infection rates. addition, unnecessary travel Ireland discouraged due country's quarantine rules.

#Now travel 12 regions Sweden
In return, opens regions Sweden. applies J√§mtland H√§rjedalen, S√∂rmland, Uppsala, √ñrebro, √ñsterg√∂tland. addition, regions Blekinge, Kronoberg, Halland, V√§sterbotten, Kalmar, V√§rmland Sk√•ne remain open travel.

However, unnecessary travel regions Sweden still discouraged Sweden whole meet criteria low infection rates model travel guides EU Schengen countries.
The Ministry Foreign Affairs' travel guidelines updated weekly, local infection rates assessed. starting point, ministry's recommendation Danes travel countries less 30 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants per week
.
However, also affected local conditions. IDK else say. sound like someone trying defend allowed get planes without masks. Ohhhhh well good thing Unilever owns both! want uber-conglomorate hurt pandemic /s Yes, agree now.  think infection growth rate one want computing with... work retail 6 days week, year, every day I'm kinda scared I'm gonna get shot spat enforcing statewide regulations. mods reinstated post translation read it. Also, interested would make post repeats things actually stated previous one. heard, government announced almost one million public sector workers get above-inflation pay rise ""thank work coronavirus crisis"" 

Turns pay rise doctors, (fair enough) dentists, belive working lockdown teachers. (I know many may working step-mum primary school teacher still back work.)

No pay rise nurses, though. reason apparently nurses negotiated payrise 2 years ago something. 
After clapping carers bullshit, they've got nerve start hospital parking charges apply this. see people downvoting see lie Source backing that's cause? ass. 

I've never seen posed question. New Jersey at. roads better pretty much everywhere else I've been. grew south jersey-- 45 mins shore, 2 NYC, 30 mins Philly. public education also excellent, population smart following guidelines. dumbasses think wont get caught? Sounds like parts need lubricant? thought Mississippi city Alabama? mix people. people interact begging people stay home go wear damn mask really careful. We‚Äôre generally supportive local leadership keep trying put lockdown place governor shooting shit generally getting way local gov need do. 

Then assholes pretending nothing going on. personally don‚Äôt know people locally Twitter Facebook screenshots trending people bragging they‚Äôre wearing mask getting close people possible. machismo dude post shit like ‚Äúnada va passar guey‚Äù. think us need support local gov. takes assholes keep shit spreading though apparently enough those. large number things essential DC area seems work well. probably wasn‚Äôt necessary.

CA almost entirely lefties. NY: deaths, per capita. 

STFU. takes one irresponsible person.

i played college sports small team lower division. irresponsible people, guarantee larger teams bigger divisions them. good. Hopefully regions within Sweden this. It‚Äôs foolish rely antibody tests allow anything none really accuracy demonstrate sure someone disease not. FHM dipping baby toe ‚Äòimmunity passport‚Äô domain saying antibodies meet vulnerable groups playing fire point, encouraging see least areas Sweden think bad idea. Protests definitely propagated virus. friends got sick protesting. said, increase caused protests relatively small compared tsunami cases caused packed bars, restaurants, beaches, etc. Getting really tired people using disability excuse wear mask. really breathing issues, much higher risk dying covid husband lung cancer, see going public. ever wearing mask.i COPD, dont go public without mask either. wanna see hell got downvoted. really wanna see.  Antibodies found six months infection. That‚Äôs great news. #Translation: 

Two regions country [Sweden] want go broad antibody tests. Blekinge Kalmar. risk incorrect positive answers considered great.


- think absolutely want bring infection nursing homes, course. want go broad antibody testing public, says Andreas Delphin, works health care coordination Kalmar Region.


The fact people able meet loved ones nursing homes help positive antibody test creates problems certain regions. fewer people infected, greater margin error. Even antibody tests highest dot accuracy.


Now criticism several quarters government's efforts mass test antibodies. Bengt Wittesj√∂ works infection control doctor Blekinge Region believes purely dangerous areas low spread infection, Blekinge Region.


- danger lulled sense security would disease even though actually ill, therefore immune either. think pulled everyone ridge country. whole pandemic, said Stockholm applies throughout country, although completely different phase parts country.


The problem places low spread infection, risk individuals would harmed.


- would trust positive answer. see increase number cases contrary continues decrease, think difficult ever able rely confidently positive test receipt visit relatives, says Bengt Wittesj√∂. ain‚Äôt wrong wasn‚Äôt Civil War, civil war. Look definition civil war, smh reddit sometimes. Thanks Captain Obvious! socially acceptable (and encouraged) rant rave White Privilege, considered anti white racist, mention high percentage Jewish people positions power, it‚Äôs super racist bad?

Seems like insane double standard.

Assuming Mel Brooks hates Jews racist ranted power structures assuming someone complains White Privilege hates whites.. no? Lets definitely open schools put money resources celebrating people actually know, improve lives, might heading right direction.

remember politicians saying ""american NEEDS"" sports? america needs nurses, doctors, teachers, etc etc important note reported per day different death per day.  Fair enough, realise, although probably done, thread UK turned talking US. 


That's meant mostly joke way. get reluctance cancel season, wholeheartedly agree you. There‚Äôs way keep spreading. takes one irresponsible person. Mary 

Pretty sure idea doing.  


People wearing masks know doing. Good. people idiots.
&lt; AZ citizen  herd immunity which, despite stated goal part Swedish Public Health Agency, strongly linked Swedish corona strategy. 

One wonder might papers like Aftonbladet stop mentioning every given opportunity.

Friendly reminder: vaccination causes herd immunity - end goal *every* strategy. doooo!  We'll probably reach 100 percent infection lmao Right, I'm reject ""it happened Wuhan there's lab studies virii there"" theory things. I'm saying we've known 'coincidence' since January (at least) article really move needle much. I‚Äôm work let mine cure three days yesterday ripening real nicely. truly good/bad smell.

I sit germany eat popcorn. heartbreaking see happens US easy see today.

Nevermind stay safe wear mask, keep distance wash hands. Known deaths* cases extrapolated covid death.

At 50% accepted 1% death 22k missing death person. Well basically confirms living coronavirus rest time, become another staple virus live like mono herpes simplex.  talked article. Karen's Personally, make Swedish people taking virus recommendations unnecessary travel serious people reddit make look time. also middle holiday season people middle holidays traveling much work normal visits across border. Danish people lot holiday houses Sweden, travel mostly go there. reverse really true, many swedes going holidays. 

Edit (addition): summers might travel Denmark go rest Europe car holidays. year complicated friends planning foreigners-expats visit homelands. me, danger reopening schools there's widespread community spread seems less children dying, children spreading disease causing adults lives die.

Right seems like children die less, less affected general, COVID general flu. Maybe change active community, guess. studies I've seen make think adults risk kids.

I'm parent, though, luckily children worry about. Ayep  I've enough this. can't keep reading shit anymore. need lock fuck start over. could one us. Imagine carrying babies 9 months each. Going difficulties labor, investing time energy children. Constantly watching say dont want negatively impact them. Watching walk first time. Saying first ""I love you""s. Clapping happily squealing joy babies. Guiding grow adults. they're dead. new deaths preventable. DeSatan crew murderers. ""leaders"" done nothing protect us willing sacrifice lives families lives corporate machine line pockets. kids died could fill fucking coffers. need let know enough. more.

Chinese vaccine traditional cultured deactivated vaccine. US vaccine world's first human mRNA vaccine.

Moderna's research vaccine: vaccine platform. Oxford Chinese teams able produce traditional vaccine quickly building original SARS work. Moderna built new vaccine scratch couple weeks. also [theoretically] faster scale production mRNA vaccine.

You seem understand: Moderna's approach works, last pandemic. Ever.

The Chinese vaccine probably work, hard fuck immune responses use actual virus. probably even safe, although PRC would probably fudge study results dangerous. even dangerous, probably better virus.

But Moderna's vaccine shows stronger immune response, quicker develop, easier produce quickly large scale.

Of course PRC wants steal research. No, presume that‚Äôs rate death typical? That's pretty big oopsie Closing schools across country effective measure we've taken fight transmission.

It's reason children become major sources community transmission. also racist guess overlooked well. really talking society large. Absolutely everyone staying home never going happen, significant portion people morons. meant difficult avoid getting COVID. one making claims like microchips don‚Äôt exist lie? known cases. experts say spread asymptomatic might high 20x.

A places report day death, different problem: last week can't trusted. really need able view information ways.

All logic applies test results well. Fewer weekends, idea out-of-date result ""reported"" today actually unless access data numbers.

I point Colorado numbers compare here. Even CO, good graph deaths reported date, see graph compare graph day death, makes lot sense  Note there's big spike deaths April, another one May. one May deaths first spike April, tests count them.

Edit: clarity. Exactly. someone asthma huge reason wear mask, maybe even among population getting COVID severe (enough think mask inhibits oxygen) asthma would drastically affect them.

Then fight masks also ones think virus hoax and/or tamer flu can't really argue stupid. Considering 90% flu shot, guessing none. 

Once vaccine, guess none Covid moved 18. nothing respect parents. went worked years put self school. everyone stay parents years graduate. understand thought, get motion sickness little claustrophobia fly. psychologically need plane ASAP help settle nerves get cooler air calm stomach.

Otherwise, yes stand 10 minutes stand get quicker I‚Äôm happier. also tend reserve seats forward possible reason. stupid! Def LOST reference! always gets me. diagnosed ""breathing problem"" oxygen 24/7, yet wear mask. fit nasal canulas fine.

We wish could get mask it‚Äôs difficult. We‚Äôre hopeful though want proper thing (and also want avoid conflict criticism heaven forbid ever take public). Yeah, know, everywhere. least Germany teaches people history, good bad. Education general major difference.

I remember senior year high school, math level taught something German exchange student years ahead on. nice helpful, honestly embarrassing far behind comparatively. Psychology!!!!! mask makes people feel like can‚Äôt breathe (even though can). recycled air bad enough. don‚Äôt wanna breathing plus Covid particles air. time Gotta laugh cry. measures taken Sweden? least something required forever. sooner everyone gets board, sooner cases start dropping it'll go away. 

Once gone, go back wearing choose feel safe without one.

These people prolonging long COVID around, they're extending amount time us wear them, keep so. job top priority, health safety us - could care less ratings publicity stunts. liked whatever fits narrative. really disdain expertise. cultural, really related education. Education solve it. Lol.

jesus  serious? lol I've wearing mask months say can't run sustained period time it. Lighter exercises like brisk walks fine, full running realistic. Yes reducing oxygen intake, way dangerous anyone lungs. wedding presume? I‚Äôm opening shop Etsy! Every one moving toys. Yes, matters. scientists doctors think masks better preventing others contracting COVID-19 protecting mask wearer (unless properly wearing medical grade N95 mask, anyway). better protected around wear masks, even wear one, wear cloth face mask around don't. 

But definitely best everyone wears masks! together, like situation. roommate ronald, girlfriend Jessica living house since initial outbreak. Jessica went see parents July 1st father tested positive July 12th. Apparently feeling fine ‚Äústomachache ‚Äú. symptoms gotten worse since then.

July 1 - Jessica‚Äôs visits dad feels sick

July 5- Jessica mild symptoms (sore throat, light cough, stomach issues, fatigue) 

July 12 - Jessica Dad tests positive &amp; Jessica/Ronald get tested (No results back today)

July 16 - Jessica longer symptoms



I house since July 12th symptoms all. hoping come back weekend (July 25th) concerned Ronald may gotten Jessica could currently asymptomatic. Ronald Jessica stayed together house whole time. 

When safe go back house? Could potentially get ‚Äúpocket tests‚Äù go visit people know aren‚Äôt getting anyone sick? It‚Äôs like sub dedicated orange marmalade, one allowed talk oranges. Exactly! point US virus since ones spread far ""Bye Felicia""

There's brain-stuff going situations like this, I'm sure approach best one convince people mask up. Oh misread at. b! pick 3 think would recover best.

The problem people going shops standing near order food masks on. bueno.

Some shop owners say need mask, even providing them, person store without mask.

Then, there's teens renting motel rooms, going room room unmasked.

If get surge anytime soon, parties people incautious shore areas. I‚Äôm sick arguing people claim masks don‚Äôt work. Dealing people asking proof works, government can‚Äôt force people wear masks.

Here‚Äôs excerpt: 


Masks could mean getting less sick
And might quell outbreak. hypothesis among infectious disease experts infected wearing masks breathe lower dose virus, result often less severe illness. 

A forthcoming article Journal General Internal Medicine lays theory. 

It makes lot sense, said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, expert health policy Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School Public Health.

‚ÄúWearing mask may protect mask wearer realize,"" said. ""This paper provides new explanation lower rates death areas mask wearing common, well even stronger rationale us wear masks around others.""

The rationale based medical concept ""viral inoculum,"" much virus someone exposed to. evidence viral, bacterial fungal exposure affecting sick someone gets goes back 1930s. Yeah, Jan. 2022 lot sooner 15 years. Someone said toilet paper helps? Good It‚Äôs easy rude unfortunately wearing masks difficult lot people. work healthcare wear mask 8 hrs day. also chronic anxiety, severe anemia, work hot environment. Damn near blacked first time worked mask on. went home looked nurse forums mask tips. also upped iron dose used old panic attack tricks keep conscious wearing mask. Instead people taking jabs others maybe listen offer help. Uck, worse, beard smells horrendous end ten hour day wearing one... Bleh!  Wow... feel you. honestly major issue this. educating folks safe safe whatever going regardless. daughter mother right want crawl bounce house alone sit there. Start vacation/trip/whatever earlier? 

The difference really negligible. checking hotel maybe minutes half hour depending situation. really talking point. Good suffer asthma dealing something never understood (air hunger) now. I'm glad found hell actually happening me. mean guess don‚Äôt hold employees accountable they‚Äôre following company tells do. airline companies aren‚Äôt hidden hate people medical problems. It‚Äôs keep everybody safe possible. would individual medical problems can‚Äôt wear mask even risk going time? virus lethal pre existing medical problems older people. Thanks, add states numbers. leadership fucked politics propaganda cause, people blindly following them. best medics work actually older.. wealth experience dealt wide variety calls. 50+ guys who've job 20-35 years know they're doing, found way last tough career. okay let clean plates. wont starve.

I can't think reason ""clean plate"" would even thing except generation grew dire nationwide poverty famine entered adulthood growing excess.

‚ÄúWhy illegal? someone wants risk life drive drunk don‚Äôt let them?

Drunk driving illegal risk puts toward PEOPLE. could give two shits want drink death home, get behind car decision puts everyone else road risk

Why people wear masks...‚Äù modern food industry (beginning roughly WWII) many Americans still lived farm rural area, steadily declined throughout 20th century. Barring psychosocial / trauma associations, surely anyone physical condition wearing mask would contraindicated far vigorous general population leaving home? Like someone kind vulnerability, they'd extraordinary risk contract corona virus. surely leaving house circumstances agressively avoiding anyone left house. breath stinks dispite good hygiene, get checked out. thank people wearing pants? pantsless man walking around public you‚Äôd annoyed right? Well go people wearing pants say hey thanks wearing pants. fucking dunce. No, I'm not, governor governor issue lock orders, mask orders, governor lift said orders can't get irony wearing mask think reduces freedoms, spread virus caused people wearing masks something genuinely limits freedom go places things. know America isn‚Äôt perfect country. neither countries. post absolutely nothing US, people try bring ‚ÄúAmerica bad‚Äù circlejerk conversation karma whores.

But knowing like 80% agree mask mandate amazing, genuinely makes hopeful country first time while. one thinks denying make conspiracy even prevalent? think Florida particularly stupid state like person responding does? Nah. like they've done much dispel notion past couple months non-existent covid response. lack leadership play role here? Sure. point, anyone wearing mask governor telling need wear one (after already watched new York get absolutely overrun covid cases) absolute moron. 

But think pretty clear ""stupid"" state state that's filled stupid people. stupid people, I'm guessing mean people average intelligence and/or education. think ridiculous try pretend there's tangible differences intelligence across state lines. One look high school test scores shows pronounced difference be.  doesn‚Äôt seem evidence people actually reinfected. less hand full reports singular patients afaik months old.

Sad times.  actually, documented flu deaths lower posted online. project deaths. means covid deaths much higher 140,000... can't stock 2-3 weeks worth food moron.  course not. Even entertaining audacious position trying answer logically, futile. know it‚Äôs load horse sh!t lie there‚Äôs magical medical reason might qualify throw around words like HIIPA, ADA, medical privacy. Amused ‚Äúingeniosity‚Äù picking little medical legalese feel would add weight fictitious self-importance standing assholery. getting destination, getting plane damn airport. send three best recovery chances home?

Just asking. medical professional. places choose idiot civilian, airplane really bottom list. It‚Äôs 10 days last symptom... there‚Äôs that... could made whole 26.1 miles mark satan mouth hole! Newsmax? thanks. this, make year behind life. She'll graduate high school, college, start career, move house, reach many milestones year later. homeschool her, probably better prepared academically first grade. Kids resilient social skills survive year homeschooling. definitely politicians scientists end social distancing restrictions. it? Depends lot factors:

Elections foreseeable future, restriction fatigue population, improvements regarding medication, threatments tests et cetera.

My educated guess: Roughly timeframe April-Oktober 21. Buy use pulse oximeter. save life. oxygen level falls go damn hospital matter what.

Edit: btw saved life visiting family member non-covid situation. began feel unusually weak put pulse went 60 140 back down. arrhythmia turns heart reset hospital overnight.. Wait! Ben n Jerry sold Unilever??? run 5k every Saturday. Last Saturday hit 103 live. fuckin hot iPhone stopped working mid run (no music.. ugh) wore mask. I‚Äôve gotten quite acclimated running mask months. gets pulled water point - often. bad. 10% pff freedom /s ""airborne virus"" can't understand? like parent telling little kid monster closet can‚Äôt sell anymore. Bad bot. call way wearing mask 'vulture style' since reminds vulture's beak sticking it. Yep. win choosing nutrient-dense foods fill yourself! Infectious pun definitely politicians scientists end crisis restrictions. it? Depends lot factors. Elections foreseeable future, restriction fatigue population, improvements regarding medication, threatments tests et cetera.

My educated guess: Roughly timeframe April-Oktober 21. sounds like someone exempt still wear one. Kudos woman! ? get people say lot percentage wise. talking decline revenue, talking human lives many cases died refused follow advice science around them.

Each life lost someone people cared them. wife, husband, father, mother, grandparents, children, grand children pets. 

When think loss life 500,000 think millions hurt emotionally. think contribution people within community more. 

I confess numbers counters desensitize fact dealing life. need take minute everyday think human side this. scientific authority. love authority holds state sanctioned monopoly violence. Good luck getting hit say like desperately want true, fear not. One avoid reinfection careful properly employing PPE way would useless alternative - chronic infection immune system fails clear - true... Man got self conscious taking 2 second drink Gatorade bottle plane lol Cant buy one biker masks cover neck?

EDIT: something like Shut stores 7pm might actually see recovery. 

We're going COVID us 2022 rate.  feel like people wearing masks going wear masks they're assholes. think fact oxygen levels going change minds. Yes, wearing mask annoying public, protect others. decent human being, assholes going asshole. ones going believe story  link "" unclear underlying conditions. ""

It better discuss information, really want know details. whole subreddit praises behavior calles MaliciousCompliance Oh, thank God. piece shit president.

...and yet..... Doesn‚Äôt matter situation. I‚Äôd like know say too. always say ‚Äúnearly‚Äù ‚Äúunless otherwise indicated doctor‚Äù. case, medically, would great could. doesn‚Äôt make possible keep mask. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs hard understand. Everything dollar, except Coronavirus. That's free! Till get hospital bill. Remember ‚Äúdeep cleaning‚Äù corporate America proudly announcing part reopening push? Much ado nothing, HVAC system remained like masks interfering customer experience. Genuinely curious medical reasons wearing mask. imagine things like COPD even skin conditions would can't many, surely? expensive ones ok, cheap ones really reduce oxygen supply.

I think case, [NYC autopsy detect viral RNA cerebrospinal fluid. 

I suspect hide many places infect cells. Inflammation one symptoms frequently persists among people whose symptoms linger. possible cause lingering information may tissue containing clusters zombie cells stiched together filopedia.

I think way virus observed restructure lungs (no studies published far, disturbing comments physicians front lines) explained filopedia infection. probable cause cytokine storms observed patients - immune system goes apeshit antibody response slows infection instead ending it.

See disagreement have. I've seen nothing suggest can't wear mask, simply want to. valid let kids 2 plane take vacation, kid get go doctor.

I disagree, logical comparison me. Option A: Patient X lives Patient dies certainty.

Option B: patient 51% chance survival.

Which one choose? Option B high variance theoretically saves lives. Government blocking testing contact tracing budget, CDC cut out, yet state, one rural, breaking new case records every day. hitting plateau much people control government willing sacrifice profits.

If disagree, would suggest article explains such. possible problems exist, I've seen nothing suggesting is, yet. Lack evidence prove opposite though, could happen! Yeah. Good luck that... people coming don‚Äôt-give-a-fucks. medical reasons ""not wear mask"". mask - ride. us enemies.

You allow states good policy place proceed caution. strict measures allow limited slow reopening. keep contained track record let proceed. Mandate masks nation wide make examples people.

Someone told ""there valid reasons opt wearing mask, like autism claustrophobia.""

\- Percentage world population affected ASD: approximately 1%

\- Percentage world population affected claustrophobia: approximately 5-7%

This account mask-less assholes see literally everywhere. instance, I'm pretty sure 60% apartment building's residents autistic and/or claustrophobic (60% seem wearing masks).

Wear fucking mask. can't wear mask due legitimate medical reasons, much anyway. everyone else *should* wearing protect first place. Also, protect you. know else dehumanizing?

Totally different line work work retail management telling us enforce mask rule due safety concerns. also told circumstances allowed remove anyone store prevent entering. mom works different retail store, management telling they're even allowed ask customer without mask put one unless another customer complains.

They worried people becoming belligerent violent wear mask due fact full grown adults meltdowns public becoming verbally physically aggressive workers trying enforce mask rules. want avoid putting us situation might put danger want us make physical contact customers. Supposedly, company work hiring third party security guards locations order help enforce mask rules.  kids transmit, get it. Jury still long term stuff.

People ok that. *hundreds millions, literally mean understand literally planes outfitted right? far ""all conditions"" prevent mask use list least one two three? None justify people leaving homes and/or constant medical care hospital certainly justify allowing people spread covid19. Asses line? wearing mask Testing far low world. hard draw conclusions numbers likely way cases many countries. US far leader 50 million tests, nowhere near enough.

3 examples:

India 1.4 billion ppl 14 million tests.
Brazil 210 million ppl 2.5 million tests.
Mexico 126 million people 278,000 tests.

If anyone genuinely curious go ET here's good starting point:


Start small. Maybe sanitizing hands fitting mask mirror taking again. repeatedly help get used act simply putting mask on, step one.Again, key exposure therapy keep small build comfort, ""all nothing"" approach.


Build comfort wearing mask home maybe getting dressed, maybe 5 minute activity. Something put mask on, quick task take again. 


Then try something spans longer time period making breakfast watching TV show. Something still familiar safe space, takes effort do. gained comfortable smaller situations escalate become comfortable unknown environment whatever need to. Taking step back re-establish comfortability smaller step okay, long giving up. doesn‚Äôt even need reason, long it‚Äôs based Bigotry. Legally speaking. Good. Allergic social responsibility.

Huhh???

Ever think them?? New York told contact tracers ask protest attendance. technically trying defend mask dodgers, masks actually quite difficult breathe in. point trouble sitting would bother wore walking flight stairs. imagine people find mask makes hard breathe use confirmation bias. Year Magical Thinking 100% agree. people fake support animals. occupational therapist yes preference therapist child. However, extenuating circumstance. providing therapy virtually right kiddos going well. Since, whatever reason Google query eluded you, source. overruled orders mean wear mask, going go jail wore mask

Your top elected leader thinks flu one day, like miracle disappear even listen advisors, think he's one listening to? NYC hit hard first seems like one paid attention learned anything America mess got thing! year before, almost like season kind thing. 

Most blood donation places offering free antibody testing donation, otherwise seems around $10. comes back negative wont able say already sure people too. influence follow suit.

Such shame. That's true.

Mortality lot higher spikes.

Also assume ""no vaccine.""   USA, women are„Äã50% breadwinners now. well everything else. men great achievers? WHITE men. White privilege. Entitlement. know Reddit hates emojis write: „Ää„Ääeyes roll„Äã„Äã. Nah, separate families primarily hispanic origin lock children cages minimal oversight often never reunite them. hey, Chinese baddies, right?

Actually no, that‚Äôs whataboutism. We‚Äôre shitty. particular set skills. Skills I've acquired lifetime hunting trolls like you.... Waited 12 days positive results PA. :( health organizations recommending face masks. CDC National institute infectious disease recommend face masks now. world health organization recommends facemasks now. European health organizations recommend face masks now. Asian health organizations recommending forever.

There's lot circumstantial evidence supporting effectiveness. Densely populated countries like Taiwan, South Korea, Japan Singapore managed contain covid-19 really well.

Do think success nothing face masks?

One point want bring people die covid-19 mean serious. stories people deal thing months. evidence permanent lung damage people. flu. run around block mask purely trigger neighbors anti-mask. like quarter mile I'll times day less bored. transfer patients available beds. AZ even sometimes state. YES! posed question friends thread:

Are people return shopping carts people rush aisle right plane lands? posted somewhere else applies here:

I hold everyone refuses wear mask accountable, inaction ignorance causing death. hold leaders accountable witnessing happened overseas, NYC, nothing prepare this. hold media accountable spreading misinformation politicizing medical emergency. every one them, responsible needless death countless suffering. forget beyond this. weird.  people refusing wear masks knowing kill others.  pure evil looks like. Ahhhh sound Quebecers arriving vacation destination. course dumb lets on, people love exaggerate swing back opposite way pretend he's genius. aren‚Äôt gonna 40 million us. Yes forced say home watch Netflix get people sick killed thing subjugation enslavement entire race people. Professional athletes celebrities. Got it. First, Chinese Australians facing hate crimes - article even mentions Vietnamese Australians threatened knives.

Second, every person Chinese ancestry Australia guilty government China does? happened ""I hate CCP, people?""  Especially means narrower, targeted rollout earlier that. knew vulnerable loved ones safe could really breathe sigh relief alone. fucking constitution doesn‚Äôt allow want!

This never stopped either party before.

Apparently, lives line, suddenly COTUS important. waggle money donations voting causes protest/marching gear tools, can't reach wary anxious less fortunate brown black families child/ren's class(es)? can't get 'pod' white wealthy parents pool money pay tutor couple brown black kids disproportionately left behind, affected 4+ hours computer time, may latch-key kids 10, 12 hours day help get screen... among crowd also vying help solo teacher across screen?

that's problem, seems. white wealthy people saying 'you're own' black brown kids sake kids white kids 'pod'. i'm sorry, context, seems like article put arrow target, mad called out. What? intelligent conversation 2015 too? Sorry pointing things aren‚Äôt black white often times issues complicated shades gray. Maybe shuttering schools foreseeable future right answer I‚Äôm denying I‚Äôm saying complicated issue.

While it‚Äôs definitely easy people live home parents one support like come blanket conclusion parents young ones like see detrimental decisions kids. Yes shutting schools looks right answer deserves thoughtful debate. 

You‚Äôre cool internet bro. entire thing makes angry sad feel helpless ridiculously unresponsive government. Literally everything influences opinion something, that's way world works happens politics control science way around ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Well let‚Äôs see happens 40 million can‚Äôt pay rent landlords try evicting us. field work in?

I didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúleave even smaller percentage,‚Äù don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm asked defend statement.

Literally said don‚Äôt good idea size long-term, serious complications, careful assuming common anecdotal, self-reported evidence.

Anything contained exact statement something I‚Äôm saying, implying, hinting angling toward. There's move among clinical psychologists identify commonalities personality disorders considered distinct. ""Cluster A"" includes paranoid, schizoid schizotypal personality disorders, ""Cluster B"" includes antisocial, narcissistic, histrionic, borderline personality disorders; ""Cluster C"" includes obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, dependent personality disorders. Many patients fit better cluster individual diagnoses.

45 clearly narcissist, also exhibits traits antisocial PD. ""Cluster B"" covers both. DarK Netflix meets Contagion fucking constitution doesn‚Äôt allow want!

There basic rules governance functioning government quorums one them. poorly paid social worker. 

But educated enough know listen statistician public health concerns, especially theories go everything medical professionals international level reported advised.

Texas never shut down.

Florida two weeks.

California opened month earlier Michigan did.

Now Michigan open, cases going back up.

Whoever paying reconsider salary. Oregon here:

My husband tested Covid-19 Wednesday (Essential worker, worrying symptoms, NEGATIVE, thank you, God) got results last night around 6:00 pm. waits horrific inexcusable. unhappy German govt handled tourism. states started summer vacation yet. discussion among politicians comes late.

The logical way would get travel surveillance system place, lift travel warnings. Nah, fuck Hillary Clinton. I'd rather Jill Stein something Waiting trump follow suit Im mostly comparing general appearance. Large presence man crazy hair Good luck plan. criminal record really help chances finding new place live. one blatantly breaking law, zero leverage. 70k cases day.

We probably hit testing limits. sustainable whatsoever.  Even do, elderly sick ppl need use hospital. beds filled covid patients, start turning heart attacks, strokes, etc away. That's real tragedy. thing clearly got lab fist read bat animal thought ""what weirdo carries bat?"" realized animal assholes.  wait August 1? going take another full week people find buy mask? local Kroger tons selling right inside front door! Still early that. alternative literally spending day 6' x 6' box. eat breakfast lunch desk spend recess desk.

That official ""plan"" in-person school wife's district.

How less socially isolating zoom meeting home? Yeah im getting really tired working class people second class citizens next corporations Scuba diver, Astronaut,and Bubble boy three GREAT costume ideas NYC still adding cases roughly fast rest state though. July 1st July 22nd, NYC 6,930 cases (about .083% NYC residents). rest state added 7,813 cases (about .071% New Yorkers outside NYC).

I see point think actually argument level herd immunity NYC.

NYC added .083% period, vs .071% MUCH less dense area. NYC rides subways every day, can't reasonably social distance even Central Park sidewalk, even car, never cooks home. NYC similar infection rate much less dense surrounding area, NYC higher serological immunity, argument NYC natural herd immunity. would expect NYC dramatically outpace rural NY herd immunity.

I know NYC vs. rural NY serological immunity percentage think agree NYC higher rural? pretending Sweden's response boot taste?

Want blow mind?

Sweden. 10 million population. lockdown. 5,600 deaths.

Michigan. 10 million population. Hard lockdown. [6,100 sure lot good!

And .. Sweden‚Äôs projected economic downturn (1% GDP) less Germany (6.5%), Netherlands (6.8%), EU whole (7.4%), Belgium (8%), France (8.2%), Croatia, (9.1%), Spain (9.4%), Italy (9.5%), Greece (9.7%) UK (up 14%). comparison, New Zealand government predicting downturn around 10%. .. Norwegian Institute Public Health says [shouldn't locked assessment now....is could possibly achieved effects avoided unfortunate impacts locking down, instead keeping open infection control measures,"" said. 

The boot tastes lovely! try some. hear easier said done though. folks squandering cash ie cousin...smh. Anyway others saving used necessities, food, medication, etc. Luckily let go position enough savings months. ran UI finally kicked in. Others know still waiting 3+ months later. This. Even 2022 good news. don‚Äôt wanna hear ‚Äúsure we‚Äôll get vaccine still social distance wear masks forever‚Äù lacking emotional communication skills last forever, widening social economic inequality, increased child abuse, malnutrition obesity. that's developed countries. source control, make face sweaty hot mask getting damp (why surgicals single-use).

I've surgical masks hand since day 1 leftover university days, time face gets damp wearing I'm outside really hot. I'm really sure good advice. voice mail client indicates spam build pretty big block list get 1/4 many spam calls imagine directing anger lower classes instead inept governance opportunistic financial institutions middle pandemic. name place Absolutely.

When's last time heard someone give fuck children? socialization processes? push people exposing COVID.

Educated caution pressured dangerous situation bullshit excuse two different things. Yeah, that‚Äôs totally incorrect.

Schools remained open children key workers. Reception, year 1 year 6 returned (if parents wanted to) June.

Schools also set work pupils home. Ok, much they‚Äôd usually do, sisters done nothing since March, that‚Äôs bad parenting.  keep reading ""quick, accurate, new tests"" feel like months now...but USA still scratch brain wait long time results. also dislike seems clear covid (say GI tract) may show nose swab. Anything say would get banned mods cannot talk without talking politics.

And mods even allow us vote sub rules.

So, thoughts prayers Fauci useful politicians. That‚Äôs awful, I‚Äôm sorry. less sad 100 + thousand dead 50% Merica give shit.  Wow. Incredible story make feel fat sitting ass 10k speed run Netflix would‚Äôve happy see he‚Äôs making progress. mask whatsoever, mask ever slightly chin.

It‚Äôs funny literally one asking people masked times, you‚Äôre inside around people don‚Äôt live with. that‚Äôs harder get self righteous about.  Wait track people? Thats first time hear people know believes say get us sick reduce population Splendid isolation? We're already banned going country lol, except disease also raging care whatever that's worth. I'm sorry. deserves better teachers. Here's photo talking (not drinking falsely claimed) friend (who live Fauci's household should, therefore, socially distancing) mask never get good response say ""so whole world it?"" comes goalpost moving flu bro akll crap. say easy, can't say ""harder"" person. harder reach students remotely person. we'd spent several months building relationships students. hard teaching kids remotely met you? pros teaching remotely - get time, get ready travel. worked hours day, taught person too. me, teaching always risky terms catching something. confidence starting school year remotely. need buy students.

Oh absolutely! However, look current infection, hospitalization, death statistics, CLEAR delineation states run Trumpists, not. Even state R governor Baker, hates Trump, perfect example achieved officials handled situation front them, instead trying bolster party line Washington. NY times hot spot map? ""The reason call American Dream asleep believe it."" - George Carlin like who's health? come rubbish  living time public safe. In-person government services safe. Government actions led scenario. Now, people rely government suffer. everyone supposed suffer equally government fucked up? millions recently unemployed lived paycheck paycheck managed pay rent.
 
It's shit situation. First mandate masks.

Regardless, eating establishments shouldn‚Äôt open. Shit article written intention making people say ""see, can't anything it, shit"" reality places talking mini surge working hard get back control, probably do. know exactly people making threats...... They're also better picking ones less likely survive now.

So, pick ones start denying hospital care hospital even fills up. Suddenly, hospital overrun. places need lockdown also restaurants open masks aren‚Äôt required. Masks much. I‚Äôve really started lose hope humanity since entered food service. Also confirmed: grass usually grows reduced 10 days now? lies coming CDC. Yup hospitalization going well. Yet mask mandate state. important population density taken account per capita using data analysis discern potential harm virus would think. 100% agree u tho points, fact handled well federal level US crashing burning. seem like new cases going either. 72k still counting Friday. Pretty sad 1k deaths even besides tuesday-thursdays now. they‚Äôve likely passed. testing slow get results. Nope. I‚Äôve worked nursing homes 10 yrs. different ALFs. think you‚Äôre looking old data.

We parents office kids seem always sick...and seems worse kid. One kid seems come strep least year. illness struck terror hearts parents kid....seemed like death sentence back day. resource shortage, problems completely caused capitalism. There's plenty food, nobody afford it. would still mean we'd go almost full cycle flu season, means things could get bad places. lot people die. bursts time. burst Vietnam, got reinflated. burst debacle Iraq, got reinflated. burst election trump (to people), believed Trump propaganda, going another bursting people finally recognizing Trump's incompetence. 

And thing is...Trump likely lose, painful reckoning, then...it likely get reinflated again! 

Because inherent advantages still exist virus past bodies finally buried. We've yet finish fax machines paper letters off, doubt email die time soon. Right Congress, Republicans resistant extending unemployment benefits think people avoid abundant available jobs order stay home. public health perspective, people staying home going work actually makes ton sense. growth Coronavirus cases happening working class homes people option working home, options instead risking infection eviction. ..../s?

So ignore facts staring face unsafe result unnecessary deaths, possibly lot long-term damage. eventual closure anyways weeks later.  point even avid mask wearers remove masks times. Finding _one_ picture months service public hardly hypocritical, timing.

I'm really confused reply AP news story. source seems information. information died. could murder, could covid-19, could random heart attack. It‚Äôs turnaround.

/s Wait. serious? Sadly eyes him. read link look graphs. It‚Äôs fault poorly formatted. Weird.

The lockdown worked state.

We almost entirely open numbers still low. man tested regularly

Meanwhile average person wait days week get test. obese people high blood pressure survive covid. Risk factors mean certain negative outcomes. are, like reddit, relatively young, odds survival good, even risk factors. Lose weight, good health long term also seek mental health support need it. Uh huh. masks.......  extremely component government.

My hospital ICU waiting list weeks now.

And we're talk rationing PPE we're pretty sure two nurses got sick either March April. really good time frame right now. Well considering new CDC ‚Äúguidelines‚Äù seem like written opinion piece 14 year old didn‚Äôt research, I‚Äôll pass taking opinions seriously. listen - still almost impossible schools follow guidelines keep kids staff safe. Read taking week get death certificates issued. Alot bodies take time. think wife sleep chair bed, too? called Delayed And, I'll honest you, ideal.

Yeah, imagine. mean, HCP thinks need ICU bed, delayed admission probably last thing need. heat? I‚Äôm asking managing heat mask on. Going stairs irrelevant. Okay adopting strategy shitshow come! Unavailable EU ‚ÄúOur European visitors important us.‚Äù

Do mention many layers? sew every one mine two layers. Please go treating reality personal affront. wish well. meantime think conversation proving productive. Good evening! Sounds like socialism never going happen. Maybe read link instead skimming information agrees worldview BULLSHIT! CDCs job accurately report facts! CDC ZERO business various ways facts may processed.  I‚Äôm conspiracy theorist stretch, isn‚Äôt webcam exploit valid concern? thought remote activation webcam possible (didn‚Äôt school get trouble spying students?)

The real question is, time inclination watch four hours someone mumbling keyboard. Dude probably test every 45 minutes. Fuck fox. Texas Texas size COVID cases... pretty soon, everything bigger Texas... including pandemic.  üëè üëè üëè sitting household members, one else sight? *::toggles 5G switch on::* I‚Äôve learned overestimate intelligence U.K. public whole Brexit debacle.

\-Sudden urge Party/socialize without mask others boobies neat. Even wouldn't. They've chosen stupid, care themselves.

Sorry hear Dad. Sending good vibes way. Redfield longstanding piece shit, look biography. Oh mean people almost wearing masks? evidence showing spreading it? NYC non-stop protests several thousand people day day day, jump cases. Try educating reading simplistic propoganda matches whatever want get angry about. Nice try msm.  According Worldometers, global net population growth 2020 far 45.6 million people. Although Covid 19 deadly virus, it‚Äôs nowhere close lethal enough reduce population globally. 

And due mortality rate tightly linked age, population lost (not all) likely past point kids, may minor affect current population, actually minimal effect population growth. moved deaths would've happened next 1-20 years year, births mostly unaffected.  sound strange, really enjoyed watching Contagion, 2011 movie Matt Damon pandemic. usually Hollywood crap, actually pretty scientific realistic. figure way solve problem end found refreshing hopeful. think trigger you, maybe avoid, liked it. thing got right dangerous conspiracy theories started 5 minutes movie. thought, non arguments lol  sure shit second New Deal get us it, either.

Don't sure. I'm sure government happily give taxpayer money fortune 500's claim ""hardship"" economic downturn. Renters, homeowners small business owners left cold. ""Latino make half COVID-19 cases""

Same thing county. 75% cases roughly 40% population. Perhaps essential workers white people work home. I‚Äôve eaten much ice cream , literally prob 20 pints since March, end world. Fuck it, right? Bullshit. saying severely drunk people follow quarantine rules? belligerent? 

That's totally brainless. ‚ù§Ô∏è next time, friend.

Let's see happens. Fined? allowed kill spot. indifferent innocent human lives cease behind human themselves.  I'm sorry, thought irony obvious. da fuq bodybuilder know... :) California already taken measures slow spread, although shutdown. Florida done little slow spread trying force kids back school.

Florida easily overtake California continues. Oh dear lord state falls. weird one - would normally see FDA EU certification gold standard safety tricky legitimate concerns one drugs vaccine otherwise scenario's like this. 2004 Vioxx scandal, FDA approved well. get vaccine, there's reasons worried. I‚Äôm 8 months pregnant, furloughed. Probably won‚Äôt job (after 15 year career) go back my(unpaid) maternity leave ends. Still waiting unemployment come through. Lucky enough saved December expenses. lucky. 
Don‚Äôt paint us broad brushstrokes ‚Äúreallifebadass‚Äù üôÑ. Life easy right now. Consider lucky. Red isn‚Äôt republican wins. It‚Äôs death. Death donald. Death home right thing once. Nurses long term care facility workers could paid ""isolation bonuses"", capitalism good intentions best way incentivize people make radical change lifestyles. ideal way world operates.

A perfect barrier indeed created; that's vast majority doctors nurses close contact COVID infected people get infected (the number infected health workers less 0.1% worldwide). PPE exists reason.

The alternative ""everyone pauses lives notice"". Life absence death, enjoyment alive.

Put shoes terminal patient: would rather spend last weeks living normal life isolating loved ones dying alone there's virus MIGHT kill sooner? he‚Äôs right People care get infected spread people care unable avoid people.

This rocket science, bub. entire argument Dems cannot things Congress sometimes case, Dems follow rules.

And disagree congress skirt constitution cases too. want Congress follow constitution time, every time. see contradiction there. really care party flouting letter spirit law, dems pale comparison shit gop pulled last decade so. 

So ask third time: **why directing anger people trying help play rules, even they‚Äôre perfect, instead people actively blocking them?**  May Belarus populated area spread Swedes densely populated climate physical terrains ? poorest American vastly better people India Africa. stupid thing write. Insulting, really fuck nonsense? Cryptocurrency? bitcoin? museum town announcex 5 millionth visitor. Florida. What? Fuck no! Stay home! See? run arguments rely downvotes I'm trying invalidate statement anything, place blame one group? can't combination things, policies, groups, etc.? agree. situation ""intelligent action"" based Americans history quarantine skirting. attacking half-measures make things worse. Local travel would subject many communities traveler vice-versa. massively increasing contacts could say ""well let people fly!"" 

Now, full-on stay-at-home order accompanied fly order, talking. situation posed. 

Context logic matters half-measure efficacy least exacerbate things would different story surely open consideration. thing worse passive defeatism point active incompetence. Yo tell goku weighted vests. I‚Äôm going hope he‚Äôs cautious he‚Äôs saying.... mostly because, least far see, doesn‚Äôt define widely several months. Could 1/2 willing population inoculated June? Even would severely slow disease. Spare us ridiculous lies. Simply look countries controlled virus see works. bother replying, blocked pigheaded stupidity. I'm upvoting I'm glad talked about.  died 4 months testing positive. might right people public without masks makes lose faith human decency Rent free True, anecdotal evidence common, actual studies come 6-18 months now, extremely unsurprising determined long term complication rate Covid-19 statistically significantly greater zero. know magnitude? (I suspect, based upon complication rates infectious diseases, it'll multiple death rate large percentage hospitalized) know long term complications exist? Definitely hear you. baby born March 11th nothing scares inadvertently bringing virus home. straw fact death rate absurdly high

5.6 people every 10,000 died Covid 4 months.

So that's like 1 2 people every 10,000 dying per month.

Most 80s.

I doubt would time year would called ""absurdly high"" death rate.

If talking last year COVID ever thing, told virus Africa killed 5 people every 10,000 70 ... doubt would even think ""a bad virus"" all.

You would like ""And ..?"" Great. Go make 80 dollars get covid. don‚Äôt give fuck. Enjoy put blinders tight can't even think countries existing coming idiotic theories. They'd immediately realize stupid did. people barely think understand beyond hours drive hometown. People grew small town within state currently live even know cities like. thought riots burning city anarchy. single night early June broken storefront windows graffiti. mean few. flipped shit paranoid it.

Meanwhile city top 10 national coronavirus hotspot weeks silent, barely notice it. would know understand what's going rest world they're easily fooled even know what's going nearest major city? Freedom fries Covid seasoning. pays sure understand point. Maybe I'm loop here. Read article. 

By picking lower bound limit given range 3 weeks several months, you‚Äôve outed narrative want push. example since mid March, funny didn‚Äôt bring up. 

Also, you‚Äôre talking ass second sentence. It‚Äôs virus specific it‚Äôs indeed unusual coronavirus you‚Äôre wrong well. 

The last one pretty obvious I‚Äôm sure wanted comment. early data point cluster assess again, stupid post you. simply said friend, loudly enough around hear, ""this person risking lives, look risking lives something stupid"" stared uncomfortably. people low threshold public embarrassment ANYTHING avoid weirdo starting shit grocery store. helps always middle-aged women occasionally whipped husbands. 

They either leave, put mask on, immediately push back, case strategically retreat worth getting shot crazy person. maybe is, know, risk getting shot this. 

Fortunately mostly middle-aged women whipped husbands, huff puff without anything. Makes feel slightly less powerless. 

It helps feel overwhelming doom regarding future find little care day day life, started engaging dangerous behaviors get little thrill.  same...feels weird upvoting boris quote doesnt lol worries! end year, we'll calling New York ""the first Florida"" talking original outbreak. high hit hard beginning. locked new deaths drooped single digits.

Yesterday Texas 212 deaths. lock down.

Florida 173. lock down.

California 157. Opened early.

Michigan 7. 2.5 month lock down.

We trending deaths since April 30th.

All listed states still trending up.

I guess feel like New York, 2nd highest death rate US trending downwards since April 14th, 2 reported deaths today, also saw effect lock either, hm? Uh oh supporters like that! god damn genius one finely aged ~~Gouda~~ Karen ~~Whine~~ Rose'. Woodrow Wilson, huge rasist piece shit too. Half America death cult heard evidence

Thats problem new disease. could used offload hospitals patients virus. plan never got point thanks god Cuomo. control enough world 30 years ago give Bill Gates billions dollars without never noticed bet nerd would invent chip track control humans within lifespan comically bad controlling taking world problem people spend entirety unemployment checks food medicine. Plenty people completely responsible blow money big screen TVs trips Vegas still going put street. indefensible. Ah yeah, good ol‚Äô ‚Äúpreconception trumps science‚Äù fallacy. People fucking stupid. 

[reminds got tested 2 months ago city offering popup testing anyone regardless symptoms. gone hospital test week concerned then. Since stopped that, don‚Äôt qualify popup testing unless symptoms. go PCP get order testing since don‚Äôt symptoms, sent order hospital near answering testing line. I‚Äôm showing symptoms want safe contact someone high risk. girlfriend able get tested called local clinic lied symptoms. guess solution lie? I've seen two layers since beginning. Yup, confounders. Let's bring 'em on. also Swedes actually appeared obeyed government guidelines social distancing better Americans have.

That's exactly point! People give shit get infected regardless lockdown not. Similarly, people care get infected regardless lockdowns. Thus, lockdowns pretty much irrelevant infection, disastrous livelihoods lot relationships disintegrated this, hell lot harder meet somebody new moment. We'll probably seen initial boom March-April period, would bet see massive drop that. I'm teacher. think we've ok far, considering taught remotely past spring/summer. think fun time many professions. feel waitstaff, bartenders, grocery/supermarket workers, cops, firefighters, nurses, doctors...and many professions option go work course pandemic.

You see reality add lifetime propaganda. breaking painful process. 

If accept science/reality entire life comes crashing down. akin learn age 40 parents actually scientists experimental child. shit like that. literally not. rich country happen rich, still like living first world country. poor country, rich actual survival/basic human rights risk daily country can't anything wellness. guess Weird, schools first damn thing closed then? It‚Äôs almost want everyone go work school give appearance normalcy election November kids die, it. Food unlikely transmission source. like article, Google read one many articles discuss safe takeout always said pull parking lot Walmart 3 Lamborghinis parked middle change fact every car beater might even start.

But yet somehow everyone parking lot f says park highest valued parking lot world! I've worked home 4 years, live Austin, shorts year around me. time put dress shirt sales dinner/lunch. tested negative. It‚Äôs really hard fathom get cold feel sick without Covid. Hell, I‚Äôve slept AC low temp woke feeling sick. Hopefully don‚Äôt end testing positive though. less infections now. could even higher March/April know. waaaay tests positivity rates significantly lower. probably 100k close infections NY daily testing capacity vastly lower. logical reason assume we're capturing higher proportion positive cases. Yep. infections definitely exploded like bomb. hard believe consider crowded area number infections pouring overseas travelers. One would hope FL, CA, TX see kind explosion due measures even imperfect. Yeah, Sweden late react slow respond, failed execute key point strategy - keep risk groups safe. it'd lie say daily numbers continuously getting better. Texas requires ID vote. Someone posted told would November could get appointment renew ID. means would get ID election. serve anymore. wouldn't. mask, service! complain, threaten call police.

I serious. keep serving them, keep getting away criminal behaviors never learn lesson. they'll ever learn anyway...

Also, good luck thanks essential worker. use similar tactics playing character public present honest beliefs political support. things know many people react badly arouse sympathy people don‚Äôt care much. Fucking vultures many cases too. hope trace 77,000 people's contacts day? person diagnosed COVID Arizona gets sent California treatment dies hospital California, state counts death? Well, 10% Americans 75% wealth.

I know countries worse wealth inequality this, we're worst metric among world's powers.

Meaning *median* American probably much better off, all, median European, Brit, Canadian, etc.

Especially factor employment-based healthcare medical bankruptcy part American way life. ""It's right wear mask.""

Morally speaking... also right wear condom HIV. also morally wrong so..

Also, regards one night stands/undisclosed HIV situation. HIPAA violation put together someone went hospital COVID, died due complications(whether secondary infection; comorbidities, bad intubation, whatever speculate days) otherwise never COVID. want say ""akshually, technically COVID death."" bully you.

Also, call wife liar. attack anyone. Dwight, ignorant slut. Okay, Completely different scenario. 

One terrorist attacked, pathogen. 

We bombed another country make sure 3,000 died, make sure economy stayed together. 

By way, typical heavy flu season kills 60,000 80,000 people U.S.

Farmers, truckers, grocery store workers, healthcare professionals, police, educators, etc. many (but all) US deemed essential would still working. better protections, yes. still taking risk, willingly not, working. Right now, US, no. best models seen utilize space younger kids older remote, workable distance older kids self sufficient. US schools overcrowded even half capacity lot.

Not mandating banning something 100% enforcement impractical makes sense. 1 4 anti-maskers start wearing masks fear fine, that's win. 

And, aside, yes, "".4"" number worth it. Absolutely. people refusing wear masks violates rights ones screaming *all* lives matter. So... yeah. Worth it.

The nurse thing bullshit though, know carers rightly pissed this. says something negative seemingly gets ignored

You here, literally get berated posts news idiotic thing Boris said constantly. absolute bullshit.

I work gym mask everyday. ""breathe easy"" surgical mask could buy.

You sweat gets soaking wet. cardio everyday. extremely difficult breathe. still fucking rules.

But absolute fucking bullshit. creepy keep hitting randomly weeks road. natural discussion, stalking, super creepy. Makes think tad unstable. Something said must really triggered you.  mean is(assuming virus mutate mild + therapeutics found):

A: vaccine 2-3 years immunity people last year+.

B: vaccine 2-3 years + immunity lasts 3-6 months.

C: vaccine ever + immunity lasts 3-6 months.

If A:

Countries either move Sweden model(small restrictions) South Korea model(contact tracing app + regional shut downs). course Sweden model harder countries without social programs/per capita rates SK model privacy concerns.

If B:

Money get poured testing make &lt;10 minutes + super easy yourself. Possible Apple watch take saliva prick finger see it. Ban large gatherings continue masks required indoors crowded outdoor areas. International travel limited tele-work would continue company can.

If C:

Basically B tele-work would become norm permanently. would also see lot money poured virtual reality substitute isolation.

However really see vaccine impossible, whole world would pouring money getting one. HIV one targets immune system never crippling economy COVID treatment/preventative medicine people take.

TLDR:

Money would poured testing technology make fast accurate, tele-work/school would become norm virtual reality would probably take-off compensate isolation. They've cancelled many appointments without explanation rescheduling impossible find another one, problem There's way people listen another shutdown. world's longest yard sale scheduled next month. go Facebook page, many people talking excited can't wait. people saying week plan going refuse wear masks. multiple family members vacation right even planning trips next month plus massive reunion. fucking hard stay home?   plenty world leaders done much, much worse Trump. look act goofy it. over-reporting stupid shit (or sometimes even do) help either. IMO, first big fuck-up reaction COVID-19.  We've exceeded testing capacity. point shutting option places like Florida, Arizona, Texas, LA...if want get cases control enough overwhelm clinical labs. There's reason Arizona 61,000 test backlog tests taking 2-3 weeks places. There's many active cases therefore many necessary tests. middle ground? America literally never, UK even really call Lib Dems middle ground? never represented middle ground even presented representing it. not, never shutdown quarantine useless, bought least little time likely virus spreading worse during/pre shutdown now. testing capacity see uncontrolled spread looks like gorgeous Link one single peer-reviewed study says that. downvoted people sub want hear things overblown lot cases. shows crazy right turning scientific facts political opinions like everything. unless takes away freedom! 

/s feel Dr. Seuss poem making here...

Would you, could you, plane?
Would you, could you, eating restaurant chain? Im sure graduating top class good nurse are. Chris Duntsh graduated top class went top level fellowship program spinal surgery arguably one worst surgeons time. let's say matter, what? pandemic best staff working hospitals exactly happening, best actually, nurses likely jumping hospitals seeing paying well going rate providing housing many situations. (Florida hiring nurses $6K week go help covid, talk love geriatrics want money talks.) Also seems like nurses stop working facilities poorly run unable run change order get workers need survive, think better way advocate resident well being. English please!  Except multiple studies show previous infection prevent infected future. 
So without vaccine proper treatments could go long time. governor utterly delusional. 

He recorded record amount deaths 173 new deaths yesterday, recently broke hospitalizions records week.

Any platue cases coming lack test kits available. 

Hell, even trump want go Florida host Rnc. 

Governor DeSantis, get head ass something. Otherwise hospitals get overwhelmed. ""platue"" sustainable means. person we're comparing isn't? absolutely are. Class longer dividing factor UK elections - age, race, area far vital. must say surprised Trump abandoned favorite coronavirus party FL forcing party move Charlotte Jacksonville. stands canceling coronavirus party followers continuing parties elsewhere. unpatriotic. least pretend willing die followers. Eat restaurant? Maybe Europe could try ['Covid-safe' restaurant wonder good acid. Hes clearly wearing mask picture Fines way down. even think b4 typed?  That's cases India recent deaths factored yet.

Not sure constantly explained, test positive, instantly die. takes several weeks. Even get vaccination every year stay immune this, will. mom too. long safe guess ask whole thing. Hopefully oxford vaccine (and others) keep showing promising trial data. Uh oh, Arizona fall behind? medical leaders including Fauci Jerome Adams spend first two months actively telling us wear masks.

We fighting months months anti-mask inertia need wear masks most.....

The Asian countries made right call beginning. Obviously didn't.... shutdown bill.

It‚Äôs shutdown bill sense doesn‚Äôt forcefully shut nation. However includes extended direct payments citizens, necessary shutdowns. 



Also, dems literally 0 ability force vote senate. Don‚Äôt know about. posting trash copypasta order get downvotes? heard evidence possibility getting infected passerby street. I'm masks inside people prolonged contact breeze recirculated air, wearing outside mostly pointless stiff fine insane. Medicines actually work typically talked Opinion pieces. like looks completely nuts he‚Äôs calling people nuts. hypothesis one? never thought would agree life time.  didnt read article without context, take mean 2 things:

- tiny group wealthy people disguises fact people r low lower middle class.

- r morally intellectually deficient n class. hope helps rationalize thinking anti-maskers. However, think cutting oxygen excuse used venting, often disgruntled upset usually status society. 

The society government address real underlying issue people, obviously part society. 

Any behaviors, opinion, mock people counter-productive, simply people trouble attack stubborn rebellious. Well least he's honest guess. Really mind boggling even issue first place charge White House Senate. say got plenty leverage Look another redditor peddling bullshit! know real timescale benefits you.

Flu risky vaccine far concerned, forecast vaccine necessarily work given year. That's July 16th. believe patients transferred anymore due decrease hospitalizations. Bruh, literally can‚Äôt that.

Lol yes literally can. using literally wrong, bruh.

The argument trying make legislation would vulnerable legal challenge grounds legitimacy. That's literal argument. Literally nothing physically preventing Senate session. physical obstacle.

And Congress passes laws vulnerable legal challenge time. state legislatures. federal judiciary branch whose job would hear case.

But that, Republicans would stop vacation, return work, file injunction. would get coverage help Dems presumably want win November, right? look really great Repubs working Dems stopped. 

And much welcome CNN coverage November.

""McConnell, tell us what's going on?""

""Well, sorting coke someone's ass got wind Democrats working successfully passed legislation give poor people money trying stop poor people getting money.""

Yes, let's conversation. one would go jail it. risk absolutely minimal. would make Repubs look bad. Dems would actually fighting things claim want.

And there's good chance, done correctly, bill would extraordinary support Republicans would let pass take credit it. do.

Look, everyone gets basic income bankroll lockdowns, voting bases support that. placing Repubs position reverse guaranteed money.

It's easy BLOCK legislation without media coverage. 

It's harder REVERSE especially optics bailed party working.

The Repubs done extremely similar things. Dems can't seem figure shit out. happen. Texas people type thing like everything's fine dandy. Also, it''s Abbott. mini shutdown last time. even time. He'll even probably turned blind eye bars opening tomorrow defiance order. research Ben Jerry's community.

They pay employees double minimum wage, hire felons, donate loads money worthy causes like ending war drugs native communities (among many others)

Edit: smokers guess depends think wide scale means whether think needing oxygen outward signal long term issues. Trust experts don‚Äôt, you, don‚Äôt agree one advice thrown window too. Like not, you‚Äôre fucking expert, are.  They'll counted eventually end year. Aren‚Äôt comments political?  driven chic fil months drive line spilling street. uncanny.. sub optmistic vaccines rarely hear failed projects.

Change mind. modest, usa disaster! take responsibility one paying stay closed, fact mortgage, loan, credit card payments still coming due every month help either. ""I'm best lean god throughout ordeal. Ultimately control know that""

God control? you, decided ignore professional advice led death loved ones? belive scientists instead? know, guys girls literally telling stay home, gather wear mask? Yes. Unless know reason wear mask without knowing actively ill (such case covid), sick public. Wearing masks 100% time technically COULD sick time absurd. ‚ÄúOf course know them, they‚Äôre me.‚Äù Good luck that. 'merica ain't tryin' hear that.  makes go E already tried practicing home? First 30 seconds, longer longer times? support mask mandate, think ""test"" like good science. matter fact, recent study Uninversit√§tsklinikum Leipzig, Germany found negative effect masks exercise capacity:

Effects surgical FFP2/N95 face masks cardiopulmonary exercise capacity: obviously stop wearing mask general public, take findings account. example could workers physically demanding jobs wearing masks, allowed extra breaks, etc. go again, ‚Äúmy issues‚Äù like odd want make personally me. always funny someone explains something said much better could ever explained it. Thanks! exactly finding origin help us understand virus better?

You say reason virus can't mutate infect different mutations. sound like strong grasp biology. greater risk thousands different strains wild... one strain top priority hunt except childish blame games.

If middle pandemic maybe, important things. didn't, said able get back normal possible Christmas planning worst. test Sweden‚Äôs current level herd immunity enough keep cases going spite this. RemindMe! 2 weeks Ah, understand now! Thank you. actually one reliable predictions, since BJ actually able remove restrictions. point, really depends stage 3 trials vaccine finish, quickly produce distribute vaccine. 1/3rd dead, COVID. Seriously, people issue following guidelines can‚Äôt don‚Äôt want wear mask, order online curbside pickup something. Even think masks dumb, avoid told wear one going store. Mask, quarantine. VNmese speaking.

The methods hardly done countries. Especially ones individualism.

Imagine boarded flight Vietnam. left arrival terminal taxi, nowhere phone rang, call official, asking stay self-isolated 14 days. arrived home &amp; saw officials already stayed door whoever house/hotel moment. handed noticing paper personal info &amp; contacts - nurse &amp; policeman surveiling place.

People US EU would freak moment received call. Florida, back testing admitted cases COVID case load capacity handle tests overwhelmed. said 'and people spread to'. Death complication, though, think ridiculous. Kids lifelong problems. Here's exercise critical thinking: Find point article word ""microchip"" appears.  

Person says: ""Imagine thinking vaccine thing microchip it."" 

Person B says: ""That's get. would anyone waste time expense developing thing"" (hint: context, ""such thing"" referring vaccine microchip it) 

And come along post article nothing whatsoever microchips vaccines. idea inject ink skin [not done patch interesting, also irrelevant. doctor giving vaccination could write arm sharpie it'd accomplish exactly thing except would fade days vs 5 years. None justifies belief vaccines contain microchips let alone ones developed treat pandemic do. forgot mention can't hike without one, either. Everybody else sure I'm saying I'm saying telling clearly why, sure get busy doubling projecting issues everyone else, course initial problem.  That‚Äôs immediately associate societal cause communism socialism. Americans really general pretty fucking dumb though haha Yikes. ventilators great either, reason worst cases put sleep/coma use.

If ventilator nothing much else might wish die instead enduring pain.

:yuiwave:  mean, it‚Äôs unfortunate scary find position questioning CDC, are. source expert advice, would agree doubting previous advice. still plenty healthcare infectious disease experts recommending masks distancing. Okay. individual experience invalidates severely lacking education whole across country. experiencing it, happening. think reason medical personnel wears masks? Propaganda? specially designed masks made handle allowing best ability breath special training know limits. masks equal comes impact intense aerobic activity. really see first used word... S*****de like Film ""word"" Squad. found problem posted answer multiple times guys said ""bUt Cdc sAiD"" look recent posts posthistory, lot deleted posts (the shadowbanned bot post)

Thank helping friend mentioned another reply. Mass infections young people usually show stats prominently significantly raises risk secondary spreading events within vulnerable groups. yes, sure talking exact thing here. ""Not taking lockdown seriously"" ""protests riots"" kind exact thing. deadly young people. (I meant Facebook something go by, hate imperialism) Nothing said sarcastic. little pathetic reaching reasons get upset insult others? think invading county nothing 9/11, destabilizing Middle East generation leading rise ISIS deaths millions civilians, giving worst nature allowing torture detainment without due process, violating Geneva Convention turning us war criminals overreaction. 

Not mention damage done home voluntary surrender many freedoms privacy little nothing show it. Nothing says capitalism like grave stone trademarked logo slogan printed persons name. happening. Hahah Hahahaha else people like DeSantis say? already delusional. Elections consequences South lose ""Covid Civil War"" well I‚Äôve said before: know cyts ocygen levels? Fucking COVID19. wore face mask gloves every day public transport. washed hands frequently. social distanced. got sick. can‚Äôt run meters start wheezing. still wear face mask get sick I‚Äôm pretty sure lungs won‚Äôt make said? laugh job done worth. like joke around hide well. Last time foreign country english guys first looked angry gave nickname recognized german always greeted loud ""there see"" waved hands. Lovely people. Think hide good. worry.

Hope get one... tape plastic bags heads keep going. Arrive destination call medical examiner! Australia almost eradicated however huge number expats returning bringing back country. mandatory quarantine people however slip hotel security led local outbreak back lockdown huge testing blitz affected areas government paying $1500 tested need isolate time miss work. almost beaten track resume normal life handful selfish people messed up. Source- live Melbourne. Walking almost always accessible one best forms exercise Hawaii time H1N1 would travel mainland often. probably vulnerable realized 21. 

*Sidenote: used live SD(Eastlake). miss sometimes cost living much moved Florida. Can‚Äôt wait come back get California Burritos over! Essentially every county Florida outbreak time. know people run scholarship group war refugees. two slots Eton every year. there's poorer people go well. food still worst school I've ever visited though (even British standards). Seems like pride it. Delay inevitable? First inevitable. 100% population going get infected. I'm 40 never flu. get infected recover chance catching goes down. See heard immunity. Eventually vaccines.

**Regardless**. Let's say going get infected, **guaranteed**. Here's want lock right now:

We're already way better today months ago getting infected people virus. every day delay getting infected another day Dr's figure meds work meds don't. Another day passes testing gets little quicker, another day get closer vaccine. delay getting infected long possible odds always improving.

We recently figured steroids help. many 147,000 US deaths could prevented gotten infected weeks later did?

In places waiting 10 14 days test result, maybe month that's 1 hour, get earlier intervention gets back feet longer-term effects.

That's why, even inevitable, delay.


Final note, 2 week delay infection symptoms. attitude ""why bother? inevitable"" time ran hospital beds locked it'd late, would 2 weeks cases coming point locked down. go back lock-down get close running beds trend infections going  I'm 100% ok it

I think know want vote for. Huh? I‚Äôm mad people claim virus bad teachers literally dropping dead front class rooms. That‚Äôs alarmist wrong. Yknow

Fauci stated could happen months ago

Yknow

Birx trumps pocket spouting bullshit That‚Äôs bad. Well looks like roaches rule world sooner later Proving early prevention way go. hope goes away. updates weeks...

it's very, strange. control future learning past.  Would rather continue misery strive even better outcomes. say wasn‚Äôt case? said debate reopening safely. mean paper clearly shows 60% children 5-15 cross reactive antibodies. Nobody knows actually means never said anything immune infection.

But facts children get sick looks like children spread anywhere near levels adults. findings reinforce view completely. wife friend, appeared empty stadium. That's different middle Walmart. guy national platform. didn‚Äôt. one agrees TSA rules. They‚Äôre forced comply TSA position enforce.  shocked discover week til August. WTF Well rumors *might* go lockdown definitely hasn‚Äôt happened yet. restrictions place though: gyms closed, nightclubs too. It‚Äôs Friday night streets empty - came back dinner restaurant. definitely breakouts city though cases keep increasing- fact groups unmasked people gather sit terraces drink beer hours literally around every corner half people think wearing mask nose chin smart move probably doesn‚Äôt help.

[edit: bad spelling]  amazing common sense common. People downvoting - going ever use information TLR7 mutation might involved? possibly positive impact life? us scientists publishing get published right future grant money. stuff won‚Äôt help us right now. Yes, let's close stuff. guess what, genius? longer pandemic _rampant_ US, harder economic fallout be. bite fucking bullet responsible citizen. need fly another state long overdue health care can't get locally. 

I'm wondering charter safer commercial. tested end June Texas took 7 days get results back. 

Trump also blaming uptick cases protests. won‚Äôt dare say opening early responsibility uptick would hurt economy. 

We live country economy important human life. Surprisingly enough, great depression life expectancy US citizens went up. fun fact aside. absolutely uncomfortable truth discussion neither willing admit price per life. something say cavalier manner. comfortable even typing it. whether like true discussion having. may call saving life may call avoiding economic disaster merely minds way disguising true negotiation.

We finite amount money. cant simply provide stimulus forever comes time difficult question answered. answer can't whatever takes, number emotional response. full support Lock March April. actually believe NYC quarantined. mean full scale, roll national guard lock down. since then, US spent 4 trillion+ people hardest hit areas sacrificed. Many businesses area coming back. Now, talking closing again? places care follow rules people suffered here? cherry top is: done, may anything left go back to... Look man, admit first comment getting mad straw men. standard.

He lives town 100 apparently. guys realize Fauci also saying schools try open fall, right? totally appreciate that! actually completely accepting religion I'm Agnostic, part directly; think people really need see sides more. know definitely opened eyes refuse deal absolutes. even religious character, really truly appreciate thought put prayer even words. touching thing.  


To completely disregard something simply agree understand idiotic. So, came like shunned religion terribly sorry. can't experience Autism yourself, understand it; simply exist? Sorry bad analogy really find anything compare way, hope know mean. 


What meant said religion originally long force beliefs onto someone will, right attack beliefs validity. mean sense right unless kid never connects religion dragged church parents. openly attacking religion damn foolish makes really spot ""try hard"" edgy types. 


Just tiny bit positivism add onto post, I'm always dick! Everyone knew coming, can‚Äôt help shocked. It‚Äôs going get better too. think so, immediately reopening, curve stabilized going significant way. still 20K new cases per day whole country consistently. That's stopping virus, meant partial shut-down prevented things getting control. Things started get control, expected, states started reopen. another word, pain killer March April, underlying disease (large community infection) cured, stopped med reopening. truly stop virus safely reopen, new case number needs sufficiently low reopen worst cause local outbreak initially, measure place swiftly decisively deal local outbreak spreads far. Nope... scientists did. Plus fact know 6 months worth data. Virus‚Äôs tricky like that. Floridan food truck owner - inspectors authority regarding this. cannot even ask staff wear masks inspect. CNN completely written Republicans right general? Asking seriously...news kindof...bipartisan. parents threatening keep kids 

Part problem solves itself. Fuck it, we‚Äôll LIVE July ‚Äî Virus rips Israeli school masking 150 students Israeli secondary school infected new coronavirus students allowed remove masks 10 days Israeli schools fully reopened 17 May, two students secondary school Jerusalem diagnosed COVID-19. Chen Stein-Zamir Ministry Health Jerusalem colleagues investigated resulting outbreak found 153 students 25 members staff become Infections happen people congregate indoors. controversial statement, view? Okay. issue bad parenting. failing teach proper values even hint delayed gratification actions consequences. quarantining players? AFL running weeks isolating players twice weekly tests combined moving teams around. Admittedly don‚Äôt level government incompetence disinterest public health.  work airline industry I‚Äôve flying past four months one know got it. food thought ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  One keys blacklist. go place see issues, return let friends/relatives know.
Side note- lived California, friend worked sushi place. told closing, owner would sit Stock room use pellet gun nice scurried about.
The place really popular (not mice) California surpassed New York cases. Florida #3 current rate pass New York #2 3 Given understanding risk, think worth like eating out. basically restaurant forest fire. Probably best thing happen want open restaurant unless planning tomorrow. give shit someone love admit hospital full. little perspective. Yeah, everyone wants get back work, normal life, many people part, anti mask, gotta fucking sit restaurant, go longer. 

Want get back normal? Pay people stay home 1 month. Covid disappears. site stuck averages make point, specifically chose median get sense ‚Äúthe average American‚Äù experiences.  Sure does. Lots Covid positive people symptoms. shame doors can't opened mid flight. I've dealt share sovereign citizens least tool arrest caused enough problems dad retired research MD he's arguing outset Interferon infusions part treatment arsenal. backs up. wished would wear mask face instead chin practice proper social distancing - recent showing stadium disappointing. problem is, rate testing, unpredictability onset asymptomatic spread duration, possible reinfections/relapses, hard know hotspot fact. fact late reaction. Huh? original post literally said people saying teachers would die FRONT classes. virus serious that‚Äôs insane. might, may worth it. Someone stole black light fixture last year police completely ignored report (and lived tiny town too... ).

And know lots good people, provide context, moved nice neighborhood start pandemic two weeks later car ransacked. hey, got automated police response 3 months, that's good guess?

Sorry I'm downer. love Halloween much really killing spirits. üòî friends Austin Iowa they‚Äôve back 3 times various events (2 weddings, birthday part). Since Covid probably infected handful people China woman got pregnant part reasoning doesn‚Äôt apply. American Public Fauci: would throw first pitch baseball game ever again. I‚Äôve pleasantly surprised well NBA bubble seems working.  situation Brazil. various surveys show Australia top 5, 10, 15 countries quality life Yet Brazil I'd never seen many amazingly expensive luxury cars I'd ever seen richest suburbs Australia.

When growing up, young Australians dreamt US shiny El Dorado everything bigger, better faster. visited worked (in large tech company) always surprised poor everything was. remember one case catching bus, ""misunderstanding"" bus driver fare (my young arrogant self). driver told ""be cool"" things, also worked cop. really surprised me, idea cop earning little money they'd also driver buses. true. admire entrepeneurial spirit, selling something harms people unethical. Well, that's country dumb run crazy-rich megalomaniacs.

There fixed you. anti-mask people like seems like much smaller scale...but feel you, it‚Äôs hard read news coming south. Trump set travel restrictions U.S. set North Korea, Cuba, Mexico orange level. U.K., Western Europe red level.

Calling Texan newyorker calling something something illegimate child...y'all! feel like russians thread  ""Young"" means 18-34 admitted lied masks effective people wouldn‚Äôt buy them.

No, ""admit lied"", used exact sentence seventy five trolls used Reddit, probably link 60 minutes interview admit that, either, claim did.

It obvious everyone, still be, masks USA needed reserved medical staff still do. Notice wearing N95 respirator ballgame, either, cloth He‚Äôs reason many people refuse wear now

The people see refusing wear masks people marching lockstep lynch Fauci daring parrot Trump's nonsense positions, doubt big group. love idea!!! could say around someone Covid positive I‚Äôm
Wearing mask. That‚Äôs also said all. Don‚Äôt force anyone back. Find way make work safely don‚Äôt. immediately say everyone going die consideration alternative. wild pitch last night? Honestly it‚Äôs embarrassing that, middle world wide health emergency; healthcare staff laid furlowed. 

Restaurants expect it‚Äôs luxury begin with. hospitals able pay bills bad look. longer goes on, less want around fellow Americans. I‚Äôm trying remember people (who would make threats, refuse wear masks, etc) loud minority people best. It‚Äôs peer-reviewed though. phrase ""A weight chest"" exists reason. Proud think right. Good luck endeavours! furloughed May told I‚Äôd still position. weeks ago told business may go bankrupt August. yeah, I‚Äôm luck start Yes, time over, would bet it. 

But remember: Worst President. *Yet.* McDonald‚Äôs near take out. dine in. heard one dine yet well way put ‚Äúdoing everything right‚Äù sets bad tone invites faulty premise. Getting coronavirus isn‚Äôt punishment following rules. instance going hospital risky regularly. look whether right, necessary course right. doesn‚Äôt change risk involved though. Adding on...

**46%** today‚Äôs cases tests done 15 days ago. fair amount chance Oxford vaccine might effective humans.

I mean, may effective scale already know effective humans. released data it. to... eat takeout food home ""miserable""? everyone remember post.

The President going increase testing

That we're seeing delays, people getting infected we're hitting limit. 

What mean?

Soon narrative going change ""see curve plateauing!"", false reality, infections simply pace testing look like flattening.

Keep eye hospitalizations numbers coming weeks. Sorry hear that! servers wear masks. really sucks. Brits pretty crazy 5G conspiracies... I‚Äôm sorry. heart hurts yours. want take responsibility weight. Easier blame vague ""corporate interests"" simply eat smaller bowl cereal morning. Get burger fries. Drink bottle water instead bottle soda. really simple one blame, would actually eat less. Nobody *wants* that, food delicious. dying covid pretty great, too.  connection underlying health conditions severe Covid-19 outcomes problematic U.S., many complicating factors prevalent. Commonwealth Fund, independent health-research firm, reported 28% adults U.S. several chronic conditions diabetes heart disease, compared 14% Dutch residents, 17% Germans 18% French.‚Äù

I wish *Wall Street Journal* article included statistics obesity since it‚Äôs major factor severe Covid-19 infection suspect rates much higher US well.  true. less lethal young people still die lasting consequences.

Using young children medical experiments simply crime humanity.
They consent. Yup. something TV communities Northland keeping people reason. hard watch seeing badly hit Spanish Flu.

Good taking hands. ""funny"" people vocal abuses CCP's committed turning around &amp; doing/supporting *pretty similar* things, &amp; pretty much copying CCP *severe* underreporting COVID's true extent &amp; impact. gonna take serious change losername poor man gotten many death threats needs security. Y‚Äôall got last laugh tho, pretty sure king George laughing grave fucked lol solution neither shaming giving nice role-models asking nicely.

The solution police fining people. hurts bank account people change behavior. may ran ligma function get data tho heard long ago another reason chip would get information like blood type, heartrate, oxygen levels, reading blood sugar somehow figure eat, eat/where eat. I'm biology expert, imagine there's million things going body microchip pick on. I've also heard chip could programmed shut someone down, disable them, kill them, elite hold heads. know I'm thinking way sci-fi dystopian novel world.

Goddamnit.

Yeah, would baby fine COVID-19? straw broke camel's back?

Emily Oster's book Cribsheet breaks SIDS risk bunch different factors, smoking HUGE one. Could COVID caused similar issues makes SIDS much easier happen? Like, know SIDS happens, know happens often certain behaviors.

I literally asked proof. any, no? project hard buddy. 

So since cant prove saying whatsoever, ill stick fact Cuomo effective governor USA response COVID.

If disagree, bring proof, already lose, kid. shame Fauci deal pandemic divided political environment. never would thought America would deal crisis embarrassing self-destructive manner. would helpful explain logic. I've heard mention kids affected coronavirus much adults. kids get parents sick.

It kinda seems like doctor says smoke two packs day situation.

If came said country needs economic reasons least would understandable. Although large portion people incorrectly look anything economic simply lining pockets rich people. think understand. alcoholic cannot get daily dose potentially deadly situation.  *Anything** does. interest fucking them. evicting non paying deadbeat renters property. ones broke agreement. emotional - business.

I'm saying one yet found solution poverty. poor people everywhere, including richest places.

I saying poorest Americans usually vastly better people world. Everything depends compare to. Nothing exists vacuum. Well China care hate crimes racism they're booming. large numbers immigrants like Asians Australia discussion like one trying have. things slow China down. Almost Asian countries ethnostates China successful example. Yet Asians like complain racism West championing racist governments Asia. look post history. Western governments need like China disregard discussions like favor national unity. Everybody already knows detrimental consequences online education social isolation. Nobody *wants* this‚Äîevery teacher know would much rather back classroom, assuming weren‚Äôt likely catch potentially deadly virus. 

The problem nation chose poorly decided open bars, restaurants, etc. summer mask mandates, allowed virus spread unchecked prevented in-person schooling. ever happened ‚Äúparty personal responsibility‚Äù loves lecture people consequences shitty decisions? Cyber security  That, lot institutions, loan volume down, deposits up. People spending money. ""whacks"" capital ratios various institutions. 

Plus, since people spending money, ""fee"" income (ODP, bounce check fees, etc) WAY down, right wrong, helps keep smaller credit unions community blanks black.

There's going huge need type regulatory relief NCUA/FDIC things improve. large population kids home-schooled within US? studies indicating impacted adversely? so, now? son alone day work home. interacts family friends virtually. reads books rest time gets by. substitute real classroom? No. see son learned live lifestyle. impact short term? Yes forgot gets 3rd grade things go back normal? Probably. worth put others risk this? No. address mental well-being? parents addressing concerns explaining seriousness situation compensating ways. kid misses friends enjoys extra time spends parents. Holy shit learn something new every day. Thanks! FYI weekends useless mode - first makes REALLY wanna go back work mean point quit, youd rather stay working 2 days means youre gonna 2 days shit piled due overworking situation less employees.....Youd rather keep working keep regular...... actually probably billions per day lost economically. GDP $20 Trillion. So, every day (1/365th) ""worth"" $54 Billion. Forecasts GDP growth -7% year rather 2% growth. So, would $4.9 Billion lost per day. 

Actually, January February fairly normal, probably like $6 Billion lost per day Covid part year. Pretty crazy, huh? Fuck me, next we'll hear Trump say ""Covid tremendous threat need eradicate &amp; vaccinate."" OMG MANY PEOPLE MUST EXPOSED VIRUS NOW!!!!!! changing boarders didn‚Äôt realize big deal. Compassion. Learn it.  Yeah, feel like glossed part. COVID really kill children. children really spread either. extremely extremely rare. ""He die COVID, diagnosed mild case COVID, recovered. died old age"". - Stephen Miller. Thats minimum period. If, if, area meets specific criteria advance next stage. need everywhere lockdown initial period.

Much northeast would firm 2 wk stay home, getting back towards phased reopening. link thread chance? I‚Äôm morbidly fascinated too. family forever broken. parents going cope fact daughter killed parents  sub nutshell sometimes. Good lord Yeah help read comments article one wonders schools ever open US. Well, honest, nothing racism ensuring children continue learn.

Further, two survey's I've seen two different county's parents overwhelming showed white parents wanted children back school Black Hispanic parents 50%. white parents wanted children back school fulltime one minor portion form hybrid system. Black Brown didn't. doubt wealthy parents underlying view ""well, want system fine drag kids system work last time.""

It something agree knew going happen. Meaning affluent parent ensure children continue get educated children less affluent parents would left behind. one reasons said children school fulltime parts country raging dumpster fires. \^ here. Church Street since March. Tourists college kids flock without masks (and also Vermonters hate masks).

Whereas food shelf near allow anyone grab food unless they're wearing mask, volunteers need masks/gloves whole set up/takedown time. (Plus maintain 6 ft away patrons.)

However, one online forums, Vermonter built 120 foot slip n' slide invited general public it. post blew up. TONS college kids - came back state, seemed stoked. smh. However, last heard, 10 idiots attended, turned naked slip n' slide. wanted to? mortality rate going learn more. 
What forces people wear mask people feel isn‚Äôt choice. best way get people wear mask education. worst way government compel them. Mate blows lid ay... Americans arms this. Ive read businesses receiving millions, actually cut staff CEOs etc could pocket money. Trickle economics work! serves top  ain't buddy, pal. (Actually am, stay safe, hope get reference) I‚Äôm also due end September agree, pandemic completely sucked joy pregnancy. Nothing like finding you‚Äôre pregnant whole world fall apart. 

Hugs one pregnant momma another. Thanks posting yet another reason comparison useless first place. Old news, plan blame BLM Protests Democrats. duration also financial risk. Large clinical trials expensive ""normal times"" anyways want start small group people use larger larger groups look safety efficacy mitigate risk fails early whatever reason. 

Even if/when vaccine licensed, there's usually gap hits market allow manufacturing (building new/repurposing facilities, qualifying equipment, actually manufacturing millions doses, performing quality control testing) - bother going expense manufacturing millions doses hand certain going get regulatory approval? 

For companies making SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, they're either using existing technology established safety efficacy profiles (which lowers regulatory burden saves time) they're getting grants/contracts/etc governments mitigate financial risk perform steps time (like manufacturing even necessarily finished clinical trials) - combination two. Okay well things 1. much money ALREADY GONE military stock market shutdown 2. billionaires combined still enough wealth contribute shutdown even wealth stock market. looked Jeff Bezos net worth 178.2 billlion. countries done proper shutdowns less money there‚Äôs reason can‚Äôt Basically Pro tip - make deodorant (original) milk magnesia.

Hence said:
 shit situation.
 
Look, I've lived tough economic times. wife (then girlfriend) collected recyclables could redeem extra bucks pay food - addition working jobs. found way make work. Unfortunately people get left behind I'm saying that's good right fair, merely case.
 
I surprised one important lessons take away one seems learning:
 
**You responsible family. things go shit, government there, fellow citizens there, one nothing there. would wise plan happen.** Individual states don‚Äôt right shutdown borders Fuck you. One choice involves many deaths, involves inconvenience education amount time... seems like easy choice me. Relatively anyway. kind stupid never self aware. National Guard would needed places civil unrest like protests, Portland ahem....yeah theyre either....what gives? seen Portland sneaky HoMeland Security agents, naked lady, bunch parents singing ‚Äúnanny nanny boo boo‚Äù tone...... definitely plenty idiots here, Conservative party doesn‚Äôt really represent them, fringe parties like UKIP BNP.

Our mainstream right wing party conservatives make US Democratic Party look centre right. still want social democracy, still want universal healthcare (although like reduce funding it), want social safety net (although want spend less money it), want immigration (but less it, control it).

They‚Äôre still much right wing party, still don‚Äôt care much working class poor. It‚Äôs mainstream right wing party, semi mainstream centrist party, mainstream left wing party. move around spectrum bit years, never far. US Democrats (probably would considered centrist here) Republicans (probably would considered extreme right hate group here). Yet keeps fighting matter thrown him. good thing Covid didnt kill live done. One could hope vacation over, stop traveling country, numbers start falling again. Atleast amount hospitalizations stable (and low that) saying complex problem. agree many factors leading obesity, personal level solution incredibly simple. also make easy. moving eating less ultimately way lose weight. fucking nut bags Everything tried court public opinion.

If Senate brings bill floor passes it, Republicans stop it.

By default, one challenges it, bill stand.

And Republicans challenge it. make legal argument court public case media.

Genuinely, weird hung things politicians give damn about. ‚ÄúbUt MuH fReEdUmBs...‚Äù

Honestly super surprised, good  Remember comparing entire flu season one week covid January? sad. feel really disappointed. Look Fauci Gates. accused crazy made conspiracy theories people idea happening even put little effort help humanity fight virus. really sad! someone explain American Politicians pushing school return business usual? I‚Äôm trying figure gain I‚Äôm seeing think it‚Äôs kind conspiracy entire world political reason, don‚Äôt use common sense.  many fallacies argument like:

- disease spreads humans naturally somehow better manipulated lab. Right scientists simply don‚Äôt technical ability- hence cases come wildlife sources. Please send us source scientist able take virus tweak it‚Äôs internal structure lab much deadly humans I‚Äôve never seen heard that.

- saying Covid-19 unusual spreading humans well.

But today see BBC news: ""Boris Johnson says ‚Äúopen questions‚Äù whether coronavirus lockdown came late."" least admitting mistakes rather doubling dumb like many national leaders. Plus face mask legally required shops since today, even though everything late 45k confirmed deaths may still hope yet.

That's good overweight 5 years, &amp; always great active. family really pushes being-active thing, I've trying go walks &amp; stuff.

Maybe could voice concerns doctor regards really bringing overweight? Remember, guy ventilator Corona. Guess learned something.. lmfao damn really hard time admitting wrong, ego fragile can't even try defend points Ok explain death rate declining even lagging behind new cases?

And go ahead explain ""new cases"" seems informal benchmark well poorly country handling virus.

My explanation simple, testing identifying asymptomatic people. testing less death, that's hoping numbers bear out. many dead teachers acceptable you? No, he's still fucking ballbag cares economy people's lives. He's giving everyone nurses pay rises. Oh NHS going sold made private we're screwed. It‚Äôs federal system clear division powers, much like Canada Australia. systems generally good large diverse countries, well structured emergency situations requiring unified national response.

Clearly trolling hair prone split ends I'll need get least trim soon, lest split tip root. started happening yet, though, I'll put little longer. course won't. Even vaccine available end year, government completely fail getting us.

They fucked testing, fucked PPE, fucked mask requirements, fuck vaccine? Hes wrong never super enthusiastic it, save maybe single market, pro-remain initially. also tried expand British extra clauses like UK rebate.

It didn't, many movable patients moved outside hotspot relieve system everyone allowed intesive care except people intubated health complications.

A old people poor health transported home hospital, would complicated emergency service required manpower. another lockdown hundreds thousands possible millions would starve. sending hate mail?

might worth send fan letters well expressing support thankfulness :-) freedom association. White House intentionally weak - checks balances. POTUS order lockdown via executive order, chances would struck unconstitionall. theory, branch federal government ordering lockdown *should* unconstitutional - rights belong exclusively states. 

In practice, changed FDR. president favored big government, 4 terms. 16 years president, appointed justices Supreme Court president nation's history. Big government president gonna appoint big government judges, big government judges gonna spend rest careers expanding size power federal government. Congress *were* pass sort legislation ordering lockdown, likely SCOTUS would usually do, use commerce clause justify expansion power federal government. 

The current status quo, Congress basically regulate anything *potentially* affect inter-state commerce. example, ban marijuana justified *could* sold state lines, somehow makes banning people would never attempt take pot across state lines growing home - simply *could* trafficked state lines, thus affect interstate commerce. means possible, make likely. 70 percent 330 million again?

Mail voting attacked probably knows Dems would rather stay inside avoid confrontation either virus, MAGA drones going crowding polling stations. matter experts say people deny say shred evidence ""fake news"".

We're serious trouble Trump reelected November.... took test determine disability TBI Afghanistan. obese can't walk far. RES-tagged ""Angry Simpleton"" months ago. proven wrong yet. even little echo chambers links threads like one ever upvotes.  
It's kinda sad, honestly. Nah, worst ones act like care economy extended lockdown negatively affect people yet want absolutely nothing even opposite improve situation. 

Many countries citizens swallowed bitter pills went lockdown reopened cases brought bare minimum. countries (see NZ, Singapore, South Korea, Malaysia etc.) since reopened, schools included. common trend countries shared strong decisive leadership listened health experts. bad seems lacking US.

Anyway, sorry long post. wanted rant Trump handled COVID protests, know anyone still think absolute failure that's unfit office. also inferred Mt. Sinai study almost 20,000 people. Barely difference 3 months. Oh, put average 14-16 hour days first month weekdays least 5 hours weekend. 1/4 effective. online extended hours hard me. paperwork involved big killer, change rewrite 25 IEPs completely reinvent schedule services multiple staff students. think teachers generally work long hours, rarely truly pull 16 hour days. 12 happen fairly regularly. hard. experience varied teachers districts. know teachers told direct contact felt like time hands. full online services 5 days prep it. Lunacy. grateful opportunity work safely. often felt guilty feeling frustrated gave reality check. relatives work health care hotspots. much worse did. change, I‚Äôm pretty nervous it. area active cases moment. also healthcare access without taking plane. spreads going trouble. it‚Äôs great now, outbreak bad place be. 

Yes, catch things. Kids germy. don‚Äôt particularly want catch this. It‚Äôs significantly worse normal crud get kids. probably start remote unless numbers drastically change. don‚Äôt think every location situation plans vary. don‚Äôt think let virus spread, well, like virus schools. lot people die. Depends Canada. Vancouver pretty much back normal Ontario gone stage 3 today, parts except Toronto surrounding regions. think deeper problem apparently, American society / economy can't function kids going school 6 months. I'd like believe country resilient apparently not. problem becomes come state many people can't afford survive without income 2-4 months, many parents can't afford make living order survive school open. many children. absolutely love halloween, actually afraid decorating year. worried people shaming ""poor taste"" worse, vandalizing decorations. People acting irrational, see happening. I'm curious others feel it. Yeah, think buy argument Tegnell's way presented there. One can't exactly compare percentages. example, recall, 100% New Zealand's deaths 60 maybe even 70. mean super failed protect elders?

No, one first compare per capita deaths, check there. Sweden's deaths per capita high, deaths elderly. Thus, Sweden would've fewer deaths protected elders better.

I say that's Sweden's failure though - also late react, slow respond, constitution prevented hard lockdown. considered, could've lowered deaths per capita high least mildly high failed protect elders. fair say Sweden failed execute strategy properly. Hopefully accurate current tests! Unfortunately, plenty people. Even Florida hot spot, people still trying go vacation there. cities hotspots, many residents acting like things normal. problem is, reading articles virus, easy ignore cause seeing what's going hospitals people keeling streets hacking lung right front you. Plague doctor! Oh definitely, society whole US makes easy get fat. know gut biome plays role terms calories absorbed food. US food system unhealthy levels. choices fast food, frozen food, etc, bad too. faster ways cook, overworked parents holding two jobs, hard still.

Visited Japan last august. Public transport goes everywhere still lot walking. Portions smaller. 'fast food' healthier, less processed. Udon shops, soba shops, etc. documentary ""Miso Hungry"" overweight Australian comedian, starts shedding weight soon lands japan. literally pissing away. 

The premade meals convenience stores, smaller portion sizes, lot choices, balanced. food Japanese consider 'bad'.

So I've trying consider western diet change. I'm big fan mediterranean, foods bother me. know there. say eat fish, vegetables, especially root. lot less animal protein. totally plausible seems people overlooked differences ""businessman"" ""successful businessman."" It‚Äôs funny, say that, risk contracting COVID, she‚Äôs actually much better physical mental health ever since pregnancy &amp; subsequent lockdown. one, longer extreme pain due chronic endometriosis whatever reason‚Äîthe fact able get pregnant *two* forms birth control miracle. another, she‚Äôs longer extremely gluten-sensitive eat whatever wants (whereas she‚Äôd get nauseous/throw drop hat).

Lastly, caring understanding partner, who‚Äôll anything make sure she‚Äôs safe, heathy entertained home... oh, family ain‚Äôt bad either! :D

That said, yeah, risk contracting COVID definitely hangs us like specter whole situation definitely would‚Äôve better without (have ever attended baby shower Zoom? It‚Äôs... *interesting* lol). said, ain‚Äôt *all* bad there‚Äôs definitely good come this. facility got blood drawn last year felt less tense environment diner ate weeks ago. first instinct eat quickly, might well go take out, I‚Äôve done often pre-pandemic. feels little better around server staff usually remaining owner maybe someone else weekend. get two regular less-awkward meals, usually token tip, rather one, less-enjoyable one tip profusely (former food service workers unite!) unsure coming back. suppose sub words.

For example.

I really wish functioning... carpet... many... jellybeans holding livelihoods hostage.

No, article trying comment politics portion ""common people"", commenting huge wealth stratification country degree everyone economic elite left fend themselves. Neither things true degree ""rich countries"", example western countries social safety net including type universal health care, see [these (found much less U.S. income share goes bottom 50% compared E.U. always way, see graph inequality U.S. 1980 vs 2014 (and change solely fault Republicans, Democrats gotten chummy corporate financial sectors they've contributed trends plenty well, see [this example) CDC pushing White House agenda seems. First pushing send kids back school, this. guess didn‚Äôt like data rerouted caved Great mental aerobics Yeah even kid going back school fall. Exactly. buddy past weekend tell refuses wear mask asthma can't breath one on. Called bullshit asked show exactly mask would block constrict airways. explanation mask could suffocate him, saying ''yes does''. tried showing multiple articles videos proving opposite claimed, still good enough. ''I can't breath mask on'' could say.

I asked able go skiing regularly winter. Plenty photos online wearing ski mask he's ripping slopes. told that's different since going downhill wind forcing way lungs. 

After eye-rolled that, asked major breathing issues, smoke weed everyday? all, concerned breathing airways, risk damage smoking regularly. reason could given stomping foot claiming masks make suffocate.

I love friend death, sometimes accept fact people stupid unfortunately one them. everyone gets smart critical thinking skills. Stupid people live among us pandemic brought open. always gets cold time take home take out. Yes, COVID worse Ebola. woman employee get contract wrestling opportunity video went viral tackling shoplifter(or something)?


Some might love opportunity. Interesting. favorite influencers party face masks merch still can‚Äôt bothered wear one. That's planes oxygen masks. /s Clearly, mean nobody wants chip body :D fingers crossed, far think would seen many reinfections statistically speaking. knows look like year now. small-time landlords impacted, ones single unit. bigger guys get loans keep afloat, come back post-pandemic buy distressed properties cheap.

It's almost impossible truly wealthy ever lose. Well, Walmart says wants increase number mask-wearers, satisfied achieved goal. Fine, way making truly mandatory... like one shop Walmart, something can't admit to, go headlong enforcement. Meanwhile, local stores less teeth, managed stop unmasked customers entry.

I would relatively fine...but there's one particular made two layers thicker cloth, sucks face breathe normal conditions. I'd strugglin' unit tried sort weight lifting running one. talk that.  European aspects US coverage seem completely alien. Italy worse news constantly plastered videos images inside hospitals. Covid wards full, doctors nurses rushing everywhere full partial PPE, corridors full beds sick patients waiting ward space etc.

I read lack footage US due private hospital system. private, commercial properties allow 3rd party filming want release footage. consequence US news media can't properly display healthcare crisis way nation's media can. Deadliest day, far. FUCKING KIDDING maskless twats, gone. 

I trying get mom flying NYC bringing home plane. need get license learn drive. go get her, isnt alone anymore. 

We making sacrifices. Charter private plane entitled twats. Every single one mask whiners. COVID going teach fuckers sense, 6 feet wondering gonna mentioned! Gotta account Misery (Missouri)! ""That timeline add all.""

Well that's pretty brazen lie People need learn socialize remotely while, outdoors. option. Adults able handle this. reason hear Bill Murray ghost busters talking apocalypse head That‚Äôs Gary Busey Anecdotally, buying lot ice cream normal (typically halo top sometimes need get Ben Jerry's). probably spending deodorant buy nicer natural deodorant like smell more. Remember LA hosted international marathon 25,000 people couple days declaring coronavirus emergency?

Ya. So, hold on: really trying tell watched happened NY, NJ, MA, CA, WA others March April, read stories Trump mocking it, Trump told states get PPE promptly told govenment seize shipments, want help Feds?

I'm assuming TX, guys benefit watching northeast get slammed spring, also info contain spread. told guys listen asshole governor forged ahead recklessly reopening, literally TOLD guys going happen - want Trump pull orange face ass help you?

I know trying understand, know probably scared what's going around you, federal government give even half fuck helping states pandemic. watching Trump administration's response right now, literally it: watch country choke air supply. Ron DeSantis mouth permanently attached Trump's ass, even getting help. partisan allegiance gotten us. 

Your option take care yourself, stay inside, wear mask every time set foot outside house. feds coming. case noticed, Trump wearing mask now, election focus on, that's ever mattered him. want different response, make sure Trump assholes like Abbott voted chance. virus chance coming home every time someone leaves house. guarantee even schools closed, virus still transmitting. Americans dum it‚Äôs fricking unbelievable. Unbelievable. case fast zombie virus would argue improvement:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great, look lively grandpa trying eat grandchildren! seen move like twenty years; it‚Äôs like bad hip doesn‚Äôt even bother anymore!‚Äù guy survived nuclear apocalypse post apocalypse. Yup can‚Äôt trust highly respected, apolitical scientist doctor proven right time time again.

We trust huge narcissist lengthy track record lies deceit tells us drinking bleach probably good solution Covid.

GTFO. general idea parents need return work boost economy. I'm opinion right approach bad public health measures bad economy, lot politicians seem really fixated it. they're lights aight. keep seeing local businesses say ""if wearing mask, assume medical reason due HIPAA inquire.""

It makes fucking insane. Nice, sadly, can't reason stupidity. It‚Äôs containing virus. Kids become vectors virus spread. Sure many fine. bring shit home. hard understand. Unless you‚Äôre short sighted can‚Äôt see anything beyond nose. coaches see season positive test one less test positive season. think seeing quickly things go hell one party, one game, one practice, hell even one person's trip concussion tent.

 get light headed quite often excuse pull mask. 
 wonder related? still wear one complain always easy. 

 still think people refuse wear mask babies. seen young children wearing *correctly* many adults don't. young children even need wear them.

Oh wait Wow rode spirit airlines??? ran several 10k mask on. totally doable. can‚Äòt hike mask on, see doctor asap. grand scheme things actually weird long smoking takes actually kill you. Average life expectancy smoker US 64, 14 years shorter national average. Well LOT people un politics lack empathy.

It‚Äôs legit bad. like Remember, right Brexit well. /s 2 kids fine home. point would rather family healthy. Kids eventually catch up.  that's argument, it? They're never arguing N95 masks, they're arguing cloth medical masks. Breath top. shove mouth try. Harder breather =/= cut oxygen supply. reducing amount oxygen air, affecting lungs ability exchange oxygen CO2 air. strong diaphragm/abdominal breathing muscles are. Like muscle group, wearing one bit strengthen it'll easier time. Seriously, grow pots. flavor difference amazing  layman crash plane 100/100 times.

Officer shoot him, gun hit bullets. always wash hands eating. Crisis actors playing dead. bussing inside cooler trucks. Andrew Wakefield didn‚Äôt contradict though, said statements pretty meaningless hopes happen. interesting hot take, agree you, something definitely done special treatment boosters local communities players (under table money, exoneration obvious crimes, jobs go better qualified applicants, etc) win top health official pessimistic. Look around world. many countries beaten covid zero death. Please put someone competent Fauci's place.

I even know start many countries beaten covid zero death.

Yes, places like that. countries direct experience serious epidemics like SARS MERS planned do. countries willing listen scientists people experience willing put pain effort get control.

Trump's America? much. government threw pandemic playbook. ignored results pandemic preparedness exercise. withdrew CDC expert China. dismantled pandemic preparedness committee. work dismantling ACA, people get kind illness afraid bills get treated.

They deny there's problem. say tests perfect. say anyone get test. say plot political enemies. say it'll go away own. promote miracle cures like drug destabilizes heart rhythms, injecting bleach, exposure light damages eyes within seconds causes cancer.

They say supplies reserve, say states greedy ask some. tell states hospitals they're getting supplies, steal whatever supplies places *do* manage source, turn supplies ""favored"" companies run cronies sell supplies back huge mark-up. completely abdicate leadership responsibility: *Nah, looks like hard one, someone else figure out.*

They ""defer"" scientists, undermine scientists scientists simply report actual science mostly-real data. toss scientists sidelines, tell people listen them, start lying data says and, things start get really bad, start hiding data.

They get followers decry pandemic hoax political enemies, hold rallies pressure states open state things place keep virus control, claim economy important people's lives understand people want die nebulous idea ""economy"", claim mask-wearing simply ""virtue signaling"" liberals.

But sure, yeah, let's blame someone who's worked studied infectious diseases entire life, who's given best advice science time, updated advice based scientific evidence, ignored derided turn people determined listen.

**Covid-19 behave like viruses comes immunity.**

**Anders Tegnell stated today's press conference.**

**- starting become hesitant whether ever get really good feeling immunity looks like population.** 

Immunity agenda today's press conference Swedish Public Health Agency. recently yesterday, [Anders stated everyone infected coronavirus form immunity.

\- see people fall ill twice covid-19, state epidemiologist said then.

But immunity population level discussed today's press conference, less cross-confident Anders Tegnell answered journalists' questions.

\- quite clear much difficult measure population immunity covid-19 diseases measles, rubella things. predictable, spreads unevenly, says Tegnell. 

## herd immunity

Yesterday, company Werlabs published results last three weeks antibody testing. showed 14.5 percent antibodies Stockholm. Gothenburg, corresponding figure 15.1 per cent Malm√∂ 8 per cent - far herd immunity which, despite stated goal part Swedish Public Health Agency, strongly linked Swedish corona strategy.

When asked disappointing Public Health Agency seem possible measure herd immunity, state epidemiologist says:

\- would course nice could measure good way. proved difficult, perhaps even impossible, go back traditional ways look spread looks like reality. see spread infection going down.

## Antibodies everything

Anders Tegnell also believes one stare blindly antibodies.

\- signals fairly large proportion immune without antibodies. know large proportion is, talk anything 20-30 percent upwards 100 percent more, says adds:

\- becoming hesitant whether ever get really good feeling immunity looks like population, therefore becomes important look development new cases. wear mine run, think makes negative difference breathing. pull I'm near people notice boost breathing.

Wet drenched water. Going remove children would born fat, old, diabetics. sound like many children. sound worth this. he, chance, lost brother Trump? yeah carrots slap. vegetables arent same.   Everyone says ""why Sth Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam well? must Buddhist"". Yeah, maybe.

 also note trust Chinese much. know someone went college played pickup basketball once.

US: manage little outbreak, restrict hard.

A months later...

Also, keep mind original, nonhuman variant virus still exists nature. managed mutate adapt infect humans, there's reason can't again, different mutations. yes triage is. China Vietnam pretty free COVID deniers. blame game again.. astounding. wiki article German compatible life

That one way formulate ""Obama thanks this."" - Trump next month prob Technically speaking won‚Äôt die, exposure level way higher COVID deniers likely poor health overall, good chunk least getting sick likely. Personally hope get sick suffer, don‚Äôt die, develop better sense. children children develop better sense abandon grow up. DeSantis nothing Florida burns. Honestlly wonder much [this helped.

We're going continue advise, we're going impose type criminal penalties. think would effective.""

[Gov. DeSantis downplays state reporting daily record 173 COVID-19 deaths, cites positive America first!  Korean-American here. I've pretty uncomfortable moments past months worried parents + elderly vulnerable. man driving past dad's car gave middle finger blocks away home happened ever him. feel safe walking around simple errands NY. We've experienced fair share racism US racism we've experienced past months feels specific dehumanizing. worst racism experienced overt kid there's part can't believe shit happening 2020. people pro-mask realistic understanding COVID situation generally like Fauci point. too. However, remember day 60 Minutes interview came said people need wear masks, downplaying need basically mocking use them. knew would problem line, well, still is, anti-maskers cite EVERY day evidence masks necessary.  


What supposed say? Honestly, Fauci fucked there. directly come said ""I wrong said 60 Minutes""? Because, seriously, anyone plugged anti-maskers routinely cite say matter knows one cited videos anti-maskers prove masks work needed. Fauci ever come said specifically wrong said that? poll numbers thing could said virus probably wont kill you.
Edit: Look scared little children believe hide virus clothe masks


This said couple comments Sherpa?   doctor? guys fun One communist might make Xinnie Pooh angry.

If ur burger flipper US, get work die 1% catch COVID stay home go broke meaning losing home 100%

Florida‚Äôs Rt value barely dipped one. It‚Äôs like wanna permanently keep 1 point. Wtf, headline...

Today reality way beyond satire governor, president individual citizens chose path.   
   
These deaths were/are preventable.  
Masks, distance, hand washing. Simple.   
I guess ‚Äúthou shall kill‚Äù doesn‚Äôt apply case.   
Or maybe god contact tracing keeping score. Didnt spike sometimes wear single use reusable ones usually reusable ones (not sure material top head). I'm talking reusable ones case.

Don't usually check weather. think actual temps usually around feelslike temps definitely 100.

Fauci ‚Äúyeah masks good‚Äù 

America ‚Äúokie‚Äù

Fauci ‚Äúactually lied, needed medical professionals‚Äù

America ‚Äú that‚Äôs understandable ... say we‚Äôre mandating PPE goes health care professionals pulled shelves? tell us make ? ‚Äú

Fauci ‚Äúwhy country failing ? won‚Äôt listen experts ?‚Äù Medical error 3rd leading cause death US, killing 250,000 people *every diseases kill order magnitude more.

I know would suggest criminalize chips quarantine doctors, think that‚Äôs bit extreme. virus 99.8% people survive similarly doesn‚Äôt justify house arrests mandatory face diapers. would add ‚Äúcleaning fee‚Äù checkout post someone front warn everyone it.

You deserve better Lowe's, btw. tell already degree English journalism, articulate. Sorry really loved working there, gotta say - economy needs you, need work somewhere else intelligence put better use! Patience, probably actual breakthrough progress untik late august/september think pointless discussion unless show masks wear. cloth masks make difference breathing kn95 masks make breaths really short get strong sensation chest I‚Äôm getting enough air often raise side slightly briefly let air in. masks different. Jet ski across Pacific ocean Yeah. Hmmmm I'm sure perhaps phase 2 trials info (extended safety tests)  Sorry came way believe equality way like person giving credits one side every side things do. Given disease around long while, that's realistic. People situation taking major precautions sometimes travel unavoidable. Business need make reasonable adjustments allow disabled people travel. surprised hasn‚Äôt blamed Jews. know cut oxygen?

Coronavirus   absolutely though. Cloth masks shitty surgical masks, sure, breathe fine. wearing n95 kn95 you‚Äôll quickly get sensation chest feel like can‚Äôt quite get enough air. breathe, it‚Äôs much reduced breaths proper seal. coming say 2020 made r/thathappened plausible. strangest timeline Starlink doctors opinion would can‚Äôt wear mask consistently appropriately still needs medical care.   fuck supposed wear mask lit cigarette, huh? light mask fire.

&amp;#x200B;

/s  happened Orange county California,  You‚Äôre right‚Äîny numbers go back up. 22 kids, 14 left city March. They‚Äôre mostly along east coast, FL (many families FL). also kid Israel one Korea summer . come back school opens, even low numbers now, Sept shit show. percentage tick back up, quickly. 

Thanks making decision keep kids home. know homeschooling impossibly hard appreciate looking family, community. 

Your message one empathetic gotten. Thanks. worked ASS finally get place idea utilized skills, passions all. took years arrive new found mentality! took year even break mainstream, finally started getting good calls mobile computer repair, word mouth started spreading good! went nothing, 1 call every 2 weeks, 2 calls every week, 4 5 calls every week 3 monthly maintenance plans , one BIG roofing contractor account. going pretty steady tbh you....

then? hit...i forced shutdown take break. took wind sails, maybe best KIND getting burnt maybe didnt want anymore.  holy shit money rolling. got shit completely lol. really fucked confidence levels. seems life tbh you. every single time often not, something goes good me..something..something somewhere happens fucks royally. life odd. like im cursed.

so w/e. I'll think do. I'll keep working restaurant I'm that's lol. look 7 day average cases stopped growing last week. course main question why? really hope shady shit. already know fired someone trying state real numbers chasing supposed fake numbers. point would put past cook books. not, really interesting see continues why.

On hand deniers favorite stat deaths continue rise need shift focus one. baby July 9th. Let's say family longer speak us simply told hold newborn must wear mask wash hands. father runs business traveling north east employees work wear mask, included. top employees audacity call brainwashed com*&amp;# wearing mask working enclosed building. reference inventories car dealerships parts departments social distancing. newborns health number one priority anyone mocks frowns upon us taking care child suck dick! fly less month class. really really would rather drive, cannot. hard enough time going grocery store. Hoping class gets canceled highly doubt will.  person gave gold... like you. Ohioan, really hope happens. Maybe drag Dewine right direction too. viruses also tendency become less lethal time, either due mutations (highly lethal virus strains tend burn quickly), or, C19's case, due better treatments / etc (plasma transfusions, etc)

fatality rates *definitely* higher earlier hit areas (wuhan, italy, NY), b/c areas got hit earlier, *and* b/c C19 gets lot lethal hospitals overwhelmed / ppl get put triage (ie. NY, italy) Jokes them, nowhere's safe right agree part. people can, responsible money, lose jobs ride pandemic without going bankrupt, especially generous unemployment benefits feds. feel like people camp good reason asking handouts.

I think lot people barely get matter careful spending, need help stay afloat losing jobs. Base unemployment benefits woefully inadequate lot places. people protected eviction.

That said, reliably differentiating one government level seems difficult. We'll either give much people need it, give enough people really need it. conclusion got expert viruses like Fauci thought 100% safe talk friend removing mask. think agree Fauci would never put friend's health danger, right?

Therefore, assume tests inconclusive get infected right got negative COVID result, stands question Fauci believe necessary put back mask talking friend.

Why think is? Could Fauci smart man knows ridiculously low IFR COVID? know, number media keeps ""forgetting"" report on? Because, else would Fauci something like this? and? I'm friends Walmart worker. ""When found closed Thanksgiving outraged worried black friday. Yeah....because bunch people getting sick worth 30% tv"" they're irate.  point wear masks eat restaurant, people eating then.(I'm anti mask think implementation kind consolation prize sometimes) OLD, good ‚Äúnews‚Äù. Im waiting progress research. Lets hope best. Fsuchi joke coward Yeah that‚Äôs doofus raw bat Yeah I've got family dummy camp. vaccine progression promising eventually people careful contract it. Doctors get better treating it. think 9 months lot time things improve. Look everyone! got us one people actually reads article! telling new parents dangers co-sleeping newborns?  Yeah extremely obvious comments read article didn't. crazy NC still hasn‚Äôt hit number deaths *once*. 

I‚Äôm sorry Kemp. :( Nah im pretty sure still scheduled every week 2 weeks fired libtards think everyone right anti science? perfect example acting like idiot underhanded see time Johnson going scandal bus plastered lie Brexit lie exposed. 

In linked interview tells obvious lie hobby painting buses silly way.

You might thinking underhanded that, well looked Boris buses time interview would come scandal.

Obviously many people figured time looked fool.

There examples similar things get point, glancing Boris looks sometimes acts fool look closer, find intelligent unethical person. what's next, Rees-Mogg using modern terminology?  Curbside pickup delivery only. Problem solved Considering phases US went since beginning this, answer is: Minus one half year Eh, read article think fact many traveled game another city (‚Äúin buses, cars, trains,‚Äù article says‚Äù), actual event. think winner eyes watering rest day. 76 passengers $324k $4,500 average; think missed zero somewhere. Yes, virus *could* negative long-term effects, it‚Äôs also equally likely *won‚Äôt*. 

I understand you‚Äôre saying, diseases long-term effects. fact: point, everybody country going encounter virus. Everybody. could even years now. point, everyone encounter virus. might make person sick, might anything all. given contagious virus is, think point it‚Äôs little bit foolish expect possibility people hide run forever. teacher, exposed flu virus multiple times year, minimum. times 25% class absent flu. Sometimes, kids talking close day come flu, hand papers, sneeze cough around me. exposed virus, enter body, mean going get sick it. Cove way. Although appears much serious disease flu, appears close 80% people come contact virus never develop symptoms, even test positive it.

It‚Äôs easy problem easy solutions. think it‚Äôs bit ridiculous point time expect everyone keep social distancing. People absolutely losing asses financially. Covid severe Spanish flu, Ebola, anthrax, opinion would different. simply deadly people make be. It‚Äôs virus kills three every 1000 people contracted, 85% people die age 65. don‚Äôt think warrants shutting country long-term. even short term point. Shhh! Bill doens't want us talking that! She‚Äôs mad tested covid wants fight it? Wtf , embarrassed husband caught democratic hoax virus. type stupidity surreal landlords take savings renters don‚Äôt any? can‚Äôt expect live anywhere free. Eh. hard read lines there. He‚Äôs pretty much agreeing trying get trouble WH restaurant sitting every mandate saftey protocol exists....


Don't take all. lose every single day sick leave we're acquired years. sick days get use paid maternity leave. read end story Isaac. Got completely wrong message, embarassing faux pas. told us masks prevent spread virus knew fact would. feels strange living Michigan seeing every state surrounding us share border hitting 1,000+ cases day seemed plateaued around 500 600 daily cases. case China showed, even 6 feet adequate inside. Oh, praising bravery? way clear haha.

Yes, agree, even hazmat suit, working infectious disease something people brave enough do. Must take lot balls controversial /s. even news worthy. Barely relates corona virus either. Although doubt would hear something like trump. read headline. find hard believe. stat take costs like healthcare account? Zero percent population Europe risk bankruptcy illness. basic direction want people believe lol.

Inconvenience education amount time. LOL. Lets forget retarded development young kids, employment issues working parents. We'll simplify x compare extreme (deaths).

God one think longer? Obviously act similar coronaviruses, behave like herpes viruses Yeah best curbside pickup places literally meet curb, fantastic. Pumpkins spider webs do.

We're going giving candy sure. cannot find study saying 60% children pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies covid. comment claims this. study states children infected beta coronaviruses HCoV might cross-reactive antibodies target Covid. speak whether infectious, speaks whether die it. person antibodies incapable infecting others.

However.

Two days enough infect others normal setting. Sure, hours closed space near proximity might possible, spouse etc etc - normal circumstances. 

I could totally wrong though! They're outdoors, exercising first amendment rights, many people masks on. 

Risk outdoor transmission low, remember? What's issue here? red herring. nothing wearing mask. Comparisons like reasons people dont listen. facts, power. think America offers greater opportunity success failure industrialized nations.

You safety nets much successful even regular corporate jobs like engineering. be, really American fucking thing ever.

Americans give shit other, corporations goal protect profits. many companies gonna take profit hits US economy goes shit Cletus want's dine 2 $20 masks trigger Karen's self diagnosed anxiety.

## Despite open borders - Swedes go Denmark

For week, Danish border open Swedes registered Sk√•ne, Blekinge Kronoberg counties. Despite this, number car train passengers across bridge seem increased much.

\- Right around 45 percent less traffic last year, says Fredrik Jenfjord, sales marketing manager √ñresundsbron.

When border Denmark closed mid-March, almost leisure traffic across bridge ceased. still took mainly Danes visited Sweden.

In past week, people Sk√•ne residents Blekinge Kronoberg counties opportunity visit Denmark without special reasons without showing negative covid-19 tests.

\- seen increase Swedish traffic since border opening, marginal, says Fredrik Jenfjord.

He believes part reason many Swedes choose stay home Ministry Foreign Affairs still advises travel Nordic neighbors.

After big loss March, traffic across bridge gradually increased. Around Easter ascension Christ, people began cross bridge. mainly one direction.

\- Danes responsible increase, says Fredrik Jenfjord.

In mid-July last year, Swedes accounted half registered leisure traffic across bridge. last three weeks, Swedes gone accounting one-fifth total leisure traffic one-third border opening.

**On √ñresund trains** bridge, number passengers around 60,000 four weeks now. week 28 29, increase 2,000 passengers measured, figures nevertheless lower week 26 border still closed.

\- difficult say anything numbers. heard train hosts general feeling many Swedes before. absolutely onslaught border opened, says Mikael Espling, head √ñresund trains Sk√•netrafiken.

Unlike √ñresund Bridge, Sk√•netrafiken possibility check nationality passengers. statistics collected train hosts count number passengers.

During past week, Sk√•netrafiken noticed increase around ten percent number passengers √ñresund trains. increase mainly registered counties traffic bridge.

**The traffic ferry line** Helsingborg Helsing√∂r also lower normal. shipping company noticed slight increase past week.- experienced approximately 60 percent less activity normal. last week, seen slight increase, early say anything it, says Jens Ole Hansen, chief operating officer shipping company Forsea. competent government would restrict restaurants takeout delivery directed bailout funds help restaurants tailor operations towards delivery takeout.

Working Walmart would frequently customers tell big deal. 140,000 dead seems like big deal me. anywhere!!!  wonder many anti maskers smoke saying masks cut oxygen.

More like, smoking first place anti-mask? Yep. literally euthanized elderly instead giving proper care.

How even happen modern country 2020??? Man, know I'm probably preaching choir entire school situation mess. shitty situation great solution. 

Sending kids back school rolling dice spreading virus other, teachers, families, everyone. [There's indications might terrible, data far compelling right distance learning great alternative. host problems--a lot parents situation staying home kids feasible. lot time, resources, capacity, willingness help make distance learning success.

If afford parent stay home, private tutor, whatever, prospect schools reopening lot less daunting people can't. children are, statistically, already getting head start peers. There's big chance extended period distance learning going make worse.

And that's thinking kids, considering issues teachers facing. issues people flying business first wearing mask? thinking people paid bunch money ticket may feel entitled refuse wear mask, also barring people flights? ""pod"" structure exists school shut neverending contact trace / quarantine waves.

Normal school almost immediately result mass infections students and/or faculty impossible sort stamp absent local lockdown.

EDIT: Let's clear this. pod structure assumption perfectly safe kids spread virus. purpose minimize inevitable damage. really drives numbers athletics department 

This really depends type university athletic footprint. Washington State, charge student fees athletics, accounts 2% operating budget.

Nearby University Oregon charge student fees athletics completely self funded.

Taking step further, universities like University Michigan actually takes revenue athletics returns back school.

Hello. slight difficult situation right now. family stationed South Korea right now, considerably safer compared USA (where originally were), struggling keep parents cognizant COVID.

In particular, parents following guidelines prevent spread COVID (i.e. face masks, sanitizer going out), considerably lax guidelines, point driving crazy. Case point, refuse change outside clothes coming home, refuse sanitize objects touch often outside (i.e. cell phones, folders, bags), often reuse masks instead using new ones. confront behaviors try get understand risks, insist I'm careful calm down.

When tell wash hands change clothes coming home, wash hands change clothes immediately, insist fine COVID spreads via aerosols thus okay touch clothing. receive packages mail, touch immediately put high-contact places sofa work tables without waiting least day kill possible COVID areas cardboard/paper. refuse use disinfectant wipes sanitize surfaces well, hear complaining stubbornness behind back.

I wish sanity check. really stubborn careful, continue pressure think seriously COVID?

Like, no. Inflammatory diseases much, much worse flu sniffles.  think there's also lot sunk cost fallacy/not wanting admit wrong. Also know voter base would push back SUPER hard (see: texas trying re-close bars) tried undo slow reopening efforts. point they're playing re-elections knowing base consists people care virus ""freedoms"" people believe say ""well economy poorly us reopening imagine bad would closed everything whole time"" despite complete nonsense.

Jesus christ, humans went back lived quite literally every disaster, different.

A pandemic ends, like forest fire. inevitable.


The virus either infect every possible host planet die out(like forest fire burn every piece land doesnt get put out)

/s I‚Äôll let know. Going Brooklyn Saturday.  People spending stimulus checks responsibly see. Closing borders buys days. recommends gives countries false sense security replacement actual testing measures border.

Eg: US blocked flights China assumed it'd contained there. basically testing Europe imported cases come from. lifelong severe asthma right absolutely bullshit excuse lol really, NYC area that's markedly worse Western Europe general. media loves pile states like Florida Texas fatality rates low.

Remember ""flatten curve"" = longer curve tail. places best ones flatten curve. could reduce lifespan 20-30 years EDIT: Ministry Health announced one deaths counted twice (somehow). 9 deaths today 80 total.

On hand, 1978 tests performed today's report, 38.827% positivity rate. Yeah one near us great Yep! I'm bedside nurse can't work home childcare available thru family friends. could get nanny honestly, trust daycare someone could find last minute watch home. Even though I'm sending daycare, go playdates mommy meet ups like before. things safely without everything. missing meaning here.  system broken Trump.  saying Trump able run president, never able leader (let alone candidate) Republican party. Excuse ignorance, know therefore ask: independent ever run POTUS gained real traction? Independent meaning rich individual, upstart party?  reality, actually two parties, correct?  

Trump, vote for/support would irrelevant Republican party stood interests.   said Democrats. point, parties blatantly shown truly care people.   

At point, even though would huge mistake, Kanye actually run POTUS independent think guys vote him.  Obviously would horrible, probably worse Trump - that's even possible - hopefully would send message parties can't get away bullshit anymore.   

A vote either party point losing situation people. Even fact people 'Trump' blaiming people vote support instead party refuses get rid result elite winning.   Stop allowing segregate people, want.  even argument? Self-entitled people use proclaimed position find alternative methods obtaining needs, include travel. Sensible people adhere science, law, policy, common sense. important wear mask, equally entitled absent society. We, common ground, cannot greatly influence economic differences given tumultuous times. can, however, care public. Wear mask, abstain society. Get yourself. fail understand basics societal necessity, forever marked.

Edit: I'm saying people autism may find masks triggering. saying, case, excuse, severely disabled can't wear mask, need find alternative arrangements. 


I also see issue majority autistic people. tend rules followers pretty clear cut rule good reasons behind it. suffocation pstd victims? schools opening back site instruction. That's numbers really gonna rise. IDK thinking.... America #1! Appropriately socially distanced. universe live in?

China stole technology sold counterfeit products decades. *very bad asthma.*

Like ""it almost killed me"" bad asthma.

I wear fucking mask anyways.

""oh uncomfortable""

Nut up. Catching COVID resurrect *now dormant* (well managed) could otherwise **kill me** asthma way uncomfortable.

Granted, ""cheating"" I'm wearing half mask (with exhalation valve) still wearing N95's valve. discomfort metal nose band far outweighed respiratory ""distress"" wearing mask did.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Good. many masks, whole world‚Äôs Eyes Wide Shut mode. brain damage something ? literally that. Yes though airports won‚Äôt make gate without mask. Translation: two weeks increasing death rate deal with. maybe things change. Hey, we've still got week left July, wanted check in. How's reopening going you? 'Cause looks like new daily cases way up. They're guys back early April, fact. staying safe? understand still illegal, medically proven great certain medications like treating Parkinson's, imagine something take times day ever shakes again, literally life changing. would makes billions tax, regulate it, zero overdose deaths, proven turn people killers, exactly like alcohol safer, terms prohibition, outlawed super strong regulated bad guys get money, regulate make legal money goes market fair price, crime rate goes down, means less Police spending means school public funding means happier population, obvious face, younger generations get charge, fucking sucks say, vote fuck nowadays That's cheating. Ohio maybe? You‚Äôre idiot, clear wall nonsense wrote. wow that's disturbing Pepee le poo combo above. we're nation dumbasses led biggest dumbass all. think airlines enforce eating time periods. short haul flights, give 45 minutes eat masks go back on. long haul, give meals time anyways allow 1h eating force everyone put masks after.

Otherwise it‚Äôs true, people claim ‚Äúeating‚Äù entire duration flight wear mask. That's book first class choose 1A. race, ""free"" booze hot towels.

If can, book like 8 weeks advance fly Tuesday Wednesday, that's find first class tickets really cheap. care test long results happen quickly. thing spreading much people getting tested getting results week. top 10? It'll probably #1. cOmMOn CoLd I‚Äôm spectrum asthma, yet wear mask I‚Äôm public despite extreme discomfort myself. Yep, especially emergent medical care. might make weathers bad. happened friend, took 18 hours medivac due weather. made thankfully. typically there‚Äôs much risk scheduled medical care. lots reschedules delays. travel pain. fact life places. last time US involved ""protecting allies""? exert influence aggressively every day almost every country world, dont stand little guy. Yeah, last minute teachers told higher ups grade anything lower anyone's grade. That's young man's game, that's strongüí™üèæ man's game. Aaaaaand I‚Äôm ugly crying. never said thought okay anyone leave house can't wear mask. I'm anti-mask. personally go public without one. asthma also experience rosacea flares prevent wearing mask.

I'm saying conditions could interfere someone's ability wear mask may confine hospital bed. saying okay people act though pandemic going on. I'm frustrated people pretending medical condition prevents wearing mask exploiting way selfish also causing backlash towards people medical conditions. Obviously comment taken wrong way Give bank details investigate you. US propaganda mill audience? keep close doors kept players contacting much outsiders might hopeless. Oh damn, realised I‚Äôve wasting great opportunity wear Chewbacca mask often! I've thinking getting N95s, I'd heard recently. Thank you, thinking third case seafood infected virus. second case human infection frozen seafood involved. People mocked saying ""two weeks,"" even though lazy way thinking -- disease found work. dont know could economically point. blew chance sadly. grandma late stage COPD really cant wear one.

That said, doesnt go outside bc american dumbass Good. Exemptions bullcrap still harms passengers Do...do Republicans understand ""X-industrial complex"" actually means something something stick end whatever want blame legislative shortcomings? mean, ""testing industrial complex"" make sense context.

A ""blank-industrial complex"" means there's unwritten pact institution investment perpetuate influence policy. shadowy conspiracy.  hope so, child attending UAH next month. still many entitled morons though point can't possibly believe government trying get people killed sink others either poverty line bury much debt essentially become class indentured servants.

There's way someone could make many mistakes intentional pushes death chaos without malicious. like Nero playing fiddle Rome burned We‚Äôre welcome smaller Bahama islands, though UK, Canada, etc visitors are. Thanks. didn‚Äôt even realize cake day, yes IM miserable. Whoops, r/trump leaking H1N1 absolutely major news story. Also comparing fact statistics 19 month pandemic vs height/middle current pandemic disingenuous. even then, covid-19 killed 10x number people US H1N1 did, argument falls apart pretty quickly.

As country failing, hard. reason nearly every country world travel ban US. President touts constant anti-science rhetoric, cites baseless conspiracy theories responds public health crisis PR problem opposite response need killed 10's thousands Americans. literal sack potatoes place Trump would better results.

We still dont effective contact tracing place, PPE running short again, poorest citizens (and soon schoolchildren) offered altar corporate profits lack federal leadership. 

Feel free strawman Obama like. completely irrelevant argument, like whataboutisms, generally tool bad faith actors. look nearly country world see bad really are. minimum wage shit job healthcare, benefits like sick leave, employee protections prevent fired call sick. 

Sure literally ""requiring"" come work sick... they're threatening entire livelihoods don't. ""Take Train ( cause Insane...) "" means we're opposite.  He's piece shit positive dgaf grandmother want lose weight need determined it. honestly perfect time. lost 60 lbs past year determined eat better healthy. 20 pounds since beginning June sticking clean keto diet started exercising. 230 60lbs go. Working home made things much easier top fact want healthy high-risk covid.

You it! probably get flu jab Damn I'm crying lovely pictures.  I've noticed breath lot deeper mask on. dunno that's mask thing psychological thing.

Regardless, bad enough go without. lungs already fucked enough as-is. months ago Year, probably. would go down? We're adding million confirmed cases every 2 weeks right that's going go up. can't envision get thousand day without another large scale shut down. increase tests? Yes. got flu like 13 thought going die. couldn‚Äôt eat drink days laid motionless couch sweating. remember feeling fine wave went could tell fucked. get pretty intense. Made tho. felt like death. get pee felt like using last bit life left. Didn‚Äôt go hospital confirm bc know, American health care, recently contact someone right got sick. Lol. definitely overlook bc young get really bad dangerous poor thing. Whew. feel like asshole relieved I'm glad Middletown CT. single client problem complying. buy LSE. sure it‚Äôs right time buy though. DYOR (goes without saying üòÅ) Thanks Trump loser Brazil dono, depending location could pull gun shoot you. would keep distance. many counties still planning person school. Tuscaloosa County says school option children online, come school.

However, Tuscaloosa city decided virtual school first 9 weeks.

Nearby Jefferson County voted virtual school first 9 weeks.

Thank God virus affect people Tuscaloosa County sticks cities /s hit first exponential phase infection, soon start hit home lot people really big group faithfully worship alter wedding old furniture factory. depressing. We're gonna get fucked eventually, want control seems. realized fat chance slim chance mean thing. Relax bruh he‚Äôs far reddit commenting ass  joke, purely political post, allowing political comments assinine. I've tried years address fingernail sensitivity. turns tolerance pain. people would rather inflict pain via clothing rather act out. wanted stop COVID, could quarantine Republicans call hoax room 3 weeks. would much easier get rest us wear masks.   thought can‚Äôt mask whatever respiratory-ailment related reason really try avoid COVID.

Like, able lock house contactless delivery. Don‚Äôt control either. unfamiliar employee means? nothing painful nasal swab got folks, don‚Äôt worry. strange sensation. like tickle pain. child retorts ‚Äúthat‚Äôs okay, don‚Äôt want dessert‚Äù proceeds stare salivate dad eats ice cream. guess allow 120 woman ask Id selling alcohol either. maybe bank tellers fear robberies. Moron. Furthermore, would assume consulting taking big hit uncertain times.

Usually consultants bit luxury service. first cut corporate budget SHTF. take daily steroid inhalers, rescue Albuterol inhaler.

Regardless, doctor told one first things proscribed COVID patient Albuterol. You...what now? second case virus detected imported shrimp Ecuador shrimp manage infect anyone. second case human infection. Depends tax bracket (2+3)/(10+10) = 5/20 = 25% worse comes worse could try wear face shield. could find alternative ways travel using social distancing people dying we‚Äôre testing, stopped testing one would infected, therefore deaths, checkmate trump haters. sure read but, asthma(medicated), cronic rhinitis(meds solve it), hiperventilate anxiety time (not medicated might change, still talking therapist)
I barely breath normaly spend entire day feelings awful, mask makes worse, different types make worse others, blue common one, change much, reusable washable ones, thicker ones 'better' ones make LOT harder, someone complains mask, suggest changing mask wearing Fuck off. Mental health serious health problems. Nobody give two shits it‚Äôs harder breathe not. Suck up, _literally_. feeling American tourists responsible. us, it.  almost 3 year old son ASD can‚Äôt even get wear hat sunglasses 2 seconds without taking triggering severe earth shattering meltdown epic proportions could last half hour so. mask (or face shield) right non-starter.

We model mask home much possible try get used much can. Don‚Äôt know ever trick, try best.  say known studies analysis seem point surface contamination much problem air breath in.

Scientifically, one study mean much get duplicate results several studies. Even though feel bit less paranoid touching surfaces, continue wipe grocery less 2-3 months.  Someone YouTube said ""I can't wear one asthma"".

If asthma wearing mask would actually benefit you, slack jawed mongoloid. feel frustration, advice, struggle follow honest, keep cool, long don‚Äôt near get angry.
This abnormal time, act normal abnormal. correct reaction things would normally think crazy.... recently rented cabin get momento go away peace... cleaned cabin like crazy person would, paid good job lol

The day, kindly reminded customer mask fallen nose. ""Whoops!

Oh no! hope ruin kid's childhood worrisome mom. swear, felt like family got struck lightning freak incidence KD. I'm hoping still well adulthood. love state one respect, like coronavirus: people highly variable symptoms. none, die. percentages die flu lower coronavirus, still die it.

This coupled past experiences mean fuck around flu. Shots every year, wash hands constantly, keep away groups people, etc. used get called germaphobe lot... angry, failed attempt comparison. 2 situations even remotely same. least four bags two big progressive race identity. We've got Joe Biden OK long VP black woman.  test, cases. alternative methods transportation, like renting car, don‚Äôt expose others.

If fly dad‚Äôs funeral without mask, might someone else‚Äôs funeral too. He‚Äôs self-isolating. staying mutual friend sleeping (albeit large) couch friend‚Äôs apt. likely hasn‚Äôt tested, neither buddy owns apt, self. likely wearing mask, hopefully Florida friend well. 

I driving straight work Cleveland hang weekend. mean that‚Äôs obvious long time I've personally suffered heart attack, Covid19, OCD entire life.

It‚Äôs literally effect declining antibodies live real world. welcome join us time want to. that's false argument implies way kid gets exposed virus school. Almost everything said factually incorrect even know begin.

Your comment shows know close nothing government actually functions. house passes bill, senate approves, president signs it. 3 steps needed. Senate takes vacation, government suddenly become House Executive branch.

I implore go back watching Schoolhouse Rock bring naive rage public view. I'm \*pretending\* anything.  I'm highlighting mask resistance \_not\_ simple matter personally assuming personal risk, creating risk others consent. Lmao succinct explanation I've come across. 10/10. good info studies France early -- first realized kids getting lingering symptoms, sheer number cases ran into. huge outbreak, might still trying connect dots. UK accept political refugees US yet? Stop making stuffs don‚Äôt understand Yeah. Nothing killed 130k Americans hundreds thousands world wide. Nothing leaving people scarred lungs.

Big ol Nothing. 

You mofo idiot. think he's talking insitutions emergent far left, marxists extreme social justice types. Types would Portland courthouse right now. ‚ÄúHow dare tell truth cause death.‚Äù I'm saying patron absolved responsibility. withdrawal alcoholism extremely serious. DDTs cause seizures deaths. time moral judgement, taken seriously patron said alcohol need.   Same. kinda don‚Äôt like here, plus. say again; Johnson HIGHLY EDUCATED, evidence HIGHLY INTELLIGENT. confusing confirmed cases actually infected. 

At peak, NYC almost exclusively testing a) hospitalized patients, b) people certain age. fact, true almost everywhere March/April lack testing. 

So course over-represented terms confirmed cases covid deaths. mean likely younger people infected. .1% 56.6 million students elementary, middle high school means 56,600 completely avoidable deaths.

So comfortable many child deaths? see legaly kick flight danger flight crew passengers. list conditions meet standards online too. 
But unless prove covid wearing mask dont understand legaly let flight. 
I ask person looks perfectly healthy strep, infectious disease. say doctora letter saying im cleared fly can't wear mask discriminatory. 

Can airline prevent one traveling show signs symptoms sickness legal medical paper work? accusation slander point. resident Massachusetts, taste what's come gets cold college students return across country every single part state. saving grace rapidly expanding testing capacity. hope enough support college plans test every student every week. People belittled Covid also... oh, sorry, Boris. remember first time smoked weed. ""New York right."" *Reddit phds*

Hahah. Gots dem diploma YouTube University! forgetting 40% numbers seeing March

Overall 25% deaths average climbing.

So far 250k previous years Feel free elaborate. I'm expecting people experts constitutional law, least try familiarity Constitution spouting think Congress solve problems. provide info suggests maybe literally everything right... going hospital regularly reasons. born terminal brain malformation, family used hospital visits**. diagnosed Covid-19 earlier month, stay like they‚Äôve never experienced before. fixing stupid, Uh, no. 

The rule is/was get Bachelors Oxbridge, automatically upgraded Master's degree. nothing Eton.

Johnson HIGHLY EDUCATED, evidence HIGHLY INTELLIGENT.  Even covid stays away Jersey Yeah reader view great; use everything even pop blockers on. Makes much enjoyable read news. agree 100%. don‚Äôt understand travel quarantines exist don‚Äôt apply everyone plane, regardless coming from. 

At point, NY‚Äôs applies fair amount states, doesn‚Äôt account people coming state list, laying different state, sitting next someone plane quarantine. would bet person sitting next pretty exposed person it, they‚Äôre free go lol, sure im chuckling post screen name Hitler knew play crowd like fiddle. else convince entire nation let ex-Corporal basically bum life take country?

/r/technicallythetruth r/birdsarentreal middle ground doctors orders mask?

Your position ""you possibly condition requires mask"" actual rebuttal point deflection.

What condition doctor orders mask?

What then? discrimination?

Saying ""its question"" thats point, hypothetical situation reasonable.

I live across road park, dead quiet March, everyone's back watching people never know pandemic. Really frustrating! guy arguing with, picked line Look name ffs idiot.

Your name real similar popular movie, fuck outta logic. barely said cunt mate even whole exchange, legend. looks like job me! Preprint, course, looks really good.

""total 585 samples obtained **349 symptomatic** COVID-19 patients, collected 26 weeks disease onset, analyzed IgM IgG ...""

""By week 4, proportion patients neutralization activity **increased 90%, remained high end observation 26 weeks** (Fig. 3A). ""

This study smaller New York Mount Sinai study, much longer observation duration (26 weeks 6.5 months), encouraging long-term immunity. strongly recommend taking look graphs PDF , give much better idea researchers talking numbers alone. Hopefully similar study asymptomatic patients come soon. either, would guess probably zero since March  could beat Big Meat!?

People live isolated bubbles people wear masks home families.

The percent positive high, need lockdown, otherwise descent much longer get positivity rate 5. jAiL!!! protests causing spikes, locations major protests occurring correlate places spikes, genius? 

Pick city major protest is/has happened go graphs curves. 

I've already talked this, want dense let's again. places major riots happening either major spikes begining poor policies poor environment terrible sanitary homeless conditions Cali brought upon themselves. That's real difference. Many high risk cities already went first spike. second wave going cities much smaller chance spiking like initial wave. 

FL never went first spike initial wave. handled covid far better. even see graphs. protests/riots caused spike second wave FL. 

If anything, minor second wave going NY actually shows herd immunity built up. honestly great news. unless saying protests NY caused spikes FL, also make sense.

No buttplug. initial spike covid US concentrated NY Cuomo. Quit acting like US handled poorly. numbers high direct result initially Cuomo's policies protests/riots. 9/11?

Asking people shelter place two three weeks perfectly reasonable thing do. And, part, compliance pretty good first two three weeks. 

Asking people shelter place much longer real impacts became severe passing week, however. 

At certain point, asking continuing shutdowns, even half-assed shutdowns right now, worth it. also asking half-assed shutdowns anything useful, that's way we'll able really make calculation. anything useful, able admit open everything back again. useful, ask useful they're worth disruption. still worst death rate Europe bar small countries skew statistics somewhat.

Why going public worried getting virus?


Why everyone doesn‚Äôt agree mask, I‚Äôd argue people don‚Äôt agree given often I‚Äôm public around people. Almost one takes mask seriously, goes show, it‚Äôs incredibly selfish make masses come together small percentage do. 


If you‚Äôre worried getting sick public, don‚Äôt go. Everyone else shouldn‚Äôt bend backwards you. 


If point going i‚Äôm selfish mindful people, past viruses we‚Äôve had? selfish stay home wear mask virus able transferred? 


I also find incredibly selfish make everyone stay home, really major problem older people. really decided everyone stay home fraction people, don‚Äôt even work. So, we‚Äôre going stop working, able pay bills, etc. people (mostly) social security don‚Äôt need worry working.

HIPAA applies ""covered entities"", mainly health insurers medical facilities. simply apply private business medical field.

Yea national perspective right likely referred second wave. First wave northeast, second wave was...everywhere else. see bags .000042 seconds faster distance light travel bag retina. always wondered civilization going end, banking ""self-righteous, narcissistic dipshits"" cause. figured it'd something complex -- nukes. debating masks???? Corona virus already, time. pretty much information started now. STILL talking wearing masks not? ‚ÄúDemocrats wear masks! Republicans don‚Äôt! Trump doesn‚Äôt!‚Äù 

Do part. Whatever fuck deem is. everyone telling everyone fucking days? We‚Äôve trapped houses... jobs lost... business gone... cities burned... riots. could go like endless back forth conversation masks.

But let tell one thing sum shit up:

FREE WILL.  Sucks turns cancer :/ bar, gym restaurant people completely maskless they're eating/working out.  Sure. üôÑ Antisocial ‚â† asocial. Common misconception said someone day, ‚ÄúI miss respect certain people.‚Äù ""wE CAn't lET CUre WoRse dISeAse"" Yeah ppl Mayday emergency landings well Doc too, I've told people medical reason wear mask noses mouths. There's blood hands Americans possessed wherewithal recognise back '15 Trump worst option, bother vote ""Hillary prize either"".

Now people dying it. make mistake. access essential medical care depends it? pyrrhic victory still victory! never seen incompetent governor anywhere. Seriously. either put pictures harddrive something guy must taken office. get hundreds thousands floridians killed. probably already has. dont even accurately report death tolls. Disregard covid deaths pneumonia despite fact 400 percent increase pneumonia deaths time last year every month.

Sales tanked. People idiots look non-caloric silicon-based kitchen lubricant. create surface 500 times slippery cooking oil. surprising number indoor rinks Florida, actually - despite skyrocketing case numbers, nearly open *months.* least local rink, I've heard there's virtually zero masks social distancing, they're even ""regularly"" disinfecting locker rooms like claimed would. even despite least 6 confirmed positive cases play games building.

I really hope rinks (and players!) behaving responsibly. also hope rest state country finally decides try get pandemic control sometime soon ***really*** miss playing hockey. found guys seem good job: that, get feeling test flow like bunch tiny streams feeding river. tributaries may certain capacity limits could hide outbreaks. it? I'm thinking going around microphone telling everyone person doesnt mask back away type. gonna kick first, non mask wearing douche? separate island helps also Hmmm... mother something perfect gaussian curves... reddit. That's takes. God prick. Good one mister! bet doesn‚Äôt doubt number cases it. Sweet Potato Hitler must've briefed something wicked.... Oh wait, no, probably poll numbers.

Hell don‚Äôt even want either don‚Äôt choice. get dr appointments, it‚Äôs essential. Unfortunately involves flying. It‚Äôs crappy situation. I‚Äôm saying everyone wear mask rare fly absolutely essential reasons. banning kids two planes. similar. hate raisins, oddly enough like grapes. Yeah! LMFAO. Goodness.

I hope remains proposal also you, without countermeasures improve currently winter southern hemisphere right now. Australia.. Argentina, Chile... countries still 40's/50's nights.

I believe one coldest places right South Africa. 30's night. Covid taking stronghold speak. article specifically say percentage COVID-19. Mayo says 70%, others say 43-60%. Fact is, one knows wait it. Solve problem now. 200m 70% US. person made shit believe it?

Fanta Menace's final push! one lightening rod another wanted say love term thank saying May rest peace Facts. See many people may think NFL players ""fat"" aren't, still muscle mass. muscle mass contributes towards BMI, strains heart. That's worst reason I've ever heard wearing mask. going cough sneeze twice much next person, breathing *lot* pollen needs to. probably lots poor people still can't afford cell phone

Yea pure bullshit, cellphone like junk food now, everyone afford it, even homeless people. 

Go random slum India, guarantee kid make 50 cents day phone. fascism? COUNTRY PACKED IGNORANT PEOPLE. design. Haha hostile response pointing lazy read link (which using mine reference). 

Lol m8 Aren‚Äôt little dramatic tasteless sarcasm? 25 contagious staff members bad one, though People go things like groceries. everyone ability work home. 99% people wore masks, small minority valid reasons didn't, we'd much better shape now. really quite dumb US travel loophole allows Canadians fly States even though land water routes shut tight, end August flying Toronto Buffalo (after first flying wrong way changing planes Chicago, ffs) see girlfriend first time six months. shall marrying whisking back across border soon possible (due Canada allowing non-citizen spouses cross), keeping Great White North country comes goddamn senses.

With that's happening right now, feel much like I'll going secret mission enemy territory. damn well worth it. weight? Like fatty/muscle matter? ""And everybody clapped.""

No shit really did? 

""And stewardess's name: Albert Einstein."" do. friends moved husband military. went first, came later kids quarantine 14 days. Problem is, lot Americans willing accept USA good think. yeah would, feel like stuff come around time tho tbh One extreme wants everyone everything live peace harmony entire universe extreme tear gasses moms sends secret police kidnap American citizens.

 2,000 people died last two days. essential, too. play computer games? fell bad liminoid_lion. You‚Äôre getting lot hate everyone expressing opinion. Sounds like liberties! evidence reinfection. mass some. Also corona viruses don‚Äôt create life long immunity. 1-3 years. logical assumption true long term herd immunity may possible. Me, too. BIPOC already die often due medical discrimination think, reason happen COVID triage, too. :( conditions make unable wear mask. are, flying airplane something anyway course would deny it... shit .. suck balls, hiding behind Christian crap. Can‚Äôt believe anyone even eats there. reaching places low positivity trying contain still using tests. fact places probably outbidding states containing, since actually use test results. true, would cause testing capacity places exploding drop. 

There national numbers anywhere back up, know state ~5000 negative tests day couple weeks ago.  Infertility impotence recorded side effect already cases. do‚Äî example, right forced sit next stupid cunt can‚Äôt wear mask may breathing sorts Covid aerosols. problems nose mouth,for example one nostrils 50% blocked, breathing nose hard could important shit u need take airplane, maybe work, maybe family, knows, tho, even always keep mask public, sometimes gets real hard, people lot worse  kits. relying house 4 hour test run 8a 11p. Patients held results available. YOGCO

you get coronavirus once

(Yes know might true) fell back last winter recommended people wear masks.  Yes someone please think pubs??

/S  plane last week Spirit, asshole got plane told mask. sat took asked keep mask on. besides told keep actual ramifications. Fuck guy. That‚Äôs use honey ricola. want pain, try listerine strip wearing mask. breath smell good cry cruel SOB Gov Abbott deplorable disgrace knew covid wld spike &amp;here . Airplanes make rasonable accommodations people disabilities. Usually call set ahead time request wheelchair, cart ride across terminal gates, etc. 
However can't wear mask due anxiety even flying pandemic?

My anxiety gets worse around people wearing masks I've staying home much possible.

 travel, car right normal level social anxiety skyrocketed charts due pandemic people wearing masks. 

And finally breathing problems like asthma probably compromised immune system need mask anyone else. possible probably stay home lung function breathing difficulties get worse possibly life-threatening!


I tired people never gave shit ADA suddenly trying use get wearing mask possibly infecting people around actually medical conditions. bag comes first keep waiting. True, people won‚Äôt wear masks won‚Äôt helped this, know there‚Äôs lot people wear masks don‚Äôt know proper safest way that. hopefully sites like help people protect optimally! Fuck system... it‚Äôs broken lawyer would take ADA case find new career apparently can‚Äôt read law. fine ADA. Better oxygen levels sticking head ass, that‚Äôs sure. source dispute apps tested mostly accurate 90% spO2

Yes does, many times great detail. whole approach trainwreck since hardware measure properly simply there. nothing fad sell Samsung Galaxy series phones red light emitting diode (LED) built phone addition flash light camera. details released company app used LED estimate oxygen saturation, appears publicity material YouTube worked via single-wavelength measurement (albeit monochromatic light source, LED) therefore oxygen saturation could accurately derived physically possible measure SpO2 using current smartphone two published studies assessed smartphone oximeter apps (Digidoc Samsung) raise serious questions diagnostic accuracy.

The burden proof additionally device prove works usefully, random scientists disprove every dumb thing there. proof. got rid Fleshlight college. Might time reinvest. yell, ""Hey...uh uh! NO! Bad! NO."" point door, way shopowners stray dog monkey walk in? Fucking idiot man... get it?? know Scot calls movie 'American Braveheart', much mean compliment. might one good time get plane quickly. know get move around flight, right? I'm 5'8"", get walk around multiple times flights. too. live close parents. March 5 last time hugged them, indoors them, within 6 feet them. Then, son got covid daycare June 10, husband daughter got (all mild). Today, got blood back antibodies. parents said could go see tomorrow hug them. happy could cry. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll fine‚Äù okay except 30million people don‚Äôt jobs 146,000 people died country alone.

Selfish idiot. Trump cancelled convention dude. don‚Äôt kiss ass anymore. need centralize Jewish religious authority come something equivalent excommunication excommunicate guy. literally stands everything harmed Jews millennia. Ironically I‚Äôve multiple anti-maskers tell smoking bad me. It‚Äôs like believe science ( it‚Äôs true ffs) somehow it‚Äôs conspiracy medical community masks bad don‚Äôt offer level protection. around months... either get buried other, get buried separately.

....

Wait min. Asians feel Trump constantly saying ""China virus"" TV? Every time says China virus, encouraging someone physically assault Asian street.

How many Asian voters going lose this? Hit early on. densely populated state country. Borders NY contains one densely populated cities country. 

Fatal mistake LTC facilities handled. one denying that. 

But also cannot deny progress state made. That's focus on. progress made. That‚Äôs shame. I‚Äôm western New York due certain restrictions set forth people pay grade, much equipment could easily converted used testing rather laying dormant. 

My specialty PCR, needed outsource, basic supplies (swabs, primers, reagents, gels) testing longer seem issue acquisition. man power issue literally test kits? Last year really bad Forest fires spewing much smoke city see air quality 20+ scale went 1 10. wore mask help filter smoke protect poor asthmatic lungs. result, used meds usual hospitalized.

If masks good us asthmatics forest fire, bad asthmatics pandemic? Unless see oxygen saturation meter falling hooked wearing mask, believe mask makes hard breathe.

My work mandatory masks. wear them. I'm asthmatic. breathe fine.

Wear damned masks. Give people ‚Äúexemptions‚Äù face shields wear... watch quickly decide they‚Äôd rather wear mask face covering.  *facepalm*

Yea going LIBERATE, wasn‚Äôt talking states reopening, trying encourage people go commando. Asthma bullshit excuse wear mask, agree reason you. Asthma causes airways swell triggered. youre asthma attack (or recovering recent one) asthma restrict breathing. Wearing mask alter asthmatic‚Äôs ability breathe normal person. fact, airborn triggers dust pollen issue you, wearing mask recommended people asthma.

If youre saying wear mask dont wanna catch covid, doesnt protect much - protects others (unless youre saying sense wanna set example cant ask others wear mask dont wear one self, case fair play).

Lastly, asthma considered comorbidity covid. Covid attacks lungs specifically, airways. Obviously sickness trigger asthma exacerbation - especially respiratory ones - rescue inhaler shouldnt much concern. 

If youre interested research asthma covid 19 dig you. read lancet. know ny state stopped reporting asthma one pre existing conditions data insignificant (it would like reporting arthritis) know mean intend otherwise. exceptionally awful flu seasons (namely 1918) killed more. 

What mean is, matter, ignore something else ""could worse"" ""However, Trump‚Äôs public condemnation reportedly motivated private resentment toward Kemp, also exception Trump‚Äôs overall enthusiastic endorsement GOP-led states lifting stay-at-home restrictions. Additionally, Trump threatened ‚Äútake strong action‚Äù states didn‚Äôt reopen quickly enough liking falsely claimed ‚Äútotal‚Äù authority so.

And right-wingers Minnesota, Michigan Virginia protesting governors‚Äô stay-at-home orders ‚Äî often armed military-grade weapons ‚Äî Trump called demonstrators ‚ÄúLIBERATE‚Äù states.""

She must forgetting happened. Or, must happened alternate universe.... don‚Äôt always overhead empty, Dickhead? requiring masks? still gonna person meetings. never stopped going work work lab maintain distancing meeting two people digital. One person got virus spread distancing masks seem thankfully limit spread work. work spread building job involves working machines requires little interaction people. gone extra 4.2 miles get Marathon credit run. Get one 26.2 bummer stickers mask it. Agreed, personally don‚Äôt know anyone tested. point this, animation testing swab goes nose going around. said sensation like ‚Äútickling back eyeballs.‚Äù think many people hesitant get testing that. that‚Äôs good reason, I‚Äôve heard quite friends. sounds like people getting tested ones strongly feel need to. Lots people intention getting tested.  Well sure give mountains wild! everywhere. There‚Äôs probably mountains people. I‚Äôm foothills challenge summer, peaks challenge lots people enjoying it. bear aware. hope make someday! Don‚Äôt specifically tell self isolate test results in? 9 days self isolate, things like food grocery delivery nowadays isn‚Äôt completely doable? Fuck can't even imagine..... I've found simply holding phone recording wonders. know they're selfish wrong, second think might famous that, reverse course.

I waiting (very spaced out) line pick to-go order, one woman mask hand holding vaguely foot away face, letting drop, occasionally moving cashier talking to. 

I already phone open standing line (as one does) held like recording. Honestly thought get bad feeling recording people brings, holding way debating myself, second noticed, double-take moved mask face.

She kept holding it, eyes kept flicking phone like wanted drop it, least cashier. go-to move, now. Baghdad Bob really doesn‚Äôt. 99.965% human existence, vast majority people, option ""here's food, eat don't"".  
  
There's real option picky middle depression famine, someone choice 10 crops eat animals valuable eat every day. 
I doubt many parents besides privileged few, first humans around 200,000 years ago way around 1950, really convince kids eat food. gotta wonder tho, 150k deaths already looks pretty bad. slogan gonna ""hey least million!"" don‚Äôt want get behind plane, that‚Äôs stupid. want know people fucking ignorant make positions they're in. honest, transparent get much respect seriously integrity. Ultimately dumbass flordinians actually wear mask. try make bullshit ass excuses.

It makes sick stomach seeing whole situation dealt US. orange faced narcissist ignorant dumbass manage go bankrupt 5 times giving us advice one worst global pandemic outbreaks long time. 

Over highly renowned infectious disease expert dumbass people America listened trump. stay away politics making comments insane. Maybe world simulation find hard believe people born earth collectively fucking stupid. Luckily I'm IL pritzker one actually handle things best could. Fuck want move Canada. 

Not mention asshole republican fucks trying open schools take AWAY money unemployment benefits pandemic getting control since start. honestly brutal even think about.

Also last least businesses pay workers hope fucks go business too. Karma greedy cocksuckers money fuck go business hope never get back feet. people wear masks done everything right since started thank you. businesses actually take care workers pay adequately worrying 4th vintage car another yacht thank well. Probably stealing someone else's. family living like little house prairie. Baking bread, making lot food home. Keeping calendar events coming wall helps frame passage time, too. Indiana also record number new cases, wasn‚Äôt list. time shouldn‚Äôt wear mask part one studies vaccine want exposed. Even then, probably still wear one support, they're compatible. I.e. counter anything Heritage Foundation said. Then, wear mask good role model. poor survival chances linked size wallet? bet Trump doesn‚Äôt send son Barron school year. Melania won‚Äôt allow it. 2400 month extra unemployment Pig Latin get around word police Hi supposed wear mask. it‚Äôs slowly healing., I'm dad.  Criminally underrated comment here. would .001% population already died it. Nobody knew. Nobody. Believe me. Private lawsuit based laws violation them. precedents books siding customer. Nope. I‚Äôm supposed wear mask. It‚Äôs slowly healing. gives shit careers... 34 million people unemployed. could literally everything right, graduate get job literally get laid off. got job September graduating August worked good 6 months laid March. I‚Äôm broken system. Living outside system become essential paramount me. financial freedom way achieve that. There's also major lags missing data reported data transitioning sent HHS instead CDC.

And deaths go up, hospitalizations go because, know, there's suddenly vacancies. bad, saying random shit. even notice. attention divided shitting threads laughing William Shatner making fun Red Letter Media. Yes. is. long make reasonable accommodations. 

You don‚Äôt accommodate way could dangerous, means don‚Äôt let store without mask. Well *my* brain slowed down. agree ""life death"" thing bit dramatic. I'm type 1 diabetic paramedics come help binds many times -- they've pretty much 30 guess. Maybe 35. Never one 50s. surprising? fast food restaurant tied religion anti gay stance feel sorry folks, that's all. trust me, IQ little meaning comes intelligence.
You citing already flawed American dictionary scavenge definitions used medicine century half century back really helping case.
I'm calling town idiots assume they, like you, consume conspiracies daily advocate wearing masks. know fucking privileged hold sort mindset without medical repercussion. Every area knowledge two mountains. first one small people think see top top knowledge others possibly know more. go top mountain realize even close base next mountain actual experts scaling side 30+ years. really trying win he! 30 minutes ago saw CNN interview Bill Gates talking vaccines Twitter course comments guy said vaccine micro chip Bill Gates put it. problem comment one top ones 100 likes. incredible many stupid people believing crap. funny thing clearly said guy posted comment IPhone course tracks everywhere goes. pre fab concrete said, already made panels You‚Äôre wrong. Maybe government interested providing income replacement home-school stipends parent could stay home, know, parent. Instead we‚Äôll send kids back spread virus people get sick, die. American again, long last, great again. China published 5 papers Lancet end Jan specifically report findings virus. Take look decide much information scientists publishing international journals English warn rest world domestic situation perilous juncture. made efforts hide containment strategies, indeed would impossible hide even tried. laughed tried spraying bleach streets, shut central air conditioning. everything worked, turned sound strategies. me, see collective effort experiment understand new virus. one knew everything spreads first day, China certainly made mistakes.

But I'm seriously sure narrative Chinese withholding information even came from. evidence suggest this? 

I'm implying defending US. even really want talk US response honest, feels like low hanging fruit. mostly referring global response virus, especially hard hit countries (of suppose US constituent). this. extra masks. Offer one free. want pick fight nice brain melts Sorry, must reference get Jew dont really see anyone inferior. sure opinion comes superiority complexes arent unique judiasm beginning June daily case counts increased 1100% yes, daily deaths increased 300%. That‚Äôs still large disparity. 

This comparison make sense. compare death &amp; increases vs case increases 3 weeks apart. Hypothetical dates June 15th June 30th cases go 5x. Deaths change (of course). look July 7th July 21st look increase deaths compare increase cases June 15th June 30th. etc. estimates/roughly speaking here.

The period June 30th average cases something like 1200, 500% increase cases, 310% increase deaths. based 3 week delay increases case counts (double amount June 30th), we'd probably expect deaths double least go another 60%. working case counts, delay, what's happened far. least 200 deaths day. 

If hit ~200 deaths day that's major problem. means nearly 35k people would die Florida stayed constant rest year. Probably putting worst hit state country total deaths, maybe per capita. 

I think happen, likely people wear masks, isolate, semi-lockdown socially distance regardless terrible governor mandates. example 30% Florida mask mandate already Mayoral level instead governor. NYC nursing home lmao That's want think. *Angry Dale Gribble noises* Yo Asian bro? I‚Äôm happy hear that! finally got derm waiting weeks topical oral antibiotics 5 weeks. hope resolved then. you?  didn‚Äôt say upset people. know, I'm giving perspective fucking ridiculous whole thing is. Damn man, there's rough. hope somebody keeps track racial makeup people turn away. Nobody actually knows virus capable of. new. could capable long-term terrible things know yet. fear underestimate power collective stupidity nation revealed. Yeah.. might extension first wave look back period couple years, it‚Äôll seen 2nd wave don‚Äôt need fight midair red flag b-roll stroke genius. news producers? Call Kubrick, stat!  


 go strive elusive herd immunity. believe never stop volunteering tribute. i've tried running mask really hard, i'm saying lowers oxygen levels definitely limits amount air breath.

Granted bunch scummy bohemians valued paltry tip money living space literally friends -- representing surprisingly diverse walks life yet unified post-college, great recession poverty -- lived similarly. Oddly really higher level accountability institutionally. written Constitution, real checks balances system, minority party power delay legislation Executive power over-rule courts. 

The limitations, trustworthiness instead cultural based. People simply expect politicians much democratic electoral system elections every 3 years. 

The US political system seems simply expect corruption acquiesce it. checks balances system become broken point simply function longer. failure impeachment effort earlier year proved that. Checks balances lol Aren‚Äôt allowed claim feel unsafe work environment still qualify? Democratic House approved $3 trillion weeks ago. Republican Senate done anything. world blaming Republican Governor's awful response Democrats? still prevent it. fucking way accept happening. don‚Äôt care use commercial planes life flight dozens patients different cities.

You good night. stupid limit hit. cite exactly I‚Äôve saying claim victory. medical conditions make wearing mask difficult dangerous? Doctors say largely¬†an illegitimate excuse. Even people asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease advised wear masks public. 

If breathing bad can't wear mask public Karen Soon enough critical mass people recovered COVID enter policy discussion Medical triage ranked patients critical least critical. normal times medical supply plentiful, critical patients given priority. crisis (war, pandemic etc.) medical supplies scarce, medical priority reversed (thus called ‚Äúbattlefield triage‚Äù)... least serious patients treated first ensure people could saved, critical patients basically sacrificed.

PS. Pls understand medical field, NEVER simple giving ventilator B, since medical supplies needed save critical patients. Example: ‚ÄúPatient A‚Äù 50% chance survival one months ventilator, ‚ÄúPatient B/C/D/E‚Äù 80% chance one week. means ventilator could either attempt save one critical patients (50% chance 1 survive, 4 dead; 50% chance 5 dead) FOUR less serious illness (~80% chance 4 survive, 1 dead).

Because understanding virus, I‚Äôve done lot research listen lot virologists (not biologists). proposition lab made virus ridiculous.

In short human planet living today could engineer virus. think people overestimate ability genetically create phenotypic differences sort accurate way. 

1. There‚Äôs viral backbone close enough sars cov2 make nominal changes.

2. mentioned don‚Äôt technology ability make specific new viruses.

3. way would let naturally mutate lab, would take prohibitively long amount time.

So overall lab made theory unproven hypothesis also practically impossible

But let‚Äôs go Wuhan lab virus, messing it, got accidentally released. Let‚Äôs compare data.

The hypothesis virus animal vector mutated enough infect/transmit humans supported countless research.

The hypothesis lab mistake support ‚Äúwell could happen. Maybe messy‚Äù.

So yes. ‚Äúpossible‚Äù realistically likely? always try find safe explanations things actuality it‚Äôs terrifying. Nature sometimes random dangerous, sometimes don‚Äôt get control karen FIRST CLASS ticket.... read? Americans find difficult accept bad things countries well. Hell, puff mask. wish American Airlines kicked non mask wearing people recent flight take. best got verbal warning beginning passenger wearing mask ‚Äúmay not‚Äù able fly again. Agree 10000%

Bottom line, either going take new type vaccine work people going start taking better care themselves. American 3 4, global. course he's going say this.

/s  I'd like see no-mask-wearing right constitution might get confusing. ""i got covid 19. no, one""  miss New Zealand:( Hi sure. population work it‚Äôs uncommon types issues., I'm dad. course speaking deer situation USA deer population management general, since know anything whatever going Japan. guess right I'm ignorant feel subject, feel inference possible reasonable based know--that fact culling deer, least two methods deer population control. inferences good information, I'm trying assume anything, extrapolating. Note prefaced mass sterilization strategy 'maybe', I'm trying express absolute certainty anything. Given fairly brief previous response, think I'll go bit detail thought process here. care that, need bother reading further, I'm basically writing mental exercise anyway.

It's small proposition catch, sterilize, release significant number deer. kind thing either needs government funded come organization deep pockets. Government probably unless significant number population wanted it, can't imagine many organizations would enough resources desire little promise return investment. Maybe religion could get followers so, that's cared about.

If people general cared much deer pets would go sterilization strategy rather culling, death deer becomes intolerable. Maybe people temple care enough want best thing individual deer, since they're apparently going culling either care enough resources so, whether means money, followers, votes. glossed previous reply, sarcastically said 'good luck getting anybody pay that', hurried way without going depth subject. 

Let's clear, I'm saying one other. I'm trying make moral judgement here, I'm trying lay options see them. care continued existence health deer population ecosystem, culling (through hunting introducing predators) expedient tactic I'm aware of. care individual deer lives priority top that, would logically consistent pursue sterilization method since deer intelligent enough manage population. Also note lies spectrum much way care deer, relation things people care spend resources on.

Edits: word choice, specificity, punctuation. I'm... reasonably certain qualifies abuse days. Obviously called doctor cyborg.

Better like next time, Bill Gates. rare places, Alaska, .

People putting risk they're putting others risk too

And that's flaw argument: science based statistics skewed favor someone COVID (less 5% entire world's population COVID. 15 million cases vs. 7.8 Billion world population). 

Saying: ""you putting others risk"" statistically false statement based numbers currently available since assumes one COVID, which, mention, less 5% entire planet COVID. 

Someone STDs unprotected sex another person also STDs putting others risk STD. dessert 60s whole different beast now. hes suggesting problems old shit, satirically.

Die Leute die von dr√ºben kommen arbeiten hart. Ich habe noch kein Video von einer ""Karen"" gesehen die √ºber die Grenze kam, es sind nur ""Dump"" W√§hlerinnen. aber wo ich drauf hinaus wollte, Krankenversicherung abgeschafft, weil er keine Mexikaner sehen kann und das Land w√§re besser dran mit Krankenversicherung, ohne Frage. Im Wartezimmer elendig verrecken, weil man keine Krankenversicherung hat und deswegen den Arzt meiden muss und mit letzter Kraft dann doch √ºberleben will... Traurig zu sehen wie ein Mann seine Interessen durchsetzt und dabei nicht daran denkt das beste f√ºr das Volk ist. Egoismus auf ganz hohem Niveau... ich seh das immer noch so, es gibt kein schwarz oder wei√ü, jeder ist woanders Ausl√§nder, wir leben alle zusammen auf dem selben Planeten und sollten zusammen halten und nicht nur Interessen f√ºr sich selber oder f√ºr nur ein Land durchsetzen. Gemeinsam ist man stark und Zusammenhalt macht das Leben leichter und sch√∂ner mind cannot even conceive this. sincere apologies. *takes hat off* American Taiwan here. cannot think **medical** reason someone would wear mask, seen one... imagine people hooked oxygen tanks (for reasons covid19). 

What really bothers people playing religion card saying, ""God's great breathing aparatus..."" guys ""militarizing ordinary people encouraging stand 6 feet apart other"".

To people say masks ""communist tools"" dumb shit like that: Democratic Progressive People's party Taiwan, zero (or close zero) funding China, representative Tsai Ying Wen serving president country via democratic elections. **Masks voting issue here, need convinced otherwise, reading hand.

Fuh yeh!   Thanks much info!!!

I simplified interaction anonymity guess matter, actually took unmasked hike friend who's friend's brother covid. based data sent me, I'd unlucky get it. brother would've rare 9+ day incubation period, even would immediately transmit virus friend day 2, would transmit day 2. would've show symptoms 8 days pass hike, mostly facing talking anyway. Basically like 4 statistically unlikely things would've happen tandem, I'm gonna give 0.5% covid still scary, gonna isolate away parents now. 2 days ago got talking ""yelling"" coworker wear mask wants talk (She walks mask, takes mask presumes talk me, tell put mask back talk me, says able hear hear it. may raised voice claimed hear said talk then. IMO disrespectful thing time live in. Apparently little miss butt hurt tears must complained supervisors, course I'm blame). 

Today sent home home positive case office. announcement people still noses hanging removing masks speak. Fuck place hard. I'm going back. Praying test negative. literally getting people. completely hopeless. Screwing bell curve, acting like outliers. That's exactly someone microchipping everyone would say think /u/laserviking42 may correct... wait, there's more! different sorts rural areas different things going on, even within state.

If read OP article, note large prisons, Indian reservations, meatpacking plants, farms processing plants labor-intensive crops (e.g. potatoes berries opposed wheat) explain lot what's going on. Rural Arkansas, Alabama, desert areas eastern Oregon hard hit -- think people renting RVs flocking vacations. timing might related certain crops ready harvest.

If look closely map article, many mostly-rural counties excluded analysis *a* city (or little bit creeping suburbia city another county). particularly glaring looking western states counties larger eastern states. example, major outbreaks agricultural areas central Washington state really apparent map counties mid-sized cities. (In fact, per-capita number infections higher 9 agricultural counties counties comprise Seattle metro area.)

For travel-related thoughts....

Those dark orange areas map eastern Arizona northwestern New Mexico Navajo Apache reservations. dealing horrible infection rates beginning. tribes fighting keep outside visitors away people going anyways visit Grand Canyon parks.

Some rural areas ""touristy"" got hit pretty hard start outbreaks ski areas, like Sun Valley, ID places CO. pretty vocal wanting tourists (or people vacation homes) show up. Others took one look going (e.g. Pacific San Juan counties WA) pre-emptively told people cities stay away. orange blobs southern UT northwestern WY correspond locations national parks.

I know people love bash Cuomo NY here's really happened. Hospitals desperately needed ICU beds available. Stable, recovered patients sent home hospitals sooner would normal circumstances. one checking (or even knew) people still contagious. 

Where many people go home to? Nursing homes course. rule long nursing home said able take recovered patients safely could so. Many nursing homes clearly could so. issue identified addressed damage already done. 

In others words lot complicated people make be.  research previous pandemics. Even adding number up, doubt 73 000 new cases tested would reached, good since fears would already 80k+. Actual untested cases different story, though. Along countless redditors. Nah.

There's nothing inherently wrong patriotism leads ignorance personally believe issue it. think people could vouch idea American superiority people put display. I'm saying majority, least some.

Man Karen‚Äôs anti maskers killing people loved ones. hard wear mask?? ""They"" say this, Stalin think herd immunity fixed number? think scientists think same. Herd immunity relies R0 everywhere. Tuck dick underneath balls, shall achieve room temperature. also believe generation-defining event change society forever cause many take future pandemics much seriously.

I believe people buy maybe year slip old habits.  Hmm. discussing rational basis becoming personal. Would kindly ask discuss rational ;)
Anyway. business usual, state anything, wrong assumptions, doctors nurses pregnancy would indeed help cover dire need. 

On another note: 
Covid recognised global pandemic masses would say around February. Earliest December last year. women giving birth now, got pregnant that, fault. fault card play anyway.

Furthermore, stated before, lot countries Covid mostly control. see reason baby ;) Yeah, jumped straight saying short lasting immunity case Meh. Frank Dux fraud Bloodsport greatest film ever made. is. Regardless uneducated people try say, really simple. medical doctors earth say wearing mask causes problems. Fact. mistrust authority


They love authority unquestioningly, least authority wearing badges study cite poor. First say antibodies last 3 months. says ""antibody levels fell sharply three months"", imply reinfection possible 3 months. paper claimed 73 day half-life, even disputable since antibody kinetics follow simple exponential decay curve.

There's long thread florian krammer goes detail. I'll highlight 27th tweet whole Now, compare data labs? think actual data compares pretty well. lot 'oh god antibodies going down' headlines, lot data suggests slow expected decline months - think normal.""

We know exactly long antibody titers neutralizing activity last, poster responded claiming ""fear mongering"" 100% correct. There's evidence lasts 3 months reinfection. Stop spreading nonsense based science understand. remember story Wuhan poo-poo‚Äôd virus travelled length bus it‚Äôs true. 

We need accept something. fucking clue viruses work. think society everyone either wear masks shamed barred going grocery particularly healthy.  wonder gave trophies. I'm glad recovered problems. People KY seem understand partying outdoors people live making worse! live neighborhood lots people think 20-30 people pool parties every weekend fine. memory serves right, believe trump also dismantled pandemic response team, specifically place types situations ""he like idea people sitting around nothing."" 

Appreciate sharing information. Vietnam South Korea definetly set standards deal virus. Ik discussions meant become political politics definetly root issue within America.

This going echo back years. [a pretty good article published weeks ago explains Arizona poorly. Essentially mainly boils shut late reopened early aggressively. '*cause rasit frasit freeedomms partner*'    hbd ccp Bruh ur right language going shitter wtf u say lol Yet another way lcking tax-funded healthcare fucked US: many people dangerous medical conditions know it. :( Yeah, know someone works pharmacy said worst pandemic people wearing masks (our country never mask mandate) often scarier ones. Customers without masks would come in, quickly pick stuff leave, ones masks would often come sick and/or linger around chatting (often pulling mask speak), touching mask transferring germs products pharmacy. 

Masks good, avoiding spending long periods time indoors close contact people better - especially sick, applies illnesses, corona.  need chill fuck out. wear one 10 hours day Tokyo sometimes pull fucking thing cool take cold air.

Fist time heard Politics literally meanings.... truly never check dictionary....

It seems countries, everything served Politics . literally said 92.2% US Covid deaths people aged 55+. Like fact. Long term fact? Like characteristic trait virus, isn‚Äôt true everything said done.

The fact lot old people live communally, especially weakest live nursing homes, proves 92.2% going higher reality virus spread throughout population.

1st 80 year old catches HIV 40 year old catches HIV, going die sooner? playing odds?

2nd, old people can‚Äôt social distance well young people. dad 68 years old, lung transplant go Drs office checkups. Versus me, 40 year old doesn‚Äôt take risk, making 68 year old dad likely die.

Those two reasons alone prove 92.2% number inflated minimize virus. Maybe number 85% based two variables. Maybe true number 70%, higher lower. like said, people trying minimize virus. 

During pandemics, vulnerable elderly die first. Nursing homes ripe picking. vulnerable elderly.

They represented data early on. 

Right make case poor likely die, meat packers likely die, criminal makes likely die.

But isn‚Äôt true, means likely get early. me! Even though D*ath P*nel great name band. Honestly, stupidity Americans. kind stuff happens around world, every country uneducated population.  Considering stupid shit already read Twitter comes comments I'm sure go ahead try find doctor earth explains mask medically detrimental. scenario, person, problem all. 

Id love see article. wanted remind Americans thread easy overlook Asian nations like Vietnam South Korea practice dealing respiratory outbreaks. article mentions early paragraph - they've ready response plan since SARS outbreak 2003.


Now, get political, *was* response plan Trump administration could followed -- so-called pandemic playbook Obama left successor. Unfortunately, Trump denial COVID-19 about...this week.

Not political opinion, fact. leadership clearly fucked up.

Arizona, they're reporting testing times longer  precedent next responsibility countries say, ok, we'll handle ourselves. Yeah, moderate exercise (like biking kilometers buy groceries) wearing mask weather hot, that's it. impact airflow large enough cause issues rest, different need breathe much larger amounts air. Still excuse people wear they're indoors people. read yesterday places deaths taking 2 weeks report, even worse. Well, bad there's new case Vietnam today. end 99 days Vietnam found covid19 case.

I really envy parents autistic children deal this. imagine 10 year old would massive meltdowns it, bad enough labels t-shirts.  Many kids - families - soon closer god. Indeed, quite statistically get meet Jesus person. Bible Camp success! Underplays everything keep Trump's good side (aka. Fauci) That's good question, PTSD real debilitating.

My answer, regular person suffers PTSD something else, continue therapy, maintain distance people, stay planes confined spaces able wear mask. able try (when ready right conditions), practice spaces take mask almost immediately without affecting/jeopardising others, come quickly easily become triggered (ie, planes).

It's unfortunate, grossly inconvenienced part recovery.

As someone suffers PTSD, accept this. Instead complaining feeling like shit can't do, focus glad survived alive. time therapy, become easier, maybe possible, time things currently put through.

I'm saying flawless response, understand complicated people ""need"" go certain things. best I've got way still respects lives people around us. is/was empathy every prior flu season?

Fucking sucks. PTSD endangering others, absolutely need treatment. said PTSD causing injure others, you‚Äôre still wrong, even understand cause.

Example, get PTSD fireworks go fireworks show. proceed punch guy next show, you‚Äôre still guilty assault. really begs question went fireworks show first place given condition. I‚Äôm saying I‚Äôm sympathetic world isn‚Äôt responsible conditions. responsible finding appropriate way navigate it. it‚Äôs loud noise triggered PTSD, maybe avoid places fireworks. Maybe invest good noise canceling headphones white noise machine home. Likewise psychologic issue preventing mask wearing maybe look alternative coving products (like beekeeper helmets face shield) maybe consider ordering delivery friend family member get items. one thing sure, world isn‚Äôt changing need find way operate it.

I'm arguing masks next statement, virus deadly enough, asystematic transmission rate, justify excluding small amount people doctors note mask exemption.

I think requesting doctors notes shop regular stores exemption insanity, flying flight especially internationally many people tight confines makes sense require doctors note exemption. ...do think informed positive test result immediately fall dead? wear mask, I'm sold efficacy. virtually scientific consensus, despite mainstream sources feed heads attempt form worldviews.  

I hate masks. make look sick (no need point anything sarcastic actually sick, obvious thinking). nuisance minimalist (I already hate carrying keys wallet). cannot ""read"" people, communication suffers. nonverbal covered mask. dehumanized wearing all. recognition awareness / friendliness others clearly down.  taking emotional toll many people. respiratory system effective without filter, body designed covering mouth nose.

You asked people hate masks much. I've innate loathing masks - every cell body hates wearing hate looking society. awhile, masks mandated, think much it, intuitively hated masks care why. recently I've tried uncover biases that's far I've got - couple reasons above.

Some things work better others, hope everyone find something works best them. Percentandate? Especially checked bags. remember one lady pushing past everyone waiting baggage carousel. Sure, parents watching amateur travel video town Italy taken two weeks.

Hi still pj's pic even., I'm dad. Sorry, food brain... press X doubt Asthma claim though I'd curious hear Doctor explain more. seems wearing mask would exceptionally good idea compared catching COVID also suffering Asthma.

PTSD... yeah that's complicated. could see specific types Trauma getting involved though. People time-limited visa's expired recently. dunno, figure hypothetical scenario, there's *some* hypotheticals here. It‚Äôs odd. don‚Äôt remember Saying government couldn‚Äôt force mandate. said would sorted court. 
Ok mandate it. sign people still refuse. people complying they‚Äôre forced. protest mask. problem solve control freak? LA Basin disproportionately represented. LA, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino Ventura counties together 48% state's population 61% reported cases 71% deaths. Add San Diego that, 56.2% total population, 67.2% reported cases, 77.7% deaths. Kern Imperial counties great either.

Santa Barbara San Luis Obispo counties places Southern California. (OK, OK, always so.)

As proud NORTHERN Californian, relief sort see problem South. OTOH, quite troubling Imperial county bad is. Maybe blame Arizona. parents used one 3rd time vomited table. say fully ""desensitise"" it, got slightly better at...enduring time? still find unpleasant stamina it.

I'm sure think good comparison, perhaps like swimming/bathing/showering cold/icy water? almost painful feeling first submerge fades away bit, stop noticing cold water. provide *reasonable* accommodation. accommodation causes undue burden, business obligation it. Naa thats morning hair. I'm still pj's pic even. Basically people want wear one fake doctor's note much larger scale someone actually real one. undue burden airline try verify true health condition.

If literal matter life death move someone person could chartered small plane. literal matter life death different form transit limits risk person could found.

I‚Äôve road different places (both outside US), general experience indeed different culture road depending are. Texas cities get pretty bad (and BLATANTLY illegal like driving shoulder, cutting barriers, etc) cities higher populations always seem worse, places without public transportation FAR worse due lack options.

TLDR. places indeed worse traffic others, every place SOMETHING struggle regards driving traffic, though ‚Äúoverall worst‚Äù logged somewhere. Thats nice.. dont make airline policy laugh idea good news. mean, guess is, category ""news stated obvious"". It‚Äôs also people responsible government calling people sacrifice greater good. fathom people screaming freedom freaking mask.

FTFY

Capitalism actually small businesses get started. I‚Äôm sadly surprised presented choice losing losing big always seem go latter.

But result bad choices fucking things many...? keep waiting another peak. tomorrow yet?

It peaks every week worldometer, reaching local maxima Friday. Last peaks article, week \[72k\], week \[59k\]. tomorrow another peak. I'm county next door one. similarly well flooded Abbot opened up. 800,000 people county 1.5 million region includes Starr county. region one poorest obese regions country death rate reflecting that. terrible see home quickly go damn bad, cant fucking believe going on. Hi tarrant county instances mask wearing come mind auto shop went today (they donned one walked in) lyft driver picked dropped car., I'm dad.

Endemic anti-intellectualism, mistrust authority, narcissism, rising antisocial tendencies belief conspiracy theories brought social decay, etc. remember first starting wear masks 8 hours straight, thought going need burn leave get it.

For first week, *so* uncomfortable. 100% felt like slowly suffocating practice mindful breathing order panic attacks...

...and week ended ever since, completely forget I‚Äôm even wearing mask time. feels completely natural.

It takes bit patience self control. Two traits seems US falls short on. literally bullshit. mind blowing many companies US including mine allowing customers store without mask ""medical conditions"" threatening workers serving customers.

Basically comes order fight virus people care others. pandemic potential indictment humanity ability care things beyond self interests far many people failing simple test. seen it‚Äôs mainly children bc masks big sad people wanted meet someone + children running time that.

Ok, let's compare 9/11 COVID. shut planes 9/11 potential another terrorist attack, even grounded planes 3 days. 

Shutting air travel would completely destroy already destroyed airline industry, would also make incredibly hard form emergency travel take place. parents live Maine, live LA.. something bad happens one would take 3 days minimum drive there. one number reasons *not* shut air travel.
