""Free-rider"" problem, solution people rational. Selfishness morally wrong, large number people, becomes problem everyone. One friends autoimmune disease precludes getting vaccine. I'll mask everyone else can't appreciate thoughts. proud myself, especially considering quit cigarettes around time booze. Stats county 1 million ppl MD

I worried covid anymore. 20-year-old bartender also much higher chance spreading virus others 40-year old working home. reading. reference death literally telling severe disease young vaccinated people almost rare death. clearly stated... Telling ""I also worried less severe also exceedingly rare thing happening!"" great point.

But please, share class data (or literally anything) many young, **vaccinated** people experiencing brain nerve damage virus. That's specifically mentioned done schooling degree back home valid. I'll edit comment clarity. Respect candor self-reflection/self-awareness. seem like good fellow. Amen. don’t want greet 2022 feeling every hospital door read: ABANDON HOPE, YE ENTER HERE. way happens say enough enough. You’re absolutely correct that.  bridge China North Korea thier imports come on. Goods trucked across bridge (its called friendship bridge) unloaded country. lots Chinese workers coming going normally, trade declined past year, never cut completely. Base - I'm day shift I'll get afternoon weekend differentials first RN job I'm happy! BBC article. may show BBC news channel. Damn. sad rn never seizes amaze government sees big threat China world every manner, except maybe Japan &amp; America slightly. Yes! Kind mix latex feet. 

On side, lost lot weight--but forcing eat kind depressing. instinctive, animal drive.  Lol  Oh shot, stand corrected. I'm Sacramento myself, northern California. I'd say 50/50 people choose wear mask. lot stores seems employees longer wear masks. I've given multiple examples. ignore them.

At point, clear real conversation this. wrong, know wrong, discuss good faith. That's remotely said. Someone made claim Delta variant affects children ""much more.""

I also seen data support this. provided data. people spread bullshit new variant ""is much dangerous young people!"" since first variant discovered, proving bullshit.

So perfectly reasonable ask source clearly alarmist claim. Responding ""they're immune!"" arguing point literally one arguing. think least Americans may anti-mask *truly still somehow understand* world, can’t go get vaccinated, unique incredible level vaccine access US. It’s little frustrating there, areas, aren’t vaccinated yet *is* choice It’s probably best generalize say “Those MRNA vaccines don’t need wear masks vaccines do” That’ll create problems. Stop talking well? best thing talk instead them. Granted, everyone willing conversation, but, example, friend family member, providing positive sources vaccines respectfully talking situation way better shouting them. may able convince outright, hopefully planted seed get come around, hopefully sooner later too. remember people come conclusion need get vaccinated accord, forced to.  guy reports reports time. think gets data PHE.  hope hospital systems follow suit: I’m looking illinois! Kimmy got Rona. Sorry, going recalled them. Physics, Trig, Calc, Lin Alg, Engineering, etc. add that, anyone seen documentary “Collective,” Best Foreign Film Best Documentary year’s Oscars, they’ll better understand total lack trust government healthcare system Romania. I’m even 3 years besides want leave forever. hear “patient satisfaction” one time…

Good forbid room 56 didn’t get cold water instantly dealing 88 year old swinging us thinks kidnapped them. Poor thing nurses hospital got 10% raise today. really wasn’t enough, something meant lot suffering I'm worried it. reading comments? Obviously based last reply, brings death again.

Many people, young included, get covid lose smell, neurological condition. think fair want avoid brain nerve damage. Good idea. Hopefully rest EU follows. answer right here. Canada, government invested heavily highly diversified portfolio vaccines, worked brilliantly. blood clot issue hit AZ, Pfizer fall back on. Pfizer supplies got cut back June, lucked huge boost Moderna shipments.

The main problem strategy presumably spent ungodly sums money vaccines we'll never need, donate excess countries, carries diplomatic benefits.

The Australian federal government seems bet heavy number common incorrect assumptions, like assuming pandemic would now, certain vaccines safer bet. thought could stay isolated vaccine rolled out, realize could end month 15 without reliable supply. ambassadors travel, I'm like 1000% Kim Jong-un flies Russian hookers reg  No, keep giving example I've repeatedly told measured months, time period evolution. Come man. still unvaccinated? excuse? vaccine available free Walmart, cvs &amp; Walgreens. easy get almost everyone gotten point intentionally getting vaccinated. think expected change behavior protect conspiracy minded anti-vaxxers.  cousin moved Colorado hometown kind trap. going follow him, really think good idea. read Octavia Butler's novel *Parable Sower*? terrifying accurately predicted turmoil that's going west coast. write family tell son statistical abnormality. hospitals reaction put quit date? People still go out. It’s easy foreigners get North Koreans get out, possible. took infected people going back January February 2020.

I also believe borders China Russia lot less restricted infamous DMZ NK SK cases could’ve come there. Well...duh? Ugh sucks. easy either. contacted home state's BON? seems comment contains 1 links hard tap mobile users.

I think done point. change mind matter what. refers strain virus – background strain – contains major mutations  Oh yeah buddy. worked one profit HMO southern cal...what CEO made, incredible. One strange thing, supposed union rules, none auditors could union, bad audits could get fired ( riiiiiiight) claims adjusters made auditors. also boss hell. ones surprise, 90% audits done India, may evil plan along severe illness young, vaccinated people rare death. Telling ""I also worried *less severe* also *exceedingly rare* thing happening!"" great point.

Also wearing helmet leave house protect death. Head injuries could certainly affect ways too! Please explain wear helmet going walk street.  don’t understand what’s strange amount pushing it. It’s vaccine virus killed hundreds thousands people US past 16 months, shut economies, long-term ability control virus relies large percentage population getting vaccine. That’s strange, it’s logical. ""COVID-19 also cause heart problems young people. study JAMA Cardiology found 2.3 percent collegiate athletes recovered COVID-19 symptoms myocarditis."" working travel nurses making $90/hr got 40 hours week. Yeah $50-70 OT OT definitely $90+/hr. Fuck em. also discriminate assholes people wear socks sandals. 'Stupid' protected class I'm happy help hand Darwin awards cool. shame yep- way better get Covid19 spread around…  quite bad Delta Prime Delta Superior. Three days week work like positive hospital nurse. changed normal work week everyone would leave jobs aren’t bedside. Bedside nursing fucking sucks period I've always like reference article explanation hospital Bite Costs North Carolina Couple $89,000 Hospital hospital, Lake Norman Regional, defended pricing statement newspaper: “Hospitals collect small percentage charges, ‘list prices.’ required give Medicare one level discount list price, Medicaid another, private insurers negotiate still others. … start list prices have, would end enough revenue remain operation. … costs providing uncompensated care partially covered higher bills seen number can't confirm it.

What also vital understand looking statistics often (not always) measurements protection 2 weeks. get one dose protection continue improve well 2 weeks, specific statistic flawed kind comparison. already lot good data showing effectiveness continues build many weeks afterwards countries delayed dosing schedules. theory, mask unvaccinated die off?? won’t take generation, give take. guess running big dogs...we monthly ice cream bar.

I work vets office...I like pts. much better. Thanks. bounced back super quickly. never ever get sick kind expected vigorous immune response! Definitely something consider. I'm healthy, reasonably young, vaxed. socialize vaccinated people (no children elderly day day life) live low transmission area. Still wearing mask places businesses, restaurants, wearing one outside. **For me**, appropriate level risk mitigation vs mental health. **For public health** continue follow indoor mask guidelines coffee shops, grocery stores subway. even make sense. Look dude, rambling point can't come single coherent example concluding must happening here. We're getting anywhere, I'm done - hope nice day figure eventually. I’m blown away comments like downvoted. Coronavirus subreddit overrun anti-maskers… first grants protection already.

The efficacy one shot Delta something like 35% symptomatic cases. Full vaccination around 79% effective. fellow citizens forfeited protection thumbed nose vaccine. 

As everyone else, since “zero Covid” impossibility, wearing masks protect compromised cannot receive vaccine public forever? I’m decently attractive white girl misfo actually around white supremacists younger years. One things found horrible would purposely try pull Jewish black people minorities thought funny convince friends. don’t know quite explain it, like ‘cool kids’ bringing ‘the nerd‘ could make fun something mean road. totally conscious cruelty, got thought proved superiority. fucking horrifying- people didn’t believe “they aren’t skinheads, they’re Ska’.

Jean-Paul Sartre almost risk major negative consequences virus. Though true adults, children know fact COVID really *is* like flu. fact, flu much likely kill them.

Did mask flu season? mask ensure bring home? ensure little contact anyone possible?

If want protect kids, make wear helmet every time leave house. would literally safety benefit adjusting life way protect COVID tad bit ridiculous. Plus easily afford health insurance you’re making 40k 3 months lol Agreed. Cake death. know, we're low cake. Alpha? Pretty sure UK US restrictions place Alpha's rein. longer case. 

Look UK. see cases hospitalizations increasing, evem among vaccinated. 

You extrapolate much see thing happen here. That’s true, hope that’s is. apparently didnt read spoiler content. piece fabric, stomp everything achieved. Read carefully responding generic ""its piece cloth!"" hospital union. don’t really make money hospitals. anything could make somewhere else. pay capped years experience. plenty friends making non union hospitals. real shame shut twitter account. one following since early pandemic great scientific insight. 

What world experts like attacked point stop sharing knowledge. much worse it. sad thing vacuum likely filled ignoramuses, conspiracy theorists, xenophobes. This.

Now, first time getting actual preferential treatment appearance, mix luck (blooming) hard work able improve, faces existe anymore time turn finally enjoy social life? like waiting long time turn game watching everyone else plays, say ""well times over"" time going turn. unfair, infuirating huge ""haha waited worked nothing"". Specially almost lifelong ""project"".

A mask mandate shielded many things. Outdoors mandate lifted days ago bit people started showing faces (me one them). started receiving looks interest first time year mask fucking invisible. also get treated bit cold without mask stores wait till indoors mandates go aswell. need therapy, need face back, fact instantly started getting things absent life since year ago soon could show visage proves it.

I willing get vaccinated going go soon im called. dont care many vaccines get many boosters, want masks society. people seem developed stockolm syndrome fucking love almost fetish tier masks everywhere, fear lot country people pushing back masks even vaccinated. one dropped outdoors mask, people saying willing mask forever even covid. hope case fear society (at least country) forever tainted masks.

I treated. worked HARD get good treatment people life deserve work wasted everyone else ugly past got enjoy former life preferential treatment faceless. cares face cover soon go out? like car never allowed get garage. also bad skinny body narrow shoulders face thing countered (and well, happy overall), got extra fucked masks. Im brad pitt hot, im average features stand enough compensate bad body. way face covered outdoors mandates happening again, therapy. went therapy years younger thing solved life problems look better, therapy scam waste time problems practical solutions (like case, said, automatically solved looking better).

Its something simple mask. anticlimatic end DECADE long journey effort, hope, perseverance hard work money spent made self harm. big ""HAHA GOT CHEATED"" slapping cover finally achieved long, got better teeth, mask covers it, got better jawline, mask covers it, got better skin, mask covers it, got masseter correction procedure, mask covers it, cheekbones visible now, mask covers on... fact like paragraph, started getting hints better treatment soon face could seen again, proof enough need therapy, need masks stay out. vaccine neighbor thing happen got lambada strain apparently. 

They said passed 31 flavors. didn’t bad reaction either? miniscule reaction money goes administration executives. doctor’s pay isn’t causing control costs. doctors would much prefer nurses support them, doctors don’t decide staffing. That’s executives administrators. Presumably it’s protect lack desire get vaccine  [Instead burnout, let's call really - moral I’ve worn mask year plus without complaint. I’ve gotten myself, family, friends, coworkers vaccinated. I’m die hard lefty I’m done wearing mask unless new evidence shows vaccine isn’t effective massive outbreak happens. Transmission low NJ everyone know vaccinated. Don’t immune compromised people life. I’m wearing mask protect someone refuses get vaccinated. everyone wants stop wearing mask think. nuance less vulnerable someone never Covid vaccine. slightly vulnerable someone Covid vaccine. Infection mediated immunity somewhat hard predict. also get least one dose vaccine, immunity certain. understand UK much better US this. suppose less wait see approach 'actual science', might ask? far know, sars-cov virus 20-30 nanometers, thus n-95 maximum filtration surgical top preventing aerosols entering body first place. Thanks sharing! COVID definitely felt like brain processing slowed down. would try think words able retrieve etc. experience anything degree. Thankfully improved since then! part multi ministry covid taskforce, also includes minister health minister industry trade.

These fact original portfolios cabinet reshuffled twice since taskforce set up. However continued helm taskforce even roles cabinet changed.  sure. think people deserve educated news surrounding vaccines positive negative. I'm means anti-vax, pro-education. Gotcha thanks! makes sense cuz know ones least likely wear mask unless required. get vaccinated insurance middlemen, use salary pay nurses, EZ PZ

Ftfy... amount waste getting armies people overcharge haggle process crap insane. Yes, missing information article. camp teenagers. Everyone attendance eligible vaccination. Irrelevant context =/= contextualize. 

I ask again: relevant article? Tbf physically active males 30, also serious Vaccines effective reducing spread masks (statistically it’s even order magnitude). want reduce spread work getting people vaccinated. Wearing masks you’re vaccinated window dressing point unless live children IC people life. strongly recommend seeking medical advice medical professional, Reddit.

The [CDC's Yes, vaccinated regardless whether already COVID-19.

(There's lot detail link.) come back? I’ve mostly tasteless smell-less (other weird smells tastes we’re talking about) since March 6th. 16 weeks Saturday :( 

please give hope actually got fucking answer someone, unironically, seatbelt comparison. Yeah removing faces huge deal human warmth communication entirely society completely reasonable. I'm happy he's dead I'm frustrated opinion changed affected personally. People realizing vaccines good catching probably spreading virus counterintuitive.  Maybe convince get vaccine. One hope Mmm soul soup. blood clots serious condition. media people acting like Delta changes everything. suddenly vaccines answer much masks are. Yes, it’s transmissible really effect areas low vaccinations

We need focus hospitals overrun preventing deaths. mean need wear masks focus cases. don’t know you, don’t want live rest life Covid restrictions masks lingering everyday 

The sky falling yet entire media acting like end world asteroid hit thought kids 12 could get vaccinated. Makes sense summer camp would mostly unvaccinated population. missing something? Oh no, talking country origin, everywhere even middle woods. quick Google search showed 12.6 per million   1. Children 12 really say matter
2. People truly unable get vaccine strong reaction it.  say it’s even important pancreas 652 Covid deaths Tuesday, beating previous mortality  
record 635 set height Russia’s second wave Dec. 24.  certainly differences parties, people may view one worse based personal politics. Ultimately, however, parties answer masters: Wall Street, lobbyists, MIC, corporate far damaging country past decades really close.

Hmm. I'll agree based simply actions Bush Jr. wars military adventures Middle East extremely damaging US' image abroad soft power, mention loss life economic damage US countries US invaded bombed.

Of course, came Obama. Elected clear mandate reverse worse Bush' policies, instead made drone bombing bipartisan rather taking table entirely. also expanded US' violent involvement Lybia, Syria, Yemen. 

And Democratic base preferred blindly support Obama, rather holding feet fire. no, Democrats much better. opportunity better, squandered favour blind partisan Democrat's board fuckery, yes- legislative head count clear party side obstructive legislative behavior harmful policy decisions.

Sure. Republicans worse two estimations 9though obviously Republicans would disagree). fact remains parties failed deliver, due obstruction ***evil opposition***, failure electorate rise petty partisan games **hold goddamned leaders accountable**.

The Democrat base showed inability hold Obama account entirety administration, forgive sound sympathetic complaints. turned away parties disgust, view yet done little slow head.  deadly many different symptoms. hard believe easy many people suffered.  I’m still disaster manager research gigs. starting border medicine/crisis position soon (Mexican side). works hospital CA apparently already working plans things if/when get bad Based I’m wearing mask anymore unless delta shown evade vaccines significantly. Im sure many posters didnt even full mandate country, strictest mask rules entire globe. Poeple must assume im talking indoor/shops mask rule, puny comparison had. country, even fucking alone woods still wear one. basically ""you visage all"". isn't. drugs?  Alcohol? Jumping planes dangerous, tell someone it.

If someone know would drugs, drink much/too often jump planes, would worried would talk it. Also, covid-19 contagious, drinking, taking drugs jumping planes aren't. sure know confuse public. Getting vaccinated best thing do. oh wait sorry you’re protected still wear mask even though told weeks ago don’t to

They spent months telling us vaccines path normal panic every time there’s variant. say least it’s really confusing Death rates unvaccinated people higher expected.

Which headline would rather see? now? Great know, thank you!  evidence we’re seeing people reinfected higher rate delta variant. We’ve seen many studies showing long term natural immunity quite strong strains. Could possible delta different sure unlikely given seeing reports reinfections increasing drastically far I’ve seen. reasonable subjected absolutely draconian mask rules long outside house mask on, seeing countries world indoor mandates. time later countries still fare good without outdoors mandate realize incredibly strict mask mandate nothing. I'm low risk lot people family that's got vaccine way back April. problem mentality whether get vaccinated affects people contributes longer pandemic. 

I'm sick virus shit already want life go back normal. getting vaccinated that. Translation: vaccinated anyone, masks, PPE decent hospitals, half population already starving. they're dying like flies. point, 99.993% adults wanted vaccine gotten it. ship sailed. far trusting vaccine, again, would gotten it, already, don’t, never will. know we're supposed talk understanding conspiracy rural anti vaxxers/hesitant really get Healthcare worker (not nurse)- burnout, pessimism future, always cutting costs, always staffed, always losing perks, always working harder/more, tasks added note- covid. 

Then honestly everyone kept working public facing work without help even extra pay essentially told go f themselves. 

Nope. America find short lot positions healthcare. want jump thank (can't bring say 'y'all' yet) help suggestions. Really giving lot think much confidence getting back workforce. Much appreciated. San Diego County generally weekly covid update Wednesday afternoons. last week's update, 16 known cases Delta variant, 1 hospitalization, deaths. almost ... need paid more. Yep. talk nursing shortage plenty nurses. shit job get treated like dog shit patients management day get washed profession quickly. Nursing reform needs happen good luck that. Asnwer question. country full time mask rule? nothing preventing living till masks came, happiest time life. answer question first. would like compare to? Japan also outpacing Australia, South Korea, Malaysia daily doses. gotta tell you....from unfortunately vast experience doctors, they're getting paid much, nurses enough. hospital 2 months. doctor spent, literally, five minutes day room, day. However, nurses damn day, nitty gritty, disgusting, repetitive bullshit. hospital. Going regular doctor even disappointing. digestive issues years, told many different doctors, none jack-shit. mentioned regular doctor thought maybe giardia since diarrhea getting worse, suggest anything it. even went allergy specialist, tests came back clear, told god. actual fuck point doctors???

I know fuck people go college fifty years spent shit ton money spend barest amount people, give slightest over, pawn pills them, heave door. 

And yes, know doctors perform complicated surgeries, actually use training, help people. comes day-to-day, could something better there. words wear mask forever could always spread virus? know probably don’t mean mean point gets old. Vaccines end game pandemic - literally people told

Now tell doesn’t matter still wear mask might get virus spread When’s Ontario... I've last 15 months I'm getting pretty sick Yup im vaxed face sore masks. alleric reation (not masks) face blew im prednisone makes immunocompramised. wear mask im finishing up. Plus face still bit puffy want cover it. masks irritating face. sensitive skin. Hense allergic reation. Im getting point uncomfortable hot hell Lol can’t believe said heart extremely important.
No way I’m really sorry you’re shamed opening individual situation instead treated empathy compassion here.  acutely aware this, sadly know what's wasteful? Paying CEO United Healthcare $18M salary. I’m generally going wear mask got deleted said bored going “talk” certain “groups” FB. Never ending source entertainment facts confuse them. Another good tip. Thank you! One good friends works care management department dealing insurance companies, etc strictly non clinical positions. actually offered spot one point hired nurse would huge pay cut. Good know places positions nurses tho. Science always binary. degrees safety. 12 ft better 6ft 6 ft better 3 ft. etc. etc. Masking going safer non-masking, vaccinated not.

The decision advise wearing masks calculation assumed vaccinations would increase it. Vaccinated people infect others reduced rate (some estimates say 50% relative unvaxed, like protection severe illness) enough people vaccinated offset no-masking masks might come back.

Additionally, given Delta ~60% contagious original variant slower hoped vaccination rate, may CDC's calculations masking might need make difference Delta caused. state stripping away liberty name “greater good” defined one basic tenets authoritarianism. Get fucked. would hope governments avoid backing lifting mask directives statements like this.

Unfortunately, places like Israel shown us yes, *can* play law. Hopefully United States though, that's bad idea. Makes sense that’s people. people get vaccine one reason another don’t want to. I’m masking rest life someone else’s decision get vaccinated People chemotherapy aren’t going bars high risk indoor areas. terribly insensitive comment person’s mental health emotional well-being. Please take good look inward bully someone brave enough open like again. I’m guessing it’s latter. really think unvaccinated suddenly wear mask people wear mask told don’t to?

I think tell everyone wear masks again, it’s going cause distrust vaccines people assuming aren’t effective still wear mask even vaccinated I'm familiar BC's mask mandate. everywhere outside house indoor/enclosed spaces? “We learn live like people 40 years ago seatbelts!!” /s would say mask proponent asked what's wrong wearing mask, informed one easiest measures obey?  Assuming I've covid way back (early 2020) normal/Noname variant recovered fully, body already natural antibody right? fare delta variant? vulnerable unvaccinated person never contracted covid first place? Thanks mind explaining got biotech nursing?? Ok, I’m marking words way could known.... big upper bound. There's subreddit long covid though. question long last own, cure it. Research ongoing. can’t wait get new vaccine delta. new one every subsequent variant. may sleep doctors office! 600,000+ die vax US alone? point 1 isn’t necessary isn’t related topic. RNs stayed bedside went NP. point 2 explains anti-NP post RN exodus topic, physician APPs actually helping provide care don’t wanna see ER cases maybe boring you. physician, cannot speak RN folks act like feel burden. Nurses overworked undervalued. much responsibilities little pay. Stick topic, hospitals pay travelers, raise pay full time RNs. issues NPs unrelated reserved another discussion. go get work Doctor instead using work time lurking Reddit advancing anti NP propaganda. mean like we’ve hearing year? No. cannot fix stupid. One degree separation, know 5 severe cases, 3 dead 2 almost died. people moronic believe serious point - let whatever happens happen. given medical attention. could care less. would it? Viruses cause mycarditis. Covid infection cause higher rate vax. cool updates! Thanks them. Fascinating. makes complete sense. also demonstrates Singapore spread may world. Good luck guys :( Yes, here's think could get bit touchy. 
Because may legitimate reason person refuse vaccine. Whether religious reasons unknown disability. 

Federal EEO laws prevent employer requiring employees physically entering workplace vaccinated COVID-19, long employers comply reasonable accommodation provisions ADA Title VII Civil Rights Act 1964 EEO considerations. laws, EEOC’s jurisdiction, may place additional restrictions employers. EEO perspective, employers keep mind individuals demographic groups may face greater barriers receiving COVID-19 vaccination others, employees may likely negatively impacted vaccination requirement. want bigwigs provide us support resources us trying work done 2 people. way actually provide decent patient care made many us go healthcare first place. guess value human life? start getting ontop like FLU, think random variants huge affect people's health. EVERYONE vaccinated, wearing mask human thing do.   things completely true. don’t think people emphasize violence part enough. general population become increasingly violent year year Covid made incredibly worse. number staff we’ve department due injuries violent patients year mind blowing. short staffed baseline, constantly people leave heal added stress. put forth suggestions improve safety administration, get told it’s expensive. think PTSD job. Things going get worse opinion. I’m super close saying screw driving Uber eats something get by. incredibly blue part America, prioritize bartenders. know person from, think caring restaurant staff high states lists. can't journos bloody math state front instead trying sensationalize something.

I'm saying saying wrong, really wish mandatory articles like state everything factually front, like x people showed signs previously would expected see z people. hard this? /s basically need mix opiates vaccine trigger dopamine response then? /s  Stop interfering domestic matters 

Except it’s time send PPE, oxygen, vaccines stuff. it’s cool. Hi yes I'm planning get vaccine unfortunately due circumstances [male mid 20s healthy prior medical issue] I'm pretty way priority list lol. vaccine rollout country pretty slow. I'm worried abt time gap getting shot.  That’s mask mandate ended everyone PA. would people wear one told don’t need to. Meh 
Yes, course. turn result procedural shortcoming equipment malfunction, need understand prevent future. That's said I'd like answer day. want answer right answer, wait scientists thing.

Do think current public debate subject helpful goal detrimental? think unhelpful (at best).

This interview linked written New York Post today headline ""Australian scientist worked Wuhan can’t rule COVID lab-leak theory."" meaningful sentence entire interview them. Confirmation bias finest.

My feeling (in case already obvious) political hacks stay leave important puzzle people actually quite good solving puzzles.

OP, mean comments criticism link posted. actually quite nice read POV actual scientist ground unfolded. frustration political hacks already decided want answer be. It’s british sure getting downvoted, road ahead definitely vaccinating living *with* virus happy he’s dead? zero sympathy. guesses vaccines causing heart inflammation? Yup, sounding warning trend that's ballooned control. happens people exchange individuality critical thinking skills team shirt, whether shirt's color red blue. need pump numbers up, vaccine's production rate low. Yeah hope know people wearing masks begin with. They've using ""I health condition can't ask HIPPA/ADA"" get wearing mask. guess what? Almost retail stores restaurants allow go maskless even though that's bullshit excuse. 

They wearing masks, social distancing, routinely mock even harass try enforce mask policy, shit help. care anymore. 

My work ""allowed"" (off book) enforce mask mandates. got store 100% mask compliance every shift. spit on, coughed on, called f*ggot, almost beaten. I'm done caring people. someone posted elsewhere sense taste started returning 30 mins vaccine.

i questions Nurses underpaid dudes suits sitting asses make billions. Pay nurses teachers better we’ll nurses teachers divide work. see comments delta big Israel, also see sample size like 100 infections day. What’s actual stats here? today reported death count likely twice high. listening warnings coming Israel regards Delta variant. also recommends masks variant. funny, I'd already seen Atlantic article, early May. point time, feel continuing take precautions extreme, vaccine coverage lot lower almost everywhere, bit less data, etc. now...its ridiculous. Either people risk averse planet, point can't fathom driving car, they're simply touch reality. Clearly science longer matters.  People “forced” state vaccinate want attend public school.   Well, worry small children aren’t eligible vaccine yet. COVID seems mild/asymptomatic them. Really there’s scenarios would consider sort restrictions vaccinated people worth it. Vaccines “endgame” get get. Unvaccinated adults deal consequences actions. new variants irrelevant comes danger children. keep hearing ""This new variant dangerous!"" ""It targets young people!"" never proves true.

If want excuse scared, want excuse scared.

But please explain masked children flu season, virus likely kill them. presumably allow go park play tag friends without wearing helmet. They're hell lot likely get brain injury die accident serious deadly case COVID.

When people pretend something much riskier actually is, perfectly ok tell people they're absurd. I'm surprised, PHO consistently operates defiance scientific consensus. reason epidemiologists expressed concerns response. Harvard educated epidemiologists, Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding, called BC Florida Canada. Australian epidemiologists, Dr. Zoe Hyde, described approach schools horrifying. Resorting extreme forms carrots sticks North American mindset. doesn’t apply lots places. It’s worth remembering that.  33% caps out. previous study PHE showing reduction severity breakthrough cases, 1 shot reduced chances death 33%. 66% 2nd shot (+ time). 
 
1 shot made sense earlier dealing a) older variants b) vaccine supply shortage. 
 
At point one-shot people getting related unvaccinated people 2-dosed. virus continue try evolve planet foreseeable future. Trying get protected / vaccinated people mask sole purpose preventing evolution like taking one drug dealer corner. Always another corner another guy take spot Seen multiple reported cases happening k.

Meh, proove it. aren’t ok. Everyone uses daycare argument it’s 4-5 year thing. fact property taxes car home much daycare payment 140 week daycare home 180,000 value car 6-7 year old camry 2 combined state 4500 property taxes. seem rocketing off, explains delay re-opening. 4th July Sturgis look forward to. Again. *sibling

Mea culpa. typed wrong word. Apollo doesn’t let view previous comments composing reply. matter?  sub truly become echo chamber. ridiculous comment even upvoted all.

We Anthony Fauci today stating clearly CDC recommendations would change. vaccinated, Delta variant involved, chance severe illness extremely low (over 96% efficacy), chance symptomatic infection low (88% efficacy), chance asymptomatic infection low (79%), data far indicated even infected, chance transmission massively reduced vaccinated. anyone asks sources, many posted sub already. 

Move lives people.  interesting interactive chart. keep seeing thing over: 30-50 year old female foreign domestic worker Indonesia Malaysia leads 70-80 year old native Singaporean retiree. housekeepers? right, come. Unvaccinated people continue die. sad also reality. agree need held accountable one person gets sick they’ve stores public get blamed? It’s good society. Hmm...this reminds changed 4 kn95s since april. wonder look like pizza hutt U mean tell country charges average Joe’s $600,000 spider bite can’t afford pay nurses? Nope. Wore mask year. data showing vaccines still effective Delta variant see reason wear one.  We're keeping available. point blinking now. Maybe hospital setting. Otherwise, n95 masks last quite long time breaking down. Typically, cheaper disposable type fail strap connection points better ones typically fail metal nose piece breaks. live Tennessee. Masks optional even mandate.

*vaguely gestures everything* understanding vaccinated people still spread virus, even affect personally. 

I'm sure applies US, UK reasoning big rise cases among unvaccinated could enough overwhelm health services, thereby putting everyone danger, including people vaccinated.

Basically health services already knees another wave would mean even delays everything else that's put pause (surgeries, cancer screening, etc) pandemic.

There's reasons, eg protecting vulnerable, lowering chance new deadlier variants appearing, etc. imo that's main one.

You need materials scientist see 😉 vaccinated Americans get BC?? Hmmm, read places, quite simple. also depends healthy 80 year olds are. weak sickly look like Prince Phillip right did, vaccine much them. pretty healthy age imagine efficacy vaccine much higher unvaccinated 50 year old. care. selfishness endangered ppl.  trial wearing masks watching Netflix.

PHE shows AZ twice hospitalisations Pfizer, even fully vaccinated. see how/why calling misleading. Yes, 4 8 respectively vs 100 unvaccinated, _it's still twice_.

Further, studies show infections, therefore potential spread also.

This makes compounding effect subparness - reduces R\_eff less, get growth generation-to-generation virus introduced community _and_ lesser immunity (due greater hesitancy) compounds further.

This means need vaccinate **more** people AZ provide given level community protection, allwhilst negative press results **less** people vaccinated total.

I see way around this, feel Chief Health Officers advising states recommend AZ 60s, ATAGI managing National Immunisation Program idiots here.

They manage _population wide health_.

This _includes effects hesitancy_.

There's unfortunately many times population hear ""died taking vaccine"", ""lawyer requires assistance walk strokes linked vaccine"" even reasonable people start saying ""I'll wait"".

We Australian die covid domestically year know of. see amputations, complications, heartache causes overseas etc - course do. able avoid consequences here, need 70%+++ vaccinated - news 1 death month due ""the vaccine"" *?

It's short-term gain, short-term boost vaccination willing get vaccines, cost long-term reluctance already hesitance. hard public health benefit argument Allocate vaccine brands based blood-clot risk (it's uniform risk), vaccinate many possible quickly possible.

Honestly thought wear bavaria (germany) entire year significantly less infections neighbouring states. WASHINGTON, June 29 (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo Monday said spoken chief executive Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330.TW) (TSMC) asked help getting access COVID-19 vaccines.

Raimondo told Reuters interview ""he asked help regard, spoken high level officials White House. responded definitely want good partner think helping.""

Taiwan said two weeks ago allow officials Taiwan's Foxconn TSMC negotiate behalf COVID-19 vaccines.

Mid-June United States shipped 2.5 million COVID-19 vaccine doses Taiwan, tripling Washington's previous allocation shots island.

TSMC said statement Reuters believed ""getting vaccines Taiwan would help protect communities ensure normal operations.""

Taiwan trying speed arrival millions vaccines order deals rise domestic cases, although infections remain comparatively low.

The request TSMC, world's biggest manufacturer semiconductors contract, coincides global chip shortage slowed production manufacturers around world, including U.S. auto industry forecast crisis hit production 3.9 million vehicles. Raimondo key role resolving crisis U.S. companies.

Although major impact far chip production Taiwan since domestic cases began rising middle May, U.S. auto executives told Reuters privately earlier month concerned COVID-19 Taiwan could impact flow semiconductors U.S. factories.

I referring people refuse vaccine refuse take precautions like wearing mask avoiding social settings. Typically ones say, ""*I'm* healthy see *I* worry,"" regard around them. UK authorities estimate 80 years old fully vaccinated, risk death similar unvaccinated 40-50 year old. probably oldest.

Spreading misinformation weird read article says counting cases reporting details case? South Africa gone 2 week lock due Delta interest country this? UK example 100x many cases yesterday alone UK seeing countries close restrict entries result - low risk environment (unless vaccinated). Even US can't agree allow free travel UK, [I'm repeating another user, source health.gov.au, 

Low risk environment ""infection rate similar first wave COVID-19 Australia"" ""29 infections per 100,000 people 16-week period"". That's actually 64 cases/day, calcs.

For medium risk, similar Victoria's second wave, model assumes 600 cases/day saying age group AZ prevent hospital admissions blood clots...

&lt; 50 years reported highly uncertain due lack data age groups. seemed risky enough pulled Like said, best thing point get vaccinated vaccinated,

If Australia, absolutely. Let clear: I'm talking uniquely Australian perspective.

If endemic are, want vaccinated - literally vaccines list, probably many aren't. better nothing.

But Australia, main issue truly lot supply mRNA coming online coming months. Like, _lot_.

AZ generates negative press. long time doses. _Despite_ limiting age brackets, still landed 14 people ICU due TTS, caused 2 fatalities year.

14 ICU - comparison, Perth 0 hospitalised due covid, 0 deaths 2021. Likely hospitalised hotel quarantine, community. deaths.

Now nothing compared endemic covid. know that, PR situation turned around.

It's terminal. Pushing AZ people increasing general hesitancy. Pushing open borders sooner, due mRNA supply coming online, along long time shots AZ.

It's costs, people hospital/dead, ultimately genuinely - see delta getting control here.

That may foolish us, consider I'm posting home due 4 day snap lockdown 3 cases, far lead 1 case. recent infections isolating since first negative test (second positive) due contact tracing.

The stats effort insane - 1 PCR test per 43 pop outbreak far, 2000 contacts identified, we've gone sold football game (60,000 people) literally zero restrictions mask order zero-spectator game day. monitor waste-water cannot accumulate, there's lot effective sentinel testing (fifo workers, quarantine workers)... may come across arrogance, beat measures, truly fear world.

We really truly agree disagree. try pragmatic, cannot advocate AZ longer situations, _as relate Australia_. hesitancy deaths would cause worth it, hesitancy likely kill far would saved. exactly; that's reaction get vaccine. Imagine gettin' high-viral load covid; potent sub-type it. Say, Delta. Assuming US, yes.

 
But depends from. Russia set new record deaths per day today.  Risk assessment getting COVID vaccine something assessed pretty objectively. 

And risk COVID far far greater metric. 

Choosing scenario inherent risk irrational. 

It’s 50/50 thing. Different levels government agreement get vaccine 

Particularly AZ less free all

There's nothing anyone say prove five years now, good luck. high-level exec, intelligent, work.

My brother works ICU related story doctor (orthopedist) telling patient avoid vaccines might affect healing surgery.  died covid long afterward. Bottom line, matter smart field people in, ignorance worse rampant.

For many reasons, unconvinced eradication disease possible US. wish people would get vaccine I'd love proven wrong. *eradication* primary objective, prevention measures would continued indefinitely. fuck shit. interesting! know this. longer interval- Scotland England? medication side effects issues. us literally following science CDC told us. safe vaccinated remains true. trust vaccines science. anti mask people act like holy grail even vaccinated knowing effective variants

Like others said, want normal interactions see people’s faces. mask covering time. Yup. I'm vaccinated seems like cult bullying elitism coming certain vax groups. sway people. fact, think argue pushes people extreme outlets. That’s point though. Policies make sense Brazil won’t make sense places. way say ""You antivax ****s, fault kids get sick immunocompromised die. we'll blame, we'll curse, feel guilt, shame, weight loss energy, sense smell, time loved ones."" think would actually impact? Smart America vs Dumb America. Alive America vs Dead America. team fam? hate say it, reports delta don’t seem accurate, least US. We’ve hearing much new variants past weeks devastating be, however US cases deaths rapidly DECREASING several months without single noticeable spike ever since vulnerable got vaccinations. Delta might much contagious (not US yet, looking current trends) much less dangerous B.1.525. observation, I’m missing something I’d love hear instead downvoting wrongthink.

Edit: typo Hard enforce vaccination EUA vaccine

Not really. states fired reason except legally protected ones, vaccination status protected class. ""Did abide company-wide health safety mandates"" good reason get fired. Politics one them. can't outright reject Chinese vaccines say ""no we're gonna use them, better ones thanks"". repercussions China portion Chinese-educated voters (mostly elder). Hence half-hearted ""approval"". Remember, Singapore government pay compensations vaccine-induced side effects take Sinovac. course, people welcome take ""WHO approved it"". don’t want go another year life wearing piece cloth face 50+ hours every week. Sadly, good matter many times stories like shared. someone believes effected past 16+ months stories regret, suffering, loss, death one suddenly provide epiphany. They've invested much time energy pride disbelieving facts COVID nothing change minds now. unvaccinated cases among group already low chance death. elderly people comorbidities fully vaccinated high degree time already.

So can't simply compare CFR wave one previous wave use draw conclusions lethality variant. forcefully vaccinate people China there's less hesitancy.   know 3 long haulers fairly severe. Poor lungs, extreme brain fog (one would take dog forget shoes, forget dog, things like that), low energy, ect. 3 bad months, health noticeably better fast vaccine. Still 100%, they're much better off. Tax payers pay rent government decides free housing everyone desirable. isn’t responsibility private owners provide housing. 

Would support allowing people can’t pay rent move spare bedroom detached mother-in-law studio? It’s private residence. not? got fully vaccinated ! it’s worth, would get to. also give kids it’s available them. masks 100% effective delta variant got quicker US? planning gruesome firing range executions? pretty vague reporting. British Columbia (the place article about, many commenters seem noticed cared, lol), summer temperatures usually 30C densely populated areas. get hot days year blistering unusual heat wave, coastal areas large portion population lives, 30+ summer days norm.

Plus don’t wear mask outside. ever required indoors. vast majority unvaccinated cases young people already low risk death Covid already. good example data interpreted incorrectly! think maskless la tourists Irony. Go yell unempathetic essential workers got vaccine bold enough. Also, people different immune system reactions.

Say Jerry stays home two days sniffles. gives one work. Total lost productivity: two days Jerry.

Say Jerry comes sniffles. twenty people get Jerry ok, slower less happy week-- let's call four days' worth productivity total. Sam also gets it, Sam autoimmune condition. Sam take whole week off, fully recover two months (let's call seven days initial time plus another seven less productive). That's eighteen days' worth productivity, instead losing two days front Jerry. 

These numbers pulled thin air, seem plausible me. I'd interested know studies trying out, seeing many people catch single virus one person, etc. continuous lockdowns like UK Europe problem cases? curious cuz don’t live Europe Man, wish option me. Oh I’m saying US doesn’t much larger issue deal here. near-complete breakdown social contract, terrifyingly broad lack confidence public health, face population frankly well-justified belief “system” looking *their* best interests.

Also, don’t thing do. I’m fully vaccinated many others across country. reason wear one unless want right fully vaccinated. people lot people don’t 

A mask isn’t hard thing wear - it’s many people even clean one? would interesting statistic. Another would rather wash hands, exercise healthier, cough elbow wear mask every flu season. shouldn’t feel like wear mask it’s flu season

I’ve seen people (like here) get mad aren’t wearing mask despite safe now. stigma goes way people don’t want wear mask don’t Sometimes consensus, like there's deadly disease spreading. fact, talking about? funny u use saying parties. vaccinated say stupid unvaccinated die off, unvaccinated say stupid vaccinated die vaccines.  inaccurate.

That’s rational human beings think. It’s pathologically obsessed people think. Ok, vaccines different…… vaccine might effective, never 100% - always chance still get infected vaccinated.  Moderna boi - confirm sucked, 10/10 would angry abs frustrated people getting vaccinated, suggesting hang dry die is, think, callous misguided.

For one thing, hospital system gets overloaded lots people die, unvaccinated folks. also keep stressing doctors nurses.

Second, covid could still mutate past immunity. sick people are, reproduces, worse gets.

Third… god man, still people! kids aren’t vaccinating. friend’s sister refusing get vaccine fear lack access, four kids premature births gave respiratory issues. kids could die let get hand! Yeah, there’s lot do, try, turn noses folks say “live let die!” President Trump, you? agree 100%! true. “wearing masks leads infection” many people’s BS antennae went up.

Up group ichthyologists saying didn’t know fish needed water. immune system friend, okay I'm suggesting denying medical care, I'm really annoyed it. like people injure driving drunk. person left die they're hospitalized jackass. want everyone receive treatment care still annoyed decisions lead moment.  yeah one political party made mask wearing political issue cost us hundreds thousands lives. sure obsession. people approach tell wear mask Dr. Fauci paid China create virus jam stupid faces somehow.

I‘m bored. soon vastly inflate medical premiums people like obese.  Let's start picking choosing 'type' irresponsible people want 'punish' here. teens twenty somethings eligible vaccine, already lower risk virus. I’ve literally people tell didn’t want stop wearing mask don’t want people “think Republican”. generally can’t help tell that’s dumbest criteria base mask wearing think of. want keep wearing safety, go ahead, political reasons makes zero sense. Like said, it’s tool, ideology. Delta Variant room right now? said science blame thinning people viewed stupid. Truly amazing people think don’t wear mask vaccinated bad person, Covid super spreader, don’t care Americans anyone. couldn’t truth

The people got vaccinated followed science got shot. listen CDC says it’s okay. mention booster shots might needed months years depending variants kids get vaccinated tools need keep families safe. Right people's decision actions still damage take away things love most.

So someone can't bothered take appropriate precautions (masks, distancing, etc.) they've decided get vaccine want anything them. human nature skeptical. start wearing masks day time. People take feel safe. feel safe yet. dont fuckin blame either shitshow went thru. stopped wearing mask vaccinated months ago, work people even believe hand washing. science behind telling fully vaccinated people wear masks? WAG? Last heard vaccine effective variant. pretty normal vaccinated person get symptoms they're exposed virus. vaccine magically repel virus - teaches body mount proper immune response, still cause symptoms time. England vaccinated people caught Delta variant Pfizer vaccine

That's big lie there, incredible majority cases right UK either partially vaccinated all, cases children teens, explains incredibly low hospitalization / fatality rate right UK Nah, making bad pun J&amp;J. There’s seemingly never info it, including US started using again. found wife, try stay current things. Agreed. putting clarity. It’s stupid divide too. I’ll bet 99% Americans vaccine one refuse get. father almost tears told might forced get vaccine. polio vaccine? bet did. go hospital sick. bet does. They're swinging hard way it. maskless mandate. saying vaccinated, looking science numbers, wear mask anymore. they're taking people listen health authority America saying bad baby killers, anti-vaxxers, covid deniers. don’t understand difference country, region, continent entire globe can’t help man. get it. don’t like way speak. Guess disagree one. us auto-immune diseases conditions mean full vaccination us always protect us much non-elderly healthy folks. places still need wear masks precaution.

I fan playing Russian Roulette myself. I've never gotten indication 60 years life personal luck good. fact, indicators pointed exact opposite direction. Hell yeah, boy Moderna killing it. Yeah got downvoted sub saying wear mask I’m sick future also easy say “Fzck you, got mine!”, it’s never right move.

This also worst characteristic politicians pro-vaccine people hate. need ask bad party oppose it.

There 'so many' story. billions people world personal experiences. dozen cherry picked confirmation bias confirming examples make trend, let alone significant representation. think poster mostly referring mask wearers shaming judging vaccinated don’t want wear mask (I’ve actually several people this). personally annoyance lies, people want keep wearing mask go lives.

They need hurry FUCK Lol I'm glad feel appropriate provide parenting advice criticize projecting based sentences COVID subreddit. Reddit nutshell. Maybe people confused stopped double talk wearing mask fully vaccinated people  See Im full vaxed dont care long vaccinated essentially. biggest concerns are:

1. dont trust people honest vaccinated

2. Im still concerned long covid, personally mind wearing mask indoors grocery stores airports. annoying, extra protection (in way)

3. still feel like learning virus want sprint finish line here. 

4. mutations people getting vaccinated.

5. countries history profit well being, I'll never fully trust say ultimately think everything profit health. think every scientist doctor evil liars getting together give us false information? Absolutely not. Im skeptical whole machine. Though truly believe honest point. get sick terribly wont benefit either doesnt make sense. Im skeptic.

All all, totally understand people like mask mandates, seen, truly cant trust people honest even clean. also kind like getting bs colds shit. also board vaccinated people wearing mask vaccine work effective. Id like little data ts preference point. think I'll feel better get higher vaccination rates, long vaccinated know mostly safe off, feel safe around vaccinated people. safe get fuckin vaccination lol It’s like burning house don’t want rescued don’t like firefighters Working mask awful. wear glasses too, pretty much work glasses off. Sure, I'm asking specific questions. true CDC tracking breakthrough cases anymore, average person know they're happening person's response lack vaccine, immunity, etc., vaccines wear certain point? unknown would call scary.  headline every single new variant since 614g. can't understand cnn pushing since 2020 2021 less deadly year children Europe. literally bring cases near zero continuing measures vaccinations deal spikes areas instead constantly spreading.

Of course I'm expecting since American response half assed ""easy out"" like get vaccinated going path friends US vaccinated still wearing mask public shops, despite funny looks even nasty comments receive people. 

One friend even heard teller shop complaining ""accent"" (he British) asked remove mask could understand foreign accent behind mask! would anyone 'eagerly await' bad news like that? course late. EU, UK, US etc done anything time? It’s like trapped burning house refused rescued don’t like firefighters evidence things suddenly ramp fall? Even people vaccine then. 25 male started chest tightness increased palpitations since got vaccinated. bad couldn’t sleep normally month straight would keep up. 2 months feel like I’m getting back normal though took while. Went cardiologist said heart normal blood levels checked fine. said anxious different good feeling vaccine. feel better couple months. one side effects one talked till Science still same, wearing mask decreases chances catching sickness. denying that. world masks cost nothing?  get single shot Johnson Johnson considered fully vaxxed? astounding evenly divided politically. blows mind states 10+ million people decided couple thousand votes.

That said, least issue like 75% Americans vs another 25% reminds time bought 5ghz wifi router first time gave headaches. Like clockwork, turning 5ghz mode would make go away.

That's anti-vaxers (and anti-electromagnetic radiation people) dangerous. internalize rhetoric whether believe not.

Oh yeah, got couple weeks.

I'm also saying *didn't* actual heart issue, explanations even anxious person. cool. That’s probably fair point. Maybe they’re also trying get people quit without layoffs, there’s lot departments I’m still familiar struggling get stuff done current staffing insane! 

Are serious? Agreed. seems like people still thinking virus droplet spread know spread air indoors. Time distance contact people may less important time spent poorly ventilated space infected person. thing supposed keeping one mask use it. supposed toss everytime get new one there's certain way supposed take wash hands. I'm sure lot people running around one mask went anywhere get another one every time. Yes surely vaccinated would transmit far less? (If experienced breakthrough infection ofc). Yup I've thinking lots lead pipes around too.. vaccines would work. Vaccines made China Russia proven unreliable astrazeneca one effective either. (I work lab, pretty much everyone hopefully believes science/is vaccinated)

AND YET. spouse works lab person vaccinated, complain higher ups lab manager enforcing mask mandate. really think encountered location problem Union concern. next week probably say wear again. lie everyone start people seem forgotten that... Well yes, change fact right now. They're wrong, vaccines cause problems, that's entire picture. benefit/risk decision consider risks sides, often difficult people get ""gut feel"" statistics trust they're dealing right statistical data. wait.. what. sigh. None likely harm COVID is.

They're either less deadly, less contagious, nearly eradicated anyways thanks childhood vaccination programs. missing part figured asymptomatic transmission common. CDC recommended masks established. 10-second interaction causing transmission would mean astronomically high R-naught, likely higher measles. 

Not necessarily.

R0 happens average entire duration case.  circumstances allowing 10-second exposure result transmission may low-probability event might possible limited fraction cases short duration infection both.

Look plots viral shedding time -- there's peak around time become symptomatic, shedding falls off.  5% 10% cases supershedders hours peak viral shedding see happen time time going drag R0 much higher.

This consistent with: ""Just 2% SARS-CoV-2−positive individuals carry 90% virus circulating communities"": use different delivery mechanisms (albeit fairly similar). matter (see Curevac mRNA failure). EVERYONE'S get him!
Yeah!
Crank whining paranoia 11!!! literally helpful comment I’ve ever seen this. studies I’ve asking for, weeks one able give information besides “I’ve heard natural immunity means nothing” Don’t forget partner Osmosis Jones.

Id argue ~15 distinct cultural regions US.

Then, 1.0 instead 0.5 area. None optimal. guess overall point POSSIBLE avoid. But, maybe I'm wrong. THANK YOU. ones shifted here. following guidance entire time. social distancing wearing masks getting vaccines soon could. 

The people shifted ones think people evaluating data give guidance suddenly become idiots May 13 became assholes day. People often say this, case wont get vaccinated mean im vaccinations. im anti-vaccine, im anti-untestedvaccine. reasons may different people stop saying people dont want vaccine want feel control superior, plain dumb. Denmark's makes sense. Vulnerable, health workers, people 50 truncate eventually meet middle. get fully vaccinated worry much it. vaccines effective delta, especially serious illness. fully vaccinated people chose forgo masks assholes don’t care others , wanna kill grandma children, whatever talking point we’re today.

I mean strawman lacking nuance opposite direction. enough vaccines Australia practical. I’m sure really helps though  developing ability produce vaccines domestically last year instead relying countries. Politicians even said sense urgency complete vaccinations worst approach possible. call smart. could really active campaign wear cloth masks retail sales N95/surgical allowed. fact, done that, may reduced pressure healthcare workers (less spread) actually would need many well. 

Our family started wearing cloth masks soon got general idea mechanism transmission. perfect, definitely way better masks all. Yeah - 1 10 chance could still infected, be. slim chance I'm infected, there's almost zero percent chance end severe Covid. Sounds fine me. Life always somewhat risky. Understanding balance living risk important. Evidence for... what, exactly? Evidence children vaccinated? Evidence masks painless way help suppress virus? 

Do write ""source please"" everything like intelligent response for? jesus, I’m sorry, sounds stressful…but you’re vaccinated pretty dang safe least! Australia: *finds example superspreader*

Australian media: *delta variant transmits seconds!*

Such superspreader events known since origins pandemic. [Here's example February 2020 - ""15 events also thing SARS 1 early Day 7: Patient 2, age 61, attended ceremony, goes vegetable market. stops booth next Patient 3, age 56, 15 seconds. Neither wears mask.  honest public right beginning Last looked though, breakthrough cases asymptomatic good thing. argument prioritising younger adults 30s, certain occupations. hah, craziest idea. newspaper-b\*\*s hanging around shopping carts selling social paper. get funding correctly applied mask, photoproof. 

I mean, beggar tells put mask nose get cart, would pull get past produce aisle?

Totally unfeasible, know, fun idea. Last week commented truth well heavily voted sub, pertaining release encouraging fully vaccinated people still wear masks. 

I asked still calling ""trials"" amongst vaccinated population given ""tribulations"" fully vaccinated people. 

Science unchanging, forgotten study indicates COVID transmission less 0.01% fully vaccinated. small number warrants return normal. Already, longer pandemic. small clusters epidemics world wide way far future? Yes, course. COVID Zero policies unrealistic policies harm good. Let's move ppl. Smile. good day :) No. tried talking someone countries ministry health regarding issue? I’m sure one, proof vaccine I’m sure way verifying? exactly it. would take long identify counts new definition frontline worker cause unnecessary delay could vaccinating people lower risk infection, still higher risk serious illness. I'm active duty military. I'm sure told true lying. dangerous take another 2 doses? answer probably depends careful 3rd person trying whether they're also vaccinated not. although vaccinated person great chance getting sick all, possibility could get mild asymptomatic form Covid. 3rd person vaccinated, there's nothing worry about.  Antivaxxers? “everyone” long shot. different different areas, areas people diligent, least South Vancouver East Van, huge uptick mask-wearing mandate made big difference stores there. 

Edit add: Big difference transit mandate. requirement going away looking forward using transit. Gauteng, first province get it, currently double beta peak.

But yea. really ancedotal till get hard data. Dude, thank compiling information getting there. got vaccine dose one mid-April dose two early May people like showing information vaccines, especially mrna ones ended getting. hesitant it, sub time, people life showed like ""hey they've working mrna vaccines while"" ""there's lasting side effects trials people getting vaccinated outside trials now"" might pushed gotten it. Big respect you. left armed teeth guy. It’s don’t masturbarte guns&amp;ammo magazine. happened B117? not, let people travel normally. Especially countries within EU cases 10 second transmission little far-fetched. delta variant 2.5x transmissible Covid classic (because described 60% UK variant, 50% Covid classic), instead expect see transmissions 1/2.5x original time frame 5-15 minues? So, 2-6 minutes?

This encounter could simply contact tracing mismatch. sick person look retroactively contact sick people, necessarily limited KNOWN sick people. may simply closest known contact, necessarily actual transmitting contact (because patients known contact tracers).

The way conclusively prove transmission match via viral sequencing -- done analyzed patients?  sequence 100% cases Australia, put herculean contact tracing effort them.

Each case WA generates 80-120 ""must test quarantine 14 days regardless result"" contacts, 800 ""must test quarantine negative result received"" contacts.

Everything confirmed genomics, isolate contacted individuals, isolate *their* close contacts - get ahead virus.

Each case full CCTV review - times even dipped mixed ethics banking records etc contact relevant individuals.

If say ""seconds"", honestly safer believe seconds. rare occurrence, sure, likely happened. Contact tracing really taken seriously here. think random Covid mutation kinder vaccine it? Actually heard kid work say ""Isn't funny made virus target unvaccinated people?"" unironically. exactly happening. Google Gauteng, South Africa covid. sure point here, see growing rate beta was.  Yes, think huge difference, thought would effective 25% reduction worn properly. read study numbers, take account people wearing masks properly (and 'under nose' types included 'mask worn' category)? Extremely good take. South Africa hard lockdown again.. Delta replaced beta weeks. Hospitals currently full. Many younger people aren’t yet fully vaccinated it’s become available them. Also, although cases high, deaths remaining pretty low vaccine definite impact.and many cases even caught delta variant despite double vaccinated milder case it. Probably, since studied microbiological level, whereas studying population much less concrete data need law large numbers side. seem odds article. transmission reduced 25%, benefit compounds time. Like, say R=1.25 without masks, reducing 25% result R=0.9375, meaning number cases would eventually reduce zero? think delta variant majority 40s 1 jab, could see 100k cases day pretty soon. Americans sub wondering WTF going UK... seems like government stopped caring number cases, instead focusing hospitalizations deaths - still low.  

Personally, think ridiculous, there's negative effects covid spreading like crazy... hey, are, we're due remove restrictions 19 days time. Ad hominem
This argument since unable discuss civilzed manner. Anecdotal means evidenced casual observation. Empirical means experimentation. would anecdotal definition. Unfortunately, I’m teacher mostly unvaccinated area. I’m fully vaccinated, worry surrounded unvaccinated teenagers vaccine weakens time. read article? Weren’t saying like 1/1,000,000 VITT beginning? narrowed specific risk group, risk closer 1/55,000. let’s honest, couldn’t care less side effects. Yes recommendation people questioning. [CDC director: Vaccinated people 'safe' delta variant, need wear LA county vaccinated parts country + lots people already infected winter surges recommendation vaccinated people wear masks weird. Ok, I'm convinced dropped head baby. There's way repeatedly miss point here...

Your first comment suggested matter someone get vaccinated even though available, long die. Since narrow-minded, missed consequences result. includes hospitalisations/comorbidities/long-term effects exist (since deaths), passing vulnerable/unable take vaccine/those awaiting vaccine/those vaccine effective well allowing greater opportunity spread emergence variants.

The whole point vaccines, stage, get rid virus (it's likely stay), protect many people possible above. way maximise number people getting vaccinated, even ones vulnerable since still spread mentioned above, creating opportunity new variants.

At stage still get it, think beyond help tbh. Moderna boi slightly sore arm shot 2 agree you, actually thought thing. We're anti maskers, rather simply believe masks effective 25%.

Probably 25% includes ones properly wearing masks (big air gaps, incorrectly sized masks, masks nose, etc)? ivermectin? hope sarcasm. think good point long hospitalizations deaths stay minimal prob need obsess cases like been. think going ~2k ~20k worth noting though. I'm open sides it.  Obviously standard way calculate R-value? seen relation. example ""last week R-value Germany 1,1, compared 3 February 5 January, harsher measures expected drop 0,9"".

A better way say much transmissible compared older variants. problem world vaccinated, still pandemic. worst case scenario would variant emerges completely evades vaccines. 

So we're woods yet, I'm saying paranoid. need get vaccines many people people beat thing get thing go lives. happen bury heads sand pretend well. need stay vigilant make sure variants put us back square one. Covishield definitely eventually make EU green list, requires SII get butts submit approval application EMA. Govt. India cares much, maybe fund application. Yeah I'm good lmao true. Another thing consider is, could limitation method determining transmission using contact tracing. Yes, see subject person pass known infected individual camera 10 sec, every single infected person tracked times. one KNOWN contact subject person known infected person. Unless sequence virus patients prove lineage (no mention done), kind contact tracing necessarily 100% accurate. could well contact untracked infected person. kinda funny theoretical physicists astrophysicists taken authority chances life......I mean really really awesome understanding um...physics.....but know really anything interesting say chances/complexity life compared say biologist....beyond hey bajillions planets likely chance event happened happened somewhere else. USA can’t go backward masks. People wouldn’t stand it.

And exactly everyone brain said ending mask recommendations early, SURPRISE! right. they're doubling save face. Sounds lot like previous administration. CDC stick recommendation ass, I'm wearing mask thing over. shit, it’s already Usually ok. However ethnic Indians taken vaccines droves around world. 

It politics science \*government allows 4th vaccine 1 year later\* lol  Reap sow. sympathy guy. got you, included hour-long scene visit olive garden. still tracking seasonal illness zeal beyond me. I’m sure would see pattern emerge comparable viruses would happy .1% net worth Yeah, sure possibility. vaccines effective preventing even asymptomatic infection. extremely unlikely, least received mRNA vaccine, would even test positive, much less symptoms.

You're right idea still would get virus body, vaccine, majority time, stops ever symptoms. Also, case someone say it, death age group low, worried long term side effects getting sick. became new parent 1.5 months lockdown. extreamly hard much childcare due ones shutting taking kids all. people judging decisions really nasty them. taxing. first one felt like mild flu, like sore arm+pain joints/bones. Luckily script sedatives sleep it. close track confederate versus union?

:p refreshing see high number people willing get vaccinated. Croatia we're 40ish% already slowing entire insinuation back normal 

It pretty obvious are, indeed, still need bear burden get vaccinated. 

We ""need"", ***will,*** whether want not. Specifically, shape people getting sick dying way would easily I'm saying screw every possible way.

So would mean new status quo, change position.

Yes does. ""we back status quo"" ""we new status quo"" two fundamentally different ton people still get vaccine that. right back square 1

There *some*. Whether *enough* keep us herd immunity certainly established.  Fully vaccinated people appear well protected infections Delta variants, however people one vaccine dose Pfizer Moderna well-protected. smaller number COVID-19 infections identified people fully vaccinated mild illnesses. You’ll ok. Drink lot fluids, take zinc, B12 D. actually brink getting sick beginning month took lot emergenC powered thru it. Good news immune system primed rest year, haha.  Lucky bugger didnt covid mild arm pain shot around point injection thought exaggeration (of number people experienced it)when people said felt I'll afterwrds. Telling comments see common occurrence Sounds good enough Netflix original Nobody said vaccines option. 
But even seatbelts fatal carcrashes. Whats next step then? Accepting death happens accidents? putting sledgehammer-like safetymeasures like helmets, full body armor stuff onto drivers?

No matter many safetymeasures build car, casualty-rate never zero. Thats youre missing. 

Same diseases. 
Unless complety rot disease (which possible since already switched pandemic endemic) always people die it, matter many vaccinated behind masks. Florida, businesses, including cruise lines, requiring proof vaccine odds state law.

This real problem. 

But yeah cruises floating petri dishes long covid came around. easier read link contained tweets. Nolan member NPHET recently advised Irish goverment delay reopening plans due impact Delta variant. I'm expert admittedly good amunt modeling goes head still see makes stark reading. Many countries EU similar levels cases vaccines administered Ireland thought might interest share model. I'd also like hear peoples thoughts models. accurate? still pack people commuter trains like pre covid? Hear fucking hear  dr said recommended 1 Pfizer vaccine booster cdc recommended. see many doctors social media promoting getting themselves. Thanks! Yea. concerns me. I'm put child daycare, smaller classes most, still around unvaccinated individuals state low vaccine uptake. congrats! experienced side effects 1 dose? You’re right, it’s powerful mask lobby. Follow money! /s

Or could evolving, global situation safety measures aren’t static.

They’re literally saying go back life normal, wear f’ing mask crowded, indoor public places. Sorry minor inconvenience! Sure they're pretty low barrier always thought respiratory disease, know else would effective masks (other vaccines physical distancing), since know rarely transmits food.

Even R0 decreases 25%, 'still infected' (infected wearing masks sides party) 75% receive less exposure virus one maskless? research maintain its' title, always felt like telling whole story. Pfizer announced Tuesday moving test vaccine children aged 5 12 years. begin testing vaccine infants young six months next company hopes apply Food Drug Administration September emergency authorization vaccine children ages 5 11.

Hopefully Darwin catch cause much death. early 2020, Kristian Andersen wrote Anthony Fauci possibility engineered coronavirus. research since dispelled suspicions something see lot people taking about.  Seems like every week hear new side effect variant.  taking masks fully vaccinated people, bet another dose delta future.

Truth know else might come vaccine can't fault people waiting. 6 months another side effect reportedly 1/100000 based actual people reporting it.  Many people like myself, feel well take otc move on, told might feel good either shot, likely report mild symptoms assume normal. 

Just saying, everyone vaccinated running around screaming, ""conspiracy!!!"". amount pushing strange, amount paid ads strange, can't ignore that. dont think anyone trying kill it, also slight red flag everyone pushing something, states giving lotteries downplaying every symptom.  regular flu shot (which 50% Americans get). 6 months, pretty naive believe new symptoms complications arise next 6, people want know might deal with. tell want pay without paying more.  I'm getting phone calls recruiters every day offering insane contracts ER ICU work. Fuck that, got cushy pacu job now. Sure $70+/hr would great left ER/ICU reason. hospitals desperate doubt could negotiate pay quite bit take contracts. stress worth care health. love people like rooting covid continue. Sickening. Reading comments comments, get feeling there's combination lower-grade education lack interest taught school makes older generations mindset.

Back then, need know much science, scientific method, even able perform critical thinking really advance. requirements high schoolers, nevermind college students, far higher parents, let alone parents. Listening stories anecdotes ""how life back then,"" need perform well school, they'd find job graduating. Anecdotally, family finds amusement taken schoolwork seriously. case many women back 50s 60s, they'd stay-at-home wife husband worked factory. minds, need to.

But consequences painfully obvious now: think world works. seek synthesize new information. Getting vaccinated personal decision hanging people. choose get vaccinated don’t tell people did, people don’t want hang you. That’s decision. That's great advice, thank you! really actually. Compliance general high, much need tough enforcement. learn follow science.

Im Canada Pfizer first shot told take Moderna shot 2nd one supply issue theyre reserving bulk Pfizer shots teenagers.

I dont think Im worried (well, we're experiment) since active ingredients I’m saying wrong seen this? seen speculation actual study indicate vaccinated individuals don’t spread Covid. Modizer modelling got correct facing peak wave September October. high vaccination rates, bad. think Americans shock pandemic fully yet. Antivaxxers held accountable spreading disease.

Mask still recommended, mandatory.

Here Quebec numbers approximately, still plan ease restrictions, since yesterday green zone, lowest restrictions level still limits private gathering 10, maximum 3 different households. (max 20 outdoor)
Mask still mandatory public space indoor, mandatory private gathering fully vaccinated 2m distance household still mandatory even fully vaccinated.
For elderly care home mask distance still mandatory, even resident visitor fully vaccinated even apply married couple.

There end date those, easing reopening plan. said maybe fall mask required school, may still required workplace regardless vaccination status even new cases stay low. end date state emergency.

So I'm sure worst, government maybe week early situation cases low decreasing government say even 75% 2 doses reached re-opening planned state emergency continue. One travesties whole thing US never even attempted get N95+ masks everyone. 

You need scientific study know bandanas/neck gaiters/etc squat. Seriously, confusion corporate America fucking hilarious. Pay people work less hiring more. People sick overworked underpaid. Yes, mask compliance high Ireland. No, want confront them, that's I'm saying.

It would hard walk away started following slapping trap wearing mask. I'm referring would fit description harasser leave alone. I'm talking guy quick comment walk away from, I'm talking someone who's far crazier. Michigan hospital might get vaccinated October. we're extremely lucky. world waiting another year two get vaccinated. It’s almost like shouldn’t abuse neglect people keep us alive article, I've gleaned others. Basically, still unsure exact level transmission vaccinated, asymptomatic person. Add fact vaccinated elderly vaccinated immunocompromised may less protection Delta, get *public health advice* wear masks.

You ***individual risk*** getting sick may changed Delta variant, ***public health risk*** has. That's really public health measures work. Yes, vaccinated still get infected contagious, even minimal symptoms yourself. Essentially become trojan horse anyone vaccinated, turn anyone else _is_ vaccinated another trojan horse. Since children still unable get vaccinated (as well certain immunocompromised people people conditions), Delta variant contagious, guidance shifting towards, ""Wear mask, even vaccinated, help protect fellow citizens"". Nurses every right leave people high dry risked lives save others part ""others"" left dry supported want need cases better wages.  


Pay nurses better.  
Pay retail hospitality staff better. shit Yeah, state (with high vaccine uptake) 3.5 million residents averaging 35 covid cases per day.  really worry covid anymore - I'm vaccinated odds encountering someone covid setting that's high risk transmission exceptionally low.  

My kids vaccinated yet (not old enough) they're spending summer outdoors day camp town positive covid case nearly month.  worried exposed either, even without masks. 

Vaccines work. worked hospital upstate NY redo immunizations track old records. mind, pretty long process. wondered similar regimen (falsely) assumed records must transferred. NorCal reporting in. Masks 50/50 indoors Sacramento Valley 60/40 (pro mask) Silicon Valley based I've seen. businesses require lots people obliging taking store. personally never stopped idea getting 10 year old cancer survivor sick sit well me. give get. asked civil important question. risk causing lot problems, yes, would definitely higher vaccine.

The potential concern cases vaccine-induced heart inflammation second dose, first. first grants protection already. 

I seen risk breakdown 2nd dose vs COVID. That's much complicated situation. don’t need much experience. 2 years abs Covid too

Also jobs 3 days week. super high paying ones 4 5   Thank you. you. Yes, scares me. We're Austin area honestly even looked unions thing here...? pretty good union NY amazing health benefits ever heard of. Sad give up. career switch might possibility. Yikes. John Hopkins 2 years ago accident, something I'd noticed. ICU blood-oxygen actively dying, whenever called bedpan water applejuice, I'd normally several times nurses ran rushed whatever needed do. felt terrible small handful nurses handle extreme cases. J&amp;J? Never hear anything it’s making think made mistake should’ve got 2 shots  see….they see clear, seem advocating vaccination indeed quick easy. greatly reduces even minor risk, societal benefits, etc.

But wearing mask vaccinated? That's another topic entirely would argue par wearing helmet every time leave house. cases, protecting risk exceedingly minor. one ridiculous one not? I'd refer back previous comment said death damage covid does. Yep . family lives America I’m good. No. would holding responsible comes it. surprised see localized issues. Rural hospitals get quickly overrun surge places worse vaccine uptake. nurses sucking past 15 months seeing travelers come get paid easier job. 

I'm sure great retention.

PAAAAAAAY

WORKERS

MOOOOORE Wow that's...disgusting. Unfortunately think lot us need leave admin gets message better staff. tried give benefit doubt...it's pandemic, unprecedented lifetime, best could like little information available. quickly became apparent even time crisis still concerned bottom line. like said, disheartening across board wonder worry current healthcare system survive. much hope. It’s though … vaccine skepticism complex wide spread thing. Nobody arguing there’s growing number partisan people they’re far ones , they’re loudest.

Original vaccine skeptical hyper progressive “hippy” type people, haven’t gone anywhere . There’s also people hesitant medicine pharmaceutical companies general mention people legitimate concerns drug produced fast

And honestly, we’re dealing vaccine doesn’t even full authorization. demand people inject something like that. full approval happens think we’ll see difference lot people… people may getting tested traveling country Never covid possibly cause heart inflation higher rate vaccine? article say wants, I'm citing figures came peer-reviewed studies. likely article misquoted them.  Beta worst far 75% effective. see would expect one vaccine resistant date. comment pure speculation fear mongering problem. completely understand.  ain’t “hanging” anyway, returned gym office.  point chance getting sick dying COVID young person exceedingly rare. young *and* fully vaccinated person? absurdly rare. Changing daily routine way something absurdly rare bad risk assessment.

It would like wearing helmet every time get car. would likely reduce risk case accident! Could definitely help protect death injury! risk protecting exceedingly minor would, course, absurd.

There plenty precautions could take protect us risks much higher COVID. take precautions everyone draws line somewhere. line people drawn COVID (especially vaccinated people) often absurd. sister, l.p.n...is working community garden. minimum wage. blame Never one, it’s focused respiratory much systemic side effects, maybe? reminds time fractured humerus midnight started reading reviews local emergency rooms. Like matters need medical attention. 15 minutes debating, decided order Uber closest one. America! Totally! It’s science anymore. It’s “feeling safe.” Exactly. dumbest thing. meanwhile they're making sweet 6 figure salary lot us Canadians frustrated too. federal government overly risk averse underestimated importance border controls early on, want face electoral backlash anything goes wrong.

There's reason restrict travel fully vaccinated people, least they're ending quarantine fully vaccinated Canadians others exempt travel ban. Hopefully they'll soon open travel vaccinated folks broadly. None apply 👍 people family, friends, stuff like that. vouch CAN99 masks vitacore makes (available site London Drugs). Made Burnaby ship pretty quick! I'm one people waiting tests long term studies come around. various health issues, various medications worked pharmaceutical R&amp;D, simply would rather take proper precautions trust well group scientists claim developed brand new vaccine thats safe record time ive personally seen already well studied drug take years hit market changed delivery pill dissolvable waffer. probably get eventually.

get _what_ eventually ? vaccine virus ? still pisses irresponsible assholes refused get vaccine chose get one given additional benefit so. Stop rewarding assholes assholes.  Thanks tip! mention implementation EPIC. know many older nurses said hell no, I'm retiring. Person asks question month old 🤨 studies back cloth masks protecting wearer? everyone wears yes helps lot stops someone Covid spreading it. Makes sense average age people military younger general population, military majority male. heart issue seems arise younger men.

Among population group found roughly 1 19,000 showed signs heart inflammation still extremely rare even among cases majority resolved easily quickly. Pfizer said 90%? mishear somewhere?  Might many pretty big inconvenience. Especially working older people can't hear well can't speak loud. repeat every sentence pretty frustrating. 



Your job might might social others. hard can't recognize people since masks covering half face. 


Its little things add up. experience job people. 



Plus lots people like snacking annoying putting snack breaks. 


Masks vaccines awesome amazing act like masks inconvenience lot people. takes piece fabric send spiraling, problems go much deeper.  people going read Reddit change Upvoting I’m happy it’s good people outside sub see people get apocalyptic news seems like sometimes lol Man feel like I'm small camp hates nasal spray vaccines. years ago (I remember for) offered shot nasal spray nurse looked like 3 heads requested shot.  absolutely indicating this. There's way fully vaccinated continue wear mask pretend rational person.

I would *lot* tolerant kind view people also wore helmet everywhere went. least would showing they're exceedingly risk averse people decided risk acceptable level risk life. brings ""You you"" conclusion. Seriously ever pay news get free? know it’s NYTimes, never pay penny read newspaper like Washington Post owed 1 richest people Earth. Reuters coverage: 80% asymptomatic, measured original studies. 88% symptomatic much lower 95% originally reported 91% real world studies.  Meh - saying to, fully vaccinated main thing. Upvote you’re staying unvaccinated COVID! piece fabric. that's remnant pandemic measures everything else basically normal, things good shape. Get yourself. Totally agree. reasonable people sub left fully vaccinated.

It’s mostly echo chamber  Right also adults hate choice. choice fueled fear, ignorance, anger often times still choice. harped adult kids months get finally got basically nothing recommending it. sure made decide to. wife’s brother talking getting go theme park. think lots reasons people skeptical including laziness.  anybody reading scared effects Moderna shot, slightly tired usual 2nd shot. First produced side effects feel needle either time. I'm massive hypochondriac terrified head shots effects almost nothing happened. tired achy 2nd shot went bed early night, woke fine next day. breath, parts Colorado, Virginia, Pennsylvania, pay hospitals cap $26 unless BSN. comment meant say cannot make $25 without Bachelor's, certainly cannot make $90 hour mentioned delta variant? Yeah, seems foolish shortsighted. predict they'll end regretting this. Exactly.   can’t come soon enough! least N99 equivalent masks glorious day… good gig get short term, assuming health insurance somehow. interesting see happens year people try go back hospitals left travel opportunities level off. hospitals take back? lose seniority? within city limits grocery store parking lots always 100% full. Even b4 vaccine would look inside store full boomers. one cares. Ironically, wearing mask gives *more* privacy.    know couple don’t want kids husband works remote wife makes 10,000 month traveling nurse. live RV driving US. stereotypical reddit couple

That sounds like awesome life actually. took long? course do. Please provide scientific study says cloth masks protect wearer. I’ll wait.

Cloth masks help stop spread prevent getting someone around you.

I’m anti-masker. I’m fully vaxxed cloth masks don’t provide much protection wearer. Plenty us younger people pro-vaccination, assure you. isn’t turn yet. want see us get infected too? Unfortunately Mississippi known way contain outbreak sort vaccine could reduce risk. something deal with, guess. /s keep hoping stories change minds people get vaccine, stubborn selfish so. obviously care anyone else themselves.

But time, last year heard stories people refused follow guidelines contracted severe cases COVID. Even firsthand warnings accounts express extreme regret seem change many minds one would hope. Ya see Texts via GP via GP federation here. point, get past this. can’t panic freak every single time rise cases new variant. point also going accept people vaccinated likely going be

The vaccines literally touted end pandemic road normal. we’re told goal post change yet variant people haven’t gotten shot Affordable Healthcare Act local hospitals combined gain negotiating leverage insurance companies staff. shortly thereafter dropped $4 hour incentive bachelors decreased hourly wage front line hospital staff. going go, 3-4 chains whole Phoenix area matter people 'deserve' ignorant, matters help people get vaxxed.  come vaccinated Lol yes


HSD made born HORRIBLE proprioception. know I'm clumsy, like holy shit. spatial awareness kinds screwed proprioception general. worse rate blood clots due AZ That's still trusting science.

Also basic common sense; let's learn bit variant transmisable engaging activity puts face face large groups people small space.

I'm sorry science hurt feelings, there's need live fear. Kind tiring answer everything masks, masks, masks... much transmissible virus it’s assumed masks still work mutation? Maybe still - know do? 

I’m anti Max vaccinated. know vaccines really effective variants main strain. reason vaccinated person wear mask know Canada really well, you? live? wish US's supply!

I wish countries US's supply. Vaccines still really unfairly distributed... That's insane. hope get sick. one situation acknowledges close zero chance unexpected side effects. There's concept side effect occurring 6 months year now, vaccine cleared system within week shot. that's left antibodies.

The side effects already know mRNA vaccines far, far less severe covid. Considering many people already gotten vaccine, possibility something dangerous missed something occurs 1 1,000,000 times less often. category human covid less dangerous that.  Yup. pay American nurse hire overseas nurse, train them, pay substantially less less turn over? According you, denied because:

1. qualify nurse US

2. illegal

3. visa issue

4. countries fucked visa issues

5. Switching visa types issue

6. visa fraud

7. eligible visa applied to

8. messed visa process

9. officer tooth ache

10. lawyer sucks

I can't tell genuinely trying helpful, trying justify pretty fucked immigration system. someone BC, want second dose probably 3 weeks getting it. think month premature. *Work industry bunny daily issues wearing mask ever.* believe China-backed is. Listen dude, really get it. understand good fun, legitimately irrational. life wear masks year so.

Please believe me. acting emotion right now. Seriously, therapy would help lot. can't let anxiety win.

This something call catastrophising, part mental health. blame experiencing bad mental health, well must realize cannot use crutch. sake, please seek professional. Like said before, masks preventing living morph something else. That's insidious mental illness works. Headline: UArizona doctor advises everyone wear face masks due Delta variant

Actual article: ""It’s still great idea get vaccinated, fact, that’s probably best protection have""

Man, they're *really* getting desperate, they? way pandemic ends virus runs hosts. Since social distancing isn’t going happen, way unvaccinated get vaccinated contract COVID ASAP. myself, kids vaccinated, I’m done pandemic. sounds fabulous answer that. country fragile pathetic can’t afford everybody even mildly successful financially comfortable.

Burn down. Allowing uncontrolled spread population lose, lose scenario yes, always case. Vaccines absolutely solution, unless increase global uptake, going ongoing concern. mask science magically changes fits narrative, gotcha

Knowledge evolves, dumbass...  Sorry aunt. family vaccine hesitant, say poisoning body. everyone aunt, really say piece move on. Certification real process required. certified, N95 mask. 

That said, agree principle done better job regulatory perspective rapidly review approve new mask manufacturers meet quality standards. greatly underestimating risk, also discounting risk community large.

So post basically “I’m bad math”. Children cant get vaccinated well immunocompramised ones wearing masks. work Arizona ER travel nurse Oregon asked got breaks, almost laughed department. usually even give us enough staff cover lunch, let alone take break, often 12.5 hours straight. Thank God he’s charge. It’s ok resorted ad hominem hyperbole though

I talking prior comment, one mods deleted can't play nice, one that. sorry, clever seem think are. Really? period Exactly.  point game. I’d say leave well enough alone. time force vaccine anyone medical field. government said so. government needs sit fuck stay personal lives. lose lose either way? Yeah disappointed decided highlight kinda glanced really minimized  would love that. Two people thread confidently asserted exactly reverse. rampant. mean cannot condescending asshole expect people suddenly agree you?

Who knew? curious didn’t go article: 

“For months, Moscow rare European capital restaurants bars remained packed much pandemic” “From reimbursement landscape challenges dwindling patient volumes, many factors lead hospitals shut file bankruptcy. least 47 U.S. closed entered bankruptcy year, financial challenges caused COVID-19 pandemic may force same. 

Lower patient volumes, canceled elective procedures higher expenses tied pandemic created cash crunch hospitals, estimated lose $323 billion year, according report American Hospital Association. total includes $120.5 billion losses AHA predicts hospitals see second half year”

“Findings included annual totals recent years:

28 closures 2015
21 closures 2016
16 closures 2017
23 closures 2018
47 closures 2019”

It’s ok resorted ad hominem hyperbole though. I’m used present facts don’t cater karma farming.  I’ve got friend, basically flunked college, made terrible life choices, slept half college football team (unprotected), gor impregnated couldn’t figure dad say: “I don’t really know vaccine, don’t believe safe, I’m making informed decision put body.” Kids. one 12 get vaccinated yet. also can’t get flu shot. didn’t change behavior I'm this...... I've vaccinated ... see point change behaviors others want believe science. getting vaccine taking risk... mind natural selection... want get .. fine America that's choice live consequences. I'm wishing anything bad anyone silly... really good way worry available free. want take cool... make change stubborn. They’re good put resume you’re still college. Yup. like flu. Ebola. rabies. And, and, and.... Dude, ever since COVID, poop smells like sweet corn 🤦🏻‍♀️ It’s great bot. deleted link CBC article once, saying low-quality/ unreliable source lol Look *Street Epistemology* interested talk *with* people friendly way encourage think believe believe evaluate certainty beliefs.

It's method use talk others religion non-scientific beliefs. 

The key ask questions driven genuine curiosity, free judgement, full respect, spirit exploring people's beliefs greater depth.

Sure temptation ""convert"" people rational thought invariably fails. successful talks may end much someone bit less certain before, interviewer better understanding another's perspective. Sometimes person starts see beliefs may well-founded well-formed thought.

There's sub dedicated yt channels there.  getting fully vaccinated stopped wearing (our community like 80% fully vaccinated) variant, back goes!  go kinds wards, including Covid, hunt computers.

Wasn’t ever even fitted N95 made switch working research I'm liking far. Still get see patients, less hands bedside skills coordinating scheduling things patients clinical trials can't believe there's mindset hour someone's life worse 7 dollars. hour never relived. wonder west failing... Way see it, it’s them.

It’s manipulating benefit us.   It’s mandate since it’s gone. It’s recommendation like washing hands restroom. honestly follow business wants terms masking. can. I. supposed abut facts science

lmfao Every hospital 1 star rating every site  understand hesitancy, went myself. really pushed much sooner vaccines new tech less. serious issues arise like j&amp;j overall seems successful.
 key thing though understand bad virus least capable doing. found people reject covid much worse flu, death toll overinflated symptoms exaggerated. world view riskier bet vaccine covid flu thus vaccines needed. Saw happen old work. Nobody knew tf new VPs did, wanted top line catalog computers too.

They went bankrupt, course I'd add, link literally says ""long-covid"" link people aren’t vaccinated probably March 2020 again, vaccinated people could issues definitely bad unvaccinated people deal MRNA technology development years years. COVID provided monetary impetus push finish line. Thanks India….   We're year international pandemic. might make zoom another couple months. mean fucked, please exaggerate. Yep. guys definitely deserve cookie. feel like I'm looking office meme two identical pics. cant wear mask. Im predizone allergic reaction immunocompramised days im wear mask indoors around people. recommending vaccinated people wear masks least LA County  one maintaining zero covid. goal past vaccination here, know heard correct. Abrupt Termination? Nothing wrong concerned ones saftey . 

Being lowest risk category something bad happening Covid I’m simply going wait awhile deciding want get vaccine . lose nothing think it’s prudent give control group least year two order watch unexpected side effects . Yea completely reasonable, almost country world (till recently) mask mandate TIMES outside house look countries like US lots europe never actually outdoors mandate still good us. funny vaccinated still wear mask protect idiots wont get vaccinated. would get vaccinated theyd protect everyone. vaccinated wear mask isnt much incentive wear mask. covid passport unvaxed would need get vaccinated Nope. comments, may understandably missed, specifically reference people complaining people need wear masks extended period time think reasonable logical? deranged. like complaining wear seatbelt fought hard lose weight. Selfish nonsensical. Lol, kinda word weird, problem. know kind specialist nurse makes good bit, never wanted ask much. 4k pay  sentence grossly misleading, therefore much part problem.

71% protection hospitalisation means 29 hospitalised every 100 unvaccinated, said. Pfizer's 94% means 6. That's ~5x.

With two doses, AZ closes gap 2x. Data/link provided. Next time, like, I'll include 92% v 96% two doses - *which still 2x hospitalisations*.

If also translates infections spread, likely does, AZ would lead far greater Bang! borders opened Pfizer rational policy roll-out based availability blood-clotting risk made.

You ignore rest comment - manage sentiment whole year, see hospitalised, disabled, dead due AZ disease?

Be realistic - could drop surveillance program gag media, could tell medical group must assume high community risk Covid, borders already open, least acknowledge ""it's complicated"", surely.

*Especially* public know better. don’t get didn’t spend resources getting masks protect virus public. would easier please everyone, wearing mask would longer endanger masked. Everyone would able choose risk tolerance. Definitely, American perspective think country seems amazing lol majority state already vaccinated keeping mask mandates unnecessary. ha Hey look it’s story again. freezing Presses call light. actually West Virginia lower governor actively promoting vaccinations--with dog prop gun raffle

Right ""Deliverance"" see guards weekend Dublin I'm guessing. $70 hour? Seriously? Yup spelled ""HIPAA"" wrong. That's HIPAA regulates. Yeah know spend 100k month, get paid 70k get claim 30k quarter couldn’t possibly cause problems. Especially billing running 3-6 months behind anyway nonpayment taking months years show up. 

Hospitals easy targets majority non-profit US. ever want fix healthcare start suppliers. ones 5000-20000x markups. fault…the hospital charges $400 screw paid $360 supplier sold $3 screw $360. 

And yes unlike many people keyboard “experts” right high school seen billing. I’ve seen invoices. I’ve heard complaints seen hours cut Dr rural hospital, took six months even recruit, requires specific expensive equipment got free trip Hawaii, tour steak dinner supplier last job. fact matter this: one incentivized go somewhere demand pay doesn’t cover cost traveling stationed somewhere. you’re either arguing travel nursing shouldn’t exist, make less money nurse (even pay reasons make lower) hospitals pay RN’s *and* travelers. 

its infectious disease admin know pull million year non profit hospital, exactly this. Joke.  thats usually colonials   Exactly, think going really bad. That's first time I've used bot, hopefully works. fuck talking about? India approve vaccine moderna conduct tests yet, every country rules regulations. 

Modi ""not like"" vaccine, he's fuckin stupid. guys comment shitty karma farming subreddit hate boner modi, comment trying seek emotional reaction people insignificant issue. actual evidence cloth masks reduce R value flu? addition flu going extinct past flu season, seen many studies demonstrating masks help. well entire 1st world countries used masks prevent spread cold flu even pandemic.

Isolation certainly helped too, think anyone would argue that. sure needlessly nitpicking, trying claim masks work...? least lived, realized error taking vax, boosted immune system COVID19 getting vax sometime future. Someone info this, Travel nurses right making 4k+ week area place. crazy since hospital boned raises covid, everyone left.

4k week, get offers every week another agency. many fully vaxxed people hospital immunocompromised? RemindMe! 1 month reasons people still going wear masks related covid

The f##k? would wear mask outside sick? Vaccination status random strangers

Hence said FRIENDS antivaxx vaccinated. talk friends covid cause inviting people birthday party I'm inviting people fully vaxxed...I think everyone would same. Workers can't choose

In town half workers company wear masks... yes choose want don't.  winter occur, Copernicus? long term covid patients benefiting getting vaccine they've infected  Pay stop giving CEO bonuses masks protect unvaccinated maybe it’s turn stay home. know painting broad brush children others can’t receive vaccine… I’m done symptoms described regarding sibling aligned “long covid.” reports people symptoms experience resolution symptoms post vaccine. really can't tie link's words together sibling's complaints? we've learned anything locations, masks required two weeks. Variants actually discussed Lastly, necessary emphasize findings based prevailing assortment virus variants community study. known well results hold newer variants concern become prominent. However, prior infection afford protection newer variants concern, little reason suppose currently available vaccines would either. Vaccine breakthrough infections variants indeed reported

Relying natural immunity ""gambling"" relying vaccination induced immunity is. fact, case made vaccine immunity less robust since targets single spike protein, exactly protein that's mutating variants.

Take look [this Viral escape prevalent T-cell epitopes restricted high frequency HLA may particularly problematic vaccine immunity focussed single protein SARS-CoV-2 Spike provides strong argument inclusion multiple viral proteins next generation vaccines highlights urgent need monitoring T-cell escape new SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Variants escaping vaccination immunity, make vaccines robust they're exploring targeting proteins vaccine. something immune system already naturally. You’re getting emotional, stop . 

You can’t live life fear everything, examine risks , weight take action . 

The mortality rate Covid extremely low generally affects old sick , populations would die everyone else anyways . 

I think fear Covid blown proportion. aren’t enough qualified teachers nursing schools. I’m interested see hard core data different states getting rid mask mandates. remember everyone gave Texas shit packing baseball stadium mask requirements… didn’t hear massive spike cases. 

Don’t get wrong, want everyone happy healthy. want see numbers. I’ll look bit. I’ve seen headline earlier. Thanks posting it. I’m assuming going large portion people 1 dose AZ, take look. 

I’m saying tool isn’t fun. It’s not
Something used support statement. 100%. agree age based approach Age 50 prevent deaths, anything past encouraging outbreaks leaving social in-person working cohorts completely unvaccinated. dynamic driving massive surge UK rn Everyone sick it.

Forgive saying ""largely contained."" American perspective country hit time high \~300k January compared \~1,000 South Korea since remained relatively flat \~500-600 day, situation looked ""largely contained"" comparison.  concerning, nothing panic vaccinated. fully, can't vaccinate live people do, lot worse. friends young kids definitely worrying this. That’s honestly issue. Nurses aren’t exactly broke start paying $150k year, it’s almost triple residents earn given average pay licensed doctors around $250k average residence 4.5 years, licensed med school graduates would find earnings time appealing sticking internal medicine. 
 
Doctors also underpaid horrible financial situations. Almost everyone healthcare underpaid increases stress environment. nurses end make lack resources. 
 
The issue (also combined underpaid) aren’t treated well. There’s lot stress, common “you’re nurse” insult, high divorce numbers, fact patients come hospital awful shape poor healthcare general. 
 
A lot doctors retire industry despite high earnings compared countries, it’s like always given house worst possible shape needing restore keep job. 
 
What nurses need better pay **and** better hours **and** patients better healthcare urgent care, adult onset diabetes late discovered Alzheimer’s exception norm. 
 
My wife nurse. Japan US it’s sort similar here. universal healthcare hospitals understaffed nurses treated like shit hospital admins government (not cancelling Olympics even asking nurses volunteer despite nurse doctor unions demanding cancelled). wife quit. told “fuck it, single income, I’d rather home safe **and respected** extra $50-60k year”. wasn’t one. **lot** friends quit nursing. won’t come back. lot graduates changed majors. There’s going huge void medical care next ten years.  last part first paragraph insanely accurate . 

But here’s problem, lot evidence poll based . People mindset question much likely flaunt people lie . Polling days compromised, last two election cycles shown us ..As said, time goes hesitant people kinds get shot threat remains palatable. I’m certainly willing mask protect children. Anti-vaxxers Honk Bobo. So, bullying works? Great - buy ?

Everything see bulk purchase direct manufacturer industrial use. Wear headphones.

Just bought cheap earmuffs Lowe's block even noise maintenance man installing drywall next door. like industry outsourced soon you, person making claims prevalence, show us many vaccinated people experience loss taste Telling ""I also worried less severe also exceedingly rare thing happening!"" great point.

Who quoting here? Last recall, year 2021.Not 2022 get it, funny think scientific terms, people seem forget actual alphabet people daily. Well fair enough calling that. point soon COVID wild Delta variant. That’s call, that’s reading tea leaves common sense *NOT* I'm dead yet (I think) new super power sucks. Yeah it. people country saying getting dirty looks wearing masks outside even mandate lifted respect rules (6 ft that). also talking full outdoors mask mandates, country lifted couple days ago, indoors ones. masked times outside houses, said, people seem developed ""stockolm syndrome"" towards masks acting ""balcony police"" like say here. exact place live still hasnt happened me, theres people saying get looked like criminals mask outdoors, kinda opposite, pariahs dont mask time despite mandate longer here. saying politics trump science? That's...interesting  know specifically numbers also need multiply covid long-term risk odds get virus honest comparison. people vaccinated chances catching covid goes particularly work home social. upvoted first part rant downvoted second part. article doesn’t disprove point. Vaccinated people spreading kind significant rate. man, unpaid internships still exist? point anyone get vaccine pretty much done so.  CDC: 'The risk SARS-CoV-2 infection fully vaccinated people cannot completely eliminated long continued community transmission virus."" 12 cannot get vaccine yet whole warehouses filled unsold N95 masks. lot small US manufacturers jumped opportunity help hospitals, hospital systems buy ""unknown"" companies. mean sure it’s better Japan, Japan also better US. point still stands it’s nowhere close control, people Seoul particular getting tired living restrictions year now.  don’t go n public much that.  strange. standing looking straight you, know person. know cats sometimes. Things kind reverted shapes register all. Peripheral vision blur, things disappeared.

But last long, maybe minutes time. Usually did, I'd stop stand run things fall them. neurological symptoms came waves months, would decrease frequency disappear altogether. next thing would hit. went confusion (brain fog guess), blackouts - really worried - blindness thing, visual migraines like tunnel vision lights, without pain. nuanced, people studied Delta variant wasn’t widespread. It’s difficult go get shot. suggest instead gambling. Well, could anyone even try enforce it. Whether someone vaccinated freedom express falls HIPPA protection.. really think states going lockdown winter midterm elections coming 2022? Really?? study people one dose vaccine, wonder difference would doses oil tax subsidy. Yes. think we've there. friends family die utterly devastating. hospital war zone five days week thought would go get it, worse, bring home wife. past 500 days total fucking nightmare. want kind thing ever happen again. dont think ever thought it. never came guess? Meh. printed money, let fed increase interest rates suck already overheated economy. Small drop bucket compared 2 billion. day spend military LA County mask mandate. an, ""Urging"" LAC. all. explicitly mandate. lived LA County seven years friends still follow news LAC pretty closely. live right King County, Washington State. similar ""urging"" State dropped mask mandate, Health Dept. called a, ""Directive"" again, explicitly mandate. Israel regret anything. re-imposed mask law abundance caution, would personally say mistake. Transmission, hospitalization death Israel low. 7-day average cases Israel dropped steadily, even precipitously, since March. US mask mandate mandates falling different intervals last year, last two months. Every time mask mandate fell, doom predicted someone. doom never came. Feel free. I'm sure possibly come conclusion unless trolling yourself.

I tried engage good faith. explain points wrong short term (as we're seeing here) long term, general principles evolution win out. response insist given examples *literally thread*. needed point viruses talking about. that. Physically can’t hold anyone right make decision. hate anti vaxxers there’s literally nothing do. Lmfao, good luck that. Agreed.

Politics end day peer pressure. Public Health England Public Health Scotland data symptomatic disease infection (including asymptomatic, respectively: 87.9 percent 93, 79 percent (idk prior Alpha.) 

So, still protective symptomatic infections asymptomatic ones. Sorry pandemic lasting years. I'm sure find something else keep occupied.  think matter respect. fully vaccinated refuse wear mask, respect fact others choose still wear those. Remain 6 feet apart waiting lines/reaching things shelves, etc. civilly without potentially endangering others process.

I'm fully vaccinated work healthcare. I'm hyper aware spreads Delta variant every state, makes even cautious. yet wearing mask store public place small thing one unselfish things person right now. always you. Ok, trolling I'm blocking now. better future. much nurse gets paid Al Abama (entry level example)? fucking wish, bar owner country government absolutely anything help us (heck even screwing us even more), pandemic nothing financial nightmare far year half Whole article make sense...

""It’s still great idea get vaccinated, fact, that’s probably best protection have,” Marvasti said. “But outside that, masks useful.” ""

Does vaccination work not?  place. that's around 400 times higher risk myocarditis COVID vaccine, got it. know odds I'd prefer. Powecom KN95s cost around 30 cents each! independently tested filter 97-98% sub micron particles. pitty people significant immune issues told type masks option. need get sugary stuff wards preserve RNs vocal least rational.  Yall need socialised health care. hospital public everything free except elective surgery ambulance rides.

Ambulance $99 whole state though. nice thing getting vaccinated selfish people stop mattering, can't get sick anymore.  words, fucked up, that's okay blaming downstream morons.

Am right life prison?  Sure don’t take account 30+% population already covid. risk becomes negligible vaccinated person. 

Wasn’t risk VITT AstraZeneca vaccine something like disagree. see probably 5-10%, mostly women whatever reason. fully vaccinated since March 95% since day restrictions lifted.  agree people children cannot vaccinated. disease spreads mutate, bigger risk us vaxxed. Nope, happening, I'm even close one. Get shots stop worrying, end story.  Maybe I'm touch particularly understand, seems like still case end pandemic things returning normal. call massive restrictions call continue masking. Maybe understand feel substantially different normalcy. still things could sometimes mask. know ridiculous thought? mean, looks healthier, no? amazing hear! That’s health guideline, hard truth.

Here evidence immunity even 1 week. one, that’s vaccine program, mRNA ones I’m reading right realize bias factual analysis offensive. maybe choose political tribe blend one flavour pointed mentions certain people almost entirely negative ways

Feel free give example. detect bit projection here.   People wanted help help brother feel better.  Look UK vs Russia. 20000 cases daily. UK 20 odd deaths daily vs 600+ Russia. Vaccines work.
Sputnik least good AZ. Russians want get vaccinated. Similarly deep south Oohh poor children, closed able party get properly drunk, unmasked, crowded street, come back home freely spread covid like 1000 innocent teens like done last two weeks /s shared living space Dad covid (prevaccine availability). even gave ride hospital symptoms worst. maximum exposure still didn’t get it.

Excellent acting like there’s strict covid code applies universally understand exact risks guy presents.

There exactly that. look risk terms populations world persons risk vaccine higher risk posed COVID infection.

You also bad math. I'd say 2016. fucked 11/9/16. pandemic would something else. possibly also cases risen recently takes 2 weeks see effect hospitalizations, even longer mortality. Message haha  good resource expand work environments safe non-toxic. questioning you, I'd like hear specific account dealt (in addition frustration traveling nurses already mentioned).

I work healthcare industry, I've heard serious corners cut make staggering amount deaths hospital borne infections surprising *Click arrow share messenger* 

“Hey Auntie Vaxx, saw article Reddit wanted share want stay healthy!”

The people see it, people share it. wow. work ER? department verbatim. Surprised pikachu face ironically, am, 3.0 student able get nursing school. I've worked ER 7 years, 10 years ambulance that. school puts front. experience.. grades. know getting into, know shit knee-deep in, can't even get program. I've worked healthcare several years - tell staff (USUALLY) reasonably compensated per designation, workplace expectations cause extraordinary burnout. Shift work, changing policies, lack support leadership, short staffed become normal. Morale tanks. Toxic attitudes work tank. Patient care declines. mention... heathcare everyone... entitled, rude, violent, racists, murderers, rapists, etc. Staff cope lot. delta travels 10m aerosols. may give immunocompromised people wear it. pretty sad though, denying. legendary 3rd wave? “Labour shortages” everywhere seems.

Yet pay lot more, problem sorts out. indian origin.

So? doesnt makes opinion valid foreigner. realize redditors share articles people, outside platform? medical technologist only. don’t nursing license certification. program similar BSN took 4 years undergraduate education along included 1 year clinical work.

The transition pretty easy. applied plasma company needed MLS MLT certification run lab tests.    Thanks u/PussyStapler, informative. see even locally decisions affect peoples' decisions, mom saying get do. see often, also protecting getting vaccine yourself.

Having said that, cases low right now, day day risk probably pretty low. probably another large wave starting around Thanksgiving obvious reasons, anything likely good enough. 100% guaranteed, course, per article we're commenting on. Kids India getting sick higher rate before.  Anybody know buy number n99s? teach person fall :( ridiculous argument. I'm even wasting time arguing bought amazon msrp week fucking lol.

This 2020 anymore. live Portland BOLD FACE claim hold true delta would still able infect others despite vaccinated. see true. Even reduced transmissibility imagine still possible spread virus around. Given variant contagious previous variants would make sense recommend mask wearing wanted curb virus's spread. However, argue reduction transmissibility masking might offer necessary given reduction transmissibility already offered vaccination. I'm sure calculus would see help. I'm aware of, masking incredibley effective cost efficient method reducing spread virus. I'm expert know best course is. something sheds light matter i'd interested reading it. probably also spread others, prolonging plague, believed FB conspiracies suffer work getting back normal idiots like this. Compassion fatigue real. us healthcare workers burnt trouble treating people offered millions vaccine lottery get vaccinated. Meanwhile world begging access. Fucker earned Nah, part pattern comments coupled pointed mentions certain people almost entirely negative ways paints pretty clear picture actual motives biases. Thanks India...good job. First scam calls delta Honestly moved junior role senior role (not nursing) job 100 times easier. Instead going sleep worrying workload things waking worrying things 365 days year, go sleep way relaxed actually enjoy weekends. get sit meetings, adequate time need significantly less busy work (that super necessary one ever appreciates) pay. actually prefer work junior level never go back work death people get relax day. see easy become dissociated what's going floor.  Vaccines imported short supply compared ones produced locally makes sense weigh later. India made vaccines still best bet comes covering vast population.

Instead they've doubled notion wearing cloth loosely face somehow sufficient. think mostly they're embarrassed say ""yeah never really safe - sorry! *now* definitely use different mask"". Still effective mumps vaccine. I'm good it. don’t know would better. Get jab hand. anti-maskers vast majority live US. We've got 'em Canada like lurk r/Coronavirus downvote lot pro-mask pro-vaccine comments. No, still kind right. observe control group too, thank much self-selecting group. it’s anything like super bowl surge truly screwed /s Lolllll dont like playing games people, dont understand people downvote completely reasonable situation. Young healthy people least research involves waiting bit watch studies come out, that’s needs happen. situation isn’t simple as, “GET VAXX’d COVID OMEGA APPEAR”. Alternate headline : mRNA vaccines reduce risk myocarditis side effects Covid-19 500hrs shadowing? Jesus. can't wire house without journeyman looking shoulder 6000 hrs experience 1600 hrs classroom time. I've heard upwards 30% long haulers see symptoms improve getting vaccinated. I'm anticipating another wave two current new variants. point, surprised damn pandemic still big thing year now. I'd love wrong. People reasons things. child age 1 would susceptible severe infection. judge people continuing wear masks, especially there’s new variants etc? think you’re position decide rational? No, wear masks delta gets crushed. Alas, folks won’t wear masks wash rinse repeat.  waiting government step pay part salaries nurses. Thanks, brother front line worker symptoms tho without kind way telling whose vaccinated whose would never way know exactly person caught it.  enough human minds always logical. let's keep trying bunch different things. Someone check TSH. Russian people’s long standing mistrust government unfounded. understand reluctancy taking Sputnik arm.  Get help  way people acting? Yes. complain social change. still people complaining basic human rights, complaining follow others human rights. really isn’t logical. Vaccines aren’t 100% effective, especially new variants. want true protection, wear mask along getting vaccinated. (I wear thick double filtered masks still breathe perfectly even high heat, honestly get complaints able breathe)

I'm thinking airtight seal. actually really bad filter thick, **all** air going come go unfiltered edges. 
 
You seal mask give density front. Also widely dangerous unvaccinated either. LA 110 unvaccinated 13 vaccinated tested positive delta strand. 2 people 123 hospitalized  point vaccine available won’t punishment unfortunately.

Now Coronavirus carried 100% death rate easily traceable patient zero la HIV/AIDS left untreated, punishment would easier enforce whether fines jail. call earth moving equipment NK.  see anything link indicating vaccinated individuals spreading virus unvaccinated individuals. Definitely, that’s lucky enough get states things got bad last spring. percentage looks dicey lol. guarantee lot higher that. suppose defiant personalities there, nothing done help that. 

But country, Canada, 77% people eligible vaccine vaccinated, expect go higher. 

I think society got talking thing supporting other. proud. No, I'm going cities officials around world going back lockdown recommending using masks again.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 99% people dying, hospitalized unvaccinated. story convinces them. story told last month so. convince them, know will. hopefully family member dying gets it. that's sad need happen. Unfortunately think that's exactly things continue play out. That’s super entry. mom makes 50+ hour happenstance since may short staffed, time half half that!

Medical school way go. Sadly, agree. wear mask everywhere se literally one else western PA. That's main factor I'm it. father dialysis patient. mother also healthiest person. least I' reduce risk possible source infection. Thanks talk way compassionate. need start making maximum salary clauses bailouts Kansas lot rural hospitals closing down. sad dangerous. State legislature want accept free medicaid money expansion hospitals losing much money. fine long data given anyone, never happen. reason Mastercard info would. left travel. Sorry sorry. dictate terms contracts, negotiate pay, negotiate shifts, get travel, housing, insurance paid for. It’s union one. pandemic made cynical I’m least bit sorry leaving last staff job middle pandemic. Right, know redundant safety measures nothing improve health outcomes. all, get car airbags necessary wear seat belt anymore.

/s, obviously. Gotta always check date article, cause there's many story. come. Get shots. either get vaccinated get covid. Cause vaccine hesitancy, covid going away. 

If think can't catch covid, think many times caught cold. easy. fire every admin, including c suite, hire back one one enough. every 7 years. see can't true time? Vaccines effective, masks also provide degree protection? 60k? thought nurses make like 200k US one hard things world knowing control can't control. deal can't control. can't control people.. lives, decisions ambecoming okay least less stress it. 

Again, uncomfortable people vaccinated, tell you. Forcing people vaccinate will, end well.. Harassing people vaccinate end well. tell something, going dig heels it. old 'stick Man' shtick.. Well, sorry feel way, must feel good feel way. understand could certainly send anxiety spiral thought hard. 

If unlikely event bad outcome either scenario (vaccination covid) occurs sort ""damned do, damned don't"" scenario. 

I guess one positive way think it, try spin taking risk brain, literally taking risk help save people greater risk. Would let child walk traffic? Would watch idly old lady shovelled driveway?

You good person, scared. people would minds blown read damn history time time. Look polio turned out. Sure, it’s different virus there’s lot comparisons cool shit learn situation took much longer blow over. Hello fellow Jeffrey 👋🏻 Source? Virus fragments, least popular science narrative, spread coronavirus disease generate false positives. Shhhh don’t discourage , like provoking getting free hate mmmm makes day 😋 . american healthcare system broken, doubt it. things can't carry like eventually collapse rich jet singapore healthcare rest us die EEOC according site: 

“The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) responsible enforcing federal laws make illegal discriminate job applicant employee person's race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, transgender status, sexual orientation), national origin, age (40 older), disability genetic information.”

Vaccine status protected class. largely don’t come picture. gills skills  $10? dollar tree Tylenol? $35. 😆😆   call ""seizing means production""?  would try research less, could suck in. like researching crime something. end feeling like live unsafe neighbourhood reality unlikely murdered cold blood stranger walk night.

I kind guy hitch hikes even travelling another country (obviously Afghanistan something). great way meet people find go. think life better taken risks along way. 

Also, imagine fucking DYING covid, gasping air knowing could prevented this. Oh. My. God. excruciating way go. agree post. value ED colleagues let’s real here. ED docs qualified work ICU, outpatient clinics, inpatient wards. skill set mindset different.  trend hating people want careful? want people research make educated decisions. You’re telling mask problem, diagnosis equipped make. gigantic body scientific literature demonstrating profound psychological effects forced masking you’re completely ignoring. someone may wear mask due governmental edict mean effects go away, telling someone thing causing agony problem isn’t empathetic help, it’s gaslighting…even you’re best intentions.   Warren Buffet's job go around stating obvious? conspiracies answered patiently:  know how, made vaccine. fact think team site got it. regular surgical masks. think enjoy guilting people. Covid eternalism becoming replacement religion you. Pre-schoolers + anyone 12  understanding, employer ask employees HCP, HIPAA then, definitely would rare occurrence. error stating initially checked again. think still protection EEOC though. Everyone believe *are* revealing/sharing vaccine status say things like ""thank concern etc."". delta ends anotehr come another another another... No, stop goalpost moving. said Alpha variant brazil outbreak, nothing evaded vaccines (and evade vaccine didnt mean get infected, vaccines working turning covid mild disease vaccinated individuals, seen lot media preying misbelief vaccines dont get infected all, saying ""vaccines wont work"" people catch it), nothing made countries outdoor mask mandates suddenly enforce it. Im saying delta nothing, lot predatory behavior media (the clicks!), fear mongerers othere ulterior interested people. Media blatant embarassing field day first times ""delta"" name starting get known spamming one might evade vaccines mask everything back square one bait panicked people clicks.

Also effort also getting anti vaxxers get vaccinated (and well speed process countries whcih still ongoing process everyone) think spamming MASKS MASKS MASKS HOLY GRAIL gonna give people incentive get vaccinated gonna ""mask up"" (god hate expression) anyway? Pandemic over, never be: covid stay another seasonal disease, vaccines live NORMAL life despite covid here, live constant panic fear new greek alphabet letters. basically patients pay bills pay make people can’t pay. different conservative’s biggest fear they’ll pay “freeloaders?” we’re already paying people, change efficient national system? think vaccinated people might become asymptomatic carriers virus, transferring unvaccinated lot.

Problem young kids also getting sick India. vaccinated. Think pre-schoolers mind blowing Norway NK separated one country mean, tf would anyone stay nurse online classes turns NP thus full fledged doctor (as far Oregon law concerned)  thats.. not.. okay worry much ""5 years experience"" blah blah blah requirements - ""ideal"" candidate would have, minimum requirement.

job sites ban kind thing. job gets filed someone less experince, fine big $$$ put little badge profile says ""dishonest requirements"" I'm telling suck get it.
I know people suffered lot. too.

I'm saying needs accept move past better future, around it. People try run things trauma fault worse them. make decisions, however. That’s awful. managers must really think nurses stupid. think kind BS sustainable? dunno. hard. So, argumentative, think going get Covid?

It seems little mean spirited hope everyone else take infinitesimally small risk to. 

Think guys signed go fight wars. much asked us.

In country though getting basically exclusively MRNA vaccines, even think worry all. 

I guess take risks every day though. Every time get car drive store. meteorite could take whole city tomorrow. could melanoma. solution really try let get caught worrying small unlikely things. lose quality life along way. Eww Creepy Joe but... awhile get one right ya old fart. combination of:

- mrna vaccines work really well almost always prevent hospitalization death even delta strain

- unvaccinated people getting covid young adults children really low mortality rates Pfizer producing lot, think much stream satisfy existing contracts. think original US orders run July using donations. 500M doses procured donating come starting Sept recall. doesn’t show full picture. much admin cost hospitals deal billing million types insurance plans. baked billing rates. insurance company may profiting 18% it’s inflated rate. Insurance existing adds 20-30% hospital’s overhead factor billable rates. Agreed. whole campaign weird. I’m provax parent, skeptical here.. rightfully so, “science” in.. media government skirting fine line here, major adverse reactions could set entire vaccine program back years skepticism. took one weirdo “scientist” celeb create entire autism scare linked vaccines, cannot imagine potential blowback thing becomes harmful helpful kids. chill let lowest risk group stay unvaccinated?  there’s one lesson I’ve learned life it’s never go first . 

Don’t buy first year new car , don’t volunteer anything, always wait back observe others . 

Think evolutionary trait 🐒  Ah yes, average anti-masker anti-vaxer. Well known abiding lockdown procedures social. 

Fact matter variant already spreading populations higher vaccination percentages us. Remove ratios go sheer numbers unvaccinated people country going find way spread people. 

Even variant issue, can't 90 million+ unvaccinated. 1 million nothing. 10-30 million great also dire situation. third country 300 million people unvaccinated disaster waiting happen. said long time now, unless living remotely wilderness, either get vaccine covid. risk analysis much favorable vaccine virus getting less dangerous. Patience actively vaccinations long gone. NK's border China heavily guarded NK. main purpose prevent defectors crossing China. toured half AZ month ago everyone done masks. explicit lie? remember saying enough evidence recommend masks general public time. determine masks anything, _enough_ outweigh fact people mask properly (rewearing, touching wearing, nose hanging out, increased risky behavior wearing etc.)

That's literally still stance disposable gloves. Healthcare workers using protect COVID, gloves recommended general population people trained follow proper procedure end increasing risk. 😮 …. Meant observe participants must several hundred million . Shame 😔 PA here, way get people put masks back enforced 1) Delta carries increased risk infection and/or adverse health outcomes vaccinated people vs. prior strains

I think inaccurate. seen many claims experts saying Delta likely infect cause symptoms vaccinated people. assurances generally reducing risk hospitalization death, infection. always told start vaccinated people still get _infected_ even original covid. still waiting rigorous studies, blahblahblah, quite obvious point delta causing symptomatic infection often even vaccinated people.

The thing remember infection far analog tend believe. ""got within 20ft someone not"" determines infection. Covid-19 1x, Delta 2x. Amount exposure vaccination multipliers top that. important thing, vaccination, reduce time indoors potential spreaders. I've many ignore still. nothing seems move them. Crappy headline Yes, so? 

I really understand feel uncomfortable. private person. COVID vaccination falls aura ""medical privacy"". Right now, obligated revel COVID vaccine status anyone share someone (my parents), feel need know. even see friends, Zoom chats. 1) aware gym since Sept2020, 2) really wearing mask 3) really kept strict lockdown 2020 anyway. Thanks always posting stats! Sad see always declining. attack. irrational catastrophic thinking.

you know wasnt saying ""attack"" literally right? know like someone saw life better deliberately say ""lets put mask face"". ""attributing mask"", mask problem. know perfectly whats wrong whats good mentally. know anxieties, flaws everything one ""some hidden thing showing up"". acting like somehow planned ""ruin"" ""project"" 

Again read first sentence.I believe someone actually planned mind, im relying people mental health healthy fucking SLIGHTEST.

This bit explained detail original post, long one hidden spoilers. simply can’t anymore cases 7-day average 12k, though. I'm sure 2400 cases variant warrants full masking again, especially 80% cases *aren't* variant. they're like house; can't afford one unless there's socialist revolution may well spend things American, believe socialism. /s yet, despite constant cost cutting measures, savings never passed patient. Patients paying getting worse worse care due cuts made administrators. Even best nurses maintain quality care they’re run ragged. One best childhood friends died opioid overdose. offered help kind words occasion that, surely wish speak more. 

That loss devastating lot people, total waste beautiful life could led. talented smart, lots enjoyable years lost on. 

But also apples oranges, person's refusal socially responsible thing get vaccinated puts young unvaccinated children risk, everyone risk. People need grow pair roll sleeves. waste time say lot word word trick? take word intensions good, please stop bullying young man expressing masks make feel try understand. would never tell “just get over” losing last two years university; sucks heart breaks you. Even lockdown forced move online learning justified, experience would still awful, would never try gaslight thinking wasn’t. It’s gent mask aversion, anyone lost job home due second-order impacts, anyone rough time since last March. legions people like this, many stories reported, simply matter others still vaccinations.  dropped this. lucky open minded least. people I've chatted trap ways, bubbles truth. It’s reason done caring don’t. nursing unions exist California, Washington, Oregon, Hawaii, New York. Outside unions, aren’t union, admin fucking you. organic, free-range way exodus nurses? feel focusing much daily cases ICU death rates. entering paranoid/viscius cycle restrictions never end? 

Covid wipe out, daily cases rise fall forever. stop focusing imposing restrictions infections spikes ever want return normal life? It’s controversial India too. Basically two governmental bodies contradicting other. One advocating usage saying it’s efficient. it’s ultimately decided hospital admit to. Sadly proper studies done. Everything anecdotal too. hope study takes place. Kind hard live still therapies ""hope make through!"" 

Also, implementing mask use ""learning live virus"" may ask? Maybe masks something society get collectively used to. like propaganda? wonder person US. US point anyone fully vaccinated can't vaccinated, dragging feet good reason, antivaxxer. Israel large-ish country like right now. ask pretty much identical experience you’ve described. number coworkers. It’s purely anecdotal though. trying make sense what’s happened me. I’m ready say it’s cause case. Unfortunately there's medicine regret. AstraZeneca mrna?  I'd down.  think comment misunderstood, apologies.

Smallpox around millennia eradicated mid-20th century. novel viruses, vaccination short timeline new development terms pandemic response options. 1918 pandemic, example, resulted renewed attempts develop vaccine Spanish Flu strain (and Influenza general) immediate success. amend previous statement: Vaccines never meaningful **short-term** effect pandemic response Covid-19.

My point disparage vaccines, merely express observation collective behavior pandemic. Would fine considering measures stop-gap death rate level Spanish Flu? even worse? 

And question matters, prioritizing implementation standard procedures pandemic response mitigate effects future novel disease outbreaks unknown mortality rates, risk factors, virulence, methods transmission? said mRNA vaccines, similar risks nearly high. Lol christ. covid 1 shot March Asiago needed microdiscectomy (back surgery) since fighting uphill battle getting inflammation check. 
The first vaccine sent inflammation bomb body literally left wheelchair could get surgery. 
I'm trying like hell get check get 2nd shot. 
The information covid many shots get seems anecdotal best. 

I mask best it. 
I can't afford another backslide recovery I've already missed almost 4 months work. 7 past year covid. 

So why? health issues. I'm hurry spends days screaming pain praying hurt ability heal further. Right, different provinces different rules. know right? thread BC.  doubter, supposedly 2 million homes set evicted. We’re prolonging inevitable know! watching Norwegian show called Occupied years ago one characters going visit Russian border. like, wait what? looked map and, holy crap, Norway borders Russia top. idea. figured Sweden went top. getting downvoted British nationalists correct. Delta Premium Plus comes salted top! could tell more, mom lost taste smell got back vaccine? ask that?

I ask that, got Pfizer vaccine back mid-Jan, second shot early Feb. experienced pretty wild waves palpitations starting sometime around then. would come week so, disappear week, come back week so.

I would two three palpitations minute hours.

I’m convinced vaccine, possible? lol sure guys about, stay home wear mask even restrictions lifted gotta live fact community wanted get haircuts underrated comment.

2. people autoimmune disorders able get COVID vaccine [(cdc don’t know narrative coming from.

3. I’m gonna inconvenience antivaxxers lol. get COVID that’s them. That's right, currently, two mRNA ones, one given Singapore (fully privately) Sinovac. knowingly? Them. It’s similar sense sympathy feel children get hurt something know foolish. can’t blame don’t know better. it’s teenager something foolish it’s bit different, like know maybe one ever taught really don’t want life permanently impacted, use learning opportunity. 

When people grown adults think often east forget everyone background (yes even adults) blind spots. like teenagers, sometimes (no matter much someone tells us) live consequences change behavior.

So much might want say “fuck guy, he’s idiot deserved die that’s came it.” take pause think perhaps never taught accurately way happier learned mistake may share experience others (likely people knows didn’t get vaccine) may change perspective.  infecting others. anybody else’s heart feels weird 2nd dose? It’s 2 weeks since second dose, heart feels weird sometimes (very rarely) feel heart pain. I’m young male early 20s I’m hoping go away soon Considering we're taking vax kicks indeed necessary compare risk vs. reward.  Ho fart Goes show vaccine effective…for now, longer circulates greater chance first strain delta strain mutate possibly become resistant vaccines, putting everyone back line fire.
While right average US, several states increasing cases past weeks. 7-day average 12k back March 2020 enough start lockdowns. vigilant it’s really over. can’t risk slowing celebrating cross finish line. need extra cautious still risk. 

And it’s likely unvaccinated people wear masks they’re singled feeing like they’re picked on. Even mask doesn’t much vaccinated I’d still willing stick keep wearing pandemic actually over.  whole different situation believe need hold people accountable actions fact put others danger. 

It like drinking driving. People right drink, chose drive drunk get accident, held accountable. Looks better. know speculation health recently. Maybe he’s lost weight unhealthy reasons?

You 88% chance falling ill first place 99% chance falling severely ill.

To put perspective, dying covid post vaccination like winning lottery, wrong lottery.  Suppression disease always beneficial, whether prevent unvaccinated contracting disease (especially children) slow rate infection induced mutation. Suppression good objective become spread always means bad outcomes. People US seems incapable appreciating this, measuring everything yardstick avoiding worst possible scenarios (e.g. hospitals overwhelmed). Countries succeeded have, contrast, acted goal outset. seems quite common people downplay covid refuse vaccinations change heart risking imminent death. ask those? They’re not. You’ll three hospital systems choose Austin area. None unionized. news Sure is...  We’re jealous all. hope getting doses moved comments weirdly full people telling us really *wanted* vaccinated already would be. Wish true…  That’s point Texas even worse. Texas didn’t prioritize non-medical essential workers except teachers (and teachers due US Government forcing issue,) Texas relaxed infection control measures “fully reopened” in-person essential workers age 50 became eligible vaccination. in-person essential workers may hard replace seek find employment.

I know one Texas in-person essential workers designated CDC Phase 1B essential worker writing US Air Force. Texas Air Force designation didn’t matter.  This. I’ve worked cardiac cath lab nearly decade; traveled half time. Every hospital I’ve pushes it’s employees wayyy far. multiple 24+ hour shifts I’m practically falling asleep pushing sedation.   argument basically continue practice mitigation measures forever sake others, VAST majority who: a) refuse get shot; b) refuse practice mitigation measures?  like shit beer, either   got jab I’m better. trend awfully common essentially every field employment. there’s money made, it’s almost guaranteed employees wagesalves. Workers deserve good pay, importance CEO’s, along similar top executive positions, must drastically lowered, kept check.

But sure many us still waiting Neither- full deactivated virus based vaccine. fully vaccinated protected forms disease. Especially critical outcomes . Every adult children eligible vaccination. SCIENCE says children young low risk 

In times past , defenseless , useful tool. current reality means compelled protect people won’t protect . 

Preventing hypothetical evolution virus masks . like lockdowns purposes eradicating virus . There’s going people let go.

I'm making comment what's ""worse"" - everything relative I'm sure Leicestershire kids missing mum think vaccine worse disease, whereas anyone lost loved one covid likely think opposite. 

What object asinine comment last time heard someone die serious complications getting vaccine?

... are, fact, deaths complications seem linked vaccine.  simply different view risks.

I would put 'they underdeveloped/undereducated level ability correctly assess risks put perspective' every potentially serious side effect reported, chance suffering significantly lower chance suffering exact side effect contract covid, also significantly lower chance much severe side effect death contract covid. It’s hard explain. Sputnik recognized anywhere. Sputnik forced Russian government. didn’t give shit people last 30 years now, apparently Putin, Sobyanin rest care much. bullshit.

It seem like there's middle ground wearing tin-foil hat block 5G signal wholeheartedly embracing vaccine save-all absolutely zero harm anyone. Personally, find rather frustrating representative kind ""debate"" today's society - there's room nuance. Well, week! 😂 Watch people die banned Reddit. That's great see, thank you. thought around 90%. I'm keen know I'm trying guess UK's final vaccination rate could be. Anything 90% people fully vaccinated would incredible still effective delta, really see benefit getting vaccine new one quickly. Talk doctor deciding whether take second shot not. Many things cause chest pain including anxiety. Holy shit, need sleep. read title first thought was, “Why didn’t tell us sea mammals getting sick, too?” totally agree. Part burnout I’ve experienced busy little hospital work late. Combine staffing issues, it’s getting harder want remain medical field. course it’s really I’ve ever done don’t many options haha. new variant, point getting current vaccine would better wait new version(I’m low risk group)?

Also, around expect non-invective method get vaccine?  Nothing late. cannot fully utilise new technology pandemic, definitely able improve safety labs scientists deal deadly viruses. That’s point exactly. Russians anti-vax; anti Sputnik rightfully, so. I'm frustrated opinion changed affected personally

Specifically there's hundreds stories like one.. FWIW, Australia we're seeing surges hospital demand months restrictions ended, extent WA we're delaying elective surgery cope it.

I expect world similar, ""opening up"" getting things includes people addressing health issues, may got worse last year.

Because hate uncited claims: expect rest world beginning experience what's come - matter nation handled covid, there's bound massive backlog things face.

WA largely ended restrictions June last year, came months later, along increases [hand-foot-and-mouth summer [RSV little different while, suspect. Variants become variants variants on. You’re completely wrong delta variant India already showing increased effectiveness vaccines. mutate endlessly form it’s even population people manage get inside replicate in. you’re basically saying it’s hopeless try ?  Why?

Soldiers/guards DMZ passing back forth would big vector entry still fear mongering change mind stop ""fleeting contact"" thing? extremely rare occurrence documented anecdotal case supposedly CCTV imagery. *not* scientifically proven fact - way, infection fleeting contact likely happened previous strains well. would need new vaccine? currently used great protection delta variant I'd like say Phuket pronounced ""poo-ket"" like ""fuck it"". Vaccinates mitigate damage keep reaching viral load high enough play vital organs like pinata No, possible situation potential plan future events. plans monitor virus, still getting going get daily case number updates.

American media reported mere suggestion truth. Complete misrepresentation said. that's big difference note

It's mandate, public health office LA county limply saying ""we think masks cool""

Stop spreading misinformation. matter hang around. give one idiots could infect kids. keep wearing goddamn mask, huge ask, difficult people? piece cloth. mRNA vaccines constructed obtained? researchers decide sequences go it? based previous Covid antibodies? claim higher efficacy rate original antibodies? factually incorrect. spread misinformation?

Get basic empathy. large chunk sub zero Covid train want accept reality something we're going move live country country places become vaccinated enough make manageable Yes. likely another wave winter affect unvaccinated communities it. Also worry Delta mostly unvaccinated folks. That's exactly I'm thinking. Even though many gotten already goodluck getting people take booster shots wear masks Good luck that! start getting people wonder vaccines effective. said already infected vaccinated get severe. main goal load hospitals tell vaccinated people wear mask. two billion vaccine doses counting, that's pretty good. It’s simple. places world generate new variants go global, regardless many vaccines donate lesser-developed nations.

Yeah, get sunburned, chances already pretty low. exactly said though...:

Walensky told ABC’s “Good Morning America” Wednesday “context making recommendations different us United States” since less 15% world vaccinated.

As recommendation officials Los Angeles County, Walensky said “we still seeing uptick cases areas low vaccination situation, suggesting policies made local level.”  I’m struggling with.

I'm unfortunately completely serious. Hey 2 weeks since delta PLAGUING Israel there's still 1 death?? Whats popping man vaccine sucks fuck right??

Brasil we're still messed ... poster said. Move life. vaccinated issue aren’t threat people. Long-covid likely develop symptoms unlikely vaccine. Myocarditis rare side effect vaccines? Etc. Point being, using scare words kind random order. Correct point, vaccinated nothing worry carry on. yet, still friends. chance reduce even odds getting infected, take it?

Because reduction odds insufficient decently large amount discomfort, confusion, social ambiguity mask wearing. vaccine already incredibly effective preventing infection. It’s even effective preventing hospitalization death (especially age group). There’s far lower hanging fruit people’s lives comes reducing likelihood adverse health event happening, developing regular exercise habits, eating less refined sugar, wearing seatbelt, etc. common human population fucking gross. article spot on…nobody forced get vaccinated rest us shouldn’t suffer protect people either.   masks forever? inverse point, people capable staying home sick without financial burden, mine likely so, reduces number people need stay home (cause sniffles).

CDC director stating reason US stress mask guidance issue statements WORLD opposed US. Vaccinated people US still totally good wearing masks (who would've thought), sauce: There's pretty decent argument decrease age 40 even 35 newer variants hitting people age range harder. makes different scenario terms double vaccinate reduce transmission.

Today though, suddenly way people masks again, despite official recommendation guidance. Maybe noticing coincidence, weird. mean great low vaccinated area taking precaution, go get vaccinated!  I'd look excess deaths, far better picture: waited vaccines studied millions people would dead. say offer hehaws free pillows gun they'll board. wife got Pfizer three days. got much better one(see topic) acky day. 10/10 would again. covid also first shot killed me. can’t remember high fever told get second one many may potentially spread parents/grandparents anyone else vulnerable state leading deaths, least becoming hospitalised?

Sometimes really wonder people play dumb site really brainless this... second dose ok. sleepy chills body aches. Totally worth it! Glad I’m team moderna. produce AZ, issue people want TTS.

Without virus here, *with* news deaths due AZ, hesitancy racks up. way is.

The govt's advisory body telling vast majority wait Pfizer - cannot produce - we're doing.

Wish way, Feds suck procuring vaccines, we're at. hear you. asked Covid 3 times month thought busting balls. understand he/they mocking. mean get cards written on. CLEAR coming something way digital proof. far never asked prove vaccine status, mean nobody asked see vaccine card since got second shot.  guess so. driving nuts want live. literally nothing year.

Haven’t sub while, little bit loop, delta variant, people J&amp;J vaccines still pretty much safe?   test question observes activity antibody-containing serum varying levels dilution find concentration marks boundary ""works"" ""doesn't work""

a 2.1 fold reduction means baseline kept working 10000x dilution, 2.1 fold reduction would mean stops working Delta variant 4800x dilution.

There's direct relationship value vaccine effectiveness. None vaccines remotely dangerous. So, Covid-19 supposed cause severe illness death children - rarely? high numbers children killed Brazil nothing variant, due insufficient health services?

If true variant cause severe illness children, high number deaths can't due insufficient health services asymptomatic mild infections require health services. long get mutation escape vaccine-induced immunity?

Realistically, never. That's fear-mongering.

Might well say *might* new variant affect vaccinated folks worse (and trust me, somewhere deep corners web, anti-vaxxer already drafting stupid theory).

I understand scared. fear unknown powerful one.

But rest assured, viruses mutate prolong time ""alive"" inside host. contagious good virus = extend many hosts. deadly bad virus = host dies infect others. ""delta massively increases incidences superspreaders"" really much better? one example though. big dr YouTubers showing .08% lethality. Could due younger people vaccinated though. Either way - initial statement stands. It’s flu. fear factor needs scale back little trust dive (already is) Really serious variant run us over.  seem like mocking, hard interpret initial post timeline getting sick could been. Less delta - estimates moreso 15% go develop symptoms, Pfizer. customers vaccinated, get infected. Thanks, I've curious I've seen ""high"" ""low"" vax rates referenced lot, numbers. absolutely idea that's downvoted aunt got covid doesn’t believe it’s real. thinks got flu doctors lying her. majority nearly vaccinated US, certainly major cities several states. article based academic article yet peer reviewed. Please keep mind discuss! Thanks! CDC actually single two vaccines? I’m pretty sure recommendation said “fully vaccinated individuals” longer need masks indoors. 

Edit: checked, specifically say guidance applies 3 vaccines US, including 1-shot J&amp;J. I'm fine it, also important people understanding science need wear one eventual point. Denying science still denying science, even overly cautious side things. love updates, Wizmaxman. 

And today’s big ol’ fuck ya. Need big one since imagine going see huge drop next week holiday weekend. Australia know pandemic yet. They'll get it. Everyone gets hospitalized covid guarantee regrets getting vaccinated. Unless completely lost rational thought. hospitalized covid, risk death substantially higher anyone contracts covid. cousin need hospitalized, 104 fever 4 days. said thought going die. people regret vaccinated spent week, two hospital, something's right thought process. probably arguing something expertise around virus still gets body starts killing quickly hopefully even notice still get sick.  bunch still trials based around idea exposing immune system train prevent infection. describing probably beyond vaccine technology. statement evidence-based good public  Gottlieb great Dr. Gandhi. measured without fake sugar coat. I’m extremely glad get airtime albeit rarely others. cool seeing Bo still killing time worth hassle ethical quagmire.   They're different organizations overseeing different mandates. CDC focused US, focused globally. conditions two differ vaccination rates, also type vaccinations per region (outside US).

WHO naturally need conservative need take consideration. like too! I’m indemnifying media, sure there’s reason people might afraid? think any? one? not. Never asked so. second time pretending said that?

Because entire insinuation back normal still need bear burden get vaccinated. I'm saying screw every possible that's gonna change, need accept back status-quo.

Actually would mean new status quo, change position. Darwin sort stupid people, vast majority people future would need forced vaccinations change? already mentioned, many ways either incentivize it, improve communication topic make general public willing accept them, all.

And ton people still get vaccine that. right back square 1 vaccinated, COVID over.

I feel like happens lot. statement true sorta. there's nuance one likes nuance. vaccine end pandemic vaccinated, immunity bubble makes 100% safe. It'll population got vaccinated virus died without many hosts available. thinking hard people need black white rules. I’m sorry, I’m done enforcing masks I’m sure hell checking vaccine records. think ever understand sorts questions types people ask them. Since going poor analogies, reminds turn alcoholic drink someone insists take it. likely wear masks going high risk places hospitals get flu shots. act like taking basic precautions withholding something admitting world insist instant gratification times. telling yourself. guess depends mean ""catching"" virus. 

If neutralizing antibodies (located nose throat) prevent virus replicating clear virus time test. also depends sensitive PCR test is. circulates amongst vaccinated, likely find answer suspect.

It's still likely able beat vaccines, mind. Almost good natural immunity. Oh nobody wants talk that. bad. vaccine definitely stop 'catching virus'. like creates forcefield around - virus still enter body start infecting cells. fully vaccinated body take care quickly developed illness spread on. natural immune response. Yes, that’s saying. Also, isn’t case definitely get infected. It’s body put strong fight *sometimes* lose.

The vaccinated best prize, case. didn’t get infected. bad thing ""anti-mask"" crowd overlaps lot idiots think vaccines 5G ""anti mask"" usually dismissed ""idiot"". seem people time take vaccines respect rules hate masks, like me. really get hostility people this. personally never wear mask need to, rarely get cold/flu. think twice people choosing wear mask airplane anywhere else please, though. - like things anti-maskers scream about, someone else wearing mask literally impact life whatsoever. Regardless vaccination rates, people vaccinated aren’t “immune” COVID.

The vaccinated still get sick, sick, infect others

I don’t know claim guidance safe, unless she’s saying vaccine protects people 100% getting covid all, never message people could allergic whatever carrier fluid is? 

I actually glad mentioned that! explained previous replies subreddits, CDC article discussing recommendations allergies getting COVID-19 vaccine CDC, allergic **Polyethylene Glycol (PEG)** (the active ingredient Pfizer Moderna vaccines) **Polysorbate** (the active ingredient J&amp;J/Janssen vaccines) discuss doctor either get one depending active ingredient allergic to.

It also noted chances allergic PEG, Polysorbate, *extremely* low. low, fact, allergic would probably know now. Let's look data:

**Allergy Polyethylene Glycol (PEG)**: According conducted Journal Allergy Clinical Immunology (JACI), 37 cases individuals allergic PEG last 40 years.

**Allergy Polysorbate:** Dr. Sanjeev Jain (a board-certified allergist, immunologist, CEO Columbia Allergy), said regarding PEG Polysorbate allergies, ""Polysorbate similar chemical polyethylene glycol \[...\] So, good chance somebody allergic polyethylene glycol, they're going allergic polysorbate well"" means allergy Polysorbate virtually rare allergy PEG.

In words, extremely, extremely rare. rare, talking 0.00001% chance even less. Even so, mentioned above, CDC recommendations anyway allergic PEG and/or Polysorbate.

The CDC article also mentions individuals allergies vaccines, stating to, ""ask doctor get COVID-19 vaccine"" chances allergic vaccines (while higher allergy PEG Polysorbate) still extremely low.

**Allergy types vaccines**: According [Canadian Medical Association Journal allergic reaction vaccines, historically, occurs 1 176,000 (0.0006%) vaccinations. put perspective, slightly higher chance struck lightning year (1 170,000) allergic reaction vaccines Either way, CDC still recommends discussing first one's sounds like, immuno-compromised people, getting vaccine means less likely lead creation antibodies

This actually true. mentioned reply thread, sufficient evidence time show immunocompromised persons antibody response was, however, good news recently published Journal American Medical Association (JAMA), found among participants given COVID-19 vaccine undergone organ transplant (and thus, immunocompromised) 1st dose, 15% measurable antibody response, 2nd dose, 47% measurable antibody response. great news.

Obviously, much lower general population, however, protection better protection, would argue getting COVID-19 vaccine immunocompromised persons, CDC recommends, best option, no?

Also pro tip: simple Google search answer questions. Hope helps!  depends specific vaccine… I'm right across river, much like too. going get bad. Yeah really need reevaluate. handles globe CDC handles US. live matters. mean got sick first second dose cold. Everyone wearing masks year, barely interacting people we’re susceptible catching types viruses step back world. Sucks got sick couple times, sounds like bad luck tbh. People berate fit healthy unvaccinated: cool. think answer question complex. understand complex answer, research own. going research CDC may well provide complex answer. 

This way keep slogan simple:

Fully vaccinated safe mask 
Unvaccinated unsafe mask

My understanding even fully vaccinated get infected spread virus new variant (delta). would mask indoors. outdoors, would unvaccinated child masked up. Roman Empire, political parties also owned chariots, everything intertwined. Like two NFL teams, dems gop lol. vaccinated matter unvaccinated wear mask work well. Whats problem guy standing outside way tornado: “Just close eyes you’re scared, big guy.” Really ought compare cases last *rising*, rather peak, due lags involved.

Either way though, tremendously better. science also woefully date flat *wrong* thanks pandemic, we've literally rewrite definition ""airborne illness.""

Oh no, almost like normal life! people insufferable. have, taken US I’m European. proof got CDC card, EU seems consider toilet paper lol cases delta variant no, preventing deaths yes Israel. look fully vaccinated numbers cases delta variant still sure fully vaccination 30, increase stop. claiming reached peak cases decrease tomorrow, defended long wave need bring lockdowns back that's said that's concerning claiming everything good know like past variant can't evade vaccines much transmissible means need vaccinate people cases decrease also yes u right one point tbh actually thought like turkish alarming better concerning change  got hit hard probably little shell shocked . 
Do anti mask crowd ? issue US “side” trying counter one another. 
People record saying wear masks like ‘other people’ good safe feeling? I'm unvaccinated feel great. give covid19 even fleeting thought throughout day. vaccinated scared? Basically says US given trying eliminate virus, Israel yet. wanted get zero cases day would still wearing masks anti-vaxers, hesitancy, fatigue, etc. means impossible US get zero fuck it, waste energy something people do? wife rewatching hand maids tale amazing Portugal UK similar trajectories regarding COVID. Portugal, 2362 cases highest numbers since early February (and couple weeks surely reach January numbers). However, fear greater impact healthcare since lesser rate population vaccinated. Koolaid comes plastic containers. Plastic breaks water. means drinking proverbial koolaid. get virus regardless whether vaccine not, thing changes ability cope amount people give right - mea culpa. think sarcasm fails it’s mostly true  right - assumed access vaccines, necessarily case.

Mea Culpa. solution then?

If going mandate vaccinations, always issue.

It wrong force everyone make large sacrifices refusing force people make comparatively small sacrifice getting shot.

To clear, proposed solution cannot vaccinated (or vaccine might less effective) wear N95s avoid crowded places. 
Parents prudent deciding younger children (e.g. play friends whose parents vaccinated rule kids play with). Primary schools require masks 6 weeks Pfizer vaccine approved children, happen 2-3 months.

That seems fair going get (again, refuse mandate vaccine). took moderna? :) county 75% vaccinated. exactly spreading to? 

I wear around children 11 happens month mean, always get vaccine. lifestyle vax status it’s highly unlikely I’ll ever get it. Damn would test 8 people, perhaps importantly, 1 week second dose?

Antibodies decline time - case South African variant, 6 months second dose Moderna half tested detectable antibodies.

It’s worrisome Moderna releasing results 1 week second dose. oldest vulnerable among us many cases many months last dose. 

Analyzing antibodies people received last dose months ago would seem provide accurate picture regarding expecting. appreciate adding region. live Florida, certainly safe run around indoors strangers without mask. vaccinated, don’t want sniff variants day. Wearing mask easy enough. 

I wouldn’t wear mask reliably high vaccination area. know people simply dont want vaccines several years data back overall safety (longitudinal studies specifically).

They arent anti-vax vaccines excited vaccines coming things (traditional vaccines), mRNA vaccines hesitant about. fact science surrounding covid truly fucked makes even hesitant. jail? Lmao

Where stop? 

Imagine system someone could accuse someone spreading virus know landing jail. Hahahaha

You've tickled morning stop wearing seat belt uncomfortable?   Primarily unvaccinated people. Even spread vaccinated person odds dying sick minimal. logic would never go back situation don’t wear masks. cutoff risk infectious disease acceptable us would say highly effective vaccine available 6 months pretty good time. sister hasn’t able taste anything year, sure ever returning. Except Asian neighbors don’t 24/7 they’re sick aren’t force wear We're see lot stories... Could also anxiety. Hell even individual states responses Covid could considered ""2 americas"". Canada thing. Every time lockdowns mentioned people BC chime saying everything open everything back normal Ontario still basically lockdown. Imagine someone rural america complaining lockdowns hospitals New York overloaded. 


I think main reason general lack empathy hard believe something actively experiencing. Oh FFS. think got one I’d throw someone. would test 8 people, perhaps importantly, 1 week second dose?

Antibodies decline time - case South African variant, 6 months second dose Moderna half tested detectable antibodies.

It’s worrisome Moderna releasing results 1 week second dose. oldest vulnerable among us many cases many months last dose. 

Analyzing antibodies people received last dose months ago would seem provide accurate picture regarding expecting. knew used across globe knew they’d allow entry based vaccination status. allow entry EMA-approved then? Agree get tested... wording intrigued ""the Pfizer"".

You get doses right? One dose enough protect virus. thing sorry. one going unvaccinated people, clearly different scenario

That scenario, unfortunately, since kids vaccinated yet, would need figure level risk I'm willing take sake health. understand figure asking about, totally fine, wished CDC's transparent findings. ""Less likely transmit"" meaningless followed ""how much less likely"". People wash hands often also less likely transmit, bet covid-avoiding strategy. used academia always point contention among researchers. Restrictions work enforce them.

Wilfully unvaccinated individuals shown complete disregard sort restrictions so, unless solution includes criminal penalties social distancing violations putting band-aid bullet-hole. agree comment, ... actually believe Vietnam 80 covid deaths?

What makes doubt them? They've actually handled pandemic really really well. Western developed nation mean can't handle COVID, indeed handled better many Western developed nations. Oh, right, bad. guess could match based strain, no?))) Oh, mean package *four whole chips* inside?

But AMAZING!! /s  I’m pretty sure argument won’t work idiots either think so? also includes ineligible children percentage. passed 70% adults weeks ago. 2 dose; unlike 2-dose vaccines, content different (like AZ J&amp;J, adenovirus-vectored vaccine, uses two different adeovirus strains dose 1 (ad26) dose 2 (ad5) ).

They're also selling single-dose Sputnik Lite dose 1. reports they've trouble making dose 2..  I'm fully vaccinated, need continue wear mask country side world Covid outbreak? US. person fully vaccinated, logical reason continue wearing mask. us incidentally also highest case numbers moment. Portugal Rank hath privilege like 60 different strains Herpes? Sputnik V 2-dose vaccine. However, there's also ""Sputnik Light"", name used first dose Sputnik V. 

Dose 1 dose 2 Sputnik V different (they use different viral vector), choice Sputnik V Sputnik Light simply whether give people second dose supply (like 2-dose vaccines doses same). masks dont protect much unless need wear one. everyone buy n95 Kind rant hate snarky comments people choosing wear mask delta variant going around. CDC director said vaccinated people safe don’t need wear one. might sound crazy choose listen CDC guidelines random Redditors do, thank thats ignorant. 

fire admin staff hospital would go under. fact 5G included comment denotes plausible reasoning statement all. 

And yes I’ve read whole comment still doesn’t hold merit given risk assessments you’ve listed. numbers slowing somewhat. seems people busy going holiday.....

Still, nearly levels vaccine hesitancy countries. public shaming, holding accountable cause. 

If drunk driver involved accident, say thing him, would you? ""piece fabric"" indoor mask mandates stops able things enjoy. want martial arts go clubs again. possible masks. point way it’s going likely everyone going point get Covid. spreads fast unless live alone, you’re around people home friends point, Covid literally never going completely go away, draw line? Surely suggesting wear masks rest lives, right? CDC says need wear mask I'm fully vaccinated, that's good enough me. No, since why/how would study product that's applying authorization EU?

Manufacturer needs submit product review/approval supporting studies/data part application. 

It's like bank mortgage approval someone apply Masks protect wearer much unless N95 masks even wearer would still worry eye protection. protect **somewhat** protective people around you. 

Therefore, enough children immunocompromised people wear masks people around spread virus unmasked. doesn’t advise 12 year olds getting vaccinated won’t say covid spread airborne transmission. Also they’re making recommendations entire world different vaccination rate transmission level us. nothing add... random curiosity:

Have gotten doses one? Two shots seem cement effectiveness vaccine general, maybe side effects follow.

If got J&amp;J, know tell ya. Stop spreading disinformation. Darwin missed one. He’s lucky guy.  I'm anti mask all, fully vaccinated everything right entire time, really unreasonable want normal interactions people without half face covered up. Eh like nastiness permeating vax people.

It's laughably overboard turns people off. Public shaming work anymore. three versions Beta variant, vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies reduced six-to-eight fold compared produced original strain, modest 3.2 2.1 fold reductions seen lineages variant first identified India including Delta*

What supposed information? similar experiment conducted Pfizer vaccine least compare (since know Pfizer actual efficacy numbers 88%)? Otherwise, really know take '3.2 2.1 fold reductions'. throw people know jail.


Don't keep asking questions nonsensically.   us we're moving back soon... oh well.   +1000, antivaxxers adult need put front responsibilities.  Sure good luck video footage? I'd like see it. plenty time figure gotten enough unemployment money. know. want exclude unvaccinated society. Let's fucking goooo agree business decide that. Obviously that’s nowhere post. “good luck” “forced vaccination” options you’re suffering real lack imagination. 

There nothing magic vaccine hesitancy. Look overcome model that, make priority. meantime metaphorically fill sandbags water rising. means restrictions unpopular, well that’s leadership looks like sometimes. manager can’t everyone’s buddy. wear masks they're sick, literally time. really think there's anything wrong wanting wear mask time around people fully vaccinated sick non-pandemic times. I'm human, want interact people normal facial expressions, smiling, frowning, etc.  nurse? Yup, EU countries letting travelers without vaccination covid19 test requirements. That's dumbass No, dude. No. ambassadors travel,

IIRC send foreign delegations away forbidding travel even before. I'm convinced massive outbreak ""grave incident"" might anything even weird PsyOp. Y’all, 60k common. everywhere US major city. don’t work OT, technically taking 50k annually taxes.

Insurance plans, Medicare Medicaid pay someone whose feckless behavior leads fall took time get vaccinated. insurance premiums tax dollars go pay COVID-19 bills someone chose get jab? Yes, liberty skip shot, take financial responsibility.

Totally agree this! I’ll tell three year old Anything everything time say I'm scared go outside COVID? linked study someone asked it. make upset? even basement lol  seeing natural immunity prior strains virus provide strong protection Delta variant,” Jason Bowling, Infectious Disease specialist University Texas Health, said interview San Antonio local news station KSAT12. Referring data coming UK Delta variant replaced Alpha variant, first discovered England, dominant strain “If COVID infection before, appear provide level protection new variants would hope people getting reinfected. mild infections, there’s wide spectrum still severe disease including death,” Dr. Bowling said. Adding “So, again, another message really need get people fully vaccinated see good protection full course vaccines.”

Quickest thing could find Yeah it’s situational individual. assumed safe mRNA vaccine. safe serious infection isn’t “I could asymptomatically give unvaccinated toddler”. Same, it’s mask. never issue worn 20 years working hospital settings. don’t feel right telling kids wear mask I’m wearing one. [Deja   company rules vaccinated employees go without mask, would file complaint HR department. company policy masks mandatory unvaxxed county/state, case.

People fine saying maybe military can't figure out. people would panic military definitely figured stuff alien hard proof. would shatter Earth-centric worldview held people.  covers 150+ countries extremely varying vaccination levels, 40 &lt;2% coverage. approach public health population-level threat. CDC's reach one nation nearly 50% vaccination, offer individualized recommendations. biological societal variables play come decisions recommendations, epidemiologists probably analyzing next several decades. 

Personally really mind wearing mask around unknown public low-vaxxed southern state. vaccinated breakthrough case walking around mask happenstance also bothered mask, I'm relieved fine that, particularly breakthrough case. Cuts one node infection branching tree. nutty antivaxxers actually say vaccinated people ""shedding"" vaccine gets sick, coronavirus. They're literally blaming thing prevents illness illness.  interactions indoors? ask 
It shown virus spread much 2 metres indoor environment aid air conditioning general movement. may interacted seconds could within ""splash zone"" longer period time. 

Clutching manner straws idea virus spread seconds terrifying.  ‘Stupid Americans’ kids coastal vaxxed types. aren’t dying out. I’m relieved reading news. can’t honestly shake eerie feeling we’ll come revisit this. here. Got Moderna yesterday feeling bit tired achy today nothing compared first dose AZ. Friend went ER severed finger, gave FULL STRENGTH ibuprofen told schedule specialist visit. bone protruding finger. stitches even antibiotics.

$5,000  curiosity. everyone still wearing masks? Completely agree. people thread discussing prison time spreading ""medical misinformation"", whole ordeal roller coaster ride medical misinformation official sources. 90% America going move lives, people thread continue hiding basements soaked hand sanitizer That's exactly I'm taking it. would want something like said trump basically created. Scary shit actually want Trumpjab. total doses given also different anymore: 89 per 100 Germany vs 99 per 100 USA (compared 84 &amp; 97 one week ago)

Germany EU (well, it) pretty well You’re expecting far much - new variant researchers pushing data fast can. Evidence transmission 10 seconds extremely important. would irresponsible sit information large enough sample frequency statistics. 

Your criticism valid didn’t claim “typical” - extrapolate beyond data. headline tells variant this. “typical” depends characteristics infected population, always.  ""degree good university"" mean intelligent, means accumulated enough credits graduate.

Oh, lol right back you. let forget rotflmao, too.  Trump excuse wanted first place. taking position disagree affect pre-existing desires, doubts, fears. One us. One us! Less likely extraterrestrials? lots things children adults don't. wear five-point harness car? ride backseat? get pushed stroller long walks? go bed time children?

As mention another comment, five kids ages two up, get it. think lot parents' feelings projected onto children children's actual feelings. user u/cariusQ 2019 2020?  consolation, we're allowed leave country casual travel learn live either - vaccine rollout going snail's pace.

Partly we're low triage list, mostly Feds incompetent corrupt - response entirely run states, govt's actually run country.

Fortunately country beautiful there's lot domestic travel want - look forward visiting Indonesia Europe again, viable so.

There pros/cons everything covid, sadly. There's totally right answers, although relatively unique ones.  Holy moly called Union Confederacy. Yeah, parents fucked whole time would impact urging vaccinated people countries wear masks? They're protected exact way vaccinated people US  title probably awkwardly translated. article: ""Das Land hat sich bei AstraZeneca 5,4 Millionen Impfdosen gesichert und 1,4 Millionen Dosen behalten, etwa für Personen mit einer Unverträglichkeit gegen mRNA-Vakzine."" 
Translation: country secured 5.4 million vaccine doses AstraZeneca wants keep 1.4 million doses, instance people tolerate mRNA vaccines. Nope, found mildly amusing. went outside run, way. nice scrapped outdoors mask mandate Italy Monday. mean and? Someone asked source lmao *This story first world nation got turned upside down* I'd take adjusted regression results raw numbers case. CDC US only, vaccines US problems variants. Ever mRna works, deal fact many vaccines not. Especially Russian Chinese ones. science 

That poster probably meant leopards. demographic much likely catch Covid school around peers fully vaccinated parents. mean literally 2 americas, north south fuck SAID STOP  all. simply cannot societies burden continue help refuse help themselves, especially something small shot.  agree there. I've seen, Australia warned younger men.  liberal. vaccinated. Fauci fucking idiot says things like this, adds fuel fire. He's turned propaganda tool would really hard kiddos understand STILL wear dumb things faces parents don't.

I think might underestimating children. five kids. youngest 2 years old. None problem understanding vaccine available yet still need mask up. I've seen peoples' kids similarly understanding (and fact, insisting keeping masks even situations might needed).

I get idea going ""Team Mask"" solidarity, also think kids able understand better people giving credit for. still focused finding cases determining quarantine stop spread never even work. Quarantining failing nearly every country still trying it, stop bullshit get vaccines arms Australia, that's way ever end. point going bar. mask come unless drink mask.  Wow it’s almost like two separate organizations targeting two separate groups individuals 

Who woulda thunk Delta variant (which soon entirely dominant everywhere) twice transmissible original virus. transmitted within little 5 seconds, e.g. [by walking past someone shopping Pretty much everyone going exposed virus point, think avoid they're deluding themselves. convincing modern society eat better get shape would difficult eliminating covid entirely obviously understand definition ""ad hominem."" Ad hominem used attack person presenting argument rather refuting argument itself. made argument, I'm even TRYING refute anything. twist words attempt present ""straw man fallacy"" (look one up, genius). There's need refute something made head never reasonable scientist ever said expect COVID fatalities hit 0. people going die.

True. unfortunate. 

But goal ""flatten curve"". ""eradicate COVID"". Many people lost sight that, think kind *new normal* means wearing masks vaccinated distant mythical time future. = world...CDC = USA. Yes-this US centric forum hence prediction. rest world strict precautions till vaccination :( ""Tell kids, without saying them""

It's hard get comply rules setting good example. Getting kids wear masks really difficult. Getting wear much easier Please avoid areas anti-vaxxers dominant

Depending live, that's literally everywhere. science also clear fluid situation. friend got Covid he's fully vaxxed months. dumb anti-vaxxers going keep things going also introduce new variants. vaccines offer full protection point, masks come back. LA county already saying wear again. 

Don't let fact hate masks keep forever wearing again. absolutely HATE too...BUT I'd hate getting Covid even more.  something needed said people understand: vaccines work! Hell yeah. careful everyone, urge return normalcy (whatever Fuck considered ""normal"" days) strong. It’s great seeing Mask Moralists’ Last Stand, especially recent CDC guidance. “Trust science*”

That's concern. covid news time, anything promising vaccines kids 12? sounds callous, provided children vaccinated, honestly care happens opted go unvaccinated. 

In Ontario, Canada, pretty clear correlation school openings rising case counts couple weeks later. Yes, kids suffering getting sick, curious likely spreading it. suppose different good bunch us 12+ vaccinated, I'd rather see bunch young kids getting sick. Snip snap, snip snap! resources need really combat obesity include things like ensuring access low calorie healthy foods, providing medical sometimes psychological counseling. Really, poverty one greatest correlated factors related obesity, KNOW people lining solve problem. Eliminating Covid requires two shots arm. lot people sub. They'd watch anti vaxxer die laugh rather wear mask.

Sick, sick people sub, vaccine no. risk serious disease fully vaccinated vanishingly small, period, meets reasonable people's definition safety own. Even wearing mask cuts tiny risk half more, make much difference risk already tiny.

For example, difference 1 100 million risk 2 100 million risk really meaningful, even though one twice dangerous other. cut risk zero, I'd interested, 50% reduction risk significant scale. Wow, imagine comparing small piece cloth pissing yourself. Yeah. Totally sympathize. I'm lucky live city vaccination *and* masking norm, friends places feeling social pressure/judgment others, get eyed days still wearing masks. However, Israel already backtracking indoor-mask policy. clear we're woods yet. one saying go back life like last year, caution still warranted, get whole, vaccinated, COVID over.

Until data long-term effects breakthrough cases, I'm eager catch COVID, even end hospital. sacrifice year half life mess near finish line. understand vaccinated people feel differently, choose comfort levels. judgment still wear mask, especially done part vaccinated, stop.  ""Pokemon Gooooo polls!"" Aversion exert powerful hold behavior. eat spoiled seafood one time, ""following science"" regarding minimizing risk foodborne illness probably stop feeling bit queasy next time presented dish. Gotta give space people figure time, even masks become little security blanket. scant amount sequencing done…. understand that, basically mean exactly same.

You correct made personal attack you, however attack fact quite accurate, given comment response, continues accurate. Nope. I'm ok people dying bad decisions DESPITE majority society trying convince otherwise. vaccine supply outstripped demand, became almost personal choice. said, I'm concerned kids cult-following parents making decisions them. population sectors still trouble accessing vaccine, also need correct that.

Unfortunately preventing obesity cigarette addiction isn’t easy getting vaccinated. Im sure theres parallels nuances said comparison, feel like theres least feint line dividing science CDC also says it’s necessary. There’s always going risk - Covid-19 always going us. much better chance getting Covid flu

If you’re going mask minuscule chance something theoretically happening, what’s point? Science end day tell risk level - I’m fine minuscule risk

Unless hospitals overflowing things like that, reason vaccinated individual wear mask. CDC agrees comment talking headlines, mask vaccine enforcement. whole issue headlines like spread confusion pushing important solution: vaccines. Someone fence vaccine going see like “so still wear mask, vaccine must work new variant, therefore it’s pointless get”.  know got down-voted. sensible precaution people interact with, literally, hundreds people shift. Even vaxxed, could get pass many people mask. Moderna Pfizer basically same, true one likely true one. kids still wear masks. parents keep indoor spaces adults congregate without masks. maintain closed bubble vaccine approved age group. 

Luckily they're able that, they're low risk getting infected, lower risk severe case. Hey want wear mask you. need disclose reasoning. 

That said I’ll point describing isn’t rational thinking. It’s obsession got back Europe tell mask obsession purely American phenomenon.. mask wearing , mask “ideology “ Canada well. ...

You make point praise good food smells taste whenever hear you. like antivax crowd wants convince everyone make bad decesion. absolutely hilarious know might gotten it? travel July 4th holiday sure bring, would suggest non vaccinated people stay fuck home rest us enjoy semblance normalcy. can’t vaccinate kids fall it’s going another devastating year school aged kids.   couple myocarditis anecdotes I've read reddit started something like, ""I got shot afternoon went usual 8 mile run"" Yeah 178 million people recovered, means IFR 0.021 (182/4) (total cases millions/total deaths millions).

If it’s bad enough require masks again, let us work home ‘I could care less’
Well here’s upvote 1% uses expression correctly haha exactly. know lagging indicator (deaths) that’s 0.1% CFR that’s adjusting unvaccinated cases cfr closer 1-1.5% camp vaccination requirement, people attended expectation campers would vaccinated. vaccination requirement, people lied it, legally punishable. Im US, vaccines plentiful, anyone wants one get easily get one, yes original statement still stands, wont masking unless mandated government, dont need im vaccinated, risk getting covid, symptomatically Asympotatically minimal. good advice. speaking larger context outside COVID. I’m saying world see variants, you’ll want blame local unvaccinated...when reality, could come underdeveloped densely populated area. 

We aren’t seeing variants come nations respected covid protocols even slightest. Texas time low cases half population never gave damn masks stopping bar/club/gym habits. wanted say it’s simple. Well, can’t exactly put mask infant whose 6 months old, unless you’re moron course. Also, pretty sure won’t playing tag while.. lol. don’t take crowds, I’m cautious. You’re making lot blind assumptions without evidence. traveling country wearing mask solidarity? actions absolutely nothing situation countries. show people data Argentina people say chip; let's ignore nuts.

The thing there's ""some"" people saying this. There's LOT people saying this.

I got point. I'm pro-government, no. really **hate** Putin gang. passing day convinced Russian people deserve ""ruler"". gullible, stupid time aggressive. easily believe Instagram posts someone word ""doctor"" nickname, easily dismiss research proven facts.

Bottom line - government everything right? all.

But government really problem? Definitely not. Nah, they’re idiots. he’s anti vaccine, he’s gotten plenty even flu one recently, he’s surrounded many people far gone orange wave refuses realize they’re issue. still can’t even recognize fact it’s fault got covid first place properly obeying covid guidelines wouldn’t gotten sick. doesn’t want admit lost taste smell something would fairly preventable he’d cared science believing everything conspiracy ploy actually big concern. kept saying flu didnt matter can’t even taste coffee. pride hell thing.   Oh, I'm interested. recommend documentaries? matter general. lives turned team sport 24 hour news cycle, social media, etc. Pfizer said vaccine basically effective delta vs variants; cases rising “sharply” Israel. They’ve 200-300 day past week so, primarily concentrated among unvaccinated children. mRNA vaccines offer excellent protection infection, rare case someone experiences breakthrough case illness almost always mild. vaccinated healthy virus danger anymore, go back living normally. Please talk GP skipping second dose, decide yourself. bad situation considering minors. They're caught middle parents either let get vaccinated encourage all. told kids expecting get vaccinated feel plenty safe, unless objections ""I want needle arm"", I'm happy consider it. Unfortunately (or fortunately, know which), kids require parent/guardian permission get vaccine. help protect anti vaxers imo... It’s complications. Conservatives views world extreme binary sense. either happens doesn’t. getting vaccine doesn’t completely protect there’s still 0.0001% catch COVID, means COVID happens vaccines. happens without vaccines, what’s point? sick, yes. better solution would make sure employees every level paid sick time. people could actually stay home they’re sick instead spreading it. I'm qualified answer comes sort things always like posing question r/COVID19 daily thread. qualified people kind enough explain things scientific perspective. go check r/MapPorn saw hospitality worker Ireland Twitter talking going back work unvaccinated replies full Americans saying go get it. It'll least another month half get mine!  Sadly people took lightly anti vaccine became lab new variants. come humans quick uptake. person responding literally mentioned health causes something makes people feel like heroes. However, vaccinated go get vaccinated (which something besides sitting feeling smug). antivaxxers get sick regress /s age well Amazing hard objective thinking many people. Unfortunately usually way it. one cares affects them. would dismiss symptoms anxiety even know him? thought replying days ago forgot. say, completely wrong. still hard time accepting spreading fast despite high vaccination rate. Hopefully slows coming days since lot people theirs20s vaccinated.  don’t mind wearing store public, I’m going back wearing 8 hours day work since insist us person. ended mask mandate job last week (and didn’t enforce well effect). it’s bad enough need masks let us work home! Mississippi 2400 new cases per day half year ago 50 deaths per day, one hardest hit states. June 100-150 new cases per day, slight increase last days. 30% vaccinated (36% one dose). 


California (assuming CA syrup loving people north), 45k new cases 550 daily deaths. June 1k new cases 20-30 daily deaths. 50% vaccinated (61% one shot).  


Russia's daily cases increasing, 100% June. New overall records daily deaths.

California great. MS bad either. MS also great compared Russia. dozens comments. Dozens! haha. think easier Germany. comes vaccination, peer pressure matters. Russia, majority people vaccine thus, different Canada, Germany.

That's mild we're talking.   Good thing Netherlands already scrapped mask mandates, barely taking seriously first place...

I believe that, get rid mandate, getting back. Even new mandate fall unlikely followed stubborn people here. problem Ireland uptake high, means young people vaccinated they're main vectors transmission. European countries lower case levels incidentally ones highest also highest uptake. double edged sword, works better long run. people aren’t vaccinated immune short period virus definitely get vaccinated, especially possibility contracting even worse strain. people already contracted covid multiple times. existing vaccines, closest ones Sinopharm/Sinovac inactivated virus vaccines, use technology. get it, friend talking specifically Russians living Russia. obviously different Russians living Germany, Canada, US, countries.  Anti-vaxxers need realise, it’s choice vaccine nothing, vaccine corona.

And far, vaccines meant, people burn relatives funeral pyres parking lot. say thing. Otherwise divide vaccinations mask wearing. agree ignorant people. video great example: However, let's honest; Sputnik recognized anywhere, lead problems entering countries. information negative effects, associated Sputnik (there lot info AZ, Pfizer). 

How blame people? Last year, Putin said beat COVID. Malisheva parrots started talking insignificant COVID is. Millions people watched that, shared FB, Telega, VK... now, 1 year later, apparently, lie COVID dangerous. show people data Argentina people say chip; let's ignore nuts. Many people say want know vaccine manufactured still problems manufacturing process (remember problem factor Ufa?). addition, much shitting western vaccines ""opinions"" published lenta talked publicly Perviy kanal. Now, apparently vaccines good Sputnik best one everyone go take one.

What happens Russia great example terrible government something first thinks little later. sad. Im US can't even pay people take it. I've vaccinated since January state still 38.5% vaccinated.

As someone reddit said, something bad happen vaccine long term, they'd choice try save us anyway since many people already vaccinated. living entire life thus far without covid vaccin without mask, still alive. begs question would rather get covid 19 vaccine rolled bed stretcher two kids watch? think vaccinated people might become asymptomatic carriers virus, transferring unvaccinated lot.

I think problem goes beyond that. take experts fear vaccinated people light active infections, risk variants appear able bypass vaccine immunity might high. virus, immune system environment. England Scotland much wider dosing regimen (12 weeks) 3 weeks used US, suspected increase efficacy.  reminder currently, LA county mask precaution mandate. Even US depends from.

Nurses still leaving stay overworked stretched brutally thin. It’s scary watch end - see safety issues popping every single day morale takes deep dive, activities staff member there’s much help (like, almost nothing). one nurses work with, regular contract, anything wrong, axe always seems fall hardest anyway. It’s genuinely fair super frustrating watch. put number perspective, 150 million people US vaccinated.  always vaccine may work, people whose immune systems far compromised overall we've seen deaths hospitalizations drop pretty much nationwide. areas seeing rise hospitalizations largely vaccination become stagnant large number unprotected people winding ICU. makes feel better, heart arrhythmia even heart issues going in, I'm fine. People really fucked hearts safely gotten vaccines. people fence might.  Social proof compound interest two powerful forces universe.  love people think know exactly Covid works spreads.

I shared living space Dad covid (prevaccine availability). even gave ride hospital symptoms worst. maximum exposure still didn’t get it. Quit acting like there’s strict covid code applies universally understand exact risks guy presents. Wouldn’t assume they’re vaxxed “seemed science-based.”

The biggest problem country lack adequate critical thinking science education. know also causes higher rate myocarditis? Covid. I'll chicken then, please. Russia’s antivaxxer propaganda aimed West made back home back fired. vaccine uptake appallingly low. Stop comparing COVID flu, stop comparing COVID vaccines flu shots. two completley different concepts.

For one, COVID incredibly deadly flu, spread magnitudes faster. Then, vaccines COVID MUCH effective flu. Third, COVID shuts economies, shuts lives, flu significantly milder not. reasons people pushing it, either adequately vaccinate enough people kill COVID kill COVID all.

Vaccines way out. surprise people pushing way out. Nope. Tons people 55, friends mine gf 30 gets 2 days.  I'm ignoring all, mask alone enough disrupt degree obviously healthy begin with. I'm blaming anyone this, come on. fact.

I’d love spend time patients many minutes day. 15 min x 20 patients 5 hours day rounding. 

I obviously don’t know medical history confidently say probably never sick you’ve never physician spend 15 minutes bedside per day. patient stable we’re hurry wait pattern, may see 5 minutes morning depend nurses provide updates throughout day concerns questions. patient critically ill spend much time needed bedside assess stabilize patient. Physicians rely nurses much nurses rely us. Neither replaceable. always subtlety encourage people never go first , exception high risk groups . suggested mother take shot probably won’t 🙄 .

Apparently people who’ve keeping supermarkets stocked whole time don’t count. don’t get it. Everyone’s talking opening economy getting places reopen one seems give fuck staff, hardly vaccinated. Yeah still potentially suffer result flaunting mask requests, same. Thank uninsured prices. Hospitals aren’t making money overcharging fighting stay afloat (in general) upwards 35% patients don’t pay bill insurance. Higher places. 

That doesn’t even factor fixed price procedures like Medicare uses cost get reimbursed. 

Yes, aren’t hurting. pay admin much including bonuses. great coverage areas next uninsured patients. exceptions that. lol place 33% vaccine uptake? shocking. still transmit  think that'd probably great degree getting foot door Electronic Health Records &amp; healthcare software industry. 

Epic Systems big name, love hiring fresh grads diverse backgrounds consulting &amp; implementation services - there's tons there. 

But general, consulting &amp; business analysis able communicate well, problem solve &amp; handle pressure well, specific degree have. might tough land first job, even year experience belt, there's TON demand easy hop around. personally, even small chance, want responsible kid needing get quad-amputation sick simply wearing mask. Hate break virus never going away even wear masks Australia fewer cases. sensible wait Pfizer young + Australia. I'm talking them. I'm talking Julies, Karens, Jims World still think Covid flu. service staff younger people. It’s ridiculous bartender could finish shift drink themselves. makes sense. I’m saying government prioritise younger people need prioritising people working social jobs. brother life guard can’t get vaccinated 20 years old, life guards college students. They’ve stop manning beaches parts Waterford week there’s outbreak amongst lifeguards. None vaccinated they’re early twenties. 

I understand vaccinating elderly people really risk. random healthy 35 year old works home shouldn’t getting vaccine someone who’s job around loads people, serving close. 

It’s like we’re treating younger people like disposable pawns something. wrong you? Man, it’s almost like parent companies besties, sorry hear it’s sort across board even still. actually peaced one point go elsewhere, eye-opener folks think nurses make bank. Nope. Non-union state. 

But bonus program like LATE game extra shifts across board lot nurses still got screwed money. staffing specific, covid itself. still didn’t help reasons like stated. I’m glad didn’t end bringing home- know constant worry.

Of many, many, things enrage day die day physician respond one emergencies…ask I’d gotten n95 refused issue one works primarily emergency department. Fortunately, role, I’m handy person know. left n95. bare MINIMUM accessible. 

Amazon outfitted staff better employer. personally purchased face shield SHOCK page protector stapled foam elastic doesn’t last 18 months.   day-to-day runnings hospital don’t produce profit, it’s elective surgeries bring money. pandemic hit, electives got shut due staffing shortages since COVID area main priority. elective procedures, profitable overhead. Perhaps chose bad examples. 

I believe healthy way live, us, constantly concerned extremely unlikely potential butterfly effect saliva killing stranger miles away, constantly consider potential biohazard, even vaccination. extremely unhealthy damaging, different way. Empathy one thing. Never-ending hypochondria guilt another. 

Maybe need agree disagree here. Children immuno-compromised exactly option vaccinated. first sentence debunked 1 million times course last year. fact anyone would still believe, much less spout it, gross laughably moronic. feel you. We’re supposed 3 patients one nurse end 5 lately necessity     That’s California you.

I watched interview governor New Jersey Phil Murphy. asked concern delta variant. perfect response, aren’t worried, vaccines work. already studies efficacy moderna Pfizer vaccines delta variant proven highly effective. fear mongering go years. hallways patients … moment last week nine patients (four signed for) realized would sit wall forever meds, attention, help, didn’t. always swamped people get hurt die it. I'm finally start path becoming NP threads like make really nervous think problem today ostracize people eventually find other. theyll problem numbers. lots liars anti-Vaxx pretend vaccinated parade around ugly faces grocery stores street corners they're likely unwanted. essentially save stupid people themselves. I’m concluding point....

They’re going old-fashioned way fall.... hope get mild case don’t pass anyone else.  That’s terrible thing say Dear Stonky Kong,

Please make rain.

Sincerely, Apes. grave incident? really joke old Irish people drunks thing. makes total sense feel way, vicious cycle want stop won't, point. take high road proactively stop cycle *because* wrong.

It's like correcting anyone know they're something wrong...you can't expect self-correct (every time). Could potentially unionize? thing medical profession? Pfizer Gang stays winning. feel bad family got shit Chinese vaccine, lot people dying even two doses. Ummm... That's really sadistic comment make. think point money wasn’t worth honestly 100 hour probably takes maybe year working sell house move away giving cushion. people leaving professions general end making shit pot money reducing expenses zero walking away. Suit yourself. Why? Well could got around?

That something US sort out. EU's system open countries join.  complete total lie. apologies, looks like misidentified individual. person seems never actually substantiated claims Singapore; he’s never provided evidence.

There someone else sub says similar things, asked evidence provides online infection tracking tool Singapore. far, yet see anyone back claims Singapore actual evidence.

I suppose could remove comment, since it’s wrong person. sucks seems common cross medical field. good amount /r/iwantout posts medical professionals told degrees experience mean nothing foreign country especially say Europe.

This medical field either. Engineering degrees valid across countries either due countries different licensing examination requirements. poster right. Even risk death higher 40 50 year old, essential workers, NEED risk lives all. stay home. 20 year old essential worker still chance dying, worse that, Covid cause life-long disease hard quantify moment. Essential workers need prioritized oldies. Yep, say personal experience Electronic Health Records &amp; healthcare software general yuuuuuuge industry, lots consultants, side client vendor.

I'm sure veterinary health sort niche wider industry.  Yikes it’s flu Yeah, get now. wording weird. wear mask inside. went bar hopping last week maskless.    thing is, still pretty fucking safe that, even Florida. variants don’t pose much threat This! keep seeing mentality scares kids! kids 12 eligible we’re board can’t say “screw unvaccinated deserve it” medical degree from? many years experience public health? seem bothered losing argument moving goal posts. nice day   Vaccination rates low US though. wouldn’t surprise insurance companies jump this. Higher premiums people refuse get vaccine, cover potentially high medical bills. course are

Hence idea current vaccines shown effective delta variant 😂 Yeah, considering it, I'd say that's behind near 100 percent problems have.  remember first weekend? interesting see fallout politically economically. angle wear mask protect unvaccinated….nah I’m good don’t think anyone knows that, understanding current advice experiencing covid symptoms, regardless vaccination status, self isolate test. 

I know... minor sore throat last week day, isolate test isn’t unusual me. kids, well... maybe I’d think differently? correct information half ADULTS tested positive vaccinated. much larger percentage non-adults (I.e. children, cannot vaccinated yet) tested positive vaccinated. put info together, get somewhere ballpark 75-80% vaccine efficacy.

Edit: Also others said, since significant 
Majority adults Israel vaccinated, makes sense significant portion cases amongst vaccinated. 100% vaccinated 1 case, would 100% cases amongst vaccinated group.  feel like I'm chose mom dad (W.H.O &amp; C.D.C) Source?

Edit: proven there's studies know several lost taste smell November still can't taste smell damn thing.  

One smelled fresh bread January one time, celebrated thought smell coming back, still can't taste anything, smelled anything since. Maybe people look context? decisions living NYC would different in-laws living Tennessee vaccination rates areas 3rd world levels.  really gets me. heard entire time follow science. Well science clear says fully vaccinated don’t need mask that’s I’m gonna do. 

You’re 100% right it’s emotion science. want people feel way honest it. case? Yeah hear that, don’t envy stress. I’m around friends littles, meet outdoors don’t worry masking, since adults vaxxed.

I’m teacher cannot wait kids opportunity vaccinated—it’ll take much stress many people. half 40%, according source. population 80% vaccinated (Israeli adults). Turns run numbers 60% cases coming 20% unvaccinated means vaccine shows 85% effectiveness. eradicated flu. one caused 1918 pandemic still around. adapt it. probably happen Covid-19 too. It’s going go away completely forever. Prior covid, someone bought rental property knew laws place evict people non-payment. risk losing months rent. It’s always way. would someone think government could step force house people years? presume you’re also ok property owners paying things like maintenance pocket? Landlords can’t let roof fall in, legally. can’t even let grass grow long city fine them. 

And let’s clear, it’s almost year half, couple rough months. 

The fair way forward tax payers like you, like me, pay taxes house people don’t home.

The funny thing already that. homeless shelters section 8 housing. people can’t find work, programs expanded tax payer’s expense. mean perfectly reasonable question ask given talking convincing people. seems like answer. seems determined blind trust government. Also lots world vaccinated Sinovax Sputnik like US Moderna Pfizer  probably hung unvaccinated people, likely carrying delta varient. Yikes… drop /s? kids naturally gravitate towards empathy need taught. stopped teaching empathy decades ago. “every person themselves” mindset see today.  hard say vaccine work scale. Perhaps missed news, think Oxford-AstraZeneca Johnson &amp; Johnson reported blood clots clinical trials. However, used scale, saw women childbearing age elevated risk side-effect.

There number articles I've come across people much familiar regarding circulating spike proteins potential consequences. honestly educated enough subject really able discuss detail. me, high-risk individual severe COVID, chose take part Novavax clinical trial. data Phase II trial convinced could safe, effective vaccine. worth, problem sore arm days. take risk this, really regrets. able possibly evade severe disease immunized, though take quite gamble brand-new vaccine. Yes put smaller risk already. still advised masks speaking global level many nations reached even 30% vaccinated yet. Whilst US CDC right advise masks US reached majority number already. seem conflicted actually not. adults really need get dang jabs, like, weeks ago.

Amen that. pisses things getting wonky US...I getting used idea going restaurants again. Ugh. Big Facial Recognition behind this. studies read natural infection plus one shot MRNA brings antibody/efficacy level uninfected double dosed.

Maybe i'm working dated data far re-infection goes quick search shows appears 1% re-infected specific variants.  know p1 mutation enough Manus large part population re-infected getting original strain getting infected p1.  

I would happy wrong this.

As me, understanding similar protection Delta pfizer/pfizer person, AZ followed modera 8 weeks after.. 

if links studies mentioned would interested reading obviously missed would like day.

Thanks reply! talking something completely different ever posted. said doesn’t make sense vaccinated individuals wear masks.

I agree unvaccinated continue mask current guidelines anyway. it’s moot point. doesn’t say think says.

Most people Israel vaccinated, people vaccinated make disproportionately small portion new infections.

Plus aren’t hospitalized, dying.   Wife boat you. Flu shot makes sick almost month due genetic disorder everything else wrong her. said. take Pfizer one made tired 12 hours. vaccine first kind used virus. virus used making research used purposes since 90s. saying get it, vaccine done like one. could safer vaccines taken before. also coming kind pill soon. Maybe could work. Wife still goes anywhere, less anxiety knowing virus less lethal. J&amp;J shot one would take. Nothing like pfizer. Thanks this! I’m gonna find sure! Listen CDC since advice US specific whereas whole world. decently attractive white girl rest post?  seems even delta variant run course yet another infectious variant get unvaccinated stragglers somehow avoided previous variants blind luck. Yes, I’ve relied Dr Gottlieb’s level headed coverage throughout. Probably helps trying explain fairly simple terms business community (most biology degree). No, getting wrong. Russian politicians already found someone else last administration know happened. Okay avoid conversation hand. It’s simple question avoiding.

Thank making point.  downvoted bitching downvotes. fake internet points, get life. corona going game that. Generally living without precautions don’t die. get sick terrible tell everyone else wasn’t worse cold flu. Quite smugly way. confusing? fire support staff hospitals ran nurses doctors happens then? Also fire CEOs pay people health system 40 dollars hour night. Think many people deal insurance hospital system. insane. ""Fat people pay healthcare.""

BLASPHEMY! FAT SHAMING!


""The unvaccinated die burn hell life choices.""

Ok. That’s at. It’s also confusing see people saying “follow science” last year half covid deniers, starting follow science let feelings dictate actions. One friends lives NYC, fully vaxxed, 30, healthy. barely side effects vaccine. Caught delta variant sick w/ symptons. Obviously breakthrough, happens. hospital CDC care, know vaccinated people get long COVID, wear mask little longer. live city 70%+ residents 12 fully vaxxed, 80%+ received first dose. I'd say 75% people still wear masks every day. 

Vaccinations way mess. People get should, barring w/ legitimate health issues. totally get vaccinated people choose wear masks, think CDC's blanket vaccinated, need wear mask indoors completely safe little premature lacking nuance b/c they're trying get vaccine hesistant onboard. L.A. public health already amended stances based new information CDC doubling down, least currently. follow data Israel UK since they're ahead us terms vaccination works wild, w/ relative return normal. now, I'll keep masks. got back   Well that’s awful. Gardaí jurisdiction coronavirus restrictions, general public order restrictions? Within year? That's long ass time You’re missing important context. Check Scott gottlieb’s Twitter details, brief summary half ADULTS tested positive Israel vaccinated, half PEOPLE. correct math puts vaccine 75% efficacy, line 80% suggested. Plus, adults asymptomatic (which points Uk study found Pfizer 88% symptomatic covid). never said shouldn't. know came initial comment still. virus transmit water particles. Bandanas neck gaiters stop least 70% water particles. help, also stop spreading it. environment consistent infected patients, like hospital, it’s enough. Hospital clinic workers definitely need best mask get, us regular folks, bandanas enough.  frustrating part, one clue thing....they get vaccinated rail vaccinations. part sane? None. Oh no! anyway... Nothing like good shunning. healthcare retirement controlled. Meaning company self insure see claims get rid you. new age discrimination older people need medical care. Also usually contributions HSAs/401ks etc tax write offs businesses. agree benefit costs still incurred right? 

The thing one points Trump Tax cuts someone 1099 C2C claim pass income 20 percent tax break. course, abandon leadership. Gee, wonder could ... Misinformation. I'd say increased dementia risk makes pretty serious disease, honest North South already exist, mate.  Changing opinion based changing data bug feature scientific studies.  None. That's thing. guards taken power head cases. Plenty masks fog glasses fit properly.

3m 8210 N95's me. started putting surgical top help protect N95, got minor glasses fogging occasionally. Wore combo year. autoimmune disease missing organs. definitely worried getting vaccine, made sense. felt crappy day first jab absolutely terrible 5 days second (though day little better).

If body reacted badly vaccine, imagine would reacted gotten covid. I'm still careful AF know body immune covid typical person.

One siblings got covid job still issues digestive tract good 8 months later. already missing part digestive tract really want hurt parts left.

From understand, people get covid develop POTS. know means could make worse, I'd personally worry that. kids too. know chances dying Covid low. practically nominal you’re vaccinated thereby unlikely pass them. 

I’m concerned getting car accident point catching Covid giving them. doesn’t mean I’m taking grocery store maskless, I’m super concerned maskless go shopping. Good question Butthole—pleasures. don’t think I’ve seen anything anecdotal stuff. I’d like know too. Probably going study anytime soon. true. symptoms different officials think least severe moreso said “almost entirely” stand it. There’s strong evidence supporting claim it’s easy find. People refusing primarily see shot admitting COVID real dangerous goes entire political narrative. 

When ever say people forced? think better, friends opted out. still spend time don’t think all. me, hombre. gooood! Hell no, pay frozen summer 2020. think many people unvaccinated vaccine hesitancy also keep mind western world seems pretty much us not, india variety poor countries can't get vaccine combining poor infastructor, health problems, ect lead mutations we're seeing delta virus. I'm guessing bad translation. means brought earth moving equipment dig graves. would rather lockdown five months winter hits lots variants running about? gave zero accommodations. appropriate accommodations different class(es) specific units.

I understand point comment. nothing reason comment post. 

You made claim generations getting consolation prizes everything handed them.

What's point? looks like fucking idiot happening usps, factories, fast food restaurants, cvs, Walmart..there jobs people willing them. Every place understaffed. 

CEOs willing sacrifice high incomes hire people increase pay staff across board. 

How's situation played historically? It’s almost things change virus changes, find many skipping vaccine knowledge changes. sure, new info propaganda Big Virus industry.   Chargemaster Exactly. sacrifice lot travel pointed - form pay. god expression. mean vaccines benefits vastly outweight everything else. doubt best protect children. doubt family article too. everyone line. absolute safest thing children would never put car allow play baseball. is, course, absurd drawn line allowing activities degree risk safety precautions minimize risk. makes sense good parenting risk assessment!

I could surely find article kid died car accident despite car seat experienced brain damage baseball game despite helmet. agree using proof activities safe saying ""Say safe families!"" reasonable thing do?

Also, brain injuries come anything. Kids clumsy, fall. kid wear helmet he's park? Jungle gyms could easily lead grave injury. data seems show almost 20x amount brain injury deaths COVID deaths! That's staggering! 

And that's 2020 vaccines virus running rampant across America. peak infections/deaths.

I expect convince you. That's Internet discourse works that's okay. hope consider concept risk assessment little deeply ask ""Why made kids wear mask flu seasons? wear helmet playing tag friends?""

When considering *actual* risk, sure possible justify one other. Yup cheap/available enough warrant that. even hire travel nurses? understand short term long term. Gig work medical field. children, that’s don’t travel. People always saying “you still get spread covid vaccine” nothing back up. Im pretty sure everyone saying pushing away people getting vaccinated thinking “whats point then?” literally not. given one virus. would easy list examples viruses getting deadlier time supposedly given, don't, haven't. thing actually supposed thrown away couple uses max know several people like too. family. And, unless get Delta first, eventually get vaccine, something like December something. Incredibly frustrating even interact phone.  send many ""group emails"" Delta happen include group rest group beard email really them. exhausting. least wasn’t Bar-the-lona? point thousands people drive major retail area three encounters happened, walked past hundreds people went day, three dicks. hope realize pandemic goes longer potential worse decide take vaccine. way view human life quite frankly disgusting. understand it’s “not emotional issue” dealing disease ERADICATED, don’t understand wait see attitude, even given fact many Americans taken already. suggest move India observe happens lack vaccines. 

Also think full shit, it’s severe flu, it’s disease that’s contagious anything observed before. bet get perverse thrill perpetuating virus. Government-run health care. Ah, would suck thinking [first countable imagine would mean virus lasts forever 😅 condemning children death want wear fucking mask, I'm sick this.

Then suggest visit CDC website find relative mortality Covid flu children. HINT: Covid19 danger children comparable/lower flu's danger. Maybe loan forgiveness medical workers

Keep going. Forgiving loans debt bubble trillions chief.  Aw thank you. think we're trying best.
That's really interesting something ever even knew about. absolutely loved pharmaceutical side job (and always kicked becoming pharmacist) obsessed reading trials research comes pandemic unfolds that's area interest. 

I'm necessarily looking anything permanent/full time bat I'm definitely training learning new skills would required. decided yet I'll leave nursing behind (I still plan look nursing job first since know) given prospects think so, thank you!  engineering, little-omega sometimes used represent angular frequency. Here's hoping get periodic version...  Yep second exactly 18hrs hell 103 fever, os tired feel like getting drinking anything wanted sleep. bam back normal, pizza dinner appetite previously, got cut grass next day lol. want answer question, need provide history behind discrimination. Like ""accommodate"" with? know many people generation even apply college, busy earning enough money survive. times life, expectations never survive reality. 70+ years, still able find guarantee anywhere life supposed fair. times personal happiness determined deal everything stacked us, successful are. know one person never satisfied life, whole world people stole something never first place, despite claims robbed. Um. bad? woman poster child someone belong jail. Google bit; ""operation"" effects community pretty horrifying.  it? regular flu kills quite people every year? run around call anyone get ""antivaxxer!!""? I've vaccines, believe cause anything negative, 6 months. Ever see medical lawyer commercials? supposed safe tested right? also run around lotteries people quit smoking lose weight. Obesity major factor covid deaths well 21% Healthcare, push people lose weight, celebrate tell everyone happy.  Sure talk there, push government pretty staggering. know recent event, still.

I understand get I'm coming from, opinion like mine. informed something want terms health take seriously. US legally spouse. ready legally right nurse. needs finish certification employed, cannot legally right now. applied visa would allow work become full-fledged nurse US. denied immigration said despite shortage degree experience, boon community. exodus nurses anything vaccine mandates? Everyone thinking criminals victims, one thinking victims criminal actions. Sorta sad IMO. 

Are cases could less carceral? Certainly. Ms. Hechtman person die name cause. Ever since got two Pfizer vaccines I've become one 5G network, never lose cellphone service anywhere. Artimbau, 14, gets dose Soberana 02 vaccine clinical trials hospital amid concerns spread coronavirus disease (COVID-19) Havana, Cuba, June 29, 2021.

Regardless, entire handling Covid-19 response demonstrated one thing clearly: West forgotten **quarantine** means.

God/Buddha/Allah/Whoever help West truly dangerous pandemic ever breaks out. half-asses 'flatter curve' measures cut it. Maybe. time many people know through. Done.

There's documentaries made them. living well South Korea, often seen second class citizens. also allowed freely return NK illegal SK travel NK... uncomfortable around someone think vaccinated, stay 10, 20, 100 ft away... wear 10 masks.. anything think protect think vaccination status. U guys ever think might Covid. read article said healthcare workers impacted Long Covid many returned work months.  people lost loved ones

Yes losing loved ones makes expert science . people lie internet What’s hospitalization rate age group delta variant without vaccination? Doctors earn $250k average per year they’re underpaid? see rolling around Mercedes, Porsches Tesla’s Beverly Hills? data messy, still points masks effective.

It's ego colonial business practices need look printing fingers others IMO, media’s giving vaccine hesitant people reasons get it. fence, I’d thinking “What’s point doesn’t work well variants experts saying wear masks again?”

The reporting “There’s variant called Delta, it’s big deal, vaccines 80-whatever percent effective infection 90-whatever percent effective serious illness death Delta. Go get vaccinated, here’s how” UK leader sequencing pretty much since beginning. Taking profits equation probably helps tbh. america's immigration system build around one simple goals: keep non-white people out. way they're pretty good. There’s set model virus evolution. Viruses act differently. Stop talking butt could make 100k year 20 percent bonus found tonight brother symptomatic Covid. vaccinated March (Pfizer) hasn’t masking anymore. suppose could useful alive propaganda purposes. would coached tell people ""truth"" South Korea, claiming saw first-hand South Korea awful place live, claimed higher prosperity South Korea propaganda.

But likely explanation never actually defected South Korea, North Korean agent pretending defect.  Neither. headlines, sharing information regarding coronavirus coronavirus vaccine. yet admins paid like kings history mRNA vaccines? common use Covid-19 something new? Well suffering half gone mandate lift, completely gone time passes goverment still go back rules, again, mental illness ""i really fully happy"" problem. currently indoors mandate crowded places, even compare face outside, one 1000 times bearable, that's all. fuck it, abolish borders. argument, no?

NP pay might RN pay, hospital bill NP much higher rate. read article industry trade publication geared managing healthcare practices (from business perspective) explained hot new trend. Hospitals/clinics want give NPs many tasks possible traditionally would go doctors charge almost rate insurance. goal hire tons NPs don’t hire doctors. 

Patients getting billed physician’s rate getting NP instead. Since NPs cheaper, administration gets pocket difference. entire goal increase profits, mention passing savings patients. I'm sorry are... millions people died around world sudden cure .. lost many people fall it. said earlier response something like “Thank concern. take it.” (I don’t know word omitted meant be.) response reasonable person would interpret meaning haven’t vaccinated.

I’ve taken seriously whole time wearing mask since beginning

I saying someone chemo susceptible basically everything one bothered care husband given shit today grocery store wearing mask. woman 70s. North Georgia sucks. Idk. Reddit extracts title link change later. bother changing  I've met enough overly-confrontational Americans dismiss anecdote hand. Besides, I've watched plenty viral videos Americans confrontations masks. AZ J&amp;J blood clot risk largely happening women, wouldn’t safer protocol use vaccines men age group instead?

Or wait Novavax? Results new Cuban vaccine? Russia’s new EpiVacCorona? I’d say I’m wearing mask protect something that’s less likely kill driving store. don’t even know else say. appear strong grasp viruses vaccines work. I’d suggest legitimate research reading scientific studies study up. arguments simply aren’t based reality. Covid less 1% IFR, order magnitude 0.01% -0.1%.

CFR misleading counts people got confirmed test.  certainly wasn’t trying imply established “narrative” health science workers agreeing given time. know information evolves understanding science grows. 
By “narrative” meant, flow information posts sub others like it. Management treating nurses others ""they job"". Good luck that. People absolutely feel morally injured betrayed. hey, military veterans.... One countries diplomatic ties NK. Plus I’m sure Russian hooker sent spy gathering intel KGB. vaccine means nothing like barely protection go that. Maybe thats many dont want get vaxed like say [what work 60 hours week money 40? Nah. work 60 hours, I’d beat boss’s pay OT. Sometimes it’s better highest paid hourly employee take salaried position. like life outside work. Yea everything goes agaisnt narrative mental illness ""get therapy"" ""get therapy"" ""get therapy"" ""get therapy"" ""get therapy"" ""get therapy"" ""get therapy"". Im sure redditors already dedicated macro key write ""get therapy"" keyboards.

Its masks, completely. measures boring yeah, curfews closures that, masks biggest ""attack"" life efforts. specially enraging see countries enduring strict mask rules yet faring good yours, cherry added top. Also, mask rules eased country, half anxiety gone away, (the half mandate come back, time tell), definitely masks. wasnt masks ""muh mental illness"", anxiety gone away mandates eased. catalyst another ""issue"", direct stomp huge lengthy life project had, that's all. Yup, one mind blowing fact one country separates Finland NK - Russia. No. Worth shot, say? Earth moving equipment? They’re probably forcing COVID patients use every last remaining ounce energy dig graves. think really accident. Hospitals required pay benefits offer lots advantages full time staff. Travelers get none things. market saturated travelers everyone leaving staff jobs, rates go lots temporary staff use without pay benefits keep around summer census low. It'll dream come true. *sad trombone* shots laid AZ 36 hours moderna 3 days. Moderna side effects awful. It’s important highest risk groups get vaccinated part that’s happened . 

As time ticks people feel comfortable getting shot nearing 70% population August September probably around time getting it. Considering camp teens, I’d argue parents face consequences, (unless they’re 18+) otherwise I’m you. Kerkrade Heerlen? hate say, anti-maskers piss end, good luck getting people ditched mask point start wearing one again... Well countries mainly east already gone willing population longer supply issue them. choose associate anyone mask right can't afford trust people word. half state give shit. sit trust people without masks unvaccinated, I""m exposing risk catching variant. already mental disability. can't afford even wiff long-covid mental side effects. excuse bullshit. government could force distributors sell hospitals. stock Home Depot drop ocean compared supply chain. 3 days post moderna second vaccine. Felt kind shitty Monday work, reminiscent hangover drinking draft night. arm feels like someone big mean punched arm Monday. shots arm. It’s like punch nothing perspective. 

Would 100 times over, apparently ventilator sucks worse punch arm. (Never ventilator, punched arm)   boat. Better safe sorry Sounds like need get doses then. Around 6 months multivalent boosters would still better.  vaccinated need wear mask, science clear risk contracting COVID extremely low even lesser chance contracting COVID spreading it. 

However still chance contracting COVID even vaccinated (albeit small chance) effectiveness vaccines variants delta delta + less clear (although looks like efficacy variants still extremely high) wearing mask situations even vaccinated unwarranted. personally wore mask months fully vaccinated kids (twins 13) fully vaccinated wear mask required (doctors office), shopping courtesy working reduce risk contracting COVID enclosed indoor space. necessary, no, small gesture interact something control reduce already extremely small chance contracting COVID. 

I personally problems someone fully vaccinated going lives, part got vaccinated risk society. Living New England life pretty much returned normal directly due vaccines vaccination rates. Vaccines work rest country would get board could put past year half behind us. based I’ve read, Israel recorded 300 new cases Covid two days row, significant increase represents highest daily cases two months. half cases supposedly occurring fully vaccinated individuals. work lab, pretty much everyone hopefully believes science/is vaccinated)

Why hope?

I worked medical professionals vaccination sites multiple workers believe whole Covid thing exaggerated going take vaccines. people entire career put hold, clinics basically shut down, sent work mass vac site 6+ months. They're literally ""front lines"" Covid battle.

It's like soldier sitting mud &amp; rat filled trench WW II getting shelled every hours injured decapitated carried thinking; ""Meh, war fake. much exaggeration going newsreels. basically Saturday night street fight bar district."" Ralph sit wearing duncehat, apparently. Delta dangerously transmissive, curve flattened. Singapore Taiwan gradually so.  Right?? totally trust science. best friend mom says “I’m fully vaccinated, come dinner.” Okay, yes, please! don’t think they’re significant risk son. 

Strangers whole different story. That's reason waited 20 years.

It's long keep excitement touted fake conspiracy long.

Physchology funny thing. European country based science populist thinking. argument vaccinating younger people first reduce transmission, none prioritise certain occupations, outside health workers. racism, homophobia, transphobia exist? Cool, guess missed memo uptick hate crimes past year aggressive attempts restrict voting rights targeting minority communities well general attempts restrict trans rights.

Must nice worry that.  know. feel better knowing sneeze, cough whatever near me, I'm little better off. Honestly, might first winter get cold cough years, thanks masks.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* saying wear them. CDC says to. I’d love trust cdc things handled first time around I’m skeptical. know there’s new people office doesn’t change everything.  Human nature? I've wearing mask protect others year now. country full anti-maskers ignorant people felt like solidarity seeing people wearing masks. like, ""yeah country lot fucked people least lot us empathy understanding."" Wearing mask right thing awhile now, taking afraid lumped category unempathetic assholes seems like understandable concern, even really reasonable. 

FYI, mask since told CDC okay, still understand people trouble processing it. Im 22, dont move much generally quite fit nonetheless, dont smoke dont drink dont health complications, also dont put effort healthy whatsoever, like, time eat something green/healthy, cooks working Burger King dont forget put lettuce SteakHouse burger. times, call package biscuits breakfast. get picture. curious well still alive.

You're still alive cause 22. keep another decade start feel damage done yourself. Lol think going end. Cute Healthy people getting tested time. Every procedure do, patient must get tested before, vaccinated not. Everyone gets hospitalized, gets periodic covid testing hospitalization. simply seeing asymptomatic, vaccinated carriers large scale. 

And second paragraph really make sense me. covid19, severity symptoms seems due inflammatory response body, due viral load give birth us… that’s another story. Yeah always thought cloth masks temporary stop gap could increase supply effective masks. Guess not… Yeah jocular anyway, glad kids listen ya less arguments mine lol Viral RNA sequencing proved person B caught person A. CCTV showed little contact had. mean typical, clearly possible. Well .... shit. call alpha omega variant next telling us walk water. 88% 1 10 chance still infected, hey it’s life. fits ur narrative, Soon? funny. think like making educated guesses since know real life data Pfizer USCDC desperately trying coax enough Americans take damn vaccine science. Yeah people getting. Sure, wearing mask physically harmful superficially inconvenient (i.e. acne, fogging glasses etc), work reduce spread. go year without actually seeing people's faces, fucks head. clue people bothered all, there's huge psycho-social factor comes there. first time went somewhere people mostly wearing masks felt dopamine release brain.  

I wear mask anymore fully vaccinated. whole point wearing masks vaccines! keep one bag case business asks/requires wear one, respect right enforce that, I've yet see anything beyond ""masks optional"". live Marin, Nextdoor people clamoring still wearing masks  work (I work lab, pretty much everyone hopefully believes science/is vaccinated)

This time, incredibly funny incredibly sad.

I hear though, run gamut work everything relies science, ""not gonna it"", to, ""yep, fully vaccinated"". 2 use wore masks vaccine readily available. People incredibly stupid easily swayed utter nonsense. working hard act like conspiracy virus going every race somehow legitimate black people countered logic. here...the 2nd dose bit rough...for day...totally worth it. know that's true lot people, can't believe that's true all. fail see helpful say stuff like I'm seeing across sub. also get people seem offended say ""hey, think advocating letting whole bunch people die, matter stupid are.""  CDC burned credibility public, cut preparation time majority people, hospitals undersupplied anyway. delay band aid stop flood harm good. serious? Well, know last summer. last summer 2 Wear mask not. 
My biggest problem it’s corporations/establishments/events enforce “if vaccinated okay wear mask”

That’s biggest problem. know do, rely good old honor system. 

Just past weekend kids went collectible show announcement outside “if vaccinated…”
But nobody, NOBODY, checking see ones wearing mask indeed vaccinated. 

Do you, safe, respect others. I’m fully vaccinated going keep mask maybe rest year cuz don’t trust people.  cousin age instances refusing wear trying take etc

A lot kids instances like regardless whether adults around wearing masks. mean, 2-year-olds refuse eat food everyone else table eating... can't attribute failure model works may work everyone else.

Sure, seems like people responding even tried, assume kids able handle it. They're taking think path least resistance. ADULTS plenty time get vaccinated. problem kids 12 still can’t get vaccine. kid 12 I’m best protect. I’m vaccinated still wear mask everywhere get it, may fine due vaccine protection. Add delta variant hitting kids harder I’m pretty nervous. We’re still living lock-down protect him. pandemic isn’t families kids get vaccine too. Fully vaccinated. Sometimes wear mask sometimes don't. really care protecting point. vaccinated person exposed unvaccinated person COVID, safe see person vaccinated? Yeah, there’s enough anti-vaxxers vaccine hesitant get us close need can’t get degree protection.  listen speak? Thats selfish makes zero sense. world happened people. Yes, combine tracers alarm household contacts regularly getting now, see notched bit.

I agree, aware, things happen. they're happening consistently more, talking disease effect compounds substantially, issue.  joke repeatedly dismissed possibility wave last summer. 

Hey, guess what--there another wave!

I think we'll probably see another wave point, stating anything future certain--and particularly mocking disagree you--isn't sign trustworthy intellect, imho. unable verify vaccine status toughest bit. It’s predicated “the honor system” you’re right you’re place rates vaccination aren’t high nobody masked… folks aren’t honorable. I’m tho, childless I’d childless friends - getting vaxxed, traveling, enjoying stuff missed! might say never one America divide. U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky issued clarification COVID-19 “Delta” variant, proclaiming fully vaccinated individuals protected strain don’t need wear masks. bold assume history books much longer need stories highlighted convince vaccine holdouts get shot. Ice age coming ice age coming 
Throw fire throw fire throw everybody spreads virus well though everyone passing 10 seconds. Making mandatory really feasible it’s shown vaccines provide protection years. It’s really feasible tell low-income parents get kids vaccinated every year. knowledge that’s required anywhere. 

But absolutely it’s absolutely essential often recommended. See places still wear mask, ones get mad irritated I’m wearing instantly reveal anti-mask probably aren’t vaxxed. masks like superman vision. Ironic final minutes proved Darwinian natural selection, and, peer vaccinated eyes doctor, vaccines work.  Hell yeah. too. yet see academic study asserting cloth mask (particularly one worn 3-year old) anything limit personal exposure disease? pre-COVID19 literature quite bearish masks protecting individuals (as opposed acting source control). actual constructive sources add conversation, please do. Well tell people wearing masks organization saying to? People wearing masks mostly protecting people getting sick. reduces transmission. pandemic over. That's really it. FDA website:

[Why Use Ivermectin Treat Prevent think Great Filter theory something fascinating explain disconnect likelihood intelligent life likelihood us witnessing it. think Great Filter event coming next 100-200 years think positioned well get it. likely intelligent species even know us killed quickly expand influence far enough. difference way larger among younger adults older ones look partisan gap. Can't blame Boomers Silents, way Gen-X/Millenials/Gen-Z live rural areas lower college education rates. vaccine hesitancy US incredible, 54% first vaccine considering they’re huge supply vaccines could assume 40% pop anti-Vaxxers, massive amount people. low all. Almost 60% population fully vaccinated. take south numbers much high. northeast intents purposes well past herd immunity. Get bs.  little less new variant, seemingly moreso vaccine types others. shit people chose vaccinate even though they’re eligible? Excluding 12 immunocompromised course. People berate vaccinated people wearing masks: cool. I’m confused risk unknowable yet also known insignificant. Would nice preliminary data efficacy masks vaccines preventing infection, transmission, serious disease sequelae numbers vaccinated unvaccinated cases crossed asymptomatic symptomatic cases. One-year exposure/infection/serious consequence probabilities given geographical regions economic sequelae probabilities would also useful. Without using reliable relative risk numbers it’s possible argue masks vaccines making large reductions insignificant risk.  surprised actual findings closer ""The Delta variant *can* transmit less 10 seconds"", obviously sexy enough. 
I strongly doubt guaranteed transmission within 10 seconds would lead current global infection rates. numbers high (actually increasing again), true, numbers would absolutely roof ever variant (becoming) dominant numbers fully vaccinated people still low (which pretty much everywhere except lucky nations).  Yes, that’s less correct locals. It’s tourists problem. Tourism big part Tampa Bay. I’m especially careful around places like international airport behind nice mall. Lots people world. definitely kind staying power. Felt like got punched arm times, took long nap day times, inflamed lymph node armpit week second. Would benefit provides. Anything everything time risk. risk might still spread delta unvaccinated people. Make sure friends vaccinated. Sadly nada effectiveness preventing transmission matters anyone living people can’t get vaccine yet. 

I know also need make blanket statements generally, it’s mildly concerning throw “oh j+j probably less so!”. FOREVER wearing masks airplanes.

Good!! I've wearing mask airplanes past eight years several vacations ruined picking upper respiratory infections plane. since started wearing mask flew, never another vacation ruined illness. One america guns too. Care explain how? I'm smartass, would like know got wrong. righteous, vindicated better others part actually part said. believe enlightened something, current word used ""patriotic"" quite them. stubborn aspect, though, huge.

The lemming part also true. certain person gotten vaccination national tv rather hiding back room getting needle, people would willing get vaccinated. Probably combination items, poor work conditions (not building hours uncertainty schedules), long hours substantial pay increase, natural exodus pandemic, upheaval employment markets general, etc.. family medical care (one doctor one nurse practitioner think is) saying (this months ago) crazy past year starting return normal there's lot people retiring quitting find different professions work non-hospital settings many hospitals budgets, equipment, staff, state bit frenzy. No, won’t. patients getting sicker sicker ICU nurses keep bed alive longer longer  literally misinformation.  Bonus shift ... Shift differential, bonus, takes get staffed, trade sides. would rather confront potentially dangerous crazy people walk away? Yes. talk wear mask walking store briefly wearing one entering restaurant. huge wave infection relatively recently. pattern cyclical everywhere, they’re low part wave right now. hopefully keep low vaccinating large portion population.  Evidence without process evidence all. Example article sub week ago “No evidence vaccine causes fertility problems children” uhh shit, kids fully formed adults evidence doesn’t exist. even make statement. easiest fixate problems easily solved. people already wear seatbelts, point belong here. Exercising takes massive amount time.

Vaccinating covid, hand, quick easy. fair comparison since UK US vaccinated majority eligible population already therefore natural take rate tail cross 80% (as case UK) 65% (as case US) sort mixing two arguments there. unfair people twenties allowed in, vaccinating bartenders make difference that. even increased exposure risk, young person still much risk serious illness someone older.

As well protected level herd immunity diners vaccinated. really odd. I’m pretty sure hospitals rest states can. catch weren’t routinely given childhood child start working hospital. know can't prudent keep mask mandates vaccine program essentially finished. Even Delta wave inevitable, jump start removing masking? Usually bad reaction first dose second it’s cause you’ve already it. I've known many people died I'm trusting vaxx reasons... could almost say I'm anit-anti- vaxx. Like 100% believe deadly is, masked stayed f-in. can't believe something devastating fixed like that. Reporting referring official statistics, literal reporting news sources.

And validate pretty easily. look excess death numbers. Actually, looking excess death numbers lead total estimation COVID-involved deaths closer million alone US.

I don’t trust politicians, trust career scientists who’ve dedicated lives stuff. Yeah sadly agree you. Let’s hope 2022 finally normal. I've seen numerous reports delta variant typically causes headache, sore throat, and/or runny nose primary symptoms versus ""classic"" covid symptoms.  

It may well transmissible seem severe - anything, seems getting less severe previous variants concern.  viruses tend mutate; later successful variants usually contagious less virulent. People downvoting ""herd immunity,"" cliff 80 90%. much virus spreads function of

- percent vaccinated
- percent previously infected
- much contact people people (lockdowns, avoiding social situations)
- precautions people take contact (masks, gathering outdoors)
- contagiousness particular variant

I think previously infected play role downturn, none factors happen isolation. always think military socialist. pool money pay people collectively protect us. Otherwise, individually hiring soldier time war go fight. I'm pretty worried whole, mask-up sit thing going keep going. I'm conspiracy theorist, wanted keep population immobile, I'd definitely looking opportunistically problem! think non-technical / less-technical careers well known, happy spread knowledge.

For worth, 4-year degree always requirement (even job posting says is!) - although definitely helps. years experience developing communication &amp; problem solving skills high-pressure career might well sufficient (especially frame like that)! Nope. Vaccinations aren’t perfect, rely good enough drop transmission rate r &lt; 1. 

 mosh pit similar situation extreme pro-viral thing do. Add fact people likely participate one also likely vaccinated get go me. thought greek letters hurricanes... hit aircraft suppliers hard left lot people unemployed, could say industry give 2 shits either. should

Supply low demand high naturally increase wages (at least one would think). definitely agree nurses treated better. basically looks hair combed back? shame. thought said nurses make far than— oh wait read wrong. Sorry I’ll close door way out.

P.S. Al Abama nurse (entry level)earn 24 compared 30 Georgia. Per hour. say worried anything. person discussion made claims often anything happens. Yes, waste time talking ass whole time. really sounds like visa issue ""not boon community"" issue. matter country switching one type visa nearly impossible royal pain neck. Honestly surprising denied. guarantee visa denied attempted immigration fraud (even never intention), eligible whatever visa trying switch to, meeting specific process acquiring visa (many visa's must applied outside country), agent interviewing toothache day.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Again, vaccine unvaccinated, infected people get sick. live people get shot moderna pfizer second dose got astra first. Get touch doctor! vaccine fully approved

That's one topic take contention with. simply matter protocol ""fully approved"". set procedures timeframe required considered fully approved. Normally take years finding number candidates get results problematic. considering we're midst pandemic, data easy come by, data really need, follow protocol wait minimum timeframe make ""official"". Hundreds millions people vaccinated people perfectly fine. That's enough me. intention trying convince anyone get shot, 

Agreed. Trying convince someone lost cause think. point either stubborn read/consider actual facts measure facts decided take risk get vaccinated. point, gotta let people they're gonna do. mean dig holes way going used graves. daily routine way something absurdly rare bad risk assessment.

Not change trivially easy comes real downside. trade heavily China. isn't. drugs?  Alcohol? Jumping planes dangerous, tell someone it. Because, sadly, we've people hospitalised, disabled, killed AZ year virus. average person 50, ""the experts"" consider riskier living community unvaccinated due low incidence disease.

Combine lower protection delta can't overcome community feels inferior. 5x hospitalisations 1-dose, 2x 2-doses. latter takes months acquire AZ, weeks Pfizer (PHE study).

Short gagging media making AZ compulsory take, thing Feds could done manage mRNA supply well. didn't. [Weren't willing apparently. Edgy internet comments one telling do. Wear mask. care less. I'm want hear it. think get paid well, less states around Alabama. friend nurse Alabama, worked UAB wanted move family Georgia, near state line, make money. Yikes, seeing like-dislike ratio, guess people antivax get sick. IDC them. Honestly, drink lots fluids. Probably bad idea grab pedialite refrain taking Tylenol whatever unless you’re really feeling it. made sick dog worth it. couldn’t imagine catching real thing unvaccinated. Get teeth pulled. Brushing teeth inefficient compared using dentures. live Canada. Immune suppressed folks vulnerable COVID everything else forever. proposing mandate everyone wears masks rest eternity? Huh? Thank source.

So that's 3 weeks first dose 33% vs 50% previous variant. That's substantial dip tell whole story. Immunity continues increase quite afterwards first dose. I'll wear mask long let think sexy, even I'm not. Sure is.  I’m taking particular approach can’t force people...  argument sounds similar banning abortions. cannot stop woman aborting future citizen United States keep baby body choice cannot force take vaccine body choice too. right ban jobs schools cannot force someone take jab will. Everyone right refuse treatment. ""Haha, North Korea funny crazy country"" memeing fun good, seriously misrepresenting response here. North Korea shut border January 22 2020. literally first country world so. 

They also sealed border due freakin' ebola outbreak Africa possible COVID-19 ended slipping anyway, tricky virus. probably fair say literally country earth, besides island nations, capabilities apparent willingness seal borders effectively North Korea. Hospitals clearly pay worker; use travelers. refusing increase pay? 

Because much goes paycheck.

When take temporary worker, provide insurance benefits. need make sure fit team - don't, they'll gone. need anymore - gone. need find reason fire negotiate raises. They're temporary anyway.

It's reason renting car costs per month buying exact car - pay money upfront locked paying lot overall later. thought might need car couple months, would better deal.  Kids…immune suppressed folks… Opening window would probably much likely more, simple many cases, never hear peep that. playing game. type announce everyone mother something. am. ]

Most people real world really care. people (parents, assorted family members, work, etc) need know vaccinated know fully vaccinated. 

If concerned risk people, onus stay away people vaccination status. assume everyone vaccinated. Spreading asymptomatically among vaccinated allow virus evolve toward vaccine breakthrough. hopefully take time kind evolution becomes matter concern, there's essentially benefit allowing uncontrolled spread (or population). 

Not think change anyone's mind countries like US, much matter ""benefit anti-vaccine,"" even category people immediate risk. capable kind concern long term thinking, 600K dead first place. assume Putin army Russian hookers utilizes gather Intel whomever downvoted missing possessive apostrophe, didn’t upvote. Cases still low, Australia responds strictly even couple cases (especially considering delta variant). There's 30 new cases today whole country bunch would already isolation infectious period. think one area Novavax beneficial - young men. better side-effect profile highly efficacious. Israel also months ahead every country world vaccinations Delta even existed. context completely different.

It's doom gloom warn certain future precautions absent, modicum foresight. People chemo can’t get vaccine cases. vitamins people take would aleviate prevent side effects vaccines? I'm asking common ones like tiredness, chills, on, much serious life threatening ones. stands vaccinated puts risk , me. 

Our vaccines highly effective forms illness. point set one another ,? It’s pathological obsession. someone chooses keep risk that’s problem. 

“But variants!!” … variants continue appear globe perpetuity. could vaccinate every breathing human US wouldn’t change fact . It’s much likely happen place virus allowed run rampant . 50 percent vaccination throwing hell buffer Welcome medical care profit. another symptom widespread problem. don't. literally premise comment. I'd feel someone doused gasoline decided shoot fireworks off. vaccines 33% effective symptomatic disease B.1.617.2 three weeks first dose, whereas 50% effective Well stop others breathing - everyone room wearing mask think helps. It’s increasingly common subreddit, lol. Talk “the new normal”…

I’m sure bots/paid… makes things better lol  dropped mask mandate ended regretting

Outdoors without facemask, fully vaccinated little safer long inches people spend time regularly household.

and

2) Shit NO! bigger person can’t hospitals hire CNAs run around delivering non medical things like water bedpans?  make sure political differences get way vaccine sharing. plenty vaccines point priority send countries don't. sending vaccines them, enough whole population. else fails, resort ad hominem farcical hyperbole. Oh... I'm idiot. context sentence's phrasing thought acronym something meant ""shut down"". 😜 Yes truly believe vaccine, new variant Delta becoming prevalent. Even got mild symptoms, preventable, would risk health someone wasn’t responsible enough get vaccinated? rising sharply significant sense. There's bit blip, hear ya. Share see happens!  appropriate tell people bodies concerns something dangerous Covid. vs CDC 

Who follows science 😱 science american 😷 Oh sorry. thought meant favor “rolling dice.” misunderstood. bad.  Sorry buddy wanna chat grocery store either lmao, move along, earbuds in. seriously doubt conversation worth cold anyway. mean way aunt talked poisoning two kids taking Pfizer vaccine? Yeah. Everyone make decisions, they're adults. want to, there's convincing. Try reading social media comments. way listen kind reason. whole point guidance that, vaccinated, stand unmasked, right next unmasked infected person unlikely get sick. completely true. reassured vaccine. makes unlikely get sick, unlikely get sick, extremely unlikely die. Finally someone reading news doesn’t anti-mask agenda. 600k people died US year. That's US. way comparable flu deaths. Hard stop. Speedy case. agree provided context. Capitalized word ""at"" emphasis. anyone interested, happened Rushville, IL. part state might well Missouri Russian specifically? also work medium size rural hospital everyone fucking burnt out. vacation two years, heard head nursing say mental health issues among nurses killing losing staff left right. work admin/it side come every day, constant call got absolutely nothing (neither nurses fucking deserve it) everyone fucking it. want new job badly rural really nothing else around need insurance right Anti-maskers downvoted trying protect others. really classy thread. AT? Fauci said masks pointless new one disease worry about, one they're significantly likely get diseases vaccines.

New diseases spring time, status quo... serious ones cause pandemics cease normal life vaccine made. time back status quo, far people unwilling get vaccinated. 

And unless want start forced vaccinations that's gonna change. need accept rest society bears burden.

Insofar people get sick? Sure. asking continually wear mask subsect society lives perpetual delusion wasting time. forced wear mask forced take vaccine? makes sense... Yeah, I've used chart times question ""which country would rather be""?

^Table ^formatting ^brought ^to ^you ^by grass taste, gonna ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ CDC says need mask vaxxed; says mask up. science young, personally I'd rather err side caution keep mask bit longer. I'll deal foggy glasses weird mask-edge acne probably contract delta variant. 88 % safe two shots Pfizer, says. fully protected. Plus, vaccinated people pass covid infected people unvaccinated ones.

In country several cases Delta version infecting fully vaccinated, health authorities recommend masks even two doses. (Although people follow this, recommended required law.) Canada loudly widely criticised early-on placing orders every vaccine available, seven-times population?

Who critisised Canada that??

I thought complaint ordered late least failed secure priority.

Orders flying multiple vaccines many countries large amounts way trial results in.  sure plane? hospital level air circulation filtration. Hotels restaurants, however...

I suppose someone right near hacking, could see donning mask, general concern. thought CDC already recommended individuals underlying medical conditions (including cancer immunocompromised state) get vaccinated immune-suppressing drugs immune response

That actually true. sufficient evidence yet show immune-suppressing drugs immune response 

To point who've organ transplants, good news study participants received organ transplant given two vaccine doses. published JAMA, found 1st dose, 15% measurable antibody response, 2nd dose, 47% measurable antibody response. 

Obviously, much lower general population, however protection better protection, would argue getting vaccine immunocompromised persons, CDC recommends, best option, no? Since im exposed ''*more* actual virus'' compared Sinovac, thought would hazardous weaker immune system.

No? coolest part allows ""stretch"" mRNA doses. Twice many people get excellent protection, got one vaccines first dose. would help media would mediate reduce confusion Yes, exactly spouse kids too. they're younger average congressman too. might Q idiots senators/congressmen quite time enough get in. thing is, everyone knows eat healthy exercise. pandemic, reducing spread priority measures take help something totally new us. Stay home doesn’t mean don’t exercise though. know didn’t stop spending time outdoors throughout pandemic. Hell, dog park every morning dog pandemic- even made new friends. Yeah, that's fair. There's definitely confusion messaging though. CDC director saying vaccinated people worry Delta variant, meanwhile California (I believe?) They're asking even vaccinated people put mask precaution becoming vector. 

All I'm saying, stay withing whatever guidelines live. part problem God forbid vaccinated Europeans come here. Nah let's make sure borders open unvaccinated South Americans though Thank reply. That's I'm looking someone talk it. know gets toxic here. Yeah.... things mitigate risk children like putting car seats, making sit back, etc.? Kind like wearing mask around get vaccinated.  People downvoting ur 1000% correct read John Stuart Mill or, well, anything. Good, doctors asking months. People vaccinated 2 Coronavac shots recieve Pfizer-Biontech shot now. might well waved american confederate flag spoke ended bit global independence MURICA! authorities asses eyes nations. last part edit weird.

What owning guns anything? saw real life boarder. Walls climbed. LoL publicly. Coming forward article might convince someone else get vaccinated. don’t understand comment. I’m saying someone chooses get vaccine, purposefully putting bad situation (not necessarily regard covid risk, willingly restricting themselves). aware restricting getting vaccinated, still choose to. Therefore, might well good reason get vaccinated, would better find reason(s) assume it’s stupidity. mean, would feel find immunocompromised aunt got sick died gave covid? vaccine you, mask her. don’t understand flip-flop tp entirely different organizations.

WHO said keep wearing masks vaccinations protect Delta variant.

CDC said don’t wear masks fully vaccinated protected Delta variant.

Who listen to? Better yet, trust giving us correct information? Maybe people could allergic whatever carrier fluid is? filled form, seemed like asking broadly allergies rather anything specific vaccine. sounds like, immuno-compromised people, getting vaccine means less likely lead creation antibodies. good enough push R(with mitigations) 1.3 1.0ish. Measures terrific slow even tamp spread. might American sentence ever suggests masks indoors delta variant CDC saying different things since start pandemic saying we’re safe we’ve vaccinated. friend got sick vaccinated. horribly so, still … don’t want it. I’m finding CDC particularly trustworthy last year’s debacle. I've colds worse effects first dose. know guys got Pfizer knocked two. Got August second dose tho still bit wait. yeah hoping it'll mild headache sore arm again. always people susceptible disease unable get vaccines, that's nothing new.

What new one disease worry about, one they're significantly likely get diseases vaccine new disease everyone able willing get so. far I'm concerned back status quo

We back status quo, far people unwilling get vaccinated. achieved 90% coverage vaccines MMR. means herd immunity generally reached.

Getting even 65% vaccinated COVID currently seems quite problematic. may therefore able reach herd immunity due minority people. rest society bears burden. someone explain 2.1 fold reduction efficacy means? Moderna 94% effective base virus, would 2.1 fold reduction efficacy equal?  barely protected mask anyway? They're protecting others one else wearing one really help much wear one.  expecting, sinovac bad vaccine effective old ages Turkey used mainly elders doctors.We can't take risk delta hit us. Also vaccination speed started slow decreasing 2 dose interval correct Correct I'm wrong believe asking got Covid, got rid it, got three times 2 months? could easily changed couple days today story vaccinated people need wear masks.

""Need"" wear masks.  framed way? Maybe people wear masks even *need* wear masks great sacrifice help guarantee spread slows (along measures like vaccination, distancing etc).  panic yet. reported Brazil every country world showing complete opposite data. Brazil variant also countries Speaking myself, frustration fact can't tell stranger's vaccination status. frustrating kids feel confident taking store museum can't really know they're coming contact people vaccinated. general frustration wish could held everyone could receive protection. Uk official government website, readily available 👍🏻 Yeah really, take break exercising 2 weeks might need counter anti inflammatory drugs. 

The blood clots almost always required hospitalization treatments would typically used blood clots actually made worse. People sub claiming UK passed peak 2 weeks ago .... TIL explaining position taking post attack.

The one needs calm tits you, mate. They're stupid. know Covid not. Obviously three times Covid I'm sure mocking questioning what. furious right now. Thanks! didn’t think would low US. Vaccine uptake polling 88% population Germany moment. 55% US seems really far that. anything, people wearing masks vaccinated going extra mile. vaccinated really OCD keep thinking “what if?” still use hand sanitizer wash hands like crazy, even seems unnecessary, I’d rather safe sorry. wound playing Epcot (Germany pavilion) couple retired dudes 70s. shooting shit, catching 'mons drinking beer. good time. issue common actually example #3. got sick 3 times two months getting vax. since past decade. absolutely correlation risk obesity risk covid-19 children. stating anything scientific. see someone wearing mask days, assume vaccinated trying extra careful.

I doubt, anyone unvaccinated ditched mask soon mandates lifted. 

I problem vaccinated people going maskless. unvaxxed causing issues. Pascals wager play far I'm concerned.

Cost cautious: Nil.

Cost 'the science' wrong: High.

And frankly think CDC trying 'balance' public health concerns, political economic concerns get go really bad job it. Could compared 6 months ago, daily deaths peak 1250 (seven days average). 17.

Admitted hospital per day 6 months ago 4200. 250. 6 months ago 39k admitted. 1.7k.

Six months ago 4k patients mechanical ventilation beds. 290. feel too. 3 year old 1 year old. likelihood getting super sick COVID low, new data showing many half symptomatic kids may get long Covid? take risks? see 79% efficacy Delta anywhere article, getting number from?  Realistically nothing vaccine. Tbh man covid would go year two without getting sick would happen randomly. None us super humans can't get sick. I'd call unlucky coincidence. let rumors scare decision. massive waves Covid hospitalizations deaths mask mandates place...the vaccines making waves go away...I talking serious cases...not ""casedemic"" like UK right now, serious cases super low despite Delta spike. glad live there! Yeah, think people different risk tolerances, that’s okay. worried getting hospitalized dying, probably wouldn’t mask. also don’t want mild Covid case, especially considering long term loss smell neurological symptoms. mom early onset dementia, maybe I’m concerned this. That’s okay too. wearing mask doesn’t bother all. I’ve years woodworker it’s second nature. cost wearing mask small, benefit potentially huge. It’s easy decision. example perfectly valid personal then, im happy wear mask...

Using approach though, right now, vaccinated people need mask US, since neither federal local guidelines places recommend mask vaccinated people. live, DC, example that. many others. fact, LA county one exceptions local guideline restrictive federal one. sounds like you’re alive.

And wore mask got vaccination. Case closed. That’s tough. Parents like hardest right  point treat covid like regular flu?

How killing ""regular flu"" amount people? US numbers below.

Over past 50 years Influenza killed 30 - 170 people per day annualized basis. current 7 day average COVID deaths still 272. Weekly Deaths - Causes also continues 5-year average every week since March 28, 2020.

Show people COVID killing excessive number people -- ""normal"" number -- call endemic instead epidemic / pandemic still is. Sounds like need organize Oregon RTW state? kids 2 10 weeks dumbass. affects everyone different; literally zero effects first shot outside sore arm. Second way worse, though gone less day, second one may mild since tough first one (that's I've heard anecdotally though). Either way worth deal covid anymore someone else also said, don’t want getting you’re sick don’t get people sick. really doesn’t matter much that. don’t know you’re infected, “rule” can’t really apply. Shouldn’t affect vaccine efficacy all. Agreed, except already met public? No. public well honest information time. sure jokes you’re referring to? Sorry hear illnesses. make sure I’m understanding correctly saying got COVID-19 three times past 2 months? could variant apparently developed Brazil too.  would like see evidence Netherlands fully reopened June 26th, 'cause not. 🤷‍♂️ Yes yes yes. I've followed advice closely whole damn time. Wore mask whole time. Got vaccinated soon possibly could (remember appointment tracker sites?) barely saw friends family whole time. even get hug family members year. CDC said wear mask, took mine off, unless required business whatever. People assume want but, I'm republican, pay attention science, give shit humans. silver lining guess feel confident ever amongst strangers. forget judged, that's problem. never state endgame is...which true endgame mask forever. mental health better past 6 weeks since 2019 (have bit SAD too), I'm sure can't alone.  Yeah whole design setup favor rural landed gentry. vaccinated? so, yes.

If not, go get vaccinated. Looks like Canada hit record today doses administered. 70+ downvotes rational. Oof. vaccinated scared one unvaccinated cousin? highhhly unlikely infected use “breakthrough cases” defense. There’s reason it’s called that. Thanks sharing opinion. STILL going wear mask indoors. 2 10 weeks old. Fuck anti-vaxxers. Well thankfully sanity restored organization. Can't control idiotic prior admin credibility, though agree you. people least competent, I'm far inclined listen them.   Atlantic source… 😂  Doctors outside US also graduate $300k+ student loans. Yeah, dislike tbh find bit offputting? Like obviously stop getting vaccinated, makes imagine someone chasing arm needle, lol. complicated idiots? last time heard someone die serious complications getting vaccine? Assuming live BC, even close norm. 

From government dose appointments follow similar schedule first doses, invitations sent first people clinically extremely vulnerable seniors.
For example, first dose early May, get invited book appointment late June.
Like first appointment, select location, date time. must appointment arrive clinic.

Early May appointments 55+ year olds. It’s year. Pfizer began phase 3 trials July 27th 2020 fyi chance get free Crocs. never got mine, I'm glad least thinking us!  virus mutates killing 2% everyone infects regardless prior vaccination, definitely strong attempts stop it. immune system works though. COVID deadly novel immune systems *completely* unprepared, even large mutation would leave immune system prepared vaccination. Never stopped. Louisiana full dumb fucks. told need if...they vaccinated. PA 49.5 percent vaccinated. means every person see masked because...half population state vacinated. seen single mask doctors office weeks. see teens, adults twenties,kids old folks without masks.  vaccines life? would imagine he's flu vaccine least right? wonder sense control whatever makes dog heels subjects like this. Well, yeah, really like photo. friend whose new lung condition miraculously improved first vaccine shot. need used. agree you, going EU bureaucracy means they'd expired anyone got shot. 

We vaccinate 100.000 day, proved so. Im going disagree you, slappymcnutface. stated seen 4 notable mutations far pandemic. 3 vaccine effective them. stander (Delta) still quite easy prevent vaccine, mention decreases severity disease tremendously. Like said, 180,000,000 confirmed COVID cases (way undocumented infections). Undoubtedly huge portion society exposed COVID. means lasting immunity, Thus infection rate going around world added help vaccines. COVID stop mutating won’t raging populations. vaccine time distribute across world 3 years like said history COVID turn common cold.

The short answer is: Yes, pandemic end. also cases Russia vastly underreported. perfect example toxicity health care seeing.

 Yes, RN’s stayed became NP’s doesn’t change fact bedside nursing position cast second class NP position. doesn’t change many nurses feel like way get respect go back school. honoring bedside nurses. 

You also say can’t speak “your RN folks act like feel burden”. aren’t “your folks”, stop treating children monolithic group thinks feels one way nursing. seem think don’t understand position without realizing work LIVE traveling nurses. hotels together. eat shitty breakfasts morning split takeout evening. talk kids families much miss them. trade tricks living suitcases horror stories assignments gone bad. year half road them, understand nurses people. travelers spend time full time staff often aloof downright hostile us. yeah “I don’t understand burden” 

And lastly attempt belittle telling “now go get work”. display attitude condescension nursing colleagues doubt. exactly want leave profession. toxicity tired battling. kind nurse would tell traveler suck crying missed child’s recital class party. I’m one finds crying bathroom telling missed daughters first steps residency. 

Thank showing us horrible, condescending attitude nurses everyone better understand done dealing people like anymore Nearly half adults Israel infected COVID-19 Delta variant completely inoculated Pfizer vaccine catching new strain, prompting Israeli government officials reimpose indoor mask mandate, new report revealed Friday. Yes, trying helpful. need aggression. look, getting vaccine late, it’s perfect, surge. plus you’ll go longer idiots like Brother Law skipped line, need booster least 6 months you. get it. don’t funeral pyres like India, we’ll run refrigerated morgues smell bad. save lives including Thank sharing this! Exodus nurses, exodus teachers, exodus cops, surely end well. ignore repentant anti-vaxxers anti-vaxxers letting nature weed weak stupid. Fine, let exploited then. employers generally don’t see anything necessary expense business. strongly recommend everyone wear masks, yes, mandate. bet 'Phuket' plan everything life days. gyms open NK Ontario? Personally I'm enjoying wearing mask, cases creep back significantly mask mandate put back effect, mask coming back on. nice wearing one, big deal need wear one.

The messaging super weird though. probably would better said vaccinated people go back pre-pandemic lives, still wear masks case. two dose sputnik probably superior AZ.  hasn’t year offer protection years ok! even democracy anymore? People able see families year bankers CEOs exampt restrictions. WTF. paid attention Biology class. mean getting downvoted people extra careful sub. reality antivaxxers people wear masks forever.

Either mandate law, admit danger still bring back hazard pay every customer service based company, enforce it. don't. point ""OK good. Oh wait there's variant. Oh ok vaccine effective. Oh one? Everybody back square one"" kind alarmist point view starting sound like garbage.

Somebody explained day cases israel werent indicating vaccine isnt effective.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  UK rising cases delta month. 

29th June. 7 day average 17,616 cases 17 deaths.

Last time number cases rising wave 11th December. 17,003 cases 413 deaths.

October 19th 17,646 cases 122 deaths. since I’m vaccinated, Delta probably going mess badly catch it. could cause carrier, infect someone else. wouldn’t really disaster person vaxed also. Problem is, lots people aren’t vaxed. Young kids, instance, though statistically appears they’ve always low chances serious symptoms. adults who’ve access months prohibiting conditions, yet still refuse get variety bullshit reasons.

So basically, sounds like vaccinated people asked put masks back largely order protect COULD get vaccinated decided don’t wanna.

Not suggest wearing mask huge hardship. It’s really big deal all. I’m impression I’m asked mostly order accommodate whims bunch fucking morons. That's Belgium though. comparison countries. Despite worry delta variants variants thereafter, safe say worst pandemic well behind us? e    4    Maybe due sites like show Rt passing 1.0 now? Next stop return social distancing lockdowns? unvaccinated vector potentially allow COVID spread mutate. can’t get vaccinated due medical reasons, fine. Otherwise, consequences. Could insurance hit, lack access restaurants certain venues, restricted travel, whatever. supposed know traveling meeting new exciting variants would bad idea?   going common theme next year. guess bleach fear mongering stopped effective. offered one make *an individual* choice take that's entirely *an individual*.

I fail see what's racist that. Eh, I’ve done part, worn mask, gotten shots, I’ll get booster needed. However, thing I’m gonna collection masks turn blanket lol know would great could guarantee unvaccinated infect innocent people since that's works... Nope Buzzfeed News, electrolytes feel bad people genuinely can't get vaccinated lead long term heart problems,

How make claim vaccine available 1 year? MRNA vaccine trial patients really reported long term issues far. data back claim? 30 minutes seems like way fast feel effects vaccine.

Anxiety depression cause people lose smell taste. I've seen talk twitter doctors actually recommending it, largely depend pharmacist doctor get guidance CDC/FDA come out. might want call ahead ask showing up.  thought calling crazy unfriending enough. mean worked well politics. Um. talking fact ita getting bad out. Thats whats sad. getting defensive? plan People already know RNA behaves. like found random alien substance Mars, noticed prevented Covid, injected everyone. don’t agree things say would say it’s different visions situation, probably due cultures. 
We coming different points thus, getting different conclusions.
I respect opinion tho, think it’s valid.

And yeah... people getting vaccinated seems problem everywhere, hope doesn’t gets worse. someone suppressed immune system due autoimmune treatment, thank you. I’m still wearing mask indoors family. also seven year old, rest us vaccinated. It’s weird careful almost everyone around us stopped. There’s also people like multiple vaccine allergies refused vaccine it. can’t help body doesn’t accept vaccines nearly killed me. take right precautions wear mask, make others around mask come office (which looks next week won’t concern, I’m going back WFH yay!) order meal delivery kits grocery delivery, take restaurant food, etc know can’t vaccinated. family vaccinated help avoid exposure home. sucks categorized anti vax category I’m anti vax, I’m anti vax advice health care providers  look literally post, masks aren’t protection people anymore, it’s identity thing. I’m seeing “baby, idiot, whiner” etc…
In US epitome privilege, go store country get best body shield covid available. famous Typhoid Mary barmaid? vaccinated back April, got Pfizer. past days, I’ve felt like bit dry mouth, it’s annoying big issue. Yesterday, felt stiff could hardly move, today, it’s little better, feel extremely tired don’t lot energy. likely something else, try get covid test? Basically lol, TASS ASS  I’m confused 

We’re wearing masks vaccine refusal means we’re struggling reach controllable threshold community immunity/control, least US. 

The transmissible prominent disease is, higher threshold gets.

Millions kids 12 (who ***can’t*** yet vaccinated) also pools unmitigated transmission variants concern, adults ***really*** need get dang jabs, like, weeks ago. delta variant higher circulation though threat younger people.  I'm 500% sure he's gay say 'day-tah'. What's proper way say it? Therapist here. can't bill ""need mask-wearing pandemic"" managed care. would worth private pay. sure heck bill personality disorders problem others wearing masks. Wonder many accept vaccine, poor results, regret taking it. Curious wondering vaccine effective side effects vaccine. Hopefully sickness mild go away soon. follow logic this,. unfortunately think view share. Adults expected semblance responsible-behavior critical-thinking. Even someone ""wasn't ever taught"".. least awareness say:.. ""Hey, maybe I'm expert read learn factual information making decision."" 

I see type ignorance-patterns happen /r/techsupport forums. someone clearly understand technical problem they're having,.. try help them,. keep ignoring (or actively refusing accept advice). 

I went round round 1 crazy guy past week.. convinced ""his iPhone hacked!"".. even example example example showed not. adamantly (and stubbornly) convinced ""he hacked"" accept information explanation. That's ""innocent ignorance"".. ""active refusal"". 

People like shamed. Iceland, Hungary, Netherlands, Finland, Denmark Italy too. vaccination EU/EEA finally seems ok level. Ahh ok thanks sounds cool fun anti-vax part. definitely entitled level risk aversion. I’m sorry waiting zero. That’s likely happen, you’re building personality around this, you’re making miserable process. can’t get vaccine, either medical condition due age? continue wear mask vaccination…I don’t want risk losing sense smell taste. sounds like sad life. I’ll wear mask decrease risk even more. Also acne..I like able cover face without people questioning me. wonders confidence public. Leave one car! Wear least even need take want (seems risky though!)

Seems value brain can't really simple thing... research scientist, following published findings are. quote offered CDC, know whole lot do.

Mask wearing among fully vaccinated people necessary. one going unvaccinated people, clearly different scenario. Thankfully, choose associate people follow science. That's percentages work; people vaccinated certain areas, like cities, highly vaxxed area, far fewer people wearing masked. rural PA, way people wearing masks. Ok scientist actually pretty cool. fluorescent tags far bulky use manor.  True. Im Texas thing happened large cities. rural areas never really wore begin with, People larger urban areas kept wearing masks months weren’t required, last month it’s decreased rapidly. last week I’ve noticed signs business doors almost disappeared. context, California 13x population Mississippi. make sense use raw numbers comparing states massively different population.  all, isn’t little Uter us? vaccine nothing like vaccines. There’s reason people things do. point view. need know better people. don’t know anyone 12 hasn’t vaccinated. course going see someone pointing fallacy, comparison ridiculous terms takes someone using mask versus staying forever house.
Well, don’t think it’s worth keep arguing you, going get agreement, I’ve already said think odds costs using mask another comment. Ha! Eat shit.  Hopefully so. He’s felt sick week. missing broader point. mask itself, represents: *vaccines* good enough, *nothing* good enough.

People asked put lives hold year half counting basically saying ""well never really life back"". what’s holdback ensure new “variants” won’t lead excuses new restrictions? fully supportive restrictions prior vaccine availability. Time move though. idiots understand consequences actions see cost it.

Selfish idiots hard teach behave society think anyone themselves. added think continuing mask indoors smart. brother’s wife never stopped masking. She’s negative. Yes, going make fun ""careful"" risk assessment clearly irrational.

Advocating masks fully vaccinated people irrational. way rationally unless careful mitigate risk every possible area life injury death even miniscule possibility. 

If explain make sense wear helmet outside riding car risk brain injury death larger risk negative COVID effects young, fully vaccinated person I'm ears.

Until then, yes I'm going make fun people irrational things ""safety"", I'd make fun wrapped bubble wrap. guy know math. know vaccination trending seven day average.

If graph could see trending upwards downward. 

If remember numbers, slowly decreasing. probably August 100k new shots day. Mostly, people refusing vaccine decide take someone close gets covid. Getting kn94 masks life changer me. work medical field wear one day, 10 hours. Kn94s comfortable. Uh, yeah. really wish would pushed hard ""Stay home save lives!"" (were forced to) sacrificed lot past year protect vulnerable. sacrifice matched effort eat better, get shape, lose weight. Bonus: help mitigate covid, practically everything else! Oh, vaccines still work, never implied otherwise. see things mainly affect using mask affect others (I’m thinking asymptomatic people, guess that’s specific).

That’s valid true point, don’t feel applies US vaccine readily available free. us vaccinated responsible protecting health don’t even care try protect themselves? difference make wearing mask public probably 100 times lower difference unvaccinated person make getting vaccinated. everyone gotten vaccine opportunity so, covid would steadily progressing towards eradication.


Edit: clear. feel sick, wear mask, asymptotic vaccinated spread something concern with. we've last 18 months (and virus) think lot people traumatized. Call collective case PTSD. takes time get that. takes time feel safe again. now, pretty much thing move Covid. remember, though, even seeing articles people denying hospital bed never know far gone are. Fools learn mistakes; wise men learn others'.  me,my mom,and house maid got AZ 3,5 weeks ago..felt like absolute shit 2 days..and thats it...i ate like mofos,gain 1 pound,and drink lots water..

and im good...

will get 2nd shot september..hope everything goes well.. weird cranky rant acknowledges one age 12 (10s millions Americans) get vaccine yet, hundreds thousands immune compromised Americans exist, time lets us know stopped caring them.

We’re frustrated anti-vaxers, vaccine hesitant, Covid deniers, etc.  time we’re going stuck cost hospital bills, cost society, impact sickness death health care workers, communities, basically everyone around let Covid replicate completely control.  won’t find anyone medical medical research professions ever advocate that.

As easy say “Fzck you, got mine!”, it’s never right move.  Absolutely true. Exactly, that's side coin.

""Unfortunately, enough people good thing.""

""Fortunately, direct control whether good thing."" get vaccine, SUPPOSED REST PRACTICE COMBAT!
What dumb society live in. said feels like flu chest tight. issue people refusing get vaccine reason. 

There's reasons. might agree reasoning them. probably look worst case scenarios people double vaxxed still got Delta think common place. perhaps read “bad news” vaccines like “big” scare J&amp;J made distribution place switch Pfizer. It’s tiring people deny deny deny hits personally body, friend, loved one. I’m certain it’s contributed 500k deaths states defiant type mitigation.

It’s sad stupid stuff like this, climate change, anything else essentially business debate over. link please Yep, confirmed CDC yet again, important repeat forever mask people vaccinated person currently traveling internationally... there's good chance people country visiting, despite infections still high vaccinated % low, probably ignore mask mandates country place. experience Balkans, Georgia Ukraine. Russia, course, considered anti-woke cool refuse wear mask (perhaps 1st wave never really ended).  


It leaves weird feeling. Like, clearly either believe COVID fake, masks work... vaccines dangerous, above. I'm talking like 90% population, 50% like US. Hospitals like using lot expensive regular staff RNs

This false. I've already posted why. Contract employees, despite higher wage, incurr additional *costs* FTEs do. Things like healthcare, retirement, etc. add high 30-50% person's hourly rate and/or salary.

You claimed worked HR, true would know case. I'm done masks. I'm fully vaccinated, working full time building without air conditioning. Unbelievable. Someone earlier went needing therapy wanting continue wear mask.

Like need therapy that, I'm sick live country filled selfish assholes think funny throw mental health faces people still wear mask store. Damn dude kids post 50! google Germany, 54.08 percent people vaccinated coronavirus least once.

In US 53.80 percent.

---

In US, around 47 percent already considered fully vaccinated.

In Germany 36 percent.  Makes sense. 

About 92% people America mRNA vaccine shown almost effective Delta rest variants.

For US - Delta unvaccainated person issue  people vaccinated want suffer either asking protection. author article, presumably well, wants everything reopen restrictions lifted, exactly people vaccinated asking for. Yup think might one still wears mask. definitely pariah grocery store, etc. make people wear come office too. Idgaf there’s mask mandate ends I’m taking chances also live Asia yeah people sick masks wear long time continuously. don’t wear feel ill also certain seasons uptick allergens (like Japanese cedar pollens) many masks also designed filter pm2.5 dusts pollens. Yes, entire article overstates success, long throw word 'may' sentence. Infections complex, viral infections especially so, colour sceptical anything near claiming. Yeah people don’t work blue collar really take granted much obstruction mask be. It’s also become competitive companies around us lifted mask mandates sooner use recruit associates. need real consequences decision wilfully unvaccinated.

Get rid free COVID medical care unvaccinated

Get rid eviction protection unvaccinated

Get rid enhanced unemployment benefits unvaccinated Probably something random doctor said radio show. CDC director said vaccinated people “safe” delta variant don’t need wear mask way us know. Get test find give peace mind, they’re free. And/or talk doctor. vaccines end masking, is? still lower chance myocarditis getting COVID. So, COVID endemic herd immunity, young people get COVID one day everyone vaccinated continues spread. think people severely underestimate risks getting COVID. Something contagious widespread get everyone (at point) since going keep social distancing measures forever.

If that's case, really vaccine lowering risk myocarditis relative face get COVID.

&amp;#x200B;

This also pitching vaccine individual solution. actuality, individual risks measured relative societal community risks COVID. terms, individual risks worth relative reaching herd immunity. think that's tough one many consider still important remember.

NYC one favorite cities EVER. crazy amount awesome (very) packed space. Love energy, food, culture, hearing many different languages, oh yeah…there one two cool things see one visits. ;)  thing is, get COVID things worse. sad say never really going safe. Viruses dangerous. Vaccines side effects. tragedy. COVID always dangerous vaccine, worth get vaccine control existing people spreading it.  let’s contextualize this: MMR shot you’re age 35, immunity measles likely diminished. (I found get titers drawn grad school bc couldn’t find childhood immunization records parents dead. still protected mumps rubella, measles. Apparently common.)

Measles (is?) joke. Older ppl like indeed die it, though far less likelihood Covid sure.

Are going living differently likely susceptibility measles, it’s zero? 

Come on. advocating government forcefully vaccinate people like China? become one stupid die off. Placebo effect one hell drug Right, since UK population 99% fatality risk something like fully vaccinated. Probably way drive number deaths UK reducing case load, going happen anytime soon. really ""negative"" news. Heart inflammation resolves NSAIDS way better throwing clot taking AZ. Definitely researched severe enough warrant concern.

I wish VITT talked more. uncle got Pfizer. Went ER noticed blotchy spots tongue turned platelet count dangerously low (~50k). Masks cost nothing, young people, teens kids chance fully vaccinated can't yet vaccinated want covid risk long covid either. really sort “you don’t get conversation”. Still wearing mask vaccinated makes giant baby. don’t trust science? anti-vaxxer? Kim Jong Un angry N Korea's COVID response none social distancing wearing masks. Oh irony Totally. ignore happened January 6, go away. certainly never happen again. “Go see general practitioner” “dismissing symptoms anxiety” [And 10 years gotta seem like $1500~$6000+ cost worth mostly changing do.

And think much done shower.  Considering current ""fight government"" climate includes ""I take rushed vaccine like gubment wants, sheeple"", pretty clear ""fight government"" mindless nonsense.

Here's thought: want another shutdown, take vaccines (if medically able), wear masks, socially distance 10 feet (rather reduced advisements due public pressure). words, stop plague rats, thus hovering spread mutation plague, thus getting us regress messed 'normal' y'all want. ✌️ looks great 60 Covid People idiots. something watch panic. great majority cases resolves cases needed hospital monitoring. lasting damage. 

This vastly different situation blood disorder AZ vaccine, requires specialized diagnosis treatment might lead lasting damage death. Two things:

1. vaccine community protection
2. low case count mean always way. COVID endemic unvaccinated, get one day. point, risk myocarditis higher getting vaccinated. think biggest issue folks think avoid getting COVID long term. endemic incredibly contagious levels vaccine hesitancy around world, can't rely young people opting out. get herd immunity young folks (yourself included) get COVID face even higher chance myocarditis took vaccine first place.  addition nots, vaxed vaxed nots.

Be vaxed! agree. millions (myself included) followed rules part getting vaccine. tell wear mask protect people didn’t get vaccine (and still won’t wear mask)… fuck right know causes worse heart inflammation sure? COVID. understand risks important know about, vaccine worth two choices: Get vaccinated raw dog exposure COVID. luxury weighing options situation. vaccine bad immune response viruses virus fragments bad you. guess what, immune system tools have. can't consciously kill thus virus. gotta give bodies chance protect us bodies able perfectly. things sucks ass anyone thinks getting unscathed, sadly mistaken. pandemic ultimately win coronavirus stay. either Ashish Jha Scott Gottlieb pointed vast majority breakthrough delta cases asymptomatic mild. 

As someone who's already Covid Pfizer doses down, going take lot convince there's reason mask again. way UK counts Covid death may overstate UK Covid deaths

It doesn't, underestimates deaths. Deaths counts based what's reported death certificates consistently higher daily counts. people missed 28 day method accidently included.  go knowingly deadly disease, deserve book thrown you.  mask save vaccine didn't. 

See works? May live long life that’s always diminished way ignorance. conservative mindset lot time unfortunately. know lack empathy what, things seem ""real"" happen them. could forget Belgium! live 200m Belgium! Aren’t supposed identical produced different facilities? Isn’t bit, ahem, weird chose approve kind that’s available certain set countries? Couldn’t spend little time study production locations batch approve them?  Belgium too. couple weeks behind US, EU countries end higher. No, defected family would imprisoned maybe executed. go back them. Talk doctor rather guessing. able give best advice risk vaccine. Still nowhere near case Ireland, Nordics Spain. remember reading something like last year. Hopefully bring something market. Based data, Germany's first dose still good numbers. US need find way vaccinate southern states. honestly people calling terrible person stated different thread group know walk stores without mask.

When someone told don’t care kids immune compromised people merely asked they’d get pissed parent following protocols regarding kid wearing mask rather literally following science cdc guidelines regarding masks fully vaccinated.

I swear. 2020 created subsection people view vaccinated people don’t wear mask different antivaxxers really wholesome Life balance risk.

Those fully vaccinated infintensimal risk serious complications virus. individual need make choices manage risk.

At point, life needs go back normal want exercize right wilfully unvaccinated, country needs allow right suffer consequences without safety net, including giant medical bill if/when need treatment.  come back, don’t worry. People like things like theatre, dancing music roaring 20s soon here. Worked there

Did really Union health family welfare ministry Monday revised Covid-19 treatment guidelines removed use ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, antiviral drug favipiravir list advised  would rather injected Covid one vaccines. point, kind feel like insurance stop paying covid+ people refused get vaccinated US, unless really, really good medical reason get it. see rest us non-boneheads need subsidize reckless stupidity. thing is, things back normal, get COVID vaccinated. really question when. endemic enough vaccinated, simple get COVID one point unless social distance forever happening.

I think problem people think higher chance getting myocarditis COVID, believe chance getting COVID small. comparison, getting vaccine means ""rolled dice"" comparing risks properly underestimating chance getting COVID.

Also, vaccine really individual much community protecting us all. talking bunch females addition myself, yes periods regularly arent, well, regular. **stress** huge factor shifting cycle. seems likely, anecdotals quite females, combination stress body working hard deal vaccine thing--which supposed do!--caused period changes.

I constantly stressed due anxiety, cycle rarely ""normal,"" even notice anything norm. another not-exactly regular month! ""The part money governments — particularly U.S. government — invested vaccines could fast-tracked, said Anna Durbin, vaccine researcher Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School Public Health.

Operation Warp Speed, pushed Trump administration deserves credit gets this. mostly bullshit shared Facebook Yeah ita scary rhe delta variant already agree healthcare field deal shitty people.my mom would always story tell CNA. im really thankful all. Try keep head get burned try stay safe. takes someone using mask versus staying forever house

Oh look, slowly coming realization *what comparison is* real-time! Wow, glad could help learn something today. use, too: consideration estimate similarities dissimilarities two things people.

Since seem almost *intentionally* obtuse, let explain point extremely plain words: 

For vaccinated people, masks almost literally nothing vaccine already doing. original post thread extreme rarities avoided. **MY POINT WAS** (pay attention part!), taking precautionary actions accomplish, again, *almost literally nothing*, absolutely *infinitesimal* chance something bad happening, risk-aversion level roof may well wrap packing foam rest life.....*lest fall scrape knee*!!!!!! get positive December, I’m getting tested today. lost shit lost sense smell taste last night. Biggest indicator covid.  Logic &amp; science dictates would still try protect people can’t get vaccines, anyone age 12. Wearing mask post vaccination obvious.  Looking graph article, vaccination number still steadily going Germany. flattening curve yet like USA. Fyi music festivals already happening again, good one tickets rescheduled September. 

I highly doubt they’re gonna get every single wook wear mask. Especially constant need share bumps ketamine whatnot lol.

I’m gonna go good time, thousands people. Im even trump anti vax nutjob, someone vaccinated decided it’s time get back real life! shits nonstop depressing me, know im excited festy’s plenty folks. great time bring 1000's people almost every country planet.. Covid twice plus vaccine? get positive covid tests times? There's something called contact tracing.

You absolutely can. put another way, 10.5 percent world's population fully vaccinated COVID-19. folks live first world countries. Many folks can't lock since need work day eat. Suffice say lot world, perhaps even majority it, worst pandemic continue bad lack access vaccines well transmissible variant Delta. Yes. Key word: uncomfortable.

But living horrible pandemic, know. PA 49.5 percent vaccinated. 

Does account many people got vaccines states PA lagging far behind early vaccine availability? guess that's true, would work lot people. gotta anything can. feel like hush hush thing going Biden admin quite honestly similar opinion WHO. won’t remove funding like Trump did. they’re also basically fully dismissing recommendations delta variant per Fauci’s words last time heard someone die serious complications getting vaccine


That's bad argument make people died vaccines. convincing argument far far far likely die Covid. USA can’t go backward masks. People wouldn’t stand it. don’t mean usual “no mask” crowd.

Some Areas, like live, people still wear masks places like groceries. it’s gonna impossible enforce type mandate It’s mask find uncomfortable day wear—it’s breathing hot steam day. I’m teacher NYC, also wear one day. KN94s prevent hot steam breath? mean, least it’s getting reported. Half US we’re talking here. country isn’t going function half getting COVID, doesn’t matter *why* they’re getting COVID.

“Screw guys” isn’t *plan* it’s abdication leadership. first dose side effects. covid December symptoms loss taste smell. time feel like shit. fast recovery last time hoping best.

Sure. also risk get hit car walking across street, force everyone wear helmets time leave house. 

If even small risk, take precaution?

Risk mitigation strategies proportional actual risk. heads! someone got shot better find gun charge all. irresponsible say &amp; without also pointing **vaccines drastically reduce asymptomatic infection &amp; transmission** chest pain day second shot fine play sports regularly
Does mean don’t know it? Unfortunately really matters everyone that. NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said Wednesday morning unsure nurse vaccinated, however, Guardian Australia since learned student nurse vaccinated. prove individual cause?  lol, bought mask indigenous woman city (Manaus), cool looking internacional news. goal convincing vaccine hesitant get vaccinated. CDC Governors even HINT reinstating mask mandates restrictions, goal goes right window. 

""Why get obviously work? See they're still trying make us mask even vaccinated, proves work!""

At point game over.  bashing snake oil mean want covid continue, means want people lied looks way like dad Seatbelts would apt comparison likely scenario catching covid gruesome death. not. vaccines equivalent someone tap rear bumper spilled bit coffee yourself. first all, required smart wise order able learn people's experiences. cut many many people immediately.

then, even wise, need person gives freck something hits head. cut many again.

finally, get lot downvotes stating obvious things: people idiots. covid, flat earth, human values etc etc. really are. them, many. idiots rather loud.

and it. Lmao asked bullshit someone said vaccines conveyed immunity better natural infection. talking general vaccines theorizing Covid vaccine would same. premise bullshit, also raises doubts assuming natural infection would convey protection.

As far SARS2, it’s brand new virus brand new vaccines we’re still learning natural vaccine induced immunity. re-infections people got Covid infections people got vaccinated, unfortunately neither confers sterilizing immunity. Science takes time, nature establishing much immunity someone re-infection takes even time. [Here’s article Miami Herald goes subject lot links current troll? skeptical 

You skeptical. bent insisting right, evidence contrary. Reminiscent anti-vaxxer, actually. ""After single dose 14% absolute reduction vaccine effectiveness symptomatic disease Delta compared Alpha, smaller 10% reduction effectiveness 2 doses (Table 8)""

Vaccine effectiveness versus hospitalization:

 * Alpha (dose 1): 78% (95% CI 64-87)
 * Delta (dose 1): 80% (95% CI Wtf people weird punishment culture?  pro vax science countries?

What them? point irrelevant doesn’t make sense, idc countries do, plan atm go outside US, thus it’s irrelevant me. short: Shit's fucked right now, sure fix it

The TL;DR socialism. Understanding intersectionality key understanding answer socialism. work kids think got Ever worn one 16 hours making corrugated boxes 95F temperatures 85% humidity? Masking major inconvenience depending situation. honestly believe governments don’t mandate vaccines mandate everyone stay home protect refuse protect themselves?

I think obviously wrong take.

Vaccines still highly effective variants, see UK—despite high levels infection—will dropping restrictions broken link cases hospitalization. Mom literally recovering pneumonia right now. Talked scary terrible able breathe. STILL refusing Covid vaccine. Darwin-awards planet, it. proving point. vaccinated far unlikely catch spread covid, odds mutating within vaccinated person much lower. biggest problem unable get vaccine yet, able yet refuse. proving even smart people make bad decisions. think recommendation. says article avoiding mandate restrictions “not cause disruptions”. Probably red areas primarily rural areas state rather cities - thus, away hospitals amenities - political affiliation Or, humor here, could nod agree, walk away, dismiss dumbfuckery that. amount jamming ANYTHING faces going change minds. 

You're making angry frustrated. that's ok you, means, go it. I'm suggesting maybe wasting rage directing people are--body, soul, brain--made rubber. paused US week.  makes sense though protected sooner less efficiency waiting efficiency longer time protected? aunt won’t get family. don’t think anything trump per se rather Far right conspiracy news ( call news ) it’s mentality it’s flu. found strange people hits like bad cold sinus infection others get completely wrecked. I’ve two neighbors die COVID including next door neighbor.   80% effective exposure instead one exposed 5 people active delta infections, one statistically infect you? public facing workers unvaccinated children family members 2nd one seems far acceptable risk. technology have, everyone able vote anything. Maybe actually control passing, give lawmakers actual picture people want.  key word emotions mandate.

Children still able vaccinated. 

There still consequences wearing masks spreading virus.

But government knows can't ENFORCE **mandates** politically. That's point. keep wearing masks frankly painless way help Americans kind fixation kind psychological oppression. seriously care automod triggered? Holy shit go outside (with mask) Exactly. Covid isn’t ever going eradicated, live it. vaccine supposed prevent severe illness completely prevent infection. done cute idea talk deciding cover covid related health costs someone could avoided road really want go down.

""Fat? Sorry, ate healthy. let lazy part consequence."" 

""STI? provide proof condom safe sex usage? otherwise responsible preventable disease have.""

""Motorcycle accident? Sorry, car. Pay up.""

This la carte idea defeats whole purpose insurance.

Also, idea people going sigh pay hundreds thousands dollars worth medical bills ridiculous. kids, talking cousin life insurance asked bothered since nothing matters dead. said family. used think asking feeling embarrassed I'd even ask question. seeing many people consider continued risk children immunocompromised think maybe sort self-centeredness innate people. think things context. fuck.these.people. Well millions people need catch regret fact. Problem solved, right? Well said. Ironically, survival fittest playing out. Mental fitness, ability adapt changing circumstances, chances surviving infection play. There’s lot speculation scenarios new variant infect people in, actually happened original version virus too. lot speculation wrong (eg fomite transmission, outdoor transmission uncrowded areas), need see hard data I’ll accept realistic scenario. Also want know funny fact? country outdoors mandate lifted almost nobody seen without mask. Among us dont wear outdoors, proportion people shape much much higher proportion people shape among whole population, includes middle aged elderly people dont wear it.

Makes suspect muh safety excuse Mr. Moonfaces glad staying shape isnt visually punishing mask. Ah, good luck! Yeah CDC came guidance lot masks came knew percent vaccinated. treat everyone unvaccinated unless know personally. Wait, little evidence 3-year-old wearing mask protects *her* all? Especially given doubt 3-year olds wearing fit-tested N-95s? 

The reason wear mask protect others you, probably apply much daughter. Chinese vaccines then? point, it’s hard care anyone get vaccinated, chooses to. Ok says opposite. going listen to, CDC, shifts goalposts keep calm, carry manner it’s late, every time? People stopping world mild even moderate symptoms. might wear mask grocery store though, unless there's habit so, might change habits mild symptoms. else confused ? Rational behavior:

People vaccinated want wear masks = cool

People vaccinated want wear masks= cool

Irrational behavior:

People want get vaccinated want wear masks = cool

""And said, supposing brought light inside body, either skin way. think said going test too. Sounds interesting,"" president continued.""

Trump fucking nutjob purposefully sends mixed messages can, time, control minions yet leave avenues wriggle responsibility. disgusting say least. He's cancer. keeping 25% unwanted stock? Why? Cases only...the hospitalizations deaths remained low entire time...in words vaccines working. love country divisions... Please, government entities need get page settle guideline public health. Well, wonder ever get US arms.  guess I've labeled Incivil...

This problem world right now. Lots countries also relaxing dropping mask mandates, restrictions, even Delta present. Again, children exposing children age 12? That's currently biggest worry I've got niece nephew, 3 5 respectfully well means own. catch virus ""elsewhere"" Australia, virus elsewhere.

Like, *possible* someone else cluster - even transmission chains confirmed genomic surveillance, somehow need pass old paternity test too. Odds that, *and* contact tracers missing low. go cheap guilt trip argument. kids   turns out.... vaccine works ""shocked pikachu face"" really wild believe another country could surpass us anything? 

Americentrism hell drug. ""Like cant must alien.""

$$$$$GIMMIE-DAT-MONEY-HONEY$$$$$$ I'm ""generally"" going either, except, said, ""dense indoor areas"".

FWIW, want flu either, let alone Covid. reason inhaling stranger spittle, general. That's countries like Japan better manners (ailing folks wear masks stay home courtesy).  That’s super specific question doubt anyone would know long time. 
What know Covid infection unlikely lead serious symptoms kids. Children *have* gotten seriously ill even died it, tiny fraction rate in, say, 80+ crowd. 
The biggest concern children potential vector catching spreading at-risk older adults home. Theoretically, every single adult vaccinated virus hopped around under-12 year olds, would considered big health risk. I’m hoping flu cold season stigma country gone people feel comfortable wearing Fair enough! think problem people see guidelines world mostly unvaccinated vs. US we're shabby. Well CDC disagrees... Keep sunglasses indoors, they’re eye covering equivalent cloth mask “I got mine” analogy. eligible adults access months now. That’s frustration comes people hear new restrictions due unvaccinated. report avoidable near death experience fear mongering. difference reason necessity... still decent portion can't get vaccinated, nothing bad choosing lower risk others long term effects infections young people arent known insurance hit

Literally time I've ever looked US healthcare system gone ""you know what, that's improvement free healthcare"".

Screw anti-vaxxers, man. Moderna Like sewer people I’m still going wear mask.


 seeing fully grown adults throw temper tantrums wear mask faith people dropped tremendously. put past “the mask= tyranny” crowd lie vaccination status.  often talk effective hospitalization serious disease. seen numbers asymptomatic mild disease. Even mild asymptomatic cases spread others, masking indoors makes sense slow spread know COVID. I’m completely mask thing. think it’s important people stop saying decisions whether masks worn based ‘science’. 

Whether people wearing masks value judgement, scientific discovery. It’s like could run experiment results would tell whether wearing masks not.

Science tell us effects wearing masks transmission COVID19. take results make value judgement whether benefits wearing mask outweigh costs wearing them. 

That decision, certainly informed science, science.

People need stop throwing vague statements ‘science’ around order bolster opinion tear others’    Ah, crossed wires - given comment replying thought talking UK.  shudder think happen actual vaccine escape variant arrives (which Delta not).

No one really seems plan this, even could reimpose sweeping restrictions, restrictions need public buy-in (even dictatorships) level compliance got last year based new disease unknown risk profile vaccine. even get much compliance later year, let alone now, even much less effective vaccine would lower people's personal risk.

People government health often saying we'll need learn live like disease, think plan beyond hoping vaccines reduce cases miniscule levels. wife fully vaxed living life close normal CO. I'm worried two young kids (under 5 yo). impatiently waiting FDA/CDC/whomever approve use COVID vaccine young kids, I'll feel 100% safe. Lol believe evolution, doctorate good university, I’m young healthy thus choosing take vaccine. what’s problem? Delta issue areas low rates vaccination. Full stop. False positives Apparently passing. Delta plus though. shamed wearing mask fully vaccinated, choose choosing emotions science necessarily. mask still lowers risk, bother you, wear it. necessary right now, useless  mean what’s problem? Shouldn’t allow people make choice? That’s vaccines work right, doesn’t matter anyone else got long you’re immune. turn tribalism issue?  Nah, he's probably waiting numbers increase never high vaccination rates fine man, don’t scared reality. hospitals overwhelmed? people dying? standards It’s going mutate people vaccinated too. Don’t daft think won’t. There’s going thousands different forms virus, people going accept get life Citation Restaurants bars would risky places tho.
People like talk socialize places.

When go grocery stores, barely talk I’m pretty much. emotion prioritizing perceived moral superiority choice, science presents rational. contagious Delta variant? Like quickly catch outside masks vaccinated? unvaccinated toddlers? Uptake UK seems good indeed, think end Benelux, Nordics, Ireland, Spain Portugal end similar levels. Willingness get vaccinated crazy high. Luckily there’s something easier getting vaccination. Eat less calories. dies stops growing, opinion. like WoW many huge-scale multiplayer games, new players reach takes long level anyone who's already part scene feels like outsider dedicate like year it. like WoW, current playerbase elitist enough drive new players culture, too. least that's experience. guess attitude may different places trends permeate slowly stick around longer. gives away it’s nothing “personal choice” everything wanting reminded give shit people. That’s true, 3 layer cloth masks reduce risk infection (the level protection isn’t either 0% 100%, anything between), combined someone fully vaccinated that’s going significant reduction already low risk  PLEASE love god get actual studies rather politicians saying random shit conflicting other? asking continually wear mask 

I not. Never asked so. **second** time pretending said unless want start forced vaccinations that's gonna change. need accept fact

1. that's gonna change, need accept back status-quo.
2. would need forced vaccinations change? already mentioned, many ways either incentivize it, improve communication topic make general public willing accept them, all. probably varies individual fall spectrum flouted rules along who've lived like hermits. near hermits waiting weeks longer better protection going big deal. could easily issue recommendations conditional ""the entire country this."" as, ""in counties less 70% vaccination, mask mandates apply"". Except time obvious side right Israel targeting Zero Covid imo. sympathy! Screw everyone like him. Ignorance stupidity going cause another wave infections/mutations continue look way accommodate selfish folks like guy end lock again. Saying nothing harm cause others. Im done selfish, stupid, LOUD people. DONE!! careful, using sound logic...😏 Depends. place says need wear mask need respect that. told wear shoes shirt. Americans blood hands would say care wearing them, find scratchy uncomfortable vaccinated. nice day.  entire state 7(?) local cases year.

We good controls, generally keep high success - vaccines though, delta making things harder. Either way, necessarily knuckleheads all. understand it, issue vaccinated people safe. problem asymptomatic transfer.

Please correct misunderstood Problem everything, even close - 6 nonsense stories repeat day, none matter. right here. sick almost 2 years, I'm keeping regimen good. Mask crowded places whenever I'm around someone sick. Chief Health Officer Dr. Kerry Chant told 7 News asymptomatic guest unknowingly spread virus throughout party. six guests vaccinated, it’s possible infection rate party could Chant said infected partygoers isolating tested.


I'd interested know showing symptoms.

Also, understanding vaccine stop catching virus, rather allowing body understand fight therefore mitigating symptoms, any. story claiming PCR test find traces virus vaccinated group? Still wearing mask. take much illness take someone age. areas like mine, almost one wants vax mask, work. lot us.

You probably stressful type job pandemic. think retail job scary, stop think healthcare workers. wear helmet driving? I'm not, basically lie. COVID still circulating US continue long vaccination rates bad states. still catch Delta variant vaccinated - like 1/20 chance, basically, exposed.

As long Delta circulating US, small number people vaccinated catch die. much, much larger unvaccinated people catch die. point ""safe"" vaccinated, even chance infection + death low.

I mind average person made statement director CDC pretty irresponsible. ask chosen disagree particular piece CDC recommendations vaccinated people masks?  Hes showing leadership??? definition, mean he's providing prime example do, therefore even reason get lazy ass go sit 10 seconds free shot could save hundreds thousands lives??

They literally use every excuse book, point contradicting themselves, get it.

I get it... solidarity us stuck amongst people getting vaccinated, continue take stringent measures due this. 

Though personally least Southern bubble metro started say F-it, I'm vaxxed ready go maskless settings still offer larger space spread (even indoors). know odds Olympics cancelled delayed point close 0% variety reasons, really never gotten far. Road trips necessary.

I mean, point getting pretty touchy territory necessary. Kids going school necessary? every parent capable homeschooling. handful actions driving ‘necessary’ children

Okay admit driving necessary. zero situations wearing mask necessity unless one very, people legitimate exemption. 

Again, totally missing mark point discussion. Yeah, people things put kids risk. one's denying that. also plenty things mitigate risks presented children. Wearing mask around children way mitigate risk. different putting car seat giving life jacket. way making risky things less risky. Oh. LOL. I'm part problem. thought workers wore masks interact people potentially exposed virus due probability. documentation country showing received vaccination? personally im tired bullshitted. I'll keep wearing mask long term things settle. saying amount vaccinations administered nothing diminish link factor hospitalisations deaths increase compared cases? US March comparable sense UK today. 

Wales furthest ahead vaccinations, it’s recording high cases nearly 3-4 weeks week 0 deaths  Exactly. I'll put mask crowded spaces, gym, that's it. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

I'm honestly asking, end this.  beginning, supply shortages know much asymptomatic transmission played equation. See, that's science works. 

""There yet evidence masks work"" totally different message ""masks work"".

The scientific method great, works retrospect. took first parachute jump, evidence free-fall parachuting worked, wore parachute anyway though beat alternative (and right). conducted experiment, would still evidence free-fall parachuting possible, would still people saying therefore *impossible*, that's misunderstanding science worked since scientific method invented. 

If people want wear masks, let wear masks. costs harms small, really matter much benefits also small. new vaccines development new different methods what's currently out?

The reason wondering many people asymptomatic, disease barely affects them. hope someone somewhere looking different seemingly immune people people suffer hard disease.

If could find is, assuming simple matter age, general health body condition, try find way replicate humans. 

Is simplistic viable? question exactly. Mask staying One people whine trivial bullshit. Wearing mask point time smart compassionate. Delta variant might indeed problem lot people. Best cautious minimal sacrifice  wouldn’t. You’re talking ass. 25% fucking terrible, might well wear one.

No way masks reduce transmission 25%. would mean delta variant R 6 R would 4.5, basically useless preventing continuous spread virus. Death would preferable. Caught covid first wave, laid 3 weeks. Like said, that’s impossible. couple months ""a couple months""...and couple months be....

I'm brimming solidarity people choosing keep risk, personally Never heard one before. /s problem wearing cloth mask mostly helps protect people you, versus helping protect others.

We're banking health *mostly* hoping protection actually gives wearer enough. Exactly thoughts. super moronic move hope backfire.  know sure? No. anecdotally, one time guy hacking behind entire flight ... two days later -- vacation -- totally sick URI. time, real evidence anyone sick near -- two days later -- sick again. Another URI. second time, started wearing mask every flight. Never got sick flight again. Even one time sat next dude flu thought going die mid-flight. 

It big deal wear mask pre-pandemic flights. one really gave shit said anything carry tradition. people say “masks big deal” slight inconvenience need stop speaking behalf everyone. I’m fully vaccinated power year half severe eczema flare-ups face. I’m time third face covered dry, red, itchy, painful, inflamed skin. 

If masks big deal you, go ahead wear one. everyone handles masks same. people say “masks big deal” slight inconvenience need stop speaking behalf everyone. I’m fully vaccinated power year half severe eczema flare-ups face. I’m time third face covered dry, red, itchy, painful, inflamed skin. 

If masks big deal you, go ahead wear one. everyone handles masks same. learned long pandemic months ago everything CDC says measured peer reviewed research. Wearing mask isn’t hurting friends. Think keep it. worried, order out?  bought KN-95 mask flew recently omg almost threw chemical smell. awful. again, sensitive nose. wanted something protective cloth mask it.  Ill trust CDC 1000x id trust WHO. except lot science data seat belts much mild asymptomatic COVID cases vaccinated people? Definitely historical moment. generations version Woodstock. Yes, would catch Covid. Many counties USA less 0.8 cases per 100,000/day. So, you’d catch Covid. Whereas vaccine 100% voluntarily taking. 

I’m taking side I’m saying need factor math going say same. summer unvaccinated South packed restaurants indoor venues. continue least September. ignorant dangerous viewpoint.

EVER worked?? issue personally telling vaccinated wear mask, way prove people vaccinated not, basically going nobody wearing mask. area, roughly 50% vaccinated almost nobody wears mask anymore. concern kids old enough get vaccinated.

I know people vaccinated basically like ""your kid problem"" - true. sucks can't count people large honest. is. that's transmissibility, compounds.

If offered 25% interest, compounded yearly, pretty damn stoked right? near 10x money every 10 years, power compound interest.

Well covid like that. instead compounding yearly, compounds every 5 days average.

It's sizeable savings. also variants (with 50% greater transmissibility) potentially much worse. personally hope cold flu season keep masks sick.

I'll probably indefinitely keep wearing masks certain situations reasons COVID. care anyone else thinks point. anymore. FOREVER wearing masks airplanes. Travel lot business (or least used to) always getting annoying colds travel.

They here.

Almost 70% adults NJ fully vaxx'd (in contrast 57% rate nationally) . Around 80% adults least 1 dose 65% total residents state least 1 dose. overwhelming majority people catching virus unvaccinated even delta variant around. Obviously ok vigilant variant point vaccinations far important stopping delta tracks masking couple minutes grocery store. parts country hit hardest variant lowest vaxx rates NJ one highest.

Edit: Kids good odds, yes. pass unvaccinated people. Fuck, selfish self-centered? stop thing, keep mutating.

My wife vaccinated. kids can't yet. I'm worried catch. They'll likely fine. I'm fucking TIRED hearing new variants news every night, y'all gonna let pandemic fill entire decade. Fuck y'all stupid. bad. Even so, know people UK got first jab. means immunity still long way.    Wait, I'm confused. What? is/was saying masks lead infection? miss something? see thread / OP post. ""Safe"" binary yes/no. Vaccines provide good coverage masking increases efficiency reducing cases. Going without relying vaccines seems like slow recovery. Whatever happened ""swiss cheese"" method prevention? like extreme burden wearing one store, open activities people wear masks possible cases (and variants) down. ""About half"" (which apparently 40%) adults, half cases. Structure sub really counterproductive users want ask questions, saying.

Anyways, two vaccination options country, Sinovac Biontech. wanted get Biontech serve data encourage/inspire generally conservative people around trust science new procedures etc(call corny/cringy).

But considering nature vaccine, hit me; im healthy person. naturally **assuming,** immune system prime. Im 22, dont move much generally quite fit nonetheless, dont smoke dont drink dont health complications, also dont put effort healthy whatsoever, like, time eat something green/healthy, cooks working Burger King dont forget put lettuce SteakHouse burger. times, call package biscuits breakfast. get picture. curious well still alive.

So going ask, ok get Biontech, safe considering probably subpar immune system go Sinovac? like think im smart enough tell difference random replies internet professional medical advice, dont shy telling think. course, bonus points know talking about.

Thank you. husband suddenly decided covid hoax met anyone bad enough cause major health problems.

He thinks fauci idiot.
He vaccinated btw keep huge fights it.

It literally dividing home. probability SARS2 infection serious consequences next year 55 year old unmasked fully vaccinated female moving around exposure environment really calculated 1 100 million? would fantastically vanishingly small risk. found this, excerpts    went bar Chicago Germany vs. England yesterday. rolling average .2% 13 new cases yesterday. normal I've felt ages. Why? part city followed science. getting reap benefits, without masks. 

Also, coming home. prefer maintaining bush nice buzz rather waxing fuck outta delicate balls. country function fine. Many unvaccinated already infected point natural immunity. Almost people high risk hospitalization vaccinated. handled massive winter surge societal collapse. Exactly me. want happen FDA approves vaccine fully emergency use. need hurry (safely). Many people participate subreddit scared (due constant bombardment media), want see content confirms fears justified. [BBC says vaccines effective preventing hospitalisation, dropped 100% 96% Pfizer. That's 4 hospitalisations every 100 see unvaccinated pop - easily manageable.

That's hearing. protect you, wonderful, unlikely go hospital - remembering many unvaccinated need either. pretty set.

The concern though community. seen numbers it, reasonable expect many vaccinated catching covid again, least mildly. land 4% hospital unless people catching again, all.

And people catching it, means people spread it. means unvaccinated people, like children, vulnerable again.

Worse, means circulate *despite* vaccines, giving chances overcome vaccines properly. spread duelling antibodies, chance one random mutations beat antibodies, start whole rodeo (al beit mRNA sleeve now).

*But* bad may sound. Scientists remind us can't see way still function changes spike protein substantially, that's enters cell. vaccines train immune systems recognise fight spike protein, remain confident immunity always - milder symptoms, etc.

But, reduce risk us racing boosters asap, ""think children"" along unvaccinated - scientists saying people continue wear masks, despite vaccines. honestly right thing do, right now. previous employer give shit vaccinated wearing mask, asking take off. refused. even told stupid wear mask vaccinated mother. wish line CDC drew begin with. get I'm probably cautious. wish people would mask essential places like grocery store (and elevators building). restaurants, gyms, bars? People extremely cautious (either preference necessity) going places besides outdoor versions anyway. include Reddit Twitter/Facebook/others? That’s true think social media way stay informed. It’s not. get social media, happier person better perspective, *still* informed reading news. Nice! got second Sunday I'm hyped only! They’re 7th graders end year, many height.

The masks help inevitable…..aroma…..of 13 year old bodies, definite plus! remember time, lasted like 7-8 months area one “Two America’s” short amount time might resolve own. People keep bringing up, kid's parents keep safe. seeing it, see adults wearing masks kids. reasons I've stated twice already. would blanket mandate here? Vaccines road takes us back normal. road takes us today go baseball game, movie theater, restaurant, mall, bowling alley.... say everyone put back mask restrictions come back - message meaning

If vaccines fork road, is? someone chooses wear mask that's great - I've already heard friends get stared glanced wearing mask even though vaccinated. still people Virginia sometimes wear masks outdoors - even one around hole logic US kids still can't get vaccinated. said, they're also much lower risk complications, maybe wash. hasn't.

Delta found October 2020... good researching articles fit narrative, research broaden understanding. guess. Even don’t trust cdc exposure single person vaccinated super low risk. It’s getting exposed multiple households bigger risk. Even vaccinated person don’t worry much risk me. cousin wants dumbass get it, primarily risking themselves.  planning reading this; dont. offers new info. vaccinated, substantial protection delta variant 

Also, gods name still recommending hand washing?! wonder people think they’re ridiculous shun away anyone unvaccinated, family/friends. Lot's kids can't get vaccine yet - maybe ever knows - surprise.  “Canada destroy all!”


Sorry. wanted try once, safe context. ""nothing"" worry about. less worry about.

You need nice welcoming everyone. simply like someone put danger something, perfectly acceptable avoid them. 

There's plenty people casual conversation simply like them, family included. would've thought needed say I’m happy did. Masks cost. Environmental costs. Psychological costs. county 22% vaccinated. delta variant here, cv19 twice already due people refusing mask? I'll keep best keep people safe -me- passing due getting thoughtless, unvaccinated folk.  Yup. parent two kids 12, ""screw them"" attitude resonate terribly well me. haha  Right science definitely clear potential suffering long COVID happen unlucky become breakthrough vaccinated infection case Sorta like didn’t need wear masks beginning? “Fool shame you, fool twice….you don’t get fooled again.” I’m sure mean? handing responsibility mask mandates. see abandonment role advising country public health. guess don’t. Ah, name calling, see you’re man, woman, science. true, fewer actual people rural areas, making infinitely easier distance others avoid spread. CCTV evidence transmission, could caught virus elsewhere. can't physically see transmission/infection.

If virus truly transmissible, we'd see universal outbreaks. important measure transmission across localities, regions, countries, etc.  something directly immediately ""beneficial"" complete waste time? think society would everyone felt like you? agree vaccines school activities required. end day right prohibit something entering body. ok giving ability participate certain societal activities. really though. clear 10 seconds enough vast majority cases, spread would astronomical regardless attempts mitigate. 

What seems far likely case infected person standing area low air movement while, passed person infected, person infected stood area long enough infected. Still obviously good thing spread, different every person walk past risk. vaccine goes FDA trials normally would emergency use banner, people get, mandated children normal public/private schooling.

they godtier postgame perfect difficulty, crystal really overrated tbh says!  problem is, science 100% clear. was, CDC would putting conflicting formation regarding vaccinated people masks. Children can’t get vaccinated. ah, sorry came across way. meant. Hope able get vaccinated soon! 26 *checks notes* 30 million fully vaccinated people. hope never drive ride car risk dying SIGNIFICANTLY higher. Shit, walking street probably better chance killing you.  Yes, since least 80% needed herd immunity, although may like 85-90% Delta variant. 95% measles reference. throwing post lends believe someone reasonable discussion. seeing breakthrough symptomatic cases, thoughts vaccine whole. often multiple breakthrough cases vaccinated persons diseases measles, small pox, etc. know outbreaks recent years small pockets unvaccinated areas, ever see discussions masking isolation mass scale reinstated vaccinated individuals? Forbes isn’t even considered reliable source subreddit. Safety absolute. risk everything. Safe means risk threshold would make reasonable people afraid. context, safety means risk serious disease always exposing random people public.

Air travel safe, always chance crash. Anyone got link actual research including numbers used?  looking total population instead adult/eligible population?   Everyone could get vaccine probably gotten it. Fuck rest. Lets Biden build wall unvaccinated pay it. Good! well within right wear mask that's makes feel safe/comfortable/happy. Nobody saying can't. people vaccinated also well within right listen CDC feel fine wearing mask. much easier wear mask inside stores facilities constantly hear mask on, mask off. even big inconvenience since masks readily available throwaways really cheap. really interfere breathing, little eyeglass fog extra sweating biggie. Exactly, people still saying wear mask emotion. told everyone follow science listen CDC yet want so. want wear mask, that's fine force  vaccinated people complain don't

It's annoying people still wearing masks probably vaccinated already. saying can't anything, take mask choose, fear great way live lives handle virus

&amp;#x200B;

The response lately mainly fear covers them. ""Global"" definition already. say global then? unnecessary.

r/iamverysmart moment. Middle/late July interesting CA, fairly high vax rate, also Delta restrictions rolled back. 4th shows happening, mitigation efforts rolled back exhausted populace might great litmus test see happens. hope vaccines kids approved then. ?  question Butthole—pleasures.

I’ve never laughed hard response addressing someone username, lol. wear masks sick. Walking around Seoul November you’ll see probably 40% people masked often not. You’re telling 40% Korea caught flu?

It refreshing though see get ahead delusional media reddit want fear panic every headline lot rest world factors play. one, lot places still large adult demographics offered vaccine. Others using vaccines shown protective Delta variant mRNA ones are.

In US, anybody demo that's level risk rises levels things typically live ample opportunity get vaccine highly protective hospitalization death. likely enough vaccination among risk demos we're going overrun hospitals. Masking interventions get us closer herd immunity, make people get vaccinated. interventions delay inevitable - flatten curve we're time curve needs flattening. There's endpoint epidemic level outbreaks everyone getting either vaccinated infected - covid disappearing something we're going continue exposed to. even could get it, there's many people cannot develop antibodies due medications given autoimmune disorders, organ transplants, etc. People forget they're hostile worried. happy see sentiment gain traction. seems folks addicted covid life, it’s quite odd me. There's big difference ""muh freedoms"" someone wanting wear mask they're fully vaccinated. I'm anti mask all, wore one entire pandemic fully vaccinated. according CDC, fully vaccinated need wear mask indoors, that's guidelines I'm going follow unless somewhere requires mask. hope isn’t supposed implying vaccines aren’t working. article specifically vaccines working expected area high vaccination rates. may coming variant near 80% UK's PHE data, right Pfizer specifically 88%. 80% reflects mix Pfizer AZ say, people love say unvaccinated people take large amounts medical resources. overweight obese people, arguably larger long term issue. Yet bringing labels fatphobic. unvaccinated want wander around without mask expose virus, let them. Infection, all, one path immunity — doesn’t kill you. you’re unlucky suffer permanent disability, well, warned.

I mean...they're wrong. don’t think people feel healthy get tested much. randomized control trial done would get confidence.

I making assumption statements media around vaccination reduces severity disease breakthrough cases. extrapolating mild become asymptomatic? severity proportional steady state viral load growth human body. vaccine probably lowers steady state increases threshold beyond starts overwhelming bodies defenses. 👆👆👆👆 they’re saying there’s exchange programme? talking about? rest us talking people willfully getting vaccine protect COVID-19. ""using science kill people agree with."" Indian variant = delta variant. C’mon  Uh, cite sources potential vaccinated people spread (at least mRNA vaccines). reason CDC came guidance first place actually evidence show mRNA vaccines suppress transmission. said updated mask guidance issued.

A reasonable question ask whether trust specific data. CDC seems trust it…. Israel paranoid then, right? vax rate way better maskless period lasted total two fucking weeks. Maybe, maybe, exceptionalism protect plague. us Johnson &amp; Johnson folks really got shaft Last read delta variant’s R0 value high 8. it’s infectious quite high measles. Hardly anyone talking side effect mRNA, higher rate VITT J&amp;J AZ 

The problem comparison VITT J&amp;J/AZ much serious harder treat myocarditis. VITT vaccines fatality rate 20-50%. masks becoming mandated LA, pro-maskers shitting non-maskers. mask rest lives?

I've always warned endgame entire time, accused ""conspiracy"".

Well... Hey, least admitting virus real. Progress made people! regions yes, regions no. country wide it’s high sixties percentage adults least one shot. That’s massive difference worldwide perspective. never cared science. 90% people following chosen in-group, even right side it. know lot people didn’t really care Covid risk Trump camp it. Yes, right. population infected skew younger given older people vaccinated much higher rates now, lot media coverage lying saying variants specifically target younger people, isn’t true.

The news media bad Covid. You’re right. trying keep simple, agreed, it’s scientific way it. back napkin kind thing. IMO 75% probably floor, ceiling. exactly true. [The vectors immunocompromised active infection lasts way get unvaccinated. immunocompromised largely vaccinated, producing response vaccine. Protect immunocompromised (in general also specifically unvaccinated) reduce risk variants. problem lies people like going around belittling people choose continue wearing masks, saying choosing emotion science. Perhaps root problems start closer home realize. have-nots usually circumstantial though. Vaxed vaxed-nots almost always choice. Anti-vaxxers get escape ""discriminated against"" status easily. got decent sources please? I've got family wedding August anti vaccine family I've seen anecdotally fine kids. sources googled seemed really old low amounts subjects studies. read due paywall.

But reaction NO. There's plenty good reasons lean going mask-less hurt unvaccinated. unvaccinated voluntary, like children teens deranged parents, even elderly disabled mercy folks. Plus, mutant viruses still pose risk even who've gotten shots. small percentage us personally (those us immune problems might protected shots others), unvaccinated people might inadvertently pass along to, even necessarily hurt us much. people get virus, mutants emerge, endangering everyone still further. Would mind linking this? able find interview.  though, even among unvaccinated. Much lower death rate rate hospitalisations across age groups. report was. /u/Nokids__3Money said ""When last time heard someone die serious complications getting vaccine?"" /u/eleanor_vance provided 4 examples. suddenly vaccines, dude 4 examples billions. 

How many examples enough? Better examples statistics

- UK [18 individuals 22 receiving AstraZeneca died. Less one million chance dying country pretty plagued Covid. probably take vaccine alternatives offered

- Norway [4 receiving vaccine. That's 1 30000 chance death limited demographic. good odds compared odds dying Covid Norway. That's [Norwegian Institute Public Health government stop distribution particular vaccine, government heeded.

It's local context - global total nubmers. Norwegian female 30 40 would definitely take AstraZeneca vaccine even offered, since Pfizer Biontech also offered. take lottery ticket less chance winning price?

This black white. said: ""It seem like there's middle ground wearing tin-foil hat block 5G signal wholeheartedly embracing vaccine"". be. room discuss say got vaccine sure talking points anti-vaxxer. So, I'm bit skeptical.

Again black white, sometimes gray. There's one vaccine there's one context. Notice less 200 upvotes saying keep wearing masks 30,000    two americas.

1. Many vaccinated, everyone going outside, still mask one forced almost one mentions thinks weird, many want vaccinated outside people gotten, good time all.
2. Many vaccinated, everyone going outside anyway, mask many tell stop wearing one dubious reasoning, masks forced everyone ignored, many wont vaccinated, people die health complications coronavirus, etc.

Why would want live ignorance run risk going unvaccinated disease that's killed 400,000 plus people America. make sense. quite suspicious designed virus hurt people gotten government shot lot people gotten /s can't infer efficacy way fact vulnerable weaker immune systems likely vaccinated makes vaccine appear less effective actually is. Efficacy likely significantly higher. Literally… News UFOs dropped nobody cares. 20 years ago would caused mass panic would say 50+ thousand cases reasonable size get somewhat accurate data. table 3 page 11 also shows much lower hospitalisation rates among age groups sooo 10-second interaction causing transmission would mean astronomically high R-naught, likely higher measles. would bare raw infection numbers, would explode countries Delta variant case. played silly covid long.  drag way longer necessary. Exactly, mention says safe vaccinated. CDC propaganda wing executive branch point. One would thought CDC would improved change administrations, NOPE.  I’d also add plenty countries vaccinating using lower efficacy vaccines, vaccines simply isn’t much known (Sputnik seems good, nowhere near much data Pfizer moderna AZ).

All re-enforce, they’re trying guide whole world exponentially factors play US virtue that. Apparently regular COVID scary infectious enough, Delta Variant DLC comes job. people still saying become another ""I identify apache attack helicopter"" type ""joke""? get it.

1. Trump funded vaccine development last summer.
2. FDA Trump approved last November.
3. Trump began distribution last December.
4. Trump took last January.
5. Trump told people get CPAC last February.

Why Trump fans take it? It’s CDC looks nation, rules guidelines aren’t going necessarily line perfectly city like LA NYC. That’s states also stricter less strict guidelines. “If virus circulating, people vaccinated exposed virus. vaccine-boosted immune systems likely fight virus, could start mutate little little, versions virus successfully evade vaccinated body's immune response advantage allow take off.

The vaccinated unvaccinated people swapping virus among themselves, chances evolve.

As Covid-19 deaths hit record lows, dying younger disproportionately Black 
As Covid-19 deaths hit record lows, dying younger disproportionately Black before

That's even vaccinated people still taking care, says Pekosz.
""As mutations come viruses, ones persist ones make easier virus spread population,"" said.

That argument using masks, even vaccinated, said. ""Particularly comes situations vaccinated people going indoors conditions virus may little easier spread,"" said.” think cite reliable sources data one accurate. blaming, stating facts. Yeah, even employer medical manufacturer mandated vaccination yet.  They're hoping government it, else employees free will.

Cowards. Yep. Educated uneducated. Enlightened ignorant. two Americas No? issue UN agencies; It’s political organization first. 

They obviously put politics first even operate countries it’s still bias recognized. I’m vaccinated. followed guidelines, limited spent time pandemic, got shot offered. I’m enjoying fact science works. 

My concern three year old daughter. I’m making wear masks places like grocery store, chances catching anything super small. places needs wear one, I’ll wear mine can’t imagine making wear one I’m not. Scotland foreevveeerrrr!!!!!!!!! places overwhelmed, though? I'm quite sure understand level infections high transmissibility would cause.

Yes, probability low. vaccinated persons get Covid-19. But, Dr. Cioe-Peña said, level virus nose droplets contagious vaccinated “You probably aren’t going pass on,” said.

""Coming vaccinated person"" worst ever argument getting vaccinated. like refusing use condoms 98% effective\*.

\* mean 2% condoms fail they're used, means 2 100 become pregnant used whole year. may never understand US ha ha yeah unbelievable eh think unfair comment much Australia, since know much case numbers vaccine supply there, points obviously valid. 'best' vaccine part mentioned people wanted ask. 

If we're focused solely Australia say COVID numbers well controlled, higher risk groups (the elderly, immunocompromised etc) vaccinated track trace system good, young person, yes, may actually best hold AZ vaccine (assuming wait mRNA vaccine long looking travel time soon would put greater risk COVID go someone endemic also risk bringing back). point I'd argue fact specific situation, risk serious side effect would outweigh risk catching COVID (again, going currently low number stated assuming rise lot time access mRNA vaccine), rather efficacy vaccine (given facts regarding mixing vaccines). think part around world, countries afford wise move, understandable situation (and presumably NZ, followed case numbers recently, though know pretty well!). point stuck mentioned supply issue act Aus due receive substatial number mRNA vaccines, great! Hopefully cases remain well-controlled then.

Just point tijme doses; first deemed best delay second dose AZ allow many people least partially protected one dose, turned delaying doses actually also increases immunity stuck, rather supply issue. fact, recently found wait even longer (10 month) doses, immunity, including T-cell reponse, even greater still! obviously needs balance.

AZ like said lot bad press, may slightly political especially offered effective, cheaper, easily stored alternative compared vaccines (unfortunately that's pharaceutical industries work), also (the initial trials many favours consistent dosages time frames, great start). working know now, evident that's AZ's efficacy impressive. Regarding VIIT, understandable people worried it, look PHE example, number fatalities actually quite similar Pfizer (details given specific causes, know example there's greater number portal vein thrombosis), get media coverage (FYI important obviously transparent, probably best highlighted media given what's happened AZ reported clots, see yourself. want breakdown side effects/ADRs vaccine, European Medicines Agency website breakdown reported cases shows serious events seen even mRNA vaccines). 

By way, although may frustrated lockdown (you may be), want say that's fantastic see Australia taking seriously lot protect Australians high PCR testing, lockdowns general precautions.

As said, mostly agree situation seems little different Australia compared countries especially rise delta variant seen most.

Anyway, best, stay safe!  provide link report please? scared second jab perhaps take it. safe one jab? got really weak 1 vaccine point vomiting. lasted 3 days 4 days less severe symptoms. vaccines feel 2 jab overkill young people. 22 vaccine moderna. extremely healthy young adult.

I'm saying one better other,... actually know that? specifically ask better get immunity infected vaccinated, that's irrelevant question hand. Speaking France, travel restrictions Indians (and red zone arrivals) forced quarantine. vaccinated recognized vaccine recent Covid infection certificate, quarantine recognizance; otherwise, police supervised quarantine.

Don't feel need reply, 'best' vaccine part mentioned people wanted ask. 

Sorry, may come across wrong. think silly. know cars, aspirin, probably-lightning kills that. comment perception, one irrational humans are.

They've ""heard"" (and yes, agree Pfizer _fantastic_ marketing, annoyed end) there's better, can't come back that.

There angles, especially age bracket getting Pfizer (which remember inner lizard brain went ""yay"" hear), along across ditch New Zealand, leaves feeling half-hearted it.

I agree, silly, looking travel time soon would put greater risk COVID go someone endemic also risk bringing back

All travelers skip queues get vaccine recommended age bracket, Pfizer &lt; 50, AZ 50.

But also can't travel abroad leisure moment (mad, know), due limited infrastructure support quarantine requirements return (14-days hotel quarantine + 3 tests, one ""release"") risk represents community outbreaks.

It really quite different here, better worse evident that's AZ's efficacy impressive

Agreed, mean badmouth general. efficacy literally dream 12 months ago - better reasonable get media coverage

I honest, early global vaccine rollout quietly suspected mRNA bad press suppressed, clotting disorder could hitting parties equally, due interaction spikes ACE2 receptors. 100% field, I've seen enough propaganda/marketing, especially working entities big ""big pharma"" put much past - especially mRNA hail mary saving US time.

But _do_ trust provided pretty great transparency far. They're requesting reports myo/pericarditis following Comirnaty, seem concerned anything yet. Maybe time we're youngest age brackets, course. Cross bridge way, although may frustrated lockdown (you may be), want say that's fantastic see Australia taking seriously lot protect Australians high PCR testing, lockdowns general precautions.

I understand genuinely small price pay freedoms we've had, including ability simply see grandma/nanna without anxiety last year.

I can't say correct - expect we'll hear long-term mental anguish individuals, etc, pandemic, country go unscathed. like we've done something different, difference provide case studies epidemiologists years come - adding wealth knowledge, hopefully, find better solutions next time.

It interesting see exit unique position though. Hopefully, without much chaos. know he’s imbecile ? least acknowledge selfish letting unable vaccinated die privilege. Kudos you! awkward That's true. I'm Russian, lot people around whining ""bad government cannot trusted"", see reports Argentina, San-Marino, Bahrain - nothing changes. ""I care papers, chip vaccine"", say.

You provide data - come new excuse.

An online conference vaccine developers held yesterday. awful buzzing swarm anti-vaxxers spammed comments ravings poison, fertility, chips, called reprisals vaccine developers.

They trust government, poor ones? No. They're incredibly stupid ignorant. I'm going anywhere even second shot. is, go supermarket. can’t turn around let someone die confused asshole. may involve security eventually transferring it’s still responsibility, can’t “hang up” two small kids mask (despite fully vaccinated) feel owe bring home Covid, even serious me. really big deal wear one anyway. mean rights freedoms choices come destroy virus?

How possible? Sadly typical response really know that, enough time passed. Many still fearing line weird side effects. restaurants Ireland surviving without indoor dining? Look India. Worked delta rampaging? Methinks shall see two weeks poor decision. say COVID dangerous (even vaccinated) still wear mask go shopping, justify music festivals? Sporting events? Parties? Drinking friends? 


This idea even extremely efficient vaccines get us pandemic extremely dangerous. get though - unvaccinated people still young thus unlikely suffer severe case covid.

If people aged 40+ already vaccinated number hospitalisations would few.

I mean, recommend unvaccinated go bars etc. anyway outbreak ill kinda sucks - deadly threat individual health service. 😁😂😂😂😂😂 still...umani!

The people want mask wearing lockdowns vaccine readily available politicians talking heads mouthpieces billionaire class push fear mongering pieces like order preserve profits. spike driven people one dose though? pay regular staff 10% bring travelers 200% more? That's upper management earning big bucks, got think like CEO. I'm curious rather pessimistic happens another wave hospitalizations unvaccinated people. Seems likely a... self-sorting process patients increasingly less likely cooperative heeding medical advice. Yep. become ""political issue"" folks, amount calm, respectful, rational discussion impact. Better point pay impose actual mandate (the latter would cause 40% country flip out, probably go former).  meetings schedule meeting don’t get yearly flu shot , feel guilty well ?

Even outdoors heat, mildly uncomfortable worst. C'mon. KN95 inexpensive, widely available, highly effective protecting wearer around hate anti-vaxxers one point cannot argue against. Nobody forced anything body state 

That said, anti-vaxxers allowed participate public life others acted responsibly. 

In conclusion: fuck anti vaxxers. Keep fuck away public private establishments. can't force go anywhere ban coming you.  lot people concerned whether people spend time vaccinated trying protect someone risk covid complications. could tell people vaccinated would never need ask again. basically playing game telling people vaccinated. Yes. Delta variant accounts 20% cases US right  guess hypochondriac working background anxiously waiting reason pull trigger masking population used scary new variant spreading excuse get want don’t get healthcare, it’s unstable part. people realizing better pay fewer hours make cons traveling nurse presents. healthcare isn’t bad actually afford rent prescriptions even without insurance. Well definitely given confidence consider new field. definitely worth shot thank info 😊 I’m currently looking get next degree nursing informatics. think kind degree would translate well outside hospital? Could agree more. anti vaxx people creating fear hesitation, that's thought Dad's story particularly relevant considering consequences inaction manifest, family. Every covid based sub going rails this. majority seem trolls, others somewhat sympathetic. don’t get yearly flu shot , feel guilty well ? 

It’s new vaccine, I’m going feel best interests everyone else . go first observe complications may arise . May Ape-siah bless you, faith DD work crappy place anymore. taking one year nurses. available, hospital taking travelers year two belt. Unfortunately Texas worker rights little respect nursing staff. I've worked Austin DFW areas; perhaps Houston better. Safe Harbor (I worked Texas couple years even heard it) dangerous staffing, which, invoked, protects invoking nurse's license. Good luck whatever decide do.  common sense? buy higher spec product performing better lower models. 

By way, people Asia knew years ago learned SARS pandemic. Cambridge academics think reinvented wheels? think vaccine passport gain popularity next year. We're going see third wave going hit low vaccinated spots delta variant, that's sad could mutate. We're woods. remember reading original predictions 2024 2025 it'll serious anymore. We're going deal people stubborn possibly find hard way. visceral reactions. going difficult knot us untangle, must. need protect other.

Sure, we'll solve political division day try hard enough.

The answer always either pay people impose mandate. can't simply persuade entire population something. think ever worked. incentives, carrots sticks. Jesus I'm sorry. also one first, one per week, may gone 2 per week left. 

We got covid pay parent hospital decided put specific criteria met order staff member receive included certain attendance %. So, nephrologist put 2 week precautionary quarantine soon covid hit hospital, decided ineligible receive bonus meet attendance requirement. put criteria place fact. Even though staff units refusing much set foot unit. Even though came right back work donned PPE work covid side every day putting myself, husband immunocomprimised mom risk. denied me. staff refused come unit ""ew, covid"" - got bonuses. boss coworkers wonderful. wrote petition behalf HR parent hospital complaining unfairness went nowhere. boss even begged take HR fight it. principle, know? give crap money. 

Anyway, sorry vent. try think much. definitely made decision leave no-brainer. Wouldn’t taking away anti vaxxers freedom choosing goes body? Well said!

Ty posting offset experience anyone reading, took work day second shot Moderna, really to. bit headache next morning maybe nausea like 24hrs later lasted like 2 hours, slight. Sorry hear tough time. Went Costco Utah. mask mandate first lifted, felt like maybe 10% people kept wearing masks. Last time went, felt like maybe 70% wearing masks. asked data. NYT article. come pretty awful person. Good day. Hm, learn transmission risk vaccinated people, sounds like may vulnerable really staying home sake. Masks everyone essential places like grocery stores sounds right. Restaurants bars concerts sports events nonessential space maskless “enter risk.”  I'll fine wear mask indoors grocery stores retail places. I'm bar restaurant, happening. point, screwed sounds can't save everyone. ones unable get vaccine, may lock again. complicated. 

I agree adopt method brothers sister Asia, sick wear mask. least shows respect let us know cautious. I'm willing rarely get sick I'm average build person. 

It's weird things work get people comply masks forever. weird. least cultural standpoint. [nice Reckless endangerment. Punishment per state. would nurse would pay well would require lots time off, like four four off, 100k year. thought recognized face profile... know three unvaccinated people say vaccines probably get eventually.

Yeah, say get drop issue. likelihood going get it. funny guys identical politics gotta remind people even scoffed, laughed, mocked sharing stories I've come realize that's wrong . way get people take seriously get people like share happens continue similar path . 


Thank sharing !  Read article saying 30% dead delta fully vaccinated. Singapore uses Pfizer Moderna vaccination drive. Still spike end May. Pay still problem.

I make near nothing amount bust ass (under 30 bucks). America, especially rural, vastly underpaid. Medical practices insurance companies grotesque feedback loop overcharging negotiating ultimately passing buck onto American subscribers/patients, choice, tell ""thank goodness health insurance, would costly without it!"" 

Everyone likes cheaper group insurance rates yet somehow many fail realize really, really, really big group (like entire state, example) could bring costs even more. risks dying Covid likely far less say instance riding motorcycle without helmet. Hence lack concern . Yes that's concern. always least responsible ones putting everyone else risk. 

Masks almost nothing protect you. They're protecting others, order system work everyone wear them. I’m vaccinated consequences think anti Vaxxers deserve? Already 2x Pfizer

So old then. People 55 even chance get second shots yet. rhetorical strategy going broadly effective. People heavily politically polarized largely made minds point. proven way get people vaccinate cash payment mandate. Talk four months ago.  link two months old point. Here’s recent study. repost wanted see it. Strengths limitations study discussed briefly NEJM podcast week also. Cloth masks provide lesser protection wearer. Even wear vaccinated covid, catching viral pneumonia, flu, something else could still useful case covid cases go up. Vaccinated people also still catch covid, smaller rate usually better outcomes. 

The cloth masks catches muffles spittle also diffuses breath doesn’t fly far away body. would ""roll dice"" 10 times day rather masked. That's exactly shared it. Thanks adding context.

2. taking vaccine isn’t emotional issue . vaccinated population merely test group . Like anything life I’ve learned never go first . I’ll revaluate decision vaccination year passed , potentially two years . I’m young healthy adult lose nothing waiting . 

3. death rate small considering it’s probably competing natural mortality comes sooner .

We’re idiots consume finite resources planet want live without inconvenience. also difficulty understanding concrete things see directly - including children adults interact contact with.

Seems like lot (but all) risk could potentially mitigated avoiding even moderate exercise 1-2 weeks shot.  vaccinated people symptoms getting tested covid? GIVE LIBERTY GIVE MASK

Just run health insurance costs actually getting healthcare services get sick. I'd agree masks stay anywhere essential people go like places listed. Anywhere else people make decision. Still, many ""underlings"". way thinking is, could cut 100 peoples salary $5,000 nets $500,000. Or, work longer hours could reduce staff 10 saving $1 million salary benefits.

Come Indiana, single person wearing mask except me. Vaccination individual risk. It’s stopping disease spread. 

Anti-Vaxers know this. refuse vaccine still expect everyone else vaccinated protect them. way parasites. already saying that. extra percentage protection masks provide someone took 95% effective vaccine? Probably less 1%.

Masks necessary vaccinated. Follow science, aka CDC  would walked away point could go scream punch holes wall. U.S. end bottom developed world vaccine uptake per capita. surprising given U.S. probably highest proportion antivaxers. Supply needs catch countries. would certainly nice staff could compelled. system work believe rate 75-80% range, that's still low... vaccinations received, included, necessarily going effective coming variations.

They've extremely effective every variant yet. explain think future mutations different given mRNA vaccine target spike protein, remains largely variants?

I'm going downvote you, seem following science. Cases/deaths way down, continuing direction. Vaccines extremely effective variants. need booster arrives (which yet, even close), well-positioned roll matter weeks. 

You say people ""blind what's happening"". exactly ""happening"" US? CDC also jumped gun getting rid mask mandate wayyyy enough people vaccinated.  sorry deal that, issue friends best. imagine family adds whole new layer difficulty frustration. article doesn’t mention it:

This Jesus camp. kind camp letting COVID spread unchecked last summer. surprised people learned zero lessons/give zero f*cks summer. Strictly talking US (since I’m educated situation countries), pro-lockdown/pro-vaccine state, yes, since states enough people vaccinated Mid-Fall avoid surge.

If anti-lockdown state low vaccination rate, no, there’s still high chance might dealing Winter surge people don’t roll sleeves next months. Two Americas would preferable ways, already going wrong direction front.

When local mlb stadium reopened, first vaccinated worst seats house. Then, vaccines became available, changed best seats vaccinated only.

That's way be, or, even ideally, require vaccine admitted all. (I truly sympathize people allergic vaccines, vanishingly small number people).

Instead, much horror, saw announced stadium going stop checking vaccine status altogether. Great, awesome, guess seeing baseball person anytime soon. fml ones got application approval for?

How would EMA (or FDA w/e) review drug submitted review/approval? EMA worldwide jurisdiction time, become reasonably acceptable risk partake activities difficult impossible without mask. time, however, would prudent keep mask mandates place cause absolutely functional impedance (eg.: retail stores, pharmacies, clinics, hospitals, pharmacies, etc.), save things (oral nasal examination hospital, example).

Edited correct grammar remove extra word Even 12 year olds get vaccinated, unvaccinated still pose threat mutations reduce effectiveness vaccines chance happening increases infections.

As f got mine sentiment, care unvaccinated threat us, care lives we. I’d even consider enemies longer continues they’re taking away additional 1-2 years lives unnecessarily forcing us quarantine bad mental health instead socializing letting us live lives. time frame long wars last. don’t care people setting fire playing Russian roulette costs entirely born people themselves. getting vaccine negative externalities affect us, therefore antivaxxers pretty much taking time away normal lives, I’d therefore consider enemies certain point. person 100% correct.

While undeniable outliers negatively affected well (a small percentage children immunocompromised can't take vaccine even want to), anti-vaxers dug graves.

And anyone mentions ""it'll mutate even moaaaaar"", there's scientific evidence virus become deadlier, contagious. So, got vaccine, fine.

Vaccines save lives. that's fault fall category people medically unable get vaccine. think referring US, point, fully available everyone absolutely choice get it.

Anthony ""David Simon"" Faucci  happily wear shirt says “I giant baby don’t want wear mask”, means don’t wear mask vaccinated.  Kids yet vaccinated mine genetic lung disease. I’m kn95-ing everywhere go (eg work).  I’m confident got breakthrough case, would fine. children likely would not. 

You stop pedantic judging yourself. Try living Canada - everyone lockdown forever regardless vaccination. idiot top Doctor reason keeps going vaccine isn’t enough. Well then, is? messaging going convince people get it. likely, yes. Virologists coming conclusion really doesn’t room mutate worse variant we’ve already had, vaccination efforts continuing, considerable number people immune via prior infection. almost certainly passed peak, though localized outbreaks likely next year two. won’t anything like spring 2020. Yeah it’s media media. every time someone doesn’t take medications? doesn’t tell people they’re infected? 

I’m good idea provided we’re consistent it. “Stay home, Betty! one wants summer cold!” Something knew never going happen globally. People human - better worse, we’re robots ""The New South Wales premier, Gladys Berijiklian, described “scarily fleeting” encounters resulting Delta spread Sydney CCTV revealed two people walking past Bondi Junction Westfield transmitted virus.

I’m glad came said this. 

If want continue wear mask whatever reason that’s perfectly fine, power you. love god though need stop narrative fully vaccinated people chose forgo masks assholes don’t care others , wanna kill grandma children, whatever talking point we’re today.

No, never paid attention history talked minorities, ask? CDC masks last April? Yes, see response MDC  know continue wear, I’m tired it. got vaccinated soon could- dec/Jan. skin scarred. skin breaks it’s painful. continue wear masks stores- weekend went town husband outdoors 90 percent time didn’t wear masks, felt good finally see people’s faces feel little like normal life again. Delta plus... Good thing vaccine Scientist know North America South America. honest, surprised many people actually thought over. Maybe president I’m laughin  Oh fully agree, thats kind getting at.

So morons scaring people inside variants spreading borderline anti-vax BS, source use next time. you’re vaccinated, congratulations, it’s over! large scale, small programs. I’m self-testing twice week one them. Took mask CDC said could, I’ve stayed negative.

Vaccination rates world low (she said 15%) compared US, makes sense recommendations different. Uhh isn’t trump pro vaccine medical staff tested everyday??? States lower vaccination levels already lot deaths illness. evens things bit. Technically, vaccinated people safe covid even delta variant heavily sick caught. mask matter picture protection themselves.

But mask reduce spread. Vaccinated people still carry disease short period body destroy virus. would harm unvaccinated (not opposed can't take vaccine atm). 

However risk really smaller countries high percentage vaccinated.  Agreed. I'm VT, highly vaccinated state, county believe highly-vaccinated county state. I've living life pre-pandemic last couple weeks now, masks, going eat, going festivals, without fear. (I'm vaccinated, course.) We've single case Delta variant far, cases remained consistently single digits state-wide, deaths least 6 weeks. Obviously, Delta variant becomes concerning we'll make changes, everything 98% back normal, feels amazing.  gym honestly last place want be. People breathing heavy everywhere. Seems like would first place want mask. need laws make spreading medical disinformation Federal crime.

It's like yelling ""Fire!"" theater. 

Disinformation costs lives. sure relevance is. vaccines still high efficacious.  know permanent reading r/Parosmia sure heck want even try out. Antiwaxxed States America vs United States America. start reading lines.

Different organizations different situations manage. came said fully vaccinated people worldwide totally protected Delta don’t need wear masks, would stupid every country using mRNA vaccines everyone enough medical literacy know means fully vaccinated. WHO’s statement made sense given organization does, CDC’s statement also probably makes sense given does. son 20 months old, 16 months we’ve spent state lockdown. supposed say him, sorry lost sense smell lung problems rest life, really wanted take library? idea Covid could affect I’m gambling future health it. He’s still young wear mask four months event then, can’t imagine he’ll willingly keep face period time.

We’ve made do, lots backyard adventures, paint play dough, indoor slides purchases privileged able afford, he’s coming age we’ve got get world. wish could make anti maskers care all. vaccine? unity possible comes total capitulation never-mask whiner caucus? two americas someday turn one america one america die covid.  disagree. shots there. People go get them. Republicans killing people making politics. Period. End story. 

I suppose ANOTHER lockdown Delta Covid variant control two months. protect people. issue enough unvaccinated people get Delta variant, mutate possibly something vaccines protect. 

But sure, name ""choice"" bullshit excuses. government already spent $6 Trillion thing.... time people part.  part many (actually know) believe vaccine simply necessary. expectations believe never anything flu going around wearing masks big ploy control people. Honestly. live rural county lightly infected cases, yesterday health dept. announced two Delta strain cases known county. interesting see happens. Vaccination rates low counties. could spread like wildfire. honestly, give rat's ass, assuming, course, immediate family, vaccinated, stay safe. Fuck rest them. know sounds harsh, I'm sick shit veil pulled back ever since Obama elected. Maybe natural selection occurring. really. Get vaccinated want want to.
Solved problem? know someone boat. pointed Trump got vaccine Covid. said ""He's showing leadership, necessary."" 
SMH. France likely going reach 60%.  already lower life expectancy rates red areas even pandemic. brother already existed Pretty sure people regularly exercise likely die dumbbell accidents. don’t need controls observational research. It’s experiment. Please take single research methods course come spouting nonsense. OC context vaccinated people wearing masks.

You moving goal posts. I’m anti masker anti vaxxer science (CDC) says vaccinated individuals need wear masks. Unless disagreeing CDC  stupid america adapted survive...like Covid 2 doses Pfizer back March Agreed, anti body level lower, guarantee infection. However I’m sure argument immunocompromised.

If don’t get full protection that’s understood, sure finger pointed unvaccinated. However point out, many people skip yearly flu shot? (I tell working pharmacy that’s LOT) it’s bit hypocritical people skipped flu shots judging others case covid, little realize flu deadly immunocompromised well, didn’t matter think he/she means: among vaccinated people, 92% received mRNA vaccine, 8% J&amp;J. detectable level antibodies mean vaccine longer effective.  body memory cells produce antibodies needed. Yes, concern systemically still contribute. delta variant getting herd immunity take like 85%. protection, much depends vaccine. It’s interesting talking doctors underpaid (I don’t disagree) context salaries places like EU, significantly lower. *way* underpaid there?  No. There’s straight answer. Pokemon Go launch Hey, (somehow) survived now, think they'll go easy I'm bar restaurant, happening.

I feel like even health officials would unofficially recognize fruitless wear mask 10 minutes table spending next hour half maskless. impractical last time felt like idiot. places, like stores, still easy enough do. early report also unable describe longer-term outcomes among patients. talking about, despite faults South America awesome. 10/10 would visit again. like France much behind US. Please keep mind children still cannot get vaccinated blatant disregard unvaccinated also means them. 92% people vaccinated mrna vaccine, 8% J&amp;J (rounding) sheer number people world believe paranoid conspiracy theories superstitious shit pisses off! “From 1983 2002, Fauci one world's frequently-cited scientists across scientific journals”. Y’know, assume someone important profound impact science still majority scientific community behind him. Really? Every single farmer, manufacturing worker, energy worker unvaccinated? new people entering job market sectors? myocardial inflammation acute cold; proportion increased 48% follow-up

This supports point even more, risk myocarditis vaccine miniscule comparison risk viral infection, therefore reason avoid taking vaccine. Let's hope. clearer UK cases peaked, let's see level hospitalizations deaths peak. However, many people still get chance get jab, excuse us calm :) would also appreciate anti vax coworkers quit go work brethren instead.

Nothing super awesome yet, though. Mask become badge pride ideology symbol, unfortunately. 15 ER nurses hospital work 3 quit last month go traveling. Also basic nature contract work means traveling nurses getting 52 weeks worth paychecks every year. Plus, they're typically getting benefits either. Hell, they're guaranteed anything beyond whatever contract they're currently on. higher rate compensation lower job security lack things like insurance retirement. 

Additionally, look HR perspective quite often cheaper bring temp employee higher rate bring permanent employee, permanent employee additional costs rolled benefits, like 6.2% Social Security tax, insurance, healthcare, etc. that's even including concept pay traveling nurse part year. Would maybe full approval vs EUA help? 

Asking friend live masks appeared almost useless.

NYC, really NY general, strict masks surge going last September looked pretty much like every state mask mask.

I'm technically anti mask though stretchy bands irritate ears tie ones pain ass get off. I'm seeing clear evidence masks much anything. NYC big bump back March 2020 everyone masked muted Sept 2020 would sold.

As was, 30,000 foot level seem make substantial difference. Kids get flu shots.

I'm glad hear vaccinated done this, fuck everyone else right? 

I can't believe masks pinnacle inconvenience people... Sigh.. Late/mid 30s. hell. Wouldn’t wish anyone. It’s union, won’t happen. Can't believe 16 months still saying but...

If pandemic taught anything many fellow countrymen.. live bucket full rats everything fucking everyone else process. good analogy. Vaccines another layer protection, change dynamics.

""Trust Science^(TM), except scary!"" [Citation Needed] Unfortunately agree. kids (2 4) getting vaccinated soon they're able, hopefully fall. 

But there's gonna lot kids feel them, way immunocompromised. I'm sure it, though. Science also says get TONS different diseases/issues/whatever. mean need freak every single one them. JFC get point. swear spawned whole generation people never going go outside again.  know enough. know harm children (MIS-C), variants relatively low.

There another element though: virus able circulate amongst vaccinated, there's hard fight continue (due trained immune systems) - many children exposed new mutations every day? chance one going assigned new Greek letter own, mutation watch?

I mean scare-mongering there. selective pressure, one exists virus able infect vaccinated people. problem before, virus couldn't. delta, probably still *much* problem. much immune-escape going get?

It much, much less likely. That's sub-12,000 new daily cases opposed 250,000 last winter.

Either way, we're much good time it. winter here, respiratory illnesses always seem transmissible winter. (Again bad debate looking/talking math odds)

I don’t entirely agree that. Even twice transmissible (so example county it’s 1.6 cases/100,000/day)…there’s lots people aren’t multiple personal contacts per week/month. 

I agree prob will. wouldn’t say it’s “delusional” entertain thought it’s possible avoid infection people.

Less 25% population first dose, high-risk oft-exposed groups, weaker vaccines prevent delta infection. pretty crucial slow spread however population get vaccinated. 

None applies New Jersey, though. There's two levels ""safe"" here.

One, go hospital. PHE study estimates 4 people 2-dose Pfizer go hospital every 100 unvaccinated. basically first rolling see go unvaccinated, rolling two dice see escaped vaccine - double sixes meaning - well, that's decent protection.

But concerning one, societal level. *Infections* common vaccinated community. means transmissions - and, screw it, they're antivaxxers kids whatever, brought themselves.

But missing, virus moving vaccinated people, exposure antibodies, likely pops mutation may allow overcome them.

Fortunately, scientists think would unlikely - spike essential infects cells, can't change much. *Also*, mask problem basically masks effective booster shot - knows long take.

But that's situation right now. complicated health, solution unsatisfying enough maybe worry anyway. maybe do, leave experts/policy advisors preferences decide. BioNTech deliveries slowing summer, Moderna picking deliver, least Germany (I could find confirmation EU nations) expected. means total number available doses weekly basis remain less  wearing mask isn’t going change minds not.

Reddit social media know. mean vaccination program covers everyone everyone get shot. 

I mentioned another answer, mostly first vaccination taken abroad, vaccination isn’t registered home country’s vaccine database. 

Vaccinated people, prove database, pretty much get live normally that’s I’m wondering. I’m vaccinated currently still don’t get freedoms lol. take another 2 doses it’ll registered. It’s easy. Re-tailor roll out. Fuck y’all never managed anything, you? Fucking teenagers telling “it’s easy we’ll make new vaccine!” breaks to, 100% Pfizer vaccine simply much better preferred option there's choice.  found morning husbands vaccinated coworker tested positive covid, symptomatic (hence got tested). that's great news.  North America South America... Pfizer first dose rocked world 3 straight days weren’t lucky I've fully vaccinated months now, county live still ~30% vaccination. everywhere go hear people chatting plans travel summer. stupid fucking people undoing. I'm sure hell masking foreseeable future. going post rest paragraph Children’s Hospital Philadelphia page linked quoted, going conveniently leave completely goes argument?

The rest talks vaccine immunity SAFER. nothing stronger better. I’m probably going keep wearing mask because, even though im vaccinated, I’m still high risk. forgotten control facial expressions. party 30-40 individuals (exact count stated), 26 caught 1 case, along regular reports ""now whole household gets it"".

Well, traditional superspreading event. quite common start pandemic vanilla SARS-CoV-2.

I know party 60 guests caught two infected individuals, turn led 400 infected. teens, hospitalizations deaths. Someone else get 2 doses less.

A single extra shot around 6 months probably highly sterilizing (they're running trials that). Better wait next-gen boosters deal variants though. close walked other? terrifying.   attitude leaves places like Houston Miami anyone south fighting stop ass backwards republican governments trying next stupid shit.

Absolutely doctor would advise child 2 ever wear mask. Mask aren’t 100% effective either  thought CDC literally recommended something completely different? maybe WHO. fact unvaccinated people going go around shopping, etc. without mask lie it. That's though I've fully vaccinated since January, wear mask I'm out. Exxxxxxcept UV light treatment actually thing last 10-15 years, used kill viruses bacteria using non-invasive methods, also use term disinfectant may sloppy, majority people would equate ""drinking clorox"" dont engage six inches ears.

That’s probably you.  Vaccinated people still carriers, I've got two small children I'm fully vaccinated continue wear mask people get shot. Actually, using method use calculate seasonal flu deaths, death toll north million (it 912,000 mid-May). Diagnostic data flawed circumstantial. regards covid, syndromic measurement.  death estimates calculated analyzing excess mortality rate isolating anything else would throw expected figures. try isolate things like drop workplace accidents car crashes uptick preventable deaths associated covid, imperfect science. 

So we'll never exact number, safe conclude covid SPECIFICALLY killed million people US alone.  still going. think delta strain poses real risk vaccinated population. initial sarcasm ""wait 2 weeks"" misleading.  Deaths absolutely trailing indicator virus spreading. stupid civil war  short while, unvaccinated either get vaccinated die off. Even now, nearly covid deaths unvaccinated people.

Cases currently high here. know several mRNA-vaccinated people contracted virus symptomatic.

This surprising! [Pfizer efficacy symptomatic infection delta mean 88 every 100 people can't ever catch it, means [your risk getting COVID symptoms 12% means protected also depends *where* are. people around COVID, 12% previous risk might nearing zero. somewhere exposed shitloads shitloads cases, although risk would much higher vaccinated, might actually still somewhat likely catch it, seeing happen degree right now.

If catch [your risk hospitalised also 4% previously going differ less environment individual person, mean vaccinated people almost unkillable COVID, people super duper high risk severe illness vaccination much lower still non-zero one.

Here's thing: vaccines *absolutely work*. look differences UK stats last winter proof that. Despite high cases, hospitalisations deaths much, much lower. zero unfortunately slowly ticking cases, reasons explained above, *spectacularly* lower previously.

Vaccines work. true *without perfectly protective*. things mutually exclusive.

If cases low are, absolute risk catching symptomatic COVID may well negligible right worth thinking about. However, spike significantly, worth understanding despite vaccinated might well get symptomatic COVID. almost certainly die end hospital, may fine that.

However, someone baseline-high risk (as -- immunocompromised, high-risk underlying condition) family do, simply really want get sick, may still want take additional precautions widespread nearby outbreak.

What’s big deal wearing mask vaccine uptake higher? care get vaccinated point, want make clear let near children. little information parents children 12? desperately trying determine best course action five year old, every article read, scientists/medical experts ""go feel"". Fuck feelings, want data! wear mask, wear mine well (I vaxxed), want data risks catching someone vaccinated. vaxxed friends hang unvaxxed, need mask around vaxxed people? need wear mask around unvaxxed? CDC says yay, says fast. org correct? listen whomever? still able make clear something... fully vaccinated risk asymptomatic transfer toddler aged child? never find enough info this. vaccinated still wear mask clue I'm potentially harming child going grocery store. wear masks protect yourselves, wear masks protect others unable get vaccinated, like friends' Coronababies

and proven vaccinated people absolutely still catch spread disease

just wear damn masks, people never followed science begin with. did, 600k die. many died Thanksgiving first weeks new years? many sacrifice 1 holiday year stay home. incident go history books tell-all books way highlight importance vaccines.  Yup comes jokes. Thanks understanding bunch. feel you! friends without kids side eye still careful. explain go “ohhhh”. lot people without kids don’t even think it. No, any. curious Uk cases peak. good show case US Europe. hope surpass 50k cases 50 death per day. believe INOVIO only. Wanting less people die fall ill - cool  believe crushing it. Even heavy conservative provinces alright. happens take first shot infected covid19 means first shot useless, one month later take second shot without received first shot first shot wasted infected covid19? sounds dangerous easy mistake could easily happen never see brought anywhere.


The dangerous part scenarios describing person infection. vaccine dangerous really situation. Well, except allergic reactions ingredients vaccine. 

Infections give less predictable level immunity, provide immunity, part sucks need get infected, whole point vaccine avoid issues infected. same. still surplus N95s KN95s trust general public truthful. chances may bordering ""act god"" territory, know one individual that's family friend fully vaccinated yet currently dealing delta variant. long un-vaccinated idiots still roam sans-mask, causing variants, I'm going maskless unless outside. result misinformation. stupidly underestimated effective stuff could be. Turns out, seem trustworthy (come certain background, present material certain way, seem confident), lots people blindly believe tell them. Propaganda works. makes absolutely difference, since CDC issue recommendations. makes sense issue recommendation needed half country ignored half may need it. wore N95 times mostly wore surgical masks purchased CVS (back plentiful pre-pandemic). also turned overhead air vent, too. (Which apparently supposed ... seemed worked fine me.)

So, I'm vaccinated overly concerned getting COVID anymore, upper respiratory illnesses still want avoid. get sick COVID-19? Supply shortages next nothing science though. initial critiques homemade masks based science good data.

And argument CDC others time wasn't, ""We wear masks may enough"" argument was, ""masks unnecessary, ineffective (especially homemade ones) may actually detrimental health""

Now, turned BS influenced science fear supply shortages political interference.

*That's* respond actions rather words:

- China shut economy locked population? taking seriously, I.

- declaring pandemic multiple countries shutting air travel, refuse disembark cruise ship passengers, talking independent disease spread population multiple nations once? pandemic definition, let scientists bowing obvious political pressure get way actual science definition pandemic.

- CDC buying PPP telling us nothing worry need masks N95s? Follow actions rather press releases would feel safer around masked unvaccinated person, unmasked vaccinated person. know cdc supposed political, realize saying vaccinated people need wear mask, they're essentially making one wears mask? messed big time telling vaccinated people need wear masks May 15th. opinion said July 1st, reach X percentage population vaccinated, rescinding mask recommendations vaccinated July 1st reach target, masks. Good luck mask mandates even considered fall winter. shit bed badly. Nope. CDC months late particular party. Months.... think holidays probably effect too. Cases hit high area couple weeks Thanksgiving stayed high second week January. I've 1 dose Moderna bit headache 2 days sore arm 3-4. Honestly fine. Biggest issue arm toss turn sleep kept couple nights. Hoping that's Second dose well. problem science new becoming accurate time. like CDC knows science better WHO, said opposite week.

People say wear masks following science, science shows masks work, new strain contagious.

People understand science, scientists trained public communication like this. difficult relay complex information simple way, especially complex information incomplete. Still needs verified. That’s fair. can’t reasonable places masks required  arms told stay home too. least, ones know were. believe called dunce cap death, tired argument. many kids pre-existing conditions could make prone severe COVID could land hospital leave life-long problems, like asthma. There's nothing wrong parent taking precautions reduce likelihood child experiencing major illness could potentially cost thousands dollars medical expenses. Whatever is, think path toward ""unity."" That's cause way verify person vaccinated anti-vaxxer/anti-masker. thank gov't that, cause chicken enforce vaccination checks letting virus spread. rate delta going affecting non vaccinated, give week. Hard solve labor crisis kill/disable laborers ??? you’re lied great many things. future reference, ""North South"" different meaning we're talking actual country United States

But that's literally point joke. Fauci said ""two Americas"", ""two United States"". quite obviously talking US.  feel article / statement missing important information

- vaccine referring to?
- many days full vaccination safe?

So far thing repeatedly read Pfizer/BioNTech protects Delta variant two weeks second dose understand it, might still get sick, hospitalized, dead prolonged problems. still latest info? vaccines? “To emphasize important vaccinations … one 24 people vaccinated,” NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard told reporters. “I also advise six health workers attended party, fully vaccinated, one people infected.” 
 
The Superspreader event cautionary tale, health officials state New South Wales say, proof country won’t able leave pandemic behind single-digit vaccination rate increases. I'm desperate stop wearing masks 10+ min wearing one entire lower half face gets breakout makes painful sleep lean couch even hair week, spreads entire face gets like takes couple weeks time wear mask face stop hurting non stop. fully vaccinated I'm done constant pain. Random thought: wonder rare hear CDC director throughout this, Fauci far often good point. lot colds going around everyone unmasked area, too. 

I nasty cold two shots got tested twice. nearly bed ridden, convinced covid. negative. Yea I'm Toronto (fully vaccinated Sunday arena). line whole thing insane. also criticized government lot early on, really proved (at lest regard). Yes already got two dose sinovac get third dose Biontech Sinovac. must older 50 eligible third Lol ok, good luck everyone would fine people actually prove vaccinated.

Yep, people actually show vaccinated order go unmasked would completely different conversation. reality see someone unmasked idea vaccinated not. Though see someone wearing mask assume probably vaccinated.  Post hoc ergo propter hoc situation complex make seem. always people susceptible disease unable get vaccines, that's nothing new.

We vaccine new disease everyone able willing get so. far I'm concerned back status quo see perspective sides. think issue go public, zero knowledge vaccinated isn't. Mask wearing (or least was) indication people following science and/or trying safe possible given circumstances, whereas people without masks recently often crazy anti-vaxxers, door lickers, whatever else you, even causing scenes starting arguments people wearing masks. 

It takes time people adjust new normal someone going around unmasked necessarily threat risk health safety.

Personally, already level social anxiety COVID-19, also co-morbidities high risk individual. see someone without mask I'm interested shaming them, want stay hell away me. Granted, I'd rather people masks too, though seeing people masks better stress given last year craziness. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

NO SENSE HUMOUR. Would rather funded private corporations? Lol.

What source information trust then? Career scientists tend take lower-paying jobs public sector deal large amounts public transparency scientists paid megacorp pharmaceuticals medical companies? also tend agree public scientists COVID.

The ones downplaying certain side politics hack/fraudulent/scam “scientists” also peddle things like demon semon causing abortions personal bone marrow curing autism.

So, think unbiased source information COVID is? benefit would government get inflating dangers infection? Seems like seasonality really powerful virus. Look trends countries north south hemispheres. said, agree you, like last winter, many people immunity now. vaccinated, risk serious impact covid practically zero. So, mean way slight toward Brazilian people possible higher rate among children reflective tragic cruel impact things like extreme poverty, malnutrition, slum living conditions favelas, less general access good medical care chunk Brazilian kids?  want continue wear mask whatever reason that’s perfectly fine, power you.

The markets near open maskless, many still wear them. Nearly cashiers do; per favorite's comment, might 30 minutes around us day.

Without asking masks work, told I'm going keep wearing mask there, least rest feel comfortable enough ditch theirs. skin nose makes rest staff ease, not? issue mask mandate place like Vermont rural town Arkansas low vaccination rate.

The issue though people low vaccination rate areas ones need support federal organizations like CDC local government care. Honestly it’s surprising people don’t believe CDC. Seeing get leaned Trump admin push recommendations fit political narratives scientific fact seeing thing Biden. shouldn’t people skeptical CDC?

Hell took CDC year pandemic started admit COVID airborne long countries public health officials saying that. Same, specifically sucks child cannot get vaccinated yet. elastic degrades time, hastened exposure ozone UV rays Hey intern!!

Update site!

Yes, again! Oh no, can't go Alabama... Comparing mRNA injections classic vaccines mistake. Wait what? 3rd dose? driven rural Missouri, shock you. Well they’re addressing different audiences. addressing entire world, much lower vaccination rate US right now. CDC addressing US. 

So vaccinated people US probably fine stop wearing masks, elsewhere world lower vaccination rates it’s probably better idea wear them. freezer then! could county county advisory alert system published advise public on.

If go decade Homeland Security's Terror Threat Level advisory alert system, hell can't thing actual likely life-threatening problem? science says still infected pass virus members community. ones wearing masks vaccinated - they're part community transmission delaying recovery. understanding members community cannot get vaccine due age factors, overcoming pandemic requires community effort. That's it. one questioning science - people want pandemic finally end.   


What understand many sub waste energy whining nothing help increase vaccination rates. flip flops Jimmy Buffett concert Agree! dreadful effects treating real social governance fictional Team Sport cannot overstated. It’s maximizing profits it, literally killing rest us bits pieces. think applies COVID going forward?

Because would *literally* take lifetime everyone vaccinated COVID again, solution make everyone masks long COVID exist? so, that's dumb

""Again""? ""my solution""? pretending said things not?

Because certainly ""my solution"". 

All I'm saying, situation much complex u/Im_The_SPACman's comment made seem. simple morally unambiguous solution.

That said, encouraging many people get vaccinated possible seems necessity. 

Government healthcare programs health insurances certainly major role play here. (""Free vaccinations, coverage COVID get vaccinated could."") special hat people like this. sit corner looking total population instead adult/eligible population?

Percent total population relevant metric want discuss percent people vaccinated since people part population spread COVID whether eligible get vaccine. even point. Good red herring attempt. Gonna lot dead kids fall. truly shocked NotACreepyOldMan scientific bonafides back profanity-filled rants. CDC said buy masks may needed medical professionals. refused label pandemic evidence label pandemic definitions. going follow empirical evidence, can't stop like leading. mask still lowers risk, bother you, wear it. necessary right now, useless 

I get it, marginal benefit much lower vaccinated mRNA shots. breakthrough chance vaccines 1% less, even new strain meaning protection provides scales chance.

It's like wearing helmet going hike, case trip strike temple rock. 

I understand travails past year masks make people comfortable, but, least covid-19, provide tiny benefit shot. Masks new norm 🤷🏾‍♂️  Yes. vaccine I'd either succumbed Covid lost mind now, I'm certain. :) happy get shots. cannot believe something simple become divisive.



If live U.S. like me, one idea two. child taught empathy live life aren’t given everything consequences actions, don’t need experience something understand sympathetic it. world isn’t world. 

Racism alive well even particularly don’t experience it. Also way UK counts Covid death may overstate UK Covid deaths (not sure Russia counts them). Anyone dies within 28 days positive Covid test counted Covid death. hundreds thousands people tested positive last 28 days - plenty die due random, unrelated reasons.

He's moving goal posts. made good point risks getting vaccine versus getting it. Billions vaccines, dude 4 examples billions somehow he's unscientific one replied to? That's weird.

You say got vaccine sure talking points anti-vaxxer. So, I'm bit skeptical. LA, objectively well vaccinated highly infected (in 2020) county make rec? seems like place great position extra cautious? strange sure getting at. said policies made local level areas low vaccination? know areas never restrictions first place, come now. see it, even it’s low reduction odds worth taking it, that’s opinion point.
I guess cultural thing cause discomfort, confusion social ambiguity thing (where come from).
I agree say seatbelts tho, difference see things mainly affect using mask affect others (I’m thinking asymptomatic people, guess that’s specific). wear mask everywhere se literally one else western PA.

I live Western PA vaccine uptake really good around Allegheny county. amount cases probably lowest ever been. Something else consider too, lot people early get vaccine PA traveled Ohio West Virginia. I'm sure people counted towards PA vaccine numbers would probably boost vaccinated numbers bit higher. 

I think lot fear mongering going media scare people vaccinated getting damn jab. I'm sure new variant going breakthrough infections, far MRNA vaccines look holding well variants. I’m afraid get can’t sick couple days afford miss work :/ people Pfizer. man, gotta learn nuance. ""lockdown forever"" option one arguing case. I've done plenty still staying safe including travel, dining out, drinking friends visiting family. big deal throw mask minutes might near people could ask different question - campaigning lower speed limits? known quantity many people live every mph drop speed limit. fuck people?

I get trying say pretty bad analogy. people get vaccinated, vulnerable protected. 

Lowering speed limits bunch variables affect outcome like whether people abide limits, whether limits already safe level area, many people drive area, well new limits going enforced, etc. likely efficient changes made save lives going road changing speed limits feasible change could get implemented well.

tbh, driving pretty dangerous upset people drove less, slower safely. Shocking. won’t find anyone medical medical research professions ever advocate that.

*The UK left chat*

""Let rip 2.0"" full force UK, far tell. correct get worse. apologize. get intense conversations daily old guard. 

It's rough there. long year. 

It's hard seeing loyal employees leave management match pay give reasonable raises, seeing new breed travel nurses insane entitlement complex enter. again, maybe that's attitude floor nurses first place. That's definitely attitude I've adopted concerning salary negotiations. seen travel nurse break $4500/week contract told $60 nails long seen all. Contract break fee $500. Might well let keep nails hospital really need need hospital. 

I know altruism dried up. I'm going continue used abused want get paid privilege. show vaccine card mask gtfo. say it’s time start making examples Covidiots. Saw tv, can't remember channel  Since people Israel vaccinated, half cases vaccinated people consistent pretty high vaccine effectiveness delta variant vs divide. idea today. made mask mirror reflection? way anti-maskers anti-vaxxers looked someone wearing mask would see capable caring person maybe consider better people. still think great guys least room different opinions. Finland often seems one consensus forms everyone adhere it.  German here.... everyone got chance far got vaccinated (in social bubble) still far everyone chance... still close overtaking US now.. guess overtaken US now... Canada crazy quick access vaccine... damn Seems like we‘re getting point vaccine hesitancy overtakes supply constraints important factor. expect find way defector couple years- NK's working population completely decimated. highly recommend planning never going another concert, sporting event, wedding, large gathering really think stay going sorely disappointed.    right thing opinion, fair enough, expect everyone else play along. 

Deep actually think totally wrong, good luck double masking. work made social distancing wearing masks mandatory, though relaxed social distancing, we're Texas. Mask wearing outside work non existent, though still wear mine everywhere go family fully vaccinated probably continue finally reach safe threshold whenever be. one expected increase efficacy? remaining get ""past"" we've already demonstrated we're really going anything avoid pretty terrible outcomes?

I'd say need get past people clutching masks like talisman highly effective vaccines widely available. 33 got AZ, people looked base jumped without parachute, weird... problem? That's nice idea perfect world, employer can't give everyone every time get sniffles cold. Yeah cause unlike believe science CDC... cares WORLD CDC cares USA basically covid areas... fact watch video shows hear line anything else said. USA reason wear masks places anymore agree CDC that. want agree that's you. said every point especially point wearing masks going make less people want get vaccine detrimental cause trying get everyone vaccinated. want keep letting unvaccinated mutate virus keep wearing mask chancing it'll mutate I'm gonna part stupidity. still needed get additional shot Pfizer/AZ get Vac-Pass... Ugh disgusting point exactly. mention work people burn us interest profit rather good patient care. never said that…… ever  someone wear N95 mask parts job -- they're supposed fit tested really ensure they're working. sure would feasible community wear. chances vaccinated people spreading virus exceedingly low.

“A growing body evidence indicates people fully vaccinated mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna) less likely asymptomatic infection transmit SARS-CoV -2 others.” (CDC) someone got J&amp;J shot, would pharmacy allow get mRNA dose boost protection? wait CDC recommends it? Fuck outta shrill rhetoric, bud. protect young body much? already contacted people diagnosed covid ( gradudation party etc.) interacted - zero issues. Also 2 shots protect 100% also. depends human system also, ignoring this. Also push 3 dose soon. we'll Ireland vaccinated travelers certain countries quarantine home unvaccinated hotels expense. Ha! know! I’m proud! dead last vax rates.

This weirdly suprising MS actually number 1 country vaccination rates vaccines like 99.2% vaccinated something like that. heard culture MS people would listen doctors trust them, people would get vaccinated result.

Now, curious two factors here: anti-vaccine propaganda get MS residents keep getting covid-19 vaccine, leadership state denying downplaying covid-19 political strategy using excuse way secure necessary vaccines population? People downvote want true (and description putting far nicely would have) irresponsible state &amp; without pointing **vaccines drastically reduce asymptomatic infection &amp; transmission.**  never ran space back worst times thing completely new 0 people earth immunity, either catching vaccine. would sudden run space now?? Wow, mostly safe effective way prevent catching virus that's spreading community! ""global pandemic"" takes almost 2 years already, becomes necessity point.

I know you, people actually want live lives cower away homes rest lives.

I accept Coronavirus here. point move on. Living life taking risks, every day.

Learn live! approach I'm taking this: look local federal guidelines use whichever restrictive those. CDC might say needed, however local guidelines may restrictive, that's fine.

Vice versa, local government may bought messaging said ""no restrictions!"", case federal guide would restrictive two.

Eventually, local federal guidelines become less less restrictive, they're finally waived. then, im happy wear mask even though I'm fully vaxxed because

1) serve example others
2) people still vaxxed yet
3) People know vaccine status want present well. look numbers per state basis, many rising.

Of course won’t bad was, states going get hit hard, especially winter comes. UK COVID update: Biggest one-day increase 5 months, 61% last week

- New cases: 26,068
- Average: 19,296 (+1,419)
- hospital: 1,798 (+82)
- ICU: 287 (+3)
- New deaths: 14

Population vaccinated:
- 1st dose: 66.95% (+0.21)
- 2nd dose: 49.21%  doctorate good university,

Your comment makes debatable. case science seems be... limited? sync countries experience Delta variant?

“Vaccinated” blanket statement everyone received vaccine, matters. demographics. vaccines stand Delta variant. 

It also ignores despite vaccination, absolutely still affected Delta variant. numbers greatly reduced saying you’re “safe”... feels like it’s implying level immunity isn’t there. 

The US still much higher total vaccination places accounts varies widely community level. *Reads black american*... w/e nothing new fair don’t think it’s there’s exact scientific definition “safe”, yeah really seems like people irrational fear infection despite odds pretty minuscule, like way lower risk profile stuff. depends “seeing” is. distant masked, sure, sounds safe. Good thing unvaccinated America always shitty America. That's am. sucks knowing can't trust people around every single day. Remind admitted aerosol transmission thing? mention stockholders demanding perpetual growth dividends. thing happened Asian Americans start pandemic. nearly eradicated anyways thanks childhood vaccination programs.

Yea...why think applies COVID going forward? again, solution make everyone masks long COVID exist? so, that's dumb retail sales N95

No one even considered workers hazardous environments need N95 masks part PPE. work construction company hell trying get masks guys. fully vaccinated person will:

Continue wear masks public transit (it's required anyways, would also choose to).

If case counts area start growing high, may choose well. Luckily think happen state!

Otherwise going mostly maskless unless required. think huge debate. smart. last year half literal PAIN. going go again. fully vaccinated masks lol don’t want infected bringing virus crowded vaccine center. It’s relevant message 4 months ago now, that’s why. top that, you’re sick covid, vaccines won’t help anyways. Exactly, believe firefighters save you, wait fire burn out. world happened people accept willingly even wish to) visage see human faces anymore forever established? Last heard much rare originally thought. Same, want good role model kids especially since going pain convince otherwise they're school. also like wearing mask lol Everyone different experiences throughout thing colors viewpoint. happen share experience person replied to, viewpoint unfortunately coming bitter angry place anti-mask/anti-vax crowd point. also coming place finally feeling like agency safety. understand that, call people selfish. infection virus, provides least much protection single dose vaccine. lot countries require one dose vaccine people prior infection, since infection obviously provides high degree immunity. fact don't. specifically variants. data used May September 2020. safe quotation marks?  started wearing mask work right pandemic kicked off, looking much better countries Asia (that mask). 

I finally stopped due harassment co-workers told masks dont work heard TV. even spread masks make worse. Happens. never get zero cases. take cases live them. long hospitals overcrowded ok. ""that apply countries highly vaccinated mRNA vaccines""

What Israel higher mRNA vaccination rates deciding enforce masks again?

""That count CDC said wanted hear"" love god though need stop narrative fully vaccinated people chose forgo masks assholes don’t care others , wanna kill grandma children, whatever talking point we’re today.

Honestly though, people far fewer, much less harmful obnoxious anti-vaxxers holdouts relying ridiculous interpretations science. Oh fuckoff I'm boat. still wear mine I'm out, I've ully vaccinated Moderna since March. thing worry getting passing son. He's 5 also sacrificed lot fair keep safe. Throwing kn95 bit store hurt. can't wait get shots. Dentistry cost zero you. absolutely absurd thing say. either paying taxes, make less paycheck. Even parents pay it, family afford less overall case, paying one way another. let's say cost nothing. Start shitting pants wear diaper. Much efficient get go another room every time need shit. dispose diaper go take shower. Super efficient. there's scientific evidence virus become deadlier, 

Where scientific evidence *won't*? emerging evidence Delta variant infectious, also causes severe disease.

How long get mutation escape vaccine-induced immunity? already concerns - - Delta possibly so. us divided country insanely polarized politics. 300 million people lot people get page. 

There’s nothing wrong things symbols think it’s actually good thing. Cultures cool way saying lot that... many got first dose one vaccine, left choice either wait second dose vaccine get different vaccine right away.

There couple countries world supply still biggest bottleneck vaccinations. Even masks reduce amount respiratory droplets inhale improve course illness. wear kN95s, they’re better, don’t want catch mild COVID. public indoors. think it’s rational stand it.  really tell people vaccine cause heart freak non-stop body developing resistance. idea new bit funny.

The change previously persecuted groups power speak say something people actually listening.

Previously, ignored tragedies encouraged.

An element sensationalism grown, particularly media, talk older black folk ask hatred new. hope lift requirement though, took 2 flights hour couple weeks ago acne went starting get better bad cashier tried recommend dermatologist (like red puffy part face oozing time worst it) hear ""just piece cloth"" wearing one makes selfish uncaring person. wanna cool!!! yet peer-reviewed preprint, one might need take grain salt: Many people shown vulnerable misinformation, shockingly so. 90% people would prefer people get heads asses. outside source countries write us :)

Gotta learn someone's mistake  seriously understand craze Ivermectin, supposedly cure-all drug. point relevant, peer-reviewed studies show amazing is? think there's difference hoping die caring do. think general consensus fucked around, find Lab based studies practically worthless kind thing ESPECIALLY talking 3-year old wearing it. care real-world results studies looked them, happens flow particles putting cloth mannequin whatever. probably good place start far decent layman-level review literature March last year. LMAO true trenches? Jobs chose work? 

Nurses? things nurses less work. Taking care dead? Seems like time spent preventing dead would help taking care dead vs letting pile sounds like something meteor heading toward earth would say. see slowing yet.

[Check daily number vaccinations Germany falling continuously last 2 weeks. First-dose vaccinations rising moment, second doses falling quicker. large number recent vaccine shipments first-dose vaccination *should* higher. clear present danger anti-vaxxers, attention focused. November 2020 mandate came bunch stuff like restrictions restaurants everything. responsible drop cases. Everyone already wearing masks long time then.

It's like could go anywhere without mask prior November. Practically every business policy. Translink's August mask policy meant half population needed mask go anywhere.

The difference 'mandate' 'recommendation' near negligable BC criticize vaccinated wearing masks, town less half adults vaccinated. Despite easy access vaccines.

Honestly I've wearing mask mostly solidarity workers still to. think likely it'll anywhere near last winter was. may increase now, even lower vaccine areas, think unlikely we'll see anything like December 2020 Sauce ? That's insane, imagine Covid 1.0 R naught 8, panic would massive  #THE LAND here, focus person doing, 100% problem. 

If vaccinated, matter person doing. unlikely get breakthrough infection (even new variants), unlikely severe case, unlikely pass on. 

It's frankly none business everyone else doing. That’s stupidest thing I’ve ever heard. sticky please bring damage ""narratives"" back elaborate character made justify arguments. Ironic. We'll know full impact pandemic deaths 1-2 years now, we'll able analyse historical record pandemic records deaths, many ppl died without tested died diseases, ICU available simply afraid going doctor stopping treatments. guess we'll see current death numbers increase quite lot we're finally able study properly.  counties vaccination rate 80% counties 30%. one-size-fits-all approach appropriate. 

Also, go approach, even conservative (aka continue masking, etc).  surprisingly rough either time, also COVID beforehand. Listen I’m listening CDC, can’t see masks harm I, fully vaccinated adult, going continue wear mask.  take seriously like entire pandemic. remember every god damn step way. ""Well can't assume airborne"" like every single aspect painted brightest light.

People want wear masks pandemic continue paint whatever picture want instead considering possibilities. Yes, people forming opinions based “heard” random redditor, random news article, confidently giving others information online they’ve vetted checked sources, one worst problems brought light entire pandemic. Entire droves people idea fuck talking about, saying things confidently “I heard that’s works”. Like said, get caring. That's I'm talking about, really care either. I'm actively hoping die, quite people are. Certainly all, vocal subset sure. ignorant, self-centered anti-vaxxers like around. guess using masks? reports delta transmission people wearing masks? Australia enough little cases get good contact tracing, good data this. Funny “trust science” people suddenly don’t trust science. takeaway hope people start wearing masks sick cold flu. chance put action -- caught non-COVID still nasty cold bug, mask wearing still normal, popped go store. nice know walking around store, spreading nasty cold germs everyone, let's honest, cold sucks ass. think people afraid say this. NYT article speaking general ability assess risk.  charge assessing people's risk children, worry viewing rationally. automobile example one. another HUGE one flu. general flu similar risk long term damage children, covid. normal behavior ( best normal) kids school flu season rages. reason distant learning always always prevent kids ( low risk) spreading teachers ( higher risk) . use risk assessment layer vaccines. rational. "" selfish bc kid can't get vaxxed"" 
 encourage everyone really dig risk assessment coming article cite actually points [Walensky] also criticize Los always said local policymakers need make policies local environment,"" said. sadly holiday travel risk. Trinity county rural expensive, people travel Redding Shasta County Eureka Humboldt County go Walmart, cheaper gas etc. 


Well counties also 30% vaccination they're right major interstate highways (I-5/101)

I bad feeling winter coming. Yes, that's said. 

We also ""currently"" meteor headed toward earth. Maybe insufferable literally trying ruin country / hinder ability live life fullest I'd care more. also decade preemptive mental health care abandoned. Reagan-era policies damaged literally everyone without money; it’s class divide truly began cleave.  bit point get Moderna get booster others end decent protection margin. That's huge relief successful vaccine distribution enables clinical practitioners mix match. US ~50/50 calculation pretty close right (which, record, said ""roughly""--I exact calculation). Masks necessary vaccinated. important distinction made enough. live state 37% population fully vaccinated rarely see people wearing masks. vaccinated wearing mask anti-masker. ok pop coloring books masks never protecting yourself, unless wearing N95. USA can’t go backward masks. People wouldn’t stand it.

I agree sentiment, quite astounding people tolerate US. might wear mask circumstances change? Absolutely not. I'm taking stand! 600K dead, millions made sick injured? Sure, ok. inevitable (it absolutely wasn't).

I feel like people obsess masks gives sense control they're otherwise powerless. 80 COVID deaths population 96 million, like Vietnam, real control fate looks like. Getting decide whether wear mask indoors, much. :)  I’m vaccinated two young children. wearing mask lowers chance spread them, I’ll continue wear masks. It’s small sacrifice make benefit vaccinated. confirmed via genomic sequence compare obesity? It’s either/or choice, it’s entirely possible protect kid covid obesity. 

Let’s apply logic: don’t try control child’s weight, drug addiction far deadly anyway. Pretty unrelated, don’t ya think? Ignoring refusing vaccination creates variants. can't mutate without hosts.  Ok? Well hand washing never bad thing fair yeah that’s Covid spreads really think there's also multiple ways looking it. individual perspective, vaccinated comfortable wearing it, there's reason wear it. unlikely spread get infected. public policy perspective, still think 70% whatever goals states right decision. There's feasible way enforce masks people vaccinated, enforce everyone vaccination rate high enough protect can't vaccinated.

For personally, know I'm going ditch mask obsessive hand washing, I'm going judge shame anyone vaccinated they're wearing unless there's massive new variant basically nullifies vaccines. leaves vaccinated, thank much. Nice job triggering automod btw. I'm fun here. Nah, like career good work. may fine good, pay stupidity higher insurance premiums lack health care facilities? seen many mutations first world countries . mention you’re unvaccinated still risk giving vaccinated extremely effective 100% really hard know either way regarding hospitalisations, data unvaccinated death rates pretty telling. Delta fizzer even remotely scary people trying make seem Yea, understand non-sensical comments. Like comparing smartphone brands something. use exactly mRNA patent. Lol. Whoosh. Gotcha. I'm saying that, find weird desparate seem wear mask comes 10 minute bus ride shopping 30 minutes. me, mild inconvenience benefits downsides. 
On technical point, tell someone without mask vaccinated? Here, everyone still wear mask shopping using public transport sure first ones stop would anti-vax people, lift fully vaccinated ok  Fuggem all. trust 2019 2020?  I’m pretty sure masks mandated LA. “strongly recommended” again.  Yup. I'm still using N95 situations, 85% 100 - one hell lot better 0. Congressman slams congressman B way see masks can’t last forever. know there’s going people never get vaccinated. knew year ago know now. mind, determine what’s risk level want accept

Most people risk really low right country vaccinated affect people, covid affects vaccinated person. kids immunocompromised people? hate responsible idiots wouldn’t want responsible killing innocent person selfish reasons. kids immunocompromised people? hate responsible idiots wouldn’t want responsible killing innocent person selfish reasons.  suggest follow science yourself.

Here's good way spell you: half country still unvaccinated, leave you?

If want mature response, try stupid facetious. year, COVID sufficiently spread. Playing around anymore gonna cause variants US, bad maybe fall. DUDE TEST I'LL WEAR TWO! Nah I'm kidding part. wear mostly spite though. mom immunosuppressed know antibodies yet. specific target necessity argument. Im making argument -a- target, rather ""ah well I'd got vaccinated go mask off, yet, pinky promise keep wearing one!!"". do, though trend vaccines becoming slowly less effective newer variants concerning. Covid keep mutating large pools unvaccinated people, keep churning variants, turn makes likely increasingly vaccine resistant variants emerge dominate. Canada almost highest vaccination rate world. doubt we’ll mask mandates back issue justification person, would never get covid first place affected it, dies vaccine. Seems unnecessary me. Trying bring back aggressive public health measures post-vaccine would tough

It would super serious situation get public compliance, every country would take drastic turn worse like India months ago California December January convince majority people “stay home much possible” again. 

I’m saying selfish, I’m realistic. Even lot people lived like hermit pre-vaccine probably won’t super enthusiastic again. I've got definition you, THANK YOU!!!! Israel decided something mean every government going thing. can’t believe many sub think way. Today’s CDC announcement proved saying here. Yet still spread supposedly vaccine, difference make you’re vaccinated not? You’re still capable spreading it, you’re still capable dying it. 

It’s pointless argument. Following ‘science’, death rate vaccinated unvaccinated delta variant 0.08%. Going science one needs wear mask small percentage typical alarmist statement, serves push bipartisan narrative get people others throats time need united ever. extremely unprofessional say this, extremely par course CNN publish That’s like saying masks aren’t 100% effective they’re anywhere close that. Especially without physical distancing people don’t do

Vaccines much effective. Covid never - least short term - going eradicated seems poor advice.

The variant causing pretty rapid case growth U.K. still national restrictions fully vaccinated US. thoughts regarding deliberately sabotaging inside? Even minor innocuous stuff like working slowly, etc. do?  wont cover face anti vaxxer idiots, sorry. examining effects delay 45 weeks first second doses study participants, results demonstrated antibody levels increased delayed second dose. Masks getting covid.

Most people hospital unvaccinated, all. don’t “have” . 

You shrug, laugh, move on…. Like sane individual 

Covering face cloth soul purpose spiting idiot quite frankly bizarre Lower what? Lower Alpha variant? Maybe that's majority adults vaccinated least 1 dose since then...

The link cases, hospitalisations deaths broken due vaccinations. great looking data detail need look context behind it. Novavax provides spike protein instead cells make it. Sounds better limited amount spike protein.   movie, new variant would mutate 80% mortality rate decimate unvaccinated population.

Let's hope come that. think sane people would agree everyone get shots (immunocompromised, children, etc. can't yet) 50% whatever eligible people country going cause problems don't. They're ones dragged whole COVID thing time ones spread killed 600k Americans. I'm sick anyone else.

However, people often jobs, impact lives rest us even we're fully vaccinated. Imagine moment poultry processing plant 50% vaccination rate among employees. COVID starts spread (which happen multiple rounds) percentage 50% sick once. let's say production 10% week. Next week, would normal week 15% even employees sick ones last week come back. point, would hole 25% people start coming back ramp production back up.

In real world suspect industries high vaccination rates rates much lower 50%. people totally wreck economy account way. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Unfortunately everyone going suffer consequences. heard someone describe pandemic “group project hell” couldn’t agree more. referring to? actually underperformed market percentage wise 2020 far 2021 Well, one figure balloon, government probably try figure things are, see reason worry it. particular, aliens seems pretty unlikely. Vaccines end game, people aren’t following through. Like said, stacking odds breakthrough infection basic mathematics, since you’re vaccinated basic precautions offer even protection would unvaccinated person. third they’re actually valued at

They're valued that, traveling nurses valued that. nurses quit become traveling nurses? Oh, want ideal job situation people? made money peers industry sat home office every day went home families comfortable beds every night, traveled around country project sites. sucks away home living hotel weeks even months time work valued even though technically held title coworkers. make underpaid, makes paid valued at. totally get that. That’s decision I’m fine it. Especially since son high risk it’s personal decision. That’s risk level determine. gets lot people people think vaccinated individuals mask assume don’t care people don’t. However, note still get Covid going regular mask think there’s rest face that’s uncovered. 

Hope son get vaccinated soon possible I'm ok that. wall unvaccinated regions already? everywhere Europe. continents even worse. Fwiw we've seen kind transmission multiple jurisdictions Australia, 2 Perth's 3 transmissions described ""fleeting"", one brief interaction pub setting (exact nature stated - privacy, knows), 5 minutes (described ""a single workout set"", gym).

Additionally, party 30-40 individuals (exact count stated), 26 caught 1 case, along regular reports ""now whole household gets it"".

Which happen before.  i’m hoping too, best hope things kick quickly possible! stay healthy safe! science also says chances happening enough keep mask mandate fully vaccinated individuals.

Not disageeeing generally, “science” doesn’t say anything mask mandates. That’s policy decision based “science” (*e.g.*, statistical probability vaccinated individuals contracting virus), unless conflate anything CDC says “science.” always hated “follow science” mantra. UK too. 85% adults least one dose now. pretty bad response pandemic whole one thing got right vaccine rollout. Thankfully uptake seems really high comparison nations too.  **need** worry anything. risk tolerance choice. worry risk shark attack want, people don't.

The risk zero, extremely small, especially immunocompromised. routinely take larger risks daily lives. referring people claim know covid dangerous, meanwhile spouting crap conspiracy nuts screaming since covid day one. so-called experts deniers refer to. Man, sounds like lot people central US. LA's COVID cases jumped 50% past ten days want slam brakes now. Regardless whether vaccinated people really need one, making mandatory everyone practical way get unvaccinated people wear one that's they'll do.

If people want put masks completely past, onus unvaccinated part. think dental care period would cost? time spend doctor's there's opportunity cost well? really think interested efficiency. People general need mind business. Everyone vaccinated. still choose wear mask, great. Maybe unvaccinated see mask themselves. don’t want wear mask vaccinated, fine. 

People sub spend way much time criticizing vaccinated still wearing masks. health insurance companies going start increasing rates COVID states? Hey least smack talk getting better! look definition pedantic maybe take english classes. Except small problem schools open technically summer US. School longer starts early/mid September month earlier states. time vaccines kids, school probably session 4 6 weeks, 6-week lag full protection kicks assuming everyone gets 1st shot day 1 availability &amp; follows schedule. vaccines least stop winter/spring 2022 surge. Maybe really problem? Maybe I'm drinking much 'collapse kool-aid'? mature response. suggest follow science outdoors transmission.  argument scientist working real time almost data got things wrong can’t possibly things right massive amounts data? *Play stupid games...* Wow hysteria doom this

It’s almost like science saying What's average age mortality covid compared average life expectancy? We're like, 2-3 months away almost inevitable approval kids though. 4 weeks that, able huge chunk least partially vacinated. also couple kids, also still mask family-style public, even though wife fully vaccinated. 

Your analogy pretty sound quite cover specific situation. Since wear masks first, adults need anymore, would really hard kiddos understand STILL wear dumb things faces parents don't. 

Not kids may like ours, there's much disappointment still can't figured small kindness Team Mask feel like mom dad living still bubble boys.   precisely I’m continuing mask— two unvaccinated kids home. I’m Florida much bullshit going risk it. feel like CDC willfully endangering kids politics. Everyone mask fatigue unless shift “honor system” actually checking vaccine status, kids victims this. don’t see indoor mask use high traffic places like stores, schools, dr offices can’t compromise. take kids daycare puts risk Me: ""you mean like civil war?""

Fauci: ""that's exactly mean"" Well I'm vaccinated CDC says masks, wearing mask unless business requests do. 

If CDC learns something new future, I'll follow guidelines. raise good points, counter point anti-vaxxers get sick die, problem literally fixes lives deserve saving actually get saved long run Also national/state education policy elevates STEM education economic national security reasons without ever thoughtfully considering cost de-emphasizing arts humanities.

The arts help develop imagination. humanities learn people lives different think feel. Together, critical part developing empathy people outside narrow slice world, giving capacity imagine lives like recognize common humanity.

STEM humanities get worst Silicon Valley produces: bunch tech solves problems techies absolutely regard affects rest humanity. Couple things: outcomes all, lasting effects, preventable disease something take seriously. would expect your, assumably medical, coworkers care long term affects slightly less severe death. Secondly, really address saying. us benefiting brave enough risk initial vaccine trials. wait longer people potentially reveal negative outcomes vaccine anything differently people vaccinated now. different levels risk. Thirdly, getting vaccine mitigating risk. That's sell people. ultimately goal eradicate disease herd immunity. exist society comes benefits also comes obligations. 79 percent less likely exposure get infected unvaccinated person. VAST MAJORITY vaccinated people last 18 months scary AF. still feeling traumatized, legitimate. Everyone different risk aversion thresholds. 

Many us point doing/have done do, willing accept whatever minimal risk contracting virus, much less becoming seriously ill die it. Thank god woman guts speak truth middle media feeding frenzy. insane amount hype they've assigned delta variant people acting like we're middle massive wave, reality case counts lower ever point pandemic. Reality longer applies. dont give peer pressure problem new variants arise, possible vaccine protect variants. also fully vaccinated, new variant begins spreading area, I'm fully prepared go back masking, bother slightest. Oh, sorry misunderstood you! I’m getting second shot July I’m see world sure! That’s really scary. know variant have, vaccine? anything wouldve made responsive vaccine? can’t believe they’re tracking breakthroughs. live like forever then? currently legal, violates basic principles caring sick, politically impossible. Take pick. Oh man didn’t know nice I’m 1 week first shot that’s relief, thanks! Reddit media want people believe people won’t get vaccine trump loving Americans. actual numbers say otherwise. I'm still wearing damn mask... policy workers wearing I'm wearing it. helps care either way wearing masks. care anyone's, care theirs? ones putting under-12s risk, responsible people vaccinated. Leave us this. Since CDC, assume applies US. wonder that's also case vaccines given U.S. like Sputnik, Sinovac, etc. Coronavirus 2: Electric Boogaloo talking about? Physical activity mask sucks. sweat starts early relentless. glad vaxxed wear shit starting reach 100*f area. footage showed transfer virus two people 

I always though virus microscopic 3 years old definitely get spread diseases. Lots kids bring home colds flu's daycare. Masks biggest benefit preventing spread, even cloth ones filter/limit amount exposed degree. Reddit anti trump propaganda. Plenty pro trump people gotten vaccine. Even look numbers age group. least vaccinated group 18 30 range… typical trump fan, typical Reddit loving democrat. Im fully vaccinated stopped wearing mask. part throughout whole last year. wore mask everywhere, didnt see friends, barely saw family. time, saw many people strut around like hot shit wearing mask taking precautions all. People plenty time get vaccine point. Im gonna keep wearing mask group people even bare minimum stop spread last year. get sick, thats them. Turkey decided 50+ population healthcare workers get third booster shots starting tomorrow. given Sinovac 6 months ago vaccine, choose Pfizer-BioNTech, Sinovac Sputnik. Yeah, know exactly much protection AstraZeneca gives first shot Pfizer already 90% immunity first 2 shots.

Well 2 weeks first shot.  It’s hard teach people think society beneficial even them. are, living technology knowledge previous current generations. Living longer lives less diseases (apart damn pandemic), living ways enjoy life, etc. think live island cave themselves, surviving own, could. can’t people. Human beings rely other, matter separated others. It’s like, teach that, teach that? Yes you’re right, “other nations” mainly meant USA/France etc. UK bit head start many EU countries seem quickly catching up, can’t wait able travel again! That's one metrics looking for. area higher vaccination rate, I'd stop wearing now. I've least started allowing go concerts, grocery shop, etc. feel certain enough cases low enough area yet. work tourist town. Delta's primary symptoms headaches, runny noses, sore throats fevers, probably pay attention get strong headache.

&amp;#x200B;

It's $10/test, heath department probably ships free. shows top symptom reported people 40 headache, followed sore throat, runny nose fever. 
A cough fifth most-common symptom, loss smell longer cracks top protection first shot 2 part shot? comment get deleted? Lol come on. Wild believe another country could surpass us? No, least. Wild believe country could surpass us technology decades ahead without anyone knowing? Yes, extremely wild unlikely. I'm kind happy mass panic. kind figured religious folks would arms even care. would've really liked general excitement though least entirely aware fast spreading dry air indoor heated spaces make people susceptible respiratory virus, rapid spread get worse among unvaccinated. 


Me, I'll get seasonal flu shot always go back wearing mask indoors. COVID precautions kept flu time low numbers last season. Hold masks folks, flu rise again.  huge difference “you can’t can” (driving car) “you thing don’t to” (wearing mask) really compare need data death rates countries low vaccination rates. Unfortuntately lot places reliable publishing data.

Delta probably super scary young healthy people, doesnt mean without risks definitely much contagious risk infected delta much higher variants there's plenty data proving that. Stay safe :) ""don't shit people"" key here.

If people vaccinated, proceeding level caution comfort. get you’re saying, felt way long ago, I’ve taking risks lately realized hiding covid despite vaccinated hurt quality life much. 

Small things. Like went breakfast last week sat outside. dine inside. That’s low risk activity, zero risk. worth it. Deliveries pfizer slowing down. moved Q4 forward Q2 due expanded production capacity, lead Q2 surge EU. expect EU numbers slow down, merely due lower supply immediate future. Anecdotally, I'm vaxed still wearing mask tested positive.

They tested variant, know ten thirty days sure Delta. Longer time doses first dose already provides quite good protection longer time doses people get first dose faster gets us better herd immunity really important. many countries Europe doing, although like 6-12 weeks 45 weeks. based % fully vaccinated population infected delta variant within time period studied. 2nd one. study linked I’m long continue unvaccinated. would listen someone better track record. pretty difficult compare efficacy vaccines across countries accurately fall within margin error Definitely missing context.

I jealous.

We verge “will live it.” comment hilarious. did, fact, get downvoted hell, response said exactly talked great. think rainbow flag lack discernible body shape/gender already proves beyond reasonable doubt. think dental care period would cost?

Zero time spend doctor's there's opportunity cost well?

Not much opportunity cost clock. really think interested efficiency.

I really think know enough personal situation make assumption. good kf94s readily available children's sizes.  wanted do, get vaccinated wear mask anymore. don’t care people do. Sigh. 
 
And that's say that. People stop wearing seatbelts airbags installed cars.

Just wear masks bit longer. use ""you"" first sentence place, I'm one whose time wasted. data seen says children are, part, unaffected minor symptoms super spreaders. exceptions this, aggregate children fair pretty well covid. want accept reality 

""Why everyone get vaccinated?"" 

I know, everyone stop mean everyone else live world full peace harmony? like people understand live planet full humans good comes bad. true vaccinated people getting sick Delta Variant  Pft, live Florida allergy season. There’s way I’m testing every week expense. I’m vaccinated, threshold definite testing less before: fever. 

Now I’m really tired strong coughs, I’d probably test I’m going worry minor issues. 

For it’s worth, always wear good self-protective mask inside businesses despite crappy looks nasty comments get it.  FDA likely give full approval vaccines?  friend's grandma got first covid symptoms hours getting first shot, apparently unknowingly exposed days worker refused vaccine. survive.  would care people think? Honestly, best time wave. Get people sun getting vitamin D. is, nuts get vaccine.  already said masks aren’t needed vaccinated people. stick that?  mean, comfortable wearing mask, that’s fine. shouldn’t berate belittle people things science allows do.

The CDC science aren’t saying *shouldn’t* wear masks you’re vaccinated. It’s saying *should*.

If vaccinated want wear mask can, okay that. one saying not.

But you’re vaccinated science says *should* wear mask.

That’s difference.

Not everyone going things science says do. instance, take pizza. science says *should* eat pizza. going stop eating it? go back mask mandates? kill fence thinking getting vaccine wanting anymore Ugh, feel same. exhausting.

I wear mask I'm social situation (e.g. meeting people garden) cost outweighs benefit. 

However, note UK Δ variant growing exponentially despite high vaccine uptake, [although vaccination excellent protecting serious disease, less 100% effective preventing infection, even mild case COVID-19 think people wear masks default crowded asocial situations (e.g. public transport), benefits generally outweigh harms. expect people wear masks pub, harms probably outweigh benefits, (at least people vulnerable probably going pub first place).   Yeah.....there's lot conflicting things said. point half wonder cdc even knows proper response. Well, consider eligible population vs total population, entirely fair comparison. 65% adults US vaccinated least 1 dose moment. Still lot worse Europe end at.  director cdc contradicting WHO?

I promise let know moment get side effect. use self-protective n95 quality masks. 

Locating pandemic basically survival skill Florida. can’t rely strangers care family. Nothing changed respect. one cares variants. Yes, Betty stay home, also receive government-mandated (and maybe paid) minimum number sick days. Lots vaccinated people know love people vaccinated - children 12 older yet. people supposed do? Well, sunshine roses, I'd rather know might facing. probably dense epidemic-ish soon. No, said looked find anything regarding rates infection/hospitalization/death unvaccinated population vs vaccinated population. seen data like that? I'd love informed. Wasn’t rough either sore arm tired never Covid Yes let's keep sending mixed signals... Ffs.

Sucks came something. Since 2 month period wonder one illness took fully go away. think lot immune systems might need rebuild bit little exposure germs past year COVID-19 related sanitation, distancing, masking etc. Vaccines don’t ability weaken immune system make susceptible illnesses 2 likely aren’t connected. drive kids car successfully live lives. take eat inside restaurant prior receiving vaccinations. One necessity not. thing. yet Europe. least NL, appointments still fully booked next weeks so. 30 younger starting get vaccinated basically. approved vaccine 12-17, busy vaccination clinics well august think. comment replying essentially idiots don’t get vaccine. plenty educated people (like myself) waiting longitudinal studies come out.

Agenda 21 bye bye Honestly, glad wear mask anymore live, humidity always insanely high hot Hades. sweating mask winter. weak immune system(assuming) wouldnt cause vaccine sort backfire infect virus instead helping it?

I know scientifically kind impossible, trying make sure. you’re saying haven’t seen data topic think CDC, massive amount research data, handled incorrectly? case, much frustrating opinion changed affected personally.

There's ***real*** chance passed someone else, turn may gotten people sick, forth. 

Someone chain could sustained life threatening complications even died covid. 

And could started ***this guy***.

Almost like someone saying, ""I drive drunk car amazing air bags safety features. ***I*** get hurt."" ignoring fact could hurt others.  I’m clear mean coronavirus Pfizer sinovac. there’s coronavirus either. worried exposure virus, Pfizer/biontech contains virus it. Jealous lol  Isn’t crazy we, country, never increased supply convinced people benefits better masks? mask haters I’ve asked hate crappy cloth mask use. use high quality imported masks they’re much comfortable. mention effective.  hate it, too! LOL circulates air supposed keep viruses lingering near you. Weirdly wife got Phizer got Moderna. 

She worse side effects me, even though expected opposite. 

Luck draw seems. add this, science monolith. 

Science perfect. 

Science designed us look surroundings learn it. means perspective, knowledge may change time goes on. That's science works. 

The data shows fully vaccinated safe delta variant. 

Vaccines safe effective. 

It wholly possible future variants could change understanding, we're yet data eventually bare gets point. SNIP SNAP SNIP SNAP!!!!!  news, everyone wear seatbelts died crashed car. many died? *Six vaccinated people recent party suburb Sydney, Australia ones didn’t test positive COVID-19, according health officials.*

Vaccines work. percentage people vaccinated, yet got sick. I've vaccinated months, still mask work share office space anti-vaxxer stopped masking state (FL) repealed statewide mask mandate.

Most coworkers (small business; fewer 20 full-time employees) vaccinated, least 2 people vaccinated. Well, number coworkers may may vaccinated can't/won't ask, KNOW LEAST 2 2+ households.

I can't make mask up, myself.

I care much people skeptical vaccine (I respect that) would mask long-term data satisfy them. 

Anti-vax anti-mask; both! believe turned micro plastic UV radiation. Yeah know anti vaxers wearing masks either R currently estimated 1.2 1.4. increasing vaccinations bring down. Fully ending lockdown push up. hope R 1 - I'd guess mid August (at best). sure schools breaking affect it. This. mean, get people hate Trump, applauded dropping funding them. awful, see much better today. CDC, warts all, least corrected diligently made honest effort be... well... honest. heard before? People really err side caution nonsense saw last year. course see huge uptick overall population. Even us getting vaccinated, would enough slow rate infection, obviously. I'd interested see *unvaccinated* populations doing, seen data yet. you?  Toni robins? effective, however, nobody say safe. report safety. remember CVST incidence 10.5/1M, one person every 100 thousand doses. also turned overhead air vent, too. (Which apparently supposed ... seemed worked fine me.)

Really? Why? know purpose. turn freeze death lol hate thing 2.1 fold reduction efficacy. 2.1 fold reduction neutralizing titers (antibodies). translates reduction vaccine efficacy complicated directly obvious. certainly linear relationship anything. variants previously investigated Pfizer, reduction antibodies factor corresponded small reduction efficacy. Even parents pay it

Oh, makes sense now. kid. Adults even consider 1 month

Oh, yeah, definitely kid. Well, I'll see later. people going wear rest lives. OK want do. first fever chalked immune system weakened leaving house year. point getting ridiculous amount days I've sick since getting shot. Agreed. There’s still much learning especially variants. 

I’m fully vaxxed son. 

Still, many people around aren’t. 
I wouldn’t want unintentionally infect someone would hate bring home unvaccinated kids. 

So still sanitize like mofo wear mask everywhere. That's exact thing we're doing. wife wearing masks, four kids 8 also wearing masks. We're we're worried them. We're we're example them, solidarity. trivial thing - I'm perfectly satisfied continue it. says lot judging others based hobbies actually feeling disappointed choice.

You need reevaluate.  understand wearing mask personal protection vaccine? Yeah argument everyone wear can’t tell it’s making safer wear mask Mixed messages abound. Make mind CDC! need masks, wear masks, need masks vaccinated, still need mask vaccinated, need masks vaccinated...

It's like eggs.

Good you. problem lies people treat fully vaccinated individuals chose wear mask assholes don’t give shit others. New flash, got vaccine, that’s help others.

How differentiate unmasked person public vaccinated anti-masker/anti-vaxxer? sure can't, states banned ability check vaccinations.

Yea right sec going hedge funds. I'll stick mask thanks   tried talking kid’s pediatrician? talked fully vaxxed try figure navigate next months. Fwiw, told safe unvaccinated kids unmasked indoors around vaccinated adults, play unmasked unvaccinated kids outdoors. Otherwise avoid crowded places wear mask. Everything else depends personal risk tolerance well local vaccination transmission rates. J&amp;J Yeah think takes step far. They're comparing pele scoring goals fan wearing lucky shirt.. 

to someone getting vaccinated something time get vetted like normal vaccines (understandably so) person concerned getting sick 3 times 50 days after? really sure even make comparison okay sure. Trump made political, people hate Trump believed masks magic result. 

Vaccines much effective masks it’s totally separate conversation. recommendation 3rd come out?  wee primarily protecting others, provide mild reduction ability pick viral load others.

If vaccinated, mask would add last bit 1% protection vaccination alone leaves open. scary. lady small hometown(no one taken seriously unfortunately) caught virus. downplaying fb ICU. died two days later. Washington fully reopening today, hope means gym finally going drop mask requirement working out. They've hung longer gyms can't it, far uncomfortable. I'm excited finally FINALLY get back gym routine. Moderna boy here, damn right does! watch MLB, umpires near 1st 3rd still mask up, often one near them, outdoors. This! BS maverick freedom fighter expense humanity one thing. reason. also reported Guangzhou China Singapore delta variant outbreaks. one trust sources non western countries, mistakes repeated again.

It's still excuse. Stop child. Note cannot get good results FFP2 (N95 equivalent) FFP3 (N99 equivalent) wearing wrong, sealed poor sizing improper fit, loose elastic, facial hair beard stubble, etc. fact might even worse surgical mask, since N95+ larger pressure differential air go around mask (and filtered) way around mask. Surgical masks forgiving gaps.

That said, recommend getting better masks still using situations -- KN95 KF-94 (which prefer) easily available pretty equivalent N95. Make sure seal, good go. might good choice gym bit harder breathe, maybe similar double masking surgical mask.  areas, sure. WA hit 70% initiated first dose. Mask recommendations localized based rising hospitalization (not cases necessarily) vaccination rates. neighbor Thai come house without mask 15 years neighbor, assume pollen bad Atlanta. American husband started wearing one Covid. That's really bad logic. could used justify extreme reactions disease.

Sure, doctors say common cold public health threat, wrong before. News feed yesterday suggesting immunity may last several years, boosters required. Thanks this. agree entirely. I’m fully vaccinated since April. still chance could get sick would rather take chance. 

I see people acknowledging (in opinion) real concern long term side effects coronavirus despite vaccinated. 

It’s easy continue wearing masks ease restrictions I’m comfortable with. part, I’m still worried think that’s completely warranted. getting super tired judgement I’m getting feeling way though. still one top 5 played mobile games. longer massive social phenomenon. 

Its like people say World Warcraft dead. dead less popular peak. peak popular video game time. Nothing since come close fair comparison. Anywhere tracking rapid test sales qtys? week first week saw shelf sold binax tests. Starting worry that's indicative enter another wave infections. Israel finding asymptomatic spread amongst vaccinated

No they’re respect personal choice friend! Take vote! Probably missing tumor though... know didn't, 

I saying even though mask wearing big chore terrible PR *public health officials WHO* imply mask wearing needed vaccinated, presumably vaccines effective enough own. soon people hear creates fud vaccine fence-sitters there. 

I know protect public health, best way get people vaccinated kind reactionary move help effort. Schools open US varying lengths time - areas time, areas part time, devastating surge child sickness death.

If devastation children, it'll wrought adults, virus. Effective July 1st, health insurance goes 17%. guess I’ll paying anti-vaxxers anyway. CDC working two different data sets. They’re right. CDC right what’s safe US, right what’s safe countries less immunity higher spread.  start, people can't vaccinated, legitimate medical reasons. 

This true literally every disease vaccines for... Guess would depend he’s not. selfish relative says counting everyone else part don’t to. afraid side effects (they valid health reason). don’t know anyone didn’t form anxiety walking first shot. people think special. Sadly, story almost old Covid-19. Denier denies, denier gets sick, sometimes denier realizes wrong apologizes. Well supposed feel high mighty stupid Pfizer vaccine now?! things change... Idk would classify “long hauler” still almost complete Anosmia 4 months recovering otherwise. 

I’m also little less able breath exertion compared before, honestly dunno due virus spending much time indoors last year. 

I 2nd stick get vaccinated 10 days ago I’ve noticed improvement sense smell yet. here’s hoping! I’m sorry nothing life 100%. life!

It seems lot people never paid attention risks took daily basis. Getting car driving work. Eating extra desserts while. risk every decision make life.

Vaccines gotten us point risk Covid vaccinated daily risks took prior Covid. solution make vaccinated people still wear mask end time? virus going anywhere always people can't get vaccine Yeah, understand. Wait fall (write down) Delta variant raging US CDC says “Everyone wear mask again.” People lose it. us vaccinated call ""fuck 'em"" gap  Yes. Move on. Lets get back ""normal"". Stop mandates lockdowns, protect yourself. unsolvable issue, least short term.

You cannot convince someone grew culture education prioritzed raised distrust government sudden become educated trustful government. people don’t get vaccinated larger numbers, unvaccinated get Covid inevitably, people keep wearing masks postpone it. point people stop wearing masks, don’t agree keep masking, people choose get vaccinated.

Put effort bringing vaccine people instead, free shots workplace without asking documentation likely help us keeping people masked forever. completely true, even wasn’t, I’d take CDC’s guidance WHO’s heartbeat

The CDC’s record hasn’t perfect pandemic, it’s generally right place. hand…yikes people risk Covid

Everyone risk. risk get ill may vary, sooner later everyone get contact virus.  really, problem they're selfish they're likely kinds people take responsibility anything. They'll mostly blaming someone else, even 'attacking' them. wailing government failed them, possibly known would 'that bad' 'it's cold, all' This. 
Wearing mask big deal, know is...
Also, wearing mask helps stop people anxiety around me. thoughtful wear one also effortless. person said, wearing mask doesn’t affect someone’s life mildly inconvenient. biggest issue - going pay medical bills someone get sick vaccinations? sure shit handle mask public places reduce risk hospital stint medical bills long term effects (as someone several surgeries last years). Americans truly don’t understand close medical bankruptcy they’re already it. Um, realize forcing people something one way another. Either wear mask idiots get vaccinated, vaccinated. offered solution problem  Come man, decorum trying serious discussion here! /s Vaccines work, sorry Mr. Delta Variant friends, ACE2 Receptor pub CLOSED. Leave escorted antibodies. decide touch one customers perforin granzymes you. It’s buddy, go back bat cave. vaccine 80% effective preventing symptomatic infection, per UK's PHE data.

88%   I'm ok masks, seems lot people want go back wearing masks again. delta vax, something doesn’t exist mean? nothing keeping getting covid keep hospital dying. vaccine job. 2 things

1. listening puppet master
2. fully understand .....yet. MIL brother sister law (who see frequently) refuse get vaccine. cannot life understand why, except wife says mother ""has good immune system get sick.""

I told that's stupid fucking reason. get car accident everyday yet still wears seat belt. 

This ticking time bomb able say ""I told so"" shitty consolation prize. I’m relieved hear question I’m hoping someone answer: Israel says 50% new cases vaccinated individuals. Didn’t receive Phizer shaping Israel’s health recommendations? disease deadly. worst it’s now. You’ve got vaccines. Lets go back life please do! requirement set expire September 13. course extended, doubt be.  cool story Yeah tough one. I've seen number 0.3%. can't remember claim severe cases deaths. thing is, 0.3% unreliable data still high me.  already? Straw men personal attacks aside, hope reply made feel better, pal. Exactly. I'm sucker.    calculation, bit 160 years ago. noped article saw interviewed Deepti Gurdasani. thanks. Good luck trying keep vaccinated people lockdown forever virus might stay forever us, like flu. Yeah, hope so. even consult doctors. Funny, watched dr Fauci interview impression got “we going attempt REQUIRE wear masks” Delta prominent soon yet…. (Which took mean, may SUGGEST greater measure control virus soon” no, won’t require it. feel huge rainbow hope yesterday days information different sources. Moderna shows 79% delta variants (pre print release). wish could find share link I’m crunched time didn’t “instantly find it”.  flip side coin 79% roughly 21%failure rate “1 five”. still much better hoped Fair point. Pride deadliest sin OH AGGRESSIVE!  


By way, call daughter Boo resembles kid Monster's Inc. Cool story, bro Yup. live greater Silicon Valley area vaccinated percentage high here. Trying get vaccine tricky *so* many people signed job put high list.

We're still masking go places depending specifics, due choice JIC concern others. Erring side caution without overwhelming dread last year time. Prior covid people also lost jobs unable pay got evicted. happened every day.

Maybe America uncomfortable homelessness before. likely, Americans prior covid believed everyone lost income fault reality people got hurt sick, downsized, replaced via automation cheaper labor, hours cut (a big one Affordable Care Act forced employers provide health insurance full-time employees. One job isn’t enough now). 

I don’t think tenants know costs run rental property. Taxes insurance, one, much higher. isn’t unusual lose money years even tenant always pays. 

Assuming say true, majority people paying lot rent zero rent, would seem intermittent rent work well enough forced housing stop. Landlords may compelled “work out”, say. 

More likely, it’s time move people along whatever would next prior covid. Shelters, section 8, etc. expanded. Tass valid source? Dying covid maybe, even vaccinated people catch covid given sufficient exposure experience organ damage without hospitalization death. fully vaccinated. keep mask time being. piece cloth. represents global effort. outside US, vaccinations less aren’t mRNA undeveloped countries. you’re well vaccinated state enough immunity, choice could wear mask not. go country doesn’t high vax, despite vax still wear mask immunity places hasn’t started yet. think local, case count low fine, low vaccination area increasing high case counts might good idea. admit merely ""mildly"" uncomfortable heat. Good know. think there's enough data deaths yet UK certain whether deadly, showing hospitalisations young. hospitals full cannot treat everyone, medical supplies run out, deaths increase (see India).

As general rule, young people high risk death Covid, forget complications brain damage, long Covid, sepsis leading amputations, erectile dysfunction, diabetes....it's simple die fine. Better vaccinated soon can, turn nasty cold instead russian rullet. science says vaccinated people contract disease, although miniscule chance getting seriously ill it, science says still spread others.

So no, ""emotion science"". like ""I'm happy make tiny sacrifice help protect others might able get vaccinated"". put another way, me. honest enough you? would much happier could discussions *policy*, instead waste energy arguing *facts*. huge portion country even accept facts, can't even begin discuss policy. mental gymnastics amazing people. want follow CDC agree them, agree follow CDC? fully vaccinated still wear masks. stop fear mongering wanting people wear masks again. Wear want. going prove purposeful, though? think lot people genuinely believe nonsense they're spreading true. vaccine 100% effective mask rest lives? Vaccines never meant 100% shield covid first place meant turn covid less harmful seasonal illness, mask lovers seem latch intobsomething thqt clear since beginning.

Stop already mask fanatism. Seems aggressive okay. boo That’s one possible explanation. That’s rarely get &amp; it’s minimal. take chance (not knowing long term problems) innocent kids ? good immune systems &amp; fight well. like healthy adults.   Body weight indication health.

What understand is, quite people sub actively cheering die off. regard kids vaccinated, even though kids die often covid, parents do. lot kids going lose parents this, fucking **sucks.** 70's different time. Nearly many co workers refused vaccine.

I want brag, company required everyone office sucks, area sit in, possibly 100% vaccinated. know everyone reporting director fully vaccinated last person got reports -- back April. ain’t kidding that. way people stand ever trust “experts” again. First two week shutdown turned full year. get vaccine. every one wanted vaccine it, want people start masking again? Compliance zilch. Yeah, somewhat agree that. epidemiological standpoint, great meet run unchecked population, understand there's really anything do.

I'm really talking messed think vocal minority is.  reason masks urged first place stop-gap measure vaccine available, provides way better protection. assuming way many things. First all, little evidence suggest masks effective way prevent transmission, much important proper ventilation avoid critical masses. vaccine alone prevents transmission pretty well, it’s perfect. areas high vaccination rates (which India is/was NOT), case rates still extremely low, hospitalization super rare. 

Right virus super control live, people fully vaccinated. believe 100% okay go living normally without mask conditions. rare chance getting extremely sick transmission worth living restrictions people. Hell, I’m likely get injured car work point. cases start climb dangerous levels again, I’ll first go back masking socially distancing, enjoy freedom. think lot confusion comes fuzzy definition asymptomatic. Someone may little runny nose slight headache tickle throat brush nothing allergies. later test positive, may retrospectively attribute symptoms COVID, asked time may say symptoms. honestly trust CDC start whole mess tried point blank lie masks nothing shortage.

Fuck that, idea agenda currently faith they're totally upfront.

Of course might meant reducing impact disease, lending opportunity adversaries contrarians claim overreaction power-grab.

Still, would better Moreover biontech vaccine period second dose decreased 6 weeks 4 weeks delta variant cases doubled week. Next week sputnik v available third option. information conflicting. wants vaccinated people wear masks sake infecting unvaccinated people. CDC says masks necessary personal protection vaccinated people. It’s almost willfully stupid. disagree Imagine weak grasp fundamentals understand vaccines work. 

One time, I'll say slowly...If vaccinated, protected, matter status anyone else around is. 

You keep throwing faux outrage around, change fact trying push blame circumstances everyone else, important factor point pandemic personally protect YOURSELF. 

Yet, want come try put onus people instead focusing behavior. 

Sounds like selfish one.  Probably saw big spike became cold last year people indoors more. wasn’t fall started ramp nov. know cases increasing factor 20 also increase hospitalizations deaths factor 20 weeks. idea something magically changed weeks passed yet hold water, yet new case surge see argument. 

The UK low CFR right (just US back March) started vaccinating lowest-risk groups, nothing change risk ratios unvaccinated month year ago.  long you’re aware, making informed conscious decision, don’t live anyone high risk category you’re good Exactly. never trust politician. change minds whim. tried address comment....but totally right, relative works standard blood lab wants get higher degree pathology, yet parents (in 60's) refuse get vaccine.....it really unfortunate. strong fear/distrust politicians clearly get paid/supported companies....but clue public distrust doctors/people academia. definitely exaggerate possibilities work treating disease hopes funding, going lie shot stop pandemic (errrr....I really disappointed approval new Alzheimer drug) Indoor dining fully opened many European countries, without even need get tested vaccinated.

I'd personally hesitant say masks wearers following science going feelings. us work healthcare, we're hearing says continue indoor mask usage. Sounds like Hydroxychloroquine, without national leader advertising   People treat differently based think.  would argue it’s cautious approach, own. comparing number Brazilian child deaths illnesses 2018 2019 number deaths since beginning pandemic, Vital Strategies found excess 2,975 deaths. organization says likely vast majority excess deaths -- official number 1,122 -- Covid-19.


""What see Brazil number kids dying Covid specified cause death higher seeing countries world -- 10 times higher,"" Dr. Ana Luiza Bierrenbach, epidemiologist Vital Strategies, told CNN. 

In United States, country world higher overall official death toll Brazil's, far fewer children died Covid-19 -- 382 Americans age 18, according CDC data. think, HUGE difference R0 = 1.2 (exponentially increasing condition) vs 0.95 (decreasing). vast majority would been, know actual stats it.

We typically wear masks community, rule. I'm starting see directly contradictory information this, worrying me. says wear masks, CDC says need to. Either could influenced agenda trying sway public behavior. Also, studies saying vaccine protection falls rapidly, others say could last years. There's wiggle room interpretation true, can't useful claims. idea get reliable advice issue. Agreed well No, really, local health dept mandate power people get vaccinated. thought main point masks stop spread people. mean need wear mask people vaccinated? definitely don’t help says wear masks one day CDC says it’s fine without masks next day. 

Everyone likes say trust science scientists can’t even fucking agree doing.

It’s still shitshow. i’m Australian agree this. Feels like we’re back March 2020, unfortunately whole virus politicised hell back here. Dead last vaccination rates western world. 

100% understand dangers virus it’s effects people, year half pandemic seems like real game plan whatsoever.

This covid zero strategy adopted federal state governments without vaccinations needs rethink, feels like there’s leak bound happen. Agree 100%. 

I’m wary dissuading ppl wearing masks. people comfortable wearing masks post-vaccination let them. 

But don’t give false sense security trust remove masks. science shows vaccinated people get breakthrough COVID cases, even mild result long term symptoms, specifically loss smell. Personally, like sense smell. Cases area still relatively high, since vax numbers low. It’s gonna bother one bit mask go Costco today. wear KN95 protect significantly sick shoppers. guess it’s emotional sense losing sense smell would effect emotionally, that’s irrational fear. Even chance happening low, it’s infinitesimal, price pay lowering risk *significantly* wearing mask hour. Easy decision. I'm eastern mass! I've bunch though, Berkshire beautiful. 

Here though much easier, 95% everyone pro vaccine, anyone laughed made fun of, usually get anyway fit (i think like 8/11 people situation knew got anyway) 

Sorry change life around much dumb thing like that.
 
Hopefully years come goes away coexist may part it, years literature also suggested masks general public increased risk transmission. science based pre-covid world people didn’t know wear mask properly. remember sitting packed lecture hall (crazy looking back it) hospital February 2020 hospital epidemiologists told us advise patients wear masks cited evidence. statement cdc far remember. 

Suddenly, covid hits, mask etiquette becomes common knowledge new research suggests masks protect public likely due wide spread education. Then, epidemiologists CDC pivot say OK masks safe cause everyone learned wear them. 

I’m discounting demand argument really can’t speak that, distinctly remember pre 2020 research fairly strong advising general public try wear masks want note big part decision.  they’re willing screw lives condemn underclass, maybe thinking why? That’s really big decision, one would make lightly. sounds effective actually contributes pretty significant reduction cases time. Heard Fauci reference recently. Eh, think that’s minor voice here. don’t see people street telling unvaccinated go die. protesting mass terrorizing people. unvaccinated lies says vaccinated? real? Covid killing children now? alarming rate? elitist, games solved bought way many cool masks wear anymore everyone rush buy masks like toilet paper nurses doctors get covid healthcare system overrun? Yeah, sometimes best interest government fully transparent. People romanticize complete 100% transparency, mainly get fooled politicians thinking something unconditionally desirable, there's single country earth completely transparent everything. mean, there's reason classify certain information. 

And part point entirely sure necessary general public due knowing could transmitted without symptoms. CDC found could, started recommending it. I'm fully vaccinated live Florida definitely wear mask anymore. yea big deal want indefinitely remove human faces society.

""its piexe cloth"" CDC power guarantee Trump going that. death negative outcome getting COVID would agree you. unfortunately negative outcome. get's old explaining we're boat. Can't assume someone vaccinated either Seems like weird way say mRNA effective vaccine perform citizens arrest think.  Auras small face unfortunately. get wife though. They're soft comfortable. They've life saver her. fully vaccinated still mask indoors possible could vector. saw study showed fully vaccinated people still spread Delta variant.  Masking still way protect others. hard get vaccinated places? live, walk Walmart go pharmacy. Takes, told, 30 minutes time, 15 sitting playing phone waiting make sure allergic reaction.

I know situation areas, maybe much harder places without Walmart every miles. anyone verified vaccinated? Maybe way currently set honor system issue one knows actually low risk profile not. Considering Prime Minister received AZ highly doubt Canadians blacklisted traveling EU. always guilt trip fan myself.  like mask , ninja. Smoke bomb…  careful statistic, misleading. people get vaccinated, percentage vaccinated among covid deaths going increase unvaccinated decrease. 100% people vaccinated, 100% covid deaths vaccinated people. 

I've seen people parroting statistics UK, significant portion COVID deaths vaccinated group. Looks bad, right? Well fail mention almost deaths people 50+, 90% 50+ population vaccinated. actually spoke efficacy vaccine appearances not. Sure vaccinated extremely unlikely spreaders. careful kids vaccinated people unmasked aren’t significant factor. bigger issue can’t tell someone vaccinated unmasked. even one person infecting people quickly, would obvious based infections store. Always two are, less admit, husband hesitant stop wearing mask enough studies experience happened. children vaccinated. data overwhelmingly points towards risk need build immune systems cold kids go back person school. So.... masks.  It’s estimated 25-40% US Americans caught COVID past year.

Is right bank idea unvaccinated person won’t catch next 5, 20, 50 years? That's really interesting. wear N95/KN95 regular cloth surgical mask? things going US sort vaccination proof? Germany they'll give QR code use upload vaccination status app use proove status (you also take along paper version it'd probably annoying lost one).

If nothing planned front, just... say vaccinated not? almost somebody wants divide America. much dislike wearing masks, I’m right aircraft. pandemic id get ill nearly every time flew. Nearly ruined vacations. Definitely fine continuing there. decide colors team jerseys? sadly Spain. outdoors mandate lifted days ago vast majority people still wear mask even inside carsor walking park alone. definitely become symbol. fear much society country forever tainted masks. really thing ""anti-maskers"" anymore since many places masks necessary. 

Are ""anti-lifejacket"" wear life jacket walking around town? find crazy Americans reacting vaccines. work Ontario every single colleague least first dose point. even know single person getting vaccinated. saying exist, clearly rare US, especially south. CDC knows this. think take account risk unvaccinated people going unmasked risk poses vaccinated children coming guidance? did. risk extremely, extremely low. not, would issued guidance. I'm going try convince kids fine understand mother going worried regardless parents do, rationality going enter equation. scientists public health experts came guidance absolutely kid considerations, us following guidance understand care kid (which part got vaccinated.)

Except idiots won’t get vaccinated able to. Lol said this, mostly kidding kind deep I’m afraid people think don’t care stop wearing one Zero seconds? 30 years data act like it’s big inconvenience wear masks grocery store couple months vaccinations continue occur. 

The people claiming everyone vaccinated already evidence actually back up. !RemindMe 2 months Trust bro. 2nd jab something fierce. However, IMO, it’s really necessary. immune response (27,M) REALLY strong. took Pfizer vaccine sleep better night knowing I’m fully vaccinated protected (well least 95%). Everyone’s body immune response different. So, don’t think second jab overkill. anything, it’s reinforcement. NJ residents sub, anyone else surprised Murphy hasn’t weighed WHO’s new guidance masks yet?

I thought he’d one first seriously consider bringing back mandates. 

Is waiting till mid-November gubernatorial election over? looked actual numbers new cases looking percentages? numbers indicate though, page 10 table 3 lower rates hospitalisations across age groups balanced view delta impact hospitalisations? talking North America South America, sure. one already - unvaccinated people must wear masks inside? reason vaccinated individual wear mask. CDC agrees

The CDC literally says vaxxed people wear mask schools, mass transit, hospitals. forget part?  looked highest number range gave. CDC data older variants circulating quite time, highly doubt reliable data available new variant US taking hold here. screen name implies chemist, ought know gathering good data takes time. 2-5 times hospitalization rate comes UK data. accuse fear mongering? feel safe vaccine now, yes never zero covid, like measles. Measles, many people vaccinated, see enough transmission disease result vaccine resistance; necessarily case covid vaccine uptake remains low foreseeable future. fact people seeing increased hospitalization young people new variant elsewhere. increase cases send medical system edge places. Hospitals rural areas going business rapid pace, simply capacity treat catchment areas is. We're still dealing fall-out mental health crisis this, people pre-existing conditions avoided care pandemic due fear they'd get sick die getting point many can't avoid medical treatment. loved one hospital hemorrhagic stroke pandemic, fun worry whether loved one die catches covid recovering stroke, understand people avoided care. don’t really think entire thing negotiation game they’re willing get vaccine government pays them. case say like $100, it’s time use sticks. It’s misinformation, stubbornness, hatred that’s driving this. it’s vaccinations exist covid obesity isn’t fair comparison.  Stop allowing unvaccinated doctors, nurses medical staff. Eventually stomach force get vaccinated. important vaccine represents return normal. Forcing people put masks back really hurts morale. Humans social beings. important part social interaction able see someone's face.

No reasonable scientist ever said expect COVID fatalities hit 0. people going die. people belong families greatly mourn passing. sucks. move forward accept reality.

I carry mask everywhere, put required. werent requiring customers... damn. 

At least I'm Los Angeles us wore masks got vaccinated. medic records charging national standard? Remember Robert Redfield said this: “I might even go far say face mask guaranteed protect COVID take COVID vaccine, may 70%.” 😂😂 folks wonder trust institutions time low. never ending comparison cultures SE Asia unproductive point saga used self loathing Americans. butthurt Jim rural Missouri wearing mask inside Target whether vaxxed really become another thing weak, depressed, basement dwellers complain about. Nation whiners cultivated. I've always turned away, except well controlled, used inhaler couple months, once, like 18. 

The reason gave taking much liquid body could cause secretions lungs thicken, cause bad attack.   insurance companies sending mail customers get vaccinated pay fuck up. cba people like this, yeah, great changed mind, risking others lives nearly dying yourself. mum caught COVID working q care home, caught lifelong lung condition COVID triggered.

I took every precaution qnd I'm getting second job next week, yet still ended permanent illness. Vaccines need mandatory, way get people.

Also, media exaggerating qmount deaths/side effects due vaccine. act like kills someone every hour, reality handful deaths coincidence.

Just get vaccine, idiot risk others yourself. guess also lot people could get appointments last couple weeks stopped trying. Also, doctors able order many doses first shots focus second doses. 
I guess change lots new deliveries.

My guess Germany get 65-70% entire population vaccinated there's significant slow-down. Vaccination rates may reach 80% end year kids eventually getting vaccinated, too.  never said anything convincing people. said let people they're gonna make mind whether reasonable choice conspiracy. That's point. Trying convince people going cause pushback argument, like doing. well convinced PoGo would solve worlds problems first month so. fun time wasting time complete strangers neighborhood.

It's much 'feel' issue facts issue. want entertain idea he's wrong, would make feel bad. like feel bad. Solution? fuck knows.  Nah, means forgot order suitable amount. Except ones suffer consequences. Kids even allowed get vaccine many places. Immuno-suppressed people certain medications CAN'T take it. 

This cool all. People refusing get vaccinated hurts us ALL, them. Kids 12 vaccines.   really hoping start wearing masks sick. see people it.  shut mask spam Nobody's listening CDC anymore getting much wrong begin with. I'm sure not. People forget masks (especially cloth) final resort/last ditch measure.

Once better protection available (e.g., vaccines) - mask obsolete. Well expecting, agree. Let people want vaccine face consequences. people pay whose immune systems compromised cannot get vaccinated (not not, not). point getting critical threshold vaccinated people protect various legitimate reasons cannot get vaccinated vulnerable result. 

My daughter 10 allowed vaccinated yet, feel comfortable going now, still unprotected. Hopefully, allow younger kids vaccinated near future (obviously know safe so) get it, people wont vaccinate children, either. Please avoid areas anti-vaxxers dominant, likely enough herd immunity protect children.  people really dumb? know kids 12 can't get vaccinated, right? Apparently not. let stop spreading ignorant judgment internet like feces wall. Time break n95 Masks absolutely still wear mask 100% spite since I've approached it. I'll die thing. hypocrites want get mad wearing mask choose so, affecting one myself, wear mask choice even though wearing would potentially spread COVID-19 kill people? Fuck that. Come me. never really believed would get Covid

Everyone get contact coronavirus sooner later. never go away again. That's important get vaccinated get ill least mildly. Like said need masks first place? Even unfortunately many 12 vaccinated parents allow be.

The whole “the unvaccinated get deserve ” refrain selfish antisocial nihilism. understand exasperation anti-vaxxers can’t use excuse stop caring other’s welfare. flying illegal? Listen both, understand context.

CDC advice people America, living country used effective COVID vaccines has, along five first-world nations, achieved 50% one-dose vaccination rate.

The WHO's advice world, currently 23% one-dose vaccination rate, using variety vaccines, many simply effective US vaccines. Parents prudent deciding younger children (e.g. play friends whose parents vaccinated rule kids play with). Primary schools require masks 6 weeks Pfizer vaccine approved children, happen 2-3 months.

The problem mostly school situation far tell. many states, person school mandated, mask mandates banned.  control you, simple. know means specifically regard vaccinations, there's [two loooong time. I've living life pre-pandemic last couple weeks now, masks, going eat, going festivals, without fear.

Yeah that's always south. :( CDC said mask off, mask off, since end May  keeping away public spaces much possible can't making wear mask? one want talk rude. say? Ya mentioned that. whole subreddit took place anti- everything. take long realize topic invite irrational arguments. got tired trying educate provide sources swooped out.
