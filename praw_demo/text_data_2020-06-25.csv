Excellent point.That one aspects pandemic shows selfish society. lounge around. Sure indoors time may eventually start grate, surely torturous even bad. never better cooped up. 

For key context, here's anecdote interest. parents lived current house, faces large grassy public space, 20 years. last 15 years advent internet technological advances, watched fewer fewer people frequented space. used summers fair weather days would kids pets families teens enjoying space, less abandoned present day. Come covid lockdowns, sudden, space lively again. Everyone decides outdoors treaure flocks back out, even though ignored area better part decade. becsuse *were told stay home, decided wanted go out*. found insanely easy get test AZ. called doctor's office drove up, called came out. Results 30min, negative. Perhaps depends part state in. saddest shit ever. know going long time, think even close bad left US. would never live US again. Curious orange troll there... People passing masks local protests. really excuse calling protesters reason spikes sole racial blaming. wearing masks. mask usage. dont belittle wearing masks. keep sending checks name November keep putting blame individual states anything goes wrong. Plenty people eat up. not-so-distant past, count partisanship make way pragmatism comes getting things done local level. Much emergency!

For pandemic, though, think 3 governors elephant side aisle handled sanely (Maryland, Massachusetts Ohio), 1 (Ohio) fell off. moral intellectual collapse even state officials one US' major parties really catastrophe top pandemic. Trump authority states conduct elections.

That mean try TBH expect people streets summer Winters. 
Unless there's scientific point making. apologize I'm AZ, go protests watched local news. protests looked way smaller compared others around country. numbers reopening. governor opened almost everything span 1 week (starting May 9th) mask order. everyone went back business usual things reopened. mom flight attendant everyone knows forced take leave absence. Granted, 60‚Äôs typically fly international, huge portion Delta FAs haven‚Äôt flying. Bay Area really great well. cannot leave house without wearing mask. like since close beginning really.

Could probably expect closer one million+ dead Americans next years it.

The situation *is* used ratings, I'll agree. make false, though. People seem understand that. Yes, I'm using mask nose bridge . said. Hope greet inconvenience open arms great thing way achieve long term prosperity.

I keep building life avoid inconveniences uncalled for.  I‚Äôm small community NY. lucky, government‚Äôs rules masks social distancing. knew things would edge Memorial day. yesterday small town 31 active cases, ever. I‚Äôm sure Snowbirds coming back also bring village. 

All stay home, wear mandatory masks go all. went Fox News mobile site scroll 13 stories get dedicated COVID-19 article. even though might telling people wear masks, they‚Äôre definitely downplaying virus, dangerous. working home. First day back office, got eye strain headache. mask nose bridge really helps. Ugh hate people well, sound like broken record, Monday experts predicted hospitalizations would peak mid-July. want bastards forget remember that. many areas planning reopen post 4th July Every day people around world look US adjust understanding US world leader. US taking along. coworker got smacked covid result four 7 person staff called sick. doubt 3 actually sick instead smart thing staying home warned beforehand. I, however, handle double amount work, need get blood test tomorrow. -_-"" 


People open back virtually regulations they? happy wearing mask public... ""After botched start UK making new mistakes""

Fixed you. could Europe like... social safety net? Universal healthcare? Made illegal fire anyone paid salaries? Cases 50 area, apparently multiple kids according girl least, like middle COVID decided go 300 man party thought people wouldn‚Äôt get it??? Eat ~Reich~ rich US, people can't afford things normal times. lol Yeah, I‚Äôm assuming put mask correctly per request you‚Äôre clutching pearls witch gave evil eye half second.

You‚Äôre probably right didn‚Äôt cough food back room. worth effort. And, wouldn‚Äôt want talking manager. don‚Äôt melt know they‚Äôre fucking moron angry before, seemed like wife taking seriously family blas√© it. distancing, wearing masks, we're lucky enough able work home, went groceries. needed go one us. 

I got positive test results back today. I'm blindly pissed family reaction state country officials enabling blatant, ignorant dismissal anything happening. 

I'm risk group, neither anyone family, I'm lucky. know everyone say same. Wow. Nobody saw coming! take efforts prevent deaths, without outright removing things lives. It‚Äôs NorCal - Remember everyone said it'll gone summer can't survive heat? wear mask glasses? so, may entitled condensation. stop working get unemployment. Washington state contact tracing #1 cause spread social events. fact, haven‚Äôt able trace single case back protests. I.e. masks work (and protesters wear them.)  schedule Friday gap 12pm-2pm time briefing that's pretty good bet. He'll probably start mentioning great market doing. Nasdaq near time highs, death rate low, whatever good snippets say let others deliver reality. This, ESPECIALLY #3. people getting high horse bad people parties such. 


Well, hell expect? Canada one region 50k total covid cases one 8k total big difference... one cases spring break week earlier restrictions created March. I‚Äôm saying that‚Äôs reason def contributed LOT sounds like Man-Emperor Mankind mean yes he's skeletal remain sitting top giant gold throne still... reason US hard time virus big chunk population (mainly conservatives) values individualism collective good. want anything that's even minor inconvenience order protect people around them. fucked up, really. New York Boston massive protests spike covid cases. dumb question Ireland, limited large buildings lots distancing. You‚Äôre forgetting teachers, professors, TAs, dorm staff, dining hall staff, custodial staff...etc...aren‚Äôt teenagers. ‚Äúquite young‚Äù put it. .....thing coronavirus got lifeless eyes - black eyes, like dolls eyes....doesnt seek livin, bites ya, eyes roll white....... ""Doesn't look good"". 

A 4% decrease compared 3% decrease. would say Germany looks bad believe 4% ""not good"". 

Germany export-heavy, Sweden import-heavy within economies. Specific hospitals country also run capacity, even ‚Äòsurge capacity‚Äô state still have. moved people different hospitals throughout country. don‚Äôt see problem that? problem US healthcare something? Like hospitals don‚Äôt wanna lose patients they‚Äôre paying customers? fair, times great peril, Ancient Rome dictatorship program place. worked often not... Giving one intelligible, proven person opportunity make individual choices could actually benefit US tremendously... politicized bickering getting people killed every minutes. Trump Fox News circulated hoax nonsense. country doomed. Trump started wearing masks publicly three months ago, America would completely different state today. wait get vaccine. angry subset pubic refuses get it. Oh judge state. judge overall presidents lack actions Shhh... don‚Äôt give ideas. Get worried numbers get bad hospitals overcrowded PPE stretched thin. New cases one thing, deaths another. Wash hands, socially distance wear mask, touch face mouth. Herd immunity worst case scenario happen nothing done. Cool, makes sense. presidential rallies too, appropriate That's bizarre comparison. sure, people also fragile. Human sacrifice.... Hmm. accept deaths without ever taking efforts deal it, end ourselves? mean, logically, we're going die anyway. way commoners seize opportunity area?

I know feasible one thing I've learned life past years things *seem* impossible reach, actually aren't; knowledge know it, know find knowledge. extra dot '.com'. reached half-term. like 180 times headline left. bad news

good news? 

Nothing....

and dont consider NYC getting shit control good news - virus still potential again....

Just real good news.....

This total horror show since Feb. Yes did. US not. Another article understand difference UK England... mean like people meltdown seeing someone MAGA hat? Oh god forgot that. It‚Äôs going shiw show. almost half country voted for, experiment much people actually need decent government anyway. Turns that, OK letting people suffer die, even put crime family white house entertainment. Phase Four come. vanilla smell air cupcake factory kill it. Dems helping Trump helps get re-elected. let burn, serves purpose average American‚Äôs expense. OBV vice versa. Still waiting trump teletubbies fans club + heavily entitled americans brag healthcare system ""wE aDvAnCeD hEaLtHcArE sYstEm"" young, wanted live NYC day. 

My thoughts nowadays: Better fucking not. Germany America promised. Thank god Trump didn‚Äôt get monopoly testing kits. never forget tried do. Give weeks allow people protests actually get tested. wallets man... Good point. proportion deaths rather total deaths? Atlanta area: go food stores morning, I'd estimate 90 percent wearing masks. Neither Lake Ozarks people - yet cases stemming that. Outside transmission - mask mask - rate seems like. Love it, love movie, good call. unfortunate thing much northern states gained squandered travelers south. entire country lock stepped would fine instead went 50 different directions many areas left counties / cities. I'm Texas. true. done extremely early pandemic Canada. anything, late party, maybe rightly played bit conservatively. something along lines dereliction duty, one checks balances situations? lunch capacity charts days, give solid 129% pre covid standards enforceable borders within Germany, individual actions taken G√ºtersloh residents - I've heard damaged cars people asked come booked vacation home.

Some states restrict renting people G√ºtersloh, need up-to-date test allowed vacation there. Bunch confederate, red states blame Yes, shocking given Sweden implement lockdown. rooms aren‚Äôt negative pressure. specific ones since expensive maintain take space need ante room Yeah sucks man. Mask use 100% minimum. Anywhere wear mask inside shouldn‚Äôt open right now. Sorry movie theatres (unless ban snacks idiots man people won‚Äôt even wear masks you‚Äôll think they‚Äôll give double big gulps?). Sorry dine restaurants/Bars. It‚Äôs going cause great financial stress yes, adjust way live better adapt things going forward. I‚Äôd rather broke fuck long means family health. I‚Äôm god damn sociopathic stockholder cares money. people say ‚Äúoh can‚Äôt change things‚Äù. fuck can‚Äôt. can. comes whether dear leaders toss us fucking bone not. found weak point! Oh gone I'm done incorrect assumptions ;) Nope, ransomized. even FHM believes representative popularion general. free people pay get tested.

24000 persons tested 17,2% anribodies. time tested 14000 persons current infection 13,8% infected. Glad enjoying summer. Let guess, 100% gone right?

I think hey mixing virus empathy ability rule compassion.  small detail, headline says trust strategy article trust management. access original text know something trust strategy. everyone thread going pretend gay males higher risk getting HIV etc. nice say. fact, science, science always nice group people. ""Boy everything sure gonna work out."" Us big city runs hard transfer small towns around usually transferring it.

If big one full, quickly small ones fill Yeah called Friday even true, I'd rather wait queue couple hours pay healthcare debt couple years lmao things say joke true. Swedish kids better British kids missing half year school. saying worth deaths better off.

We also lower risk second wave assuming level immunity. help us long term too. 

I still firmly believe early tell. done well first wave true knows fuck happen. hope there's second wave anyone SK, Germany, Norway etc starting see small rises :/


And someobe else, yes know saying one they're full shit. give capital free, high capacity testing cases go up. Deaths ICU still declining imporyant metric OMG, wish even ONE bike riding (or jogging even hiking) person SE MI would wear mask.

For whatever crazy reason, everyone seems think ""it's contagious outside"".

BZZT! Wrong answer. nice parting gifts you, including version home game. already late reverse momentum

just like climate change.

At least covid delay action effect order weeks instead decades ""funny"" thing write resurgence, on-going thing. Look Croatia example resurgence look like  Foreigner looking here. people blaming trump everyone praised going streets protest weeks? both. Racist policies toxic, often literally so, harm everyone order really harm ""other"". know shit happens like divorces death? moron Well getting point, problem wearing facemask infected covid, right? 

I wouldnt know that. assume clear circumstances prove otherwise. Normal state human covid free. 

What want declare everyone infected act accordingly, might people really cant find them. somehow similar declaring everyone guilty crime punishing everyone accordingly, cant find real culprits know somewhere there.

Concession comfort sounds bad enough me.

No, sincerely doubt that, demand goes straight basics ideology. Rights freedoms absolute permanent. discarded easily, rights mere privilegies. everyday bro ""He hid 'rona playbook couch left!"" understand that. opinion. whole thing is, men women stopped listening sports watching them, amount time better spent like actually talking kids, etc., useful is. working would even receive benefits measure?

unemployment ran state level. federal government boosted coffers. Blame states shitty backends. libraries open? LOL really? People necessarily die right away. take two weeks more. Think it. Sorry dealt that. height pain would let cut leg lol. Yeah wearing masks sufficient government response superhuman asian thing Europeans cannot replicate ;-) low case-counts gone within weeks Europe. People simply way careless. Thoughts prayers, hehe. Come back? What? I‚Äôm even arguing you? defensive snarky? longer havd baby soon 5 9 year old terrifies me. Anyone die this, pisses beginning oh kids fine this. Um kids arnt immune immune death. Cool can't mandate wear pants either, right? Um, no. made assumptions live.

Your come back game weak, leave hehe seen immediately. 30 second wait most. 3/4 empty. Yeah spreading COVID America Canada, least we're flattening curve. spike probably cross-border nonsense.  Hurry stop testing! planets round. areas government turning bland eye

The problem government turning blind eye people ignoring rules. guy, lot countries right numbers, USA there's probably lot people infected. like China Russia big small countries. That's cool, many us learned now, proving retaliation difficult. Suddenly best behavior people know game system. made this? Sorry, astroturfed mean? Honestly tho. it‚Äôs f‚Äôd true. local liquor store worked better worst days. I'm sure Maga face masks wear. I‚Äôm mask wearing doesn‚Äôt condensation sweat impact efficacy? it‚Äôs hot I‚Äôm walking store, wouldn‚Äôt better soak mask spit sweat put go store? 

I genuinely wondering.  assume live America too? Wat Obviously means must slow testing SiLeNt MaJoRiTy Funny say family Cuba clear they're Russia probably worry recovery people think Covid-19 gone everything fine.

Me personally great. astounding number gone down... given evidence. puts death rate 0.6%. 

My belief along virus widespread contagious we‚Äôve told, also far less deadly.

With American Red Cross free antibody testing blood donations interesting see results. wife donating next Thursday. convinced December, kind hoping right antibodies! believe it. normal birth charged $240,450 3 day stay 0 complications. GOP sure, think anti-science stuff tied party directly (plenty MLM face creams, mysterious vegan diets, anti-GMO anti-nuclear stuff left).

Yet bizarre fucking reason makes sense debate become partisan one, partisanship Trump supporters absolutely wrong. would definitely make separation GOP Trumpism,as sensible person wants vote sensible Republicans day.

Also... besides LA magnet homeless, makes California shithole? annoying thing seems real estate prices, objective proof population thinking shithole.  Thanks - weeks ago used NYC antibody results think showed IFR .86 10 1 actual cases tested cases. thought IFR NYC little high given happened nursing homes, best guess .5 - .8 percent. try use ‚Äúbest‚Äù case groups avoid sooner classifications.

Scott Gottlieb one realistic public spokesmen - early thought ration test actual 10 20 1, CDC came 10 1. guess looking backward accurate looking forward bit high.

The bad news even high rates we‚Äôre still, guess, 500 days away meaningful herd immunity. unless dramatically change strategy, we‚Äôll mess earlier next spring - assuming herd starts kick little bit effective vaccines starting get deployed early 2021. low. love killing What‚Äôs wrong bandana? Welcome America! land free, apparently also ruptured appendix death sentence... Welding people shut apartments boarding windows something want. want decent simple government action. Require face masks places public. Cancel school December vaccine ready. Literally no-brain level competency instead outright corruption indifference. live Houston, it‚Äôs much surprise see numbers considering lack action among population. won‚Äôt get another lockdown even did, people would still violate order. sad knowing many people perish suffer long term detriments health this. think get worse, imagine send kids back attend school. 

Stay safe everybody Thanks sharing. I‚Äôve exercises every morning started everyday work well sit lot day. Flu season fun, love death way going work. goes double NFL. Okay, hope recovery begins ASAP. :) I'd say days +2k deaths worse. protesters young healthy ish, wait parents/family members worse catch it.

delayed effect.  Think use common sense. act like protest zero consequences absurd. People large group yelling. Come on. Statistics easily manipulated. would test example 99% accurate healthy people 0% accurate sick people? say drug test 90% accurate detecting whether someone taken drugs test 100 people, means 90% test results accurate thus correct 10% error margin. let's say 100 people fact 50% take drugs 50 people. error margin 10% aka 10 people means actual test results come back anywhere 40% 60% tested positive, since error margin 10%. I'm applying logic antibody tests. anyway fine, getting tiring trying understand I'm okay understanding :) Seems like bowling alley would pretty easy place keep distances safely Mountain mosquitoes kids, good combination. Yeah sure angry upset, comment mistakenly thought lived US hurtful painful may never recover :) Atleast north, schools smart planning limit sizes classrooms masks children  Trump Activate D.O.T.S*

Head 95% heard fun fake conspiracy government actively trying stop countries opening borders us Swedes holiday home boost local economy. People like exactly reason borders closed. mean ones without unions frightened losing jobs drop hat overworked company employ less people job. Sounds fun. join race bottom? Apples oranges. Oh, 24 hours? keep forgetting check daily see exact thing Sorry made angry, seem upset. you‚Äôre looking somewhere without stupidity/ignorance, probably get Reddit.   This! I‚Äôve sort isolated keeping touch everyone regularly eventually turned ‚Äúso getting together?‚Äù conversations wouldn‚Äôt let up. became awkward keep talking people constantly turn invites hang out, especially they‚Äôre people never social distanced first place lasted 2 weeks. think thought time I‚Äôd give in, numbers never went I‚Äôm socializing happens. I‚Äôm glad didn‚Äôt shit rampant. wait mid-July cases start rolling July 4th. Many towns know holding fireworks. Seems like people Swedish administration found long-lost brains. single political group blame it. attacked people wearing masks, made statement it, demanded retail services open, protested stay home, pretend virus isn‚Äôt real also believing conspiracy, more. get rid ideology decision making improve. say like everyone money able uproot everything move another country let half forest burn, half develop immunity fire, good. long term half would die anyway, may well enjoy spectacle. :) NJ dumped bunch probable COVID deaths. aren‚Äôt new deaths, they‚Äôre weeks months old, show big one-time spike. works it. worries, ""It'll disappear one day, like miracle!"" people Facebook talk deaths also parrot \#alllivesmatter. They're maliciously dumb hypocritical. Looking curves, Europe ok given patchwork states jurisdictions there. us central gvt states, it‚Äôs shit show. Sad lol deaths come nursing homes. don‚Äôt protect elderly? can‚Äôt kill economy country whole year - there‚Äôs way works benefits anyone long term.

This virus plague made months ago Deaths way down. manipulated misleading reddit news. Lol Trump Flu That‚Äôs virus isn‚Äôt waves it‚Äôs big river. People always stupid. see social media. come warning rest world: Politicians charge people‚Äôs health. Period. Honest question wasn‚Äôt something fires workers unreachable home got fired? mean like company allow work home I‚Äôd damned boss calls I‚Äôm unavailable. wouldn‚Äôt bode well all. Lake Travis. parents give fuck God speed guys. feel terrible people tried things right way, might die can't get ICU bed need one. God damn. Remember that's average, hospitals lower, higher. That's problem. Localized outbreaks mean localized shit storms, starts impacting entire state region becomes much worse.  already dealing ‚Äújust driving Alaska‚Äù taking days long detour Banff tourist areas. keeping border closed, it‚Äôs bad enough dealing people seem still determined convince virus ‚Äúover‚Äù. January, government hosted massive (130 000 people) banquet Wuhan ""prove"" virus exist. Springbreakers US Europe brought virus back lived virus exploded. Americans Europeans partied caused hundreds thousands millions cases, yet somehow happen China? Unless overweight, medical condition, ignored. unless want die early, know lot people reddit want...

It's perfect, afraid kill yourself, choose easier, slower path. protests NOTHING spike. NOTHING. actually believe *could* reopen strategically **if** people wore fucking mask took common sense precautions (distancing possible, etc). 

I‚Äôd curious see virus ~95% population adhering ‚Äòbest practices,‚Äô we‚Äôre otherwise level reopening countrywide. 

It‚Äôs completely silly people pushing reopening wearing masks, it‚Äôs likely thing facilitate degree normalcy business operations. absolutely correct think upside mandating whenever leave house might cause people stay inside, need right now. Well NZ rugby games stadiums full 40k people, music festivals open, shops business open usual need wear masks etc. focus border now. Europe obviously still community transmission every day people better following rules wearing masks, social distancing etc. easier government track contain pockets infection. lot testing covid tracking apps feel Europe function mostly open state (bar large sport events etc.) without dramatic increase cases like earlier year. less burden due initial lock down. 

It work though otherwise sacrifice loss economic activity nothing. also agree another lock exacerbate economic issues.  Yeah, recent past Arizona's voted democratic governor. (She got nabbed Obama secretary state.) 

Unfortunately, sizable, loud aggressive, right-wing population, plus worst education system US -- there's lot people voting, even politics making actual decisions, minimal education. considered lol. hope well now, great day! That's neat beans dude. might something Missouri currently experiencing spiking case numbers largest two population centers, St. Louis Kansas City. would guess. I'd add arguments universal healthcare go something like 'we best fancy doctors world' really fall flat pandemic basic public health thing standing way disaster. headline reckless people gotten results back yet. reckless people 300 teenagers congregated large party pandemic.

If minor teens rather college teens, also statement authority figures involved. Parents fairly powerless getting teenagers getting together. party 300 teens can't happen without implicit and/or explicit permission several adults. mostly rigged anyway glad EU banned entry indefinitely. remember one day work months ago watching news, story total virus numbers China. 4800, misheard 48,000. realized mistake laughed scary would China actually 48,000... 44% dead. rumor racism worse pandemic coronavirus. news Yes. They've now. added quietly; check site every days work update new info. Previously, note digestive issues possible, waiting actually add while. Like every thing else stupid reason. this? Lol I‚Äôll week!  around 3-10%. try find study article back seem remember data NYC suggests that.

The reason high China largely due things like mass hysteria hospitals overpacked like normal day flu season It‚Äôs legitimate reaction stupidity. General new cases valuable indicator here. 636,000 tests yestereday compared 179,000 tests previous high. continue fearmonger without pro-rating really dishonest. always slice general population, percentage positive tests real indicator trend virus. president sells hoax. think would happen. Millions listening delusional tv host. ignoring experts. sounds like it. I'm saying believe square earths, goes current models, know true. vehemently disbelieve possibility square planet existing remote region space new unfound physics unimaginables play would asinine world infinite possibilities. Swedes strange view constitutes ""discrimination"".

The Danes always overgeneralize. Stay safe there. media want too? English term phrase: Strike-through contamination. Strike-through contamination: **Contamination sterile field** occurs passage fluid through, puncture in, microbial barrier. sickness infected minds America point actually scary watch happen humans civilized world. mixing accuracy false positives. false positive ""rate"" indicator test quality, depends active cases. accuracy ""rate"" indicator test quality. Let try mix numbers get across better.

Lets say 1% people antibodies.

1M people 90% accuracy rate.

So sake argument lets assume accuracy errors false positives.

So makes approx 100k false positives.

However, scenario 1000 people actually antibodies.

Which would make false positive rate 99%!

This enormous, case. show ""false positive"" rate depends context many people infected, whereas accuracy indicator test quality.

70% tests wrong, 70% positives false positives. False positive % dependent many people actually antibodies, accuracy not.  assume lot new increase. Less space, less equipment, exhausted staff. There‚Äôs still million ways end hospital, covid fills seats rapidly. Everything going come grinding halt every patient. possible less people wore masks. may see surges area area basis, also important note expontial growth began states allowed bars open face masks. denying allowing people pack confined area masks lead tremendous spread. go home spread family. Protesting outdoors masks still uncertainty whether it'll lead surges. 

It's important monitor unbias, thousands peolle crammed shoulder shoulder outdoors masks contribute surges, it'll give us understanding much impact two factors *may* lead different legislature surrounding mass gatherings outdoors. partially agree you. can't blame countries naturally occurring viruses, agreed. think blame countries disease prevention control. 

Based I've read, think China could done area (see wildlife market discussions). 

If disease came eating diseased wildlife meat maybe stricter regulations, better health inspections improved food quality standards could've done something prevent disease. protests combined smaller pre lockdown public transit volume NYC, I'd assume end lockdowns massive effects compared protests, protest spike lumped summer travel started around time. fourth July spikes (sometime August), especially Texas Florida stay bad insane. top executive country, access best information many sources, telling everyone hoax, nothing would go away, everyone own, rooted squads protestors refused wear masks.

Of course fault. means 44% think people dying mass economy ok Yeah cause schools known vigilant CT, really lucky smart people nobody afraid wear mask lol we‚Äôre number One!!!!!!!! People strange. First deny social distancing, going protests somehow Trump's fault. Hypocrisy finest. sacrifice looks like. no, I'm sarcastic. Adam Silver must've asked exact power invest money market - there's lot subreddits this. Jump exponential magic compounding. Yes, guess lie infection numbers pretend nobody dying, count ""protecting them"". Deaths lag infections 6 weeks. even Florida re-locked today, hospitalizations would increase next two weeks, deaths next 4 weeks.

In addition, older people better job distancing (as should), new infections increasing among young, survive. Sarcasm seen people don‚Äôt like science please include /s. country war critical thinking comments reported? not, we're likely see them. think something removed report rather whinging been. Trump brings folks sacrifice reputation, since commander chief believable anymore. Remember time brought CEOs talked CDC setting drive testing Walmart Target parking lots? ever actually plan make believe? happens employees refuse cook books, since that's morally wrong also felony? get fired like Rebekah Jones? Im one could go Denmark wanted too. 1200km drive there, swedens corona epicenter. Death totals per 100k residents
NY: 160
FL: 15
TX: 8
Source: WaPo reminds one Chinese saying ""racist"" countries closed borders early on.

Probably countries closed borders Chinese nationals still allowed citizens travel freely China without mandating enforcing quarantine. And? doesn‚Äôt matter anymore. Money business far important. ban Europe ban freaked people gathering together come airports once. cram airports hours people knows letting out. ‚ÄúAnd again, 15 people, 15 within couple days going close zero, that‚Äôs pretty good job we‚Äôve done.‚Äù sub regularly yanks posts comments deemed ‚Äúpolitical.‚Äù pretend politicians aren‚Äôt exasperating problem. Go figure. Came say like 65% yesterday lol assumption summer reduces infections people spend less time indoors.

While mostly true, falls apart areas US high noon 100F July, 90F 90% humidity making feel like 100F also sticky.

We hang inside air conditioning much June hang heat January. April May months pleasant enough outside.... that's part reason slight dip, suspect. Thanks! Swedish friend situation, hearing firsthand part became fascinated Sweden‚Äôs terrible response pandemic: atrocious. It‚Äôs beyond ridiculous parents risk groups *forced* send children school thereby potentially expose disease *that higher chance killing them*. Well either face [large fines]( worse, threats child taken away state. It‚Äôs deeply horrifying many parents Sweden situation. well worth watching video [features firsthand testimony parents struggling inhumane system]( also one things makes go ‚Äúhmmmm‚Äù. one hand Swedish society supposedly high trust authorities think population follow NPI recommendations actually binding enforceable regulations required make happen (which turned partially true, tbf). hand, apparently *parents literally cannot trusted state properly educate children home*. bizarre authoritarian *in general*, *especially* situation (a novel virus whose long term effects literally can‚Äôt know point) *especially* parent(s) question risk group. US wants stop testing decrease numbers mean country decreasing numbers done same, buddy. rate going, unlike Canada, US isn‚Äôt going respite waves. Wave 2 devastate already collapsing country. November? Yeah, know, Obama kept promises ‚Äî can‚Äôt wait see Biden turn tide this.

And think it‚Äôs January, begin with. idiocy allowing Trump 2 months wallow self-pity commit treason ought quite interesting winter kicks US still enduring it‚Äôs shitstorm, lol. seatbelt laws constitutional? Sum provided CDC. YMMV. never complained people getting UI money. I'm stating considering original parent comment left fact UI paying much made seem like Americans get $1200 several months. 

that's misleading fuck. 

and sure, gathered $500 billion bailouts loans. free money. oversight loans idk, that's Congress. work someone loves freedumb lot shoots enforcers head, like Dollar Stores around USA.

Sounds great theory, unlike transit enforcement can't enforced properly first while. days history books say cause catastrophic disperse virus US protests riots. #Translation:

100s parents kept children home school spring, despite authorities' clear message school duty applies even parents belong risk group.

Anyone keeps children home, however, risks reported social authorities, fined.

- carrot there, whip applies. Many parents total despair reported social authorities. huge trauma, says mom Lisa Meyler.

When many countries chose close schools reduce spread infection, compulsory schools Sweden continued open. **And even children parents belong risk group go school.** Exceptions made special cases.

If student, despite calls, return school, municipality issue fines least handful announced prepared so.

In Helsingborg, Christian Olsson Head Operations School Leisure Administration. hopes children back fall, otherwise fine high SEK 10,000.

- clear greater understanding spring choosing go school. get back lawmakers want lawmakers tell us go school that's is.

Lisa Meyler chronic illness makes extra anxious getting coronary infection, taught 12-year-old daughter herself, something municipality accepted spring.

She 300 parents formed Facebook group upset municipalities reporting concerns children come school. Lisa Meyler thinks authorities talk children's right school, without thinking even important considerations.

- **Why take account children risk coming home infecting parents, actually risk losing lives end intensive care. take account best children, parents life, says Lisa Meyler.**  *what today peter? today worst day life?*

...ohhhh yeah That's sort one absurd reasons like him. 

More realistically, could also vast chunk wealth Berkshire Hathaway, spends time eco vaccine crusading around country, Berkshire considerable investments industries. far largest wind energy producers country, investments vaccine producing companies. honest person, would put disclaimers positioned personally profit free government corporate welfare handouts, lobbying public, pressuring government doing. 

Tldr basically much prolific Al Gore, global warming efforts trying force many people buying vaccines possible. China explicitly excluding asymptomatic cases 100% cases.

So 50% asymptomatic rate, dropped estimates 10%. NYC, looks like 10% infections ever even got tested; definitely lot people told stay away hospitals get tested unless became severe, still fairly low contra China, maybe 5% better number.

Unclear situation ""will need hospital care"" redefined different circumstances. arcticle RESTRICTED EUROPE much many CORONAI-IN-USA-RELATED articles. know what's happening country anyways WONT HELP.

Thoughts? biggest risk getting infected players players getting tested daily? Unless staff, trainers facility staff tested daily, takes one game SSE occur. True one asking bitchasspence wearing mask? amazing level ignorance idiots. reality ""It's right wear mask!"" coming true. First all, think assumption article talking one specific vaccine referring vaccines general. Second, even read it?  
  However, experts say immunizing around elderly may help protect them.
  Speaking House Lords science technology committee London, U.K., researchers said targeting different groups population vaccines closely studied world races develop vaccine novel coronavirus.  
  ""Sometimes possible protect vulnerable group targeting another group this, example, done influenza. past years, U.K. forefront rolling live attenuated vaccine children,"" Prof. Peter Openshaw Imperial College London said committee hearing earlier week.
  Openshaw said administering seasonal nasal spray flu vaccine children often get severe influenza helps protect grandparents, example.
  could said COVID-19 vaccine, added
 
This ENTIRE point vaccines. complete miracle cures. lower infection transmission, sometimes completely get it, spread people vulnerable cannot get vaccines various reasons.  
  
Third, article say ""may"". trials going testing people 65+ like Oxford insane. unexpected. insane. Yup  protestors helping things ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, move needs to.‚Äù 2,300 number, feeling statistically insignificant some. way put faces numbers, would make things different. 


It's one thing seeing 2300 turn 2301 different story altogether see someone ventilator struggling till last breath. actually doesn't. Case 1 created conditions.

Sure, case 0 created conditions Case 1. However, everyone ELSE family successfully avoided versions Case 1, irregardless case 0. means responsibility brother Sweden behave like rest family likewise, failed. 

ALSO since brother Sweden messed up, STILL responsibility stay quarantined room. cared respected rest family he'd that, rather go spreading contagion around rest house. responsibility rest family ban him. 

But sadly right extent: *should* behave respectfully. fault, theirs. Agreed. Sadly. world changing much fast!! Sports huge part economy. Man, life sure changing. rule law? area state open rebellion since June 8th governor done anything it. can't people critical Swedens strategy? asking questions Sweden sub weeks ago downvoted pretty much everything asked, that's noticed Sweden started paying attention. downvotes opposite effect!

Essentially developer recognized algorithm engagement causing radicalization certain people tried bring attention eventually canned (not going say due directly that) America smartest people also dumbest people earth companies individuals angry right now, Disney pretty low list. closed since March, far responsible biggest competitors. Universal, sea world, Busch gardens open June, merrily spreading disease.

My completely uneducated guess Disney open July either, guess time tell. Overall though, cautious entire rest state (a low bar, sure). Closest one Ohio. that's good long drive. Sheriff Lamb Pinal County Arizona CONTRACTED Covid IG today praising county supervisors enforcing mask policies. I'm glad live county. even kids you‚Äôre willing make sacrifices? No, absolutely zero evidence this. Less prone re-infection? I'll give ""probable"" case. true immunity? Fuck no, zero evidence that. Right, deaths inherently tied number cases. Inequality becomes issue really access medical care, definitely broken early NY (owing test rationing), that‚Äôs resolved point. completely waste quarantine expose business owners twice much chance losing everything...our economy going crash hard trick true leadership, leading bunch people living without individualized impossible choice. 200% agree statement ""if good leadership, could've avoided this"", don't, I'm sure answer is. NY hit 10k barely Florida, thinking????? Good protesting. OP title correct, alarming low number is. hand country split politically soooo.... Fat Cunt wants freebie. Wearing mask infringes neither right free speech right assemble. easy do! Like wearing pants. Michigan green. Wear masks, ya bastards! I'm aware implications, yes, Colombia shithole, people also accurately represented leaders.

It make better you, gringo, please try use ""tu quoque"" fallacies me. Florida needs bring Cuomo interim governor. never to; head thread, see may know covid 19 virus well.

It's rna virus would mutate time.

Coronavirus antibodies may last two three months person becomes infected Covid-19, according new study published¬†Thursday Nature Medicine.

The virus could 1 year 2 decades. Try 0% safe possible NYC early one place, wasn‚Äôt much overall demand travelers could utilized efficiently.

But seeing hundreds hot spots, that‚Äôs many positions fill, reduction efficiency. Obviously can't. Best way crush vitamins snort nose. covid spread toilet seats left - India big trouble - toilets! NWSL anyone? anyone? American perspective, many regions like LA modified ""loose"" lockdowns many business sectors like home repair/construction/remodeling exempt, still maintained relatively flat R 0.9 1.0 re-opened in-store dining &amp; retail. region, based cell phone location data, said 25 30% workforce returned work first month panic. So, possible R get 1.0 even modified lockdowns, depending urban density masking compliance. Sure. panic post Google Apple suddenly tracking you. they've always done Still staying home, rarely venturing out, do, wear mask. possibility already it...but did, mild. think though. think got lucky live area blown Idiotland, USA. Donald said magical. Open state 1,000 cases day... close state 6,000 cases day. 
 
And 2 days early voting, too... Funny worked out. tested 9 times? week ER's fill much simpler effective ways improve situation.

such as? So, listening medical experts explain absolute need face coverings social distancing covid hot spots, reporters ask VP Pence attendees rally Arizona (a hot spot) allowed gather indoors, elbow elbow, masks. answer?  ""Freedom assemble participate political process make personal choices best individual"" ramble ramble, dodge duck. 

Wait. What?

Am missing something? rest task force kept repeating need part. particular, supposed follow directive local state municipalities... Unless attending rally apparently.

Why say ""please wear mask""? big f#cking deal this??? Aaarrgghhhhhhhhh!!!!

Where Europeans offering adopt Americans last week? available. I'm amusing, articulate, well-educated, good cook, speak German, French, Flemish, good pets small children. üòÇ assume has. major news, though. researchers saying past couple months September best case scenario. widely reported on. Hahahahaha....talking freedumb liburdy stuff ... Grim reaper give damn. learned wearing mask really helps allergies... I'm using every Spring regardless! Getting there. Cali, Texas, Florida hit death numbers like northeast did. going ugly. Nope, NYC. thankfully people taking seriously. find anywhere I‚Äôll homeschooling. don‚Äôt trust district actually concern child‚Äôs well health. want paycheck Sign up. appreciate quest truth openess.

Edit:[ sub biased man fighting losing battle , let blame trump. 10s 10000 running around like hooligans month fucked everyone over. is. 3/50 states this... still need app turn on. That's testing more, tested less would many cases!

^ think also brought Weeks cases level = disaster.

A regional lock thing stop point. got far control think masks truly stop it. 

A lockdown thing. Masks, lone policy (I'm saying *don't* mandate masks, obviously part it) actually get shit together. There's also governments, including US, working hide real numbers. useful certain level know stuff like this, also important know understated reality worse. men wildly wealthy advocacy started. 
And I‚Äôm still missing ‚Äúscam‚Äù part. seem equate advocacy behalf interest ‚Äúscam‚Äù. I‚Äôm following. actually gives fuck. drive drunk let people make driving decisions. People allowed drive drunk want.

That's you, sound stupid incredible random members public develop better strategies state federal governments. Spain per confirmed cases 50%!
If put asymptomatic undiagnosed cases together (5.2% population, 2.44M), would give percentage 5.1% infected.

http://imgur.com/a/1GA49be Appreciate haha let's honest started Florida Texas. start apology statement ""we fucked up"" Yeah. meant wasn‚Äôt went 0-100 March. IMO, try finding mask least layer polypropylene. Cloth masks unfortunately guaranteed solution there's correlation mask usage infection rate. Absolutely. There's Mexican restaurant across street apartment bet sweet ass parking lot packed soon lockdown lifted. hell earth.

Imagine sitting ass day without ailments shortages posting reddit life hell. so, everywhere i‚Äôve karen‚Äôs staying six feet away possible. even wasn‚Äôt going on, standing ass crotch me? i‚Äôm store someone standing need go, stand wait finish stroll right behind breath necks. insanely hard stay six feet away many people? Oh mean doomers? /s yes, cause can't breathe imagine is, realm possibility, randomly infected person wandering around Europe early 2019. 

But really sounds like scientists trying understand absurd results.

Lab problems.  Interestingly dem mayors cities Texas specifically banned enforcing mask ordinances iirc.

This makes particularly difficult thing change, means 180 policy. Still, hope it. resident checking here, same. Perhaps I‚Äôll write email Baker, thanks suggestion OP wanna get last stragglers send nonrefundable deposit money first. yeah cases going deceiving public. back work 5 weeks...I knew soon then, know soon now. one convince otherwise...We stayed home June minimum...now time spend quarantined wasted...water bridge..we get start over. time might tests PPE..maybe That‚Äôs laws work. county can‚Äôt enforce something court says don‚Äôt legal authority do. Dallas says everyone needs wear mask, Governor says no, court upholds that, Dallas longer power enforce said law. make people obey law can‚Äôt enforce? could dock close enough! Galveston bit less hour south major Cruise ship port. believe Cruise ships also utilize Houston Ship Channel get industrial side Houston dock (East side Houston). Definitely industry ships come Houston via Ship Channel, Mercy could definitely come Houston wanted to. 70??? vax development efforts across global get masks. know awoke darkness ""immediate"" health emergency known months. failure deal it, prevent ""immediate"" emergency. see McDonald's employee's test positive, shutdown couple hours, reopen? NJ calling in, no. everyone still wearing mask go out. thinking switching face shield though. Shit must serious Texas follow common sense literally one cares anymore? depends U. S. live. see lot people wearing masks, wanna say 1 30 people decide to. one really social distancing either. certainly trail we're month ""spiking"" cases Florida deaths basically budge; compare NY/NJ FL/TX cases vs deaths graphs. Something adding up. 

I think we're starting realize widespread virus already particularly lethal existing endemic viruses. southern states mega mansions small population density getting worse NY infection rate. I‚Äôm astounded people still cannot stay home huge houses city studio stayed windows open walked blocks every evening. It‚Äôs people FL, TX, AZ, etc purposely trying get infected huge suburban lawns houses, cases never gotten bad...and growing. I‚Äôm New Zealand, feeling much sympathy ordinary people USA struggling understand richest country world also impacted. fundamentals : close borders isolate everyone coming in, national period complete lockdown practice social distancing plus hygiene. don‚Äôt get it‚Äôs hard virtually everyone accept necessity. lack single community spirit? much misinformation? Except Vietnam, Thailand, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan bunch countries handled fine. ?? Young people still end hospital (which Texas even implementing measures beginning use convention centers), they're unlikely die. must remember millions people Texas hospital capacity FAR amount meaning even 5-10% known cases (and rising fast) requiring hospitalization kill healthcare system. Also also forgetting CAPACITY means nothing enough staff provide care patients. Adding 200-500 beds going help much staff. Problem multiple states seeing surges instead \*New York\* means staffing going hard pressed\*. NBA first domino fell led first shutdown. They‚Äôre going go far road bubble strategy long possible. amazingly thorough bubble plan, decide shut year, means regardless precautions, think it‚Äôs possible keep COVID out. checked hospital? Yep. live interior California it‚Äôs like chunk Oklahoma floated lodged here. areas becoming cosmopolitan, though. don‚Äôt compare London Sydney yet. logic backwards. fit much reproducing bad boi! **You're supposed outdoing California this.** honestly think people contrarian, trying make point. ""I'm unafraid real virus I'm taking whole family one called ""hot spots"". show doomers!"" Outbreaks continue vaccine herd immunity. outbreak country's ability manage contain smaller outbreaks. country completely stop outbreaks successful ones isolate manage relatively small. NJ.

Some people know Florida concerned personal safety. Meanwhile, rest country laughed us. Yeah bunch people state decent folks, wish best. easy, stay home, wear mask need go out, get comfy favorite indoor activity. I've playing whole lot Minecraft past months keep cabin fever getting me.

As rest laughed us, we, solidarity NYC, offer [the customary salute   get $3500? 

Are assuming everyone got $1200 EVERY month plus $600 unemployment add on? 

$3500 single parent isnt much, terrible great.

Not everyone single living alone.

Edit: Dumbass guidelines say ""Outdoors, mask, six feet apart"" rather safe. would others' personal space outside mask, especially exposure going prolonged. Houston ran ICU beds today. problem. ""To slow building church. That‚Äôs about. world won‚Äôt see that. Why? live behind veil. choose live behind veil. choose hate God.‚Äù

Fuck state waste resources prick. Shoulda prepper wasn‚Äôt problem then. I‚Äôll gladly give things rather die get brain, lung, heart problems rest life. Apparently enough warrant action. Unfortunately may drop bucket end this... vaccine never comes, virus never mutates less virulent form. Yes.

But dozens vaccines within year ready.

How many lives worth spend year mask public? Well done! correct state control vs. federal control; specifically 10th amendment constitution gives power quarantine pandemic states, described federal power (and power used early on, unchallenged courts). pretty settled, morons say unconstitutional local government insist masks reread one favorite amendments... 

The federal government may exert power states variety ways; mainly cut funding. Without looking (so take grain salt), consensus reached across state lines drinking age (and perhaps speed limits?). Someone correct me, wont mind!

The president could easily put mask, urge followers put mask, say trusts us behave responsibly, congress pass bills help us stay home. that. similar way, Obama never said anything ACA getting hashed congress; given popularity, could exerted pressure. end, government whole doesnt really great deal concern citizens well-being, politicians generally derided kooks (like Bernie) weaklings (like Jimmy Carter). (I probably get downvoted saying anything good Carter, one argue meant well) apologies. Exactly many children die start care? liberal biased /s miss baseball. trying salvage season lost cause. It‚Äôs really Imperial‚Äôs fault. sparsely populated county huge number cases originating prison lot cases Americans coming border treatment. Plus lot Imperial workers live Mexico cross border work essential (farming) businesses. don‚Äôt see shutting restaurants stores help them. skyrocket pre-mask, fuller, deeper understanding enormous contagiousness virus. fear people Texas haven‚Äôt learned lessons Massachusetts, did, lockdown could much shorter. thought due Vitamin E acetate, fungus, cobalt?? mean, 300 people know, many hospitalized given time? also includes lot regular med surg floors, post surgical beds, children's hospitals etc. know includes ERs though. normal circumstances fine.  LOL idiot politicians learn test cases. Could easier? ^^^/s Look official stats instead.

Do know folkhalsomyndigheten.se is? He's Florida Man working Maryland undercover might absolute dumbest idea. shit show. admin doesnt clue. lucky, sure.  College entirely different experience people, akin people countries think secondary school (high school). never opened first place!!! little. late. Bro debate over. won. Settle unhumanly? one enforcing it. police Washington rarely even write tickets shoplifting.

There homeless man Seattle threw coffee baby's face released something like 75th time. way officer going risk confrontation angry citizen mask. 1st post see this, dozen Djokovic organising tennis tournament. guess. wish less school restrictions whatever. also health department nasal swabs. Occam's Razor: government far stupid deliberately mismanage anything much incompetence. So, already close once, opened them, reclosing? Orr never close all? Lol choosing bright side understanding risk. already feel like I‚Äôm back school working huge group project idiots aren‚Äôt pulling weight. time instead getting bad grade, might actually die. ü§¨ Huh? thought Trump wanted slow testing down. Yup, big sad :( way that. counting ICU numbers bottom hospitalization number top Knox Co COVID page. virus play politics. infects. believe name Dr. Scarf. Yeah, traveling job I‚Äôm going FL week. Tourists nobody wearing masks. I‚Äôve several local stores don‚Äôt wear them. national chains policy mandates wearing incorrectly. Floridians seem give shit. Meth cup tea. I'm bothered people enjoy meth cannot legally addicts cannot get help need. judge someone enjoys meth?

Why protect others? much people love making excuses reason. Like different stores placed different levels risk. store amount risk wear mask... minimal. Doesn‚Äôt matter it‚Äôs liquor store grocery store. 

How anyone say colleges universities less risky going liquor store? Colleges... dining halls, shared bathrooms, etc Reduce capacity??? Close down. idiots caused massive surge need blunt instrument stop it. You‚Äôve left us choice incompetence. keep meat plants open. That‚Äôll help. CFR, show it, otherwise irrelevant. 
Mortality rate hospitalizations completely different number.

By way actual infections Florida estimated 10X higher confirmed cases (a bit dated shows vast difference cases Quick google search says 13.5% USA‚Äôs population Black/African-American, 40 million them. Certainly sizeable population there, would say Lol im currently working changing jobs, great job assumimg im nothing complaining reddit. Maybe dont assume much someone dont know? Birx showed map today. heat map directly correlates protests. Even still testing positive?

Edit: downvoting asking information? sub weird. I'm trying educate myself. Restaurants concern especially smaller subs hear people talking owners going regulations.

The thing *really* concerning mega-churches. I've one parking lots packed really hope outbreak one thousands people. I've grinding super Mario Odyssey super star mode hat time past weeks, I'm complete üòî also true incompetence intentionally fueled, encouraged, manipulated malicious actors, suspect happening US (I want trip mod filter I'll say many parties world would benefit collapse US, leave that...) What‚Äôs brawndo? Good brother ü§ù Yeah... deal me. Still received cent, despite qualified approved. Contacting unemployment office literally impossible. Cuomo said threat states' rights! way everyone live long enough get appeal. Same! starting feel horrible eating certain foods, especially pasta potatoes, decided cut lot carbs life. bread, pasta, potatoes since April. eating way greens ever life. Cut rice butter well.

Motivating factor also know virus affects obese/overweight severely want put position something control. 

Down 27lbs counting. Still way lose, 30lbs, I'm proud! sensible comment. hope could spread sense cry babies too, giving political angle every post. Tbf people still use #abottresign it‚Äôll antimask crowd uses it. country (US believe) think Raoult's drugs harm good, wrong, Raoult always searching countries' medical organizations... said World Health Organization Big Data wrong instead true researches true statistics, also said China, India, Saudi Arabia (and countries around), poor countries africa almost everybody healed, there's lot less positive tests. rich countries like France (where live, I'm french), every European countries, North South America (rich bit developed), there're lot positive tests somethng consider. also criticized Recovery (english lab) big data well bad, also said China create virus, comes animal perhaps something lab Wuhan positive cases outside aera China well Trump wrong. also said Science Council France full corrupted doctors full conflicts interests, part council great left said created center Marseille. also pointed doctors rich countries (as well WHO, Recovery, Science Council France) pointless reunions create find medical treatment pointless randomized therapeutic tests said comparative tests doctors must heal patiens, use like objects. also said rich countries (US, France..) would've done since beginning, deaths' rate would divided 2 3. Also, China, there's 20 cases compared lot US, France... worked Wuhan well China labs since 2005 followed folowed matter treatments virus worked everytime. India follow Recovery like China poor less developed countries I'm talking India Raoult also contacts them. also said US' doctors tests veterans after, done big data used France Raoult without (french journalists) knowing veterans Raoult explained explained even US health organizations wrong. treatment's use 2 drogues (hydroxychloroquine azithromycine exist since 60 years everyone said bad, bullshit. also explained medias talk medecine they're experts listen national global organizations listen him. mild case, 8 weeks later I'm still getting daily fever spikes, fatigue random days symptoms like headache, vertigo dizziness reappear. first got ill felt lucky seemed like mild case even bother contacting doctor. isolated waited go. going 3rd week fever gone began think something up. Better late never least like Mexico Almost virus causing economic downturn lockdowns. you. you‚Äôre intelligent. We‚Äôre same. Good luck god bless want total shutdown? exactly play grocery stores closing people running food, power plants shutting power getting shut off, water turned off. likely recent contamination false positive. 

Maybe cross-reactivity similar virus, like mers.

It's long shot earlier, less contagious form coronavirus. that's case find elsewhere eventually. Yea, really need Bill Gates say pool testing anywhere right strategy, subpools too. Say nursing home break 3 pools 60. Maybe test positive break one 12 pools 15. turn negative know good number. keep dividing either pools become small saving anything testing individuals. Even majority population infected pooling save time done right. True, meant say ""in recent memory"". Still...

If **deliberately 100% efficacy infected** 1000 people, would expect see 500 people ultimately show symptoms, way things gone far. perfectly within realm possibility virus existed long time mutated deadly strain. I‚Äôve seen times means ‚Äúalt right mods take sub, make new one.‚Äù one mentioned lot common though. Don‚Äôt COVID; several ear piercings. use travel pillow face hole. Idk would argue players want paychecks unemployment. Pretty big loss someone making millions year. Free Agency eligibility, franchise tag etc. non players obligated play, anyone sit out. won‚Äôt get paid. cut food stamps trump ""delayed"" due public pressure optics cutting safety net pandemic üòÇ 
 
my point they're still available, unlike said America live $1200 understand people may lost jobs ""lockdown"" various reasons? Unemployment zero covid hit. even point trying push? üòÇ 

then also get unemployment unemployment boost, holy shit dude hard think through. They're stuck $1200 like said. add legal migrants worked paid taxes trouble getting benefits. Just...how narrow world view understand everyone great comfortable like you?


Legal migrants who've paid taxes receive benefits well, since would legal residents. fucking hell sound stupider every new comment. He's probably wrong really indictment culture selfishness country. swear enough comment? flushing sound hear season going drain said tell grandparents isolate, happens me. friend's grandparents seen anyone person since began. ones nursing homes, much trouble accepting protocols take governor. again, expect people change lives 80 year olds nursing homes. CDC predicted many 60% medical professonals would quit protracted deadly pandemic scenario, keep mind area, people never limit capacity. heard people saying ""oVeR iT"" grocery stor early March. I'm afraid ignore entirely time :( headlines meant cause panic people seem think ICUs completely filled covid patients Weak work BIG HVAC. major players Deep State cabal. /s Dude actual foil tape use ductwork amazing. Hard work amazing. flexible though. Yes sir it‚Äôs certainly little comforting Maryland past months many 90% wearing CORRECTLY. 

This reminds study asked bunch college dudes wore condoms 95% said yes. asked demonstrate put one correctly like 20% did. 

(For curious pinch tip roll leaving air. increasing risk ripping condom) 

Stay safe!  particular county seeing positive tests day right now, whole state way month ago. hitting like 1000 cases day before, we're around 300 currently hospitalized number dropping well (by around 40 people today). also say think Governor good job taking everything seriously quickly though, lot states seem same. mention government one responsible handling crisis anything discussing government **literally** p#litics

It's like trying explain film, can't name characters, can't mention intentions, can't mention who's bad good, can't mention spoilers, top that; story convoluted almost impossible explain without *some* spoilers.

The expectation ridiculous leaning idiotic. purpose ""p#litical correctness"". Hospital data tracked closely every day NJ days things add up. Recently days discharges outweighing new hospitalizations going total hospitalalized jumped up. think lot data gets reconciled fact screws totals next day, also depends every hospital gets data time. dad staying lock started. He‚Äôs right wing guy initially like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm old survived flu I‚Äôll fine.‚Äù kept trying reason stubborn. Eventually seemed warming idea things bad definitely seasonal flu. getting time go home, would let slip actually hadn‚Äôt changed opinion relented arguments. mostly wants things open back economy isn‚Äôt trashed sell junk eBay. hope parents aren‚Äôt stubborn selfish dad.  50% americans liars it‚Äôll be. taking serious ton people angry decision. imagine tune least change it‚Äôs family members knocking deaths door. whole situation could prevented unfortunately many arrogant people believed hoax think trying help fellow man infringing rights American. There‚Äôs lot vocal people I‚Äôve seen past months leaving nice trail footage showing got point we‚Äôll end even worse. [Exponential  Another Michigander here! seemed like going well, sudden everything opened weeks ago. fair, relieved schedule haircut, I'll wearing mask contact many people, unlike say, bar. hope Detroit see another massive spike anti-mask people come city work. Well 30-45 year olds catching Covid right now, info read indicates, much better chance surviving, less 1% mortality. economy fucked short-sighted leadership is. locked little bit longer, strongly advocated mask usage, might opening successfully right now.. One outbreak time please I've seen sheriffs NC done long time. means gotten dangerous. fact. Good news flew Lufthansa month ago, everyone wear mask. denied someone boarding anything cover with. gave us sandwiches water plane. many people kept masks one said anything. Damn:

~~China~~

~~NYers~~

~~Hispanics~~

~~Young People~~

Drunk people üòÅ remember perfectly logical, perfectly scientific preferred political party making massively unscientific statements, yes Maybe...maybe not... 

At least humans hope left unlike... xD American asshole. Triple aaa short.  Oh it‚Äôs better lol. Especially us looking second shutdown. That‚Äôs going destroy oil companies still standing except big players. No. spreads legionnaire's disease. Lol. wont contact local news, would absolutely love story try force fly corona symptoms. joke since day one. God help ever interact real mod here.  yeah real get cause I'm really digging mask look. think people need get personalized masks instead disposable ones they'll feel same. 

&amp;#x200B;

Really pulls outfit together sometimes though. ""most intensive"" means farmer likely want there. really think famers never take vacation? normal practice hire someone care farm away whatever reason. truffles, saffron, kind spices locally produced used - island everything transported expensive. trying produce much using export things would grow elsewhere climate much warmer Sweden. really wish would stop pretending know much country care much politics don't. insulting claim easy people work agriculture take holiday intensive season literally tells probably grown lived big city, anything connected growing food tending animal stock. Even saw field crop tend apply protection pests diseases see needs it. like computer game.

Blah blah blah. one thinks farming intensive summer. know plenty smallholders, take vacations. easy? Maybe not, it. produce sheep apples. denying that? like optimism people actually around 100 years. Checking Mid MO ......noone wearing masks. Ballpark estimate area ( city live city work ) 10% tops.....thats generous. Fuck DeSantis. legitimately hope gets ass cancer aids dies fire hell real shitty ass burn eternity. Ive seen decline use people relaxing couple weeks ago, last couple days Ive seen way masks signs requiring them. Honestly, think vast majority people realize it‚Äôs hard wear one helps lot spreading it. internet tends give louder voices controversial stances Naw man, wake up, librarians share hive mind speak telepathy, think they're speaking us, heads. like hoard books encourage us read slowly feed knowledge.^^^/s clickbait. GA spiking time highs. use headline tomorrow? save Gorilla Tape special occasions. Cheap duct tape seems stick itself. evidence detector works? keep obese people high risk factors? Pointless, need go full New Zealand style lockdown hard hit areas. *six months ago, fixed ya. Totally bs, generalize american stupidity whole world, problem, others.  forward looking, looking forward next ~~step~~ election most.

FTFY actually listen podcast? matters inasmuch sooner company like Disney publicly hits brakes, sooner many people wake bad Florida.  done it. evidence disprove evidence. 

They back normal now, back living like last year, masks social distancing ecenomy going come better US equivalent. 100% this. Also think hospitals rural areas, big supply equipment. 1 2 respiratory ventilators. 

A critically ill patients could overwhelm system staff... So... whats guess? low balled 15000, seriously many variables models. 

The fact is, lot people going die Florida. Vietnam better us beating rona. EU rational measure. there's somewhere else like shift goalposts address well. Exactly, elected people county. Lewis County (where sheriff said enforce mask wearing) deeply conservative Trump 2 1 ratio. people county mandatory mask wearing sheriff EXACTLY elected do.

Or also believe overturning democratic elections enforcing wicked ideas everyone? Jesus, hooe people never get anywhere near position power democracy gone good. I've always heard ""don't attribute malice adequately explained incompetence"" key word adequately. think basically point, wanted share version saying includes it. Maryland probably true. see almost everyone wearing mask. business forcing masks well. makes sense try get close possible.

No doesn't, work reason described: realistic. way eliminate this, we're always going spike reopen. mean highest opinion country would care. understand hold values we're related. He's sister's father. southern California everyone wears masks stores Lol dumb bot could miss Florida?? I'm visiting NC, say 10% wearing masks. Ran low food, ordered pizza togo. Manager asked lower mask hear me. Flashed visa credit card, backed down. never looked funding democratic candidates. Outside Bernie it‚Äôs corporate interests. may pro science sure fuck aren‚Äôt willing take quarterly drop either.

Corporations run sides aisle. California around 50% üêé üí© Florida crisis. That‚Äôs clickbait. Learn deal rather sticking head sand. 1 small step. need get lot aggressive. early lockdown call always going instrumental. always support neighborly greetings   Thank you, appreciate kind words. need people like you. suggested months ago, got accused basically big brotherism, like driving impaired. drive impaired, hurt others. seeing plastic shields better articles, option seems user friendly. I'm also seeing places liking option better also, especially hard hearing populations ping anytime need encouragement seriously. hard keep everyone around lax takes days get results- sometimes, week. That‚Äôs scary part. NZ tiny island nation global footprint. They're population spread throughout rural hills, valleys mountains. also cases come soon let guard down. That‚Äôs right also naive say opening states impact it. Fake news. 25% confirmed cases 10x testing entire world. Nice try. sub desperately wants china gets me, like leave counties decide what's best them. order preventing counties instituting mask requirements businesses aggressively stupid can't understand it. Like means people Odessa go lives without wear mask counties tried mask requirements reason. Kind makes sick thinking hundred thousands protestors couple weeks. mention thousands would go city city. telling many deaths come protests. poster Chinese propaganda user right? Account created Feb 2020 done post misinformation misdirection away China Covid check history. Probably several alts users give nice little up-vote boost get going.  would almost funny insidious. Correct. Texas bad. New York's issues arose virtually testing, massive shortage PPE medical supplies much less understanding virus.

Texas nearly SIX MONTHS prepare (as well federal government) instead chose reopen regard possible spread like see now, took lessons New York going numbers likely far exceed New York's considering government still restricting access high spread areas.

But right. Texas pillar operate. Like Fucking duh‚Äô I‚Äôm sick fuck idea surprise. seems like ‚Äúsmartest people‚Äù field saw coming god damn mile away -redacted- leaders damn amazed bad turning *I‚Äôm looking mostly -redacted-states* yes -redacted- states guilty hoax narrative pressed hard -redacted- news. Well yeah haha flying right have. luxury Didn‚Äôt pray enough think memorial day tinder reopening bars/restaurants/protests spark. imo bit like getting leg amputated trapped car wreck. last ditch effort save life options exhausted. great, gives better odds survival without. Lol. make 1st wave course Death Disney -- comes. number seems insane. reported 380 cases Canada yesterday I'm really worried things going fast enough. can't imagine scary must everyone US right now. üòî really hope things start take turn soon people able safe.  ""Just comply"" correct approach. many risks actually fining people:

1. risk backlash assholes society want stick man.

2. risk adverse judicial opinion assholes judiciary, might permanently invalidate measures give former license run around maskless.

3. Additional unnecessary contact assholes wearing masks assholes police uniforms also wearing masks.

4. risk get jury summons come determine guilt innocence one assholes, locked deliberation room assholes think right thing wearing mask.

No thank above. need fewer assholes society, unfortunately high concentration relative developed countries. have. 

Let‚Äôs break down. 


If someone future comes past, step butterfly, well know story.

That solves problem right?

I think got it. Where‚Äôs hole logic?


You communicated. past changed. :-)

The way technology moving, humans still here, anyone think achieved time travel say year 22,078 even 2750? close restaurants to? 10 years make movie ""2020: Year Incompetentce (Rated R)"" wonder play Trump, Pence pathetic administration? guess funeral homes get overwhelmed, they‚Äôll tell people bury loved ones back yard. Maybe pick do-it-yourself coffin kits Home Depot. long idiotically start protesting restrictions? think astronaut worry excess co2 lol. (I guess anyone working airtight environments well) try make fun people people video make pretty hard. problem putting others danger. 

So many people put danger measures reasonable prevent danger? clearly lock downs ended mass chaos protests made things worse kept things open.

As COVID hospitalization rates drop fewer fewer people put risk. already low death rate, say counting 80% asymptomatic cases would make death rate microscopic really widespread estimates say. wait... Someone public around others library books they're worried about?....... Agree least 100, per Cent  seems burden falls Boeing airline then, unless airline failed sort safety tests planes. no, relaying information. get feel insignificant driving change major company. Let's take moment show gratitude incredible bodies, constantly vigilant keep us safe healthy! Truly astounding what's going inside us times. US, Trump eventually started acknowledge coronavirus. 

In brazil, leader acknowledged existed, basically said fine people dying. 

I know well brazil's local governments help lower spread, US many states began take measures federal government. Pence hence forth known pepe even stupid brain dead moron amoeba follows. Maybe everywhere. CA saw 32% increase hospitalizations week. Houstons hospitals overwhelmed, sure suggests increase me... Plenty airlines full capacity. learned changed actions Visit winter like now. point would forgive Dr. Fauci losing restraint, taking Louisville Slugger thrust President Covid's knee joints backwards.

I'm sorry hear that, must difficult frustrating deal every day. wanted say read article yesterday face shields best option, they're available public. mask protect wearer, say, face shield will. best you. agree second wave NE US start mid-late July? look chart cases , literally look like chart e^x literally referred **Natural Exponential Function**. dont could go numbers equations stated post , math hard. dont trust maths read posted research papers(dont trust 24/hr news cycle), school ton. link dozens papers researching rates. Damn. getting though plans backtrack.  Thanks! pretty easy, went eating like complete shit never getting couch watching eat exercising lot, kinda melted off. Still got 30-40 pounds go, I'm finally obese category overweight now, I'm pretty happy that. recover easy. sister caught covid even tho healthy person said worse ever felt weeks hell. mask use. president would take situation seriously. terms public health economy. Trump lead fiasco debacle. Can‚Äôt wait ‚ÄúYoUr mOnStEr‚Äù replies (   -_-) r/NotTheOnion think large part country shut early happening NYC. Houston effectively shut time all. time 100 cases per day. Many traced contact travel tristate area. I‚Äôd argue shut actually community spread problem. means first wave covid, second wave. 

When started phased reopening tried right thing. mayor county judge issued mandatory mask order right phase 1 reopen. brilliant governor issued statement saying masks required city official mandates weren‚Äôt enforceable. phase 1 started around 200-300 daily cases (around NY region sits now). phase 2,3... continued sequence time see effect phase. 

The real problem though? Enough people ‚Äúover‚Äù shutdowns useful shutdown nearly impossible enforce point, unless governor issues stay home order. much faith humanity. lot shit could easily avoided ""common"" sense.

Feel free anything protect shit hits fan. closest we've ever scenario generation. I'd rather something need need it. destroy Georgia Tech‚Äôs season. Bwahahaha. responses remind dog chasing tail.

Covid precedes human responses 14-28 days, lagtime seems imcomprehensible many people.

Thus, go round round circles. using money ingeniously terrifying way, guy hates FOSS free internet pouring unbelievable money malaria, COVID-19 bathrooms Africa makes fearful. think AB nice balance far. We're averaging 30's 40's cases per day 5,500 tests 4.3 million people. reopened places month ago, bars open, gyms theaters allowed open ( though taking time change things safety), retail open. Ideally would drop near zero cases seen spike 6 people ICU things pretty control.

 next stage conferences, large events, concerts hope rush one much higher risk. Stop following bunker boy suggestion moron.
Keep following ideas country might never recover covid let alone economic relieve. Smarter people Houston sure. Powerful bowels small birds I‚Äôm Texas Abbott towing line it‚Äôs kids partying that‚Äôs spreading dumb.

That said correct significant data point. guess interesting see death rates keep trending really best guess right now. doubled daily counts last two weeks. mom negative took 3 separate tries 4 hours waiting parking lot get test week ago, I‚Äôm guessing testing way available likely testing. I‚Äôm sure positive negative test rate right gives insight well states testing population. maybe make cities less congested walkable. city neighborhood gets high ‚Äúwalkability‚Äù score, it‚Äôs really pleasant relaxing. might stressful don‚Äôt worry killed, it‚Äôs be. America low standards makes ‚Äúlivable‚Äù neighborhood. think both. Malice incompetence Gee seems like something important US could we‚Äôre busy denying there‚Äôs problem... Great idea! Absolutely nothing could go wrong! Someone said ""stocking *before* crisis preparing, stocking *during* crisis hoarding.""

I think that's bit harsh get idea. Stock now. I've months lot TP paper towels shower use. wearing mask people passing even frowned me.

How tell people wearing masks frowning you? Yeah like said, it‚Äôs extreme, really wanted careful, would that. precautions better none course. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs warning everyone Yeah, that's true. However, testing asymptomatic people expanding requirements (less severe symptoms, etc), also expect positive rate decrease. testing people symptoms implies higher positive rate, sure might it. Rofl.

But fucknuts going ruin disabled people, usual. That's option pay plus jail. Works way too. Anyone older alwayd boomer, trump-loving one well.

Unfortunately though early days (early March) lot based research China, studies time, anecdotal evidence. doctors talk among lot different institutions. NYC close contact lot doctors would compare turned That‚Äôs sus all... Someone going enforce it, continue spiral control.

Not sure think enforce it. post office?  Oh thank God. took long? They're dumb think they're smart. Yes,but cocaine.  Higher reported sure. likely higher actual (yet). Trump getting impeachment basically gave green light abuse whistleblowers much wanted to. Remember Lt. Col. Vindman got sacked day Trump acquitted? basically thing. national-wide positive rate around 6%. Definitely low enough pooling. wonder recover tbh. Clearly many Americans care sadly. Golly, gee. Heckfire strudel paste. Who'd thunk it? 

Guess what, Florida: based prevailing mentality, Jesus wants die. 

Oh -- APOLOGIES -- know many Christians kind intelligent folks believe science part God's blessing human intelligence. wrong usurp name Jesus Florida led by, overly populated by, ignorant selfish morons.

To every Floridian brain heart mind soul: get rid death-cult leadership save asses eternal fire flood. Although, honest, doubt there's enough time prevent southern half state water several decades.

Ya shoulda read Carl Hiassen, ya idiots. No. Could. 

We still know what's going happen. Texas Florida starting roll back steps took towards reopening, help. people see someone actually know get sick (kinda fucked thats it'll take, whatever), people start taking seriously. Making definite statement like saying matches flocks ready bit dramatic. Honestly went Italy point USA without full lockdown, beginning new chapter. really hope avoid getting point burn corpses gotta crazy crazies. Tell Russian/ Chinese plan kill Americans, devil kill faithful. didn‚Äôt see it. tell. fuck. 

really. i'm 32 year old millennial, home 3 month old baby (born right stay-at-home orders enacted March) paying bills mortgage husband goes works essential job construction. going making sure make essential trips, wearing masks practicing social distancing. 

meanwhile, boomer parents refuse believe real oppressed tyrannical governor. days ago told new grandson go fuck told mom maybe stay home wear mask. 

they're directing wrong group.. Well sorry think I‚Äôm little ignorant care elderly think start pushing something hoping best work certain age group. Sorry think I‚Äôm wrong opinion started yhis? Yikes  Im nsw australia. alarming outbreak first lockdown measures brought us better place. everything started get normal heard times didnt need lockdown first place everything ok. need wait entire 12 story apartment building catch fire start put fire 1st floor started it? many ICU beds have? article states 1in4 covid hold winter? like me, want leave playstation's side ever, all... feel bad vote. Apple employees least luxury still paid shut down. fucked part aren‚Äôt fortunate put position due selfishness prideful ignorance others. It‚Äôs infuriating best way they're handling it, sure seem like it. Businesses remain open. proper lockdowns place whole state  before? Even shockingly, casinos allowed open? Houston hospitals lying?

Let's also ignore documentation well flu colds spread schools. Covid spreads churches well, schools small classrooms. need wait entire 12 story apartment building catch fire start put fire 1st floor started it? correct. led, led purposefully towards greater stock market numbers. easy mistake incompetence not. competence oopsie. Like Florida reopen Disney.

Absolutely no-one gonna visit US country long time.

Even people do, they're gonna told competent governments get home they'll locked 3 weeks. question IFRs settled. dozens large scale studies throughout world, pointing numbers, number range. 

When comes things matter, let‚Äôs trust science. mayor said first time (no reference timepoint) 70% occupied. I‚Äôm speaking mutually exclusive alternative masks. I‚Äôm saying telling people stay don‚Äôt want something used number ways, including reopen debate. Well, L.A. County well 10 million people, course cases highest, especially testing increases.

if want compare one area another, confine within US? Look US compared rest world:

Only 17 major countries reached 7-day rolling average 15+ confirmed cases per day per million population. 

Of 17, 8 contained spread dropped 15 again. took Italy 84 days, Spain 75 days, France 72, Germany 61, China 54, South Korea 22, Japan 14, Australia 2. 

Meanwhile U.S. 25 cases/mil/day *110 days* now, still way 91.52 *and rising*



The similar U.S. U.K. US crossed 25/mil daily 3/6 UK crossed following day 3/7. countries done poorly managing pandemic, however U.K.'s cases/mill/day 17.36 declining, U.S. 91.52 rising.

Of major countries, Saudi Arabia, Peru, Brazil currently higher daily infection rates US (Peru's numbers questionable though). 

Yes ""confirmed"" cases country less testing less tests. insist tossing comparisons testing rates different, still following:

The US recent testing rate 83.24 per thousand people. Italy's 82.92. Australia's 80.05. Russia's 120.07. Spain's 70 Germany's 60. countries high testing rates, US current infection rates 91.52, far lead, Russia 2nd 53.64, Followed UK 17.36, rest well 10. US, Russia, UK countries list still dropped 15 cases/million/day. US one still *increasing*

Easter 2050 2070 I'm thinking maybe Abbott hire Cuomo. Poor guy gravitas there's sign anyone paying attention. patience trying talk sense dumbass ""I alpha"" still haunts dreams. could charged fraud creating false government documents; point - probably care. end-user fake document gets trouble, care. source document gets caught charged, care, Trump courts dismiss it. 

The whole point continue push ""muh rights"" issue, generate controversy, devote hours FoxNews talking heads blab it. someone gets fight this, someone gets shot, maced, serve purposes even better. Global testing like 120 mil including figure way, I'm US president says biggest, best, beautiful testing world. possible. Buy book mean, Hurricane Katrina hit '05, zero recorded covid-19 deaths four weeks followed. 

I think might something here. Dude get fuck outta full ICU bro Don‚Äôt drag third world countries like that. third world country half family lives mandatory masks still lock borders closed. southern US nowhere near competent. silver lining gonna creative new solutions become standard they‚Äôre ALSO going work lot viruses.

Unfortunately stupid ignorant also loudest. people decent. place work essential according corporate masks required worn employees. manager said screw wearing masks, know stores around us aren't. frustrating thing actually answers slow stop virus March, there's many people either ignore/don't believe answers, simply want anything laziness lack compassion. close bars dine restaurants, make masks mandatory public indoors places, things nearly bad. states OK right things place.  We're #1! close eyes real tight, ground. ""Which immediate concern.""

Being 100% Normal ICU capacity definitely seems like immediate concern.

Unreal. Yeah fuck people want spend quality time families loved ones odds 99,999 100,000, let's wish best! id watch lol one saying hospitals 100% full COVID19 patients. 

it's *really* bad hospital hits capacity. quality care drops severely start deaths things kill someone overloaded hospital.

here NY tens thousands non-COVID19 deaths normal historical average system overloaded

but hey bother learning us Italy, got freedom wear mask.  ""will die with"" FTFY heard, rn, texas children's med center med surge ratios 10-12 unit reopened take adult patients. Pretty messed up. know calling current surge capacity sustainable. Hopefully travel nurses get soon.

With 20 million total infections, would make IFR twice high CDCs previous ‚Äúbest estimate‚Äù. Hang second thought 3 days ago said ""full 2 weeks""?

Imagine testing Texas rigorous? 

I think Texas lead cases right behind NY end summer (6,177 new cases Texas yesterday according Worldometer). Let's keep mind Texas also one states conflated diagnostic antibody tests, making seem though testing robust paltry test numbers already suggest.

Maybe he's got bug throat. Username checks People need stop acting like inherently discriminatory. LGBT+ people typically higher risk HIV/AIDS, isn‚Äôt always immediately clear. Super good thing, makes sense place years. don‚Äôt want donations spreading HIV again. Lol oh man love thanksgiving side deal drunk relatives fuck Turns highly contagious virus going around bad business reopened. Funny. Hey great, let‚Äôs see results, looking trials months, shit get pot scientists Except Aldi. see checkers sitting. no.. 5-10% maybe Pong Die. Diehard fans guess. Try understand talking talk it. short periods excess deaths old sick died; However short lived make much difference overall mortality year. let's forget America incentivizing hospitals call every possible death ""CV19"" tune $40,000 per death. ‚Äúcurrent projections‚Äù ‚Äúmandates easing‚Äù dumbest thing I've read today. read lot.

* people fuck supermodel hot air balloon tomorrow: 3? 1?
* americans die covid-19 tomorrow: 700 (hint: number climbing back - google 'us covid 19 deaths' handy chart stupidity) food sit-down restaurants (highest risk 26 categories)

Indoor dining right madness. necessary. Hello Duluth! Fuck Essentia  Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* It‚Äôs hoax No, didn't. protest police murdering black people different visiting relatives.

One necessary well-being country. wait vaccine.

Guess one cannot wait? Yeah: protests murders! always replace money....
You never replace precious life...

This heartbreaking see,and live through,please everyone smart virus,and safe! *May*? Fucking pathetic journalism. knew potential kind question this? California New York different phases pandemic. California fraction deaths cases New York had. Plus pandemic easily going away. NY opens people potentially travel spread virus r/whoooosh really hoping good hardcore/punk bands would come Trump era...nope...it's dead think makes sad go back listen Dead Kennedys :(

I play bass! Let's haha. feeling it‚Äôs uncovered much money pouring market keep things looking good political reasons, left worst shape history country.

I think it‚Äôs going take decade uncover damage done - that‚Äôs even referring virus. That‚Äôs whole different ballgame.

Have tip toe around political topics, life don‚Äôt understand power still power. It‚Äôs like 2020 weird alternate reality. It‚Äôs beyond comprehension happening right front everyone... zero consequences actions inactions. never understand guess. probably don‚Äôt want to. Recently, news came sheriffs five cities stated enforcing Newsom's call masks. wonder they're saying now. Yet county judge thumb ass 
I posted comment post, asking enforcing six foot distance, hand washing stations forth. got answer. Everytime go go city lack care here. 
Everytime I'm one mask, even cop pulled us recently, one washes hands. see people close one another, large crowds packed businesses. Insane You‚Äôre boss Oh sure!!! I‚Äôm teacher I‚Äôve worked 40-70 hours retail/food summer since 14 years old. spike mid-summer, we‚Äôre totally utterly screwed. current summer workplace health inspection today Board Health really cracking food establishments.. making sure masks enforced (staff customers), increased sanitation, plexi glass installed where/when possible, distancing occurring, etc. actually felt much better things talking today. ""...And die"" Bro tbh sympathy‚Äôs lmao blame trump, boot lickers, cult this. didn't. Gotta love narrative. Here‚Äôs concept - it‚Äôs both! incivility? Dr John Campbell said one recent videos, Americas vaccines update, vaccine won‚Äôt available end 2021. hold water Fauci says knows?  Finally legitimate excuse avoid thanksgiving Wasn‚Äôt protest I‚Äôm sure. even go far. already pay everyone else higher costs. Voting mail. We've always done it, works great. Nope, Dem. think virus political. I'm ""let's go open concert venues"" I'm also ""this virus going kill million us stay locked down."" sub actively refusing acknowledge anything hopeful ridiculous. Really curious exactly shilling? Mmm Haha let's see changes anyone's minds. think would take death rate north 20%. really bad feeling this. honestly know would stage power. close everything destroy economy even already bad is. let virus go wild get overwhelmed hospitals lots lots people dead. Honestly, shitshow stage. take serious beginning? worst president history United States people gonna pay it. Local Hospital half capacity growing virus evolving become worse? No. dont balls leave know better anywhere else lot put this? Imagine retarded piece shit response control pandemic folksy wisdom. read right? there‚Äôs around 1000 icu beds available?  Yeah, shoutout Arizona highest number daily new cases per capita! üíÄ time grad school travel restrictions. Many lifting GRE testing requirements. going back Fall reboot PhD. 

I would tried Rice, don‚Äôt pay tuition state schools - huge motivator right there. Well, sure, nobody sick won‚Äôt spread! Try Florida, numerous people using HOA gym asymptomatic report positive case days later. like week two rinse repeat this. laugh didn‚Äôt moron charge actually say that? Brilliant four stage strategy (from Yes, Minister)

In stage one, say nothing going happen. 

Stage two, say something may happen, nothing it.

In stage three, say maybe something it, there‚Äôs nothing do.

Stage four, say maybe something could done, it‚Äôs late now. still doesn‚Äôt sway people. It‚Äôs sad. Remember protests downtown Houston couple weeks ago? caused this. reported now, it‚Äôs around awhile Actually read BBC regularly hard date right normal situations kinda worry else around like DEFINITELY worry least me.ppl shady stuff like let someone talking burn want wear mask winning yet ? wait, sub post biggest problem resulting covid, none ones? cool. Well paracetamol sounds fancy, guess worth it. live Houston hiding bathroom break. Time get back tables see they‚Äôre ready essential dessert!   Austin TX I'm still seeing good mask usage, LOTS people going normal day life. thinks schools spread so.fast NYC wat astounds ignorant people are, I'm convinced Reddit living parents government's dollar.

Businesses bring everything require survive seem think show goes one's working.

Let farmers grocery stores shut employees concerned health. I'm sure Reddit fatties would kicking fucking screaming then.

Why people refuse go work deserve jobs back want return? There's people willing work right may need job more. can't surprised. States fund public schools full idiots. done nothing like NY, gotten smashed tons deaths lower cases eh? Personally, think it‚Äôs early protest/COVID-19 spike numbers available. Especially since they‚Äôre still happening places around world. Spring break would‚Äôve ended months ago, long enough vacationers return home, show symptoms spread virus unknowingly. I‚Äôd willing wager month two, similar stories available making correlation too. thanks saying doesn‚Äôt diminish point. 23% positive antibodies back April man. We're 50% RIP Houston 11,000 40,000 TX FL. hospital ship PR stunt, that's NYC get utilize it, take patients.  KazooAtTheZoo born great void time. Actually people aren‚Äôt wearing masks indoors since many counties decided it. went McDonald‚Äôs without mask...and gas station without mask today...(maybe 10% wear masks). Much illinois ‚Äòpritzger sucks‚Äô signs yard. Chicago place illinois ever high hospitalizations...the rest state moved life. Yet another classic example fear mongering. time, incorrect belt road initiative paying them. can't friends they're dead, either. work directly hospital. shut elective surgery entirely month, furloughed half staff time. Luckily paid, ramped electives back last 2 weeks bigtime. They're running 30-40 cases fuckin Saturdays. Average weekdays 60-80 U.S worst day every day. catching cases earlier March April. Give couple weeks see severity looks hospitals get overrun like New York Corps, cops ... covid19... straight trash don‚Äôt make sense bro Hospitalizations deaths lag new cases week two. pens anymore Australia. Either $100 tap pay enter pin. Florida cases rising younger demo hasn‚Äôt led hospitalizations thus far. Monitoring alarming age group. Hold let us fix real quick Hey! Stop right there... sorry, wait, ok fact checked statement checks out.  I'm sorry math struggle you. worst week flu deaths last decade killed \~1600 people US. COVID multiple weeks 10,000, despite lockdowns. killing people amounts similar heart disease cancer except catch grocery store. 


It's already killed 120,000 people. Remind seasonal flu killed 120,000 people? Getting sick Covid quarantined excellent times re-evaluate will. Yes, like doctors nurses science...makes perfect sense. /s really number lungs last couple months, I‚Äôm sure anything surprises anymore... care others. would happily take care disabled family member, monitarily via aid. stranger - nope, problem stop trying make such. many people talked like ""man, I've hanging per usual, goin house parties blah blah blah, gotten sick.."" yeah douchebag, u everyone else reason fall gonna battle royale covid, flu, allergists, bronchitis standard pneumonia.. feel like I'm disease version super smash bros 28% covid even triple covid patients needed beds would fine good thing illnesses accidents require ICU care happening right now... Oh wait. lmao wait Hawaii becomes special administrative region amazing people still think sort illusion going affect them. many people need die find ICU beds disbelief goes away? absolute thing, like need entire city die something?

It almost makes think people leave homes natural disaster coming towards they'll wait till fire, wall water, etc actually property. people Cincinnatians generally don‚Äôt Kentucky accent experience. Go bit East sure, city proper immediate suburbs really. generic Midwest accent part. It‚Äôs mostly smaller southern Ohio towns Kentucky accent. I‚Äôm either would hope would notice.  Imagine spreading bullshit, called deleted mods.

You win throwing tantrums win life.

(If reply admit aids) Agreed. I'm skipping sweater weather. damn chocolate cake balls it‚Äôd neat place die. wouldn‚Äôt mine dying that‚Äôs black humor inner pride living near bucee‚Äôs.  really think Elon Musk office saying, ""I want fire Bob Amanda scared Coronies, nyeehhahah.""?

Based he's reacted outbreak far, would surprise you? huge concern. flu effect younger people covid19. could huge effects hospitals additional dynamic. 

It interesting, flu shot, higher percentage compliance year. social distancing, mask usage, hand washing effect transmission flu. places hopefully taking illnesses seriously, previous years people worked gone school flu serious colds.

It's important establish guidelines summer people get accustomed learn works Fall disaster. I‚Äôm RT program we‚Äôve gone back 3-person labs.. instructor like ‚Äúthe thermometer reading 85 everyone. Oh well. I‚Äôm going write normal.‚Äù

Don‚Äôt get wrong, symptomatic screening whole lot bullshit (yeah sure maybe screens small percentage people might spread it), don‚Äôt think virus could possibly easily transmissible spread symptomatic people. asymptomatic/presymptomatic debate aside, plenty people spreading without fever. Temp screening pretty much waste time. 

But bother you‚Äôre going fraudulent it? know they‚Äôre rebuilding NRG stadium field hospital live Quebec / Canada, pay shitload taxes, cost 0$ go hospital  It‚Äôs echo chamber, clear pattern events failed leadership. New York governor used power establish rules, wearing mask people would spread virus easily. Texas? someone lives Abbott tool wont back mayor fourth populous city nation. medical center, unless governor something trouble. isn‚Äôt even spike protests Father‚Äôs Day.

It would nice could bury head sand faith governor right thing, can‚Äôt. reality. 1330 normal ICU beds. 2207 surge. They're declaring victory! Mission accomplished! Preach Helping disabled hurts zero ways. asshole care others. sad. form emotional stand point evaluationary stand point. Like many countries, Norway ordered gyms close March prevent spread coronavirus. unlike nation, Norway also funded rigorous study determine whether closings really necessary.

It apparently first randomized trial test whether people [work gyms modest restrictions greater risk infection not. tentative answer two weeks: no. I‚Äôm constantly arguing idiots Nextdoor importance wearing mask. fact think wearing one better mind boggling. Agreed exception, people think it‚Äôs fake lucky ones Asymptomatic super mild cases, innocent ones get hit worse. thought serology showed closer 20%? I've delivering food entire pandemic live Austin, recently state opened literally one wearing masks.. times would step restaurant pick food someone's order would packed person wearing mask. someone ask me, deserve everything coming us Tmc far hospitals icus serving Houston. lots hospitals outside tmc Houston metro area icus. locked time, government jack shit, go recess, gotta vote November believe Iceland fared well also aggressive contact tracing. China warned us January nothing two months. new IFR estimate almost twice CDC presenting ‚Äúbest guess‚Äù? comments thread sounds like people actually happy happening ""at risk""? .. left behind everything already. May well hand outs developed countries. Ted Cruz.  mods encourage it. I've commented half dozen times(that mistake) met mostly toxicity. mod deleted comment told someone ""You read more"" told ""We want promote civil discussion subreddit."" next 3 notifications users telling ""Fuck, stupid"" similar hateful banter. message deleted, hateful shit stays. Nice.

This subreddit shit. pinned top reddit's main page attracted worst worst. wasting time anymore. feel weird wearing mask right now, like left house naked. I'm NM I'm sorry false, higher acuity ER may mean urgent cares PCPs testing-not necessarily tests, people actually need ER might go get test elsewhere. definition hospital overun curiosity. 

You can't say New York lock many people diedz Sweden done one many people died lockdowns work. Italy, China, New Jersey, Texas, Arizona....my state lockdown we've best population adjusted stats country. alone prove lockdowns work? Quick, shut economy! think Elon companies dont employ astroturfing marketing strategy, recognize obvious things then.  getting number? think convince Air Force Navy joint Blue Angels/Thunderbirds fly by? That's way could possibly get situation, think. Haha. medical breakthroughs really uncharted territory, feel free experiment. Lol. Bro, got $1200 like 3 months. 


$500 billion richest rich oversight though. houstonian it‚Äôs gonna easy time store corpses temporarily. live humid hellhole beautiful one nonetheless looked correctly refrigerated trucks gonna needed lot cemeteries gonna need erect mausoleums. trucks give lose power it‚Äôs gonna get even uglier. God damn keep surprised fucking stupid people are? would think I've enough experience know expect shit like keeps surprising me. That's good feel like China's back feet help rest world worked factory less risk getting covid mechanic designated essential workers  guys propose keep country going everything kept locked down?

Wear mask. can't even that. Oh dear could form Kung-Flu Free Confederates KFC. \**a part*, rather *apart*.

Also, fucking eh union awesome! alarmist. start stretching surge double capacity least while. yes issue lock take 4 weeks possibly flatten peak according post also need multiply US number ten None happen we‚Äôll lose millions Americans. We‚Äôre fucked. Huh could've seen coming?  would still issue lot single payer models utilize purely public funded hospitals. 

Let's say government covers everyone says cost surgery X $20,000 promises cover that. Hospitals still count collecting $20,000 performing certain average surgeries pay staff. Losing revenue make effectively government break even. India? shed light things there? question rest world seems cases deaths country many people? makes total sense. don‚Äôt understand people seem determined blame protestors, people fighting basic rights safety, spreading virus. Probably 5-4 decision, Supreme Court ruled President entitled absolute immunity liability civil damages based official Canada wait 12 hours sometimes it‚Äôs ‚Äúfree‚Äù better start welding peoples doors shut Nah you‚Äôre good people thought insane said it'd irresponsible children 2005. Collapse potentially imminent people stupid enough bring new life misery. Can't imagine anything crueler  power neither, dude. US president king banish positive test results. could potentially complicate things cutting federal assistance funding certain things, that's Tuesday, cares. tend wait 14 days bad given month. kind ridiculous reasoning this. course care deaths cars. That's street lights, maximum speeds, crosswalks, right way, host practices laws. Plus enforcement.

Every new car adhere safety regulations allowed streets. COVID, contagious new disease, similar; first see works, allow it, conditions, go out.

The issue can't keep disease inside, people spread it.

Also, silly think letting run rampant mean economy fine. We're fucked either way. country live in? never heard norm? sounds pretty awful, thought usa ran 35% average. country runs 120% normal? what‚Äôs life expectancy there? guys okay lol Since original post removed political. stating facts Houstonian. city leader addressed (we opened soon) via KHOU. believe people dying quickly unprecedented pandemic control virus. comment says, information take process months bad news. people dying, consider emergency? Ahhhh. Gotcha. misunderstood thought meant nurses blacklisted hospitals serving NY. called poll tests (to go along poll taxes), used prevent minorities ""poors"" able vote. literally suggesting return subjugating citizens.

What fuck wrong you? Shanghai disney open since May.

 Yeah, auto mod makes can't discuss reality sometimes. There's still substantial portion population thinks conspiracy Trump, masks help reduce spread mean ""sheep"" death totals fake. admit th asshole traveling protests riots.  point feel like he's actively trying kill people. day age, ignorance choice people still choosing ignorance. pandemic like ultimate achille's heel USA. problem shoot at, bomb oblivion. requires collective self-sacrifice

And Americans good job quarantining social distancing...for while. gets harder make sacrifices American leadership tells sacrifices necessary, vast numbers neighbors outright refuse comply all.

There many Americans soft / selfish hell handle even smallest bit self-sacrifice (e.g., wearing mask outside). result, they'll likely pay health, health neighbors cat MRI. vets wait night, things quiet, transport animals local hospital, anesthetize them, use hospital's MRI machine, take back vet's office, return owner.

That *entire thing* cost $580, meaning hospital *profitably* rented MRI less $500. Meaning $2500 just-the+MRI especial bullshit. yet still boomer get face waiting tonight said mind wearing mask. Like, tap dance grave jerk. I‚Äôve mystified access information come wildly different conclusions others. I‚Äôve quarantined family since early March. Instacart saving grace. go walk around neighborhood every day, swim parents house- 6 ft + apart. Texans behaved like pandemic all. nearby town defying county mask order. People strung liberty. 

I want survive thing. hardly anyone HK virus spread. choice shave pubes. helps understand, hospital something like 80% capacity week ago. climbing percent every day. current pacing projected exceed surge capacity less two weeks. massive growth patients, doubt massive growth car accidents Yippee optimism lol seriousness exactly hoping usa broke 40k+ today sad day friend sad day Thanks dumb liberals Yup. Several people repatriation vacation terminated employment Grim Reaper gladly correct ignorant views conservative. applaud efforts. ‚ò†Ô∏èüëç ...because nothing else will.

Gotta love ""alternative facts"" presented uneducateds anyone listens doctors, look replies tweet instagram post reputable medical source. It‚Äôs littered ‚ÄúI research.‚Äù Cali seeing explosion? thought FL/TEX seeing one cause dumb yokels wearing masks? Damn! That's scary. proposed Oxford vaccine that's final stages clinical trials though? long think take everything goes well. read reports saying year end / early 2021. thing i'm scared rushing vaccine. Dengue vaccine shitshow simply enough trails rushed entire thing. ended killing people never even Dengue. think lot people don‚Äôt see ACA protects aside simply insurance. 

This would really good time insurance companies want away maximum annual pocket spending prohibition lifetime maximum insurance spending. need keep waiting. know cases going up. know ICU numbers going up. know deaths soon follow. either accept facts Florida royally shit bed stay denial. imagine added impediment fewer people would vote rather small number now. think it'd probably unintended consequence lowering average voting age memory fails pretty rapidly many people 60. heard people taking rafts illegally enter border via Florida. Surely escape way? That's excessive. Go beach closer social circle (ie love with) . Find one social distance in. sun, wind, sand make harder pass aerosols others you.  Yeah, it‚Äôs happening. month away cases spiraling control. It‚Äôs fairy dust planning right now. think issue need monitor situation doesn‚Äôt get control. Because, hospitals overwhelmed covid patients, patients going go? happened Italy.  gets ventilator? 75 year old woman covid 25 year old man car accident? 

I idea point AIDS, car crashes, flu. car crashes increasing exponentially, within 4 months death toll car crashes went 1,000 per week 10,000 per week? don‚Äôt think would making changes? 

There‚Äôs real answer situation. But, obviously parts world great job combating virus. entire ‚Äúmasks violating rights‚Äù truly control selfishness looks like it‚Äôs going kill thousands people. result plutocracy.

Putting wealth life standard. apparent right now.

Keep mind even opposition candidate Biden Medicare takes away profits billionaire CEOs insurance companies.

Financially literate people sold forms investments put stock market

Yeah lmfao easy-to-liquidate, non-security investments seeing value dip similar stock market. Ton there. approve message. Even then, though, also said still kind surprising WWE AEW didnt get hit far earlier.

With amount mistakes WWE made since pandemic started, getting hit kind impressive considering Florida's fire. WWE got hit NHL MLB week ago, WWE/AEW active pandemic. 

The ""oh shi-"" thing WWE news amount hit (since, again, Florida exploding right now, since WWE AEW mostly based Florida right now, simple law averages would meant eventually wrestling gets hit matter hard contain it), Kayla Braxton's news (since also disclosed WWE's positive test March apparently caught again.) so...fuck. telling people lying push whatever suits view? COVID cases linked protests, smartphone data protests discouraged movement among urban dwellers disinterested cause. everyone perfectly cool restarting outdoor events? Concerts, sports events, food festivals, parades . long similar density mask usage completely good go, right?

Yes. I'm cool that, aren't?

I said am.

joe: ""so tiel? pretty close right?"" 

nevermind life changing experience question begging asked. try survive. It‚Äôs looking like Mad Max Fury road - every man point show charts timelines states reopening  even second wave. first. Saw counter-protester sign, ""If like mask, gonna hate ventilator"" Yeah always wondering if/why don‚Äôt that. Air purifiers commonly UVC lights them, larger scale? Deaths always lagging indicator. would better wait 2-4 weeks see kind impact today‚Äôs infections number.

But regardless, many people need hospitalization. hospitals stress full, means ancillary deaths increase. 

Car crashes, gunshot victims, heart attacks, food poisoning, etc. proper hospital care, victims incidents make full recoveries. 

When hospital collapsing (or even extremely stressed), patients could otherwise die lack proper care, avoiding hospital fear, unable gain admittance. 3 small kids get really that, well except staying home part.  even selfish, unintelligible.

Hope works data point you. I‚Äôm British Columbia (Canada). We‚Äôve done really good job. Social distancing, schools closed, gatherings etc. kept restaurants open take-out only. kept many construction sites going (with social distancing) well things like golf courses participants could social distance. 

We going Phase 3 soon. Restaurants opening dine-in (with social distancing), movie theatres opening etc. tough things been, due diligence new cases. 

By many states rushing open, that‚Äôs happened bring another wave virus. states start over, locking things get handle things.

India growing 1% means nothing tbh. China India growth usually 5%.  Exact boat you, bad enough people said deserve live healthcare expensive. Nice. Strong Wise. Good immune system also. seen graph confirmed cases? There's exponential increase tests past 2 months, numbers: 

NYC - context, number people live NYC page takes seconds STATE - context, number people live NY State time, 6/22:

23 states report rise new COVID-19 cases; young people South West test daycare rules impossible places turn profit remain open. wife daycare/preschool 18 years place worked last years decided reopen retire. 

Lucky nanny family since lockdown needing one summer able find another family needs one 2 weeks. lot people looking nannies right equal amount competition job. COVID + locust cloud? refuse wear mask beleive put list. list states need ventalitor someone else needs cared people enough wear damn mask, get it. care age. care us. fun breathing. herd immunity, would 980k-1.96M deaths US

hey numbers starting look realistic point! wish they'd come say expect MILLIONS people die people might take seriously. 0.5%-1% death rate possible country.. think we're well 5% point anything help.. wait hospitals overwhelmed lets see spike. really, it‚Äôs mainly states south opened early. States like NY lot protests lowest rate country now. Also protesters still testing positive 1%, far national Scientists say protein virus causes sympathetic towards claim victims chooses spread among loot, protest, riot. It‚Äôs smartest virus history Worst day far... fresh report yesterday shows teachers risk getting infected group. largest risk taxi, bus tram drivers pizza reastaurant cooks. Closing restaurants completely would helped  Don‚Äôt mistaken, human achievements accomplished 10% people. Humanity like train, 10% (our scientist, doctors, engineers) pulling along dead weights. Worse, people kick scream dragged forward. Governor ain't seen nothing yet mother fuckers. Shits get real dog. Trump might idiot lot regards, right intensive testing screwing public perception pandemic (IIRC precise words lot dumber though). COVID-19 deaths US steady downward trend since April. Overall recorded cases horribly stupid metric. Cases requiring hospitalization would interesting.

On hand US one homogenous blob, states sure dire situation covid-wise, headline highly misleading. look Brazil. Bolsonaro still denies thing. people care anyone themselves. bridezilla going get people killed guess chance, situation getting worse Trump would fly overseas somewhere. Maybe australia nz New Jersey checking in! Right we‚Äôre good, I‚Äôm nervous fall. Barley anyone wearing masks live shore beaches packed. Inside wearing masks, anywhere else - nope. unfair blame people get COVID-19 now. US reported 2.5 million cases higher. best thing wear mask, wash hands, prevent touching faces. companies, restaurants, offices open work. Everyone hurting employers open business can't pass paychecks. everyone work home people essential blue collar workers. world day mass pandemic uncertainty America

For another Thursday looked different last peak new infections vs peak deaths six weeks. That‚Äôs peak number deaths pretty high between. Lol fuck many people refusing wear masks? get Compounded arrogance false sense entitlement. Oh, ridiculously selfish too!  They've already forgotten. We're greatest country world, break records daily basis! curve continued trend downward NYC NY State:

The CCP values image global stage freedom citizens. would rather lock journalists jail asking IMPORTANT questions world know really happens behind closed doors. Eh, ""my Socal town"", San Diego, second largest state - pro-mask. can't ""speak generally"" ignoring millions millions people. started four weeks ago, many ended two weeks ago... look label left, florida 4000 new cases per day wisconsin 700 new cases per day. number infected increasing faster florida, rate change number infected (aka rate change rate change) seems higher wisconsin. 

in words, florida going faster wisconsin accelerating faster. ""Promise made. Promise kept.""  eyes look weird wears weird tanning goggles often?

nah, I've lost faith them, appropriately. also given tools coordinate form giant echo chambers scale never possible before. 

So make idiots, made powerful. internet ""stupid"" people. friend mine said world's greatest minds come together answer big questions life. Questions like ""how generate ad revenue"" ""what sell phone considering still basically exact shit last year"". We've let values become utterly corrupt even brilliant people work sustain perpetuate systems live. People want grow ""productive"" even asked hard problems even really means. really care about? actually trying achieve government, economy, health care, military, academic system, etc. mean life well-lived? really comparing elon musk hitler going say proud state, New York, leave American part out. Federal administration basically bungled pandemic bad worth mentioning American citizen turd flushed White House. feel like going right back March

You look back unfortunately wish numbers March levels said done. president killing us. you‚Äôre concerned, probably preparing food. haven‚Äôt gotten food place supermarket since thing started.

Exponential growth goes low hundreds days row mid thousands night? dumb fuck thinking exponential growth showed steady growth time instead instant, dramatic jump. Question, anyone Covid recover reinfected? people recover gain sort immunity? Shocker hitler times could really use Flowbee lol wat like someone trying slow testing something Disparity grow even further, biggest issue. Trump murderer saddest thing NYC hospitals also turn away patients; friend resident crisis; said awhile, enough ICU beds/vents people. Well officialy summer started couple days ago, ger point. hell else supposed keep money? interest rates almost zero everywhere again, would still privilege. many single parent families, well families poverty parents working. point fix problems everyone, would leave solutions vulnerable. Nah can‚Äôt right, recheck numbers  Huh? anything? I'm ""reddit teenager"" far I've seen, many memes introverts made people assume loving this, majority saying possibly first time ever, *want* go school. People consider violation freedom expression technically article clothing view similar government requiring wear something dress certain way. think interesting potential court cases precedent there, without explicitly decided unconstitutional laws still stand, regardless individuals think government shouldn‚Äôt able mandate mask wearing- still protect fellow citizens. don‚Äôt get people can‚Äôt concerned constitution role government mandating certain things ALSO care personal responsibility protecting fellow citizens individual.. both. think it‚Äôs valid legal question doesn‚Äôt mean people shouldn‚Äôt wear masks. 2 weeks protests started lock downs eased.

Man, there‚Äôd way could seen coming, prepared it... hilarious now. Roll 4th July months glorious weather! Thanks, came say this. listened Prof. Drostens (Charite Berlin) podcast yesterday estimates 85 percent infected adults develop symptoms. (Estimating means making judgment based studies read kind statistical problems had. Also note symptoms includes light stuff, like sore throat.) God fuck about? People find they're sick numbers much you? entire workplace needs get tested we're allowed return work, supposed do? get tested fuckwit reddit brain go owie oucie ow reading infection numbers every day? We're supposed collect data virus? supposed roll vaccines get people immunized clue infection numbers? fucking hate anti science fuck wads social media rejecting masks tests hurts feelings whatever little excuse like hiding behind, relatives dealing fighting goddamn virus, read posts like people like advocating stop testing. Without testing relatives know sick able get help time. Please stick getting brain cells drilled oblivion slack jawed California pedo comedians stay scientific discussions. complete tool. Go fuck yourself. Also find highly suspicious low hundreds deaths days suddenly it‚Äôs 2.4k one day.

Jesus tapdancing Christ. It‚Äôs ‚Äúsuspicious,‚Äù exponential growth works. Mild cases shouldnt take it. Data UK showed benefit. What?

I think significant repercussion 9/11 still deeply affects American people [increased military Even today, Defence budget double year 2000. last 20 years, add extra spending, 5 trillion dollars. would American people 5 trillion dollars?

That even counting budget Department Homeland Security increased police spending since 2001. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs going go/is going. regular rooms aren‚Äôt large enough fit two beds either. can‚Äôt move non ICU non Covid patients together. They‚Äôre still different acuities.

Well, ya kno, we're testing more. /s  Trump invested bakery company. eats cake every day dont know.

The US banned import bakery supplies US. American companies come first. According [this back March, 60% Americans one *chronic* underlying health condition 40% two more. 

Unfortunately imagine baseline death rate higher 0.5%  Facemasks inconveniences.

People tend avoid inconveniences.

You call fragile so, hence expect tough guy masochist enjoys Yes, coronavirus makes exception niggers queers, proper. I've also hearing ""It's 200 cases, lift lockdown virus gone"" past three months so... ""only USA"" really correct, Russia South America still lot cases.

Here Germany active cases (we know about!) low Prof. Drosten (our version Dr. Fauci) commented BLM demonstrations ""(large gatherings still) risk there's good chance active carrier among protesters"". California everything right beginning. First shutdown, first get handle cases curve. leaders completely caved pressure. Wild it‚Äôs DEMAND drives sales, supply, huh?

Hey, *bright side* perspective, early 40s; possible. *sucks* actually better financially it. Europe pretty good. date continents however. country opening ‚Äòback normal‚Äô July 1st. music industry chances get income summer manage catch everything ready. us know. wish did. seat stadium, combination anti-masker muh rights people never cared, young people overly excited lockdown subsequently stopped caring older folks chosen outright denial quash fears fucking us immensely. Personally ima stay inside foreseeable future. I'm kill people spreading die covid-19. I'm almost situation 9 week old. state laid plan today honestly can't believe we've spent last 3 months learning training remote learning important get kids back building costs. find hilarious Point problem emergency rooms somehow linked police violence, knowing 104 people got shot last weekend Chicago, including multiple young people, dead (By fellow citizens). see endless videos people getting crap beat gangs violent thugs, yet we're worried cops dealing civil unrest right problem emergency room?  plenty injured officers there, yet minute someone else gets hurt, want someone call 911 help. gonna call Ghostbusters on, what? Holy shit literally zip code lol Yup. There‚Äôs lot resentment Central/Eastern WA, directed Seattle type people live (specifically focused ballot-related choices). 

If science-acknowledging side says one thing, many people gleefully opposite. Considering Germany shutdown public life short lockdown 1 state, Swedens forecast look good. Iirc Germany expects fall 2-3%.  Remember watching Wuhan build 2 hospitals YouTube. wheels need start wheeling Houston. call Pennsyltucky. definitely opposite. don‚Äôt call him, Doug Douchey reason Same. Aussie US seemed like place cool stuff happening. 

Cool stuff still happens - bad overshadowed dystopian spiral cant seem escape. people sure hell vote November, every year. Make sure everybody! Everything's bigger Texas.

People understand exponential function. country returning exponential growth cause evident: riots. society unmanageable epidemic unmanageble too. Unmanged epidemic exponential enough people acquired immunity population density dropped significantly. could millions death suffering serious long-term health complications. Especially large highly urbanized areas endangered, important parts economy concentrated too. Powerty enforce social instability conflicts. anyone actually sees sensible comment, downvoted hell. way people could stay home indefinitely idea unemployment would extended, idea future response payments would happen, idea job would there, little reason believe government could provide coordinated effective economic response long haul, reason believe Trump administration even losing sleep this, clearly articulated endgame whether lockdown would worth ever get back anything resembling normalcy. inconvenience pay mortgage matter. would banks inconvenience recieve money. all, incomparably small overall wealth right? biggies, covid there, boo fucking hoo According worldometers, deathrate among ""closed cases"" 9% now, 5% across (closed &amp; active) 9.7m cases.

If assume double number cases still amount deaths, deathrate would \~2.5%, seems pretty accurate within originally estimated 2-3% I'd say, thats still 10-20x higher flu.

Take step back realize fucked real problems world. Sweden would needed plan race herd immunity. rest lives cases. hey, ultra-rich give pretty little badges says ""hErO"", worth it. 100% people would wear mask think infections would drop lot. Let's honest, US going lockdown large scale again. Lol...but according charts forgot declare ""stop dying day."" people dont think point Look europe. Social life mostly outside things allowed again. Case Spikes seem happen almost exclusicely indoors. 28.5% new confirmed cases asymptomatic moment test. Idiot test.

Anymore, exactly! praised (unlike UK) simply extreme left loves Sweden's politicaI policies. words, ready look way criticize silly polItics Nice Lost implies got upon time. Here's cached version: 

u/brobinson2001 contacted Wix site:   Bad headline. They're historical deaths. Market forces Unchecked exponential growth. mention R0 much anymore likely gone significantly since US ""reopened"".

We're week behind detecting new infections US likely 80k per day right now. 3 weeks, 10% die 8k dead per day!! yeah really see NATO fuck American Bear decides roll flatten us. Please America fuck us thanks. 1 thing. choose vape infectious. dont choose get coronavirus spreading like wild fire US. churches? Holy shit, thats horrific thats true, kind assumed tied pedo priest issue   like changed pace used big words time. However, writing circles attempt sound intelligent.

But wouldn‚Äôt expect someone went party 150 people pandemic understand basic English facts. go eat jesus drink blood share car pub LOL another triggered fool testing leads cases leads deaths /s  Considering Ireland worst deaths per capita ratios (despite lockdown), seems like odd pick argue lockdown. anyone put one would infringement ‚Äúliberty.‚Äù

It common belief liberty infringes people's liberty put stop something.  liberty drive car 120 mph wrong side road. liberty hunt squirrels Uzi playground children playing.

Not wearing mask makes awful pandemic last longer.. makes getting basic health care much tougher get.  wearing mask shows selfish.. I've trying look, anyone report overall death toll US last 10 years year year average? Google bogged COVID stuff I'm trying see year stacks previous years? Thanks! First all, northern states seems taking seriously, would act buffer zone.

And second... side think NATO take? Canada alone. safe friend! I‚Äôm afraid get worse gets better. I‚Äôm still waiting someone claim people crisis actors meant make POTUS look bad. qualify criminal reckless endangerment. narrative that?

Australia essentially cases. went lockdown started testing struggled find cases. 


Sweden literally close ""fuck it"" strategy. kept almost every single thing open INTENT let virus spread. month hospitalizations already going down. Next week. Can't wait July 4th +14 days.  Duh shit  nothing still got casualties... Gj ok people vulnerable and/or want immunity get vaccine protect them? would care ""anti-vax"" conspiracy theorists get vaccine?

Yes ‚Äî it‚Äôs good it‚Äôs 100% capacity...but almost every medium large size hospital hits 100% capacity flu season. no, don‚Äôt fucking let people start dying according best chances, stupid fucks.

We go DIVERSION. simply send diversion notice dispatch route ambulances away hospital. give enough breathing room discharge patients accept Emergency Rooms.

Jesus fucking Christ, Reddit. COVID serious wear mask, sure. literally metropolitan hospital winter. I'd steer clear UK. We're pretty much becoming America-Lite Swabs quite likely generate false negatives due failure pick sufficient viral material. People tested negative developed symptoms later go get another test, possible got tested early, virus replicated enough airways show test.

Antibody tests quite likely generate false positives due picking wrong types antibodies, common cold coronavirus (not believed offer protection COVID) lead person falsely believe immune. particular problem low prevelance regions false positive lot likely true positive. also would like highlight country practically implement solution. real world, next impossible. Meanwhile, Florida many misinformed emotional wrecks comments. Yes ‚Äî it‚Äôs good it‚Äôs 100% capacity...but almost every medium large size hospital hits 100% capacity flu season. no, don‚Äôt fucking let people start dying according best chances, stupid fucks.

We go DIVERSION. simply send diversion notice dispatch route ambulances away hospital. give enough breathing room discharge patients accept Emergency Rooms.

Jesus fucking Christ, Reddit. COVID serious wear mask, sure. literally metropolitan hospital winter. Except protests outdoors, transmission rate much lower wear masks. Versus indoor rally masks distancing. One clearly much safer dream live NZ, many ties UK. Spent year 2009, awesome, trying go back realising hardly scratched surface. big second trip leaving march 2020 got cancelled reason.

NZ every democracy wished was, instead failing hard. assume kiwi voter population mentality must it. unusually high level critical forward thinking, low level selfishness? universal needs minority people think gut. Maybe tabloid influence? 

Kiwis, ever think grass greener, take time go really good look local grass. think ""I required tell condition"" dead giveaway. Also, businesses allowed turn away customers? I've seen this, too. think month newfound freedom recklessness inevitable results. like south. Right like re-living March, low numbers watching people stupid. prediction's we'll false comfort suddenly slammed again. need get defensive agree you. seem emotionally vested hating people Texas reason, especially foreigner. Weird. want come across ""ruining it"" her, say virus symptoms therefore can't go. get nobody think selfish etc. lucky cost split remaining people high entire thing called another guests say also pull out.  Reopen way act like virus exist get matter less two months. Get million dead people month set. stop 60% case, herd immunity depends r0 curb spread sans immunity less need, like 90+% infected dies out. Unless course virus mutates sufficiently spreads everyone, become seasonal thing people get reinfected multiple times different strains becomes flu 2.0, would really fucking unfortunate outcome. Ultimately, individual really say widespread mask use is, can't get good sample. Personally, girlfriend sat watching sidewalk counted people walking found 85% mask use DTLA. that's biased sample, course really much valid quick guesstimate day grocery store. According opinion polling, compliance pretty high, maybe people lying? Overall hard say NYC, Chicago, Seattle, Portland, Minneapolis start seeing surges may point, keep way doesnt look way. 

It takes 2-3 weeks first generation infected show data, we‚Äôre seeing right 2nd/3rd/4th generation spread (each one obviously bigger last) materializing affected states deciding reopen everything once. another weeks could actually see subsequent generations protests showing up, given near-universal mask usage. Also athletes get top medical care testing/monitoring. elite citizens, rest us expendable plebs. worse day far... us worst day far Like enforced..... There‚Äôs global pandemic. don‚Äôt let anyone guilt anything. don‚Äôt want take seriously that‚Äôs them, like free feel safe comfortable with, case staying home. fetish masks. Dear God! dreams come true Luckily people charge developing vaccine. know reported? asymptomatic symptoms mild people even bother going hospital. Nobody knows them, nothing know all. never know covid. good thing. Wow literally triggered Key word there.


Yet. agree Texas single person whose actions affect themself, it‚Äôs not, so, satisfying schadenfreude is, it‚Äôs fair indictment. far exhaustive list, find people can't enumerate these, symptoms especially mild young adults.

The way make sure maintain quarantine. 

Most masks people use textile, even less useful procedural (surgical) masks (nevermind FFP2 FFP3, plus eye protection gloves), people can't maintain sterile protocol (because need training order so). could call cargo cult safety, safety theater.

So means minimize exposure reduce chances transmission. shed light things there

Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi deep Community Spread. cases come cities. question rest world seems cases deaths country many people?

Because lockdown helped decrease spread prepare health facilities better. Mumbai Delhi run beds Corona patients health systems overwhelmed there. 

India whole far better, active cases much less recovered cases. need leave...because live US ;)

I live country taking seriously, rather pretending exist everything burns around them.  Meh. Eventually US get Trump reasonably smart. true test. mean, it‚Äôs US, thought already true guys. Yikes. worry America, India coming along real nice Can‚Äôt wait hear tout well things going. superior every country every way regarding COVID-19. choice here. fooks sacrifice bit freedom greater good bunch assholes. World War 2 18 year old sacrificed lives greater good can't sacrifice months eating out?

Extremely good death rates. are."" oldest agricultural fair CT, held end September, already cancelled year. person help checkout grocery store take mask lick fingers could get hold next bag open groceries.

Yeah, told didn‚Äôt need bag. hoaxville PA unfortunately. wish county brain. one last go ""yellow phase"" everyone whined aaid Wolfe blame yada yada. sad virus became political agenda. I'm happy area taking seriously part. Stay safe. guess compared 1.4 billion population little corona. probably former workers German meat packing plants simply left, they're giving disease families. 

Good move! medical standard also refuses donation people recently tattoos piercings. HIV risk, that's all. Netherlands somehow actions taken kids going full force school 3-4 weeks intermittent attendance (well summer break next week), 0 deaths yesterday first time increase cases successfully eliminated curve thus making spread likely (it spread course mostly isolated) want charge, likes idea charge. even Swedish model, particularly like, always consistent better communicated whatever want call American way. really important thing watch document call don't, never really cared OP first place. deliberately obtuse? know whole life never existed? 

How would know a/presymptmatic?

Mandatory masks concession freedom, really want die hill concession comfort much pampered brat. 

Most people ideology agree like other, vocal minority idiots hard time this. 1) nobody saying dont open anything. stop saying that. going lockdown ""fuck it."" That's issue. 

2) favor opening long social distancing mask use enforced. Many people work. people still trying support families also affected this. camp camp B thing. Stay home/ mask supporters hurting much deny science want go back life normal. 

3) funny bring HIV. less able avoided wearing condom taking necessary precautions. Yet mask use violation human rights? one it? something even thought of? Like wearing condom? assault freedom wear mask? protest stop condom use? Hm. Interesting. 

4) HIV affects people personal intimate contact. transfer bodily fluids. Going crowded space contagious deadly disease spread people interest touching you. AIDS spread mechanisms shitting pants. 

5) way word it, want sex stop kill aids. exactly work populations? could restrict anybody HIV+ never allowed sex. Which, would work, GROSS offense human rights. Good luck that. Ironic would suggest something fucking stupid also trying refute staying home kill another virus. actually spreads air instead bodily fluid swaps. 

6) Many developed countries around world government systems place help citizens times great need. moments like this. Manycountries, like denmark, agreements government help pay keep people afloat. US may giving theoretical money per person, vast majority people can't get money. girlfriend hasnt given maybe 30%of money entitled to. Florida system admittedly (by governor) designed make paying people difficult unreliable possible. mention fuckery around business loans never actually helped mom pop businesses. direct, systemic failure United states government. 

7) idiotic fucks stayed home wore masks could moving beyond . Again, much developed world moving past reopening restrictions place. taking steps toward normalcy. large part US obnoxious children keep misbehaving taking recess time away rest class. shaped fuck up, could playing worrying dying hundreds. Weve literally worst day EVER relation covid yesterday. fuck acceptable? 


8) First nothing. weaker flu. similar flu. bit worse flu. freedom speech. riots signs say ""no shirt, shoes, service""? seen offense Liberty itself? laws regarding toplessness? form expression? mask threat human rights? fucking isn't. fucking knock shit off. 

9) spend bit time thinking. Stop speaking uninformed, illogical, emotional arguments. nobody favors. 

10) wanted nice even 10 points post stupid fuck. 3000 people die 9/11: *""Lest Forget""*

120,000 people die due Covid: *""Corona-who?""* Donnie gives $4000 travel credit, I'm booking cruise ASAP! /s still progressive thought there. plan 2 days week school instruction split classes. One group would go Monday-Tuesday, Wednesday would top bottom cleaning day, group would go Thursday-Friday weekend would spent sterilizing. Obviously, staff would clean everyday three days week would seriously thorough cleanings. would phased reopening kids could brought even smaller groups instruct interaction even 2 day weeks. I'm still sure I'm sending kids also supposed option. Americans truly set 8s world test deaths. report honestly. source says otherwise? onus provide source. heard she‚Äôs already started ;-) Whataboutism last defence incompetent. don‚Äôt think trust studies China. plenty people US US scientists study. Gov Douchy certainly punching weight class Keep jealous, looks good you. many misinformed emotional wrecks comments. Yes ‚Äî it‚Äôs good it‚Äôs 100% capacity...but almost every medium large size hospital hits 100% capacity flu season. no, don‚Äôt fucking let people start dying according best chances, stupid fucks.

We go DIVERSION. simply send diversion notice dispatch route ambulances away hospital. give enough breathing room discharge patients accept Emergency Rooms.

Jesus fucking Christ, Reddit. COVID serious wear mask, sure. literally metropolitan hospital winter. similar stat incarcerations too. wtf. [Jus'que ici tout va don‚Äôt leave? seem hate people, place, etc.

Just leave? Ok they‚Äôre fucked like one hour country‚Äôs management Covid-19 fallen 11 points 45% since April

interesting ""rapid"" loss there.. 56 45% three months. think people would rather continue WFH / furlough long possible, go back slaving away office might catch COVID Source? Who's Dr. Jha btw? deaths continuing drop, even cases sky rocketing. Plus protesting everyone saw TV vast majority wearing masks, think Americans said ‚Äúscrew it‚Äù. Yep.  56? Ffs Biden wins Trump going say election rigged. definitely include India UK. state want compare month? Florida? Texas? look increase daily cases increase exponential. Viruses spread exponentialy test capacity usually increases linearly long like Kenneth Copeland blow virus away parishioners fine. /s Bars casinos even less essential, saw retarded (backward)ways people chose act that. mean it‚Äôs kinda expected got hit another wave. feeling it‚Äôs going virus everyone get eventually deal everyone either built immunity vaccine. It‚Äôs like virus that‚Äôs happened, thing different one spreads easier. 

Also, won‚Äôt staying indoors quarantining weaken people‚Äôs immune system aren‚Äôt going anywhere? Wouldn‚Äôt better opening everything letting virus take course instead prolonging it? y‚Äôall reasons need quarantine would like know, trying start arguments anything lol curious Here's direct scienario;

100K people. 1K sick. test correctly finds sicks people, also labels 1K people sick, sick. test 99% accurate (1K mislabeled people 100K). However, tested positive, there's 50/50 chance actually healthy (2K tested positive, 1K sick).

As such, even though test 99% accurate, there's still 50% chance healthy even though tested positive, know among 1K mislabeled people, 1K actually sick people. I‚Äôm pretty sure randomized testing People need fucking civil understanding, different opinion shouldn‚Äôt automatically make someone enemy. biggest loss American lives lifetime parents' lifetimes. Cases actually reported, we're getting started.

Are fucking stupid? k Fellow selfish American here! I‚Äôll end making around $180,000 year. I‚Äôm young, healthy, preexisting conditions, subsidized healthcare would likely end costing pocket current health plan, that‚Äôs ok. 


My mom 60. Old enough major health needs, young qualify Medicare (or Medicaid, whichever is. I‚Äôm dumb always mix two up). I‚Äôd rather subsidize health care millions others like save couple hundred bucks year. 


The fact people declaring bankruptcy medical debt absolutely asinine 1st world country. I'd bet almost everyone carries one also thinks ADA liberal weenie bullshit. many misinformed emotional wrecks comments. Yes ‚Äî it‚Äôs good it‚Äôs 100% capacity...but almost every medium large size hospital hits 100% capacity flu season. no, don‚Äôt fucking let people start dying according best chances, stupid fucks.

We go DIVERSION. simply send diversion notice dispatch route ambulances away hospital. give enough breathing room discharge patients accept Emergency Rooms.

Jesus fucking Christ, Reddit. COVID serious wear mask, sure. literally metropolitan hospital winter. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs political. You‚Äôre situation whole reason mitigation done flatten curve hospitals weren‚Äôt overwhelmed,"" DeSantis said last weekend. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt 100 percent know going happen.‚Äù

That's 100 percent lie. protesting fix Hoss, want dig find plenty evidence first hand accounts. look corona positive subreddit find sorts people complaining barely walk around house anymore, weeks ""recovering"" none ""solid sources"" chose present study shows evidence lung damage found back earliest cases, backed medical community National Institue Health United States America. 

Its guarantee. Theres rhyme reason. Russian roulette. possibility. maybe people thought possible survivor complications would little responsible.

It sounds like convinced hyper critical even likely scientific information, bad thing. please keep mind open. know today partially wrong tomorrow. 

Stay healthy! I‚Äôm server think restaurants close again. make unemployment either (I wasn‚Äôt qualified). Forget cases, wait deaths start rack up.. jackass Trump Jr. listen him. godzilla season? after? curve looks like cubic curve now. awful seeing people take seriously. I've trying get people sign petition Georgia get board mandatory masks - change.org/masksforgeorgia every day china ramping earlier infection cycle reported EXACTLY 2.1% fatality rates wuhan surrounding areas. clear time numbers generated narrative mind. really would've thought running streets like maniacs would stopped anyone explain deaths haven‚Äôt grown number cases? example around April 25th around number cases reported today almost three times many people died per day. Fake testing!? Malaysia open covid testing. outdoor business. Apparently require one. Read obvious lack social distancing people reticent wearing masks causing uptick cases/deaths late. look states enforced good social distancing / mask policies dont see many spikes all, like NY, keeps getting sick people yes, rate like tiny comparison surge. social distancing place majority wear masks numbers relatively low compared states like arizona texas florida etc... opened WAY WAY early aggressively paying price. suppose good bit blamed state governors ie: texas, florida arizona particular, pushing open health advisors NIH opposed idea. guess surmised gung-ho follower trump good idea, maybe careers, bank accounts knows, either way result same. Aggressive opening coming lockdown lack masks/social distancing enforced = massive surges virus. guess blame falls 3. 

1- Trump pushing idea virus threat (therefore making ignorant uneducated refuse wear masks). Even cases ever keeps talking saying going away...

2- Governors hard hit states gumption pushing open ahead schedule. Arizona, Florida Texas meet federal requirements open up, governors decided anyway. top push idea masks public, fact opposed it. choice.

3- People callous cold, care others hurt actions, decided told wear mask violates rights, want children act belligerent reason. reason wear mask unless want facilitate people dying. FACT opinion. 

&amp;#x200B;

The CDC estimated couple days ago may 20 million people US infected. population 330 million give take. 20 million (most dont know it), gets 8 people sick (trip gas station, grocery store, etc....) would nearly half US population. virus prolific, majority wearing masks, entirely feasible, likely. one 10 dies (thats better current rate btw) would 1.6 million dead. Mind wont get high places well social distancing masks, rural america redneck america needs get act together increase number.

&amp;#x200B;

As nation goal reduce amount transmissions, eliminating primary means transmission. done two things (washing hands regularly, well) wearing masks. criminal offense, people arguing rights holding america back able get grip virus. Look rest world, EVERYONE else way way better us, even india china 4x population some. Why? Masks used consistently. treatment, cure, social distancing variables explain why. need spell you. countries well got cases/deaths almost nothing practicing social distancing enforcing mask policies nothing else could cause well, reason well MASKS + social distancing. simply put, wear mask proving two things. 1- idiot cant see fact right front face 2- callous cold person loyalty america, america made americans wearing mask helping DIE... contact trace first test someone see even it, to...ya know, actuslly contact trace. 

These things consistently happening lot places. happened 2 weeks ago cause thing? Also figure 450 total course whole pandemic - figure last week. Nothing new symptoms though, they've site six weeks point, many mechanics medical authorities stated symptoms even that. Wow, man, that's [shrill whine] *so unFAIR!* diarrhea past couple days fever one day went away. COVID possible? Format like this:

`Covid 19 - 0 Liverpool` then? Finally leaders win contest numbers bodies event. Sweden focus lot attention haven‚Äôt officially locked like countries 

However still socially distancing, working home possible etc 

I don‚Äôt think reached herd immunity lots people assume simply didn‚Äôt official lockdown Omg guys still thinking reopening? BLM protests(not mainly) country reopened weeks ago got like 100 new cases.

Iits like solve racism 2 weeks yeahhh lives important ten thousands. Sry im mad family working medical workers blm protest annoyed fuck oit me....but whatever trumps fault anyway right? forgot part we're full fucking idiots. let dreams dreams. Ohh, that's true, we're locusts swarm border Brazil Argentina. heard problem exists since 2015, though. They'll AC, c'mon lol India USA similar kind people care global pandemic. bored. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs excuse go die. love says ""they"", he's egotistic idiot can't say ""we"". psyche dude thing legends. go /r/Florida message spread there. things fine. two weeks nothing yet. bad here. wrong Florida fine. Bet money like thier governor, admit wrong. try hide it. Man live Texas. trying single-handidly keep corona going. People critical condition turned away capacity hospitals. yet people think hoax.

I'm pregnant. Due October. I'm absolutely terrified hospital give birth, husband isnt allowed me. (I'm required c-section several major health reasons). lot people wore masks protests. don‚Äôt fully know consequences yet hasn‚Äôt long enough show data. keep something mind - people gathering large numbers since Memorial Day. See:Florida. protesters visible group people target, aren‚Äôt primary reason Covid-19 spreading - long shot. That's awesome haha workers worked Sweden got it. new cases linked Sweden.

And no, tourists. Australian honestly don‚Äôt understand Pence GOP haven‚Äôt invoked 25th seized control Trump. Looking outside country, would potentially reasonable chance beat Biden, seems bit non persona (wish Bernie given chance, would something see!). rate toxic shit show Trump take down. Biden show keep mouth shut, keep playing best card (‚ÄòI‚Äôm Trump‚Äô). reading wrong? question. I‚Äôve reading seems immunity lasts roughly 6-8 months. would mean every time get it, even mildly, would slowly chip health die? curious. International Astronomical Union defined planet object that:  

orbits star (except rogue planets)   
**has sufficient mass round**, nearly round    
is satellite (moon) another object      
has removed debris small objects area around orbit   

If ain't round, ain't planet enough mass implication gravity crush round. Illinois keeps going too...but get downvoted saying sub. miss old unmarried woman story somewhere? We've got back. Well 4x better 0.375% hospitalised patients die. I‚Äôd say would remarkable. America diverging crimson states starting look like failed states every day. live China, southern city Shenzhen near Hong Kong. still required wear masks travel public transport, customer facing work places, taxis, probably 80-90% people see walking around still wearing masks. We've almost cases area, still recommendation wear masks keep socially distancing. Seeing America treat masks political thing one insane things I've ever witnessed. Houston ICU's 70+ percent noncovid... Funny, wasnt workers Croatia came home like weeks ago?! yeah, us, even let us in? Ah right, sweet tourism money ... want scream 70s ""millions people die ground every year"" **great** news.

Those fuckers love me.

I hate them. become campaign platform, guarantee it. issue businesses spring around sports fucked essential economic livelyhood places. Pegulas Bills Sabres Buffalo bunch restaurants bars service getting fucked hard. Tens thousands jobs gone people still struggling get unemployment reimbursed full economic damages done state. Pegulas good deal natural gas too, huge issues.

We absolutely need shut hard beat government needs more. 2k month per adult, freezes business taxes rent payments, business assistance. needed. countries spending ton. too. Make pandemics Great Again! S√£o Paulo, SP one biggest hospitals Boston- stop elective surgeries- lost 100 million dollars week. Ah makes sense. Bu.t wou.ld th.is wo.rk t.oo? f.eel li.ke t.his. eas.ier rea.d. spending hours lines passport control. Lines zigzag ensure every infected individual expose people.  Sure. Give NFL contract I'll go punter. neighbors idiots. number parties graduation/birthdays/playdates/whatever way high. know they‚Äôll getting together ‚Äújust friends‚Äù set fireworks drink 4th. One hope.

But key points a) even 10x cases reported total deaths exceed 1 million, b) national scale _we better two months ago_. extra tragic one following basic advice. people would go inside buildings people, pandemic over. science researchs true, especial time like this. usually non life threatening though It‚Äôs we‚Äôre opening quickly; It‚Äôs half country didn‚Äôt buy in. everyone wearing masks, going beaches restaurants, would much better position. it‚Äôs worth, Chicago handling pretty well. vast majority people wearing masks. precisely said throwing money going fix shit. Stop getting news TV come back reality. COVID effecting many young people working essential industries. cant see eyes doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs there. also destroys balls ability reproduce wouldn‚Äôt notice it‚Äôs physically visible right? ü•¥ Yes keep watering word mean anything anymore. Trump: vocal 30% still him. Although he's quieter since federal police investigating people around him. also lost Minister Education (which loony). analysts theorize might need start moderate stay power (not impeached). Little fact one talks about, ICU's 70+ percent noncovid. 2020 perspective feels like people upset destruction buildings instead loss life. Okay. country entered blacklist. mean restrictions.

Me (a brit) roommate (American) looking go visit family February. He's alleged we'd return US citizen, allowed entry foreign national.

Out interest, nationality you? ""For betterment humanity""?

Forced social isolation negative effects everything imaginable, general mental health productivity actual risk factor things like cardiovascular disease.

If keep ""stay apart"" shit indefinitely, might actually see deaths ruined lives impacts lockdown virus itself, least 45 so.

Not everybody live like neckbeard go online work online class spend rest day sitting front computer screen. Almost everyone's mental health people's actual livelihoods depend it.

There kids stuck toxic households hometowns can't get away college online. think Americans fat unhealthy now? Well, there's something else coming...

Most strong pro-lockdowners living insulated McMansions established spouses families, (in-person) college degrees cushy work-from-home jobs. people already expected put milestones advancements life hold indefinite period time. think IFR 1.34%, neighborhood? way believe gravity wearing parachutes goes freedom. Still falling

I applaud sentence scientific? Essentiality matter science. can't experiment say something essential. gotta agree. Europeans least perceive view USA bunch Karens Cretins right now, sad. ultimately affect us all. stock market graph rich people's feelings. I've heard conspiracy theory well nuts. people even living reality anymore. One bright sides poorly March early April much room left improvement. room leave improvement, good news later generate. bad things imagine good news August? Well keep mind california alone outpopulates canada. reminding isnt apples apples, concepts least trying civilize healthcare ideal aim Effective May 6th, Baker ordered masks worn public social distancing wasn‚Äôt possible. $300 fine, though couldn‚Äôt really comment strictly it‚Äôs enforced. work nights social distancing mostly possible, though people work sadly don‚Äôt really care. 


Other go grocery store every week two weeks everyone wearing mask, though people, including employees, don‚Äôt bother cover noses mask want scream extent. 


Most people talk treat chore unfortunately, house I‚Äôm planning move ready, I‚Äôm staying parents. I‚Äôm worried bringing home instead worrying me. I‚Äôd like believe I‚Äôm healthy enough less fine, probably wouldn‚Äôt be, assholes complaining masks wearing improperly ‚Äúit‚Äôs uncomfortable‚Äù might literally death someone care aren‚Äôt vegan, aren‚Äôt planting hundred trees year, aren‚Äôt refusing fly commercial airlines aren‚Äôt car pooling driving hybrid car you‚Äôre part problem. Hypocrite. decades radio hosts fox news pumping division there's certain group people hates everyone else. youre looking advice/opinions, based soley youve posted id say yes, child school significantly higher risk compared campus. adult around older children risk exposure controlled much better childs can. Obviously factors weigh them, covid risk alone, id say yes different B b b b Ben Wwwwwwallace! ikr? Schools filthy places hand washing limited, social distancing zero, everyone classroom stale air. known false equivalence. Also known comparing apples oranges. don't? got hit hard NY place right now. really hope find way enforce quarantine state visitors bc lots people Florida, SC, VA, NC family sure run things get really bad.

In mean time, give dirty looks anyone wearing mask. People area pretty good. 90% mask wearing I‚Äôve seen One word: Trump flocking able moronic we're still middle pandemic. Visiting beach essential thing luxury people selfish realise act going anyway could consequences directly hurt someone else. doubt they'll hugely impactful effect people worry, definitely could. look situation texas right there's example things quickly badly backfiring. Either way selfish way thinking. Good know, thanks! Funny mention us, since new cases imported Sweden.  move sometimes feel like moved kind parallel universe. I've never met many people deny obvious reality angrily demand deny too. can't, grew dumbass, so... Hilarious downvoted facts. kinda hope people follow guidelines. Federal leadership could saved 100k lives. There‚Äôs multiple studies showing equal lockdown 50 states would reduced US death toll 40k. problem is, one side *makes* political, side choice. 

We people sides aisle saying ""this partisan issue!"" let's honest - there's one side needs hear message, spelled explicitly using small words. can't wait antibody tests available area. brutally sick almost four months starting December, feel much better, i've noticed many changes. almost short term memory anymore, i've numerous bouts sleepwalking night terrors, almost sense smell anymore, kinds shit. 
Governor puts fingers ears 

Rona go brrrrr

Governor go LA LA LA LA LA

Rona go brrrrr

 Governor sticks head sand There's well 100,000 reported dead months. 

Many dead reported Covid.

CDC shows number deaths spiking 20-40% complete data.

More people would suffering dead things shut down.

I've unemployed, I've hospital, I've known people unemployed, I've known people hospital. I've known people died.

If die, working providing family. hospital, working providing family.


If get laid weeks get unemployment. get another job, maybe essential one.

And odds are, smart, stay healthy, alive live another day work, earn income provide family.


If people complaining hair little long, favorite restaurant takeout would listened stay home orders, washed hands, wore mask, things would lot normal. people would back work. Less people would died. constant talk needing another shutdown, extending ones still place.


But apparently simple hygiene, basic science known 100 years difficult people.

And know laws like 'Employees must wash hands using bathroom' plenty public health regulations exist. 

 Maybe boycott businesses want ignore simple common sense sanitary precautions anyway. make valid points time still statistically significant uptick cases would already begun show major cities protests highest turnouts, sure won‚Äôt know full impact initial data available distinguishable data sets around country well would showing within city‚Äôs numbers Weve done we‚Äôve never country it. Voting mail guarantees disputed election  Better nothing Near similar stat terms [energy well. People started dying? Talk allowed say *Merry Christmas*. CBC news interview Canada scientist.

The idea water hydrophilic, likes grab quite well gives water bunch interesting properties. mask wet (I mean moist), mask quite literally ""magnetize"" moisture droplets air. Would mean would call Barca flu? Liverpool fan, could go that. ventilator hard body; typically last resort. younger are, body able adapt- that's rule goes lot treatments disorders. hope cops really don‚Äôt police shit show. It‚Äôs choice. Let take chances I've worked decade far mix unionised non unionised jobs. I'm complaining anything I've done alright honesty I'm sharing experienced. know everyone worked it. Mafia sending something? can't say anything negative unions? say necessarily people get real cosy Absolutely, really hope emphasis placed soon. good idea frozen samples. However need repeat study different set samples and/or toss March 2019 data. Oh. That's OK then... paying attention lately. COPD fake news used destroy America‚Äôs great coal industry 5% it‚Äôs based confirmed cases, total unconfirmed.  What‚Äôs happening July 18th? might want see doctor sweaty lips water log mask. Um...I know six people it. Four said felt like completely wiped flu, worse. Two hospitalized, one month. acquaintance‚Äôs family four members die. So...yes, I‚Äôd say do. Hold - shape? You‚Äôre fine way are. Nope  Surprise, mothafucka! I'm state declining right held appointments now. 

So no, crazy wanting reschedule. live democratic country.

No. don't. live representative republic. lived democratic country would far better right now. Trump would president. lost popular vote almost 3 million votes. public health laws provisions mandatory compliance health directives public health authority, need better legislators. Good job everyone! Keep up! even ‚Äúeradicate‚Äù it, still need make significant sacrifices keep way area. Hermitage comes significant sacrifices. Sub Zero entered chat. problem. You‚Äôre seeing one side problem looking effects happens can‚Äôt get real education. protect vulnerable don‚Äôt make kids suffer. Education isn‚Äôt essentials. isn‚Äôt, alcohol deemed essential virus? Northeast whole handled reopening really well. feel bad folks work there. I've make two trips walmart last.. 6 ish years? within last month. corporation suck, man, 4 5 people talked couple trips great. Hate say it‚Äôs true.
These selfish people aren‚Äôt getting sick, they‚Äôll start caring covid relatives get it. 
They don‚Äôt empathy anyone else losing family members Definitely lag. Weakening? Unlikely. Better care may contribute small moderate benefit, hard say certain time. Trump primary/direct cause, example sets code conduct conservative local leaders. president political party wear mask calls hoax base gets elected, going wear mask going call hoax. called pandering base big reason public conservative state local officials let situation escalate point. problem. You‚Äôre seeing one side problem looking effects happens can‚Äôt get real education. protect vulnerable don‚Äôt make kids suffer. Education isn‚Äôt essentials. isn‚Äôt, alcohol deemed essential virus? mom works hospital NY. First ICU, ER, cafeteria, halls finally tents outside. Exactly this. It‚Äôs rhetoric lowest possible common denominator. Americans want come Canada summer camping, turns crazy border's closed. Yeah it‚Äôs idiotic, China nuked America, would sell shit to? Yea bit Europe drop cases far higher. Compare plots growth curve Europe vs US time frame. would say worth Europe poorly implemented followed America. think America also issue lack safety net healthcare people really can't afford work reduced hours, take unpaid sick leave. much winning! Yep. Guaranteed are!! busiest season, going capture many tourist dollars can. Even means die it. seems one time events producing huge bump cases. producing cases consistent normal behavior. Going every weekend, wearing masks, etc. Noooooo.... Say ain't so..... could possibly foreseen happening?!  Okay, that's weird way represent it. deaths really smeared weeks before, deaths REPORT yesterday - that's really misleading. government covered wages many frozen companies European countries. Interesting approach. everyone said going pretending lost. Yeah, we‚Äôre talking Switzerland handles problem. original comment reply stating ‚Äúwealthier countries‚Äù helping countries like Peru. country world fully recovered damage inflicted them..

If think foreign aid going anything political necessity point, you‚Äôre sorely mistaken. 

Countries barely keep afloat. last thing they‚Äôre going try help another one, lol. Peru societal collapse doesn‚Äôt work them. amount money, PPE, assistance going bail mess. It‚Äôs turning ‚Äúevery country themselves‚Äù scenario. wrong subreddit. people bought fearmongering hook line sinker. Cases course rise places open up, inevitable always been. severity virus still low vast majority people, IFR low too. report odd way, go days without reporting lump sum. 

Moving 7 day average 25, 108 April always get flamed, really think UBI go anyone making certain income. Maybe cut someone makes $500k/year, graduated scale that. mean, hell waste money giving $1000/month UBI someone already makes million per year? describe greater cultural behavior speak of? exactly root problem? Good! death definitely thing worry w thing. know true toll take (even asymptomatic people) many years. Chronic fatigue, stroke risk, clotting, diabetes, lung damage,......we know people fair ""long haul"". slave even make decent money. we're done rioting looting thousands yet. seems pretty good metric. Oh, realy. expert swedish Law? Almost police saw photos locations wearing masks. Even NYC, mask compliance accepted general population, police reason chose wear masks protests.

Wearing mask completely stop spread infections, sure hell helps. US hospitals still short PPE basic equipements time ??? mask fetishes too! little zipper case need say something. never said disagree current models, I'm questioning reality see. simply say asking ""what if?"" cause mental disturbances conversation over. child born colorblind says sky green, blue. tell him? stop questioning reality green sky see therefore is? That's 5 Also rallies indoors. part Brasil from? people don‚Äôt even know COVID-19 is, haha bought ice cream place nearby yesterday. long,I really wanted soft serve, candy dipped, cone.

I get treat, waiting payment 80 degrees. ice cream melting. Fast.

I realized mistake could yet remove mask payment completed Ann Linde hands dishonest Nordic politician ever come across. seemingly lies lies lies LIES more. wrote [big takedown recent lie filled interview German almost ridiculous. kind foreign minister make falsehoods people one closest allies behaving badly? sacked fiasco interview, really seal deal. 

But Sweden she'lll probably get promotion. cue Swedish Defense Force coming defend probably. say pandemic isn‚Äôt political; correct. way handled sure politics. So. That‚Äôs seems political thought (based NYPD news remember reading couple months ago) cannot feasibly quarantine 14 days every time exposed COVID19, basically occupational hazard point..? Given none samples positive January 2020 expect sign different timeline. would bet contamination lab testing bat ending sewers Except overwhelmingly *are* wearing masks, [there evidence protests led spike makes feel comfortable! Literally one first results google. Keep spreading misinformation friend.

 Soon close 0. So. Much. Edge. much edge probably use cut attention. haven‚Äôt seen uni friends even distance, everyone else uni mingling instagram n swimming together etc
I got stay boyfriend last week rules relaxed uk, still feel guilty picked something pass dad.
It‚Äôs absolutely horrible open instagram sc see everyone socialising, that‚Äôs want world. worst thing people socialising aren‚Äôt ones getting sick... it‚Äôs people work. dead family? That‚Äôs exaggerating lot. evidence children super spreaders virus - anything, super spreaders adults, children. go movies, stores, bowling alleys, can‚Äôt children learn classroom friends?

Also, vaccine may never come might effective Keep mind actual us mortality rates closer 5% moment. LA county surges ravaging Hispanic community due living conditions extremely dense. Theyre worst possible predicament- poor, unsanitary conditions upwards 10 people household. 

It's important truly understand whats causing spread isnt. surges caused protesters, gives us understanding perhaps outdoors masked huge impact spread. It'd great news may impact legislature future pandemic. think people stopped caring around time protests least. seemed like ‚Äúthe end‚Äù covid thousands people started gathering together one seemed care covid anymore. weird one wear face mask South Philly, really sad. Even work REQUIRES face mask signs everywhere enforce it, I'd say 50% coworkers cover mouth face mask. family member thinks it‚Äôs testing more. said recently NJ (where from) tested state - whether raw numbers per capita, can‚Äôt remember - numbers didn‚Äôt go like this. kind shrugs insists it‚Äôs fake news. 

Fox News president fucking dangerous. Whats point? Maybe get net awhile something constructive. Vietnamese American

As Vietnamese I'm wow, wow. really depends conduct poll. I'm Michigan everyone detroit area thinks opening happening fast. Go router suburbs everyone thinks fine done earlier. north evidence coronavirus get it, get it. one got it. This. He'll go along false-narrative containing/beating virus White House pushing point, eventually can't deny reality; fun games state dozen cases day states suffering, state starts seeing thousands cases day, new ballgame. He's gonna watch political career, President would throw bus without second thought. mean, lockdowns increasing... hello Florida Texas proning. covid find really hard stomach neck lie prone position long. special beds facilitate position? sad all, thousands people shoe him, let visitors come we'll expecting crowd brings new cases keeping hospital employees busy. Look people die cancer. cause death cancer. find bodily failure listed. That's someone die from, say, heart attack included disease's morbidity statistics. Hey there's good people US. jaded get, believe us aware that. 

The shitheads usually prominent unfortunately. point we‚Äôre talking Gates vs. Bezos, one decidedly less questionable track record other. It‚Äôs even labor practices, secretly sending private video footage local police authorities pretty awful. listening uniformed masses 

I think meant *uninformed*? Never said wasn‚Äôt going teach three year old year mask wasn‚Äôt responsibility do. I‚Äôm saying is, it‚Äôs ignorant assume mask wearing go without hitch, especially preschoolers. Early educators need plan address issue. certainly hope so. I‚Äôm sure administration starting realize chance hold power. Well that‚Äôs excellent system! Far better nothing offer south. course, we‚Äôre 20 years behind lot things. weather nice. 

What talking regards ‚ÄúKaren parents‚Äù though, ones call school complain reason, perceived slight cause issues attention. talking parents would insist kids wearing mask. also changing view demonizing it. back lash someone covid denier gets covid, feel ashamed say anything infect others.

Like survivor zombie bite come forward, hurting others long run. would enough money buy home brunch lattes, know it! /s can‚Äôt wait til vaccine WH cooks bullshit everyone pay $2000 pocket Even eligible, two weeks much help months-long problem. shit-show, doubt. doesn‚Äôt need say boss  public reason fear contracting coronavirus food food packaging, according U.S. Department Agriculture U.S. Food Drug Administration..

This administration said people need wear masks, agencies hand-in-glove Big Food? ones demonized fat promoted HFCS? 

With respect public health, credible.

Wait Chinese CDC weigh evidence-based information recommendation. basically everyone got F, Michigan (while still failing D-) top class. probably shallow genetic Mormon pools got 1-2% true whether hospitals overloaded not. That‚Äôs many people would need accepted total infections. see teenagers without too, they're millennials either, they're Gen Z I've seen estimates around 0.05% 60, includes underlying conditions. Even though risk long term damage outright death extremely unlikely young healthy people.

There still pretty likely scenario floored weeks breathing difficulty months though, still taken seriously. Google it, ridiculous military gas mask joke I‚Äôd love see contact tracing data informed decision. Somehow, doubt ‚Äúthe bars‚Äù only, even primary, issue.

Having said that, good Florida taking action.  stupidity ? people don‚Äôt care others. effectively already anyway? understanding always putting responsibility customer re-book felt unsafe full flight is. previous versions going citing ""HIPPA"" thought would way longer even best case scenario man really arrested. He's purposely infecting people turn infect others. Lotta white women ticket Mercer Island, tell fact. Shake richie-rich bubble, fine daily, nightly, ever rightly. Make 'em go court, says I, going stop wise up. dear old aunt living cousin, now, aunt one M.I. neighborhood wears mask outside house. cousin husband refuse think Mercer Island residents immune -- biologically, economically. Mercer Island is, mostly, selfish hell. Selfishness cannot tolerated era selfish kill us all. Math is, again, hard. It‚Äôs almost like it‚Äôs purpose. Federal response push virus.

You could conclude fucking idiots. smart enough done purpose. don‚Äôt feel public reliable population put right people power.

Stop trying twist reality suit politics. ‚ÄúNation evenly split issue, within margin error‚Äù Herein lies issue letting counties decide:

Take Dallas county, extremely populous, sprawling area. leadership take action given authority so. temporary reinstatement shelter place, mandated face masks, whole nine yards order get mitigate damage.

But fifteen minutes away Collin county, home northern suburbs Dallas. county leadership vehemently sort damage control regard virus, also home outspoken ‚Äúcovid deniers‚Äù ‚Äúanti-maskers‚Äù. given authority want, do... nothing. would even wager would simply look numbers in-county take steps reopen further. 

Like said... counties fifteen minutes away other. people commute Dallas work. Collin absolutely packed brim restaurants, bars, retail, churches. steps Dallas county could would take could essentially cancelled collin county‚Äôs lack action. 

I‚Äôm saying counties shouldn‚Äôt right decide isn‚Äôt right thing citizens reopening stages continue, 
 things getting worse go backwards, needs uniform action taken within state mitigate this. What's suggestion? skip whole school year? Virtual learning nothing short mess couple months. Let's call COVID-19 is; culling savagely uneducated people. Try wiping surfactant like stuff used scuba &amp; snorkel masks. tips: 

[How prevent glasses fogging wearing mask No, rest world connected. bounced WHO, remember? dude smart yeah point he's saying anything already know. almost annoying hear speak know real problem virus. need people administration start openly putting blame Trump. sad thing reddit weeks ago reading stuff beaches opening grand old time. 

Now I‚Äôm reading article dying inside wishing could say told people. Upvotes downvotes Reddit reflect opinions ""most Americans"".

I sorry news you. Firstly difference marginal somewhat cherry picked. use 7 day moving average deaths June 24 (which better b/c smooths randomness noise), would get FL deaths per capita. Secondly FL experiencing obvious extreme exponential growth, whereas rate increase much slower CA. Yup. feel like gets missed lot, actions freedumbs hurting they‚Äôre hurting innocent people BS well Many states headed direction NY april, like Florida, Arizona Texas. Tennessee Oklahoma example seeing steady increase new [cases positivity wishful thinking say rise cases somehow turn around days.

Seems like everyone blaming reopening surely protests major impact increase coronavirus cases. Sure can.

America - highest daily COVID tests since pandemic began....England - ‚Äúhold beer‚Äù Vent numbers wildly variable (I think first ones saw 97% mortality, later ones supposedly 20%) kind assume point conceptual counting issues.

If lot people still vents, count: ""Vent Deaths / Total Vent Intakes""? count ""Vent Deaths / (vent deaths + vent weanings)""? two different numbers. Dude, I‚Äôm almost 40.

NPC AI. think something actually simpler harder implement. Like really need know anything particular chemistry biology physics figure stuff make sense.

Ideally, method would taught lab portions kinds classes but, fair, coming personal experience, classes fast paced deal new subject matter already difficult understand. students really ""get"" they're even focused figuring lab instructions telling getting everything done turned time. actual understanding takes time bit intellectual freedom play around ideas, basically non-existent within lower level education United States. believe ""experts"" stay quiet tens thousands people go protest. believe hypocrites. It‚Äôs sad, I‚Äôm going procreate this. Seems pretty selfish bring someone world face untold hardships later life due food shortages extreme temperatures. Shame supposedly older, wiser people imagine something like happening put necessary restrictions place. Obviously, that's totally irrelevant discussion. We're talking Microsoft Gates, Nike sweatshop labor. 

Also try making point people lost jobs bills piled families due Microsoft's borderline illegal business practices. Lmao even basic understanding polls work taking indignant tone anyways. 

Why people proud ignorance? shared Solo cups. I‚Äôm trolling? I‚Äôm trying bring positivity doom gloom sub. anyone disagrees labeled troll. Unfortunately him, people going soon forget ineptitude ignorance he's displayed since beginning pandemic. too. Gotta smile outta me. putting someone's joke down. 1) examples taking things away, getting people use things. bit different.


2) Modern society able function without cars. Wearing mask going prevent getting work crash economy.


3) Masks protect you, OTHERS well. person hurt shoving chicken nuggets gullet yourself.

Summer started 4 days ago US. No, problem thing said, completely ubiquitous. Swedes travel normally twice norwegians (there tourism statistics), year different 30th June still travel advice non-essential travel anywhere outside Sweden (after date open countries within Europe). 

And want check, plenty norwegian owners holiday homes Sweden. Due difference expenses two countries would surprised proportion swedish people owning homes Norway higher.  northeast florida near jax, traffic back pre-covid lord get looked like i'm nuts wearing mask. Lmao false equivalence, Karen. Try again. shows stupidity Texas government. Rather waiting another month, purely political reasons, Abbot cronies forced many parts Texas reopen. absolutely obscene.Having go back destructive waiting little bit longer. area, 2 ICU beds open. takes little overwhelm less populous counties. Thank you, well! Especially without compliance things like masks us gonna die but...why speed up? ""Representative democracy."" get country run military junta start whisking away infected people ""quarantine"" Ya ... blame immigrants ... lack intelligence inability listen scientific evidence ... common sense matter. What‚Äôs 
100-30=

After number bigger, 30, number.  Good you, Governor. smart decision. faith population what's right. southerns states need take note well. Actually, whole fucking country does. That's true nationwide, it? don‚Äôt owe explanation they‚Äôll still demand one. 

I got guy store yesterday laughing mask open carrying gun fixed blade knife. 

I asked carrying, course already knowing answer: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs protection, never know people days‚Äù. 

I laughed told that‚Äôs exactly wear mask. I‚Äôm right carry often carry seems silly prepare something unlikely simultaneously refusing protect much greater threat. 

The problem one makes people feel like manly badass makes feel silly. It‚Äôs straight insecurity refuse mask. Reality science way kicking straight fucking teeth regardless one's political affiliation are. dumbass GOP governors learn, matter time. DeSantis cave eventually. can't stand way freight train. Another consideration (my understanding is) 80-90% normal range ICU utilization. figure really mean anything lacking context article give reference % ICU beds full around time last year. 

This could represent steady spread looming catastrophe, can't tell one without context. importantly, autocracy acted protect citizens seriously leaders free societies. 

In fact, list best performing countries dealing covid-19, political system mixed. Western democracies, authoritarian, mixed authoritarian democracies.

It tells us political system seems matter less whether power feel responsible enough something it. national system sends polls phones larger sample sizes. I've never queried one national surveys yet opinion somehow represented? also ironic people said ""open everything big deal!"" wear masks going bars... want say ""protesters!"" Check math, twenty seven feet twenty seven square feet different. 27 square feet per person closer five feet apart. Okay? Norway allowed residents travel previously, clearly stupid decision even back then.

And legality matter play part now, months ignored legality restrictions imposed Sweden. Surely laws changed, be, especially now?  would definitely prioritized doctors currently.  mean, WW1 aftermath might one thing lot world found quite important time. Yeah would ban international travel real effect. Chicago checking in. story. Masks required seen people complain. reopening based legit data trends. weirdness city state terms regulations, overall pretty positive. worry though continue reopen may spike again, spike due travel areas. least mask wearing normalized help. moving holiday equate 2 workers staying home lied press?

These 2 people claimed conditions factory bad, never returned yet, idea. provably lying press.

There company planet fired them.

The holiday thing shitshow caused elon declaring twitter, leaving employees figure handle it. expect fucked next year. also details worked out, leaked email morning of, follow info. to. severity situation increasing, would disastrous consequences would choose something it. 

Glad see good first steps taken. Man, must really sobering conversations last night last thing want state go backwards close businesses,‚Äù Abbott said release spread increasing it‚Äôs concerning. However, hospitals okay ready manage surge effectively appropriately,"" said Dr. Doug Lawson, CEO CHI St. Luke's Health, CHI. 


Today:

Texas closing things back down, surge capacity built convention centers. people read less Dan Brown. first part straight ripped one books. 

It's common trope. uk show Utopia similar premise. know people Texas saying left house. know read online, vocal minority give false impression consensus. immunity proved yet, moreover I've read antibodies dissapear lees 6 months, assuming need 80 per cent people getting virus something doable without huge amount people diyng hospitals. mean, course death toll going go up. However, fact death rate falling due increased knowledge successful interventions realization far cases either asymptomatic extremely mild. changes continue address pandemic going forward. many 50 preexisting conditions? too. Reopening needs done smarter heavy emphasis mask contact tracing. help businesses open close over. Maybe vocally, actions also say don‚Äôt GAF going out.  totally agree much government saying bullshit, I'm angry lies we've told hope officials lose jobs, science clear always clear face masks effective preventing transmission: 

""Various mitigation measures implemented fight coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, including widely adopted social distancing mandated face covering.

I get line thinking. afraid real virus actually killing people afraid vague nebulous concept ""losing rights due government overreach"". paid necessary condition slave. Slavery treated legal system piece property involuntary servitude. agree that. best would one could put multiple tags post. Though I've seen, seems posts flagged Europe Good News, it'd easier search Good News posts manually browse European ones way around. Besides, imagine looking Good News regarding pandemic care less good news coming - want read something positive. Better late never guess fact even considering insane, seriously thought process? months minimum away safe travel thats people actually lock down. bring cheese this. deserves better. much  Apple require masks store? not, why? racist... Oh man. Handmaidens Tale seems like lot everything going on. Brilliant good lot. Take care yourself.

And agree. We're definitely going really dark place. hospital personnel little hospitals stretch damn good, though. Passing great experience ER. always good. doc said nobody ever paid them, though. going wait older coaches staff people health issues already catch virus die, warning MLB NFL guess.

How hell end conclusion? players older coaches staff simply choose Orlando bubble feel safe there. know older coaches staff still catch virus without NBA season resuming go general public majority people tested random times there's even like wearing face masks public? least bubble, everybody would tested around every single day. Everybody bubble must adhere physical distancing face masks would worn practicing playing basketball. head coach Houston Rockets, Mike D'Antoni, head coach New Orleans Pelicans, Alvin Gentry, 69 65 years old, respectively, publicly said want enter bubble Orlando resumption 2019-2020 NBA season. choice shows willingness people NBA want resume season bubble Orlando. We'll see happens though, I'm hoping best lol hate global poor? make money sports right give shit Thanks! going really fucking stupid. Politics real factor here. mods white washing facts. Stop protecting people power making decisions KILLING PEOPLE. 

Shame you.  How‚Äôd get cars inside capitol building? Really? get virus, go say... grocery store, others go, pass along kill them. grew watching time. Played high school college. There‚Äôs many reasons. older get pay attention real world. I‚Äôm liking less less year. honestly doesn‚Äôt happen year. won‚Äôt really even care. 
And anyone knows me, would shocked said that. Hi, black, poor still can't afford healthy care like millions people US. 

There problem definitely poor black people. üôÑ  Pretty much. learned High School biology. 

It sure ain't rocket science. people dumb? behalf Utah, I'm sorry. governor coward. way poll even remotely true. finished drive southern states amount people wearing masks insane. literally called hoax rally despite told quite contrary intelligence officials. No. Deaths hospitalizations continue decline. will. there‚Äôs still enough, many hotspots now. Shame Sweden cluster fuck pandemic.. Bless heart. could reduce transmission. Younger people may likely become hospitalized, they‚Äòre likely unwittingly spreading. favorite line we‚Äôve done everything possible re-open things safely yet cases still rising evidence this? pictures morgues?

Also, massive censorship get cite lack evidence particularly meaningful. burden goes automatically should. There's way China lying numbers. 

That said, right response virus great terms super heavy-handed seemingly effective.  Wear mask. Fucks Sake! haven‚Äôt cure common cold business sense, don‚Äôt really want to. 

Put another way, there‚Äôs need vaccinate common cold. kills one practically one‚Äôs gonna fund research vaccine virus simply can‚Äôt disrupt society. Cold‚Äôs big enough deal warrant vaccine. 

HIV entirely different monster. latency periods. retrovirus, literally inserts DNA, permanently changing it. cell that‚Äôs infected HIV still functions, cell divides, cells HIV DNA. virus reactivate. also ways hiding inside cells makes vaccination practically impossible. 

On top that, HIV literally mutates much HIV patient unique strain, even individual level, strain constantly changing. body mount antibody response infection, time they‚Äôre rolled out, virus changed render obsolete. 

And finally, targets immune system itself. part responsible mediating immunity, less. 

We found vaccine for, remember correctly, Smallpox 5 years. IFR .5% highly infectious disease less 10% country immunity playing anything down. half country gets talking another 700k deaths standard care maintained. relative mine one higher-ups large well-respected hospital, say same. patients (they're hotspot), they're less sick staying long. don‚Äôt doubt lot cross communication going around. tell lot testing, especially beginning, yielded false negatives. patient COVID-19 symptoms, COVID-19 disease progression COVID-19 appearing demise negative test might pushed classified COVID-19 death. quacks like duck, walks like duck swims like duck, cares says isn‚Äôt duck, we‚Äôve found 30% ducks liars?

What see look total deaths realistic picture, especially differences big. captures effect pandemic total population.

For example, flu patient comes ICU epinephrine drips high lose limbs (it constricts blood vessels extremities maintains blood flow essential organs). they‚Äôre quad amputee piss poor circulation overworked staff fails turn get bedsores. bedsores become bone infection die osteomyelitis. flu (virus) casualty even though died bacterial bone infection?

That‚Äôs easy one. heart attack bad flu? Could survived compromised? won‚Äôt know, big data analysis like capture overall impact new disease. deserves butter fantastic mental juggling accept crowds going cause spikes one hand, yet protests cause spikes. Ha. Oh yeah. Saw huddled 100 people one small tent field day. mask fucking sight. Blew mind. That‚Äôs insane unnecessary. I‚Äôm sure enforce probably risk getting people disobeying principle. 

There much simpler effective ways improve situation.  Contact tracers new york allowed ask protests, moot point.

Flattening curve hit pause button months unless travel restricted enforced, be. Everyone please wear mask. would person want protect life? understand insanity. 'rona takes out. 

I love people always assume bad things happen Satan good things always God, situations bad things 'God testing them'. Always moving reasoning fit want believe. 

I want assume people NEED answer literally everything know something (which alot) point religious deity. dangerous happens real answer feel like attacking God really they're narcissists want wrong.

Sorry little rant, close family stuck 'If die that's Gods plan' bs reasoning whatever want right now.  200k dead Americans come back life? where, true leader, would admit approach took date wrong. dismissed downplayed estimated it, paying price lost lives lost livelihoods. 

The lack accountability people make decisions really astounds most. see people wanting crucify tightened much get go, FL TX prove anything, it‚Äôs strict get go, gradually opening (with monitoring) right way go.  Thanks missionaries, vile, repugnant, murdering trash. Case 2 bears sole responsibility actions taken Case 2.

Where logic leads you, analogy real world, Case 1 fault either Case 1 would exist without Case 0. virus originate Sweden, remember? likely US going lift travel ban UK. I‚Äôm supposed going Florida 27th July virgin said it‚Äôs still going ahead even though UK travel ban US. Jesus lol paranoid much ? hey wanted let know appreciate earthcomedy. 

have upvote. :)  Put glasses little bit forward I'll never forget, early March, watching waiter put leftover meal go-box, day started self-isolating. talking it, imagining droplets spewing mouth, eighteen inches, onto half-rack back ribs. Knowing world getting slammed pandemic, knowing people get yet, seeing that...it like watching landing craft approaching Omaha Beach. He's mini Trump. Trump mentality spreading. dangerous. [me San Francisco watching America debate re-opened soon things exact 3 months Yeah, I‚Äôm semi fancy restaurant last weekend around 300+ reservations work kitchen 300+ numbers COVID around. go restroom guests don‚Äôt put masks back it‚Äôs quite terrifying! 

Be safe guys ! Without action, yes. It‚Äôs important make distinction though, actually shut things know, EASIEST THING POSSIBLE MANDATE MASKS help slow case spiking down. 

Exponential growth really cannot fucked around though. go changing nothing 100% correct doubled week, doubled another week etc voted Andrew Gillum, everyone Florida stupid; stupidest people world live Florida Yep got nice completely justified armed uprising.  Yup. give old people morfin care homes. Ofc people testing think may it.

So proved people infected. thousand key workers gave lives bill throws around cash never able spend even lives 1000 years old.
They gave everything stop worshiping rich. Yep looks like NJ revised prior months we‚Äôll find retraction  today announced schools open person fall. suggestions guidelines state superintendent. masks distancing, busses run normal occupancy.
In press conference, state superintendent actually started bragging much visits schools classrooms school year, said ""Of course year."" yeah eliminates spread... feel sorry Floridians best wear masks, social distance keep families safe. throwing there. taxing airlines (instead bailing out) transporting virus US. tax churches super spreader choir practices. tax bars alcohol increased risk. Isn‚Äôt death rate dropping? Ahh optimism people don‚Äôt understand exponential growth.

Let‚Äôs rewind back Trump saying there‚Äôs like 15 cases it‚Äôs going 0 real soon. How‚Äôd turn out? definitely bad boris looked worst press conference fucking high cooked shit up. found somewhere bumfuck basketball courts could renovate, instead going already pretending virus like month ago.

Edit: hell, basketball court teams alternate using it, since there's fans home field advantage.

Edit 2: double hell, talk government. He-whose-name-we-shall-not-speak would whore Area 51 second meant good publicity. Well cultural battle masks buck passed federal government states mostly passed buck city governments city governments decide masks we‚Äôve got.

It‚Äôs person wants take responsibility responsibility falls onto 350 million people make ‚Äúright choice‚Äù wearing masks. point you‚Äôve already failed. don‚Äôt understand rationale open bars all. you‚Äôre kind person who‚Äôs going meet friends bar pandemic, friends certainly willing meet someone‚Äôs home. It‚Äôs great, a) hopefully know friends b) someone it, potential infections within one social group, every group bar. Seems contact tracing would much easier too, even it‚Äôs left patient figure out.

But I‚Äôm clearly optimistic ‚Äúpersonal accountability‚Äù  least easily identify total pieces shit there. Low effort troll 56% hardly majority... wants 'Virusest Place Earth'.

üé∂ 'When Wish Upon Star' üé∂ plays background. 

""Governor DeSantis, tested positive COVID-19, going now?""

""I'm going Disneyworld!""  *""Suit up, boys. time purge heresy.""* thanks legwork!  Lol, I'm city massive protests, protests seemed practice modicum caution, vast majority lot people partying without masks. even going parties every night houses ( stupidly one).

Spare would new car live. would sued won. figure would also need consider many beds per capita areas have. many small counties icu beds, whatever effect hospital system going baked bigger cities numbers. bigger city might one bed every 200 sounds great attached areas beds included maybe one bed per 150 something  vice president reiterated considered president‚Äôs rallies opportunity Americans excercise First Amenment rights freedom speech freedom assembly.  claimed campaign ‚Äúcreating settings people choose participate political process.‚Äù

So asking people wear mask infringe rights ability assemble participate?

His narrative excuses ridiculous. Depends area.

Everyone saying everywhere same. That's true. 30,000 participants USA. UK thousands people already injected vaccine/placebo Brazil South Africa started past week. 

Phase III trials completed 8 months mean can't approved trial ends. Oxford working close MHRA ultimately approve know they're doing. Pray away, Mikey boy. tomorrow get say today. Woooo agree society plays role well. Many people felt built character child job common fathers kids work businesses many people felt gave kids sense responsibility. 

I would lying though said certain headlines I've seen years greedy companies make bit cynical comes free market. I'm perfectly aware free market led amazing things like video games affordable price phone hand I'm able communicate on, also weary allowing free market decide everything without reasonable amount government oversight, believe free market naturally values money life gladly abandon latter means former. takes quick Google search I‚Äôm worried exact scenario. guidance federal government, states implement half measures shut gets bad. But, neighbors open business, vain. 

We continue cycle indefinitely. That's focused river floating Texas tradition getting drunk floating river extremely difficult time getting tube end. 

It's great time. means increase community transmission occurring.

It specifically means actual number cases increasing faster number tests. Without knowing much testing increased, know much Gates total piece shit give fuck us.  Nope, love remember one chapter Stephen King book Stand, cop gets infected Superflu, infect speeder stops gives ticket, speeder goes cafe, infects staff customers, etc. Wow. Florida, man. Smh Also keep mind may alright due healthier average. also know indigenous groups issues respiratory disease, Covid present like that, strictly respiratory disease.

I think gonna mixed bag. 

For record unfortunate. Still enough, far.

Hospitals can‚Äôt run 100% capacity given staff long, chronically understaffed.

You recruit retired docs nurses, it‚Äôs nearly enough. talking IFR calculation, discarded large scale government surveys, used junk studies added fudge factors get ridiculous result.

Are aware recent blog post said 20,000 people died COVID-19 UK?

 people charlatans. really see Trump *added* supporters 2016 now. Hillary popular candidate either. cut/paste legal definition above, read it. people need cut little slack.

In terms developing online courses, sure.  terms dropping prices reflect fact they're delivering less, much. Hereford, Ruxton Mays Chapel North? Oh sell Dear Leader short. He's amazing piece shit.  airline force fly? Haha US, means one twenty financially destroyed extortion racket: ""American Health Care System."" anyone watching briefing- Pence seem ill/nervous? definitely seems uncomfortable. NBA player immune systems good. healthy BMIs too. 

NFL D-linemen different story though. Cdc said 0.26% death rate, that's (at time) 100k deaths, times 400 get number cases. assumes 80% undetected.

I know many hospitalized, especially testing rampant. cdc number wrong, we're kinds fucked harder thought. many infections need NBA learns lesson? Apparently number hasn‚Äòt reached. personally believe so, yes, especially participants wear masks significant degree. long gather indoors (i.e. bars) afterward.  $1,000 90 days jail. Second offense felony.  Source: Less mean minus stated. Go check dictionary believe me. 

preposition 
before subtracting (something); minus. 
""$900,000 less tax"" Yes, lot jobs actually know subject job. Imagine thinking anybody cares thoughts matter. also allows us prepare hospital surges. Sorry, can't tell anymore. guess we're page. bad hospital ships busy. Likely due protests happening directly 2 month shutdown. Idk tho. half aren‚Äôt wearing correctly. amount people exposing nose chin/neck frightening. governors issued early shutdowns actually gained popularity large. Came say this. part people make up. Kinda like understand ADA HIPAA work. feel comfortable saying say stuff absolutely get fired.

But stay safe. ""The Ring Niebelung"", Wagnerian opera. 

There's nothing new sun. Georgia only""shut down""for like 2 weeks. Even real shut down. Businesses allowed decide essential oh Jesus Christ wearing mask deep state. fucking common sense think you‚Äôre right. I‚Äôm contact tracing anything, think we‚Äôre beyond point right now.

We need use methods available us get level contact tracing work. much big undertaking use effectively places peaking like Texas. also requires testing widely available, don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs case lot places around country yet.

But you‚Äôre right. Contact tracing effective way combat thing. See Hong Kong. Someone China sneezes, go low alert. get hit every potential pandemic coming mainland, shit like old hat them. people think earth flat He's right. US done fucked Bill Gates suggests speaks Dr. Anthony Fauci Fauci speaks President Trump, saying, ""I talk regularly, often talks people."" 

I remember everyone hated like hate Bezos now. turned decent presidents. LOL, pollution last thing I'd worried here. fucking love you‚Äôre trying gaslight something obvious. I‚Äôve heard people smelling burnt smoke type smells Covid. It‚Äôs called phantom smell think That's devastating. Sadly number sliver state's true numbers. People need keep mind numbers tell us people 1.) ill enough seek medical assistance. 2.) afford medical assistance. WOW....Im NYC people starting slip much. certain that. Even minor lung heart damage would almost certainly career ending. may meant sincere manner took it.  No, even would get X times money, live let money door, feedback loop created running amok since then. Bill Gates said offhand comment would useful verify vaccine since could without spreading virus. prevent counterfeiting, would likely need chip verify.

That one offhand comment become conspiracy gold. paying attention? lockdowns treated rich fine; initial shock, stock market chugging along getting close pre-shutdown levels already. people really getting hurt small businessowners cash burn stay open despite decreased revenue blue-collar/service industry workers lost jobs instead sent WFH. truly insane. there's reprieve it; whole world way now, worse. hope move country side hope progressive asshole eventually deem illegal live outside densely populated cities due climate change whatever. Martial law thing, imagine whatever they'd martial law. Call 911, allow deliveries, etc. Sounds like cases /r CovidPositive people still sick March, constantly relapsing It‚Äôs terrifying. want coverage nonsense. going canceling today, definitely finish I'll surprised start planned ""Sweden right"" crowd also disappeared OMG hardly watch this. tell Pence's face voice knows he's totally full shit. Fauchi needs grab mike tell truth. Panama City Beach, Florida. People shorten southeastern US it‚Äôs common vacation spot. happen go school VA would you? Mine saying since April needless say little faith it. Exactly. might end catching end, delay getting Covid-19 another 6 months, gives science much longer catch make sure die Leadership still wearing masks... need stay away friend family two three weeks get back, safe. Depends go.  also dorms, interaction instructors students, plus classes lab section lecture-only hard offer online. Testing really anything prevents anything. Hospitalizations matters. family little ticked made executive decision cancel mid-July Orlando trip May. told March might need cancel didn‚Äôt believe me. Then, numbers beginning ‚Äúlook good‚Äù May, told didn‚Äôt really care, lot data trending towards things rosy seemed. Also, zero trust Florida‚Äôs governor state data. gotta say, feeling pretty damn justified. making health decisions wear mask. Masks worn protect around you. it‚Äôs basing Sweden locking comparison rest region did. numbers stayed basically Denmark lockdown.

In terms pure economy that‚Äôs close apples apples comparison make state economies.

Unemployment go EVERYWHERE this. way sustainable recovery provide safe path normalcy. It‚Äôs guess. That‚Äôs reality pandemic. saw Spanish Flu. 

Anytime try rush back take one step forward two steps backs jobs brought back get taken away again.

Case point: Texas shut bars again. Guess many people unemployed again?

Now also factor travel industry. interstate commerce also internationally. prolong fight virus, devastating impact local travel industry. tourism. conventions. Empty hotels. Airline worker, Restaurants. Etc. We've already seen countries prohibiting travel US basically cutting majority citizens visiting us. 

It's short-sighted view take. nothing truth. Need remind people INDIA said they've beaten virus. Nobody beaten damn thing longshot. even close done. getting started actually. Hospitals going 75% capacity

What normal capacity 2019? 2015? wish kept link someone study hospital ICU capacity 2012-2015 found 15% 100% capacity given time, 30% 90% capacity norm, rest averaged 75-85% capacity *as norm.* *never* surplus ICU capacity. what's going pat answer given students ask, ""Teacher? wear masks?"" Madam‚Äôs Apple Music 1.0 Ohio! It‚Äôs nowhere near bad Texas Florida, seeing spike cases here, too. march 2019 means virus alive kicking year. LA county peaking right Covid cases. look images protests 3 weeks ago, it‚Äôs surprise. people estimated.   Rule law supposed political. first day thrice weekly testing? season finish Money money money mooonnneyyy... moneyyy want I'm scared even lawn gets pretty crowded I'm trying understand r/DisneyWorld last mention coronavirus could find 3 months ago (and regarding ticket refunds due DisneyWorld closure). subreddit cult? Maybe blinkers somewhat retarded, yes, elected moronic president might worst problem world. We're living Book 4 Harry Potter. Minister Magic ignoring Voldemort alive again. Seems like smart plan. /s Unless runs dry universities hurting OK.

It run dry, students (and parents) going want go debt low quality education... least far debt.

So loans available, rather go ""online only"" University price full in-person U, they'll wait see happens. Yea he‚Äôs fortunate enough working hospital fair amount PPE &amp; also done fairly well treatments even early on. People dismissing importance masks ignorant. Unfortunately, someone vulnerable likely pay bullshit. told doubter yesterday heard hospitals hour half us filling up. (Big city)  said ""the test, positives"".  stupidity made head hurt. said, people must really sick hospital. Positive means it. Yeah reading post history. lie.

Or least maybe people likely respond survey also likely wear masks.

And people less likely, don't. arizona hit 35% week ago  50% restaurant capacity starting Monday..? Source? Deaths may stay despite increased hospitalizations. we'll see several weeks. free ICU bed difference make tests useless? People run saying ‚ÄúSee? Look well country doing! predicted 3k deaths day less third!‚Äù

When stop testing get ready big numbers live South Florida everyone seems back normal. Like whole Covid-19 thing never happened. People going about, masks...no worries.

My office opened back back. Fortunately, company least took lot precautions implemented policy procedure minimize risk, sure many not.

I think going get worse since governor Trumpanzee. body, choices., Oh wait.. Weird point finger exclusively kids. Sure, CERTAINLY lot kids also pieces shit, also significant number boomer Gen Xers using Facebook ""sources"" justify never wearing mask. Especially rural areas. gonna reach herd immunity keep closing. /s there's proven treatment ease symptoms reduce risk mortality long-term health problems. Same; I‚Äôve seen every single person inside local grocery store wearing mask. taking thing seriously good job. one particular? sounds like ""90 percent Americans wearing mask say wearing mask public: poll"" way true. given freedoms capitulated fear tyranny./s daily peak new cases **entire country Italy (60,000,000 people)** around **6,000** new daily cases, **two weeks \*after\*** complete total lockdown country (which applied exact way entire territory, one two regions).

Unless full blown military lockdown, work. US intertwined world, even NZ eradicated cases flown in. Thanks, need hear this. Netherlands sure wants you. Even brink depression lots companies look marketeers here. Visiting parents? allowed everywhere place Universal Healthcare even hospitals medical professionals different vs three months ago?

Somehow, Trump. still astounded one individual believes Covid-19 hoax made Trump destroy economy.

Oh why, Florida? great job numbers! üôÑüôÑüôÑ  I‚Äôve also seen comments mention possibility antibody tests included days suit state large changes total number tests- looked doesn‚Äôt seem unrealistic. 

There inconsistencies lot data it‚Äôs becoming difficult truly trust state Florida. fired data scientist created dashboard, I‚Äôve relying more.

Wearing mask best self-interest. individually (lower risk getting sick) collectively, proven slow spread dramatically, would allow life return normal much sooner us rely less disruptive methods like contact tracing contain it.  


Not wearing mask exactly are. I'd like believe trolling, can't possibly stupid, honestly hard tell. florida checking 4x less likely die though compared April treatment gotten better understand. ever leave house without mask again. Surely depends type system? instance central ventilation system local cooling 100% fresh air extract central AHU, wont virus potentially spreading single source throughout building (assuming possible). potential recirculation local fan coil could potentially blow virus across wider area could get similar risk window open gust air pushing virus single source around environment manner?

Kinda hoping friend Savannah postpones wedding. Supposed go end July. I'm getting scared it'll like then.  Easy, tell use excuse harass black people enforce it. always said could‚Äôve snipped ~month~ proper mass testing.

1. create website families go register household put many test need

2. find positive (test everyone house account false negatives) tell stay home 2 weeks

3. retest tested positive every 2 weeks negative

4. deep clean stores public places 

5. encourage people wear mask choose to

of course it‚Äôs late that, need trump start listening know won‚Äôt happen.

oh fail register website either miss stimulus check get fined, even accounting people refuse would still much better understanding virus is. Mexicos current outbreak effecting US Southwest? Drove past BSR cable park week ago, place crowdedddd people.

Florida like theres coronavirus ba sing se overnor Texas pictured graphs background...never thought I'd see that.

A coworker mine Disney theme park fanatic them, multiple times. According PowerPoint presentation, one Japan best (reopening 7/1/20). ""We asked dead patients died, respond, marked death ""Natural Causes"". Yeah I‚Äôm correct black population isn‚Äôt big America (correct I‚Äôm wrong) dump, forgettable. large, important military base. fact, apocalyptic stories, Abilene one first places country attacked. TBH, I'm still shocked Abbott it. deaths trailing indicator

also cases skew younger, fewer deaths least younger carriers spread older relatives arguing hiding numbers Pneumonia deaths way, strange uptick non covid Pneumonia seems. dad hospital since Jan 6th gnarly case MRSA pneumonia. portion lung removed, lung multiple holes it(surgeon said like swiss cheese).

Now Trump wearing mask everybody around tested daily (which seem matter much people before), left social distancing apparently believe masks *substitute* defense protests.

This keep **6 feet** others. cloth face cover **not substitute** social distancing.

Without **both**, fail. Without condemning **ALL** mass gatherings, sends message gatherings actually dangerous.

As expect people take social distancing seriously massive crowds televised universally praised 24/7 weeks end? force people wear clothes public, unconstitutional too?  Oh yes course, sorry Good, let everyone get move fuck lives. Case closed. Fuck state God hope do... I'd really love buy house next two years half currently priced... technically comply governors orders right ? letting cities decide 

That's begin with. decided health conscious banned taking preventive measures. Wait front-end developer Windows 3.1? honestly expected Florida listen? homes would much farther inland avoid flooding hurricanes honestly idea. tried looking official information, announced [via fucking think intentionally vague would want strong focused leadership pandemic? make enough pay fine guess better wear mask. problem age customized information: ""Tell want hear I'll ignore/block everything else."" end weaponized ignorance. 

These people uninformed - **misinformed**,which opinion way dangerous. China stated surface spread matter factly back February mass chemical spraying I'm inclined think took accurate. again, China Korea said lot stuff virus months ago rest world getting around to. Brain damage, blood clotting, airborne, CT scan lungs spots, wear mask etc. trust China numbers shit medical statements Chinese doctors made months ago proved quite accurate far. Pfffft, hot weather kill virus time.
Orrrrrrrr... stay home, save lives protect NHS! Need open bars, arenas full people get normal life.

Right lifers Randi rona chalu good news address concern, lot universities (including mine) opting early August start November end right Thanksgiving break online finals, Fall break try prevent minor outbreaks travel different communities campus. Obviously, there‚Äôs risk bringing back Thanksgiving, comparative going back vs going back forth droves multiple times much better. Also, allows lower income students able access infrastructure campus able succeed much possible school instead screwing whole semester instead chose go online, many schools developing spaces quarantine, testing, contact tracing protocols beyond self-reporting! :) going go trouble create poorly worded fake ‚Äúexemption cards‚Äù wearing mask public won‚Äôt just, put mask on?

This made blood boil read it. garbage human being, would print fake cards claiming fake disability, avoid minutes worth even \*pretending\* care around them. would respect someone wearing ""TR\*MP, F\*CK FEELINGS"" shirt, someone carrying one cards. least first case courage honest they're about. Carry around cards though, worst kind weak-willed, spineless schmuck. I've trying warn Texans months. Like hell listen. Tells scale number victims guess Prepare ‚Äúmuh freedums‚Äù-people yelling like crazy still little soon sure, protests happened country, handful states seeing surges. NYC, instance, record lows despite several consecutive nights big protests.

Outdoor events people wear masks relatively safe. They‚Äôve gotta something ramp testing. I‚Äôve cough week, work noticed wanted get tested, guess what....after calling 9 places countless online checkins earliest could get test spot 6 days. 

6 days... get swabbed 2-4 days results. I‚Äôm major metroplex rampant cases. testing situation seriously lacking. Oh lot positives-just good ones! stories serious astroturfing (mixed bolstered real anti-lockdown voices) probably true. Pretty much every article post online social media saw past month pandemic numbers policy CA flooded anti-lockdown comments demanding open calling people ""doomers"" ""privileged"" saying lockdown necessary continue. incredibly frustrating disheartening.

EDIT: also look people OC behaving. Anti-lockdown protests, town hall meltdowns, threatening life health official resign. Looking Vietnam‚Äôs lack deaths convinced it‚Äôs possible almost everyone die? sounds....stupid, lack better term Oof karens guys rant truck gonna happy Keep mind system people people also get infected. Vietnam‚Äôs success largely attributed prolific testing efficient contact tracing. call science BS doesn‚Äôt change NIOSH requirements unfortunate reality types vented dust masks neither protect wearer microdroplets people around wearer his/her droplets. 

Not sure you‚Äôre bringing ‚Äúfreedoms‚Äù this, I‚Äôm suggesting use *better* mask. Swedens, get program! We're almost fully open within borders (several states effectively zero) they're busy moving small clusters Victoria, New Zealand even impressively got absolute zero almost month dealing handful cases outside possibly impressive all, Vietnam barely gone 350 cases entire time, last 80 nationals returning overseas (so quarantined arrival) deaths. Especially impressive given almost 1000 mile land border China 95 million population too. shitty care people think ""gently"" propose ideas help infect everyone global pandemic. ridiculous need accommodate stupid Karens. science, administration allergic to. mean, technically speaking to. could say people blowing everything proportion economy important, care Texans die result. 

I'm saying smart move, could it. complaints taken health department could change jobs instead you‚Äôre reddit complaining nothing meaningful change situation work place Welp, luckily Abilene forgettable city. Good luck idiot leadership. article really tell us much no-the death rate declining world wide-and ten times number cases true past three months too-you wrong-the CFR gone every expert's opinion  Damn, yesterday Mexico 6,104 *that* record. We're bad, *Florida*-bad I‚Äôm sorry situation. I‚Äôm much better. Yesterday, get prescription everyone eating resturant walking around without masks. entered green phase  happen god rains frogs locust.

I've seen people give original solutions algorithms problems would thought even tackled. yet exceptional intellectual talent put use something is, grand scheme things, mundane. time academia, remember many fellow students talking job prospects looked, much money could expect make, might able buy first house new car. Despite fact people way smarter me, figure talking fundamentally changing world. ""big problem"" want solve die. job really worth doing? guess mention related quote really like tv show Sherlock Mycroft (Sherlock Homes brother happened know): ""My brother brain scientist philosopher, yet elects detective. might deduce heart?"" think particularly poignant paired another quote series: ""Sherlock Holmes great man, think one day‚Äîif we‚Äôre very, lucky‚Äîhe might even good one.""

And watch, two months know jackass making mistake again.... ""More testing=more cases"" makes sense % positive rate stays decreases. states, especially ones currently spiking new cases, % positive rate actually gone up... I‚Äôve read, they‚Äôre already mass producing vaccine. Astra Zenika US sister company Oxford. They‚Äôve licensing rights production time now. plan like 400 mil doses ready US comes out. seems lot confidence vaccine even it‚Äôs band aid get us longer lasting one. Ignore haters, got right.

The hospitalization rate fall they've counted cases.

How fucking bad give easily accept shit result? can't even call us 3rf world fucking 3rd world average handling meaningfully better! Looks like we‚Äôre way hitting worse case scenario. Unbelievable country failed us. least 95% county still coronavirus 

Probably closer 85% based CDC's estimated symptomatic case fatality rate 0.4% asymptomatic case rate 35%.

It's depressing hell. protested never took mics unless talk microphone. feel like hang friends people naturally take masks more. Yup. last night saying radio Abbott issued indefinite pause reopening thought would far would go, wouldn‚Äôt willing go far reverse opening all.

""Dear [recipient], 

I‚Äôm alarmed county‚Äôs rise COVID hospitalizations, especially knowing we‚Äôre beginning see rises percent-positive rate county, 4.5% positive 8.2% positive. COVID spreads exponentially, what's currently stopping us jumping 15% positive, 20% positive, 30% positive coming weeks? Plus, COVID rate climbs, KNOW climbs hospitalizations deaths/long-term disabilities due COVID follow mere WEEKS. Hospitals &amp; ICUS go ‚Äúthere‚Äôs still room‚Äù ‚Äúoverrun COVID‚Äù blink eye COVID epidemics!

NOTHING currently stands us medical infrastructure becoming overrun point people DYING due lack timely care supplies except taking STRONG measures reduce spread virus. 

This why, tax-paying resident, demand fight COVID with: 

QUICKLY RESCIND &amp; END DINING INSIDE RESTAURANTS/BARS/BREWERIES/ETC, INDOOR GYMS, MOVIE THEATERS, &amp; INDOOR MEETINGS/SERVICES EVERY KIND. Eating, drinking, activities typically done properly wearing mask indoors much help spread COVID. Encourage residents call SHAME every single lst business permits people eat/drink/etc. Indoors county‚Äôs percent-positive rate RISING SHARPLY. 



Impose harsh fines labelling onto businesses don‚Äôt enforce PROPER mask-wearing-both NOSE MOUTH covered ENTIRE time indoors outdoor places denser people. suggest $100-$500 first instance $1,000-$5,000 future instance unmasked customers, also $1,000-$5,000 first instance $10,000+ future instance unmasked workers shift. Civilians (non-police) would help taking photos non compliance state mask orders sending city government/etc., would send photos order CLOSE fines PAID FULL offending business. Plus, time first fine issued Camarillo successfully vaccinated COVID-19, business MUST prominently display EVERY citation they‚Äôve EVER received nonenforcement mask order (for employees shift) MAIN ENTRANCE. benefits would threefold: City gets revenue tight times, responsible residents get informed spend money, hopefully Camarillo experiences much less devastation due COVID. Encourage residents help stop unmasked people entering businesses. 

REQUIRE offices EVERY employee working home 2025. 
Go back Stage 1.5 county‚Äôs COVID plan (EVERYTHING closed public except stores, takeout/delivery/curbside shopping, &amp; outdoor exercise facilities) least month order stem COVID‚Äôs spread county. 
Offer sort free Vitamin supplementation EVERY resident order reduce Vitamin deficiency county, causes worse cases COVID-19. 

I want neighbors dying due COVID overrunning us!

It'll indoors around probably 20-30 people. close eyes, ground isn‚Äôt getting closer. believe you, credible citation that? searched u.s. stockpiling ventilators got garbage hits. Thanks. recent ones sucked even fucked situation. I'm sorry hear calling NBA player? football player NFL. American healthcare system must good something ICU reach 100% capacity bad news. ICUs Canada reached low decades.  indicate alarmed. making sure knew ICU actually 100% capacity, 28% capacity. Like indicated. I‚Äôm lucky enough come state didn‚Äôt rush reopening, alarm here. Luckily leadership listens reason science instead president. that‚Äôs fine. obviously much different body type do. proved point. It‚Äôs fine you. there‚Äôs way could get low serious health issues. new cases COVID-19 linked youth basketball tournaments Kansas, another MAYB tournament still tap weekend, expected bring 4,000 players surrounding states, representing 400 teams Wichita. don‚Äôt understand exponential growth. Scottsdale zero. Trump rallies zero Seems see joke. bad one. One quarter one stays alive. demanding head. culture. U.S. probably 10,000 McDonald's workers test positive.

So, take that, Australia! Hmm.

The problem sound like person trusted life death decisions. still bad idea gather non essential activities, even outdoors distancing, meant required essential activities. birthday ‚Äúmilestone‚Äù worthy fling reckless shit for, unless want milestone stupidity don‚Äôt get lucky. gather irrelevant stuff like celebrating arbitrary thing like living another 365 days. masked can't distance

Everyone masked social distancing, again, stuff like essential shopping voluntary gathering. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è People charge things reason all. I‚Äôll never live Texas. 

I considered moving Austin one point, can‚Äôt control idiot oversight. yeah ok bud handled badly done okay recently. I'm concerned they're easing rules bit early, they're fairly carefully. nice see less daily cases longer. *Surprised Pikachu Face* phrased better did. yes, major problem West, particularly US. saying resuming elective surgeries causing ICU surge? No...COVID 19 PATIENTS CAUSING SURGE. understand 30% huge number. 

You throw IFR window. going accurate data years. want go that, live vacuum yes IFR Covid infection better younger people. length stay hospital? complications seeing Covid patients? Blood clots, kidney failure, strokes? certainly never seen complications Flu patients. yes medical experience really saying things like similar Flu. sounds like watch much Fox news. feel bad innocent involvement choice. hope people order loads rice, beans, cereal amazon wait homes state loses 30k people. 

It's ominous road they're on, nobody else scary ride Texas on, absolutely state country. Thanks Clarkson  No,I never got 2 weeks paid leave wife tested Covid19, never got unemployment 2-3 months out, never got financial assistance medical bill got slammed with. 

And trying return work argue 3 hours get job back.

Is clear enough you? want publicly post records? read comment fully would realize I'm still working, go back comment history far enough find previous complaints months ago. Interesting cause populist cities Iran turned situation. mess delivered agree nothing one themselves. People shooting fireworks every night last month Massachusetts New York. Ever since protests started. dogs hating it. definitely going ton 4th July people shooting year. ....only 28% ICU beds filled w/COVID19 patients..... Take look status quo versus universal mask 5'10 120lb, confirm hospital :\^) Uh, one hospital. Texas Medical Center name hospital, entire fleet hospitals. Maybe know talking spouting false information. I'm glad live Canada border closed.

We're going make build wall... Scandinavia also thought lot people would've gotten , studies showed like 1%ish got rest world testing vaccine Africans, like everything else? ""And survive, expect see November."" also released statement saying previous statements cause panic capacity issues. 

They also want governor lift elective surgery ban soon.  No-we planning riots now. cause revolution country, America failed state anyone freaking out, 373 beds meant sustainable use covid patients. call this, ‚Äòsustainable surge capacity‚Äô. reference, 374 currently ICU. that, additional 504 beds meant sustainable use, temporary surges called, ‚Äòunsustainable surge capacity‚Äô. total plan care additional 877 patients ICU within TMC system - that‚Äôs 233% current levels.

Full disclosure, TMC model predicts dip unsustainable surge capacity 12 days, doesn‚Äôt predict far enough say fully exhaust capacity. It‚Äôs definitely reason concerned keep following this, think people may jumping gun saying going lead people dying. certainly it‚Äôs reason go back lockdown, may justify mandating mask use. *winter coming.* least I‚Äôm looking data instead spitting unverifiable conjecture. field hospital Philly max capacity somewhere around 150 patients. max got 6. Why?

- wouldn‚Äôt take anyone oxygen forms respiratory therapy 
-no one 300 lbs
- patients safe discharge location (I.e. homeless)
- could history mental health drug abuse issues

If know covid, know it‚Äôs respiratory virus. Excluding oxygen dependent patients made site worthless BLM protests widespread NYC barely saw blip case count stupid wear masks Yeah man, Savannah business usual part.

I'm 100% sure hindering younger ones ability learn, socialize psychological/mental health level. Unfortunately seems like best thing suffer year hope catch bit later. know also horrible special needs children....I worry lot. consequence spreading death 120k died though, tough...a countries tried reopen schools outbreaks couple weeks later. inflammatory syndrome seen kids worries me. 86,564 employees Delta. Judging quote, least 76,000 administrative. 500 0.6% infection rate. based general population infection‚Äôs rate it‚Äôs likely 5,000+ it. 500 minuscule. Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh logical discussions sub. say DAE FUCK AMERICA??!?!??! UPDOOTS LEFT!!!!! That's many tests entire rest world combined.

Which makes suspicious China lying this. someone explain China could really done many tests every country combined? *Fuck you*

Enforce limited capacity scheduled workouts. Like isn‚Äôt rocket science.

*weeps* far off. go ER June 9th Sciatica pain. 30 minutes. gave two Percocet basically said sucks suck. $2,000. insurance it‚Äôs $560. also trying bill $2,500 MRI didn‚Äôt happen. believe anything China ""reports""  think (hope) reassuring factor we‚Äôve generally wrapped heads around approx orders magnitude slack build anticipate...people mock Cuomo 30K ventilators short stuff overbuild surge beds, man early data ‚Äúline goes faster‚Äù opaque info China Italy precedent analog otherwise slope line would lessen Huh? Thought said 2 weeks ? yet reason, boomer generation bitching ""healthcare all"" ""handouts"" ones collecting medicare shit talk much. Wow talulah Riley way cuter dark hair. think Elon‚Äôs fetish turn independent women trophy wives. Imagine losing life ICU hoax virus... /s hope half instantly heal least, frostpunk style IQ squirrel.

That's f..ked many ways Makes really glad turned job Texas last summer.   article title incorrect. article also doesn‚Äôt say full hours. this? 


 NYC walkable, it‚Äôs easy get moderate amount exercise getting around.

Texas built pickup trucks. link info? Really? I'm Hampton Roads slippin isn't. clarify scale this, TMC doesn‚Äôt refer one hospital. It‚Äôs 2-sq-mile complex several huge hospitals, large academic centers. It‚Äôs literally entire city within city. provides care city well 9 surrounding counties &amp; sometimes get patients even one two level-one trauma centers there. agree. one side believes side tries cheat election going final straw. Frankly, wealth power nation lie south, mention virtually international allies north, Civil War Part 2 end badly new confederacy. wow know that. Thanks explaining me. See CDC guidelines posted. comment posted someone passing patch sand. Passing continuing without stopping. considered prolonged contact (15 minutes per CDC). We‚Äôre talking someone leaning coughing directly face.

Educate CDC guidelines. This. respect. lungs fill goo! Don‚Äôt press luck. He‚Äôs still got time make look like nothing. SB small, liberal, young college town. Go Indy Ft. Wayne. Go Carmel. 

It peaked late April went since then. Indianapolis Hamilton County 100% back normal. July 4th Parades planned, huge baseball soft ball tournaments started last week. Literally thousands kids Westfield. masks. 


I see SB maybe Bloomington close 50% State whole way, way less. rural areas south never even 5% grocery stores.

I BELIEVE restaurant staff still wear masks started slip Memorial Day. 40,000 people protested shoulder-to-shoulder Zilker park.

Next week going wild. process getting new job anyway cannot exoress much pandemic validated choice leave public sector. loved job team within state heart crushing existential dread country giving shit ate me. Seriously! cut family's hair. big deal free how-to videos aplenty. We're trying open back mid August, rising new cases seems unlikely. Besides, actual planning classes look like come back driving people crazy. likely pm going give american businesses access NHS, we're pretty fucked Texas 8 deaths per 100k citizens ranking #43 50 states. New york 161 per 100k citizens ranking #1.  Let's maybe put context bullshit headline. counting 1000+ probable deaths New Jersey added today? Probably deaths occurred awhile ago mean bets off. Might safer poach deer hit grocery store How? draw line? 
To seems divide ‚Äúurban‚Äù ‚Äúrural‚Äù pronounced ‚Äúnorth‚Äù ‚Äúsouth‚Äù. Oh right, asshole said contained.  feelings too. We're self-logging temperatures, again, small portion class caring hard say they're even legitimately. agree validity temperature screenings, I'm sure used liability solution places.

Even people symptomatic, there's guarantee going present fever symptoms would late anyways. thing empty hospital unless operational all. Even pandemic there's always people treated - many hospitals 50% full times.

Well, mostly true right ""pandemic"". They've mostly scrubbed now, literally hundreds videos empty hospitals #filmyourhospital movement couple months ago, empty / emptyish. station empty. People waited 13 hours metro Phoenix. Ken Paxton eat shit Wrong, wrong, lol. primary problem US hospitals finding model. get paid patients. Hospitals many countries paid provide beds whether full empty. Thus, governments wanted clear space simply told hospitals elective services got booted. US way government even TRY prepare (I'm giving benefit doubt leadership many states even tried,) pay empty beds. good way deal disparity systems. honestly, item 43 567 reasons US response failing. I'm pa family thinks unnecessary shut down. Impossible get them. gesus dude, find firefighter cz burning it. party person covid decided would ok came tell anyone. Everyone shitting person going. Oh, gets credit book absolutely botching job. worst day yet come I'm currently 37 weeks pregnant thankfully working home, delay guidance means lot pregnant women forced back office many employers rely CDC tell do. hate think many pregnant women got sick employers lacked common sense. realize areas without community transmission possible areas already virus commit lockdown? population size density. plague work way. border control. quarantine setting harsh borders. stopping flow carriers. OP account one strangest accounts I've seen lately. Honestly can't tell real person warped perspective, troll paid propaganda. Ok, selfish *and* stupid. Idiot. Protests people interested well-being society attended people wearing masks, quarantined, go sick. IE, BLM. Trump goblins protesting masks give shit anyone else spread virus. would put IFR 1.34%, know close to. no, study clearly flawed. fun hiding bunker guess.  still first wave. second wave defined ""recurrence brief absence"" pathogen. Covid-19 yet ""go away"" even day. 

It's country head sand reality now. nowadays people associate kind symptoms labeled 'special' Corona: brrrrrrrrrrrr populous states seeing HUGE swings covid cases June. Almost half daily cases coming top 3 ^^seriously ^^holy ^^shit ^^wtf JB moved heaven earth make happen, certain state governors team decided nothing give Yes! Nevada Utah too. new cases may look like much, populations WAY less California, Texas, etc. Nevada Utah actually amount cases per million California, Texas, Florida at. Arizona hand getting absolutely demolished, rate infection almost 3x California, Texas, etc. Though I‚Äôm agnostic, told wife someone going hell this. mean, fucking come on. bad not? I‚Äôve got one family member, works hospital Galveston, saying hospital work almost capacity. I‚Äôve got another used work medical center saying they‚Äôve talked former coworkers say it‚Äôs overblown. Someone‚Äôs lying somehow, someway punished mess. money‚Äôs ‚Äúgo back work‚Äù folks. buy time retroactive lost coverage. go coverage 2 1/2 months, get massive hospital bill, pay last 2 1/2 months COBRA, COBRA pays hospital bill. makes sense, that's healthcare US you. Obamacare tax penalty going uninsured supposed discourage kind hijinx, Glorious Leader freed us evil taxes. definitely true NYC far tell based accounts friends live there, necessarily hard-hit corners tristate area. Long Island highly affected state back March, would number two cases deaths behind NYS, mask wearing less stellar. Trader Joe's, places, saw around 25% compliance, LOT improper use wearing masks almost proper social distancing. Conversely, live Hudson Valley (I visiting Long Island temporarily), see near 100% compliance indoors close 0 popular tourist areas Minnewaska State Park RtR trail New Paltz. part Hudson Valley fantastic, Long Island. sure make either scenarios. know body. Unless extremely sick there‚Äôs way could weigh 130lbs amount muscle now. realize muscle weighs fat right? Agreed. Front line MD NYC here. Covid bad so, many reasons major one. Someone comes respiratory failure COPD exacerbation bacterial pneumonia intoxication, need vent often get better come fairly quickly treatment. COVID patients vents take sooo long get better (if do). Yeah 12 days becomes unsustainable. don‚Äôt think model trusted anymore. u/IHireWriters say 2.2 million people died though they? It‚Äôs opposite LA. good job mask mandates people working county health department getting death threats anti-maskers. director Orange County public health stepped last week death threats family people sitting outside house weapons. delayed cases long enough mortality reducing drug treatments found. shutdown saved thousands lives delay alone.

We know deaths lagging factor, take 2-4 weeks catch number new hospitalizations. It‚Äôs also clear average age infected lower before. 

Furthermore, US hit record new single day reporting rate rolling seven day average also higher previous 'peak' back early April showing signs slowing down. 

The lockdown literally nothing. still non-Covid wards. actually means can't use 200 remaining beds treat Covid patients.  I'm SB, roughly 50% I've been. Grocery stores, CVS, Walgreens, eg. fuck mistake trying reopen, locking DiBlasio Cuomo lover's quarrel gets close what. lot populated counties full idiots, unfortunately. I'm saying ~~Florida~~ Orange County.

New York benefits populated area somewhat homogenous culture cares city citizens. here... many care themselves. like watching someone jump plane giving update every 10 seconds.

**Next campaign rally speech:**

**That's hoax,** make look bad. 

**Some say even falling,** actually stationary flat earth atmosphere moving towards you. 

**Many good people also say gravity getting much weaker,** weak, ground, gently contact bottoms feet, gently touch rubber soled shoes, nice leather soles like mine, right time, perfectly, like took last step scary, steep, slippery steel ramp.

**There's really nothing worry about,** really, I'm worried all. Falling big deal anyway, I've fallen ass many, many deals involving Russian laundry, cloths, money, came missing. know ton, say that, I'm quite rich, actually wealthy.

**And I'm involved ordering plane shot down.** No, let attorney general take care stuff, he's good man know, actually excellent. 

**A good club whites** reported bomber, big ol bomber **piloted black Muslim ex president,** headed straight nice white house, actually one stay in. 

**They choice** shoot sky, **the likes never seen before.** actually lucky even able jump. addition reasons stated article, people may receiving smaller initial doses virus resulting less severe cases. Fewer people sitting closed space spitting hours end. Washington  totally get that.


I guess clarify. store manager TOLD positive employees tell fellow coworkers positive results returned quarantine. I‚Äôm school nurse. schools opening August 13th. I‚Äôm terrified.  America going win coronavirus. containment. max possible cases deaths. We're way selfish. Covid 19 cases 'everywhere' may 10 times higher reported. Ftfy kinda knew back when.. idk.. spring break happened identified solution. could go back single earner households. Sacrifices made. We‚Äôve stressed single earner family, I‚Äôm homeschool, kids show real benefit parent home young kid.

Just knock cost pretty much everything. call White House response Covid colossal failure? right characterization .... colossal failure? don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs harsh, can‚Äôt seem find better word. see anywhere article many ICYU beds are? Also, seems like people glossed 80-90% number normal. Time panic? Nah. mean, honest. article factually ovjectively debunks many denier talking points. covers ages people spreading virus too. uh oh right along!  charged 75$ dollars potassium vitamin, one pill. could told buy bananas way home.  one single confirmed case reinfection Yeah basically reducing pressure ventilator applies also giving time vent see patient able maintain adequate oxygen saturation (with oxygen support). lot evidence remote school thing working elementary below. 

My opinion based observations far districts hoped students would learn self-led model, like university. expect students transition teacher hounding past due work available ask clarifying questions assignment immediately, almost solely responsible finding, understanding, tracking, completing them, unclear, vague, often hurried instructions. 

Teachers son's 7th grade classes available questions 25 students (or some) 9a 11a. little (or none) one-on-one time. teacher used different method assigning work. Google drive; email; Google Classroom (built technophobe); single Google Doc...

No blame teachers this, think made hard students learn. also think forcing district reinvent distance learning wheel absurd. Yes way tests back then. number tests back would 100k cases day. That's great. endless lawsuits, risk running operations put employees risk. Company leaders see risk look ways survive. One way would lobbying federal govt pass bills put things ice companies, shareholders employees ride financially physically healthy. 

Right ""fuck open up"" path least resistance. incentives adjusted ""angry phone call senator"" effective path. Totally agree, crowding bars, hosting parties, traveling take hike. people also, seems, folks quarantine don‚Äôt want to. Hurry scientists!ü§®ü§ì believe anything ‚Äúreported‚Äù anymore? literally heard Lt Gov Texas say Fox News none ICU‚Äôs capacity despite reported media outlets. ‚Äúreporting‚Äù country really world downright disgusting anymore trying spin agendas - fucking report facts. ER e coli 1 hr... got MRI meds. pay $5000 bill. insurance. Still reached pocket max. weather warms it'll vanish.

about 150f it.

save us Global Warming!  awful Tegra medical thing. say something like that, he? seemed talking point one stage supporters. wonder they'll say closing sale? former Philadelphian moved west 100 miles so... please don‚Äôt leave alone people. that's strategy works! can't notice hairloss notice hair loss *taps bald forehead* Thank you! Say louder people back! don‚Äôt disagree one available. Someone walking isn‚Äôt going pass virus. Stop spreading misinformation. Yep Maga Chud telling people opinions based logic reason üòÇüòÇüòÇ thought trump's fault realized even trump symptom bad education. Education what's lacking country that's causing pandemic spiral control. Man feel bad spork Amazingly nip agreed theory flu seasonal.  watching Coronavirus, appear variety factors
- people spend time outdoors weather warm
- schools session fall - spring
- virus coatings breakdown quicker sunlight - days longer summer
- virus coatings break quicker high heat dry conditions. No, prioritize profits lives

Unfortunately us, that's works. Nothing says ""stay fuck home"" like run hospitals people dying faster cremated/buried.  People go shopping lost lives dead bodies stored refrigerator trucks.

By putting ""economy"" ""lives"", end getting neither.  oof hurts true That's also figured. Must gotten wind governor going stop elective surgeries. guess originally thought would overall shutdown first. unfortunately called Texas got ready open up....there would political public cooperation shut again. everyone news realizing burned card. Nothing see here, go business, second wave. Ha, fuked. Houston faring much better, even younger level (thanks voters defunding local ISD's!). Went HEB staff chilling walkway masks on. Inside looked better though. 100% staff board wearing masks customers required wear well. Dallas Tx Ive two people take business elsewhere mask refusal. I‚Äôm really betting this. maybe even 60k.
Actually would nice idea open betting house see guesses best fucked US next weeks. It‚Äôs completely fucked. assholes took seriously originally ramping could‚Äôve almost now. made political issue we‚Äôre seeing results that. much unnecessary death, it‚Äôs disgusting. Uhg I‚Äôm sorry friend. Way much fuckery happens. Two years ago got car accident. Someone ran red light t-boned me. Totaled car little banged up. coherent refused ambulance knowing price issue. wife drive hospital checking make sure went one network. Turns hospital network, individual doctor saw somehow affiliated company state. biggest pain ass deal thousands thousands dollars network bills. Luckily car insurance companies ended handling end, jeez borderline criminal billing practices. tomorrow. Yeah husband permanently move London September Houston places. seen elderly parents taking seriously *think* live rural area (about 80 miles outside Houston proper) starting spike one time since February. (My family lives state thank God expectation see anytime soon.) 

We skipped Father‚Äôs Day last week (and true) helped babysit cousin‚Äôs kids came town GOLF CAMP 60 KIDS. week one kids ‚Äúacting‚Äù camp. (His cousin‚Äôs wife posted pictures Instagram. mask sight.) said absolutely fucking not....Well, unfortunately husband‚Äôs guilt gotten better begged let invite Saturday. caved verge tears feels guilty get plane may never see again. super hard sad....

But visit getting closer, I‚Äôm getting sick stomach. people think they‚Äôre taking seriously going restaurants even before, getting haircuts, pedicures, etc. it‚Äôs OK apparently places they‚Äôre going ‚Äúdoing right‚Äù, like even know entails. tell husband masks non-negotiable indoors social distancing required times. know mother. faces like two minutes. can‚Äôt help herself. That‚Äôs ordered face shields Amazon making husband wear one along me. Sorry, manners guilt going go far right now. They‚Äôre probably already going far is. lot free beds (877)

lol. back post r/agedlikemilk tomorrow.  shit started figured they're talking beds they're really using metaphor patient slot, including medical care equipment. Turns that's really case can't shove two armchairs together call bed either *no* leadership looks like. think english word Armageddon. knew could it!! First nation, right? mod bot fucking stupid. You‚Äôre talking politics yet post gets removed whoever runs subreddit shit. Government USA never able . imagine quickly lawsuit would fly tried?  neither. least Becky get haircut Same....and hate it. 

To clear, 100% agree it‚Äôs handled I‚Äôm sick working home. It‚Äôs getting insanely boring despite best efforts continue normal, things naturally going slow more. like schedule/routine busy work. nice first I‚Äôm it.....I actually miss going work, something never thought I‚Äôd say. beach really busy, honestly hurt. always one person. never know somebody going walk you.

Also - suggesting mask assuming live bf's family. could carriers, know, could well.  Guess needed /s
Lol both...death massive hospital bills. let local government mandate masks businesses lot complying. think means reason moths attracted lights it‚Äôs better bird hand two bush. Also similar eat spaghetti never count chickens hatch, especially make much sense broken change machine. ...shocker Yet :) It‚Äôs pretty normal icu operate around 75-100% capacity. ICU bed counts currently able handle normal illnesses occur (heart disease, stroke, trauma, post op patients...). massive illness strain, many ICU beds occupied almost time. thousands additional people need them, end clusterfuck.

What Texas governor done help increase availability beds. stopping elective surgical procedures, stopping percentage patients going ICU keeping beds free.

Also, ‚Äúbed availability‚Äù isn‚Äôt biggest issue ICU beds experience. enough able bodied nurses staff unit day day always problem. could ten open beds, heavy certain types medical devices require extra nursing care, serious staffing issues. happened literally every day. call Black Death ""Russian Death"" originated Southwestern Russia. month situation virus progresses expect governments shift message ""lives lost"" ""a tragedy must accept live with"", sense governments know handle financial fallout shelter place measures, they'll reopen economies gradually (this may may include testing &amp; tracing depending from) hope able manage local outbreaks avoid overcrowding Healthcare system. many hospitals Sweden overwhelmed? ü§∑üèº wait show me........ must Fight change! Take country back thieves! people's America! corporate America! way around chief, lot places either cancelling spectators. 'If' surge? it‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerica! Fuck you!‚Äù Houstonian here, AMA! 
 
The city Harris county trying stuff protect people, like today Metro (local public transit) requiring masks worn onboard. blame goes Abbott gutting local authority enforcement wearing mask public. Shops supposed require due legality reasons can't expected much offer free mask upon entry. 
 
A big issue attitude. days ago got email potential covid exposure employee business go (couldn't put repair). mask staff didnt stay indoors long safe, precaution I'm still limiting activity essential only, mask on, visiting friends eyeing symptoms (nothing really rn that's good). think still getting calls friends. Hey wanna hang out, let's go etc tell going beach party shit. *Some people literally got bored lockdowns decided they're done virus, virus getting started.* DISNEYGATE! named ""acetaminophen"" United States almost decade named ""paracetamol"" UK / Europe. Lmao, I've never seen internet warrior something silly Well, Trump surely Mexico favour here‚Ä¶ family member mine today literally said they're lying, linked steven crowder video. little hope Americans.  they'll make go back 

you'll probably end getting sick couple weeks. cross fingers hope permanent organ damage $$$$ ICU bills 

and grandma maybe parents dead  worries. best fresh, anyway. July fireworks cancelled lot places.  I‚Äôm down. don‚Äôt wanna put effort don‚Äôt care get fired I‚Äôll anything else. Humans survived thousands years take care other. love care complete strangers. drag buddy around breaks ankle get safety. individual direct responsibility random stranger. member society responsibility fellow society members. That's pay taxes for. collect little everyone make sure everyone eat home. least that's supposed work. one saying live forever. mindset ""well disabled let die"" terrible leads things like eugenics eventually things like Germany did. got starting ideas eugenics programs US. makes feel better death increase stock prices Houston companies little bit. part Canada, locked early, reached 2.95% peak (thus far) sitting 1.81%... we‚Äôve lot jobs lost think preferable. clinic, rhino rocket removed used endoscope. dont' forget brain damage, spinal fluid damage, liver damage, etc. whole grab bag fun disabilities rest life! Unless company finds someway reset eligibility requirements, like laying couple months starting eligibility clock realize needed hire back. get smell essence 401(k) plan. Guess virus political correct. protest mask ok, football/baseball open stadium also fine (as long kneeling opening national anthem assure virus political correct enough /s)? every company?  Wonder backed found Abbott would stop elective surgeries make money. Reporting Houston lol. For-profit healthcare fundamental conflict human interest needs go. bunch morons, like new pumpkinking. deserve That's argument WAY outta left field Portland, I've personally seen many people wearing masks-- wearing chins noses hanging out-- people wearing masks (properly), BLM protests. 

The politics situation dictate individual stupidity, lack thereof, supporters. people smart enough wear masks, aren't. want people do...be smart... wear masks... make pandemic political. Let actual science rule. Pretending many places trouble now.

What want... people grow hell up. still here. control! still believe numbers reported. Avoid people like plague. Like literal plague. Cause plague. Eight days returns would soonest could get tested minimal false negative rate. That's soonest I'd trust test result. 

It matter whether going not. potential carriers. get virus other.

Before leaves, read family Houston two hour birthday party together 18 got infected, including family member cancer two elderly people.

 money 'buy pieces'? Totally fucked reopenings delayed bullshit. almost China responsible pragmatic government... Ja Rule think?  Why, actually start playing game going disappear, like miracle Canada 1%, probably cases detected testing human beings society culture impact people respond stressful events. Americans historically culturally individualistic shows moments like these. neighbors couple special-ed teachers, one middle school one highschool, two young girls. (One entering 1st grade one entering Pre-K)

I know remote teaching, honestly idea supposed work. I'm curious now. hiding numbers dissolved disinfectant first, sure! patch sand away people (more 6 feet) need mask. NY, CT looking Rhode Island: üëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄ folks flyover country, turns hospital Texas. even one Houston. What‚Äôs saying? Everything‚Äôs always bigger Texas, especially hospitalization rate! Honestly, seems like everyone ""well affect me, cares"" type mindset. normal people, politicians too. crazies like politician Texas said people die economy, wonder US joke right cancel NFL season gonna piss :( Oh please. ffs. everyone's scared called racist. People stupid country swear... Cheaters! Gotta make money ... absolutely take badge honor. sub awful place informed discussion. Nuance respect situation lost instead it‚Äôs hyperbole, politics, fear-porn, politics. It‚Äôs basically /r/politics covid theme. it‚Äôs really good see fearful people country thinking. 

/r/covid19 far better wife getting milkshake *is dangerous* 40,000 people shoulder-to-shoulder protesting shouting Zilker park. Well, I'm glad dad knows rule sticking dick crazy, cause, it. see lot noses, too. Whyyyy?

Because mouth breathers? 

I mean, makes sense.... Drop mic, see there. Well, guess try steal election try postpone it. Due unforseen disaster Corona Virus. could known would get bad? Except entire consensus medical community. care. ran rally world pandemic even attendees sign release libiality got Covid.

To me, motivators pretty transparent, there. DFW person thank much enforcing mask policy &lt;3 3-6 million dead, mention millions survive permanent damage bodies. I‚Äôm loving it. Surprise mother fucker Yep mild flu alright..  people got forlough/layoff lose healthcare insurance, catching covid-19 surefire gonna ruin physically, mentally, Financially long road recovery understand hate doomsday person. think people Houston care now? continue on. ah, god forbid, haircuts gyms shit open, otherwise would meltdown. bunch good looking corpses Eh mortality rate low enough happen.
Sickness, spreading it, maybe hospitalization, long term lung effects etc. Sure. November, November, hurry November Antibody test ton false positives. Picks coronaviruses believe. believe viral swab testing fairly accurate. I'm glad getting finally getting it. 

Your ""otherism"" toxic unproductive. 

There actual people involved here. 

Real, breathing, heart beating people.

They faceless group.

They people.

They people. 

And advocating ""get"" deserve abhorrent. That's issue, masks turned political statement somehow. Trump acts like big old fucking baby  package Swedish fish could done better job. Swedes made decision. wrong, make one, owning now, boot. Parts country fathom adversary bullied, bluffed paid off, ignored it.  Texas think pregnancy risk factor can't get unemployment risk life survive. MacBeth reference kinda fits whole tragedy. Lol good one = death rates spike I‚Äôm boat friend. Also turn 35...our venues even looking good reopen point. least 2 another city work consistently shuttered forever haven‚Äôt made official announcement yet. people aren‚Äôt quite seeing bad yet. hope things work figure something out...in news next year may able buy sweet venues real cheap. right.  They‚Äôre mandated entire state. play test positive player season. Whoever players remaining end season wins. went ER couple weeks ago sat waiting 3 hours. left without seen 2am falling asleep. Canadian here; nah fam we‚Äôre good. Nope, scientifically proven conclusive evidence aliens exist. goes well, office. may well majority leader he's still around What's significant news?
In country hospitals operate 120% usually. times like these, would relish store owner denied maskless people entry. throwing fits would fuel soul Antibiotics cure Right... Health Club Management... fuckers wanna tell going enclosed space (proven spread virus), I'm huffing puffing (which main path transmission), items particulates unsanitary people, areas notorious spreading non-pandemic diseases? work though? single earner get nice house driveway? 1975? hey, it‚Äôs time end lock down. right? gonna pretty. think that, especially place individualistic culture US, area kinda needs bad people overall take action. sucks surprising. quite true, there's places like Hebei, Tianjing provices, spill Beijing.  takes days weeks die. deaths take catch infected numbers. worry guys, ramping fast, everybody catches it, it'll drop like rock. Much like 6% population. best numbers! greatest! It‚Äôs real thing. Look up. flagpole sitting marathons 1920s. bizarre. There‚Äôs also great jam late 90s called flagpole sitta. best thing compare contrast Sweden neighbors quite well hope do. I‚Äôm due back work soon restaurant get decide return lose unemployment return put 6 month old baby risk. even one case spread protest? Wow.  agree you. Major surging happen 2nd/3rd week July. first week first round protests got ugly around country. 2nd-3rd week like suggest, major people rioting/protesting time, people wearing less masks people joining looting police/military involvement.

Sadly, TON people going sick Independence Day spending month July August recover. time leave hospital 2nd Wave, virulent, mutated SARS COV 2 strikes USA Fall.

I'm glad P100 respirator. ""as long jump hit ground i'll okay.""


the worst part jumper decided push us plane too! Cane say ""... tomorrow"" So, assume go everywhere stark raving naked? Since government can't make wear pants? think ""it can't happen here"" thing France (I'm France) anymore, rather, young selfish people feel concerned 90% deaths happen people 65, feel invincible, asymptomatic carrier thing lets believe concerned.

I fear taken seriously see damage done asymptomatic carriers, discreet neurological effects reported, impact asymptomatic carrier's lives.

That's I'm seeing around anyways, people 40 wearing masks social distancing, people 40 act like concerned over, even ones asthma such.

This disease carries beautiful irony way, IMO, brutally selfish ones going maskless respecting social distancing likely discover discreet durable damage limit capacities life, caring careful people less scarred. people interact 1 person (which unrealistically low), infect potentially another 40,000 800 die. cycle continue. 

And (when!) hospitals become overrun even unfortunately. one person test positive entire 3,000+ person study. I'm sure draw conclusion this, except perhaps virus spreading widely community time. forget, also, closed borders.

Why Australia New Zealand relatively well? can't go there, live there, can't go anywhere else. Roll tide Found racist Covid denier troll ^ Exactly, way many stories pregnant women dying. Yes, humans ignorant care one another beings instead statistics. Choosing IFR COVID like shooting darts. virus seniors home could see 10-30% fatality rate. virus school could see 0% fatality rate. 


With mind, consider factors coincided concentrate infections within vulnerable populations. Therefore terribly surprised theoretical IFR observed IFRs differ significantly. NYC locking also sending discharged elderly patients care homes measure could planned better increase fatalities. 


Making even difficult select COVID IFR constant. function infection rate. see places worse outbreaks see crude higher deaths, also higher fatality rates! apparently difficult disease treat even moderate outbreaks - failure non-catastrophe triage - notable effects expected outcomes. Imagine killing people unhealthy need taken ICU breathe flu. Shes employee- I'm friends friends mom saw lady actually works special needs. what! dad got invited romantic beach trip lady suddenly weekend free restaurant worked suddenly closed....because many staff tested positive. asked, take tested negative? replied, oh get results back Tuesday. talk anymore. closer 3 weeks I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll fine.

This college school reopening strategies crazy. seem built assumption kids students socially distancing...but parks fields around packed them. America easy beat days.

Everything beats America now.  need see outside field view. cannot print dollars like US doing, could would situation. countries weee already difficult times. 

Try cashflow access printing machine access cheap loan international loan market. 

I give simple example.
And please pardon bad english.

In philippines cashflow buy tons masks equipment. didnt it, first lockdown. quickly realized people literally dying starvation. why: 

I fishermen village plenty fishes anyone, tons it. cannot stock freezer freezing warehouse. cannot transport lockdown. Actually even keep ice find ice keep fishes hours difficult. 

Because lockdown, cannot fix freezer. cannot someone fix electricity line (broke tree stormy weather) cannot pieces needed repair anything would broke. cannot maintenance.

There many places Philippines fishing. need import food. food transported kept condition starving.

Now stopped lockdown cannot ask world bank infinite loan money. ratings international market. 

Now found filipinos courageous using masks social distancing + need write whereabouts infos doorstep trace you. try stop catch-22 thing.

Sure, Philippines, especially Manila especially go r/philippines, Manila weathly people tell ""STAY HOME FOULS"" remote teaching, work home etc service. garbage workers peasant needs count pennies live.

I saw fishermen literally gave fishes away throwing sea. Like beach swimming realize full dead fish everywhere. meanwhile people dying starvation place Philippines.

I'm expert question trying give point view.

And China jan/feb also first hand experience dealed there. China wildly different US EU Philippines usually like stay indoor lot delivery services everything. could accept extreme quarantine still enjoy food even order anything like chinese amazon receive gadget 24h usual. 

In Europe nothing like couldnt really extreme lockdown either.

Sorry bad formatting I'm phone.

Really Prey developping countries ready it. patients even get assigned 2 critical care nurses manage one patient, fun times Well case they're pro-choice...which pro-life....hmmm cause ""unwarrented alarm"" thing nothing worry Oh, okay. course go sleep. someone comment Houston one ""we'll fine,"" no-mask cities prior this? so, likely means cities known (in FL, MI, MN, south) follow suit, right? Yep, one cares live. go often, stuff like make run grocery store, I'm lucky see 5 people wearing masks. infuriating level can't even explain. Wearing mask requires literally effort all. None. people it, ""fuck you, can't tell do"". Growing up, we're taught proud Americans. I've fence anyways, seeing majority response Covid? proud American, ashamed. could move another country stipulation ""giving up"" America never able come back, would without moment's hesitation. let's come back years see amazing able afford ACA goes away  sure somewhere missing it...but time briefing? say would go away April? Doncha long good ‚Äòole days 60,000 dead ‚Äúleaders‚Äù knew would soon everything could finally get back normal time elections? Dont know covid means problems suddenly dissapeared rendered insignificant? allowed pissed quarantines, lockdowns results boo fucking covid hoo?

Just ask sub... Wish could say Ohio. count asymptomatic cases confirmed ones ( manage separately. ) Toilets scrub themselves, right! Thanks, fixed Working 65+ isn‚Äôt something new good part population  Bright side covid: finally starting learn governors' names.  think mean long term immunity. Coronaviruses actually notorious short term immunity. second wave people first possibly reinfected. vaccine put enmasse could effectively halt spread destroy virus. Ummm...they aren‚Äôt skyrocketing illinois. BF ICU nurse, one day working ENT even admitted best help, way outside comfort zone. here. going overlook quality issues reported SOME...but Tesla ""another company"", I'm going think long hard next car (it going Tesla). we‚Äôre getting band back together! virus spread much outdoors people wearing masks indoors (with ventilation circulating virus) people wearing masks Nothing see folks, 40,000 asymptomatic young people cases. Read article fucking moron.   gets worse?! Well know worst case scenario. still reports people getting 6 months. difference detectable antibodies able produce again. people start getting infected second time know long lasts. yuck..i tell said really one wants procreate you. Sick excuse though, psycho.  Bigger protests NYC, DC, Seattle, Atlanta, etc issues. Interesting spikes happening Texas Florida, ones reopened jam packed bars indoor venues ü§î nah. Must protests BLM B G B Duuuuuval. Question anyone knows answer: difficult/feasible would send patients less affected cities? option clerks, janitors, workers mall need feed families. Poorer countries incredibly difficult choices make. ‚Äúpeople people be
you get along awfully?‚Äù

- wise man music band 80s....... Keep mind NYC got European mutation strain, China began clusterfuck orginal Asian strain, studies say less contagious. Wuhan crushed suspected super spreader event, city-wide families invited pot luck (I hope moron thought good idea got fired).


And unchecked growth focused one mega city region. Everywhere else moderate numbers still started shut down, mandatory masks, testing, contact tracing. America's challenge everywhere, high numbers.  Lol pretending protests also big part. Thanks seems line state putting out. conservative protests tho? I‚Äôll longer cheaper.

This idea would die summer based erroneous belief people catch colds flus summer; much do. harder transmit summer. 

Coronavirus easy transmit, even easier transmit enclosed environments Americans experience Winter. bad now, get worse. Maybe go look press release TMC put out. money hospitals badly need it. Wonder FL news anymore two days ago ""skyrocketing ICU patients?"" ya apparently intelligent doctor. Cool

Edit: Thank y'all downvotes. gives clearer understanding doom bias sub is. Chomping bit get worse instead better. absolutely gross alarming. obviously gay friend mine donated last week. Sweet, hope gonna hug kiss party!  understand controversy around wearing masks, there's plenty supply everyone. relatively minor inconvenience wear one situations (i.e. asked sleep shower one, close contact social situations). harmless courtesy worst, effective mitigation strategy best.  Even though literally insurance works. Fucking idiots. I'd like see #RecordYourHospital morons check TMC. I‚Äôm making changes, would great time.

Petition tell politicians surge capacity act appropriate instead desperate? very. PA hanging thread would call mixed drink? Honest Question: worried going anywhere Fall? number cases seems bad lockdown. 

Also, thing really matters hospitals, icu, death rate. shouldn‚Äôt panicking positive cases. Protect elderly nursing homes Party house! least that‚Äôs better value guy got couple tablets. got experienced specialist using extremely expensive equipment. question whether scope necessary not. reported Baker's press conference couple days ago. offered free testing encourage protesters get tested. 17,000 went pop sites. saw actual number somewhere, probably Boston Globe, really good paywalled.

This article rough number 2.5% positive math involved.

It's local news, too.

Overall, cases across board. Texas saw near 90% increase 2 weeks 2400 ish 4739, California worst hotspot. 

I think thats Arizona tbh ever test iq? mother‚Äôs? 1000 person polls aren‚Äôt representative populations millions. IQ tests also suck. Look far aspergers friend god tier IQ coupled social ineptitude leaves basically disabled.

Edited I‚Äôm low IQ. ;) asking people tested positive attended protests? absolute shithole America turning into, didn‚Äôt fix gave up, fun every single American, quarantined anytime wanna go vacation leave country reason, so, probably never.

A filthy fucking dump don‚Äôt even wanna touch cuz might sick Yeah, limbs start going numb it‚Äôs concerning. Glad sciatica was. Hope getting better. Remember, people HK racists. /s Surge capacity burns nurses pretty quick. need beds need ventilators, finite. nurses nursing hours. Especially nurses get sick due inadequate PPE, even regular old exhaustion PTSD super dangerous #WOO HOO! agree, ignorant selfish people proven loudest eventually drowned pain felt across board.

Especially considering COVID patients become sickest patients hospital. proned vented. top people ventilators extended amount time high rate infections complications. COVIDs cytokine storm.

Cancer... heart disease etc... things kill caught neighbor...friend...or loved one...and 10 days later fighting life. equivalent getting shot. gunshot wounds deadly. I'd prefer get shot however. Idk abbott (governor?), failure doesnt rest one person. 

It's systemic failure top bottom: regular citizens never took seriously, laugh ridicule mask wearers, spew bullshit ""my freedoms liberties""; store owners creating enforcing social distancing mask; mayors local citily councils; state level governments getting EI, small business aid, calling bullshit; god damn president himself. always concern pandemic reaching developing nations. Decades progress alleviating people poverty drain. sad. Boston good. I'm saying part...not great. Spent two months healing 3rd degree burns hospital Germany. Paid 10‚Ç¨ watch tv per week. live Netherlands... Mandate masks. 

Easy ask one line possible repercussions angry customers. husband corrected old Home Depot. It‚Äôs north tho near restaurant depo! definitely did. Also creative counting well. least general idea real numbers are, one's given containment yet.


Meanwhile States like can't cases count them, we've tried nothing ideas.



It dangerous government something close real numbers, political react appropriately. lot big offices Bay still closed, everything else open, there's 1% mask wearing rate one social distances. I'm honestly floored - figured I'd grown lived particularly sensible, progressive part world, no, Karentopia. due respect coronavirus going around? EXACTLY would say anyone spent 'quality time' families loved ones without sane proper precautions necessary. One main problems media, privately owned, interested money. Could kept covering virus reminding people, nope- magically disappeared. point data shows put covering mouth limits spread. Everyone protects wearing mask. way asymptomatic people spreading unknowingly...

It works. reason much conflicting information terrible f****** leaders top bottom. literally simple cloth mouth going keep infecting people people wear keep infecting you.

I'm sorry conflicting information bothers end kind resolute singular guidance this. certainly can't blamed that. There's lot f****** confusion there. thing confusing communities scoff masks wear new hot spots. Time upgrade capacity level 2 find information? Exactly. zero intention going anywhere need to. 

I've home since January. eliminated virtually non-necessary purchases. commuting, shopping, eating out, spending money. I'm also happier. flexibility. exercising more. teaching skills never time for. great me.

And need go back stuff. lot us don't. wait safe, adapt system needs (and forever). 

Half-jokingly, like Neo opened people's eyes Matrix.

You yell people re-open, going sit outside house yell go shop? studies find kids poor vectors. high school 4K kids. can‚Äôt imagine absolutely packed halls classes. wrong schedule couldn‚Äôt even get classes across school time. 

I can‚Äôt imagine going place pandemic. entire freakin place would infected. Like it‚Äôd like 80% students would positive months. thinking gives anxiety. 

Man feel families right now. case, watch news every countries america. Maybe they‚Äôre loading bodies refrigerator trucks like happened New York people wear damn mask Fairly tame Reddit standards. Usually titles tell feel like ""It's Scary...."". evidence far seems suggest children transmit SARS-CoV-2 even lower rates contract it. believe helps first place.

 media said buy masks opposite. 

A symptomatic people could spread can't. 

It transmits air not. 

You could get can't.

I care people. believe helps. give 0 fucks playing mind games ""on right side history"" want truth bullshit im smart enough know im fed bullshit. Stuck PA now, went get stuck indoors months. Stopped get canned coffee Turkey hill. I'd say 20% wearing masks?

Meanwhile I'm walking around one N95 respirators lmao. one question dentist... sounds scary... get can‚Äôt put forever though southern california start country please? ""Just think buying opportunities.""

\- .1%  Ted Cruz climate change denier... wouldn‚Äôt faith push Abbot enforce anything would actually help. Harris county‚Äôs judge actually try make masks mandatory &amp; Abbot overrode (&amp; others tried), saying local government can‚Äôt make regulations strict state regulations. since state regulations nearly non-existent completely unenforced...ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Australian winter flu levels evidence it. June clearly flu-season, despite 13 positives 10,000 tests. Personally quietly assume they've never endured actual hardship life. ""forced"" wear mask counts oppression you? Seriously?

Then immediately forget hell cowards actually gonna anyway made ventilator lungs real bad shape. finding even noticable outward symptoms, may still end lung damage, know physically active enough need full lung capacity. 

What really going kick pants damage permanent scar tissue. Well might like it, think great too. need consider intensity duration:

Restaurants/bars common pose medium risk.

Protests uncommon pose medium risk.

Parks common pose low risk.

If millions people protested every afternoon, could swayed. thousands couple weekends nothing compared close contact workers small spaces. funny bc texas, older POC wear time- young white kids main offender. (That big percentage) try argue stupid, they'll pull level beat experties stupidity. downvoted like remember seeing downvotes people pushing back ""masks dont work"" bullshit February/March definitely need mask bc can't physically distance ""They test blood plasma use it...there literally reason turn usable donations middle pandemic."" Fake News!

The President America said anyone wanted test would able get one. think little believing not. outdoor friend‚Äôs dad died complications coronavirus week ago today. diagnosed January dealt effects secondary infections ever since. basically fever January June body gave up. Haha Ha, I'd love put something angry full fury make RATM look like soft rock. Pretty much anywhere outside Snohomish King Pierce county maybe others  I‚Äôm confused California‚Äôs infection rise. well early on. didn‚Äôt think re-opened fast either. LA opened bars back last weekend, relatively late compared states areas. Cali infection trend never really decrease trend, wondering transmission hot spots are. presume everyone working home living previous normal life. Let buy toilet paper seem outta order take grain salt since March, so... problem Bay Area beautiful amazing weather (in many parts least). Vegas desert. Gonna tougher attract talent. Otherwise totally agree you. well that‚Äôs fucked They're lying say something good. gloomy bad news honest, good people. dismaying number Americans deal food insecurity apparently number doubled since pandemic put ramp there, stall awhile. EXACTLY. Lung damage flu play well together. abuses happen everywhere. sad reality. said need transparency fullest extent. mean like never turning camera duty like police officers such.. 

Having said that, world hunger much problem ignore. businesses realize there's spike season ruined. saw another really insane conspiracy today fb: person, denied virus even existed telling people get tested because....

""They using swabs PUT VIRUS PEOPLE.""

I've even heard people say tests used insert chip people's noses. 

Like whaaaaa???

Holy shit...üò≥üò≥üò≥ even know address this. one person outright saying it, there's likely many many people saying think this.

How people get point? someone said want get tested looks scary sticking swab far nose looks like would hurt. see people scared results might be. least sort rational reasons relating something real. believing random unknown entity trying plant chips virus swab auspices test pandemic that's overwhelming hospitals??? words...... sciatica. 

I wish kind pain anyone. Well, almost anyone. Indeed, corona virus already gone south. look Texas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, North Carolina. (Look, pun.)

California least mandating masks, California's future looking brighter many southern states fact alone. 

However, mask mandate likely late save California hospitals going capacity considering New York lockdown horrible hospital surge weeks later. shit!?!?!?!? mean that‚Äôs article said, it‚Äôs completely normal run upper 80s 90s talking ICU capacity. Hospital CEO: ‚ÄúWe always room capacity. put patients hallways!‚Äù covid patients. hasn‚Äôt point haven‚Äôt. it‚Äôs life threatening, it‚Äôs elective. they‚Äôve opened children‚Äôs hospitals make room adult covid patients. late meaningful action. NOTHING contain virus. re-open border. think encouraging. imagine protests contribute spike coming weeks. Yes will. forget everything. bush admin walked away clean pretty atrocious shit image pretty strongly rehabilitated public. dont see changing admin.  get nationwide? effectively blow American economy content exploiting average workers replacing like fodder?

My employer give shit, wanting entire workforce come back stuffy, communal office less bare minimum ""protections"" place think we're slacking home care ""bad apples"" dining attending protests. even want pay barriers. work computers day long apparently meant work remotely. 

The level gross negligence many companies displaying absolutely disgusting. moved Texas, Austin fact. regrets now. It‚Äôs called teaching critical thinking skills. much think, thankfully. display operator commercial fireworks, usually company 30 shows week independence day. year company two shows contracted, private, backyard shows. reference, based Kansas largest show billed $1m shows municipalities. Thankfully, places enough sense cancel year. Lol tobacco store ""skip it"" list. Like people going decide skip it. 

I finally quit smoking months ago I'm actually loving quit helps anyone avoid Rona, 7/11 app delivers cigarettes. governor Abbott anything mitigate cases two weeks still going up? There‚Äôs one thing given little hope this. two recent decisions joining liberal minority, Chief Justice John Roberts starting look like won‚Äôt part Trump coup loses. Reddit gets made young people fun US. packed, maskless bars, cafes, clubs Paris, Brussels, Vienna ignored. He's also idiot. pay attention, says pants head stupid things lot.

As random example, set tent line investment call (I want say Q3 2018, quote honestly can't remember) bragged efficient tent 2 degree incline gravity would help car move along line. either he's liar he's someone physics degree know find force gravity block ramp. ever walked hill vs slightly inclined ramp. That's random example, find lot type stuff look. might stress. Idk trigger you, definitely me. COVID...and like, everything....there's plenty stressed about. He's preparing set-up. Seeing numbers go down, needs game plan loses. suggests voter fraud bam loses ""I told so"" voter fraud. Fuck work now. money, like literally to. read patterns 1918 pandemic. Let‚Äôs hope went social media tried tell
People story, hoping it‚Äôll help others. sure though. must missed graphs.

NYC 251% excess deaths (more triple).

Madrid 157%.

New Jersey 113% (more double).

London 99%. N95 N99 protect wear properly correct masks general mainly stop droplets spreading. Well, sitting crapload nukes reasonable deterrence anyone declare war. Unfortunately, capacity destroy everything necessarily great. COVID, neighborhood planning first ever Independence Day block party. it‚Äôs changed Thank God It‚Äôs party, set vague date future whenever actually over...whenever family Texas absolutely chosen this. going minds anxiety trying cope.

Fuck accusing whining trapped shitty political system. Fuck even implying okay risk decisions others. I‚Äôve vehemently opposed saying protests worth COVID spread record declaring outbreaks would occur them. said- look cases blowing aren‚Äôt, really don‚Äôt know pin current waves protests. surges line much better areas reopened early general public ignores health measures. 

If protests causing mass community spread would expect see major surges Philadelphia, DC, Seattle, Portland, Minneapolis. haven‚Äôt seen these- yet. Big emphasis yet, seems outbreak lag longer people expect. 2 weeks- like 4-6. 

See HIV considered curable - definitely survivable nowadays. antiretrovirals suppress viral load much greatly reduced chance transmitting HIV on, essentially live normal lifespan good quality life. Yup. Selfishness source pride. Warned literally 4 months ago. lot people listen reason political reasons. *laughs Manhattan sidewalk* it, precisely, ""probable"" coronavirus deaths understand, like?

If impossible tell certainty whether given person actually died SARS-CoV2, listed covid19 death 80% sure death virus? 60% sure? 50%? 

If 80% sure particular case, though certain, therefore list person true coronavirus death, would type dishonesty public reporting, would not?

It seems like people certain political agendas conception probabilities idea inevitably need room nuance kinds complicated determinations. want numbers low possible, whether giving accurate picture not. Yeah pretty much. saw video palm beach town hall handful people protesting assume board debating mandatory mask law

One woman speaking compared forced wear mask Jews Germany forced wear Star David

I‚Äôm fucking done. awful person (she looked much like Karen too)  Crazy mother patient enough wait test results doctors advice. Decided self-medicate kids. fight lol lost. atleast harmful. Still think bad idea self medicate mother. He'll probably try still pin blame Jenkins. uncle initially refused social distancing like yesterday got testing. Still waiting results yeah it‚Äôs mixture people wearing wearing masks. wear lot older folks aren‚Äôt wearing conspiracy theories thank god grandma‚Äôs taking shit seriously. no- Trump received intelligence fucking *november* sat fat ass. Shit healthcare. brain dead cousin angry money goes public schools since kid goes private school. called says good person donates awhile works catholic charity. also complained getting 1200 free dollars husband since bank 150000 year. people lost touch reality reasoned directly affect either worthy exist. Uh-oh.

Seems like counties opened sooner others. \*cough\*\* riverside\*\*cough\* Doubt thats case giant crowd. People deluded thinking protests effect spike. Yeah mom runs business employees, screwed. opened now, worry lockdowns coming back California she'll make ends meet. May help get SNAP processing time short even outside pandemic... suspect Governor's last term. people tell protests, people standing shoulder shoulder en masse spread infection ones telling I'm selfish participating outdoor activities going beach. 

I always wear mask public, get people say safe go BLM protest, yet selfish go beach park. people never going believe serious happened people knew personally.  forced reopening happen.

‚ÄúThey‚Äù didn‚Äôt anything.

/s Man also drive obesity epidemic protests happening almost month. living rock? another motivation have, possibly racial one? No. people really die included totals. bad headline. would disaster, public official floats, and/or supports idea resign. Ok places like India Peru Mexico can‚Äôt shut months either. Rich countries maybe spoiled rich countries may want prefer go third world model ‚Äòlet virus fuck it‚Äôs done‚Äô (not sure would choice oh well) went turkey hill day two people working wearing masks. four people store weren‚Äôt.

Good luck stay safe. likely lot that. best guess right COVID kills .5-1 percent people get it. 18,000 people died nyc. 1 percent figure holds, means ~1.8 million it. .5, 3.6 million New Yorkers it.

Bear mind also super rough account relatively large number nursing home deaths NYC, example. suggests lot ~200k confirmed diagnoses gotten it. wore masks goes long way. Okay, fine. you‚Äôre 25%, still less halfway there. Yes! really hoping positive social changes this. I'm trying stay hopeful. know people feel same. I'm happy you, take care Honestly shit headline gotten, study pretty comprehensive lots applicable data colleges use determine plan fall winter break.
We KNEW true, useful study understand metrics it. hospitals town look empty ambulances roads. post sounds fishy. heard others say hospitals empty also. know nurses work. hospitals full working nurses laid off. YouTube really devil‚Äôs rabbit hole. Idiotic content aside, nonsense poorly produced don‚Äôt know catches on. I‚Äôm starting open idea basically brainwashing ‚Äúneurolinguistic programming‚Äù risk sounding like Alex Jones Oh look ground, maybe friend.  That's point. Kentucky pretty well, things considered. governor taken seriously beginning.

As individuals within state, don‚Äôt go much seems people wearing masks. wait second spike. see similar numbers country. local cases means hasn‚Äôt spreading person person within Taiwan. sporadic cases citizens coming back abroad (aka imported cases) identified quarantined opportunity spread locally. right. increase due 1800 ""probable deaths"" data dump new No, you‚Äôre one thinking critically. Data clearly shows relationship protests corona. You‚Äôre arguing bad faith Ok, virus problem remember dream live USA kid... dream anymore... Hold classes outside cold FDT
 - YG  dumbshit parents? make good point. politics. media politicians want protest, therefore say safe. give MAJOR side eye ‚Äúhalf-masked‚Äù üòÅ god. It‚Äôs freaking early say this. see spike protests, looking 2nd 3rd week July... needs spread level 2 3 cause spike happen. Hopefully not. 

But putting garbage provides false sense security many people. Ignorance number one killer world. Coranavirus another slice ignorance pie. figure highly suspect. There‚Äôs nooooo fucking way 40 percent covid patients develop ARDS. must‚Äôve seriously mixed statistics, would translate like million plus deaths easily already. point develop ARDS, you‚Äôre deaths door, ICU, sedated ventilator intubated. huge proportion people point guaranteed die. Maybe meant 40 percent covid patients lung findings imaging suggestive risk ARDS. That‚Äôs stat I‚Äôve seen makes sense.

The figure presented means almost half get covid going vent half going die, meaning covid would 20 25% death rate. obviously false! Also Cincinnati airport CVG, located Covington KY.  Honestly could test protesters might even symptoms yet. Cases always there... Testing ramping figures correct.

Antibody testing shows 25% people New York City virus. case everywhere, number actual infections far larger number confirmed infections. would actual proof. I've worried 5 year old going back school.. time I've extremely frustrated mother taking home schooling seriously letting wants.. hes getting ready head kindergarten cant visually identify certain letters still. Seems progress make time lost goes back her. think could least tried economy save lives, whole mask shortage travesty first, wearing one becoming political issue, kind prevented need accomplish that. everyone masked everywhere went, ample room space out, really nervous go anywhere. People would still get infected significantly slower rate. never needed stay home, safer home thing bullshit. needed wear masks, still do. problem, you‚Äôre best country best facilities free healthcare, right? Nebraska planning starting schools early. boss school board apparently talking today expressing great thanks case. 22 arrested city. city, even state. Get outta here. sound panic alarm deaths yet?

THEN WHEN? Well really handle false positive rate serology tests yet. Fundamentally - numbers actually Spain 1% overall 5-10% Madrid, 4% overall 9-13% Madrid? 

It's almost impossible know. see, feels gap chakra yearns fill it. Let‚Äôs remember idea prevalence is. much bias self selection, testing blitz says, course testing we‚Äôre among hospitals, prisons, first responders, general people willing wait five six hours line test Arizona summer.

We absolutely prevalence tracking done testing random volunteers control bias.

Actual prevalent studies would demonstrate beyond doubt horrible job we‚Äôre doing; simply getting lots bias test always use defense test worse it‚Äôs going look.

 good news prevalence may lower appears, although even 5% 10% would still alarmingly high. bad news lower prevalence, longer it‚Äôs going take work way population. really 20% prevalence right now, would expect see ~~a quarter million half million deaths~~ 25,000 50,000 (sorry I‚Äôm moron) state next 3 4 weeks. don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs going happen, think going far deaths people prepared for.

BACKGROUND
There considerable variation disease behavior among patients infected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), virus causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Genomewide association analysis may allow identification potential genetic factors involved development Covid-19.
METHODS
We conducted genomewide association study involving 1980 patients Covid-19 severe disease (defined respiratory failure) seven hospitals Italian Spanish epicenters SARS-CoV-2 pandemic Europe. quality control exclusion population outliers, 835 patients 1255 control participants Italy 775 patients 950 control participants Spain included final analysis. total, analyzed 8,582,968 single-nucleotide polymorphisms conducted meta-analysis two case‚Äìcontrol panels.
RESULTS
We detected cross-replicating associations rs11385942 locus 3p21.31 rs657152 locus 9q34.2, significant genomewide level (P&lt;5√ó10‚àí8) meta-analysis two case‚Äìcontrol panels (odds ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48 2.11; P=1.15√ó10‚àí10; odds ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.20 1.47; P=4.95√ó10‚àí8, respectively). locus 3p21.31, association signal spanned genes SLC6A20, LZTFL1, CCR9, FYCO1, CXCR6 XCR1. association signal locus 9q34.2 coincided ABO blood group locus; cohort, blood-group‚Äìspecific analysis showed higher risk blood group blood groups (odds ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.20 1.75; P=1.48√ó10‚àí4) protective effect blood group compared blood groups (odds ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53 0.79; P=1.06√ó10‚àí5).
CONCLUSIONS
We identified 3p21.31 gene cluster genetic susceptibility locus patients Covid-19 respiratory failure confirmed potential involvement ABO blood-group system. (Funded Stein Erik Hagen others.) July state finally rolling RealID need domestic flights near future. Coronavirus delayed requirement get new license long enough get RealID instead either also needing passport needing go back RealID flying Christmas.

Know what? gonna fly Christmas. feeling need RealID get flights quite time. Funny thing is, marginal percent people never get coronavirus. Texas, way things going pretty much everyone sick end year. Currently enough savings make year spring, hopefully vaccine shield recovered people would also work theory stupid you? We‚Äôve tried nothing we‚Äôre ideas! parents must proud. Florida hitting 4,000 new cases day. think would take almost 10 years reach heard immunity 70% Florida‚Äôs 20 million population. Time hear religious leaders theyve spoken ad naseum know long term effects virus survive it? Canadian, sure understand 401K based comment, please elaborate? This. thinking weeks. Facebook toxic. need enlightened era Back March predicted (because structure USA health system) millions would die.

I shouted &amp; told could possibly happen. really hope - especially look countries &amp; see deaths preventable.

So far, deaths per million population . . . 

Australia 4  Hong Kong 0.9  New Zealand 4  Malaysia 4  Japan 8  Iceland 29

 know. see number want say nice, case, anyone say nice. This. thinking today. Many years ago, wondered Internet would catalyst downfall society. Looks like it‚Äôs shaping unfortunately. üé∂God Bless U Aüé∂ report 18,000. old? Hundreds thousands* going bumpy ride There's conspiracy China claims west trying infect China food drag China them‚Ä¶

Australia helping, especially China already sees Australia one racist nation earth. Dark Winter Scenario, ~~am accepting it~~ like it! I'll trade one ISAC watches. Nah anything fully expect things get worse Great response, thank Actually true SD. president could give 2 shits people dying. Fuck Donald Trump. hope there‚Äôs special place hell him. Well go back original comment even emphasis. 

Yeah. never said gonna happen. said decide ‚Äúidealistic‚Äù view ( reality it‚Äôs smart choice ) decide want die lol. get ones love sick die. That‚Äôs said it. opinion work. always die first due innate stupidity sold insurance mostly dealt life health, hopefully helps. insurer large group ACA policy holders. Right now, people lowering costs spreading insurer's risk. people priced removal ACA policies, insurer recoup costs increasing policy costs overall, dropping high-risk insured (this legal pre-ACA), mix. immediate, likely fallout could see premiums increase $1k $750 depending number variables. I‚Äôm even surprised. protests definitely huge spot virus. Oh yeah, pretty sure sports starting disaster waiting happen. Heck, probably see entire pit crews getting infected NASCAR coming weeks. Reuters show bias reporting certain subjects. ""Dr."" Campbell *nurse* looks sites like World Data thinks explain country based that. Information based education seems ok, everything else probably disregarded. 

Jon Tallinger pretty much conspiracy theorist, audience online mostly fellow conspiracy theorists disinformation news websites. much criticise Swedens approach, malice? Come on. One enemy see, one cannot. Someone test it! LMAO! 

watch find TB, MS, Lupus virus/bacteria dormant/active nervous system deep herpes (which burrows heart muscle) month Distract maybe forget hit ground. someone say American Carnage?   understand hate doomsday person. unpleasant graphs. 

Also, still low numbers, Oklahoma's curve pretty terrible.  Medicare happens hospitals longer for-profit, overcharging stops.

Aspirin cost $900. go pharmacy right buy 20 pill pack equivalent little $6. hospital surely get cheaper since buy bulk, pharmacy puts price tag profitable. guys pay $900 Aspirin system unbelievably broken. costs much. Right. Like leaded gas/crime theory. Which, think anyone could predicted even tenuous link existing. Trump lied naturally breathed know new University student, looking forward in-person classes.

But fuck don‚Äôt want corona wanna save lives hopefully go fully online till least get vaccine. high positive test rate suggests India soon, even official reported numbers show it. India tested more, would probably find even cases. I‚Äôve seen fair amount concern, concerning thoughts it. hope adaptation, new teaching methods implemented help limit negative impact. 

Unfortunately, elementary schools(all schools) basically guaranteed way inject coronavirus every household point. don‚Äôt think got far anime! I‚Äôm sorry! saw lady news compared wearing mask Jewish population wearing Star David.....as currently bad Holocaust ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Fucking Karens Chads protesting guns open up. Thanks lot. That's literally elementary schools set houston, usually every community suburbs least one elementary school. 
 
It's still going stop things, especially we're track NYC levels infection. We're fast approaching dark winter scenario school last worries rate. Keep damn schools closed teach online. Even well year compared usual teaching, even makes home life bit harder schedule. can't teach kids come home they're crippled inflammatory syndrome teachers die exposure. small price pay scale humanity. Australia exactly position claim know China virus spread, anything else matter. 

At point, money's involved, credibility entire western medical institution basically zero. He's tweeted -_-

""Coronavirus deaths way down. Mortality rate one lowest World. Economy roaring back shut down. ‚ÄúEmbers‚Äù flare ups put out, necessary!"" [- reasoned argument resort insults. Typical le.ftie. like that. Use common sense. Closed environment, masks, people breathing really heavily, breathing heavily. touch everything people touched.

Theres hundreds vaccine candidates there, suddenly telling magical chinese group Wuhan institute found inactivated vaccine works? telling GSK, famously invested heavily inactivated vaccine approaches 2009 Swine Flu Pandemic decided completely divest development vaccine themselves, favor partnering dozens startups, smart enough? chinese group apparently able away strings attached also able apply new strain covid spreading china? 


I call absolute bullshit. inactivated vaccine fundamentally works getting dead virus materials injected body uses develop immunity 


Typically generating weaker immune response virus already dead. typically lose immunity fast need multiple booster shots time. also run risk damage virus treatment make translate well live virus inevitably encounter 


  


This works things like flu well understood, novel pathogen evolving structure clearly understood inactivate safely maintaining efficacy immunogenic response, dont want go route inactivated vaccines. Either weaken immunity built run risk de-activate virus way may leave still infectious 


  


The reason almost everybody either subunit vaccines DNA/RNA vaccines former allows expose small bits virus targets immunogenic responses without risking infection harm patient (like common S-spike protein antigens surface virus) teach body fight virus without running risk virus something spread infection. 


The DNA/RNA basically ways use body create anti-gen elements inside body outcome teaching body fight virus sub-unit. 


I call horse shit article, fake news way mean? figure Growth Factor again? Apparently use determine virus still growing exponentially not. mass sacrifices bull god literate people substantial amounts lying around invested excess already invested.

Yeah, keep reinvesting dividends lower average cost instead pulling out, sold forms investments put stock market. addition majority investors still day jobs, savings salaries goes stocks. People wanted shit open up. Get haircuts. Go eat. Spend day beach. look ya. Sick dog.

Yep!!! /s. I‚Äôm still distancing socially, don‚Äôt worry. 

You idealistic views that‚Äôs remarkable. don‚Äôt share optimism. We‚Äôve deniers since day one. people don‚Äôt even believe virus real, won‚Äôt ever wear mask. say shouldn‚Äôt even locked all.

NY was/is indeed model rest country needed follow. Now, NY perfect plan means, say, took shit seriously got act together. people wearing masks, fucking mandating it. went hard phased reopening.

I still wear mask wash hands/use sanitizer good luck everyone else! Well personally idea wtf going government pandemix started. really know ignorance bliss means. outsider say president banned protests till notice mobilized army keep peace businesses safe. european im baffled seems pure docile complacent behavior american citizens medical costs force debt. happened france, whole country would consumed flames riots galore?? americans simply pay move on?? really shocking? someone Toronto? 1 month ago... yet talking 10 people...

He's point now. give shit. cares getting reelected stay prison. That's cares about. loses November, he'll attempt leave country January. time biggest importantly health care project world right Covid-19 vaccine. Billions put governments more-or-less giving companies blank cheques 120+ candidates development. amount money/energy/time put vaccine many magnitudes greater other. honestly Basic Income everybody. special extra millions millionaires Congress actually doing. Actually anything, basic income phased higher incomes, incomes progressively taxed 90%+ like historically. 

With basic income, need waste resources unemployment insurance. Also universal healthcare must. two things needed give country chance, especially middle class below. test free? I‚Äôm hearing it‚Äôs easier get test you‚Äôre paying it/using insurance can‚Äôt afford need one free tests it‚Äôs next impossible right now. country way out, regardless beat covid not(we won't). Time pack move greener pastures. America done. Lol Michigan would impossible. Try eating lunch 2 ft snow Cue fireworks liquor Say like Hitler, liked Germans. can't said DeSantis Floridians; evil fat prick. I'm struggling this. know take many precautions, still small office little ventilation. Maybe ventilation I'd expect, sake drilling teeth? points leading example. take issue words, would reacted way SK did.

Now here's problem. SK top control. Dem president ordering anything AL WY probably see much change maky see defiance. 

Also, Sk culture responds much authority (Japan also like that). US like EU people still going defying orders heavy fines started implemented. know. Maybe fireworks shows run poorly enough houses burn down, occupants use insurance money move state kill them. Hey, relevant all, props name. Made chuckle. British person well I'm particularly fond unions. Yes, give peace mind life savers worked companies without unions ones workers unionised underperforming lazy real winners frustrating me. Yeah tell 120k+ dead Americans. bet feel real good president fucked south rude awakening Darwin give fuck distrust science. us won't.

Right? seem see people saying lot reddit really gets me. presumably healthy people little scared saying it. given numbers imagine there's whole lot people severe risk. 

It gets insulting people throw away entire concept severely ill. People cancer, organ failure transplants, etc. Like matter people die, even rank important enough consider conversation. Like ""well dying anyway cares"" something. rednecks ignoring social distancing wearing masks around since March. schadenfreude level hits new peak every time hear something like this. Oh worry, we're getting started. America #1 üá∫üá∏üéÜ South Korea tested hell this, following testing every possible contact infected people, currently mortality rate 2.2% confirmed cases. There's still unknown carriers floating around there, given widely they've tested non-infected population (including mandatory testing hospital admittance), I'd guess 2% mortality rate probably close floor. I'm agnostic Trump

Are you? good chance vaccine winter though isn‚Äôt there? try optimistic Shits gonna get real bad fall weather slightly warm high humidity. perfect environment spread. Fucking Texas, man. got email last week employee auto shop went (emergency repair) tested positive covid. specifically went snap posted said I'm hanging wait see symptoms arise. 
 
I still got people calling asking hang out. Like damn fam usually appreciate attention COME üôÑ kids sent PowerPoint presentation every day video teacher set problems solve document write. 
I still wound spend hour days going principles slowly. 
Unless parents get involved essentially teacher see lot young kids struggling. trying convince Tesla still OK buy 300 mile family car. Fuck me. Actually, fuck Elon Musk fuck Tesla.

Going get Nissan Ariya get close 300 miles keep $50K. I'm 100% you. I'm losing mind frustration anger. 

So quick give rights protection 'terrorists' cuz we're afraid muslims, yet fuck telling wear mask pandemic. ""You jail"". 

I want rage. Also Illinois - first good thing I‚Äôve ever said Illinois lol

I feel extremely lucky live state county city do! 2 hours south Chicago overall, city taking super serious. Great hospital system, massive contact tracing program, amazing University helping tremendously testing research. feel Arizona, Texas, Florida likes. lot good people getting screwed stupid selfish Americans. SARS pretty much gone 18 months something never gets attention. disappeared fast showed candidates simply halted need.  mean either that, surge accident, actually design, government realizes America tolerate actions actually required control virus stage. would surprised see national messaging masks point coronavirus task gives next briefing. calculus really head scratcher. it‚Äôs like base wouldn‚Äôt screwed gutting ACA. seriously beginning think whole modus operandi 2020 scorched earth. None done year good re-election given he‚Äôs narcissist one would think would put else... didn‚Äôt. Incompetence could plausible explanation don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs either, seems malicious. FFS usa, get shit together.

Testing free easily accessible now. cancel it, let homeschool. think parents government ran public schools existed? tomorrow... 0s ""FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK"" know people it? entire (HUGE) family lives area none know anyone got it. weird me. then, live another high risk place, know anyone either. even know someone knows someone. 

(I saying fake. complete lockdown since March, continue long time) Hey potential U.S. Soldiers, don‚Äôt fucking sign military, you‚Äôve seen feel citizens, you‚Äôre fighting citizens military think people got bored. think people would happy get break taxes get income, stay home. 

The government want that. They've wanting kick people UI paying $600/wk within weeks. Meanwhile they're giving literal billions rich, surely need it, strings attached immediately. long don‚Äôt get collision don‚Äôt need seatbelt. months pandemic started. beginning, testing catching up, high backlog, rules yet established, etc.? Sure. 

But months everyone know better, especially politicians surrounded brightest heads inthe country. sad see. fear issue exclusive US, look case numbers (Germany) people behave public, surprised cases also climbing pandemic taught one thing, fast cases grow delayed picture current infections actually (ca.14d).

Anyways, best luck US citizens maybe think voting someone next election able speak coherent sentences also brag sexual harrasment among many distrubing ""character qualities"". *He‚Äôs graduated beyond bench defender. Pretty sure mask would cheaper. Rhymes dagnabbit 47k day? week? think they're looking cost/benefit. ones egregiously misplaced?

Corona won‚Äôt infect scouser would scared  *Alien Spaceship entered New York City Airspace* Thanks joe rogan not, always unemployment rate. Politicians get confused time react headlines media sure love ""stock market crashing!"" narrative. IIRC, \~20% community immunity, means reproductive rate virus \~1.2 means number infectons reduces. 


Anything means number infections increasing. 


I would imagine US numbers continue getting worse while... :( boycott China need buy use something... buy Chinese goods use chinese services. San Francisco East Bay seeing majority people wearing masks thank god. ""Lifelong"", know ""lifelong"" meant couple months. really sure actually lifelong couple months? Come im sure protests contributing somewhat cares Florida, sand isnt beaches head. prevents backflow end washing sewage water.

Also I'm u/mynewaccount22 \- pure coincidence.  alternatively : stupidity punished. always certainly fairly, stupidity punished. Friday 13th March 2020 city Philly's last day 'life knew it' (schools &amp; nearly everything still open), too. bad birthday 17 September. It'll probably super-crazy virus numbers wave 2 even here. :( Cutting federal funding test sites? 

Trump murderer players/athletes wearing masks? Don‚Äôt think wearing masks good performance don‚Äôt wear detrimental health. Maybe next year Chinese standard become world standard. 

 new Cold war emerging.A virus-free world herd immune world call BS news though. think capacity Oh right thought weekly average state. Switching tabs! sure us keep climbing. Houston already reached regular capacity. ICU beds Texas Medical Center full. burn surge capacity 2 weeks. 

That‚Äôs shit really hits fan. exhausted, death rates spike doctors begin decide gets attention left die. 

And since whatever action take need least 2-3 weeks take effect, it‚Äôs almost certain limit reached.  think this? like growth caps point. whole point exponential definitely play part better something many forget. Especially Texas, public transportation really used general public use commuting probably access car well. know plenty people city take DART bypass sitting car traffic. people work home take cars. 

Texas cities, plenty apartments, don‚Äôt really high occupancy buildings. complexes made 8-10 units entrances almost shared space. Texas much empty space, development building instead building up. 

That said though, Texas stubborn summer upon us, air Conditioning full force across state. Looking back historically meat packing plants, one reason considered extreme spread vectors, presence constant forced recirculated air. think see going. people don‚Äôt stat home, spread commercial AC units everyone ventures outside safety homes. 

I live Dallas. hope city/county shuts shit back like started, governor damned. Especially Houston running beds, it‚Äôs inconceivable people would drive sick loved ones 3-4 hours different city search treatment. Hopefully doesn‚Äôt come that, expect anything less would dishonest irresponsible part local authorities. yes young ppl lazy, old ppl good *‚ÄùFortunately, increasing distance, decreasing duration exposure, improving ventilation air around lower risk. outdoors generally helps three.‚Äù*

This isn‚Äôt even taking consideration effect masks lowering risk Watch number drop zero stop testing! Woah hoo need worry! Pandemic not, people need ear. submission removed because

I‚Äôm medical big deal. wearing properly feels professionally wrong... lol Australia panicking Melbourne (5 million population) getting 30 cases day (10 k tests per day) really do. freaking sucks. moved Hungary growing US. years, still blows mind walk pharmacy pay 270 forint meds. That‚Äôs 80 cents. Total.

The expensive medicine like 5k 15 bucks. always becomes clear bad America gets fucked see prices. Like remember brother needed topical steroid cream poison ivy fucking skin hard. like 250 dollars bottle! could literally measure dollars per milliliter.

I got shit dog Hungary skin reaction: 3k medicine, included visit. That‚Äôs $10!!!

Oh, this, flash card. insurance, co pay, whatever bullshit business term come feel legitimate. Obviously health system flaws too, FUCK Even though Texas whole fubared personally may saved someone's life actions.  Italian cannot say country dealt (for time being) virus best/perfect way. 

BUT surely dealt somehow contagion (average 0.1% daily contagion whole population).

I say this: WEAR MASK TIME economic damage happen either way virus gets worse. unneeded weren‚Äôt going follow actual containment plan, pandemic = economy ruined. could taken sharper immediate hit better long term outcome, shareholders demand profits now. Beaches open, tiny anti-lockdown protests, public parks managed impact? Amazing  Time force people wear masks. Good ol‚Äô USA, can‚Äôt take science‚Äôs word it, gotta overflowing hospitals bodies believe it. closest would think would Lombardy, Italy greatest comparison, 48 days 2,000+ new cases. worries Lombardy legitimately locked essential services open non essential commercial spaces open enforced restricted movement within country nearly entirety 48 days think around 38 days strict restrictions. Pretty much everyone‚Äôs retirement tied market. many company pensions anymore videos I've seen protests, people generally moving lot, close compared concert example standing still much closer people. also queue hour get protest. that, maintain density mask usage cause surge cases (which decide), see want outdoor activities open similar conditions. Yeah don‚Äôt worry much outdoors unless crowded like city street something, someone coughs. Coughs sneezes starting feel like shots fired now. Unless right wing protesters disagree you.   tf username ICU beds fill Arizona next week. That‚Äôs tragedy. amplifies death. teenager, wholeheartedly agree assessment teenagers. u/OohDatSexyBody President know he's hospital? tested group tests together test say 1,000 bags tests positive HIV (for example) whole lot 1,000 thrown away.

It's simple statistics. less likely lose vast amount bags blood unnecessarily. test every bag individually all. Lol remember seemed OK May... Reluctantly sure. Talking family east coast, sound like I'm recanting tales 2019 describe random work day. nailed ww2. space landing thing broad studies? heard time seemed rather anecdotal profound studies situation. Also question people die ICU (if like said even influence all) DR ist higher times overwhelmed health care system. Regardless DR higher specifically time everything hints case. say important understand reason behind it.

Do info howany tested studies laiming ventilation even inflicts damage helps? CAN'T surgeries since hospitals full. Hair salons still hold seats. saying smart, that's can't choose surgeries atm. It‚Äôs fake?! saw prez crayonning 1 jus da udder daze! Officer Doofy makes feel better, forever. old folks nursing homes nearing end lives see loved ones thru plexiglass window. Relatively speaking, long future ahead you. why? ever best? think missing point here. arrested free speech. US, hold freedom speech high regard. Totally agree, bit pedantry Arizona usually considered part ""the South."" started 2 weeks ago, line BLM. sure chin masks ear-hangers worse. Buddy, get yourself. made joke someone stuck shitty situation try brighten day. self righteous preaching telling anyone anything already know. bars bowling okay. Moron. live Norway. one wears masks here. fine. real issue. opening schools, that's also fine. Mass gatherings overcrowding public transport infects lot people. think main thing need constant exposure time, would need like reservoir something let air circulate pumped system. Trying install lights throughout system would probably bit costly, mention energy efficiency issue. said, could probably use powerful waves contained unit shortening necessary exposure time it‚Äôs tough say. It‚Äôs interesting idea though. Sorry dont save articles (there many every day). Saw 3-4 stating could see kids got grad parties. cruise ship exec seems delusional, thinks sane person would take trip leper colony cruise ship catastrophes. I'm Colorado. Lots idiot Texans coming vacation without masks. remember one party making hundreds public statements ok massive amounts people gather streets quite... removed guard rails, replaced warning signs tangentially related things. said cliff real, fault happen fall, probably cliff, preexisting fall damage Hii

Could someone please answer question :

Is credible scientific research ""sun/UV light"" killing coronavirus droplets ? someone link followup question would true, would indicate possible 2nd wave come summer simply would less ""light"" stop spreading ?

Thanks timeline optimistic. unemployment cut evictions start July 31. August going make June look like February. would rather leader could believe in, leader needs three things; Vision, influence followers. Yep, people sub think masks (and even N95s, crappy homemade cloth ones) kind miracle anti-Covid shield ignore social distancing (like protests).

This attitude actually stupid dangerous anti-mask one get downvoted hell pointing Looks like big jump Wisconsin single data point whereas see clear sharp trend Florida multiple. Relax dude. Lots people right thing. not. personal attack. Chill. Meanwhile Australia freaking bit reintroducing restrictions places 37 new cases yesterday. NZ less back normal.

Everyone watching America, looking good. Imagine fragile can't handle piece fabric face. Genius relative days DoJ can't believe literally middle summer right cases peak.

In places likely contributing factor - encouraging people indoors air conditioning. assess everyone's wealth? It‚Äôs inherently discriminatory, it‚Äôs fact. think affected? whole career jeopardy. I'm grad student whose lab trying get grant. study COVID NIH getting funds slashed administration. principal investigator get money, I'm fucked. department annoucned budget cuts wake pandemic. there's money, there's research. talk privileged. worry bills rent like everyone else fucking hellhole.

Guess what? taken issue seriously start, economic pain would much, much less. resist cooperating using damn heads issue, worse going fare, think I'm furious? government could enacted safety nets hard, 2 month solid, uniform nationwode lockdown, economy would gently reopen amd cause massive recession.But that's happened, needed bail big businesses first foremost give LA Lakers Steak N Shake loans meant mom n pop gigs. 

Our government willingly let virus spread beyond containment. government chided us concerned. government repeatedly claimed problem amd acted minimally far late. government created fostered politicization virus millions people believe wearing masks devil.

Direct anger fuckwits charge, me. could beaten shit already shit properly. wide combination bunch factors. Trump's response, Americas hardcore individualistic culture. political polarisation post-truth politics. nature states rights flaw notion republic. We're basically seeing American experiment truly put test reaping showed culturally perverse notion ""freedom"", idea American exeptionalism. extremely reductive blame Americans citizens given profoundly splintered nature governance (by design) economic social system choked alive billionaires corporations response either political extremism complete nihilism. Mask wearing + Social distancing + Contact Tracing \*extremely\* effective across Europe Asia.

Every day grateful live EU. together, I‚Äôm confident this. agree government overall incompetent beyond belief power people Reddit gives us chance come together tackle things together. 

Stay tuned keep faith. importantly, stay safe meantime. Take safety precautions protect loved ones that‚Äôs best advice given anyone right now. Stay away c0vidiots take control Shhh say anything protests, ruin beloved narrative virtuous stupid also evil Oh man thought totally ready reopen pretend everything fine /s leftist protestors actually believe virus real wearing masks taking basic precautions helps local guy hospital COVID three weeks (i think, KUOW), bill? $1.1mil dollars.

Tired fucking idiots.  Well thankfully Europe still #1, North America. [Experts still call Europe worst affected American, too. slow testing I‚Äôm Houston, agree.

Though may uncomfortable hear, least comments straightforward.

French government openly said regional re-shutdowns likely possibility (Germany one). localized shutdowns (a schools) already happened. France says ""lockdown"" ""shut down"", things really locked down. Italy tough, way tougher US gotten.

Many wearing masks, people constantly providing advice stay safe socially distance protesting. happens protesting right is, know, maybe, little important spring break? 
But about..... true. cant coincidence month ago people started protesting rioting tens thousands country virus back way worse ever was. way coincidence.  Death counts still going steady rate though .

I know systems relatively well.
It would work would actually help us sides border. 
The real problem middle man here. insurance companies willing let go cash cows. 

Imagine great America would ppl could focus recovery getting well rather destroy immune system stress caused imminent bankruptcy? That‚Äôs remember? I'll say CONVENIENT Many many pockets CA far ‚Äúblue.‚Äù example, us consider Orange County Florida CA - rich white boomers literally die allow care another human being. send us back mask, bottle hand sanitizer thoughts prayers even better. imagine kid tested positive teacher ends dying, grief guilt going 10x worse sad can‚Äôt see friends. nobody questions merit, character, shitty human successful one Let google Bing I'll go million dead Americans October Trump care everything makes things worse. Sweden highly educated population, citizens told basically know trust common sense, careful behave, especially risk group. risk groups. Please behave, could close economy, feel like need specific situation. 

Three weeks later, cases europe, yet deathrate really bad comparison, educated population took seriously protected other, combined strong healthcare system testing, recovering well. remember visiting girl‚Äôs family Yuma relative came something needed go emergency room for. one shitty hospital entire city. sat waiting area lot people, something like 3 hours, took us patient room, nurse took vitals left, waited waited hours more. doctor never appeared. could hear families next us waiting too. said fuck left. shit medical care average folk normal times, can‚Äôt imagine shit show must now. point I'm starting wonder he's *trying* keep going election. Maybe thinks chaos pandemic election work favor, especially he's convincing followers nothing worry (for pull crowded polling place). Protests also added spread, there‚Äôs much sensitivity around protecting official figures don‚Äôt want admit it. try blame ‚Äúselfish gatherings,‚Äù instead ‚Äúunselfishly righteous‚Äù ones. Neither allowed.

It‚Äôs goddamn pathetic.

Had conversation coworker today made sense it. Canada able control like Europe, Canada social control likeliness adhere government restrictions recommendations...

... US, put it, NOBODY told they‚Äôre literally willing die told govts health officials social distance wear masks. said thought process Americans different level entitlements that, basically, didn‚Äôt fight independence told do.

And it‚Äôs making sense now. video CNN citizens addressing govt body conspiracy theories masks followed accosting smart ones room something Jerry Springer. Really sad times we‚Äôve (unfortunately it‚Äôs bound trickle way border) descended too.  Surprise surprise, guess people from? Dumb idiots like keep idiocy home instead moving countries cocking locals. need prove stopped prosecution.

When see billboard thanking essential workers, pisses empty bullshit that's supposed placate me, written fuck exploiting others shitty situations like mine. people deliver thank service, genuinely appreciate know they're sincere appreciate me.

There's huge difference two.

But victim system. appreciate people recognize well. someone genuinely thankful service sympathetic situation, feel seen, makes day much brighter horribly shitty times.

I appreciate thankful service workers. We've always invisible, although situation fucking sucks, I'm really glad people (who probably appreciated us anyway) showing genuine support us.

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide actually makes sense. Gonna depend pays most. New York able stabilize faster. California issue resistance measures, least county levels.

The thing New York closer think state: One population center (if *huge* one), one identity. California could country states. Two major population hubs along smaller, decently-sized cities places, various different regions, county-to-county breakdown different two oppositely-placed US states (LA vs OC vs Riverside vs San Diego, compared San Francisco, Fresno, Modoc). Unfortunately state, least populous areas driving numbers early on, feel like playing along long enough exception San Francisco, could argued similar NYC. confirmed cases correlate directly number test. We're testing finding dying. That's good news. Sorry want bad news. Im tired, read mirror minor three times. Remindme! 1 month  dunno. happy cake day friend! get ""economy"" prioritized pandemic.

Americans take good look shit, want live country shit?

Oh wait stellar healthcare, fucking problems! Red Cross Police basically built fence around buildings meat plant workers live broke quarantine. affects 1000 people, yes, these, families neighbors hard quarantine.

The county (I guess, ""Kreis G√ºtersloh"", city surroundings) went lockdown again, meaning ""stay home much possbile, businesses need close again"".

Now testing many people possible, seems infections outside factory staff. Every single hospital healthcare system worth name already triage guidelines place situations may necessary ration care. Precisely left clinicians making life death decisions fly.

Thankfully, guidelines based whether random people internet think nice person rather chances survival quality life number years expected left survive. fuck cares CDC says?

I‚Äôm moderate risk I‚Äôm Georgia masks appear exception, rule. school system suggest enforce nothing it. mean, many high schoolers going volunteer wear mask? Oh yea, start back person instruction 5 weeks. I‚Äôm looking forward it. virus suddenly back, simply never left. yes, possible increase infections part related recent riots protests.

It's probably also related Memorial Day, people relaxing social distancing measures and/or less vigilant safety measures, states opening up, people simply self righteous care protecting others wearing mask.

With July 4th around corner, surprised another big spike coming mid- late-July. rich could take everything can. Aristocracy serfs, like good old days.

( Insert sad sarcasm smiley ) ""We beat Corona, flu year really bad, killed like 200k people past 2 months."" many deaths though? sounds precisely like testing  voters sdny, hope. mean going back March? US already worse position March! That‚Äôs Brazil also dog headed idiot leader. Italy least recovering surprised, eventually death toll surpass 10 times WWII...?

Wear fuxxking mask people!  Young population - tons mild cases get reported?  sounds like advertisement Bing anything else...there plenty reputable ways track virus there, much way better search engine. I‚Äôd make sarcastic joke clearly Bill Gates trying fool us, unfortunately many idiots would see serious That's sad üò≠üò¢üòîüôÅ‚òπÔ∏è It‚Äôd great Mexico somehow fully contained virus instituted travel ban US citizens, even joked offering pay wall.

Plus, busses fucking nightmare. way ""social distance"" 20 year old deathwagon. wave. constant flow live Central Valley, people politicized virus since beginning. I'm glad people demanding folks take seriously. November suddenly Bidens fault done single thing yet president pandemic People even wear mask, think they'll line day one get vaccine? 

The vaccine could ready today US would still fucked. People already think Covid liberal conspiracy Dear Leader going willingly take it, especially Biden president then. vaccines particularly effective elderly risk. works younger people, think they're immune serious consequences anyway, decide en masse get vaccinated. idiots cause spike.  Oh snap. jobs finally 2 months. Good them. I‚Äôd looking another job past fourth months  happen like 2 months ago? Climate change, dangers factory farming (both terms destruction environment, resource intensity, propensity spread viruses - see many many outbreaks happen particularly Tyson 'meat processing plants') - it. really believe 250 cases? I'm gonna edge bing There‚Äôs üî• corona porn there. It‚Äôs like STD way contagious deadly China definitely lied deceived world, doubt.

But US intelligence picked wind something brewing back November, administration basically deemed unimportant. could stopped ever becoming problem. government wasted January, February, March downplaying virus' severity ordering upregulation manufacture medical supplies. allowed misinformation spread created hostile environment partisan lines dictated response virus carried out. Huh? we'll herd immunity (in Texas/Florida).

Yes, cynic. Ugh. look flu outbreaks year shows rural areas immune influenza. hell would think different coronavirus?? learn communist regime? Sweden fucked hard, long way away Herd immunity can't go lot countries EU. 

But importantly, swedes fucking idiotic Americans ignore science. welcome every inconvenience cheerfuly? otherwise would fragile course  SF Bay area like became true would backfire. Europe, medical care often purely privatised (there loads systems, course, county thing) lots stories beds/respirators taken old people given younger people capacity overwhelmed.

How work places like USA patients insurance paying bed/respirator?

Can Drs take old person give younger one? 2nd daily record breaker week?  4x number tests, number infected, yield 1/4 percentage positives.

The percentage positives halved instead. mean number infected double April?  ""How dare attempt stop people getting virus imported goods!"" That's sound like. moment now... Great advice! Yeah I‚Äôve stockpiles topped since late February. adding last minute items like generator hurricane season (yay). Efficiency matters. national self-entitled angry assholes wear ignorance badge. seeing natural selection. 

Of course help went with, ""Elect stupid leaders, win stupid prizes."" ANYONE else running show, would better off. 6 year old watched Trump talk Covid day. shit not, turned said concern, ""Daddy, he's stupid think he's lying virus.""  

Sadly get deserve, wish part it. ""Turd flushed white house"" ü§£ü§£ü§£ love left gives comments like these... truly caring. truly worried. meanwhile ""fake news"" crowd sits arms crossed like, ""we hate people."" ""fuck everyone"" long idiot decided microwave ensure virus free. I‚Äôd take joy smiling face gasp sifts air ventilator. ‚ÄúOh want spit tube? I‚Äôll see help.‚Äù

I‚Äôd actually enjoy seeing ones suffer. remorse. crisis US complete without ""Mission Accomplished"" banner feelgood speech leaders. agree. find basic guide-lines sort enough. elderly select risk populations taking pre-cautions huge thing.

I assume Sweden would say realize strict lock downs US. varied State essentially every thing closed. People told guests over. restaurants, bars, retail shops, leisure closed. National Parks, National Forests, course many beaches closed. 


People literally locked away houses weeks. 

I've seen mobility data Sweden I've seen pictures videos insane much active were. still year left lease leave Sacramento, I'm going back work save money leave I‚Äôm struggling understand comparisons. People living South, black people general, aren‚Äôt *nearly* predisposed hiv lgbt community. Gay bisexual men make 70% new hiv cases US. 1 6 hiv positive gay men US unaware virus. half infected people US gay/bisexual men. significant majority *new* cases gay/bisexual men. 

Its absurdly high rate infection 15% infected within group unaware hiv. think practice discriminatory nature cancerous regressive. understand difficult negative stigma around gay/bi men this, really awful. But, specifically regarding blood/plasma donation, doesn‚Äôt policy continue make sense? Gay bisexual men infected *absurd* rates compared demographic. gay/bi population much risk someone South someone black. 

Testing expensive, right? Hundreds samples tested once, lost tainted sample. means would enormous amounts money spent testing (testing *rates* would increase dramatically well) well increase tainted samples lost donations. extra donations relatively small group population would result significant increases spending lost donations, doesn‚Äôt make sense, doesn‚Äôt it?

Im entirely unbudgingly discrimination towards lgbt community. Like question all. understand frustrating could be. I‚Äôm struggling see policy unfair discriminatory. anyone could better job explaining discontinue policy? I‚Äôm open changing mind.  Yeah said protests, people wont able take separate cars get protests are. People use public transportation, crowd local shops/bars use toilet get refreshments. 


Definitely big risk transmission Mortality also goes infections. Healthcare becomes unavailable population many cases.

Something simple broken leg car accident leave unable receive proper medical attention coronavirus cases take everything. wonder Americans get infected droves. Yes, soon find heading direction NY was, already late anything Say something WW1 deaths reference, im sick seeing guys deflect feelings hurt someone said self centered obvious shit.

Just say something WW1 thing soft ego. exactly is. Better most, really shouldn‚Äôt complain lot. still job even though work public bit control level exposure. I‚Äôm healthy yet!

How you? alright? Bit defensive you. actually great analogy concept slow changes time amount huge problems. Death thousand cuts. 

And people much ""instant gratification"" culture can't look future make sacrifices daily basis ""it's bad"". 

Add corrupt media politicians 30+% country trust believe impunity got making monster problems. Yeah we're probably going see doubling numbers every week Texas next weeks beyond lock again. Makes sense US back April progress virus. sounds like trying take supposedly 'easy' way out.Our hospitals already getting flooded,can't imagine scenario comes full fruition. It‚Äôs possible, repurposed Walmart‚Äôs made detention centers. wouldn‚Äôt put past government make makeshift hospitals case shit hits fan. Where's thanos need Let's clear, US pretty good, depending situation, type thing into, may well best.

But idea best place would *in general case* laughably absurd positive never left North America, else lack perspective. That's works. use something called ""biological age"" age terms years. relatively frail 60yo could considered biological age 80, particularly vital 80yo could considered.
In case, residents care homes Sweden definition frail since that's requirement even admitted first place. average life expectancy person care home 6 months.

Evidence? asked acquaintance nurse.
And no, Hippocratic oath administer care useless. Exactly. work Healthcare NNJ. 

I'm really proud turnaround we've here. 2 months ago every ER bed full ventilated patients every 911 call either DOA critically ill patient. complete opposite now. Havent Covid patient weeks. safer go (although safe used be). feels like we've contained virus rest country really understand we've went through. really hope to. Severity said inconveniences subjective matter. human beings imperfect, emotions, subjective tastes subjective value systems. robots tend otherwise dumb things offer us something private subjective value. 

But hey, try send letter bank. ""Hey guys, pandemic going gonna stop paying mortgage bothers you, fragile thats insignificantly small comparison covid.""

But somehow dont believe would happy. Except citizen journalist comes agenda making bunch bullshit false news. 

If CCP values image anything, China big bad provocation trouble making"" lol care region come from, developed country there's excuse this.

Then excuse Snowden. dead anerage I. last five years Sweden.

Testing though. 

Sweden got two weeks later people stopped dying 4 weeks after. Flatter curve sure alot. Defund police would great :) Skip smoking known cause lungs hold onto Coronavirus particles actually potential make sick? Like, it‚Äôs actual health recommendation quit smoking obvious reasons ‚Äî number lungs already ‚Äî adding choice damage fold puts nails coffin.

The simple fact it‚Äôs agitator virus reason enough, imo.

I‚Äôll sit popcorn see many dead Texans takes change greedy, selfish self-centered way thinking. Ya‚Äôll look like 3rd world country. embarrassing! Good point. thought people getting reinfected (or wasn‚Äôt clear whether hadn‚Äôt cleared infection residual dead rna symptoms months) 1% still global average Maybe they're trying get ahead backlash unleashed Israel annexes huge portion West Bank next week. ""Look, they're criticizing Israel's political agenda..... Anti-Semites"". Looking comments can't notice Tesla's successes work briliant staff, termination notice 2 people Elon's personal failure, he's probably one CEO's talk anybody probably get  dry PR statement like Amazon Walmart /s. So, on, incoming ICU patient faces higher probability coming back feet first...! sympathy you, Texas. ! Rural hospitals get hard.

Just show point Indiana's peak ICU 800 peak hospitalizations 1800. Well look US curve vs rest world. Look Trump narrative issue. Correlation right there. discrimination, fact shows gay men likely HIV. 


If HIV transmission particularly recent there's chance false negatives. even need that. would go long way would tell people wear mask. Give library‚Äôs give death Nah, AskJeeves far better.  really excellent! Thanks, I‚Äôll suggest this. last reunion (many years ago!) people kind stood around chatted. could see virtual groupings actually helping people get know one another better. üòÄ do, infection recent there's higher chance testing miss virus. heard come end coding, true that? Texas' ICUs 100% normal capacity projected excede unsustainable surge 11 days.. There's also lot evidence children major influence spread virus. US might actually good thing going school busses used many areas. major risk spread schools seems parents dropping children, school busses prevent minimize. Dude, tests perception problem problem.

The problem hospitals. They're full, tests tests.

It means people dying would survived, like Italian first wave. save 50yo father three 40yo mother one ? long trump tweets good fine hospital is, achievement reach 100%, great work perfect marks Someone cared passed virus, one last thing said would killed forced sit home nothing 4 months. always told wants die boots on. Game dumb fucks. take see what‚Äôs happening? It‚Äôs madness. Oh yeah people die car crashes. Better ban cars, sure What's increased risk liquor stores? need grab carton milk, go bodega that's primarily liquor store, feels safer grocery store.

Don‚Äôt worry sub full weirdos addicted sensationalist headlines fear mongering. right want things shouldn‚Äôt fee guilty it. person said friends die isn‚Äôt wrong, they‚Äôre huge asshole. link:

""Scientists propose wearing masks also helped, young protesters might infected severe symptoms would missed official COVID-19 numbers. ‚ÄúThe fact never know sure, there‚Äôs many moving parts,‚Äù says epidemiologist Andrew Noymer."" Sweden's social distancing one lowest around. 

Retail mobility actually substantially higher baseline. Transit usage 1/3. 

Sweden also recommend masks ever has. Mask usage said close zero. America never lets Brazil shine. Get USA high time Brazil. forced quarantine? WTF? what's surprised this. honestly thought average American intelligent this. 

Its genuinely blown away TRULY believe best world, best everything, problem big, better everyone else, cases spiking nah America big place, let virus stop us getting back normal, right freedom!

What going catch America ignorance (flawed) superiority complex can't see past. stop blaming this.  WEAR MASKS! Athletes need lungs perform peak. show performance. Think boxer mma fighter ""gassing out."" lungs damage, happen much sooner fight. constitutional right apparently... done arguing people took long time America get 30,000 40,000!

I suspect it'll take America lot less time hit 50,000 new cases single day. think, despite lax restrictions, people actually aware social distancing, travel less, wash hands properly, eat less etc. Many working home, skip gym on. forced lockdown, social activities definitely decreased staying low.  
The weather amazing right people prefer outdoor activities indoor pubs/restaurants on. Well think governor needs get concerned growth curve accelerating 2 3 weeks people really start dying there's room left enough doctors/nurses help them. Wardrobes closed. 

There mandatory user hand sanitizer. People requested use gloves.

Equipment difficult clean removed. 

Increased cleaning staff cleaning.

Distance treadmills increased.

They keep tabs number people attending, many connections time, start lines one out, one system.

It feels safe. That‚Äôs logic apply moron wearing mask public places this. sympathy choke choices, gasping sifts air.

‚ÄúScience? Health? fuck know. grandpappy dun gon‚Äô fight right choose. America, son.‚Äù /s Can't wait see gets better tomorrow! Thanks laugh would graphs look like positivity rate instead raw numbers positive cases? Testing increased lot since March, it? Australia (25 million pop), high restrictions easing, 2 ICU.

Don't cherry pick data suit narrative,  Yeah that‚Äôs classic. I‚Äôve read Reddit probably 100 times *businesses want survive*

Another blow made staff, many seasonal employees many cultural sector work actors various performances.

But yeah okay. aaaaall lies. USA's never done anything bad. get wrong, China employed someone wrong things, continuously trying end free, democratic righteous hegemony US, put national security privacies citizens.

That make anything USA okay. America's bad, ad destroyed.

At least, we're still point 5-satr generals ordering tanks roll veterans fighting World War One. go guess. Ugg... North Carolina. Right border complete morons started recover. virus know house God stay away. always worked before. already know immunity fairly short. line cities normally experience. IE, positivity rates protestors higher non-protestors. Great job. One thing remember data based tested cases, actual cases. might see different trending behavior states slow testing largest contributors hit maximum testing capacity.

The consensus 10 actual cases every tested cases, probably 6-8 range right now. still means
- actually getting ~250,000 - 300,000 new cases every day.
- least 1,500,000 infected, contagious people walking around US right now. I‚Äôm TN. 

Preach!!!! spreading numbers without understanding mean. way you‚Äôve quoted makes seem like 25-40% people get virus long term impairment. actually read studies though (not alarmist news articles) you‚Äôll realize two things: 1) studies performed people treated virus (not ‚Äúthose infected‚Äù bad enough condition receive medical care) 2) long term effects mostly mild result serious impairment lung function.Also 40% ‚Äúasymptomatic‚Äù covid patients showing lung changes refers study Wuhan describes CT changes due covid induced pneumonia. pneumonia causes lung changes time it‚Äôs permanent. cannot say anything permanent impairment lunch capacity please stop quoting crazy figures like this.

Anyone saying anybody could helped Peru poor country needs give head shake wake up. fully include unaccounted cases people died COVID19 tested it, hence death included official death count. 

But also depends states guideline, states count people died covid 19 like symptoms, considered COVID 19 related death tested it. [This Vox, explains hard get accurate scale infection death ongoing outbreak.

While true, numbers suggest fatality rate virus low, especially manage get proper healthcare system overburdened.

Seoul everything packed people wearing masks new clusters come places like bars one gives fuck something effective mask.  Oh oh oh here

Why need wear mask? NYC also isn‚Äôt city protesting yet see spike don‚Äôt opinion yeah right. Yet strangely deaths last 3 days dropped couple hundred time.

Someone twisting death stats top. Young, dumb good chance killing mom. Hold *grunt* got one them. sand season, yes. sand season, yes. la la la US fine 
la la la US population healthiest
la la la don‚Äôt virus problem

/S Cries California mean, voters think potentially deadly virus exist/can't hurt you, lose voters die... attempts testing/tracing

Not lacklustre - deliberately inadequate.

Part strategy always allow virus spread general, ""low risk"", population method gaining ""herd immunity"" lowest loss life.

If tested everyone suspected virus, people would lot less likely pass similar ""low risk"" people, would jeopardise ""herd immunity"" strategy.

It's hard prove deliberately testing fewer people actually able test. Consider V√§stra G√∂taland region. week 19 performed 4,341 tests. week 20 5,050, week 21 4,119 week 22 5,542.

Then government changed testing criteria, expanding seriously ill ""high risk"" patients people milder symptoms. Suddenly week 23 number tests performed V√§stra G√∂taland region alone tripled 15,278, exceeding 22,000 per week.

This proves capacity test more, chose to.

The rational reason test fewer people able to, actually want people tested, reason want tested would found infected, were.

That allowed government simultaneously claim rate infection slowed, ""herd immunity"" far away reality, spread stopped, even slowed.

They wanted people infected. rational excuse decisions made regarding testing, masks, non-medical interventions.  Yes, great idea. good mangos us now. US followed Canada‚Äôs example. 

Shut down, control, masks, reopen, economic upshift.

Queue wave 2... Global pandemics deal exponential growth, linear growth - takes irresponsible counties failing follow even minimum procedures get spread throughout state.

Additionally, recent study found private social gatherings might fueling spike - totally jives I've noticing feeds. buncha folks wringing hands dangers COVID - go hang friends ""they know better safe."" Holy shit, too! Ever since young (in saying that, I've got admit I've barely started 20s lol) everything America looked sounded like paradise, damn, think last 4-5 years really realized privileged live life grow here. problems gosh, nearly everything living blessing. truly hope best America going long journey everyone needs adapt compromise collectively sake everyone. 14 % Webasto yes might skewed That‚Äôs fault picking job ‚ÄúProduction Manager‚Äù, Ding Dong.

Make sure French fries extra crispy, thanks. US, 4% world's population, 25% world's coronavirus cases. Obviously we're lot wrong. seem like partisan refusal wear masks may bigger issue opening, since opening way dangerous without masks. Assuming everyone employed all. everyone applied gotten theirs. Yeah people seem forget yeah pretty alarming flu seasons recent years. flu season going look like year nation people recovering covid19? Ive saying begining. Told wife early take confirmed number cases see multiply 10 (and conservative). Think going tested asymptomatic.... many people. Hell I'm Canada New Zealand looking good. Even though really good leadership right now. (For min anyways trumps country getting antsy making unintelligible comments nothing current affairs nasty say words) Scheer dirtbag live large city Florida virus spreading control. Let tell it‚Äôs like. 

When lockdown order came down, everyone scared followed rules. stayed inside socially distanced exercising outside grocery store. didn‚Äôt see lot masks time one could get them, don‚Äôt think recommend time anyway. weeks in, lot people started wearing masks grocery stores. Etsy orders finally arrived. 

When Florida started reopening May, people went droves. Memorial Day weekend like cork flying champagne bottle. Everything got *packed*.

My wife never changed cautious behavior threat far passed. felt left behind friends family gotten together like old times last month.

We weird ones now. Hardly anyone wants distance masks non-existent places. It‚Äôs clear lot businesses well beyond law‚Äôs stated 50% capacity. 

Over last week several restaurants gyms voluntarily closed Covid infections. deep clean, reopen. businesses decided close pandemic ends. 

Our governor largely MIA, and, yes, feel like own. local counties imposed mask orders. don‚Äôt know people following go pick groceries walk dog large, open park. 

My advice?

Excess fear hurt you, careful that. Remember you‚Äôll probably ok apply everything you‚Äôve learned last months. Always socially distance. Always wear mask shared, enclosed space. Wash hands.

Adapt endure daily situation changes, understand know everything need know survive this. moment calls patience self-discipline. 

I fully believe vaccine normal life resume shortly thereafter. hang on.. one foot front other, every day, over. 

You got this. üôÇ Hospitals around country ebb flow patients. days ICUs full. days 90% empty. Settle down.  Yesterday briefing showed mobility data comparison Sweden nordic neighbours. Interestingly enough, Sweden went less drop maintaining longer, ones baseline mobility now. follows WHO's standard count asymptomatic cases confirmed ones. countries hospitalized cases counted, excludes asymptomatic cases naturally. ( list, sorry. )

China unique searches asymptomatic cases extensively add result official number confirmed cases. Romanian citizens banned entering Estonia Denmark rise cases. People believe virus following lax guidelines.  matters article?!  conditioned sake bottom line. guilty -- anyone actually supports current pathogen needs destroyed along Repulican Democratic parties. question - changed? come meat food factories (bakeries, dairies, fruit veg...) managed keep going peak Covid back April? 

The truth course might widely reported. either two things:

* New treatments avaliable US lowering death rates.

* US ramping testing, lowering apparently case/death ratio. wonder happen people screaming cops protecting people BLM antifa suddenly start issuing people tickets wearing mask. call police hero‚Äôs democratic operatives? came Europe where? China??? extent it‚Äôs indecent, sure. 

It‚Äôs sad people think it‚Äôs okay government allowed impede body like this. agree people wear masks (I agree certainly do) also realizing government overreach never okay. 

Very concerning you. You‚Äôd love Cuba. family stay let know. Good, someone start saving Florida itself.  Every corona needs it‚Äôs lime testing sites destroyed 70 Minnesota. Trump said less testing less cases. shut economy bigger disaster countries trying flatten curve. United States decided curl instead. China needed test 2.3 Million people find 256 cases. make sound dire. worth libs lulz. /s Stockholm region testing free - PCR antibodies. 17.2% earlier studies offered testing people commercial testing facility testing behalf employers covering costs think. Daycares well. Even trying best avoid getting sick, sick easily two weeks month. One students sneezed blood directly onto face. walked it. Sweden : 
7 days incidence : 76,7/100k pop.
Germany 
7 days incidence : 4.8/100k pop.
Austria 
7 days incidence : 3.1
Italy 
7 days incidence : 2.6

Sorry bother u statistic proof Sweden abject failure. Ugh Facebook.

""nudge-nudge-wink-wink cracked secret code, that's wanted along""

...this blood greg abbott's hands... mentioned wanted fewer cases, strat ensure reelection. Although case numbers going up. heartening news death rate still dropping.

Unfortunately may start change new cases start overload hospital system, lets hope not. special kind stupid. death rate country rising. Since test, got contact anyone I'm thankful every time I'm going out, make sure wear mask gloves... symptoms I'm feeling way better.. cloged nose time time...

The kids like water maybe canoe better. Thanks suggestion. Heh, r/&amp;x63;ovidi&amp;x6f;ts subreddit quite active. Well, point mere fact wearing mask doesnt mean person question forcing others get corona swinging fists speak. spent whole life without mask never forced corona anybody.

Being without facemask infected? getting somewhere.

Now make mind. claim call mandatory masks concessions freedoms. Cant Exactly come back month deaths high peak number cases high. work healthcare, anywhere near bad Sample size = 579.  Lmao Maybe he's dead? could one good news majors require labs. home lab provide.  

It'll interesting. 8) think handle BS Pence, Birx rest trump apologists.

Everything going stupid nonsensical positive spin.

Give us daily CDC briefings like normal administration would doing, uncensored non-scientists/doctors stay away. Bc Obamas idea higher. 

I don‚Äôt live Texas anymore still bunch family there: accounts many folks adjusted well quarantine. Abbott demands state reopen empowers idiots believe everything ‚Äúnormal‚Äù now. 

No idea re-election opposition absolutely start mud slinging poorly handled pandemic.  I'm hoping bernie still comes back. Biden 10000 times better trump USA needs politician leader right now. hair sniffing politician. ""Some may die. sacrifice I'm willing make"". It‚Äôs things people need it‚Äôs ruining economy people money support work protect others eating drinking? Take one bite, put mask on? modelled little ago. use IFR, deaths per day lags based infection detection time estimate total cases. used IFR 1.2%, think might lower, think estimates base numbers CDC 0.4% think low. also remember, uncontrolled growth seeing, number undetected cases blow substantially. focus declining number deaths? student could build personal lunch igloo. Considering administering 175k tests per day old peak April, versus 500k+ now, think it‚Äôs safe assume we‚Äôre still April numbers. However, widespread nature growth seeing today going ensure peak ultimately much much worse April‚Äôs. Yeah keep posting this. change anything, get results. accelerating number infections/hospitalizations. 

If say ""I want shut state unless gets really bad"", conditions, actually saying: ""we'll wait shut state *when* gets really bad"". 

It's like governors expect sudden prophylactic treatment appear, sudden change everyone's behavior simultaneously. virus gets tired decides leave us alone, know thinking. Passivity going cause infections continue climb. shut now, wait really bad shut later. Even protests effect, feels like way many people taking protests license drop *all* measures meant preventing virus‚Äôs spread, childish logic it‚Äôs ‚Äúfair‚Äù protesters marching outside can‚Äôt go bars, clubs parties without masks. four year old already starting grow logic.

Like, it‚Äôs possible protests parties spreading virus. doesn‚Äôt become less deadly officials pandering protesters. mask one component stopping COVID spreading. Another social distancing. love ignore one focusing solely another end disease prevention. 

Me: bet people wearing seatbelts going increase amount automotive deaths

You: people deactivate airbags? They're going cause spike vehicular deaths.

It's both, complacent hundreds thousands protesters social distancing, focusing 6,000, wear masks. Pssst. bias showing. I'm even arguing idiots attended Trump rally increase spread. I'm defending assholes. I'm saying there's bigger problem BLM protests, media Left pretty much ignoring condoning. response pointing is, ""Yeah, Trump too."" Whataboutism hardly convincing think is.  Duh Yes, think does. one campus months. able conduct study? Surprise! It‚Äôs COVID-19!! 0.2-1% consensus **entire time**. data used projections used support lockdowns EU SIP US. gotta check way overhang leans top. 

Maybe ... well, fuck police tried hard, actually not, end, even matter. shit load people asymptomatic....?

getting ""mortality rate"" confirmed cases useless potentially 50% cases never show symptoms never tested confirmed. believe them?? Yeah he's piece fucking shit. suckles straight Trump teat though, never high expectations him. comments day speech teacher pay, though, basically said going anything people listen anyway... new low.

Complete lack leadership. start telling people stay home go ER symptoms like back early April. Can‚Äôt high hospital numbers don‚Äôt accept patients. couldn‚Äôt breathe, chest pains, toes blue still said come ER/to stay home quarantine back early April someone call ER me. pure coincidence we're seeing record spikes around time we'd anticipate bc these?? paying time took doctor look images, sticking endoscope nose. yes still expensive obesity numbers gone precaution comorbidity? also living healthily doesn‚Äôt bankrupt Wow, holy shit, automod literally let utter name political party running country. decision one made ""purely politics."" literally dozens articles linked sub past 24 hours suggesting exactly - little cases occurred due protests. find hard believe - I'm open minded. true, absolutely - outdoor activities general need stop regarded high risk. actually far off, original $1200 stimulus, plus extra $600, $1,800 assuming (obviously 100% accurate) 209,000,000 adults got full $1800, that's $376.2 billion dollars stimulus money.

Not justifying stimulus corporate bailout. thought interesting.

If $1,200 month adults 3 months, would come $752 billion dollars. waiting people start voting you, don‚Äôt go around telling truth Thanks link, great way start morning :) saw numbers too. CDC estimates could high 10x amount confirmed US. best 23M, that‚Äôs still 7% US population. people need learn hard way social distancing masks. This. Concerts cancelled, filming new seasons TV shows enjoy postponed. 

I don‚Äôt family worry friends concern with, greater good world I‚Äôm home planning leaving unless anytime soon. groceries occasional drive through, roommate same. fucking sucks know parts since March people don‚Äôt give fuck making us even longer now. hope people begin take seriously now, conference call C-suite couple months talking virus, infection vectors blah blah CEO, lives wealthy area OC, asked germophobe, fast forward he‚Äôs finally concerned buddies got place also actively frequenting I‚Äôm sure mask finally urging distancing mask use. People don‚Äôt care see bad first hand. can‚Äôt tell comment real troll....


Seemed real hit ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt anymore‚Äù ski resort 

Once ride kangaroo slope, never go back skis boards. unfortunately one ‚Äúall sides‚Äù things. I‚Äôve conversations people left GMOs gone similarly.

Them: ‚ÄúA UN study found so-called Golden Rice absolutely nutritional value whatsoever KILLED BABIES.‚Äù

Also, conflation Monsanto GMO products general. Basically, logic chain Monsanto evil, Monsanto makes GMOs anyone, therefore GMOs evil. 

There‚Äôs room lot nuanced discussion GMOs risks benefits, ‚Äúall GMOs evil must keep previous plant DNA pure unchanging evolution intended it‚Äù attitude really, really annoying. america's response best, that's gut tell him. must true.  economy literally fuelled human beings. they‚Äôre well they‚Äôre broke there‚Äôs economy.  people voted strongman checks out.   FHMs test invited 1500 people Rinkeby (a Stockholm suburb lot immigrant hit hard) 500 wanted get tested. 
We see get results test. Maybe next week. Cold/flus love lower humidity. see spikes every year late summer/early fall, beginning spring.

kids terrible comes wiping nose. ask basically 1st 3rd grade teacher often get sick September November. mom probably got strep every year teacher.

Using word hardwired ignores free will. proper skills learned, every human capable change. it‚Äôs true, China hide long? lol thought same, also think criticism Nordic partners sort effect - cannot prove, feels like talking people here. OTOH coronavirus antibodies around 1-3 years infection someone would gotten coronavirus relatively recently give false positive way. Everyone yell surprise real loud! Never would believed police fact protecting people. Miracles never cease amaze. stock market never sign general economic health. Ok, many countries?

The core protocol (DP-3T) app shared many countries. rest depends countries laws decisions act case extremely pessimistic prediction. lot things done avoid next large scale lockdown.

I speak live basically back normal (according law) people still careful others all. thing ""different"" many large events like festivals already cancelled. see elderly people mask places mandate like hairdresser, doctors,... public transport. 
There simply lot cases superspreaders bars, clubs likely public transportation. + Open-space offices notorious spreading infectious diseases ventilation. 

No, I'm pessimistic, simply realistic. See Israel south korea. get general sentiment, single plasma recovered patient seems like actual treatment virus , wouldn‚Äôt make sense test hiv clear use plasma? Like make exception pooling blood together rule? 
I don‚Äôt know answer see sides. Lots people fit categories. March 2019? What? lag deaths one thing increase would expected next week two new treatment options available. second thing lot new cases reported much younger demographic minute demographic different death rate compared older people. problem increase controlled, stay demographic spread whole community eventually enough cases community.

The recent scientific evidence shows ZERO effect protests COVID transmission net increase social distancing overall - protests caused people stay home protesting.

The pregnant women fewer symptoms equivalent death rates, differed ‚Äúrisk‚Äù extra medical attention considered necessary COVID treatment non-pregnant cases. would caution anyone hasn‚Äôt actually pregnant US assumption standard care pregnant women non-pregnant ones (or anyone else)‚Äîand thus inferring actual disease state external signals like hospitalization even mechanical ventilation. It‚Äôs purely political. Unfortunately it‚Äôs truth. shouldn‚Äôt president charge says slow testing re-election look good. that‚Äôs Country right now. Happy cake day!

For first three graphs deselect 'tot en met gisteren' see new data person tested positive/ hospitalized/ died.

&amp;nbsp;

As today 60 (-2) (updated 26-06 13:59) patients ICU. patients confirmed suspected Covid-19. total 2925 Covid-19 patients ICU since pandemic began. [Source lastly, Covid-19 dashboard published state collects important data one place. [find miracle admit wrong first step forward 100% public mask use across country.

Doubt great governor (Andy Beshear) asked citizens right thing protect others. daily reports months people watched called attention every person died asked us light houses green lights remember them. medical, human services UI people talk regularly. Took complete responsibility mistakes. Showed feelings got overwhelming. Asked us travel states. goes on. Stop reproducing early! first thought cynical ""another repost karma?""

You 100% correct, though. everyone mall ninja without judgment. Propaganda powerful tool! lot people don‚Äôt know Hitler legally voted in. didn‚Äôt take Germany. Learn read.   spike far NYC, Philly, Boston, despite huge protests. So, logically, seems like something else must main cause spikes outside northeast. spikes protests would likely happen consistently happen. NYC already 25% infection. Probably higher among young healthy people likely protest general. 

I wander that's factor. Oh yes many young people dying covid-19.

More people antibodies means herd immunity. 

The thing make people worry actual hospitalizations. best friends two children got covered best got sniffles.

Have paying attention science data? looking Sensational articles tell end world coming?

75% covered deaths people 65 years old. need tell though go look up. Young people dying. channel tuning to? Must CNN likely right. Masks properly worn face chin common sense distancing. That's much ask many individuals muh fReeDoM! find odd know single person 1:75 people state. see 150 people day dispensary nobody it. saying real, obviously, odd. surprising none us work gotten it, even mask requirements. Indiana less half deaths Sweden has.

Cool story, bro. Yup, lockdowns delayed spread, killed economy. makes sense go numbers have, cases confirmed tests. Using hypothetical number based assumption people probably far less useful nature going far less accurate.

But yeah, herd immunity sound good I'm sorry subjective numbers hurt feelings. It‚Äôs insane parts country mandated masks. Washington tried warn us! Obviously know stuff requires that, literally everything. maybe people's education pause finish person training save lives, ya know nurses care about. That's funny, New Zealand one places American always wanted live instead. Stay lucky, buddy. It‚Äôs website collects official data puts graphs, data sourced bottom right, must incredibly stressful seeing homeless.

Here, peak pandemic 30 300 available ICU beds province full.

Nope, bad math stupid. well. Come on. Care elaborate? wait. 4th July, Labor Day, Veteran‚Äôs Day, Halloween, Thanksgiving (but especially Black Friday). People going risk lives carry traditions.  Thank working times, must pretty terrible coworkers. agree little preparation, can't wear masks about? seems foolish something easy comes great benefit. Actually blaming country virus plain stupid, never would blame china virus originated there, well would blame US 1918 flu. virus regularily occurring natural phenomenon battle stopping develop. Florida? Lul news big medical center?  Thinking forward now...How heck going get this!? pandemic especially divisiveness! divided! Anything one side says attack other... remember 4 months ago thought coronavirus going magically disappear warmer weather rip :( assume US Iranian government got much new shit deal simple forgot situation. maybe Corona prevented war.... crazy times. problem theses spike started substantial protests happened AZ, right 10 days post throwing doors open Memorial Day weekend. 

There also contrasting evidence Minnesota NY indicating protests little impact contributing spread. classes person university still set meet. People going die.  Wouldn‚Äôt mean far less deadly Laughs Canadian CERB, hey downside even though well economy re-opening, one wants go back work fine home collecting $2k. Atleast Americans eager work, even recklessly unsafely. Rights freedoms absolute. cannot take gun, walk neighborhood shooting wildly air yelling ‚Äúyee-haw‚Äù you?

By logic able nobody prove going hit kill anyone it, right? possible allow cannot prove beforehand actually harm someone. can‚Äôt absolute certainty, apparently infringing rights freedoms allow this. 

Oh well, guess wait actually shoot someone scenario prove hurt others forbid it.

Except case COVID could shooting bullets hitting people right left one ever know never really ever able prove may killed someone. Lucky you, enjoy freedom enjoy right slightly less uncomfortable. Kids grade 2 even required wear masks lol

Kids age like walking disease spreaders, walking around licking bus windows, washing hands poopy touching everything. 

If look every country actually recovering actually lockdown vs USA best voluntary quarantine lol Thank you! Lamo, picture Trump background? blame protests. Jokes though. Black people likely die it, die new increase...due protesting...you keep blaming Trump. Never look real problem is. Still voting Trump. 15/50 statement ""funny"", though. Enough people sufficiently mentally challenged believe glimmer hopium find covid based subreddit. best avoid disinformation. Remember Trump admin daily briefings still got lot wrong, least pretended give fuck? move China then, weld door shut
 Sounds right ally. MAGA snowflakes. would defend them? eligible exercise voting rights Germany def govt Aw, I'm sorry cold hard numbers hurt feelings. yup. divided....Anything side suggests oppression yourside. Yeah...we hosed. 28% available emergencies, that‚Äôs problem. late August / early September. Tell people NY. aren‚Äôt much better masks either.  Frankly spoken country live indications people might carrying virus already mid february, knew beginning march, two weeks least virus probably spread without even knowing it. Add mid february - mid march huge tourist season here. takes single person spread virus another country. really something stoppable unless know upfront testing etc.. place like many countries now. no, I'm saying someone says that, disallow think, ""well, not"" know doctor patient positive, acute care, still believe it. Florida sucks Nothing quite like pandemic response backed public health safety pure politics.... Look time line. Find key events put dates them.... Reopening, memorial day, protests, etc. add numbers, find many people participated one, including workers customers families three.

Then look graph cases area, find first peak first event, go together, find next peak, goes second event, etc.

Tldr reopening problems right now, protests problems coming later proportional magnitude crippled matter what. reopen soon, infections force things closed again. Except dead bodies permanently damaged citizens. Police enforce lmao History kind Sweden full extent comes out. Ironically economy likely suffer nearly badly everyone else due interconnected nature world economies atm Exactly! 28% capacity available emergencies interesting war also broadcast American homes everynight. see full ERs bodies leaving nursing homes every evening. Okay, nice day. Who‚Äôs snowflake now? bad, I‚Äôm sorry - thought ‚Äúas far‚Äù Denmark. 'leadership'  It‚Äôs perfect logic. 

There evidence X evidence X doesn‚Äôt happen. 

There existence airborne transmission. 

No existence human human transmission. 

Until was. They‚Äôre still today. told tested can‚Äôt find place get tested testing centers booked, wait times 5 hours. 28% available emergencies, that‚Äôs problem No, 60% much low.

Both Mayo Clinic Johns Hopkins say *at least* 70%. Never gonna happen. NBA resuming July 30. crimson states

Arizona 1 democratic senator almost certainly two coming election. Also, Biden 5% polls there. Arizona swing state, deep red. You‚Äôve got remember it‚Äôs confirmed cases. I‚Äôd imagine every confirmed case multiple cases aren‚Äôt confirmed. Well evidence virus survives cardboard, plastic, many surfaces periods time makes food packaging different? And, since said evidence, leads believe cannot confidently conclude. scientific wording ‚Äúwe haven‚Äôt seen tested enough yet.‚Äù trust, banner health pulmonologist reddit phds? statement relevant me.

Mask wearers absolutely minority even numbers spiral control. almost got actual fight grocery store yesterday non-mask wearer yesterday purposely trying keep distance. beginning, spread seemed localized big cities (Tampa, Miami, Orlando, etc), finally ICU beds. city refused twice far even bring mask mandate vote. chickens home roost soon I'm still stuck inside husband, help unemployment. 

Long story short, lead horse water can't make drink. Send (intelligent) help, please. got flak sections care gets flak from. made difference fundamentally xenophobic move. Stopping movement countries turned good choice *stopped clock right twice day* way. wonder many Karen‚Äôs protested lockdown outrage taking hospital beds? So... basically front line workers... Today's news: worst day since yesterday. True. context pandemic raging country. sparks covid particles dying. Unfortunately, since government mass testing joking slowing testing, assume everyone it. would suggest look countries faring coronavirus realize US comparable developing nations. embarrassing Ah, indeed. Asheville special. 

These next weeks worried triangle. We‚Äôve super safe months house, it‚Äôs getting harder maintain. don‚Äôt get big deal, feel like besides weather masks convenient. don‚Äôt wear makeup worry look idk, personally feel comfortable everywhere... I'm 100% wearing masks almost always wear one, hold courts? link added shows graphic giant spike deaths yesterday. Alt-right ""You're sheep believe scientists, doctors, statistics""

Also alt-right: ""This guy actively hawks promotes products lives dies advertising income really trustworthy"" Yes, protests!! governors re-opening parks, restaurants, etc people wearing masks go anymore... Neural net needs full mesh grid brain work Gates magic chip arm trick absurd thing. It‚Äôs almost like America saying ‚ÄúHold beer...‚Äù know that‚Äôs never good. aren‚Äôt blasting every radio TV like beginning? Oh yea! It‚Äôs election year...this pretty unsettling. states reopened quickly though, would've seen surges LONG states like Texas opened months. Personally, think masks saving grace here. hot south wear (for people) coincides w/ I've seen protest videos. However person wants try admit it, timeline rises matches perfectly w/ protesting. cannot explain states seeing massive increases not. least claimed going say protests lead surges b/c IMO, that's asinine. want fucking thing go away knew fact protests would hurt chances. good........ oh well. live Pensacola, FL confirm nobody really wearing masks here. everybody going daily lives like nothing going on. Maybe thinks revolutions civil war overthrowing governments better democracy. democracy he‚Äôs entitled opinion.... Hopefully copied every city across country. stop virus instead letting pick us inability put f-ing mask. know Texas, Florida pretty much open. think businesses told remain closed, bars restaurants open, limited reduced capacity (can't remember currently 50% 75%). 

Now, that's say that's *obeyed* well. reports least couple places fined/shut exceeding capacity, tell, places (at least area) packing like before. may actually worse aspects. least here, bars still closed management now, remaining ones jamming people make it.

Of course, also local county rules effect (masks places like Miami, Orlando, Tallahassee), think that's far state-level rules go. anything pneumonia deaths lower year since people isolating. Maybe stay home.  :) NYer, feel like everyone watching Italy prepared. whatever happened virus going away hot weather, hmmmm Trump? highest hottest states. joke.

Maybe 20% customers work wear masks practice social distancing. rest seem care well even though we, employees, wearing masks. frustrating. I'm young, healthy, want solve states pension crisis? Seems like I'd benefit mask. Thank youüòä scared, germaphobe, touch hypochondria, anxiety. work like 9 hours day, two thermometers, one oral forehead scan take temp several times day, get sick start isolate. nerve wracking, feel like ever going go away now.. bought house started can't stay home.. plan get roommates help payment, everything different now. wish best pregnancy, health! literally agreed terms week starting season... hard accept research? articulate single reason numbers ""subjective""? Come on, know critical thinking hard believe you! pulled calendar explain someone. Using local (to me) example:

The city Houston announced 6/23 944 new cases. stated tests conducted June 10 June 19. almost two week lag time results publicly broadcast.

However, testing infrastructure Houston required signups, mostly booked three days out, sometimes people need sign three days need stay 2 resets sign up.

It average takes five days symptoms manifest exposure.

So current spike Houston, looking back datapoint 6/23 - Let's assume test happened 6/12, fits range city announced. Let's assume person got tested 6/12 wanted get tested symptoms manifesting 6/5, given difficulty getting take test.

5 days symptoms shown put us way near memorial day. beginning spike either. spike Texas began apparent least week ago, likely earlier experts. squarely puts us Memorial day increased openings.

I hope god protests show increase - believe magically protected virtue cause, hope masks outdoor nature events enough. However, believe see better indications effects coming three weeks. revolution televised. Trump allow it. agree. elderly people enough sense partying. know I'm vulnerable, careful. got guy Sure

Two different quotes?

Foreign Minister Ann Linde's quote Dagens Nyheter:

- like that, course. order come here, must follow rules. get lot emails people Denmark come follow social distance move tables together restaurants everything possible.

Foreign Minister Ann Linde's quote according press officer:

- come here, follow rules. Nordic Minister Anna Hallberg received lot e-mails on, say people come Denmark on, follow social distance, move together tables restaurants everything possible - people really express feelings. hope gets instead someone love. Vote. Arizonan, I'm fairly cynical government's ability shut things down. Even asking people wear masks (now, currently, hospitals overwhelmed) generates furiously irrational response sizable percent population. first lockdown never really enforced, many loopholes funny. People follow it. Enacting \*real\* lockdown, kind need now, going happen. I'm making left right thing. leader free world mocking also show he's wearing masks himself, followers going either. take seriously, taken seriously. dense see cause effect.

You say personal responsibility, thing get N95/N99 mask going jackassess wearing mask can't find anywhere. That's rather self-centered way looking though. risk you, people spread get it.

And sure, say ""they staying home"", job requires work? low-risk shopping family elderly otherwise at-risk people home?

Your responsibilities extend caring community, yourself. ‚ÄúMaH fReEdOM!‚Äù Guess go die then.

PLEASE SEND STOOL SAMPLES TO

1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500 also cannot compare Houston NY Texas done horrendous job reopening maks regulations. Areas reopening wisely arent surges like areas reopened wisely havent regulated mask usage. would suggest surges due governors reopening idiotically protests yet. Hahahahahahahaha. guy really gold. Us lot said stop pretending stop virus spreads like wind. Could‚Äôve gotten months ago without crushing economy thereby costing millions people actually average age death lives livelihoods. tutored west lake/allandale etc while. Right on. explain mean say brain went haywire? That's scary! lasting effects?? Believe not, Chapel Hill + Carrboro, North Carolina. Yeah, south UNC big med school hospital here. Lots educated people, thankfully. find funny understand statement. completely hypothetical, never implied true. struggle understand simple sentences, maybe hold hitting reply button bit.  everyone wearing one fine. Masks effective person wearing infected one stops stuff leaving. everyone wears one even know carrier protecting others carrier 2 masks Serious question: likely reasons massive increase infections? Non-compliance quarantine countermeasures? Specific holidays? Opening economy soon? Spread disinformation? 

Any serious insight welcome. ECMO machines saturated? talk start dying 50 Spain‚Äôs. people think going happen. Reopening pointless someone gets send everyone testing go back work. Testing takes 5 - 10 business days told. often going happen? testing sped minimum hours we're screwed. study correct immunity around 3 months going extremely bad. Well makes sense. Back data suggested relatively low positives, positives %, total deaths vs states. new data shown otherwise, minds change. meant all. understand Georgia, opened first, first state - even one first states - see cases spike. still understand Wisconsin experiencing spike. take virus pretty damn seriously spread confuses me. Incorrect.

This depends country/state testing policy.

The test, lower becomes.

It also highly depends age structure population. Testing numbers went significantly, whereas positive % stayed 15%. Let's see testing numbers fall back yesterday, new normal. Florida! Middle Ages calling you. 

~and please burn 'witches'. libraries still open? live they‚Äôve closed since March Yeah maybe someone asymptomatic day still enough virus air got there. That's bad however happened though, hopefully get better soon! Yeah. declare business open doesn‚Äôt mean everyone go. cases deaths go up, smart even normal people shelter place. ‚ÄúI declare bankruptcy!‚Äù think complete jackass atleast admitting made wrong call admitting problem. also atleast taking steps correct problem. 

The can't said apprentice, seems deny even exists point. virus truly scary shit can't fit four extra seconds read sentence? Probably Russia‚Äôs active social media campaign Fox News propaganda turned lockdowns masks ‚Äúus versus them‚Äù issue rather issue public health el-stupidos eating they‚Äôre addicted rage anyone data deaths hospitalizations? I'd like see daily data that. question is: think difference US Europe? Early opening? masks? Huge gatherings?

Yes also TB vaccination schedule EU North America also purportedly noticeable effect. original point hospitals receive funding Covid diagnosis. That‚Äôs all

That‚Äôs original point was, that‚Äôs you‚Äôre arguing absolutely evidence support first original point. Stop lying spreading misinformation. goddamn decency. I've getting takeout usual support fave restaurants I'll damned voluntarily eat inside. think focus dog Colorado ride skateboard. Seems important silly virus thing. can't believe media even reporting something that's infecting 40k people/day.

Only 127,000 Americans died 4 months. really even worth mentioning? list always trot mistranslated Swedish quotes make say want to. people know least always loudest?

Go take stats course something. Who‚Äôs snowflake now?! Lol OK Karen. many reasons ""delay curve"" say. Treatment still developed outcomes improving, every month push makes less likely die it. COVID-19 floor that's separate that's full. We're point we're asked get creative. COVID elevator. COVID staff.

And keep separate patients hospital.

We small space different floor serving NON-COVID ICU cases that's also full. drop masculinity dude looks pretty fragile Resign Abbott apparently trending Twitter. selfish move again. compared flu, coronavirus death counts orders magnitude accurate

Nothing put bearing statement. one thing agree COVID (and flu matter) death sentence elderly underlying critical sicknesses. call cooking books whats happening people deaths door killed final straw infection ... narrative surrounding made sound ripping population like black plague.

It's not, representation nations failures properly protect elderly hospitalized. That's Italy looks like war zone (health care workers spread hospitals ripped populations) america looks pretty bad (everyone obese larger population rest us make absolute numbers look scary) abnd vast majority cases country old age homes brought long term care workers.

The point is, numbers accurate placed strategically create fear among average healthy adults effect crippling economies causing sorts unintended consequences (postponed surgeries death toll attached, suicides increase unemployment increase, increased domestic abuse etc) one seems care about, since every bad situation massive PR team screaming bloody murder.

So no, dying Corona, dying many things corona speeds process (with exception minority cases truly start stop covid) numbers correct (and doubt many care are) looks deathly flu x5, x100 like everyone concerned about.

Tuberculosis still killing lot people year, flu far behind corona either. sounds like NJ taking proper steps. Florida needs SOMETHING. Earlier week Biscayne hotdog joint 71st. 10 people wearing masks except couple out-of-towners. cashier told one order without mask complied. whole thing went zero emotion. impressed human race day. No, UK R 0.6 (and 0.4 London) immediately lockdown. lockdown eased, R risen around 0.85.

Note R *immediate* reflection preventative measures taking. slowly go time lockdown, changes immediately. (Our ability *measure* R less instantaneous, however).

Link Cambridge Nowcast estimates R time - see R immediately plummeted lockdown (blue line late March) brought populace followed lockdown much better expected beginning - think we'd well second lockdown, expect even worse US. cases government's wish ignore medical caution time goes helped compliance. I'm betting yes. lot states US following trajectory Texas, Arizona Florida. see Ohio magically turn case growth around. healthcare worker tell first hand, many travelers going back forth nyc home state. 

They reason traveling. matter spread. beneficial attack need job plenty people spreading virus benefit vacations, bars restaurants, gyms, etc e focused on. ones dragging all, healthcare overly exposed due lack PPE many hospitals slow testing employees. would ultimately blame employer, still personal responsibility need accept well.

It combination employer government's fault prepared. Still make right call health care workers. many idiot detractors cling run reason harass them, take precautions states kind open since may, again, many travelers worked went back home get haircuts waxes you. 

Yes, 2-3 weeks things started taking again. Exactly like science said would inability states uniform pandemic keeping thing spread uncontrollably.

Yep. solution correct lock down, testing, tracing, travel restrictions. That's point. March &amp; April, one Northeast using air conditioning huge spike cases. time, Florida using fine. we're late June Northeast definitely using AC cases declining Florida spiking.

AC nothing it. maybe worsens spread within building lot COVID aerosols already, social distance avoid indoor non-essential activities, risk low. going make memorial millions die save dollar?

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe instead presidents dollar put passed virus money. Meanwhile, South Carolina similarly dire straits, governor rolled initiative whereby participating restaurants indoor dining voluntarily participate program called 'Palmetto Priority' allows display window decal evidence taking certain precautions.... all.  1/20 still serious healthcare problem though. growth cases we're seeing TX, FL, CA able cope demand fatality rates shoot up, well excess deaths. Houston ICU hitting 100% probably final nail coffin, can‚Äôt really ignore anymore point People don‚Äôt understand without sports school, young people continue riot. I‚Äôd say sports could classified essential. Completely nonessential 

Eat home. noise made realized latest numbers graphs fit beginning exponential curve far well. I'm severely hoping true, know likely is.... Disney pays big bucks get want. Never comprehensive strategy recovery. US effectively implemented ‚Äúwing prayer‚Äù approach novel virus.  Flattening curve exactly this. think trying do? Respiratory viruses dont go away, go around 20 percent population beaten became immune. antibody testing kits aren‚Äôt 99.x% accurate, end lot false positives. tests still useful detecting negatives, less detecting positives. post history nothing sort, ridiculous

There's cool new thing lets us communicate people different countries think fact getting tourist summer. bad summers lately (average temp staying 20c) Nordic tourists flocking south, generally people tend stay around Baltic sea summer head south fall winter.
This summer already better most. mean point, state needs step stand Karen parents. 

I understand special needs kids can‚Äôt tolerate masks, that‚Äôs whole separate issue. parents idiotic, need dealt with. feel school administrators teachers deal bullshit normal school year. now, imagine what‚Äôs coming. Yeah know, I'm agreeing you. science onus scientists prove results directly contradict everything known makes sense.

Unfortunately, STEM research fields, data rarely reproduced either due poorly explained scientific methods due difficulty finding producing material needed testing. mean data credible without providing samples groups... either present data tell different story, include methods raw data wit publication, etc.

All article says COVID-19 detected sample March 2019... know scientists writing manuscript focusing solely method detecting diseases writing experiment led false positive (e.g., similarity different disease structural analysis), reporting source took study context sensationalize headline.

If scientists truly believe found COVID-19 samples March 2019 reproduced phenomenon, better damn good explanation it. burden following:

1. prove COVID-19 somehow exist time somehow managed spread anybody else show positive waste samples... can't explain false positive (window significance wide, similar disease, etc), and
2. provide detailed methodologies... said, somebody else happens upon samples, replicate experiment... flaws methodologies, would called peer review process.

(1) unlikely true, based everybody else knows. somehow explain (1) using firm data reasoning, (2) ensures technical methods analysis nothing either sample preparation, experiment, analysis would led results biased way. unheard learn something new COVID right respect timeline... scientists would extremely uphill battle get there. fear too. get fix leadership still incompetent make work. mean know need people willingly it. Yeah there's 330 million people enough vaccines everyone, even was, think 330mil us would take it? -_- mean 125k already died national disaster? rumor (and there‚Äôs lot rumor backstage pro wrestling world since companies tend carny hell), could 2 dozen employees infected - ring talent staff.

Presenter/interviewer Renee Young already confirmed positive test. That's progress, some.

Some viral genocide, I'm honest.

A genocide perpetrated Americans Oregon, white black people alike. White people trying hard make reparations something part of, thing actually would need stop doing. Black people thing white people do, white people, seem easier time calling everything else racist.

To me, someone outside minority myself, say ""America f**ked long time ago, simply love skin colour importance individual.""

Dr. King would rolled grave ton times, that.

EDIT: Oh, let's forget America still thinks Coronavirus ""flu-like virus"", could care less. So... insanity continues, stop. 

People dying virus? gives f**k?
A black man gets killed police officer? Protest, riot, injure, , block part city police cannot get in, call everything racist, make white people around world apologise white....and get sick. America simply needs America. 

Ever wonder Canada UK ever it? perfect, heaps better. Ever wonder New Zealand even got natives part culture? single American darss try that. So...now problems, white people take fall? nothing ever done. Another civil war offing, someone start would solution, reaction end America know it. majority media, 96%, conclude country regaining economic strength quickly ruining plandemic remove Trump office, new poll finds. numbers go trump rallies fault wish virus could learn play along make look like idiot.

- Also Ron even understand tax bands Ok What? There's numerous studies confirm effectiveness cloth masks, mention many disposable inner filter. city that? Correct, really understand spreads. That's I'm confused states like Georgia Wisconsin, opened far early far lax measures (if any), fared much better states stringent measures last couple months. states experiencing flare ups, kept thinking Georgia Wisconsin would leading way. Wisconsin currently fine, Georgia recently starting flash warning signs, whereas California, Florida, Arizona, Texas, Alabama started flareups ago.

I still want understand discrepancies would read anything recommend.  went doctor get tested (from car) said anyone showing symptoms travelled recently seen car instead coming inside, many asymptomatic people running around never sure. Can't answer simple question. Got it. u get highschool? majority Americans 56%. Press X doubt. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs control,‚Äù Jimenez, 61, said camped outside arena eve rally. ‚ÄúThe numbers fabricated. They‚Äôre real.‚Äù 

I... got nothing. simply response someone lives fantasy world. worse talking flat-earther least they're spreading deadly disease. MLS needs well. Hopefully, player unions speak up. mean long subreddit? Under-reporting comes every week here. really feel need validate common knowledge. Yeah, except deaths involving pneumonia influenza, excluding covid 77,440 since February. That's way normal. shit, captain obvious. current trends, probably close zero new cases US end remembered Elon Musk, genius captain industry made prediction way back March. I‚Äôm confused that‚Äôs narrative now. seeing 5-10 videos week doctors saying pushed OVER-report Covid deaths

Where see those? Every epidemiologist I‚Äôm aware explicitly clear undercounting deaths right now. don‚Äôt think understand what‚Äôs inherently wrong straw man argument. I‚Äôm sorry Fake news. time. sad enforce semblance sanity compassion around us. know, point lot people don‚Äôt understand that. honestly don‚Äôt need to. 

You don‚Äôt need good understanding exponential growth long understand it‚Äôs important (or forced government) wear mask stay home. Sweden go herd immunity lying it. Anyone thinks simply unable to, access to, want accept facts. Tegnell Giesecke admitted many well informed / non-brainwashed / non-deliberately-spreading-misinformation Swedes see it. writer excellent piece: Lol. Okay 

Let know many millions die lockdowns countries. I'll try give non-political answer here. non-American living US sometimes gives useful perspective exactly kind question people outside US. 

First, important note US President actually much less domestic authority non-Americans (or really many Americans) realize. Certainly less authority peers presidential systems. power, particularly natural disaster public health situations, rests Governors state. legally dubious, example, US president could make nationwide stay-at-home order nationwide wear-masks order. That's outside jurisdiction, though try set good example (sigh). 

Second, many state governments depend ongoing, broad-based economic activity funding. hard (for legal reasons) many states deficit spend, losing economic activity basically = losing state capacity health care, education, policing, everything else. states, like Florida, completely depend shops, restaurants, etc... staying open fund day-to-day operations state set revenue collection. Keeping economy closed basically means collapse govt capacity fight covid run basic operations. Opening state means costs fighting covid basic operations (e.g. like running schools sorts precautions) go up. actually pretty tough trade faced many Governors get enough acknowledgement here. states rainy day funds, sort exceptional situation. example, California's rainy day fund $17B one third total (just date) budget shortfall next year. (Edit) heart question. Operating assumption governors trying good job, tremendous pressure open economy state continue provide effective services. I'm sure governors better worse, even best ones faced situation. 

Third, mechanisms federal money flow states shore finances emergencies. Funding decisions like this, however, mostly jurisdiction Congress (not president). means House (lower chamber) Senate (upper chamber) agree fund, fund it, mechanism disbursing funds state. Right now, two chambers controlled opposite parties different worldviews, Congress really executing function effectively could. 

I hope helps! Americans mistake ""freedom"" ""anarchy"". think freedom living want. exponential growth. big part viral outbreaks dangerous.  don‚Äôt choice. whole lot assholes US would rather see everybody else suffer lives get better. entire demographic solely made people empathy don‚Äôt consider kin. NBA still planning play Florida? Seems like really bad idea...  late, sure who's idea require masks. Tbh havent fan Dr Merkel. today hope runs again. Look what's happening UK come lockdown. Crowded beaches, violence, unrest, potential summer riots. seems lockdowns many unintended consequences. course , #teamNJ Better yet owners management get house arrest pandemic over. Swift easy way stop There's point people it. Sadly, many places, point majority people know someone vented died masks designed protect people wearer. fit loosely, wearer still breathe unfiltered air sides. Even so, surgical masks provide benefit wearer well: Laboratory testing found surgical masks block 75% respiratory-droplet-size cloth masks, protection depends they're made well fit. right combination materials, create cloth mask offers protection wearer 30% 50% range more, says May Chu, epidemiologist Colorado School Public Health co-authored paper published June 2 Nano Letters filtration efficiency household mask materials. That's far full protection, combined social distancing hand-washing, says, certainly better RI pretty ok. mask use high though. Oh please. entire sub become political point.

Also TLOU2 bad? already does.... federal government spent 1.2 trillion healthcare. 

Medicare alone 600 billion  Bill Gates bad invests donates organizations working vaccines? even sub Absolute drama queens Sadly, they're probably still fine.

Probably biggest sin committed politicians recent memory, politicizing masks pandemic...which get innocent people killed. Disgusting. afraid wrong this. Everyone Chinese social media knows China Germany Italy ski rest Europe US. There's one group that's ignoring experts, crapping science, wallowing conspiracy theories. 

Describing ""partisan"" wrong, issue two sides equally valid. New poll question might well be, ""With regards Coronavirus, voting Trump Biden 2020 election?"" also kill kills elderly would die soon anyway. Worst Thanos ever  never got first wave. fantastic idea! Ah okay. yes, right that. US fucking much nearly everything nowadays getting bit old. Stop that, quotes disappear. SMH... quarantine never meant prevent people ever getting sick.  Catching practically inevitable. whole point purpose quarantine keep hospits getting run erwhelmed. served purpose. Time stop tanking economy. known for, mean aside prison main historical attraction. Okay wrong sry .....using tear gas housands people isnt dangerous all....everyone mask 24/7 ....police used children tear gas easily mask many hours. really thinking 50k people standing top safe? 

 Rename USA clownland point. Finland deep shit Sweden. laws cannot prevent citizens leaving entering country. Northern Sweden practically semi-Finnish region lot traffic border, like people going work, meeting families lovers, shopping.

Get fucking shit together, Svenssons. Thanks kind words! opposite disturbing Funny everyone looking China's numbers disdain, ""Ugh, would lie thing."" Yet, are.... Well, India beating people canes breaking social distancing rules? pls involve Canada :-( simplifying things much, amigo. Dictatorships often low prison populations immediately execute criminals political dissidents (sometimes organ harvesting schemes). Current headcount reflect beheading. 

A high incarceration rate definitely worrisome, take flip 180 assume low incarceration rate good. They're often equally bad. Always trust America right thing...after exhausted options first. right, Georgia open two months ago, took two months cases ramp start increasing. Reopening mean cases explode overnight, means virus opportunities spread amongst population. cases starting increase, expect deaths begin go along cases 2 - 3 weeks? Obviously might go much March April, positives coming younger people better hospital treatments, one would expect increase. bathrooms Tesla's factory often swastikas stall walls.

at first like ""this crazy"" (which is) thought man, see shit bathrooms time. assumed dumb ass edgy teens kids adults working auto factories :-/ Wow! Laugh rightfully angry. Come back America puts mostly non-whites lower education schools grade 4. That's Germany longest time. Judging reopen protestors, anti-mask activists....I think there‚Äôs surprising number people don‚Äôt trust medical scientists pandemic. ahh yess. let's pack hundreds people, body body, sky tube. could go wrong? people calling ethnic cleansing defending police's enacting racial violence.

Defunding police genocide. Uh that's complete lie. Florida deaths per 10M 1567 California 1470. that's even California looking actually accurately count cases Florida writing 400% increase 'pneumonia' fatalities nothing worth looking into. stupid people. joke. Always remember stupidity global. says clearly plan provide names contract tracing, either, he's likely hiding he's been, well. see boomers wearing mask public near me. Matt Gaetz masking back everyone else thought masks useless, really joke? hope still mask. give props ever. reopened everything, sciences point state ready reopening measures put place lax make impact. massive surge cases something us follows science saw coming. 

If comes time Texas 0 active cases despite him. American, I‚Äôm happy see we‚Äôre idiots planet. *snickers Floridian*

I mean cracks idk everyone expected would happen hahaha.

Gotta scrape knee learn lesson guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I sincerely hope governor crashes burns. I'll keeping eye next state local elections on. joke üôÑ indeed.

what's even concerning bill Maher saying shit going life like normal. (it new rules segment last week).

funny people need large crowds income (in case.. show comedy shows) Since TED talk couple years back. I, complete average Joe, could see reopening things bad would cause disastrous consequences, FUCK could governments Absolutely. Cases NY started going 2 weeks lockdown. Even Texas closed everything today, numbers keep skyrocketing. They're going hit 10K+ cases day easily. strange. wonder noticeable characteristic difference government NC governments southern states (besides LA)? Really? NY trending incredibly well steadily decreasing numbers reported cases, ignore that? Willful ignorance help right. Look damn numbers Darwin drivin' train...   economy parents pushing understanding it‚Äôs putting community danger . look deeper climate change. put depression corona response already. Yes. help? it‚Äôs 10x higher means death rate 1 percent.... closed Lots lies lie ahead. older coaches refrain participating, allowed.

They medical advisors access good doctors.

Much better average Walmart/Mcdonalds employee. actually said this... We‚Äôre US? Shocking, 3 months late. needs order full lockdown right now. Unfortunately, He's Abbott he'll order one he's forced too, 2 weeks state lost complete control virus. Wait videos people vent hoods coughing foamy pink phlegm hospital hallway come out. finally get people's attention. Meanwhile, assume country northern neighbour, seen 2 people wear mask since start (excluding tv/internet, live one big cities, live largest metropolitan area). Borders reopen next week? ;-) Maybe outdoors got tested beforehand, risk still tiny compared almost anything else. Idiots roam ages. Considering follow many places non-existent, makes sense shut again. Many bars city open full capacity supposed 25% getting checked despite bragging social media. Yes reopened soon, two-way street put trust businesses follow rules, many (most city) not. I'm glad stepped this. People blaming protests spikes, drive bars every day see packed masks worn. get many people going daily basis, staff likely gets overwhelmed, falls behind sanitizing protocols, got perfect storm community outbreak.  could kept way sweet tourist dollars.

The success dependent steps taking time, would expect things go well suddenly decide things differently? whole lot better non-convicts locked senior centers. Yeah people jobs get work home. There‚Äôs difference anticompetitive business practices literal exploitation unskilled labor. way NBA restart safely sad feeling people community love headlines. Would great students respected rules. America it‚Äôs team. encouraging people intentionally spread Coronavirus people disagree politically, *because* disagree politically, degenerate awful human going die global warming

Oh man we're going die global warming? Better spread coronavirus Trump rally even though people never anything me! concentration camps

Wow people entering country illegally got detained? Holy shit, next tell people break law jail. saint blaming Trump though, even though Obama administration ones created utilized camps first, pandemic control

The US ""do nothing"" either replying joke similar type joke.  area even though green alert usually majority people don‚Äôt wear masks anymore looks like reopening going well 56%?...Well problem. Covid tracking first part comment true, likely due R0 currently 1 US. 

The second part wrong. proportion confirmed positive die way, 10% US expanded testing considerably- 637k tests yesterday, compared 150k tests previous peak. Also, 80k per day prediction new confirmed cases week overall infections? first case, unlikely US probably able expand testing capacity quickly, second case new infections probably even higher lot mild asymptomatic SARS-COV-2 infections never tested. current 7-day rolling average deaths 609, 7-day average cases 3 weeks ago 22,600. gives 2.7% CFR, testing improved since then, meaning mild cases found, yielding even lower CFR.

One state facilities CNA employees running sewing machines night making cloth masks - like wtf Pennsylvania Gov Wolfe. mask protects better mask, come fuck on, admin saying cloth good N95 spend time covid patients change mind real fast. 

There plenty us worn, still wear trash bags gowns it‚Äôs better nothing. 

There‚Äôs equipment available- readily buy others, tell state it‚Äôs facilities can‚Äôt get any? It‚Äôs price increased 5 fold lives people saving lives aren‚Äôt worth money corporate money bags. Budgets blown don‚Äôt want spend another dime. 

Instead hang hero banners tell us drink nurses station. fuck right that. could give shit recognition, want best chance coming home families getting anyone else sick. 

Rant over, probably get deleted like past posts. Mods R gay, Stonks go up. places yes. Rumor N95 production stabilize next month, quote that. 

There definitely places US without proper PPE still. Look NY. There‚Äôs plenty evidence show reopen successfully. Reopening possible, follow science.

My hunch could tick flu season comes around (because vitamin deficit associated severe respiratory disease, think possible one reasons deaths falling, along better treatment testing catching asymptomatic cases, people Northern Hemisphere getting sunlight people Southern Hemisphere really accrued deficit yet). interesting follow.

But yes, good news. pandemic good thing, less bad thing appeared outset. one said ""small"", think tell outcome (the percentage deaths, rather unexpected result different percentages mechanical ventilation) 1.5 times ICU/ventilation number closer actual rate excess treatment hospitalization number several times calculated admittedly inaccurate numbers.  hear stories like this, think older friends who've trying kids.

Yeah. say ""only catastrophe make change"" optimistic. dick shit going make change. paint planes red. 20 million infections 0.5% cfr = 100k deaths. seems like correct number me. playing places testing good.

US Govt Euphemisms 500, Alex Nothing gets pence Imagine dumb, thinking you‚Äôre smart everyone else stupid sheep. people pliable easily duped. risking health health families people made political issue.  don‚Äôt think quite right. 0.375% sounds like quarter *overall* death rate. while, 1/3 *hospitalized* patients UK dying. Wait. basically saying 1 20 people underlying condition something would make higher risk severe Covid. people absolutely need understand serious is, like misleading headline. science data show many people actually require hospitalization.

*Unless someone wearing mask, save me!!!! üò≠ South Africa. sent grades back weeks ago July 6 idiots planning send kids back. highest daily increase per capita world yesterday government keeps opening virus explodes here. mean big picture? Well never said growth would stop, said daily counts would decline, R get 1 exactly happen. Also, disagree wont get R one show London study:

"" scenarios study looked at, routine face mask use 50% population reduced COVID-19 spread R less 1.0, flattening future disease waves allowing less stringent lockdowns. ""

 Oh, serious? thought making jab US lol Lockdown: necessary action prevent virus spread...

Mandate masks: violation personal rights.....

I live twilight zone.... I'm disappointed... leadership? 2019: forcing women certain countries certain religion cover faces oppression!

2020: everyone forced cover faces fits oppression sll! Also fun allowed, blood, sweat tears!! That‚Äôs low. higher previous peak Also remember chatter Florida pushing results today show declining next days going July 4th weekend.  could set up. Dang, good point!! Fasten seat belt Keep home possible. hope parents able keep children home keep home. make easier social distancing less children attend school. take one break school close down. rules become mandatory. good job guess? states still open anything implemented TODAY take weeks make dent... announcement come office Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), Halsey Beshears, secretary agency regulates Florida bars, made announcement via tweet. Beshears said on-premise alcohol consumption stop immediately, effectively moving state back earlier phase reopening. According state, Floridians 25-to-34 age range account largest percentage cases. median age new cases reported Friday 34. getting tested four days returning home regardless symptoms. Maybe push back days safe. Thanks info. Agreed. Early year knew little virus SARS-1 MERS (other zoonotic coronaviruses) compare thus 1 5 line realm possibilities back then. bad pandemic is, got lucky imo. Part may also people less severe symptoms may advised ride home worst outbreak keep beds open worst cases. advise.. please listen podcast commenting. 

I always thought standard least skim thing....NPR properties usually transcripts situation can't listen. proven wrong :/ 

I found relevant world trying date right now. I'm single woman lives 1,000 miles family origin. county relatively low infection rates. Apparently wanting wait indefinitely get meet people makes horrible selfish person. 

There lots things done make dating less risky. Location, timing, facetime first, ect. people still see risk on/off switch though. also misrepresented data order buoy support reopening May. GA government complicit absolute mess have. dunno. view middle class hysteria, bunch privileged people first time life face something cannot control. Suddenly realize life might screw even kill nothing it. solution hide away houses hobbies working class work pay vacation. Meanwhile hundreds millions plunged extreme poverty, millions children go hungry workers world find job finally get one worse conditions worse salaries. Shame happen riots, looting, vandalism arson. Hey genius where's proof seafood market started pandemic? since heard seafood market. ran tests samples taken January 2018 December 2019 found presence virus genome one them, collected March 12, 2019.  levels SARS-CoV-2 low positive,‚Äù research leader Albert Bosch quoted saying university.  it‚Äôs one result, always want data, studies, samples confirm rule laboratory error methodological problem,‚Äù said.  potential false positive due virus‚Äô similarities respiratory infections.

Very small level detection (this threshold identified article) one day middle time frame. Yeah I've got money false positive theory falling, sudden stop end.  Oh, interesting. think heard something recently well.

But yeah, iirc, banks used charge money hold money. 

That changed though beautiful economic system wrecking world.

Thinking loud, agree people spending money improve infrastructure (and supports people home improvement projects, etc). think people forced go spend money unsafely consume needlessly. Basically, spending money meaningful want it. issue right likely meaningful (unless leadership around could direct properly) able infect reproduce rather efficient humans doubt lay low long. Healthy individuals immune systems usually attack foreign organism, especially never met (sometimes even goes overboard, main reason covid patients die although seen healthy). Maybe missed mutated became aggressive, question arises, heck missed long? must people unexplained deaths autopsy would reveal novel virus... story around virus becoming weirder minute MLB basically you‚Äôre saying doesn‚Äôt work. Since COVID-19 really attacking older generation yeah I‚Äôd say back drawing board Couple extra hundred thousand people need die. 

While agree statement behind protests everything, amount people them, basically eachother, wearing masks, basically ""over covid craze"" definitely one biggest reasons cases starting spike.

Now, know fucking disgusting cops be, protest, unfortunately realistically whole lot, worth potential hundreds thousands people die corona spread gatherings. Yeah, I‚Äôm starting think aggressive accounts saw 4-6 weeks back screaming reopen calling everyone ‚Äúdoooomers!!!‚Äù also bots wearing mask

what? Literally nobody wears mask America METH HEAD nation. insane saddens deeply.  honest, loath morons shame see good people. unemployment shitshow going get exponentially worse bar workers getting laid again. people aren‚Äôt sick aren‚Äôt going go get tested!!! Obviously testing comes available everyone rate testing go up. anyone know counted wife 9 cases 1? remember reading weeks ago emergency overflow hospital houston ""everybody"" thought boondoggle. are, hope overflow hospital convention center type space still up. reddit gotten low? See, I'm opposite. happiest looking person ever, &amp; I've practicing smiling eyes hate people knowing smiling them...

But love mask general makes harder people recognize try small talk public. Haha ""misunderstandings"", complete utter separation reality. There's 6 sentences page that's correct. rest sheer rambling garbage, entrenched attention queen there's amount discourse correct beliefs. Older folks know they're susceptible...younger folks led believe kills old folks...my Mom stayed home since 1st week March still going out...she wants live. Who's going who's getting sick. dig /r/covid19. Plenty stuff there. asked people, think Earth support 12 billion people, would say no. 

But God allowed depopulate! 26th June, Dergachev district Saratov oblast, Verkhazovka village closed quarantine. corresponding order signed chairman regional government Alexander Srelyukhin.  regime supposes following measures: ban entering exiting village; cancellation educational, show, entertainment, sport cultural events physical presence citizens; ban visiting religious organizations cultural facilities; restrictions work medical facilities; ban activity trade objects mass gatherings people; desinfection buildings constructions.  village required to: provide compliance self-isolation conditions, particular older 65 chronic conditions; compliance 
 COVID-19 prophylactic measures, including mandatory use people performing social services towards citizens risk groups, personal protection equipment (masks, gloves) treatment hands antiseptics. Moreover, trade organizations mandated provide compliance execution necessary measures, oriented towards interruption disease spread mechanism.  
  related news, 111 new patients detected Saratov Oblast according 26th June data, total 6003. Since start pandemic, 76 cases infection detected Dergachev district, 18 Verkhazovka. patients hospitalized, receive full measure aid. Preliminary data suggests flare-up caused presence infection's spreader funeral one village's residents.  perhaps economic hubs frequent international travel, brought virus places first. None taken. Personally wish could leave here. It‚Äôs almost like it‚Äôs purpose. Federal response push virus. want us dead, traitors White House.

That's bit hyperbolic. want us dead, care die long hurt reelection chances.

The president convinced path reelection showing economy growing back leadup election, pushed despite obvious consequences many deaths necessary. country full god damn idiots!!!  I‚Äôm American I‚Äôm sure, definitely agree country needs strong leadership ever. Biden underwhelming opponent we‚Äôre honest. üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è   understand , special needs students often much higher risk severe complications virus well. ‚ÄúTrust scientists social media‚Äù - reddit

‚ÄúOMG jokers don‚Äôt know they‚Äôre talking about‚Äù - reddit scientists disagree need one must push use drug that's proven harm good? everyone healed already developing world? Yeah, hospital system overloaded cause stay home order come back. Thank you! Anxiety covid definitely makes feel worse. don‚Äôt feel pain increasing additional symptom show yet. wanna 100% sure Australian here. 
Why things bad there, y'all supposed full lockdown, genuine question. Yeah, maybe haven‚Äôt seen while. mean percentage texts possitve. People use spend half hour hour Walmart. People usually spend half week week Disney. Covid takes time kill, symptoms worsen people deaths delayed new infections reported (I think) Minnesotan here. one time last week. One time 3 months non essential activity. masks restaurants workers. even went restaurant used restroom individuals even wash hands using restroom masks. None friends seem wearing masks. wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm losing friends now. friendships damaged refuse go don‚Äôt understand take offense take personally. social life gone tubes. 

I assume people individuals dispel virus least sense personal hygiene. Sweden R 1 since beginning may Lmfao. mean twll opening early bad idea?? 
Who would've thought!!!
If someone spoke said something. 


/s drive Prattville, north Montgomery saw packed parking lots customers going stores restaurants, without masks. high percentage people pre-existing conditions could get interesting bad way soon.

What find really interesting different rates mask usage depending area town in. areas see everyone wearing them, others nobody wearing one. live Michigan, among top three states highest cases. Strip clubs opened back people don‚Äôt wear masks. Yeah second wave coming.  Well I‚Äôm glad say wrong, still looking great  would show weakness there's snowballs chance. agree, would help much right now. mean, New Yorkers largely compliant mask wearing. actually locked took several measures flatten curve. protest spike here, yet. like style. bad, could thinking different thread anyway afraid people still listen care 14 day quarantine. know enforce this. Apparently person use honor system, joke. NJ shame progress states made going wiped imbeciles south. ""We totally control. It‚Äôs one person coming China control. It‚Äôs going fine."" difference people going Walmart people going school, Disney, parks? haven‚Äôt seen decrease people area. Even lock down. It‚Äôs going people tested. Oh boy makes realize there's going certain group people say ""the vaccine devil's juice!"" ""lies make us easier control!"" Autism SPD issue. Certain sensations painful us. meant lot orders Buymie found mask hurt me. think car roads today automatically signals steering wheel turned whatever direction

I think that's original poster complaining about. Tesla drivers using blinkers changing lanes. Honestly: open air chlorine splashing everything makes less issue.

Religious services however criminal negligence point. People crammed building. big true Agreed. wasn‚Äôt saying doctors get paid more. hospital incentivized federal funding different ways, exactly points out. basically reinforced already saying wrote way better lol doctor wrote note like that? ""This employee needs stay home until..."" rather saying can't wear mask due condition. 
My stance: Stay fuck home can't protect others. test 10 people, one positive. ok.

You test 100 people, example, find close 10 people. would make sense.

Instead Florida finding closer 30 40 people 100 person sample. 

Your infection rate outstripping testing rate. Gotta love writing general US audience spending half article explaining averages work. fair sub commenters gave better information CDC. 126k deaths would mean infections totaling 21 11 million assuming deaths currently infected (so likely estimation)

if add excess deaths, we'd ballpark 200k would mean infections around 32 16 million.

either way, there's hell long ways go thing. ‚ÄúAlaska loophole‚Äù incredibly dangerous. Gotta think California start rolling back bars Texas making move. agree. Like fixing leaking dam piece tape. Please preach Columbian high-horse countries leadership reflection people. think short term. industrial production still retail sales single digit percents. ahead everybody terms dealing virus. 
 
Even everybody goes tumbling hill, enemies tumble twice far, that's still net gain you. 
  
  Sorry, talking Alabama must've misread earlier comment. road trip 6 states move. Granted, stoped gas stations absolutely necessary, would say mask use runs around 8% population midwest states. Saw one woman coughing storm didnt even bother cover mouth. felt like zombie movie trying run everyone. Oh they're here. elderly coworker popped 'Testing honestly stupid. stop testing many people worry keeping economy getting kids back school come August.' anti-vax one crap Monday 'I hate masks I'm going incessantly say masks protect virus everyone around argue things like community measures. point trying argue member health department (who see reopening protocol two positive cases families disclose positives shut us down) try get wearing mask.'  called - I'm voicing opinion work... 

I parents students refusing get tested 'hoax perpetuated liberal news media'

I'm glad I'm back anxiety meds, they're keeping screaming.
Edit: missing word obese pre-existing condition. 20-30% people USA. puts dangerous group. roughly 25% USA get would 1 5 chance That's still rediculous number.

And *still* likely die heart disease point time. agree obscene 25% country suffering something almost entirely preventable *if followed common health guidelines*. Oh wait . . . 

You're talking people repeatedly willfully things potentially deadly, whose doctors doubt tell that. yet, think non-obese people make right choice. Look behavior people Florida, Texas, etc., tell people heed warning. 14% people still regularly smoke, another 17% smoke occasion, despite decades dire warnings. think much faith humans.  Talking disingenuous... didnt even read article completely invalidates whole title piece. fluff piece. Like crap site. Well 7 worst days new cases happened last two weeks Like not, police use discretion time, always whether agree law. could myriad factors play chose arrest somebody; think that's good thing. 

Would ok sheriff 19th Century morally slavery refused punish runaway slave? would want reform legislatively first? repeat then. Good luck.  "" Medical Examiner‚Äôs Office say name Norma Domingo-Ramirez -- Hispanic girl **with underlying conditions.** "" say goodbye friends families ""leaders

Ackchually I'm pretty sure ask happened cuz leaders using excuse stomp human rights mandated people able see families cuz ""muh safety"" -you got kinda backwards fren cured common cold developed AIDS vaccine, perhaps expectations high. 6 months nothing relation time takes cure disease. We've lied along... Sadly, goes NBA Season Damn late party. Denmark already opened up, bit earlier closing times bars gas stations. almost new cases Teachers today essentially powerless. student bad grade, parents ask teacher what‚Äôs wrong, student. mother (teacher) scared go back work even though students required wear masks, knows won‚Äôt allowed enforce it, likely get trouble. teaches high school can‚Äôt even ask student take headphones phone backpack without risking counselor (and administrator) hearing mean. Additionally, report kid using drugs document change behavior (meaning started time i. class, since teaches juniors seniors, it‚Äôs often). also allowed report kids cutting, even blatantly admit missed 70 min class bc went Panera lunch. Enforcing mask impossible, student ‚Äòforgets‚Äô mask, probably anything do. mean could easily lab error, world random redditor qualifies immediately claim it‚Äôs lab error They're 13.5% positivity rate today. pretty high -- admittedly high they've past, still high. It‚Äôs exhausting air you‚Äôre breathing probably polluted. Another politicized issue. See: Pearl Harbor Track hospitalizations - also still lag time increased cases hospitalizations.

Edit: Also - starkest example, Florida, actually slowed testing almost 10 percent, week week, seeing 65 percent jump cases time span. Florida‚Äôs rising cases, conclude, nothing expanded think need look proper definition genocide.

It‚Äôs kill large number people, specifically due ethnic background. 

Relatively speaking, 90% group large number overall group. would genocide. 

Obviously hard part prove, intent it. Yes know are, people ICU reasons might fragile moving patients potential deteriorate reasons could moved, end one part system stretched rest compensate bigger area that's stress worse everything around it

Some areas going big. example Houston hospitals get full small towns around send patients normally go Houston? ones actually hospitals? Money issue us right now, we‚Äôre roommates. mean thats good...right?

ICU capacity still around 90%, keeping ED beds empty.

Inpatient bed usage though, climbing 86%. I'm sure stretched nurses physicians right now. Arizona still elective procedures? so, still room create beds chucking every elective patient scheduled. Collateral damage unfortunately.

If hold stat like now, good could handle this. problem starts happen everything reaches capacity.

If everyone comes covid time needs resources, bed oxygen mask/tube, run oxygen bottles breathing stuff fast. nurses physicians ICU care buying petunias guys clearly don‚Äôt need things getting.

You making lot judgments there. know people see planting maintaining garden would help someone's mental health. Further, surprised people looking going ""you need fix sink."" you? locked earlier smarter they'd actually able reopening without crazy hotspots. countries states opening without insane exponential growth vaccine. Texas Florida fucked royally mean option had. see Texas shutting again? Turns serve purpose people actually it, result, resolve problem we're likely going shut again.  Too*

Because internet logic says entire argument invalid miss single don‚Äôt want think massive loss life misery coming. death numbers unbelievable, would funny sad. evil ones feeling they're gonna delay that, like Disneyland. agree completely. filed 2 months ago gotten nada. never ending daycare bill put bad spot. either things happened would ok weather auto troubles. really leveraged either. savings taken hit prior since aggressively trying pay student loans, luckily deferred present. Overall, bad spot in, exactly unemployment written law. ICU usage? Man better economic assistance go this. closed bar voluntarily thinking could
Open mid July. won‚Äôt make past July. sucks bad. entire life‚Äôs work, literally since 21 evaporating front me. Fuck know many Delawareans expected us move phase¬†three¬†of economic reopening Monday, June 29 ‚Äì hope, well,"" Carney said.¬†""But delaying decision get better handle what‚Äôs going Delaware around country there's widespread confusion this. got yelled someone blocks away wearing mask walking dog. single-family residential neighborhood , yelled karen inside house. person outside block. that's science works - there's risk transmission alone. i'll wear mask inside stores outdoor places might crowd (like protest).

meanwhile, got karens refusing wear masks inside stores yelling manager they're allowed inside. German govt give free help implementation.

Play ball, man. Butte, PhD, associate professor department microbiology, immunology, molecular genetics University California, Los Angeles, tells Health within public setting, like restaurant, workplace, gym, air conditioning might **potentially risky.**

There nothing certain professor said. Everything pure theory.

The fact attempted use Diamond Princess event refute scientists article, fact concluded scientists' findings align posted article. think virus going disappear? people still bothering folks? No, dear, Barcelona Spain. Barcelona's Univeristy tested this. Also, France spotted dating back October 2019

They need research more, also need accept facts might contradict think brainwashed chinese eat everything coming PCC. virus care politics, biology.

If accept reinforces partiality, really care research factuality. Let's stop shipping blaming know everything Misleading
Most backdated Fuck purity tests, jfc Again, exact numbers hard find since nobody reporting number, appears TMC accounts 80% ICU beds Houston. that's case, Houston area seriously lacking ICU beds.

Particularly considering (1) covid patients making less 20% census (2) said they're also serving even beyond Houston metro, 7mil number low.

I'm sure they're state art hospitals providing absolute best care possible. change fact reason they're running ICU beds enough proportion population serve.

The fact ICU stays reasons covid across country yet TMC still 80% capacity patients speaks directly issue. would mean they're likely around 90% capacity regularly flirting entirely close line even normal situation. likely, median age Florida test positives around 33 years old. Much lower hospitalization rate group. Thanks! will! narrative bro... He's old man porch yelling ""Kids days"" 126 thousand dead Americans \_so\_far\_, number new cases continues rise.  concerned ""fear mongering"".  Riiiight,. Wait, also abortion? that's number one cause death USA look Texas today not? tried it. they're shutting back again. bother. Even though timeline matches perfectly (A full month daily protests), there's active campaign shut connection. Articles coming place ""confirming"" protests contribute increases.

I‚Äôm also Southern California, 20% people grocery store wearing masks. ridiculous.

I‚Äôm upper-middle class, somewhat conservative city. Financial package who? Hospitals get budgets central authority, get paid insurance companies people treat. Hospitals places high covid rates profitable elective surgeries anymore often lay staff directly support covid patients.

I think financial incentives work way think do. Every government lying covid cases reality tv made cool New study shows 44% Americans brain. RemindMe! 30 days. Lol! WOW. choice whether participate pandemic! I‚Äôm hoping bit government intervention, especially school year begins. hands approach keeps putting really awkward social situations. I‚Äôd rather feel awkward pressured something I‚Äôm uncomfortable He's joking one gives fuck random person see throughout day

I wholeheartedly agree. understand people would put fictitious target back. overstimulated divide starting infiltrate people's imagination. articles months old. reinfection concerns found issues tests, still react positive dead virus material may left nasal passages, can't differentiate live dead virus genetic material.

The June article woman Texas interesting, I'm curious see ended happening. Even true re-infection, that'd one case 10 million confirmed cased. re-infection rate 1 10 million something really concerned about. There's always rare flukes, people catch chicken pox twice, example Sad Florida noises someone who‚Äôs staying three months. 
My three months turned 12. So, see many UK people turned selfish fuck tards packing beaches leaving tons rubbish everywhere.. Seriously, hot sunny days?! ... Makes proud human being... Expect relaxing lock cancelled soon now.. ~~completely silly~~ *ironic* people pushing reopening wearing masks, it‚Äôs likely thing facilitate degree normalcy business operations.

FTFY, amigo. that's ""everyone get eventually, wait"" argument bull, even without vaccine, treatments get better experience. Reddit Pundits!! **F E N H E C U R V E** Well guess what, get close reason! governors followed science instead politics, people would alive. that‚Äôs okay them, they‚Äôll brush ‚Äúwhoops,‚Äù best could information Trump gave us... Google sensitivity vs. specificity. metric use judge test results. 
 
The antibody tests high sensitivity, low specificity. antibodies, test almost definitely going find SENSITIVE. However, antibodies detects might SPECIFIC SARS-CoV-2, might accidently detecting one 4 Coronaviruses (that simple head colds). antibody testing likely false positives false negatives. 

The PCR tests tend false negatives, considered low sensitivity (due specimen collection case) high specificity. come positive, accidently picking coronavirus like antibody tests, specific SARS-CoV-2. come negative, might false negative, sensitive (the swab always pick virus if, example, virus infecting cells lungs). deaths corona != deaths corona

&amp;#x200B;

deaths corona =80k

&amp;#x200B;

flu 2018 (in 4 months) killed 61k-85k 

&amp;#x200B;

no big dealio boss..

&amp;#x200B;

how many people know died? 0 know comment responding tongue-in-cheek, ""producers"" WWE (also known (road) agents) people help put together matches finishes wrestlers, predominantly retired wrestlers themselves. case, yes, ""tough stuff"" way wrestlers are.

You liken ex-players go coaches, may best players, best mind/IQ sport. Ohhh rip protesters. Makes feel little helpless citizen, hope things somehow turn around fear get worse gets better states ""Reopen"" means mask, reeeeee  ^^/s consider 1out five something I'll act like want it. Like car accidents


I drive safely. Reasonably. sure point is...like arguing for. We're saying thing. Who? democratically elected president, American American ever grace America, Ronald Drump. northern states run either heat AC basically year round. handful nice weeks use either. Masks enough. Argentina masks required yet cases still go up. Refusing take side thing siding oppressor. Neutrality ignorance complicity comes violence corruption hands police people color. ‚ÄòStays relatively same‚Äô you‚Äôre basing purely sweden? absolutely without doubt, lockdown greatly increased US unemployment. mean take retail alone.

The harm claim guess. haven‚Äôt it‚Äôs uncertain whether case 

I‚Äôm even saying locking bad idea, say affect economy pure fiction Mortality rate NYC-adjacent NJ county near 6% 5%? lol Nah man flushing sound hear season going drain

No isn't. NBA expected happen. NBA cancel season unless things get hand comes players/coaches/staff getting infected COVID-19. What's funny NBA NBPA officially finalized plan resume 2019-2020 NBA season little comment lol *was* going well, people decided Phase 2 meant total re-opening. Churches open, day cares open, beaches getting no-masked crowds, entire Mask movement organized Tea Party. We're still better nearby states, long based I've seeing. Man.. y‚Äôall fucked Chubby, highly visible ninjas unite! teachers unions encouraging members vote virtual since don‚Äôt want forced classroom. hybrid model choice virtual 2 days week person can‚Äôt staff person without forcing teachers work despite claiming teachers would get choose virtual person. Yes do, cares? like live democracy. Democracy make assumption, balanced republic. Yes, especially blood vessel inflamation like Kawasaki. One major health issues getting Kawasakis kid lot damage blood vessels heart. That's true, testing 500k+ per day April I'm sure numbers would much higher. Problem is, back actually engaging good infection control practices. Nowadays even though people finally starting get picture far little, late. We're fuckity fucking fucked. Protesting racism important global pandemic many. That‚Äôs people good faith, explicitly disregard actions mass gathering criticizing others breaking social distancing.

Rules aren‚Äôt everybody, essentially. really unfair ask low paid workers endure possible verbal physical abuse. Like 65 year old mom going enforce gift shop works at?  It‚Äôll never canceled considered. season isn‚Äôt starting July 30th. knows things look then. conspiracy theory, nothing requiring ""virus-free"" declarations imported products.

The reason policy CDC found virus new-land salmon case board case board primarily cut imported salmon. start gofundme page them.

on bright side, get trillion dollar tax cut 2018, get trillion dollar bailout year, still half trillion dollars unaccounted stimulus package. fun hobby.  question whether start **recommending** people use mask using public transport continue recommending people simply use public transport. Demanding anything table. Sorry, wrong comment thread XD.

I made point comment replied to, so... sure looking for. Right election November. Peso know you, library ebooks ""borrowed"" website. hope also recruiting recently laid healthcare workers.  ???? Really dude ???? mean, guess I‚Äôm willing budge. doesn‚Äôt go store often isn‚Äôt even close contact people outside household. frustrating. agree. Saying shit like ""put 5 30 pound bags sand trunk one leaking kilometre"" Canadian Qu√©b√©cois saying shit like ""le parking"" ""c't'assez weird"".  actually cause problems one quirks Canada Brand Image thing. one person goes ICU NBA (staff trainers support staff), severely impact NBA's branding. Players, mathematically, fine. Looks like fucking speedrun. Jesus Yea would agree, anyway take care! sorry, ""4 times more"" actually 5*X.

No. Follow logic down.. ""3 times 4X""... 2 times 3X""? Really? 2 times twice. say Brand costs $1 Brand B 2 times much twice much.. think costs 3$? don't.

If say ""sales sold 4 times widgets quarter last"" last quarter X, quarter 4X. say sales sold 4 times less widgets ..."" 1/4X. Full stop. wrong.

Furthermore, going see flavors used regular. say 4 times higher, 4 times lower 4 fold increase, 4 fold decrease, exact thing. 

Less mean minus stated. Go check dictionary believe me. simply indicating value smaller. seem little stuck ""what multiplying"" question. case, times numerator. less, times denominator.

I realize almost certainly wasting time troll case native English speaker. Ok, so, yes seatbelts traffic lights stuff, even cars safe today, [your odds dying car crash 1 odds dying Covid are, now,[about 1 Obviously rate fluctuates based ages underlying health conditions, YOUNGER HEALTHY are, LESS risk TOTALLY CLEAR, take fucking seriously.

Closing border China January coincidence bought West Coast time racism led temporary reprieve. Real estate Florida get real cheap. Agree. say lot shitty science going on. Fair enough. They're going much controlled environment vast majority American public, honestly I'm perfectly fine it. good Christian guy. got downvoted yesterday politics sub suggesting polls poll analysis isn‚Äôt useful dozen reasons. Sample size, inconsistent analysis tinged agenda, point people‚Äôs gut check day get polling call shouldn‚Äôt guide policy. really speculation me, study, they're targeting two specific genetic segments PCR test. technically testing virus, testing chunks genetic material associated virus inferring presence virus that. possible they're getting hits similar genetic material unrelated SARS-CoV-2 virus. addition proposed alternate explanations. Personally, cross contamination seems likely me. Totally, nasty virus lot common SARS. know people 2003 Toronto lung function still diminished today. Scary stuff. simplest pooling strategy (uniform group size, overlapping, retest everyone group positive), positive rate 5% optimal group size 5 increases test capacity 130%. 

There complex strategies (conceptually logistically) offer 250% capacity increase.

So game changer also trivial PCB? Think it.. get one go hospital anything, you‚Äôd get one reason believe you‚Äôve exposed, feeling sick. truly random people folks either curious want responsible, paranoid it. It‚Äôs surprise percentages higher testing becomes accessible people begin responsible tested.

Unless I‚Äôm missing something, it‚Äôs really statistic needs shoved faces time. Hospitalizations capacity important; hopefully health systems used time create plans action. know local one U.S. leadership, it‚Äôs hard pull together response, **developing countries bearing brunt burden.‚Äù**


Lol yeah well developing counties said ""fuck nonsense"" slammed doors shut US. low risk equal zero risk lot people consider protest justice essential activity recreational event not? think many cases phase II/III trials conducted States.

Also, academics different disciplines saying future studies year 2020 need organized quarters. Bill Gates threw ton money behind Covid effort. idiot. 10 years ago BMI 35, started running. started running could still run nearly 25 min 5k even BMI 35. Back strength training big part life. shed quite bit past decade. ""There exceptions professional collegiate sports, swimming pools, water parks, museums, libraries, zoos rodeo equestrian events, remain open without approval local governments must operate 50% occupancy."" genius ideas ""it's flu"" crowd nice recipe violent justified uprising got there, pal... Quite people know went couple weeks ago, I'm waiting see turned out. We're high Fulton, Florida exploded. pick Kroger today watched families seniors go without masks. Lone women ones consistently wore them, even though numbers doubled last week, still 1/3 masks. governor 'strongly encouraging' people wear them. Well yeah, example, someone anti vaccine, person mostly concerned well being. aren‚Äôt bad people that. 

I understand lot people make political thing (like everything). 

But honestly worried person shouldn‚Äôt demonized trusting vaccines, calling stupid right wing idiots adds bitterness fear. doesn‚Äôt help. 

People need understanding, help much social media reposts. Gates Foundation done lot good working people poor, contributions almost unmeasured. Check facts turn nose Uncle Bill. know news lately bad, diss people least trying make things better. actually busiest season. hot. ""Snowbird"" season roughly October - April.

Not say stay *pretty* busy summer - mostly due family vacations children school. Tourist season nearly year-round FL. September - October probably least busy. Kids back school hurricane season full swing. Calling people sheep conforming wearing mask sheep like behavior. told something punishment enforced actually punishment.

Just hypocrisy ""just comply"" crowd. Mayors/governors need grow pair enforce. Police body cams, real easy use body cam footage prove mask disuse. Protestors asking cams used. Win, win. people unable admit mistakes. Yeah that's exponential growth works Best news. agree. hard.

Mandate universal masking, mostly allow reopening except cases masks untenable, bars, dine restaurants, swimming pools, gyms.

If everyone N95 everyone wore month, could squash bug. Except YOLO politics. someone help find info Cases vs Positive Tests? 

CDC states positive tests lead new cases, many people tested multiple times. However, cannot find data parsed anywhere. CovidTrackingProject doesn‚Äôt separate it, couldn‚Äôt find anywhere CDC (besides little bullet point), dashboards. pretty similar company's mindset regarding reopening, too. positive cases office know of? way bro, came China. It‚Äôs criminal it‚Äôs called Chinese Influenza 1918. mean needs evidence blame origins naturally occurring virus sneaks way around world, already know came China. Obviously. ü§™üòÇ good thing people work bars safety net get period uncertainty... articles like feeds ""its flu, lib conspiracy"" folks Unfortunately number cases doesn‚Äôt reflect size outbreak dependant testing.

Florida got 9k cases 70k tests, positivity rate 13%.

Lombardy peaked 3k new daily cases consicted 10k tests time, conducted 100k maybe would 15k daily cases knows?

We say NYC‚Äôs outbreak significantly worse this, 50% positivity rates matter testing number. 70k tests NYC early April would resulted near 30k cases. think Trump cares whether convention safe. Auto mod abolished.

Remember it‚Äôs Texas, last non elephant governor 95, Abbot crushed last Donkey 1m+ 2018.

Unless elephants choose another elephant 2022, Abbott won‚Äôt go away soon feel fine, I‚Äôm pretty sure symptoms allergies/our great Saharan dust cloud lol. came back infected area wanted make sure Y'all downvoting... obviously humor. comment pointing absurd mentality antimask. awful shows current administration botched plan protect citizens.

Interesting, [this interview](http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2020/06/stanford-scientists-contribute-to-who-mask-guidelines.html) Stanford scientist said blowing candle one foot away good thing means mask isn‚Äôt tightly woven knocks x% people may positive, good great Wonder many think""OTHER"" states need slow Don‚Äôt interact hick Bars restaurants doomed businesses. Refusing accept reality literally killing people. I've lost track what's allowed allowed NJ, near impossible remember everything phased reopening phases within phases. fly lot business say Lufthansa exactly (not testing tho).

I hope becomes new normal everywhere least pandemic lasts. Everything else absolutely irresponsible. Wrong. Thanks Please point comment said New York‚Äôs response flawless üôÑ whataboutism getting annoying. anything, Florida‚Äôs governor taken seriously seeing NY went through. good thing Florida changed report ICU bed capacity like 3 days ago. made way easier hide real data keep everyone divided false data. 
 
Florida show us virus really without restrictions. Dude, let countries w.o. Quarantine, big travel abroad, Arlanda almost empty. let people Sweden country fault country. 

I Swedish Mountain, dozens Dutch German campers, cars Latvia, Lithuania, Norwegian cars, Danish cars. week midsummer. get exported cases. camping area, people work Sweden. Rookie numbers. Come South Carolina 16% positive. ever came across someone spouting nonsense, think I'd physically mentally shut down. seems human nature lock forever late. chads spread already.

This guy goes shopping, visits pharmacy everyday stuff. Probably goes work.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* good point. I‚Äôll freely admit see clips like videos people wandering around acting like crisis, get triggered start drawing broad assumptions. Wear mask then. leave house phone keys remember bring mask too. Pretty impressive. Bangladesh shows way..instead moping feeling sorry . Ignore him/her. He/she ignorant. Elevators pretty low risk, take look call center case study -  even super-spreader got half workplace sick, one got infected sharing elevator. wear mask indoors distance much possible waiting area, fine. chances catching virus amount time elevator low, experts believe need extended contact (at least 10-15 min) risk infection become significant. Take care  least let individual cities mandate - right cities mandate businesses enforce rules, bullshit put them. teenagers feel sick? Oh agreed 100%. beginning, many measures come. least hope. faith US leadership sunk low immediately trying figure goal posts get moved chain. imagine increased testing goal post move dead next I'm guessing ""but number people dieing stable"" realize lagging indicator ""look average age people dieing"" deaths pile hospitals overflow I'm guessing move ""more people die stuff!"". think there's evil leader meeting plan stuff out? Hold beer. believe make record last one day. hope so. bet people dig heels time though. Thanks encouragement. Geez that‚Äôs awful. ever really saw watched Gandhi history high school. didn‚Äôt know received praise that. ? hope things improved massively since times. sad true.

Imagine outrage firefighters putting fire, group people ignoring putting gasoline, wood fire make worse. That's what's happening many States, Counties right now. sad. confusion nonessential vs essential business...the whole thing mess..what might essential someone nonessential people enforce way keep stores selling cigarettes liquor underage people. Steep fines businesses serve unmasked customers, 1-5k per violation. Cash strapped local governments send undercover ""customers"" stores fund-raising exercise. 

I guarantee business let anyone unmasked shop cost like that. achieves goal everyone masked indoor public spaces. thing lard cellar /r/redpill mods live? disagree. think many Americans, sides isle willful ignorance towards causing volatile political system. People eat radical derogatory media like candy bars addicted it. Google, Reddit, Facebook et.al. distributors drugs people feed on. ignoring stupidity know define stupidity. bullshit. indeed seem like virus. like kind mental inbreeding. Yes, this. This. shutting today cut spread (should never reopened extent anyway) could stay open watch hospitals start getting overwhelmed even idiots finally wake stop going bars restaurants close anyway lack business. True. really need political parties. really need ranked choice voting. people America, seem true?

Here Canada seems like 10% dwindling fast. Yeah really bad. need putting testing current hotspots less. Let go. Live life good behalf entire family. argued family members years stuff said fuck it, people coming around. control actions. rough comparison that's 2,700 people Tulsa Rally. Spoken like someone third grade understanding science.

Wearing mask fuck help wear incorrectly (which vast majority protestors do), importantly. Masks protect you. protect others you, infected. takes infected people without masks everyone vicinity danger.

And no, people denounce science wear masks fault, behaving way numbers going down. 100% caused protesters going kill thousands black people. I'm talking wearing masks someone linked support wearing mask. responded question, one study says asymptomatic transmission possible another goes that.

Seems like studies conflicting top one claiming asymptomatic transmission issue much larger sample size. wanted get clarity this.

I've hearing asymptomatic transmission possible link says otherwise. someone clear up? part still debate far ideal vs practical applications.

Think masks personal protection like condoms. laboratory testing, condoms offer well 99% protection. reality tell people double bag, use expired condoms, similar stuff time.

Does mask offer small amount protection user? Sure. Assuming fresh recently sterilized mask touching face lot.

That said, everyone wears mask, none us worry using perfectly.

This case ""you scratch back, i'll scratch yours"" end work together better off, zero sum game. lose anything helping neighbor, benefit.

But loud growing percentage population screaming ""YOU CAN'T MAKE SCRATCH BACK! I'M FREE AMERICAN CAN'T TELL DO! SCRATCING OTHER'S BACK SHARIA LAW!"" BLM matter aiming sights wrong goals wrong people want make lasting change. since sub doesn‚Äôt allow politics won‚Äôt go New York - 1,610 deaths per 1m

Kwiatkowski said inclined wear mask unless required ‚Äî unless, put it, ‚Äúan Uber driver feeling type way store makes wear it.‚Äù


Since lot people attitude, Corvid-19 keep getting control. sounds like lie. Florida change name Covida cuz wrap state. Sadüòî course yearn violence political dictators. 

You exactly like every single trump fan. Edit - means ICU cases 

don't mean BEDS? TONS ICU cases diverting.

Sucks. Next stop ugly wartime-style triage decisions assume would never made ""developed country"". 500 pop think city would swarm public areas cops collect. going similar March, except remember back comparing states Italy South Korea? time we'll comparing Florida. really want state compared Florida? That's thought. Wear mask. Right lol like hope worth saying goodbye forever grandpa Zoom Yes yes, last two questions. corruption Senate covers crimes. Fight pow Mao, comrade! I'd bet theres lot less masks lot tighter grouping among drunk tubers sober voters. flew twice week German Lufthansa Europe, spare middle seat place 2 people per 3 seat row.

Also masks mandatory throughout whole time board hand hand sanitizer wipes. I‚Äôm scared numbers 4th July celebrations. fuck.......... Consider this:
1. many people (per capita) visit Belarus tourism business compared Italy, Spain, France, UK USA? ;
2. transparency political system Belarus compared countries Europe Americas willingness communicate even know real number Covid-19 cases deaths caused it. ""Deaths down!""

Aight then. Check back week. I‚Äôm still wondering thing haha obviously due failure leadership federal level. really hope come November, sweep responsible failure try new direction. ....we‚Äôre talking employment, either. We‚Äôre discussing ADA reasonable accommodations you‚Äôre disabled unable wear mask store/other public place (ie: autism you‚Äôll rip mask anyway sensory issues, use mouth propel wheelchair can‚Äôt wear mask). using service dogs example case law around face masks (yet).

You don‚Äôt need show store owner proof disability ask provide reasonable accommodation. Sure, person wheelchair obviously noticeable disability, person autism doesn‚Äôt store owner cannot make show proof. question isn‚Äôt picture behind chart protests? Thousands people standing street together like idiots (I‚Äôm talking protests here...people don‚Äôt want wear mask blm) big hospital? LOL. $999,999 month conspiracy. Science always takes longer expect it. We're getting information light speed compared long normally takes. information evolves, methods use combat COVID-19. want press conference. going convince idiots ""under control"" going away &amp; use 'president's' word stop wearing masks &amp; worry social distancing going out. I'd rather press conference White House Fauci &amp; medical experts. 

For say great idiots die wearing masks, I'm going say again: MASKS PROTECT OTHERS, PERSON WEARING MASK! good others wear masks putting health risk theirs! I'm confused. thought open revolt police.  virus spreads fast small badly ventilated rooms.

The protestors protesting 3 weeks straight, mushed together. Screaming chanting

A Trump rally one time thing that's soo bad? Make decision, bad none is. redditors hypocrites? People able say ""We're New York, can't happen here"" became impossible deny reality. pollsters must‚Äôve hit county NW Georgia. everybody going usual routine. We‚Äôve lost almost friends nonsense. people know don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs big deal. keep they‚Äôll lose lot respect friendship. record: I‚Äôm typically Conservative I‚Äôm voting creamsicle November. Even 13% positive rate, pool batches 5, half batches clear. conserve 30% reagents comparrd individual tests. That's efficient would lower positive rate, still pretty good. chance would consider states updates every month? I've looking type comparison. Looking total deaths less helpful since car accident deaths, etc reduced. fail intuituve basic numeracy much time, chance get familiar exponentials. expecting harsh Abilene heat sunlight kill all? fairness lived life debilitating stomach intestinal issues, eating keto completely cured them. either stick diet get sick dog. kind easy willpower options haha. wow, that's amazing amount monster adjectives used story. halloween themed research article. transformation  tentacles  zombie cells  viral venom  another zombie

Any real scientists care shed light hoooooorrrrrifying story? hundreds samples one contaminated, don‚Äôt think possibility high. Yeah, well, think we're gonna agree disagree. It'd nice one could ask r/AmItheAsshole hypotheticals I'm sure people would think asshole situation COVID infected person who's quarantining themselves. 

You're entitled odd opinion opposite true, guess,but victory really, really clear responsible person COVID sufferer putting others danger. much easier figure something's located city county name, it? Wisconsin, get shit like town Menomonie located Dunn County even though county called Menomonee located 200 miles away it. They're named Native American tribe they're spelled differently get confused... üçª Nailed it! üçª According worldometers, #74 'cases per capita' ranking. US #12. He's womanly either. pawn us. greed got America rich powerful greed trying make buck sick leaving disadvantaged die. Abbott already committed Texas disastrous consequences. Restrictions today help bad end July going get hell lot worse gets better.

These restrictions going get R value 1. Wasn‚Äôt India gave everyone 1-3 hours get home isolate day lockdown? Alright, virus kills everyone year infection. ^/s admit hard time considering honest question. Consistent messaging. Federal guidelines states instead abdicating leadership position. Maintaining national stockpile emergency medical equipment. Keeping pandemic response team. Using pandemic response playbook. Telling people use masks instead injecting bleach. Whatever fuck happened drug bought hoping would work without proof. Using test instead making own. 

I see setting dismiss things like lack testing supplies, your‚Äôe right take time get set could started much, much earlier just... weren‚Äôt. also dispute idea they‚Äôve addressed especially given recent news administration cutting funding testing president joking says wants slow testing. forget high unemployment nation ties healthcare job! jesus christ Thank you, self stick stamps. I'm germphobic (ironic) hate licking envelopes vintage stamps. know offtopic.. guess.. think CDC call 'All Clear'.. year Vaccine MAYBE.. 2 years eradicate it? 5? fair, brought whole Europe mess. Chinese visiting Italy, Singaporeans vacationing Ischgl, handing Germs least Germans Britons French(wo)men Swedes Danes Norwegians distribution across continent. sure whether Spaniards Italians contracted Ischgl well, heard mostly spread Champions League match Atalanta - Valencia? got email full flight wanted volunteers take flight voucher. straight cancelled refund. incredible went exact situation Spanish Flu 1918 yet majority public blas√© it.

It's nuts much expertise country widely ignored. masking wearing great either. 

Not mention got Bart police basically pulling Bart, guaranteeing lawless hellhole become. Pretending problems exist make better. struggling response coronavirus; struggling virus itself. response effort minimize suffering. Sabotage response wearing mask going drink, drag shit even further. See: Arizona, Texas, Florida.  Case count stat I'm longer interested in. hospitalizations deaths. signs point Texas near capacity healthcare system vast majority new cases low risk individuals (aka young people).

We see actual impact spike least couple weeks, CDC's recent report covid-19 death rate may much lower expected, reports EU survival rates hospitalized patients much better April, I'm ready hit panic button numbers.

As long keep insulating high risk members communities disease, may able continue reopening economy without causing spike hospitalizations deaths, everyone's goal point. Well, federal government anything it, that's sure. even get started Robertson screws then! Pro tip - never work restaurant unless willing perceptions restaurant cleanliness absolutely shattered. One time events amplify whatever population time. you‚Äôre area handful cases excellent testing contact tracing capacity, you‚Äôl ok large event. 

If regions already spiking large events? That‚Äôs pouring fuel fire. Los Angeles rural, near top charts. Yeah, that‚Äôs kind remember too. said wearing mask wouldn‚Äôt prevent getting (conveniently?) left part wearing mask prevents getting it.

That‚Äôs generally we‚Äôve always taught though- wear mask protection. times I‚Äôve seen worn public it‚Äôs hospitals flu season someone cough. think that‚Äôs also reason push back them- I‚Äôm sick, said could get touching mask/face, take risk? They‚Äôre conveniently forgetting pre/asymptomatic transmission that‚Äôs hard wrap head around don‚Äôt reason believe you‚Äôre sick. 

That said wear mask everywhere trust science it‚Äôs clearly working states mandated it.  Remember invaded 2 countries 3,000 dead Americans? remember... Florida reports day. hospital patients 20-50 it, disproportional younger people Bankers really care us.. didn‚Äôt tell you?

‚ÄúWe want money last long do!‚Äù

Oh I‚Äôm sorry that‚Äôs misprint 

‚ÄúWe want money!‚Äù &amp; ‚Äúwe want last long do!‚Äù disappointing aspect discussions around Covid. kill mean can't long term ramifications health finances. young healthy mean can't impact life.

I wish political leaders would talk more, counting deaths enough measure impact. Yeah thanks varies. opened back public Monday. want go? get it, Cuomo sent nursing homes. go? Hospitals ful I've started asking people saying big deal please put number exactly becomes big deal.

They seem want think way. literally never become big deal them. society completely collapses, they'll probably blame liberals, pandemic. Take tears grand-wizard, citizen.  Far little far late. 

Exposures today set minimum peak hospital use 4 weeks now. 5,112 cases Texas today.  serious note may retroactively determined unrelated cause death dead people reach number saying deliberately twisting / omitting facts drive home agenda? 

Why sound familiar? Great place lunch visiting nearby Rimini. Glad hear citizens well. Yeah ‚Äúdeep states‚Äù end goal enslave world making everyone wear surgical mask.

Fucking brain dead morons.

Let‚Äôs nuke Florida done it. flu though there's nothing worried about! /s Thank educating cultural nuances. million dead people got checks. surprise except LA half state's cases read Lil Jon‚Äôs voice. agree others here. think it‚Äôs time well. could‚Äôve easily said 2 year old. planning ‚ÄúTwo Sweet‚Äù 2nd birthday party didn‚Äôt wanna say 2 years old yet!! LOL. But. She‚Äôs 2 years old. LOL. state smirk? Sounds like touch geezer would say. title peak boomer... actually boomers America anti mask?  right here. Mandate office workers stay home. Give financial assistance. Instead ass everything money. Bruh, cut food stamps trump ""delayed"" due public pressure optics cutting safety net pandemic üòÇ 


You understand people may lost jobs ""lockdown"" various reasons? Unemployment zero covid hit. even point trying push? üòÇ 

Edit: add legal migrants worked paid taxes trouble getting benefits. Just...how narrow world view understand everyone great comfortable like you? nothing whether get virus not, symptoms are. Yeah sports gonna take season (or two) off. love sports waste resources. Plus, who's gonna say season's legit star player half team get playoffs? Like hitting brakes driving truck cliff me!! Hello again! Still think we‚Äôre going live this.  know. mean always viewed Florida Man crazy fuck general never traitor. feel now? ""The fire passed peak, go back inside, mind raging flames."" least 30% Californians live outside major metropolitan areas, much different flyover states, never trust liberal California government. 30% minority, 30% California roughly 12 million people (bigger 44 states).

In cities, allegedly cases people thought following lockdown correctly, realize dangers large private gatherings friends family. I! Really glad see area well, gobsmackingly baffled people lived country think serious thing.

I guess part racism, since affecting minorities much more, holy shit guys. Fucking wake up. imagine lot overlap them.  really bad, actually. possess knowledge have, even might have, COVID, sole fault locking door face. choice whether enter, fault make wrong around people's rooms inviting really bad

Especially person COVID, yes. fault sick, fault risking get sick. Again, per logic. 

This I've said argument effectively over, matter say, counter previously said.

(Edit: FYI, made ""Case 0 fault"" argument yet again, alleviating Sweden fault.) anxiously awaiting tweet Trump ordering Texas back open... know couple families really struggling, truly feel awful everyone going financial stress top everything else. know many boat. old ‚Äúsport court‚Äù sheltering place since March 2nd, come place. It‚Äôs frustrating Texas isn‚Äôt moving faster. day kills people/ good trick look copycat recipes ordering take follow recipe instructions. don‚Äôt know specific term means look watch YouTube video.
I‚Äôm sure also YouTube videos basic cooking skills.
My 7 year old knows cook things already. There's long incubation period (up 14 days), possible test positive survey study develop symptoms later on. free time work Biden save us virus :( Trump would shit happened term. Correct i'm wrong didnt ofxord say they'll results vaccine september follows mass production later months? Actions consequences Yes, supposed ready 2019. I‚Äôve read Spanish news too. one would write article related 2020, would newsworthy slightest. USA. NY still good.

The issue is, states pressured. horrible budgets even worse system place mass unemployment. Also, trump pressured certain states reopen increase reelection chance Every week it‚Äôs something else. longer believe anything damned virus Gather energy, everybody! Florida already started scale back testing working 9k tested positive Brazil: We're ravaged COVID19

Florida: Hold beer... ""Florida-man!!!!!!"" 5 U.S. states reporting record increases today: Florida (+8,942), Georgia (+1,900), South Carolina (+1,313), Tennessee (+1,410), Utah Charge right back them. pay bought using credit card using debit card RUN credit. went Mastercard Visa via PIN number, call card services, charges charged back due giving anything. Yup. I‚Äôve lived South Houston whole life. include links.

Leaked NHS study 3 days ago: years research SARS 1: papers Cov-SARS-2, indicate long term damage least 25-40% need tests data.

So far single case study shows full recovery infected. studies asymptomatic show significant amount still major life-long health complications. they‚Äôre *not* fine *my* point. estimates many 30% people get long lasting damage. don‚Äôt consider ‚Äúfine.‚Äù think honest small business owners wanted right thing entire business threatened. 

But suspect vocal crowd multi-multi millionaires leveraged asses want take 10 percent hit net worth shut 6 weeks.

Because interestingly enough - allocated 2 trillion dollars problem - could 6000 every man, woman child US. enough people stay inside weeks. 75 percent country still working anyway. 

If held 6 week ""lockdown"", worn masks way out, enough testing tracing, thing close over. Stick everyone outside summer really drive levels.  countries probably reach herd immunity big deal important portion population- I'm minimizing it. point hospitalization/death rate way inflated purposes selling news. Plenty service workers get yelled berated jobs keep way less money protection find really hard feel bad cops. following weeks.

then got busy work. florida post right away, got busy work.

im still picking jaw floor. show damn wholesome. also recommend Bob Ross Joy Painting self care. Yep. 

Even globally deaths plateaued since mid April despite nearly 2 x new daily cases There‚Äôs difference volunteering vaccine controlled trial getting untested vaccine live hotspot last resort stop virus spread. Don‚Äôt purposely dense I'm sorry hear that. know lot workers industry I'm sure reduced staff stay open. pivot take effective. everyone know tried support able ordering local owned spots. difficult wear mask, people? difference flu ... get herd immunity vaccination.

We get partial immunity prevalent strains using current strategy CV lock everyone start flu season. half population would starve first year crippled economy. Even death rate 0.5% lower, numbers calculated across population different countries would staggering

Europe population 740M. CV deaths 182k

North America population 530M. CV deaths 116k

Asia population 4.4B. CV deaths 39k

Countries malaria, small pox, TB endemic diseases found resistant CV built immunity. Lockdowns social distancing weaken immune system viruses. People spend time poles space station rebuild immunity return civilization. Astronauts space station outbreaks herpes even though they've never shown symptoms before.

Tuberculosis map (note areas purple vaccinate TB problems malaria). see ireland portugal light green far fewer deaths respective neighbors (UK Spain). 

http://www.bcgatlas.org/

Malaria Yeah using younger people escape goat even better.

Considering LVT 93% new cases, additional lockdown going around linha de Sintra, pretty clear main problem ilegal party Lagos, besides, party young people, many 30.

Surely there's danger ridding trains buses full max, yes people usually much option, blaming random party really telling full story.

 guess feel need blame someone, go, blame younger generations. IMO Americans would never follow anything..ever. stupid people. Screaming RIGHTSS GONEEEEE

This virus could 50% death rate WH would still call hoax chance side fence would care. 

We deserve virus sadly dumb people referencing [this none flairs seemed accurate. Changing position new evidence presented back tracking. literally science works. formulate theories make decisions best available data data changes theories decisions. Again, seem grasp role place plays Texas. literally performs heart surgeries place entire world. 

It's utterly massive. There's nothing like it, even places lot people US (like California) world. exactly...we‚Äôre likely never going meet influence other‚Äôs lives. either us sacrifice that? Also possible they're discharging people really sick, low chance death, right now, anticipation clusterfuck next 2 weeks.

""Really sick, unlikely die? Go suffer home."" likely status quo next weeks months. interesting.... honestly people way likely get infected Disney apple store. scream top lungs looking new iphone like Disney rides many Americans think gonna accept vaccine? 

Who cares more? I'll take it, kids take it, grandma take ruled safe elderly otherwise she'll stay indoors. NY ~25k deaths NJ ~13k. Yes. Money. political parties focused keeping stock values continue lining pockets. Human lives part expendable. Forget throwing us bone letting us stay home foot bill while. flu shot joke shit load people still die every year!!!!! You‚Äôve entirely misread wrote completely assume intentional gaslighting. stated removing sex would remove HIV. point isolating curb spread end it. Look countries properly side virus nearly hell lot less life lost. 

The HIV comparison weak. Sorry pointed you. looked like coming ignorance HIV.

Edit. time repeatedly respond clarify point double it. makes sense Trump coward. Hello.

I person 40 volunteered challenge trials occur.

Approximately 30k people 40 also volunteered. confirm. Actually it‚Äôs 100 here. still wearing masks. news reports anyone passing getting sick. even deserving lol end. article biased hell. tsunami! warned us beginning one first press conferences (I remember intensely listening): right thing always met criticism unnecessary, right thing means bad outcome manifest, misinterpreted evidence bad outcome never possible first place. reality, lack bad outcome mean WORKED.

e.g. fence stops man-eating tiger getting village, village idiot claim that, since he's never seen tiger village, tigers exist therefore wall waste money. frequently used example: jumped plane told pull parachute cord, otherwise we'll go fast die impact....and pulling cord look down, declare ""well i'm falling fast all, someone must lied me!""....and remove parachute. quote Churchill (supposedly): ""*Americans always trusted right thing, possibilities exhausted.‚Äù* difference publicly *owned* publicly *traded.* understandable mistake.

Publicly *owned* usually means business conducted extension state. Like USPS, BBC. company owned public entity, meaning company belongs everyone, like bridges freeways.

Publicly *traded* means company still *private company,* general public buy stocks. Think FedEx CNN. company owned private entity, like person another company. ‚Äúnever sort push it‚Äù meant last time shut almost entire world bc pandemic? also access sorts resources technology now? That‚Äôs meant. reasoning, sure making great argument defunding them. 120,000 Americans died ~~half~~ quarter year already still wake call.

There, fixed it. even worse agree. Las Vegas fucked. would guess NY first US massive Corona spike. point leadership accepted could get control. 

If noticed, late June, watched happened NY know better deal looks like Florida TX (the ones I've personally followed most) leadership denial heads asses. gone 'opening up' recklessly hoped would go away. done little nothing encourage mask usage. 

That's guess tho United States needs damn leader whole chain command trash. Wait, serious? Bullshit, Washington state Dept. Health epidemiologist stated unrelated deaths (car accidents, etc.) clearly counted COVID deaths unequivocally overstates actual count. maybe 2-3 weeks ago? Colorado recently revised COVID deaths well. Several states swathes inconsistent deaths due conflicting policies counting investigation well. revisions constantly pumped out.

""Actual statistics rock steady"" lmao So, following logic, deserve Trump administration's response virus? Little late trigger pal. river places opened here. Unsurprisingly, cases started sky-rocketing shortly thereafter tourist influx, frustrating rural area actually really well. mandates voluntary, even. Nextdoor mix ""save businesses"" ""shut down,"" even conservative area, skews favor ""shut down."" Sure, bunch people playing contact sports ""working out"" they're really hanging maskless friends shit. There're many variables grant exemptions, people find way misuse abuse them. want work out, home backyard. There's really good argument mandatory mask wearing, there's good reason grant people seatbelt exemptions even they're driving block. always tastes best! Yeah, sure. Mauritius shuts make US look bad. EU. SK. every country Turkmenistan. live Washington, say finally! I'm sure. Protests take place outdoors there's abundant fresh air sunlight. Protestors generally wear masks distance. virus little chance spread.

 probably happened places restaurants, bars, workplaces, healthcare facilities, gyms music events. Many clusters associated heavy breathing proximity others, people singing karaoke parties, cheering concert, chatting bar exercising gym.

 places indoors contained air spaces. full communally touched surfaces. surge infections coming from, non-expert opinion. USA. NY still good.

The issue is, states pressured. horrible budgets even worse system place mass unemployment. Also, trump pressured certain states reopen increase reelection chance Tomorrow another record high following another record high... blatantly lied people trust. see, Florida 123K cases now, population 21.4M people. means 21,277,000 people affected. Therefore, people think ""It's problem"" care.

I'm exaggerating course. Many care, bosses government don't, possible stay home. misread math edited original post. sort calculation interesting. remember delay infection testing (okay forgot math) longer one death. 8 days 23 days (so 15 days testing death) could good guesses there. Worldmeters numbers county texas. 

I'm assuming Harris undercounting cases around 75%. likely early pandemic much higher, every study that's done since March come number 90% USA. Excess mortality makes think texas whole undercounting deaths 50-70% (or else there's something else killing people increasing kill rate 20% week).

There lot guesses involved. Try math multiple ways find contradictions guesses. Oh fuck bullshit.  know masks work. road one gives fuck supposed ""lies"" experts. wear god damn fucking mask. said say people refuse need put house arrest order protect rest society. shit got stop. Ok flu shots, get every year... common cold mild changes quickly enough it‚Äôs worth making vaccine for. something dangerous Covid, makes sense invest resources. Like flu every year. ... little nudge push us (self-harming) direction already kind wanted go -- effective -- probably end costing us couple trillion dollars yourself.

Irony. need health insurance Canada get basic care. insurance covers electoral care, things like dental eye care.

If break arm need surgery, might pay $20 cast. Whether insurance not, that's anyone Canada would pay.

If wanted get electoral surgery, that's would pay for.

You health insurance.

Literally everywhere else government subsidized care.

You need insurance get care.

Literally everywhere else walks gets care regardless coverage.

Get educated. truly amazing disconnected Americans rest world. vaccine come end October govts around world open anyway. Even like us obeying lockdown everything . unrealistic maintain till end Dec . think masks enforced that's . Florida way people. look per capita, none Florida's counties come close New York peak: http://casualhacker.net/covid19/#rel;dly;s100;smv15;USA;US-FL;USFOI;USAHL;USFOA;USNOE

Don't get wrong. Florida needs shut get top now, they're ways bad things NYC. Fucking Ray Charles saw coming. Day‚Äôs done yet. California hasn‚Äôt finished reporting. Bombing precise then. town would hit blackout. probably okay. would want mask??? Face hiding best me. no-maskers crazeeeeee! link 17 day delay? quick googling didn‚Äôt find it. Civilized human societies process like too, it‚Äôs called due process. Check deaths though. don‚Äôt give shit cases sounds lucky. work industry, know least six restaurant owners near closed already. canceled new ventures. man think bleach, Orange said so. money life Holy crap. parents limiting trips, follow social distancing, wearing masks whenever public. sister bartender. Somehow, completely fine around son, daycare. astounding see irony *retarded well known vaccines effective elderly assuming apply Covid vaccine.(""elderly"" generally taken last comment got deleted ""purely political""? sub's auto-mod dumb. Anyways, I'll try different guess kind caught testing equipment, it.

Not cynical, people directly making money selling equipment. testing contact tracing directly.. money making.

Corona shown better anything failures of.. system care money buy things instead caring people. Better luck next time. Apparently today VP said flattened curve we're good. need testing anymore guess. Mission accomplished!!! _Corolovit_! Interesting specify dads, cause shitshow town hall West Palm Beach FL day almost women mothering age (was women videos I've seen, gotta assume least dudes there) Nope. Americans dont need Russians act stupid. splitting hairs here. don‚Äôt time get details, fact matter is, would reduce risk getting HIV far abstaining fewer less socially important activities Covid. children infected family members, probably parents.  secondary transmission virus children school, children teachers. 

Kids appear get virus *from* adults appear pass kids *or* adults. Disney vacation booked November. Flights booked. Tickets bought. AirBnB rented. couldn‚Äôt pay us go now! We‚Äôre glad didn‚Äôt tell daughter. love polls really intelligence test. Hotels open. I'm sure are, go stay least right now. Yes course, whitest part America civilized. timing fact younger people getting now. point, take empty arenas create Covid triage areas. you‚Äôve got Covid, go arenas. isn‚Äôt true. work icu big chuck admits elective surgeries need closer monitoring surgery surgeons trust icu pcu floors (we smaller ratios stricter rules monitoring) Sorry Mitch can‚Äôt election year. didn‚Äôt need happen, states getting hit refused take seriously. still aren‚Äôt. put 2 3 people 1 bed that's 10-15 beds wiggle room. ""pretends shocked"" official declaration war people know is. Nah dude Karen thinking right eat shitty chain restaurants berating server, well right haircut important peoples right live. Back societies worked together would shunned bc sociopath. I‚Äôm transferring school north city handled extremely well. Regardless, still extremely cautious reopening. makes nervous hear schools SATX ATX aren‚Äôt anything Overall deaths whole US down. really many states seeing spikes. Deaths lag hospitalizations (since takes die)

More hospitalizations young people. Nursing homes able better contain largely responsible decrease deaths (which good thing).

But cases rising, people die still affected could left permeant damage. whole thing far They‚Äôll blame youth protesters like been. It‚Äôs crazy could viewed same, virus picks favorites. Absolutely. called right away insurance company ‚Äúlooking it‚Äù. I‚Äôm letting make first contact hospital first assuming would pull also defending money. 100% paying service receive. But, charge general still insane short visit ER 2 pills. Bonkers. Thanks tip :). ""Hold beer"" -- Friday

""And mine"" -- Saturday

""Me, three!"" -- Sunday tried forcing work cash register 


Something seems seem forgotten need slap register.



That's Walmart know. like ...

Climate Change work says wear mask walking around facility gonna within 6 feet another person time. 80% people unmasked 95% day. Everyone little personal fans blowing shitty broken AC around. work benches exactly 6 feet apart. 

Everyone stop whining wear mask bathroom. older overweight folks smoke coughing sneezing day. 

It's fuckin time bomb y'all. dumbfounded buffoon obviously read article agree. Humanity doomed either way. sucks what‚Äôs happening people dying right now. I‚Äôm pretty sure parents die covid-19 within next year. parents extremely risk dying covid-19 due health + age, still going work dangerous work environments. No. people actually careful. crazys politician crazys (99%) causing problem. think can't wear mask use duct tape 3-4 times around head. Would cure problem. ‚ÄòMerica! Gonna need see proof that. hospital I've ever worked at, unions highly discouraged something brazen would immediately removed. ever called surgeries? said elective *procedures*. Unfortunately lot even non-surgical, non-overnight stay procedures get canceled whenever hospitals see surge Covid patients, don‚Äôt want expose potentially at-risk patients high viral loads. Basically everything reasonably delayed 6-8 weeks get delayed. 

In addition, oncologists fellowship trained doctors internal medicine training often get redeployed Covid wards whenever there‚Äôs significant increase admissions, availability doctors perform procedures also decreases. don‚Äôt think Houston point yet don‚Äôt lock down, feel it‚Äôs matter time. happened hospitals near (I‚Äôm Long Island). entire life. mental gymnastics rationalize lack empathy lack basic human decency. ""elective surgeries"" mean ""unnecessary"" btw. Hard say. could already runs course vulnerable population current mortality rates, that's mortality rate could drop.
Either way, would suck. ICU capacity usually stay around? Also, often ICU usually reach capacity? Without information, hard tell unusual situation is.  Uuuuu.



Good good......

The studies absolutely valid give picture overall FR analyzing happens peak hospitalization times unusable data misinterpreted.

Take peak death, look happened average 3 weeks detected cases, build best guess total infections based known cases/ measures time/duration measures narrow actually happening time.

And obviously times numbers way higher total average, knowledge help us understand peaks hit real hard.

Just curious, trying say overwhelmed hospitals effect fatality rates? Serious question comes across like it. true 1 million dead US October morning preview, want ride.

You're psychopath. instance hitting face fist claiming assault saying right even hands. Mmm maybe picked largest city region, also happens powerful city world.

Buc-ee beaver looking motherfucker past actions anything go by, intend get vote whether they're alive not. people still driving like don‚Äôt carry car accident 70 mph. think go hospital full? I'm sorry mother close death, must terrifying - unimaginable.

But shitty cards reason lose liberty.

(Also Karen definition wrong) That's Yesterday's news....

and Tomorrow's ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Exactly haha obscure statement Oh, wow. planning going back work party? Depends badly loses think. close could claim interference try something. landslide probably not. Yup yup yup. Yeah, FL ICU cases dropped making news anymore. clearly wish ppl ICU. Disgusting. It‚Äôs ‚Äúnot smart‚Äù. It‚Äôs downright fucking stupid Deaths lag behind infections, deaths could way. people too

I'm going need source That's important top take responsibility. allows people rungs need fix it. people worried blame, try avoid it, instead needs done. Don‚Äôt forget said keyword, Pensions, younger generations get stuck shit 401k Stock Gambling machine. start recall? lot defective parts. actually goes downtown downtown? Morphine palliative care, euthanasia. Opiates reduce breathing turn merely dangerous hypoxemia deadly. mean images refrigerated trucks people buried random patch land together seem assuring. saying really happening places like Korea, Germany, Australia. local outbreaks, tam back without country lock down. Sure can. Though kind tricky jamming syringe. :D want HANDLED. 

Handled like tragedy. Handled like train wreck nuclear accident.

I want fucking handled! going interesting see happens health sector large chunk population files medical bankruptcy. mention happens society general there's suddenly huge cohort literally nothing lose. Mass unrest, mass evictions, mass homelessness, mass viral death that. 

Buckle buckaroos gonna bumpy ride Peak ICU capacity (non surge think) reached several cities 3 months ago. 

* Atlanta [link New York City: Damn sub full psychotic doomers. great best medical care food around. also zoo.  laughing vice president saying exact opposite Dr. Fauci. Fortunately/unfortunately, depending perspective, people infected, easier get R(t) 1.  estimates Texas 1.25.  point, need 20% population infected recovered start force virus downward herd immunity. exponential growth, Texas yee-hawing way toward number pretty fast.

&amp;#x200B;

it'll work out, less. lot people dying need way. One thing curious. earlier statement, pence meeting airline CEOs. Isn‚Äôt presidents role? Suddenly went radar. Maybe Tulsa bad idea? Actually higher 4 months ago. 

Think 38,000 cases highest day, lockdown slowed down. Already passed 42,000 today. Personally think even though cases infections low, shouldn‚Äôt rushing re-open workplaces schools. Part reason things low *because* lockdowns social distancing. Cases aren‚Äôt magically low. 

Workplaces obvious, schools different issue. Even schools let 15 students per class, that‚Äôs still tons students. schools GTA thousands students. pity Americans. #itsallaboutme going send country spiraling downwards again. Trump thinks issue blow people care look like asses around world. Apple need open Best Buy/Geek Squad apple sales apple services. ~signed~ overwhelmed Geek Squad Agent predicted problem germany also beds staff. Seems uncommon. Medical people retrained short notice. fear-mongering article. Texas report yet? truth - divided nation. Therefore virus gonna spread. contain shit, especially now....so play safe hope meds vaccine get late. asymptomatic ones give shit. think ruling world now, like kind game movie.....

my two cents dont like see it. Young people also partying. 40 kids Orlando area got 1 night bar. Sure heard story 15 girls Jacksonville too. Plenty young people blowing old person problem young people think they're invincible. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article ](http://archive.is/jxNqJ) Based state reporting max capacity yet, mass testing shown inverse relation proposed CFR. northeastern states hit especially hard policies implemented dealing crisis flu season. 

To maybe seems best case scenario maybe let novel virus it‚Äôs work summer months rather height massive killers flu season. think shouldn‚Äôt put eggs one basket things like vaccine one size fits preventing spread. think it‚Äôs obvious fucked considering smartest scientists across earth STILL baffled virus. 

You're spending WAY much time sub. Calm down, promise we're fucked. Nothing churches. Nope. House worship keeps Rona away surprised all. anybody surprised? wrote ""we GOING get relatively easy""

Read spanish flu century ago watch contagion see bad things **really** get Let economy burn so, along massive tax cut, wealthy buy even more. we? can't send people moon, neither I. keep people warm sure hell them.

Myth scarcity? Name unlimited resource. Name one resource used without producing, refining, harvesting, investing, words *work*. Maybe tell something multiculturalism sucks. Asthmatic here, working 90 degree temps mask. Cuz I'm idiot. Americans spend Europe european US. That's point. go some.hotspot like Santorini Greece like US lump AA Delta, Alaska, JetBlue, Southwest. AA died natural death long time ago. That‚Äôs fair, I‚Äôm convinced live nation filled selfish ignorant babies. Wearing damn mask apparently tough ask large chunk us, recent town hall meetings show idiocy another level. like 12 year old playing Sims messing everything purpose I‚Äôm 35 years old Florida. young always honor roll student advanced classes. chaos around teacher could control. would put entire bus class even grade detention regularly. good student entirely demoralizing dropped school 12 years old. (Home schooled accredited program FL 50% bible studies walked library read books instead never finished grade program). 

These good amount adults Florida. Uncontrolled, uneducated, ignorant authority figures. 

And kid, must locked them.

Side note: went teach photography, cinematography, audio mixing, design, recipe writing. New York Times bestselling cookbook author food photographer worked 40 cookbooks. also film direct award-winning feature films. last film premiered Tribeca Film Festival. Dropping Florida school system 12 years old one greatest moves made life. Fucking dumber Greg Abbott, that‚Äôs something. Curbside starting soon Michigan. got Kindle Voyage started eBay saddened discover online lending libraries really compare real thing. Plenty books wanted read nowhere found despite famous authors Ray Bradbury. wonder idiots going say surpass ""abortions year"" number. Also start wearing masks now? people wearing masks Oklahoma people behind cash registers, hardly find mask sight.  Yes hospitals go 2300 ICU beds, hire staff. Right 1300 base capacity, 31% covid rest non-covid. Yeah raked leaves forests would forest fires Sure glad stocks rallied weeks end ""re-opening optimism"" obviously going completely failed experiment start.

Let's face it, economy fucked years. even hit real estate collapse, mass bankruptcies insolvencies yet.

The idea we're actually trying ""pro-economy"" things rather fight virus shameful, economy 100% fucked either way, best thing economy earth right strive little infection possible.

oh well... Really disheartening many people would rather risk getting CV it‚Äôs complications wear piece cloth face. can‚Äôt imagine selfish. horrible becomes evil. maybe time. (Uh...) Guess Irish tourists going summer According CDC data, happening US.

This data trustworthy lagged. Reporting COVID deaths Pneumonia one thing, reporting death would much higher degree malfeasance, reasonably confident occurring. COVID deaths misreported flu pneumonia still included last column. Region matters US. states low rates right completely possible mean tomorrow? think legitimiate concern economy, mean economy sense food table. 

Extra 600/week runs next month that's shit gets real Yay! Texas isn‚Äôt list! I‚Äôm El Paso County specifically requested delay reopening high numbers. Additionally, County Judge, along counties, requested Abbot allow us cite businesses requiring/enforcing face covering. Abbot granted request, there‚Äôs that. It‚Äôs week, won‚Äôt know bit positive effects it. Today largest number cases one day: 233. Jesus said ""Give back Caesar Caesar‚Äôs, God God‚Äôs."" reference paying taxes/following governmental authority. (Matthew 22:21, NIV)

Paul said ""Let everyone subject governing authorities, authority except God established. authorities exist established God. Consequently, whoever rebels authority rebelling God instituted, bring judgment themselves."" (Romans 12:1-2, NIV)

So... fairly clear Jesus next prophet say situation. problem we're still miniscule portion population infected. Even keep rolling full steam people getting sick reason think means would die fall flu comes in. think people also understand businesses certain level income need stay maintain themselves, that's often dang close full operational capacity. ""But business better none!"" often totally untrue, business represents loss none doesn't. So, example, half-capacity restaurants. probably good amount restaurants business model constantly staying half cap feasible, IE, go business that. least around 5 times dangerous. .5% mortality rate vs .1% flu.

It also contagious means people get virus. general math higher number people infected means lots people. flu rate also treatment flu shot, people protect themselves.

The flu deaths around 60k bad year. Coronavrius taken 120k far 6-7 months. predicting another 60k end year keep things way are. Sad people getting desensitized 500 deaths day preventable extent. Nah. Someone probably contaminated sewage water. 

We would‚Äôve seen March 2019  Yup that's happened, states report cases properly due platform use called e-Sus lot Americans think move Canada... fail understand takes get visa here, country matter. US citizenship magical live anywhere card. (It goes ways, needing US visa move south.) Thanks Steve Jobs Something done February . glad good doctor far timid push getting done IMHO. wrong? Yeah, would anyone believe word China said response? Florida many US states matter? me? None. You‚Äôd lot shares like PE firms mentioned get plurality majority. far Boeing stuff, haven‚Äôt looked besides headlines. Isn‚Äôt manufacturer, airline maintenance. news, America's shittiest airline something shitty. like dipshit voters zero critical thinking skill. Education root many problems yet it‚Äôs continually chopping block. family inverse relationship age caution level. pandemic would end vaccine, coronavirus would still last 2023 Brother Sister law telling God's plan. Saying die die. think coroner's counting covid deaths. asked proof say man died family knew covid look up. give article states opposite stick fingers ears go lalalalala. They‚Äôre soooooo full shit. Tried sell middle seat last week three leg travel today.  full-price, basic economy seat. Flew two weeks ago wasn‚Äôt empty seat six legs. 

They filled first class non-revs one. 

I‚Äôm United right now. American officially lost business. Nope. million 25 million. given Europeans limited go, could make small shortfall. go bankrupt. took 2.5 billion loans 11.5% interest. Yes read right best deal could get credit card. would say throw towel fold like always hurt thousands employees work won‚Äôt able get job another airline since none hiring anytime soon. country the""make Brazil great "" Trump buddy president LOL graduated HS 2010, long time ago now, square dancing was...weird. matter controlled study not? vaccine passed trials rescue therapy available. risk adverse effects change study. areas low transmission rates.

It would completely feasible New England NY right now, Florida. Young not, obesity pre-existing conditions puts younger people risk. Since increasing South, obesity rates even higher there. Young people also major transmitter many feel effect virus unknowingly spread others vulnerable. NYC, quickly returning normal. seems trust science experts come fine. BACKFIRE virus, refused one calling grocery stores/utilities shut down... ""Watch mouth, help sale."" may bad say, hope continues right election gets Trump out. Lol? WTF?? ""use violence""?? police ""use violence"" write ticket speeding, parking, public nudity??? ask person comply, don't, ask ID issue ticket fine. offer ID possibly arrest them. feel people would comply ID part issued ticket. None include violence. going road assuming cops bad cops reality cops decent human beings, overly enforce like every task do. None anything allowed enforce mask mandates. could come bunch ridiculous scenarios well. person refuses leave business, owner draws gun, bouncer forcefully remove person. What's difference? police, mostly decent, enforce ticket fine. Pretty simple task. Like speeding ticket, also endangers public. Similar principle there. reading sharing info meetings social media. get proper medical care, there's going shortage medical personnel real soon. nation, there's way vaccine eventually happen. many resources thrown issue. then, *best* we'll low-level circulation.

For individual, varies. privileged position continue self-isolate, wear masks, socially distance indefinitely. choose path almost certainly reduce risk catching coronavirus. forced work dangerous conditions, distancing little PPE. in-between.

Unfortunately, means thousands thousands people going die. view bug fear must us do, understand imperative - usually possible - mitigate personal risk. Wear mask appropriately, wash hands constantly, socially distance self-isolate possible, work home possible, sanitize doorknobs often, etc., etc., etc. Florida give two shits Im seriously confused question. Intially scientific models predicted IFR anywhere high 3% thought virus remained active surfaces days. initial models predicted massive hospital overruns every city lockdowns implented flatten curve give hospitals time deal infected. time we‚Äôve learned virus around 0.3-.04 IFR survive long surfaces makes initial models incredibly exaggerated. ZERO chance hospital runs. fact ventilators die sooner. Sweden perfect example didn‚Äôt initiate lockdowns hospitals get overrun. proves point lockdowns needed aren‚Äôt needed again. Also don‚Äôt forget huge percentage covid deaths Newsom Cuomo sending sick people nursing homes, Maybe I'm going restaurants/bars. Basically grocery stores, hardware stores, occasionally clothes shopping.

Either Houston better Dallas, which, obviously. :P agree, bit frustrating see many Americans acting like they're living third world country they're living like kings compared parts world. recognize problems mentioned above, really hope next administration fix it, it'll probably project spanning decades seeing Trump undid pretty much everything Obama fought for. Infections skewing younger, likely older people careful. younger people likely infect older people, may fare well. Almost 47k new cases. ''good'' thing less 1000 deaths, sadly quite rare days. numbers states go much one day another, week S√£o Paulo registered 432 new deaths tuesday, 284 wednesday, 407 thursday 207 today.

A doctor charge one important universities monitoring virus Brazil said region declining curve north, region hit first back march Honestly depends friends went time visitors day that, guess true.

To add ton shitty people even full quarantine keep going without reason, thanks cases took many time go  wild thing is, many people would feel comfortable going masks required general public would respect virus. problem (red, far like Texas Arizona, headed there) state I‚Äôd say majority people don‚Äôt wear masks. 90% people office don‚Äôt wear them. avoid going public, I‚Äôve oil changed, get part repair, picked plants, places I‚Äôve been, also fewer 10% people wearing masks. I‚Äôm going anywhere that‚Äôs necessary. includes shopping local anything get online pickup curbside. So, unfortunately, I‚Äôm shopping local saving business isn‚Äôt worth health. ONE locally run place town know requiring masks. know huge blow up. franchises require masks nation-wide, them, Costco enforcing locally. 

It‚Äôs tough majority people believe masks mean fear giving freedom, claim won‚Äôt shop anywhere requires them. Meanwhile, won‚Äôt shop anywhere doesn‚Äôt. SUSPECT good number trying cart freedom horse posturing would fine someone would take control require them. Goddamn, Florida utterly smashed previous record 5,900 love reference. think general re-opening people different reasons. Got links? book cooking misdiagnosing due lack testing pass vibe check. Canada same, staring Jul 1. Something Hepa filters, air supplied sucked below. unless looking dropped contacts seat, can't possibly get infected. Possibly, going hospital guarantee long term health issues anyone 40. 

Can possibly link data support this? Florida taking serious aside... 

I believe C19 spreads much faster indoors reasons. Open air bit wind helps dilute droplets, sun's UV kills viruses pretty quick, easier socially distant.  

If hot cold, people spend time indoors increasing chance transmission.   27, possibly 41 Bay Area control part. live SF delayed next phase reopening Monday TBD saw cases yesterday. worries actions, tons people might get infected SoCal bring here. Everybody know who's using IR forehead thermometers says they're total bullshit. people report like 94 degrees. Oregon here. Better lot places. I‚Äôd guess... maybe 60% wear masks?

Unless go Walmart, it‚Äôs like 30%. least smart enough shut down. want people tear apart clothes even bigger debt face jail can't pay want tear apart clothes? Red new orange.  might work southern state, NY could dip 30f October? might also feel like much tragedy people already elderly living nursing homes.

I love Grandma, lucky enough living relatively independently mom (not nursing home), 99 fairly ambivalent idea continuing exist is. get covid die would obviously sad, wasted potential someone younger died. True, certainly said briefing, also papers based antibody testing found similar amounts truly asymptomatics. deal. Didn‚Äôt answer question, wrote bold makes sense like Churchill said. always count Americans right thing...after they've exhausted every possibility. big issue relying telephone calls contact tracing disregards modern phone use behaviors etiquette. people cell phones. people answer calls unknown numbers. people unlikely respond missed call without voicemail text message. Even then, lot folks may listen voicemail read text message won‚Äôt return call. People don‚Äôt want talk strangers, let alone give personal information contacts travels.

This technology issue, tracing apps exist Asia Europe seem like effective solution, mandating app tracks contacts whereabouts simply compatible Americans‚Äô notion privacy.

Text message probably effective way inform somebody possible contact individual positive covid. can‚Äôt force anybody respond. frankly, think lot Americans concerned possible covid diagnosis ‚Äúon record‚Äù - participating voluntary process contact tracing end forcing endure quarantine two weeks, leave job, etc - lot folks would rather remain ignorant. One thing miss work actually came covid, miss work ‚Äúpotential exposure‚Äù isn‚Äôt solid enough people self-quarantine. 

Big-picture mandates like social distancing face coverings work focus, policy-wise, governments reduce transmission point. policies ‚Äúsingle‚Äù people easier enforce social level.  Bless hearts mean large counties population cases *cries Arizona* see answer mask ordinance prevent COVID different seatbelt laws? Thanks child left behind, generation people failed learn type critical thinking, science history. It‚Äôs really surprising. Except, guess what? --there might said immunities. Aaaaa.. hahahahahah!!! idea travel santiago open again? dreams tickets ski valle nevado season looking like pipe dream. luckily refundable.  makes much sense. People seem cheering Covid like sport. ridiculous. Thank refreshing voice logic subreddit loves advocate increasing power police states. Hey now. dark, dark times think could use little Dolly lives. think they‚Äòre highly qualified idiots. Exactly. lot GOP adopted style. Disgusting. Travis isn‚Äôt reporting today there‚Äôs actually lot counties reporting case levels 100s recently. ~14 per day 100. ~8 per day 200. I‚Äôm still board young healthy you‚Äôre fine thing; think it‚Äôs disingenuous. There‚Äôs still major risk regardless health. Less likely severe impact? Sure. still worth risk, mindset many jackass youngsters populating beaches, bars, house parties, etc. ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt impact ME!‚Äù A) really true B) aren‚Äôt human alive buddy.

I agree at-risk people getting served first move; fact, guidance believe via CDC saw MONTHS ago (February) digging fact clear schedule gets vaccines first. Elderly, kids young people, 21- almost retired (middle aged), men last. Sounds reasonable me!

I hope get damn thing made soon. miss life 2020. fix level dangerously stupid. start. evidence February China, Italy, Iran, EU countries around 29-30 BMI risk COVID skyrocketed up. never reason believe morbidly obese effected. Oh sure can, flying becomes luxury every idiot it.  started brooms stood straight. cleaning supplies opened portal hell. dad encouraged sunbathing lungs hurt UV light kills virus. I'm sure deep thinks sun's UV light penetrates skin, blinked disbelief. I've heard KN95 masks good everyone else. n95 ( although ENTIRELY effective) good person. regardless. kn95 straps break time. sucks Everyone shirtcocking.

Looks professional Zoom, free breeze camera. chose ICUs Houston Dallas reached capacity. little way fucking late. like reading Hot Zone, million one dumb ways describing way. Abbott's schizophrenic approach handling this. Sweden 50 deaths reported today thus far, 523 per million population (5,280 deaths total), Italy 574 per mil. Italy followed country worst crisis months. since hospital beds occupied Covid patients, injuries jackass level stuntery treated hospital parking lot. mention car accidents occurring one biggest drunk driving weekends year.

'Murica! preventative own

- 6 feet away

- Wearing Masks

- Facing One Another

- Sunlight Fresh Air

Compounded, yeah pretty safe;
This studies showing casual incidental contact spreads virus less consistent (conversational) contact.

From protests point view, without mask, yelling, chanting creates higher risk transmission 6', that's much better sitting within 3' someone bar restaurant, talking face face. 2019 thing past. really get autopsies anymore. performed autopsies dead way dangerous viruses like ebola. US close 4 times many deaths *the entire continent Asia.* WARNING sarcasm hyperbole follows. 

The second amendment says shoot counts retroactive abortion. card says fix stupid. 

You may return previously scheduled programming. Even African countries almost real hospital care mortality much lower 10%.

Check countries like South Sudan, Mali, Mauritania, CFR 2-3%, IFR almost certainly less 1%.

Of course young populations, assume Amazon tribes. Alabama man: sista use one bed Actually yeah basically that‚Äôs it. going bed, boogie man looks sars-cov-2 tentacles bed. Yeah, one dealing control pandemic seems fine.  Unless butt naked zero access kind spare cloth material, quite literally excuse.  wonder EU wants ban Americans international travel massive failure national individual level.  Lol, true today first said. Lmao expect? literally Remember weeks immediately following re-opening everyone board claiming virus hoax, lack cases proved everything fine (and presumably, entire germ theory disease canceled.) remarkable time. I‚Äôm sorry, no, great job. governor reopened state numbers leveled without waiting begin dropping. went phase 1 phase 3 roughly 3 weeks, followed along trump‚Äôs footsteps manage this, refused make masks mandatory, actively prevented county &amp; city governments enacting stricter measures. majority state residents pissed &amp; giving shit Twitter he‚Äôs save face? put us position, he‚Äôs reason we‚Äôre shit now. media manipulation good policy. anything policy Cuomo praised sticking covid patients nursing homes. media far tank left even funny. Looking right words ... ""oh, shit"" do? gotcha. also get easy answers situation like this. But, honestly, beyond slow spread (which, remember correctly, keep hospitals capacity. ""Flatten curve"" etc.) do? 

&amp;#x200B;

The plan - least U.S. - never get it. flatten curve get later. can't hunker however long takes vaccine - many economically vulnerable people country social safety nets catch them. Plus, horse way barn barn door swinging breeze. virus everywhere.  hate even pointing certainty lumps army Karen's demanding haircuts decrying masks devil's work. think obligation slow spread. Wearing masks undoubtedly part Covid social contract upheld. also know privileged folks means hunker longer unprivileged, scarier individual long-term consequences disease.

&amp;#x200B;

I also know afraid unhealthy. young healthy, chances fine. like 60/40 chances. CFR people 50, California, .2%, includes people comorbidities. Also, that's taking account known positives. we've learned many people asymptomatic carriers mild cases means true positive number order magnitude higher, meaning true CFR order magnitude lower.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, think nothingburger - all. serious taken seriously. response criminally negligent. - quarantine policy, fear language used peddle policy. want people stay home, appeal fear. Even if, large, afraid. Cautious, yes. Prudent, yes. Responsible, yes. fear gonna drive us crazy. lolnp kid fever cough got tested results within hour. negative, told us %90 accurate fine within two days... Man guys watching us US? is, concerted efforts (by even small amounts people) misinform people.

People fighting internet wars stuff understand. 

Consider privacy, many arguments for/against privacy even valid? arguments people provide fear-based? fear come from? Internal justification?  see scare tactic somewhere?

Truth is, humans pussies scared, largely unwilling confront anything outside comfort zone.

And easy manipulate us. guess good mine I've wearing one every place go months now. People bright sometimes conclusion. type evidence want, anything I‚Äôve ever posted doesn‚Äôt win anyone over.

One actually supports claim? It‚Äôs there, **but you‚Äôre welcome post part article think proves hospitals overstating deaths**.

This isn‚Äôt trick. source doesn‚Äôt say think does. Yep. It‚Äôs unlimited capacity. There‚Äôs still types patient care treatments. God, fucked. sucks rare many people getting seeing more. Right mean takes walk woods river. It‚Äôs hard. I‚Äôd love get away worth risk Give Churchill due. currently? One passenger next empty seat Went one protest gotta say, everyone wearing mask. used work motorcycles US mechanic friend sign stand said 'metric only'. 

Two complete sets tools gets expensive. Take preventative measures work everyone wonders wasted money. Plus tons ways profit consolidate power crisis, look secret slush fund got distributed zero oversight. people power stupid forward looking, people's interest mind.  ""They die happy, die."" - wow. That's line remember. watch first, long. Probably, imagine ICU beds sophisticated monitoring equipment hooked something. emergency measures, they‚Äôre definitely ideal. overloaded levels hospital probably also strained breaking point equipment, PPE, staff, drugs addition beds. certainly discourage millenials traveling, esp flying internationally, ask folks drive family try take bus (greyhound/flix bus) major holidays.

we restrict flying people need fly business/commercial reasons, move heavy cargo train &amp; sea.

there sacrifices made sure - change slogan ""experiences things"" ""(made USA) things experiences"". 

only frozen/processed foods long distances, asking family either live close other, see often.



^/s Another Texas panhandler . job keeps soon order expired, became rare see anyone mask. attitude like ""Welp, guess that's ."" soon restrictions lifted originally. shit? Wow, papers wrote Stoics, too. waste. Please remember next time state leadership claims state side hill. happen again. Things start look better, people get complacent, boom reality kicks back in. 

When things get better, doesn‚Äôt mean good, bad. Don‚Äôt get complacent think time go beach daily cases drop back 4k. still pretty locked everyone wearing masks. Restaurants opened bit, friends industry said one coming in.

And people going come summer. uncle vacation rentals Cape Cod phone hook. really think issue real state quarantine, suggestion. Northwest Florida special kind stupid. They'll learn soon, cases Escambia Okaloosa starting pick up. wonder Matt Gaetz handle this, hate man. possible vaccine get Emergency Use Authorization based preliminary data September, data promising enough. also possible stage 3 trials shortened duration Oh, started - you‚Äôre wild ride. may rewatch now. Enjoy! It‚Äôs absolutely pay back time. 

Right see people don‚Äôt care all, living lives like nothing happening. I‚Äôm staying home can, sensible best socially responsible.

Worst president history!!!! lower number deaths due expanded testing, also spikes Florida, Texas Arizona begun last week so. Hospitalizations three states. deaths start rising hospitalizations. last reason lower death rates states large percentage contracting young, 30. hope young people living parents. I've personal historian stuff since things started kicking (NJ here). office closed doors converted full WFH back March 31st, average 2000 new cases day, someone close contact someone got sick. actually fairly late, since governor ordered stay home order weeks earlier.

After this, daily cases went 1.5x that, rough max around 3.5k average month, daily death average went 300avg/day. basically everything completely closed, full work home lot workers, faiely decent general compliance guidelines.

Looking today's numbers Florida (which close NY's numbers peak) Texas (reaching max capacity ICUs, NY NJ never got close to) things looking bad US. Sneeze mask, use hands contain sneeze mask prevent high velocity air making around mask. Wait ears stop ringing, go wash hands. (I've never fan spit snot shirt anyways. stop using handkerchiefs?)

Listening doctor nurse friends, COVID patients particularly ""hard"" care for, equate radioactive human observe care weeks. ventilator, minimal special treatment. occupy bed space forever though. Bad cases take 4-6+ weeks cleared die.

Do go way moron? Insane. That's is. reach peak stupidity tomorrow something even dumber. 1 20 sounds great, look real numbers gets scary, 9,000 cases reported today Florida that‚Äôs 450 people would need hospital care. it‚Äôs economy. worst worlds One also look overall mortality rate.

As comparison Finland point May overall death count country dropped five year average week-by-week statistics. social distancing helped avoid also deaths caused regular illnesses well accidents, traffic etc.

So based pretty much increased deaths addressed Covid. rando CA here, drove threw OK going cross country stopped Oklahoma city see memorial (really amazing, best I've hands down) lunch walk around. Super friendly people.

I hard time believing things hear news. Everything bias seems either president. thought would ask others would maybe could learn something. honest question assure you.

You brought really good points like maintaining stockpiles, emergency response plans teams, using teams/plans time comes. also agree could push use masks importance staying home. Enforcing involve police though, would like minimize interactions community. masks required, maybe give everyone, least reusable kind.

What agree though injecting bleach thing WHO. saw press conference Trump never said, "" hey go inject bleach cure virus"". says lots stupid things dumb ideas that's trying twist said. also dont trust downplayed seriousness virus initially covered China. general trust big international organizations like UN, thats discussion another day.

But besides increased lockdowns mask use else do? else response teams disaster plans supposed implement? I'm medical expert government can't snap fingers invent vaccine. I'm also saying nothing else do. I'm saying dont know things telling representatives implement. *Laughs logic Florida* Texan #1 Hey, stop murdering innocent people make buck. 
Texan #2 Nah, lets reduce number people murder.  
Texan #1 Good plan. pictures seriously creepy. Yeah, dude. It‚Äôs maddening. obvi reactionary dickheads, still, shit uphill. Asked concerned death rate may begin climb, Pence said, ‚ÄúOur hope prayers case.‚Äù

 addition prayer, according health officials, Americans prevent spike deaths staying away covering mouths public.  mean would make sense NYC, DC, MD, VA, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, SF, spikes accordingly.

We're month protests anywhere near spikes TX/FL LA County had. doesn‚Äôt to. guys Washington aren‚Äôt anything. Tell him, ""Don't tread bro"" Even everybody goes tumbling hill, enemies tumble twice far, that's still net gain you.

All reason proper pandemic response? that?

It's also false.

Memorial day/openings/protests...wait couple weeks...then increase confirmed cases...so still wait see next weeks.

My hope younger people die much, they'll take home parents grandparents, start cycle again

Sure, dying reason celebrate, perhaps person fearful prior infected, ever infected first place. would think fear cullings encouraged. 


You know what's even better surviving raging forest fire? Avoiding raging forest fire.  


if fear leads caution, that's good thing. that's kind evolved it. back early homo sapien days, saw tiger felt fear, spit hell lot evolving offspring saw tiger thought ""feeling fear would bummer"".

Of course even Lombardy called time shut everything people dying corridors.

Not sure case here. Yeah that‚Äôs felt wrote comment. surge overflow probably normal okay current capacity predictor things come subtext Yes, that's problem COVID19. putting ton strain healthcare system ""unexpected"" patients.

quality care falls harshly unit hits capacity. NY tens thousands non-COVID19 deaths historical average multitude factors (people willing seek care pandemic, hospitals overwhelmed unable properly care patients, etc) exactly correct.

There regional hospitals remote, nearest hospital hours away. That's fine, see places mentioned get hit again... pretty simple. close down, cases go down. open up, go up. can't simultaneously shit places US opening go praising visiting Eiffel Tower, Louvre, on... forget quickly spreads, exponential growth, on? think applies US?

You get virus control, track, isolate, people wear masks, may able somewhat normal life/economy... get control, kind open without measures mentioned previous paragraph, going come back same.

Something tells week three seeing people due hospital hallways make tough get reelected. dangerous game they're playing people's lives UPMC doctor Wednesday said number people hospitalized COVID-19 within UPMC lowest many weeks, people test positive aren‚Äôt getting sick.

Dr. Donald Yealy pointed occurring even midst Pennsylvania‚Äôs reopening ongoing social justice protests.

He suggested country focusing much rising COVID-19 case counts.

‚ÄúWe need change mindset focus exclusively number cases, severity illness. shouldn‚Äôt counting diagnosed infection,‚Äù Yealy said. ‚ÄúFor vast majority people testing positive, illness mild, don‚Äôt even know symptoms COVID-19 infection.‚Äù

Yealy also said UPMC tested 15,000 patients receiving non-COVID-19 care, one 400 testing positive. said rate, held steady weeks, suggests aren‚Äôt many people carrying COVID-19 don‚Äôt know it.

‚ÄúIn summary, experience shows fewer people admitted, are, tend much less sick beginning peak phases pandemic,‚Äù said.

Yealy said declines might result factors good job protecting elderly others highly vulnerable, rising portion new cases involving younger people healthier less likely need hospitalization.

He also said UMPC improved tools helping sickest patients, including drug Remdesivir, ‚Äúgained experience best care for‚Äù COVID-19 patients. noted early pandemic, doctors usually put sickest patients breathing ventilators. UPMC learned ‚Äúit difficult successfully come off, outcomes simply aren‚Äôt good.‚Äù

Yealy said UPMC presently 14 patients ventilators across 40 hospitals, include six Dauphin, Cumberland, York Lancaster counties.

Yealy said lessening impact COVID-19 might related summer weather people spending less time close quarters.

However, Yealy another UPMC official spoke briefing reporters Wednesday warned disregarding need face masks precautions prevent spread COVID-19.

Tami Minnier, UPMC‚Äôs chief quality officer, said ‚Äúwe need stay vigilant. need able continue wearing masks, wearing masks appropriately, washing hands frequently, using social distancing. Despite points Dr. Yealy made, plan going forward keeping us safe.‚Äù

Yealy said it‚Äôs important younger people don‚Äôt get sick COVID-19 understand danger poses others.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre saying go whatever want. smart it. Use hand washing. Wear mask, distance [yourself] you‚Äôre going visit elderly relatives immunocompromised friends. still important.

Just CDC said may 10 times cases (which btw best guess IFR therefore still remains unknown) mean state apply entire time since whole thing started. cases end ICU doubt. that's said. said headline misleading someone sees ICU 97% followed Covid, makes seem like reason hospital capacity fact Covid, that's case. Honestly wonder Vegas odds would a) US deaths end year, b) whether we‚Äôll shut economy (that‚Äôs hard thing quantify through)  great haircut protests April it‚Äôs relief I'm concerned COVID sewage. chance we're infecting ocean creatures? holy moly. guy constantly lies you. big small. time. sound strange...You realize global pandemic right? sure want people do? missed opportunity completely suppress it, real economic consequences rival damage pandemic maintain economic activity.

When test positive China, ""self quarantine"", quarantine enforced via human monitoring mandatory green checkmark app. mean what's point testing going anything result?

To test without enforced quarantine like fighting forest fire, going home finding fires. appropriate didn't.

Some hospitals did. Universal healthcare like Canada, Japan, France, U.K. already cheap enough affordable current U.S. tax dollars spent healthcare.

It would cheap enough give every man, woman child U.S. free healthcare like countries provide, $100 tax break, every month.  vaccine work, question becomes whether people develop long-lasting immunity. become re-infected, whether disease less severe severe.

Pause wrong word, they‚Äôre maintaining status quo advancing further. reopening / policy relaxing already place stay (for now) Hospitals make much money elective surgeries, hospitals always pretty full. hospital full people medical problems actually make mouth money compared one performing surgeries. did, you? says 28% ICU covid patients.

You confusing CFRs IFRs. 10.7% US moment slowly falling. question many people missing number US sucks testing. track current rate here: Ok, let rephrase. 

The media choose show images renforce narrative, case protesters wearing masks.

Another 3 weeks numbers continue see home Okay, fair enough. 

I meant East Asia well SEA countries. No. 124,864 deaths divided 20M cases case fatality rate 0.62%. That's right around epidemiologists estimating months. think roughly 1 160 chance dying ""really, really low,"" maybe different definitions. Well hospital make patients. Government loose restrictions TX did. Greed. beats me. story hospital. normally, year year out, runs minimum 80% ICU capacity. ICU overflow reserve used emergencies disasters, dips 80% execs start meetings get patients schedule surgeries.

This also 100% pre-covid capacity, much higher 3 months really ended unintentionally sounding alarm bell loudly capacity true all. Hospitals don‚Äôt make much money ICU stays. Hospitals definitely losing money lack appointments elective surgeries.

Every hospital red right now. Virus spread poor air circulation sharing food beverages maskless. 2 steps forwards, 22 steps back. Sweden never reached 100% utilization. pandemic Sweden tried maintain least 20% ICU buffer converting convention centers icus. 20% considered sort magic number get overwhelmed next day.

** Data inform definition close contact limited. Factors consider defining close contact include proximity, duration exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk), whether exposure person symptoms (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk).

***Data insufficient precisely define duration time constitutes prolonged exposure. Recommendations vary length time exposure, 15 minutes close exposure used operational definition. Brief interactions less likely result transmission; however, symptoms type interaction (e.g., infected person cough directly face exposed individual) remain important.

This intellectually dishonest, bad faith comment I'm going answer question anyhow.

It's average age infected. Right average age 37. Back April much higher.  sudden big push mandating masks? 

Three reasons. 

One, seeing exponential growth cases again. 

Two hospitals reaching max capacity again. Houston ICUs hospitals already full others projected peak 2-3 days. California 10 days max. Arizona 8 last heard. hospitals max capacity death rate goes LOT. 

And three, masks work prevent spread impact hospitals.

But let's pretend - seeking honest answers. Well know do...better slow testing  even happens, scream ‚Äúsomething something micro chip bill gates blah blah‚Äù never get vaccine anyway. Damn I‚Äôve crushing snorting them. worry. People fighting wear something simple mask. think going react get vaccine? actually great advice. Instead consenting idea ""I poor,"" try learn trade hobby. Make valuable current job go manager tell want pay responsibility take seriously. work somewhere possible, start looking new better job. get paid, save can. eat out, buy newest iPhone, buy things afford, children can't afford them, read take advantage local federal government programs, list goes on. advice may ""try poor,"" would ""don't let poor rob mindset change situation better. defeatist attitude almost always ends defeat. Damn, wish could speak wisdom governor VA.  Gay still derogatory rural USA wish I'd left country years ago. Oriellys Amazon pretty much massive warehouse fire mentioning unions. doesnt make sense force work free, decide ""clocked in"" documented. Anyone get test without symptoms True. Sadly, even 2020 Colorado fatter 1990 Mississippi :( don‚Äôt know. repeat question? Trumps‚Äô cronies get chance buy stock ammonia Flintstones-brand items first? happen first. Posted posting too. 

First off, trying diminish severity what's come Texas. People take seriously, unfortunately lot people suffer it. 

For perspective, Lubbock, Texas county population 310,000 665 ICU beds. TMC 1330. large medical center mean much, population Houston. yesterday, 72% ICU patients non-covid positive. places keep 100s beds empty, hospital does. national average 5 years ago around 66% large metros 77%. EU, occupancies range 61% (Greece) 95% (Ireland). again, populated/dense areas going run space faster. 

It's scary still, feel like people talking like crazy normal occupancy filled fast. UK built 4000 bed icu field hospital. Italy putting people hallways. Texas unfortunately similar stuff, though scary plans raising amount beds sustainable all. Marshall Law thing US mean Martial Law? news, water wet, sky blue geese spawn satan, sent destroy us. say owner give away shares? nowhere near simple, I'm talking ethical distribution among employees, means production.  Joplin sense social distancing all, live Webb city 2 min away here. question point far goes plays out.  Containment suppression strategy pretty much gone US point.

I think there's lot evidence somewhere 20-40% prevalence range burns (Italy, Spain, US Northeast, also predicted herd immunity formula using live Rt), 5-8% infected \*that\* bad. good either. 


There's also fact death rates trending downward. Possibly thanks harvesting effects, probably partially due improved medical care. Go home, White House, drunk. Late March symptom testing. 20,000 30,000 cases massive circumstances.  Burning flag indeed legal, burning flag throwing burning flag someone else not...which probably closer analogy choosing wear masks. like something magical ""beds"" make ICU capable.

When say ICU patients moved beds normally used critical care, means patients sick enough need ICU level care going moved PCU (a lower level care) treated PCU nurse may experience handle ICU-level patient. PCU's also equipment access doctors ICU has. Chances are, nurses taking care patients going heads patients going get quality care need. won‚Äôt take responsibility Well feel pretty happy helped get Trump üòé  Amazon people going realize companys dont give shit us. HIV ""Sexual Deviancy Virus."" Gay pride thing term derogatory enough. Covid vaccine candidates fall set brand new technologies:  Plasmid-DNA vaccines Virus vector vaccines. work similar fashion, insert new sections DNA human's cells (genetically engineering them) make cells produce foreign virus proteins, cell lines continue rest human's life (barring mutations death cell-line). 

 severe known consequences vaccines observed animal models (severe immune response leading organ failure, severe auto-immune disease, systemic inflammatory conditions).  way reverse genetic change cells. more, potential body become completely desensitized foreign protein resulting complete inability mount immune response pathogen future.  also permanent. virus vector vaccines, specific virus vector utilized vaccine treatment, body mount response vector never used genetic treatment. could prevent candidates otherwise proven therapies genetic disorders able cured disorders.

This whole rush create vaccine disease pandora's box could lead worse outcomes setting mass vaccination campaign brand new Schools need stay shut. Let's say school couple thousand students, CV-19 spreads it, handful die. one death could prevented much.  First off, trying diminish severity what's come Texas. People take seriously, unfortunately lot people suffer it. 

For perspective, Lubbock, Texas county population 310,000 665 ICU beds. TMC 1330. large medical center mean much, population Houston. yesterday, 72% ICU patients non-covid positive. places keep 100s beds empty, hospital does. national average 5 years ago around 66% large metros 77%.

It's scary still, feel like people talking like crazy normal occupancy filled fast. UK built 4000 bed icu field hospital. Italy putting people hallways. Texas unfortunately similar stuff, though scary plans raising amount beds sustainable all. They'll begging forgiveness families quarter million Americans next month. death toll already staggering. forgiveness atrocity scale. Thank goodness live reasonable state. recently ICU 3 days, almost died adrenal crisis. never ICU before. I'm ""regular"" hospital. sure hope state wears masks much possible keeps social distancing. good authority

On authority? percentage cases diagnosed symptomatic covid died

Patients died divided total patients diagnosed covid positive. obviously admit every patient diagnosed.

I got number member board northwell health. Hopefully state give tests. lockdown supposed flatten curve. dare contain virus hospitals even full! /s anyone else hear going give first two million shots black community. elderly volunteers want it. I‚Äôm white opinion hearing first thing think of, government using black community Guinea pigs yet again. information circulating around hospital. like think logically logically would give vaccine elderly first matter race. state, age groups, someone works special needs adults, stopped working. fact, place work hired new people.

So least here, population looked pandemic seem like stop. bit comforting. governor thinks we're going solve staff shortages bringing outside help... I'm like, think going get outside help come Florida, Texas, California also surges? Agree. China consistent friend Africa long time. believe China help them. 

America accept Chinese help, even would save American lives. Let's make 110% everything bigger Texas. Long story short, you‚Äôre absolutely right. It‚Äôs pretty bad getting better soon Farmed mink actually harmful natural mink populations. humane thing cull them. That‚Äôs funny way spell Yes We're fucked rest year brown one. neglected 6+ months died.

Texas New York could learn thing two Sweden. **Herd Immunity** best way get this. Sweden ZERO lockdowns, never saw hospital overruns likely build immunity way anyone else. need shift models asap. Ok I‚Äôd settle effective.

Essentially trapped toilet bowl. flush pulled.

Goodbye. Guess it‚Äôs time lock back down. Better reset unemployment. peak daily new hospitalizations, peak occupancy? looking capacity, need know latter. Shitty possibly something look into, regards workers' rights. 


But also stupid employees. ""I feel comfortable, I'm unpaid leave expect job whenever feel like coming back.""  Like shit got terminated. Unless agreed-upon timeline return position, Tesla supposed do? Screw employees position vacant for..how long?

 cost employees overall business allow keep position, offer expected benefits working there?


If line reason annoys you, realize attack worker. logical thought process *should* going part PTO sick leave usually clear definitions. Yep, spot-on. I've following pandemic news since January hit Italy became overwhelmingly clear shit joke!! Jenkins never made ‚Äú9 figure NBA player money‚Äù.

All article. Literal quotes. 

What wrong you? like get rage what?  Also world leading University Rice (the US) apparently trying allow virus 'burn through' (the President's words) population eventually achieve herd immunity. Nobody knows herd immunity might virus, 80% population infected immune would good guess. infection fatality rate covid-19 1% (estimates range 0.3% 1.3% least) means US alone 2.6 millions persons die. comparison, 1918 flu infected 28% population killed 675 thousand persons. current pandemic 'burns out' infecting 28% population (as 1918 flu) 924 thousand persons die.

Given demonstrated inability fractured political system effectively address emergency, rough ride. It‚Äôs hard it‚Äôs also available ducted homes. It‚Äôs even expensive. Olympic Village Tokyo (located Odaiba) used field hospital year. Cuomo? scroll far find little common sense topic? Thank they'll pay taxes healthy, productive members society. Locked down

Incorrect, never locked down, everything shut short except ""essential personnel"", large grey area. Black Lives Matter protests enforced curfew, Coronavirus prevention weak mostly relied people ""do right thing"". telling me. parents live Mexico, despite best efforts trying convince otherwise, way spend summer Arizona.

Mexico, despite robust medical system, way less cases much safer there. Mexico took pandemic seriously still strict restrictions place keep numbers Ugh. I‚Äôm worried friends acquaintances Houston. I‚Äôm even worried exes there. One asthma health conditions, lupus. wish governor wheels would wheel damn cliff.

I‚Äôm DFW area days gotta say, amount precautions I‚Äôve seen taken regular folks 0. Walk grocery store half folks don‚Äôt wear masks. Yesterday grabbing groceries saw guy fuckin sneeze right air wipe nose hand continue like it‚Äôs big deal. So, put groceries left. Guess I‚Äôm ordering online. 

Even friends claim worried taking seriously really aren‚Äôt. falling friend mad keep rejecting invites hang group. guy works security one social people know, can‚Äôt go day without hanging someone. chance hell.

Back envelope calculation based numbers taking values confirmed cases deaths Johns Hopkins dashboard get.

Hopkins: 2.45M cases | 125.7K dead

Assume 10x positive/exposed +10% undetected deaths: 24.5M infected | ‚âà137K dead

That gives mortality rate ‚âà0.56%

The heard immunity threshold (HIT) (per Wikipedia) COVID-19 29-74%. 

Let‚Äôs say HIT 50%. 

US population 331M. get 50% exposure, need ‚âà145M exposed. mortality rate correct, means ‚âà~~970K~~797K Americans die. 

Smh.

The data NY shows 90% intubated patients didn‚Äôt make it. actually wondering whether ventilation didn‚Äôt actually increase death rate.

So know intensive hospital care marginal effect, any, outcomes. guy gets paid shepherd.... Maybe. We, Michigan, roughly TX March Detroit area hospitals filled capacity medical system able offload lot patients areas thst capacity. people likely die also try send marginal cases home, possible get NYC/N Italy levels. That's Abbott pulls head ass, which.... yeah. phenomenon protests. early 20s teenager crew mostly asymptomatic prevent 2nd 3rd generation transmissions. know guy SF got GF, also lives someone protested.

they still think i'm odd one isolating wearing mask here. Nah, need missles, ships military grade weaponry ! fix healthcare problem! Same.. Source? Honestly thank sacrifices disaster. Things would much worse tens thousands people like you. 

Literally least could honor wear mask, keep distance, avoid unnecessary trips. really hard. 

Sorry country greedy, self-centered, stupid. know many, people still trying best limit spread virus. There's spike New York. spike Philadelphia. spike Chicago. enormous protests places, three solid weeks counting. 

It's protests. Protests outdoors, they're sun, protestors problem wearing masks. 

The data backing activities outdoors, sun, mask on, dangerous reopening businesses restaurants, places reopening businesses restaurants getting spikes, places protests. flattened curve, kidding. LEEEEEEROY!!!!! Good time put nail coffin Obamacare. Trump way, per article, it‚Äôs gone. It‚Äôs well. Thankfully 2021 anything could done.

Finally surgeon mother knew took didnt even know till pathology came back extremely infected. instantly felt better took long time recover lost almost 30 lbs (I wasnt weight prior looked almost anorexic). entire experience uncertain, sick, scared. family want keep taking hospital thought flu dramatic. cannot imagine would like happened now. Probably would get tested covid sent home negative. Probably would afraid even go could get sick going er... think surge already surging wtf. dumb. school district wants reopen August scared. Waiting Mr. Smart tell us next mask-less convention held. That's correct, way /u/AmbitionOfPhilipJFry worded post suggested equipment existed ICU floors period. Hey, another person understand population people speaking remark.

The people literally throwing surprise parties octogenarians people coughs enclosed house together hours? fun.

Sane people TX? heart goes you, trapped state full lunatics, lunatic state government lunatic federal government. heart breaks people trapped texas.

A lot people texas ARENT trapped, they're *actively perpetrating calamity*. fun. disaster already happening. Unless hospitals cameras miraculously malfunction proven nothing extra done. case said cameras would problem hospital. Also nurse probably put wrong name system, go get MRI X-Ray etc staff department puts name individual there‚Äôs multiple checks error found. least that‚Äôs works hospital. trying give general advice hope error taken care of. times create strong men. Strong men create good times. Good times create weak men. Weak men create hard times. 

We stage 4. Everybody unbelievably self absorbed preoccupied themselves. Focused society ""owes"" little consideration give back help people. would even wager majority people wearing masks want protect themselves. Florida cooking books try make look like ICUs filling actually bad thing. 

Completely deranged. sure would think makes Florida look good. post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

Prepare attempt herd immunity point. Busch Gardens encouraging customers buy tickets online ""to help maintain physical distancing""... Ok, may help ticket seller, much hundreds (or thousands) people waiting lines rides. can't stand 6 feet away people lines like standing mile away ride. I'm sure people wearing masks. 2% death rate. far, seems isolated work place covid outbreaks 100% testing known deaths tallied pointing around 1 2% death rate Covid. *someone* pays $900 Aspirin kick ass NJ come too? Vegas next ton national parks (Zion, Red Rock, Death Valley, western side Grand Canyon), desert kind beauty. won‚Äôt argue weather though, summers brutal winters great. 19131 looks like lockdown Sweden crowd ones mad protesters getting sick big numbers yet numbers right since start, blind spot. Meaning could adding subtracting ubiquitous grounds show particular outcome. sure leaves us... pander lot extreme left, maybe fear loud minority, people suffer without knowing. Take care fellow Americans. 

Here Spain I'd say 99% people wearing masks taking threat serious. Plus, every restaurant/office adapted social distancing.

I can't understand US citizens seem downplay deadly threat. mean, constantly seeing horror stories people dying TV? country case 24h/day.

People got scared, helped taking serious. seem scared? get it. Gottem I'm glad landed good company.

they everything limitations.

Helped peoples get government sick leave.(30 days get paid gov)

They gave employees 10 days paid vacation made 1 day working half day vacation.

We work full shift still pay us full almost full.

But future dose looks good gov dosent seem like going come anything help population lockdown fines...

Alot customers going bankrupt ones can't use service work home Maybe higher antibody rate could helped that. Also, many asymptomatics could completely cured extra long lockdown, spread asymptomatics could gotten rarer. I'm NJ (also one 4 states listed). Never problem anyone wearing masks inside socially distancing possible. Yeah people grumble know important. start putting ICU patients different units? LOL know like don‚Äôt want lie said terrible time either make scared. I‚Äôm going tell truth June April - ""April fools!"" Weird areas open safety measures keeping things control. Oddly specific ending there. Sounds like *someone* walked stepdad inopportune moment. Regular folks: ""Its nice summer there, lets go fun frien...""

Quarantine enthusiasts muzzlers: ""NO NO, FUN ALLOWED!!! FRIENDS ALLOWED! SWEAT, BLOOD TEARS!!!"" You‚Äôre paying endoscope, you‚Äôre paying *know* stick endoscope Depressingly true. clear huge proportion Americans lift finger help others causes slightest inconvenience. Maybe always case, depressing realization always assumed people would altruistic emergency. Yet I'm every part ""like did."" see little evidence American culture less like past now. Americans* ""groundbreaking"" mean written meatheads? destroyed jobs, dead grandparents, miserable family. bet every state suddenly coughing true scope death toll soon intend get park? Car accidents kills lot people day. Risky. LOL. Right. find anything good there? Gov Abbott resign. LOT stupid useless people Philly metro well LOL. everywhere.  Interesting - didn‚Äôt know posting consistently evangelical Christian subreddits made liberal. hey, that‚Äôs ok. I‚Äôm pretty centrist political test take tend make sides accuse sympathetic other. friends middle. price, better Egyptian import water. 15 infected conning China, everything control... Medical debt doesn‚Äôt match weight. That's China wants... went protest LA last week didn‚Äôt see 1 person without mask. know everyone properly masked, transmission rate 1.5%. So, yeah, believe protests responsible majority cases. people protesting muh freedoms didnt help much. know Jewish person mean can't participate racism. hide behind human shield. Keeping tributes crimes humanity perfect comparison. like compared Nazi, make less true.

I cared statues trump. issue since made. Yeah. read hit send. Anywho referencing something else totally screwed up. lol Russia Turkey praised long ago right thing avoiding pandemic. 

What situation today represent situation month. NY cases said logically get human DNA major travel hub there, shouted one person made death threat saying that. Texas Medical Center. medical district. 1 hospital. 21 hospitals.  don‚Äôt exceptional amount excess mortality compared states. economy going tank matter -- see Sweden [which offered test problem dealing virus makes impossible get US economy back speed. safe, people know spending money. economy function 20-30% risk takers seem care. countries go back prosperous much quicker US, we'll still mired virus.  Old, white haired man seat power giving us wrong information.. never seen  Overlay daily cases daily deaths. almost exactly graph, couple weeks apart. seems like half country gaslit years years

Well put. roots current crisis reach far past, many present issues caused changes leadership since 1980 so.  Leaders deluding forcing public go along them.  caring people study years take care them. Besides understand proves take better care disabled people? take food plate. puts food others plates. one day might 95 year old. even 40 year old disabled. what? still gonna argue better care need? sterile like taste NY took 3 weeks officially shut peak. obviously play different roles society. live Ontario mastectomy planned early August. mastectomy remove breast lymph nodes affect cancer considered urgent would happen ""even hospital burning down"" said oncologist. prophylactic mastectomy non-affected breast immediate reconstruction breasts considered elective happen contingent hospital bed capacity due pandemic. HUGE benefits patient healthcare system done time. party controlling government right fucking joke put prison much death caused. Blood goddamned hands. Fuck them. one NEEDS football ... get hobby bruh -Alabama alum *Dying: live it.*

Got it.  Houstonian scares damn work home health Staffing Director always available ‚Äúemergencies‚Äù even though they‚Äôre rarely emergencies. better call staff went pretty bad ones. Hopefully. let everyone get it. over. delaying inevitable. Pence pulled gerbil ass, saw shadow, COVID-19 eradicated! Hallelujah! apply? Elon great first wife? ""Guys, time I'm asking *pretty* please. I'm also pleased announce we'll fining Riot House Scottsdale $2500, cost reserving one table bottle service, minus tips."" Hell fuckin yeah many men idolize athletes.... give guys testosterone idolizations stop. Real talk, absolutely loathe payment ""hero credit"" bullshit. dont get away *as much* nurses ems workers, holy shit get skin. That's basically majority paramedic's pay in, telling hero, make difference, happy measly earnings. Worse yet medics seem get idea working hard making small amounts money sort toxic rugged individualism nonsense. 

I feel bad people getting paid hero credits due covid didnt sign job known pay way, like grocery store workers subjected bullshit right now.  Online classes easily work.

The problem is, students going pay huge tuition rates Universities charge they're getting online courses. huge part product sell environment learning, interaction students teachers, new experiences, etc.

Having online course lot better watching Youtube videos, people pay much it.

Universities going hurting lot soon. there's subset American population would never actively look murder you, seems perfectly fine culling people like population

you see, think ""unproductive"" member society laughed tad hard this. gf - "" believe planned foretold bible yet?"" 

No. planned greed never changed. I'm researcher TMC. called back beginning June. said we'd least July, reversed course due politics. They've divided us shifts reduce people present, thermal cameras take temperature walk &amp; mandatory PPE. I'm still coming contact many people lockdown (when working behave lockdown never ended).

I yell dipshit engineer yesterday working one mass spectrometers mask flapping jaws. could think is, guy campus cancer hospital careful time? Also, nearly impossible social distance room packed 7 mass spectrometers.

Another thing really irks institution sends out
regular e-mails sentences like, ""Covid-19 rapidly spreading throughout community unsustainable pace."" Immediately followed by, ""We look forward pushing next phase reopening continue monitor data.""

What fuck purpose monitoring data completely ignore it? That's fucked! state, mind asking? Thank you! Also look this: madness. allowed? New York, term PAUSE serious referred shutting things down

""PAUSE stands Policies Assure Uniform Safety Everyone. According governor, 100 percent non-essential workers must stay home, non-essential businesses must close""

It sounds like guy wants use word pauae used NY, actually want implement policy/program Indeed. Yea one seems get this. They‚Äôll make another 10 beds somewhere else ‚ÄúICU‚Äù  Ah, admission defeat. Feels good. Thanks pick-me-up! wish studies precise, mild symptoms may mean cold may mean everything short hospitalization doctor. 400,000+ US cases outcomes yet. CFR confirmed US cases ~6.3%. That's another 25,000 deaths cases (so well say ~150,000 US deaths said done 20 million infected).

In addition that, excess death statistics show missed 15% COVID related deaths. true death toll therefore likely 172,000 20,000,000 infected.

That gives IFR 0.86% I'd argue opposite; treat elderly like kind museum merely make feel better alive I'm reality ore often sent taken care others, rarely see loved ones live depression riddle shell themselves, often unable even take care + what? feel good making stay alive beyond meaningful life? Bruh that's brutal existence. What's value life worth living? wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúpeak‚Äù yet. ‚ÄúHighest far,‚Äù maybe.

I agree lucky nearing hot summer. Come winter, immune systems less effective. shall see enter cold season: surfing wave higher higher, leveling off. Tru dat. really think fair compare things. People still able communicate person wars famine happening, exception sent actually fight war. Pretty much feel right now. countries debating banning travel US poorly handled. honestly 100% banning us now, it‚Äôs completely control here. Aye, blew mind see y'all still sign credit card transaction. Seems outdated. quest begins Well shit. Confused, would blacklisted from
a hospital? BF nurse NY brought travel nurses. able stay little longer, knew temporary.  startlingly common occurrence, unfortunately. lot people get hit surprise bills doctor sees officially affiliated hospital. beyond messed up. ER, even hospital general, ask doctor, ""hold on, network? No? GTFO then."" Hey, care. first time fight South. üôÉ Sounds similar physical therapy sessions are. many stretches Pilates core strengthening stuff well. It‚Äôs already helping I‚Äôm hoping full recovery. particular ones found helped? I‚Äôd love advice experienced. reads like talking 45 year old wasted alumni 7 PM homecoming We‚Äôre still moving full steam ahead too. I‚Äôm unemployment total life saver tbh. kicking don‚Äôt job searches...look want work, preferably old job. job searches right essential services would put others risk virus. Wtf? It‚Äôs aggravating see Abbot‚Äôs smiling face tv. Reminds much ‚Äúhappy doofus‚Äù look Bush tanking country. Ms state department officer dr Dobbs said they‚Äôve testing steady amount. Expects things bad fall. nice virus give us weekends off!

/s crappy headline. mean, ""Previously Thought""--by whom? guess people believed people managed get test come positive COVID? anyone US News really ""previously think"" this? risk serious injury motorcycle accident greater 80%. wearing helmet, near 100%. risk serious complications Covid 0.05%. I've already explained hyperbole. big words difficult, always google them. would 0.6% infection fatality rate... inside range antibody tests revealed areas. make light school mass shooting way, killed way, way, less Covid killed last week NYC alone. run numbers I'll bet ""years human life lost"" still get similar result. one thing guaranteed say:

We wrong. hit 40 thousand cases. Never thought would get point. Seems like catching virus early get treated may smart move^/s HIV? So, he's gay, gay men have, had, HIV. also blood donation questions IV drug use visiting certain countries number things increase likelihood blood born illness. 

No idea often rules reviewed updated seems like headline trying generate outrage. Well, guess keep brown bagging using camping hammock ""It's living!"" ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø might right, sure hurt use non n95 no? Duh? CDC, NIH, testing bedrock federal response. Instead got shit. northeast mostly like this, exception want everybody sign they're names list ""mask"" ""no mask"" come work?  going citation that? Citation me. see hundreds people 5 days week. am, people wide margin scoff masks. Houstonian, that‚Äôs fucking terrifying.  Ah, yes, college still touting ""fully in-person experience"". God, I'm exhausted. really need wont turn away. Tell take precautions. cool another 15 minutes self congratulatory remarks Wapple?? bright side went HEB today get stuff. Literally 100% mask usage. Gave small bit hope White House‚Äôs Corona Anti-Mask Force tell 'em. interesting, thanks!  Nah. aren‚Äôt purely obstinance. Peru giving choice. 

The south dumb assholes refuse listen reason. hope every reporter asks question repeatedly November‚Äîif still testing (which I‚Äôm sure are) defunding test sites middle current persisting tsunami. really keep driving point home, expose already themselves. I‚Äôm sure Kaley best answers continuing serve shitting rest us.
Yep, time revolution, can‚Äôt take much more. Totally ready.  Nah, he'll gun grab red flag laws, expand welfare state, pump money student subsidies oversight, get us another pointless war six. Open borders known criminals gang members. Maybe pump war drugs nonsense without addressing opiates coming from, etc. SSDD. 

Biden's idiot, family idiots. know, cousin went business one biden brothers. met AA. LoL still, made bank, not? Protestors deserve blame, Florida beach goers. Many wearing masks parties gathering close Who? US? /s Ultra violet light needs time effective. air rushing duct work, see working.. also, biggest transmission factor direct transmission, way important inforce masks social distancing instead spending rediculous amounts money try sanitize moving air [GET STOCK MAKET Medical professionals know students. Oh god cannot even imagine. sorry pandemic economic downturn. heart goes you. family needs money ffs. lockdown crushed economy. Think it; would feel safer country strict lockdown rules, one anything goes like Sweden?

People feel unsafe tend take even extreme measures protect themselves, know can't depend government. restaurants open, custmers dare go in? Reading reminds reading news March.

I live New York. problem we're bouncing mountain GOP let us grab ropes would burn arms, slow fall. humans....you mean Americans able yoga regularly, yoga stretches extend muscles along sciatic nerve. multiple times day.


I managed get sciatica pain go away really bad bout. realize vast majority covid positive diagnoses nyc done without testing, right? early days testing rolled out. call doctor, tell symptoms, diagnoses phone tells stay home rest. Remember that? Deaths divided positive tests equal cfr.  would surprised Quebecers Albertans weren‚Äôt wearing masks.  getting upvoted? It‚Äôs obvious they‚Äôre bit confused one. Remember certain people declaring covid would magically disappear summer came? wonder people going fare come November? think need less laissez faire attitude. Sure may standard procedure, maybe time challenge that. test blood plasma use it...there literally reason turn usable donations middle pandemic. may true general wards outpatient care, that‚Äôs incredibly wrong ICU. Typically, nurses 2:1 patients, really sick patient who, example, needs continuous dialysis 1:1 care. guess what? lot patients ending renal replacement therapy. Almost ICU nurses know basic ventilator care, fraction nurses also trained certified handle dialysis circuit. issue less ventilator management, renal replacement management. Weirdly said today uk. USA always win. fucked Brexit go trump in, fucked corona went outdid us see current spike end 10-14 days **if** start preventative measures **NOW** may may cap surge capacity. not, full steam ahead means surge capacity easily met plus some. Love truth gets voted proclaim followers science.  main news mainstream media? 90? going stop putting complete utter bullshit? explain insurance works Check LA times. Statewide went 4% 5.5%. great charts lots statewide data good amount data broken county city levels. conversation months ago!? Well, death actually certain outcome. matter when. go twitter. Why? It‚Äôs like virus ravaging south anything. I‚Äôm college high school couple years ago. guys don‚Äôt know virtual learning like. It‚Äôs person classes don‚Äôt get education can‚Äôt make friends easily don‚Äôt reopen.

Yes, health important need weigh sides focus number cases alone. Weird, could seen coming? happened elsewhere, recently exact virus?

Stupidity like many people buying firearms, everyone assuming worst case scenario types things validate thoughts concerns. no, near total. ""Declining severity"". Yeah, that's COVID-19 hospitalizations skyrocketing right now, disease getting *less* severe exactly 11% resolved cases states resulted death. Pull head Trumps ass. I‚Äôm Maryland I‚Äôve seen everyone wearing mask indoors. Granted, half stick noses out. outdoor use nonexistent. cases declining I‚Äôll hold judgment people. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Thanks. can‚Äôt believe made error. It‚Äôs started getting medical advice people MBAs instead medical degrees. helps awareness Florida fucked Well yeah, Broadway closed months need jobs. /s Hold beer.

No worries. We're going 50k day next week. Welp.....I spending money company feel pain 7-day rolling average US new cases. Right column daily difference. Typically stops increasing half way peak bottom. really looking scary, know high peaks, going go time, minimum would \~47000 day increase starts dropping today.

[Edit: Didn‚Äôt father Alzheimer‚Äôs? rules changed last couple years. know long someone catches sheds virus/is contagious date symptom onset? feel like lot statements hinge assumption every single one cases stays mild. do, sure whatever, stop making people sick might mild. don't, well, numbers absolutely matter used informative measure. Headline misleading. Read article weren't. Jesus, read article. Things fine Houston. There's plenty capacity. That‚Äôs fair take. Hospitalizations number one metric really DISABLED PEOPLE OLD! I'm 26 disabled. helping disabled people? I‚Äôm Boston couples times I‚Äôve atleast 80%+ people see wearing masks Police unions deserve title ""union"". I‚Äôve thinking since start. Jeez that‚Äôs depressing. There's intelligent (which man clearly is) there's exercising good judgement. always go hand hand. *laughs public healthcare* Wow. many people dead people came back announcement? death rate today exactly yesterday? nobody coming back people still dying higher numbers yesterday. that's said CA's early response.

Even then- CA's growth almost Los Angeles county. Northern California San Diego numbers actually quite low. 

The Bay area maybe 9million people roughly 22k testing positive. Los Angeles county hand 11million 90k testing positive. 4x positive cases. Sooo, aren‚Äôt watching every country five eyes telling China fuck off?

[China's Huawei build $1.2 bln British research Then... out..... don‚Äôt touch  sub...everything response virus political. America disaster economic standpoint, public health one. people charge need go, immediately. screwed.  Hang on, listen, shush listen, guys hear that? listen closely? that's sound impending lockdown coming bullet-train speed. worried financial collapse, right? Good thing thew Tesla cars around humans won't. Stupid mother fuckers. That's happens define leadership ""who make money"" opposed ""who effectively lead manage business"". There's profits Survivors guilt awful, children don‚Äôt take death peers well rare. Children also can‚Äôt fully evaluate risk, tend take responsibility things aren‚Äôt fault (my parents divorced one time car spilled ice creams fight). 

I see lot children school death blaming themselves. Probally Texas, July August. Mondays too! He‚Äôs good chap Dust off, it‚Äôs 2020 Don‚Äôt forget part hire back, don‚Äôt even give amount making lower wage know you‚Äôre desperate. be. 

we also enough testing/tracing. 

I thought discussion done, currently done. Because, yes, done. HEB pretty solid mask rules since beginning I've seen, I'm honestly shocked Imagine fucking stupid ended killing several members family. Since decided open businesses again, Quebec reduced number tests (before = 10,000 tests more) 5,000 tests show people cases decreased. decide show number anymore day decided open bars casinos .. yes shady! 
I always read news read comments Facebook Quebec news channel ‚ÄúYoutube expert‚Äù believe Covid19 all.. Umm...in county hits peak weeks ago deaths. Sorry d00mer goes gold medal! /S/ New Orleans probably either Mardi Gras tourism general. can‚Äôt country economy keep locked down. guys propose keep country going everything kept locked down?

You hate schools reopen 4h July protests across country? live free country, dictatorship run Putin Looking billboard tell point attack hospital putting wealth health public laying nurses.  it‚Äôs group people beach goers, protestors, restaurant, grocery visitors, people don‚Äôt wear masks don‚Äôt social distance go places. See didn‚Äôt read first comment way explained it. yes everyone wear one protect fellow humans. comment meaning say mayor stating whites wear masks yet races didn‚Äôt putting health risk spreading frequently amount minority populations instead saying it‚Äôs mandatory everyone wears one don‚Äôt feel comfortable don‚Äôt wear one. personally think everyone should.

‚ÄúAmong‚Äù amount need Sherman time. south burning ground.

Shame. ‚ÄúI guess look like we‚Äôre something‚Äù even profit colleges. Even land grant schools swollen years easy money guaranteed student loans, point they've got heavy bureaucracies addicted cash flow.

They literally can't change, bureaucracy ever voluntarily reduces size. Sooo, aren‚Äôt watching every country five eyes telling China fuck off? Cause am, mean Canada told fuck regards to
The Huawei CEO.... Five Eyes run world Let us taunt VIRUS! may become cross make mistake. I‚Äôm better now. happened last fall healed within 3 weeks. I‚Äôm terrified happening again, though, know run family dad struggled decades. I‚Äôm constantly lifting carrying three year old it‚Äôs matter time.

I‚Äôm glad found ways cope. probably could benefited physical therapy. even getting car killed me. love people try ""informal sanction"" wearing mask social distancing. hardly ever happens always entertained does. 55k Oct. 1st Virginia, mask ""mandate"" enforced. Less less people wearing them. working without enforcement. Kinda makes think got money itü§îü§îü§î show source please? Like actual link? go outside smart safe it. get outdoor social time weather favor. So, one hospital full. Texas Medical Center one facility, no? politics rule uniformly applied see. incompetence expected. people willing drag life long possible order make living mean practice unethical.

If 95? odds death given year 25%. virus 2 years, there's roughly 45% chance die anyway... what... live unfulfilling, depressed boring life? honesty, feel badly happened 4 months rather weeks. Hospitals ready live Massachusetts... surge hospitals different regions (some used, barely used, used all)... medical ships government, hospitals shut using floors Covid only.... (which I‚Äôm sure Texas start lock down) far help seems gone. Texas own, vs northern cities getting immense help start. Yes, opened quickly, numbers time made hard keep shut going. never surge first place. Could predicted one, course... it‚Äôs hard justify loss business, loss finances, loss house... something happening 1500 miles away. east coast hit hard right away, made people bend guidelines. Texas never hit didn‚Äôt understand  one one helping saying selfish. Well selfish coming China (I remember looking reddit December)... happening Italy... god sakes stop assholes want help them. I‚Äôm talking New York Minnesota, exemple you‚Äôre right protests cities. again, weren‚Äôt (at least yet) surges cities. dude, states learned New York fucking 3 months ago. Finally, use old crack pipe! literally said already still one person hospitalized county. Sorry d00mer. miss playing poker. setting foot casino I'm vaccinated. Sitting table 9 people covid-chips passed around. thank you. Well, good news is, curve flattened! 
Bad news is, it‚Äôs along wrong axis. it‚Äôs flat! Funny, everyone saying opposite MAGAs protesting. It‚Äôs almost like media political full bullshit.  worry, wealthy still get care. imagine stuck enclosed metal tube 6 hours corona floating around cabin.. ugh. I'm flying anywhere next year least Trump likes name shit let‚Äôs call trump virus You‚Äôd surprised folks sub don‚Äôt think masks legit. day Texan told friend's grandma got it, knows real now, grandma lived, we're going ok.  Nice picture four assholes. Excess deaths vs typical years like. Scroll halfway see graphs pink Im adding this, son licks hands clean them, spn. difficult times( first year life hospital o2 quarantined 3 yrs therafter), sending siblings back onsite school fall. I'm wondering people put ICU need intensive care people put bit prematurely. requirements whether someone needs doesn't? concern children spreading virus go back home, getting sick themselves. know bald eagles don‚Äôt screech? actually sound like seagulls. television dub sound hawk. Did.... dox yourself? Interesting - seems like important issue isn‚Äôt Covid cases standalone basis, poor depth US healthcare system, least regionally. It‚Äôs talked US quite ICU beds per capita - might seeing here. 40,000 per month low? 3 months amount COVID deaths roughly one whole year gun deaths + car deaths + flu deaths. low? Wear mask, social distance... open.

ITS SIMPLE

giant protests, masked... Lead ZERO increase cases. States politicizing wearing masks fucked. 

The uncomfortable conversation avoidable shitstorm linger economically keep crying freedoms per mask useage. wreck state. can't suck community... lock again... worse, wont. drags next year. Good luck.

You're busy looking libs blame. conservative. need leadership this. need wear masks. believe me? Pay attention 3 weeks. reality ground care liberal... concerned whether weak come together community. confirm quality life gets little better bidet. Isn‚Äôt definition corrupt? feel like really could take Russia Indonesia corruption. No, can‚Äôt bribe police officers - things may better could - But, large scale profit life quality corruption system government feels odd charts. false security thinking control So, bye-bye, Miss American Pie, Drove Chevy levee levee dry good old boys drinkin' whiskey rye, singing: this'll day die, this'll day die Wait wait, don‚Äôt let hook here.

The experts listened to, remember stock market profits made immediately briefings?

Oh, folks charge listened acted, benefit. I'm sick, I'm well Damn. I‚Äôm healthcare worker worn masks entire career pre covid. didn‚Äôt know much damage body entire time /s So...god damn rung? /s girlfriend friend work hung time. health scare became vegan started watching much YouTube shit Vegan Alex Jones. scared know believe believe. 

When understanding science let alone medical knowledge become victim crack pots con artists. Watch United States opposite? Im amazed people dismiss stuff like propaganda. okay question things like this. effecting us. doesnt matter side on, people vs. bullshit. heard all, end word flu. Ive gone insane trying find truth this, surrounding area SoCal, friends working ER certain hospitals saying maxed out. also hear friend family lives Florida.  think middle ground, virus real problem, blown way proportion media politicians fear panic gives control. understand thats conspiracy, god damn dude, arent healthy, die virus regardless name virus.  People Rioting Peacefully protesting across country. Hollywood Blvd jam packed shoulder shoulder protestors. think isnt cause spikes dont know tell you. funny live here. Gotta start hoping real hard Gulf Atlantic seaboard spared upcoming normal hurricane season. Healthcare workers throws nightmare, utmost respect someone lived 100% capacity. number means little anyone may familiar ICU.

These patients incredibly sick nurses probably caring three critically ill patients. patients intubated movement causes become unstable. central lines A-lines multiple meds sedate them. paralyze them, maintain blood pressure well anticoagulants patients clot. Insulin drips multiple drips require cautious titration. patients proned requiring multiple staff turn onto stomachs sometimes days develop pressure injuries faces breasts. feeding tubes foley catheters. need frequent blood draws ABG's multiple ABX therapies. patients allowed family nurse healthcare team must advocate patients support devastated families afar.

The faces disease mothers fathers sisters brothers. husbands wives grandparents people lives. people families full lives. races age groups. come every group individuals people love dying.

This certainly anabridged description quite describe devastating disease is. changes change every healthcare worker touches MDs, RNs, PCAs, PT/OT, SLP, Environmental Services, Transport, Nutrition, Turn Team, I'm sorry forgot anyone live nightmare together. us seeing decreasing numbers, always carry memories wish hope never see another surge. starting fight, god bless stay strong. stand fight fellow warriors fight lifetime.  Oh right totally thought would pandemic highly contagious respiratory virus found pregnant last October /s ""We feel unions represent associates best interests""


Why get decide that? Listen offense nurses I've seen nurses training before. bright always expect greatest takes science. 

This stop nurses either. Doctors dumbass too. hell gonna doctor accept evolution It‚Äôs protesters  I‚Äôm New Yorker I‚Äôm pissed. good reason Houston isn‚Äôt prepared considering world witnessed New York endure months. freezer trucks, lack PPE, mental exhaustion - mean nothing? ban Americans lol I‚Äôm great. great? great lot people arrested state protests. Look up. üòè imagine people hitting flu season time first wave crippling hospitals. back square one... mean silver. It‚Äôs like sending house red one glass couple see across room.

Give sketchy ‚Äúwe‚Äôll approve anybody‚Äù car advertisements drop front dealership. Funny, saw two different videos ""overwhelmed"" ICU Elmhurst still empty think saw Italy Spain made up?

I think saw Italy Spain combination high population density, old populations, horrible governance, terrible medical systems, MSM propaganda. Overall mortality even significantly Italy think moon landing real?

That said, Nationalize hospitals soon appreciate caring, nice gesture. assure you, though, US country people questioning masks/distancing/lockdowns. good friend moved US Aus, parents tell town idiots protested there, too. tried injecting light?

No masks basically anywhere, job sees going bars pretty full. one literally anyone wearing mask besides myself.

Most others told wear mine always reply ""I'm good."" yet new cases slowed considerably Illinois get go phase 4 governors plan.

Masks magically gonna stop virus. stuff honestly important Yes no. could perhaps argue taken surprise months ago. Doctors stumped, didn‚Äôt even PPE. though, excuse many deaths happen.

On positive side, people getting infected today younger (close bars please), PPE better treatment protocols.

Stay safe yonder.  Docter: ICU covid... point young people don‚Äôt wear masks sacrificing others sake happy hour. yeah- kick em out. Didn‚Äôt actually get corona? can‚Äôt remember.  Take look Marshall County Alabama. 180 cases last 3 days averaging 10 20 months. event BLM protest 2.5 weeks ago. agree 100% think places need AC live summer hurt next months Build wall That's actually fucking retarded.

They saying loud clear working triage plans deny care people believe likely survive.

Put mortal fear people, maybe start taking things seriously. sister planning surprise party neice several friends weekend. Tampa.... rising cases since early June, three weeks ago, would death rate increase directly related before. There's good reason believe death per cases going down, whether testing less deadly infections, better treatment, can't say. Many people surprised many doctors nurses absolutely idiotic nuts regarding science. mean, plain bonkers.

You'd think med/nursing school would weed but, nope, common.

I especially liked ICU nurse knew convinced covens satan worshipers eating babies, put curses people ICU needed exorcism whatever.   Worst day far. There's always tomorrow... slows bit, actually travel... yeah moving time Wooo it, USA number one. 
Brazil looking like contender minute knew would come back strong. don‚Äôt want sound shitty say likely spikes cause spikes states well people wear masks social distance? freedumbs!  decently trained bot, human. Uhm, think getting herd immunity. many people smart enough go get virus, reach herd immunity numbers.

Plus asymptomatic people's antibodies hanging around couple months, so... think bodes well herd immunity, either.

Things get lot worse, though. Half-Italy achieved. One month Full-Italy achieved. Okay.

Look....

Bullshit.

They contributed. whole ‚Äúvoting‚Äù thing got us mess first place. agree remove means necessary, additional action MUST taken. mean.. would ask Doctor reddit lol read insights it:

* People afraid new norm want lose old ways living. 
* shows afraid people want look afraid therefore weak. instinctive mammalian instinct.

This kinda like earlier people interpreted numbers excluding NY, NJ, CT states getting clapped. comment needs You‚Äôve articles thoughts perfectly I‚Äôm enraged form clearly haven't. No, not.

Anyone conscious either pulse breathing treated. reaches war time medicine protocols, elderly people people serious health conditions likely given bed order successfully treat highest number patients possible. happened Italy March. warned would eventually happen America, laughed, we‚Äôre hit threshold. Oh know, I'm optimistic here. I‚Äôm Cape people, towns, businesses seem taking things seriously! Masks compulsory everywhere indoors enforced. Block chain gonna shit Keep mind Texas big. many areas Texas experiencing Houston Dallas experiencing moment. really need action focused area particular. American materialist mindset. Nothing new   You‚Äôre hell surprise end hospital

The test supposed covered, that‚Äôs it. Well heard boofing? effective orally. certain days experienced temporary jumps new cases following start protests, number new cases city generally trended 10 new cases Tuesday, June 23, roughly 98% decrease new daily cases since May 28 guys, many cases testing. don‚Äôt test, new cases. Duh! He's obviously speaking broadly general population. course apply every individual. didn‚Äôt hit south. didn‚Äôt large amounts people death total low. don‚Äôt see point mask weren‚Äôt affected everything shut down. seen waste time money. Bay area pretty good this, I'm glad live area general social expectations mask-wearing alignment own. People generally wear masks public, unless walking dog uncrowded street, crossing side avoid sharing air. would extremely hard psychologically live place true. American states lock borders neighbouring states like European nations did? think you‚Äôre proving point. You‚Äôre claiming China ‚Äúdefinitely did‚Äù manipulate numbers, haven‚Äôt provided proof credibility lol :-) US slow ramping testing, correct? He‚Äôs got bunker hide trying gloat brag, I‚Äôm actually proud Canadian government crisis. People got laid due COVID receiving $2000 per month, plus one time payment $1000. It‚Äôs much, enough pay bills, it‚Äôs better $1200 one time payment. Best luck American brothers. song lip dub? Everytime folk mention fastest vaccine ever four years, hence expect faster, think vaccine nobody would ever expected four years ever happen! Records meant broken!

I guarantee there's never level time money poured finding vaccine something either. already set record. absolute piece shit month ago someone told Texas alright. testing increase cases mean virus control. even see badly get fucked yet. LA county residence states entirety. surprising numbers high. Yep, sad seeing many people without masks calling thing hoax. really wish people would take virus seriously (including President Trump). Oh lord hospital San Jac? That's terrible hear. Sweden praised anymore. dropping like flys there. Well we've black folks getting lynched also horrifying distracting. obvious answer correct one. philosophical psychological implications dying infecting people community? It‚Äôs cotton mask FFS. There‚Äôs ethical excuse wearing one. People arguments seat belts. skeptical too? Yea called flu valve every year. greater shit participation w would little fly session (except years guess wrong stain spread year). 

Yea. tons historical examples. Every single year. 

Or could lol disease we've vaccinated against. Chicken pox respiratory (which arbitrarily set limit on) R0 10 without Balmain, compared 2 4 typical widespread flu. Yet kids places widespread vaccination get chicken pix anymore. that's vaccination works. 

If little lucky,we could vaccine available March. Then,if people get vaccine, largely stop. Maybe die entirely, pandemics contained contact tracing isolation,but numbers small. 

So yea, rooms scabies Fein every year Baine vaccines preventing respiratory viruses, canines preventing much virulent disease covid 19. 7 years old diagnosed rare immunodeficiency disorder... way 12, recieved monthly bone marrow transplants get immune system working again. lasted 5 years. turn 17, almost 5 years since finished treatments... past 5 years, normally functioning immune system. think affect chances beating covid get it? Im sure... dont actively disorder anymore, still years back... im really sure... also, really affect chances fighting covid, bad heart disease, cancer, diabetes? words, bad risk factor immunodeficiency recovered years?  look Peru happy good results.

The mistake made isolate homes elderly. course, would mindset. lot things rotten us political system.

Why can't advocate mask, example. still seen spike anti-lockdown protests either thousands social distancing wearing masks. fact might HIV bill years celebrating ignorance stupidity sent collections time US pay up. pro masks masks? really hope US vaccine properly vetted

I'm somewhat surprised Trump pushed one given Americans already aren't, stop lying dipshit serious headline leads believe. things became truly dire, patients without covid could relocated 100% beds hospital could dedicated ICU Covid patients.

Right covid patients go ICU rooms ""negative pressure"" virus air prevented spreading parts hospital. 100% patients covid, negative pressure benefit longer relevant hospital converted Northern Italy covid warzone hospital staff risk. 


This probably next move. thought primarily spreading indoors. Think effects air conditioning Marlins years I'd contact HR principal. wife track embryo IVF transfer August heard anything district plan keeping us safe. otherwise healthy friend struggling months later lung heart issues. Yeah sure send back. I‚Äôm sure grandma‚Äôs/grandpa‚Äôs/mom‚Äôs/dad‚Äôs death caused kids bringing COVID school really helpful learning!

/s town?   Hasn‚Äôt month. Average onset symptoms 5 days. protests truly superspreader event, we‚Äôd well level 4 5 already (for part). Starkly different whatever it‚Äôs ‚Äúa hoax‚Äù that‚Äôs gonna ‚Äúdisappear miraculously April weather warms up‚Äù /s It‚Äôs right here. Seeing people taking seriously taking sacrifices, quarantining, missed birthdays gatherings, lost jobs, it.. taking huge shit it. It‚Äôs massively disrespectful. It‚Äôs worst day since yesterday. Thank you, logic still exist guess time tell. Hopefully gets better. Take care. read article would explain that, ICU beds normally 70-80% capacity given day. said would expand ICU regular hospital beds.  America always unholy trinity ""fuck you,"" ""fuck yeah,"" ""we're fucked."" 20? Texas today. None anything fact 1900 jump deaths one day make reasonable sense anyone paying even slightest attention what's going on. Elective surgeries also require PPE hospitals conserving treat covid-19 patients. Pausing elective surgeries means PPE folks treating covid-19 patients. .... Mohd p moxl Say guy I'm responding to. want going outside, can't things. ""I want pay someone else!""

You already do, that's fucking insurance works. 

Only difference current system get shit results. Lowes well...the horrors place... good one irresponsible student gets virus creates chain reaction. Daughter fcker.

FTFY hope right.

Btw apologize original post sounded angry resentful anything. intention make. worried sake future needed vent frustrations. Says who? I‚Äôm literally buying individual currently found data backing up. pay ~750$/month 2 adults directly medical mutual don‚Äôt see hard data would affect someone like me. I‚Äôm defending all, think he‚Äôs total shitbag ruin tons people‚Äôs health insurance; I‚Äôm sure see direct correlation premiums instantly changing I‚Äôm program related ACA so. we're listening anymore. next weeks, US exterminating several thousand poorest inhabitants.

The virus getting ""cranked good"" across deep south. poorest states, large black populations. areas may actually black majority, generations gerrymandering, voter suppression, every kind oppression think several truly hope can't, voiceless vulnerable people US.

The 'rona running 4 1, heard weeks ago, day, somebody's daughter, doctor, said rural south worse, closer 6 black lives taken every white one.

Some travelled visitors, like UN delegation years ago, sometimes compare parts region places Sub-Saharan Africa, always favorably.

These people able go north war, since. among folks one finds slavery ""reframed"" ""ended.""

I'm sure I'm making comment. looking 6 ways Sunday kin, matter many ordinals removals away, see pool pennies scrounge way way get least city, least chance getting hospital God forbid, need one.

If US, people there, might want can. protesters spend one twelve hours protesting went straight home, spending time getting something eat drink hanging people went met protests?

Anyways, protests spreading virus they're outside people wearing masks, see outdoor activities allowed. Nope! I'm like y'all. it. problem saying wrong. growth. Moving goalposts going deaths cases, recognizing deaths stagnant month. Cases started spiking 12th btw. 

Tomorrow expect see huge number bc though. 

The updated death toll includes 1,854 deaths deemed likely COVID-19, though confirmed test. state reported 26 new confirmed deaths, pushing confirmed fatality number 13,018. state also reported 406 new positive care!  I‚Äôm psych... journals filled different facets COVID generation. Watching students slowly disappear, novelty remote learning wore became frustrating, distressing. mention abuse fear going behind scenes (school counselor tried set discreet way kids report abuse online...), abusers realize bruises likely go unnoticed. 

I wish simple choice schools open not. yeah, it‚Äôs really scary, inflammatory syndrome whatever unknown aspects infection be. It‚Äôs awful we‚Äôre position don‚Äôt want stick head sand pretend it‚Äôs thing... Cases hit new record high.

Then read headline.

Then see charge.

Big yikes. cute. But, think it. Fast forward year: US shambles. pandemic, uprising, 2nd civil war people openly speculating ... think violence chaos spill border? think desperate, armed Americans go looking medications supplies everything falls apart? Americans buying guns like crazy. 4.2 million guns March April alone, according FBI.

You think US government, desperate, consider invading Canada? kind nightmare scenario? Pandemic, uprising, climate change wreaking havoc, civil war looming US ... think come resources?

And, say it, ridiculous: Canada could stop 21st century US invasion. We're puny backwater 1812.

Be careful wish ... becomes refugee crisis Canadian border. That‚Äôs works denial, willfully ignorant. economic harm comes even we're ""open"" pretending nothing wrong. ""locked down"" means least using means address problem. Providing assistance, pretending masses continue consume families fall I'll. 

I idea many kill, uncontrolled, even 0.5% mortality, kill million people. That's good outcome path we're on. 

Disagree want, that's fine. I'm wrong. literally nothing politics. hard numbers. seeds planted 5 6 New Yorks right now. 

The first outbreak concentrated. 35k+ cases day, 20k+ NYC alone. overwhelmed everything Tri-state area led tens thousands deaths. 37-40k cases day, like 4000 LA county, 3500 Houston, 2800 Miami, etc. seems safer since high numbers, lower deaths. hotspots reaches critical mass like NY, one individually thousands daily deaths, tens thousands cases. 

The time close now. Learn NYC/Lombardi/Wuhan/Barcelona, pay consequences. Arizona Naruto south. got little pieces shitty tailed beasts, real damage, without outright Florida. 

Do get I'm saying? picture mind.....anywho.... Lots grandparents show weddings. They're highest risk.  I'm Indians fan. Teams actually fans stands? Crazy. Nah that's get lunk alarm set off. Huh, maybe they'll advise us wear... oh wait kidding. many presymptomatic? also means diseases less likely spread Yeah. primary area environmental exposures, least this, also suffers fate-they're rarely emergencies easy ignore (especially community getting worst pollution etc) like financially literate people know buy. like people went all-in financial crisis laughed way bank next decade

When average Joe thinks world coming end, buy. average Joe buying stocks poppin champagne, time gtfo (or play short game) last sentence something I‚Äôve thinking along. Pax Americana waning, pandemic accelerating process. feel awful people understand situation, take precautions, still die COVID. [The Outline need it.

Things getting bad Arizona (and since numbers lag testing gets tip iceberg, actual situation probably catastrophic week, Arizona reported record single-day increase new cases ‚Äî Tuesday‚Äôs tally reaching 3,591 ‚Äî also record use inpatient beds ventilators suspected confirmed cases.

Introverts finally getting upper hand. #blessed  production agency January, gather entire agency dissolved. 35 year old company, around 30 employees. Almost everyone know publicly posted LinkedIn they‚Äôre looking job.

I don‚Äôt think conferences conventions back next year. Honestly I'm amazed India doesnt 100k cases day given condensed 60% population is. hope gets better soon don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre getting downvoted. one piece clear consensus point surprisingly difficult catch virus outdoors, especially combined mask use and/or social distancing likely would degree many sports events. 

But you‚Äôre right indoor components stadiums too. wonder football related parties. Every single time Minnesota department health makes covid19 post fb, there's one lady keeps badgering ""When Valleyfair (large amusement park) going open?!?!"". 

I engage every time. used bring fact Disney opening...

...Now bring due rising cases. üëèüëèüëèüëè Well guess we‚Äôre going let burn us see fall really scary part we're still seeing first wave rising. No. saw someone post recently, they‚Äôd rather pay private profit corporate middlemen wealthiest companies country, pay CEOs millions dollars year, whose sole purpose tell ‚Äúno‚Äù need medicine treatment. degenerate kids know put home they'll able split belongings. saying end hard make happen, he's clearly touch reality nobody would argue point. Oh god. imagine Ortho breaking vent. Oh irony considering Karen scenario refuse answer question trying politicize death child. shame.

One dad‚Äôs brother in-laws runs co-owns couple emergency care centers Ohio caught mild case covid. put hold lot elective surgeries Canada weem getting high amount cases. Wow that's big decrease number serious critical cases.

I noticed China seems extremely successful preventing death. month since last death. that's unexpected (Taiwan showing similar pattern example) still wonder due particularly successful treatment.

If guess convalescent blood plasma. initial Wuhan outbreak something like 300L blood plasma collected time half used treating serious critical condition patients. Perhaps new patients they've employing stockpile treatment. *did Southwestern Connecticut like that. Literally everyone wearing mask think worked Tesla maybe I'm kinda scared dad appointment today Doesn‚Äôt work like dude. Remote/Distance learning answer. student myself, learning online same. It‚Äôs boring, it‚Äôs lonely depressing able talk hangout friends. Online learning effective person learning.

Students need able class learning able talk hangout friends peers. It‚Äôs right children‚Äôs future keep home, away students, afraid friends they‚Äôve known years. don‚Äôt get back, long term effect country devastating

Kids go back school   that's viruses way like flu, common cold, HIV, etc. 120K dead fear mongering? Covid already worse worst case scenario thought would March, still raging control.

This 40 times worse 9/11 end sight saying fear mongering?  They‚Äôre grifters, running country much ask for. really think due lack policing drugs alone. symptoms. Thank lol. makes sense FL hospital large surge week. also declining report numbers apparently due ""hippa"". protests directly increased numbers people breaking rules visiting family etc though. know I‚Äôm country, Northern Ireland, social distancing died completely whenever people saw hundreds thousands people BLM protests here, ROI U.K.

If see thousands gathering, naturally you‚Äôre going think ‚Äúfuck man I‚Äôm going see friends parents‚Äù we? Fuck, man. started strong like lost balls stick it.

Edit: I'm thinking it, massive crowds gathering, tear gassed, removing masks coughing hard gasping breathe probably help either. We're fucked. surely decline crippling debt incurred Covid-19 medical bills. US, course.  ^Help ^me ^I ^live ^in ^Florida stopped shopping years ago, honestly I'm amazed many people still shop complaining policies. we‚Äôre testing everybody need test we‚Äôre finding little problem

but completely wrong live Connecticut (Fairfield County less hour drive NYC) would say everybody wearing mask. Literally everybody, 100% people public. facility price gouging like Texas. makes feel better search name. two workers, **Carlos Gabriel** **Jessica Naro**

Of course would two Latino workers. decision Musk's company classist, also racist!  Wouldn‚Äôt fall state‚Äôs whistleblower laws anyway? federal whistleblower laws?

Go back whatever dictionary read fun; conversation boring. think point that's left state denial. live mostly rural Texas county.

Didn't age well all. healthy drop Covid patients seen ER. However, concerns increase ratio ER hospitalized patients. saw highest number since early days pandemic would hospitalize anyone Covid. MAY suggest ER seeing higher acuity patients. Thus, trend continues, ICU could fill faster.

That's pretty much happened NYC: people got message isolate home overwhelm hospitals, showed significantly sicker. cases people died earlier intervention likely would saved them. :( Sadly I've heard stories sub pregnant nurses asked stay work, even working coronavirus patients. They're probably talking surge capacity  Gov Murphy NJ said he's gonna tell us Friday (today) plan schools Fall. day that. next day. next next day... continuing foreseeable future. love America.

You know tell read them? Agnostic Trump? many times dropped child? would mean that... wrong? Like human something. explain didn‚Äôt see huge surge cases two weeks ago? argument 2 weeks ago yet 

So either logic flawed trying way blame protesting rather current states affected opening soon. Oh, that's good joke. Outside Texas, people think Houston leading much anything.

A former resident Texas  Titanic sinking, matter smash life boats? really wondering suddenly abruptly ended lockdown immediately seeing large crowds people bars restaurants, huge gatherings events.

What expect going happen? Nothing changed virus. I‚Äôm thinking may see months time. Perhaps bad New York, given population infected skewing younger, wonder numbers looked like NYC January February, little testing done. Perhaps 5000+ cases day then? don‚Äôt know. 
For comfort, idiots everywhere. difference perhaps countries relatively aware level stupidity.

You mean haircut parade? Part reason SARS vaccine demand dried up. looking like that's going happen case. I'd interested know every many vaccine attempts thing before, money funding research compared vaccines. fact human trials already started pretty significant fast pushed through. ""Luckily""(?) read today think numbers infected may scores larger think. Something like 23 million US rather 2.3 million. need testing, less (which know everyone hear knows, maybe enough people, Glow Stick White House start repeating it) since we'll get accurate number antibodies. may closer think.

We need latch onto something positive. Otherwise there's end vaccine comes out.

Nope. know one analysis using low quality data showed *some* correlation. There's zero reason expect hold true causal way, given draconian lockdowns today compared 1918. economy vastly different, service sector much larger share.

Edit: unclear. We've hit hard. We're low end downswing. Covid deaths staying flat, Pneumonia deaths 2018-2019 900, 2019-2020 6000 FL. Someone cooking books. Yep nice propaganda... ""parties""... Well, NYC ~3% people confirmed via PCR test. really say actual rate 6-7x high? seems pretty unreasonable given regions high testing penetration broad strokes similar outcome statistics. 

If NYC count underreporting 6-7x would expect confirmed fatality rate multiplies higher example Belgium, really see. correctly COVID 19 estimated 0.5% IFR. means 0.5% TOTAL NUMBER INFECTED individuals expected die disease.

Also fielding whataburger. San Diego pretty good masks (at least area) Fake news issue crapping paper current climate U.S. barely get 50% population wear masks pretty unhelpful cause saving lives. Considering let get two months ago saying masks help cause surface contact driven transmission, contact traced studies outbreaks pointed airborne transmission, I'm wondering alternative studies are? 

Every time they're tv, many AMERICAN scientists get paid talking head least once, object photos beaches places proven sources outbreaks. aren't, Fauci included, even speaking language terms danger used since late February countries like South Korea. KNOWN surfaces accounted little, ANY, transmission sounded alarm back March outbreaks began indoors recirculated stale air. 

Where studies contact traced outbreaks? Oh, that's right, allowing media keep screeching family get together instead using voice science warm purposefully distracted proven dangers offices, churches, funeral parlors, networking events, public transit. every country world take research tiny grain salt take away seems obvious save lives U.S. scientists, know corrupted money U.S. science become pursuit agenda driven money make living, take reactionary, overly critical stance anything contradicts narrative?

Linsey Marr correctly called petition even though agrees science shoddy, pointing there's evidence route transmission going standards. regularly points finding active viral particles proving particles capable infection sufficient number. Also viral particles lodge respiratory tract, something seems unlikely anecdotal evidence proven unlikely, South Korean call center outbreak. Nearly everyone breathing air eight hours close quarters eleventh floor building contracted virus. spite 1,000 people sharing lobby elevator common areas infected, outbreak remained confined sitting one side 11th knew people went home infected family members even time study, saying 68% infections happened home. mean ""shut home family contact"" media's shrieking CA family get together outbreaks seem suggest - went family get together source, probably involves going work air conditioned environment, restaurants, church perhaps - places shut reopened soon. 

For worst response planet pandemic, seems U.S., media, politicians, scientists sure lot say, much unhelpful situation. I'm sorry deal that. :( 
And trying harm people! Yes. missing announcement liked ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù told fix it, held conference today downplaying everything. watched - uncomfortable. We‚Äôre pandemic. Hospitals reaching reached capacity. 

A hospitalI know ordered large outside tent today COVID patients. mean really? concern? 

Yes, unlimited capacity keep ordering tents guess. Eventually need doctors, nurses, equipment.

They destroyed credibility ever built. longer believe word men. Puppets like rest keep economy open costs. 2020 probably treat us nifty little flu bug winter, like one 2017 killed 50k+. Yet picture empty bed, go figure.

NOT TODAY CHICOMS!  LOOONG time since I've proud anything city council done lol I'll say told another commentor. Lockdown never supposed indefinitely. month 2, followed ***a careful controlled re-opening***. decided bullrush full reopening throw worries wind becaise handle half assed lockdown. go China route. could countries Italy, Spain, Germany did, stay home fucking behave. make masks mandatory test fuck population like 1st world nation would.

I'm naive. obviously cannot shut country forever. even lock properly consistently withput people bitching parties going bars. government also painfully inept cruel theycouldn't safety net Americans even pretend took seriously. richest country planet shit people crisis. $1200 pittance hopefully shut us up. country throwing bus big corporate interests continue steal money pay fair share. 

Now, reaping rewards playing dumb virus. could beaten already, begin steps toward economic recovery. now, even people going fucked inability clamp beginning. yes many employ new techniques require testing techniques alone add development time.. also, \*have\* test appropriately, massive drain time.. exceptions. well said, good food thoughts.

B. Shape curve - Florida seen steady increases month continuing reopen everything. Wisconsin cases dropping mostly plateau'd month till latest results, soon determine trend.

Also, people protesting think masks protect them. would protested regardless they're upset social conditions. they're going protest, want wear masks, even fix-all. Sweden disn't nothing. wish people would stop lying this. Texas governor said old people dying corona virus mind help economy? person asked proactively attended protest,‚Äù Avery Cohen, spokesperson de Blasio, wrote emailed response questions test-and-trace workers ask COVID-positive individuals general questions help ‚Äúrecall ‚Äòcontacts‚Äô individuals may exposed,‚Äù Cohen said. Among initial questions: ‚ÄúDo live anyone home?‚Äù

So they're asked situations might exposed. think protesters sign agreement say protest catch coronavirus? fucked. Everyone acted like virus exists, undeniably fucking us shutting back ""pausing"".

Grandparents inside, toddler outside (or vice versa)?

Herding dog keep toddler away grandparents? spreads inside well regardless weather, accounts gonna even harder essential worker get sick wearing mask properly. protest claim solid. It‚Äôs based recent Oh, problem multi-party countries too. focus differences, whole lot important practice ideology common. everyone right thing. Memorial day weekend drove past Cape Canal head National Cemetery every parking lot along canal jam packed people. Genuine question: close want people long mask too, we're outside? impression needed stay six feet part even everyone wearing masks. Like Unabombers manifesto?

There's good chance we're 10 years unrest, lead us run throes climate change (and 2030s supposed dustier 1930s).

We period going dirtier dustier think need link climate change, I've read last couple days - 7 degrees celsius end century. That's far faster thought. Pretty much EVERY STUDY reporting environment changing MUCH FASTER predictions. People think 80 years. maybe 30 can't sustain global civilization way today.

And really far less effects climate change already displacing 10+ million people focusing building locally sustainable communities NOW. BLM movement great start creating kind solidarity need. Interestingly faired better Covid Climate Change. BLM gives hope begin stop marginalizing (btw, even though categorized such, racism thing, viewing others equal thing). needs higher capacity you? seriously? still happening point pandemic developed country!

Answer: ‚ÄúI said people, slow testing down, please.‚Äù - President Trump, June 20, 2020.

Apparently officials saying never received orders slow testing, made reference fewer cases less testing.

It boggles mind anyone accept logic. Fewer tests lower number cases all. prevents detected counted. It‚Äôs appalling. nothing work? else could applicable, forest fire, monsoon, earthquake, terrorist attack.... disturb I'm cleaning room!  New Zealand also population 5 million people Australia population 25 million landmass 30 times larger... Comparing two countries beyond dumb. Indian here, wearing masks atleast death rates way lower.  Well that's name heard long time Really? haven‚Äôt. scroll far find even one comment mentioning it. could almost pinpoint started based graph showing increased cases. 

For record, I‚Äôm protests think mass gatherings incredibly foolish selfish pandemic. worthiness cause negate risks. us still considering packed bars ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è measures?  Unfortunate things bad point bulk good news form single person survival outliers. think trust data Russia, India &amp; Brazil. uptick number registered infections USA. due infections, rather detection, one may expect death rate pick also. time lag, may come next weeks. may also death rate going developed world, since we've become better treating disease. Fuck off, union reason I'm COMPLETELY buttfucked monetarily. 

I'm graduate student teaches. university pays roughly 75% hometown university graduate union reaching collective agreement (oddly enough, generally non-union field)

New Zealand also population 5 million people Australia population 25 million landmass 30 times larger... Comparing two countries beyond dumb. 300 teens party shit ton, back pre-COVID days lucky two friends wanted go me, dafuq Yeah, no. close interactions spread corona. Protests, rallies, going beach cabin fever, it. nice people could collectively try slow down. can‚Äôt stop it, geez, slow hospitals keep up. safe y‚Äôall, great day! Naw bro, look test less win beautifully death rate though? get impression numbers infections hard compare since hard get tested before. deaths lie (if government willfully covering deaths). love people use stars bars try push agenda everything.

We got shit mostly thanks little skiing town called Ischgl Austria, plenty Germans tourists partying hard every night.

After testing 80% citizens Ischgl, turns 42% (!!) carrying antibodies (85% never noticed it) - STILL enough herd immunity.

It's concept that's based reality. Go ask Sweden that's working them; numbers speak themselves. They're basically lepers Northern countries days. think he's topped himself, shit like this. wonder if, end January 2021, we'll look back comment laugh much sink. going rough. base capacity filling surge inadequate healthcare staff care patients, covid patients. doesnt mean people hospitals receive care, means going less provided. lucky physician exams camera. People die would otherwise pull through. Things get missed nurses patients normal less time patient care. staff likely get mandated work extra shifts, exhaustion factor well.

You yanks clue big deal one is

YNWA Depends timing. three weeks (counting date infection ends), negatives issue, within period positives problem. course, antibody testing meant see whether virus past, whether moment. Yes yes.

I love city, part considering fucking new Mexico. Get nice plot desert unless morons start dropping nukes nobody hurt me. I‚Äôm thinking thing, however cautious saying may sound ‚Äòalarmist‚Äô. care. utmost gratitude. Even accounting lagging indicator, deaths decoupled cases US last month so.  Death rates definitely lower March/April. Probably improved medical treatment, possibly reasons.

That mean effect strong enough keep pulling deaths cases rising fast are, there. Moderna Catalent announced collaboration large-scale, commercial fill-finish manufacturing Moderna‚Äôs mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate (mRNA-1273) Catalent‚Äôs biologics facility Bloomington, Indiana.

They're activated pathogen returns. Then, start proliferating cranking antibodies. interesting see deaths match cases R goes up. He's already told places stop testing. They'll probably stop reporting deaths too. chance detecting within 24 hours low. Wait days; taking tomorrow practically guarantee wasted test / negative result. moved France. got hit hard seem got shit together. Also family UK back home. Feel you. yea like apple double year people shouldnt buying luxury products? something doesnt make sense. maybe run massive bubble. bad, huh. Prediction - New record tomorrow. Happy nightmares! Ever since I‚Äôve following projections alway needed revised up. What's that? seen done UK compares United States? wish leadership cared this. know isn‚Äôt political forum, it‚Äôs incredibly depressing. ‚ÄúBroward‚Äôs positivity rate nearly doubled last two weeks, five percent 10 percent, Miami Dade nearly tripled 5 percent 15 percent. Palm Beach consistently stayed high, range 9 percent 11 percent, according data available Wednesday.‚Äù

Damn ain‚Äôt good. Hah pretty safe bet deaths significantly underreported. 0.5% absolute lower bound. could well 1.0% higher data able fully analysed.

I surprised USA gets 1 million casualties unfortunately. Sure, let's risk health everyone classes ""boring"" Denmark everything pretty much back normal, except people bit cautious V-shaped recovery confirmed. Yes Another crap coin never delivers. actually, kids would rather miss school dead family... realizing brought deadly disease killed half family really screw kid life way year school. 401K ‚Äúnew‚Äù retirement system. companies match X% put paycheck. people, put max company match, can‚Äôt touch retire without penalties. said, 401Ks stocks gain minute interest time. could significantly decreased fauci didn‚Äôt lie public repeatedly needing mask. watch wind. Make sure sit way prevailing winds cross (ergo neither upwind downwind, rather perpendicular). Seems air flows / ventilation /air conditioning play significant role transmission. Besides that, sunnier location, better, sunlight kills virus fairly quickly. Counties need find pair start placing orders defiance Abbotts ruling. hell gonna anyway? Ask rangers get gunfight lose public support overnight? born raised Bronx. lost uncle 9/11. family personally affected day.

And know what? overblown. tragedy, singular tragedy governmemt milked every ounce worth justify meaningless, endless war Middle East. used justify airport security theater, strip Americans rights privacy, military industrial complex. let nation tearjerked years end, ignoring real issues behind it. never even went true culprits. screamed ""never forget"" waited far long actually get money victims' families lied cleanup's safety.

UV light zap thing quick, masks work better though, may avoid surge... say protests causing increases? virus political. stop racial justice..... new york reach capacity? mobile hospital ship too. US lost people covid-19 died WW1. Bold assume election VW need finish writing emissions cheating software good go lol. God damn incredibly angry shocked level ignorance stupidity. Fuck place. getting moment graduate. 2 weeks biggest protest gatherings surprise anyone.
And states, think first wave. certain demographics vulnerable virus. Metropolitan areas like NY suffered outbreak good portion citizens already get immunity sadly deceased.
For Houston many souther states, outbreak never occured hospitals less crowded usual. However protests, rallies etc increasing virus reaching people. consequence many going suffer think states going become immune virus. 
For regions become immune virus, huge price pay. think Ny already finished phase.

When Europe first wave, South America better. EU better S.America suffers greatly. add two continents numbers plot you‚Äôd see 2 waves. think US dangerous southern parts right now. Nevertheless people avoid going unnecessary things must use masks. ? blamed gather millions protests.   drove NYS CA. used reddit great guide finding small rural towns outside city limits stay hotel.

If half world eventually gets it, 1% die, that's 40 million horrible deaths.

/s goes like this. Australian, German, American got Covid... used Gym since end April Sweden - surrounded pestilence - Covid outburst there,so dunno respiration rate. dont think so, gyms epicenter outbreak hospotal got completely overcrwoded. China way passed,that stage lost someone knew today corona. Still can't believe 27 Misleading title. reason 2.4k NJ reclassified 1800 probable Covid deaths past actual deaths. Weve 649 deaths actually happened today. hurricane season due shortly too? Florida always lied numbers. Yall really think deaths low ""pneumonia"" deaths higher ever? Hmmm me. Except moved Ireland US. makes sad compare shit show happening countries. Albeit UK better US. I'm worried family glad I'm tiny lovely little island. Nah, they‚Äôve got plenty portable AC units. didn‚Äôt, tents would induce hyperthermic organ failure deaths literally every patient them. China lie us, position! punished! Buzz off, Hammond. Stupid stupid does. avg incubation period 14 days lol. That‚Äôs extreme. Curious, kind esports can't played online? Probably going victory lap. Call omnishambles. protesting couple weeks ago probably help. Hope y'all stay safe there. Black black shit ton Googleed ""fox news wear mask"" see plenty examples urging viewers wear masks, none obvious saying to. seen actually say repeating something without basis? (Asking live US, masks mandatory country, see people constantly villifying fox news see obvious evidence claims) Man, looks risky. still know enough antibodies behaviour immunity, plus variability covid-19 strains. can't burocratize virus now. Maybe couple years. sounds awful, big picture sacrificing development future prosperity children prevent elderly dying years early. fair? Kids deserve better this.

Look age distribution COVID fatalities proves otherwise Smarter US least... thats real praise Crypto...the currency video game character biggest concern immunity...

Every year get flu shot. would imagine even antibodies surviving it, it‚Äôs temporary thing getting would devastating weakened body....

Imagine getting Covid19, foregoing massive lung damage ending next winter, too? Frightful.

Hope protests, beaches, inconvenience lifestyles worth it... hearing 3 months now.

But two weeks.... fair idk could keep huge numbers people flooding daily. Meaanwhile country, able work home. supermarkets counter staff glass boxes safe sound. contact happens. feel safe, feel safe. Lines move super fast 50 people allowed once. Special times pensioners disabled ppl shope. Eveyone gets full salary benifits reopen next month new cases like NZ. 

Pretty sure forming landbridge another nation holidays too. Since cases. really well here. Nobody upset death toll ratio one lowest countries w dense cities. 

But again, people smart. work together. Protect vunerable truly want nation prosper. Banning travel country helped too. Think USA one nations indefinite ban list. But... health insurance paying healthcare others PLUS profit insurance company salaries people get paid bonus deny every claim. Apparently SPD changed mind ... Middle-aged Americans social traveling (1 hr freeway commute, etc) compared middle-aged Europeans. Abortions classified tumor removals long pregnancy test never done. We've solved two problems! why? needs big push opinion. massive ""Get vote"" campaign. That's fucked UK Brexit. People thought easy win, bother voting. USA USA USA!! Always number 1 baby    acknowledging racial differences immune science? I'm genuinely curious that. talk them? see him? pin please dont need reposts every day? no, missed ""groundbreaking"" part title. üòÇ  214k infected NYC good portion lmao Yeah possible, live country like US basically ignoring problem away AMERICA!!! YEEHHAAAWWW! PLACE ANYTHING POSSIBLE!!!!! 300k? loyalty test point. best ones visible risky. hopefully people stop defending Musk start seeing is. there's literally covering spinning it. disagree premise feel like correlation high population centers.

Of course NY higher deaths- agree income inequality plays role health- NY also home wealthiest people earth Manhattan, well impoverished areas state NY. mean, get ""responsibility people, laws allow lockdowns""-thing.


What get: 
lacklustre attempts testing/tracing
Ignoring mounting evidence population breathing masks/scarfs/underwear/whatever significantly reduces spread. That‚Äôs probably why. one cares F.A. Hayek said it. everyone cares _what said_. world literally shaking heads US right now. I‚Äôd utterly embarrassed right now. Everything's bigger Texas..... Betty Rubble asking it. Look way dresses! start treating idiots like actual zombies? There‚Äôs spike cases live. way hell want go back work. yeah, I‚Äôm making unemployment, I‚Äôm safer, I‚Äôm busting ass day day out. Work smarter, harder. don‚Äôt blame saying way did. 

They choose horrible sign make point people might care. Probably gonna best talk much testing since Trump‚Äôs getting blasted recent comments slowing  Yes. official number 649 according worldometers. people dying. People matter. Unless president US, people matter, they're white (surprisingly seem favour kind, orange people) lots money 20 million people likely one tomorrow. conflicted. Ugh. selfish force family choosing health (life cases) wedding. Yep, sucking other's dicks congratulatin ""corralling"" virus. live tiny apartments ""tough Texans"" get Yankee problems. man Cuomo hat cattle ask me!

This shit surrounded here.

And yes, problem flipped switch everything back normal. politicians talked briefly phases warning systems really winked like ""git along y'all fixin good summer!"" little math, might incorrect someone wants double check numbers. Looks like currently hit roughly quarter daily death rate entirety World War 2:

Total estimated deaths WW2: 50,000,000

WW2 lasted 2,194 days

50mill deaths/2,194 days = 22,789 deaths day

Total estimated deaths COVID: 489,343 

COVID lasted roughly 90 days since declared global pandemic

 489,343 deaths/90 days = 5,437 deaths day

This assuming data even close accurate, seems death rate probably much higher. course, chances hitting 50 mill deaths still pretty low, we'd keep going rate next 25 years knows. daily death rate could keep climbing. Here's something that's even scarier: US lost 400,000 soldiers 3 years 9 months involvement WW2. average daily death rate 300 people, currently losing people rate 15 times higher that. 90 days, 100,000 deaths, year's time could match number US soldier's deaths WW2 quarter time. ... hop shower Well, you, yes you, part this. used proper protection? 100% time? made important issue make others take precautions? using reddit voice actively productive precautious individual cause mind? 

Just honest. don‚Äôt ‚Äúknow‚Äù planet Neptune exists know does. That‚Äôs tell people. I‚Äôve heard too.

Austin growing fast infrastructure. I've b**ching while. great majority us made could minimize spread EVERYTHING push button. virus could MADE AMERICANS GREAT collective cooperation. somebody always wants more; indifferent anyone else's safety. Well we've kinda back normal germany now. I'm back work since mid april. around 4-6 weeks free time home office.

Could possible Exactly. Lets see weeks I‚Äôm one people. you‚Äôre mad, stop working collect unemployment. problem job didn‚Äôt shut down. mean thing outside open air likelihood transmitting airborne virus significantly lower than, say, nightclub horny teenagers? about.... due fly Miami today Spain. 4-week family vacation cancelled. That's around $10,000 down, one family vacation. can't imagine impact must Florida. Yup. It‚Äôs scary hell, don‚Äôt know anyone real idea full national supply present. enough, I‚Äôm guessing. Neither protests sports events risky, long they‚Äôre outside attendees wearing masks. 

It‚Äôs **indoor** spaces worried about. Especially bad ventilation recirculating air, like air conditioning setups. Especially people stay awhile don‚Äôt wear masks. Bars. Restaurants. Offices. Meat processing plants. Salons. Jails. Nursing homes. Churches. Classrooms. Dorms. Locker rooms. Etc. good place start thinking ideas would look countries successful done. I‚Äôm expert know big difference places done. worse asome better. think we‚Äôre strong enough nation better. One thing wish would done less bailouts large businesses least transparent bailouts. Also companies avoid taxes using tax havens shouldn‚Äôt get relief. Next would restricted travel, parties, gatherings longer. Mandatory face masks social distancing start. Contact tracing. Overall zero leadership anyway. mean president access top scientific research planning literally opposite encouraged disaster seeing now. that‚Äôs rant today. We're worried dying. lot people get complications survival  do?

So sorry going that. hope bounce back something even better. [I want UN peacekeepers anywhere near me, thank may want look Bill Melinda Gates Foundation think billionaires already that. Oh troll. Got it.  Yep. Doesn‚Äôt tale rocket scientist academic modeling figure out. but, youngsters getting it, low risk. biggie.

Me: Really? seen death number today?! Someone walking isn‚Äôt going pass virus.

Outdoor transmission rare happen. one spreading misinformation you. Still enough tests capacity process levels. Vote guys , must end..like seriously must end yeah know fucked movie previews. Get ready school starts back up. Idk downvoted. important question. Yeah, ok, keep fantasizing then. 17,715 confirmed deaths 210,523 confirmed cases. math would mean 2.5 million doctor confirmed cases ""early days"". antibody positive rate 20% 8.4 million pop, 1.68 million implied cases ever. So, super secret insider CFR seem know actually lower total IFR cases ever 30%. Sure bro. math impossible even wildly optimistic scenario. gonna pull numbers ass, least make plausible.  favor respond I'll leave notification unread hopefully remember later. Well original comment ""NYC"" reply comment New York City say ""New Yorkers"" assumed read comment correctly. comments based theories, based history estimates scientific papers . I'm sorry blindly follow number read article think fact. Enjoy ill informed opinion libraries closing. public tax funded. everyone society taker like you, would be? Society literally needs people add value, reduce.

But I'm problem problem. Texas doesn‚Äôt care - powder keg. exactly presenting fresh/new take. state healthcare cost absurd US. routinely getting better, slow rate, still ways go. Oh dear last time checked POTUS chinese GOP China. confused are? Oh, idea. Thank you. lol little winnipeg man mad Seems awful shame 320M people best got? first thought ‚Äúwumbo‚Äù math. half new cases nine states reported 1k new cases. guess what, they‚Äôre South! üò± even sick. houstonian sudden image one bloated zombie well walking dead inside head Houston literally built swamp. yeah we‚Äôre gonna need lot refrigerated trucks temporary morgues shit gonna get ugly.  Yet time, want say, ‚Äúcan help, told ya (politely)‚Äù time without coming rude asshole nobody listens science healthcare professionals. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è trying downplay severity this? PetCo. Put bunch workers unpaid furlough, offered chance come back 'temporarily' lower-paid positions. they're hiring outside replacements original positions, telling old workers they've terminated. Well american people seem care much well well staging massive protests pandemic even showing sign ending. pull pikachu face science reality again, prevails personal opinion? medical standard bigoted know it. Sounds reasonable af.

States' rights still racist fed also racist trying outracist reach He's back NJ today. We're bracing see increase. I've informed (on sub) Swedish government dismissing criticism coronavirus handling saying people wanting stricter measures far-right. I've also told that's standard comeback criticism government several years.  Clearly cnn wasn‚Äôt encouraging one lol. I‚Äôm fairness BLM protests incredibly important media talk COVID enough covering them. People looked protests thought oh could gather amounts sure go favorite restaurant are. Looks like went well! write well. write well, working Walmart. Awesome country! I'm car driving across state. Speech text best right now. I'll try remember link things later evening. No. measuring Covid ER Covid hospitalizations.

And many people survive heart attacks treatment. still go brrrrrrrrrrr Yeah... we're doomed Ohio. People getting relaxed think scary anymore. I'm temporary teleworker pandemic. coworkers itching go back building problem give shit! Dude highest number infections single day.

You people infected today country total entire pandemic. thinking thankful Internet pandemic. keep touch many people easily, social online, etc. 

30 years ago would calling phone occasionally real entertainment source home would watching hours hours TV.

Nice visiting rough right... maybe, day, enough people care something it... Here's hoping! didn‚Äôt enforce it. even wear masks go want to. MO checking in, feel pain... protests directly increased numbers people breaking rules visiting family etc though. 


Social distancing *increased* following protests. Significantly so. line previous research Well course. meant say plenty obese 80 year olds. Nothing that. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs thing, I‚Äôm saying past people suffered more. isn‚Äôt fun, it‚Äôs still humanity easy mode. 

People still communicate. phones video. us least live others. It‚Äôs real isolation like solitary confinement. still getting groceries, still going walks neighborhood, many people still visit family members (by wearing masks sitting outside driveways). 

You make good point children, don‚Äôt know affects keeps up. grown ups need stop babies, species endured much worse. next logical progression 'step daughter creampie' movies rage past years. Well wanted country let solve themselves. President confirming public interfering testing illness already killed least 120,000 citizens. also withdrawn federal support testing centers areas virus exploding. 

Why Trump immune normal consequences? allowing media carry water man using blood seniors political capital? I‚Äôm waiting mobile morgue trucks come careening neighborhood point located rather close fire station I‚Äôm worried Nona (which Italian grandma) lives 55 community lot people neighborhood club house weren‚Äôt taking shit seriously clubhouse shut down. I‚Äôm glad place alone regular germ fest newly adopted kitten named umbra keep company can‚Äôt there. We‚Äôre still bring leftovers like ribs things over. want create time machine? dropped ball. post positive news deaths dropping? CNN reporting spring breakers cause massive spike protesting.

It ok say protesting accelerated spike, doesn‚Äôt diminish point protesting. Yes. said totally trade deals. Climate crisis definitely directly line that. Good observation, Sherlock. Texas Medical Center 21 hospitals. name medical district. name single hospital. also largest medical district world. Huh? - shit infrastructure. Shits crumbling one fucking cares. planning trying, got admit... google plaquenil curiousity. Seems lower be, compare countries data.

Florida playing numbers. official ""deaths pneumonia"" figure 5x larger average year. They're trying categorize deaths anything COVID. Plausible deniability works remarkably well conservative voters. 10 years time we'll ***STILL*** arguing whether COVID deaths knuckledraggers care honesty. fuckers complaining wearing masks wanting go beach. think lot teenagers would happy smoke pot, fuck, never go school ever again. mean what's best them.  LOL! joking. honestly think second wave, first one stop get vaccine thanks poor behavior. multiple peaks huge wave. point CA's strategy much anything besides push curve future. went flattening curve delaying reason. 

LA Bay Area closed hard core since March. They've masks orders since April. small places placed May.

They opened hair went up. built zero immunity. They've basically spent last 2 months nothing. Trumps's wig outlandish looks like small animal died head? excessively high heels men? Oh man, know mean hazard guess, I'd say (in West) raised think wonderful special wrong answers, due belief everything done raise self-esteem. ""All Must Prizes"" attitude education.

A related phenomenon illusory superiority, problem West (and especially US) illusory superiority may lead people dismissing facts agree think know everything already (which also common behaviour amongst teenagers). may also reason many us think we're persecuted: overestimate relative peers wonder world rewarding us way think be. China managed control counts effectively? Even high rates mask usage surely it'd go unnoticed small towns/cities massively populated country?

Muscle body aches
Headache
New loss taste smell
Sore throat
Congestion runny nose
Nausea vomiting
Diarrhea We‚Äôre phase 4 Upstate NY.  tiny village like maybe 8 cases throughout pandemic. Yesterday confirmed cases 31.  

The snowbirds Memorial Day phase 3, allowing 25 people gather, social distancing masks probably brought numbers up.

I‚Äôm assuming 31, it‚Äôs like 60. large increase testing? Writes ""Pure gym,"" "" Ballantine"".. took 2 months you‚Äôre entitled unemployment. state in? still attempting contact money? be. Who? doesn‚Äôt matter. hospitals nowhere near overwhelmed. Remember, that‚Äôs flatten curve course actions self centered. not? kind altruist everything others without regard interests? get rid speed limits, stop regulating practices medicine allow sales OTC heroine anyone age ‚Äúpeople die. going die‚Äù. 

What like muddle life unencumbered thought process ? 2 were. hold church Belgium again, 1 person / 10m¬≤. church parents didnt open singing spread virus easier. lot old people. I'm glad except two people everyone takes Covid serious. sure one guy mental problem, guy know sure wasnt sharpest tool there. parable told President Bartlett TV series West Wing. great one.

In Spanish say ""a Dios rogando con el mazo dando"", lit. ""praying God still hitting hammer"". ask God help, wish whatever want, hope, still work towards making real. No. this. mast stop spread you, helps prevent spread others. Even N95 mask leaks airplane, spread. 
You must quarantine reach destination, then, back Canada, must quarantine again. Canada, face $75,000 fine screw around.

Canada's health coverage changed recently. get sick, injured abroad, COVERED. can't simple drive across boarder. sick US, expect bill well $50,000 COVID19, someone front leave.

I get missing people, well fellow country folk risked this. Face time like rest us please. May may be: case increased infections, increased testing, decreased hospitalised patients, decrease ICU patients, daily deaths (rolling average number). many mild cases, cases young patients. ""herd immunity"": Last measurement 17.2% antibodies Stockholm sample. Ha...well done. Unfortunately daily death chart daily infection chart indicate ""stop dying"" day.  You‚Äôre little biased, Captain Sugarbiscuits... Easy eat go ‚Äî nice meals. American population stupid comes this? Stay inside wear masks it‚Äôs fucken rocket science. saying ending awful? Missouri imminent list? South Carolina similar sized population greater density. 15,700 June 10th. South Carolina almost doubled 28,000 two weeks Missouri hit 20,000. South Carolina 10% official active cases Missouri. Missouri middle-of-the pack, top 4. Yes that‚Äôs literally happened. Also 300 completely idk news outlets getting 300 like 100-150. Yeah Bing'd Googol once, came back Google. Fuck sake. they're irrelevant, insignificantly small comparison obvious consequences wearing mask publicly complaining wearing one going far pretending medical exemption infantile. Whining inconvenient shows grasp many Americans died far, many future get grasp pandemic that's speaking control months.

The astounding part many countries able contain efficiently, point almost zero deaths currently cases country weeks. almost like functioning governments, citizens understand danger pandemic poses countrymen. Maybe combination both? world may never know. People can't obey something simple Mask... lockdown far fetched them.. Yeah, one thing whole thing taught me, never underestimate stupid, entitled, selfish significant amount Americans are. Tomorrow: Hold beer saying protests solely responsible waves, say zero impact clearly propaganda. watched hours live streams protests overhead cams reporters ground. news report fact. told watching those, one got covid, I'd think entire thing hoax. hoax. real, covid care people hugging stranger's, singing yelling other's faces noble righteous cause. People came over. people protesting neighborhoods. got together, created breeding ground, went back communities, spread. outside airflow thankfully mitigated anyone expected, denying spread seeing related gathering possible. dead wrong (read primary literature, MSM disinfo) 300 mouthbreathers (yourself included, since rationalizing failure) many think know symptoms are, even if, would care? actually 173 right now, added link current numbers.  
I think important see ""ICU"" sometimes defined bit differently, good benchmark see capacities health care system, measure decline/increase. 
Sweden peak 558 patients ICU 280 non-Covid-ICU cases, plus capacity another 200 empty ICU beds. 


As reminder, cases densely populated parts country easy access ICU; North 8 patients right ICU, already leads distribute patients hospitals region (I think 5 cases per 100.000, Stockholm 2 per 100.000 now). actually big problem. Yeah guess many laws/regulations protective measures cars driving them? almost like protective measures place help lower risk.

Why fucking morons keep using false equivalence argument cars? 120k deaths like 4-5 months corona people like use unbelievably dishonest fucking stupid argument ones complaining masks.

For longest time I've saying ""I hope someone know contract die"" honestly hope idiots someone close get severely I'll die this...maybe wake fuck realize people dealing with. tests are...counterfeit. Nucliec Aicd tests. I'm sure much infectious Europe strain is, yeah, that's correct. Good point. yeah they're upward trend currently end sight one anything limit spread.

That's actually even fascinating, Ireland investigating churches illegal shit? far truth

According CDC, [an unsettling large portion population wear seat People even know unbelievable. understand general sentiment rather selfish way looking it. started new job lock layed it. voluntarily quit last job new job long enough qualify unemployment. got jack shit, lost savings built last 5 years. people around making they'd ever made before. 

Sooo many people camps acting solution unprecedented problem clear cut dry. Like possibly conceivable people terrified economic shut down. *literally* safety net millions people. talking unprecedented economic ruin here. level worse great depression.

I'm saying taking every precaution necessary lessen impact virus. people acting like shutting economy vacation obviously made sense. really trigger economic collapse leave people destitute. Homes foreclosed on. Life savings wiped (I'm latter camp, possibly former close again). destroy economic prospects millions people years, decades come. 

You can't act surprised people disagree completely ignoring livelihood process. although evidence highly doubt it. belgium around 6% people covid. cases/1M inhabitants deaths/1M order. 


The amount deaths belgium higher suspected cases. 


My thought far away group immunity used social distancing probably masks. ‚ÄúPlaces worship ‚Äî deemed essential.‚Äù

If could eat prayers, wouldn‚Äôt risk going get groceries.

Fortunately, praying home holy book spiritual guide uses possibility...

Unbelievable. *The 8th September entered chat* People getting creative comes staying safe COVID-19 prompted least one Michigan library issue public warning: Stop microwaving books. burned book returned Kent District Library damaged microwave. microwave anything, library officials say. Except that‚Äôs weak best comparison We‚Äôre number one! We‚Äôre number one! Waiiiit... US dead WW1.  people like cannot bothered help slow spread.  Self centered actions.  attitude revolting. FL recalling genius? However beds almost full things. covid mean get priority someone stroke heart attack concussion. assume doctors best assess level danger vs. actually save patient covid figure importance anything else that's deadly. Worst league years!!! here.. full lockdown since March. It‚Äôs frustrating scary. I'm glad happy ending story! people Reddit making fun ""Wait two weeks"" also recommended palliative care get go anyone 80, anyone 60 conditions.

This fake news, FYI. Health Social Care Inspectorate looked starting couple months ago valid concerns due high pressure ICU units, found systemic issues. one worried still clinging highly politicized idea (driven Sweden's far right oddly enough USA's far left) today, either idiots dishonest need deny anyone care needs handle capacity like 30% now. conspiratorial illogical. dumb. 
 
As far Dr John concerned used watch videos I've turned point hysterical, unscientific reactions. video final nail coffin far I'm concerned. looks Sweden completely ignores fact daily death, ICU hospitalization rates decreasing (nearly 1/3 peaks) chooses focus increase daily confirmed cases happens coincide significant ramp testing current phase spread. cherry picks facts ignore reality order maintain narrative. serious commenter, words. It‚Äôs already happening, Texas hospitals 100% capacity. NY, brought nurses beds. Texas FL AZ etc big shrug citizens party up. Well, trump trying destroy ACA, shutting testing, economy great some. 

Consider bill 1 person ICU around 1 million dollars due virus.. 40 million unemployed. 

Just think bankruptcy's foreclosures start rolling in. vultures waiting swoop in. :/ cant believe none guest called that... fucking morons also.

i want see someone get raging argument masks stupid is. don‚Äôt think protests causes coronavirus cases you‚Äôre delusional. limited tests. We‚Äôve already heard cases people contracting gone protests. Either dots don‚Äôt want connected studies limited/a little time needs pass cases develop.

They body top body, many masks many without. Lots masks worn wrong. Duh? Remember, Trump looses re-election, intentionally sabotage everything November January give successor worst numbers possibly come to. Deaths trail infections 2-4 weeks, infections take weeks build lifting quarantine. could completely lift quarantine, get everyone infected January 1st, Biden would massive wave deaths first month president. 

And Trump would blame Biden. healthcare workers, regular triage critical patients get urgent treatment. know go A&amp;E slipped bath broke wrist trying break fall, 5 minutes consultation doctor sometimes run older man wheeled gasping blue lips. That's kind triage healthcare workers used deal with.

What COVID-19 making many hospitals now, patients likely live get urgent treatment complete opposite norm.

Natural selection really isnt favoring humanity year. voters reported quite high degree confidence government‚Äôs capacity handle crisis, 63% April.

What insane much faith experts NONE even TRIED explain Sweden's curve started flatten mid/late April.

I see ton experts mock Sweden deaths mock antibody tests come back low.

Okkkkkkk deaths hospitalizations go down? keep rising April, May June? 

Depending listen Sweden anywhere 5 15% people detectable antibodies (higher Stockholm obviously). appear virus slowed? 


If anybody give one ""pro-lockdown"" expert even tried explain Sweden's numbers started decline April I'd love see it. some* fellow texans Rotten nation?

I know what's worse: wrong seem care?  Keto Diets allow better RQ quotients, according linked documentation Covid may hamper ability RBC's load deliver O2, AI tests predicting Covid Severity point correlating factors related metabolic disorders:

&amp;#x200B;

1. RQ Ratio, Respiratory Quotient Ratio: Amount O2 needed maintain Basal Metabolic rate

100% Carb Diet = 10 O2 per unit aerobic respiration

100% protein Diet = 8 O2 Per unit

100% Fat diet= 7 O2 Per unit

Ketogenic dieters would RQ 7-8

&amp;#x200B;

2. Covid Attacks Beta Chain Hemoglobin captures Porphyrins Research paper

&amp;#x200B;

""The attack cause less less hemoglobin carry oxygen carbon dioxide. lung cells extremely intense poisoning inflammatory due inability exchange carbon dioxide oxygen frequently, eventually results ground-glass-like lung images.""

This process would decrease amount Heme able recycled also mimic hypoxia, eventually body would logically need produce new Heme.

&amp;#x200B;

3. AI tools predict worsened Covid symptoms show following good predictors Biotech Article

A. Elevated ALT liver enzymes

b. Elevated Hemoglobin levels

c. Myaglia

&amp;#x200B;

4. Putting information together

Elevated ALT levels Myaglia related Transaminitis caused conditions like NAFLD, diseases usually plague medical conditions like obesity/diabetes/cardiovascular problems

Those already High RQ requirement would likely suffer hypoxia induced damage Heme complexes. However lower RQ quotients could stave damage hypoxia longer (because use less O2). association interesting would mean likely metabolic disorders glucose metabolism insulin resistance may predisposed hypoxia caused covid 19

Now deaths accidents things like diseases totally different matter asi guess nobody deliberate manner. shit happens. 

Are COVID deaths preventable? Probably yes. better say, almost certainly yes. went ""Health costs"" route, could crump numbers next zero, cost would enormous. yet take account dumb illogical yet important things like peoples desire freedom. They'll get it. malibu today groups children playing together kind summer camp. around 12-15 kids estimate, probably kindergarten 5th 6th grade. Almost one wearing masks. also highland park, LA, everyone masks donut shop pretty serious waiting outside till called in. 2 customers allowed time. competitive people.

Increasing levels virus massive disaster even collapse hospitals. thing apparently already mutated least once. doubt herd immunity even possible. going around good think. best mutates something weaker. Virus gotta eat too. Covid 2: enough space ICU We‚Äôre trying train 5 year old put take mask properly needs eat drink case required school fall enters kindergarten. still idea fall bring.

""After botched start England making new mistakes""

Fixed you. March predicted (because structure USA health system) millions would die.

If US governments (state federal) continue jack shit USA absolutely see least million deaths. little USA health system. People still questioning China lol. look commenters here. Also insane reason people complaining tend affluent least middle class therefore much insulated consequences ignorant decisions us working-class Folk pretty much get it, at, miss eating out.

Our grandfathers fought rights , striked protested time time goverments wants cut social benefits protest strike . 

You guys need organize, strike protest stop whole god damned country option give demands .. reason also need herd immunity every preventable disease: herd immunity. protect can't get vaccine. Immunocompromised people, infants, old senior citizens... rely rest population part. Believe me, affected stupid enough get vaccinated whacky conspiracy theory, care less. sympathy people all. also vaccinate kids, young make medical decisions likely suffer parent's poor choices fault own. That's issue morons lies. Screw pro-plaguers. Aww man, comment removed might hurt someone's feelings. Here's gist:

So real argument want make childish comments?

You apparently know banks work. ""wealthy"", least, small banks. Major corporations pretend banks, like J.P. Morgan/Chase, wealthy. vast majority banks delicate balance credit, consisting savings private citizens, debt, form loaning money private citizens businesses make purchases like houses, cars, etc.

That's banks occasionally require bail economy flops enough people can't make payments inflation reduces amount credit bank has. also see little plaques FDIC logo every bank, case bank fails, federal government back certain (substantial) amount.

You really start educating way world works stop reading news certain sources might considered news less-than-real nature certain group people. People weak immune system can't take vaccines afaik Welcome single issue advocacy. build entire platform income one issue, need update day day, dumb shit happens.

This deep dark rabbit hole ultra right ultra left news goes while.


Hell, even single issue subreddits drift shit like this, political jokes like the_donald was, even dumb ones broken bones water worry. condition deteriorates life-threatening situation, surgery longer qualify elective doctors take care you. Oh wait, looks like ICU beds longer available, please nice day. US really needs put fucking masks self isolate like every fucking country successfully reduced active cases. Curiosity: able work home, moving back office early? Also: city in? (Curious rates) *They hated Jesus spoke truth* trump rallies. Hardly anyone showed know none masks lol think 9/11 bad example bc government justfy war oil.

Human lives dont matter country. Money does. 

And seems wont change long time  China, Kung Fu, hoax, ... That's due testing rates though, no? 100 people tested positive 1000 actually infected, 11 deaths would give 11% case death rate, 1.1% infection death rate. millions college students returning campus socially distance party live near haha hello neighbor! also think probability things get bad rest country we‚Äôll lose progress? think we‚Äôll fine part knows days countries havent hit worst yet? states bent curve cases shot soon opened. isn‚Äôt going go away can‚Äôt lockdown entire year. Stay fuck inside people scared, let everyone else live lives. European Union 1.3x population US around 3,300 cases comparison US's 40,000+ yesterday. Europeans wore masks, followed guidelines, complain freedoms protest guns. They've earned right party. still remain vigilant, agree, one like other. I‚Äôm American. 

I disappointed.  find astonishing blonde hair, rap channel! grandparents better cutting contact there's vaccine.

Cut credit cards let pay tuition. sad thing many death threats poor leaders gotten. Sad time American. Hey man that‚Äôs would wanna do, power ya. organizations aren‚Äôt trying hire outside even did- beware. they‚Äôre short staffed pandemic means you‚Äôre getting treated like crap. put ever Covid room have- know me.

I‚Äôm brave ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Keep sharing story. Ignorant willfully ignorant people need hear it. There's many people taking ""everyone get eventually"" position, insane. sure, California get 8000 cases yesterday alone? people lockdown. still understand that's possible test 90% accurate. 90% accurate mean 90% test results correct? get 70% coming from. test 1 million people theses tests 90% accurate results. Let's say 20% people (like NY) tested positive antibodies, that's 200,000 people tested positive. get 70% 200,000 false positives test 90% accurate. come 70%? article talks base rate infection 5%. 1 million people 50,000 infected. assume 5% people test positive antibodies since infected, right? leaves 950,000 people. guess understand unless someone shows math exactly works seem grasp it. Oh god real... literally couldnt said anywhere?? lol government still big. It‚Äôs leader small. test people ICU need respirator death rate could 90%, many underestimate danger virus rapidly spread population eventually overwhelm health care system. 

Testing lots people randomly selecting people provide accurate data virus is, target areas simple measures social distancing, masks lockdown control virus. think spreads places people wear masks... Canadian here. Prime Minister would able stop hospitals taking patients, power. fyi. Well, *this* good news. sad visitors! theme parks Sweden closed one still open. brother family booked visit stay hotel days. second last thing planned summer one night stay small island left. 

I feel sorry kids 8 10 years old. live apartment Stockholm hot nothing do. Fortunately Skansen still open go look animals.

I talked brother (or chatted actually). kids want go theme park Oslo Copenhagen seems neighbors keep borders shut.

Do anyone suggestion holiday? favorite part reason gotten bad get worse inherently political yet ban remove comments anybody speaks directly actual cause behind bad. simply cannot make up! maybe capacity fears good thing. even would govern Texas better joke Unless s/he's union. US poor baby! son almost 11 months terrifies me, there's many ppl area problems getting close others mask one pulled chin. overall giving crap...

My heart goes family heartbreaking :'(  whole fan base old people dropping like flies. guess we'll see then!

Texas's growth cases following pretty closely. difference hit 100% normal capacity state already pause. lol what? true video footage see country See tomorrow! next day.. next... Wait. supposed miraculously disappear? maybe highly risk already dead stay home want die. combination headline apply them, also significantly guilty average person. MAGAs: masks
BLM: masks Bolsanaro now! Seems like he's making headlines add comments, fed dumping trillions every day God knows long sense took kamikaze dive months ago. 

Don't worry. Odds decent even fed can't stave stock implosion forever. might truly collapse (likely near/medium) future. 

Then we'll get even layoffs shit. messaging 14 days [**2020-07-10 10:20:44 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2020-07-10%2010:20:44%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this send PM also reminded reduce spam.

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide  &lt;red sox bought COVID+ hookers whole floor yankees reality looking cases relevant necessarily important used be. lot people seem confuse wood trees there. know CDC 10x number cases officially tracked. It‚Äôs pandemic matters serious impact people‚Äôs health. We‚Äôll see 2 weeks really bad thought, far serious impact trends aren‚Äôt violent. 

And reasons this:

1/ forget lot deaths came mismanagement really exposed groups (eg elderly got trounced NY)

2/ bettering understanding (eg realizing respirators great idea unless it‚Äôs last resort).

3/ people careful. enough certain (and that‚Äôs much bigger concern states reopening). make difference.

I think make mistake obsessed cases numbers. Back March, metric track. it‚Äôs indicator concern, look multiple variables completely freak out. Yeah, lots surgeries considered elective. recovered open heart surgeries, many scheduled weeks advance patient brought morning surgery. Probably half patients done way, half considered urgent. Brilliant. avoid reading Twitter replies Gov Murphy‚Äôs account responsible diminishing virus' potential danger Uh supporting rich hoard resources earth, create bunkers survive global warming leave rest us die outside, Sir! o7 RemindMe! 2 Weeks That's one good thing pandemic brought. Many people like know bad. Now? seen briefings rising number sick/ dead. bring many vote him. Wearing mask absolutely fine. 

Forcing others wear one? well would call that... Lol. university says universities ok. joke. crowded dormitories classrooms safe? AZ part. 2.2 percent population 7.6 percent cases . 3x size do. California gets away size alone. Public nudity actually legal throughout United States, long indecent exposure. purposely act like dumbass? haircut people? people lost livelihoods bullshit ""Those people cancer shallow grave, bothering anyone!"" -you

Are going supporting person cancer financially? No? surprised they're still working job. Closer 3 2, Boris Johnson pretty typical experience, 1 week coughing, sniffles, wanting stay bed, gets bad enough hospitilization week, unfortunate another 2 weeks average die covid. clearly remember numerous speeches work restaurant boss walks around nose completely mask everyday ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Nah y‚Äôall relax bit WEAR MASK!!

I live Chicago. among 1st states/cities got REALLY bad early March. 

I work ‚Äúessential‚Äù

In fact haven‚Äôt stopped working since thing started tell gotten sick NEVER take mask work I‚Äôm around people. 

A LOT people Florida, Texas, etc. refusing wear mask it‚Äôs surprise it‚Äôs surging there. idiot turns blind eye. 

I think Hitler said something similar jews. US cell leaders BLM threatened burn don‚Äôt get want. idea BLM valid, top racist marxists(irony what). funny thing rarely saw masks live. followed lockdown orders, properly social distanced listened healthcare professionals knew us. lockdown 3 months we‚Äôve virus free month now. I‚Äôm sorry Americans trying same, must infuriating people dumb make healthcare issue political one. Thank this. hardest I've laughed Reddit comment long time. People one side political spectrum believes science wears masks strongly encourages mask use, side doesn't. data bears out. planes operate like biohazard hoods clean filtered air exchanges cabin air many times hour, it‚Äôs damn dry. case, people wearing masks it‚Äôs big deal it‚Äôs pretty clean relative let‚Äôs say restaurant city bus subway clean filtered air exchange present. Infections would limited immediate neighbors rather whole plane. ""repeating course"" gets every time. like seeing ""ackshually"" flesh pushing taped glasses nose. Meanwhile middle management upper class rich people mad inconvenienced slightest wanna hear logic lol honestly trust Florida reporting? Say prayers   Yeah, agree. definitely gender reveal baby shower later on, seems like wanted party! Death America unironically. Explain? asking much bro grew Houston still lot friends family there, breaking heart. They're opposite Jack shit. They're encouraging spread actions. im smart enough know im fed bullshit.

Well, ""im"", another likely possibility unable tell reality fucking true. 70% tests done false positives. positive test false positive. scenario 1m tests done, 143k positive, 100k those(or 70%) false positives. Found em, Found one gets triggered masks! ""Don't tell shit floor! tell suck olives salad bar put back! shamed compliance."" -you isn't. accurate analogy would sending incoming dry people next tree one space it. Hey, sorry gor irrelevant upstate mean context? wall street thought so. Social shaming strong lmao at?

here city lot people use masks completely wrong use all. putting test far ""push"" base. don‚Äôt get people re-opening. isn‚Äôt likely go anywhere long time. shutdowns huge consequences. People losing livelihoods, health insurance, UN WFP advising hundreds millions face famine worldwide 300,000 per day die starvation continues, yet march blindly on, hopes selfishly trying reduce risk virus takes less lifespan average die simply obese.

HIV top ten cause death worldwide long time now, could easily make one go extinct agreed sex, least could virtually eliminate risk abstaining one thing. us would rather live world sex HIV one without sex HIV. aren‚Äôt willing give sex eliminate risk dying HIV, willing give much life simply reduce, eliminate exposure disease far less risky? wasn‚Äôt governor Texas? 

Calling joke giving way credit deserves. takes lot effort, hard work power reach number one. Wife sees hard work online. threads people complaining Costco pulled large sheet cakes temporarily usually eaten large gatherings parties. little effort Costco may return events like family birthday party everyone sick grandpa last knew critical. takes hard work. Yes, focus rally ~6,000 people ignore mass protests hundreds cities across nation lasting several weeks. think COVID woke spreads Right-wing rallies protests? time. colour surprised, Jared Kushner didnt defeat coronavirus us would say silver lining benefit well. Home birthd always safe option. United States one highest mortality rates birthing mothers developed world due universally followed hospital delivery practices. better put .09% majority population Electors, majority. chances states quarantine again? Jesus christ relax lad. fine. panicking swedes aren't? 5k deaths good doomsday people want be. Competent leadership probably. *nations* I'll give better explanation bit, get home. crux accuracy poor metric two classes uneven. Imagine 1% population sick, 99% healthy. test 99% accuracy saying everyone healthy! course test worthless, still 99% accuracy. people sick, 0% accurate. 

What means test good whole population bad subset population. similar effect happening here!  sub: üë®‚Äçü¶Ø mean, look Illinois. Massive protests, cases. past days seen slightly increased numbers, also increased testing. positivity rate same. see many people state testing? Kind wish state would same. even mandate general. Back Pence‚Äôs early years known Doctor Pence appeared Congress Investigation testifying BIG TOBACCO said Scientific Data showing Moderate Smoking harmful humans long didn‚Äôt Smoke excessively leads Trumps Coronavirus Task Force Go figure one European understand party loyalty all, I'll always voting party best aligned values/priorities. I've voted 3 different parties past 12 years.

The fact impossible US big reason politics messed up. Good job Philadelphia! rest state / country would that. could least wore mask, quit trying downplay everything happening. Oh like seeing hint allergies suspicious, I‚Äôm betting congestion winter fun hear. Plagiarism people died pandemic killed Blitz. Hitler's Luftwaffe bombers snuffed 43,000 civilian lives eight-month campaign still haunts country. 

The official COVID-19 death toll stood near-identical 43,230 Thursday, however, ""excess death"" records suggest true number victims past four months likely 65,000.

Yikes Awaiting updates new policy advisor Sammy Hagar.

He knows make good tequila, something we're going need times come. Whitewolf‚Äî‚Äî times people tried come without mask, triumphant time....I see eyes want fight can‚Äôt adamant requiring them...One time, obvious Trump Psycho, started telling protected constitution wear mask, told could tell outside...When went outside, went door, stayed inside pointed sign door require masks shrugged shoulders...then walked away make coffee....dude thought going make hour long diatribe audience....his face priceless.....ahhh...let‚Äôs take minute revel Yes say none trump's fault wrong. encourage wearing masks months ago we'd much better analogy highlights one biggest problems US currently facing: ""we'll start diverting patients hospitals"" real option hotspots many safe places. raining everywhere, eventually dry place run to.

Your analogy literal, make one less valid. Even normal times, every seriously ill patient admitted intensive care. treatment wards tough doctors judge patient would unlikely survive treatment, example due old age risk factors, judge patient would put unnecessary pain without affected outcome treatment, may decide admitting wards. Systems kind place countries, exact criteria decision-making process reports submitted Health Social Care Inspectorate say **some coronavirus patients normally would receive intensive care receiving it, decision-making process differs hospitals even within Stockholm **The National Board Health Welfare said age determine treatment patient receives, instead overall assessment made.** came internal document Karolinska University Hospital said upper limit intensive care 80. 

This different say suggests Sweden's approach based malice, stupidity.

On hand, Yngve Gustafssons comment much reasonable criticism much widely reported since actually knows stuff. criticism others shift toward patients sent ICUs fairly quickly ICUs warned relatives pushing doctors sending patients chance survival. patients sent back first, still save around 20%

I'm certain getting 20% from. average survival rate admitted? assuming elderly get ICU treatment healthy did? find unlikely.

It also noted half put palliative care covid-19 infection later died suffer difficulty breathing, instead died something else earlier covid-19 infection. [(direct source)] visible uptick (although small) statistics number patients dying receiving kind treatment latter, 80 mean death's door anyway.

And they've repeated many times, 80 ""biological age"", many years earth. common misunderstanding. 85 year old runs marathon biological age 85 sent Italy Spain forced prioritize people higher survival chances ITU, Sweden never overwhelmed way, they're anyway.

I enough knowledge Italy Spain, trust best. read Italy put lot elderly ICU higher mortality rate age group. Temporarily poor. Kept telling mom leave South. They're stupid, assbackwards there. kept trying move her, kept giving excuses. Also hope get see grandma again, know mom mentally stable enough deal grandma dying. Fuck government :-/ Again?

He never asked Mexico first place. office. Never single meeting trying get money. Im almost afraid ask, understand. Don's insatiable urge get rid ACA? Isnt closest thing US government-assisted health care? guess could widespread antibody testing find out. Got mine done negative. NY/NJ metro area mask use social distancing declining. warm weather began, beaches, parks, outdoor restaurants/bars, streets crowded people wearing masks. can't fix Florida-Man-Governor-Stupid.  saw protesters wore masks Pretty sure Trump never admits anything thinks makes look bad. rare see masks used social distancing half assed. Canoeing, bring tent spend days away. careful ticks course. impression Americans can't afford getting sick :D even though hardly anyone going, know distance wear masks. cities going see spikes next week two.  Feel bad family members Another way look author quote mentioned give credibility said, give credit one deserving it.  That's like praising someone walking sidewalk instead road. We're getting better keeping people alive, long ICU beds, completely full several US states. shits hits fan. edited comment. forgot add ""For part refuse lock down"". even lockdown mid July take mid sept (likely longer amount spread/no masks) get controlled. Freedom?! You‚Äôve got alive able exercise one, champ. many times learn math isnt political?

I guarantee half country able count 270 November ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Im sure see lot deaths area didnt see people would fucking wear mask stop selfish. really sick mf human race, one looks one another all. could stop stayed home wear masks consistantly. comparing NIH campus something like Walter Reed it‚Äôs still bigger almost every metric. like would good time popup hospitals right? Meanwhile, Trump busy trying repeal ACA midst pandemic. already are. got propaganda postcard mail saying ‚ÄúBiden weak China epidemic‚Äù That's fuck up, man. age currently testing positive much lower April therefore death rate going remain lower saw Spring well. virus exactly went down, Cuomo messed first quickly got gear people well end, thing bring America ..... Americans scary thing many public health officials coming stories pressure keep numbers artificially low. guess believe math R botched start, UK may make new mistakes 

That Far Side cartoon headline right there. wearing loose fitting shirt part cultural attire. due DCMA may slice picture cake share fellow poors unless additional licensing purchased. Lol. No. federal law, places laws regarding public nudity/exposure person absolutely arrested jailed walking city streets naked government *has mandated need cover up* 17,2% among people wanted get tested is. sure pay test. definitely representative Stockholm total. sides roles. everyone smart this, matter government wanted. However, government making difficult right thing absolutely abhorrent people need financial help can't go work business affected. cases, would say.

I think army: ""come protect interests lobbyists, get PTSD nice medal. we'll spread lie 'served country' everyone 'thank service'"". ingrained US mentality... conscientious objectors seen deviants, kids go overseas fight government puts return... sad me, really. Getting corona absolutely fine.

Forcing others get it? Well would call that...

Your right wave fist ends smacks face popular saying, id say sooner that. 

I think term applies deadly pandemic diseases also forced hope becomes mandatory people smarter yourself.

I say lib ertarian believing absolute freedom people ideology color creed certain circumstances call concessions particular event, federal state governments use powers far corrupt things matters public health urge look matters concerned freedom wear fucking mask public. Im assuming jusy eager play victim anyways like people position. Funny think media is. Actually can‚Äôt wait til November another Trump win iT‚Äôs fLu ...  that's true, tomorrow third. Bet can't guess what'll come that.. right-wing propaganda machine efficient spitting talking points live apartment Stockholm hot nothing do.

Catching C19 would give something do. Plus, could work infecting people!

These places even considering opening. madness. Finding something kids least concerns. Thema verfehlt, setzen 6. can't predict people do. right, New Yorkers adamant mask usage. knows happen states anti-mask propaganda. 

it reminds woman voted Trump husband got deported. Played stupid game stupid prize. 

The calculation made demonstrates effective lockdown, there's least 2 month wait watch daily cases slowly trickle down, even states good mask usage. lot ways could worse. Good you, though I‚Äôm sure Muslim relevant. Two months ago 18,860 recorded deaths [I quick-and-dirty numbers indicated 10 million could die United States.

Back numbers were: 350 million people, 503594 cases, 18860 deaths. Ratio: 26.7. Extrapolated deaths: 10,230,055.

Today numbers are: 350 million people, 2504676 cases, 126785 deaths. Ratio: 19.75. Extrapolated deaths: 7,567,175.

In two months difference stupid-simple-extrapolated final death tally came 27%. We're still ballpark, mostly national curve, then.

If get nearly entire country wearing masks, washing hands, social distancing looking _millions deaths_ US alone. Texas alone set 600,000 deaths start taking seriously. surprised hear sand stops hurricane season. That‚Äôs insane. really underestimate intricate planet really is. Sucks sacrifice unstoppable growth. oh well money money consider personal preferences arguments no, other. Getting corona absolutely fine.

Forcing others get it? Well would call that...

Your right wave fist ends smacks face popular saying, id say sooner that. 

I think term applies deadly pandemic diseases also forced hope becomes mandatory people smarter yourself.

I say libertarian believing absolute freedom people ideology color creed certain circumstances call concessions particular event, federal state governments use powers far corrupt things matters public health urge look matters concerned freedom wear fucking mask public. Im assuming jusy eager play victim anyways like people position. Good. California needs same. expected live go palliative care. However usually last weeks months. 

A care home us frail, still write off. receive full medical attention unless unlikely survive. judgement giving medication based around quality length life.

Will medical intervention extend life without compromising quality life? medical assistance given. constitutional right worst coronavirus pandemic day yet!

Trump 2020 still understand works. test 90% accurate, mean margin error 10%? 10% tests would wrong results? come 70% wrong. mean accuracy 30% correct? test 1 million people test 90% accurate, tests (no matter positive negative result) expect result 90% accurate. Even take positive results. Let's say 20% aka 200,000 people tested positive antibodies. mean 10% could false positives test 90% accurate? Black lives matter rioters social distancing types guess Apocalypse day !!!  mean lockdowns worked Europe, Asia, Australasia. Problem America implemented half arse job barely stunted spread. America essentially Swedish method lockdown. agree lockdown feasible economy can't handle much strain Christ gotta hope people start wearing masks social distancing.  point? Give time. It'll catch up. mssive outbreak New York City/NY/NJ. got contained, cases went steady decline. hiding decline fact pretty much rest US got infected. probably exponential growth again.

But yeah.. ""iT sLoWiNg"" asked months ago sub got down-voted depths Davey Jones locker. make testing illegal. cases. Boom. Solved. welcome. Hard believe (well really) Pence saying ""There coronovirus second wave"" media creating ""panic"" ""celebrating"" Trump accomplished *last week*. And? outbreak caused BLM protests. populace shown give fuck covid, can't control pandemic shutting down. let economy completely ruined people going shit anyways. I'm competitive though. Id say necessary, low numbers result people aymptomatic mild never went hospital. really affected medical care availability  Holy shit imagine actually posting terrible take. would worse cold? know Netherlands even harshest part lockdown kids 12 allowed play outside matter social distance. ask apparently works. Primary schools one first things open, apparently problem.  disgrace. ‚ÄúSome cities set ‚Äúpop up‚Äù COVID-19 testing stations protesters unrest took off. initial results testing support idea relatively little transmission coronavirus happened Black Lives Matter protests. Seattle, less 1% tested positive COVID-19, according statement mayor‚Äôs office released June 12. Boston, 2.5% protesters tested came back positive coronavirus ‚Äî roughly line numbers city whole. Minneapolis figure 1.8%, Wired reported last week.‚Äù 100% useful pandemics. designed it. pandemic spread like crazy coved 19 patients arrive. you‚Äôre thinking take normal patients.....good luck that.  see article 'The secondary source infection workplace settings'. people wearing masks workplace, workplace inside meaning easier infect people COVID? declared without reliable affordable tests available? scum.

An unfortunate conundrum. 

If like us (I assume) taken plethora precautions gone beyond education everyone admits we're scum, really true we're pinnacle proper etiquette, happen lumped together assholes. 

If single certain groups hide behind circulatory arguments never go anywhere often completely baseless: ""god says ____"", ""That's discrimination beliefs"", "" conspiracy!"" 

Really makes angry entirety country, no, world, suffer vocal minority fucks everything spreading like cancer terrible mediums like Facebook biased news groups. number patients covid-19 intensive care units Sweden continues decline 200. 

\[comparison cases development Gothenburg Stockholm;\]

\*\*No big margin\*\*

\[continues comparison Gbg Stockholm\]

Bj√∂rn Persson head operations ICU Karolinska Hospital Huddinge Solna Stockholm, takes care largest proportion covid-patients need intensive care region. believes patients getting fewer partly due different infection dynamic \[""smittspridningsl√§ge""\], partly fact treatment become better finally risk groups may become better protecting themselves.

\- time, get ordinary intensive care patients society opens up.

\*\*""Don't let guard down""\*\*

He \[Persson\] says situation control right now, example midsummer celebrations demonstrations causing concern. possible say whether trend fewer new covid patients ICU continue.

\- new peak comes now, ordinary patients \[on ICU\], extremely tough.

The trend also positive V√§stra G√∂taland recently, Peter Dahm also wants point importance continuing follow restrictions:

\- let guard now, continue keep social distance stick together. can't relax, even want to, even great desire population relax now, work ICU see drastic results covid infection. \[This sentence bit weird even Swedish, ""Vi f√•r inte slappna av √§ven om vi vill, det finns en stor √∂nskan befolkningen om det men vi som jobbar IVA ser de drastiska resultaten av en covid-infektion.""\] point would seeing kind spike maybe little one. Still nothing. know really want corona win think might ok one Congratulations graduation! Sounds like less people planet we‚Äôd better state... Tbh imma get downvoted hell I'm great summer Swede lockdown would completely messed :( biased source. Might well use 9gag gonna link buzzfeed. Lmao. Happy cake day good luck you

I actually like job job, 80% people work with. kinda fell it. Something good happen. You‚Äôll right spot right time one day parable fuckin slaps Tell patients I've wait elective removal brain aneurysm cancers ""should removed grows spreads, emergency YET"". 

People die without many ""elective"" surgeries. Please don‚Äôt. know you‚Äôre joking, stress much. 

Just take idea back don‚Äôt ever let again. I'm fairly certain covid early April throat still hurts periodically way did, then. pretty minor symptoms, definitely hallmark ones, reading information people even minor/no symptoms severe lung damage absolutely terrifying me. ever paranoid mortality before, feel terrible everyone right now. We're affected this.  Everyone racist everyone else. rather sad, actually. answer yourself.

And impact others. No. grew Evansville. quite accent Henderson Owensboro Said nation history said planet. unfortunate cycle life.

We knew would happen poorer countries.

That said, every wealthy nation barely fight is. would fund countries help them? end day, it‚Äôll always every nation benefit instance charity kindness.

It‚Äôs sad reality history littered examples it. Astros saved fuckin bell. hope next year nobody forgets promised full season bean-ball tour. ""hospitalizations peak mid-July"" 

pfffffffff... 50 60% populations countries level immunity get affected. Ok, also healthy people.

In case, Corona mutations around least 10 000 years. human body learned handle them. body healthy human learn also mutation.

The game known name evolution. OkAY Well cause big chunk blind followers die corona rate. Calling inconvenience joke, really. barely makes difference much effort expend trying breathe. wear glasses, yeah fog up, care. understand safety mask provides others. live state reauires masks fully reopened, saddening watching number cases half country ballooning faster March.

If feelings hurt asked help protect yourself, family friends, community, even country, need grow up. Home depot tryed force community srvice time threat written didnt make hours later

Theyre shit Yeah, mask allow literally identify certified asshole... Opposite order. Removed bot, asked mods re-post it. I'll see take ""removed"" flag, lot people see video essay. Karens wanting gather around get haircuts go spread virus.   Wait Trump tweeted virus numbers way ... Wait... What? Could lying? way one could afford American health care system. Attending party literally means instant death virus IFR 0.5%. guess thought ignoring would make go away. Completely irrelevant. dealing 1918 flu, thankfully. killed mostly younger people. speculate older people immunity surviving previous, similar pandemic decades earlier.

We know Covid-19 kills mostly older people actual expert believes likely change.  Floyd would loved freedom breathe. bread hicks want attention right act like selfish c*nts Damn we‚Äôre screwed .  words, doctor Sweeden, check video.

He campaign get government provide oxigen everyone needs it, instead palliative care. explanation decisions he's made he's possessed ghost Osama bin Laden. reference: 

Less 10% tests US positive Covid.

In Brazil it‚Äôs ~50% testing positive. 100,000 treated per year injuries police. 

I personally think larger issue crime treat working class like shit. Give 40 hour worker health care stability, suddenly people disinterested looting. Presumably, also sort asshole illegally parks handicapped spaces drives shoulder pass others, ignores pedestrian stop signs, cuts line, nobody ever taught selfish jerk. think Sweden see normal tourism levels, people visiting Sweden Swedes traveling Sweden. Trust lakes packed RVs people swimming right now. üö®üëÆüö®Reddit Snitchüö®üëÆüö® stop testing lol Mad lads tell ya whhhuut. Thanks. definitely got lucky regard.. far least. Deaths still coming down, cases Ireland. truth hurts. important actually elect leaders bullshit cronies. politicians declared dangerous. Esports also. Even though online tournaments much spectacle LAN tournaments, better nothing. simply true. wishing covid kill thousands people disagree with? No. Even though COVID surging now, keeping cases bought scientists time research people willing time armor up. actually two medications seem directly helpful. know use respirators last ditch measures, although needed, first try positional changes methods improving oxygen intake. understand COVID vascular impacts know cytokine storm provoke. bought time get closer vaccine. Many people cloth masks, though everyone wear them, least want access them. though still enough, PPE producing companies time least increase production some. 

I could keep going get point. feels pointless, know. nothing, holding even brief months enough save many many lives. IFR less .09%? Oh come gimme break... Stay strong! It‚Äôs tough, know. Agreed upvoted anyway Based one what? I'm curious compare Bethesda get better perspective size. Forgot post petition keep Disney World closed, anyone inclined sign it: Thanks. Goodluck. Karens wanted haircuts restaurants. It‚Äôs devastating. exactly company first weeks pandemic. sent everyone home, proceeded fire several coworkers without notice. sort bait switch, easy forget someone longer see every day. give idea bad panic is, get footy games need show drivers licence prove Melbourne ... Good luck recovery. could technically necessary evil. Waking people blatant abuses power politics driven greed. sounds like covid suddenly makes inconveniences personal problems irrelevant.

You might consider civic duty still inconvenient.

Also, nursing home drastically different situation ""Everyone olbiged wear masks everywhere boo covid hoo""

Look say masks work. Ive wearing months time left house. doesnt mean inconvenient, doesnt mean wasnt pissed doesnt mean happy wear one.  pathetic hope succumb Darwinism Petition keep Disney World closed, anyone inclined sign it: Thanks. person holding doesn‚Äôt wear mask, especially family‚Äôs safety? stupid be? Yeah somewhat explains pattern US. Feb, Mar April places like Florida Arizona nice weather - 70‚Äôs 80‚Äôs degrees F. hit higher temperature like 90‚Äôs higher humidity, folks went inside malls, restaurants, bars, gyms family gatherings. 

Of course explanation pattern never controlled virus first place opened masks contact tracing g place. loved one shouldnt around people. Grandma stay home. chat phone. She‚Äôll fine. young, healthy people want live life able to. Dont want take small risk? stay home. Covid isnt going away anytime soon. cant live fear locked forever. 

The guys got point. lockdown stuff affects people. Mental health important physical health.

Also, somethings gotta kill old people. sounds mean gotta something... cancer, dementia, sickness, falling downstairs, etc. Bay Area way god... want go path, use America continent, narrow North America. cite quantitative sources Outside vs inside mean awful lot mention poor students don‚Äôt reliable access internet. ""Americans Disabilities Act"", ""Americans Disability act""

Also, legit, URL would ftbagency.gov ftbagency.com

You tell people take pandemic seriously fucking idiots. Even shit make reflection idiocy.

Believe not, ""corrected"" forgery. 1st attempt, spelt ""poses"" ""posses"". Yea I'm clicking buzz feed news. Good try tho. Texas gets fucking sandstorms?! sort mind killer, Shai-Hulud, shit this? love different cultures convey basic ideas lense context. Thank sharing expression! man much virus. needs put isolation mike muted. Still threat largely control (Germany etc) near enough eradicated (NZ) stark comparison US. Yeah case would unreliable source, posted Telegraph article instead. However also reported BBC News channel references study, hopefully okay. Yes people tested found covid-19 antibodies.

The county live zero people hospital covid.

ZERO PEOPLE HOSPITAL COUNTY.

Like NONE  Trump said schools open time, ""full blast"" love Malcolm Jenkins. Philly never let go. Within week US die day. mean know fact lot people asymptomatic even minor symptoms still might able get test lot places country completely logical. guess happened NYC register anyway.... shame quite sad lessons learned.

And frankly, going stay shelter - wear mask. Science (Epidemiological logic, calculations history) says US even done initial work required;

Read better understand common sense actions required US now; protests you‚Äôd see surge cases lined protests are. You‚Äôre not. tried post suggesting certain recent actions may contributed this, post auto deleted.

Look, Trump rallies bad idea. protests.

Both sides ignoring science expedient. result, literally killing yourselves.

Long ago pretty sure return America, I'm certain. ‚ÄúI hard time talking.‚Äù

Bitch, wear mask 8 hours day. hear fine. Pull shit back stop disrespecting me. also know long terms effects.

We also know *the incidence* long-term effects.

Some people getting lung scarring. That's something get over. *know* long-term effects, enough data know likely severe, afaik.

It's unreasonable expect COVID-19 career ending elite athletes. least, that's understanding layman. Lol fuck Ding.
Ding.
Ding.

It‚Äôs crazy you‚Äôll see people assets, complete lifetime responsibility healthcare.

But anti maskers still base, like pull masks get stores, don‚Äôt get literally shop hundreds stores area don‚Äôt require masks. think long Scandinavian winter depressive impact population. want go South get sunshine (and Vitamin D) stay healthy winter. Stockholm 59¬∞N, Toronto 43¬∞N, Toronto far sunshine winter Stockholm.

It seems learn repercussions earlier decisions. everyone died - no, WANT VACATION!

WTF. assume anarchy rioting also don‚Äôt help spread. thing Italy, new clusters popping everywhere situation going hand fast winning sick! Stay tuned, folks would say danger attributed amount virus communities. lots countries lots testing still low numbers. countries considered safe. testing enough make safe country. lot testing, safe country unknown state virus. lot testing lot cases still unsafe country. High testing low cases safe countries. Sweden worried losing tourism categorization fair categorization.  forgot add ""god intends us fall, god's will..."" Yes, deaths decreased state. need posts like sub! 41?! Can‚Äôt get Frosty temperatures increase beyond range comfort though, people spend time indoors, spreads virus.

lmao climate change making future pandemics worse (among other) reason article year old samples testing positive barcelona sewers nonsense? Lockdowns work end unless somehow manage 100% eliminate it. got one case would again. buy time, squandered. don‚Äôt know realize much 20% dead would completely collapse country. wouldn‚Äôt rich. Maybe, maybe not, either way cases per million 2nd worst world deaths per million 4th worst: hardly even matters ""it's serious, take care"" *better*, still horrible.

All conservative pundits love Sweden's approach 6-8 weeks ago, dead silent now.  chatting cafe (outside least ten feet apart) guy teaches inner city ""Restart Team"". Never seen man defeated work. Budget cut 20%, must reduce class size 10 students per room current avg sits around 18/class K-12. Bussing carry 8 students/trip. teacher shows symptoms Covid 19 must self isolate 14 days. summary, district needs hire hundreds bus drivers, substitute teachers, full time teachers, find space spread kids operating 20% less money last year which, words, ""was far needed begin with"". Quick Trump. guessing field hospital would faster easier correct. Masks lose efficiency solid, solid mask still better none. multiple masks Turkmenistan solution. see. Whys that? would assume cold ppl stay inside self quarantine cold clearly city taking place. NYC take two weeks protests take full swing. took two days, causing curfew put place couple days that. 

Look timeline. question hospitals doing? hearing overwhelmed all.  

So maybe cases up, severity moderate people sick home?  mean Mexico beer, right? He‚Äôd getting it* hope they've checked samples recent contamination. Strokes really terrifying heartbreaking. :( easy act like they're completely different group people even true, similar California.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* confusing 50% entire population 50% subset population. understand this, let go notion error margin trust numbers.

We test 100 people, 1 antibodies. 1, 50.
The test returns 98 negatives, 2 positives.

The 98 negatives true negatives (none 1 sick person)

Of 2 positives, one antibodies, one not.

The test 99% accurate (out 100 people, got one wrong).

Here's important part:

** Among 2 persons tested positive, 50% antibodies. ** means rest 50 % false positive rate. 2 positive tests, tested 1 incorrectly: 1/2 = 50%. 50% positive tests actually antibodies.

These two different metrics. Accuracy largely bad, false positive rate useful. Useling, 71, considers one lucky ones: Port Washington part Ozaukee County, unlike half-dozen counties cities across Wisconsin interpreted court‚Äôs decision unfettered green would stay closed? ... got mortgages bills. god, kept going would broke,‚Äù told Reuters. ‚ÄúThis country supposed free basically sum's up. government's failure give everyone large monthly tax-free stimulus something else debt cancellation putting pressure lot people say, ""I've got bills pay!""

something like 78% people claim live paycheck paycheck. really shock go back work even unsafe conditions. need massive new welfare program, even temporary like soup kitchens, live among mostly intelligent. petulant children think ""liberty"" means ""act like fucking 6 year old."" JFC. society many laws protect society whole. done two months ago... mention football players getting sick members community too. Alabama slated play USC first game. takes one player SC pass somebody Alabama BOOM. brand new community infection state halfway across country. girlfriend incredibly happy MLB coming back. bought muncy Jersey, got MOOKIE betts Jersey. got bit upset told really get hopes up. logistics sheer amount people needed make college football work sports general insane. Even numbers half would still terrible idea. Sports wait. defining ""public space""? think regionally.

I saw chart day two ago showed Bay Area county cases basically flat, whereas rest California climbing steeply. new cases concentrated southern California. Covid-19 birthday present. People still fully aware virus warnings place.  reason double roll TP disappeared cheap thin crappy TP sold marked prices. Next time going hoard double length TP hate pay double length price crappy crap paper.
The tinned food prices go started get back normal price
M No. main reason US got control leader incompetent idiot people stupidly entitled ""MUH FREEDOM!"" crap, refused take even minimum containment measures.

FFS, still today refuse wear masks even creating fake government cards avoid wearing them! precious Donny killed Americans neglect three months Viet fucking Cong six years. Right. almost none N95-99s fit seal properly. filter rated that, doesn‚Äôt fit face doesn‚Äôt mean anything really. rubber seals changeable cloth N95 filter. work, almost one them, can‚Äôt even convince people wear they‚Äôre bulky people complain they‚Äôre hot outside. also restrict breathing bit (which it‚Äôs *supposed* it‚Äôs actually working like should). btw, video ""happening"" like beginning ER/hospital overwhelmed? 

Or spread Health care personal finally prepared manage influx now? Yea yea yea. Heard argument seatbelts too. using cellphone driving.......

. What's proud of?

We showed entire world America defeated paper masks... 

""Wear mask""

""ITS KILLING ME!!!!"" Like what? thought numbers highest far ... highest since March Like shut HARD 2-4 weeks US instead wishy-washy awful response we'd much better shape. NYC I'll raise Houston, Floyd born. doing?

You can't name one isolated incident point proof. "" potentially 50% cases never show symptoms never tested confirmed.""

Ok basing never tested confirmed people, since there's way know many are, POTENTIALLY must super high meaning joke, gotcha. Would love hear ""reasoning"" behind making leap defunding police Sharia law. even see remotely tangential connection there. rough rough decade.  crazy foreign countries successfully slowed/reduced prevalence virus actually built strategies AROUND U.S. SCIENTISTS' ADVICE... yet country we're like ""nah ain't listening nerd tell do!""

We suck. Doesn‚Äôt mean Chinese carried virus Spain earlier 2019 March? governor toadie wants people go beaches. Umm...thats like worst idea ever right now. Corona spreading like wildfire wasnt contained early...now deal it.

Post data even people stay away they're hiding something. Knowledge power. Yep, can't get overrun accept patients first place. Hospitals go along want protect elective procedure revenues. I've literally changed going store going Menards area.

They store requiring masks... store brave enough turn people away mask.

Every store caved. want, lick walls, rub face others, 6000 people one aisle? Rookie numbers. Get numbers up. needs bigger bomb Nagasaki Hiroshima, total deaths 146,000 free believe whatever want. Usually everyone leaves areas go nice ones (Pitt Philly) gets f state. Careful, mods remove comment mine day saying this. I've pleasantly surprised.

About 2 weeks ago saw guy walk gas station, mask. sees sign says ""oh yeah. Shit."" goes back car, pops trunk, finds flannel shirt wraps completely around face secures it. kinda wholesome. Like NY, right? hope right. best German friends! Americans able take responsibility anything, blame everyone else everything? get bad states...but countries Europe pushing 15-20% fatality rates among people contract covid. 

Simply numbers meaningless. America bigger, people, cities etc. way numbers big. 

But balanced per capita, good fatality wise. You‚Äôre correct. They‚Äôve able create vaccine coronavirus dogs, humans. could go ahead stop testing, that'd great... Meanwhile, press reporting mortality rate figures 5% 10% entire time, completely irresponsible. Maybe around years, happened november mutation making severe?

Or contaminated samples. family work healthcare Buffalo NY see Canadian patients daily yeah, there's truth that. wait see specialist Canada much longer Buffalo, leading healthcare centers country, like Roswell University Buffalo. Canadian system great dealing routine managed illnesses like diabetes fucking insulin prices, fix emergency things like broken leg pregnancy gone labor quite quickly, getting hip replacement, seeing cardiologist getting mammogram take time. family seen people come get breast cancer colon cancer diagnosed much quicker Roswell preventative medicine much urgent priority Canada. Gastro doctors particular take much longer see. one person came needing gall bladder surgery got much quicker here. couple week wait instead months Canada.

Since Canadians paying good deal taxes deal issues (i friend Toronto never goes eat costs way higher Canada help pay ), understand degree people want it. pay taxes system, able get services need promptly go without . people may say hip replacements elective, many older people, getting one mean early death shitty life minimium. cancer, like colon, diagnosed late terrible. Gall bladder pain make life miserable waiting removal. gall bladder removed attacks pain able eat sucked. pay taxes wait months longer did, would kind pissed.

Many people US pay much healthcare due work helping subsidies state federal government some, that's another issue.

I think need alot increase access affordable healthcare. Canada issues though get around ridiculous aut omod put place prevent criticism red-aligned US party. FAA authority make masks mandatory airports airplanes? Yeah, like fuck?! guy really crying theme parks/borders closed midst pandemic la ""Won't somebody please think children?!"" Physical therapy helping quite bit, massage places open back certainly interested trying this. 3000 deaths day, 150 days, you‚Äôre talking 450,000 deaths top now, that‚Äôs giving another 39 days ramp 3000 per day. 

The people never accept another lockdown. ones safe continue safe. it‚Äôs going get increasingly risky go people get sick. 

And know damn well people country still large gatherings Thanksgiving Christmas. Combine comfortable way host Christmas outside places, recipe disaster, like family Texas 1 person unknowingly sick infected 18 25 family members. That‚Äôs happened multiple times now. would anyone risk that? America first. AMERICA FIRST! Waiiiit... 90+% redditors here, dont vote, assuming ""surely need time right right"".... 

We get four years this. Gratz advance :\ Thank goodness pandemic finally over... agree this. Yes see death hospitalization rate climb follow past rise cases, agree probably ""close"" number cases out. 

Previously almost exclusively reserving testing people admitted hospital. Now, anyone get test I'm places. 

We simply see % positive cases hospitalized exclusively testing hospitalized people. worrying seems think PR important virus. matter increase due testing? implies lack testing meant unaware people community past infecting people unbeknownst them, bad news story saying spike cases. Massachusetts. asking them. calculation Worldometer calculated IFR NY sereology 1.4% included excess deaths. model excess deaths included great use. 

For rough eyeballing Worldometer data 1% easy use. add two zeros deaths compare new cases 14 days earlier. countries got control got two numbers pretty close good target. unknown cases great way ensure new outbreaks. 

If latest outbreak significantly spread protests, average age infection could substantially lower leading fairly low IFR. least they're outside. Yes. I'd add keep hand sanitizer car remember avoid touching face.

It becomes normal routine. Fuckin dumb ass Texas. I've suck ass lockdown since March, depressed mind toddler single parent. dumb fuck Texas going shoot virus states get us all. Fuck you, Texas. Go blue go home 'yet' gets reason. Original article 22/6 shared reddit: translation archive link, interested checking original.

But interesting part really stressed April, 56 percent said great confidence ability authorities general deal corona crisis. June, percentage dropped 45. period, low confidence rose 21 29 percent.  pattern seen DN / Ipsos particular asks authority center. April, 69 per cent stated great confidence Public Health Authority \[FHM\] 57 June. drama's main character, state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell, slightly better, confidence also fallen him, 69 60 percent.   applies assessment politicians' efforts. proportion believe government handled infection well falls 50 per cent May 38 June. Prime Minister Stefan L√∂fven's figures fall 49 39 percent.

The trust Tegnell FHM still around 60% - could lot people make distinction Public Health Authority's recommendations measures taken different levels government (which something Authority control). Something lot people sub differentiate. abused entitled customers. rudest, dumbest, self centered people make bulk people willing dine right now. think he's German  news... Water wet. America 13% black 17% Hispanic. would bother half? Unemployment full time worker Alabama (a really poor, cheap state) $265 week. Add boost got $865 week. 

in one cheapest worst states people getting $3,500 US dollars month. 

and got $1200 cherry top.

if that's little live privileged fuck. 


also going back $500 billion bailouts. loans. free money like unemployment stimulus. Thank fucking god wasn‚Äôt Florida time. easier shift blame anyone else accept fucked up. 

The virus might come Europe, arrived China Europe. And, besides, US sure Europe primary vector, ban EU flights sooner? playing devil's advocate here... fighting rights inherently mean can't also blamed spreading virus. blaming current outbreak. saying matter virus.
.

Also LAG TIME!!!. know full impact protestors another week 2. protest really full swing 3 2 weeks ago. 2 week incubation period virus, plus usually people feel bad days week seeking medical care. can't say impact protestors had, yet, also can't ready dismiss good cause. cant guys wear damn mask? 120 000 deaths enough No, like motorcade get fine runs red light. SE MI North you.

People WAY relaxed back normal.

It's like there's ""no virus anymore""..party on!

There's big (huge) boat party called Jobbie Nooner Detroit area coming up. Thousands thousands people, clustered close / top partying up. Yeah, police announced yesterday ""won't (be able to) enforce social distancing"". bet bottom dollar precisely ZERO wearing masks. Fuck this. Solidarity better. Back office ‚Äúthat‚Äôs things done‚Äù despite mostly smooth work home experience. missing wedding. earth possibly worst US president time happen power worst pandemic 100 years? chances two short periods time aligning. You‚Äôd swear karmic thing war suffering US waged world. America 1. Someone kept election promise. Close foreclosure. places like allowed open pandemic. Honestly I‚Äôm adept driving around Southern California still fucking trips up. mom moved rural Oregon 70s valley. worked West Hollywood deathly afraid driving freeways. said would always take back roads would take upwards hour. don‚Äôt envy people experience first time Yup it‚Äôs nuts people say don‚Äôt want high taxes. pay income tax, social security etc normal taxes. Plus, medical insurance 10% gross pay. still need pay insane prices get care. Like wtf. continue defend people social distancing invariably spreading COVID-19 pointing one incident thousand gathered that's pinnacle infection spread.

I love ignoring direct correlation protests (not following social distancing guidelines) surge COVID cases respective cities, seem think whataboutism of, ""Oh yeah? Trump held rally Tulsa, that's going spread COVID too"" somehow valid response. Face it, recent protests impact COVID transmission. Whether Trump's Tulsa rally ""worse"" irrelevant, since one-time relatively small event, compared hundreds thousands gathered protest support BLM agenda. keep focusing 6,000 person gathering ignoring hundreds thousands protesters/rioters largely responsible surge COVID cases.  haven‚Äôt see water fountain covered trash bags since March. national graph. use national numbers. 

Great, see month gaze enormous infection numbers/death toll Atleast consistency. 

I know bad. governments supposed act. Australian here, considering locking 30 cases per day state 5 million. Please vote, american politicians sound ridiculous. president. Vote senator, house rep, governor, state representative, state senator, judges (if state uses option), city, council, every single level. That‚Äôs way america bastion democracy read revered realised truth. mean... hope terrible things happen fact remains absent extraordinary exceptions fatal old sick.

Stay scared though, guess. you. Exactly. Rates Italy, France, etc start rising like South Korea Israel. get people go traveling right even less governments opening borders begin with. shocked one attacking administrations terrible failure letting millions people airplanes hot spots adamant stopping small cruise ships .

Why didn‚Äôt quarantine flights cruises .. logic 44 percent fucking morons? Epidemiologists saying IFR ballpark .5-1% long time now. 

Even February estimated .66%. him/her missing wedding virus likely catch wedding? Pffft. surgeries (I six 2018) average 35K pop. checked discharged without overnights. Overnights get costs balloon. also 3 months chemo afterward. I've actually never looked bills chemo, already depressed enough without actually reckoning actual costs.

 believe pocket 8K dust setttled. Again, Insurance covered it. thought said wasn‚Äôt civilian. isn‚Äôt citizen. want see birth certificate. Put cage. unusual consistency numbers Russia Belarus really lead trust countries. Oh check model - it‚Äôs 1000 times sophisticated mine! Really nice!

I perform simple calculation undercount - number confirmed x actual confirmed ratio x days major symptoms show. simply

40000 X 6 x 5 = 1,200,000 infected.

The infected number I‚Äôm sure higher, I‚Äôm trying capture walking around pre-symptomatic asymptomatic (spreading) home sick hospitals Uh buddy. get tested HIV. Explain gay men test negative can't donate? 

It's homophobia science quiet please. dude drinking soda rollercoaster??? worse that. Immunity finite timespan fades (yet determined covid). lasts 18 months point first days 1.26m need re-infecting again. Tell proactive. That's word bosses love Hard stop slogan ¬´You‚Äôll never walk alone¬ª guys split mass eastern western mass; eastern mass merge Rhode Island CT western part nobody cares about. goes up. interesting Swedish public opinion turned summer travels med put doubt.  aunt FA 40s flies international home almost three months. said they've getting paid idk long last. Political parties. site says county 3 total cases. Maybe true back beginning April. estimate 30 days average 50,000 day 6/25. So, maybe 4 days earlier we'll hit chance. I'll go July 18th. don‚Äôt see schools opened time soon. worry Mike Pence case. One day dream reality. Hopefully kid. fight vote every chance. Unfortunately loud minority controls shots. UK locked Australia that's bullshit. Sweden's strategy sacrifice lives money thought slowed testing down... ROFL... dumbshit.... They'll still manage make life dangerous people can't get vaccinated legitimate medical reasons. Ex-presidents meeting Sorry. Tear gas antiviral? bet moneyed powerful account much infections. states could conceivably physically Hawaii (they already are) Alaska. 48 contiguous states, no. many access points. huge protests Massachusetts we're still hovering around 180-200 cases day. definitely reopening thing. sure go 2 months? Like they're already sick-o mode. Ba dum tsss. happens death rate key resources run hospitals get overwhelmed critical patients happened countries? wishful thinking. scientific evidence virus behaves differently China Europe. Even CFRs testing/outbreak scenarios add up. I'm afraid matter try 'cook books', impact hospitals overrun never downplayed. People see impact virus, matter want spin it. even actually know defeated C-19 gives meaningful immunity future exposure. way Honestly I‚Äôd take waits decide medical care vs feeding family. narrative lockdown lockdown equal strategies. aren't. Sweden threw away thousands lives sake money 1. Technically still enforce internal EU border controls limit flight's. that's totally possible.

2. Longshot NJ

Dang, sweet country might say. Wrong. tracking death rates? infection rates higher, treatments hopefully mitigate deaths happening imagine hospitals full overrun, it'll get much worse. Italy noticed problem late. found first case dead person Bergamo hospital long acting superspreader event city. would look specific school interested in. 

And keeps changing. people realize kind panels need installed 100% capacity (don't give answer trigger removal) 
USA #1
USA #1
USA #1
USA #1

USA #1
USA #1 Yet death rate 0.24% national graph. use national numbers. 

Florida, Texas, Arizona, California obvious surges. tell capacity hospitals. need take drastic measures combat virus. measures need pushed nationally. great test people's agreeableness trait. hesitate second go, probably berate way out.

Then disagreeable hell, superpower comes downsides. got money government, least case. know exactly Sweden, Restaurants, bars etc get money lot less guests also fire staff point might even worth stay open enough guests. crime. Depends, know someone pretty well went US last year expand business apparently issues US face. lots money stop step homeless people covering streets unless rich enough live far away poor people. currently stuck US 3 month long waiting list get back home. you‚Äôre going someone over, that‚Äôs way it. It‚Äôs completely safe doubt either wearing properly fitted sealed masks, it‚Äôs safer alternative. How‚Äôd massive protest rallies work out? Trustworthiness. 

It matters. Words doctor (not me). ‚ÄúIf wear glasses fog wearing mask, wrong‚Äù. seal top opening. harder calculate that, also ""excess deaths"". Right now, limited testing states testing living people. people die tested (or get hospital) labelled 'pneumonia' 'unknown respiratory illness'. real death toll higher, death reporting varies wildly place place, may long time know real death toll here. goal one hated Americans time? thing I‚Äôm appreciating people still wearing masks.

The one wearing certain types people happen cult. saw yesterday CNN. It‚Äôs emblematic imo US‚Äôs societal battle what‚Äôs right vs what‚Äôs right all, perception fact vs fiction. 

My country tired, anxious fatigued current situation, nothing I‚Äôve seen locally compares go total cases doesnt mean lot without context fantastic under-appreciated point. i‚Äôm anxious returning school fall. it‚Äôs extremely frustrating, disheartening depressing see people age living life nothing wrong. know fall semester starts that‚Äôs going continue increase sort outbreak among many college towns. good thing (at least school) mandatory face mask requirement whenever campus. hopefully mitigate number students get day they‚Äôre campus. 

but bet ass stepping anywhere near sort bar/place sort anytime soon ""I can't breathe"" Yep, perfect time ax ACA. Oh well. non issue we're talking actual hospitalizations and/or deaths. Stop making mountain mole hill. ""If slow testing, cases go away"" Common Sense.

The forcing people wear seatbelts, forcing parents enroll children School, forcing people drive drunk... it‚Äôs called Public Safety Welfare, simpleton. pretty similar hear states implemented it. started first lot trouble getting people pick phones since lot us pick unrecognized numbers (since likely spam call - another thing government unwilling regulate). got phone companies show number contact tracing team put public information campaign. Still think less half people picking up. People generally reporting 2-3 close contacts info heard strictest lockdown phase I'm sure going now. least got things rolling early figured supply people things like separate hotel rooms quarantine in, food/med deliveries etc. going 1st grade. may option online send in, learned nothing 9 weeks online kindergarten. feel like risk going person get foundation needs education. Certain states heading way. imagine claiming people idiots glorified link document comes source like costs money.

The House recess Senate July.

They need financing pandemic response. Well that's rather disturbing Ooh, Santos pretty bad too. cases spike, hope people understand need use masks. S√£o Paulo plateau now, masks required law use. read Trumps voice much better. literally...summer began week ago. get you‚Äôre saying though Dude series? result means virus may originate China. like Spanish Flu called Spanish Flu, first reported Spanish media lost mind. get news television get right Reddit. assignment you. Go walk nearest local hospital ask many people 50 years old fighting lives ICU covid-19. thing. county population 100000 people. single fucking soul hospital covid-19.

You part problem. trying spread panic fear non-issue. brainwashing working you. feel bad you. Seriously going take trip hospital it'll make feel lot better. Fuck news sources go investigative journalism China Italy US

Italy many Chinese nationals working factories making world‚Äôs leather products shoes, purses, belts, etc. I've frustrated people cavalier disease. risk, here. Even people young bad case know enough quantify get mild case comes goes without incident, get mild case leaves lingering effects, get moderate case hospitalized people almost surely lingering effects besides enormous medical bills people get serious case kills them. Age sure indicator, neither underlying conditions. need respect virus, slow let science catch get handle it. Also, want contribute computer phone/iPad cause, check out:

Foldingathome.org laptops, desktops, etc

Dreamlab iPhones, androids, iPad, etc Wrong total conjecture Anthony fauci gift state really obvious shit like incredible new discovery. Except need account ""excess deaths"" currently attributed coronavirus. massive spike in, example, deaths pneumonia. many states, limited testing, person dies tested, never tested tests reserved living. 


Estimates put excess deaths anywhere 30-100% confirmed cases. information takes weeks months tally due wild differences state-to-state reporting procedures, long time know truth. ship meant non-covid intakes.  problem us situation, millions people need somewhere work. can't live good life home forever, ultimately depends lot economy moving. Money mostly spent bottom bubbles up. way around.  It‚Äôs freeeddoooomm know. USA! USA! USA! RIGHT ENDANGER LIVES LIVES OTHERS That's problem new disease, know gow works without deaths... That's medicine generally works.  know else draws flies? Corpses. That, even though exactly restrictions, took recommendations FHM seriously meant people avoided gatherings travels within country, worked home etc. reason curve started flatten pretty simple - people followed guidelines put forth FHM attempt flatten curve.  Yes definitely agree special ed kids come back. Maybe *this* crisis bring people together.

I'm trying hard stay hopeful sound like broken record point. wish case expect shitshow. optimist realist. Karens sue government hey, new York huge deal everyone locked horrifying scenes news but.. lot places fully open, one wearing masks? I'm baffled. yall need wait til deaths start happening people start seriously giving shit? take long cases increase exponentially I'm still finding hard believe many people think wearing mask cuts somehow freedom. extraordinarily stupid can't even fully understand thinking process gets conclusion. cannot shut country due super flu. .2% mortality rate. Please stop nonsense. people high risk need quarantine themselves. life works. Get people. matter many yall upvote give awards comments support fear mongering, change facts. ‚ÄúIf us valued food cheer song hoarded gold, would merrier world.‚Äù So, going make dumb claim play virus again?

Wow don‚Äôt miss MarchÔøº shut A/C stores, maybe solve problem. Also, think savings electricity! ‚ÄúIf cut testing half cut people half.‚Äù Mask requirements enforces, mostly, peer pressure. Officials talk it, explain needed, important, *ask* people comply.  individuals comply soon understand needed.  Others comply reminded friends coworkers. People without masks shunned ...  process works social pressure.  possible fine is, basically, one element social pressure.

He‚Äôs trying convince wear mask best approach. recently pusblished paper reputed journal shows far-UVC light kills virus air exposed it.

Yes summer indirectly helps reducing airborne transmission sunlight hours longer also intensity (as compared winters)

Same logic also one reason flu spreads much faster winter summers. proven logic applied here.

Only reason seeing many cases even peak summer sars-cov-2 infectivity far higher normal flu (along higher lethality rate that's different issue). even sunlight rate spread dropping enough stop transmission many people roaming around especially masks. Celebrating 4th never anything national pride, least anyway. BBQ, getting drunk lighting fireworks.

Build bridge get dude. People want clean food pandemic would thought? first lock down?  least you‚Äôre acknowledging increased access testing. That‚Äôs isn‚Äôt going back normal vaccine found survival rates hospitals improve. new baseline functioning economy measured slow spread COVID still working (masks, distancing, telework methods whether 100% much methods utilized).  I'm familiar FL electorate. They'll probably elect another term. least leader accurately represents populace. live U.K. we‚Äôre bad now. Despite packed beaches , reopened shops , BLM protests , illegal raves , parties celebrating Day next mask wearing we‚Äôre still downward trend. 

In part U.K. recorded 15 new cases yesterday deaths. seems like risk could lower think, provided schools vigilant. UV light causes specific pairs DNA bases stick together hit photon, causing errors replication DNA. enough base pairs stuck together DNA can‚Äôt make it‚Äôs programmed make. process invalidates virus one gives sunburn, meaning takes time exposure. 

With infectious Covid is, doesn‚Äôt seem making much difference person person transmission, would ensure things like door handles things outside less sterile. also means better testing. march outbreak, number death spikes death rate cases around 10%. much lower that. might take time, getting better catching cases There‚Äôs already insubstantial subset men don‚Äôt wipe ass think it‚Äôs ‚Äúgay‚Äù. 

Just need amplify well-targeted memes preying male anxiety support bot network two. take everything ignorance he's good person. Would hard reset bad? certainly weird talking ""it'll maybe 2 million deaths instead 10 million"".

They absurd numbers. see point end doesn‚Äôt affect me...the guidelines ‚Äòstay six feet away, wear mask can‚Äôt inside‚Äô. can‚Äôt help pass close others lot, waiting queue get inside (although issue since Monday, capacity increased). 

I get masks pain going wear feel like might well thorough. numbers assuming we've tested every single case, including asymptomatic people aren't.

It's likely there's anywhere 3-10x covid cases tested actual rough dirty numbers would somewhere 1.5-4 million deaths. What's different daycare school?

Shut school, pay daycare?

Same problem.

We screwed weak ass country can't stay fuck home couple weeks.

And president worried getting reelected due economy concerns, going him. thing herd immunity epidemics. maybe vaccinations, time get 60% population, virus would likely mutated strains, start again. problem, sure one ones prepared. Yep saw numbers too. even 10x anywhere 20-30M US, that‚Äôs still 10% population. feel like People try this?...  Simple, misled, people sleeping. New cases scary numbers, better metric looking daily new death counts. indicator negative slope since early May. see right site OP linked.

The way going get herd immunity folks exposed virus. nothing BLM, always said Covid-19 best thing thay could happen BLM. Floyd‚Äôs death got much traction people stuck home nothing better go join protests. glad BLM go attention deserved, sucks circumstances. Could weaker strain. virus replicates host DNA may alter due microbiome person Wish well. Less 1% population wearing masks. Bristol ... literally see 2 people day thousands wearing one. It‚Äôs depressing people acting like it‚Äôs invincible. vaccine comes early next year

Are sure afford that, healthcare plan? expensive much impractical. There's limited number helicopters presumably car accidents Hiking Falls whatever else might need Air transport would already occupied transporting someone several hours helicopter smaller Hospital would hinder emergency responses

I think basic plan start admitting people greatest need , leaving people home would normally checked hospital life threatened.

Whatever probably similar triage plan mass casualty events reporting deaths non-covid, eh 500 percent increase pneumonia happens coronavirus mutates like coronaviruses influenza viruses hit 60% population? Swedish people pretty reasonable follow government recommendations without pushback see US. attitude problems losses would even worse. fair criticize government‚Äôs handling covid19 though; certainly could done protect vulnerable demographics. think we‚Äôre seeing well-meaning populace inadequate leadership awkward uncomfortable career info session I've ever Tesla/SpaceX came school, back 2015 so. working conditions becoming well known, someone asked it. dead silence two engineers looked super nervously stumbled answer talking fulfilling is, working long hours such, still great.

Covid going anyway. happens one particular ( good team ) outbreak playoff run, can't play games!? happens one ( 3rd stringer type player ) team tests positive? one player GOOD player, response different? like even asking question, happens player dies, player life-crippling illness due it? happens players test positive 5 days SUPER BOWL!!! STAR PLAYER can't play!!!!

Does NFL ""play-on""? 

Do think NFL HQ'ers right now... on-going Zoom calls possible scenarios? sure hell do. read voice scary Trump fast enough people still wearing masks everywhere Massachusetts Trump blight America biggest threat nation faces. view pushed various sources social media. look /r/lockdownscepticism mix Christian Conservatives, MAGAs, conspiracy theorists, far right rationalists.. 

They offer interesting perspective tho. Many business failed millions walk streets protesting etc. 

One man's funeral limited 6 people. close friend excluded protest went ahead day. see unfairly put upon. Yesssss
Any time someone says look Elon, become wary kind moral compass have. tend ruled ‚Äúlone wolf‚Äù mentality experience. worst Coronavirus pandemic day FAR.. like Hitler realized lost war said German people perish.

He's losing thinks deserve die that. ""Some people think football matter life death. assure you, much serious that."" every country banning Americans aren't. ecofascism starts cool covid free, right, need mask.

But know covid-free? able get tested everyday? not, safest everyone simply assume infected.

By assuming everyone infected stop spread matter weeks. Stopping spread saves lives. need masks anymore.

I know debate. small temporary inconvenience everyone couple weeks risk death loved ones greatly diminished. worth you? would make vaccine obsolete case who? Basically. theoretically better prepared March mother (a healthcare worker) spoke Florida Aunt suggested cut holes mask better ventilation. like moved there, gotta something water back February foreign nationals began restricted entry though. US nationals returning also supposed quarantine, depending came from. That's misleading. 

We reported highest number cases single day, barely passed previous high set couple months ago. Testing numbers significantly since then, tested many people two months ago today, numbers would much higher. 

There's definitely rise cases happening many states, see increasing number deaths next several weeks, see many daily deaths previous peak. 

Things bad right now, country whole better shape numbers first peaked. Certain states seeing worst days, country not. mean like ""OH no, isnt excess deaths, always killed elderly"" wonder locality plays role, everyone paying attention happening parts country. part Northeast, things feel OK. slowly reopening, masks worn, numbers still dropping. get right declares peace Middle East. What? *How* graph showing 400 new cases day state 6 million horrifying graph showing 5000 new cases day state 21 million. That's 3.5 times population, 12.5 times cases. even looking at!? ‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs got great business sense!‚Äù see... suppose air transport expensive then? I'm gonna leave #ThanksDeSantis Protests started earnest week Memorial Day full swing then. weaponized stupidity looks like. fack Yeah, he's deluding thinking that's key difference. Trying boost immune system fight novel virus difference boosting immune system HIV. virus virus does. Paper: said ""then thought would be"" 2 million deaths model measures taken never table. knew going hit worst worst cases we'd already implemented control measures. Testing knowing numbers. Testing tells people virus, warn others they've contact with. Testing (hopefully) keeps sick people going public quarantined. testing that's done, safer community is. Testing brings infection rate. Alabama way different NY DC surrounding suburbs üòÇ 


I'm sorry ""privileged"" ass want live ala-fuckin-bama. got joint, I'm person basic empathy, understand people struggling havent gotten penny relief. Rent $600 people living sticks. 


Are loans? ""loans"" go to? oversight? 


And again, position competent leadership. rest world listening science we're arguing 600 week support politics wearing masks. Lots things inconvenient people regular part day. Like, hardly need ""tough guy"" survive trauma of.. waiting light turn green. Oh, horror... wanted us tell testing, unfortunately testing. Yeah I'm far Indiana border either time. heard Indiana mask thing well two stores go send pretty compliant think success Illinois containment leading false sense we're clear e open need masks distancing I'm curious we'll 2-3 weeks stage 4 starts today. 

I know someone claims ""know more"" ""read people"". claim Italy bad they've lost people flu cold people realize fatal too. Hmm yeah Italy 35k deaths last looked? 4-5 months? sure flu numbers right /s. like I'm sure Florida's current pneumonia deaths nothing manipulating COVID numbers compared previous years. Target impulse buying...I feel like Ive saved money completely cutting random target trips bored lunch. Poor leadership, citizen protests entitled people refuse believe masks, social distancing even virus itself. end cheesesteak/pork roll abomination pizza bread. Oh man, good luck. Stay safe. Yes came Europe thing institute (ineffective) flight ban China. really failed Leader. lot people think response hoax propagated media political adversary, think people getting sick, think reported simply don‚Äôt see eyes. delved deep Florida‚Äôs department health ‚Äúhave instructed week change numbers begin slowly deleting deaths cases looks like Florida improving next week lead-up July 4, like they‚Äôve ‚Äòmade hump‚Äô.‚Äù

This rehash similar accusations made month ago. fresh, new act. 

Florida strict public records laws. Records state computer databases are, public records. Altering, falsifying destroying public records, *is felony Florida* (Fla Statutes 839.13).  sure looks bad Governor. California redneck yet they're fucked hard well. Texas cities far apart transfer people too. Imagine spokes wheel right middle biggest Hospital around outsides small ones designed overflow big ones big one full small ones around get full serve areas even away hospitals.

If remember right Texas size European Union would make difficult transfer people one side state people edges state could sometimes transferred. New York City started filling sending people far side state two neighboring states much could. fair; masks. Hell, probably less 1% people see outside wear masks country (and population density *much* higher US). coronavirus wave practically point gyms reopening.

It greater cultural behaviour. everyone US wore masks changed behaviour, barely anything would *fundamentally* change (the spread would slower, magically see disappear). Similarly, everyone would behave US, would also get large resurgence.

It systematic failure US government healthcare system. Focusing 'omg wear masks' way find yet another scapegoat (the people wearing mask) instead looking root problem. scapegoats easy, deep cultural introspection hard embarassing.

And yes, say someone lost family members it. logic schools all.  Sorry hear that. Hope super mild you. ideas ended it? Work? Family? guess point *why* number active cases low Norway reopen gyms. situation incredibly different across border Sweden president power implement mask mandate. left opening reopening states. Today‚Äôs ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe real life‚Äù headline. got fucking kidding OH ok :-D yea papers sweden ""this travel summer"", dont see anyone would feal urge travel situation like :-/ don‚Äôt think EU allowing Americans travel Europe July 1. happy read this. Hopefully means virus burns area subsides. also read study virus Sweden *may* mutating weaker strain. ...? December, antibodies around. immune cells ‚Äúremember‚Äù virus see again, make antibodies. negative antibodies doesn‚Äôt mean it.

Saying 'we like China' vast simplification.  Ahhhh! brain can‚Äôt process complex causality! elect spinsters, get spin. It‚Äôs thru know. 'In news; people go places.' Numbers huge dont even fit properly article also Agreed. looting rioting part society evil brought surge upon us. ‚Äúrich‚Äù Texas gets fucked shut down, whole south follow Here, take tinfoil hat, house ... 
How many Australians travelled Northern Italy/the Alps/Europe contribute extensive spread like Europe? realise within Europe travelling borders virus got spread throughout continent several weeks official? Title say us cases one day testing done one day course is. Even magically shut everything today, numbers would still go next two weeks due incubation period we'd likely hit 50k cases started level again. contiguous virus? way, common sense tells us something wrong. fault many Americans stupid. working Canada. Houston one bluest cities Texas.. lines perfectly BLM marches weeks ago, yet somehow still blame Trump LOL I‚Äôve read don‚Äôt see answer it‚Äôs bad emergencies, could explain meant? I‚Äôm baby winter... hope kid likes inside house for, oh, next year? üò≥ banning flights Europe didn‚Äôt fulfill Trump‚Äôs racist agenda.

And besides, it‚Äôs like flights China banned. Iirc, business trips still going strong. Checking back like said would. never got spike past first mild peak. ""COVID unit"" closed 2 months hospital census lowest years bast 3 months. positive cases state, hospitalization COVID still much lower April.


So yea, never turned New York was, guess ""wild speculation"" correct. helps education. hospital emergency services happens receive weird huge spike unrelated, totally covid cases ?

I think denial right there.

You saying 70% hospitals non-covid patients. know got stats let's give benefit doubt there.

It seems like hospitals built function 70% usual capacity, seems reasonable (it's way less expensive way). think hospitals run 5 10% usual capacity ?

This means 30% space available surge epidemic. Right now, space taken. means bed patients. DeSantis living shrug emoji data states references repeating words? Lol ok insane think country would impolde 0.26% death rate virus mostly kills old people. I'm sure China cheering 80 year old's dying nursing homes effect policy anything. business deny service. fundamental right enter store, that's property. store checked this. absolutely deny people entry masks, almost reason too. Oh Lord 44 percent... That‚Äôs they‚Äôre trying figure out. strong antibodies long last. you‚Äôre right, herd immunity likely won‚Äôt work. maybe catching make second time bad, don‚Äôt know yet. it‚Äôs catch influenza multiple times year. won‚Äôt know enough virus years. That's really comparable analogy. Missouri joining soon. set new daily record opened 16th. human race =/= US still can‚Äôt believe many people stupid enough believe nonsense cases countries much warmer climates US point, think Middle East Australia weren‚Äôt immune? Mormons last group opposed wearing uncomfortable extra layers cloth means protect harms way. I'm sure soon protester puts mouth megaphone fined. Nice, testing means cases. 
30 million tests far, one lower per test death rates. 

At first, mess, think getting better. MD! clear China misrepresented impact virus early on. noticed making aggressive moves Hong Kong India? prefer US sources studies China may reason portray virus even worse is.

I found CIDRAP good source information scientist seems like straight shooter careful present known known virus. 

He also way discussing issues accessible knowledgeable viruses, sometimes gives vivid analogies. entire podcast mask one study cloth masks rated 3% effectiveness rate. said wearing mask nose like installing screen doors submarine. idea completely stop pandemic, I‚Äôm sure wouldn‚Äôt work, public disinterest. Essentially, government provides 4-5 weeks worth food, maybe books, every family across nation. complete, ankle monitors would strapped every person America. 4-5 weeks, nobody anything stay occupied homes, virus would die without potential host. spectrum. spectrum. government take control national emergency. Worst pandemic day yet 2: electric boogaloo  well beginning. Even innovative ways reduce contagion maintain social distancing. Ugh sucks family Peru I'm states always keep touch. relatives gotten virus recovered. point, every man themselves. Peru. too. damned do, damned..... Florida, Texas, California Arizona say hello Chinese mandarins 20th century also told Wu Lien-Teh couldnt enforce modern quarantine methods halt spread plague ""cultural differences"".
He proved 'em otherwise.
But Wu Lien-teh? already closed. I'm too. technically one us already virus. wonder wonder kind mental gymnastics they'll come avoid saying ""it's bad control"" ""the president fucking dimwitted clown"". ridiculous attempt trying act like care I'd suggest actually show concern both. Pretty easy cases tied protests specifically instruct doctors ask people test positive virus attended protests performing contact flu always waltzing around. would gone wasn‚Äôt. OP asking makes sense suggested using 2 years 22 months.

What saying makes sense say 18 months. definitely 1 year old, 2 years either - terms numbers also grown goverment ones charge. Swedish cdc separat bransch illegal goverment try influencibg them. think many hospitals used aside early testing. fiance's hospital quickly found little benefit quit using it. not, stay stable 1000 1500 report per day increased testing. Health Care capacities numbers matter, personnel beds much like America, really hope U.K. Europe ban guys flying period time, seems like it‚Äôs going spiral yet control you. deaths? Man, wish state fuck. Fuck Georgia Unfortunately, window hospitals overrun already closed. virus spreading fast, people forgetting virus even exists. measures set impact \~3 weeks now. 

If look New York example, 3 weeks locked hospitalizations imposing strict measures. 

These troublesome times many states, governors need best minimize big hits hospitals take. Exactly. add seriousness matter, show we're bad spot longer optional. think may mistaken re: mixing bloods. fact mistaken testing 

That's UK blood donation website, part NHS. England 3 month wait. because:

The 3-month wait reduce risk recently acquired infections detected screening tests. applies donors whose partners may higher risk blood borne infections. 

The reason delay period exists due combination two things:

Increased risk infection
At population level, men sex men increased risk acquiring certain infections sex.


The gap getting infection able detect it
We test every blood donation small possibility recent infections don‚Äôt get picked may still passed blood.

This period time (called window period) getting infection showing reliably tests.

If someone gives blood window period, blood could contain infection could passed people receive blood.


I've copied pasted that! Explains perfectly thank protestors/rioters food mostly. would know people won‚Äôt passing walk.

Maybe bandana activewear gaitor article clothing cover face walk possible. make sure alone switch mask Lol. Thanks. got one too! wasplike oh hand written letter!.... oh, watchtower pamphlet. trash!

Yeah, first ‚Äògot control‚Äô second ‚Äòget control‚Äô. news early reactions. Maryland everybody wears masks grocery shopping. went Home Depot Memorial Day order new dishwasher everybody saw wearing also.

I think MD's pretty good response. ‚Äúit‚Äôll get worse gets better‚Äù part? It‚Äôs disheartening seeing :(  ""Yeah DIE one guy's loved one died""

Try saying people risk dying. Oh wait, that's daily basis. Ah yes ‚Äúwe go 6 cases 0 soon‚Äù speech?  People bills pay. know countries it, generally Americans can't skip one paycheck. Greatest country world /s sacrifice shitter. Yeah FL fucked.

Incompetent/greedy leaders. Large senior population. Major summer travel destination. Large number uncaring idiots cannot find ways entertain indoors rather risk getting sick bored/creative/productive/safe without thinking anyone else along way (or maybe terrible people, several work medical fields health department yet still think entire thing overblown).

Certainly small fly-by-night sites people barely afford holistic trainers Reiki therapists. Coronavirus Avengers: Age SuckOn? think weather small effect Florida. majority cases correlate easing restrictions, addition fact people actually follow guidelines regarding masks social distancing.

Stupidity problem FL. weather. I'm almost ashamed say it, four years realizing team MAGA pretty much based around pleasure watching libs go apoplectic ""owned""...

I'm looking forward entertainment seeing apoplectic Repugnicants railing tyranny mask laws.

In fact, I'm making popcorn. Yea I‚Äôve pretty clearly established thread understand historical reasons gay men able donate. mean modified version real quote immigrants. protests city massive almost one wore mask 22,384 deaths √∑ 8.39m new Yorkers √∑ 19.9% = 1.34% read entire article, answer.

I'll leave here. People figured right things stop spread deadly disease 16th century. We're sitting debating that. 

Really, one situations ignorance valid knowledge. right operates philosophy that's lead world Covid deaths. opinions masks irrelevant. facts matter. virus kill wear one. worse, kill others wearing one. 

Don't ass. wear fucking mask. love protests. sense well. alive peak cold war back then, put effirt outdo USSR. took national pride it.

With China, we're name calling resorting stereotypes attack them. quite obviously racist. relies trope stereotype Sick man Asia, eventual related imagery. Please correct me, thought herd immunity would work get sick multiple times COVID-19?! None all, cases going important thing. problem. I‚Äôm Alabama see masks go out. avoid going peak shopping times maybe I‚Äôm cautious elderly folks still Ive pretty happy mask wearing Ive seen lately.

Poor critical thinking citizens reason need enforcement global pandemic Bay Area counties largely control. rural parts state facing outbreak currently. Fatality one thing, seeing 30-70% higher hospitalized cases leading long term permanent impacts main thing.

But never hear people talk absolute idiots want base reopen argument around fatality rate small-brained consider fact. Houston still fraction NYC April terms cases deaths per 100k... getting worse every day Maybe hold judgment know answers questions. poorly built system

Poor critical thinking citizens reason need enforcement global pandemic people afraid, sometimes forget we're humans. sure, preventing loss life urgent bringing back sports...but good alive without things enjoy? physiological life hardly end itself. Sweden really perfect predicament implement strategy. population trusts govt. extremely high rate people live single households. dont many dense cities. They're way healthier country (the US) every metric diabetes, obesity, cardiac...etc. also good healthcare system 

This virus spreads rapid pace densely packed indoor areas like bars, spreads household families. Herd immunity Sweden probably much lower states US dense cities half amout single households. city like Houston may need 60% population get infected reach herd immunity...Sweden may need 30-40%. would mean effects herd immunity would felt lower percentage, also hospitalizations, ICU population, deaths would start much lower rate continue decline due factors mentioned.

Sweden couldve handled better protected nursing homes implemented mask regulations indoors. think wouldve largely unscathed done that. Treatment get better, sort threw population wolves mortality rate highest. Still, many countries made fair share mistakes. note- many countries couldve implemented kind strategy due factors Ive mentioned. Yes.... took family remote cabin Wisconsin stayed home 3 months nothing. 

The places went gas stations one trip Walmart groceries weekend. choice words hundreds thousands protested 1 month straight outdoors huge crowds? condemning one side against?

Why cant America view Covid19 threat come together handle it? seriously ridiculous. seen, lot protesters actively wearing masks trying avoid contact much possible. Whereas, people going Trump rallies even think virus real. think heard phrase sometime, come mind translating Spanish version. sentiment behind exactly same! Thank you!! worry significant others around you.

Like tell absolutely \*nothing\* going get states shut  jesus dude, thing 0.1% mortality rate us, get dangerous people, take precautions, sure, black death, whole ""GOING = DEATH"" thing needs stop Also take account mortality rate go hospital systems grossly overloaded. decent chunk people serious illness require care months years initial diagnosis. cost huge. guess responsible house fires too, take matches away, right? printers working overtime bail banks.

The ship required negative Covid test until
the last couple weeks there. Almost hospitalized patients tested negative (even appendicitis broken leg, appendicitis broken leg PLUS Covid) time. Even finally allowed people admitted without negative test, still non Covid cases. Also, admission process tedious complicated, literally hours phone calls paperwork get admitted, kind time seeing dozens dozens patients every shift.

Except case fatality rate highly misleading figure. reported press, everyone believes looking infection fatality rate.

Confirmed cases necessarily going worst cases, mild asymptomatic cases usually get confirmed, whereas someone hospital unable breathe surely end getting tested virus. course, confirmed cases far likely die typical case.

It's extremely easy mislead people using statistics, important careful statistics reported. 100% false. planes US 737-class use bleed-air system takes air directly low pressure turbine engine recirculates air cabin repeatedly using fans keep cabin pressurized cool.

Karen complaining LOOKED wrong, didn‚Äôt asked put correctly. Yup! 

You'd think people might take one moment consider everyone capable cooking themselves, would require empathy knee-jerk (jerk) reactions. XD Wow, nobody saw coming. would thought reopening midst pandemic would terrible idea. experts warn us. /s many deaths per day guys right now? good immune system stressing time.  Watching crap every single hour everyday going help anything. good take break. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre cooking books we‚Äôre legitimately terrible getting accurate counts pandemic.‚Äù

I‚Äôm sure worse. think 2. difference 12 months 22 months amazing! That's accurate, least United States. Semi-public spaces like shops restaurants cannot turn away business protected reasons. Protected reasons include discrimination protected classes (things like race, religion, sex, given recent supreme court ruling, sexuality). 

The Americans Disabilities Act widesweeping additional law passed 90's also requires businesses make ""reasonable accommodations"" disabilities. controversial time (and sometimes still is) basically massive unfunded mandate. new business - one already compliant substantially renovated - must ensure compliance certain ADA requirements ramps, elevators, even things like specific types door handles specific types bathroom dimensions ('the handicap stall'). 

Of course, clear, really practical disability medical condition would prohibit someone wearing mask still able shop / walk around. addition, ADA would consider endangerment patrons reasonable accommodation. matter way look it, entire notion ADA would stop someone wearing mask ridiculous. 

Plus - greatest irony - people trying pull (literal) card people likely bitched moaned end back 90's ADA passed unlawful interference government control private enterprises/businesses. People can't live outdoors states June July. Heat stroke hospitalizations would least rival virus. Made illegal fire anyone

and fire *at* anyone, too. Well commenting harder put immediate work leads eventually requiring serious work. Bad metephor explained enough sorry :/ Logistically least talking one two cruises versus hundreds thousands planes. thing cruises dont need make living accommodations people count isolate themselves. even imported case US.

How? let US Americans fly in? Sorry sound like **Sweden's** fault resurgence, hopped Sweden train rolls well ... last time U.S. actually learned past. bet think Fox totally unbiased White House Official: Americans ‚ÄúJust Live With‚Äù Massive Coronavirus Surge

He left out:  die either way we're fine it. tank markets. Alternatively, dunk dude.

Who calling people bots better strategy hurting people pandemic. Instead fines, neighborhood outreach like NYC. Traffic cops repurposed hand masks remind people acceptable social distance. 

Fine would work, but, placing economic burden people may already struggling lockdown times answer. tried NYC, disproportionally amount POC getting tickets cops handing masks midtown... want know asked Supreme Court last night, regards Affordable Care Act. Although know, motivation vote go even more. ‚ÄúUh....so masks....probably good idea put on‚Äù funny (sad actually): person replied said ""You can‚Äôt even talk people health safety without going full defensive."" half comments got exactly this. Idk Florida make graph, Texas suspect even though lot cases huge spike, population level massive enough % high enough red. Ditto California. Retardland Yup parents school district wants students go back school fully August! radicalization years watching fox news conservative radio. American thing. dispensary house careful people wearing masks grocery stores do. think idiot. rest us them... pace reach China two weeks. 
Who could seen come? already got hit virus. states seeing spikes haven‚Äôt first wave. live Tucson got tested took almost 3 weeks get results back. Fortunately Tucson mayor made masks mandatory last week majority people (that seen) wear masks follow social distancing rules, still large population morons think wearing mask taking necessary precautions political issue. I've heard countless stories people losing shit causing scene various stores wear mask infringes rights whatever hill fucking morons going die Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. cant imagine kids learning disabilities going right now, want help trying imagine pandemic affected ways can't imagine yet really want argue many hundreds dying fake news nothingburger virus? also adjust numbers many already dying pre-existing conditions, caught virus died instead. Nothing virus worth amount hysteria people trying give it. understand. lead way early lockdown bc leadership understood consequences. changed? see numbers every day realize again? NY ability divert patients resources ways hospital cannot. I‚Äôm willing put money people getting sick ones protesting last three weeks know sound political, Trump administration chosen time request Supreme Court get rid Affordable Care Act. wish making shit up, true, filed briefing Supreme Court last night reason. TRYING provoke revolution, one starts. Swedes strange view constitutes ""discrimination"". ""discrimination"" bar people hot zones traveling places cases: public safety precaution pure simple. reminds one Chinese saying ""racist"" countries closed borders early on. 

But one postive thing article Sweden taken good decision change! 100% fully agree Sweden's choice tell people stay Denmark, despite maybe allowed get tested (which can't teh article states due Sweden's poor testing infrastructure). one better policy decisions they've made *months* now. Congrats, Sweden. Even stopped clock right occasion. Thought trolling Boo hoo. Pull big boy pants tell mommy. Hahahahaha comedy gold. watch science thing. !remind 2 weeks wonder locality plays role

Of course does. polled local area barely touched hit since reopened month ago, people fine reopening. hand go big city like Houston wherever Texas overwhelmed, they're going vehemently reopening. strike contamination real thing....taught school surgical technologists, nurses, doctors, etc..... arent nearly immune ....It back narrative then. Brawndo - got plants crave! trumps fault inner cities throwing parties/BBQs wearing masks. But... muh freedum! invited? sheriff put notice saying planning enforce this. helpful. CEBM bunch jokers. 

The important article peer-reviewed; replace individual clinical judgement, sources cited checked. views expressed commentary represent views authors necessarily host institution, NHS, NIHR, Department Health Social Care. views substitute know physcian interview says second shutdown necessary prevent much hospital overcrowding, even second shutdown help hospitals weeks later. Hospitals still probably deal surge capacity least couple weeks.

The Arizona healthcare system grim future. They're already seeing uptick deaths. :/ lot longer US existence, actually. Roman Republic thing 510-27BC. 

So, 500 years?

At rate it‚Äôs going, would believe US makes stands 2040? Unlikely. day said stay home can? Honestly virus deadly enough, know now, justify full shut downs. Keep wearing masks limit go. 20-25 million people actually infected virus scare vast majority people. 

Be cautious someone live weak immune system allow others make whatever decision feel best family. full scale shutdown pretty useless point virus. Especially protests going on. 

I understand scare, mortality rate two three times flu (I haven‚Äôt checked latest exact numbers please don‚Äôt crucify math doesn‚Äôt perfectly add up) worthy full scale shutdown. People enrage fuck, enraged behind mask. live LA pretty big spike. Right 1 350 people LA actively covid.

I also doctor‚Äôs appointment today condition non-life threatening causing pain. office 40 story building. ride elevator potentially unmasked people.

I considering cancelling appointment putting cases decreasing again. endure pain short think.

Am crazy? ventilator it. It‚Äôs well known phenomenon called ICU delirium. deaths going go way cases going up. density palpable. 2.47 cases us 126k deaths means death rate actually 5.1%, 0.26%. risk management tools overall risk worst category. example, let's say looking risk car breaking long trip. everything low/medium brakes almost worn high risk, overall risk high since brakes likely fail entire car inoperable. would mitigate servicing brakes. remember argument several months ago people using ""per capita"" death rate say ""better"" likes Italy Spain, less deaths.

Since then, US exploded 127,000 - Italy Spain ~35k ~28k respectively.

It take genius tell trend going, said done, countries get ""gold"" fucked most. 3 months late Nah. retrospect, maybe 150 years now, people look US classic tale empires.

I wonder historians pick downfall USSR start US decline 9/11. Guess worn masks like protesters did. become literally grunting noise useless internet mouth-breathers. wear seat belt? wear shirt shoes enter store? feel people walking around nude? forced wear things time two three month old well. locked four weeks point thing coming groceries packages wiped down. Brutal days. Turned kid monster. truthers, good way. generalization they've managed insulate covid US. 

Have seen Asian covid truther?  may true doesn‚Äôt much relevance original article? Unless trying imply % death hospitalised patients go due lack resources, already know isn‚Äôt study arguing against. need examine, carefully, information comes from. sound like perfect example average American consumes news without critical eye dodgy nefarious sources. get killed. son 7 moderately functioning. bites, spits, chews hands. wash hands, positive behavior change managed make. cannot keep everyone else safe school. cannot obtain services needs without school. whole situation sucks. next president sure Maybe wear masks Repost bet gets reposted tomorrow /s suggested italian docs refuted who. Personally unsure believe.

Italian think reality is, we‚Äôre unsure it‚Äôs safer everyone assumes isn‚Äôt case. worrying trend increasing hospitalizations southern states happening right now. States need realize time take action make sure virus spread further. Every day wait another day many people dying... Money money money How‚Äôs hospital prep working south right now? great, doesn‚Äôt change fact ford hardly American made. I‚Äôll buy car based value quality rather misleading made America label commercials talking patriotism. American car manufacturers shit  Yeah stock market measure well economy working measures rich people feeling.  Texas Florida reopened idiotically. Theis virus spreads like wild fire densely packed areas indoors masks, get taken back household spreads there. case areas reopened wisely. havent seen surges. reference, live i. Rochester, NY- many protests, hasnt led surge...yet. also arent anywhere close immunity, take worth. 

evolution

not smart people vote tr **√º** mp tr **√º** mp makes bad covid decisions bad covid decisions kill smart people slightly less dumb people left genetic pool. people read less Dan Brown. first part straight ripped one books. 

Also tech billionaire would try thanos humankind survival would 100% Elon. Pretty much thoughts, considering effectively thing spreads hell would case without us noticing? still don‚Äôt mandatory masks, don‚Äôt even know say anymore... case would think mortality rate far low significantly impact population.... demand refund /s Sounds like you‚Äôre one fetish authoritarianism said 10x previous thought. number death stay 10x infection rate death low. Really low read immediately thought George Bush early 00's. little weird claim ""worst"" tests administered fewer people dying? emotional toll causes? 1/3 black people US suffered loss, that's pretty big emotional impact.

It also shows black community hit disproportionately high compared races.

It death totals. one sample. Sounds like data issue, contamination, mislabeling, etc. samples? 60s: ""you know what, maybe falling really best thing do"" live world people see believe it. What's penalty misdemeanor? fine? jail? 

Personally think stiff fine would make people wake little. knowing getting caught without mask outside meant lost $250-$500, people would use them.... anyone would enforce it... Anthony Fauci fuc*ing Chinese spy, don‚Äôt trust him! #Translation

Only Swedes welcome Denmark tomorrow, requires negative corona test.


There mixed attitudes Denmark's new travel guides neighbors Sweden.


For now, longer Swedes work Denmark enter. Swedes stay certain places country well.


- glad come Denmark, feel afraid take infection me, says Mathias T√∏rnqvist Malm√∂. Mathias T√∏rnqvist mind corona tested visit Denmark. 


But thus far Swedes tomorrow go trip Denmark.

In fact, welcome reside Sk√•ne, Halland, Blekinge V√§sterbotten document tested negative covid-19 past 72 hours.

#We capacity test, Denmark requires, says Natasha Khorarsini. 


- way, crazy people Sweden cannot go Denmark. used Denmark part us part Denmark, gives us quite lot problems, think annoying, says resident Natasha Khorarsini.


She thinks requirement testing tough.


- **We capacity carry tests way Denmark requires. go private testing centers, many. causes lot problems us ordinary people**, says.

#'We seen discrimination us'

For Isaac Graby, completely incomprehensible Denmark long denied Sk√•ne-inhabitants visit, welcomes changed Danish rules.

It annoying us, says Isaac Graby Danish rules Swedish visits. 

- work Denmark, I've able come time, addition, think we've seen discrimination us. particularly high death rate here, says.

However, understands well inhabitants Stockholm still cannot go example holidays extended weekend Denmark.

- Stockholm many problems still has. many cousins cousins living Stockholm corona. say, ""Almost everyone know corona,"" says Isaac Graby.

The new Danish travel guides based, among things, number infected persons, must less 20 infected persons per year. 100,000.


The graphic shows many tested positive corona per 100,000 Swedish regions.


From tomorrow, Danes travel Europe good conscience, Sweden northern region
V√§sterbotten, advised visit.


The Ministry Foreign Affairs published yesterday.

In addition Sweden, Danes still advised travel Romania, Portugal, United Kingdom, Ireland Malta. due infection pressure countries, local entry restrictions significant quarantine requirements, Foreign Ministry writes.


#Sweden advise traveling Denmark


Travel guidance Swedish side Sound also issued according visits Denmark recommended. Instructions currently valid July 15.

- guidance applies Swedes right now, says Catarina Axelsson, press secretary Swedish Foreign Ministry, according SVT .

- recommendation travel ban. choose responsibility, says.


The recommendation partly due fact difficult get Swedish insurance companies cover various cases may arise traveling Denmark.


Swedes basically advised stay away countries welcome, says Niels Paarup-Petersen, member Parliament Sweden Center Party.

- **It teasing Denmark, grounds come country really allowed be, also certain allowed travel good manner.**


- Ministry Foreign Affairs cannot ensure people brought home if, example, fall ill traveling Denmark. Therefore one discouraged, says.

Sweden's corona strategy different Denmark's.

Distance learning elementary dumpster fire rolling four lane highway. Karen isn‚Äôt going like make citizen arrest police! /r/boneappletea not. Especially bad workers longer claim unemployment, must carefree douchenozzles refuse wear masks, wash hands, stay 6 feet apart big deal. holes. Firstly, repercussions moment states reopened quickly didnt require masks. timeline exponential growth started ramping dates back then. contrary, northeast, opened wisely requires masks, seen surges yet implies surges *so far* cause states opening quickly regulating masks.

Im saying protests wont lead surges, many areas mask wearing encouraged- havent seen signs surges month since protests began. article implied, may due younger people experiencing symptoms, youd think many family members would contracted virus now. Still, may take time exponentially grow, right now, states opening wisely- isnt showing up. I'm surprised seen paper something posted predicts may see increase deaths. lot history data available base prediction on. Unpopular opinion: might great idea tensions law enforcement variety groups high point. need another reason police community negative interactions, hard imagine situations could escalate especially fueled alcohol and/or drugs. Hypothetical: Police spot person wearing mask parking lot public housing. Police goes cite, person says stupid law belligerently claims private property (or run), there's scuffle...

I understand public health ramifications wearing masks. wear one disappointed not, especially college-aged people around here. also think perhaps right time citations.  Yes live Wisconsin use mask whenever go store. get mask shamed time I'll plot ICU increase time. data CDC. Yeah...I also remember officials said evidence masks worked everything would one day disappear. Bet upvoted like coronavirus mass hysteria posts. safe, sorry. Love this.

As keep saying, like wearing mask, going like ventilator, wear dang mask.  first link BBC article seems study. However, age breakout conclusion ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know why‚Äù.

Sounds like incarcerated dead recovered. Yes. don‚Äôt vote governments cowtow types tho. Wouldn‚Äôt worry outdoor mask use unless it‚Äôs tightly packed crowds eg protests. Virus hard spread outside  clear, guess. money come someone checks ""covid"" chart. money comes certain services provided result covid treatment. amount money provided enough incentive hospital want provide treatments purely financial point view. 30k amounts cost perhaps single day maybe two ICU, weeks required recovery, escalation required compensation. reinforce interpretation all. much liabilities having/treating covid patients hospital. said, hospital also fundamental incentive under-report covid rates unless pressured externally. Elon Musk flamethrower trick too! feel like I‚Äôm person whose actually seen lot people wearing masks. Maybe 90%, least 70 around live. 1million hospital beds entire US around 10% ICU true things gets control gonna get really ugly. Holy cow, Digg

Ron right ""Crack pit convention"" Literally, u can't make shit up. parents tested positive covid-19. father starting become anti-mask, went gym opened. dumb decision! Nah, read this? solid day. smart, sad. 

If people followed regulations wore masks, wouldn‚Äôt need situation.

Pirates Coronabean obviously understand public health emergency laws US, really law. Public health officials certainly power make mask wearing illegal public, legislatures made walking around naked illegal public, well number things (pooping street). surprise conspiracy nuts see group people programmed lower defenses pandemic. tried talk sister wearing mask. state getting blasted. barely let get one sentence out. dominated! LOL bought every FB Twiiter meme, even 5G chip thing. get word in.  Abbott: *throws match gas tank* keep talking ‚Äúmandatory‚Äù quarantines. one saw Rhode Island governor using state police national guard tracking people home. think ‚Äúurge‚Äù people quarantine. Yeah, I'm feeling beer, watching Florida, South Carolina, Arizona fully jump shark. takes wake people cult in. told that, protested California. Stop lying easily verified information racist.  listening would make masks mandatory general. Er, thank too. Still fuck police. need cop gun hand citations people violating mask orders. one needs get murdered it.

But cops guns got right apparently.  countries drop ball last outbreaks rest world quarantines us. I'm sure wonders economy. Remember folks, free Republic Canada you. 

(I'm sorry made far series yet). want believe. either guy crack.  Excuse United States focuses collective good many nations real world.

The issue ""When collective good go far infringe individual human rights?"" many people demanding wear piece additional clothing, i.e. mask.

I agree reasoning, way, good 40% populace draw line. Thank you. Christ poor women needs whole lot psychological help process daughters death deal grief.

Losing child beyond pain could ever imagine human suffer. come terms mistake made caused it? see mind would wild mental gymnastics avoid that.  think misunderstand perhaps. think bars even reopened yet. I'm still surprised. figured would take people dying streets US considered shutting anything again.  Ya like Nebraska. led bunch idiots people dont care all. Majority people arent wearing masks here. Makes ashamed again, never shouldve moved back. bet shock, poor girl! always hear polls never part one. want believe even higher this. There‚Äôs ridiculous idea wearing masks extended period time gives c02 poisoning - despite several professionals require masks hours end. AFAIK NL welfare system, survive even without customers. Shit, hate actions consequences?! Life unfair county? It‚Äôs testing. Nothing see here. /s üôÑ *Should Advocating interests one thing, advocating billions free government corporate welfare handouts another. honest person, would transparent expecting directly profit advocating global warming vaccine causes. people wonder social welfare causes worth poor rich, pay this. bit convenient someone already one richest people planet.  TBH, horrible now. Pretty sure Premier League Bundesliga similar numbers IIRC first testing runs.

If numbers keep going testing run, bad. reason long NBA enforcing mandatory isolation players. judging posts reports players workouts players teams going bars confident tbh.

The problem A) NBA enforce separation B) going Florida hotspot region staff workers Disney staying fully bubble. news, Trump still orange. Yeah thats kind I‚Äôm thinking. I‚Äôm local woods theres one around, would wear mask? totally get grocery store didn‚Äôt listen. choice running hospital beds 
I assumed since commenting staffing Florida, worked Florida. 

There‚Äôs need call name *for wishing well*. 

I **still** hope patients fare well. would reopening good pace atm

If people gathering tens thousands, endorsed governors, standing shoulder shoulder, ect.

Oh guy trying open business back up? Fuck him, call police him, fine let sit jail days. Thatll teach stuff pandemic,shoulda done activities make immune virus like protesting crowds  even know people work? Human race benevolent species, goal self preservation. well informed citizens

And also, one could argue citizens well informed, legislators elect would able put proper regulations would benefit everyone people would consistently elect good legislators. 

I would argue though main two problems standing way a) reliably efficiently educate populace? b) ensure businesses attempt (and succeed) bribing legislators pass laws benefit people?

I feel allow complete deregulation people forced work jobs bad actors justice given, leading unionizing, bringing us back problem regulate said businesses.  headline one NYC March. Harris County needs lock down. Two weeks Everything research point, started requirement. Smartphones requirement certain Asian countries became necessary wanted shop groceries. still 'voluntary' point, 'option' go shopping. concerning cases spiking rapid rate, we're compare New York state March/April, confirming 10K cases/day testing people sick. today's testing regime would probably like 30K/day (just guess). FL starts approach numbers New York size crisis better start bringing refrigerator trucks.

Anyway, spike deaths lag spike cases least couple weeks, bit early see change deaths. forewarnings come medical community, see wave anyone else. NWSL OK since they're Utah much smaller scale tournament, we'll see goes them. massively underestimate number people insist going one two bars every weekend getting absolutely plastered. 

They‚Äôre furious can‚Äôt fuel alcoholism place it‚Äôs socially acceptable so. Hey forget AMLO Hopefully Arizona follow along Texas. Ducey charge, I'm going hold breath. magically drop 2 weeks.

Nobody alive today working medicine alive Spanish Flu. living memory. ""Sense history"" nothing it. ""have sense history"" conceived creating maintaining pandemic response team.

It's funny say possible ""design"" system supply chain century events......given plenty countries seem perfectly capable responding adapting same, far fewer resources disposal US. Anecdotal I'll leave here.

I lie Cal one buddies vehemently opposed lockdown shenanigans.

He one guys that's bar life party. Pretty much Chad embodiment.

He tested positive week ago COVID. know got it, even begin guess he's many different friend groups. He's type guy would ask sip drink right bat eye.

We also play WoW together group chat joking saying least time game stuff.

Reminds school specials used come tv dumb things work (and help pass science class)... it‚Äôs Mr. Wizard COVID-19. 
Sent granny. Yeah, they're going late, that's article about. Testing, reduction social contacts, force people wear masks. masks alone reduce risk 80%, lot. 
But people stupid/proud/whatever accept piece cloth front mouth, yes. happy long still hope vaccine heard immunity.

I personally do: work from.home, avoid crowded places, wear mask shopping. stopped worrying others weeks ago. I'm sorry misunderstood dude HIV knowingly going around infecting people - go jail that? Stop testing. Thanks man! also governments, including US, working hide real numbers. 

Do references this, especially case US? amen eh Weed federally illegal yet states give big middle finger fed day long. single disney opened? 

Seaworld, universal, legoland, bush gardens open right now.  women glow men plunder? have, lancid even retract article bash HCQ. It‚Äôs HCQ given alone cocktail.

I‚Äôd rather discuss politics policies based arguments rather sentiments. that's america whole pandemic... give inch, that's much.  let people go outside, flood beaches complain masks.  open restautants 50% capacity, they're jam packed. sports start... people get infected.. shut sports. headline days come.. gonna get ugly folks Corona Tim

Corona Chris. need alliteration. Lotttttta risk people Florida unfortunately Deepl : 

In future, uniform rules apply travellers risk areas: allowed stay hotel show negative test.

The federal state governments agreed uniform rules travellers corona risk areas. future, people district high incidence infection allowed stay hotel medical certificate confirms corona infection. result decision head Federal Chancellery heads state senate chancelleries states.

&amp;#x200B;

A finding specialist medical laboratory considered medical certificate, resolution states. ""must based molecular biological test carried 48 hours arrival"". decisive factor beginning 48-hour period time test result determined.

The federal state governments want make efforts expand testing capacities necessary. monitor implementation measures next two weeks decide future course action newly emerging areas particularly affected, resolution states. states also welcomed fact Federal Ministry Health made possible Federal Government cover costs tests people so-called hotspot.

How L√§nder, issued accommodation bans people German corona risk areas, deal decision initially left open. Exceptions bans already applied current negative corona tests. Meanwhile, Bavaria already welcoming guests Warendorf district, infections decreased. several German states, even citizens go quarantine return home G√ºtersloh district. *that's* answer. businesses Texas shutting down, seem bars rafting lol probably asked patients got infected. Imo needs age term limits, I'm sorry 70+ basically scientific fact good taking new information. can‚Äôt swim mask water compromises mask‚Äôs effectiveness Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Key word: intelligence. would think teaching shelter place active shooter would way scary ‚Äúhey, wear mask, it‚Äôll help keep classmates safer‚Äù. 

Plus wear cute ones, they‚Äôll buy in. put rules it, swear words obviously...but Pok√©mon K-Pop...and it‚Äôs trend. Disney announce market closes people weekend digest minimize stock impact. Ah yeah sounds like probably doctor's office, that's bad. Maybe check doctor's office see anybody else recently contracted see you? might know anybody potentially exposed could help avoid exposures. Thanks clearing up. especially interesting invasive techniques used due lack PPE. Florida still re-elect guy well doubt. 6ft apart buses? How? They‚Äôll hire many drivers/ fleet, it‚Äôs going insanely expensive Freedom travel states federal law. wonder could get away absurdly high road toll out-of-state plates... Hmmm incredible DeSantis still dancing around bars. ""No in-person consumption"". shutting completely along everything else people keep converging on! need get point people wearing masks harassed public. Also businesses need flat removing people premises wearing mask. Missing 1 10 heck alot better missing 10 10. write material stay busy? Fuck yeah set meets practice really poor parcore too... well small meets 10? texans themselves. made beds person worship pandemic non essential, idk are.

FB live shit. Time bring back tent revivals. outdoor services adequate spacing seating mandatory masks. need indoor services summer. Well yeah 25% NYC COVID mid-late April. Everyones taking reported cases gospel even close. cat bag March going back. now, NYC magnitudes closer herd immunity rest country. Theres way lockdown would able fix situation, would delaying inevitable. two months ago... think fairing lot better NYC lot closer herd immunity current situation. rest states went lockdown vast majority pop infected, opening exposed lot uninfected people again. USC Stanford joint study estimated around timeframe NYC stories positive cases 20x-50x higher testing would indicate death hospitalization rates COVID way overestimated current data suggests. mind looks like COVID mortality morbidity rate similar pneumonia. 

The US's population definitely effect response, leadership handled horribly never chance. lot harder create adequate testing country 350M people 60M - 80M. start prep processes lot earlier, theres less room error. ability missed admin hard headed. dont get everyone opportunity people havent tested infect people. arent really comparable situations, everyone judging level stupid not.

As relates rest world, disease exists now. never exist again. whatever country get quickest fair best. never working vaccine? is, reportedly supposed last 2-3 years need re-up. Countries cant shut every time positive case comes along. cant regulate every country every person world, especially asymptomatic. Eradicating disease pipedream. need learn live get society, news scaring people without actually giving context science told us far. 

Deaths hospitalizations rising cases, disease ton less deadly official govt numbers indicate. Yes, need take precautions still, espcially elderly at-risk people, we're need realize end world. virus essentially new, contagious version pneumonia, theres fixing it. Social distancing cant last forever, even 1-2 years wont fix anything. Itll depress economy really gain. Unless whole world literally lock inside substantial amount time cheating itll never go away.  Everyoen world eventually come contact disease, countries ~10% population exposed larger risk road countries able weather storm now. X Well would somewhat safe felt safe mandated mask wearing statewide. NJ reopening lots stuff feels safe. also Governor mandated collect UE work feels unsafe PA passed resolution whistleblowers unsafe work conditions cannot fired retaliated against.

Also, Governor Murphy vocal indoor, airborne spread must controlled since evidence points source worst outbreaks.

Florida exactly NOTHING. WEAR MASK. Oddly enough, great great grandpa buried backyard. want send kids fight confederacy believe cause farm needed hands. sure South going win though, went confederate currency. ended heating house night burning worthless notes. saved enough pass youngest grandsons. dad passing $20 dollar North Carolina confederate note me. valuable, preserve history. 

Not war championed wealthiest land owners, managed hold wealth (by enslavement imprisonment) everyone else South, including soldiers dirty work, left suffer generations. LOL cmon pal , retarded enough believe this. worst day yet here. husband little local pub that's less half mile house. normal times, tend turn week burger couple drinks. know owners, employees regulars. 

We since first week March plans go anytime soon. miss environment people, worth right now. live NJ guy yelled called snowflake wearing mask. It‚Äôs Florida. They‚Äôre everywhere.

Edit: person going walk, even internet. corona, service.  defunding police lead even fewer police resources enforce mask law others? Yes, unfortunately every culture this. However, there‚Äôs shock value rest world thought evolved considered first world culture. live suburbs, surrounded ‚Äúwoke‚Äù citizens hold chicken pox parties kids vaccines evil, think ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù manipulates left Trump godsend. even professionals. can‚Äôt make stuff lying racist- post history makes clear. dont even live US- quit bullshit. fact way cases back march detected correct. way finding anywhere near 90% true positive cases today. First significant fraction cases asymptomatics - simply cant find them. secondly assumed finding 90% positive cases (over arbitrary stretch time? daily basis?), cases reduce quickly (like back Korea underwent ""exhaustive testing tracing"" cluster - arent. 

Just look Florida reported 9k cases today. Yes Disney announce you‚Äôre closing puts go I‚Äôm still gonna careful. new virus, less exposure foreign stuff probably smart. 

I‚Äôd like read this, I‚Äôve seen lot stuff indicate that‚Äôs take groceries safe, super well read particular matter. Right? literally drill kids active shooter scenarios. Wearing mask nothing compared that. That‚Äôs average. lot long-haulers struggling 90 days. One best friends got March still isn‚Äôt recovered. Also discounting surge all, small personal anecdote. Florida definitely control. don‚Äôt want asymptotic people infecting people. Sweden go herd immunity. Sweden's strategy herd immunity""

[Tegnell, State epidemiologist - put place number measures. want emphasize: goal herd immunity.""

[L√∂fv√©n, Prime Minister - I‚Äôd love see contact tracing data informed decision....somehow, doubt ‚Äúthe bars‚Äù only, even primary, problem.

Having said that, glad see Florida taking action. Wow months ago many people connected with, able spread. Since age impact mortality, get boomers shelter place allow everyone else get acquired immunity. Lock nursing homes staff living on-site. dont see benefit trying blame healthcare workers still plenty people traveling whatever wanted. purpose moving around, leave alone. Go fools demanding right go vacation, traveling multiple homes, etc.

Im healthcare worker tell first hand, many travelers going back forth nyc home state. get it, cant stop them, time, overly exposed due lack PPE many hospitals slow testing employees. would ultimately blame employer, still personal responsibility need accept cases seeded plugging along low infection rate suddenly opportunity break out, seeing 2-3 weeks places started reopening.

Most states kind open since may, again, many travelers worked went back home get haircuts waxes you. inability states uniform pandemic keeping thing spread uncontrollably. purely production standpoint. Even exterior contaminated source virus won‚Äôt live long enough packaging actually reach you.

Funny don‚Äôt mention 30 people squeezed lemon picked though, person picked fresh lettuce decided put back. lemon it, everything else touch potentially too.. sealed bag chips brought home, washed hands, opened? Yeah, chips may ok touched bag, recontaminated hands, shoveling chips mouth it. let players play video game tournament. Best 7, starting five + 6th man play quarter rotating quarter. 2 coaches commentate live stream.  Donate proceeds arena staff, etc... around league.

Literally anything infecting killing people would better. wearing masks, dangerous behaviors like ignoring social distancing. yeah, certain political side probably going significantly harder hit this. good point. correct procedure sanitize books 1 hour bleach soak UV drying.

Washington State, case folks wondering like was. Florida number one!!!! Cool idea! Imagine Redditors put heads together brainstorm box ideas? millions ideas, I'm sure we'd answer!  I'm comfortable precise. Can't depend that.

I depend that.

I make masks protect myself.

* material lab tested N95 filtration.
* design lab tested pass respirator fit test.

I've even made couple super-masks extra layer figure must N99.

Masks made 20 separate pieces. Takes 2 hours make one.

But I'm safe mask. good thing sometimes I'm person wearing one. making sure mask protects me. Ah, ok, makes sense. midnight midnight? Damn seems like corona thing joke /s cannot afford wait 2 years solving riddles Texans dying pandemic. Abbot likely voluntarily resign. Sign petition change.org demand Abbot removed office criminal negligence.

http://chng.it/4HVxLDBPSR

PS. Yes might get Patrick, would likely special election. Yes unlikely petition alone enough remove Abbot, we've seen change happening past months enough people demand change. Yes people probably think reasons work, time takes someone type reason out, could signed shared petition.

http://chng.it/4HVxLDBPSR Cloth masks worthless wearer (but still least helpful around you). Use surgical mask minimum KN95/N95 crowded areas grocery store-like conditions. Side project. day job design engineer. No, system says black lives matter, burn down. New system. Damn, America pretty much screwed, yet, people think so

**Its messed world** People also cooperate. know coworkers working contract tracing get incorrect info people people refuse divulge schedules... can't trace much surgeon general said masks effective told public that, Fauci one laid dry? curious people seem direct anger him? Swedish equivalent Axios, trusted site. mods clear this. article yesterday - grandma went party drop present. Didn‚Äôt go inside. (Someone probably brought nice slice birthday cake share - freshly coughed on). went home grandpa got sick. 24 hour webcams covid patients posted Fox News. Face ass ventilators bed sores coughing coagulated lung tissue ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù patients. Parachutes weaken body's ability handle falls! 

Seriously... saw argument made wearing masks (they weaken immune system want wear 2nd wave) peak passed lost hope ever reason people.

It's want wear masks, actively trying ""educate"" others wear either, wearing virus come back (notice need us wearing masks appear first time? whatevs)

You can't make level idiocy. Could theory, case still detections earlier waste water samples, one. bet contamination here. Oh interesting, heard they'd worked telecom companies roll caller ID folks. shame expiring though need contact tracing ever now. came steroid saves 1/3 people critical condition corona. That‚Äôll slow down. idiot turns blind eye. 

The irony. Well, mean whole ""reopen now/anti-mask"" movement astroturfed. ""grassroots"" groups popped certain states traced back single site Florida. disaster enough morons fell god damn Russian whatever propaganda. Unbelievable. know reason parents 1.2 million children send school. know reason 0.05% parents don't. 

Stop trying distort things know nothing back argument. Honestly dude, lockdowns doomed fail beginning refused get proper aid packages government. 

You laugh people want needing haircuts, end day lot people without employment without kind government aid. 

How expect people pay bills? 

How expect survive don‚Äôt money buy food families?

Yeah, people idiots want ignore problem crowd packed bars nightclubs, don‚Äôt dismiss people want provide family. ......... see posts pop front page daily. always seems like meme/shitpost factory. Guess I've missing lol

Cheers live DC Metro area.

In March, nobody wore masks traffic died quickly.

In April, traffic picked up, started seeing occasional mask. Grocery stores strict limits.

In May, I'd say 50-70% people saw store wore masks.

In early June, I'd entire grocery run see 1 2 families without masks, seemed like make statement.

The last grocery run went on, see single maskless person.

All said, waterfronts recreation areas getting busy. People still seem creating distance one another, lack socialization wearing people countries make large portion population. we‚Äôre trying correlate number cases population number, would need compare them. ""Don't live fear.""

Too late, dipshit. normal world, I'd agree you. deadly disease killing literally hundreds thousands people there's nothing normal strict measures need taken. Yes need make sure whatever rules put place pandemic remain danger passed. arguement enforcing masks Pandora's box loosing freedoms stretching it. 

This temporary measure stop spread. leaders using excuse overstep bounds vote next time. Use tools democracy enforce change instead protesting measures put place save lives. wish california would I'm thinking we'll get 50k daily go back &lt;30k again. Testing rates gone lot states experiencing spikes. know Texas, Oklahoma, Florida increased testing since mid-May. increase rate positives, increased number tests. There's large racial disparity among cases Alabama.

[African-Americans Alabama still disproportionately dying state‚Äôs 896 coronavirus deaths, 46-percent African-American. Blacks make 27-percent Alabama‚Äôs population. harm wearing mask public? even saying "" sheep wearing mask, sheep listening me"" ? I'm confused even care anymore. Karen problem? Call manager. Oof. I've meaning update css bugs. Thanks note, unaware! would work national level. testing done. live? hard assess numbers general, especially countries people go doctors unless things bad. 

I'm post soviet country living US now, parents still thankfully, ok whatever isolate... tell people know got flu like symptoms sat home instead going doctor cause want end quarantine. Bot absolutely *nothing* political post need get shit together actually stop total final spread reaching maximum possible. know moron idea ""everyone's gonna get anyway"" comes from, stupid wrong.

Every real first world country earth handling better us. Many low hundreds new cases day, lower that.  Need lock guy up. Well....I know orange guy..... üçä Lol. wonder hilarious fatty Alex jones getting Covid. Probably alien plot spread gay Marxism. fundamental problem. even pandemic healthcare treating problems fact. zero prevention. even mask requirement u mention would great! wouldnt federal government mandate emphasize freedom preserving measure could take? thats think government actually trying kill people. let get buddy. Reddit become echochamber regurgitating tripe everyone else likely get downvote oblivion. breeding ground cancel culture.

Your facts may true feelings hurt. 

REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

We post hope day people might moderate reasoned discussion instead Blaming Obama Trump everything goes on. 

Personal accountability seem exist. Unless they're trying cancel you.  say let rallies happen. Makes easier Biden win. US becoming failed state greed. Trump cause...he's symptom it.  Misleading title. 'worst pandemic day' cannot looked 7 day average CASES - testing US far better two months ago. much better metric look deaths, 7 day average deaths US lowest since March, almost 4 times lower 7 day average deaths pandemic's peak. Serious critical cases also still going down.

What data show, though, COVID-19 way back, 7 death average falling much slowly now, showing signs potential reversal coming soon following quite rapid exponential growth daily cases since mid-June. great site showing COVID-19 stats US countries. lot obscuring data, falsifying it. 

For example, Florida reporting COVID-19 hospitalizations. illegal? I'm aware of. No, excess deaths way fuck too. Tons deaths pneumonia counted covid. seen massive resurgance many states. Guess state seen one in? Colorado Baby! fairly strict social distancing, healthiest state U.S. love outdoors. idiots think government conspiring make wear mask. One idiots uncle. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* got masks kids wear go out. Since I‚Äôm single dad don‚Äôt many options whole family lives different state. oldest can‚Äôt quite watch younger ones yet stay home. try take precautions order curbside anything need bulk. control minds public keep people away you?

Stop selfish wear damn mask.

You taking risks lives health... why?

Just lazy brush teeth cannot stand smell face? 

Work hygeine dude. embarrassment. much Cali treated like joke all. one first close, mask requirements everywhere, places barely opening plans shut back recent case increases. Orange County handled like joke, CA. Ah crap. hoping vacation Michigan weeks. easily distance we‚Äôre staying grocery pickup. I‚Äôm concerned going beach. Hospitalization rate kind tricky though. lot people died nursing homes without ever hospitalized. numbers MA, 10.5% confirmed/probable cases hospitalized. 1500 deaths 80+ people 80+ hospitalized. said, think true hospitalization rate 10% still consider cases people never got tested. Remember good times. going down. know, 40 million people went outside 2 inches apart protesting. give paracetamol US they'd give acetaminophen state reopened it‚Äôs safe assume it‚Äôll look like states reopened. Agreed. least states US *able* without facing large fines, investigations possibility children removed state so. Sweden choice agonizing since penalties keeping children home harsh. Many highly educated expats already fled Sweden back home countries part school isussue (but also driven general mishandling pandemic there). 


Small linkdump expats leaving, can't recall offhand article discusses school issue: reasonable thing do, becomes even reasonable someone family risk group. Im ""concerned economy"". give 2 fucks DJIA right now. I'm concerned poor people currently bearing brunt pandemic want shit furthur. So...you believe numbers they're bad say can't trust they're positive?? understand take there? Please explain. Aren‚Äôt saying antibodies present 2-3 months? mean catch quickly no? compared ‚Äúregular‚Äù flu? I‚Äôm assuming continue mutate like viruses, too. college pushing HARD us come back campus really want to. Yeah, Fudge malicious enough. I'm deep red state currently outbreak city cancelled fireworks yesterday. Obviously still people partying feeling lots fireworks large gathering going end cancelled. really shit bed. half asses shut enough drop GDP 5%...left much shit open ""essential"" reopened everything. Saw shit coming mile away. 2nd waves comes crashing, gonna take everyone 
Supporting real? That‚Äôs strange - would suggest actual virus less severe rather treatment improving. 

Maybe people infected smaller viral load people aren‚Äôt work close proximity person caught extended periods.  sure? I've reread article says Ron Barbosa wife go party. Ron's father one hospital now. Eh, jet setters part coronavirus spread. It‚Äôs probably queasy access quality care without disruption luxuries. 

Those upper social classes *can* experience coronavirus money healthcare ones insisting risk isn‚Äôt great.

What don‚Äôt realize level care ease life exceptionally rare Americans right now. Totally! infected count reached 50,000, thought, 'someday look back reflect beginning'. Yup. Source would continually plummeting death rates, states continue open up, even case counts rising increased testing.

 really need get editor. always torn simple tips annoying classic longwinded blog posts people used to.

I end reinvesting income new data copywriting. Probably mistake business point view- engineer showing...

(Also, saw particular bad articles, let know I'll take look) took rhetorical question obvious answer insult fishing. Australia, bipartisan support right get go. Hugest difference people worry pay bills. same. people also refuse scarves warm face coverings winter? Exactly.

My mask protects you, mask protects me. mean, that‚Äôs true though. Fertility huge many many cultures around world. don‚Äôt think sadness infertility innately American. know people worse do, worse do, worse do. mean situation complete total horseshit. Fuck right whence came. disease mutating better like sars deaths way calm rioting reopen earlyü§∑üèª carelessness South beat record!!!! people reddit seem realise percentages bullshit cause polling every single American, poll like couple thousand. People call others moronic time moronic ways. special kind something, you? remember people saying fighting racism urgent corona virus. ready record increasing. one mention riots protesting... couldn‚Äôt potentially cause right? also mostly kills fat people dont wear masks. yeah, point stands. biden's fault daring run Trump first place. Trump uncontested re-election would time work this! comes fall season hence concern. You‚Äôre ok dude. common practice studies published without peer reviewed. takes special kind stupid get USA US: worst COVID day yet!

US next day: Hold Beer Could be. Could also particular test hits positive coronaviruses, issue tests theorized having. BAD data visualization. almost spat coffee saw thinking daily death rate tripled day. I‚Äôm NYC every medical center requires masks enter. case CA? heartbreaking. even leaders much new networks turning propaganda machines. Fox right Nbc CNN left. people venture side poor choice news media basic TV highly rooted one side other. Facebook reddit Instagram purposely push echo chambers population never hears anything side. everything becomes political. Can‚Äôt look like sheep Learn coding trade, Canada loves those!

Mechanics, Engineers, dudes. bizarre. essential work downtown financial district empty mind blowing. partisanship politics bad, kills common sense.

Patriotism putting aside differences common good, days dead. live NJ far see- people completely stopped wearing masks numbers went everything reopened. *ehem* 44%.. Okay. I‚Äôm wondering though someone contagious soon infected? Yes nothing new. known since beginning. always knew vast majority infected getting tested. say bill Gates injecting everyone nanobots via vaccine take minds nuts, asinine? Okay. us News 10,

So, good night, New York.

Trustworthy. Recycling.
Wear condom. agree you. People blame Trump instead personal accountability local governments lots things. Iowa leader said schools don‚Äôt need masks. Already announced it! say dumbfuckery? Cuomo is...Cuomo, good job setting tone lot protestors young. lot younger people show little symptoms. they'll pass on. It'll minute see (if any) full effects. soon. want stir specific things here, every little voice head says: time someone sane take White House. Like NOW! Go in, kick lead country one biggest cluster fuck crisis globally. 56%? It‚Äôs quite possible. posted article yesterday cross reactive cells observed mild cases, possibly might help individuals develop immunity Covid specifically. bit faster efficient due cross immunity coronaviruses. wonder asymptomatic cases sort immune response? least know asymptomatic cases developing antibodies. antibodies staying around while. 4K daily? No, how? 700-1k now. assume near peak human performance telling people shit like this?

I am, I'm telling shit like this. Stay wheel house, fitness encouraging people perfect words strong suit. SHhhhhhh child.... shhhhhh... making things worse people shhhhhh... unless real world experience weight loss coaching people IRL lose weight gonna get started internet shhhhhhh....... handful countries Europe made mask wearing mandatory.  Sympathy Florida.

‚ù§Ô∏è recently, cases stayed relatively constant couple months death rate plummeted. ""real"" numbers closer 6% overall US population per CDC. still even close would needed herd immunity. could even happen virus Fixed link, thanks heads up! Oh guys believe numbers huh? disagree money exists.

I'm saying states money Congress vacationing. prevent spread disease.

There plenty sources free masks right making one old T-shirt.

Instead excusing inexcusably selfish lazy, expecting bare minimum them.

It crazy defend people trying make pandemic worse benefit. Could yes. get tested. actually aren‚Äôt bad. April 24 415 new cases, June 21 28 new cases. They‚Äôre today around 70 doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs trending up, staying steady going back forth like 30 60 new cases. Andy Taylor need him? delighted polled covid Ireland. I'm one 40,000 TV! I'm famous. I'm probably racist eyes also. Stupid logic making racist I'm furthest thing it....... asshole logic stupid. Problem government subsidizing. taxpayer subsidizing end government's gun barrel. justifying it, may telling everyone else tested positive health privacy reasons. company testing people, test positive openly announced it. mean pretty obvious hear 2 people tested positive look around see 2/300 people work, guess legal shit behind that. probably already know waste time worrying. responsible thing best can. try relax optimistic. got this. masked it‚Äôs likely okay. Take look study hair salon infected stylists wore masks didn‚Äôt infect patrons. 

Next time outside instead. risk much lower way anxiety too. I'd love attitudes tracking data, like semi-weekly national surveys various attitudes beliefs COVID-19 prevention. could graph onto cases least convince *some* people predisposed even read charts put front them. know there's little overlap chart readers current COVID-19 apathetics they're burned out. Show apathy consequences, put historical record. take away importance crappy policy decisions, though. watched lot footage cases protesters wearing masks, cops....not much. i'll take common sense $200 Alex is. right.  badly misinformed. little sad, really. Try expanding reading include sources crazy people.   Ah, hellish intersection Sweden's failed herd immunity strategy putting severe strain healthcare climate change exceeding cooling capacity Sweden's infrastructure.

Now, like guy. let's honest shady shit used pull. anything makes even better he's turned new leaf well. think missing point. Irresponsible unsafe operations justified lack profits. Scary! doesn‚Äôt virus do! Outdoor seating July TX? Cant think many would go.

I'm trying rude condescending. really hot humid time year places outdoor seats anyways. feasible solution.  love show. I'm paying passport watch it.

Used paid one fee, got 200 channels.

Were people saying thank before? honest. going mask mandates Ohio started seeing anti mask protests. Health Director, Dr. Amy Acton, ended stepping couple weeks ago. armed protests outside house. think Ohio problems stupid people governor. Walters, 53, diabetic suffered mini-strokes

Texas fucked up. statewide now, right need six feet away people.

I'm county pretty strong mask use seen mandate made difference people wearing them. really 100% inside now, outside iffy people make point swearing away they're wearing them.

People pretty good businesses trying business outside... good terrible. heart breaks want stay business man put cables right next people pick That's dangerous thing do! could EU ignoring asymptomatic cases. Lol Texas Motor Speedway remain open NASCAR fans July 19th 50% capacity. guys think? hope seeing good signs. Texan lives right outskirts Dallas people everywhere town masks. leave house grab food/prescriptions last 2 times I've near restaurant including yesterday packed full mask sight even staff Wow holy shit. actually removed y'all's posts valid criticisms persons power. first time encountering level censorship Brilliantly stated. write greeting cards. following pandemic all? Thanks reliable link.  That's number fear number people starve death every day world could rise to, caused disruptions food chain.  ""will die"", ""might die"", ""from shutdowns"", already food insecure completely dependent food charity.  Also, global number, thread number trying diminish comparison US.

Don't get wrong - horrifying tragedy.  what's discussed thread American policy, talking American deaths. means, start thread talk global policy.

Here country, what's risk increase food insecurity (and starvation deaths), possibly going back levels 2009, peak past recession.  Food security got better every year that, latest recession top that, covid-19 effects.

So I'm going stick fact 126 thousand (and rising every day) unnecessarily dead Americans big issue, bothered nothing fearmongering. Globally disconnected moment. Bruh. look bunkers ultra wealthy started producing. New Zealand tends hot spot. 

They expect this. become proles 1984.  They‚Äôre actually highest since 17 AD One many come. don‚Äôt even know say...I‚Äôm New York things like things locked TIGHT. 
Some places still aren‚Äôt even open like gyms, theme parks, movie theaters. fact governor still places going +8,000 cases makes sick stomach don‚Äôt even live there. Stop spamming fake news. hundreds people dying virus, vs millions people dying every year causes.  Lol, leaders country listen people! What‚Äôs deaths Florida right now? Isn‚Äôt worried about? deaths hospitals counted since strain resources covid causes indirectly causes deaths people would otherwise get beds, resources medical labour isn‚Äôt sucked right long sex 1 meter away fine. Oh. wear mask. feel like article using percentage statistics make (Specifically scenario) actually. thousands protesters streets 2 weeks ago? Really? LOL

Cuz screw social distancing convenient huh bad people going injured dead grandiose display intellectual narcissism TX government perpetrated, name money. mean governments systems prevent kind thing, I'm surprised, I'm saying hospitals nationalized I'm sure would prevention ordering things Damn consensus shifted now? Tbh, majority newly built contemporary high rise architecture world, income equality inching towards par America. old people see masks? Masks would help. lot. insist staying open, mandatory masks hope. could contamination, way say definitively. mean, maybe _always_. good time late 1700s. People still think everything overreaction. 

Even governors argued backpedal. 


So, yeah, large portion US thinks go back normal ignore consequences somehow. ""Despite polling numbers,¬†only 18 states¬†require citizens wear masks public, people wearing one voluntary. It‚Äôs clear poll respondents claimed wear masks time went one point last week""

This 90% lie.

I live bay area tell still see people without masks saw interview Japanese people aside illness, ""no makeup"", ""bad mood"" list reasons wear mask. Best case scenario: Vaccine works hoped zero side effects.

Most likely scenario: Vaccine works side effects. Say, example, side effects .1% people injected vaccine (so 1 1,000). .1% United States' population (\~330 million people) 330,000 people complications vaccine itself. scale entire world. 

Second likely scenario: Vaccine work. causes people false sense confidence security follow guidelines (ex. wearing masks, social distancing). Covid cases skyrockets. 

Worst case scenario: Vaccine work all. fact, vaccine causes immune enhancement along side effects. Immune enhancement vaccinated person actually higher risk getting Covid develops severe complications compared unvaccinated person. SARS vaccine candidates back early 2000s shown cause immune enhancement. 

&amp;#x200B;

You realize Vaccine development long, long process. fastest vaccine ever developed mumps vaccine took 4 years average vaccine developed \~12-13 years.  I‚Äôm Southwest Ohio. Many seem given kind distancing masking. I‚Äôve taking kids park small walks early morning. 

A month ago - we‚Äôd typically see small immediate families together. it‚Äôs uncommon see 30+ people picnic shelters, large groups teenagers, etc. No.

I flicked NBC news live they're running ""feel-good"" stories.


On flip side.


One states Australia several outbreaks 30 new cases recorded yesterday. people started freaking f again.


Victoria re-implemented restricitions. Army called help logistics. State Premiers asking Victorians stay away. people started stockpiling toilet paper again.


Again, 40,000 new cases one day. hell people freaking hell out?! elementary school always told United States best ever. never really lived claim now, far I'm concerned. u.s. least best spreading virus! bailouts loans still transmit awful viruses like West Nile Zika... Same, Texas friend starting show signs anxiety growing around area. top potentially exposed idiotic attitude infected get tested today.

I personally COVID case office department (Georgia), sudden surge mask wearing finally, still acting like nothing wrong. father cigar party 10-15 people Tuesday, none taking precautions. south sucks, people braindead give shit others.

Time get it. want stay home scared go ahead, let everyone else live lives poll Americans 100 times, find results agree opinions phrase things support agenda. one thing, statement false mayo time. So, yeah, statement false. Genuine question: Elon Musk racist?

I know Henry Ford racist, *was* avowed anti-Semite.  would ever thought back April cases surging good lockdown would headline June virus constantly mutating. chart known variants: 

Keep mind many extremely minor variations. Copying DNA/RNA ""error""-prone process, genes get flipped, added, deleted time. fundamentally evolution works. general, virus mutates, notable effect (it's like Outbreak suddenly goes airborne).

One thing point is, aggregate, virus incented mutate towards *less* deadly. evolutionary goal replicate much possible. can't hosts dying time. Ergo, tend favor state kill anyone, still makes spread disease. 

While I'm anthropomorphizing virus here, keep mind actions done aggregate system viruses there. Much like yell fire crowded theatre, general trend crowd head towards exits; person trying get crowd whole theatre, themselves. Said rallies protests almost entirely outdoors masked. Per capita daily number cases real first world countries 10x-100x lower.

I'm working professional adult, manchild can't read refuses understand real world. said reason performing unionised reality non-unionised people much due fear job safety.

They sometimes overstep bounds want strikes trivial reasons sometimes things generally voted upon members, unions never got pursue trivial things experience.

The last one said pay increase less amount money we'd lose striking. Literally pointless may well save proper negotiation bits.  

Union subs optional. even tell employer one can't treat differently opting out. too. frustrating. still phase one think end staying here.  masks still help. maybe much we'd like definetly do. dont think bring extra careful isnt Bad thing dealing deadly virus. yeah point correct overcrowding. Dr. Fauci below, means it‚Äôs still early tell.

In interview JAMA early June, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, said takes minimum three weeks behavioral change ‚Äî shifting away social distancing large mass gatherings ‚Äî cause increase infection rates. yeah. lack lock down. enforcement. live??? haven‚Äôt experienced all, I‚Äôm Philadelphia family throughout PA, one cares all. guess Philly never rules original outbreak mostly Stockholm region. 

Just like US originally mainly new York outbreak center. 

Once New York stabilised, numbers started looking good US.

Now rest rest American states outbreaks, numbers rising.

Same situation Sweden regards anticipated rising numbers. 

The outbreaks Sweden slowly spreading. 

Herd immunity Sweden taking long time, get there. disagree you. data merely observational explore mechanisms said differences. could practice differences due true biological difference. can't tell based data. know pregnant women likely end hospital, ICU vent.

People seem like got tired behaving safe decided give go back ""normal"" lives before.  think good state **force** parents risk groups send children school risk fined, investigated possibly children taken them?

This phrase means whatever article author wants mean given moment.

If *ever* find majority, time re-think position.  Masses majorities idiotic prone stupid actions stupid motivations, mostly brought fear.  chance phased re-openeing. think protests stomped ability get data. Normally I'd think data scientists could extrude cases caused re-opening cases driven protests faith competent, non-partisan information completely dashed. million people losing jobs, every week 3 months. stuff re-open economy country left. circular logic. Seeing favorite politician without mask tacit approval wear one. Politician's fans get loud rowdy wearing masks, turn tells politician he's right track, goads keeps going there.

The real crux issue politics turned team sport. fully expect see election results viewing parties people wearing beer hats waving giant foam fingers. mean, machine translated. first time Swedish/Danish articles posted misinterpreted due translation taking consideration S. Korea one lowest instances comorbidities world. United states ranked 11th obesity 2016, RoK (Republic Korea) ranked 183rd. inconceivable United States would hit harder due preexisting conditions (including poverty lack access quality healthcare). said, would fairer put United States around 3-4% fatality. take account otherwise preventable deaths would occur due overwhelmed healthcare system.

Having said that, believe Covid-19 killing anywhere near 2-6%. number asymptomatic cases high, body count, horrific largely preventable, low. Source asymptomatic cases includes several sources its' get wrong, thing bad, death toll much higher needed due gross incompetence, believe 4-8 million die it. end reaching worst-case, herd immunity scenario, believe number would closer 1-2 million dead. 1-2 million dead, safe assume least 1/3 preexisting life-threatening condition. fighting games Yeah right idk thinking wrote must misinterpreted Wishes?!?!? need antibody positive work safe(r) environment. even half doctors anti bodies, enough cut transmission cycle considerably (it would mostly patient doctor, instead patient doctor, doctor, say, far infectious)... wonder hospitals test every death COVID. cheap quick now, would provide much accurate numbers tried explaining mom impossible social distance college. Even could fix classroom aspect, social aspect would fail. College kids going party tight quarters every weekend weekdays too. FOMO strong. People going isolate weeks time. like haircut? college campuses aren‚Äôt open students, can‚Äôt open allow players campus facilities. don‚Äôt see college sports happening fall unless things drastically change. guys basically 0 cases though Imagine using New York support argument anything COVID related bright side, look shitty WW2 last months. bad things now, imagine good news over? Literally allergies food poisoning, could covid now. Greaaat Yeah, agreed! emphasized possibility telelearning. Denmark successful distance learning programs spring. There's reason can't implemented developed countries. 

Do think might happen Canada? Sorry stuck environment right now! Umm, actually respond another comment?

You said hospitalizations up. responded telling state publish numbers, individual counties do, up. doing?  False positive  look Sweden, didn‚Äôt lock - death rate 5x neighboring Denmark. rate immunity really higher - economy faring badly.

I don‚Äôt want see 5x many deaths necessary US. exactly kid learning kindergarten elementary school can't teach given lesson plan materials? [Actually, researchers observed haven‚Äôt spikes surrounding protests. comes across disingenuous way criticize protests ignoring fact many people simply ignoring pandemic going daily life normally, without PPE. least political leaders US willing admit they're always right, even took longer have. Obviously we're lot wrong

Yeah, people refusing use common sense. want claim worldwide hoax. M'kay there, buddy, keep believing that. 

On top that, whole reopening thing? Yeah, cases went lockdown. Nothing could possibly go wrong, right? Racism? less risky going supermarket, honestly. lot stuff buy market handled refrigerated immediately surface contamination could missed. Nothing might check library perishable.  sit car garage spare room away day two totally fine handle.  Keep hand sanitizer car pack, sanitize leaving. Obviously use water fountain. 

I'm worried library employees patrons handle things people return check day long. multiply 4? I'm near Danbury.

That‚Äôs within range estimated mid February, number coming many serological studies. Nothing new surprising here. IFR still capable killing well million Americans. 

This much closer ‚Äúno news‚Äù ‚Äúgood news‚Äù. Pretty much nobody does, nobody doubts happened haha interesting analogy. Theres problem world people judge others color skin... name parents gave birth apparently  really alarming. People think coronavirus serious, behavior unintended consequence making coronavirus impactful daily lives. 

I see way anymore. divide way strong there's many uneducated pridefully arrogant, selfish people. bartend last night first night back. assure people Long Island give shit masks social distancing. *Fox News entered chat* People stopped social distancing large number people refuse wear masks ‚ÄúGreatest country earth‚Äù smdh try denying someone service they're wheelchair. go well you. 

that's stupid theory here, people disability prevents wearing mask, like person wheelchair disability prevents using stairs. 

but disability (stupidity) protected ADA. go California something? live Us visibly homeless people anywhere all. homeless typically live shelters, get housing assistance, bouncing around friends family. 

The places I‚Äôve seen like California refuse solve problem weather allows people live outside. Besides release stress telling people f@*k without knowing so.

I'm glad I'm one this. Still waiting explanation spikes happening places opened early everywhere March. First off, one confirmed it. Second, people talked press last month absolutely lied press plant reopened.

You look older article. company earth would kept people lied press. $600 extra per week US end end July Right prefer raise kids starving broken nissan sentra. Fuck right off. Apparently, government department trust ""Freedom Breathe Agency"" ... Seriously, read card laugh. start enough concerned Texan glad see step.

Greg ""Shit tier governor"" Abbott completely pacified local municipalities ability institute sort proactive measures, nullified power punish abiding guidelines going see change behavior attitudes lot Texans. reason cases deaths comes lack availability people actually get house.

And bad, youngest bro celebrated 21st immediate family, decided wants head back campus junior year college - they'll go non stop whole semester asking students come leave campus all. 

At least freedom choose go home right help make shelter family time crisis. COVID closes doors, still plenty windows. Life one cares reason

It‚Äôs you‚Äôre surrounded stupid people. Hope helps. Someone India knows ground reality country. Would ""not really good news"" Sweden becomes Corona-free August ""this happened earlier""? course not, still legitimately good news, regardless much one wants argue timing underlying facts matter. flagging Good News show one's bias wanting admit is. New poll? I've hearing seeing yet seems everyone keeps going 2020 wild agree add strategic part, re-openig require masks eye protection (goggles, etc) since covid-19 affect mucaous membranes? do. several mechanisms place fuck things up.

1. Winner take (mostly problem presidential elections): 51% state votes someone, candidate awarded 100% votes. Possible solutions: Proportional allocation electoral votes (implemented Maine Nebraska), direct popular vote (one vote counts regardless cast). 

2. First Past Post voting: candidate receives votes wins, result victor less half voters supports. Possible solutions: Ranked Choice Voting (voters rank candidates preferred least preferred victor os decided runoffs), Score voting (each voter ranks candidates giving score). methods would empower third parties. 

3. Gerrymandering. Every 10 years, congressional district maps redrawn, party power often gives unfair advantage packing several opposing districts acquiring safe majority remaining districts, giving congressional seats.

4. Money politics. 

5. Various voter suppression tactics, poor access absentee ballots, registration deadlines expire well election, voter roll purges inadequate resources polling locations. 

It's definitely possible fix things, hard could fix directly benifiting system comfortable it. Good point! need law degree! go Starbucks after. Well could seen one coming lmfao. one reasons defund police movement strong. enforce laws agree with, traitor. enforce laws unequally pre-qualifying condition race, gender, sexual orientation, age, hair color anything else issue with, traitor.

Even ‚ÄúMale-Karens‚Äù. stupid opinion. Almost like judging someone color skin..... proven point lol. 

I expect people put masks social distance, can't even Yeah found odd situation, happened. know 10 people two deaths, one close. TMC isn‚Äôt place hospitals Houston Houston metro area. 

MH alone Northwest, Southwest, Southeast, Memorial city. Methodist St Luke‚Äôs basically hospitals locations.  There‚Äôs also smaller hospital networks area. that‚Äôs Houston proper.  MH, Methodist, St Luke‚Äôs also hospitals outside metro area katy, sprung/cypress, Pasadena, sugarland, woodlands, humble, kings wood, part 7 million metro area.

The issue isn‚Äôt icu beds. It‚Äôs there‚Äôs way many covid cases Texas due poor decisions like full reopening.

The issue texas rural areas head city care. hospitals Houston also serve lot people 4 hours away outside cities jack shit highway main road. Literally, highway becomes Main Street speed limit drops 25mph. Never said that. Neither they.
It's valid point think dumb going selfish etc (I'm locked away indoors instacart everything). 
 I'm stating fact mortality rate group girls based comment another made they'd die. 

Statistically that's wrong comment. 

But course saying everyone gets dies what's hot here. avoid wearing face masks, grace? Disneyworld: Full steam ahead! No. Majority.

People, fullest extents ""most part"", fucking stupid. Period. Full stop.

From backwoods hick without 8th grade education highly educated people know, bred logic, accountability, reason society. 

We Idiocracy come life. Someone start petition people committing sit July 4th weekend out. clue thin hospital staffing already, rate get sick even ppe?

How many people get sick restaurant can't keep open? people stop going work bc want risk it?

Very naive That's good bet lose! impressive. Thanks posting. He's probably gonna fine. elderly pay price frivolities. I've never polled.  OK Karen. Totally agree one. also tiny, 200k. would really think someone travelling, either stay region go somewhere bit exotic Denmark. problem seem dire expect comeback from? Can't. chose Blue Window instead Red Hat mistake. one reasons ""locked down"" (as crappily part US). build testing capacity, hospital capacity PPE, buy time research better treatments protocols.

It extremely sad think sizable percentage passed March/April might saved days given fact knowledge expanded. also sad think passing away might yet able saved August know even more. 

But good news *do* know more. treat, statistically risk, symptoms aware norm respiratory viruses. Yeah they're important dominate entire discourse like America. make masks mandatory means less healthcare professionals really need them. There's important balance much mandatory restrictions advice too. want push mandatory restrictions things limited science back effect. also city Scandinavia 1 million population

Generally, Copenhagen considered densely populated urban area Scandinavia

Copenhagen proper contains million inhabitants areawise much smaller Stockholm. video games y‚Äôall self-medicating weekend? I‚Äôm gonna vacuuming shit ghosts Luigi‚Äôs Mansion 3. It‚Äôs perfectly orchestrated attack freedoms. Baaaa I‚Äôve never done personally sneeze then? Sneeze mask blow face nukes. Maybe sneeze elbow guess? He's *still* enforcing mask wearing statewide limiting cities enforcing certain mask wearing rules themselves, right? 

He's forced painful thing refuses logical, important, less painful thing first, ever. Personally can't give credit backing corner. correct im wrong, little one-way port kind defeat whole point mask (in regard covid-19)? Starting days ago citys AZ mandatory masks now. nobody wearing them. far haven‚Äôt seen anybody inside business one. people responsible reopening care healths lives, care income. die, sure buy something make profit. Damn, lost bet. sure jack shit answer answer reasonable person ""no, reasonable state **force** parents send children school risk fines, investigations children removed. 

It's remarkable much hate state impositions save lives (aka lockdowns) seemingly endorse put lives jeopardy (forcing parents send children school countries large outbreak going on). Especially, South Asia

As far know brunt new cases nations seeing hospitalizations per capita Americas.  school drafted calendar campus effectively closing Thanksgiving. I'm pretty sure going online start semester. Yikes. Per article: AUSTIN ‚Äî Texas Gov. Greg Abbott Friday took countermeasures stem tide coronavirus infections, closed bars, ordered restaurants return 50% capacity, shut river-rafting outfits gave local officials control large gatherings ahead Fourth July holiday.

Abbott called moves ‚Äútargeted, measured directives,‚Äù stressed state must move forcefully get current spread COVID-19 control. Wow, amazing comeback One side understand economics, business social behavior clearly they're recommending stay locked something that's never going away. European models show differently. 

We spend money bailing corporations, yet argue poor people getting aid. 

Americans don‚Äôt think worthy healthcare. 

We spend money excess many ways. We‚Äôve printed money pandemic. 
We let corporations become voices politics.
But ability people fear doctor‚Äôs visit due money unacceptable/unfeasible. 

If people understood healthcare shouldn‚Äôt privilege first world country, budget happen. think people living Gotland would go Norway summer, really clueless Nordics. I‚Äôll honest hard stay inside another night see everyone around living normal life. 

I aware cases going places didn‚Äôt hear much anything around area.

Life one cares reason Like improbable beliefs, really bad case trying face hard life die. Thanks protesters CT chose option would result deaths Ugh. Yea rather cringe. clearly someone trying promote amateur blog too.

From side bar subreddit.....

Here allow following types posts: reputable news sources (this includes, limited to, BBC, BNO, Guardian, Washington Post, Reuters, Al Jazeera, South China Morning Post, New York Times, Caixin, CDC, etc.), discussion regarding economic impact, societal impact, travel bans, etc. people 3 months ago ‚Äúcheering Sweden‚Äù governors supporters linked fucking article discussing, titled something like ‚Äúgovernors backpeddle COVID starts fucking killing everyone taking lockdowns seriously‚Äù.

If seem think libs saying lockdowns, three liberal states lock down? odds dying 17 covid basically 0 I'm looking leaving I'm Oregon. true one week early May. Now, maybe 50% varies going. Grocery store pretty good, convenience store good, bars masks except employees may even wearing right. exception harder hit Miami Fort Lauderdale I've seen people largely using masks businesses like grocery stores, though they're still stupid bars. Let get back then. Yes land Haggis! Look Happy Valley Dream Survey. Basically it‚Äôs during/before tragic events people intense dreams. ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù found everyones dreams September 5th 2020 kept popping up. small town conducting research story behind bizarre. Nobody really knows actually might next big date lol going argue forever forever forever, least try right next time. don‚Äôt believe so. people don‚Äôt want lose ones IMF said Vietnam highest economic growth Asia 2.7%. Granted thats less half usually have, proves economic sacrifice enourmous take things seriouslly start. using common sense self? somebody getting ready sneeze face would want mask around face? okay breathing everybody's droplets there's virus spreading??? really can't believe 0.26% cfr. Iceland's comprehensive testing showed 0.53% I've read number reports r/covid19 suggesting rate. jinx man. bunch news outlets streaming YouTube. both. Arizona opened way way quickly way many people thinking isn‚Äôt real. Final-freaking-ly. way thought understood it, around 10% population could possibly die result COVID, going 1% provide oxygen ventilators.

But then, around 50% could show symptoms... Unlucky. IFR .5%, really got unlucky there.  completely incorrect still incorrect. Gotta watch something quarantine! going wait older coaches staff people health issues already catch virus die, great.

Well warning MLB NFL guess. COVID racist?  Ok! Sorry inconvenience. Anywhere else world mandatory mask meant anywhere outside home. 127,000 US citizens died alone, scared, unable say goodbye friends families ""leaders"" incompetence. NEVER FORGET, NEVER FORGIVE. people crowd indoors AC gets hot muggy. It‚Äôs going mid-90‚Äôs today Tampa, yet infection rate‚Äôs slowing. course spearheaded ignorant Karen runs FB group bills ""Transformation &amp; Leadership Coach"" peddling asinine books writes zero education medicine 186 UK deaths (Great Britain Northern Ireland) parents making upset dad‚Äôs reluctant wearing mask mom keeps small social gatherings people wednesdays, justifying statement don‚Äôt interact outside circle

I little doubt there‚Äôs going world over. lots doubt there‚Äôs going America over, though. isn‚Äôt really listening boxed isn‚Äôt regular nonsense anymore. Gloves aren‚Äòt needed wash hands propperly, you‚Äòll fine. know ventilators aren‚Äôt ‚Äúset forget it‚Äù right?

It‚Äôs crock pot. St. Joe - small hospital ICU. Bay can't take us guys too. :( Leon swamped. crazy also busiest since Michael too. get wanting go vacation anywhere pandemic. HIPAA I‚Äôve seen, things open cases low people automatically relax let guard down(at least area) let guard stop wearing masks etc. spread start albeit slowly faster. start closing things again. think happen there‚Äôs vaccine better treatment Reopen? never closed. friends family still working many places remained open, including workplace (fried chicken joint; Americans care filling guts end day), almost unnecessary. country showed much valued workers. Pay attention, everyone. 5004 good number compared today :( No, state mandate.

Texas going need marshall medical resources right fight this. Even worse, spread Texas lot even New York, likely major cities Texas get hit New York City could siphon resources upstate. people? People taking thing seriously... part... (because there's always people wont obey)... inconsistent rules like ""wear mask"" ""don't ask questions gloves"" ""everyone stay home"" ""except... except... except.. "" ...etc. 

Either suit lock everything down... we're really taking seriously. Enough half-measures, I'm saying. Yeah it‚Äôs much better give money big corporations ZERO oversight disappear. It‚Äôs free lunch.... unless you‚Äôre filthy rich. find broken ~a~ definition less. always mean subtraction. 

of course not, replying ""Less mean minus stated. Go check dictionary believe me.""

so established indeed ""less"" mean ""minus"" according dictionary, definition ""less"" mean divide by. Disney already postponing reopening parks California. Florida probably follow next week want pile bad news.  know, much agree say essence, wasnt reasons. Thousands small business owners, workers, etc. crippled lockdown much agree lockdown, legitimate concern there. like saying BLM protests consisted rioters looters. fucking shit. matter people try reserve vacation there/in Orlando that's going end canceled. Plus, reason cases ARDS, early aggressive intubation works great. one shits grins. took time realize COVID-based ARDS responded differently. ‚ÄúSo far‚Äù meant like ‚Äúthe virus ain‚Äôt gone, real solution it, stats temporary‚Äù

Meaning one knows stats like 2 years, might also look combined deaths countries, sure hiding numbers sickness like pneumonia, came Covid, death registered pneumonia...

So let‚Äôs see couple years. added bunch ‚Äúprobable‚Äù deaths. Learned lesson yet Texas?   mean, people waiting see Mickey mouse going pandemic, gauge respond. Literally. 

Who gives fuck Disney first all, CDC (how useless th CDC been, joke).. 

Why quarantine right now? What. The. Fuck. half state drops dead hold news conference discuss maybe closing stuff? fucking joke? Experiment? 

EVERYONE thinks big deal I'm one people circle ""hey maybe skip restaurant/mall/going non stop thing bit"". Everyone else says:

""It's new normal""
""We can't stop living life""
""Were going get mine well get build immunities"" understand that's works right?  I'm sure GP long time definitely time reconsider can't follow simple instructions keep patients healthy. 

I definitely going doctor's office anytime soon. taaaall spike. like one chapter Stephen King book. How's gonna play Cuban community You‚Äôre arguing 8 day old covid denier account. know three people it.

Two died. really. Cause know, underpaid lower class slaved money something happens pandemic... Yup. real shitty. owner place work put bunch false shit social media much ensure safety. one cleans anything kitchen closing time, one wears gloves, one sanatizes. dont even sani buckets! take temps people coming work like twice week. according facebook straight concerned n going way maintain clean kitchen try 1000s people allowed go large gathering yet people know pick choose gets see dead mom. don‚Äôt think strange. England old mother law mocked today wearing mask.... Yes evil doctors killed everyone, covid, flu /s mean sprained ankle haha would go hospital? Even tore ligaments there's point lot MFers need stop lying. Maybe safety nets higher incomes. koolaid drinking. know far important consequence mistakes, fuck Florida actually making upset MLS NBA returning. wait weeks reopen, keep bars closed, actively campaign masks, even that. Wait BoJo opens restaurants pubs again. Europe still lockdown. delaying inevitable. NE US. People realize reopening causing spread, fucking paper masks. California compliance masks LA surge quite high. Contact tracing works it‚Äôs done electronically Asia, fly Us. Phone contact tracing useless. bunch Tommys cases sniffles. Nothing worry about! Eh, honest you, probably still not. a-hole think highly Stone Mountain.

Laser light shows traitors really bag. thread NBA. expect baseball cancelled well. Exactly this, one things makes public health policy difficult.

Every action multi-week lag time, cuts ways.

Reopen economy, things look fine couple weeks, everyone thinks safe / overblown. lag time ends start see increases, people look around wonder, ""What's changed, we've open weeks now, must something else""

Lockdown, things keep getting worse weeks economy suffers. People wonder point destroying economy numbers still climbing. Wait weeks though numbers start coming down.

The pandemic like cruise ship, turn dime, something wait while, understand impact. Humans, sadly, evolved though cause-and-effect much compressed timeline. brains pattern matching wonders, type action distance really throws loop.

That's imperative right people resist urge ""go gut"" instead actually follow science modeling. difficult thing 99% time, gut going ""right enough"" one times.

Stay Safe there. one nutjobs. felt need send put rest. Goodnight. Next gonna tell finna thing. 

Language evolves everyone crusty WASP. Look used two non word words. Deal it. future ancestors speaking type Creole May say something like encourage usage. 
- It‚Äôs like condom face. Please wear it. course hopefully avoid number deaths saw March, already hospitals Sintra Setubal (suburbs/satellite cities Lisbon) approaching exceeded capacity, patients needing transferred hospitals. looks like small increase charts, concentrated. Lemmings follow bad advice. Smart people don't. We've never seen clearer example one group public officials giving bad advice lemming followers, terrible. Vote, people will. Yeah, stupid shit like happens hood. shouldn‚Äôt news folks around here. Sheltered little creatures

If type shit surprise live sheltered life. Yes already known coronaviruses pretty stable terms mutation

And really case, ""just mutated later on"", come March 2019 sample match SARS-CoV-2 sequence today? going imply someone identified small part virus' genome overwhelmingly responsible virulence we're witnessing right now?

Oh boy, bullshit Montgomery county? stop listening uniformed masses 

Moderna Oxford already producing vaccines oxfard alone could 400 million ready go years end. 

Seriously lot people sub shockingly ill informed matter fact obvious pretty telling Yah never really closed begin protests definitely played massive role too. Mine little metal pin nose section bent around nose prevent this, happens anyways. tight around nose, still happens. Probably also starting see hospitals ran over, like saw New York. *shuck Might well go herd immunity point never thought mother stupid before, last years especially last 6 months... can‚Äôt deny anymore. 

My mother stupid hateful person.

Edit OH also time says gets coronavirus blaming protestors. Soooo... it‚Äôs simultaneously real also deadly virus spread ‚Äún*ggers‚Äù. Mommas get cut sister, family left.  No, many knew happen. little, late. Slightly bigger population US, death count clearly dropping. full course students dedicated learning exponential growth finally control virus. mean sr svt agenda show things bit rosy? Hospital systems devastated hospitalizations inevitably follow surge cases happen right several states. 

1 15 less before, still LOT. restaurants still sell alcohol? Genuinely curious, infuriating depressing plot make sense story infuriating depressing? 
Because part reason liked original one felt many conflicting emotions including anger sadness. also obesity nursing homes. village CNN reporter visited, 4/700 died. number may still go up. good comebacks ""don't sheep"" slogan? happened testing contact tracing selectively quarantining people test positive? nation effectively wasted lockdown building infrastructure required deal pandemic. higher long term medical conditions might end needing hospitalization initially. Truth. Yes ID2020 real charity multiple initiatives, read real facts it. Microsoft involved it, gates foundation donate it. nefarious people afraid social security numbers, drivers licenses, finger prints. digital age many things explored internet security. group also researches retinal, bio metrics, many others race giant petri dish God serious problem us, then, that's voted Remove smoke detectors immediately! Miami, that's part fine put place. Listening WH task force... anyone said word ""masks"" once?

EDIT: Dude said wear face coverings. Finally. Well comment aged well. 

Five hours later Florida reports 9000 cases 13%. shit making way hospital system north Texas. Fucking idiots trying anything wear mask. promptly tell it‚Äôs fake. California here, went Lowe‚Äôs 7am avoid crowds everyone wearing mask one young smug dude. None employees said shit him, mentioned cashier (albeit young man, probably didn‚Äôt want guff) kind shrugged off). 

It upset see someone smugly walk around. older acquaintance mask, don‚Äôt know didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs said lot election years. Don‚Äôt trust polls. think statement goes double here.  Holy shit. That‚Äôs almost quarter total cases state single day Sounds like someone caught case karma. Like matters many people willfully disregard experts. Sometimes experts agree other! y'all, *readier.* 50 less 10 40. 50 minus 10 40.

This problem. reasonable people NE. I'm AZ, one new epicenters, mask compliance - even mask mandate - unreasonably low. I'm former Hoosier. Please read outbreak first detected start 2015, immediate calls public health experts Pence lift ban syringe exchanges stop spread disease, held off, remaining morally opposed needle exchanges despite wealth evidence practices encourage drug use, successfully curb spread instead told people going pray do. time finally signed executive order March allowing needle exchange Scott county, Austin located, weeks passed dozens cases confirmed.

Eventually going watch spend rest life hating so. Orange County also one largest jumps recent weeks, along San Bernardino. Although would reserved making conclusions red blue. show map Cali color coded cases time, looks like virus spreading across California previously localized largest cities like LA.

People need stop politicizing virus. look hard see correlation states reopening COVID rates. wouldn‚Äôt try venture guesses specific reason spike recent weeks I‚Äôve looking lot data. u think bc half nation taking half got hit earlier ready reopen? Like NYC restricting states. here, we, go. Per Pence's briefing, new cases 50% age 35? right? hate say it, chance protest related. 3 weeks, that's long Reddit says takes cases start flowing in. Wipe enough elderly death rate goes fair political system setup allow quick, reactionary, sweeping change. kind feature built 3 branches government.

Those us live parliamentary democracy look US marvel much gridlock is, kind different setup. like parliamentary democracy party power mandate govern pass legislation parliament regular basis.

Kind moot point days though US system checks balances subverted. executive branch nominates judges judicial branch leads latter becoming heavily politicized. misleading. Yesterday one lowest death counts too, 7-day deaths clearly way down. Also CFR plummeting.  


With openings come spikes. surprise make headlines. see covid 19 least worries. government literally shooting them, beating them, tasing arresting protesting taking videos violent. People asthma wear them
COVID would wreck instantly. town ordered masks public people losing shit yes I‚Äôm seeing people saying lie health condition exempted. need both. lockdown, use testing tracing identify contain hotspots, gradually lift lockdown. Order online. Make larger / fewer trips store. like wear mask day situations. Here's insane business website Completely nonessential 

Ridiculous wrong also one changed tune non-stop downplaying pandemic so...sure let's pretend ""both sides"" issue. I'm confused, elaborate? always wonder polls come from. I've never participated one.... Utah also experiencing first surge. fucked up....a window putrid soul. California: we‚Äôre going next coronavirus hotspot

Florida: hold alligator Ironically, people believe Evolution, living proof natural selection. Stupid stupid does. Well largest population county fine business county Harris wish stores live that. still hard find toilet paper paper towels.

Free market gives control freedom consumer variation, take advantage power. see saying though, would also argue maturation process going on. look back history human race people worked dusk till dawn, children expected work fields/sew clothing/gather food help feed families certainly work great conditions. mean today's standards acceptable largely, market, people know supposed like it, course, someone decided could elected political position/get rich telling people deserve it. (which fine, let's real, reason unions came people wanted profit way company owners profiting abused workers)

If really think it, 1800s single society world ""8 hour"" work day unless simply way see working on. I. don‚Äôt know say people. I‚Äôm dumbfounded sane Florida resident, apologize state. enough learn mistakes repeat mean, half joking extremely agitated, many neurological problems ‚Äì mainly confusion delirium,‚Äù says. ‚ÄúWe used patients ICU agitated require sedation, completely abnormal. scary, especially many people treated young ‚Äì many 30s 40s, even 18-year-old.‚Äù

(also, thanks link!) Trump know way make everything return normal hence .... chances (redacting anything political) **sign strict national mandate everyone must wear face mask/covering covering nose mouth whenever public**, consequences fine mandatory confinement non-compliance? Thanks homie cop came prior ever situation use discretion announced going arrest anyone ever marijuana possession, would objection.

Any time law enforcement officer takes position going enforce laws dislike, problem that. there's truly problem law work community get reformed, that's America works.

Since wanna play stupid fucking games, cop used discretion say going charge minorities committing crimes white people, would upset that? Murder? Rape? Robery? Assault? Let's say beat cop say ... fucking Sheriff. needs lose badge immediately insubordination.

Or Cops using discretion something agree with? seem confused, topic ""does crime fit legal distinction terrorism?"" proven does. right make authoritarian, makes informed. actually mutated worst Europe terms easily spreads, Italy NYC got got

I'm going ask source this, that's hot button topic, information like looking support claim mutated better. Brutal. 8 months come from? year 2122 going suck. fueling facebook grandparents around country say ""they wear masks! we?!""

I know that's infuriates me! Pence **R E F U E D** say ""wear masks"" seems like instructed everyone else steer clear words well. They're doubling-down terrible bet people dying. won't. Coronapalooza indication, they're going pretend affiliation save virus. like Jesus saved pastors.... oh wait. Good point. OrangatAnus doesn‚Äôt two syllables. Getting approved distributed.

Phase 3 usually takes 8 months, lot timeframe stuff (other podcasts like ‚Äúthis podcast kill you‚Äù also talk it), usual timeframes experts use aren‚Äôt likely followed here.

I love vaccine community rigid strict protocols, fuck idea move fast normal timeframes aren‚Äôt going really work Proportionately yes, death count. That's going trend average age county. positive case per county, much effect that's hospital system, likely get infected leave home, none 'deaths per county' Well predictable cyclic variations sure. probably best compare last Friday's number (about 3300). Roughly, they're back doubling time 5 days, like good old days people shut away April. 

It seem Florida exceeded testing capacity ""gone linear"" yet; not, soon. Next week's tests may well show linear, exponential, growth, testing capacity exceeded, contagion estimated positivity rate.

I also notice dashboard's last ""percent positive"" calculation comes 11 days ago. good look, FL. Lmao ok man. people going getting tested. Also counting positive tests? wife tested positive 9 times. count towards daily results? knows.  Absolutely horrible leadership. sad article clearer titling, dollars doctors' compensation, actually cut right now--many health systems cut salaries doctors sure reduced numbers procedures, doctors private practice simply getting much income patients making visits. article talks about--the money exchanged--is compensation offered government/medicare *hospitals* treating covid patients, tiny fraction typical cost treating patients. rest cost either paid private insurance simply absorbed hospital/healthcare system.  Hey, I'm trying optimistic, delusional. basically saying there's way hell could correct, there's 100% chance deaths increase commensurate level cases now. Again, right, I'll eat crow, think there's chance infecting many young, asymptomatic people compared March April, maybe IFR lower thought. emerging evidence spreads primarily super spreader events/people meaning people get infected pass anyone pass few. could isolated little clusters infection die own. think France confirmed cases going back November never amounted anything.

I know that's likeliest explanation occurred simple mistake sample/test likely. case percentage possitve cases would going down. actually going up. get that. really wish world fucked is.

However, missed point. supporting us need rush consumers. that's fact. get people choice. 

The harsh reality accept lots us do. can't make us choose. 

We, however, make adapt need adapt survive. sincerely hope adaptations profound meaningful loss minimized (America really blowing many people rushing fray really needed meaningful leadership) 

I think people embraced challenge rather trying ignore hope best would see meaningful change. that's proving difficult. isn‚Äôt important all. literally closed middle people already there. that, pull plug even day two reopening would happened. headline makes sense. way supposed read March 2019, March 2020 full fledged crisis. reason median age dropped significantly

This ain't boomers fault. Everyone makes fun karens damn younger people flooding bars dickheads live MD would like well say, next time one big brains needs surgery, we'll sure tell surgeon wear mask working open wounds. Fuck washing hands well. Soap devil's rendered body fat. governor never issued stay home orders. done mayors and/or county judges. know people like this. Nothing convince impacted personally. Goalposts forever moved regardless provide them. 

Your hope change minds family member diagnosed. continue deny point, means next step get diagnosed players live Florida begin with. biggest risk bubble playing games potentially infected players. risk getting infected employees home. addition, bubble daily testing players, access home I'm quite sure arguing - b/c I've already said I'm masks. great London study others suggest significant reduction case growth mask usage higher 50 percent. 

But that's point. said we'd *lucky* get 50 percent participation. point - one keep missing - states big problems masking alone enough *at point* - former head FDA agrees: happen live Alabama. huge number cases last two days Jefferson County (Birmingham).  One interesting case study might small rural county like Marshall Alabama. BLM protest 3 weeks ago counties city (Guntersville). far tell much else going there, astounding number cases last 4 days, basically like 230 new cases 4 days since pandemic began usually bounced around 10-20 cases.  
I'm sure might lots possible causes, personally I'm going throw protests one them. 99% sure reason Trump wear mask rub bronzer makeup. Sooo... else lives neighborhoods US people nearby multiple parties like virus exist? Looks like 9k today Coronavirus: *puts truck reverse*

    ‚ÄúLook what?‚Äù I've determined I'm going continue wear beyond employer longer wants to. virus, strange combination obstinance made work day mask first place, spite, amusement people getting mad it. ‚ÄúI got Satan deemed get it. wanted quiet work. slow building church.

*Looks around hospital everyone dying* 

‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs pretty bad there.‚Äù absolutely insane! horrible leadership *while paying attention Reddit even tho you‚Äôre it.

Jk, don‚Äôt like talk violence inner cities lol wonder why. Great come watch people turn left hours.  Covid extra feature Remember people lost shit China truthful numbers? Yeah, wonder people still care transparency.  doubt, however, SARS 2. 

Pretty clearly lab error, still, interesting report.

Lab overlaps SARS 2 non - SARS 2 would expected. maybe kids cannot trained wear masks home, need stay home. lot like potty training. No. 

We‚Äôve testing level weeks now. Don‚Äôt one people. That's horse shit. Come Missouri. seen person wear mask since April absolutely infuriating see there. Seems plausible I‚Äôm sure explain lack spike northeast, also protests... Disney 100% powerful governor Florida first choice frame this, threaten survival survival care about, changed tact. Masks foolproof, help slow spread. Cases still go long people go out.

Argentina around 50,000 cases. US lot places mandated masks, got 40,000 cases single day. Memphis I've 4 different co-workers families take week+ vacations various beaches Florida month alone still right now... scary seeing numbers come now. Start read doctors get paid Medicare patients diagnosed COVID-19 considered presumed COVID-19 absent laboratory-confirmed test, three times patients placed ventilator cover cost care loss business resulting shift focus treat COVID-19 cases.‚Äù I'm challenging rebuttal claims. said, matter fact, mutating. wanted know know that. answer ""there's evidence suggest mutating"", we're done here. thought evidence suggested mutating better. would accept IFR range 1.2-.6% Thanks, hope right something Americans accept part life way health insurance, education, lack vacation days. Feeling bit hopeless lately everything back home.  Breaks heart. evidence you‚Äôre saying. Reported misinformation. live Cuenca. precarious balancing act right now. 2 3 ICU beds left cases keep rising. pretty much 100% mask compliance decent distancing, certain concessions economic reality bound bite us badly soon. example buses rural communities city still stopped, mostly, many people countryside used live wages earned town they're getting desperate. urban virus poised pounce poor rural communities soon buses start. matter majority people thing? Surely epidemiologists medical professions opinions ones count..... likely mask point public consider worn it. one might go public wear mouth nose 50% time, rest time chin. HIGHLY doubt wearing correctly entire time around others. Probably approved used emergency bases. I've worked hard sacrificed alot got (which isnt much I'm comfortable) dont intend lose martyr someon elses cause regardless much sympathize them. tHiNk eCoNoMy!!!11 seems think stop cases overwhelming hospitals. doesn‚Äôt understand take weeks things get better That‚Äôs saying, data skewed. probably examine actually going data blindly swallow numbers. oldest phones software versions can't support new feature. newer ones either already it, get next software update. pushing many phones can. A. It‚Äôs nothing research stage 

B. It‚Äôs something that‚Äôs even floated required company government.

C. automatically rush worst possible outcome.

It‚Äôs almost equivalent chasing self driving cars prevent robot takeover. saying support people chipped, saying don‚Äôt understand people‚Äôs reactions research development rushing worst possible outcome Gives police something good do. I'd love pass tickets day pieces shit Read further. actually making claim March 2019. Someone else different thread pointed samples tested negative particular sample may contaminated. I'm filing interesting folder, take fact yet. virus around longer, may explain things though, good way. strange ended misinformation. Twice area seen large bearded men wearing tiny little baby masks enough material cover mouth nose, wear mouth. still looks terribly stretched, though sized children.

What's that? point assume big population county problem wrong. proportionately smaller counties getting hit hard

edit: nyt cluster map shows fastest counties increasing, could check out. always mostly small counties top 20 everyone. undercurrent politicians around country tough luck sucks or, worse yet, hoax.

Instead Dr. Fauci, common sense dictated, great many people wanted rush go back normal get haircut. got new normal. long close child dies?  [Here's help decide. makes much sense testing error made somewhere along way. say impossible I'm going need see lot follow believe Texas decided test people Covid 19, high numbers.  /s Charlotte, Chicago, Philadelphia, New York, Miami, Los Angeles, Phoenix...  


[http://aa.fltmaps.com/en](http://aa.fltmaps.com/en) problems:
1. Knowledge virology much weaker less common. while, even clear pandemic influenza culprit. microscopes available time ability see virus.
2. particular strain N1H1 Influenza type *especially* efficient killing, including young individuals robust immune systems. 
3. Common behaviors time‚Äîlike tobacco spitting‚Äîhelped spread virus. 
4. war gave virus immense boost. Tens thousands men massed upon insanitary fronts dozens miles wide‚Äîwith many additional support personnel behind lines‚Äîassists microbes immensely. viruses, deadly bacteria well. say past tense balls deep pandemic Florida added cases one day total cases states. Sucks got bunch old people states Mandating everyone follow rules. military one section population actually controlled (I mean enforce rules easily), essentially starts day person enlists/joins. parents ex-military, got scared moment military started mandating, first sign bad going get. However, military 3 deaths, 10,000 known cases. think need put /s end it. Rednecks unite speaks significantly leadership they're sitting within 6 feet another one person end wearing mask.

If, (and huge if), tested negative right press conference, government leading example. fueling facebook grandparents around country say ""they wear masks! we?!"" Well people referring working, decided take vacation. Photos convince them. always claim photos hospital far away time place, claim photo photoshop.

The source denial emotional, rational. can't make someone give denial they're ready give on. defense mechanism, serves important function psyche, way let go need anymore, time like need ever.

Separate people best can. waste energy trying change minds; hold ground ignore them. I‚Äôm relaying scientific fact: masks aren‚Äôt effective. don‚Äôt protect airborne pathogens protect others exhalations like un-vented mask does. almost bad wearing nothing all. technical page mention ‚Äúawaiting‚Äù NIOSH approval testing documentation say used ‚Äúneutralized‚Äù non-charged polystyrene particles experiment. NIOSH approval takes months testing complete require testing charged sodium chloride particles masks never NIOSH approved. manufacturer knows useful dust masks, nothing more, that‚Äôs haven‚Äôt submitted masks appropriate NIOSH testing use medical setting. They‚Äôre vented dust masks intended reused. There‚Äôs reason medical N95 masks meant reused. 


So I‚Äôm happy seem managed avoid getting sick flying, would assume protected wearing one masks.Do lulled false sense security‚Äî probably one worst mask designs available right now, little protect time little protect others. least cloth mask effective protecting others. one thought NYC would go full lockdown got BAD - Texas taste NYC went same, regardless previously locked ""service industry"" posits serve others, give shot it. agree wearing mask amd grounds reprimand leading termination, insisting underpaid asses care selfish. Hey, flattened curve! vertical instead horizontal. counts, right? That‚Äôs point. time
I believe necessary point time medical world. ‚ÄúShitters full‚Äù mean good also they‚Äôre still fucked. yet see anything says correlation though. several things causing spikes including protests. know Eating indoors big cause. way handled like using gas pump put house fire forest. forest fire. get walking beach wonder someone said ‚Äúslaving away‚Äù describe working person thing exploded everywhere testing. knew manifesting non-flu respiratory issues without specific diagnoses.  look like Bobby Newport tho reason China well America shitter God Asian. I‚Äôve hearing months though...or picking sarcasm? people never learned anything. never grew that. Mom tells pan hot touch burn yourself. next time warns you, you‚Äôll probably listen. Well, lot people never learned way. consistently teach kids stuff. morons grew learn hard way. surrounded selfish idiot adults empathy resent authority. catch die spread others die. mask. misread comment edited. See above. Coffin manufactures love Texas. Like everyone else said, valid complaint. valid completely aware fits grand scheme things jerk getting want. Missing birthday stuff still sucks even sucks less others' current experiences!

You might want try arrange something virtual friends point everyone decent internet connection. Watch movie together, play game together, etc. one person needs Jackbox game everyone play it, example, one person share screen using something like Google Meet Discord everyone else connect URL game devices. (Movie watches generally done countdowns maybe sharing passwords anyone particular service... popular movie watch sites used know gone.) I've done successfully.

Or even spend family instead friends; 17, used parent-to-child time already, believe not. see mom less less years go on.

Either way, try something (unless really it, totally fine). guy helping he‚Äôs shut administration. resign Task Force meeting today publicly lay thoughts administrations response. It‚Äôs value left. Thursday, Texas saw another record number new cases ‚Äî 5,996 ‚Äî well hospitalizations ‚Äî 4,739. hospitalization number set record 14th straight day.

All shock aside Texas ~~locking down~~ closing businesses again, someone explain how/why numbers close?

Edit: ah, total hospitalizations. Still, ouch. think y‚Äôall forget massive number correlates 10% Americans actually is... also anti-maskers loudest minority, get news coverage. like sad protests open back up. minority Americans then, now. ""All essential businesses"" never claimed genocide. pointed COULD be. Come AZ! 49th education going #1 worst covid state... I'm sure numbers definitely correlate imagine long would taken without super computers fast transfer information across world  bubble probably filled deniers, that's info got you. actual statistics situation rock steady throufhout whole thing -- testing enough deaths reported. people positive test people die hospital covid symptoms exposure counted. People die home die pneumonia (which often symptom covid) reported pneumonia probably Covid. That's statistics deaths reported pneumonia many times higher yearly average important. Drinking home better, cheaper, worry DD, &amp; live alone &amp; S/O, naked. fuck anyone bother going out? end shut save economy. Things get bad shut anyways also unmanageable number sick people? flew American May flights 90% full.  Took second Wait you‚Äôre saying don‚Äôt wear shirt outside? That's I'm saying cronies court say going play dangerously counties say piss off? trump dodge impeachment getting senate say piss off, I'm sure counties could tell state piss well. There's lot people antibodies could help though. New York. CFR US currently around 5.5-6%.

You're thinking IFR. gonads? Since Bill Gates authority epidemics? better social distancing older people creates porous border two compartments though.

If elderly everything 100% perfect could disease rip young population they'd safe, happens. Instead statistical issue. Young people might making 10 mistakes day leads high infection rates, older people might making effectively 1 mistake day (or caregivers making 1 mistake day). Eventually high enough level infection general population mistakes going show infections elderly.

The net effect going doubling rate elderly ""compartment"" going increased climb slower. good. mark fundamental change disease (and happening disease would deadly catch over-80 would then). guys stop praising him? fucking caused first place. county fine 6 7 cases day, averaging 100 plus day. realize(or care) reason people infected lock down. afraid making big business backers angry, put lives risk. required take antibody test active covid tests starting school. Based description works, I'm surprised all. stranger calls asks personal information recent locations? Hard pass people. Even want help seems high risk scam.  he's busy making aligators high crack. Partly size India density population... also lack organization. Lock left 10's millions migrant workers stranded. One way migrant workers made many carried covid rural villages corners country. Well everyone Florida gets guys go back work faster right? It‚Äôs like pox party there. /s edit read them? Fucked irrelevant legal definition domestic terrorism applied instance. 

Knowingly attempt transmit lethal plague (or making threat) certainly could fit definition. square finding Office national statistics country 60-80% told people, 'Slow testing down, please' want see confluence failure education system utter carbuncle world's ass social media, watch volume way up. There‚Äôs lot overlap people won‚Äôt get vaccine people won‚Äôt follow social distancing measures. lot going get immunity old fashioned way. 3 years ago daughter flu progressed necrotizing pneumonia.  Nine day hospital stay, 2 surgeries, lost 30% lung capacity almost died. 8. I'm scared death covid. 30 cases per day single state muchly caused folks stay home tested positive.

Darwin awards around. suddenly disappear election over. [have bring going get downvoted hell. Texas big place. San Antonio Houston areas mask orders. Pissed what? Wanting stay safe pandemic? dare they! 6-7 months since pandemic started. 3-4 since declared one. Half year long time, one would think. still much left air regards immunity works virus? role,if any, antibodies play this? Whether it‚Äôs T-cells responsible immunity might exist?

I hear conflicting reports neutralizing antibodies also immunity isn‚Äôt possible. 

What‚Äôs taking long us figure out? 6 months long time. article filled ""can"" ""might"" answer? evidence suggest true 100% (or even 50%) cases, please stop fear mongering. it? Nature recently decided go full-on propaganda, I'm shocked they'd spew out. Turns related, matter badly people wish so. Masks work. type shit surprise live sheltered life.

Or US flashed name missed it. guy short, white Amish beard. niece considered ‚Äúbehind‚Äù school, means professionals. troubles life means good positions, however they‚Äôre making work have. Something lot people don‚Äôt seem want do, understand kids absolutely nothing, force kids could stay home benefit staying home, go school New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Connecticut... contained outbreaks. Meanwhile Georgia, Texas, Alabama, Florida, Oklahoma South Carolina seeing record increases. wonder difference here... unemployment right now?? pays minimum wage??? Americans get enough tough virus, lot people want get back working something. literally reason struggling right now. Yes, experience. sat professor said ""I leftist hack want hate white people vote leftists make gp_dude mad.""

And boom, brainwashed via thermodynamics, hypersonics differential equations. work leftist aircraft seed clouds chemtrails. DAD: works!!!...in way!!! interesting know average everyday citizen feels like though, we‚Äôre ones living well question is... mass protests cities cause increase cases, closing businesses preventing people gathering reasons going help reduce cases? Well found boomer mean sick blame want, caused excess unnecessary deaths vulnerable age group. faulting anyone new, caused lot infections deaths. Florida won‚Äôt catch NY guess won‚Äôt even particularly close good thing joke think people got it. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear poll respondents claimed wear masks time went one point last week.‚Äù

Sounds legit. Bill gates committed money towards effort private citizen. Among many humanitarian efforts. works: suppose increase testing, PPE suits etc happened magically. 

Why stop visiting Randia see real facts? I'm well aware said probably like beliefs. unfortunate many science deniers morality preachers paid taxpayer dollars. get it: people want able stab someone bus stop stop happening? Actually it‚Äôs way since dawn time. It‚Äôs always work live even die. make sound like new thing üòÇüòÇüòÇ that‚Äôs unique America. Varies poll poll, lot followers coming years. Right?!? fall on? Already overburdened teachers faculty? Get real control situation New York able stabilize faster. California issue resistance measures, least county levels.

Last time checked California 5,809 deaths New York 31,416 deaths. five times many deaths New York California California population twice much New York. pandemic months years, really can't say one state successful another point. did, California able control lot better point pretty much metric. Both. get trying message game, way abysmal. We've known time outdoors quite low risk, Japanese research shows transmission 19 times likely indoors outdoors. Looking states large percentage testing coming back positive (which evidence rapid spread) states ones largest protests. would say current spiking directly related protests. [Chinese testing. way Trump sees anything remotely Chinese-like.

""Masks pool-testing ways Chinese infiltrating way life freedoms, man"" listen, you? could good idea sell administration worded favorable way. Notably, could great employers testing precaution.

However, start new hotspots, quickly go wrong. ain't working Florida right now. Missouri:

I've gone masked work. stop Lowes Walmart (curbside pickup). amount people wearing masks probably 90%.

I surprised covid hotspot flare here. but...the rhetoric? taken seriously continue so. However, noted, everyone else's carelessness increases chance becoming infected. matter safe try be.

Especially forced come back office environment. feels excessive. Plenty rules regulations place without going full apocalypse fantasy. They're eyeing New York's high score. /s Good. nationwide fiercely enforced. Thought things getting better they‚Äôre much not. cannot much longer. lot laying bed, sleeping, crying. that‚Äôs it. Nothing interesting already severe anxiety worsening day. 

Honestly, even another year shit worth it, knows might do. Feasible. time get worse. would bueno. Yup. I'm here. still mystery Georgia Wisconsin well long. implying *not* real voter suppression knew someone would scream racism. employer forcing back office soon, pretty stupid, think wife taken pregnancy test 5 months. mean pregnant anymore?

Wonder belly getting big, must letting go quarantine. Refuse. 

I know unhealthy today help thinking people might come need. four hour run.

Amazon? GTFO. wont sell civilian. know luck? random online stores google. buy get protection looks like cool shit Bane mask. Plus seal better. guilt taking N95 away medical professional, R95s literally painting. DisneyWorld isn‚Äôt refunding tickets. reschedule use ticket price credit. Source: bought tickets Disney back beginning January, plan go July. We‚Äôd planning trip year.

Obviously we‚Äôre going anymore, get decide we‚Äôre going eat $1000 try predict might actually ok go sometime next year. Calling increase 19 cases Spain ‚Äúsurge‚Äù straight clickbait hyperbole That's irrelevant.

They agreed current environment.

Not really hard understand... ""Think stupid average person is, realize half stupider that""

- George Carlin IMHO paused season indeterminately. cases hit XX/million whatever gradiant want use, restart, finish bubble. shorten next season cancel entirely. 

this half ass business every sport trying squeeze partial season waves start next one time gonna work anyone use windows sell data tiktok faceapp literally obsessing virus 99% survival rate, many deaths people already dying pre-existing conditions. Meanwhile, millions families getting dumped poverty desperation, government lockdowns hysteria it. Oh well, least gangs criminals mass looting streets better ever. LOVE horror also muscle nerve damage pelvis. physical therapist actually banned playing first game scaring much tightening muscles messing progress. üòÜ Meanwhile white house tests everyone remotely comes near Trump. appears Americans ""live with"" them. Wonderful. Exactly. Many companies forcing people back office because. 

Mine included. worked home fine three months like you. Absolutely nothing bad happened it. go back in.

People can't work home need get back get work. company. zero reason everyone work home so.  mayor Jacksonville still holding off. I'm sure want put RNC risk measly lives. drinking smoking weed fortnight came ones phone sence 3 r somthing completely different man Yeah think numbers California hard read. 

First state large geography population. seems like lot cases people ends much. Remember, LA County populous many states.

The geography also makes difficult read numbers. LA numbers concerned about. Bay Area, seem things control.

Testing rate increasing, test positivity remaining same. good, really bad either. 

It really watch numbers right California hopefully enough people distancing wearing masks get curve rather holding steady. Even reinfections would still radar doctors find patients across globe. Also gets bad every year would absolutely torpedo herd immunity gameplans. flew tuesday morning currently plane right now, stewardesses asked everyone put back properly. Also: fill document contact details, sat, go reside (for potential backtracking infection chains) Southeast Michigan. Last month people wearing masks. complete 180. think lot people uninformed stuff started opening, thought over. Applebee's shut day near worker infected, decided still takeout... moment... think that's usually keeps it. Same. wonder things going look like end summer given near-universal mask usage

Source? interesting thing friend works hospital Gilbert discharges. Covid patients get released 100% ready go home, independent, interim care facilities accept due increased risk right now. Especially older folks might need days physical therapy/rehab strong enough take care themselves. probably inflating hospitalization rates bit, compared traditional illnesses. seen reported anywhere. I'm sure anyone collecting statistics like this, kind rehab needs people illness vary. 

My friend says people recovering we've seemingly gotten better treating it. Fewer people going onto vents. They're still packed, get wrong, seems like get it, odds may improved bit compared months ago. one benefit hoped flattening curve, give medicine time figure out. people want make political agenda slandering 'enemy' party wants, regardless party correct thing do. knows rest world found important time.

Bruh. Surely World War anything like Sorry. Florida, guess easier said nothing believing hype, corrected ignorant claim TMC one hospital . actually ‚Äúfrontlines‚Äù sort healthcare capacity would know that. course lying. Again, wipe shit please. sure whether protests helped. arguing genuinely curious: epidemiology really part medical field? thought statistical, sort like social science. virus gets Trump, then? TIL 44% US dumb shit! Literally nothing suggests vaccine won‚Äôt widely available fact is, lot people going die Florida.

This guess. agree. Someone must given really dark information last night made get morning issue bar closures yesterday like full steam ahead. Wonder happened. 5g fit in? never said go fuck yourselves. Lmao!!! know of. Though overheard people said it. sure got tested assumed though. problem happen though one person gets it. people (the higher ups) travel offices every week. even Boston office someone got it, could easily transfer offices. ya symptoms required stay home, symptoms yet? 

It feels like much risk work home. get people may need office task, come in. everyone needs here. make employee's decision judgement management. ways open office safely, feels like company bare minimum that's state government requires. office (Philly suburbs) said we're definitely going back least September. Even then, seems unnecessary chugging along fine WFH. I've saved like 120 hours commuting time far I'll probably quit lmao Awful.  I'm calling jokers scientifically dubious data manipulation clear agenda. Lol right? We're still first wave. Boston area too. Everyone street wears mask going outside. polite thing do. tried learn suppose complete technical point view, Covid cases report, financial package receive next year.

No diff regular budget.

I don‚Äôt see conspiracy, although way try share thoughts sometimes makes seem like that.

It‚Äôs really unfortunate that‚Äôs works. always said we‚Äôre #1!! S/ helps maintain distance. share findings r/Covid19? I'm sure they'd interested. Can't second wave first one never ends seem hard misunderstanding facts type bullshit nursing homes anytime someone points case increase South. Northeast hit early didn‚Äôt adequate testing treatments like remdesivir dexa, doctors much knowledge management. Plus NYC incredibly densely packed spreading home apartment complexes easy. doesn‚Äôt mean couldn‚Äôt done better, means turned around well now.

Florida‚Äôs hospitals aren‚Äôt overrun reported 9000 cases yesterday. keep hospitals way? facts opened high risk businesses like bars contact tracing place, didn‚Äôt seem give shit enforcing masks even though that‚Äôs one easiest things prevent transmission. want see Florida‚Äôs cases go up? Fuck no. Innocent people part die. want see governor taking increase seriously something it. Nearly 87% lying one also comes mind: ready medical bill... We'll know 17 days. Truly hope right.  People going back work May huddled massive thousand-person groups screaming top lungs. NBA gotta start backpedaling soon. tournament Florida already risky enough, NBA players continue test positive top that. There's much spread already pull something like safely. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

Got intellectually whipped report it, huh?

We still fewer deaths, still wrong. say mean maybe? nice job hostile reason takes reach exponential growth 5 -14 day incubation plus testing delay ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre ~~China~~ ~~Italy~~  New York!‚Äù Yeah, mean, types vacations ""ocean beach"". Mountains, trails, caves, etc. need water, lakes rivers. normal times really want ocean, sorta get it. Florida midst virus outbreak. FUCKED. alarming still won‚Äôt change people‚Äôs mind. 

Prepare full blown crash US economy. here's thing- people might right reopening soon, maybe worrying much..given thousands lives line, wouldnt make sense error side caution anyways??? Well, sadly everyone bias. That's also conservative democratic judges interpretation law.

Sheriffs can't write new laws choose enforce ones believe violate Constitution. course, even without evidence medics promote themselves. 

Let's consider fact far, nothing except attempts playing Chiropractic Physician. 

I suggest Chiropractic Physicians involved highest levels now. Whoops typing work hard 44% Widescale serology tests recently found 5-8% positive rates. depending method testing used; might high.

Really think could grab group active people fitting demographics get results would likely higher. he‚Äôs ~35 years old pretty sure picked club downtown (which admits bad idea). 

And is. That‚Äôs way people going recognize it. scientists experts across world telling us serious need making changes limit spread, many people going keep ignorance someone immediate periphery gets it, maybe even then. happens, suffer. Dr. Jo woman :) 

I would love convince people want respect sub's politics rule. want urge people vote, even long shot candidates, exactly reason stated. Non voters could literally elect anyone. someone living Santa Clara county, county literally issues everyone San Jose stopped caring. I've several cities county parents(we went hiking barely every ran people), everywhere looked fine, parents said San Jose(they went twice) polar opposite. clue word ‚Äútraitor‚Äù means.  Nope, actually opposite. rando OK here, fwiw, family closely monitored situation NYC horrified guys. visited first time January 2019 thought city people pretty great. 

Glad got visit Coronapalooza came Tulsa. Funny enough got voted office decade ago solved exactly zero problems he's telling people go vote solve. Hey President, browsing reddit briefing. argument work (hopefully) spike control (hopefully). Nooooooooooooooo daft? directly pointing people ""whataboutism""? know words think reply me. Nah wanted clarify part states. totally agree. Electorates reflect voters want stay away lol. would write coming Florida rest 2020 bother revisiting idea halfway 2021. People idiots here. world would better without us, trauma anyone knew us, economy better without us.

It exhausting. high dude. Despite fact NY really bad while, they're better now. FL hand, time see bad NY learn mistakes/actions, completely dropped ball COVID response. Amazong turnout, amazing. Good people. good good people. virus. Evil vanquished. CHINA! Northern California. It‚Äôs legally required county state California. Plus doubt many stores would let didn‚Äôt one on. people tell come ‚Äúwe request please keep mask on‚Äù. problem people ignore risk catching virus friends family members throw way many house parties doubt anyone wearing mask. DeSantis intervening hospital reporting data like Dad ‚Äúintervening‚Äù plumber comes repair Dad ‚Äúfixed‚Äù take joy right was. 126 thousand dead us, still thinking big deal? see covid also effect immune system thru eyes? Haha honestly. skip fall 2021 I‚Äôm college? Unless it‚Äôs then

But thank :) Please tell somebody's calling fuckers out.  countries don‚Äôt population US lmao, comparisons way don‚Äôt make sense anyway. should. Public health crisis hospitals capacity. wouldn‚Äôt care though. Even doesn‚Äôt affect I‚Äôm sure older family friends likely hospitalized die. Also say it‚Äôs going happen everywhere else hasn‚Äôt significant uptick cases Minnesota protests started. could easily change looks like it‚Äôs spiking hard South. would assume stigma mask wearing main reason behind it. 100%? difference. apology DeSantis forthcoming? know 0 people personally ~~that coronavirus.~~

FTFY    funny thing American ""fake news"" is.........if people US ***sure*** part news obviously ""fake"", problem??? mean, ***know*** fake, (they say....) would cause problem? Americans unable ignore something, even know entirely accurate? Banning travel buys extra time. useful actually use extra time prepare. unfortunately US that. Confirmed cases. spiking keeps going higher deaths/1M Texas. virus care party governor member of, whenever ANYWHERE opens going rising cases. 90% die. 1% likely die. 

I see point though. comes ""due ethnic background"". evidence populations targeted rest country? think we'd rather skip whole year. 2020 cancelled. Happy birthday, though! Try something fun mom. small celebration still meaningful fun. I‚Äôm surprised anyone feels like this, thought one. see many use masks safe practices everybody cooking books extent? Deaths cause person corona considered death covid. People dying without even tested COVID likely considered death covid. Add mass amounts asymptomatic people untested (and would they?) huge cooking books make look like black plague 2.0.

I feeling 'change numbers' allegation something like 'If certain covid, call covid' I'm sure someone gonna respond passionately mashing keyboard, asking want grandma die... Fun fact graveyard, know people live around can‚Äôt buried it? True also effect less stringent testing requirements, capturing mild cases. said, increase cases really due control spread states. Almost surely death rate set start increasing next 2-3 weeks. Amazingly still dont care good stands today. Next week gonna paint much clearer picture. also good majority new cases people age 44. Hopefully cases result short hospital stays necessary declining death rate. 

At least people wearing masks around valley. surprised Ducey follows Florida closes bars. combined increased mask wearing could help get control Highest single day May 1212. Today 7 times that. NBA still go end July? Wonder arrested second time bonded out. 

Oh, wait. America. need reasons terrorize folks. Fucking pigs. really bad. Florida needs lockdown now. probably already late. Exactly. USA social welfare. 

They corporate welfare though, like 500b Corona money went corporates cronies accountability. point proving? helping spreading predisposed narrative. ‚ÄúGo protest, don‚Äôt support businesses work‚ÄùYou‚Äôre part solution. you‚Äôre also lost sauce meatballs 2 day old account lot say tells you‚Äôre motivation elsewhere. So, Wednesday almost 35,000 test results come back.. Friday supposedly nearly 69,000 test results come back seems little sketchy me. Fuck people, think Texans comment section though lol. There's reason ""don't get it"".

And that's there's nothing get. thought planning here, kneejerk reactions keep Dear Leader another bunker meltdown. Actually, didn't. fact terminate responding phone calls emails.

These morons got hit strict enforcement stay home rules lied press.

They made easy responding.

One started working jan, lied press factory, tesla called multiple times leaving messages telling 2 days respond would fired. refused answer calls ignored messages. worked less 6 months, clearly wanted fired.

When people still payroll, communicate employer. people purposely ghosted company refused answer phone calls. wanted get fired. did, reason got changed. Sounds white two sisters meet one backyards sit 6-10 feet apart wear masks. We're outside eat anything make sure we're 10 feet apart. little foldable tables bring. hugged sisters since March, see outside. hate whole ""people think hoax real"" line. realize possible think real yet also think response disproportionate? 

Strawmanning helpful. sorry,  ""4 times more"" actually 5\*X. 
and 4 times less "" - X\*4"" less means 'minus'.


But like said, guess meant, pointing said. people legitimate reasons even concerns sending children school, coerced state so. 

But - point ridiculous assume 99.95% Swedes sending children school fear sanctioned. 

Equally ridiculous assumption know opinion issue, already said irrelevant point trying aimlessly make. 

I told stop chasing tail knew would bite ass. done so, go back chewing bone. joke. restaurants open dine-in anyway. political, restaurants can't make profit 50%. type testing really useful mass blanket testing large populations relatively low infection rates.

That great keeping areas control control.

What need regular testing hot spot states, better social distancing/masks, contract tracing place. Ah interesting! Someone suggested Kellyland Irish butter older man approaching gym afraid ask details think afraid coming across creep (I'm woman) wonder actually talking about.

Honestly, went 8 different dermatologists said 'alopecia' I've always suspected actually thyroid issue. can't get anyone take seriously enough endocrine testing. (I'm woman.) 

I'm sure actually understand means, though. Xanth still going strong. 2020 ended yet. early tell humans around 2021, 100 years. flag good news? definitely 90% California, like 40, maybe 50% area. home.  Well sort odd despite huge rise cases last two weeks seeing sort ramp higher death count. obviously seeing 1% already, would expect sort steady incline. Wear mask. Provide enough financial resources non-essential workers businesses affected social distancing measures. Re-structure economy keep cases reaching exponential growth.

Our economy *not* designed human wellbeing. We‚Äôre ready conversation. social spending wellbeing anti-American. numbers quickly approaching NY's peak numbers outbreak (10-11k per day)... thanks pointing captain obvious. merely pointing lack research done waste water china. hop high horse son [archive link anyone trouble accessing article ](http://archive.is/M7Wci) belive deaths lag new case spikes, remains low weeks spike, would good sign. think mean the-party-that-shall-not-be-named-in-non-political-threads said decades money important people. they're out, loud, proud it. including dozen already knew march?

Here say masks masks yet NIOSH approved. part multi-phase testing process, filters tested Nelson Laboratories Salt Lake City, UT tested 99.9% efficiency particulates .1 microns size. N95 rating means mask filters least 95% particulates .3 official test results available website: 

The mask creates excellent seal - note filter medium, attach foam gasket improve fit. take fit test them? No... tell providing good seal - absolutely. Would allowed CDC bio lab...of course not. 

I'm internet idiot comes respirators vs masks, fit test, filtration, filter mediums, etc. would absolutely put n95 worn past. Go take look [documentation lab absolutely better t-shirt. could also altitude thing could genetic thing instead. hard open state state basis? Many states, specifically northeast, already hit peak well opening makes sense open  providing incentives per covid patient treated. Treating covid patient rather expensive normal patient, payments larger.  took little effort conspiracy nutjobs spin 
this ""Paid call everything *There apostrophe, much testing, told eggheads slow testing down.*

~Donald J. Trump 2020 lot numbers aren‚Äôt released anymore. think fraction drops profile ""infected"" becomes younger. Older people careful, right? That's interpret data, could wrong. probably shut people bitching people wearing masks *all time,* including parks etc.

And bit revenue grab, cities/counties/State going broke without tourists. wonder things going look like end summer

[There's much rate we're handling this. think extreme. People surviving without grocery stores millions years. cherry pick information too? Majority workplaces agriculture. majority workers. need see number employees that, guess swedish still bad. Notice workplaces employees? ~~Because seasonal work provides seasonal employment.~~

Correction: workplace Sweden specific address location business conducts operations - hence one employer several workplaces. Source: I‚Äôm honestly pretty close belief we‚Äôre something like matrix. control enough Earth‚Äôs resources basically make place utopia, almost every turn powers make allocate resources way inhibits us instead. feels methodical human point.  watched live feed Tulsa rally outside started (un)surprising number supposed ""Christians"" saying God chose Trump president, work. people far gone saved. Thank you, missed WOMP WOMP property tax? rate millennials gonna need 3 wishes genie 1 bedroom apartment. week ‚Äúfucking duh‚Äù would careful wish for. Sure mass survialance helped South Korea beat virus, happens after? governments around world end abusing power contact tracing apps? governments willing get rid contact tracing apps crisis over? seems unlikely. thought read research says transmissions via children seems relatively uncommon.

To clear, anyone infected *can* spread this. amount ""shedding"". coughing (or sneezing, that's uncommon covid), spreading well probably high viral load. simply breathing, viral load might orders magnitude lower, well-ventilated area breath dissipate instantly.

People trouble orders magnitude risk assessments, absence clear, numerical results scientific studies help. asymptomatic. going bubble that‚Äôs highly enforced. nba season happening. Better 1/5 back March, guess. 500000 people die smoking every year [Then person seem much different. Actually worse since knows infected.

If church smart they'll stop allowing attend. guess he's evangelical FALSE CHRISTIANS believe Trump chosen God that's likely. That's valid point, know served food, flew 1,5h slept know collective punishment crime humanity.

Y'all seem ready shoot people ""save people"" COVID. like Conquistadors forcibly concerted Natives Christianity, segregating enslaving raping murdering bragging folks saved sending Heaven.

Fuck stateists. Sick psychopathic violent assholes. Today (reports always day behind, mind you) Ah, leadership. miss days US. Guaranteed it‚Äôs representative though Im taking side saying groups wanted police take step back. yall could agree say need less power would big step forward How? quarter measures nothing end year 

Taking account treatment improved. 4x less likely die Covid April Lie more.  Cry more.  Go on, want to. Killing 1% people genocide. sort thing tends fragment cultures send everyone looking work though. I'm guessing lab worker panicked fucked accidentally used contaminated kits produce results considering made entire year's sample got March doodoo source original claim... 56%? much casualties americans need take seriously? knew bunch nutheads, always thought still clear minority. 

I'm nurse want think much ever cope America. tough Europe too, 90% people still realized something new something can't get around without taking serious hit economy, even bigger hit apocalyptic consequences casualties taking right actions time. feel sorry get really bad leadership attitudes morons think political question waived disagreeing science. Many Asian countries report low infected numbers. lying? That's happening South Florida since whole mess started. mean, we're opening active cases closed. reason? donator class losing money we're protecting ourselves.

I forget, much money Canadian government given shutdown? Last heard $8000 per person. That's almost much Trump handed public corporations, per person US. Wave 2 think legitimiate concern economy, mean economy sense food table. iphones whatever else. long things go needs start becoming wants.

The idea rolling lockdowns makes sense tbh. mental physical health concerns isolation well. Nothing simple hitting pause button untill COVID passes, *ever* passes. People vote whichever two politicians minds lesser two evils. fricking polls come from. I've never seen poll last four months. Wow looks like we‚Äôre trying get 50k today! North East region response going together seems worked really really well Yes. Epidemiologists slant healthcare, health policy quantitative roles. social sciences suppose, kind like varying specialities engineering lawyers. Theres lot overlap field specialists well. Also statistics heavily applicable healthcare fields. saying ""I hate trump"" imply guilt. fact, seems go way work remove guilt. exact oppposite. situation looking like terms hospitalizations deaths there? like job writing Reddit?  bs speculation based vague data. attempt stir shit. can, however, speculate grocers practice safety precautions (social distancing, masks, etc) diners tend ignore protocols... I'm torn.  hate wrote, want upvote, true, to.

Thanks adding clarity. mother passed dementia years ago, symptoms much like Alzheimer's, given long ago may Alzheimer's, given reason dementia officially. realizes help country limited role biting tongue; could sidelines. Nope. That's sad part! Nah, one word: bars. People drinking masks on, bars clubs open nothing happening. funny downplay ""under 1000 cases per day"". take look Beijing [handle found 20ish cases day two weeks ago.  seems weird. Florida allow carryout alcoholic beverages? that's case, wording makes sense. not, shut bars? 

(Sorry stated article. phone started flashing jumping around ads) honestly, even find inconvenience. covers part face like makes harder smell people's farts.  conspiracy theorist I'd say indeed done purpose next government complete mess hands. Oh yeah, sorry that. Honestly didnt realize Mass repub governor... cast vote. electorates set amount votes based population plus 2 believe (the amount matter works, sorry messed up). electorates take account state voted, electorate allots votes towards presidency. lot states usually follow winner takes all, they're constitutionally required so. Also, case know (sorry condescending phrasing) states run elections, federal government. want source something source false? people paid.  would say teleworkers, people collecting unemployment inclined prioritize safety right else.

Everyone else pulling juggling act. Government failed us Yes. far saying need wear damn maskm Vietnam near 0. Thailand. larger population Florida. Good start. shut down. don't.

The way we're actually going future stop pretending guaranteed.

We're run civilizational collapse they're still talking like we're going moon base 50 years we're likely burning alive 30. It‚Äôs way change things anything short continue economy rich. know fact. EVERYONE MUST LOSE EVERYONE GAIN. We‚Äôre finally getting people personal circle friends/family coming virus. summer going reckoning lot Americans can‚Äôt follow directions. Lockdown didn‚Äôt really work India. don‚Äôt know reasons why? Non compliance? heard there‚Äôs insufficient financial support go lockdown? know calculation referring (whether median mean), whether accounts outliers, whether accounts cost living? account presence social safety net? REALLY can't blame doctors knowing perfect way treat novel condition incomplete data! Sadly that's just....something often learned getting wrong societal level. medical professionals fault info exist yet. Oh yeah gave fucking Bright idea could possibly highly contagious virus spreading spiking high numbers country people fucking morons selfish? someone would warned them! observations it‚Äôs way around. live Portland would expect people wearing masks. Nope. Laughably low reported death totals. That's causes shit. stupid-ass ""but Karen needed haircut"" arguments. I'm going get downvoted but, lockdowns specifically used flatten curve, used place vaccine developed. take pressure healthcare works. available tests, better treatment, PPE, data virus. far better prepared March. goes every country. Yes people still wear masks use precaution lockdowns? Cases probably going rise significantly due testing availability, doubt see number deaths per cases saw March. vote away doomers. Sadly Family spread explodes numbers quickly. I'm trying make light virus (im actually afraid think be) wave positive tests much younger average before. likely come lower hospitalization rate. said, even lower hospitalization rate mean much infected population continues grow like this. also hurricane season people, cant even imagine big one hitting right now, absolute panic would set like apocalypse movie I‚Äôm It‚Äôs fine everyone! highest cases ever!  amazing programmers UK. bad people power decide money. Yes, anecdotal really popular bar neighborhood packed 6pm till close every night live bands, one distances, local authorities enforce capacity violations obviously one wears masks. 

What alternative? Remove alcohol. mention, we've never done lockdown flu, even close comparable. Government. Lol. Still suppressing death totals see true. majority entitled Americans wearing masks incorrectly wearing noses exposed. returning items mall yesterday hour long line. Almost us wearing masks, must admit. Except YOU, Mrs. Nose air daughter! think immune? East, wearing mask means sick. want protect illness? Checking Washington state wearing mask public law today. covid things Florida? Let's use governmental power enforce lockdowns save millions vs. let's murder people street black way, shape form even remotely same. Inconceivable context means groups funded organized way **appear** genuine grassroots organizations, reality centralized organization fomenting them. like, ""Liberate Michigan"" run two gun nuts Florida. \[[more point businesses start safe smart thing, regardless gov says? think throws money things says, ‚Äúhere science boy‚Äù? spends time fighting problems, decades now.

And what, think people researching covid 10 years allowed authorities? Oh wait. Covid-19 like 9 months old...

He‚Äôs among leading voices warning us prep disaster years happened. I'm medieval doctor-dentist bad migraines drill hole skull cure die ..

.. die migraine? Refrigerated trucks back! Right wrong, asked opinion?

Fix Zune dammit! Antibodies don‚Äôt need exist blood immunity. Come dude. Ironically enough, Aspen outbreak started group Australians. broke quarantine ski Snowmass.

 Holy crap. That‚Äôs big jump Florida. thing infuriating (and lot them) everyone told ""open economy now!"" morons opening early would ultimately fuck economy more. could responsible grown ups sucked like rest world 2 shitty months lockdown. Instead, Karen wait get haircut additional month margaritas friends. here... Given many samples currently ongoing, skeptical this.

I can't blame much that. Personally I'm skeptical literally every statistic come straight PEW Gallup. They're organizations I've found consistently optimal statistical data, legitimate representative sampling, coherent inferences data.

They're perfect, drop imperfections almost every source normally cliff dive IME.

As far study goes, idk wtf ""Ipsos‚Äô Knowledge Panel"" even is. I've got bag salt nearby, though.  half step. apply religious services, local government operations, child care, youth camps. long 6 feet stations can: get hair cut, get massage, get tattoo tan. allows business require masks precludes jurisdictions imposing civil criminal penalties wearing one. Let start saying I'm huge sports fan comes standpoint...

Sports important public health, especially considering throwing players right smack middle huge virus growth area. think good idea. I'll still watch play, think should. sure... ""RemindMe 2 weeks!!!""

I'm going bother, we've playing game months now.

And somehow New York sits top shit heap month month.  another post said we'd hit 10K Friday, far off.

The thing help (since we're shutting down) wear mask keep social distancing. see Palm Beach County hearing mandated masks, people still complying. 

Everyone needs realize State Govt anything - take care &amp; family.  u/BiologyJ's comment downvoted. Statistical claims valid, otherwise make them. 

We're better general opinions like ""The US good job managing COVID"" spreading confusion statistics. Whatever happened Dallas salon lady? Ah, reality presented finally huh? Here's reliable article - Yes, protests think? can‚Äôt breathe. would like putting knee necks 8 minutes.... arent counties giving free marks? fining people distributing every household amazing, even experts can't help hedge expert advice 'do want' disclaimer.

It's risk averse nonsense ended nation chicken-little's screaming people stop killing grandma swimming around major cities high infection rates probs bad idea. I‚Äôve felt way time nice see data start backup hunch. US well completely ignore statement about. propaganda bot trying gaslight me? ""accelerated transmission led significant resurgence left unchecked push health systems brink again"".

This thread says completely wrong. acceleration resurgence. since can't say anything try angle away something else. 

You also ignore list Belarus Russia act like nothing happening. take ""If Sweden want list test anyone."" **But completely beside point spend entire answer at.** ignore post actually confirm pushing agenda. Thanks bill gates!! people get survive though, good portion population feel nothing. black plague ebola. historically times crisis corporations governments exploit crisis gain power typically give crisis. Reported misinformation. Well lucky you, healthy. Im immunocompromised due two severe health conditions 9 year old immunocompromised due medication juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. flu last year hospitalized 2 weeks. could well kill really get sick. still live lives, dont go stores, visit family right live fear. hypervigilant make sure frequent handwash, social distance, wear masks do. need moved mental health hospital deprogramming sub overrun ccp shills it‚Äôs even subtle keep seeing video come feed Twitter. far I've managed avoid watching fear might get dumber. basically proving point there, hoss. media claiming protests causing covid spikes, people going lives high list priorities, suspect?

Good one, someone disagrees must illiterate. clever.  rich people. 
What know?  invalid complaint. year sucks can‚Äôt imagine teen :( don‚Äôt birthday. sucks even video call (maybe bf guide making birthday cake? Idk) good. make stupid year unfortunately Fewer refers specific number.

like number patients?

also, definition: 
preposition

""$900,000 less tax"" Weekends always underreported. problem since beginning. guy never even showed work? Based direction Florida's numbers, hospitals might need take back nurses qualified ICU nurses. mentioned tall buildings usually building large 40 stories full time security team owners building conscious following laws don‚Äôt get fucked insurance something goes wrong. 

People still wear masks pretty much everywhere PA, pretty much universal stores. People started get little lax disaster unfolding Sunbelt wake call hopefully people realize need take seriously, wear masks avoid irresponsible gatherings maintain hard earned gains keep economy open. Comparing handled two... want cry. day Trump gets insulted someone incompetence handling crisis. asked record levels new cases ""one nasty women"" reporters. depends. Ohio (every state different), m4 least serious, m1 1 step f5.

m4 m3 m2 m1 f5 f4 f3 f2 f1. 

m4 30 days jail $250 fine. m1 carries 180 days jail (unheard punishment, that's max) max fine $1000.

most cases see, bar repeat offenders, get time served (usually 1 2 days jail arrested) like 20% max fine.

a $250 fine good incentive put t-shirt face though. hopefully enforced almost like people change mind faced new evidence. borders

The virus coming inside country really love - mean love - downvoted saying something pragmatic. View data sets comparison. love feels whole lot like confirmation I‚Äôve come expect people. Depending data state shares, may able create charts numbers. /r/coronavirusga saint creates daily charts information.

Yesterday's chart example - Please look wearing face shield mask! There‚Äôs growing evidence it‚Äôs really effective. Stay safe, feel you. 40 million newly unemployed, country healthcare insurance tied job. 

But yeah, I'm sure people worried getting haircut. still cool drink crying alone dark, right? can't procedural error established procedures dealing something.

Stop trying find way make Coronavirus deaths fault people put lives danger trying help. /s 

You forgot Direct quote article : ""As long practice physical distancing precautions, see friends.¬†Your faces¬†must stay covered keep minimum six feet you. Ideally, outdoors, there‚Äôs better ventilation virus less space-constrained."" Well, hundreds thousands people marching streets cities 2 weeks massive groups. lot stuff even officially opened...... don‚Äôt say... lol Absolutely. think Sweden would better place failed keeping virus away vulnerable groups ie care homes beginning. Oh no. anymore. went gay wedding cakes. Write cards now. Send week. Reported misinformation. Wow, fascinating thanks spent tanks southern states lot anti-authority anti-science type people (unless abortion sex). want told government like listening science. aren‚Äôt stupid enough manipulated every turn president doesn‚Äôt give shit. Excuse numbers NYC improved. Wake middle America! Trump doesn‚Äôt care you. USA pretty much lost cause. comes healthcare system. numbers reflect afford healthcare. There's poorer middle low income population never seek medical assistance, never count towards statistical reporting continue infect others. imagine atrocities 'leader' might try pull second term, need even TRY reelected, coming realization likely years left live...if shit now...omg. Great. need. Indiana avoiding spike states seeing, bring bunch people states city freaking auto race infect us. fucking perfect. they're realizing unemployment run landlords start evicting again. Well there's housing armageddon horizon, speed bunch new taxes? There's much community spread measures effective. He's keeping churches open even 100 people service. need full lockdown want slow train lol what? Mmmmm yes could be. authors article speculated reason is. imagine it‚Äôs one thing - question extent variable responsible. would say 25% huge jump though weather UK consistently hot, aside past couple days. Cut pandem.... Waiiit. No, shouldn't. Add [16 NBA players tested stupid going playing. American Citizens take evil, corrupt Governments back sinister Corporations them?

Is finally time violent, bloody revolution? fucking scary GA right now. Everyone desensitized still going first info received virus ( flu, effect anyone 60). work restaurant fully open restrictions like 20% customers even wear masks software code made free. open source. UK government download right ""now"" without costs attached.

The Corona App also made available rest world downloaded applestore googleplay right ""now"" well, free.

The UK even ask 44% population short-sighted idiots. established. No, point know. We're soon enough results, however, know fact happens.

I've chicken pox dengue fever too. I'm guy want get I'll probably carry rest life.

After good news people working vaccine already admitted might provide immunity year. going become part yearly flu shot program already get two doses of, yearly, I'm 56. Yeah least outsides insides, like case. similarities Russia US every day but... com mie bas tards! logic baffling we've asked insist temporary. heard we're least September. agree kept everyone home safely enter 100%. CEO convinced better together what's point half company still home? 56% puppets origin covid China, drive orange public hair grumpy old man even grumpy. Mmm, need less word. agree BMI bad measurement people work said BMI 30 almost never going fit person. 

27-30 BMI close sounds. would gain 20lbs get BMI 30.

Depending training wise gaining 20lbs muscle could take 3-4 dedicated years it‚Äôs even possible (likely you‚Äôve working 2 years already). 

On hand gained 20lbs fat you‚Äôd probably would feel great it. That‚Äôs enough you‚Äôd buy new clothes. Dva number one, never forget working?  didn‚Äôt take poll wtf, majority everyone takes like voting? I‚Äôm hopefully flu won‚Äôt spread nearly quickly year already taking precautions COVID. I‚Äôm sure still spread, yes everyone taking seriously, still. 

You‚Äôre right people recovering COVID though! idea expect that, it‚Äôs probably going wild ride. job ability completely remote. fact, since end March things fine. Last week started staggered scheduling limit employee employee contact. Still felt could've waited, ok, compromise least.

This week let us know **moving up** reinstatement normal work schedules Monday literally everyone back office. 

I can't even stress incredibly frustrating is. numbers escalating, heard peep reconsidering schedules. work home, protect us? feel fear losing buck. 

Oh governor basically forced one top health officials resign. Cool, cool, cool. How????? governor turned everyone loose May like wild animals?! mayor San Antonio livid. audacity tell us can‚Äôt even locally enforce masks. Fuck Abbott. killing us. remember pandemics always part history. difference worried using common sense keeping health mind. 
Do patterns anxiety COVID? certainly healthy thing truly believe going straight end humanity. Make sure best keep mental health. Take days looking subreddit. like glare people idea. wish sub would focus people dying this. Something like 50%+ obese, imagine many overweight..

Get fucking chair get shape open country Okay. shouldn‚Äôt confidently say majority it‚Äôs mere 56%. understand 56 greater 50 come on. Ummmm... DUH! 9/11 social media like this. Social media cancer. Lol That‚Äôs funny months dismissive douchebags bunch, they‚Äôre going full 180 fining people. funniest part EVERYONE brain heads saw coming. Idiots. 
I really can‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs absurd disconnect collective understanding discourse country mention studies questioning long immunity lasts: Eh, depends product. Sheep big thing Gotland, example, season typically spring fall. sure crops, example apples late summer thing. 

And smallholders know find someone come care farms take holiday. part parcel one. Texas here. I‚Äôm big city rates going roof. Something noticed couple stores yesterday people without masks senior citizens. It‚Äôs insane me. Trump could save many lives directly asking public wear masks. Honestly think issues stem far that, basically Cold War. That's Communism became evil word, media made everyone think Socialism = Communism.

Ever since America became anti socialism, country ceased taking care people. reason, people loved that. Bill Gates wants microchip use brainwash control entire world population!!!! /s deny people service wear mask, can't come store. offer curbside pickup home delivery, free. people can't really call discrimination. article says

exactly **All residents way involved hospitality industry** serve ensure Gotland lives visitors. clear see breakdown. heavy, says Frida Boklund, Entrepreneur's regional manager Gotland. I‚Äôm proud CT think Lamont fairly strong leadership though this. us really serious wearing masks here. hope collectively keep guard continue trend. Shame tree crush entirely rather half him. No, I'm saying. I'm saying mask good idea outdoor exercise heavy labour. becomes somewhat problematic, policy making reflect reality. seriously? houston going prepared that?  caricature. power hungry corrupt autocratic authoritarian governments. democracies corrupt best interest people heart.

The evidence staring right face. 

You compare HK exactly? America?

I tell you, entirety last year violent demonstrations HK police killed single person. Contrast happening US demonstrations. called national guards military. HK thing left civil enforcement already bodies.

Right now, Western world become shining example kept saying countries. think know phrase 'banana republic' means.  appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* probably city though, rest new york way lower population density. use yer brain Getting grip situation. Looks like plan. even response said it. answer that? intelligence deal level ignorance calm competent manner. I'm Houston went doctors weeks ago nurses wearing mask. included woman taking temperatures door. brought gave nasty attitude. Jesus christ. spike happen months later compared states?

I'm California really much better either. really good argument! :-) Gold star! thinking protests? know, time US kept breaking records day day False information. Here's actual testimony fake story based on...

Mark A. Morgan

(Click top link June None compare anyway shape form US think they‚Äôve eradicated doesn‚Äôt mean have. 

For country like NZ they‚Äôll completely tank economy years come. Best luck one. Well said. right thing family, also showing respect people's health medical staff.

Try ignore friends comments go gut. Better safe sorry. accidentally read bit Mitt's dad. (It article reading.)

He civil rights presidential candidate lost ""southern strategy"" turn party, recall correctly. much *not* think party today.

I wonder Mitt finally thought ""what would dad do?"" Gaaahd. Look phrase every grammar forum see consensus adding word ""less"" makes inverse geometric relationship. assume speaking english language here. not, there's point arguing this. NGA let people special permission even enter building, temperature checks, masks required, anyone tests positive Covid lock area person working 2 weeks clean area wearing protective suits.

Intelligence community takes shit seriously. Right?! overweight health compromised mother absolutely believes virus can‚Äôt live heat ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt exist around except nursing homes prisons‚Äù. Despite evidence otherwise. maybe doesn‚Äôt even know gone rabbit hole watches right wing BS. clients son tested positive he‚Äôs ~35 years old pretty sure picked club downtown (which admits bad idea). It‚Äôs old people. It‚Äôs cold places. Lawsuits coming ‚Äúmy freedoms!‚Äù understand businesses running foundation able live lives do, right? can‚Äôt print money, doesn‚Äôt even seem like we‚Äôre willing that. People literally can‚Äôt afford put food table anymore. would think river rafting would fairly safe kept lower number people know... upsetting dont realise difference people mocking people mad. telling, too. Give time hospital resources maxed, bodies start rolling in. Creating app difficult.

Unless approach give work lowest builder capable.

This also governments contracting work often end shoddy product. Hey! What‚Äôs thing suddenly coming towards fast? fast. big flat round, needs big wide sounding name like ‚Ä¶ ow ‚Ä¶ ound ‚Ä¶ round ‚Ä¶ ground! That‚Äôs it! That‚Äôs good name ‚Äì ground!

I wonder friends me? Hey! got idea! STOP POLLING OPINIONS MEDICAL SCIENCE ISSUES POPULATION DEMONSTRATED POOR UNDERSTANDING BOTH? Exceptionally thoughtless bet Swedes laughing balls off, right now.

Most world playing whack-a-mole Covid cases despite committing economic hari-kari - death toll slips single digits economic confidence immediately bounces back. live North Georgia, 2 hours Atlanta. work grocery store, 75% coworkers believe coronavirus real, believe numbers faked hospitals trying get money. I'm sure cases cause death reported incorrectly, think anywhere near significant number deaths. 


How convince that, literally, rest world correct virus real? virus politicized otherwise smart capable people brainwashed fake. I've tried asking conspiracy scale could possible, even benefits something like this? every single healthcare worker affected areas agree massive problem? nobody, conspiracy magnitude, slipped gone media evidence contrary? 

It's fucking frustrating see coworker clock out, take mask, go traipsing store like nothing's wrong that. Makes blood boil. I, 23 year old college student, somebody coworkers see dumb gullible, convince otherwise? lost cause? can't let go inability wear mask public could FUCKING KILL PEOPLE. True. Good getting PhD!

Maybe EU opens back bans American trade travel become clear done. worry USA gets strict people forget halfway repeat thing (rates go down, people start disregarding precautions). think masks help lot become mandatory everywhere. could technically everything open people adhere strict guidelines. think average person knows pandemic works, exponential people it, spreads longer takes go away. Excellent points! suppose really kool thing 2020 smartphone many people‚Äôs hands basically makes everyone journalist &amp; gives many us ability record crime &amp; share shed light sliver corruption otherwise might gone unchecked mostly complacent lives really need see flat brutal murder porn raise eyebrow &amp; like damn justice system pretty fucked up. ü§™ Also poll friends... I'm guessing people consider pneumonia mild. Yes different types. say mild pneumonia mild symptom. said pneumonia was. could mild severe....or write symptom guidelines know? NY, NJ Northeast: üëÄ sorry, say people tourism, food production agriculture take holiday summer? know intensive workload-wise season industries - give hint. current season. Exceptional nationwide negligent homicide. sure you‚Äôre downvoted fact.. actually rigged years. It‚Äôs mind blowing people don‚Äôt understand see this.

‚ÄúGo vote!‚Äù solution everything fact rigged whether Russia, China, USA even, voter suppression, magically conveniently losing ballots, eLeCToraL cOllEgE, etc. anyone thinks voting solution wild fact idea votes manipulated pure ignorance assume they‚Äôre counted fairly evenly? 

The system needs changed revamped completely vote new system replace shitty system shitty system works way want to? 

How many years take everyone realize fucked voting let alone real solution.  I‚Äôve really surprised relieved I‚Äôve try look beautiful (or even presentable) anymore. mask related much, that‚Äôs small part it. Q:How lads States manage that!?!? A:they not... managing billionaires control government lol. They‚Äôre behind funding everything public health economics. response related updated data. updated data poll numbers, nothing science Covid-19. America doomed second Trump said response coronavirus federal responsibility state responsibility. nail coffin.

America's hope vaccine. **Bars got shut noon Today** meant financially customer perspective Given Trump moved part Convention Florida see Desantis holding back long possible order embarrass anger Trump. worried school starting back up? put August 5 open plans keep everyone safe. 1100 kids plus staff anxiety high. isolation worthless open. ""lots Swedes"" certainly say lot all. know media jump opportunity make things lot worse/more common are. single person I've spoken expressed desire travel abroad. trust me, corona hot conversation topic. 100 people could call airlines complaining international flights. lot? newspaper could certainly see way. That's what, 0.01‚Ä∞ population? Oh boy, new numbers coming Arizona Texas, change people's opinions direction people thinking quick reopen, I'm disappointed.


I wonder percentage changed people finally longer quarantine rather stay quarantine. definition slaves ability self determination. nothing much paid. far know, older people get sicker necessarily likely carrying spreading it.

Younger folks spread silently *precisely* ones need watch about. realize one following pro-COVID crowd like sheep right instead thinking yourself? $130. Username checks out. related Biden? made maybe 1% blm protests do. Also social distancing better lol smart wear masks tiny fraction percent still die. stupid wear masks ten percent die. Let herd thin themselves. don‚Äôt know don‚Äôt make wild claims assumptions personally. pointed something use Karen double get mad. want talk it? China took *very* serious measures. quarantined people fast. restrict people heavily, heavily encouraged people stay inside - pretty much stay home like month. one complained masks. one went way avoid prevention measures. 

And *are* significantly cases China admits, honestly probably successful air-tight cover-up history, there's literally evidence it. live major Chinese city even *rumours* secret cases. Hospitals quiet, one seems know anyone actually it. even catastrophe change affect them. Go google find 3 seconds. CDC. Johns Hopkins. see sky rocketing south. Ok, child Don‚Äôt forget lime Even subscribe hoax idea feel peer pressure wear mask. go-fast boat driving Bubba fishing friends wear one damn sure going risk ridiculed wearing one. didn‚Äôt hit two weeks closing. Texas Florida absolutely fucked. Luckily lot boomers, advancing age terror. There‚Äôs still occasional Aubrey Huff meant lot nations go around boasting 0 cases even day/week went lenient restrictions new cases flare worst thumble weeds *Judge Dredd entered chat* Alzeimer‚Äôs common form dementia. You‚Äôre right. 500? *Laughs German* Idk live, vast majority country, people still can‚Äôt get tested feel like it. symptomatic, known contact positive case, healthcare worker, LEO, live work nursing home, caregiver immunocompromised patient, etc.

Even free tests CVS available minors, article specifically about.. 3 top 4 ranked new cases run GOP governors. 

8 top 10. ""Our canidiate sucks vote anyway"" 

That's Trump election even want. specialty normally medicine personally best answers, know frees areas lung may collapsed

From quick google offers layperson's explanation depth, technical analysis look [this Quite easy actually. daily case counts 1/10 Texas right Omg I‚Äôm fucking Georgia everyone goes PCB... last week social media feeds full people there. I‚Äôm scared metro Atlanta blow up. I‚Äôm PA we‚Äôve taken seriously since NY beginning family back Georgia. Washington state here. picked bunch hand sewn masks roadside market. state making fashion statement. 

Plus I‚Äôm happy pay retired nurse part. Harry Potter, New York Yankees, Alladin, Lilo Stitch weekly selection. shit. Masks bandaid point. need hard lockdown starve virus also mandating mask law. Yeah, easier fly nurses doctors fly hundreds patients Eww, protest blamer... Forget it. nice day Question: Doesn‚Äôt Friday normally backlog cases past week?  wife agree reopening way soon. everyone socially responsible *could* work, kidding. Idiots selfish pricks ruin everyone. America, large assorment both. Best course action treat things like still quarantine. Movie theater open? Great, still going. Restaurants acceptint dine-in? thanks, I'll stick contactless takeout/delivery. Personally think coming nation vaccine becomes readily available. even still antivax morons worry about. terrified lies ahead. going head think illness killed 120K 6 months **widespread lockdowns quarantine efforts** less deadly flu kills 80K bad year **vaccines, lockdowns, quarantines**. Seriously, stop letting people control narrative. shoe fits.. Outside, supposedly private ranch Spicewood. every place started getting things control, downslope peak much slower upslope peak. means given outbreak, half deaths happen peak.

The US set record new cases one day, meaning peak deaths 2 weeks future, absolute earliest. Meaning hit peak yet, current death count virtually guaranteed double (at least!) over.

300,000 dead January sounds like low end possible outcomes. surprise 300,000 people died July January. question allowed travel, happens travel. obviously, there's quite Danes traveling, result ain't appealing.  Holy shit. poor sidelined American exceptional here? countries make people go without healthcare, living wage benefit, countries found ways stunt virus markets tank.

Plus, like Grandma going shopping Macy's next week open. virus caused market tank. lock alone.

This argument false dichotomy. True leadership could taken time lock gave us acted. True leadership could propped vulnerable people instead $500 billion dollar giveaway corporations. True leadership could champion masks. Instead people pretending must choose economic death prosperity. That's true, non American still think right time stage massive protests across country, especially statistics show minority groups affected. Even less 10% total new cases came protests, still many. add sympathizewith cause protesters overall. mid-'80's used feel heart swell pride heard National Anthem. That's power propaganda misinformation. Ahem* Every time since covid started.. totally get that. do. hear people coming from. However know vaccine ready masses. Without people wearing masks distancing going able curb virus. result many many deaths. deaths affect economy. lingering fear getting sick also negative affect economy. know family still won‚Äôt going careful longer. 

I thoroughly believe handling property beginning would better economy shenanigans  Okay?

I wonder Bloomberg wrote stories like BLM protests. Yeah, really think people wanting travel anywhere leave comments like ""I'm going anywhere!"". Knowing minorities always loudest basically internet 101. know people say Gamers racist? people usually speak unless something bad say.

But I'd love link articles, ones I've seen comment sections.

And Facebook groups basically people saying ""remember keep social distance, wash hands, person spread virus"". guy constantly tells people travel, restrictions could necessary domestic travel increases summer. think fans pro international come closer many media reports featuring christ, old you? Got damn today‚Äôs numbers must really bad. Florida‚Äôs almost 9k today, brace yourselves. Probably hitting 45k today. least deserves. we've bubble many years now, rationality market. That's democrat president. amazing see complete 180 stock market news sites elections. see covid lasting years millions dying shithole country point. I'm shocked it. would easy (albeit cowardly) position say, ""I'm letting cities decide.""

Pleasantly surprised right thing. I'm floor manager large caterer Philly. got significant raise bartend huge music venue.

I'm right you, buddy. word catering company venue said, ""Maybe start new year.""

Service industry bloodbath. can't really go back college given crap. Good time go Stone Mountain, folks. People like facts

States worst death toll per capita.

New Jersey Democratic party Governor
New York Democratic party Governor
Connecticut Democratic party Governor
Massachusetts GOP Governor moderate critical Trump &amp; even supported impeachment inquiry. 
Rhode Island Democratic party Governor
D.O.C Democratic party Governor
Louisiana Democratic party Governor
Michigan Democratic party Governor
Illinois Democratic party Governor
Delaware Democratic party Governor

Overwhelmingly Democratic party controlled governments. voted Democratic Party state government. else common? 10 worst places per capita death toll order. 

You can't honestly tell Trump people walking around without masks can't get vote him? Seriously people stop trying make political argument. dumb. feelings care get sick not. Accountability important Trump sure dropped ball comments getting back normal. republicans faults Democrats faults. Stop twisting like is. Trump responsible wearing mask. responsible local government enforcing rules regulations. Stop trying pin him. Wear flipping mask stop making political republicans spreading corona top 10 states Blue would they? Yeah, alarm unREPUBLICAN meant.  modeling showing exhaust hospital capacity week half rate (July 6) alarming? Whatever. going happen not. hope everyone Houston two brain cells cautious possibly today, catching seems like very, very, extra bad idea.   Maybe. Given current state country (basically shit show nobody believes better 4 years ago), literally zero chance Trump re-elected. guess problem isn‚Äôt much beds personnel equipment. They‚Äôd probably fly extra nurses doctors redditors say death rate falling... Check death graph two weeks alive. NYC Metro area 18 million people. Includes parts NJ CT. Americans shockingly stupid. Scary someone pulls card out, call police they're commiting fraud. Fuck this, Houston site largest BLM protests. squarely them. Cringe? sharing experience unforseen pandemic? Sharing quality info held government funds. 

Mind words.  Polls whack always ever get sample population highly dependent ask. sample people based sample get whatever percentage want. People dont like facts here, lost cause honestly. Well, could print money tbh (they already gave one check directly people‚Äôs bank accounts) absolutely aren‚Äôt going go far enough replace real economic productivity. Remember hear comments blaming ‚Äústupid entitled people‚Äù aren‚Äôt factory workers need go plant make money provide food kids. They‚Äôre high schoolers college students enjoying time classroom young white collar professionals think keep working home forever, surely job security never put danger entire sectors economy existing prolonged periods time. works

So must Vietnam zero death? Note figure proportion total cases everyone hospitals, proportion people COVID require hospitalization. majority Americans think matter all. vote. People specialize transmission diseases telling people power reopen people power listening experts.

Do think early reopen? Yeah that's experts say. I'm pathologist whatever. job super cool we‚Äôve working home throughout never pressure come back in. However, past weeks we‚Äôve getting pressured come back now. us kids even issues childcare, we‚Äôre told we‚Äôll go HR process don‚Äôt start coming office full-time August. We‚Äôve making work remotely months now, seems stupid force people back real end threat put us office first place. closed good now, convention would safe later lower testing Lump wanted? K shield hat turn side. easy. Title misleading. 56% people think reopening soon = concerned catching Covid, willing go public places / work. article states later much 65% people willing go haircuts almost 80% willing go jobs (which requires businesses open ay least partial capacity).

Seems like people definitely concerned catching virus, even concerned able go earn money live. what's solution? Miami‚Äôs make serious money, methinks Protests nothing barbecues. Maybe try reading. Damn. That's burn Also simple yes no

Masks people wear them?

Distancing people following it?

My answers unequivocally yes.

What dangerous. People see ""yeah serious worry"" ish message...that people like putting think...well maybe bad. Maybe inflating numbers.

Maybe hoax. people dangerous. 

Hows going bad around (Texas... Florida)...

How's going warm weather seems make go away...

How's going bar patrons one night 42 people staff friends random people caught it? 

How's going families getting charged rediculous hospital bills survived it...we know due labeling lack testing time owe hundreds thousands dollars.

Life scary. deal scary parts come intelligence. hoping saying bad. That's reality. Apple responsibly reclosing al stores Florida Disney pushes ahead reopening. 

This stunning. Absolutely stunning. Bars, gyms, theme parks need close Florida IMMEDIATELY. Disney needs announce delay reopening Disney Word TODAY. 

The new record today literally almost DOUBLE previous record. I‚Äôve many people seemingly go way socially distance sidewalks lately (like point brush I‚Äôm trying decant kid stroller) daycare provider also takes care 85 year old mother, mask going stay firmly days. 100% started like least still find look (wow, 3 year old positive Musk article reaches reddit front page right bad Tesla/SpaceX/Musk news comes out. complete utter coincidence), hard say much astroturfing much real now. I‚Äôm glad wife found cool new tradition! girlfriend something Friday‚Äôs. drink beer oddly got ru Paul‚Äôs drag race that‚Äôs Friday‚Äôs. 

I get ya going out. It‚Äôll worth over. 

Got good beer recommendations? One day gone, like miracle. Trump said so. Reddit, media, absolutely.

In real world, much. Go talk people. want reopen, cautiously.

There‚Äôs real disagreement this. one thought supposed hide basements vaccinated reddit, arguing children. Oh surprise NOT! fuck Texas governor seriously dumb fuck.  Wow.. that‚Äôs pretty bad It‚Äôs hard vigilant parents already complaining mandatory masks. It‚Äôs going real shit show teaching classes 30 seventh graders year new baby home father health issues. May take year point. Meanwhile friend whole family still planning Panama City Beach Florida vacation trip mid-July. 

This going repeat happened Italy back March. Tourists flocked Italy early stage outbreak exported countries. time various states exporting cases vacation-goers Florida. 

This going get ugly guys. It‚Äôs interesting dilemma sure. could leave house private vehicle, drive directly family member‚Äôs home, none exposed people six weeks, 15 minutes doctor‚Äôs office everyone masks, true risk exposure? to? patients still need ICU bed, unless mean move cemetery. easier directly move new patients ICU beds free?

Sorry dumb question. Keep lying yourself. Every hospital America admitting everyone brother recoup losses. I‚Äôve seen admissions problems ranging constipation slight gout past weeks. I‚Äôve ‚Äúfrontlines‚Äù virus 3+ months know seen first hand. Don‚Äôt believe hype goes Lonestar ""There coronavirus here. Look behind me. Disney opening. cruise ship ready embankment. hospitals empty! definitively tell coronavirus tens thousands miles! Come safely spend vacation tax credit here!"" country 600k tests yesterday. new record pretty substantial increase previous record. totally ideologically committed idea government never interfere business never provide anything people. Anything mitigates virus must things. obvious results choosing path worse long run, care, never cede inch.  Fuck you, go live dream alone leave us fuck alone. month ago don‚Äôt think applies anymore, mentioning things changed.

Most videos came across shared r/medicine nearly physicians attending ER physicians California That's scary. Stay strong, Houston! actions taken companies wanting limit liability (or PR speak ""acting protect customers staff"") local municipalities enacting ordinances like saw back March/April. expect ZERO action DeSantis matter bad things get, suspect.

Disney going interesting watch slated open another weeks (the parks - Disney Springs resorts open) they've extremely cautious opening. missing anything. considered cool trendy hate/make fun Americans, Trump's embarrassingly ignorant comments make much easier make whole country look bad. also AMA reddit replied people- get impression loves praise bit attention seeker. COVID see benefit even non-intubated patients. $$ worried authorities criticizing publishing false information? YA THINK? 

FU 44%. Also false. example, service dog users required show anyone ‚Äúproof‚Äù dog service dog (no service dog registry exists), required show proof disabled. Business owners may ask animal service dog may ask ‚Äúfact finding questions‚Äù, as: ‚Äúdo disability dog trained aiding disability?‚Äù need disclose disability know offer statements ‚Äúhe alerts medical crisis‚Äù, ‚Äúhe provides stability walk‚Äù. Never, ever, ever need show proof.

You can‚Äôt tell someone diabetes seizure disorder looking them, yet service dogs huge asset lives.

If service dog jerk, asked leave. right public access well behaved. cannot upvote enough. People need realize severity situation. answer question assume. It'd much easier would answer question whether support Sweden **forcing** parents send children school face harsh punishment? Unless get it. won‚Äôt big deal. That‚Äôs science works. Yes, immediately reopened pubs, wineries etc, removed limits gatherings. idiot Djokovic hosting Adria tournament there, partying indoor nightclubs tennis players, encouraging fans fly in, lots hugging/photo taking etc. Disaster. 

I think Scotland little cautious. Sturgeon channelling Prof Devi Sridhar pro ‚Äòcrunching curve‚Äô elimination. Poll finds 56% polls biased useless. california Wait, trying differentiate two? good around advice honestly. Unfortunately, 44% would ones re-electing president. Considering known since Diamond Princess SARS-CoV-2 found air recirculation systems safe assume possible likely.  youre desperate ""win"" reddit argument  1000 cases day considered ""good""? What's mortality rate age? .01%? Oof. Florida making run Arizona. happened summer heat taking care it? worn mask outside it‚Äôs 70% humidity? 

I‚Äôm betting not. absolutely stop people going outside. 46% complete idiots believed I'd conversations either. still believe I'm them. One biggest questions re-opening local governments would willing admit things might ready close certain things back to. certainly agree way Texas handled things, pleasantly surprised see they're willing something like try soften surge cases. expert recently said take [4-6 weeks introduction spreading big spike seen fact could fit seeing Croatia. Ah cool, referencing state requirements guess. town? imported. Also outbreak monastery small town ƒêakovo (40 cases one day). Well mentioned beaches restaurants, thought protests relevant too. course restaurant way dangerous. 
‚ÄúThe greatest shortcoming human race inability understand exponential function.‚Äù - Al Bartlett Barely half wore masks protests. SF parks beaches also packed every day since quarantine.

Nobody state, red blue, us favors. It‚Äôs impossible government subsidize every citizen business. Thousands businesses across country closing due lockdowns won‚Äôt coming back thoughts. small business (a franchise) that, normal day jobs still able float expenses (which mostly rent smaller expenses, remote/virtual services help income, paying employees first 2 months stay-at-home order). got one-time $5,000 ""stimulus"" money supposed available, little overall functioning expenses business one month much less going 3 months. refused reopen public guidelines laxed since nothing improved gotten worse. keep getting correspondences corporate, based Houston (we live California) fully reopened public yet (mainly corporate operates royalties sales franchise locations, making sales really open). basically keep telling us, ""it's legal, open public now?!"" keep responding with, ""because nothing safer 2 weeks ago, opening public puts us, employees, kid elderly parents risk exposure spreading infection irresponsible unethical open doors public time."" scoff every time conversation. 

Why we, general society reopening? there's money anywhere. There's financial support section population needs most, people confronted poor, homeless, unable feed families risking infection (and result, potentially contracting it, getting sick, getting massive health care bill, case could still turn poor, homeless, unable feed families). 

Because financial support federal level 2 trillion money grab wealthy corporations pittance 80%+ population keeps country alive.

Money matters lives now, people leading communities country made clear would rather people die answer people can't work also can't see families pay rent.

Sorry, general rant, nothing specifically aimed you. ‚Äúnot far away‚Äù mean ‚Äúwhen rest UK gets act together‚Äù. still running rampant England it‚Äôll spread Scotland. shut down, uptick mask wearing clear day. Immediately following city (and county-wide) mandate places go close 100% masked. encouraging. Sometimes humans act unless starts directly effecting them, that's probably seeing now. AZ never one badly hit spots people think much it. hospitals threatened mask mandate came out, people taking seriously. There's still detractors, course, there's plenty hope going forward. read something months ago ""initial viral load"" something effect. idea get it, want start smallest possible amount give body time fight get really sick.

So, start (fake numbers):

1, day 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc

But someone licks eyeball, start 64 starting guy week (and week letting white blood cells fight growing).

That another big part wearing mask. someone sneezes you, might start 8 instead 64 giving 4 days sickness reach spot body gives up. Bad bot hear SoCal too. :( Dr. Marc Boom, head Houston Methodist hospital system, wrote email employees Friday. ‚ÄúShould number new cases grow rapidly, eventually challenge ability treat COVID-19 non-COVID 19 patients.""

OK so, remember, hospital system collapses collapses everyone.

People car accidents.

People need cancer treatment.

Delivering moms.

Parents break bones.

Children battling chronic illnesses like Chrons. that, people die hospitals start spreading thin trying take care patients.  Gentle reminder positive rates meaningless unless it‚Äôs true random sample people concerned happy hour hardly even wrap head around this, florida older populace. death toll politicizing pandemic? DeSantis bigger piece shit Trump. worry, learn soon enough. death tolls pile learn wrong were. I'm thinking about......two weeks still early... mean CDC said every one case identify there‚Äôs likely ten go undiagnosed. US isn‚Äôt necessarily spitting ‚Äúright numbers‚Äù either. Onlying 56%???? explained methodology used get data somewhere (another post I've overlooked perhaps)? Like specific options choosing custom data report, time periods, etc? 

If saying true, major news story, hidden reddit post. though, needs clear got data obvious links alone produce numbers. FYI, I'm trying tear down, I'm trying make sure right become someone repeating random internet info. roommate‚Äôs teenage daughter got back Orlando vacation mom last weekend. supposed come see next day Father‚Äôs Day said Nope, staying apartment (he moved 2 weeks ago) know didn‚Äôt contract asymptomatic. 

This weekend her, I‚Äôm really comfortable coming today, she‚Äôs home one week, can‚Äôt tell again. I‚Äôm terrified. Yup. Instead strict one month nationwide shutdown interrupting economy, fucked economy heading another series localized shutdowns shit long run. hope states mask requirements force towners wear masks socially distance. keep local transmission lower places masks optional. optimistic tri state keep numbers control mask usage. comparing best best, that‚Äôs nation.

Ok, let's take shine countries Western Europe see they're doing, since roughly population US around 320 million:

Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, UK -- total deaths = 144 thousand 

US -- total deaths = 126 thousand Yeah holy shit, wish getting $350 week. Instead I'm getting told go poor man somewhere else. risk obviously negligible point - trusting family members rigorous careful.

My wife already talking Christmas Thanksgiving assuming current situation continues. daughter school, we're going go visit grandma. keep everyone home 2 - 3 weeks before... maybe? Fair enough. Thanks heads up! dick    small town FULL GA/AL/LA tourists, seen single one wear mask social distance. that's okay. Locals either ""it's flu bro"". McDonalds (our ONE fast food joint) 2 employees Wed test positive, closed one night supposedly ""deep clean"". open packed type. 2 cases back May..... 16, I'm 100% positive loads that, local DOH hospital test still traveled close contact.

So come tourists! Waters fine blue beautiful one gives shit sick! /s Nah, Russia hand election again. Christ 2020 shit show see ""Made America"" buy more. Tell uncle that. Discharged, hospitals make habit discharging contagious people ICU.

So necessary Cuomo issue new directive May 10 [only patients tested negative could sent nursing homes?

The hospitals discharging recovering patients. Recovering necessarily mean cured, COVID patients ICU patients. Aged like Yes, true, rare instances clothing jewlelry sold unmanned boutiques (though seen some). 

But one saying food producers ones stuck Gotland due seasonality so... 

Anywya, point lady article probably wrong *literally* every single person Gotland stuck summer. definitely watching states! timeline TX 1st week July districts. education agency pulled back announcing final recommendations, supposed released week. understanding going basically leave districts, different they‚Äôve handled everything else...Be super vague can‚Äôt get sued/fired later. Dear Don,

&amp;#x200B;

I need another Stim check.

&amp;#x200B;

thanks. Texas pretty much wide open almost month. still hasn‚Äôt mandated face masks Next time see guaranteed ICU... theory, literally every person could stay home 3 weeks, virus would run course anyone contracted it., we'd less done someone eats bat again. Obviously that's realistic number reasons, makes sense try get close possible. people hate ""big government"" appeal convenient close! Almost got it. would that? like Tegnell friend Glieke. expert, US pretty big place. states faired well and/or reacted well ahead federal guidelines. states extremely unfortunate and/or dragged feet even basic precautions. 

In words, parts US terrible. much better. Judging country whole taking average extremely wide sample. 

With large population, covering whole country, variety infection density response measures, would expect see *average* land somewhere middle.

Whether ""middle"" represents particular region (assuming live states) indicated. Especially live either extreme end bell curve. think weather issue either. Miami folks live cycle central air conditioning. basically experience weather walking also air conditioned cars. good news curve flat. bad news vertical. **ÔºªJune 26th OUTBREAK ALERTÔºΩ** following 10 developed countries states United States reported new confirmed COVID-19 cases far today (will keep updating since countries U.S. states reported) :

Combined outdoor transmission vastly less likely begin with...the Arizona epidemic due indoor lack distancing. Let‚Äôs perfectly clear Florida first reopened, situation much better. 1000 cases per day, testing 1-3% positive. Things looking good.

Worlds 2nd biggest douchebag. get Infection Fatality Risk 1% CDC assume 9 hidden cases every positive clinical test. reverse formula go positive tests expected number deaths first step **multiply positive tests ten**. multiply CDC % go get expected number.

That's math works. flew Tampa last week attitude towards males airport area general ‚Äúwho gives fuck?‚Äù 

I tell redneck bro airport without mask get heels line Jesus christ Americans feel need bringing America every single damn Europe thread age well either. good. since reopening, I‚Äôve seen lots articles people getting infected bars. 
Bars, indoor dining churches. Reporting backlogs Monday Tuesday weekends get bunched up. article trying hide numbers though reopen next week might cases pretending exist. ‚Äúcould‚Äù reality ‚Äúis‚Äù Yea... I‚Äôm weird situation company laying people cutting back across country past year two, I‚Äôve constantly worried losing job. thought sure covid would put street hasn‚Äôt yet miracle. I‚Äôm definitely making less was, specific pay cut, fewer hours less overtime.

I lot amazon fresh, mostly still going hoity toity joint.  open? fuckers even close properly? dont think did. understand anybody went school would want wear masks. external factors religion politics contort years rational understanding imbued schools. 

I live Massachusetts people wear masks. went laundromat couple doors block day. wearing mask people passing even frowned me. took week get appointment. went Wednesday morning still waiting results. Seems results take 2-3 days get infected what's point? Even earlier federal guberment listened intel clear understand logic. I'll correct logic leave since conversation pointless without firm understanding logic. 

""There alternative save planet I'm afraid."" 
What referring here? Tesla. 
What Tesla? electric car. 
Why would Tesla save planet? reduces consumption gasoline causes greenhouse gas.
How save planet? consumers purchase Tesla.

So fact say average consumer issue claiming alternative save planet. 

As FYI never interested buying Tesla reduce gasoline consumption. thought cool cars. already, start stocking toilet paper discharges number (250) high enough account that. Unless seeing lag discharge reporting. Florida can't make minds serious virus. One week maskless pool party, next fines dressing like Batman public. Sorry, far even soft lockdown much less degree lockdown needed put raging inferno currently burning Florida. market honestly would cool millions people dead lol. Dumb question apologize advance. see many stories people temperatures checked allowed workplaces, etc. fever, good go. really valid? Can't sick Coronavirus without fever yet? temperature check giving false sense security? fairness OP said common cold virus coronavirus, influenza. still correct statement common cold caused diverse array RNA viruses number different families viruses, however coronaviruses part mix completely incorrect. almost 9000 ! Wtf big widespread now. one thing 100 cases go check places people might made contact with, talk people see might made contact last 14 - X days.

Now try 40,000 people day. discover limited clusters, enough contain virus point. glad Harris County issued mask ordinance. grocery stores full mask wearers. Took 45 minutes go 2 miles front beach road Sheriffs elected protect people. want enforce something necessary masks right now, failing job. Plain simple. Maybe truth saying... Hmm maybe data isn‚Äôt accurate looks bad!? Wow. favorite people (who understand percentages) posting ""But rate deaths down!!!"" Well, yes, percentages may fall compared overall population mean hospitals overloaded considering extreme measures. would really love see data *actual fact* Sweden's travel habits are.

But besides point Croatia: know article *workers* responsible. probably *workers* going Sweden Croatia. there's one exported infection, chances high more. ‚ÄúHasley Beshears, Secretary Department Business Professional Regulation, announced tweet effective immediately, department would suspending consumption alcohol bars statewide.‚Äù Ground Hog Day Virus... US really fucked shit hardcore. believe someone awesome Obama could guided us outcome like Europe since culture different, jesus christ Trump fucked hardcore. announced he's trying totally end Obamacare... people country goddamned idiots. Tough love honey. 0.5-1% estimating based true infection rate, CDC estimates much 10x higher confirmed right now. deaths compared estimated are. 2.2% based South Korea‚Äôs estimations mortality rate. 

We won‚Äôt know real mortality rate probably four five years. far action ban on-premise consumption alcohol bars (not restaurants), going much slow spread. Props US posting true numbers. keeps trending now* (where governor nothing stop it). yes. supposedly public statement aired 3 pm today. interested going try spin this. ""The risk average American remains low."" forward looking, looking forward next step most. Long term planning American's strong suit. people get numbers? one asked opinion.... Hopefully. YouTube Facebook &amp; others already becoming offer less freedom &amp; censoring people‚Äôs accounts/deleting stuff disagree don‚Äôt like. lenient others that‚Äôs beginning &amp; get works information could still skewed.

Also since Trump seems masks costs, wearing mask would signal Team Trump friends neighbours God forbid wear mask go out, look like damn liberal. Oh, I‚Äôm meaning suggest recent exponential rise SOLELY due ‚ÄúEscaping NY,‚Äù think it‚Äôs another mitigating factor I've seen addressed. know ‚Äúessential worker‚Äù friends aim Florida regaled otherwise uncorroborated stories fighting New Yorkers days immediately following northern lockdown.

Fingers crossed mainly young people incredibly low risk. bit Netherlands.

We also LITERALLY ran beds send people German ICUs, kindly accepted. friends /r/lockdownscepticism still worried. calling people care stupid wrong

I disagree. Plenty people care eating restaurants high risk areas country, wearing masks, calling COVID hoax, threatening town councils citizens arrest put mask orders place, sending death threats governors trying protect state's population, accusing bill gates devil worship, burning 5G towers.

Those things people care deeply, dumbest shit I've ever seen.

While prioritizing entertainment quite level stupidity, trading lives boredom. Considering level entertainment we've known past handful decades even conceivable vast majority humans ever lived, we're clearly require evolutionary sense. would even venture say locked person 2020 entertainment handy completely free person 1913.

So we're back plain old boredom. boredom suck? Yes. worth killing people over? No.

An average NFL team travels 135 200 people travels average every week (one way). assume support staff proportional player count, MLB travel 65 100 away game average every 2.3 days (they always travel home another away game like NFL though). MLB normal season could accumulate 65-100 million man-miles travelled.

That's large roving band well travelled people subsisting solely restaurants room service away. Interacting locals, unknowingly catching disease city one, 2 days later spreading city two. closely interacting (more relevant NBA NFL MLB) another large, well travelled roaming band people heavily breathing.

The amount miles teams put short order literally ""how spread often asymptomatic respiratory virus-101"".

But that's fine, bored. would much fun refusing service saying ""I guess go ahead call number report then.""  one looking forward scrapping ensue whole world needs vaccine that's short supply. Here's hoping scale production quickly gonna get ugly, think. Certainly explains stalking me, totally butthurt.

I've bring quote many fucking times year... country live in....he's conceeded egotistical asshat he's going bs...he much invested country's success. makes say that? honestly think expected would zero positives? That's they're taking precautions are. would one watch it? wealthy go wherever want care, resources means mobility. Poland police stopped interventions make people angry ruling party one candidates (who currently president, could next term).

They let people almost everything totally ignore - irritate voters.

I live dumb country. That‚Äôs true. Enforcement responsibility local plenty big cities enforcing plenty businesses following orders/recommendations. Protests pandemic mistake. But, but, but... None would happening much testing. Fingers ears means talking, too. I'd say since billionaires near much charitable work him.

True, fact reminds activities riskier others, people want activities carry risks order satisfy agenda/ego. one cleans anything kitchen closing time, one wears gloves, one sanatizes. dont even sani buckets! take temps people coming work like twice week. according facebook straight concerned n going way maintain clean kitchen

They're trying hold last little voter base. might fitting r/maybemaybemaybe later. see  think closing bars reducing restaurants 50% save Texas. ChAdOx based virus they've already working while. Moreover, they've working technology get mRNA vaccine work years. candidates based coronavirus vaccines developed never tested utilized one reason another.

Further, something never happened mean can't won't--when AIDS first came about, one believed would way people HIV AIDS live decades post-diagnosis.  even spring break? back march april? cannot escape God.

Every medical professional know told two weeks ago cases would spike drastically due protests...and did.

Yet CNN keeps reporting due young spring breakers young partiers (notice blame young people).

A lot factors contributed, doubt millions people shoulder shoulder streets yelling chanting contributed immensely. Underlying conditions include diabetes obesity, together already like half US population. Way 1 20 higher risk. Maybe, treatment covid19 gotten much, much better last 2 months bringing mortality down.  number new cases misleading. testing, think is, cases found. needs looked percent tests positive, hospitalizations rising. Number ICU cases also relevant, better treatments, bit misleading.  Number daily deaths lagging indicator. Well somebody smart better figure something out, federal government better fund it. hold breath. Nearly thousand people dying every single day USA, number rise coming weeks. already baked cake honestly, there's preventing dramatic increase deaths coming weeks.

And Disney Springs (a disney shopping area that's mainly stores restaurants) currently open believe resorts/hotels opened week well.

So yea, Disney gonna close World unless told legit opened resorts able reserve park days. 

But Universal Studios Sea World Orlanso open operating (at reduced capacity) month, so....yea. suggesting said problem him, apologies came off. issue is, voters chance know guy elected him. character him.

Okay confirmed positive Friday last week. symptoms like 99% gone (I like ever slight cough happens like every hour I‚Äôm gagging lungs up), haven‚Äôt fever since last Saturday, I‚Äôve self-quarantined since last Tuesday (10 days). contagious anymore? CDC website literally says ‚Äústay home 10 days since symptoms arose, fever 72 consecutive hours, &amp; symptoms improved‚Äù

#NO failed country. craziest thing said essentially asymptomatic spread driving epidemic. January said ""no epidemic history driven asymptomatic spread."" big strength virus. Yeah, *right* wanna drive drunk endanger others cause fun *me*  mean yeah, NYC's one thing. lot places much going outside tourism. that's true. data we're seeing significant percent EVERYONE infected, even never show symptoms, permanent significant health complications, including brain damage. range we've seen 25-40%.

The article cited say this. article does?

&amp;#x200B;

And CFR California taken California's public health Covid 19 seem kind person wants people research them, numbers people 50.

127,996 cases

344 deaths.

.26%

Again, that's known cases. real number cases absolutely much higher. diagnosed probably C19 worked home couple weeks, someone approach fact stated C19 thing joke/hoax.  stated probable case quarantino.  offered hug, gave dirtiest look back away because, paraphrase quote bit, ‚Äúhe didn‚Äôt want risk it.‚Äù

Stupid people stupid thrust face, show scared cowards lack ability think logically.

Oddly, haven‚Äôt heard speaking C19 hoax since then.

Don‚Äôt get wrong, think quarantine wrong pretty much everywhere, doesn‚Äôt change facts. C19 real, killing people. even work grocery store. Google Maps timeline single dot. even send usual monthly email April. cut education funding purposefully. Easier control idiots. terrifying. Texas enough public health inspectors per capita keep everyone toes something? Everything else open, enough inspectors enforcing cleaning procedures....  think that's stupid move. Remember, due population, size federalism, US closer like European Union big country like China. Every state different regulations standards federal response could, theory, best alternative. However, agree way handled absolutely fumbled. continuing distract project pandemic, government caused lot states lag behind suffer strong effects. Shit like Florida Texas perfect examples it. Even face healthcare overload, measures still way relaxed compared countries. mean, live fairly unstable 3rd world country still easily 95% people wear masks fuss.  No. hell man. TOLD would happen. opened anyways. POS wheels. spelled mentally ill wrong [Edit] claim CDC nonsensical point forget exists. mortality America point surely around 1%. NYC indicates 1.4%, 0.26% obviously impossible entire city died, elsewhere hopefully better. question Harris County, US.

The CDC says 10x testing, 27k positives around 5%. That's upper bound almost certainly much, much lower. bet would 100-150k people Harris County (population 4.9 million) currently it.

Texas almost certainly undercounting deaths half so, using 0.5% number tested deaths could work. number would accurate three weeks ago today's dead infected.

Edit: misunderstand math; reddit good long expressions. certainly hope someday soon get mortality around 0.26%. propaganda number CDC made April backing whatsoever. Donald speak there! See say.   doesn‚Äôt crystal ball. scientist does. tell America wear mask. don‚Äôt think expected America noncompliant. Fact. massive push vaccine breaks odds regulation place recipe disaster. looking vaccine granted phase 2/3 trials expedite process hopes phase 4 market principles massive populations. never done really gray area current edge technology.

It's established non nationals right enter. second highest increase cases Brazil country world   Look Bay Area - big protests SF, Oak, SJ (and smaller suburbs like WC) there's big spike. CFR California taken California's public health Covid 19 Since seem kind person wants people research them, numbers people 127,996 344 Again, that's known cases. real number cases absolutely much higher.

The average death 28 days infection. CFR case fatality rate, derived closed cases. Someone hospital survivor, fatality, open case. 

You derive CFR including open cases, one many oft-repeated lapses that's occurring. want try rough estimate it, look current death count, hospitilzation numbers 28 days ago, presume deaths happened yesterday likely cases added 28 days ago. 

In summation, CFR calculation include open cases, closed cases. That's called Case Fatality Rate, open case survivor fatality, listed ""open case"". Try living Miami everyone know partying every weekend like there‚Äôs nothing going on. Many.

Coronavirus could far deadlier, could affected children disproportionately, could mutated deadlier straisn last 3 months, exponential growth cases could continued March treatment options good fatality rates considerably higher, etc.

Lots people still wearing masks gyms though required entirely understandable responsible.

We really shouldve waited reopen things, think thats biggest mistake. shouldve kept people afloat stimulus checks. Im disappointed looking like things shut again. Ive heard may even flu like, may never go away even vaccine.

Whats dude run hospital. know contingency plans. Perhaps hospitalized patients good prognosis go home sooner. Thursday, four CEOs signed letter backed off, saying give shit Texans live die.

FTFY alarming? I'm tired listening WHO. They're either bunch headless chickens willfully obfuscatory. can't figure which. 

Suppression strategies succeed delaying outbreak, long control measures sustained. controls eased restricted, epidemic continue. That's pretty fucking obvious. *We already knew that.* 

No-one expecting Covid suddenly dissapear, - playing panicsphere come statements like accelerated ""resurgence left unchecked push health systems brink Europe."" 

First off, countries health systems pushed brink - strained best many left waiting tsunami never happened. Look UK's Nightingale Hospitals prime example, German hospitals shipping patients countries. Yes, *some* pushed brink, *most* weren't. 

Secondly, much better prepared better treatment methods stopped using ventilators kill people. 

Thirdly, know better send Covid patients back nursing homes. Yeah, pretty fucking stupid. 

And finally, virus left 'unchecked'. fucking well aware appropriate measures taken - time round measures appropriate level danger virus represents. Hand washing, mass gatherings - things normal appropriate responses epidemics. 

There deaths, anywhere near number deaths first said would be. Countries need re-open, people need get back running businesses back work earning money, kids need get back education people need start semblence life again. Yeah, lockdowns fun many - like holiday home, also extremely destructive many ways longer continue, longer lasting damages be. time get back living. Let's that, better job protecting vunerable stop trying induce stupid levels panic every available opportunity. Lol spotted Australian even know second wave. Uh huh yeah sure cover tracks

Everyone knows what‚Äôs I‚Äôm even going entertain anymore it‚Äôs obvious anyone reading.

Mission failed. means shitty people charge, leading, constitutes lack leadership. Waluigi? Translation: doctors, nurses, teachers; they‚Äôre dispensable. expect sacrifice lives, complain either. Soon 100% covid true, again. Though good bad decisions sides occur, pretty much every single good one comes younger people. freaking wish easy. paracetamol? deal. Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Japan, etc.


Show outbreaks. 

Literally EVERY nation done case studies concluded kids rarely infectious. Netherlands must dropped new one saying opening schools would cause issues.

Most European nations opened schools May. Denmark opened schools mid April. 

Iceland Eastern European nations NEVER closed then. 

Norway even said closing mistake.

So take BS misinformaiton somewhere else. Morons don‚Äôt use argument comparing USA countries? California bias insane Swede goverments approach go lockdown like countries believe economy surthen areas people lived social welfare 20years, single mothers getting kids use daddys get free money, people claiming mental ilnesses get much money staying home day, Swedes not. people rely income without working Corona hit social welfare takers went drasticly areas broke can‚Äôt afford pay money people recently lost part time jobs job long enough still income put streets forced go work even showing signs cold. Nursing homes example infected deaths occoured. People denied social welfare overloaded people seeking right now.. see Swedens approach right wrong, still early stage long time go now. Passage ferrets would prove improve gain-of-function. ACE2 ferret lungs, too. wild misinformed mainstream media watchers are. noticed this, too! picked arbitrary place without looking Zillow. mistake isn‚Äôt point.

Regardless, affordable bay. Wamazon? Dr. Death fascinating podcast! recommend it. yeah sad system didn‚Äôt catch sooner. today get close 39,000 probably get there, unless Los Angeles County shows 1.4K cases next 50 mins imply Houston worse places world? cities medical centers? Rig HT hope trump useless. dangerous person That's false. ICU ratios US usually 2:1 1:1 critical patients. Depends hospital situation things like proned patients paralytics, continuous renal replacement therapy, patient cooled post cardiac arrest 1:1. course pandemic apocalypse normal ratios could get thrown window. I'm ICU RN California 1:1 patients sometimes. work private hospital previously worked county hospital low income area still 1:1. Yes. 

That exactly means. feel absolutely entitled ‚Äúthey‚Äôve working whole life.‚Äù DeSantis going slow anything down. think see \*improvement\* numbers justify moving next stage reopening next week. MONSTERS! No, [that's absolutely shutting entirely and/or reopening early enforcing face masks consequences.

If protests cause, NYC would leading pack again. fact, data supports BLM protest lead spikes covid.

Look states highest infection rates ([in order highest daily infections CA, AZ, GA, NC, AL, SC, MS, LA. correlation protests, due states shutting entirely, leaving beaches open, reopening early, scoffing idea enforcing face mask regulations, really ignoring science. That's we're still Wave 1 seeing time daily infections country.

Most us sub called back April May. we're smug geniuses, we've following news, listening medical experts country, tracking data. I'm sure anyone would listen scientists medical experts pandemic, sadly, are... ""Turns nothing work shits fucked, questions?""  sit room together without masks eat cake! worries spreading virus. Better late never guess.. Or, perhaps, share data uneducated masses get news spoonfed Fox. one become private duty nurse Fair enough, good points. I'm usually pro-union. There's couple I'm against. strongly believe people intelligently involved politics individually well. Trump: ""we stripped government funded testing sites across country cases dropping dramatically starting next month. Nothing worry folks, recovering faster stock market past 2 months."" Actually, pretty sure plenty laws books make responsibility whole lot cases, unless fucking serial killer following life. again, considering blithering sociopathy oozing comments, could sure not, fact, serial killer. sort predator least. They‚Äôre stupid. Well, are. that‚Äôs won‚Äôt wear mask, know full shit. evil, selfish people. Depends much money have. philosophy 100%. can‚Äôt control actions, someone gets sick, won‚Äôt me. That's horrible situation in. way think he's extra person that's around people that's extra chance getting spreading others, top public possibly getting it. took husband grocery store I'd feel like would double chances bringing house. 
Hopefully store decides online learning teacher well may help son struggles most. Good luck. understanding Karen sticks nose belong keeps calling higher powerful person/entity coerce another person get way... misleading, say 100% seems right. matter 100% COVID 0% COVID. people ICU need ICU capacity bad anyone else needing ICU. beds COVID patients accidents, etc. So, change? federal government yes.

The level death lot handle, everybody know least 2 degrees separation away friend family member dying. 

But proves point even - complete lockdown started seeing shit ton cases. even hospitals never reached capacity, told doctor avoid hospital costs would 100% get COVID crowded ER lobbies. Thank goodness nobody family got sort bone fracture/whatever common accident makes us take hospital care granted. sad completely preventable situation. guy's job enforce law. actively tells people follow law, needs removed job.

He already fired. work hick, backwards-ass place would be. can't mix Covid19 patients standard patients. 

This support ""conspiracy"" hospital beds filled money. 

It's standard infection control. Answer number 3 likely. Unless patient specifically diagnosis COVID-19, classifying death pneumonia related symptom keeps death count COVID-19 lower, allowing states claim virus isn‚Äôt dangerous is. Yet Florida today 5,004 cases 44 deaths. 

Deaths lag new cases considerably.

If get 1000 new cases today, lead new number deaths 14-21 days. means 94% country yet still nearly 127K deaths. USA seems like stressful place live. doubt make one blind bit difference. happened NYC converted rooms. main thing makes room ICU room different level staffing. headline misleading. doctor warning catastrophic consequences cases continue increase FL *doesn't* shut down. Agreed - within healthcare, conflict actual healthcare experts providers one side profitseeking executives side constant cross-talking confusionfest without healthcare system, too, second group actively undermining efforts first, explicit opinion ""fuck life interferes money, cares die long estate SPEND!!!!""

I'd say can't believe leadership could dumb profit-driven, honestly, nothing like surprises anymore. know old, go school currently work assistant health clinic. Pretty scary get text boss saying ""Hey I'm sick might coronavirus, think getting home ASAP."" 

I super fortunate kind boss gave much heads-up - home within next week packing up! Would go way insulin corporation. course want get much business possible.

Certainly lying. ICU capacity *immediate* concern. Massachusetts, announced plan reopening k-12 schools today.

Also, rec shops open couple weeks. Second verse, first.

Sure going interested hearing everyone's excuse watching coasts deal exact horrifying nightmare ten weeks ago. Well, yeah, much fact. However, masks social distancing help on. want go on.... weird NYC gave rest USA blueprint still happening. TX ashamed themselves. longer record though, makes think mistake somehow. Unless added TOTAL deaths DAILY deaths. base capacity

Huh. wonder included headline. much reopen push following stupid ideas people weaponized Facebook disinformation Yep. too, pantheon medical procedure I‚Äôve done would place flu swab well kidney bone marrow biopsy. know whenever say ""the economy"", benefit rich living gated communities, Mcmansions ultra wealthy. people would willingly sacrifice 20% country's population keep OPTION gain even wealth. press release cause media panic said capacity issues lying then?

So lying lying now? 

Amazing.   I‚Äôm saying I‚Äôm proud it. I‚Äôm saying life isn‚Äôt idyllic paradise there‚Äôs reason people don‚Äôt pay labor it‚Äôs worth.  say all, certainly big part. Recent events obviously also help. Enormous human medical resources.  I'm sure bigger threat is, Coronavirus administration. unite instead divide. bring men together.  willing watch people suffer side effects watch like selfish coward. People like shouldn‚Äôt even given vaccine all. auto moderator idiot. issued ‚Äúapology upsetting you‚Äù statement told cut elective surgeries, generates income. ü§£üò≠ü§£üòÇ

Hey governor: FUCK ,,l,,(-_o),,l,, Well, NorCal really want opened up, least Bay Area. huge upticks cases demand open primarily SoCal. trouble doctors trained preserve life cost take view often without looking holistic picture. many doctors 1 death many. supposed specialists experts 

I want die, also want spend next 2 years sequestered house never seeing anyone. want work indefinite period can't anything, likely kill coronavirus. Seeing big picture elected leaders supposed do, cannot save every life cost. However seem care. Gj opening early Texas, say 100% certainty informed people knew would happen ( arguing happened best option.... well look what's happening wealthy make money...) sad wealth trumps science every time US. think virus getting less lethal. think time around proportionally younger people, least now. believe learned terms treating catching cases earlier.

I hopeful right new deaths reach 2000+ numbers again.

So technically better situation before, doesnt mean horrific. Seems many desensitized/normalized 500+ deaths day going ok. 

And brings horrible signs true second wave fall. I've never heard podcast! current estimate makes IFR US 0.6% (if count confirmed deaths- probably also undercounted). That‚Äôs pretty much right range everyone saying would months now. generally healthy 26 year old friend mine ended vent 9 days multiple blood clots. spent total 27 days inpatient lasting breathing problems. Feels like catching virus similar playing russian roulette. Well least south Georgia robust, well staffed, well funded healthcar....oh. Oh no, oh fuck. 

You'd think Phoebe Putney would made people pay attention. 

Wishing good luck safety Atlanta. Case point: statement going antibody testing.

The CDC said [antibody testing unreliable give real insights policy pretty strange claim make based sort testing they've said can't really trusted. least written confirmation massacre. agree. great day. He'll always support cult, he's hemorrhaging followers moderates right-leaning. Biden gained nearly 15% poll numbers past month that's anything Biden did. folks care Texas seem unconcerned health, least far pictures tell story I've seen lots photos big outings effort social distance.  sad many people can't basic precautions inaction prevent others getting needed medical care. said briefing COVID even room. either health director. appear perspiring heavy. hit close matter. way lower lol clickbait Hanging best can. can‚Äôt wait get point. already family mad since don‚Äôt want anyone meeting new baby while. past point caring people think. Right try limit news intake focus toddler, husband myself. people lot worse. Thanks asking :) west Texas family stubborn af. Nobody wearing mask, think hoax. Idk y'all believe heart soul imaginary entity sky, refuse science infectious virus. Yall make head hurt. Texas thought sort Abbott Costello reference first. taste? Utah. governor said pretty please wear mask require let cities require discretion. Simple, allow limit one disease state per person. interesting see happens.  Adult sports figures stop practice people testing positive. point I'm gonna load popcorn watch shit show unfold....America filled many dumb fucks unbelievable... job pediatrics shows children infectious. capacity pediatrics done case studies determine spread virus? sequencing virus determine infectious spread.


When start? sure know job?


Also tell literally EVERY study done across multiple continents wrong? Always great see city news amount stupid we‚Äôve thanks governor. *chuckles*
I‚Äôm danger :) Healthcare brought Amazon downvoted idea cases testing frivolously stupid piece propaganda ruling party. Obviously testing account increase we're seeing. numbers speak themselves, especially look hospitalizations deaths. I'm immunocompromised work gym Michigan. heavily hinted boss reopen they're going fire can't come back health. gives peace mind days, eventually work open, I'll end unemployed. üòî  think point right (health care going suffer bars open) imprecision that's killing me! Lol

Mammograms colonoscopies surgeries. still go forward. got point lumpectomies maybe. doctor reclassify surgery urgent click button, least work. fine. Trump said 1 person 18 died. may-may wins internet XD get it. expect happened? ultimate Karen response.  Ok well, dislike Trump much anyone, lying *all* actions ruins credibility.

He Instigated violence, ignore worldwide pandemic, lied straight public's face impeachment. raise taxes.

Taxes one thing actually well vast majority Americans.

He still absolutely needs go though. Stories success always great hear. I'm sure every billionaire many good stories tell got there, even worst like Bezos. Eleon exact same, business ""alternative"" field, making popular reason. went successful engineering big-headed projects believing helping humanity, probably messiah syndrome. succeded business think genius everything. Now, like billionaires, want more, sacrificing people part normal process continue. Let's real, nothing fuckin Mars, Earth full problems solve nobody ever seriously colonize damn rock there, name stars - help people. It‚Äôs ‚Äúshrinkflation.‚Äù worse product price. fatter it‚Äôs fucking hot outside it‚Äôs flat. We‚Äôre statistically insignificant daily cases per Horacio, Quebec‚Äôs public health lead.

Still seems sketchy. Texas ICUs using dexamethasone treatment? Yeah definitely appalling. wonder UK common USA though.

Starting top leadership chain; bad hairstyles.  20/20 hindsight 2020 20/20 Hospitals NY charge $9.00 one Ibuprofen. literally buy 8 bottles plus tax dollar store 45 tablets it. know work healthcare. It‚Äôs insane. So, know caused this, right? add death toll right...right? Umm, elected orange New York one Actual Title per Bing: National nucleic acid detection capacity increased 200% since beginning please submit actual titles? sub rule keep things sane. add note number tests reply. Keeps high clarification, Bing Translation suggests 90 million people tested. 90 million tests title says. China smart run multiple people one test screaning mechanism that's probably says people. Idk. can't read also pointed percent ICU patients treated COVID-19.

FYI I‚Äôm pro lockdown, mask wearing, etc. think hospital capacity concern several states severe spikes.

We takeaway hospital ~30% capacity remaining ICU.

Rather empty ICU overrun massive influx COVID-19 patients, hospital ICU already nearly capacity without COVID-19 patients - something consider throughout US/World. work hospital.

Yes. Absolutely.  people really know internet. father, bless heart, told today read thag scientists said coronavirus virus, bacteria. tried teaching Fake News googling things, blew off. aunts uncles think Snopes ""liberal fake news"" site. Imagine surrounded people like this? likely person actually never heard protecting themselves!! both? Gathering massive crowds influenced current increase infections. continue recycling headline upcoming months. 19128 They‚Äôve taken foot gas, car rolling steep hill, strongly considering thinking starting comittee study would happen gently caressed brakes. person implying sports non-essential ‚Äúevery way‚Äù interpreted meaning non-essential even outside pandemic, that‚Äôs disagree with. 

I don‚Äôt disagree they‚Äôre non-essential moment, things safe absolutely need sports outlet entertainment. prioritize profits lives

Ftfy they're also cutting essential workers' pay, cutting shifts overworks people shifts, always enough keep safe, likely union getting at. get point, that‚Äôs science works. don‚Äôt think NYC reached 100% capacity

We definitely did. work private hospital midtown even 100% capacity. one point 930 1100 patient beds occupied Covid-19 patients. remaining regular patients. GOP *Surprise Pikachu face*  ""And going hill."" sounds little preposterous. helpful, cure like antibiotics -- latest research (which still published) 10% decrease mortality. That's groundbreaking. People forget happen NJ people wear masks inside retail stores etc it‚Äôs required. people right. mind boggling things see daily basis however:

-People don‚Äôt cover nose, mouth (a favorite mean mine right equates walking around dick out) 

-People take mask absolute second step outside store...while others aren‚Äôt putting there‚Äôs second walk in. 

-I know one technically allowed since restaurants permitted open outdoor dining. Nevertheless, go Applebee‚Äôs sit, mask off, chomping food surrounded tables ‚Äòat distance‚Äô you‚Äôre still greatly increasing risk. Can‚Äôt folks eat home like 6 months? don‚Äôt know. best thing right family.

I'm sorry people understanding concerns importantly respecting boundaries.

Our Mommy's Group hospital encouraging Expecting Diaries heirlooms encouraging mommy's use magazines make collages pregnancies.

It helps people balance... know... this... future behind us.

They tell mommies write adventures families allow tell child everything want child.

I've gotten much positive feedback group. meet remotely online.

I'm sorry reply long. hope family stay safe. MURRICA kidding Well it‚Äôs glamorous anything. poor disabled already. make judgment call fall comes. Good luck! TItle: ICU full. 

Commenter: ICU full. 

You: Obviously ICU full, read quote: ""the ICU full"".

Other commenters: said ICU full. 

You: Spoon feeding google means actually article says alarmed win. There's comparison COVID COVID now, terms load system. Colorado, place I've seen that's run numbers, median length stay hospital COVID patient 6 days, dropping fast. majority people hospitalized first days new big outbreak already replaced others, cases couple times over.  Great! Looking forward first post. Hopefully take photos sly. One trick make look like selfie camera on.  joke, would charge hundred pill, hundred doctor give you. one ""previously thought"" otherwise doctors nurses point don‚Äôt want people die watch without family. virus wouldn‚Äôt spread fast States individual people would care fellow man wear masks public wash hands frequently. Businesses need abide guidelines. States opening mandating masks what‚Äôs causing surge cases healthcare workers families placed risk along individuals hospital appointments giving birth ER. lot hospitals mothers labor go emergency room doors 9:00 PM. Would people still walk around like wasn‚Äôt Pandemic Ebola circulating states? don‚Äôt think so, yet think people oblivious think me, won‚Äôt catch anything. true. Look NY California. yeah went target day south san francisco. surprised limiting people. went business usual. however 100% masks. probably wont again. failing read 28% ICU COVID cases. Yep it‚Äôs Texas hospitals 100% way move away fossil fuels Agreed, already loved state increases that. Granted portion people county could use extra education. still mind county much. see somebody murdering you, intervene. There's law says give heimlich choking. 

You staying alive literally responsibility; is, responsible death... sick virus kills like 0.5% people might kill you, time ask one staying inside. someone watching Toronto, Canada, shocking. cannot gather groups 10, that's overwhelmed hospitals time, province lockdown weeks, social distancing effect everywhere, masks yet mandatory, may end so. takes simple things slow things way down. knew 1918: [5 lessons social distancing 1918 Spanish flu understand, many elements play, making things worse? seems like got bad government one side, fact coherent federal response everyone confused, surreal politicization mask wearing (really...this strange me), right wing news outlets talking insane shit 24 hours day, fairly large fringe selfish people care, gone way deep end think fake.

From here, seems like half country gaslit years years, nobody knows believe now. full swing. going real challenge come back this, whether grieving families, massive unemployment that's going decades come, reconciling nation, reconciling awful treatment BIPOC others, finding way stamp Trumpism philosophical ideologies affect things much discreetly.

I hope wonderful country come mess. going transform something unfamiliar, hopefully one build better direction avoid kind moments again. went daily bike ride (with mask always). Used half people saw wore them. Today: Almost everyone. NorCal. lowered taxes most, sunset period tax cuts average person taxes rich permanent. deficits produced cutting taxes rich used try cut services poor. 

And that's even taking account actually raised taxes people states loyal him, getting rid state deductions federal tax. stupidly determined testing make coronavirus cases go up

I'm really starting wonder mental capacity diminishing. matter feel guy; think everyone would admit made sense seemed ""sharper"" 3+ years ago. 

Maybe I'm wrong hole; seems less ""aware"" was. matter? Tens thousands hospitalized, many suffering long term consequences, enough extremely concerned.

And, answer question, deaths rising FL. expect continue rise. Yes. told us come back starting May 1. go request personal leave, come leave cancelled. randomly denied unpaid personal leave Jon abandonment noticed went out. said doctor note required personal leave, change policy. 4 weeks leave max. +2 week extension note, get randomly denied May 1. 

And would hang say call back later. Took hundreds calls weeks stress get leave approved. 6 weeks quit go back. situation look like December? Especially US? safe travel then? Yeah kind hoping Newsom would reinstate restrictions. People stupid shit. Exactly. evidently people expect stop death period. fun scientific impossibility. Guess plan hiding inside rest lives die. fine since I'm pretty sure that's way we're ever getting rid relentless fear nonsense crowd. world needs move on. Leave petrified loons rot inside homes. No, look mirror. want bad? think lot going hard time coming terms month. That‚Äôs largest medical center world surrounding areas also beds. Let sink in. 

I left Houston last week worked icu med center it‚Äôs getting really bad I‚Äôm critical care, mainly cardiac side PICU. nice night top comment Speaking one states run listened experts (Illinois) I'm pretty sure cities area canceled fireworks. I'm suburb Chicago, fairly populated area.




I'm sure people still get together parties least encouraged.




From sample size family friends, parties, outside distance. shouldn‚Äôt really drink sewage pre covid, unless boil Hi there. 

my BF going Phoenix, AZ weekend. concerned health, upon return? 16% according release yesterday. looks like ""TMC horrendously low number ICU beds"" ""covid causing ICUs hit capacity.""

Edit: TMC apparently ~1,500 ICU beds population 7mil Houston metro. find, TMC far vast majority beds. comparison, MS 1,500 ICU beds 3mil population. bad... seen crazy community meetings Karens screaming devil masks conspiracy? There‚Äôs them. craziest people always seek loudest megaphone?  stats back up? B H E Better get early best crowd

*taps forehead* everyone get Covid. It‚Äôs flu.   media said people screaming day groups 50,000 nothing Newsom failed Cuomo succeeded? curious looked data. percentage starts falling fast 65 YO. roughly 18% obese 80, compared roughly 31% late 50's. 

[http://www.downeyobesityreport.com/wp-content/uploads//Gallup-chart.gif](http://www.downeyobesityreport.com/wp-content/uploads//Gallup-chart.gif) Im willing bet least 25% NJ got infected C19 Factories sanitized. Factories host millions fans. sure accurate username would've thought?! /s  Take year off. soon exposure one get tested time span impact whether end false negative test (if thing happens)? * 298 million human capital stock like call us now. Like entitled fuck wit wants use government send men guns control movement society? 

I'm calling anything like that. I'm calling individual liberty choice. Europe getting absolutely ravaged disaster zone 2 weeks: LA, add everyone crowding beaches parks, masks. moment someone said COVID spreads less outdoors, whatever patience people went window. imagine going worse certain groups spent last couple weeks pushing message things over, got morons masks change now. told people Except guaranteed immunity, mate.. Yup. Hard come days. don‚Äôt get people worried fall rather than, know, right now. Clearly virus‚Äô recent growth Arizona, Texas, India, etc. means doesn‚Äôt need cold weather spread like seasonal flu does. anything things might improve little temporarily fall outside becomes comfortable.

Plus fall may PPE, testing capacity, knowledge treat virus. hospitals ICU full, 28% people covid. hospital normally runs near full, full. That's bad. That's bad people may quality care would otherwise. virus gathering speed slowing down. week potentially far past 100% mark.  yes. TCH west campus taking Covid patients Ben Taub LBJ, county's hospital, due lack beds. lost job protesting prematurely reopening company's stores Texas. see right. thought idiotic characters like existed tv adaptations cops... guy living breathing muse script writers. Football long canceled forever long ago concussions alone. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

And it‚Äôs people hating themselves, it‚Äôs people hating reckless assholes endanger lives needlessly funzies. sort-by-controversial getting crazier crazier. 

THIS TALING false come said around 28%

When someone asked THINK really? Read first 3 sentences linked percent ICU patients treated COVID-19.

How obviously incredibly blatantly absolutely black white wrong, crowing clever right think are? 

How write obviously completely incapable reading?

THE ICU FULL. talking out. ICU CAPACITY. everyone ICU illness, 28% covid-19, PATIENTS COVID STILL EXIST! No, ‚Äútotally normal capacity‚Äù refers amount ICU beds usually have, amount usually use. ones beyond extra ICU beds add emergency. 

This seems designed make look like things aren‚Äôt big deal (especially since graph goes 2800 maximum surge capacity 2200?! scale also kind fucky- occupancy today 60% absolute highest surge maximum, yet arrow isn‚Äôt even across midpoint chart), fact matter hospitals already strained enough they‚Äôre rationing care cancelling elective surgeries. glad live area that's flipped upside - widespread mask compliance side eye mask (tho ok outside away everyone else, e.g. run middle night something). inject Flinstone vitamins? I'm Houston dispatcher large Ambulance company big Houston market. confirm shit getting insane. wave covid way worse first wave across board. Hospitals inundated beyond belief. Smaller hospitals 25 bed ERs occupancy 96. That's unreal. transport transport trying move patients around discharge home. putting enormous pressure whole system, hospital denies point full shit. Trump celebrating somewhere. No. deal Karen's everyday. Karen's entitled fuck wits think special needs come everyone else's, expect catered matter consequences. That's you. Karen. clearly lacking reading comprehension. 

What copy pasted specified smaller hospitals designated ICU's COVID19 wards. 

The people receiving treatment, wether ""intensive debate"" 

But people bring money hospital. COVID19 patients, smaller hospitals trying keep seperated regular patients. taking analogy logical conclusion, Mr. Updates could keep [about 5 minutes, 300 finally going SPLATTTTT Abbott‚Äôs number, Jenkins. 90% pretty typical. Thanks, blm! Yeah here's real kicker nurse works nursing home well. pandemic made difficulty judge friends love going based actions. whole life meant 20 years pension forever. Meanwhile gens work we're 65 best chances, 47-49 years constantly employed. I'm sorry forget, gen lazy gen? still first wave. 

There second waves US yet. husband works hospital 20 minutes away TMC, Memorial Hermann SE. They‚Äôve send L&amp;D patients away make another Covid ward. ventilators says it‚Äôs getting worse day. said they‚Äôre running space treat people hallways. setting field hospitals around Houston caught flat footed, speak? hate America Yup, thought comment like would one ppl connected with. Yeah, US rely tourism entire economy impacts coronavirus hotspot going effect decisions 95% international travelers. tourist economies europe still accepting visitors 95% globe. so, brother law's co worker might covid (he said ""wasn't feeling well"" according brother law show symptoms work). he's going find results monday. anyways, dont know guy chances getting exposed since brother law works guy I've staying house? He's probably fuckin sick virus  August, fact trials go manufacturing goes solid clue still solid belief good one. There's smirk emoji. üòè  think base pissed off, becasuse alot probally reliy health care right now. losing heath care right times, going turn bunch him. know say, ""Well, coming"", mean vindictive. Agree. think couple scientific subs got canned. late taking back seat one. Didn‚Äôt hear? It‚Äôs election year I'm sorry. helps family making sure get outside hour two every day. Also, working hobbies time previously, learning new things, sometimes together. I'm tv editor one thing transfer families old home movies digital could edit share other.

Also, I'm try limit time phone least work reducing it, cause skyrocketed since lockdown. That's helped feel less anxious.

But honestly, NJ's curve resembles European countries. NY, PA, IL, CT, (others well), thing believe keep continued mask wearing distancing public environments, indoors outdoors. 

If looking get out, ask someone circle friends there's spot tables appropriately distanced, get beach early morning concerned crowds... definitely give something try, experience now, activities feel safe. Oh man, I‚Äôm gonna need shirt won‚Äôt years come.  incredulous. wonder argument can't really blown apart science. ""...we're gonna trust people make good decisions.""

-famous last words I've following closely since February. data far indicated kids extremely low risk C-19. always odd exception, risks miniscule. doubt this, send kids back school, case. 

If C-19 transmitted kids back adults, even better - personally, I'm worried it, I've wary contact grandparents - 70s - higher risk category, though good health, high risk dying contract virus. 

Either way, like see get ill. pretty nasty virus recover from. Though, stopped seeing kids. them, risk worth taking I'm going argue that. need people die get economy going. considered investing funeral homes crematoriums? higher long term medical conditions might end needing hospitalization initially.

Do statistics indicting common may be? Noon today official closedown; don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre allowing bars open every day till noon  Anytime ‚Äú40-60%‚Äù America feels way, it‚Äôs political. story checks out

I read online new york times article found top page subreddit. see NY times since deleted article cannot find anymore.  know multiple sources Trump administration actively briefed pandemic response strategy part transition Obama Trump.  Trump administration tossed away dissolved NSC's global pandemic response team real good reason.  whole administration needs brought charges murder possibly war crimes. Touche. ""100% hospital capacity""

Numbers statistics, people start grokking car crash heart attack death sentence ambulance nowhere go, they'll ""shelter place"" own. Norway study entire country 100 cases day fear millions already turn Fall nuclear chain reaction cause actual deaths skyrocket new influx hits we‚Äôre already beyond max hospital capacity. hope I‚Äôm wrong.   Okay cases increasing. difference make given vast majority people zero symptoms? burden proof man. Go ahead cite claim made. Weekend usually light, big one Monday. biggest brains office Ron desantis polls make question presidental polls know kind people poll. seem poll mostly moderate people. see way people without masks either polls looking right sample population people lying responses. least factorial growth. understand virus lol isn‚Äôt enough test. National guard came fianc√© works today test people. Guess what?!! 15 dam test didn‚Äôt test one resident. Instead tested hire people office day. whole ordeal bullshit, it‚Äôs gonna take country going flames make idiots understand I'm sorry came across way really wasnt intention right concentrate HIV comparison. Truelly sorry that. Saw many die trigger need work ok that.c

I taking seriously, usually see people try compare Covid flu Aids taking seriously. also strongly believe research shutdown saved millions people worldwide. nessacry temporary evil open quickly smack face actually stuck guidelines. 

You also giving good view side argument mine sincerely thank continuing engage me. also thanks politely pointing thought going mean territory  Imagine 3 months ago. whole country. many lives could saved death post-infection complications. understanding virus works. presumed ‚Äúgone‚Äù ‚Äúunder control‚Äù cases declining? zero infections mean virus gone hosts? someone explain like I‚Äôm 5 years old it‚Äôs safe places reopening returning normal? I‚Äôm sarcastic; truly don‚Äôt understand. Doesn‚Äôt take one person infections increase again? America lockdown? fuck? remember scene parks n rec Werent bunch emergency field hospitals never used? That's price pay awesome tubin' parties. company working home since beginning March, included. I‚Äôm fortunate go building 100‚Äôs people. talking bringing people back second week July. 10% building would staffed. 30/40 people could building. saving spots people technical difficulties home come in. said that‚Äôs happening set new date anyone come back. Frisco, TX agree you. wish they'd release plans us COULD begin planning make year better last. Waiting last minute going mean flying seat pants. Also time passes testing increases identifying less severe (and younger) cases. 

No one believes fatality rate anywhere near 5%. Current estimates somewhere .25% 1.25% based estimates detecting 10% infections. He‚Äôs managed absolutely nothing making look like he‚Äôs something. Yeah. Unlike states, right revolution actually Texas constitution. People dying bad. End story. good thing mask mandate California. us shit stop it‚Äôs gonna complete shit show second wave even happens. Next 4th July also local movie theaters opened up..... guess US really gone stupid  get outbreaks hospitals. Then, feared. America indeed ruined. ""It is"" pretty cheap cop reality. America systemic problems. One societal divisions. Another scientific literacy. third politics. fourth would social conventions. list endless. Sure, many countries similar problems. problems put delicate, precarious situation America Americans have. Explaining must choice everything speaks ignorance great oversight land free - anything actual understanding liberty. would need heavy proof support argument. worked field decade tell isn‚Äôt possible do, even would find people willingly able pandemic. find 1 35,000+ people defend argument? counter data. 

You saying enough data, base opinion data, - understand intellectually bankrupt is?

We research SARS, SARS. relevant. SARS another ""nasty coronavirus"", facing now. 

The closest thing Cov-SARS-2 Cov-SARS-1, that's complicated. thing human body, main difference being, new strain infects lungs one. 

How daft ignore facts like, absolutely counter case studies. NONE. 

Sorry news making wet bed, leave feelings therapist, we're sharing available data research find right answers, terrifying may be. That's science works, like it, stay facebook C00697516 here! part! finished Case Investigator training! testing means cases detected implies mechanical rise hospitalization rates vs enough testing people dying unreported home.

Reported numbers severely skewed wrong around globe reasoning based numbers leads crooked conclusions.  Although worth noting many factors authors propose may explain reasons steep continual decline death rate hospital patients COVID-19 unknown explored.¬† Potential reasons could include:  patients recovered COVID-19 could discharged care homes places recent weeks become available. would not, however, explain decline started 9 April 2020.  COVID-19 late March early April included significant proportion patients caught infection hospital. patients, hospital, likely sicker vulnerable patients acquired infection community likely die COVID-19.¬† patients community-acquired infections became greater proportion patients hospital hospital death rate fell.¬† However, would explain death rate fallen continually approximately 8 weeks signs decline yet plateaued.  become skilled adept treating patients COVID-19.  overtime admitted becoming younger fewer comorbidities, although evidence daily hospital death data which, anything, suggests greater proportion deaths hospital age 60 peak deaths early April.  entering hospital less severe disease, could reflection either disease becoming less severe hospitals less concerned unable manage peak infections willing admit patients lower disease severity would admit early April.

&amp;#x200B;

Quite likely combination factors, data necessarily mean chances survival individual improved way. US around 10% ICU true things gets control gonna get really ugly.

That's assuming somehow infected everybody once, instead course year. sure good thing ""the people want revolution!"" We'll get exactly deserve. Well wasn‚Äôt Scotland start got one person China. long coronavirus exists world come back. honestly slow rate increase.

Please link study words ""uncontrollable growth"" I'm even sure USA states 2k-3k cases full quarantine

those rookie numbers. gotta pump up. 

Arizona 3k *per day* Sorry, I‚Äôm confused question. words little scrambled. asking shareholder influence public company? second part - would receive money - know faster method travel available commercially? team building technology automate contact tracing scale areas security cameras help organizations use existing technology infrastructure identify individuals may exposed known COVID-19 cases.

AMA!  ""A risk isolated you,"" said. ""Because get infected, part, innocently inadvertently, propagating dynamic process pandemic.""

He said majority people getting infected young, warning age group: ""If get infected infect someone else‚Ä¶ ultimately infect someone who's vulnerable.""¬†

Sweden pointed increased testing affecting numbers, agreed, also ‚ÄúHowever, important note proportion positive results among tested remains stable, 12‚Äì13%,‚Äù said. 

 

Why important note?

If rate infection dropping (or even remained same), increase number people tested, would expect percentage positive tests drop - especially reason testing people changed criteria include people seriously ill thus less likely infected.

The way positive rate remain stable testing increased initial infection rate much higher (but hidden lack testing) infection rate increasing well.

Either way, means Swedes much risk people nations whose infection rates initially lower dropping. [Currently \(well, 6/28\) 1.7 make solid argument. Thank good faith contribution discussion. u/undeleteparent Elmhurst Hospital nurse? Journeyman Pictures interview?

Do resuscitate protocols without DNR authorizations. Indoors transmittion 19 times likely outdoor transmittion according Japanese study, mean outdoors zero risk, IIRC report said protests probably result little spread offset people staying home protests. would still keep distance outdoors masked significantly safer trying thing meeting people indoors.

The trash posts website needs get dose reality.  ""1 20 high-risk people"" need hospitalization.

HAHAHAHA, think direct democracy works? fucking losers sub. choice speak, yet keeps opening mouth stuff like comes out. comments precede Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo moving county‚Äôs pandemic status highest threat level, ban gatherings 100 people. judge urging counties follow suit.

You're exponential case growth, seeing 5000 new cases per day locally, still going allow restaurants operate 50% capacity (following in-article link) allow gatherings 100 people? Good Lord. want protect case serious viral illness? *You fucking snowflake.* dunno, please explain NY, Illinois, Minnesota spiking then?

I'm waiting patiently... Seriously don‚Äôt let customers eating guys saliva transfer meat meat constantly eating coming back. Let public know it‚Äôs trust worthy sanitary business. Texas, Florida Arizona would like word Strangely number deaths changed way. 

Does mean cases severe what? Darkseid? pretty expensive stupid. DFW, tons people w/o masks. place people masks local barbershop. jump restaurant bar nobody using masks bartenders/waitresses. know impossible eat/drink mask watching people arriving/leaving see mask use whatsoever. Purged user history. Looking argument. seem really reputable like you‚Äôre sound source. parents go work remote learning? parents working home keep kids attention learning? teachers keep kids focussed? ensure every single kid reliable internet access equipment? 

The issue high school students much younger kids. wife working home son starting Pre-K September. also twin two year olds. would possibly give son attention deserves learn? matter much prep have, never work. theories say avoiding superspreadings enough, need full lockdown. busy things like bars events. Island Facebook feed full same.. I‚Äôm dumbfounded one believe mask going hurt circumstances improve chances staying covid free virus *is* SARS. first SARS SARS-CoV-1, Covid-19 SARS-CoV-2. proper testing tracing isolation newly infected patients, virus shouldn‚Äôt get control - it‚Äôs contained people maintain social distancing, masks hygiene. 

So look NYC - took months get cases slower spread. maintain said above. It‚Äôs true one person restart outbreak quickly get control again. person identified isolated contacts traced isolated, outbreak stay ‚Äúin control.‚Äù

By control mean medical resources aren‚Äôt stretched handle cases found. 

It‚Äôs difficult line walk control economic disaster. need reopen can. Thanks man They're spending tens thousands atm software infrastructure tech resources dude. first thing bank tell need contact merchant, point contact information available anymore traction.

You ask go network find contact information bank traceable transaction. paper trail. No, cause death. Doctors WA New England states first deal new virus US. noticed patients coming sick requiring higher higher amounts oxygen flow nasal cannula. Despite going oxygen delayed inevitable patients still needed vents anyway. always better put someone vent controlled fashion staff equipment ready rush emergency situation could dangerous patient put heart risk.

Now doctors options death rates bad. Definitely. Defunding 7 sites Texas super helpful.

Felt knew looking for. fit bill, perfectly. hard people wearing mask? Sorry little touch here, Ron DeSantis - playable character Grand Theft Auto 5? wonder whether, point, wouldn‚Äôt make sort sense simply expand trials vaccines dose many volunteers hotspot areas Florida Texas possible.

It‚Äôs either certainly many tens thousands die vs chance vaccine work many lives saved. Hail Mary move, Hail Mary situation Way little way late. Texas proper fucked. I'm Ohio, local T-Mobile store excellent. 4 time, mask entry. line virtual calling list turn. Maybe change companies possible? Thank answering! someone test positive, way analyze true false positive? read patients never develop enough neutralizing antibodies detected, people still test positive non-neutralizing antibodies? Really appreciate answering! Sorry bug you, high quality information knowledgeable person hard come days. Shaggy Scooby-Doo write that? good portion country listening politicians health care. (There‚Äôs statement never thought see) Omg real life - feel florida work nurse ICU Phoenix hospital. filling COVID sure. opening additional units order take COVID patients normal ICU patients people still get shot, heart attacks, strokes, car accidents amidst pandemic. problem there's surge patients coming COVID positive, influx puts stress hospital capacity resources. COVID patients get better one week, patients stay ventilators several weeks. However, say hospital overload due postponing elective surgeries. trying halt surgeries emergent/urgent order make room hospital. Wow, sure put one radar. Except, hope there's explosions bad acting real series. Cut back testing. He's typical rich politician. He's afraid making people mad him. used think bible brutal God constantly pounding stubborn people. one way! hard way! Sounds high. 

That said need remember people taking seriously also mainly staying home. 10% wearing masks time along scattering mask wearers. see out? Mainly masks. poll places require like California? Arkansas I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs half. good day.  literally cannot operate socially distancing, unless want go bankrupt like next week.

You need crew, fuel, maintenance flat cost. fly route 4x day social distancing opposed 1 full flight means 4x cost. 

I would honestly. want get covid, fly. know else say.

Downvote want. truth. like either still truth. Tours Coliseum still closed sure got information that's false. Vatican open need book going maximum 3000 allowed certain time. Masks required EVERYWHERE. 

Source, I'm Rome Coliseum yesterday. Amazing! Push masks. 

We trouble getting masks stick from, data supports it, stronger argument be.  It‚Äôs like, told Yep. thought started reopening two three weeks early, seems probably right unfortunately.

You really think people 30+ responsible going bars restaurants? get polls cereal box? There's several proven instances governors trying lower numbers influence. doubt we're getting full story.

Yes. used think evil geniuses. realize...never attribute malice adequately described incompetence.  Kinda terrifying considering NYC less equation now. Before, could console cases NYC, knowing stats represent whole country makes feel way worse me. Okay I'll concede point, although missed obvious method choosing leader maximum percentage population would approve of.

Which electing person biggest percentages population approves of. people can't even remember happened 2018, let alone 1918.

this problem, listening people listen people smarter them.

always seek people smarter always seek sources always validate information have. 

how know what's true validate? seen enough people wrong things? found often wrong? have, read educate speak informed opinionated.

ps: information there, good job validating sources. Meanwhile, LA acting like cure figured out. forgotten protests missed massive right-wing anti-mask anti-social distancing efforts US entire time? place work still trucking despite fact 3 positive cases waiting tests come back. 200 employees, could infected other. Maybe thinks mini strokes give immunity major ones. Even graph, backdated like Georgia, already looks bad starting two weeks ago election stupid. lie everything. question whether family deaths change extreme level loyalty king? Clearly states slowed spread avoiding large public gatherings, contact tracing, mask wearing, social distancing, hand washing occasional bar restraunt shutdowns. hide bodies change numbers less effort. Lol bit rant like citrus-hazy IPAs well I‚Äôd love recommendations! SoCal helps. Cheers! Maybe not, they'll still around people work restaurants/hotels amenities provided leave bubble every evening go home. I'm sure possible serve someone restaurant maintain six foot distance times.

Oh ask global death rate COVID based census populations. Hmm, I‚Äôm SF people wearing masks even walk dogs (although also think SF faring better bay area counties) Inhale Sahara dust coming way protective coating covid. Coronavirus discernable physical presence instead invisible, would mass protests long BLM protests. almost 2,500 soldiers died one day (today internet search) avoidable war outrage would brought government. global can't defeated covering eyes sticking fingers ears. would help people wore masks though. series, border closed us.

Do refugee processing centers set yet, food, clothing, friendly social worker? might need soon. point, expect DeSantis use executive orders force Disney World open. Good. 4 times Belgium, population hit much harder, close France, Germany, UK Netherlands. that's beginning. also cuomas brother yelling people street. get permanent lung damage please catch Ah, gotcha. people nursing homes hospitals they're sure exposed?

Edit: I'm asking state calling nursing homes ""clear"" COVID people facility still testing positive. knee jerk reaction lie, I'm capable admitting I'm wrong. Occasionally. Mate, listed logic earlier, operated since, like replies according logic yours. want simplified, Case cannot fault Case per logic. Sweden Case 0, thus cannot fault subsequent Case. Again, per logic.

Don't believe me? anyone COIVD sufferer asshole breaking quarantine, rooms visits, say yes. clear.

Here, either ""COIVD sufferer"" Case 0, case say they're fault, they're Case case there's previous ""COIVD sufferer"" fault. know this? think Case fault get previous Case, goes back Case 0.

The way get say Case fault, case Case X fault Case (Because logic makes Case fault Case Edit clarify you.)

Sweden Case 0, Sweden never fault subsequent cases, according argument effectively over. remains realize done here. believe samples processed batches loose seal.   Usually means wearing masm anytime inside that's home outside can't stay 6 feet away.

So walking dog cross street, worries. walking outside urban area, still need one can't avoid people.

Of course specific rule might less strict. can, 99% don't. noticed compared 2009 pandemic, already deaths worldwide estimate many deaths really (only 18k confirmed 500k upper end estimate).

Just people comparing 2009 pandemic. Maybe I'll tracer know, found much scary Randell Flagg stuff. show Florida Felicia. God bat - maybe pangolin.  one thing couldn‚Äôt happen leadership happened, manage crisis. Florida. things US wrong, resistance wearing masks one thing never would‚Äôve predicted would‚Äôve predicted. Makes absolutely sense me. want things go back close normal can? Put mask, it‚Äôll help reduce spread virus. reason become politicized.

There always going conspiracy theories, amount people unwilling wear masks reason unbelievable Sorry, Abbot lost authority lead started issuing policy riddles.

I see bring Pandemic control except remove Abbot office.

Go know works masks, social distancing, hand washing, surface decontamination, stay home possible. Well think what's going ascribing degree responsibility actors. think that's logical realistic, matter formal logic puzzle feel like figured is. 

Sure, countries stay closed Sweden. *some* responsibility there, granted. different countries face different pressures economic pressures open whomever feel need economic even diplomatic reasons. 

In cases, Sweden seen aggressor, bulk responsibility rests it. 

And ultimately stay room he's feeling better.

I guess actually bit like individual COVID. Sweden literally person COVID, it'd pretty obvious he'd bit asshole go room get others sick responsibility family members avoid rooms. stay rooms better. quite simple. made laugh pretty hard hahaha different story water though. Multiple families boat, multiple boats rafted together, single mask sight. wanting ask question: think number cases jumped US change definition CDC follows including antigen tests: definition: Nobody die write deceased! They're bit tired. Bill wants inject us tainted vaccines, search history Africa. War criminal. took 30 years get majority people wear brought back 22 employees recently tested active infection antibodies letting back worrk, 6 anti-bodies never felt symptoms. expecting 1 2, most. Asymptomatics make numbers look silly people finally widely tested. Lol üòÇ public health information available public? anything inland might well Arizona. Second one. many infections transmitted touching contaminated surfaces. Sure probability lower, keep taking precautions. People going watch documentaries decades future wonder historically accurate everyone stupid. ""This must edited theatrics!"" ""Sadly no, people fact dumb."" still saying that. least subs are. still fit jeans highschool spreading events consistent linear. takes right sequence duration interactions spread, highly probable given long enough timeline, still happen different rates.

Also go look graph exponential growth. changes small huge percentage graph rate reach vertical near right side. 2 systems different start points, different populations, habits, events, etc, majority graph growth low close together doubling rate wildly different. Passing incidental contact like incredidbly difficult unlikely. it, would likely get taking order casual chat, would take package. DeSantis says still mandate masks, saying, ""We're going continue put messaging, we're going continue put guidance we're going trust people make good aliens July, Yellowstone mega caldera erupting August.

My bigger concern fresh produce still needs refrigerated, lot doesn‚Äôt get washed like should, doesn‚Äôt get cooked, lot people touch do. even you‚Äôre one touch it, you‚Äôve still touched cart everything else picked touch check out. I‚Äôd happily take package meat truck touch face I‚Äôd something produce department- really anything grocery store Good point. regards deaths per capita, think OP trying make claim deaths per capita June 24th rather overall, would agree better compare overall rates. FYI, ""electorate"" means ""the whole group voters."" ""electorate"" America voters. 

What talking electoral college. people make electoral college ""electoral college"" ""electors."" That's different ""electorate."" 

That's probably poster confused. Electorates can't contradict popular vote. *are* popular vote.

Also, main point wrong. electoral college (probably) can't cast votes however want. known ""faithless electors."" 

32 states laws prohibiting ""faithless electors."" Typically, member electoral college votes someone else, laws make vote void ineffective. Also, someone chosen member electoral college, typically make vow vote candidate state.

So, yes, certainly possible member electoral college vote someone different. (In way possible people refuse file taxes.) illegal would probably ineffective. barely closed. opened biggest transmission vectors possible, 0 state enforced guidelines prevent spread.

What's worse everyone acted like everything normal went business Governor said nothing worry still insisting that's case. Agreed, thought exercise anything else. Anything like would challenged court discrimination probably win, reason. to.

I hope one southern state holds see deaths top infection rates hit 20% gradually fall. American thing I've ever read

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* said lockdown doesnt result anything. Lol. Lockdowns buy time preapered. reopening set standarts. Increase hospital capacity. Provide everyone mask, enforce it. Ramp testing. Make sure businesses comply rules. Make sure meticulous opening borders.

Then reopen. Ofc go back stupid, nothing change lockdowns nothing. Frankly, know doomers go top. ""worst case"" scenarios models discussing happens nothing. Given bad things partial effort, I'm sure wrong. love Boston too, parents live Cape. Social distancing mask usage Boston top notch. Cape polar opposite. dexamethasone adopted quickly reservation progressing fast it? wonder results poll would be:

""What many people, percentage, would eventually die"". literally prevents spread virus. 

We need stop pandering folks don‚Äôt care health. 

Wear mask don‚Äôt go out. We‚Äôre pandemic. 100% way snuff shit real quick. Liquor licenses cheap.  standard since April? Cherry picking numbers? I'm including entire states, states first shut last re-open. States strict rules around mask usage. politicizing show measures work curtailing spread. surge cases MA. 50/50 mix worse Austin. many people nodding heads ‚Äúexponential growth,‚Äù actually idea means. I‚Äôm trying say wouldn‚Äôt want vaccine works everyone younger generation. opinion taking care first since they‚Äôre risk younger people. opinion I‚Äôm sorry lot don‚Äôt like it. don‚Äôt think vaccine released doesn‚Äôt work people risk most. üëÜ Baseless claims. üëÜ Covid clear, claiming hospital overload that's happening places like AZ right due postponing elective surgeries? going need elaborate came conclusion. outside? could move location people free stand 6‚Äù apart.

Shocking. could predicted!!!.......  low virus levels UK moment weather turning rubbish next week doubt great impact. easily calculable units dollars. countries stay closed Sweden. responsibility there, granted. different countries face different pressures economic pressures open whomever feel need economic even diplomatic reasons. cases, Sweden seen aggressor, bulk responsibility rests it. 

Wrong. Either Sweden way alleviate pressure, case Country X bears responsibility choosing alternative Sweden. Swedes way alleviate pressure, case Country fault setting position depends single, country without backup plan.

Ultimately, people choose go Sweden's room, and/or welcome Sweden room. cases, people's fault failing allowing exposure Sweden. Per now, logic, entire family going ""fuck y'all"" getting infected outside family saying ""please don't"". I'm Florida (not Miami) still subscribe thought.

Anyone wanna bet they'll break tomorrow? Hot take: Outside theme parks require masks seem like much issue me. overcrowded bars/stores masks that's main issue. days Texas reported highest daily case count since onset coronavirus pandemic, Peter Hotez, infectious disease specialist headquartered Houston, urged state take action immediately new cases ravaged city ‚Äî one largest metropolitan areas country. Tuesday, Texas reported record-high daily new case count 5,489. Hotez called figure ‚Äúhorrifying‚Äù speaking reporters Houston Chronicle. Daily new case data Wednesday Thursday would rise even further, hitting 5,551 5,996, respectively. absolutely horrifying,‚Äù Hotez said. ‚ÄúI'm terribly upset see happening. predictive models Pennsylvania actually showed this. want Texas open early [as] did.‚Äù predict Abbot shut state again, avoid using ""shutdown"" phrasing.

Look states opened early states protests. states opened early seeing spikes, states protests seeing spikes. mean protests impact spread COVID? No, mean protests main driving factor spread COVID, ie. thing would happening GA rn even protests. Everyone get Covid moment becomes real So, mask requirement would work? Got it.

Having people wear masks helps plenty. want convince someone something, speak language. guy gets involved political aspirations. Since money make opinion matter field expert. He's basically paying play voice heard. supposed 3 5 days Quest Diagnostics others backed taking week nasal swab tests.

The antibody tests 3 4 days places. Don‚Äôt forget many deaths purposely pushed pneumonia/ cardiovascular events etc. 

But comparisons previous year‚Äôs pneumonia/ cardiovascular events reveals abnormal numbers, abnormal numbers. Vaccine September? ONE'S GETTING !!! /s Lol yoo took lot longer humans start wearing pants. 170,000 years ago. like New York chart correct. Wear mask social distance people Half people laughing. Sorry Dr Fauci get better responds wall I'm scientician I'll give go. People initially thought virus replicated way viruses do: virus particle latches onto healthy cell, sneaks inside, takes cell's internal machinery, transforms cell spitting virus particles, march infect cells. However, research shows coronavirus potential *second* method hijacking healthy cells. Rather spitting viral particles, infected cell grows little legs (the filopodia) barbs end containing virus. barbed legs bump neighboring healthy cells penetrate cell wall, allowing viral particles penetrate way well. two methods getting cells infected, fact filopodia doing. Imagine week interactions it‚Äôs believable. scary thing first two asymptomatic try contact trace third one got it. It‚Äôs basically impossible. White house? Oh yeah, entity supposed leading country. Sorry, almost forgot. worse high humidity droplets coalesce fall ground quickly rather linger air. climate controlled environments gotta worry Nah, bigotry Christianity actively ruining world. Enjoy church service though! Fucking star wars, started read headline like jar jar Binks. problem Southern California. Remember governor basically mocked us saying weren‚Äôt going next New York? Maybe I'm looking score instead color uniform hasn‚Äôt norm viruses potentially long period it‚Äôs contagious without symptoms think took time people‚Äôs playbooks shift.

It took even know sort mask wear. cloth mask isn‚Äôt proper PPE really took percolate usable option.

I haven‚Äôt house (well, walk around block) without mask doubt I‚Äôll stop time soon. brother, aren‚Äôt. Minnesota 500 new cases today. cases rising.

They re-opening...their cases last week ~450 around time. also protested state. 

If rise cases due protest, would've already shown Minnesota's numbers like Florida, Texas, again, you‚Äôre saying thousands people standing shoulder shoulder yelling impact spike kids beach bar did?

Outside large mask adoption rate? entirely possible didn't. exact science virus. 

Also, protests massive, much doubt number people protesting states like California, Texas, Florida higher number people went shops, restaurants, bars re-opening. entire system capacity location? Sorry questions, I'm trying understand scope issue. thats fucked It‚Äôs organized stupidity. dumbest people given voice. tried once. I‚Äôm still married Ava Greene, I‚Äôm gonna go ahead write bullshit. conveniently ignored fact that, even california, many many young people overweight obese, diabetic, existing conditions put risk, etc etc. mean shit, coworkers can‚Äôt even make 4 flights stairs without gasping air. work seaside I‚Äôm gonna say no, work destin bridge catch drift. absolutely interesting, mean that's pandemic took hold. fact, anything shows covid19 linked places responsible outbreak. Stay safe bro. Glad read it, thought minority actually enjoying wearing masks. Plus covering face really plays strength ladies watched entire show Netflix... guys that, there's also comic book (seriously). principles quite simple, actually, dealing emotional part going things really takes energy... 

Here's link (regular) book, least: is. I'm working reach back brother, keep family fold despite emotions around this. ADD knows does, speak. leaving another state less week wife (speaking cross-state moves... what's water hmm?), relief source sadness. 

Yeah... that's rough one. Especially given climate, that's fun one start outdoor activities enthusiastic. fun season, yeesh. heart goes wife. bad time shopanista. going bad time come... 

Has thought seriously starting new hobby type? cross-stitch tapestries, huge intricate projects almost like photographs. soothing big plus mental health. anything could buy kit Michael's would her, right now? Seriously late. live Canada bars restaurants closed March. wait June, baffling mayor state president? really money important people's life?

Some people truly think regards last question. Since lockdowns across world started, I've seen several people defending early re-open even cost lives economic fallout proper lockdown would result EVEN deaths. idea people math back that, never saw presented. terrifying can't even unify something blatantly bad global pandemic.

I used think humans needed common enemy come together species, apparently one's visible enough. Maybe aliens invade planet we'll side once.


Edit: Here's example /u/lunaprospekt received last week. comparison's sake live Michigan.

 ""No they‚Äôre reeling psychotic lockdowns. ones Florida doesn‚Äôt lol. 

Notice cases going up, deaths going up, economy booming. 

But keep [saving Month month helpful right now- year year? shut down. season gone. sucks, point, risk it. calling people bullshit does. stating facts, insulting hurt feelings come Still can't buy N95 mask... rubbing alcohol... WTF wrong place months emergency, jack shit done doubt expected 16 positives, seems rather high me... 3 - 6 so, sure... dozen? many staff may it? many players near 16 players may it, stage test positive yet? (takes like 3 - 5 days exposure test positive IIRC) could sick know it. Yet confident bravado arbitrarily put risk around selfish reasons.

Like drunk person, sober, makes action even worse.

People wear masks around others bad people. Damn thought heat sun would save us  totally avoidable. mean? Certain counties already mandated requiring masks business went court, Abbot said response ‚Äúthey finally figured out‚Äù, like it‚Äôs legal code hidden executive order.

So now, it‚Äôs basically local governments decide far want take mask requirements, apply people inside businesses, park anything. Cut $ 600 bet percentage flip week. Haha.  asthma too, I‚Äôd call moderate mild need inhaler everytime exercise STILL wear mask go running. Keep down, pull run past people. anything sign respect others. Like holy shit you. would rich investors. Home ownership tumble again. Quick math:

By mid May Utah \~5,000 confirmed cases.

1% infection rate = 32,000 infected people.

So 6 times higher confirmed cases. World Meters already reporting 39,940 cases today still several hours site collect data report it.

This likely means today yet another record day US. [archive link avoiding People sick wasn‚Äôt first time. isolated incident wouldn‚Äôt issue. Logically, happens often, many opportunities whole nation break mass protest weren‚Äôt middle pandemic. Arizona well. Ducey press conference &amp; mandate masks. Thinks good enough Mayors so. Pfft.  come one critical California spike new cases? Texas Florida. see Texas Florida get criticism. live Georgia. FINE.

For fucks sake, friends work hospitals deal bullshit. 

I see people going community swimming pool, hanging drinking local breweries, eating normally, going stores without masks. Fuck ignorance. I‚Äôm sick tired home idiots everybody stay home lot longer. fucking embarrassing. Okay ... serious question, anyone keeping track percentage teams reported infected?

Could Sports teams end hitting herd immunity faster general population? people survive covid, feel like lot get sick recover easily brag ""superior"" immune system - go say get really ill die probably ""deserved"" reason saves tax payers money way. Ultimately learn nothing continue worship politicians treat like disposable tools. likely deliberately downplayed.

Can ELI5 please? data indicate you? think purposefully playing, why? *is* much hotter 1) humidity 2) (and importantly) angle sun. 95F 95F thermometer, reality, Texas sun fry 70F outside. I'm making excuses trying argue; personally think everyone stay home, drink beer, play videogames safety couches. want go bar badly, sitting outside Texas really option unless 7am 8pm. ...the next government going one   fact move better letting get worse. There's still bunch trolls spreading misinformation encouraging spread virus. FYI, actually United States 1918 pandemic. Floridian here. Typical. Shhhh. never over. Actually never went real raves. huge ones Europe always looked amazing, sure person cool. Anyone answer instead showing ignorance? mean Countries Matter weekend? seems take 2 3 weeks surge starts slow lock everything down. even case. Texas kill lot people. whole STATE.... Houston 100 capacity. sure vote them. increases 1% per day *not* linear that's even slower. takes way time - doubling time would 72 days 1% daily exponential, 72 days faster linear.

But 1% per day much faster linear first month 1% exponential is.

30% * 101% ^ 72 = 60% 72 days.


30% * (1% per day) * 30 days = 60% 30 days.

You 26% 27% 28% etc i

This clearly implies linear, going 26 27 28 exponential. I‚Äôm sorry, Party Personal Responsibility told weren‚Äôt responsible.  article behind paywall, additionally looks like May. County set new record number cases one day, today also first day I've seen old converted school buses taking people mountain go white-water rafting. seen six far completely full Tx residents ones feeding him. represents people, all. bunch dumb people, still people. click link???

Edit : clicked. feel dumber reading quotes. thing learned improved treatment, since many states ignoring lessons actual shutdowns universal mask requirements effective mean far infected requiring treatment outweighing treatment improvements. know 6 feet arbitrary distance? servers wearing masks too. Wait...do work work? feel attacked headline.

Reopen gyms already. *cries* high cocaine... need unfriend him. lost authority pull hairdresser BS overruling Dallas County Judge. Hopefully Florida residents (whom ever outlives pandemic) remember vote guy‚Äôs butt office next election. Deliberately malicious That's completely irrelevant. can't see difference risk home AC pulling air away anywhere people recently standing, walking around town maskless careless people streets know tell you. Yes, older get higher get organizations realize hardly elaborate conspiracies like wonder Reddit critical California like Florida Texas. California two new cases.  Ron ""a cartoon politician became real boy"" DeSantis, everyone. say, however, could instance proactive actually risky. Jared Polis Colorado proactive even opened early despite idiots CU causing spike throwing parties, actually better most. Everyone see wearing mask public (at least area). set good example early people part following suit shows. literally fucking doesn‚Äôt. entire point insurance, whether it‚Äôs government provided, like countries, private, like US, pool enough money cover everyone‚Äôs healthcare costs. people require much healthcare others. get far money insurance put in. Others relatively healthy, therefore end putting money take out. countries government subsidized healthcare, taxes. US, it‚Äôs premiums. neither case magic money machine $1 premiums/taxes go in, $2 comes out. isn‚Äôt rocket science. Educate yourself. know Texas weird, haircuts bars restaurants.

Usually. shouldn‚Äòt get kudos reacting situation caused first place...Anything ‚Äúpositive‚Äù day forward accepted platform fool must save face. genuinely cared people economy never would preemptively opened guidance CDC. No, nationwide polls majority favoring masks anti mask crowd louder. concerned wearing masks outside public. instead concerned wearing masks private businesses. Eh. save us. also actively make worse. Don‚Äôt forget prisons. need get Ray Lewis banned completely virtual.  Zoom, GotoMeeting WebEx exist reason. Crazy enough taken proper response put plan action place, we'd boat are. Instead we're going mess 2020. Edmonton, hair place customers wearing masks. Stylists mask face shield. Thought overkill, appears overkill bad idea. Insulting others makes feel better? seem cool FL you? able get tested quite easily St Pete two weeks ago. didn‚Äôt symptoms, requirement surgery. There's pretty decent effort area next door praise businesses requiring masks enforcing it, call seem give s***. example, lucky local home Depot half people wearing masks, common see several employees wearing them. Lowe's hand, enforces mask policy, requirement state, employees patrons alike. husband contractor. go home Depot ever reason. don‚Äôt actually source backs assertion? getting scarier scarier there.... work anaheim got positive cases workplace now. many positives makes government look like ignored science medical information. pointing much bigger problem government wanted acknowledge. turn, leads even negative economic impact...and absolutely can't economy looking bad election year. image, economy re-election Florida mandatory quarantine people arriving NY Tri-State area since March.

The current spike Florida started beginning June.

Of course, people visiting New York coming back Florida plates quarantined. YES. coworker saying would hate working retail right now. terrible place terrible people give rat's ass making terrible wage. ""We actually locked necessary.""

NYC area one worst corona results entire world. necessary? close subway (didn't even clean 2 months), sent thousands covid cases hospitals back nursing homes, killing thousands vulnerable citizens. Tragic. I‚Äôm also North Jersey ‚ÄúEARNED‚Äù literally made cry. frayed. Silly, test sick people. all, test results, we'll know test. /s Nature provide ourselves. can't distribute resources nobody works them. resources people working create, extract, refine, produce them. Resources take granted limitless stop existing people produce stop producing them.

Society make work necessary, every wild creature find food shelter. Society made easy take things see around granted. know make microwave cup enjoy hot noodles 60 seconds. still benefit minds did. took vacation known hot zone balls talk people's behavior.

JFC news, 44% Americans complete fucking morons. Well people keep voting conservatives. expect? Progress? lol I‚Äôm starting doubt false negatives. CDC released information antibody test revealing 10 times many people virus aware of. cannot antibodies virus.

Perhaps false negative talk set keep people going out. around horrible situation. Fuck virus.

Here option person K-12 available coming school can't online:

A neurotypical child K-maybe 3rd cannot navigate technology themselves. also need supervision day. need meals prepared lunch. Many kids parents work parents cannot (or not) provide supervision whatever reasons. internet access. enough devices children (think households 3 plus school aged kids). situations even know prevent online education.

Now consider child special education. child may able work independently regardless grade may need supervision even teens.

I know school districts around US ""lost"" children go online rest last school year. means completely lost touch kid parents. imagine many ""lost"" school year person option?

The rich privileged course fine online education. poor middle class huge problems.

If online education available, huge negative consequences seen later affect us. least COVID shingles look forward to, swell... Oh yeah. Ouch. Trump pressing matters attend pandemic putting boot half country's ass. mandatory quarantine people arriving NY Tri-State area since March.

I remember, actually enforced way? look everything disagrees bogus what's point [Here One crazies city responding mayor Twitter mandatory mask policy. It‚Äôs literally graphic hypercapnia wiki page fuckin mask photoshopped lol Comment month right here, props you. gold, would California 5% test results coming back positive, great national average 7%, indicating speed spread bad ATM. problematic states like Texas, Florida etc 10% increasing, suggesting disease spreading faster ability keep testing. 100% state government refuses shut lol  pretty much accepted China's reported numbers never near accurate? I‚Äôve seen ‚Äúbogus‚Äù studies. sarcastic, studies show protest drove rates? try educate sides stories. bars opened New York past month, like California, point? least band's back together, manager probably stuck ramp. hey! whoa chill science words buddy care politics America thought never even wanted win first place, publicity time would go Germany prostate surgery? Oof ya forgot that... be, asked it. remember comments back March lol Thank keeping things goin spreading truth. administration every bit debunked propaganda helpful Tbf also happened weeks ago bank holiday, luckily passed rise cases.. also middle peak decided celebrate Day congas streets.... 

*when say we, I‚Äôm including Put suitcase behind you. chargeback invented for. Contact credit card, cancel charges, let card companies pursue it. think Hypervibe idea well thoroughly they've fucked themselves. we're learning many fellow Americans really deserve part society. point I‚Äôm like 60% sure world leaders select elite receiving kind special plasma treatment something prevent getting it. single world leader gotten thing since Boris? Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt say don‚Äôt see posting ‚Äúnon bogus‚Äù studies history. 

Feel free drop Real Science us, oh wise one!  dude, remember McConnell said states fend financially declare bankruptcy back April deaths New York near peak? 70% infected predictions widely missed mark every single time. thinking yet underestimated stupid.  Making smile 2020, that's definitely worth upvote Covid positive nursing homes exist, definitely March April kicking off. places converted wings, sent people there. overwhelming emergency, safe options, pick least dangerous one could. chief command forfeited..

Put charge show face two weeks 

It actually right around month ago, ~2-3 weeks later started seeing big uptick coronavirus cases. new cases come protests? course not, say protests *no* part increased spread, especially right top general re-openings, frankly absurd. Truthfully? Politicization news. department/institution member of? use official email you‚Äôll probably get better response. Digital learning prep. would think could get plans together school opening make better. I'm high school math teacher make due fly. 

Here's thing, online learning would still better person learning ton restrictions. is. virus real. 500 shmive hundred. matter cops enforce it. gonna post bogus study agrees stick comment completely made-up column? Cytotoxic means toxic living cells. would want anything toxic living cells. one hand, doesn‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs hoax, thus believes it‚Äôs real, doesn‚Äôt care whether people get infected die it, sounds like sociopath. 
On hand, sanitising probably doesn‚Äôt make much difference (it still helps, main route transmission via aerosolised bodily fluids), he‚Äôs wearing mask properly required otherwise following regulations, he‚Äôs curb spread virus many, many people... Dr Birx one them? Dr Birx stayed silent trump asked injecting sunlight disinfectant possible covid cures? Yeah, I'm gonna start looking advice day now. /S x 10,000 wednesday dude go away April...

...2023 True. You‚Äôre right Good. start fining businesses serving unmasked customers. far effective terms enforcement. sure I'm means saying majority even sizable crowd protesting hair cuts small crowd fucking idiots fuck media giving platform. Guess easier group pick on. BLACK LIVES MATTER Love living Florida essential worker whose hazard pay already taken away. It‚Äôs great. Thanks posting, crunched numbers 5-year averages get results. example, 5 year average Indiana 1053 deaths, Illinois 2394 deaths, Tennessee 1632 deaths. numbers full year totals, averages totals 2014 2019.

Your point still stands - cases pneumonia much higher normally see - getting numbers lot lower? Well certainly Trump take suggestion well /s guess that‚Äôs one way ru*i*n business. many liability issues. imagine lawsuits mandatory ""volunteer"" claims caught COVID hospital? mean, people going themselves, still close bit borderline darwinism

It's poor employees going pay price given ppe beginning this, heard 2/3 ICU beds typically occupied, rough rule thumb, nation 100k ICU beds total. Oh gosh absolutely terrible see grocery store without mask beer away let know don‚Äôt want around them. Sometimes grin like they‚Äôre saying hello don‚Äôt clue going on. Wtf.

We provide ever citizen healthcare.


So would really need tell medical providers U.S. government willing pay Canada procedures. That's around 6% US infected. 

Nowhere near herd immunity. tesla proved EVs profitable.

I've read suggests might tied elective surgeries main source profit hospitals. Take grain salt would make sense.



This correct. work major healthcare group (tech support) huge loss due elective surgeries. I‚Äôm Texas. Lots idiots don‚Äôt wear masks here. hope Thank Also forget, caring newly purposed beds med/surg nurses may critical care experience. Outcomes pretty.  ""There 198 Adult Intensive Care Unit beds available state, 12%, Wednesday, state data shows. currently 1,495 ICU beds, 88%, use.""

Yikes. Well, can't fix stupid. man JO always prescient af :) Glad watched it! must desperate trying rope Sandy Hook this. conspiracies into? think President collude Russia? often speak things know vigor? took NYC 3 weeks locking reach peak hospitalizations. going long painful ride...   Easy fix.


Do like Florida, partially report COVID ICU beds.

If fails, stop testing..

Guess put **/S** case someone actually takes seriously agree general tone comment, SC2 significantly contagious either flus. Whoa whoa whoa. Nobody suggesting getting rid anything. I‚Äôm saying many times Eurocentric narcissists misrepresent healthcare reddit. I‚Äôve European redditors tell like 40-50% income goes taxes it. That‚Äôs mindblowingly high me, like peace mind I‚Äôm advocating anyone change. many grandmas gonna kill then? UK patients medians 90 days...it‚Äôs question keeping people alive, that‚Äôs becoming easier...it‚Äôs finding space them. wait till cold again. US got lucky getting hit middle winter.

I can't believe literally middle summer right cases peak. go, fleeing vacation homes. repeating course first outbreak pretty much verbatim, except domestic level. No, consulted dictionary definition pandemic. Super easy.  feel sheriffs refuse enforce marijuana laws? Doctors New York :/

One nice thing (and nobody's quite sure why, take grain salt) mortality rate going down. might change hospitals overwhelmed. bleeding heart well realize that? upset people dying taking strict measures. Friendly reminder 405,399 us citizens died WW2 Coronavirus killed 126,000. Tons people actually think hoax refuse wear masks, ignore social distancing, federal government appears said ""fuck let em die"" could mostly prevented first place. Time reduce human capital stock. clear, NYC fine right taking seriously. hand, could change quick enough people return irresponsible behavior.

A better comparison Europe. Comparing East Asia problematic. SE Asia SARS scary. People learned wear masks. impact US. Add American individualism/selfishness expect initial response like South Korea. Look Italy, Spain, France. crap job. difference learned coherent national response. US, states great response. Others disaster, federal response pure politics side incompetence. say, basic obvious precautions become politicized.

It embarrassment. Trump loves say ""I best people."" best people US something like this. problem shittiest president. guess Trump's fault saddled narcissistic incompetent commander-in-chief. guess real question many seconds till hit ground? Dude... stop. painful read. Co-workers family it. Two pneumonia...1 almost hospitalized (couldn't breathe right (big strong guy)... went er alternative.

They gave pac let go ER. promised would got worse still morning....by morning little better.

In department 1\4 got it. 1 died (50 underlying conditions). 1 early 40s 14 weeks it.(same underlying conditions ""Worst Coronavirus Pandemic Day, [so .. Btw, even think particular big deal. seems HR tried best two employees. Elon getting nerves regardless tesla pumped max. deaths reporting, there‚Äôs lots reports suggesting manipulating numbers. makes lot sense... nurse administering meds ventilator w/ 5 patients instead 2...could easily miss something patient 2 coding needs help patient 4 starts same... there's one her.... ya now? Anyone else felt extremely depressed week creeping, ever-present feeling deja vu worse? feels like end March again, time answer slow stop virus. clear nobody charge gonna responsible things mandating masks lockdown places, hospitals ICUs gonna overflow, we're gonna refrigerator trucks streets, we're gonna start measuring daily deaths compared 9/11 again, and...nothing change. paralyzing. think would figured sort logistics now. I'm sure complex, would guess NYC previously heavily hit areas could handle capacity already protocols well sorted out. Maybe texas pay NYC nurses hazard pay save lives. Utilize empty flights send soon-to-be-critical patients areas capacity. thought Musk infamous Tesla, ventures extreme cutting low performers. Every year everyone gets reviewed bottom 5% company gets fired. excuses, exceptions. cuts every year. Disney World looks like still open though. elected. Can‚Äôt fire community wants this. time seems US wining prize. can't effective without intrusive, certainly intrusive still ineffective.

Case point, know FBI, NSA, Google, Facebook good number apps already tracks you, lies respecting privacy, nobody want admit tracking you.

What US lacks intrusive surveillance, US lacks honestly we're going Sweden route taking route, ending destination. 
    
Bravo America. Fucking Bravo!!!!! Talking co worker 
Assumptions work office field. deemed essential service.
Their company brought back work didn‚Äôt make masks mandatory. 

I know oil field companies requiring masks office. you‚Äôve randomly decided outbreak encompasses many people get disease nothing sick makes many die. anyway you‚Äôre waste time. Good luck still dont want ICU patient normal medsurg bed. 
Nowhere near enough resources first state hit, virus spreading anyone knew it. Cuomo‚Äôs response swift decisive, they‚Äôre super cautious reopening quickly. almost like people stayed home first weeks this, continued wear masks could‚Äôve prevented New York resources smaller hospitals like mine have.

We start diverting patients today.

I'm really worried. Imagine self quarantining 3 months state people idiots efforts naught said idiots. Oh totally ok, I'm little buzzed thought replying phillymomma101 anyway :-) Heads up. ICU capacity ER 12 hours behind. new ICUs cannot admitted stay ER using space resources. Thank trend old means time help might late (e.g. climate change) I‚Äôm certainly sure rural counties, sad part probably still people simply think doesn‚Äôt affect liberal part Texas. Even so, people probably experiencing schadenfreude view people ‚Äútrue Texans‚Äú liberal transplants California. such, I‚Äôd really interested know perception small-town Texas. hospitals, god's sake, health care providers! Every time see name, that's mind sees. wtf... Yep, risk higher mortality get hospitalized - NYC providers working over-capacity hospitals estimated [they could saved 30-40% COVID instead died. truth government already that. gives ton money teaching hospitals train residents. pays medicare/medicaid treatment. That's what's infuriating situation per capita government already spending similar amounts compared western countries. frankensystem broken. Look quebec vs rest Canada. 1 person floor Covid? Anyone dies gets written covid death. also test alot provinces Fuuuuuck kinda happened couple people RemindMe! 3 weeks article literally reads first 5 sentences ""There's nothing alarmed about."" one reads headline Lol, too:) one thing hospitals fucking want, covid pandemic. It'll make hemorrage money. Cancelling elective surgeries cruelest cut all. None scenarios contagious, none tend max ICU beds hospitals. mean always shave. 

And yeah, people try wear masks correctly.  Coming hot protests, huh?  ‚Äúthe path‚Äù? Makes sound smooth slow ride. We‚Äôre barreling, pal! Zooming even! literally meme economy led meme leaders meme currency. fed musk bullshit. watch $TSLA break 1000 tomorrow news good news. oh wow  Headline: ""Man Goes Hospital""

""Guess we'll die,"" OP, probably. Sometimes gotta wonder even make house without drowning toilet biting electrical cord something. surely something working right noggins. Exactly. you‚Äôre talking about. Well bad news you. they're office, half people elected office. They're representing someone, you.

We're living tyranny majority.

Are going vote everyone out? hold breath. yeah overall deaths goin I'm guessing Australia rather hardly cases month two, started recently gaining cases. new cases could possibly show community spread rather non-existent Australia period time. people can't put mask, imagine going climate change knocking doors hard we'll make unimaginable sacrifices want livable planet. aren‚Äôt inching closer exponential growth. 


There 3 days row ~5,000+ new infections. 


You launchpad exponential growth. nasty part job. Paramedic six years handful times first-on-scene multiple patients deal long time anyone else got help.

I really major PTSD times decided patient far gone waste time on. bothered instances patients died care have. 

The hardest three parts job 1) dealing dead kids, 2) watching incompetent ER docs kill patients 3) telling families loved ones dead.

Those moments stick anything. I‚Äôm saying you‚Äôre billionaire, you‚Äôre likely running business that‚Äôs least close ‚Äúessential‚Äù likely already working. Billionaires don‚Äôt run stuff that‚Äôs opening right (gyms, restaurants).

This failure government, think billionaires convenient fall person. get gotten richer that‚Äôs we‚Äôre opening propaganda turned true? Every state reopened early problem. That's win far administration concerned. one could seen warning signs. supposed know pandemic coming? 

It‚Äôs like 3 months countries states compare to. Change name active component charge 50k it. Genius. Exactly, even County level, could mandated masks closed restaurants, buildings etc. Sit back enjoy collapse US Empire. New York also figured exaggerate need ventilators without shame, well quietly kill elderly, really look inspiration competency Unfortunately, companies like always exact revenge end. might say consequence long run promoted, given raises, receive poor reviews, might treated terribly. ""not team player"" ""unwilling go extra mile"". 

Workers understand deeply consequences working job telling job *could* it.  See tomorrow headline demolishing polls rn though good summary article:

 I've avoiding news days now. specific reason cases bad Texas currently? events/gatherings/holidays preceded due general bad practices among citizens/local government? Dave‚Äôs work reminds Carlin. Even Mark Twain awards speech George vibe it. Ricky Gervais another one reminds Carlin I‚Äôve got news billionaires don‚Äôt care, conveniently top 100 got $430billion richer pandemic, they‚Äôll grow even richer they‚Äôve bought stocks shares half price top government grants.

The people affected 99% population stagnant wages years, top increased cost living, insurance more. Putin almost certainly nothing anti lockdown protests. humanity headed virus virus. may actually help prolong humanity's demise actually population numbers fall Maybe point NYC need 10,000 ventilators Navy hospital ship Houston same.

30k

And hospital ship almost empty

Temporary hospitals barely used.

Any good argument? Yeah imagine severe lack oxygen you. Glad research sure YEAY! think generally call acetaminophen.

That generally use brand name might suggest problem lies. ""the people woken fuck up"" K Damn. experts told open early.  Yeah, wish true, isn‚Äôt cults work. Dude, username fucktard divide give wider expansion recent it‚Äôs always pretty huge safely say Bush era wasn‚Äôt pretty either. Trump just...well, special...so speaking, bc whatever fashion afraid making racially driven comments empowered silenced stifled racists NeoNazis America even nations. Bush era led many Sikh, Indian, Muslim, Middle Easterners getting murdered 9/11. Never forget. ppl always here. event time lets show mugs again. ALWAYS come us things social media blasting now. Lot dead Texans coming weeks.  

I wonder blame this?  group U.S. that's charge state whose states seems happen lot?  first sentence definitely true. fact images I've seen there's MAYBE 50% mask usage. many holes unanswered questions article. California law, employer whose employee reported work one week failed respond questions absence considered employees abandoned job.

In company Tesla's size, likely number employees elected return home. Tesla would contacted (phone, electronic registered mail) reasons returning. strange two employees employees return contacted. Mmmm.  doubt error Tesla's part. smell union activities article. think current capacity issue probably manage another two weeks. said, stop two weeks without intervention. Exponential growth doubles every period time. Texas recently gone doubling times 31 days 19 days last week. Therefore, Texas completely beds long growth continues, will, one changing behavior yet. 

I think all-but-guaranteed hospitals running beds look like New York next week two. I'm hoping end looking like Lombardy close things down. one lost puppy Elon Musk narcissistic twat. He's shaking hands dark govt, raving accomplishments, treating employees like shit. wants American workers rights step Southeast Asias'. Can't stand see man venerated.


He good person/philanthropist media hype. He's self-serving narcissist. battering diver social media? That's Elon Musk. Congratulations Gregg, really fucked up. morons turned wearing mask political act. Yeah, makes majority shareholder. He's also Tesla's CEO.

Just seems like weird distinction say ""no *he* that, company he's charge did!"" said company entirely unrelated him. Sorry her, that's good good luck tomorrow. Wait I'm reading right they're roughly average ICU capacity? reason discrepancy report 100% ICU beds filled? Slow clap..... K Southern states almost control. would wise states allow visitors places simmers down. California's counties huge

City County San Francisco: ""bruh"" You‚Äôre getting downvoted testing pretty decent California months. Positive rate shooting never fails get sick year period saw NBC nightly news, 70% cases unrelated Covid People dying always worse cases

Not really. infections = deaths line, chance infect people. people die infect others anymore.

If lot deaths number infections going down, that's good news.

If deaths number infections increasing exponentially, that's BAD news. okay trump makes liberals, Black people ""queers"" mad fearful, makes worth it. Damn democratic governors confirmed title accurate. hope doctors familiar wartime triage shits get real. Ask Italy. We'll see mass gathering daily well. knew coming shut late. Perhaps flip voting Blue reds deads. stop counting worry it. That's things nature exponential, really need education order hope understanding simply intuitive. agree you, BS narrative there's nothing WTF, fast. never reopen really flattening curve.  always room virus every flight. city Los Angeles half population city New York.

Have seen 'leadership' school boards associated administration? I'm aware net worth vs liquid. It'd great public companies uplifting employees rather shareholders. Social distancing required essential activities. Masked, 6 foot outdoor gatherings funzies still bad idea. Putin running country. Putin dividing paralyzing country. one running country right now.  Solid try, go attack people subreddit please. Schools combined cold weather gonna fucking force. hope states keep schools closed. wish federal government would send funds parents quit work watch help pay daycare...literally anything.
Also colleges reason opening. Online classes easily work. Ooooohweeeeeeee! That's easy smack resort w/ violations shut down. civil matter one president 'emoluments clause' shit. I'm confused question... there's doubt far COVID benefited billionaires regular people. Pushing us back work safe part that. hide yachts indefinitely, can't. yep Also without 2020 census. quite possible Houston surpassed Chicago last ten years. guess earlier day Jersey posted 1700 new deaths must mistake right? Earlier today worldometers 2,000 deaths US, back 800s again. bad that's headline says. Impressive, huh? 

I drove Planet Fitness gym AZ around dozen people see customers wearing masks. wonder we're surging... country gets exact leadership deserves. 40% country racist wanna kill it, leadership could reflect - that's GOP. 

If remaining 60% see issue Dem Party. feel like hospital CEOs would huge conflict interest here, that, longer wait forcefully shutting down, money stand make treating critical patients.

How ask pool Doctors treating coronavirus patients do, instead CEO stands make money sick people.

If Lt Governor craven enough say, effect, let people die economy flourish, I'm sure CEOs that'd psychotic enough think way. ""both"" pretty safe take imo dont get ppl instinctively start hyperboles We're gonna open early, virus, magically go away own, now, second wave. guys fuked. would be. They‚Äôre home organization doesn‚Äôt tre spins kindly ghosted pandemic extra money. Many hospitals large network blacklisted one hard get another. Plus ICU many nurses furloughed. Dave Chappelle's 8:46 reminiscent Carlin. That‚Äôs winter mentality normally. even dollars, short term dollars next quarter. matter much screws us next year, beat projection next 3 months IT!!! Corona outbreak Aspen incoming. Yep, lung damage, kidney damage, lots kinds organ damage seem possible. led criminals.   You‚Äôre blaming bars riots nonstop? thought, dawned also signaling okay us kill black people (from covid?) gonna signal non-mask wearers probably also racists good thing protest 'muh rights'... perfect storm localized race war.... 

I mean, want masks protect SINCE blacks much harder issue w/ covid white populations? case think trying 'progressive BLM allies' failing miserably understand that. 

In words libs trying woke, totally missing point - they're drawing racists endangering black lives. Maybe um, figure way cops profile blacks masks 'thugs' ...i mean make sense you? know exactly said bullshit fuck moron. say alarmed, first blip surge come.

Americans know rest hopelessly helplessly brainwashed. fucking depressing scary say least. project 14 days surge ICU capacity runs out. YAY! 100 percent!

Hey, waste good panic inducing, misleading, sensationalist headline! public gatherings people don‚Äôt wear masks don‚Äôt practice social distancing involve transmission unwilling recipients... includes celebrations, parades, marches, protests, looting, choirs, visits religious places.................. shut down? first time? realised testing increases count coronavirus infected? Pathetic don‚Äôt read article fear-monger

Edit: account straight pumping misleading bullshit Covid.  governor douchey spent months lockdown prevent state government threw away told us dying save economy honor.

This fucking bullshit. bro.  Spring break March I'd agree that.

I'd also note there's lot nationally-supported local experimentation testing China doing, informs national approach going forward:

* 1st comprehensive regional, nation-wide lockdown world
* mass education COVID-19
* transfer 42,000 medical staff Wuhan
* construction 2 pop-up hospitals Wuhan within couple weeks
* 1st mass deployment health status app 
* mandatory government isolation quarantine positive cases (breaking households)
* mandatory 14+ day quarantine incoming travellers
* mass testing entire 10 million population Wuhan

And on. 

The pop-up hospitals Wuhan test ""bubble up"" things someone locally suggested, national government supported make happen. lot cooperation coordination that's happening behind scenes make things happen. 

As seen Wuhan Beijing firings/replacements, there's also system accountability national government imposing. also good, helps ensuring public trust cooperation. 

They've building playbook go, refining along. result, experience regional lockdown, etc. insight whether/when makes sense mass Wuhan-scale testing. result, China far better able choose actions based evidence experience 'optimal' results. hit iceberg lifeboats already full ""You loved ones dying; get used it, nothing see here."" Unbelievable far things fallen top levels Government unfortunate extremely frustrating u fuckin wot live it‚Äôs fucking hot humid. it‚Äôs hard keep on. forget home. 5 year old keeps ripping off.

She also visited quarantine hospitals visited perimeter virus-study laboratory city alleged source outbreak - accusation stringently denied Times reported Wednesday Ms Zhang - city collect first-hand accounts three months - believed arrested charged crackdown independent journalism Beijing.

The paper reported could face seven years jail arrested May 14 later charged ""provocation trouble making‚Äù.

 Freedom speech considered right current Chinese Communist Party rule. Party controls news media censors content access internet. low official death toll put forward Beijing - 4,634 83,418 confirmed cases - doubted.

Ms Zhang, previously arrested Chinese police also vocal supporter democracy Hong Kong, reported video ‚Äúthe problem country faces everything covered up‚Äù.

She one four citizen journalists known detained disappeared posted accounts Wuhan, according paper.

The news comes Chinese officials claimed second cluster novel emerged Beijing linked wholesale market ""largely control"".

It made headlines around world 34-year-old Li Wenliang, eye doctor Wuhan, died virus given severe oral warnings authorities posting message onto social media warn medics ""SARS-like"" seeing emerge patients January. Government experts believe 20 million Americans could contracted coronavirus, 10 times official counts, indicating many people without symptoms disease, senior administration officials said.

Still *way* short needed herd immunity, like 220 *million* estimate, Centers Disease Control Prevention, based serology testing used determine presence antibodies show whether individual disease, officials said.

The CDC's testing? heard officials, speaking small group reporters Wednesday night, said estimate based number known cases, 2.3 million 2.4 million, multiplied average rate antibodies seen serology tests, average 10 ‚ÄúIf multiply cases ratio, that‚Äôs get 20 million figure,‚Äù said one true, estimate would suggest percentage U.S. deaths disease lower thought. 120,000 Americans died disease since pandemic erupted earlier estimate comes government officials note many new cases showing young people exhibit symptoms may know it.

I guess could part explanation deaths falling despite infections Officials said young people symptoms, regular contact vulnerable populations, proactively get tested make sure spread ‚ÄúWe heard Florida Texas roughly half new cases reporting people age 35, many asymptomatic,‚Äù one official said.

Oh great: super-spreaders. CDC sent 40 response teams help deal outbreaks, 36,000 new cases COVID-19 recorded nationwide Wednesday, shy record 36,426 April 24, concentrated states spared brunt initial outbreak moved early lift restrictions aimed curbing virus‚Äô spread.  I'll believe see independently sourced video situation. remember Elmhurst NY ""overwhelmed"", kids snuck filmed empty hospital.

Ok, end rant. ever read constitution? Even Texas went full mask distancing tomorrow, people actually obeyed it, surge capacity would still exceeded weeks. Elections consequences, Texas pay dearly choices. :\ risk

They're either. Reddit real life all. I'm left, whole peer group left show things get shocked. I'm ready leave sub. insane lol. ppl left house 5 months I'm sure mental health get virus. Right. That's children starving death people die exposure richest country. I'm broken. I'm disabled. Yeah, guess Houston throwing mildly sick patients ICU. Must hoax. /s astonishes still people think still worse flu. 

Honestly things keep getting worse die senseless completely avoidable deaths there's chance hell he'll ever get re-elected. Can't wait hear everyone going say protests nothing this. virus discriminatory like that. hates protests chooses party. 
Maybe protestors went back states came spread it.  Medical suspensions don‚Äôt dead open inside file. sick hearing word ‚Äúsheep‚Äù! Seems like it‚Äôs used whenever someone backed corner, can‚Äôt provide logical, evidence-based comeback. houstonian traveling medical center nightmare alone fucking fannin street. medical center gives even longest living resident Houston nightmares get find parking. BLM go television tell everyone we're shutting testing many positive results.  100% unconstitutional cure light body :o /s Education 7/10 Rice. meant governor sorry.

We need mandatory mask social distancing like states. refuses opens beaches public Thank u posting. Medical Center (Houston) officially reached 100% ICU capacity.** 
If trend continues, hospital system capacity become overwhelmed,"" TMC leaders warned Houstonians letter Wednesday.

Well, good thing interpreted situation us, bit obscure. Godspeed bastard. us essentials ‚Äúfrontlines‚Äù serving morons, wish us Covid free life  Hey! I've seen one! biggest medical center world? Yet argument of, ‚ÄúWell tests become available we‚Äôre seeing spike infection rate‚Äù, still thrown around justify wearing mask; it‚Äôs disheartening disappointing considering friends adamant they‚Äôre ignorant look facts. probably 400 die.  Thanks info! I‚Äôm kind surprised people surprised too. remember weeks ago wondering going cases ramped back response relaxing social distancing keeping virus (somewhat) check. Like...what reason think wasn‚Äôt going happen? He‚Äôs bloater Last Us millions people work businesses shutting good. Except left.

I'm losing hope every day we'll ever able safely things again. Everyone's acting surprised. watched dipshit past 3.5 years? hush naggy wench. yeesh You‚Äôre absolutely retarded. Evidently also catch corinavirus honey well.


Can seatbelts safety protocols too?
According stinking thinking need laws mandates.  Guess move Disney Florida hosting NBA playoffs ""Bubble environment"". doubt NBA would put players park reopened. like say shirt, shoes mask service. . . hypocrits aint topless barefoot too. 126k dead roughly 23m cases, make death rate .5% 1 200 people? COVID never left? get haircut, surely means victory. Another nontrivial aspect reality likely playing large role different protesters adhering masks differently. example- post popped feed seconds ago. See wearing masks? Lucky it‚Äôs huge crowd. You‚Äôre absolutely retarded. Bullshit.  Oh shit shouldn‚Äôt math head I‚Äôm violent bm crazy right. Americans already pay tax dollars Healthcare costs per capita Canada does. could 100% system universal healthcare increase taxs hell lot less personal cost. lot protests Texas Arizona?

‚Äî F.A. Hayek bit stupid? Well case probably would threatened rather sign order right away. also doesn‚Äôt make sense punish sounding alarm much suspending elective surgeries pretty drastic measure free ICU capacity.  dont know Houston well part texas I'm from, test corona unless admitted hospital. people cough sneeze symptoms spreading course, huge mess.  No, country rewards psychopaths give fuck hurt get paid Nice graph Majesty there. Bah!!! density better metric covid. Ever notice terrible companies lack leadership?

These people running government. Yup - bailout money (stolen taxpayers) rich, ""thoughts prayers"" plebs already have. Cities big protests haven‚Äôt seen corona spikes. You‚Äôre willfully ignoring point. think bone pick BLM That's idea behind contact tracing. somebody gets COVID, ask lots questions places they've visited people they've come contact with. That's get stories particular birthday party particular choir practice resulted many new cases. course, way anyone know every person they've contact with, parties, bars, restaurants, protests exactly sort thing looking for. They're also lying arresting citizen reporters. 3 weeks ago, tens thousands marched protests Houston. icu full. mean THINK going happen?!?! trumps fault. Give freaking break. 1% IFR 80% seroprevalence would 57,600. mass death, yes. know think going serve food hair... profits matter!  knowledge experience virus every day regarding treatments spread. would expect people getting sick AZ TX July 2020 better chance survival NYC April 2020 Hotels, shows, kids rides, etc. Can‚Äôt imagine many show ride dumbo day.   two main types tests COVID-19. first detects viral RNA using molecular methods polymerase chain reaction (PCR). read test ARUP Consult‚Äôs COVID-19 topic. tests highly specific based unique genetic sequence SARS-CoV-2. test comes back positive, confident SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA specimen collected patient. wish density column analysis. without overall product taking hit, legitimately think could continue season lot players sitting wanted force way it.

Football rosters extensively long though already ‚Äúnext man up‚Äù culture. final point even XFL getting decent viewership earlier year. alarming news story appears humans infect minks minks, infected, infect humans.

*When comes eradicating disease, ""the worst animal virus jumps becomes established humans ‚Äî wide host range,"" infect many different animal species might pass back humans. ""And that's SARS-COV-2.""* Hmm ok fair point. logic applies 1920 flu people masks then. 30ish million deaths

The thing know ""masks"" form napkin face effective? Given people arent cleaning keeping unsanitary places, touching readjusting etc. know people arent walking around disease ragson face?

Not saying that's case questions need empiracally verified justifiable mandate üëèisüëèbrilliant Joseph said individuals asymptomatic carriers 14 days could pass disease asymptomatic carriers, possible could take 40 days see real impact protests public health. said doubtful protests wind impact health experts feared. they'll actually start bidding beds. pay much, get icu spot. Else, good luck probably states politicians encouraging people congregate large crowds name ""justice!!!"" feel you- event planner (trade shows/conferences). supposed host event Texas March postponed fall. isn‚Äôt going happen. entire events production industries devastated. Best luck you. Yes, we're nowhere near herd immunity anywhere. Herd immunity would require 2 million deaths U.S., unless could somehow lock away old sick people let virus run everyone else. Please tell obvious mask mandate better mask mandate. right. practically pointless people follow anyways. California's sake, hope anecdote representative widespread problem southern California. 

Here Michigan, 30 minutes Detroit, mask mandate nearly everyone wears mask. assumed California would reason wear masks either. YouTube radicalizes automatically.

It‚Äôs AI driven echo chamber. Whatever initial biases, feed that.

Ultimately make anyone‚Äôs certainty bias stronger.

They know regret it, don‚Äôt anything makes much money driving viewing time pushing ads. hear manage logistics people really well. Maybe think getting project management certification? seemed like meant 1800 cases day? Bedspace. justify giving shit others?

It sure seems like it. Reading cathartic. feel exact way. knew ignorance stupidity existed world small amount, situation highlighted just.. horrible. disappointed sad angry. know end Seattle massive protests, seen related spike. Masks + outdoors seems pretty fucking safe. people testing positive COVID King County reporting protests. might case ends responsible small spike, again, nothing like would expect. Again, masks + outdoors. Outside, strong sunlight (UV kills virus), almost everyone wearing masks (extremely important), touching, shared eating drinking, people reasonable distance ; actually makes sense . important learn cannot safely. Flight prices higher usual. Meanwhile, he‚Äôs fancy little bunker I‚Äôm talking article, I‚Äôm talking case counts protests. don‚Äôt need NPR article see obvious here. data far says wrong

I'm afraid never know: 

A. vast majority protestors young, first wave mostly invisible, 2nd 3rd manifest (3-4 weeks later!). then, it'll impossible track anything

B. major general uptick cases due variety reasons.

C. believe US traces anywhere near enough (if did, we'd case rise now)

D. and, indirect impact might even greater:
D1. people starting ignore distancing
D2. authorities going openings faster would otherwise Honestly, think main risk outdoor sporting events necessarily time people spent sitting stands (presuming somewhat spaced apart, wearing masks). It'd transportation took there, crowds waiting lines entry concessions, crowded public bathrooms poor ventilation. And, sports fan myself, think there'd much mask-wearing games unless strongly enforced.

The protests ‚Äì held outdoors, many people wearing masks moving quickly streets ‚Äì likely big transmission point themselves, given suspect transmission. since protests happened conjunction lot states/cities opening indoor businesses, seems natural wonder protests too. Preach. HIGHLY recommend following Linsey Marr Twitter. scientist mentioned article incredibly frustrating number scientists trying damndest proven wrong said early on. saying believe masks work study mentioned NY Times ""good science"". Considering situation, caused early on, need STFU. fact almost entirely comes American scientists go TV every night take reactionary stance U.S. msm taken telling, much, any, research people involved helping seeking fill parts puzzle order save lives without even fooling thinking we'll entire picture single ""perfect"" study. 

The ""I f***in Love Science"" crowd U.S. actually love science. love ""right"". certainly love science service saving lives kind humility, otherwise message pumped news every night would specific post regarding likely places situations contract COVID 19.

And fact now, spite millions cases U.S. AMPLE opportunities contradict ""old"" studies two months ago - usual suspects appear every article: South Korean call center, Oregon Church Choir Practice, restaurant Wuhan, etc - provided single example theories action. Meanwhile, country used studies guidance already knew masks worked mask culture. them, confirmation continue culture. countries, shit studies say ""incomplete"" ""largely uncorroborated"" ""bad science"". recognized dealing potential millions deaths, inference based outbreak study like call center good enough emphasize airborne transmission well surface... especially respiratory illness. 

As type this, Rachel Maddow saying U.S. get virus control economy like countries did. part reason see anyone else devoting hour specifics rapidly evolving attitude towards airborne transmission. Things countries seem understood months ago. Instead, she'll everyone else - shame people beachgoing attending family get togethers ignoring indoor places work likely never closed many states experiencing new outbreaks. extra light water lift drink one hand? Ironic, us afford accidents and/or get sick normal circumstances.

USA! USA! 

/s absolutely agree you. think people losing sight big picture. Children caught learn skills later, live long enough so. yes emotionally socially tough well, again, health lives worth it.  US big stupid. going get many die end year. next summer foreseeable future life hold. Don‚Äôt travel say goodbye everything you‚Äôve enjoyed won‚Äôt thanks selfish people want go life like ain‚Äôt happening. Fuck trump anyone listens him. doesn‚Äôt care experts. could dealing lowering numbers god forbid stock market falls!! ducking stock market sick dying. 

Sorry I‚Äôm mad government they‚Äôre fucking everything up. needed burn steam. 

Also vote, call hold elected officials accountable, donate means make voice heard help. It‚Äôs cliche change wanna see. far, trump made exactly wrong choice every decision. far, party backed up, every one decisions. Stupid decisions cost hundred thousand lives tens trillions dollars. Almost deaths could prevented, almost costs could avoided.

Both Florida Senators, Scott Rubio, finally said people wear masks.  think either sense morals values, cares people, trump. least beginning say right words.

The senators congressmen still power override trump. pass bill requires everyone wear masks, funds testing contact tracing, things needed.  recent statements might indication provisions might next Coronavirus Relief Bill, next month. assumes flu go lockdown. area, ICUs empty March, April, May old people trying die flu. one catching flu one interacting. Silver lining guess...  Forgive ignorance, circumstances? Bad health care? Honestly that‚Äôs complete bs Good point. bet lot learn large, outdoor, public events. mean, kind hoping protests cause much COVID spread, might mean outdoor sports arenas could safer think. entire article didn‚Äôt say anything kind study protesters. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt spread like we‚Äôve seen parties do‚Äù study. It‚Äôs click bait Fuck it. Make New England/New York country wall rest country. Canada come chill too. I‚Äôve been. It‚Äôs really nice town. wouldn‚Äôt want subjected overriding ideology there. current carriers skewing younger late therefore death rate would lower spread rate higher, accounting projected slower death toll, taking account

  Especially Palo Alto area missed point, generally speaking. humans find dumb situations intelligence. made bad decisions make frequently learn them? learn get better you‚Äôre intelligent. Unfortunately opinion good portion humanity doesn‚Äôt learn decisions mistakes. Seriously! 10 new cases covid days ago, cant believe NY sucha great job reversing curve states friggin ruin cause couldnt wait bit longer wear masks, hope theyre happy breathing straw! appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* #Please, stop testing like right now

s/ Good him. lot respect saying fucking Eagletonians again? deal? Allegedly... paid $800 orange popsicle kiddo. Good thing pay $1800 month insurance would cost more. could called asymptomatic yet one suffering pneumonia? one 67% damage lungs better believe pain sputum involved.  Given best available information IFR, age distribution, yes think would get 80% seroprevalence.

Edit I‚Äôm idiot Chill still less 1% mortality. gather safely outdoors, masks, properly distanced. possibly, also going end hitting lot less vulnerable well. honestly still early fully tell. There's bunch excess heart attacks stuff hard hit areas well I'm sure they're even checking covid, despite covid causing high blood pressure heart attacks/strokes. going take deep analytical dive like, 4-6 months really see rates hospitalization, death, complications, etc really are. _Turduckenporkeef_ I‚Äôm Cali. guys didn‚Äôt finish school online? kids did. ask send school, I‚Äôm switching homeschooling. consider survival part education. barely deaths lack ICUs, Manaus city approach 100%. still less deaths United States east coast, totals proportionally Scorched earth method Good he's preparing future job pest control. ""fuck you, want"" contingent ensure happen, unfortunately. Ya. I'm bit sarcastic lot people agree called ""Chinese virus."" truth, care point? investigate China later, let's stop spread now. Dallasites worse. say one. think ICU IV poles, programmable vital monitors, sedation medication, code equipment. common (if universally available) medical surgical floors. Kaboomtown LMAO. Yeah comes Corona, KABOOM ! Yeah, fuck around, get results! Show proven? sources CDC say isn‚Äôt enough evidence unless wearing grade filtered mask it‚Äôs protection unknown. I‚Äôm mandating masks public transport supermarkets groups (key word) people choice. Countdown ... I'm fabricating shit. Houston part unsustainable surge capacity 12 days. Austin san Antonio far behind. Why? Bc assholes wanted get haircut drink bars. Blood hands. Traveling sounds highly unlikely even far out. first started assumed would ebb throughout summer peak early fall, looks like we're headed second peak already, means fall early winter going brutal, flu season starting.  wanted convince correct comment lost failed so. workplace same, 2 months TBH corona thing could go forever, ended it.  Mandate masks. Tell businesses let people work home. Close bars.

It‚Äôs rocket science. misread ""a little Trump steak"". Email her. did. Fuck lady. She‚Äôs hurting people. Yep, exactly feels. coworker caught covid-19, paid hundreds pocket get rapid test make sure unknowingly expose patients passed us (by miracle one else tested positive yet) still week offered work home reduced number telehealth patients keep team getting overwhelmed pressuring telehealth treatments fighting active covid infection. I'm starting almost wish another lockdown force back unemployment I'm stressed. ü§î literally said cancelling elective procedures kill people. 

Abbot cancel COVID19. 

If handled Covid19 instead hiding heads sand back stalling elective procedures. Given Federal system, much blame apportion failed response local, state Federal governments? much reserve individuals, non-profits private sector? great night! You‚Äôre definitely going choice. know big districts going leave parents choose TX. I‚Äôd imagine states choose option logistics distancing. fair, surprised anyone higher high school diploma willing live Yakima. would funny sad many people sub spent past month scolding people daring bring concerns pandemic called doomers otherwise summarily dismissed. thing makes sad reporting thing going take away tragedy families communities face. Maybe public believes reporting maybe ""history"" gets written thing got by, reality hundreds thousands people dying stories honoured. they're honoured ridiculous disrespectful pride. Orange County Sheriff would like remember all, ""Amierca! Fuck yeah!""

And ""America.... give fuck."" like 50/50 live die get point need ventilator?  Never pass chance make much want downplay health crisis. stick able buy cheap beachfront property time next year.

Thanks Florida! lives lead... Yes. absolute despair anger. It‚Äôs rough hell. Grief exhaustion? Exhausted grief? don‚Äôt know call it, hate it. Yikes. that's case honestly would let back house unless he's quarantined two weeks negative covid test. He's putting severely risk. correct answer thousands people rioting without masks fighting police see mentioned post.

It surprising people well educated internet users fall obvious wonder people survived 1918 flu also mental symptoms years following... Interesting theory. video.. enjoy..[lewis county sheriff Fuck yeah MA. Keep good work friends, thank Governor Baker taking thing serious super transparent everything beginning. Thank slow, careful reopening process well. rest People continued success. 

Don‚Äôt let guard fellow residents. Let‚Äôs keep thing bay show reopening actually done right. Northeast general seems pretty good. 

Now protect south/west.  Cold/Flu season full swing though known secondary diseases people die from.  Remember ""the pivot"". happen day now. government wasn‚Äôt worthless economy wasn‚Äôt flimsy bubble pop something like universal basic income place, lockdown needed would fine. People needing work food shelter main reason lockdown doesn‚Äôt work well currently. Well selfish assholes would rather risk people‚Äôs lives get little bored. boring people get bored. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  Pretty sure it‚Äôs 1% based looking data countries extensive testing  dismissing giant obvious difference. Outside vs inside. honestly dont feel like rehashing CDC lecture pressure differential outside means virus disperses nearly immediately atmosphere. Inside virus trapped. 

People outside wearing masks shown spread disease easily. saying China covered things reason wear masks?

Wouldn‚Äôt cover massive investment stopping virus country cause take precautions even seriously? There's clinical research masks effective public health measure pandemic. Still btw. says right plan. Also talks PPE shortages, could encourage people think masks panacea worse, promote one, encouraging take dangerous risks ignoring public health measures ""to protect economy"". last little bit made up, seems pretty plausible. Poor babies. agree. I‚Äôm saying know sure. I‚Äôm pointing permanent immunity determined. 

Therefore, herd immunity may may good concept. Hey, season affect outcome? people inside winter thus less spread summer? Cant find anything google I‚Äôm healthcare. I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs supposed free definitely free people don‚Äôt insurance. like COVID person doesn‚Äôt insurance can‚Äôt billed don‚Äôt pay co-pay. lovely caring pockets egos constantly change rules.  Well leaders Mexico Brazil really caring it‚Äôs surprise Bigots wouldn‚Äôt call HIV ‚ÄúSub-Saharan Virus‚Äù, they‚Äôd call ‚ÄúGay Virus‚Äù. Giving U.S. run money.... anti-prepare

This really best way put it. It‚Äôs fault dumbass many tests localized, actually test ENTIRE neighborhood district find cases.

I wish US efficient tbh Thanks much input! Probably company managers look ratings. Notice talk COVID much protests? New media outlets businesses make money catering particular audiences bring ad revenue, nothing more. really. Market based approach assumes profit motive prime directive. plenty studies economic papers explaining muuuch costly route allowing virus burn country unfettered. although short term may seem rough, economic damage subsequent recovery far worse scenario, actively mitigate virus. 

We taking politicized info-wars approach. everything actions messaging trump ilk. People conned thinking it‚Äôs hoax, joke, whatever else (it‚Äôs actually extremely eye opening - easily large groups people completely manipulated). political con man approach, market based approach. refuse change support Entire country needs go r/Masks4All unfortunately pushback extreme. I've heard ""accidents"" Russia much higher. wouldn‚Äôt people get vast majority surgeries later? Maybe get one less shot Botox, hip needs replacing doesn‚Äôt heal didn‚Äôt get surgery. course people move die get surgery many. Unfortunately can't kick people disregarded public safety guidelines care everything right still got sick. There's real human cost living next ignorant neighbors. Nothing like sharing post subscribe to. üòí get behind that. give shits sports, entertainment love affected. empathy others love things.  Americans disgusted people acting? live conservative area everything's open. Yet, nobody wears masks even shame do. Store owners afraid enforce mask ordinance want cause political scuffles. 

I feel like I'm living twilight zone. people ignorant? Yikes seems like bad thing.  I'm sorry hear that. dark time right ways there's always silver lining. 

We live life two ways; constantly worrying axe going fall ceiling accept axe always ceiling carry lives.

I wish family best! &lt;3 always cover expenses. keep trying prove wrong? can't believe disabled people struggling even now? elective procedures going kill ppl? Wtf talking about? Go away. nuts. containment!

The Chinese hyper efficient try I‚Äôll tell ya that... Good! Hope goes full r/Masks4All Huh?  Relax, buzzkill mcknow-it-all. Everyone knows meant safely getting everyone infected covid. seem problem wearing proven protective measure spread highly contagious virus?

bottom line: reduces spread. 6 weeks virus would crushed. I‚Äôm you. I‚Äôm hanging friend tomorrow (on apt balcony outdoors) socializing calendar weeks. I‚Äôm aware. justify giving shit others? wait they're NOWWWW necessary? before? Thanks, appreciate comment. Well 1/4 ICU beds cancer patients. ICU overrun cancer? leader wasnt worried making buck really. saying shutdown 6 month old brown dog killed neglect? seeing correlation. Explain it. test batches. areas low prevalence? Politics cancer  hope white house staff catches .. AZ resident here. looking forward things 80 days going work grocery store.

Unfortunately Arizonans seem pretty fucking stupid. 

What's another 3 months suppose.. lot measures implemented everywhere CYA give population peace mind, really keep virus out. Temperature checks sanitizing surfaces every 5 mins mainly show, since almost 50% spread asymptomatic presymptomatic carriers close contact others. - absolutely is. promise you, alone. Millions us sitting there, wondering nothing sounds good anymore.

I'm moderately hyped Cyberpunk2077. finishing Death Stranding. feeling it.

Yeah chocolate ice cream make whole ton stuff better. Wine too. not? US prison system inhumane. I'm aware. Elective surgery simply means scheduled. seeing backlash lockdown. double edged sword.

Edit: elective surgery definition Wait, need hear Kaboomtown secret whereabouts? it? move? people find it? idea is, pandemic I'd urge go based solely name! like life ... sports entertainment completely nonessential 

no one yet died watching NBA ignore cough! 

This. found lung cancer 2 coughs day. planning ignore it, wife insists checkup. That's found. Healthy body normally cough. Right.  use skills plan massive criminal enterprise must kept secret election must involve co-conspirators representatives significant number states perform actions massively skew results election way raises question results legitimate.

Sure.

If going that, he'd probably tell everyone speech day election. something like that. places live. Usually local store, chain. Massachusetts lot small local liquor stores like old shit sure. doubt. turn away even confirmed positive COVID. Don‚Äôt delay care truthful take proper precautions. Shit right, America‚Äôs problems tendency become Canada‚Äôs problems unfortunately.   lololol Stirike 3 Least well able get hair cut can't figure bodies. guys think George would oligarch mandated police state y‚Äôall fuckin drunk. hell people celebrate year? best worst country world handling pandemic? stay fuck home unless necessary, hard that? Port Houston... imagine us going another shutdown??? wonder Pence making visit next week.... see bad really here. America, despite memes, extremely comprehensive great healthcare system - dumb expensive. US (has) ICU beds per capita country - though Germany built mid way, I'm sure counted newly built beds mobilized hospitals US - might 2nd now.

When looked top prepared countries healthcare quality, US #1. failures entirely outside healthcare system, we're poorly despite healthcare quality, it.

edit: clarify, possible (and likely) various states/hospitals correctly reporting deaths - whether malicious not. extremely difficult correctly track things. patient dies Covid, complications high likelihood death regardless, count Covid? countries/states say yes, say no. doubt places misreport numbers family literally lost inheritance due grandfather's prolonged medical care (around 1 year total, last 4-5 months really bad). Total, 1mil pocket home care covered insurance. worth keep home much possible, considering money, I'm going complain. uncle hand...

As much hate say it, timed death well. looking selling car pay next week in-home care. Medicare supplemental commercial insurance. Trust me, baffling stupefying us drank Kool-Aid. Every day confronted stark reality horrifying terrible fellow humans are. America cesspool. morons refusing wear masks social distance share blame. saw mom first time three months didn‚Äôt even hug her, stayed 6‚Äô apart. She‚Äôs 60 former smoker, can‚Äôt risk it. It‚Äôs hard, it‚Äôs duty relative keep safe possible. I‚Äôll take ‚ÄúHow bad fucked?‚Äù $1000 Alex. got really lucky last year. unemployed like 4 months got job IT. time unemployed still working playing soccer even though insurance. 

I playing soccer two weeks job got slide tackled behind heard huge pop new something wrong right away. Ended ACL, MCL Meniscus well fractured tibia required screw. 

5 days surgery big time stomach pain. Like ridiculous non-relenting constant level 10 pain. ended getting bath helped knew something wrong. live 3 morning I'm grown man tub crying. read online needed gatorade pep bismol get car drive 7/11. 

I crutches bc knee surgery barely get car buy gatorade. remember waiting counter incredibly bright 7/11 grimacing pain waiting guy working come counter probably half asleep back. wonder thought standing red eyed, shaking sweating buying peptol bismol 3 morning. 

The gatorade pepto helped felt little better started driving home. hit me... puke like right now. 

I jumped curb onto grass median puke brains out. Thinking optics puking side road 3am thursday night miles bars downtown good thing doing. cops rolled would probably die stomach pain side road. 

By point know I'm screwed up. hands totally numb cold sweats. know need get hospital like right now. start driving ER. first stopping lights end drive I'm driving red lights. face going numb stomach ripping pain. 

I park crutch ER. get wheel chair ask questions assume bc recent surgery constipated. 

After getting back find appendix needs come ASAP I'm rushed emergency surgery. wake next day alone hospital room one knew drove ER 3am. 

I get bill hospital days later $36,000 second surgery. recall exactly much knee surgery I'm assuming $12k $15k. 

If stuff would happened two weeks earlier would totally screwed insurance. leadership. It‚Äôs shut office door blame people front lines everything. 7-day rolling average US new cases. Right column daily difference. Typically stops increasing half way peak bottom. really looking scary, know high peaks, going go time.

Even cases drop 3-4 weeks behind new hospitalizations. yet see China level hospital collapses rate U might say....

üòé

It's rich taste?

YEAHHHH Adding I'd say also lot first world countries done well covid. First Vietnam.

You need biggest economy world convince people wear home made masks (and see wearing masks one important things one least economical impacts measures) It‚Äôs going like scene Jumanji checked twitter praising two days ago coronavirus response. even went far ask dr. Fauci gets credit pence lol. Âä†Ê≤π‚úä got told thing employer. first said take long want. say come back fired. is. specifics. Thanks! Wife went slow heart rate. athletic lacking nutrients fast. 45 minutes, 2 supplement pills, ekg, IV ‚Äî $3000. Ralphs. tried distance people, impossible kept walking straight sides.

That's national stop testing day. RIP Houston. Join club yeah, beign worried would work tending down, up. It‚Äôs next Taiwan. 

It‚Äôs chip, fuck Taiwan ir help Taiwan take Hawaii Also full shit. DOUBLE cases per million nearest Midwestern State (IL) deaths per million least 300% higher Midwestern state. mean smoked record last second? I‚Äôve stopped trying explain people. Lol  Ok saying medical standard singles gay people, that's still bad Maybe work CDC. wait tomorrow, it‚Äôll back alarming. still couple weeks deaths start surpass Northeast, there's that. this. numbers agree expert opinions I've seen cholera example brilliant (I wish thought tbh)  big part even care one not; spread misinformation downplay everything that's going on. would probably beneficial didn't. 

We need hear nation's top health officials, completely removed politics situation. supply that. Sure much cases before. testing states open. CDC says confirmed cases√ó10 actual number. Maybe lived Willow Glen Campbell. keep us people Mask use Chicago neighborhood dropping worrying. completely confused, China including people employed told us coming. Pentagon warned coming briefed POTUS several times. 

POTUS jack instead stuck normal Magical Thinking telling everyone would happen here. did, always coming here, left playbook created Bush administration updated Obama administration. ignored whole thing want hurt economy reelection chances. 

The dumbest part listened professionals done suggested could coasted reelection good economy shown could handle big stuff. Instead acted like always thought here. Blood donations rely self attestation donors. expensive test blood. single blood bag already costs ~$300. There's things can't test for, expensive test for. rely donor saying healthy engaged risky behavior. ineligible, turn keep blood supply safe can. articles say 80-90% Houston. may US average. Hear cowboys cowgirls ? 


You thank Trump November.  current rate, per capita, aren't. Also, deleted /r/coronavirus post, knock *no longer visible anyone already comment* comment. No, assumption governor AZ never close again. could lose 500 people day, close. crisis managed Fox News. turn, leadership infinite protection. Fox financial incentive change tune.

This leaders sacrificing us like spearman wall tanks. That's cause. evidence virus directly attacking brain cells structures, simply symptom hypoxia. username literally monk philosophy u argue entertainment necessary lmao Bye Texas. Bye Arizona. Bye Florida. Y‚Äôall fucked up. Majorly.

I Arizona weeks ago family. run Walmart mom. drove parking lot. Put mask still cart. Tightened fucker TIGHT. walked Arizona Walmart.

Not one mask. one. Single. Mask. Worn dozens patrons Walmart. It‚Äôs fucking terrifying.

There‚Äôs reason Hong Kong, THEEEEE densely populated regions WORLD, 1,000 cases. 

Wear fucking fuck masks. Take seriously hopefully rest us learn Houston objectively fucked up.

I hope guys come this. safe Houston-ites. mean, 9/11 conspiracy, necessarily conspiracy involving United States government. month. stay away, get came for, try leave quickly possible. America, land crazy people guns, get shot trying get someone wear mask Target. Damn, good thing numbers climbing. Right? Right? reopenings protests. think fill also. Time follow lead. ppl homes next year that's exciting! tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow... 2 months Covid loving America. What‚Äôs saying ... fish barrel? Southeastern Virginia. far, mask wearing pretty decent. even show pretends he‚Äôs nice it, it‚Äôs called shark tank.

....I'm seeing problem here. saying companies investors? Aw, love show. Zim's top; great. lol. China charge United States? ü§î for? Stupid comment. Ohio mild bump stayed pretty steady Anyone better basic math skills make decent projections. Hell, moving average based last weeks growth numbers beating half models used. can't *roll back* reopening, understand Amerifats need bland fast food pretense everything okay?

Really, Americans live mired falsehoods: live fake, stucco houses deluding thinking anything valuable; eat bland, company-churned imitation food believe lucky compared rest world; healthcare educational systems utter jokes, pretend they're actually top-notch peace mind. wonder Trump over. Haha! grew Ohio, five minutes outside Huntington, WV thirty minutes outside Ashland, KY. southern drawl real. sister moved Cincinnati excited city girl, would lose drawl temporarily came back home visit. could hear creep back voice. ElOn GoNnA sAve hUManItY pretty confused statistic, 40 percent people get put ventilator? going lot people carrying guilt. feel bad them. fucking careless stupid one deserves carry that. 

I feel worse ones spread loved ones early on, lockdowns social distancing started, much chance, like people spread loved ones lived with. Except autocrats wield power what's best people, wield power collect power, emergency cause restricting people's civil liberties (see: Hong Kong). There's trusting coming China publicly. 


The US certainly bungled messaging part response, also bungled nearly everything else. That's democracy (lots democracies proved capable putting together cohesive, unified response, Japan, Germany, etc.). Unfortunately point representative democracy appoint someone equipped represent what's best interests US government right now, especially leading executive branch. say Sweden....

Foreplay important rearplay turn around walk way. Physically distancing ASAP best response. Confrontation potentially fatal may attack you, tattling useless interaction staff already sees too.

Best shuffle away them. substantially people wearing masks rioting let's try compare two. Substantially death caused rioting.

Stop. I'm going shame masks. argument though? Fucking ridiculous. US warnings rest world, ignored still continue ignore them. Don‚Äôt blame China governments shitty response. Show Sweden says fucked.

Tegnell said YESTERDAY lockdowns ""madness"".

Sweden's hospitalizations deaths peaked MONTHS ago. They've consistently falling every week since then. side globe watch silent horror. Stay safe. Yeah full 28% COVID. I‚Äôm sure what‚Äôs alarming here.

Also, ones said many beds have. alarming post title cool. faith country right now. still divided everything. 2nd wave 1918 flu killed young people first time turn head certain way flat / Yes, bootstraps yadda yadda! 

They earned it! that's disagree. think every life given chance. care random strangers. don't. can't convince to. lucky. He'll stick around work OANN something; rid dies. Simple solution. Make human health profitable.

Every covid case result business makes liable full medical care direct cases tha individual. 1 guy gets sick passes 4 more, pay full medical 5.

Open afford insurance. safe, fine. see businesses suddenly hiring guards enforce masks. fall out-safe other. Maybe similar Nigerian 419 scams work.

They're atrociously obviously scammy gullible idiotic people fall it. fall it, hook, line sinker. Here's California's latest case/death chart, 7-day hospitalizations start tracking cases, things go south pretty quickly. Yes, link article statement recorded. expect people believe comment actual newspaper? Someone told lie, true? moronic pay people's healthcare private insurance. That's like... insurance works. difference paid state provide healthcare also paying salaries bunch corporate middlemen. m8 think learn damned they‚Äôre gonna wipe tshirts One states much better virus. wonder difference is? still take people away hotels converted gyms test positive? ....so saying plan give away billions dollars save millions taxes get kids jobs pay hundreds thousands? seem like solid strategy. Looks like missed part ""read"" article:

""The workers, Carlos Gabriel Jessica Naro, said received notices last week Tesla‚Äôs human resources department citing apparent failure show company‚Äôs inability reach them. workers provided evidence continuing correspondence managers. believe received notifications speaking [concerns working conditions plant."" It‚Äôs even ‚Äúif maybe‚Äù friend. everyone try harder stayed smart 100% never would way. Human behavior big factor this, it‚Äôs unfortunate apparently live nation selfish babies others work hard actually right thing. stand secure homes ample entertainment unimagineable 25 years ago.

Well fucking said mate. Also quoting emphasis one early Asian breakout countries (Singapore Korea) similar chip couple months ago? Wonder happened that.  Glare back safe. don‚Äôt go drinking eating indoors, especially crowds. Can‚Äôt wear mask. Think different MLB NFL regards close contact. sad say it, see NFL happening. theory, elections meant represent consensus.

Unfortunately, virus raging November sitting president likely get way require in-person voting only. People highly concerned seriousness virus unlikely risk crowded area cast vote one among millions.

As result, November election likely ""consensus"" among less concerned virus. lost whopping 371 lives covid last week

This moronic. Florida *alone* reported 181 deaths week June 14-June others pointed out, CDC update numbers automatically.

&amp;#x200B;

People absolutely worried causes death. think cancer research (for thousands types cancer subsets get...ie. breast cancer ""one"" cancer itself), HIV research, research labs dedicate researching vaccines these, ebola, etc. Man, supposed happen March. They‚Äôre way ahead experts said.  ['Nobody knew health care could drove Houston month ago check used car Chevy dealership salesman basically told entire thing hoax. Also, person entire dealership wearing mask, incredibly busy like probably 20-30 people waiting inside there. surprised news ALL. Like boxer/ufc fighter fighting weight class ill prepared. ~~stupid~~ *greedy* be

They're paid big bucks look way. truly selfish, you? country needs wake fuck up; let's hope upcoming, avoidable deaths again. It‚Äôs tough kids. want toddler see grandparents it‚Äôs doable safely. She‚Äôs old enough walk know wants try break distancing freak out, she‚Äôs old enough understand needing hang grandpa grandma little apart yard. grandfather died pneumonia like symptoms, parents coronavirus deniers, decided keep body chest freezer pandemic report natural death - think he'll used govt number perpetuate hoax. I'm sure tens thousands cases like grandfathers. Deaths still climbing Florida. expect see change? surprised It‚Äôs officially begun... ‚Äúpause,‚Äù mean anything Ducey? know it‚Äôs politically ‚Äúcool‚Äù share social media since anonymous admit need/want reopen lot complex ‚Äúa bunch billionaires wanting work minimum wage workers death‚Äù? 

Im ‚Äúfrontline worker‚Äù hasn‚Äôt started working yet (gym) make WAY unemployment +600 I‚Äôm dying get back. Even slow reopen state done great mood I'm go back self isolation worth it.. I'm ga city im seeing spikes hospitals rocked.im staying ass house duration.i understand ppl really protest wearing mask point..like hurt head trying understand wrap head around it. large companies need capital raises every six months keep lights LOL CNN MSNBC bad. completely biased care putting politics virus rather actually giving us facts. Honestly media nowadays shitshow. theres still single day 50k news cases ahead us, betcha Former? step down? hadn‚Äôt heard sad it‚Äôs true. poor medical leaders taking brunt it‚Äôs insane. literally trying SAVE lives! you? What's going different next year? rush reopen caused it, also people fought lockdown tooth nail go damn shopping sprees it. ones wailing loudest. even try short weeks.  slavery okay could make fresh undies cotton picked. quality care drop some, relatively.

This probably ""surge capacity"" means practice. They're putting everyone available frontline, even they're quite normally want running around ICU. 

Unsustainable surge capacity they're working double shifts every day. people luxury. people live assisted living facilities example. Obviously much testing. Also nobody knew virus contagious. average ICU occupancy rate world's largest medical center 70 80 percent, higher rates unheard of.  completely normal us ICU capacities run 80s 90s,"" Methodist Hospital CEO Dr. Marc Boom said. ""That's hospitals operate."" live world values money people. think bad now, wait till open schools. can't next Tuesday. Sorry. Wow, things getting bad again. seen daily discussion post hit 800+ comments day now. swear even saw days within past 2-3 weeks maxed 400 comments.  Kinda wonder would warrant high level alarm.... aliens? trumpets?? Sounds like work.... ""Stay home feeling sick"" proceeds write staying home three times six months. I'm bitter. 

At least kick fit went get tested.... get stay home quarantined results back can't say shit.  TMC name one hospital area 60+ medical institutions. It‚Äôs basically city hospitals Houston, largest kind world. Houston? Looks like South Houston. NFL fan (and devout 49ers fan), I'm extremely disappointed season looking like going cancelled. Still, wonder much better must go lets say 15 years ago. much home, found much reason go outside last months. without football, many things watch play. Also, anyone else looking sports watch, check esports. There's ton games really fun watch even know nothing them. teen already bitchin school fall. Wait till hears this. cold war stuck repeat, endless competition win stupid prizes. okay doctors countries also research subject? NY fucked front lines thing. saw coming countries, new York really US getting hit without ready. months seeing virus do, states time get ready, fully aware coming. chose scenario way new York didn't. Activated! Elective surgical patients generally take bed ICU unless things went wrong somewhere. even continue see elective cases, floors hospital converted take overflow ICU patients regular ward patients end taken care clinic doctors, on. Freaks that‚Äôs much contact it‚Äôs cautious? regular ICU beds Texas Medical Center used, according numbers released [TMC officials say add more.

Hospitals Houston's Medical Center move ICU patients beds normally used critical care.

Twenty-eight percent ICU patients treated COVID-19.

Despite reaching surge capacity, four hospital CEOs said Thursday there's cause ""unwarranted alarm."" They‚Äôll save em swing states problem there's lag time acquiring disease needing hospitalization -- anywhere 2 days 2 weeks. would concerning could press pause virus spread single new person caught -- instead what's happening spread rate **doubling** short period time (a days best).

So unfortunately, they're full right now. Tomorrow they'll start new patients new wave infections happened 2-14 days ago, next couple days number double, next couple days it'll double again, again. ""we're quite full right now, bad"" scenario turns tidal wave new patients, wont stop unless spread stops.

But stopping spread insanely hard. What's realistic go scenario hospitals overflowing every days number new patients doubles, scenario every days number patients increases amount before. STILL BAD OUTCOME!

The time act 2 weeks ago. Nobody tell bad shit show get, lived Houston would prepare shelter place order. Lol. wife sent article said medical center plenty beds article used ‚Äúprove‚Äù covid thing blown proportion media. reason bed space putting ICU patients non ICU beds. turning regular med/serg beds ICU beds literally don‚Äôt space covid patients. It‚Äôs crazy paracetamol

Paracetamol term exist US. call ""Tylenol"" ""acetaminophen"". I'm grad student back person class days week. Everyone wears masks building take instantly outside. almost 50 class future health care providers, 10 us seem taking seriously. would 6% US Yeah also refuse treat anyone gets car accident speeding, treatment. you‚Äôre fat heart attack, treatment. engage dangerous sport get injured, treatment. Commit crime get injured process, sorry treatment. love South, especially Georgia. people great, beautiful, Savannah prettiest city entire east coast. god damn southern states run morons lunatics, they're basically third world countries propped functioning states. least, make socially acceptable wear mask work ill, cut spread workplace disease TON.

Like, we're smart this, use crisis save lives normally lost influenza pneumonia future well. activities also lots food sharing. We‚Äôre big potluck buffets family South. I‚Äôm sure find places shuffle patients, patient rooms huge, put 4 room comfortably

Who actually take care patients tucked away random corners? physical bed arguably least important part problem. There's also specialized equipment (ventilators, example), supplies (PPE, drugs, etc.; one NYC hospital almost ran paralytics, means able intubate), and, importantly, trained personnel. It‚Äôs really love/hate.

It‚Äôs like unconditionally love unconditionally hate. Prolly there's like 5 people live Wyoming. live Sacramento County, there's literally twice many people live Wyoming. know even state. makes Texas major cities immune exponential growth?

American exceptionalism 

/s assume everyone work everywhere else, including local family members, coronavirus time.

I mask distance sterilize much possible time. every activity grocery shopping getting gas work. catch eventually since work close retail environment without mask enforcement patrons I‚Äôm everything avoid it.

I factors make pretty high risk hospital stay possibly death. Tired think minimizing contagion risks time.

I glad live alone don‚Äôt worry catching housemates stupid things like going parties bars.  20+ days experience, deaths bring average though. Medical suspensions don‚Äôt crack Swallowing pride little? idiot. shouldn‚Äôt politicizing pandemic. Y‚Äôall cry moan government politicizing virus thing talking virus. Politicizing virus leads misinformation biased news articles. maybe [it like 2008 housing crash big financial institutions started buying dying Eh that's infection fatality rate .75% might sound low actually really bad still. That's way higher anything else widely circulating within US population (would still 75 times worse flu) wtf stupid amercians country wearing masks 3 months since corona outbreak studies telling us half covid deaths arent covid? fucking dare report facts you. PayPal launch pad. co-founding it, sold like 1.5 billion eBay. point article least one county aren‚Äôt tracing cases protests tracing tons parties.

If we‚Äôre gonna hand wave say probably, indoor drinking parties without masks ‚Äúprobably‚Äù contribute lot outdoor protests people masked. ‚ÄúI could stand middle fifth avenue shoot someone...‚Äù -DJT describing loyalty ‚Äúhis people‚Äù.
Might true statement ever made. Person goes beach:

Coronavirus sub: ""We're going diiieee!"" they‚Äôre already easy spot - idiots wearing mask takes one person ""speaking name God"". Could preacher; could friend; message like cancer, can't pinpoint came from, see spread. stay home avoid direct contact others. 

This hard. rent people need money for. unemployment issue fixed matter what. Figures already mentioned. regular circumstances 0.5 1%, triage / overwhelmed medical system circumstances 8 12%. Varies regionally course since lot factors gap average 0.75% 10% enormous comparison health care system profit system. reason shit immediately. Lul called bullied 

Same Admin types told nurses doctors wear n95 masks would lower patient satisfaction scores. third? live Florida, much higher that. ""Doctors find...""

Was research lost going ignore research came China? disabled person, confirm business usual. isn‚Äôt business usual number people experiencing due specifically vulnerable Covid-19. hope experience inspire lot covid-vulnerable people aren‚Äôt disabled help us disabled folks gain visibility access life general said done. Most, fireworks cancelled Michigan understand. Even conservative west side state. antibodies last three months mean vaccines last three months? global pandemic makes outlook pretty shit. Taiwan 0 cases like 2 months  would jammed yogurt face hard she‚Äôd toppings gray matter. 

She fucking lowest pig I‚Äôve even seen. would make exactly expected range .5-1% precisely issue: people think things they‚Äôve heard passing level knowledge scientist might gain truly researching something. also equate research done scientist googling something calling research. 


It‚Äôs horrifying. stark differences things don‚Äôt understand that. Trump vengeful fuck. One Dr. thinks doubtful. Others think likely. knows. know sure end July Doctors guessed correctly win prize. It‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt airtight though. pretty close airtight..you know exact opposite airtight Nice try. cares. inner monologue doesn‚Äôt much value.

I‚Äôll bet try‚Äôs cure sauna. matter many times look got shot scientists doctors healing effects steam kept bringing back up. 

He‚Äôs like century late whole science reason table.

Be trying cure baldness uranium laudanum suppositories next. Studies showing outdoor protests + mask = nowhere near risky eating indoors 25% filled restaurant immunity lasts 3-4 months infection, herd immunity may never happen. Well......somebody's cat (I actually cat) buildup virus enclosed spaces means people breath far less it. Makes total sense. not? We‚Äôve learned nothing. Depends quickly create vaccine then. do, quickly mass produced, shipped, administered little ironic Texas lockdown weeks CARES unemployment expires, one R‚Äôs insisted would never extended. D‚Äôs need play hardball tell pass HEROS act bust, since nuts flame right now.  Maine would say mask use 60% I've seen. Sadly lot people wearing properly. confirm. work. beautiful theres also massive paper product plant well reason. Honestly makes perfect sense. order hurt greater economy, infringement everyone's day day individual liberties, punishes specifically groups making noise coronavirus resurgence governor gets say he's something it. Outdoors ppe = low risk.
Indoors without ppe = high risk.

This shaping up. Leadership absolutely place. low class. Kinda meaningless. case registered new cases. case deaths.  Conflicting groundbreaking common sense  **FOXNEWS SMUG REPORTING CAUSING SPIKES CORONAVIRUS** remember can‚Äôt see people adhering common sense physical distancing. They‚Äôre inside. 

I return work, going anywhere else; groceries contactless pickup. work research lab half coworkers present (4 people total). wear masks maintain physical distance, sometimes quickly pass one another moving around lab; hold breath that. hope practices low risk. AC also single-pass air aren‚Äôt breathing others air day. K

I'm enabling mass cruelty, socially isolating house since late February, dipshits crash country sink like much Titanic reckless behavior, voting included?

OK, yep. I'm problem. me. That‚Äôs odd response said? would even give idea thought that? I'm scared may simply given nation. long fighting, really mind numbers, give say, ""who cares 300 million get infected""......... counting bad post history 

I appreciate wrote ""downvotes aren‚Äôt source."" truly hope rest world watching close, viewing sick twisted underbelly rotten nation.

We are, whole lot morbid fascination.

On one hand, refreshing see Americans finally realise unexceptional actually are; hand, we're still receiving entertainment value large part America still looking blame anyone everyone else ineptitude. Well done. cat immune coronavirus Many people thre impression hotter states would ok virus would spread due heat. take account wear masks heat. Smh. wear mask. many ways Texas seems like place I'd like live. major cities seem great. many ways Texas seems like physical embodiment ""my ignorance valuable expertise"" brand anti-intellectualism. 25%? get number? 30% 45% story Houston‚Äôs ICU capacity believed hover around 80% ICU capacity used without COVID 19. mean they‚Äôre cases away needing locked time?

And ones decided kill anyone. exception President every states‚Äô political leadership went effort recommend promote social distancing mask use form. states phased reopenings varying levels success. New York hasn‚Äôt really done anything Extraordinary policy wise require masks public situations social distancing possible. it‚Äôs state experience results it‚Äôs seen reopening. 

*People* making decisions regarding health, obviously varying effects result. argue public health emergency, news lack people falling droves city streets due virus lead people side common sense. Well considering articles shitty messaging CDC are, along financial hardships already experienced combined appears little difference made could reasonably blame average Joe getting life? Deaths NY seemed spike fairly fast hospitalizations jumped know anyone who's aids MS or... get point. 

I still believe things exist. I‚Äôm genuinely worried Americans simply never accept second lock virus could end sweeping nation 500k+ dead January. fact getting spikes places right middle summer pretty forboding  I'm NorCal, explicitly told prepare close case growth exceeds hospitals comfortably handle. 

We surging, too, people kinds dumb shit that's happening TX.

But major difference governor problem saying ""no"" unreasonable reopening (No, Disney, can't reopen Disneyland, can't return indoor dining, can't refuse wear mask). 

And know lockdown comes, flatten curve. again. pulse like many times takes teach dumbest segment population get hip following rules (that dumbest segment population catches this). really sports problem. crowds. said, thought baseball boring people stands... right way late though. They're control two months ago getting annihilated virus.

The rest country seems following footsteps though - WITHOUT precautionary measures. Well Sweden released study stating IFR 0-69yrs old 0,09%. whole range. 

What means, young and/or healthy really much danger.

Which pretty much goes line information.

But nah, quarantine enthusiasts muzzlers rabid. Ya, said universities safe. Absurd. think panic. Staying calm seem help. Shore get libs telluwhut Sweet, thanks! period ""non-contagiousness""? Like, spread within day something? ask buddy saw within day contact infected next day saw dad father's day. said want use real airline though Good thing don‚Äôt go bars. case Bud light platinum friends cookout good enough me. Well COVID anyways. Seen much know play virus. misspelled deleted first one GOP fucking country.  one sues beauticians medical malpractice. California (four times population Sweden) less deaths Sweden despite tourism centric state  I‚Äôm liberal I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre assuming unconditionally support liberal people. suck knowing one listens cares.

You responded. yeah anything masturbate hard core supporters among vices like know somewhere poor person dying common cold younger bro's birthday last week, mine few. family party kitchen him. told friends mine feel bad/plan surprise all. 

My Aunt online funeral paternal father (not Grandad) passed away COVID recently. family attended television living room. brother (also uncle blood) two daughters recovering COVID themselves, clear.

I graduated two-bedroom apartment roomie dead-ass sunk bud damn pandemic. 

&amp;#x200B;

And got these, individuals, go party waiting coronavirus test results. *beyond* incensed stupidity nation Naw Fort Worth take credit one. Isnt last point kind obvious tho

If current system adversely affects wouldnt favor changing it?

And healthy wealthy part problem people top 1/5 population paying premium part point healthy person paying kind system wont always healthy

A lot like reasoning social security programs Huh seems like wasn‚Äôt choice choosing reopen vs locking everything down. hate leadership majority country right now. fucking sick failure government Like marching state capitols demanding somebody re-open economy? true panic. economy doesn‚Äôt recover time election? panic-driven motive behind irrational decisions pretend virus contained. numbers convince them.

Oh man. say thing climate change? 120,000 people dropping dead months convince someone take seriously, carefully crafted report peer reviewed best minds pandemic field ain't gonna jack shit. can't reason someone position reason into. go it, hoss. I'm sure everybody eager join big sporting event. sound really annoyed protestors gotten sick.

why? America whistleblower rights? ability whistleblow without fear fired, know UK Houstonian - yes say coming, assholes dont care. remote employee 12 years. wife essential employee. amount (if happens happens) astounds me. ourselves. 

The mayor failed us falling pressure, people houston failed other. least amount cases throughout Texas fucking are. What? Lot J shut due ""electrical problems"" something. day. means bunch people turned away one day nobody tested next day. means overall state Duval county numbers lower. watched News 4 Jax First Coast News last night.  obvious argument I'm saying really easy wear mask it. true easy, behavior neglects philosophical psychological implications event like this. Tyranny arises mostly easily face mass fear, tyrannical governments invest lot time money propaganda manipulates peoples fear giving lines reasoning justify consent manipulation

Could case. Could be. need skeptical people claiming protect us seem nearly intentionally failed almost every possible way fact CO2 concentrations continued climb despite almost first world economies grinding halt months paints dim view ability effectively combat climate change restraints behavior carbon taxes. Sequestration must path forward. sad. Look profile. Nothing hate resentment people know. Hope find healthy outlet anger. suck knowing one listens cares. euphemism, like proud boy sticking dildo ass livestream prove wasn‚Äôt homophobic? Well kind sucks, course, wearing mask keeps spreading sick/asymptomatic rather protecting (as much, realize still level protection). . nurse risk exposure wearing mask protect people around her, guess job security. sure think Evil Turtle allow vote Biden nomination

this dude waited year Scalia died, reason can't wait 4+ years RBG dies Perfect karma farming! need read nuthin! especially true since many people missed annual checkups. chronic health issues start need care. work, plus discovery green Toyota center crazycoughingspreaders.com reported coughing people's face poses additional risk catching COVID-19  mean like Stark great arc see evolution human being. really seen Elon. again, hard compare fact fiction. Glad hit nerve least you. far name calling lecture, start giving people unconditionally support. Ya, cause know Doctors dying every day performing surgeries breathing much CO2. /s Bro why‚Äôd reply twice thing? given quickly comments got downvoted, I‚Äôd wager downvoting Este Culero, Gov Abbott deplorable SOB.
Its reponsable outbreak covid hittin across Tx. I've also quarantining get frustrated go see people park road house. sports park even today, saw dozens people taking fucking kids youth sporting events. masks sight, social distancing, fucks given. past weekend, saw big group community pool. miracle covid devestated neighborhood.  talked friend lives Wuhan. Basically ensured enough/plenty basic supplies stay home, leads confidence people there. read people came together 1918 flu help other, staggering.  risked lives everything could mitigate illness ONE ANOTHER. Now, people like...it's rights project infect! Cool. even beat Sweden reckless country. win, pay lawyer. lose, pay hospital. Everyone else wins! also additional risk. neighbor died covid contracted hospital something unrelated. guess depends definition ‚Äúspike‚Äù, right? act like that‚Äôs empirical measurement it‚Äôs like ‚Äúmiddle class‚Äù - means different things different people. 3,016 individuals returned SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests, one positive test, positive individual part ""gym group"", visited gym positive test contact tracing found actually infected workplace.

So, effectively, sample size one. downvoting every comment? Lol setup temporary hospitals bring freaking navy medical ship.....

People beds lined hallways....

All elective stuff stopped early. long Texas Medical Houston reaches 100% capacity.....of total beds? Right? I‚Äôm NY I‚Äôm like y‚Äôall saw went decided say fuck masks, let‚Äôs mobile morgues! bash USA. citizen, lived 5 countries 4 continents, 75 countries gotta say, overall, love live here. isn‚Äôt perfect, don‚Äôt understand obsession people disparaging it. fantastic place live! much going it. weird half country blind frothing mouth patriotism, half seems obsessed saying worst country world. regular-ass country. reason seems odd aren‚Äôt number one road safety half keep telling best country world shocks find regular-ass country. regular-ass country love live in. favorite places haven‚Äôt best anything particular really, around cool spot be.

And many places lived far road deaths per capita, US still willing drive benefits getting around, like seeing people, going work, pleasure, people, willing restrict much even less significant threat? I'm sure well, mean...it spring break YELLING???? oughtta often. Compelling read &amp; right point. Maybe sub coronavirus majority people seem care coronavirus left leaning? Facebookers focused number deaths going down. seeing big picture - pretty. Hang tight! rest year going wild ride. Oh thats pretty cool! seems like model weighted heavily towards contact tracing. Illinois 3/4 categories green contact tracing orange state orange. Seems weird. Lol, see billionaires fucking cabinet Zillow, Washington Post, national association realtors, friends mine rental agents multi-state apartment conglomerates. articles everywhere discussing downturn markets saying market overall strong inventories low levels (high demand).

Some big cities seeing reduction demand - that's regional based people wanting leave cities. rental market that's overall, lower demand housing general areas. Protesting primary cause surge cases. people see another individual store wearing mask states masks mandated? tell put mask? talk employees managers? people's stances this? And, rub salt wound, look New York now. much contact. Like even suggesting people get outside minutes day met resistance. think point outside away people it‚Äôs safer better you. Haha agree part, stress terrible MS stress stress :) say sauna one best things happen mental physical health (subjectively partially supported bloodwork) long time imma stick now, re-evaluate get ‚Äòrona. 

What living? seem like good handle science/biology know aware. adding personal account post. woman work came today, said son dry cough fever. continually remind put mask face. finally left take son doctor, texts later let know ""just"" bronchitis. asked doctor told caused bronchitis. ""No, said they've seeing lot lately"". literally overheard allergist talking patient waiting room serious, wearing mask, facility REQUIRES everyone put one upon entry. I'm sick Southwest Missouri could puke. Abbott deserves stick wheels huge protests Houston even talking wish showed us making face coverings start needing surgical/n95/medical masks slow spread. Thought shipped 600 Russia last month? doesn‚Äôt want walk away though. long president protected. former president imagine hauled court quickly - civil, criminal, tax, family court once! think okay taking 1 year hiatus traditions. still next year. People think bigger picture.  used work ESJ--Alum Rock area, moved couple years ago.
But, right. cant imagine someone feelings would live SJ. must walk around pissed time. bet loves Super Taq, tho. Right? pic makes think he's trump relative, least trump voter. shifts eyed. Every place seems focused much cleaning everything seems covid spread isn‚Äôt surfaces. Keeping people apart much effective amount cleaning. Reclining Figure 4 Calf Stretch worked best me. probably full recovery.

The key every day, multiple times day. standing calf stretch cubicle beginning. pain manageable went longer daily walks.


I still stretches plus lot core strength ones. looking build muscle anything. definitely keeps back leg pain away.

Best luck. Sciatica pain fun experience. great, well March early June state opened quickly. Incubation average five days, problem top getting test results take amount time hospitalizations don‚Äôt occur onset infection. Here, safe.
Here, free. We‚Äôre living r/leopardsatemyface That's exactly it. There's else put money lose value. confidence market Fed created buying bonds ETFs helped too. Many companies around country, including hospitals, terminating employees run earn time refusing return work.  They'll also likely infect people die. Maybe blame people whole wearing masks. every right protest. like everyone right go grocery store. right go beach, go mall, go library, park. wearing mask problem. You‚Äôre pushing agenda right blaming actual problem. Nice. Yeah people hire people trying make ends meet, means pros. Hustlers hustle. maybe. Canadians stupid enough continue refuse wear masks? see lot posts commenting people wearing masks NC. Coopers order mandating masks gone effect yet, goes effect 5pm Friday. require employees customers wear face masks within 6ft may within 6ft another person, exception children younger 11yo, people health conditions, someone restaurant table eating. responsibility businesses, law enforcement, enforce mask rules, businesses penalized (though, course, actual enforcement likely vary). 


There's little course, that's gist. someone long hoped Tesla Space X would innovator modern age terribly excited go back space...

This like war Christmas, 1000x worse actual casualties. government picking malls citizens cowardly. Meaningless words. Get fucked, Duece. would mean infection fatality rate around 0.6% US. range seen countries wide antibody testing. We've known estimates least month now; new information really.

Sedentary lifestyle, like posting reddit day leads compromised health, well. Ayoo! Steelgang house No, analogy listen one point view you‚Äôre never going get truth. Trump constantly spouting bullshit journalists call it. Pretty bad considering Texas starting address today incubation long. Seems like even went full lockdown today still might hit it. Break up. country broken going fix itself. Partition go separate ways. reasonable choice point. Even though everyone best stay socially distant, Barbosa said likely enough suspects party may catalyst spread though there's way truly know. 

This guy smart careful. LOL  Rich folks stupid poor folks. Whodathunkit? I'm afraid unemployment ends lose even tax money. People spending much others said income/corporate tax. can't imagine state going broke cut bunch things never seen sounds like Florida headed way. anyone knows history idea example state past running money. federal government usually step in? I'd hold Fastpass though - waiting around 2-3 weeks sounds boring. room growth too, sadly.

Which still damage economy, something don‚Äôt seem every recognize No, governor. ignored experts political reasons, get ""pause"" now. late.

How time politics over. gambled people's lives lost.

Full lock down. Right now. Fauci WHO- need healthy people wear masks.

Old vulnerable people wearing masks, yes. mandating? Everyone. Oh no! Wearing cloth mask face 30 minutes shop inconvenience! whatever shall published data says things gonna become ""unsustainable"" 12 days nothing changes. that, everything else they've said vague platitudes. best hope virus burn stupid society. Better later. Maybe chance fix climate change make econimic system works everyone this. don‚Äôt know steps changing classes-the halls jam packed lunch well  theory makes way sense lol.  Thanks pointing out. That's insane. worked Canadian healthcare nurse 40 years Que Ont healthcare sytem good. perfect, nothing worry children lose inheritance due bad health. worked part-time 4 years figured way get good raise lie able repair small engines worked tool rental department ""fixing"" tools. outbreak Chinese capital stemming wholesale food market month resulted 256 known infections since June Beijing authorities say 2.3 million people tested instructed leaving city business reasons tests.

To identify 250-odd cases 2 weeks, China tested 2.3 million people Beijing! fact entitled attitude every douche thinking right served higher peoples right get sick fucking die. work health care know elective means. 

Hospitals generally something like emergent, urgent, elective team gets decide.

I never said elective means important. means deferred without expectation harm patient. hint: Yet don‚Äôt report lack social distancing n workplace health centers. needed someone else blame ; protesters. conveniently overlooked ""no reason alarm"" bit. One hospital one city 28% Covid occupancy.

Yes, posted corona virus subreddit people assuming 100% corona related. Yep. Nonsense. bit misleading. ICU's small often near capacity. area less 15 beds. small influx cause this. Tough use valid metric. worked Healthcare 12 years frequently they'd patients qued ICU beds. May direct attention numerous school shootings America killed many 65, actually 18, lack response that. Easier let easier? normal job, normal person, identifying potential problem saying sorry could get fired. Especially comes info could happen.

Of course would due loss money, lives, fuck cares, amirite? It‚Äôs physical beds.

ICUs special equipment (ventilators, monitors, etc) specially trained staff (intensivists, nurses, respiratory therapists) can‚Äôt rapidly make care patients additional beds. 

Moving ICU patients non-ICU environments means won‚Äôt getting best care.  happen. I'm exhausted. I'm non-emergency healthcare pediatric rehab. We're fucked. non-emergency health facilities shut we're worked death make lost income constantly worried exposure adjust manage constantly shifting policy fighting bosses take virus seriously overtime hazard pay. desperately want able keep working patients quality life without rehab, I'm overwhelmed. can't negotiate better bosses desperately looking ways force layoffs there's zero job security everyone mountain debt. Committee come together 30 days, 8 minutes zoom video call everyone dialup. What's funny took shit seriously promoted mask use, hand washing, social distancing, could 90% shit pre-pandemic. economy would rebounding rather circling drain we'd lot stability knowing need lock again. could cake eat instead false dichotomy careful functioning economy Wait Demoratic City Went heavy Floyd protesting issue? Color blind..... Yet everyone work saying testing Lockdowns stay home orders over. bans gatherings although ""gathering"" 4 people would never exceeded rules anyways. Quit pretending like people jobs lives supposed locking bunker. horse shit. 

If want Howard Hughes bunker come years, good man! care. quit acting like us children, jobs responsibilities idiots putting masks trying best safely. 

I tell children, one special needs already struggling plenty this, can't see grandparents next year. see important family members best safely (masks, outdoors, distancing). Btw talk children's pediatrician trust infinitely dude Reddit says none us ever leave homes again. Grow up.

Please means continue act like seeing grandparents across backyard masks thing indoor hugging party 25. amusingly obnoxious. Brazil hit look saying see experts don‚Äôt agree mask wearing, see countries done better US without them. might better wear not. Sound evidence hard come controlled experiments this. Every study confounding factors limited scope. choose wear one, don‚Äôt judge others don‚Äôt. Denmark slowed spread without half physical distancing guidelines higher deaths per capita Florid first couple months isn‚Äôt like wasn‚Äôt there. opened sooner US too. experts don‚Äôt agree, totally sure? Texas medical center, hospital consortium Houston. wrong, 70-80, misremembered. 

I think nuts 100% rising claim they're okay there's need worry. 

Graphics here, link specifically one referring to, right hand side.  6000 thousand Texas cases. Jesus christ unlikely someone infectious April still shedding virus. like one documented case someone shedding days there's still debate whether contagious asymptomatic point.

I would suggest hangout take place outdoors. wearing masks keep distance, fine. ugly Jigsaw writing. WA tomorrow masks mandatory, misdemeanor... plenty people wearing still, fines &amp; big ones. Stores giving free &amp; people still wont take them. Watch YouTube documentary ""Seattle Dying"" interested place falling apart, 4 years ago stopped even issuing misdemeanors. little late &amp; doubt see inforced much. barely house months see 40ish people today 2 masks. One person nearly got fight called using hand washing station, still didnt went business. hate 2020 bring aliens need direct anger purple mother fuckers. Let Covid alien virus unites us all! I‚Äôm Texan whose quarantine since March. I‚Äôm screwing around shit, yet fellow Texans appear dropped head children assume ‚Äúploy Dear Leader.‚Äù 

It‚Äôs fucking infuriating. explain anything. different New York, besides sick people sent back nursing homes? Bunch profit seeking corporate cuntbags.  worked gas station 22 - 23 (in state, attendants required pump gas people, ""create jobs""). 

I got flu once, hit Friday night right weekend off... monday, still 102F fever still felt like shit, called in, took NyQuil passed out.

8 hours later, woke 13 voicemails manager escalating saying ""part job"" find someone cover shift, come would fired, ultimately, fired.

The next day, got call place applied hail mary (majorly underqualified, thought chance getting job), interview, next week, starting work almost 5x pay shitty gas station job. So, guess worked out. daily comments approximate us deaths? Maybe try less covid-19 testing. lose? /s Deaths still way down, that‚Äôs good. Follow suggestions. Try research would take guys unionize TMC ICUs 72% filled non COVID patients said take patients. making lost money. Guess we'll wait see.  Wow. Yea I‚Äôve ‚Äúbulged‚Äù disc. dad spinal stenosis hoping doesn‚Äôt end there. don‚Äôt feel bad, pills nothing. Honestly, copious amounts marijuana helped sleep hunched ottoman alcohol better pain pills. Physical therapy helping. Strength up, numbness slightly down, hurts bad stand/walk. Progress! Hope you‚Äôre better. managed reduce peak considerably less notice. Many states even hit peak yet. Come back 3 months see well NY comparison then. hospital. it? bad dream... moved back barcelona nightly walk arrival... took sun came up... people started popping streets.. sun suddenly high cooking.. realized went far away apartment would take bus/metro.... went panic woke up.... could city, dreamed barcelona love it...

The point sudden dread crowded places..

I cant imagine stockholm brasil, usa etc... :(

Hold everyone! ""But economy? open up!""

[economy burns *because* opening instead] Oh absolutely promise won't. graph I've seen better illustrates implicates reopening outbreak [the hospitalizations Santa shame Newsom least mask requirement counties wanted reopen. Seems like common sense point. 

Hang there! sudden big push mandating masks?

do need help understanding basic concepts? I‚Äôm hoping TX plans convert arena or
conference center overflow ward. it
In somewhat rapidly. Could save bunch lives... someone tell Hitler f#r l#ft so#ial#st, eyes rolled head
*screw auto-mod, ridiculous 817 people per day *with* preventive measures put place. hell people seem grasp cause effect? Crazy northeast country hit HARD early learned adapt wearing masks, caused spread drop heavily, rest country whole extra month plus take precautionary measures decided nothing King serves Dollar, leader. unsustainable business model. Strict lockdown would ideal, current system people needing work food rent make difficult. govt wasn‚Äôt worthless could cancel housing costs provide food everyone, maybe could work. Trump fans: still hoax propagated muh Dems?  Let free. Cruel fur industry public corrupt politicians may willing pretend exist doctors health care workers learning virus treat they're getting better every day. Thankfully fatality rate much lower 3 months ago. said, we're still talking tens thousands people going avoidably die over. Frankie Donkeybrains! Starbucks exact thing too. People like think Starbucks ethical brand dust corporate bullshit find #evil corporation Ft. Former employee It‚Äôs unreasonable 120 Tylenol? Bro listen claimed lol Trump definitely hates NFL never letting buy team though Best 3 5? See gets 100k per day first? Absolutely. countdown begun. Paywall Pulled head sand fraction fraction inch, he? Except reality exists, seem hard time with. knew antibody tests date show 1% 2% IFR I'm aware of. ~1.1 - 1.3% IFR estimated 5% population (about 2.3m people) 28k dead (well, around 26-27k time study done). 

NY state likewise around 1.2-1.4% mark IFR
NY study  
case/fatality info  models wrong. useful. that‚Äôs exactly private health insurance anyway. also pay company profit too. many laid furloughed? Death disease thing taking nurses away patients.

The majority COVID related deaths country direct result administrative greed. Maybe I'll put cat head. pool beach gatherings seem cause spike significant indoor quality them. Poll parties homes, bars restaurants beach. Many states haven‚Äôt hit peak reduced earlier NY. First peak bad metric That's part get.

""I want pay someone else!""

But dude... pay you.... people follow social distancing rules get flattening curve. hilarious. FED keeps printing money Robinhooders keep buying stocks 20% Az libs. China, resumption work requires government approval, consulted respected public health experts, impossible business owners attempt resume work without approval.

Ultimately, responsibility falls government rather business owners people.

At least now, I'm glad system way is. 2/3 Washington state. still cant admit related constant protests screaming others faces. need secede State Pennsylvania form state Delaware, Montgomery Bucks County, stop giving money control city control Delaware Valley bumpkins coal bin country. Pennsylvania red neck Alabama. hate Philadelphia Pittsburgh, even though economic engines state. let‚Äôs take money, purchasing power, universities, hospital systems, port airport, yes status Sanctuary city, let bumpkins keep coal gas fracking.  I‚Äôll even give Shoefly pie them. went through. 1977 41 deaths. Schrodinger's hair one said able feed family. one said anything you. said disabled people struggling even usual (which lot. try living less $700/month). Seriously competition there's enough go around. food, shelter, water billions people. bottle neck resources let certain people struggle die. one said able feed family. said disabled people able live Let eat cake.

Or Covid-19 equivalent. spread propaganda mexicans flying canada sneak US illegally trump build Thanks info! seen data pneumonia deaths dude, like said that‚Äôs UN kicks they‚Äôve done extraordinarily well keeping peace order places in. know U.S., evidence increase cases protests. 


No, currently jump cases 1-2 weeks protests, impossible know protests lockdown restrictions lifted. line everybody parroting based nothing participants wearing masks though.

Not city saw news minority portion participants anywhere else. dishonest U.S. numbers

Much dishonest, never know actual impact event had.  Bail businesses CEO‚Äôs pocket money instead giving American‚Äôs money. Yes may save even stores aren‚Äôt opened they‚Äôll online shopping curbside pickup. economists numbers say savings 33% believe people aren‚Äôt spending money, well idiots aren‚Äôt taking consideration people probably using cash pay rent utility bills. Texas I'm covid IMU nurse. still can't get dad cancel 4th July party sure attending. really true. difficult, anesthesia machines kinda function like ventilators. info interested. biggest thing operating rooms turned self-contained negative pressure rooms, means use safely perform aresol-generating procedures intubation infected patients. harder monitor patient glass doors. don‚Äôt see acceptable path forward. 

Back envelope calculation based numbers taking values confirmed cases deaths Johns Hopkins dashboard get. 

Hopkins: 2.45M cases | 125.7K dead

Assume 10x positive/exposed +10% undetected deaths: 24.5M infected | ‚âà137K dead

That gives mortality rate ‚âà0.56%

The heard immunity threshold (HIT) (per Wikipedia) COVID-19 29-74%. 

Let‚Äôs say HIT 50%. 

US population 331M. get 50% exposure, need ‚âà145M exposed. mortality rate correct, means ‚âà~~970K~~797K Americans die. 

üò¨

EDIT: Fixed error multiplying 2.45M 10. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è PA requiring masks...I would say 90% folks cautious, wearing masks....the 10% belong ReOpen PAFacebook total douchebags. loud rude pissed told need mask enter business....Seriously, window truly nasty loud weirdo shit, look join ReOpen PA...it‚Äôs batshit crazy many people believe ‚Äúrights‚Äù trampled wearing mask...please join...Imlike drop scientific quotes every often lose minds. Google ""chances dying car crash.""

NY times says 1 wanna shut entire economy corona (chances dying roughly 1 160)?? Yeah, recently passed Puerto Rico. Going outside almost impossible 3 days.  Drinking??? Hey guys, flu! /s


Can't believe I'm still hearing people say this. think around 80%. Places supposed use lockdown period increase capacity. whole ""flatten curve"" came ""raise bar"". one day twenty years ago awake hour. still remember terror thinking suffocating.

Edit: recovery one day took forever, pain horrendous didn‚Äôt go back work month part time weeks that. might part I‚Äôm terrified shit make sense. employees get paid salary. investor, founder takes risk. employee thinks labor worth contributed great deal success company ask raise. I'm going pay janitor $100K year labour worth $15 hour billionaire. Thank you! also risk contracting virus. 28% likely going up. alarming. Title read ""ICU reached capacity. 25% covid patients."" article even says normally run 80-90% capacity... Oh shit forgot 4th July coming up.

Lord fucked. Cases deaths Mexico could doubled number cases country rise 300,000 mid-July. Fix quit. Otherwise, part problem.  sorcery? HD widescreen video??? no? replace fattest big boned biggest boned? Cause fat.  dunno dudes suits ties probably. Wow that's awful. I'm sorry.   already drinking Trump's. Kinda makes ya wonder runny noses allergies. headline says. Inside activity vs. Outside activity. Yes, new York fucked bad. continue fucking different beast. one thing say ""there's virus another country, need taken seriously"". That's fucking level completely different ""there million cases country, need taken seriously"".  sub left leaning trash Wow. Shocking. could predicted surprising turn events???  I‚Äôm saying # cases specific day correlate deaths particular day. understand deaths lag. 3 weeks April 6, Ontario 309 cases. 57 deaths, linked tested positive 3 weeks prior. 

June 5 (three weeks ago), Florida 1,305 cases. Today 44 deaths. 

Just observation. I‚Äôm seeing disconnect number cases united states deaths. (accounting lag) Seems lower be, compare countries data. Nah, I'll stop looking mirror. definitely make problem disappear. happens? means vaccine. never interact people again?  that‚Äôs flagpole sitting popular 20s. Yeah. It‚Äôs surprising. That‚Äôs literally everyone arguing you. 

Also people probably don‚Äôt know Rand Ron Paul top heads like Nancy Pelosi Andrew Cuomo right now. haven‚Äôt seen much anyone news, compared two Texas rep eye patch recently. understanding particular family viruses (coronaviruses) typically long-lasting immunity certain colds see reinfection coronavirus year year.

Again, laymen understanding based coronaviruses (that novel) behaved. many people graduation birthday parties. wrong people? hosts guests! friend party daughter weekend invited everyone office. 

Wtf! would like another lockdown thanks!! That‚Äôs good news, I‚Äôm Texas well. know, isolate. 100% related coronavirus, Chile: Data homicide rate (without exaggeration) currently 4 times (Lockdown Economic reasons lack policing). Wonder would even aftermath. believe (actual) prison time homicide around 5 years? ever sold ""Chile developing country, safe, unlike South American country"" bear mind utter lie known becoming like South American shithole, virus drug trafficking growing exponentially, too. actually look safe country latin america better look Costa Rica, Cuba, Uruguay. governments mismanage country badly üòÇ trying understand basis premise able feed family disabled people struggling. Warmongering, anti refugee, anti environment, anti worker protection, on, Walmarts Applebee's could ever hope for. regular patients shuffled, COVID patients. would everything, covid related emergencies. That's ebb flow nature man! Many environmental chance factors lead decreasing. could hypothetically difference 1 person going whatever reason. Small changes lead massive effects.

But point, highly infective disease like covid likely spread rapidly causing surge reach threshold ability spread mitigated extent already has. Herd immunity essentially extreme outcome function.

Look plague. shit killed 2/3 Europe pretty much died out. handful breaks continued next 600 years that's life. measures taken mitigate people literally concept disease even was. Nature way balancing out.

Look influenza. shit everywhere. pandemic. domt react way flu familiar it. Novelty almost certainly part reason crazy reaction covid.

There flu outbreak 1890 thought h2n3 (dont quote that) killed 1 million people. 1890. Proportionate today's population would 500 million DEATHS even cases.

Everything perspective. imperative neglect biases patterns nature making decisions huge implications

And thank reasonable critical response!! know comorbities are? Good luck ‚Äúlubing‚Äù diabetic Covid patient. Poor Buddhist community Russia got declining.  US: pretending we've political rallies final offer. outside. opinion opening beaches parks changed. Transmission rare outside whole heat thing actually applies...when outside. nothing political it. Qzark Memorial things cause many cases either. masks sharing food drinks wonder viral load higher long flight. example sit next someone positive talk entire flight. Racing herd immunity without healthcare system manage hospitalizations (as Sweden has) would catastrophic. would looking tens millions dead Americans, COVID alone, plus lives lost lack healthcare access, lives lost due general societal dilapidation. 

And see Texas now, people self-isolate soon hospitals overcrowded, tanking economic activity extending time takes herd immunity reached. Deaths trailing indicator. absolutely nothing number people testing positive Arizona Texas today; they‚Äôre already dead. see virus time realize bad go lockdown, it‚Äôs already late ‚Äî many people already infected, hospitals wait swarms patients disease runs course.

Those apocalyptic scenes NYC? They‚Äôre coming Houston Phoenix matter authorities now, couple weeks future. One difference there‚Äôs still sign new hotspot states shut back down. could get even worse. Surprise, surprise!   8 deaths per 100k texas due coronavirus #43 50 states. New York 161 per 100k ranking #1 8 times death New York Texas. Cuomo fraud. speak it. followers eat every word mouth. drinking bleach Christ sake!!! came tomorrow said ""You know guys, really something whole mask wearing thing. start starting today."", Every one followers would putting masks neighbors, even dogs said to. needs send right message.  sound like may tired winning much. I'm sure protests effect, mainly reopening says 40% people COVID-19 GOOD THING FUCKING POLICE VIOLENCE GOING ACROSS COUNTRY RIGHT TOO, HUH?!

God, wanna fucking SCREAM right now... 

Just... Fucking everything. Fuck everything, right now. Fuck all. Fuck cops, fuck Trump, fuck Barr, fuck goddamn virus... can't anymore. energy continue charade ""everything's gonna okay,"" really feel like going okay. 

It's coming head soon, I'm afraid outcome be... already ""law enforcement"" officers fucking beating, arresting torturing people repercussions, even *before* shit happened! look now! Hundreds thousands (at least, well more) videos pictures posted online *daily* thing happening punish fucking racist assholes actions. fact feels like methodically laid out, playing exactly supposed to. Idk, maybe I'm paranoid. 

I wish... Idk even wish for. end? disappear exist reality anymore? energy continue pretending.

Edit: I'm sorry really ranty, needed vent bit... Honestly see Spain, Italy, UK totally botched initial flattening well. blame Trump anymore. He's done everything power show people incompetent, inadequate, selfish, corrupt is. GOP elected, covered for, support maniacal baby. evil, criminal organization. break laws need order stay power. let us die accepting responsibility COVID anything else. dau article like 97%. say City Council meeting Wednesday morning, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said 97 percent city's ICU beds filled. report Texas Medical Center (TMC) said 27 percent beds occupied COVID-19 TMC's latest report incorporated ICU admission numbers seven affiliate hospitals Houston area: CHI St. Luke's Health, Harris Health System, Houston Methodist, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Memorial Hermann, Texas Children's Hospital University Texas Medical Branch. hospitals collectively admit 1,330 ICU patients regular capacity, 70 80 percent total beds typically occupied, according TMC.

So, quick math, 1330 ICU patient capacity 27% capacity taken covid patients, 325 patients covid TMC's Monday report noted additional 373 beds could become available ""sustainable surge"" plan, procedure would indefinitely increase ICU capacities needed pandemic. Another 504 beds could added Houston ICUs emergency ""unsustainable surge"" plan, TMC would implement address ""significant, temporary"" influx patients, according report.

So, sustainable plan, could double number available icu beds covid, unsustainable plan could nearly double again.

Some people replied posted last time context. link post want see  Ohio spiking clearly seen graphs infection tracker websites. last big store local mall JC Penny's reopened close down. way mall survive another year biggest player Books-A-Million MCL. exception. lots people shoes. Maybe extreme muscular people always going higher levels BMI. Bill Gates pointed several months ago even government ordered everything open, restaurant customers would reluctant step pile bodies sit bite eat.

Fear restrict economy drastically reduced levels. fix economy fear needs go away. get rid fear risk virus needs removed.

With vaccine highly effective treatment, risk gets removed physical distancing, mask usage, testing, contact tracing. That's successful countries doing. allows get economies restarting. notion everyone wearing mask protests lie. 

I live DC, epicenter protest world right now. Yes lots masks worn, also tons people wearing well getting worse weather gets hotter here.

I go protests girlfriend going city get takeout food weekends hundreds thousands people wearing masks wearing around chin.

There block party last night Juneteenth hundreds people packed together essentially concert, saw ton videos friends Instagram least half wearing masks.

I keep seeing everyone saying protestors wearing masks true, seeing every weekend. I'm Ontario we're pretty well. Government saying wear masks can't physical distance.

Evidence spread outdoors minimal. always wear mask I'm inside. 90% everyone else see. Remind 2 months Ohio 3 times population Kentucky cities? explain Indiana though need use case numbers contexts. right less reliable own. paired testing numbers, % positive, median age cases pretty well estimate hospitalization deaths weeks earlier.

But since first, case numbers useful used correctly. get rising hospitalizations, may late mobilize response. Trouble is, many us die it. [The azdhs website infographics u.  really sound like victim. feel like victim? point repeating Reddit constantly? think people read it? wearing one going unless forced to. first shutdown *completely* wasted, ICUs get overwhelmed kind defeat one primary purposes shutdown. This.

The system working intended, anyone shred empathy intended.

You prioritize providing healthcare, prioritize profits. cannot both. Anyone saying prioritizing profits, want admit it. Except know Spanish Flu harsher lockdown leads better recovery. see beyond quarters crashes course. Oh shit, forreal? Somewhere thread, posted link article Marie Claire explains side, choose believe. Right. It‚Äôs filling 30% ICU. lot. call pretty big market share. Think like this, maybe you‚Äôll understand. Let‚Äôs pretend ICU normally 70% full. it‚Äôs mixture kinds people. Motorcycle accidents, flu patients, people recovering heart attacks.
But 30% beds filled. Covid, Covid alone, sucks 30% beds. infinite amount health problems take 70%.
Do understand intensive care filled 30% Covid victims problem?
I know I‚Äôm going get crickets. I‚Äôd love hear hot take. saying happened. saw happened tv. sporadic mask wearing distancing. We're weeks since protests got time high confirmed cases day. absolutely spread protests. outdoor conditions help, yes. spread. Every day go walking neighborhood get see stupid things people doing.

I guess social distancing means family get-togethers, parties, barbecues. look case graph death graph see disconnect months. number deaths per case continues decline USA. believe summer cases less deadly Winter cases lesser viral load. Downvote reason like. based published studies, tying together. lot people ""aren't living this"" anymore alive. Negligent assholes.Vote out!  Nice. Still voting Trump. see lot noses, too. Whyyyy? Put mask face, cover nose mouth, touch it! hard. problem NYC terrible, run down, government run hospitals. really shocking failed pandemic 30% deaths despite 5% population. It‚Äôs people ran first time cause didn‚Äôt saying, ‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt going again!‚Äù Lol yeah sell Chinese giant increase cancer patients compared normal/planned, yes, could overrun cancer patients. 

I'm sure stubborn this. political angle something? coarse, rough, irritating, gets everywhere agree statement, far many people comments aren‚Äôt seeing side coin: applies *everyone*, political party. good Newsom caved opening early. husband ordered air conditioner couple months ago never came. Getting customer service line next impossible. one point husband hold 40 minutes finally hung called back. end never charged air conditioner since never showed up, yet (to make long story short) told customer service expect credit checking account ~$450 (the cost air conditioner.)

I thinking giving money back seems dishonest keep (and also there‚Äôs certainly chance they‚Äôll realize mistake take back bill us something.) 

My husband also talked possibility hanging onto bit HD doesn‚Äôt take back, using money good (helping someone out, donating, etc) since we‚Äôve living whole time like didn‚Äôt money, wouldn‚Äôt skin back continue living such.

Having read things HD, absolutely consider latter: hanging onto ‚Äúfree‚Äù $450 know sure aren‚Äôt going take back, probably using help someone somehow. Maybe help HD employee bills. (I say tongue cheek. came absolutely would.) Trump rallys. way. Like ‚Äúhow much change votes voting machine?‚Äù work ER Ben Taub TMC. starting get pretty bad already. ER already starting hold ICU pts days beds available. one pt refused transfer 20+ hospitals full. yeah, ER already turning another ICU. looking good. homosexuality...... ya know... nothing see here. It‚Äôs flu. Don‚Äôt bother wearing mask. We‚Äôve seen happen country.  enough ‚Äúweve done great great job‚Äùs website currently showing ICU capacity moving overflow.  Housing starters! property taxes $600/mo mid range home area! used able pay home pretty easily. even build small homes town can't collect enough $$ grant building permit.

I agree you. hard really work single parents, would leave families vulnerable job loss. example husband good jobs lucky made enough could live one income. lost job due Covid-19. single earner workforce primary earner became disabled... brother single earner family three kids, buy insane amounts disability insurance life insurance since he's one making money busy 3 kids.

There would large safety net like UBI permanently large enough unemployment (like right crisis.) imagine. I've merely *paying attention* since January, failings everyone react to, expect, predictable outcomes depresses me. And, I'm Chef Rust Belt, studied science career, I'd probably 24/7 raging. Ok potential vaccines positive results moving phases? Uhhh TMC dozens hospitals. Literally dozens. TMC larger many major American city central business districts square ft basis. wrong, read article, 4 hospitals systems specifically mentioned. 

Source: live Houston 4 different hospitals, will, Texas Medical Center. remember correctly, operated different hospital systems. don‚Äôt work serve purpose. Herd Immunity better strategy Sweden undoubtedly proving. Yes exception rule BMI designed regular exception. Yes, prioritize profits lives. Well put. Yeah, I've got bunch musician buddies (just local gigging guys) taken HUGE hits. trying double zoom music lessons kids float them. 

I hope things turn corner you. Living DFW area reading this, totally believe number congregate year. Texas schools, specifically science education, failed us. country joke  Yes, people staying home avoid Covid, visiting people hospital, elective procedures.

Put thinking cap on. smarter this.

Or think saw Italy Spain made up? think moon landing real? there's anything bring US knees, it. We've endured wars, recessions, depression pandemics. Covid-19? like nothing we've endure before.

I guarantee initial proper response stuck pandemic behavior we'd fine. POTUS started fucking dog minute walked room given chance get drink since. Yeah NYC area fine. came great cost essentially done this. NYC could probably totally open see almost zero issues.  You‚Äôre idiot agree.

I know friend friend PT fiance anesthesiologist, wearing masks delaying upcoming wedding plans.

I know others medical field care masks.

Knew someone thought overblown, dad got COVID-19 worried day 2. soon realized he'll fine, whole family went Florida vacation (900 miles us) stating ""we'll social distancing beach.""

If people medical field US cannot care rest??

I caved house since March 14th. Football nonessential outside pandemics That's true. accomplished accelerating infection least. RemindMe! EOY Party Dudes struggle think something less essential sports. Thanks. COVID knows borders! know person infected barely symptoms. 2 months later, still regained full taste smell. [out county even believe conversation. read actual CDC report it, ""greater risks"" questionable. Pregnant women fewer COVID symptoms died rate non-pregnant women. There's small increase hospitalizations (but say hospitalizations for, say, delivery) ventilation, deaths, suggests excess caution around pregnant women rather actual increased risk. Thank god ppl like reasonable think positive flu tests flu season over? Oh way! one could forseen this! I‚Äôm one wearing mask picking dinner... Arizona. Literally one person, currently, mask on.  remember are. memory go much 2017. gets scary choose lives dies.

Yeah, give week less...tops. Vietnam isn't. shit. wanna fit everyone else.

Ahh yess trustworthy board liars shills. Positive test rate Arizona, comparison. Oh Larry, fuck you. get allowing economic adviser decide health policy. dying starts. 

You supposed avoid going full-Italy full-Spain.

Ah well, America's peak past. close #1 since about... 2016? agree perfect, thought serology tests numbers built variance prediction. agree 20% seems high though, believe Spain's test showed 5% total (although 10-14% Madrid, maybe high density areas get bad). Either way, good thing NY governor go locked down. I'm convinced Democratic leadership actually wanted remove him. Either horrible strategists. üé∂ Take bite heart tonight üé∂  Na, states actually full stay home order seeing spikes. I'm trouble understanding point trying make outside care shamed wearing mask.

you even need n95 mask even need tight fitting mask need something front holes keeps droplets spraying place. keep beard. listen people trying tell shave it. Unless working hospital need seal. Every Australian state imposed heavy restrictions, stay home mandatory unless travel required limited criteria, schools universities closed, home visits allowed medical compassionate reasons delivery essential supplies, pubs, cafes, gyms, cinemas restaurants closed Australia wide, people allowed congregate groups larger two outdoors events attracting crowds banned.
NZ admittedly took even stringent approach, let's suggest Australia instituted ""soft"" lockdown Sweden vein.  Sars night big bright..... live with, like die  Well fair last ones touch Black.

Shamed compliance? basic human decency? Even though total stranger, care enough I'm willing follow guidelines avoid infecting unknowingly. me? I'm sure bad person understand probably difficult year many us are. Wearing mask something care Americans human beings, it, everything's going keep getting worse. everyone perfectly cool restarting outdoor events? Concerts, sports events, food festivals, parades . long similar density mask usage completely good go, right? What's that, aren't? apparently reason Dave Matthews start outdoor concert tour. funny go story Disneyland every comment says Disneyworld shut too. Mask usage mandatory Disney sporadic protests. neither state federal government thing properly honor send relief. keep saying this, right eventually. many needlessly suffer die then? one could afford anyways way healthcare system is. Dude, already reacted this. told people slow testing cause it‚Äôs making look bad.


That‚Äôs response situation top elected public servant. Welcome WAVE 2! SURFS UP! Even worse, may go straight vulnerable family members return AZ help paint boat. -_- Washington State resident here, beg differ. Governor Jay Inslee shown lot leadership thing shows flattened curve. maddening thing eastern half state, people blaming overreacting decisive early actions helped make big problem here.

People stupid. Average cases reported last 10 days 643. That‚Äôs 10-day average 565 month ago.

Not huge spike. 60% cases people aged 20-49. Thats I'm hoping for. least end state close bridges Unfortunately, we'll find first college/pro athletes infected. Yes. talking couple people Texas, choice. Individual freedom. Texas stuff. possibility unemployment bonus extended senate next month. I‚Äôm pretty certain will. Whether it‚Äôs $600 week, wait see. Speculation says $250-$400 week January 2021. massive wave incoming? Got it. Nope, everyone going fine except unproductive sacrifices nursing homes economy going booming. governor would stand shining example leadership courage grit virus went away like magic, he‚Äôd proudly stand podium Donnie governors FL GA declare victory COVID war biggest unmasked rally crowd world ever seen. stuff would happened two weeks earlier would totally screwed insurance.

Yeah, could buy COBRA within 3 months losing coverage. 4th month really risky (it may worth buy catastrofic insurance market time). see respond post 120 dollar tylenol?  unions good, police unions? I've screwed one Union prefer bargaining own. really worst way less people dying two months ago? bold quick requiring mask, respsect Wow almost healthcare profit driven bad idea health. bad alternatives. He's gotten much shit people, nauseating. Otherwise intelligent people fathom really happening can't help blame cautious approach. I'm glad we're well overall I'm honestly little surprised. everyone know, maybe 2/3 taking seriously third think get virus done it. Wonder it‚Äôs massive protests Houston had? they‚Äôll blame trump thats cant grasp! Summer started last Saturday.....lol US great infrastructure....
Just fucked people.... fucked
Ego said, absolutely something taken seriously. exaggerating bad bad exaggerating problem. provide ammunition people saying overblown. bit ridiculous ever person 20s 30s making like death sentence, scared go back work, etc. point heart disease still killing twice many people day, many see people looking cheeseburgers like they're Grim Reaper. 50% population brainwashed. China entire world whoop It‚Äôs ass.... i

It's cute believe Well great sleep paralysis/hypnopompic hallucination night. calling dog boyfriend (literally order lol) dreaming murderer walking bedroom couldn‚Äôt move. boyfriend said heard nnnngggghhhhh, nnnnggghhhhh! Anyway worst. Hadn‚Äôt one long time, I‚Äôm worried covid Australia, buy 100 paracetamol tablets $2.50 Can‚Äôt wait live America without NFL! US ""health care"": burn million people, good go! Redfield CDC guessing anything? unfamiliar scientific sampling extrapolation? want know many people already virus need administer antibody test 1,000 random people apply results population. no. prefer get national state say maybe maybe that. Guess never know,

Just reminder, Redfield guy co-wrote book claiming HIV God's punishment LGBT sins anything prevent it. claimed discovered vaccine HIV. work later discredited. appointed Trump 2018 drum support anti-science, anti-lgbt evangelicals. last person universe looking sound advice.

Also, every day wake find horribly bad news come /r/coronavirus find everyone braying great news now. it‚Äôs worth, I‚Äôm pretty sure Northeast hit hard beginning big reason they‚Äôre taking seriously. Absolutely sucks southern states apparently learn themselves, stay safe time being. Hopefully c0vidiots learn lesson ignoring find thing control near future well I'm union Australia, actually rather strong one. 

There definitely people coast, knowing they'll fine call union get bitched at. 
I actually really trust union, seem help look good much members. 

I'd still rather alternative, though. something goes want support. Serious question: virus seasonal? told would come back October, looks like it‚Äôs thriving even hottest states country.

If it‚Äôs seasonal, can‚Äôt live fear keeping economy closed until/if there‚Äôs vaccine Deaths lag confirmed cases. We‚Äôll see progresses next weeks. promote truth PRIMARY benefit people. goal protect yourself, people claim they're afraid virus, wear masks. depoliticize mask wearing treat issue common courtesy - wear care OTHERS. That's reason mentioned it. Jesus people, stay home sick. Even test negative showing symptoms. stay home! Sick sick! Prevent isn‚Äôt right word know mean spot on.  tried turning coworker back again? Sounds like MoBo might FUBAR states hit hard opening already protests happened. reopening CDC medical professional advice.  Garcetti fucked everyone Singapore also got quite lucky 

More accurately, government really good job controlling foreign local transmission, managed contain mass recall overseas student really well, fucked telling foreign workers pound sand dorms. healthcare system volunteer groups already foreseen problem way beforehand government failed act it. 

Rather think lucky foreign worker dorms mostly isolated rest society, think accurate think failure identify huge risk early allowed virus spread like wildfire dorms. frankly 100% icu capacity one canaries coal mine. 

There warnings along way, TL;DR Houston problem. Totally agree...I think pandemic really exposed selfishness arrogance Americans :( charge things well. It‚Äôs like going room house buy 120 dollar Tylenol. It‚Äôs addition charges stuff happening? shutting shit NOW????? Ooh truth painful. I‚Äôve fears loses, Wall Street could revolt. Basically mass exodus millionaires billionaires leaving country, taking companies them. Mass layoffs across every industry. would messy sure. Like not, way life completely dependent them. gonna see 4k deaths soon.  It‚Äôs frustrating. We‚Äôve quarantined like you, many people know going normal summer like nothing‚Äôs happening. Seems like we‚Äôve wasted quarantining we‚Äôve done far. por que los dos upvote heathen describes level anger pretty well. I‚Äôm fuckin dumbfounded point. Shit made sense way, way long now. can‚Äôt wrap head around even got point. I, pessimistic asshole, didn‚Äôt even think would bad fast. god damn. both. think Russians aren‚Äôt actively engaging online disinformation campaigns US election year Trump made abundantly clear intends take 0 preventative measures you‚Äôre naive. goal chaos division, they‚Äôre probably also working spreading outrage lockdown protests.

American industrial interests probably using similar tactics, probably aren‚Äôt many capable engaging effective, coordinated nationwide campaigns. us, them. fucked us. 2.45M x 10 = 24.5M, 20.45M. IFR = 0.55. Scott Gottlieb:

It worth noting Texas chose suspend elective medical procedures took additional strong mitigation actions, like temporarily closing congregate activities bars venue identified source spread. numbers pretty choppy. longterm trends there, GA SC look brink runaway growth.  intentional misdirect increased amount people commented thereby increasing chance people seeing this. right I‚Äôm wrong. 

10 upvotes I‚Äôll post onlyfans Unfortunately virus lethal elderly douchey spreader probably around spread seed, thus robbing Darwin true reward. ‚ÄúWe need change mindset focus exclusively number cases, severity illness. shouldn‚Äôt counting diagnosed infection,‚Äù Yealy said. ‚ÄúFor vast majority people testing positive, illness mild, don‚Äôt even know symptoms COVID-19 infection.‚Äù

Dr. Yealy UPMC That‚Äôs works Florida. example chain hospitals little competition. We‚Äôve people last minute leave us pandemic rates NY, weren‚Äôt welcome back. short staffed us middle pandemic. Sadly weren‚Äôt many options choose area.
Like ‚ÄúFlorida hospitals‚Äù like 10 General area. There‚Äôs like one 2 competitors floor nurses PACU nurses laid droves (no elective surgeries). It‚Äôs good time. Healthcare worker here. work long term acute care hospital, we‚Äôve fortunate enough zero patients test positive Covid. hospital administration took proactive approach early pandemic: temp checks every morning upon arrival staff, mandatory masks, social distancing, visitors (even enacted FL). Also, accept patient tested positive, even since tested negative. isn‚Äôt enough known virus still, since 70% patients vents, couldn‚Äôt take chances. 

No patient discharged us past 4 months tested positive either. 

Now, imagine leaders taken approach let greed guide decisions re-open everything again. We‚Äôre second wave this, get tsunami. wife's name Karen, live Texas. I'm screwed. exactly. American Hospitals losing boat loads money covid patients. mention damage Microsoft Africa. Hunger Games? think mask plus social distancing required. beach goers, protestors, restaurant grocery store visitors contributors problem Jesus! personally blame people /r/ABoringDystopia willing lively dystopia us.

Plenty smaller, rural communities don‚Äôt hospital, Houston *massive* sprawl metropolitan area, people far 60-70 miles around might TMC.

For smaller comparison fewer moving parts, Waco bunch hospitals kind healthcare center central Texas. Everyone 40 miles south Dallas 30 miles north Austin (except military folks Fort Hood) goes Waco area hospitalization. Watch find 10-15 years CoVID causes highly increased risk lung cancer shit.

We already seen lead longer-term health effects...inflammation, kidney failure, fatigue, anxiety, etc. flooding Houston today. messaging ‚Äúturn around, don‚Äôt drown...seriously turn around there‚Äôs hospital bed drive river‚Äù family members already exposed sick. going one worst blooms history pandemics. maybe total cost human lives (still bad), terms economic societal destruction. coming together worst way possible. people work there, M-F haha (speaking someone works dt) First Covid came China. nothing Chinese.

Then came Iran, nothing Persian.

Then came Italy...

New York...

And... I'm still gonna shit cause see neighborhood. ... and? Let us worry cancer becomes contagious. Houston ICU bed count used covid doubling week. Exponential growth bites hard, need prevent looks serious. late avoid worst. :/ forget NC, Alabama, Mississippi NYC shelter place March 20th, entire state saw daily caseload 2831/day 22 deaths/day. peaked around 10,000 cases/day 900 deaths/day. Yikes! 30k? sounds optimistic. plethora illnesses require ICU care simply there. even peak Flu season yet. Come Autumn predicting things get much worse. far end this. can't take comment seriously. implied /s here? Please say so. Georgia anyone good link projections/updated models? really curious see showing now. shit show. 


This country fucking *broken.* Houston even top 25.  headline misleading- actually thought positive test count true number cases? It‚Äôs sad something unbelievably simple stated people here. Arizona went 15K cases 63K cases one month. Well yeah...they got cases zero. possible new cases would come overseas, right? *supposed to

The two party system joke Well know who's willing give lives company Holy shit. :'( There's nothing one virus protects another, yeah certainly possible. Exactly. I'm saying hierarchy; higher positions always demand responsibility (nepotism aside). we've gotten point wage gap top &amp; bottom become extreme. leads wealth inequality, top 1% US households bottom 40%, whatever number now.

Does c-level necessarily work harder assembly line worker? labor measured? receives surplus value? 1% raise per year mean anything top gets exponentially bonuses benefits? execs get golden parachutes failed business bailout?  

What I'm saying billionaire earned much themselves. Exploitation inevitable rich. necessarily disagree know quite people made get tested work. 

Especially anyone turns positive, even really big company. friend posted yesterday Facebook husband made take test another employee turned positive husband turned positive too. said mild allergy symptoms 8 days thought nothing pollen awful right now. Gross. Wrong. Gross. We‚Äôre probably identifying higher percentage cases then. Many people may asymptomatic mild symptoms. good thing we‚Äôre identifying though we‚Äôre identifying people, likely spread disease unknowingly. Unfortunately that‚Äôs reason though. filling ICUs lot southern/southwestern states meaning critical cases also rise. remdesivir hopefully save lots lives, people don‚Äôt die right away either. deaths remain constant go 2-3 weeks now, better job saving lives. deaths go 2-3 weeks, it‚Äôs natural lag diagnose death leading seemingly deceiving numbers seeing right now. brain dead one. go from

Nah, 100% ""normal"" capacity. start rolling back functions convert spaces ICU beds. Governor says electives, frees lot beds. point, financial crisis hospital crisis public. They've lost greatest source income going probably start overtime expensive temp contracts staff new beds becoming dedicated round clock care. country starkly different. federal plan. cannot compared Netherlands. Also studies show kids vectors rarely suffer complications. true, say, ""rarely infectious"". communicate disease often without harming health. That's different. Curious California Texas, two states took different approach, faring well similar patterns. that? Dont let covid bugs bite! Wait either someone love ends ICU dead. I'm sure entertained hardly ever happens

Don't worry, change soon enough. Theoretically yes care. shamed compliance. completely okay go riot destroy places dont live. bad person wearing mask.

I agree US response abysmal. federal government absolutely failed us. month make sure US prepared. say surgeon saying hoard masks beginning thing wrong lacks critical thinking given circumstances. 

While name basically wrong, absolutely wrong.  Sorry, paywall, wanted make account, want thank additional links. illinois way slowed reopening plus mandatory masks indoors, things reopeners can't stand don‚Äôt trust government execute well I'm sure either, even silver rofl.

Everyone wear masks early, mark destinated spots food deliveries, etc. Although number China likely manipulated, th3 real number probably much smaller US'

Many Amercians still think virus going affect themselves. fanboy think ok accept poorly built product. $60k, think expect get car doors properly installed think? get wrong, Tesla's software amazing fixed quality issues, consider getting model 3. live SV cars pretty ubiquitous here. Anyway, people turn blind eye bad QA practices. mean even QA?! That‚Äôs fair success seems stem factors:

-	High compliance regulations. 
-	Regulations scientifically well-informed partial. Compare ‚Äúwash hands don‚Äôt touch face‚Äù advice CDC giving people US beginning outbreaks well-enforced quarantine measures. 
-	Regulations imposed early. wishful thinking virus merely evaporate heat, ‚Äúas magic.‚Äù understand measures vastly effective implemented early, virus reproduces. Somehow evaded consideration many Western health officials.

It good see dense megacity many people wishful thinking winning decisive action. going save lot lives. Yeah like 200 people made billions ya know. Abbott threw hissy fit Jenkins handling like sensible adult layered bunch shit blocks counties enforcing shit like that. It‚Äôs getting mask orders so...it barely moderate concern?

End summer. basically option anymore.

Yeah, we'll see that... Idk surprises anyway. billion dollar corporations. They're going sit idle make zero dollars. better unemployment moment anyway. one force work, want work teslas obligation keep employed? Times tough, need fill position keep production. Anyone gets mad dumb. regular flu season)) I‚Äôm seriously scared us US bad everyone thinks way.....

mask, ventilator? choose..... shock value best. Imagine turning face mask political dick-swinging contest, lol. country doomed. certain humans hardwired way.

I call talking monkeys. know people especially mechanic, service tech, maintenance person. clue anything works iPhone. **Those articles 1/31 2/1!** full 6 weeks isolation well understood. hand, right wing media Trump still downplaying hope somehow ""magically disappear"" bolster Trump's reelection chances despite him, everyone else now, fully informed otherwise causing unnecessary mass death. That's mass murder. find that?  Oh, well Dust Storm absorb hurricanes! Problem solved. Damn run governor! Eh don‚Äôt know. Strict adherence social distancing mask wearing really blunt covid spread. won‚Äôt stop it, keep lid shit sick recovered, go give blood red cross! Red cross free antibody tests successful blood donations. gave blood Monday got results today... negative helped rule cold March people ever realise patients also need days weaned ventilator pneumonia even recovering. think least 3-5 days spent regaining lung strength (based personal experience ICU pneumonia time) 

So best case days ventilator days wean whilst still ICU. two week stint ventilator quickly becomes 3 week ICU stay. **Theranos grabs popcorn**  assume everyone rational thinking person. Diminish effects, bury head sand, blame someone else, deny happening worked far. would jump ridiculous assumption? It‚Äôs likely got propped American companies wanted lockdown end.

The lockdowns enemies supporters. thought put wigs them! Understatement year. traveling say 4 hour car ride within state? mean it‚Äôs pretty selfish think. Stay still shoot deer ice cream? ice cream essential? Surely not, better close factories. Ketchup? Nope! Close down. we're closing things lets close everything smashed bug protein gel factory. essential nutrients one easy squeeze tube. can't spell laughter without laffter. maybe rub dirt walk off.  bet calculated risk. figure chance catching low, birthday happening year. would catastrophic close again? necessary! want get Covid-19's Wild Ride. Yes. 100% correct. One would think lesson learned rest country avoid tragic outcomes. However, doesn‚Äôt seem like case. take freezer trucks filled diseased victims C19 parked hospital parking lots becomes clear? *Sad yeehaw* 
This country needs better leadership. People seriously hurting. Register vote y‚Äôall. would call dick move. "" Very, very, frustrating watch parts country use time prepare fact anti-prepare. went LOT shit part country. ""

The Northeast locked down, point NY, NJ, PA, CT actually improving meaningful fashion, rest country either paid attention mocked us it.

As say, very, frustrating. didnt read article, conclusion title based contact tracing data one county Washington. 

It way early say protests effect spike cases seeing many states. However, appear right fact occured outside prevented disastrous rises. Delayed gratification. wading indicator success.  Yea, may many ICU, least look good able get haircuts. know hard style corpse's hair? money isn‚Äôt liquid, shares stock. It‚Äôs hoarded. That‚Äôs weird. you. Glad keep nice. mention ICU rooms set negative pressure, air flows in, limiting possible droplet spread things like intubation.

Normal rooms pressure controls sense, maintain negative pressure. puts healthcare workers danger. No? Governor could say, sherrif enforcing get paycheck, congrats volunteer. Ya someone else gladly work position. 

Why entitlement? Coming soon surgical theater near Ok? say friend works here's definitive list Disney park openings. said I'm unsure hope open parks. can't think single reason random Reddit users would need info friend's work positions based comment.  much longer still results IFR 0.5%, hasn‚Äôt changed months. confirmation IFR calculated France Italy. best still get it, meant be!

I‚Äôm honestly kinda scared. guess people finally starting realize tax dollars reinvested things like healthcare, education, public infrastructure. Maybe could grow fucking pair say things publicly? FL wears masks they‚Äôll ok.

But instead cases China, daily positives far eclipse Wuhan.

Shame. Wow... 1/5 general population gets permanent lung damage dies this. MUCH BETTER. Lets hit beach! mean, that's one genuine strengths autocracy: genuine emergency, almost always far better speak singular voice singular policy able act full power state. Messaging consistency extremely important situations like this, democracy messaging ever consistent far different parties willing cooperate.

And US, cooperation across aisle basically anathema, are. think drinking disinfectant feel symptoms catch covid without masks ""The majority Delta's employees reported flight attendants, pilots airport agents, less 10,000 administrative staff, working home, according Bastian.""

&amp;#x200B;

You read draw conclusions safety air travel right now. think already people staying resorts Disney property, booked there, holding parks reopen. think FL scared alienating guests. maybe 10 days most. on, government supposed represent us.

You want represent you? much money have......... That's it????? Oh adorable, come back pay want. Haven‚Äôt fireworks every hour every day month Los Angeles? right. respect saying this. wear face nose cant breathe!!! inhale everything also cause breathe!!

God-tier intelligence red hats  Works movies! shit argument. People accomplish shit still shitbags, someone accomplishing shit make immune criticism. know accomplished lot shit? Hitler, Margret Thatcher, Kanye West. None made immune assholery. You‚Äôre allowed criticize people even haven‚Äôt done much them. This- already late. Hope Spring Break worth it. [There‚Äôs 2 whole podcasts that! Never forget that. Dude protests biggest like 2 weeks ago... California liberal state, people conservative state believe smaller government means less government regulations. goes believe, mean even less likely follow mask rule Confusion. Numbers matching up, transparency, leadership, direct path. this, that, mask, definitely mask, disinfect everything, actually need to, stay inside restaurants open, state reports data way,this one another way, ect. death rate already 10 times higher reported.  MAWA; Make America Well Again.

Honestly, leadership abandon us like this? Oh yeah, leadership. changes ive seen less testing, (trump set defund federal testing sites) reporting alrered numbers reporting pneumonia deaths instead covid. family members flew Arizona freaking vacation right now. WHY.  life saving implicitly means immediately life saving.

In UK cancelled elective surgeries. implicitly means immediate life saving surgeries still going ahead despite elective (i.e., done then, needs done quickly, like cancer surgeries, sometimes called semi elective) depends, looked power bi dashboard. county 86 ICU beds full. surge 103. anyone thinks numbers even close accurate, look number deaths reportedly caused pneumonia year vs. previous years. currently around 600% increase. 

The US usually averages around 50K per year, Feb 1 June 13 year 114,000. We've gone approximately 130/day 800. Thought numbers pretty interesting - total deaths Sep 20 different scenarios:

continued lockdown - 20,3k

slow paced reopening - 45k

medium paced reopening - 62.5k

fast paced reopening - 78.3k can't read takes John Hopkins publish data like winds facebook posts, endless articles, politicians mouths. think public policy opinion would change calculated mortality rate 23M infected opposed Guns! must thinking guns! Also TX looks bad... gonna trifecta shitstorms colliding time 4th july.... People gonna wish aliens, w/... largest medical center world. Largest medical complex aka medical campus. It‚Äôs 60+ buildings. ridiculous. They're increasing wealth disparity actively trying get people infected, insisting country can't afford it. Meanwhile super rich taking handouts insisting must kept anonymous, even ever questioned apply need anything. rich country shame. GOP especially utterly shameless. news days made feel like usa flattened curve. nobody saying hospitals almost capacity. worried they‚Äôd run space don‚Äôt think telly stopped talking like figured they‚Äôd stopped getting cases Dude, three months ago hysterical saying SXSW didnt pose significant risk. youre acting like going would pose risk. Calm fuckin tits except get make choice everyone already standard procedure would need compelling argument/case change it. Gay bisexual men higher risk HIV either test screen do. editor added ""yet"" headline earning pay. torn protests. know even wear masks, still spread virus, especially hot t-gas make cough expel bodily fluids. 

The problem is, protesrs vital enactinf change. rhe way get attentiom key matter, fundamental right. again, also contribute virus spread. ugly scenario, pretend factor surge. condescendingly told cases testing more. USA testing roughly numbers (per million people) we're Australia despite problem orders magnitude higher. Crazy apparently first world country. put cop sparked all? recjon should. police department employed monster? whoeveritisinusthat regulates police dpt? Sweden tried didn‚Äôt they? Results like 4% something got antibodies. Abbot writing book Leader Placate Everyone Nothing. Go it. you‚Äôre outside, sitting apart lawn chairs don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs real risk. mentally much better staying isolated. Maybe also put moratorium supply medical grade oxygen using rationale cost. Cost - makes least sense. cost is. guess little Column little Column B. America certainly monopoly treating workers like shit, countries get things right.

In UK example, contracts mentioned. law enshrines civilians ""right private life"" - means contact employer outside workplace must minimum (and usually writing), employees legally need provide contact number unless contract explicitly specifies must contactable / call beyond contracted working hours (and therefore remunerated appropriately).

As well that, also tend better protections workers. get self-certify sickness 7 days without needing doctor's note. means simply call morning say we're still sick expect return. 7 days DRs note needed lay timeframe - that's handed in, company usually contact employee day(s) note expires.

Most companies also pay several days/weeks full pay illness - pay statutory sick pay.

Sick workers can't let go ill absent work (that's say can't find another reason sack you!). However, worked somewhere 2 years - cannot terminated without reasonable cause (gross misconduct / redundancy / prolonged poor performance despite coaching &amp; development etc). Jeez, joke. imagine 10-15 years ago, let alone 25? ""Welp, finished book. guess wait libraries bookstores open again. Anything new Fox?"" (The channel, news network.) ..Soccer.. bet 3/13s 3/14s world forever remember birthday. It‚Äôs like earth stood still something. 

What‚Äôs next? Zombies? Aliens? Another world war? dis gon b gud Homer spoke Bart. worst day till now. knew coming. state federal governments relaxing restrictions reopen businesses people ignoring social distancing sorts reasons, surprise one. Everyone fault degree. United stand; divided fall...and get coronavirus. bigger cultural problem that's long spread beyond state borders. I'd sooner expect Califorgington Exit get away domestic failure. Also pushed us cliff first place. think assume all. need students tuition public funding administrators, level critical thinking stops right there. might hand free ""we're together"" binders orientation guess there's that. well written near damn it, true snapshot moment time. would like add, economy shot, absolutely something, government made huge mistake asking us Brits police ourselves. country half populated fuckwits. Opening early pressure thing, government buckles like aluminium foil mere hint outcry, monitor social media ( Trump) act accordingly.

We need leader monitors social media, get feel, sticks declared. 2m rule cut half outcry, took less week.

I believe Boris Johnson trying bumbling burgeoning best, also believe phones father every night, gets rollicking, makes changes sleep.

Opening country, first making sure NHS could cope way go, beaten first wave, second predicted October, NHS preparing.

 would like point simple fact, 43, 230 deaths records now, estimated much higher.
The government thinking, "" bad"" also knowing poor folks gone, can't kill twice!

The opposition leader much use tits fish. back bone, he's guy stopped prosecution Sir Jimmy Saville fuck sake! ( country's vile devious paedophile).

We're creek without paddle, real chance rescue, captain keeps jumping length rope, chickens gets back boat, opposition leader sits bank pissing himself, ""Glad me"".

God bless all, see ya there. Thanks reading. Worse that. said we'd live it. Er....okay. won't. That's kinda fucking problem. Nah hope protest worth drowning death ü§£ü§£ effective campaign strategy. Bombard people 100000000000 lies people know what's true anymore. people instinctively look authoritative figure, POTUS is. China's good primarily exported where? Never said worse countries. bad look away home burning down, neighbor's house burning more. Climate science political way mask wearing political. great job. Delta nightmare, United sleep paralysis heard medical facilities, doctors, hmo, bill insurance company high prices, insurance forces negogiate discounted rates. multiple factors involving pricing. 1) regulation drug prices, hence pharmceutical companies charge whatever want, always excuse ""R&amp;D"", drugs chronic diseases probably money makers. Good example insulin, used type1&amp;2 time, apparent theres different kinds slow-to fast acting insulin, new ones slighly changed version. Also theres 3 companies producing different insulins aggressive pursue company tries make cheaper alternative court prevent future competition, hence hundred dollars per vial, thats people literally go canadian pharmacies cheap insulin, brand quality, different? Unlike USA, companies/goverment canada regulates negogiate drug prices.
2)when dealing hospitals, ambulances doctors. charge whatever price service give you.
ambulances free, insurance network easily couple thousands.
insurance expensive, quality different one, choose wether cover specific drug procedure, adittion monthly yearly cost go up.
The older are, expensive insurance be.
Personally dont think insurance/healthcare changed much decade, obama became president, people covered healthcare,wether welfare insurance, cost quality(declined) gone up. bad sounds, 15% unemployment massaged number begin carefully designed ways it‚Äôs counted. Real unemployment higher, count underemployment it‚Äôs apocalyptic. I'm sure they'll able put potted plants curtains front bodies, might election time time get sick trick. Good thing COVID-19 hoax.

/s obviously surprise there. live city that's popular tourists I've heard, beaches crowded summer, apparently Memorial Day particularly busy. We've getting surge cases suspect tourists significant part problem. Pretty worried July 4th, city expecting big crowds.  Never said was. read helps around 30% need oxygen regardless, 10 30% means many fewer deaths, deaths could avoided Sweden locked down. Unfortunately people dead can't benefit. Sweden's death rate reflects callous disregard human life. that, think safely say incredibly stupid idea failed. frankly, anyone immunology 101 could predicted this. what‚Äôs difference two? large gatherings social distancing... president cannot see &amp;‚Äô replaced ""people"" ""Americans"" rest world gotten damn hint. Lame duck us repubs act quick hell lightning pass crappy legislation. Trump need sign it. What‚Äôs terrible didn‚Äôt even mention 120k people lost lives, guys track another god knows many.

But point, you‚Äôre exactly uk is
Spent FUCK ton, point they‚Äôve said

Ok enough, you‚Äôre now, safe.
And shut again..


The part America made think wtf cut interest rates 0 like March.. early March??

Like playing best cards start game, reality half way Incorrect. Lesbians demographic group smallest risk HIV/AIDS. Thank god *remainder* hospital woefully *under* capacity staff rearrange hospital units support far occupancy including doubling ICU without putting strain whatsoever entire hospital Redditors sources misleading clearly intentionally inflammatory information put rest people actually know difference bullshit reality. confuses thoughts intelligence. I‚Äôm right you. I‚Äôm nervous people would react lockdowns, particularly confusing messages we‚Äôve getting. ... 

I feel you. members family take seriously all, including parents. know going take seriously one point time though.

Please whenever feel kind symptoms tell stay home. It‚Äôs bad get it, even worse spread it... 

Lets stay touch :) Yeah awful, least UK go couple months later assessment whether it. walk around ICU introduce nurses, show bed ask nightmares/any anxiety panic. Luckily get anything bad people, time let stuff wash me, still get upset loss dignity (being bathed 2 strangers every day, different nurse night day helping pee/dressing you, catheter inspection comes that, demeaning experience anyone go through) couple traumatic experiences still think often. surprise numbers high, fun place be. apologize source amnesia. emissions look clearly fake, time reported live, people look hoax already ignoring masks. Meanwhile, I'm terrified. going alone unfortunately, they're culling smarter sensible community members them. 2 kids: 1st 4th grade. material teachers sent home adequate takes least 3-4 hours per day. tried squeezing hour working home evening dedicated that. barely afford take hour cook dinner.

It‚Äôs brutal... idea possible someone can‚Äôt work home. teachers don‚Äôt collect, much less grade, work there‚Äôs motivation kids try provide. older kid OK younger one withering without social interaction. Eugenics. I‚Äôm 38, married amazing man I‚Äôve 24 yrs, 3 kids, business, etc- would never know I‚Äôm sick look now. Crohn‚Äôs immunosuppressant meds keep check, medical issues. according many, life isn‚Äôt valuable preexisting condition. Apparently people like sacrificed economy, like I‚Äôm part fucking economy society. amount people seen casually talk death people like honestly sickening. used masks since beginning despite government saying otherwise virus spread. chap John Hopkins keeps accusing countries concealing coronavirus data? need inform him. parable youth pastor told never forgotten, although faith mostly died. 

The general gist goes: 

A great flood coming man prayed god save him. neighbour told flood coming begged man come family safety, man said, ""No, believe god save me."" 
The flood waters rose boat stops driver begs man come safety, refuses, praying god save him.
The man retreats roof flood waters begin wash away house. helicopter hovers throws rope him, refuses, believes god save him.
The man dies.
When gets heaven asks god save man god says, ""I sent warning. sent car. sent helicopter. looking for?‚Äù Can‚Äôt said enough. Dude actively pushing COVID conspiracies, downplaying it, etc. ‚ÄúBack normal‚Äù coronavirus disappeared Texas üòÇ think almost believed we‚Äôd fumble around fall would go roof, guess we‚Äôre number 1 coronavirusing Yet, ignore one orders, I'm sure staring barrel gun. means shit even close dangerous thought (and sub wishes).

Sweden presented study, IFR 0-69yrs old .09% meaning get much lower younger people are. *whew* see lot people sub think masks game changer. not. scientific evidence weak wearing masks seem positive effect prevent spreading. That‚Äôs pretty far statement states mask mandate brighter future others. mentality continue see ignorant people wearing masks hugging things continue going south. already done it. I'm Ireland, I'm using numbers I've watched direct comparison, particularly country made poor start locking saving lives 2016 made think anything happen. damn well hope so. Seeing pictures Time Square utterly deserted broad daylight eerie. joke. naive hell thought could stop virus going population. Link? assure Reddit like even without pandemic... Tempted remindmebot comment couple weeks away. did, prefer dollar chase state's lives. 
 
Lt. Gov Dan Patrick literally suggested economy higher priority elderly. think reading George R.R. Martin  hate USA too. can‚Äôt leave, I‚Äôm even usa mean fact cities like New York cases go significantly no. seems people followed social distancing practices wearing masks. search exact figures. people remember long hard lockdown Italy...

No, don't. America bro, remember *shit*.  Lots ks there. 

I'm saying puts perspective. Take like. I'm commenting platform internet. However readers might want take (like me)... take way. 

You call fear mongering could say denial danger. clear everyone I'm saying that. Point magically label you. 125,000 dead counting many counted get tested March/Early April. Many pneumonia deaths heart related deaths 3x normally. That's big deal I'll speak such.

None counting many issues it.

Yes something fear...and respectful intelligent fear of. They‚Äôre trying kiss one man get favors future.

This resulted lives killed families destroyed. yet 'official' count include people die COVID-19 hospital, die home can't afford hospital visit realize hospitals full bother going. include deaths cannot receive treatment stroke, heart attack, deadly conditions healthcare system overwhelmed. going national 4 months guys back square one that's without serious mutation virus live america sound like good person wish strength best get this. funny thing is, already are. 

Bankruptcies medical debt common, Advantage 4.0 model gives lower weights. people loan money know debt excesive... let sink in. mid May, drove downtown Dallas bars restaurants full. masks waiters customers. Crowds outside waiting get tables. Everyone going out. felt like crazy person walked car restaurant get take mask.

Now patients positive tests ever before. almost like idea is, ""sure, might die. least bed!"" Virus doesn‚Äôt care politics. I‚Äôm seeing sides trying argue science logic. protests could come worse time. Michigan toughest orders seeing spike now. People seem realize New York got hit really hard far. rest country get first taste.

The party even started. still pregaming baby. Let‚Äôs see source countries matter!    Enema not, far tell, diseases are. comorbidities, put stress ICUs. least got religion government, right? worked contractor logistics company headquarters 6 months. going bunch restructuring one things surprised (well, wasn‚Äôt super surprised) ‚Äúwon‚Äù contract walmart years lost money every year. could gather, talked underbidding contract promise work sent way later. work never materialized process getting contract left. scummy company. mom stayed 2 weeks open heart surgery. cost nothing! (canada) also made ""brave"" ""coward"" issue. Ridiculous.  bought Clorox wipes today Meijer. Cleaning products finally starting available again.  Thank union calling like letting everybody know Wow. sadness families. Arkansan here. Small towns - hardly anyone wearing masks. Indoor dining happening everywhere here. restaurants require masks walk table, others don‚Äôt require all. People stand halfass lockdown barely two months. literally showed state capitols armed semi automatic weapons shit. There's way ever again. 

It help Trump basically totally coronavirus he's bored it. spoken Dr. Fauci month looked AWFUL congressional hearing day, like bloated wrinkly worn out. 

He's seemingly working self death what? Hundreds thousands people die deranged president refuses anything this? people country selfish stupid can't even make simple adjustments global pandemic? 

It's depressing. Yes! Also, adding Baltimore list paws people QUITE surprise. One biggest clusters Australia came rich folks returning vacations Aspen instead self-isolating went cocktail might optimistic honest. Right? spread across world ravaged multiple states America, could anyone predicted would impact states? could‚Äôve predicted this?

FTFY still think go away April warmer weather like miracle. Uh, California? I'm NW suburbs great here, mask wearing wise...but worry Phase 4 bring summer continues :\ Gyms list skip? Huh. would thought going somewhere everyone increases respiration rate would bad idea. saw potential votes politicians do. Pander them.

Trust me, VA Houston much worse. try understand. Classification IRRELEVANT looking excess annual deaths. entire point looking bottom line avoid classification question.

D'uh. want principled, experienced, morally driven leader. Unlike everyone currently running.

Would prefer old, white, rapist? Cuz that's two different colored ties. love actual proof gets downvoted simpletons. wife works dentist office, get it. Still... scary mouths open shit flying sky blue. grass green. Water wet. Call want want. wrong shutdown again.  accurate tests currently? grandma getting tested tomorrow claims test 40% accurate (she probably got info conservative Facebook page.) would like credible source show ignore results Tragic. hope ease load soon. NYC same. Even though epicenter feel much safer next months I'd feel places politicized virus. Maybe infrastructure thing? Like mode transportation... Gotta make sure works? dunno.

But yeah still bs. them. Protests large gatherings people close proximity - often combined screaming. virus give shit motives politics. protests rallies equally bad spread COVID.

Now, protesting haircuts dumb - easy enough post Facebook find someone would cut hair. got three haircuts lockdown actually ended finding stylist like better normal one! Watched press conference today. learned lot valuable information: wash hands. feel sick stay home.

Thanks, evil cilantro hospitals med centers across states, announce starting particular date, longer admit treat new cases, newly infected, own. rabbits chickens got meat shortages protein could better job...that's saying much lol build wall. Imagine thinking everything Tesla comes Musk.

It's another company, get it. numbers today imply *opposite* claimed. wait hurricane. dust cloud. Also, outdoor protestors using restrooms day. Beds easier find staff manage them. kind like Steve Jobs: he‚Äôs great visionary revolutionize industry change world, real POS real life. [podcast much Elon favorite part personal assistant like decade worked 100 hour weeks running life travelled everywhere asked raise industry standard, told take vacation fired ever came back. mean? lucky one Yup thread Sweden. tagged EUROPE. GLOBAL pandemic. make USA? We're facing this, special snowflake. months late.

It obvious masks help.

The fact avoided many outrageous. lockdowns reopening without proper care soon numbers start going like opening parachute cutting soon falling speed starts decrease

No, parachutes ineffective, neither lockdowns. stupid ineffective loads protesters wearing masks well. Hypothetically, vaccine doesn‚Äôt work? then? effective percentage wise similarly flus 40-60% success rate? long could lockdown for? really thought everyone going listen stay inside months end? realistic expectation humanity. 70 year olds would still supermarkets masks even death toll 10 million right now. That's reality. preservatives Buccees food may actually destroy virus. You‚Äôre genius! Disney getting serious [pressure July 11 reopening. Work ?! mean Earning living ?? Nazi... Fuuuuuck Lets sing absolutely politicians job address systemic issues.

This individual problem.

It's worldwide problem.

It takes collective action policy address systemic issues.  shame right words Trump (and usual rah-rah Fox&amp;Friends) would much voluntary compliance mandates might required.  fucking get it. could anyone possibly think that? country we're fucking fat, Texas LOT obese people. Lack exercise mixed virus fucks lungs dangerous combo. past 6 7 major global pandemics so, literally *every single one* second wave deadly took people surprise. necessarily mean happen time, certainly get hopes up... ..So you‚Äôre okay races also protesting BLM? want blatantly racist matter what? least they‚Äôre protesting something important, instead like Karen wants haircut. wouldn‚Äôt surprised supported Karen back anyway ‚Äúmuh freedoms‚Äù What's happening already painful lesson Ducey bearing hard sooner avoid much deeper pain later on. yet he's learned nothing! ask politely, yet firmly leave mean never REALLY closed begin with. gave governor‚Äôs list ‚Äúessential businesses‚Äù *essentially* included everything. matter competence matter urgency work data available spot gaining data general population. serious studies know done around infected people small group potentially infected people. done intentionally like this. politicians took data made general assumptions, different problem.

A simple systematic also random error occurs e.g. tropics. Simple tests problems differentiating dengue Corona. old dengue test never tested new virus. new virus came China location without dengue, happy test all.

The next problem one test many different tests different errors. So, even one test would systematic error, data resulting one test cannot compared data test.

There simple reason development tests takes time. Time available here. sorry happened Mom. Sounds terrible. could imagine that. 50% rounds up! millions self proclaimed scientists lawyers Book Faces every day. copy/paste repeat spread outlandish things. Say gonna sue state, ADA loophole get wearing masks, mask wearing allow conceal carry therefore takes rights etc... Craziness.
.. Masks PUSSIES! Go ‚ÄòMerica!!! /s There's nothing left.

The jobs gone.

The money gone.

The healthcare going.

The food run low.

The gasoline keep running.

With reason buy it.

Where go?

Who maintains castle? Boy, Dan Crenshaw looks like right now. hard do. makes fool daily basis. stat is? Currently people people went 8-10 1 symptoms comment perfect removed. one fit narrative NPR. much whole, it‚Äôs New York problem everyone lives top theory. next tipping point people celebrate, report on, remember July 4th. Yeah, I‚Äôm trying get test California I‚Äôm (mild) symptoms everything booked. CVS testing time slots literally taken filled form. tried multiple times, time finished form time slot taken keep trying nothing left. 

Everything next three days taken CVS, testing sites don‚Äôt openings July 2nd. :\ Yep! lot nebulous-we know water terrible, even non-science people see that. specific negative outcome? Cancer, acute illness, something else? Maybe them, none? general public really hard time caring consequence super clear-I also suspect that's part issue COVID. USA #1 even corona cases. USA USA USA, Divided States America going wave across us. Looks map time: 

Northeast, upper Midwest northwest hit hardest. improve, south west ramp cases.

Next mountains states Midwest. 

Then back northeast northwest.

Is shitty uncoordinated policy shitty policy allowing something else spread like this... idea Facebook posts count studies. neither....i'm worried something wrong get all.... two coworkers went big party got tested positive Covid-19. rest employees quarantine. Seems hard impossible prove. Great headline build narrative though. AMEN! Yes, Arizona truth seeker orbs... Wisconsin lot, early. got taken away. Every person I've talked assumed opened safe basically eradicated. know opened technicality businesses want continue making money costs. Saturday bad strategy put forth eugenicist psychopaths. absolutely benefit willingly giving avoidable disease simply cultural racism precautions existed since ye Olsen times. Feel AZ, surrounded fools Definitely, personally think probably varies country country. Asian countries like SK mass blanket testing early on, less outbreaks, accurate number. hand, countries like US testing SKs scale, actual count higher is. Plus, many take c19 joke US, numbers way higher reported.

But again, opinion. may may true. You‚Äôd think someone would go. That‚Äôs everyone thought. I've tried look figures Netherlands. april, peak here, source reported average 20 days ICU. end May, head ICU reputable academic hospital reported average 41 days. 50 70 percent overall ICU patient develop Post Intensive Care Syndrome, haunt years. rather bleak. stating issue. I'm sure they've disaster playbook now. I'm suggesting COVID reason they're required open put use. needs talked about. Thank you. ways, Arizona handling *worse* Florida (certainly current results worse): while, Gov. Ducey banned local officials requiring masks. least. Gov. DeSantis gone far. Well, people vote anyway. arguing bad faith. care McDonald's employees 3 months ago now. economy? Fuck right off, America shitty low wage, expendable labor force, fragmented healthcare ways full display mouth breathers trying feign concern now? shitty months ago since fuck face Mcfucker can't go dancing wear mask, suddenly let's scream ""muh economy"" ""muh rights"". Disingenuous best, liars dumbfucks likely. Texan taking seriously, fuck backhanded, bullshit ass, ‚Äúyou deserve it‚Äù comments. 

How dare you? Could elaborate please? Meanwhile country get daily updates 0-1 new case day life going before. Outside world corona news reported much - Houston thong shock me. bold moves, least I'm less worried reading comprehension, haha communities, absolutely, *within* community different matter entirely. regions hotspots rather states. one isn‚Äôt shared much accurate. Post stats ya bub Rural Yakima county WA 250k people. Local hospital full weeks. county ""lockdown"" since beginning citizens businesses complying. 
  ‚ÄúUmmm... I‚Äôve uh didn‚Äôt study test...‚Äù -Mike Pince It‚Äôs almost like things Bernie said true 38k??? Holy shit buckle fam. Also find highly suspicious low hundreds deaths days suddenly it‚Äôs 2.4k one day. 

Remember this. feeling way things going numbers seriously suppressed. death count alone show that..130 today, 200 next, near 300 whoopsie 2.4k next day!! remember many freaking Spring Break beginning outbreak, two months later care risk protests pose. intending get political, understand gov'ts rush get everyone sick/dead. purely stop November election? mean seriously, what's going States looks criminal. states learned happened NY/NJ past months Coronavirus. It‚Äôs going long months out. rest US. Suck blow. dearly hope grow one day.

Coming person saying ESS JAY DUBYAS!? Kind rich think? add area next top 100 University. University students usually seem follow mask policy That's disgusting response. Hi, I‚Äôve noticed couple comments. want say it‚Äôs sad you‚Äôre getting education you‚Äôre paying deserve time. I‚Äôm also going school teachers staff university working incredibly hard make sure every student getting education deserve. Perhaps it‚Äôs worth conversation professors, advisor, counselor? I‚Äôm sure also find subreddit college here. Maybe try talking people? know school shut encouraged exchange numbers like could continue work homework together continue make connections others age.
As hanging friends, social distancing doesn‚Äôt mean can‚Äôt see friends, means little bit space between. Or, even better, mask. Interesting enough wearing masks already common cultures sign sickness people don‚Äôt want get community sick. wearing mask caring around you.
Some saying would come back October quarantines lockdowns right everything else followed. That‚Äôs hoping see pattern virus, like good portion viruses season spike in. Unfortunately didn‚Äôt happen way.
You‚Äôre right, can‚Äôt live fear. Living fear actually terribly unhealthy us, live caring one another. That‚Äôs simply what‚Äôs asked you‚Äôre told wear mask social distance.
You seem like someone wants answers questions, awesome. It‚Äôs amazing inquisitive mind want learn, it‚Äôll get far. 
One last thing add, there‚Äôs lot quality video conferencing apps days. you‚Äôre feeling lonely wanting talk friends maybe see convince hop talk? Michigan. We‚Äôve protests too, cases rose little, we‚Äôre delaying moving next phase reopening. Well, expect guy eats steak well done Let‚Äôs honest. Walking dog outside alone isn‚Äôt virus spread. New York City bunch people appendicitis could've removed, spent night post-surgical ward, sent home. Instead, appendices burst, flooding abdomen infection, patient ICU clears up, *then* surgery, recover, finally sent home week two weeks after. live Houston Texas, send help... Wait till wins re-election, pandemic, botched handling. Welcome New Saudi Arabia! mean possibly true npr anything game. ‚ÄúYeah sucks loved one died mean, it‚Äôs 0.27% death rate, even though might die people simple compassion, followed lockdowns, stayed inside, hang friends!11!!!‚Äù

Try saying someone who‚Äôs lost someone see goes. neck woods Inland Empire, see people wearing masks they're grocery shopping. Thank you. plan contacting supervisor/head preschool still switch virtual learning next week two. also contact principal. Unfortunately, HR great option me. Ducey followed guidebook ""How make worse"" Honestly....yeah

That‚Äôs reality now. someone said people couldn‚Äôt handle staying home swaths entertainment available us via phones internet couple months order save thousands lives....I feel like fellow americans scoff another stay-at-home order. mention businesses barely kept head water 1st wave 2nd one would drown them. Especially small pa businesses. America‚Äôs operations would laughable weren‚Äôt devastating. contain killing vulnerable?

**Massachusetts** - 1,155 dead per 1 million residents.

**Texas** - 80 dead per 1 million residents.

**Florida** - 155 dead per 1 million residents.

**California** - 147 dead per 1 million residents.

**Vermont** - 80 dead per 1 million residents.

**Maine** - 77 dead per 1 million residents. know. disgusts everybody know. problem there's enough people give fuck single human life matter, situation like that's matters. Oh no. again. Good bot Patients moved Texas Children‚Äôs hospitals; one fits They're poorer population overall many preexisting conditions. Furthermore, social distancing difficult many Navajo even live homes running water go communal well there's lots travel. Basic needs like groceries also require longer trips interaction see compared average citizen. also see many multi-generational households well resulting spreading among family units larger families smaller homes average.

In addition, also indeed poor healthcare choices infrastructure compared average American. 

The Navajo Nation contains spectacular natural beauty landscapes one see US life often quite shitty overall. start ventilator rationing now. anything like Italy, one 60 get vent all. one underlying conditions like diabetes, cancer, heart disease, obesity. triage. let people die barely intervention all; cannula oxygen drowning patients. think people really understood happened there. print really think pictured it. now, here. internet brought us age stupidity misinformation

Nah, people always here. internet gives voice makes visible. ONE day almost hit half Canada TOTAL. lot rights state variety amount people. lefts states. say moderates anything else.  Americans also upset homelessness problem, somehow set connection broken social system (or overreaching housing zoning regulation matter) hospital Yakima county WA capacity weeks. Routinely shipping patients hospitals state COVID things like strokes. Police chief also stated today would enforce mandatory masking. Shit fucked. 
 told father sunbathing tells ""you know UV light kills thing that's good thing do."" felt like straight Trump's mouth. definitely recoiled. mean WTF??! don‚Äôt want laugh but... hope people continue eating less meat dairy this. Again, implies say implies control excess fatality rate arise NYC outbreak causing straining healthcare resources known increase fatality rates, control actual population infected biased towards elderly people NY nursing homes particularly hardly hit policy returning patients longer critical nursing hime came from. 

That - statement 'city X IFR 2%' statement 'the expected outcome COVID-19 IFR 0.3%' wholly compatible IFR highly variable. Highest number cases today states. Ok made laugh pretty good. say though, clarity, believe numbers either. Whatever truth is, I'm sure actually transparent it.  wont last forever. bit. This. mention NY happened, nurses across country flew NY help out. 2nd wave, everyone burnt busy dealing domestic disasters bother helping Texas. old article. know getting posted today. know Serj SOAD politically democrat, course, drummer republicans....guess new music comming ever Considering last time peak ended 3k deaths day, indication going go her, January 189 days away... guess seems likely  capacity? aren‚Äôt even close. stand corrected - glad I'm wrong. told way back March. base ICU bed count? many occupied non-COVID surge? sadly, even complex big, massive bottlnecks resource distribution within facility.

&amp;#x200B;

With 100,000 employees, many infected. hospital crippled eventually   Starship Troopers model. wait, Adderall time? Horrifying thought must like without it! US failing bad? Arent meant best world? yup. ""re-open"" protesters  33.3.... Repeating course... Chance corona  Oh awesome! told start lockdown sister law (doctor working UK). Im glad appear wrong now. wish implement mandatory mask order. However said inevitable eventually. Culture different. least 30% people likely won‚Äôt follow social distancing measures matter what, even mandatory mask order, US police likely won‚Äôt enforce strictly. Also mandatory social distancing order likely face protests lawsuits. state government want deal potential trouble. US population also highest risk tolerance compared developed countries. Amount fearless people far higher most. 

With around 30%, that‚Äôs 90-100 million fearless population healthy youths. Nothing much done stop large group ignoring virus. one moving I'm done grad school. Already started visa application process New Zealand. work public school children severe social, emotional behavioral issues. vast majority kids taught reading, writing arithmetic. 

It‚Äôs punch neighbor scream flip table mad. (Possibly spite parents modeling behavior). 

Distance learning isn‚Äôt even remotely viable option kids. general question. often cities reach 100% ICU capacity normally Taking partisan hat moment, would like ask President Biden would seen materially different results cases deaths.

If so, how?

I'm agnostic Trump rhetoric current thought is, there's really much could done, since states governors control borders. Well know left wing dystopia better pandemics right wing dystopia.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks 2020 useful facts... guess... US give plenty aid. wait... trickle you. modeling team predicted 150,000 cases AZ September. sounds like lot, 2,200 cases day. past 7 days they're averaging 2,721 cases. stay pace next 66 days they'll 170,000 cases. think hypothesis average person might notice right away obvious athletes perform peak levels. Well thank God protests showing black lives matter by, know, drastically increasing COVID-19 minority communities. Anyone who's actually concerned black lives like opposed protests favor social distancing, wearing masks. 1 man unjustly murdered, therefore start protests dangerously spread COVID-19 black community, already dis-proportionally affected? makes sense. Yup Thank providing source! I'll try show bloody stupid. comment *capitalism* political now? ü§¶ end goal limit number deaths vaccine developed administered. Failing that, successful treatments (because point really severe cases sind cytokine storm develop blood clots brain swelling).

With cases soaring south, whether hospitals fully prepped tested. governor Texas seems confident, time he's calling mandatory masks shutting things again.

Personally, someone really f#cked immune system multiple immunosuppressants(I aggressive form adult onset still's disease), wearing mask now, life changed much. always treat public excursions possible infections flu season life threatening.

The hardest witness pandemic covid's spread central america africa. African countries used dealing pandemics may escape worst, central america isn't, hospitals prepared.

During 1918-19 Spanish Flu pandemic, one third world's population died. 600% increases. mean stupidity could easy assume 50% increase numbers it‚Äôs neglect best.  football/baseball open stadium fine long everyone wears mask. people SC either. even see elderly employees grocery stores wearing masks. Insane like Desantis personally ruling death. medical examiners 67 counties. Many bosses governor's political adversaries. type conspiracy hint would require Borg-level coordination. call bullshit soon provide evidence bullshit. sure making America great situation sucks. But, I'm intervene. Good luck. Sorry die. Relying able divert another hospital sounds like standing tree rainstorm thinking move another tree gets soaked through. People keep blaming Trump catastrophic failing curbing COVID spread, yes Trump total asshat. true culprit American people. arrogance entitlement complete lack responsibility lead point. Inside vs. Outside dude - whole Lake Ozarks bit - inside vs. Outside. Joe Biden here. Best cheaper insurance millions uninsured.  Oh bring ICU beds ‚Äúin pinch‚Äù huh? Tell boyfriend‚Äôs friend worked Elmhurst temporarily found dead patient floor bed. Patient died, another patient metal chair nearby, put dead patient floor covered blanket patient could bed. That‚Äôs overrun were. 

I guess that‚Äôs mean huh. Hopefully least morgue capacity staff keep bodies piling up, sometimes becomes bottleneck keeping ICU beds full virus. Honestly take virus ignorant. ""just boost vitman D, get injections, etc."" That's easy someone makes $250,000 podcast say, avarage person Yup

COVID19 dies almost instantly sunlight.

Also airflow outside makes really hard transfer.

But doors? party? yea. happening part US. hospital beds left nobody manage them. course do. gov't take serious first heard smh Look.. hate trump much next (logical person) stop blaming entirely him? one remembers massive protests? Common people stupid message spread stupid people easily misunderstand everything this. clear, really suggesting autocracy way better democracy -- that, certain situations, incredible value power centralized. Emergency response much one these, assuming government handles emergency competently takes advice legitimate experts.

Although China handled covid19 perfectly, fully locking regions arguably best possible way prevent spread -- even costs individual liberty certain set population. absolute non-starter US, can't even bothered wear masks get haircuts six months.

Democracy _can_ respond emergencies like effectively, sheer number people required buy major policy shifts occur make this, nature, slower prone fuckery non-cooperative parties. Germany, France, Italy far less fuckery, US great deal, hence continually escalating crisis.

Again, I'm saying autocracies less prone croneyism US, far, far fewer hurdles must jump enact sort plan.

As footnote, really say American government done ""what's best people"" long time. Chadox1 originally created treat MERS-CoV already passed evaluation safety prior discovery SARS-CoV-2. recent trials moreso evaluate efficacy (immune response/dosage/frequency etc) potential unwanted ADE response humans (evidence looks promising far). I‚Äôm San Diego see everyone wearing masks inside places business. Outdoors people lax wear get near others part. stupid person get? Part hopes he‚Äôs looked Reddit comments discussing get bit perspective 

Basically killed elderly relatives Except everyone gets fever people contagious symptoms. Add list ‚Äúat risk‚Äù people (as well people households would also need isolate catch pass them) quite large. elderly obese, diabetes, high blood pressure, autoimmune, list goes on. still don‚Äôt know enough virus it‚Äôs long term effects let run though society. 

The difference flu, less contagious probably less deadly, get herd immunity vaccination. 

Even death rate 0.5% lower, numbers calculated across population different countries would staggering nothing like flu causes, let alone additional deaths due overrun health systems leading people dying causes without health care available. would significantly increase mortality rate excess deaths. 

There great solution see plays time. didn‚Äôt go full lockdown here. like ‚Äúlockdown lite‚Äù. got control deal cases opening without health systems overrun. Purely anecdotal, work large company NYC. employee I've communicated left NYC spending time elsewhere. Easy flatten curve significant portion population leaves. point even Trump cronies longer deny happening look way. Sadly, direction look pile bodies.

Take care. Stay safe. own. Thank much also Jingle Way told someone large good brain heats virus go away really good pr b good way pass money connections kids saying leave money would call ‚Äúgovernment conspiracy.‚Äù It‚Äôs one part people power don‚Äôt want know, one part minimizing numbers forced acknowledge, rest incompetence local bureaucratic level. Many local coroners small towns don‚Äôt ability test coronavirus infectious diseases. local hospitals nursing homes may administration would prefer coronavirus stats - even noticed doctors anything old people dying pneumonia. Never assume conspiracy stupidity laziness provide explanation need. wearing mask. we‚Äôve treating people hallways COVID nyc. 1.6k - 1.8k ‚Äúprobable deaths‚Äù added New Jersey.. real number around 600-700 Yes Stop spreading virus around first. That's responsibility. Canada/London/Australia English speakers.

Home countries ethnics. Depends careers etc.   Live generally conservative area taking seriously tbh. got potential 20% way freezer trucks full dead people. far strategies go, think factor alone prompt desire look alternative options.  chuckled really hard this. HR keeps organization safe, you. 28% covid, definitely agenda post. unfortunate state leaders fucked enough hope miracle happens guess reality. Europe hope, they've actually shown possible get thing control. much this. hospital leaders Texas, across nation saw coming. time ramp prepare surges. could looked NYC Wuhan do.

&amp;#x200B;

There time prepare. didn't, entire leadership hospitals try replaced, jailed. whatever criminal charges thrown stick. one thing civilians act idiots. another hospital administrators hear healthcare workers first responders across nation die trying weather this. hospital administrators going weeks trying see survive. sure, profit chasing. covid hit ones trying deep red years end. administrators kept heads Trump's butt whole time, deserve thrown front line get COVID this. Hell no. love 4th July I‚Äôm staying home. won‚Äôt kill miss fun year. I‚Äôm sad I‚Äôm trying die. us never got unemployment.

Starve? hostility towards you, OP, lack plan, path, assistance so-called leaders. God damnit! 

Sorry rant. wearing masks outdoors vs not-wearing masks indoors great system guys Unless want bump salaries 40% across board isn‚Äôt possible. It‚Äôs cute say let‚Äôs go back single earning households , there‚Äôs reason 80% households dual earners now. 

We live decent middle class life even removed daycare costs, we‚Äôd barely scrape without going debt. GOOD shape don‚Äôt live beyond means. 

40% country less $1,000 bank. Exactly. average citizen affected almost 4 months damn NBA able prepare testing January/February think government could too... We're #1! We're #1! We're #1! wish well. Birx chance matter Johnny Dingbat gonna wear mask. like financially literate people know buy.

Financially literate people substantial amounts lying around invested excess already average Joe buying stocks poppin champagne, time gtfo (or play short game)

Speedrunning bankruptcy? would great strategy. Okay... Say start wearing makes. still hopefully slows bit. virus still active. suppose do? can't stop it, delaying inevitable completely kill what's left economy? 

This shitty situation one seems know do. often ends anyway. Except time weeks ago decided say masks longer mandatory thoughts exactly, Repugnants pretty much given pretences. really give crap die virus. seems they're going act like Corona virus exist anymore. Back Business usual. need insurance virus.ü§∑ person "" big brain' think. üôÑü§¶ 95-99% properly fit-tested N95s virtually protestors wearing. cheap paper homemade cloth mask reduces spread best 40%. I'm watching S. Korea honestly felt like America couple weeks away really getting ahead cruve...then guys let gas. Well states. teacher, also realize lots parents send child school even sick think too. different virus. Plus, trying keep students separated school day impossible. That's harebrained scheme made central office administrators completely touch actually goes school/classroom. worry going ‚ÄúMIRACULOUSLY‚Äù GO AWAY APRIL. hype. Australia open NZ outside victoria. 877 free beds converted. 28% ICU patients COVID beds likely free faster. hospital full means CEO notes hit 100% capacity non COVID scenarios. Sadly, 2-3 weeks *after* NYC locked down. scary none states done anything significant besides Texas canceling surgeries, things continue get worse least 2 weeks today. end economy suffered would prioritized health controlled virus. Yes, I'm sure would accomplished going space without him. Imagine delusional. also think strains hitting Europe much powerful ones hitting Asia. came hard needed would done month instead going everything Three months still getting headlines soaring numbers states. agree, unfortunately boss lacks leadership matter good are. still middle-manager shit system one accepts leadership accountability. Black lives matter nobody elses. leadership me, they're corporate overlords. Yup. Considering doofuses believe affordable housing synonymous brain defect; Carson's placement seems pretty fitting. Free beds doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean people run though. saw happened New York didn‚Äôt enough staff equipment. mention looking exponential growth. Surge capacity may last us think 10-14 days said? happens that? think problem staff manage them

Maybe hospitals recruiting paying hazard pay instead furloughing reducing comp right left.

New York eventually figured paid enough people would come state. Even virus first China knew little scientists said high end estimate 2%. Since every agrees lower 1% now. probably somewhere around .5 - .75% based studies I've looked at. Still much higher magnitude flu, quite scary things first developing China. sure it‚Äôs wise bringing babies world fully reopen fall

A little confident point Thats it. Wait til 400 nurses big ass fancy hospital call sick w Covid. doctor twitter said, we've point small 'ripples' ... first wave building, happened yet... guess first wave ends around sept/oct next one begins December w/ Flu season. can‚Äôt afford pay unemployment . remain open. . much cost rent refrigerated trucks? We‚Äôre going need lots those. gov frantically building temporary hospital? Really. Why? wanna blame someone blame crippled dumbass. like watching someone jump plane giving update every 10 seconds.  
 

10s ""i'm falling""

20s ""still falling""

30s ""by way believe gravity wearing parachutes goes freedom. Still falling""

40s ""wonder ten seconds i'll still falling i'll start move upward time....""

50s ""no, still falling"" said, patients remain ventilator weeks.

This main part, part poignantly sad people focus that. main note ""when people need ICU support, usually need WHILE."" people going inpatient day later. weeks many cases cases. bed turnover likely fast enough free beds surge continues. Tell one shutting again? 

&amp;#x200B;

oh right ""The Economy""... That's kills me, ""You catch flies honey, lol course I'm using either fuck you"" 30.6 million hook means, eye eye, maybe he'd listen. NYC created additional capacity partially used along rest region. extra beds staff brought in, system would overwhelmed. thinking crisis Houston.  read quarter beds taken covid-19 patients? hell 75% capacity without? ruin good panic.  Mass testing best strategy - even developed countries capacity yet. Idk. say someone underweight morbidly obese everything throughout life honestly think Americans used many us bigger people take offense clinically medically obese. Even 80 lb weight loss I'm BMI 29 medically quite obese still overweight. I'm wearing size medium shirt size 10 pants. People probably call fat anymore I'm still clinically overweight. hope let poor animals go instead locked people followed rules. followed medical guidelines reopening. Netherlands starting reopen. reopening also based medical guidelines.

In US, medical guidelines reopening many states experiencing surges reopened even though met guidelines. Instead, bowed political business pressure. June 25th, results. 

US: 36,000 new cases

Denmark: 21 new cases (1/60th US population equivalent 1210 new cases US) 

Netherlands: 110 new cases (1/19th US population, equivalent 2090 new cases US) Ice cream food items essential. Without calories, die, provide calories. 

Nobody dies without football.

EDIT: go little deeper point, stopped making ice cream, we'd need ramp production calories make difference. Making ice cream dangerous than, say, making cake, even fictional protein gel whatever said.

On hand, live football dangerous pandemic, lots entertainment options carry risk. even want argue entertainment essential, shortage books, video games, hobbies could take fill gap. think point COVID (a novel disease) brought ICU usual 70%-80% (from typical ailments) current 100%. but, want reduce money towards research... done properly, would greatly slow advances medicine.

  say money.. mean paying researchers.. would likely small compared current middle level costs..  hear stories SALESMEN retiring rich 45 went around pushing drugs local doctors, etc... horrible. Reminder ONE hospital 4th largest city USA. clear -- 100% *NORMAL* operating capacity. still ""It completely normal us ICU capacities run 80s 90s,"" Methodist Hospital CEO Dr. Marc Boom said. ""That's hospitals operate."" almost like images media choose show. Send food, green chile breakfast burrito Blake's, settle Golden Pride. Amazon thing warehouse workers believe needs connected main oxygen supply hospital

No... made work portable tanks.  actually article lot free beds (877) used capacity. CEO notes often run 80% capacity 90+ uncommon work arounds. calculated based total confirmed test cases state total deaths confirmed tested cases state. based numbers published 9.4%. state also saying same. 
Not sure trying say lot untested positive cases not. so, also lot untested positive deaths. reason happening Houston. similar outbreak would happen somewhere else fewer people would need ICU treatment, hospitals get overwhelmed. Overwhelmed ICU's easy call. sad discrimination wantonly reckless, victimized idiocy. Stock market up!! True dumb, without change behavior don‚Äôt see numbers start trend again. Even lockdown happened today would take 7-14 days numbers start trend down. Texas ""Keeps conditions leading soaring virus stable unchanged."" get point, good one, think addressing  different issue whether news/pundit media, general, good job opposed weather went way misinform, facts well known, even knowing would cost lives. fact Trump charge country. want point post sounds like think grow beds there. track state. Also ... lotta downvotes one. chance reinfection thing biggest reason I've taken seriously. known yet. Wear mask dummy go ""herd immunity"" concert anything stupid like that. *Fourth July entered chat* really much stretch. Sure, protests likely caused amount new cases numbers people gathering protests, certainly said virus efficiently spreading outside spaces. Also, tons people wearing masks protests indoor gatherings family friends even work colleagues rarely right now. true current spike virus hitting young people most, likeliness infecting parents, grandparents, at-risk co-workers high resulting spike hospitalizations/deaths later on. stories country infected young people showing birthday parties/family get-togethers result dozen family members sick, parents grandparents ending ICUs sometimes dying. I‚Äôm Ottawa active case count steadily declining weeks. It‚Äôs ~55 atm, one person currently hospitalized due covid city 1000000 people. importantly numbers low enough contact tracing viable. Lordy. tapes. We've done like ... 4. pretty apparent time now. many positive antibody tests. really good news. Awesome news, that's u flatten 2nd wave Source that? three weeks see hospitals beds? lived Randolph 10 days ago. Nobody Randolph wears masks. 

My new town seemingly better regard wonder political right Sweden thinks, Sweden's leftist government playing severity virus. communicated messages mixed, put lightly. governors good job. elective surgeries hospitals make money. depend taking care sick people, they'd bankrupt quickly. New York coming peak, hospitals upstate NY hammering Cuomo reopen elective surgeries.  HCP PTSD going epidemic epidemic. 

Most HCPs never seen anything like this. like domestic war broke out, dramatically traumatizing. ICU nurse here. went Covid CT yes patients take 4 weeks ventilator very, bad. Seriously bad. Would love front line health care workers hospital know real situation is. inject photons veins sharpened fiber optics. aggressive gaslighting. Hey Brendan, tell friend Joe send autographed picture? New York don't. Drop dead losers I‚Äôve reiterating last several months it‚Äôs infuriating many people go silent say it. think become norm honestly. states counties reopening, find highly unlikely send everyone back isolation cases inevitably spike again. second wave worse first. Mentioning probably seek therapy isnt insult, suggestion, based behaving. sure call went like that

because part compensation package pride. want naive people sell souls chance put name new tech mean add another 900 beds case surge so....¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  Australia imposed restrictions doubling cases every 3 days 2 weeks behind Italy.

All actions (or non-actions) taken various countries based predictions told us would see 2-3M deaths end March. Everyone understandably scared fuck. can't eradicate viruses live them. cases numbers spiking death rate remains low happy outcome welcome new cases. Australia go lockdown. Public transport remained open supermarkets. speed limits roads set 12mph/20kph road deaths would eliminated seen practical solution set speed limit higher allow deaths roads. practical solution CV would isolate risk people let people carry flu. Give everyone thermometer tell stay home temperature. time jump exact moment falling elevator hits ground, even scuff raybans History forever remember Donald Trump put health economy health people. means everybody ends constantly sick dead. There's multiple people who've Coronavirus virus twice, immunity period lasts months.

It's weird think might currently living end days. know everybody dismiss think it'll soon, point time end humanity happen there's reason now.

According article places already open remain so, it‚Äôs going reopening businesses yet reopened. pharmacist gave chill pill. Nice.

Can't donate blood country ever again. idea UK do, take mad cow risk, guess. ironic thing going vegetarian phase never ate meat all. Fortunately there's one statistic that's hard fake, that's all-cause excess mortality. lines pretty well reported covid deaths, everyone's *big surprise*. Yup. least WA, small towns much still gatherings. related news, biggest hospital Yakima Valley full capacity. sure showed city folk certain political persuasion! answered people, true problem I'm referring subtly triage prioritize resources, outwardly advertising ""humane"" thing.

Certain liberties high cost less benefits advertised. imagine anything science it. Isn‚Äôt funny quote random people surrounded random people making quotes? mean, words someone named ‚ÄúF.A. Hayek‚Äù carry weight words random redditor (who might said something equally profound)?

Sayings judged merit, said them. firmly believe that.  Florida counting? would thought would learned lesson back 2000. Shit, positive integers, fucking quaternions. guess could say using imaginary numbers though. Coming someone lives state seemingly one wears mask‚Äî say requiring masks, people getting fined wearing one? strictly enforced? like idea, would help tremendously get saying. 120K dead Americans horrible enough? actually visited them? New York subway system looks like cleaned since built worried parts collapse head, Miami floods every time rains, streets LA many potholes practically neef 4WD... literally could go route gained support, instead party talking heads decided opinions plandemic conspiracy nothing mild flu hilarious part Trump fans really buy every word mad man feeding them.. far stop testing ban positive save world something absurd crazy coming POTUS's mouth.

I think trillions times better might tad appropriate So, case, doesn‚Äôt mean mortality rate far 2 3% predicted earlier? That's messed man  husband works nearby hospital we‚Äôve serious discussions finding another field work in. really pisses people wanted call ‚Äúbrave‚Äù say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù beginning pandemic going large groups refusing wear masks. performative bullshit exhausting. need unity right like non time before, goes well beyond state lines. Stay strong positive example community, it‚Äôs long road ahead know shit I‚Äôm talking I‚Äôm talking nationwide. 

It doesn‚Äôt way states hit hardest. best support show love ones right thing time since media wants focus ones embarrassing said states? come together give ones taking serious love bet turn tables crisis real fast. hardest hit states need love support, who‚Äôs movement change thing? There's big fat solution two. take closer month play going to? US ~30'000 new cases per day *this* week. really need hope become NY-level fatality rate worse. Maybe they're catching earlier &amp; treat needed earlier stages infection. want die Covid. thank victims, sympathize try change system work better (by voting politically active) 1200 suppose cover /s vaccine become available work January (let's say) happen.

It go healthcare workers nursing home/hospice patients first.

Then politicians, sports stars, minorities, massive campaign get people vaccinated huge push back. 

The 2024 US presidential campaign probably centered around vaccine.

Unless dies (which could happen) come great treatment (which also could happen).

Anyway, vaccine magic bullet come weeks months. no, us. Frankly, we‚Äôre sorry seem exporting unique brand ignorance stupidity globally. Sigh. - drove NYS CA last week South Dakota Wyoming Montana, one gave shit. Y'all dumb fuck. wigs help i'm freaking CA county great access free testing, % positives shot up....to 2%.

Florida, Texas, AZ FUCKED. truly hope rest world watching close, viewing sick twisted underbelly rotten nation.

We are. least economy open. fine. /s says NYC reached herd immunity? read somewhere else 2.6% population confirmed covid-19 case. Also, immunity occur resistance virus needs rest lives. that's proven far know. Netherlands say survived Covid-19 immune least three months nothing known. Also, amount symptoms seems level immunity afterwards. symptoms seems immunity. lots based clinical research, practice. Yep, nephew left severely reduced lung capacity, 6 weeks since virus, lungs operating 30%, go running internationally struggling keep 80 yo grandfather. Sure, fit narrative. guess we'll compare 2 extremes, China vs US. Floridian here. fun live near mecca retirement nobody gives fuck. We've ""open"" weeks promise go bar area find at-risk population absolutely stacked talking ""democrat hoax"". consider progressive supposed give fuck? people would benefit restrictions masks absolutely care.  can't imagine family's grief. sad. one cares ""United States America"", Asia 90% people still taking precaution, mask, social distancing, sanitization. Heck like BDSM party everyday city people suffocate heat sweat condensed mask still wearing it. They're making easy Biden. come 3 4 minimal concrete proposals look like new Roosevelt Kennedy. 

""Before next year out, administration, able test every American corona virus. provide medical-grade masks everyone vulnerable. provide PPE healthcare workers. choose easy, hard, goal serve organize measure best energies skills."" New symptom confirmed made laugh wish could give award There‚Äôs huge dichotomy southern California Northern California handling (obviously exceptions don‚Äôt @ SoCal town pro mask, I‚Äôm speaking generally) there‚Äôs also issue terms wealth. poor people know Bay Area basically stuck are, however people know $$$ driving Napa every weekend go dinner (restaurants still open around afaik) going half moon bay staying hotels, basically actual vacation traveling greatly increases chance multi county transmission. bay won‚Äôt let stores buildings without mask, got yelled day mask hiking alone passing one person trail; SoCal (moving uni apartment) literally one mask seemed give shit. Quarantine 2 weeks come stay Scotland :) I‚Äôm Germany home schooling wasn‚Äôt perfect. 7 y/o 2nd grade wasn‚Äôt perfect, tried best went better expected. She‚Äôs already back school hours reduced, almost back plan. 99,5+% die. wholeheartedly agree colleges remain closed primarily online safety's sake, hard institutions, especially private ones, justify 25k semester tuitions educating primarily online. lot institutions buying connections rather proper education, taking away collegiate sports really brings light fragile financially dependent lot private schools are. Seattle qualify open Phase 2 guidelines. business lobbies made Phase 1.5. governor caved entering Phase 2 even though highest infection rates state Washington. really trying enforce mask wearing theres hardcore dumb group people refuse. almost like theres cult leader telling boogeyman get dont spread plague. Oh...:( CONQURED EUROPE Common, Texans. Go big go home!! this. win. cases win!!! Everything bigger Texas, baby!!!

... including Greg Abbott‚Äôs ego. Screw this. I‚Äôm moving New York. indeed! thanks! willing adapt re-openings too, rather static plan doesn‚Äôt evolve new data. things moved forward phases, got pushed back. also plenty protests, almost wearing masks still new spike. Masks, distancing, careful thoughtful reopening... things really work. I‚Äôm going pissed new spikes states end spilling back NY. sister's Italian father-in-law diagnosed cancer. March year, thousands cases daily. Yeah, get surgery get right away. Try 450 million free movement area smaller USA. States closed borders, like eu countries. think need learn tell time dude... Please implement Illinois too. #fuckapple really, really miss boyfriend. lives US I‚Äôm Canada. It‚Äôs 100 days since we‚Äôve seen other. fly US issues - big risk would be? Obviously would wear mask entire time sanitize much possible. think airlines enforcing use masks everyone board. 

It‚Äôs frustrating. don‚Äôt want fly - want drive 20 minutes takes get house, can‚Äôt. doubt border open time soon (and don‚Äôt want to). incredibly stupid? want see him.  Trump : said people, slow
down testing. Portland protests everyday 30 days straight related spikes known months average person know it. media incompetent bringing enough. wether shut right long run, time given happened italy/new york, considering whats happen texas also weeks.... Thanks Don‚Äôt take word links share. That‚Äôs generally works, though; lockdowns go place (competent) leaders realize it‚Äôs spreading fast. 

Then you‚Äôve got 2-3 weeks cases infected initial pre-lockdown spread... everyone manages behave point, starts flatten curve. 

Or least, that‚Äôs seemed play us started get sent home/telework around mid/late-March. took little longer shut non-essential business, curve tapers downward couple weeks successfully put place. 

Watching what‚Äôs happening back home, relative safety country reacted well, knowing *no reason* couldn‚Äôt done same... maddening, infuriating, disappointing, devastating. can‚Äôt pick emotion, many. Except lockdowns ruining economies developing countries well. truth Gays HIV non gays? doubt do. used give blood always ask questions sex drug use. proved gays more. dont trust group wants blame another group especially health driven topic. test blood already care person does. really believe someone without test. 2% wealth tax assessed annually would able finance universal basic income $1000 / person, including children forever.

For example, someone net worth 100 million dollars would pay 2 mil / year. sick month (or longer) they'll likely remain contagous time. places know using rule thumb days symptoms disappear. Man, stupidity people literally blows mind. cal, shit, either wear incorrectly all. Even though it‚Äôs mandated. Stores place signs doors stating without mask won‚Äôt able shop. bad corporations care money, look way. It‚Äôs frustrating, hoping would calm winter, man go done hill quick. see said recommended general public health officials time quarantined. thing ethical Billionaire

I wonder reddit turn Gates Everyone read shout along. It‚Äôs great rant. could move around dates show cases going like Kemp GA. reason negative, people want die economy. 126,000 already civil war. Half country stupid arrogant right thing thus splitting country more.... Idk outcome be. terrible didn‚Äôt even mention 120k people lost lives, guys track another god knows many.

You're right, explicitly mentioned them. (no /s) thought implied saying. part America made think wtf cut interest rates 0 like March.. early March??

Our rates, world's rates super low decade. People screaming raise them, Fed would ammo needed it.  since '08 they've essentially 0. We're lucky rates raised little years ago could drop little now. formalised plans place  would probably equivalent county metropolitan region shutting down. least sense shut necessary. attitude rhetoric US ‚Äúwe cannot shut again.‚Äù One party downplayed virus since beginning - openly stated goal staying power. party said overblown, refused mandate masks quickest end lockdowns name stock market. 

But can‚Äôt call *we* problem?  regards human health, best ask even stupid questions make sure everyone clear informed. respect question, well, think this: covid‚Äê19 virus got could potentially protect seasonal flus common colds? answer nothing. There's significant cross‚Äêprotection observed since COVID‚Äê19 virus novel coronavirus rather different common viruses causing colds influenza. Back flu season, China even reported cases unfortunate individuals cought COVD‚Äê19 plus TWO different types influenza viruses. cases recall falling triple infection category died, goes show vulnerable infected multiple viruses make you. Fuck go work still. know much different $600/week would made me. good news. Salt Lake pretty blue county, I'm surprised leadership taking seriously. sure Summit county, Park City weird mix filthy rich poor they're gonna thing. counties Utah nationally highest per-capita growth rates they're asking move green risk levels, that's insane. Definitely can't trust leadership local levels make right choices, seems like gov making (some of) correct moves right now. test million people test that's 90% accurate(so lets say 10% chance false positive) 100k false positives. means 70% false positives need around 45k actual cases. 

I've obviously oversimplified ""false"" positives would people virus anyway. wanted explain 90% accurate test easily lead 70% false positives.  got fuck talent aside tossing salad Let's hope get better ending one. oh yeah, start counting theoretically preventable deaths declare martial law.

People die, gonna die, inevitable. houses hope bring Pillow guy say brief prayer discuss coffin lining materials padding eternal rest American people. Damn, wish state type unity, common sense. California good, accomplished 3 months shut down, gone 2 weeks. Everyone partying like it‚Äôs gone.  compiled deaths infections curves top 5 countries, expect, death curve follows infection curve - except USA. trajectory even close. 

Why USA different? infected Americans recovering greater numbers? mostly younger people getting infected?

Or difference data / reporting? working together...who would thought took care could take care other... someone really likes killing slaves. gunnuh make money way?? guess much real estate available next couple years... *smh*. 45% high trust. things Sweden failed. Sweden enough stock masks √•eotwctive equipment. now. try answer question ""What dream country live in?""... behalf everyone? There's always next year. postpone everything semester. gets voted proves world's saying. US full brim ignorant fools played fools agent orange. outsider seems like many americans stopped trying That‚Äôs hope.  Lock downs going much worse time around. waste March-may lock now. warning??? Cmon Texas pandemic taught good chunk people care anything immediate needs. Fuck others, fuck next week, fuck next year, fuck future, want now.

Note: words - forget stuck me. fair, west texas whole lot open space. better officials take action locally. state diverse terms population density state-wide mandate doesn‚Äôt make much sense. It's...not misinformation? someone walking talking coughing within six feet contagious absolutely pass virus.

And family contaminated, could pass people beach group. Dude country 120,000+ people dead covid

My country 100. 100,000. 100 ‚ÄúIf get corona, get corona.‚Äù Population wise it‚Äôs probably closer 10% Well, remind cult all. /s Agreed. Mostly that's smug masshole talking, sure want mass annex it. proud Houston right  Seriously feel lot infected protesters paid go cities infect people. think you‚Äôre underestimating people‚Äôs desire live lives lol CUMO 

i keep mispelling name basic competency test sounds appealing, consider small vocal minority anti-science religious people, would given fair say consider ""competent"" beliefs that's Pandora's Box wound want ever open. @pharmahill insurance bill later??  haircut mask crowd threw hissyfits DeWine's briefings caved. are. Long Island like this. Obviously still morons around, overwhelming majority people wear masks indoor public places, definitively get looks This, 100x. states care, thought could pray problem away. science right front ignored it. ass implants. he's sitting rocket. leave multiple personalities this! read comment Trump tweet. fucked üëç

Actually missed one lol. two them, opposites reversed. resident here. frankly don‚Äôt understand RI exists. wish CT would annex earthly idea point trying make. Nothing is. There‚Äôs risk everything though. could get quickly mailed letter, eyes walking cloud bodily fluids, getting package porch shortly it‚Äôs delivered, going doctor doctor. Unless farm one comes to, self-sustainable risk getting it. Parroting blame news sources isn‚Äôt much fun. read article? Also, read TMCs press release today? mom teaches elementary school, disaster. I'm hard enough time I'm grad school, can't imagine difficult must little kids. Sooo... work pay right...? Yea you‚Äôre ‚Äúweak‚Äù eyes. they‚Äôll like *shrug emoji* pass covid. 

They‚Äôll like ‚Äúwell didn‚Äôt many years left anyway‚Äù

But look bright side. least don‚Äôt dislike black brown lol Seems like one sided story.

I hope moves factory. Dont need california bullshit. Lol. cause that‚Äôs people live. 

But sure. ignore number humans quoting stats frequency things. Arizona getting hammered. Florida. fuck outta here, accurate. suggesting adoptive children inferior? Like might stuck one opposed child? Busted. read article made ass assuming brain damage cause obvious. defense article came cookies hate cookies.  Yeah, original intent rules outdated updated. (Also, hopefully test blood HIV everyone!) conservative Christian mother in-law got one husband passed Christian thing it...She spent it. Wow. thought bad see attitude students, can't imagine practicing provider acting like swimming rivers confirmation bias presupposing people criticize willing get sick.

Virus gonna virus. Masks stop ill people spreading disease. I'm suggesting people ill wear masks work prevent spreading disease (if work).

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* sounds like bullshit PA doctor observed cases PA considerably. Houston doctor wouldn‚Äôt say that, right? Don‚Äôt mean ‚Äúdie from‚Äù? easy enough see coming. many rural areas relatively cases months, people areas never wore masks, took social distancing seriously. lot sheriffs - almost always elected officials - ignored large gatherings, even encouraged them, popular voters. places governors made masks mandatory, many sheriffs publicly declared would refuse enforce mask wearing. 

People believed covid would skip rural area, spread rapidly urban centers. Even though people see rural area influenza outbreaks regular basis. correct compare flu. good point reminder. ""Ride Valkyries"" intensifies.... (I'm watching ""The Blues Brothers"",so stuck head! ) 1 word: conservatives. 

We ideology wholeheartedly denies science embraces emotion belief fact, nobody able correct them. trying say like word choice, thought could incite unnecessary panic. (toilet paper round 2?)  lot Pakistani Hong Konger's.

At least finding people land isolating them, hope none slipping net. 40,000 people protested shoulder-to-shoulder Zilker park.

Next week going wild. Still soon tell things going Ohio, anyone likely become victim success, it. Populous state, combination shrewd planning luck we‚Äôve managed avoid worst far. point much population longer takes seriously insignificant portion believes whole thing overblown‚Äîwhich sure sign something right. guess I‚Äôm still waiting shoe drop feel like might starting feel it. buys COBRA? always something like 10x pay insurance normally. absurd amount affordable someone lost job. person loves going libaries, never setting foot inside one ever again, pandemic over. damm risk great, water fountians, books, doorknobs, many damm vectors risk going. Always remember people basically can't quarantine. Lots people would lose job able pay rent did.

Which another screwed thing people talking fine going around spreading virus.  stop plane Moscow?  don‚Äôt know it‚Äôll look like 2 weeks (besides knowing won‚Äôt good), don‚Äôt think anyone even pretend idea December May bring. rate, might gone dinosaurs might back then!  way dropping, probably tomorrow likely people avoiding emergency room, afraid getting Coronavirus. CDC study found 42% drop March April, people much worried it. serious issue, avoid emergency room chest pains heart attack symptoms. Heart attack 100% dead treatment vs 1% dead Coronavirus.

**Doctors Worried Unprecedented Drop Emergency Room Visits COVID-19 Pandemic**

 Yeah, Houston exactly run smartest people :/ die COVID, mind dying Buc-ee's. best way give businesses fighting chance get virus control quickly possible. Gently suggesting maybe people consider wearing masks staying home isn‚Äôt best way that. under-rated comment. Jesus. even close. would estimate percentage people wear mask inside local grocery store? appears wandered circlejerk

The one riding ol' musky lol won't, July. late people shitty areas really see positive effects enforcing masks lockdown also forget pain four month's time.

As federal oversight, organisation assistance supplies, yes, could that, lacking, know could done, amateurish.

Giving cash help, like passing heroes act hazard pay essential workers never happen repubs terrified increase social safety net become impossible retract later on. Thanks! I‚Äôll look PPE kits Yes agree that. 

Gunshots... I'm talking chest wounds I'm talking all. mortality. mortality rate gunshots high. example foot...hand...arm...leg (with exception femural artery.)
Yes get hospitalized... I'm saying mortality. 

I'm hoping much higher. (Not getting symptoms). 

Wearing mask (my point) distancing (also point) fear mongering. rule society must adopt short (probably 6 months) period time till vaccine gets ready (hopefully). change. change...you get mess. See San Antonio going 124 hospitalizations per day last days 500. That's big uptick week.

Not sure arguing here. something fear. there's thing's kill mean one careful of. pour gasoline fire... also go sticking forks sockets.  Unfortunately control things. control dipshits whining want wear mask spread others. either move eradication (NZ) build sort immunity. CA sit around home extreme 3 months minute open going get spread. virus going go away sit home delaying what's going happen.


Which places like IN, WI, IA, pretty much entire NE open cases remain flat go down. CA opens little positivity hospitalizations start climb.

It mean go gang busters real life ""fuck it"" young people sitting home wrapped saran wrap nothing. Getting young, mobile population certain level exposure number one thing do. hard pill people swallow reason. Thanks White House, Texas swing state, Biden's leading. nice Canadian EH. ER pain side lasted several days decided better safe sorry. 90 minutes, CT scan blood draw said problems found. $18,000.

If blood panel CT done lab/imaging center would $400 ER copay. IIRC, first SARS virus outbreak went away quickly. Rapid deterioration rate causing low transmission shorter hospitalization times. kind funny he's predominately killing voting base. sort government bailout went supporting workers small businesses! 


Oh wait, gave money billionaires Newson needs muscle people here, Tulare County, wont thing. Without strong penalties one cares says since Sheriff Police wont even enforce anything. Thanks condolences, appreciate sentiment. hope hospitals enough, bad 'flu season' virus making rounds outside normal season bugs. also looks like going making rounds years come. Remote/Distance learning answer. student myself, learning online same. It‚Äôs boring, it‚Äôs lonely depressing able talk hangout friends. Online learning effective person learning.

Students need able class learning able talk hangout friends peers. It‚Äôs right children‚Äôs future keep home, away students, afraid friends they‚Äôve known years. don‚Äôt get back, long term effect country devastating

Using ratio tested 5.02% answer 1,228,732 untested individuals dead. bodies? 124,552 accounted for. tested actually make people likely die? math logic really killing us. Maybe would, could much worse. friend mine Denmark taunted publicly loudly strangers one bold chose wear one public. must say level stupidity hasn‚Äôt happened yet. see, people really try reasonable. going jump disparage Americans train seems popular lived I. 5 countries 4 continents, visited 75 countries, must say, isn‚Äôt worst. really like overall. implemented US? shaky start Belgium. improved people name average 4-5 people now, previously people contacted named 1 person contact with.

It's kinda useless people cooperate infringing privacy. simply virus keep people tourists, fact hospitals overwhelmed, yet people still driving 20 hours across country. Accidents happen, take hospital beds. can, stay home people. many people know ability produce enough food survive? lot might well closed you‚Äôve undone everything couple weeks. United States America*

* Except Pandemic please refer us individual state basis. Trump nothing Putin's Fuck-boy Knowing White House, I'm betting victory lap. Coronavirus defeated, stop talking it! Trump would kill half america helped get re-elected. get saying, but... 

There's real need conspiracies, trying find hidden enemy outside agencies. President Government openly cause unrest country. advertising crypto based fearmongering. Karma. goes around comes around. doomed. issue, masks turned political statement somehow.

Not 'somehow'. Republicans, purpose. dentist's office taking precautions. Patients wait cars called. staff masked. working mouth masks shields. Everyone's temperature taken. Still nervous. took first appointment Monday morning, office empty 3 days. Tallinger necessarily lying, way forms argument leaves find issue with. also important tell exceptions mistakes apart ""general policy"".

Anyway:

In Sweden often can't provide oxygen care homes. someone needs oxygen need moved hospital. active debate unreasonable. one side saying extra competence available hospital necessary saying unreasonable move patients. complicated discussion around morphine vs oxygen science may say one thing relative hard accept. complicated account dementia patients.

Sweden also pushed hard really need help living care homes. often already near end life begin with. elderly instead receive help home.

This important context listening Tallinger.

As Intensive Care situation, find article linked explains quite well, read it? Maybe that‚Äôs don‚Äôt listen cage fight announcer comes viral respiratory illnesses SF peeps tend lucky position high paying jobs done remotely bunker down. Idk implications terms general income NorCal vs SoCal people‚Äôs ability/willingness stay home, lot people know SoCal conservative least right leaning straight think it‚Äôs big deal. uncle (in San Diego) throwing birthday party inviting whole family. family SoCal going (one bringing even month old baby) it‚Äôs crazy. Global dimming baby That's pretty much companies US days, fair. watch one Chipotle. great idea villain! He‚Äôs orange weaknesses ramps glasses water. superpower able lie still 35% population think he‚Äôs good guy story. going continue ignoring deaths still decreasing right? This, fucked entire country nothing Moved Austin 6 years although got ools things neat opportunities, wait get out. overpopulated can't stand Texas bravado. state people constantly remind best state. own, guess. guy SF got GF lives someone protested beside woman coughed next another man bleeding must had....

Sounds quite scientific Fucking WHAT?!

I knew bad there, 1:4?! That‚Äôs impossible. literally cannot managed. It‚Äôs fucking impossible. _July 11th_ even better...  There's still large number morons believe US best country earth. Land willfully ignorant here. Dont worry guys, lower amount tests number fall long hit 3K deaths day? previous peak 2.5K like magic number can't surpassed. Sorry but... fucking serious? Italy we've worrying pandemic since march ICUs getting overloaded, everyone thinking ""god hope need hospitalized anytime soon might SOL, covid not"" 
I'm trouble parsing could take June 2020 someone realization middle worldwide pandemic It‚Äôs Orange County buddy.

It‚Äôs fun. hell talks person sitting next long flight? people try always worst nightmare. Fortunately, usually manage keep hi, excuse me, thanks bye. much room wiggling 3 bed. Americans, rest human race actually believes reality. go look odds there, able bet on.

Here's article odds back mention even **know** herd immunity possible, considering preliminary studies people back February-March seeing drop [antibody (Disclaimer: one study I'm unsure much merit deserves.) common thing catch viruses once, fact herd immunity may save population concerning heck. It‚Äôs also manipulated completely misunderstand facemasks mandatory.

You wear mask wont spread sick. others wear less likely infect you. slows around 65%. Thats enough lower R value one.

Most europe manages get R 1 strict mask policy. I've already given up. think still better 50/50 shot. one thinks spike mass gatherings BLM protests around country? get cause large crowds = coronavirus There's little bit difference importance protestors:

A) white privilege challenged people need go fight right cause... 'merica

B) people protesting hundreds years (thousands really) white supremacy watching system continually murder families cold blood streets, bedrooms, cars trying show papers gun legally possess carry

That couldnt possibly affect COVID right? Yeah I've camping inside too. kind wonder I'm going overboard protecting myself. Maybe could go park something far away others. need leaders like her. Yeah, probably gonna get lot friction this.

Maybe offer option something new, ""virtual family reunion"". Plan bunch virtual group activities pods family members together scheduled times:

- ""Game night""
- ""Potluck/Family Dinner""
- ""Show tell"" (kids adults), people show hobbies, interests, neat things accomplished. ""Did know uncle Mike builds furniture hobby?"", ""Cousin Susie count 10 English, Spanish, French!""
- ""Grown folks talk"", young adults singles talk dating whatnot.
- ""Family history stories"", ""Did know auntie Jean state champion golfer?"" 

All done virtually. billion-dollar companies run way, family reunion can.

You still mail everyone tshirts (if that's thing). Younger people adopt easily ""grew up"" communicating way friends. Wait, thought bad flu? in. Business allowed business making money. conversation friend today guessed thing given current trend plus upcoming Fourth July weekend. End July could pretty bleak.

I dunno, something risk due above.. selling expect go lose ton value, making mistake. continue.. Protests packed young adults way less likely experience severe symptoms result less likely get tested. major factor surprising happen 4 weeks protests started. idea Again, usual, make little sense. Great work.  well, USA Leadership. Tarrant County (Fort Worth area) issued mask mandate today Colleyville (rich town county) said enforcement whatsoever. good friend can't even get back normal flights Argentina shut down.

California huge response covid. 

Without federal backing though unenforcable full hole.

While current measures going stop spread, even 40% population follows it, infections go down.

Its stopping it, time passed. chipping away spread keep contained. 

But say nothing gross misrepresentation happened. Yeah, millions fat retards jowl jowl IHOP PPE nothing with...it‚Äôs protesters. Great reasoning, entitled schmuck Unless die corona meantime :C Yeah, last year SALT deduction capped can't itemize much income actually pay taxes.  course since I'm California, care.

Sure highly urbanized might turn people, Dutch blunt attitude takes time get used to, expensive-ish, time noticed functioning social foundations infrastructure truly allow freedoms individual pursue fulfilling life, least relatively comfortable one. Sure perfect lots improved stark contrast neighbouring English decaying support systems alongside failed experiment USA, also extended periods. ain't big mood know strengthens feeling Trump purpose. He's psychopath. strange hart palpitations, went hospital waited 20 minutes, got doctor sprayed nitrous tongue test things. Turns temporary, things settled down.

Of course, governor pulled plug state University epidemiology studies. there‚Äôs that. like darwin fucking idiots without masks partying going church dying couple weeks later Bruh. edit end think said immunity meant fatality rate. frustrating I'm sure good intentions, kind thinking terribly insidious. hardy root systemic oppression. 

What legislatures reducing person statistics apply them. use misleading statistics shield discriminatory legislature behind appearance science. 

Consider following:
-Across states regions, HIV diagnoses evenly distributed. 2017, South made 52% (19,968) new HIV diagnoses U.S.

And yet make legislature prevents people domiciles south donating blood. 

-In 2018 Blacks/African Americans accounted 42% (16,067) HIV diagnoses 13% population.

And yet make legislature prevent Blacks/African Americans donating blood. 

We because, stats accurate, show whole picture HIV. misrepresents state national infection face targeted outsider. know enacting policies would reduce amount blood donated, evidence address problem percent HIV contaminated blood donated. Also, super racist. kind justification done time insurance, healthcare, credit monitoring, crime enforcement, zoning laws, schooling education, finance lending, list goes on. need start calling roots. 


If point clear enough, let leave this. -know- test donated blood thing law supposed suppress, don't. cannot, likely someone along line decided value lives would saved increase donated blood worth less perceived cost would take run tests first place. are. aiming ‚Äòherd immunity‚Äô. saw ICU doctor comment yesterday he's patients denying even dying front him. Go figure. Imagine many Texans would still alive tree killed single word BLM protests rioting comment. wont taken seriously. whole thing forced partisan issue get partisan results It‚Äôs testing many people. Reduce test, increase success! citizen journalist agenda. That's good combo. diddnt mean say union endorses views. don‚Äôt speak speak me. I‚Äôm clearly right spokesperson thank articulating could not. Tactics governor get rid voters. everyone agree weight issue? real sickness! It‚Äôs lot people relatively low considering many people went. Dang. shouldn‚Äôt gathered thousands protested :( Genuine question, new cases comes protest couple weeks ago? come areas? Except kind janky statistics. Currently expected roughly 80% people covid show little signs. 

Soo real number 12,500,000.

Herd immunity doesnt happen 60% idea limiting available hosts viruses infect, statistical model would 60. real world masks handwashing mandated less.. like 40% maybe even 30%. 

But still 3%

I think everyone needs recognize going upward trajectory vaccine made. Deaths lagging indicator. precursor rise deaths would hospitals filling COVID-19 patients, what's happening Arizona right now. totally believe media also told us protesting important social distancing. also totally believe data several states decided ask anyone attended protest, including largest states. it‚Äôs white people‚Äôs fault? admit you‚Äôre racist lol 1st *reported* case. Haha rona go brrrr message brought ""NO FUCKING SHIT SHERLOCK!"" Organization. 
 
Seriously though, least redditors part understanding this. fucking neighbors don't. Wait saying countries open schools right now? 1. become daily trend either place common sense precautions policies place, reduce testing. Sadly, think know way we‚Äôre leaning. 
2. confirmed cases spiking now, fatalities begin spiking next 2-4 weeks. It‚Äôs get uglier. protesting conservatives. protests casue new cases covid

False premise? research concluded this? Kaboomtown

Grimly apt sticking around, expect emigrate (flee) I'm 100% this, European strain (which one hit NY spreading now) mutated form lot contagious? belittle efforts, seems like Asian countries early US hits West Coast original virus. might explain spread bit slower despite massive amount people moving Lunar New Year. Due lock downs fewer people traveling, since US massive takes long time travel road state state, helps minimizing state state spread, since far know, airlines let near plane show form symptoms. New record! We‚Äôre killing it! Literally! Wait weekend Idk that. people lost jobs, fighting pandemic, money, take healthcare get sick screwed? happens could end country. mean NY's response corona also big fucking joke sure people speaking doctors.

The politicians already shown they're incompetent, useless actively damaging. Hyperbole form panic, helpful. politics dumbed word pandemic epidemic, everything epidemic days look vaping. many people vaping killed last 3 months? covid?  people may ignorant misinformed, they're going ignore instincts based millions years evolution.

When mentioned silk chamois liner, thinking glad study used recommended stretch chiffon. People take mask absolute second step outside store...while others aren‚Äôt putting there‚Äôs second walk in.

This entirely unreasonable. fairly sure virus nearly always spread indoors. they're wearing mask indoors, I'd give pass, even though suboptimal.

* Deaths peaked 7 14 days positive cases peaked
* positive cases peak, take another 20 days cut half.
* 20 days: 1/4. 20 days: 1/8. 20 days: 1/16.

End story, unjustified discrimination here, stop offended someone formulated headline offend catch attention aggrevate you. Also, says they‚Äôre exempt wearing masks public, businesses private. That's cool. boss said making us wear masks first step way take guns defunding police going lead Sharia law.

The first one could around try hear out. last one literally walk room. missed joke.... Besides, Donny said 100%serious We'd could start wearing masks president encourage wearing masks really wish financial structural safety net situations. mean is: country, allegedly soaring economy one strongest powers world, can't seem provide actual relief parents elementary school aged kids form financial support offset cost in-person, personal attention care, support people would engage care (teachers, someone watch kids day, etc.)

But people would assist would need routinely tested, means we'd robust testing infrastructure, would likely make whole situation moot point, suppose.  Right now? know Easter example, travel 95% Bill burr They're also arguably privacy-aware large tech companies, fits. saying he‚Äôs right, vitiman free go outside stand sun doesn‚Äôt cost $250,000 1. Look USA.

2. exact opposite they're doing.

3. Profit. Oh well sounds right. antibodies testing (testing many people developed antibodies) suggest Sao Paulo alone number cases may 10 times higher, meaning around 1 million cases Sao Paulo alone. difficult get tested, even deaths tested properly, lot people simply signed death due acute respiratory illness, thus showing statistics. real mess here. time everything opening looking couple rough months ahead. children can't support. Real fuckin simple. continue unable support them, give family member can, surrender state? ""self-sufficient"" enough child, self-sufficient. Nobody gives shit bad parenting, problem. Daily, average Fridays seem higher rest week mid 50s.

My reading lot places US report weekends play catch-up week. wearing mask also protects rats getting COVID-19 still get infected spitting like prototyped sprinkler.  voters

Are they?

I'm even US, I'm seeing, every steps, people deny existence disease, measures helping, see best ally.

It's bad mix: people high quality education, are, time, confident abilities knowledge. Normally gets annoying person, right fueling support incompetent administration, negating attempt control disaster. Actually, Sweden full lockdown, that's true. recommendations stating meet friends family, stay away certain places. lot businesses closed close encounters impossible. difference Sweden follow guidelines. lockdown necessary, put individual instead forcing lockdown. democratic way.
For example, I've met 1 friend past 3 months, two weeks ago. Basically worked home since beginning march. compared people lockdown, counting lockdown started today. many people met? done anything except home family? I‚Äôve thinking weeks now. hell gonna college football year?

Here PA, I‚Äôve seen PCP times, always says ‚Äúyou take off‚Äù nonchalantly. time surgical mask using Buff neck thingie instead way hot. NC doc also tells patients nonchalantly take masks room.

I feel bad anyone compromised immune systems think doctors actually everything keep safe.. huh? see America taking opportunity finish started 1700s. funny people using undercounting cases justification death rate lower reported, yet fail realise also true number deaths. understand government would pay salary going pay wages 47 million lost jobs since started. just.

Well.

OK then.

If *you* society big trouble, maybe hell survival you. jumping short term immunity eradication? realize we've eradicated single disease human history, right? Perhaps need put together gofundme help idiots move island desolate place effectively end lives without hurting rest us.  totally agree. Infections matter much sporadic testing numbers, deaths lag much need use hospitalizations earliest indications (damn testing)... Based this, NYC, date, 218k cases. Population 8.4M people. So...2.6%. based New York County alone stop voting New Yorker president. 

Many New Yorkers think Trump‚Äôs wall built wrong side Texas. Lol international aid important. helping countries ends fucking yourself. one damn planet here. Fuck infuriating.  Nope - never one never will. odd someone 40, feel like I've missed anything. triage care? No.

The fatality rate 0.26% per CDC's latest numbers, hit nearly 40 million unemployed, countless small businesses forced close good, making half income entire industry destroyed, trying figure fuck keep bills paid. Everything said came true.

I'm pissed ever. High key, lots charges make money hospitals lose uninsured underinsured patients can‚Äôt afford pay anything. con universal health care.  Businesses aren‚Äôt going better voluntary shut driven citizens would mandatory government shutdown. Wow, funny . Taiwan lie assumed already at-risk group virus new know effects fetuses newborns might be. company sent pregnant employees WFH March State even locked assumed risk. dont get ahead game yet...we havent exactly opened like florida etc yet......

if mimicking NY opening strategy, gotta see plays first....

Imo sneaky tactics vs open tactics living virus doesnt seem like make much difference....if everyone wears mask? maybe, well see soon enough... rising CO2 levels damage brain? teach New Rochelle Covid hit hard early. lost lot community members. toll loss socialization education, grief factor well. kids experiencing lot stress truama. worry, change soon enough.

Uh-huhhhh. Sure will. virus-crazy people saying nonstop since started months ago. ‚ÄúJust wait, wait‚Äù. Nothing happened, nothing going happen. It‚Äôs crazy situation. little one supposed start kindergarten year. 

What‚Äôre choices? 
1) send public school risks?
2) send private school risks?
3) hire teacher?

What can‚Äôt do:
1) distance learning (no way pay attention)
2) home school (both work)

If schools close I‚Äôll probably try hire teacher nanny. 

This going impact kids long long time. look effects Katrina kids New Orleans. going felt years. presses running way makes sense hold something dollars. That's likely market up, anticipated inflation. Look, know mortality rate low. told second wave would come October. can‚Äôt live life fear vaccine might never come might effective want. 

What matters death rate hospitals, much positive cases. Protect risk Please take racebaiting single-issue account somewhere else!

Considering lockdowns 0% chance happening currently expect see 150,000 day point. 

How many times learn math isnt political? could fucking worn masks opened slower least given people chance earn money reducing risk spread, guess that‚Äôs much people.

Really feel sane types trapped mess. Could be. Though increasing risk simply mask not. mask perfect They‚Äôre actually trying tie possible cases coronavirus protesters, including one-year-old. I‚Äôm boat. left ear left side throat weird acting up. It‚Äôs much sore irritant, like beginnings sore throat. left ear hurts like stick finger inside. feeling bit fatigued that‚Äôs prob returned back work week. I‚Äôve taking precautions everything. I‚Äôm sort concerned. I'm one demand higher power force somebody else something want like behavior?

No. I'm one asking left alone. convince mask deniers?

Seriously feel like Brad Pitt needs fly military helicopter figure solved puzzle run time. u Google second wave cases china 

A one year old got dad going Beijing market Left American center actual center? Use brain though. Like sub thought New York overrun, needed hospital ships field hospitals never used ICU's filled despite understanding hospitals function? Mine postponed April. called May 19 said June 3rd open. booked shit fast. surgeon‚Äôs 7th last surgery day (I hungry thirsty 3pm wanted fight someone). lucked man P.

However: realizes surviving Impeachment showed untouchable chance stay power delay Election, indefinitely, maybe permanently. Antibody tests late May showed 7.3% Stockholm immunity. Compared 20% New York City, America‚Äôs largest city. Sweden completely failed get anywhere near herd immunity. Yet Sweden‚Äôs mortality rate per capita much higher US, it‚Äôs economy still tanking.

BC maintained 1 nurse patient ratio thus lower death rate always solutions, wait times minor injuries increase (you get feel like Canadian go hospital something minor hope 6+ hours) smaller appointments surgeries get shuffled. hospital capacity everyone critical massive support it.

You sitting echo chamber people think going doom gloom, want uplifting news go read comments New York thick people said hospitals would fill, field hospitals needed etc., reality hospitals able handle it.

You remember subreddit wants disease bad possible, despite every day us understanding less harmful thought. get caught negative. No. bunch hospitals/medical centers.

However, sad people luxury staying home. Several family members Florida work Disney one already gotten call return. beyond infuriated governor continuing allow parks reopen. incredibly irresponsible choice given people FL return jobs (and risk exposure COVID possible death) refuse lose unemployment assistance. unfair forced choice stupid billion dollar company wants encourage stupid tourists come buy fucking Mickey Mouse doll park. Orlando lot options work anyway, come this. I'd say same, difference Germany nationwide shutdown local lockdowns, Sweden didn't. 

Yes, Germany heavy export. lot firms closed even nation-wide shutdown, get orders. Comparing April 2019 2020, see germanys export dropped almost 1/3. 

Germanys economy dropped less less deaths per 100k people. never history many science denying anti-vax conspiracy theorists who'd never voluntarily get vaccinated, therefore preventing effective herd immunity.

Kids missing year 2 antiquated indoctrination center create proper obedient american employees hinder ability take test next year therefore sink funding school gets.

Mental health might actually improve! external event come put high school drama perspective might make realize day age high school dont matter, all, none matters. test scores want career depends college degree even then...

There reason send kids back school them. send back cant watch them, sad understand cirumstances. use full title?

""100 percent regular ICU beds Texas Medical Center occupied, hospitals space surge""  Seems like there's something fundamentally wrong U.S set up? Hmm.... Medicare mean take residents asian countries generalization humans. waiving requirements med school? one articles needs ""we told so"", we, people half brain, said bad idea. one listens. Weren‚Äôt done Covid around Easter? Bird haha, I'm American  üèÖ could see outdoor classes thing long possible weather permitting. gives opportunity keep distances paired benefits fresh air circulation. Throw masks hand sanitizer small back yard classroom something I‚Äôd willing run/look into. much Free Dumb fine‚Äîeven it‚Äôs youngsters now, happens go visit grandma? someone else? beginning? know idiots exist everywhere world, damn, USA.. someone worked management years one largest companies world... People sometimes get fired thing tell we're firing for. 

Example: employee uses intermittent FMLA migraines. FMLA usage interferes productivity profit. build case terminate person unrelated performance, behavior ""issues"".

It's illegal fire FMLA. So, we'll fire different reason... mercy, forgiveness, second chances given person make single mistake.

It's right, way business works, especially large companies. think company this, promise you, dead wrong. That's never feel guilty something take advantage company, someone else takes advantage company.

Companies exist one sole purpose... make money. care you, use you. 7billion people world... almost job. People tend avoid inconveniences, sure. severely reduces transmission rate deadly virus killed 55 80 elderly folks nursing home road week's time, consider face masks much inconvenience, civic duty fellow humans. 

Maybe staff wearing face masks since beginning outbreak instead requiring mandated state, wouldnt many lost lives. demographics timelines don‚Äôt match protests. You‚Äôre telling Florida Texas Az we‚Äôre hardest? Fuck no. Yet dense city contains third entire population. Hmm... Parties indoors, masks usually, closer extended periods contact, lots surfaces touch, etc. opposite protests us first half, gonna lie.  anything honesty. simple case missing deaths cases due sheer size virus fragile healthcare. Like maharashtra recently added 1.5k deaths tally initially missed backtracked data. true numbers India matter country obtained long crisis haven‚Äôt heard even 1 thing COVID related anti- semitism? Even less unleashed worldwide wave.... wear mask they're out. expect everyone would anything, expect become political issue. Absolutely ridiculous, although anticipated reports 1yr old dying Leukaemia ways many babies die year. 

Yes it‚Äôs sad, it‚Äôs reason mass panic. They‚Äôve picked one story. % youngsters getting let alone dying insignificantly small worried about. It‚Äôs even shown even serious vector threat. youve stopped counting likely already know answer. Love energy. Vocab like irascible though absolute 10 dollar words really jive common folk fyi. Good word tho. ""Possesses"", ""poses""

You tell people take pandemic seriously fucking idiots. Even shit make reflection idocyt Thank you! Forcing workers expose work pandemic, without protection compensation, absolutely form *violence* capital owning class. real, measurable consequences violence, anger 100% fucking justified. Don‚Äôt let *anyone* tell isn‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt apologize it. UK governments plan start. following protests petitions, soon realised work initated lockdown. 2 weeks late though, hence death count 50k. 


Unfortunately lockdown complete waste time, starting open up, people flocking droves beaches tourist areas, craming together littering crap everything. Hello Wave 2, good see you! Lol BLM protesting. Haha jesus fn christ. helped everything it. cases connected protests too... 5 year old going kindergarten year.

I agree inflammatory syndrome worrying schools open back fall don‚Äôt know we‚Äôre going family.

I‚Äôve got honest, knew would face challenges raising kids, never life thought I‚Äôd living time I‚Äôm actually worried world brought kids into. strange sad times right now. utter bullshit people think okay put life lives come contact danger want put damned piece cloth face. I'm sorry shitty situation 10-14 days complete lockdown right now. Since Karens gonna keep going get haircuts won‚Äôt see end devastation. Unreal ....to announce wrapping taskforce lol.

I mean really point group anymore, considering anything advise basically forgotten 2 minutes?

this go vaccine appears distributed worldwide. dude.. risk safety protest fact staying safe... like eat Broccoli drink Coke go yell Government healthy start drinking Coke puke Broccoli Well people look forward high risk next pandemic due lung kidney damage covid gives them. surviving everything. How's testing US? We've seen cases countries spike due increased testing, actually going down. US testing cases truly going crazy? Thanks. make feel bit better. We‚Äôre healthy things could much worse. Gravity liberal hoax make president look bad German here, virus app. Indeed That's poster's point.

The Trump rallies bad idea.

The BLM protests bad idea.

Both sides ignoring science politically expedient. result, literally killing yourselves.

Long ago pretty sure return America, I'm certain. many elderly people go ski trips.  don‚Äôt know schools depends lot they‚Äôre doing. daughters expected primarily independent work academic apps barely face time teachers. run special education program providing 3+ hours live instruction daily. ideal? No. Better school? No. schools lot better been. 
My state declared kids going back full time fall things don‚Äôt get worse. feel like they‚Äôre using kids guinea pigs lifting social distancing altogether. I'm willing bet everything people still disregard precautions put place protect us interferes ability party liking. Infection isn‚Äôt random event

Mathematician here. explain mean this? models infections probability function point. 

Do mean ""There large number causal factors, impossible compute individually, affect whether get infected""?

That's mean ""random"" real population. think George R. R. Martin gets ideas from? Classic Elon fish it! unaffected massive protests rioting happening weeks though üôÑ. one rally 6k broken records! üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ ready next ski season.
No vaccine necessary now, Arizona facing per capita cases recorded country Europe even hard-hit Brazil.

This allowed happen state government full knowledge consequences. 

Good luck Arizona. hope state ordering bunch refrigerated semi trailers handle dead bodies piling soon. personal explanation previous spikes protests? Herd immunity may improbable virus keeps mutating (which certain), sure hell impossible people vaccinate. high enough vaccination rates, we'd least chance finding possible. Pro-plaguers deprive us chance entirely. Trump recommends it. really need start writing book absolute travesty another Arizona. Small attendance, zero masks NEED wear masks distance everyone die!!!!!! Unless protesting good cause course, Covid deactivated then. said good? Walked store get dog food counted less 10 ppl mask got aisle. scared count way checkout. inside less 5 mins total. Although bad social distancing, can‚Äôt compare 1/3 full Trump rallies BLM protests streets full people.  crazy number like like wow .06% that's low! math like eeehhhh fuck hope low. 

If every American gets Covid .06% death rate 2,250,000 people dying... 

If HALF Americans get that's still 1.2 million. 

Scary stuff. hope low... :/ Right, people got cut 500 billion? purposefully leaving California basically progress made eliminated. God fucking dammit! swear selfish country world Yeah it‚Äôs certain states tendency make scientifically informed policy choices, people states likely think science facts don‚Äôt apply pack bars Kahn believes huge healthcare expenditure burden individuals survived COVID-19. 

Now makes sense Trump willing take whole ACA. opens door idea COVID isn‚Äôt novel somehow mutated get worse.

Would help explain Dutch found people‚Äôs T-Cells already know kill Covid Sweden still higher death per capita rate US though PA plateauing Rt 1 again. Feel better soon ! Upstate New York. New York City referring said New York hospitals became crowded, ability transfer people ‚Äúupstate‚Äù New York, hospitals saves many lives

Reopening schools going exactly opposite effect. Los Angeles *county* currently leading number cases nation-wide, behind entire state Florida. sounds like good bit advice ""our leader"" Florida 5000 yesterday 5500 day before. don‚Äôt break 6000 *or* 20% positivity today would surprised. Smoking actually thought reduce risk hospitalized virus. something crazy like 4 times less likely? suspect nicotine may prevent cytokine response. brought back protesters Places like NYC biggest protests yet surge. outside masks isn‚Äôt problem. tiny hands. stands memory reason.  would also argue reddit is/can much echo chamber Makes perfect sense. Person virus. Person counted virus. Donald Trump would love method counting. It‚Äôs blaming China Europe, early policies ignoring virus spreading Europe probably main reason US got control. cases going close bars, restaurants ant public places affected states? people beaches, parks etc.? mot impose strict lock LA, New York, Miami? totally forgot situation Iran. happened that? Best comment day. .... wait what? covid may actually novel? didn‚Äôt notice then, mean Covid existed mutated.

So Dutch study found people somehow immune, maybe guess weaker form covif nice way trying say ""thanks everyone protested, bc you"" bc want canceled shitting protests. can't guidelines say protests hurt us. can't. protests broke every guidelines set scientists. one distanced,a lot people wear masks, lot lung capacity used. goes everything we've told do. 

Sorry, buying one. believe regulations bc working. everyone defied regulations started protesting, see repercussions. 

Please let know there's holes logic Read fall Rome. think travel restrictions. uneducated opinion think political simply want leadership takes deadly pandemic seriously. agree, lack urgency concern infuriating. Business usual Sweden, quite now. think FHM done sloppy job handling virus, saying ignored straight-out false. yea, 50% airlines cut flights, imposed travel restrictions. airlines moved faster Trump did. I'm terrified fact bring people staying home get response ""but draw line infringing rights?""

Holy shit, selfish assholes. Infringing rights? ""right"" go get fucking ice cream videos games Walmart trumps right 100,000 peoples lives?

We can't stay fuck inside couple weeks try save country? ... infringes rights?!?!

Our country filled biggest fucking pansy ass people world.

We literally multiple wars drafted children, got fuck couch went war died. 

Current population?

""A MASK?? INFRINGING RIGHT YO BREATH!!!""

China come take country, can't defend ourselves. may billion guns, 90% people exhausted picking up. sound like anyone told slow testing down. course people care now. Dont forget, Trump closed flights China really early ... really really early.

Also today find covid wastewater samples taken March 2019? girl job tested positive asked could come back :) day got call :) dk job positive :) remember yesterday grabbed shoulder ask question :) guess I'm visiting grandma weekend :) 3/4 participants suffered stroke? Median 71 relatively small sample (n = 125) that's still insanely clinical datasets available 125 (82%) 153 patients. 77 (62%)  125 patients presented  cerebrovascular event,  57 (74%)  ischaemic stroke, nine (12%)  intracerebral haemorrhage,  one (1%) CNS vasculitis. [(pdf careful ask might find get it. Good luck people. People said time, implying NYC place going see tragedy like NYC ‚Äúunique‚Äù (crowded, mass transit, etc). sure rectified fact happened Lombardy also typical city.... guess it‚Äôs far away it‚Äôs easier ignore. insanity! Without lockdown, least widespread use masks, number infections continue exponentially increase. Texas mayors governors waiting for? Wow that's interesting Shame really states acted quickly flatten curve get control like NY, Michigan, Hawaii, Alaska rest country drag us down.  Lol
I‚Äôve definitely experienced exact situation multiple times sales bros knew many cases hidden though According epidemiologists, second wave. like ‚Äúone continuous wildfire never completely put out.‚Äù also blame specific party reasons above! thing happened SA, except everyone looking China Europe meanwhile swarmed America. Surprise. Ignoring warnings cost others.   find comment incredibly ironic, know linked CDC‚Äôs page risk revisions. Even lockdowns ‚Äúeffective‚Äù virus still threat go back normal. fact whole village caught CoVID19 would prove wrong. Well, time landlords stop getting ass-fucked - either additional unemployment eviction freeze evictions eviction freeze. guess congregations going meet maker lot faster others. one word protests . much anger , directed completely wrong direction . Yes, I'm aware that. opened gym. Masks must worn come work masks pose HEALTH RISK MEMBERS! think so.
I need believe. Yeah look map. Places consistently declining cases places wearing masks. complicated - know simple behaviors make difference, fucking child ignore them. might honestly insult children. unemployment bucks dude Colleges opening justify charging obscene amounts do. go online reduce tuition significantly risk getting sued. Reducing tuition means laying faculty defunding lot key programs. significant portion college system going fall apart. It‚Äôs secret modern academia first foremost business greedy corporations. school goes bankrupt next year remember fucking selves. 11% go confirmed cases. CDC estimates we‚Äôve high 10x amount confirmed cases, 23M instead 2.3M. South Korea‚Äôs estimates put mortality rate around 2-2.2%. it‚Äôs wide margin 0.5-2.2% roughly. won‚Äôt know true cost years years. Ya, already fired last one, Rebekah Jones, ago. I'm familiar Florida system. true, something similar impeachment? Really romneys gave platform anti-science people let keep platform long time (because guess hurting anybody?) numbers grew face consequences people adamant media wrong, scientists wrong, personal decision medical research, leads people says well saw internet, must true. capacity analyze 100 000 nationwide tests/week long ago, number tests done anywhere near amount. pretty big news Sweden.

The problem mainly conflict regions (Sweden split 21 regions locally elected politicians responsibility local hospitals healthcare) government. regions want pay broader testing, claiming govermment's responsibility. government turn want pay either, claiming regions' responsibility.

Recently (early-mid june) issue resolved government deciding pay testing. still logistical issues, testing ramped since, 61k tests/week everyone symptoms able get tested free many making incredibly sad Switzerland covering 80% salaries **all employees** would furloughed/fired, kept social workers state workers.

The Swiss government said could keep March November national fund ran dry they'd start borrowing.

They money monetary policy one promotes resilience efficiency, even former costs bit latter.

They could run rabbit hole eternally trying squeeze efficiency system, thus making brittle economic shocks. virus comes wherever surveilling. surveil everywhere. invented lot really cool things unemployment aiding lot Americans. bet least 75%of hopping around subreddits saying protests important. fine all, yall shocked pikachu shit outcome  reason one grasped first time (as still first wave) people stressing flatten curve. Full ICU capacity mean Covid patients going get care, everyone going get care need. whole point slow thing manage it, really going way completely eliminate short term. Yeah triage would last resort. wonder example could retrofit large passenger plane oxygen equipment fly people way. probably hasn‚Äôt done specific thing, although planes like Dornier 328 retrofitted transport people winter sports fractures. Creativity needed situations like these. let‚Äôs take personal responsibility. Let‚Äôs go large groups masks social distancing. US going dealing long fucking time. lack real federal guidance leaving states disaster. Unless page, never going get real handle this. 40 states right thing? Well, 8 states gonna fuck rest us. 

Handling state, even county level, joke. Imagine copy-pasting post word word like making point. Keep shilling China bud. Yes Lockdown get people ""serious mode"" allow phased reopening required masks. 

I mean, want another lockdown, wear mask people! Well really would throw timeline back .... perhaps contamination testing?

March 2019 would really back anybody imagined. Americans returning Lombardy Italy walking JFK security taxis without ever asked whereabouts, symptoms exposure. Barcelona China ... Rural east-tn shit show... i'd say 50/50. universities made tuition cheaper charging course credits others charging online distancing fee. want open up, social distancing mandatory, including masks, starting president. Chinamerica dominating world's economy decades.

What's even scarier, two headed divorce............ broke heart. sad fine example biased reporting aimed 80-IQ group. language slanted, could use waterslide. everyone avoiding mentioning possible correlation protrsts? read Boston Market think anything changed.

Once CT takes party move Big Y. Nothing compare [Black Obviously current social ""norms"" proven lately horrible human kind general. Changing way society modern people indoctrinated mindlessly taught think act treat may humanity actually needs survive long run. So... virus 300 million potential new victims US.  
It's getting started! 100%. work pet industry regularly see pet x rays 50/60 bucks human ones 500. every passing day, fear stupid virus going kill us all. swear fuck shit one sickest jokes played out. could nation stupid? 


did see video folks florida protesting mask order 'masks kill people' 'following devil's laws?""  40% saw videos trump rallies thought ""he's trustworthy."" expect massive gatherings protest? Me? live Sweden want borders closed. care neighbors dealt pandemic good way.
I think Anders Tegnell moron Swedens herd immunity strategy utter failure. 
But still feel sorry Swedes auffering. Yeah literally takes one person catch it. Worry, Happy! shelves cleaned hand soap, anything bleach hand sanitizer, paper goods, spray disinfectants, vitamins, otc medicines, meat, soups, pasta, cereal, bottled water, baking supplies, decent prepackaged food decent shelf life could frozen difficult find expensive.

As soon store put shelf carted. Many times even shelve it. also limits set 1 2.

This went 2+ months still back normal. told safe go casinos know citizens arrest is, want wear devil's hat? I'll arrest metaphor living Ina world sex HIV really falls flat, sex HIV without sex without HIV straw man. 
HIV, like epidemics, dealt lots TESTING SAFETY PRECAUTIONS. HIV actually changed alot world sex big reason condoms popular are. 
Other precautions include screening blood donors, needle exchanges, etc etc. 


Learning HIV gives us idea actions help fight COVID19: rampant testing, masks, identifying risky behaviors. 

But things put place epidemic control. America large wasted ton time here. seem think closing international borders going solve anything? outbreaks inflicted us foreign travel. outbreaks direct result leaders ignoring science convenience bunch Karens families. Want something productive? close borders close states. keep fucking closed time instead giving way yeehawdists ""need"" haircut. lengths people go entitlement... $1000/person per week? Per month? trying get gague whether would enough live supplementary/how supplementary would be. 600 week compare 500 billion? point here? we're good cuz got whopping 600 week? 


We even fucking position King US cared weeks. 


Blame states üòÇ something something united name. Yes infections trending toward younger patients better survival odds but...

As get experienced handling patients also get marginally better treating disease.

Regrettably came expense thousands lives never substitute lower rate infection.

We know sure though compare mortality rates overall pre post covid. another disturbing thought many covid related deaths recorded such. Lemme ask good friend Anne Frank... Yea I‚Äôve heard people gunna get rid baker Walsh fast cuz virus already widespread stay home advisory overblown reaction ruined people‚Äôs livelihoods. surprising amount trumpets (not typo) around MA. happen think amazing group able curb spread here, surge lasted almost two whole months 1500-2000 cases per day around 200 deaths per day. virus still spreading even stay home advisory. takes get past surge! like, wow, science cool, state almost gotten rid virus! implement quarantines spiking states NY NJ CONN now??? wrong many fundamental levels I'm even sure begin. media make incorrect, made incorrect. ... Lehigh county come too? One difference 9/11 Covid charge, may liked Bush, least could tell cared tragedy. Trump hand doesn‚Äôt even pretend care, thus setting example followers shouldn‚Äôt care either. Groundhog Day hell  Europe huge infection vector. basically started clusters world.

The entirety EU basically ignored played virus regional event even knew South Korea fighting super spreader event, Iran starting struggle China had, back January, quarantined entire megacity... True. Plus seem better US Brazil genuinely can't stand fact live here, fucking embarrassment people selfish they'd rather go beach play part social distance. Fucking pathetic. People damn weak ots piece fabric. write list store go get less hour. WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISER. wonder moron spewing Trump non sense. guy said contained back lioe March. worry everyone, theae hotspots, everything normal. Smfh COMPLETELY insane. throwing hands surrendering. Online education beefed-up readied anticipated 100% closure school buildings. safe way educate children pandemic. 1) UK still technically part EU 31st December 2020.

2) UK case numbers declining post recovery figures. current number infections probably low enough learn time.

I think based know now,if enough space socially distance beach park going to, especially mask problem whatsoever.

That said, saw beach lake certainly wayyyy many people it, easy anyone recognize common sense (if cannot spread arms fully wide laying sand without hitting neighboring party...) fighting lot improvements. But, it‚Äôs going take people tend fear sweeping change want incremental. Dr Crazy makes yet another announcement. read entire sentence? mean wrote people would say that. Right, they've hard time getting people hardest hit communities agree testing.   30% currently planning battle Bill Gates mechazoids 5g goes live could seen coming? /s please don't. countries legit banning travel us bad here. dont. use   USA #1 right? keep giving money millionaires billionaires eventually allow money trickle down... america that's going impossible... Ugh. Sorry felt that. didn‚Äôt know non lethal pain like possible. They‚Äôre sending hospitals. girlfriend works fulltime special needs daycare. bitten, require masks, can't maintain six feet children disabilities. feels like never ending possibility. Meanwhile market: stonks go lol brrrrrrrr bomb virus big dumb military Japan? goddamned bet do. make actual wage here, that's beside goddamned point. going around people, wear goddamned mask. really, really hard. Twice walking CVS walk back mile get mask forgot. county cases MD Gov. Hogan clear mask wearing especially indoors. Haven‚Äôt seen 1 person inside w/o mask three months suburb. Proximity NYC/NJ probably helped us take seriously üòí. Agreed. even taking account vastly incorrect numbers US still terrible job. world's richest powerful country, smaller share world's infections. total infection number less 4%, money power means anything. Apparently not. even thing came from? it‚Äôs everywhere anyway, East Asia, Oceania Europe control, US totally fucking up. There‚Äôs one else blame except dumb people government(s) inside it‚Äôs country. extremely pessimistic prediction. lot things done avoid next large scale lockdown.

Of course, lot things could work better. Germany great coronavirus app. share rest Europe? hospital outskirts city that‚Äôs normally busy. video chat doctor phone look leg thought blood clot. 
He looked foot phone chatted 5 minutes. phone call cost $250. Can‚Äôt imagine you‚Äôve worked long think you‚Äôve seen people promoted basis competency connection lieutenant gov talking SUING governor shutdown rules governor idiot wants slow reopening close certain places numbers jumping.

Thanks NC, trying one transgender bathroom bill see.

Grateful every day job lets us work home return date sight. 

check numbers daily new cases. last days horrible. please tell testing widely available. I'm scared.  blacks will. Yes Lol expect good service fucking TEENAGER making garbage hour. Interesting Oh look. Another model.  
GIGO That's true one cares understatement. I'm nowhere near big city traveled rural Iowa, Wisc, Minnesota weekend. felt like everyone thought weirdo wearing mask none are.

So traveled throughout rural Iowa, Wisconsin Minnesota weekend...

During pandemic.

Maybe travel three states pandemic, mask mask. Bullshit. because...of much higher risk things like HIV Next milestone numbers, unfortunately Look NYC‚Äôs #s April 9th 5.400 cases, 800 deaths. march 19 (thee weeks prior) 1,133 cases. Sure, everyone‚Äôs state/province/country unique, there‚Äôs still something latest death numbers US past month. Sweden put death thousands citizens - exactly Sweden did. hard sure.

Open air seems really good,and combine masks... real chance pretty small impact.

But given probability play, huge underlying driver many people said protest sick. 

They aee unlikely superspreader events though single person infects 20 others. rate reserved indoors events. contained current hotspots.

The biggest outbreak nunery Slavonia stupid tennis exhibition Zadar. linked Serbia.... nuns Kosovo tennis players came Belgrade. Well, Swedish people generally population. live Sweden, I'm Swedish. Maybe happens, definition planet changed. now, planet defined round. Yeah, live Santos, coast. ton people around city dismissing whole thing still gatherings/parties. insane. would think Makes sense. school reopening really question risk-benefit. would argue education, particularly elementary level remote learning nearly impossible, far important opening malls restaurants beer pong parties. 

I absolutely furious 6-year-old can't attend school fall people irresponsible dildos right now. guys slow testing... forget double edged sword! makes numbers go Emperor look bad so... Maybe numbers go dramatically down. go substantially down, up, like miracle. Lakeway. GOOD. heard kidney problems, thanks giving something research earlier days pretty much nobody got test grave condition already. We're catching cases earlier now, getting better treatment patients trending younger better chance fighting off. good make numbers look better, still expect deaths start ticking follow cases soon--especially hospitals reach capacity. Got source back up? 

Steph Curry first NBA player tested.... March 2020. Haha, watched movie last night encountered Bill Gates stuff r/conspiracy day. series videos something called Corbett Report seemed annoyingly plausible persuasive, sources everything. Seemed kinda like pro propaganda Fox. considered going poke holes time bother. Besides, even stuff true know get stuff like nano chips on. Wanting profit global healthcare indicate willingness create deadly virus. End week now. 225 new confirmed deaths. last week. Hospitals getting full non-covid patients. feels like completely separate issue unrelated Covid Covid testing. Crickets. Coronavirus task force briefing today. Pretty sure they'll tell us ""Everything fine! Nothing see here!"" problem China exactly provided reliable information... tells nothing. told someone love trust yesterday ""see sides"" mask/isolation/lockdown ""debate."" asked even means, said ""there's fine line safety civil liberties"" dropped ol' ""Those would give essential Liberty, purchase little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty Safety"" quote.

shaking damn head. run president, Americans would love  Lots hostages chinstrappers. would know how...exactly? I'm Malaysian, living Malaysia, around SINCE beginning covid19 related measures JANUARY/FEB period. Even pre-MCO already prepping. easier people dont get cruises. So, easier target people sick due cold flu season, lifestyle changes (more indoor activities), drier air means virus MAY linger air bit longer normal It‚Äôs bad MSM Dems made political. I‚Äôm numb news don‚Äôt believe it. Fauci lying masks every day new symptom hasn‚Äôt helped. many done fear BS. Special ed students possibly damaged life this, particularly youngest children ASD. ideal scenario would bringing special ed students back physically rest student bodies continue virtual school work vaccine. problem special ed kids won‚Äôt bounce back they‚Äôll remain handicapped would appropriate early intervention. Cool-Aid perhaps? Cause people certainly drinking agree first point, wear masks. 
I disagree data comparison China‚Äôs reported data US. communist party elusive evasive onset. reported cases value. sad thing people AZ already blaming illegal border crossers hospitals filling up. 

(There definitely going on, huge stretch say accounts significant proportion patients.)

(Also, outbreaks originated side border. ) Less vulnerable people around kill? much better. friend‚Äôs husband pilot he‚Äôs furlough 80% pay since March. airline took PPP money said can‚Äôt lay anyone Oct. expecting get let go isn‚Äôt willing return. incredible shape bmi 30. dumbest measurement use today. sorry Life &lt;DOLLARS Ok good luck   Look pro sports starting back up. Daily testing kinds guys popping positive clue ""sick"". Multiply general population everyone's getting thing end. Yeah know someone died got right beginning, everything closed down. Spent month ventilator died. Maybe, maybe, would made months later. thought - may get it, want everyone kinks worked out. :) Get life - whos fucking ordering take pandemic? posted multiple times allI get downvites presenting facts. people prefer live caves. Lol expect people get paid fucking job? based current recent principles astrophysics. know without doubt current knowledge astrophysics end all? nope. infinitely possible, possible something happens stretching part universe distorts gravity way cubed planets formed. universe massive anything possible. equally possible current models 100% true fact never change planets round. answer question you. no, seen planets. know empire isolated 19 th century succumbed corruption despots ? I've actively refused job US last year direction US in.. Still sad it. anyone see coming idiots protesting? That's generalization. moved back westside LA New York, lots friends acquaintances compliant this. political ties, ego hubris two biggest factors. confirm. It‚Äôs like live Eastern Massachusetts. I‚Äôm grateful manage retail grocery store we‚Äôve remained open entirety pandemic. literally everyone wearing mask really gives peace mind. Catastrophe then... doubt domestic Swedes supporting hotels bars central Stockholm. Niche-tourist markets businesses absolutely forced bankruptcy need state aid, date still come (source: business owner awaiting corona relief). Except slew people suck online schooling  Never late. I‚Äôm nerd also always loved baseball. call thinking man‚Äôs game. many little intricacies baseball mind game‚Äôs played back forth. argument that. US handled properly start, talking numbers, could potentially see school start safely fall. Argentinian numbers daily update Malaysian health ministry, I'm aware site shows statistics like per country unfortunately I‚Äôm sure polls matter anyways. majority fits worldview, re-affirms it. majority worldview, re-affirms belief Americans ignorant. volatile organic compounds engine lubricant get air though bleed air system.

That seems like backwards way saying they're right. alot riots California? Worn, held, whats difference point, least something. Shaming likely make wear push WEAR it. end day coughs sneezes impeded important. Fucked thing could argue we're worse spot feudalism, lords(ostensibly) responsible well-being them. fear mandated next start fining people wearing masks. Remarkable we're capable accomplishing avoidable accomplish first place. infection rate population 2% group 100 people.... guess almost guaranteed there's positive contagious person group million Xmas I‚Äôve got coworkers talking mad mask mandatory since wear work(where it‚Äôs mandatory). say shit like they‚Äôre gonna get oh well, saying stuff like ‚ÄúMy wife‚Äôs cousins felt like bad hangover days‚Äù. Like goofs ready get sick. worst part people families home. Luckily live away family right now, would considered working due putting risk. Data new York City daycares seems show kids vector getting it. badly need figure age starts at. 
I'm hoping least open elementary schools. Riots didnt help.... Even damp mask provide barrier potentially infective droplets people. And, never know else walking street.

But, could also keep second mask pocket. love kidneys, get shit survive. One outcomes could kidney problems. neighbour belittling going beach, shit way! DeSantis tool. I'm although I'm rural. place I've seen actually requires one Menards. 

However many businesses requiring employees wear them. instance Kwik Star, Hy-Vee, Theissens. However go businesses usually employees wearing them. Maybe 2-3 people grocery store. Virtually nobody wears gas stations. Everybody knows Northeast hit hardest beginning pandemic. That's exactly Northeast states cautious reopening - they've burned, know bad really get. South experience yet partly policies much lax. 

Anway, matters trend \*now\*. Also death rate lags two weeks behind case count, we're concerned right surge week's cases (death count reflecting week's cases early July). recent case counts states picked out, week's 7-day rolling average (per 100,000 people) compared last week's 7-day rolling average: (data \*New Jersey\* - 3.36 cases per 100K people, trend -8.8% compared last week

\- \*New York\* - 7.92 cases/100K, -4.38%

\- \*Connecticut\* - 2.22 cases/100K, -43.41%

\- \*Massachusetts\* - 2.22 cases/100K, -20.76%

\- \*Rhode Island\* - 5.00 cases/100K, -8.85%

\*South\*

\- \*Louisiana\* - 14.69 cases/100K, +14.87%

\- \*Mississippi\* - 18.60 cases/100K, +79.56%

\- \*Georgia\* - 13.03 cases/100K, +63.14%

\- \*Alabama\* - 14.44 cases/100K, -6.85% (trend looking good actually AL)

\- \*Florida\* - 18.68 cases/100K, +66.65%

And btw competition. tragedy. black community spreading original rumor africans catch covid. nobody talks now, impact. agree going beaches rather selfish. thinking reopening next week. People want go pub first time while, know - iw last able go January. People want haircuts there'll rush that. week after, ""new novelty"" worn off. wouldn't. Published papers pointed evidence severity infection corresponds amount virus bloodstream, low initial exposure leads less severity days body begins ramp antibodies. would conclude 54% lack common sense Facts feelings. friend inside home yesterday. always wearing masks stayed 7 ft apart times. However, hours. first thought things right, I‚Äôm worried even big risk. y‚Äôall think bad idea? Oh it‚Äôs almost like thinking it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt end it. Sigh... anyone actually see coming month long riots? didnt mentally retarded BLM protests every major cities US. thousands... even 60k plus protestors shoulder shoulder. Get tear gassed, coughing hacking everywhere. Spreads airborne contact. Recipe pandemic get worse. politicians? 

Protesting good. Getting haircut bad!  Asymptomatic people included recovered category. Asymptomatic point, still develop sort symptoms, could minor major. Again, included stats we're seeing far.

Alot jobs cautious asking people self isolate contact potentially infected person related symptoms, requiring negative test result.

Please careful spreading misinformation! There's also misinformation. took long (and much deaths later) people favelas started prevent themselves. mean, can't stop working, question, least usage masks seems little effective. governor Rio de Janeiro, distributed PAPER masks. shit dissolving breathing it. Same. cancelled trip exactly thought. Even best times come away airplane trip feeling kind grossed while. Liar. uses Sharpies. Sounds like (U.S) things rate growth started slow guidelines reopening released. Georgia first state reopen without even pretending meet criteria... Texas alarming. 

I think BC better social safety nets (and less politicization basic science) also helps compliance Lol guy can't understand basic English condescending. Cute. take care High temps indeed kill viruses, places like Brazil population density per square kilometre enormous, won‚Äôt help. ability maintain effective distance fellow compatriots almost impossible, increases community spread negates benefit UV ray sanitizing would have. guys coronavirus task force, giving daily briefings whole time? What? fair, Trump got lot pushback banned flights China. hindsight right thing do, got lot flak time. might reluctant ban flights. unsettling unanswered question. that's point. one figured out. every single thing think kind clockwork orange horror show. drugs / vr / genetic manipulation / computer augmentation. giving people money lead self destruction. nanny state also horrifying. Link guess 60,000-person protest rally wasn‚Äôt good idea, huh? ""re-opening"" right all? US cases ever before. tackled problem all, people gotten bored it. Spoiler alert: people get tickets fines. It‚Äôs surging everywhere. Masks help, eventually take mask off. rub eyes. touch door handle. 

once got Wuhan, die cast. Trump cares say Mediterranean Sea. Us yokels Europe call med. understand government right Never knew that... looked Google Maps, literally skyscraper skyscraper hospital buildings. Really impressive stuff, effectively ICU capacity bad, bad sign. agree we're surrounded shit states quarantine check like NY. matter time comes here. can‚Äôt believe US leadership it‚Äôs like coronavirus gone. possible bad? I'll watching TV ad comes coronavirus care US (I'm Canada) im like ""This seems dated.."" apparently not. üôèüèª 

I think it‚Äôs time States enter 21st century open door political parties - can‚Äôt worse &amp; knows might get party cares everyone. Legit question, everyone know corona recovered week less. stated feel awful recovered. possible rates going virus ""weak"" first started less big deal? Obviously referring immunocompromised higher risk death. twice said believe likely give anyone gets severe pneumonia, compared getting shot gun. fear mongering, exactly I'm talking people irrationally afraid disease due exaggerations yours. literally said anyone think give severe pneumonia idiot, despite fact unlikely give majority people get severe pneumonia. Uh, I'm Germany. want plague spreaders here. managed somewhat contain shit. need freedumb fighters  HIV transmitted open wounds too, although definitely common 

So? pumping potentially HIV infected plasma vulnerable patients? president Lord Farquaad Shrek, involved self image may die. that's sacrifice I'm willing make.""

I'd like get 2020 ride now, longer fun, almost every week there's something new still cannot properly believe actually Happening lifetime. Goverment fuck citizens figurehead lunatic checks balances. Mitch holding decent legislation moving floor people power make change seem interested protecting personal gains. literally robbed tax payers line pockets hurting long time trying recover this. thought crash 2008 bad 30 seeing long slow spiral much worse resession. worst thing seeing easily large number Americans easily pursuaded interests readily hate blame wrong people defend thoes hurt most. protest started little less month ago. started. next 2 weeks exploded across nation. protestors exposed month ago, like 2 3 weeks ago. impact yet felt. cover mouth completely provide real filtration.

A good way test see blow candle wearing item.

If can? task. 100% agree. Saw posts agree fully. swede record living Spain. Would go supermarket without n95.

I went 2 months able get sun shine even windows exercising kid jumping bed using uv-lamps grow fruit trying get vitamin D.

For Sweden would say:

Testing problem quality I. beginning. assumed covid almost 3 tests getting positive led doctors skipped treated every suspected case case ignoring testing.

People avoided going doctor late even waiting test processed could matter life death.

There many good things come getting married. Beyond principle thing, there's practical reason LGTB+ people fought equal marriage: marriage gives rights unmarried couple have. 

The bad things include shared debt, division assets case divorce others.

In sense, dumb. exactly told culturally do; care themselves. cooperation larger cities? even states? Make $5000 put repeat offenders house arrest. Absolute one leave home without mask then. that's true, spike ten times many people going back work May least many traveling memorial day weekend?

George Washington never said protests didnt contribute all, point anything specifically shows increase due protests? Boston NY huge protests havent spike cases. Florida, tons people go around without masks wonder 5k new cases yestersay month since first protest, 2 3 weeks since protest full swing across nation. imposed lockdown even wanted anyway, constitution allow it. Smart move. guys think safe go resorts Spain Greece Italy? family planning go summer, countries seem cases decline (150ish cases day countries several dozen million people especially).

Should worried try make go relax? kind people shoot people tend care whether victims adequate access medical care. also gold medal. shows people somehow ""agree enough"" something completely misunderstood person saying I'm relatively populated area PA, still wear masks.

Young people barely dying take word Go research science data others have.

Hospitalizations key whole thing.

People die die hospital.

At point I'm starting believe troll agree mix both? Protesting extremely dangerous thing undoubtedly caused unnecessary spread, we're seeing crazy outbreaks cities protests took place. LA example exploding NYC not. held massive protests. Shit - North Carolina? Every study without peer review nonsense. peer review published studies looked at. literally defending thread. Go home, drunk ‚ÄúBut *garble garble* LIBERTY *garble garble* FREEDOM *garble garble* CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT‚Äù

*waves flag violently* can‚Äôt imagine dense. take responsibility actions. It‚Äôs life sadly think youre really really underestimating Trump. ignore day he's dead understand draw last choking gasp slip void little Haydyn safe ""fuck 12"" grandma smile  Brought Carl‚Äôs JR. good luck dude. seeing, also dangerous situation in. Money bank make knife proof. US absolute disaster right now. people protest outside can‚Äôt celebrate 4th July? Seriously. gotta get head rear stop blaming everything. 

People personal accountability. towns cities leaders accountability, States officials accountability. worst handled places actually heavily dem controlled places agree anything POTUS says.. fine. 

But people think wearing masks Left-Right thing. idea. know many people Left think fine go without mask on. mention protests riots. It‚Äôs odd thousand fans gathered outside stadium entirely predicted event known advance time location police decided ‚Äòwasn‚Äôt worth anything about‚Äô yet Brixton hundreds officers arrive riot gear. 

What‚Äôs difference? Oh.

Both wrong, idiots, didn‚Äôt try stop outset dispersals people arrived ridiculous. Sounds like mental health issues bud, genuinely questioning reality much. seen doctor recently...? want scream people; work retail I‚Äôll wear mask long I‚Äôm in, 8 hours? 10? Fine. Yet someone going shopping maybe hour can‚Äôt handle rather fight us wearing mask first place cause scene safety realized president like Minister Magic Fudge refusing believe Voldemort back taking action protect people. Must worth potato salad cake.üôÑ manage put socks on? put mask gloves.  part uniform now. prevalent people like US? know crazies 5G Bill Gates population control new world order Democratic dominance conspiracies, seems fringe? least foreigner. know also people somehow think masks form submission, yet seems different.

I know, certainly crazy watching happening. USA going need lot time recover this. Ignorance seems biggest issue. know long sick symptoms waited seek medical treatment? sad information brought Father‚Äôs Day.? NUMBER ONE! NUMBER ONE! 

So great living best country whole frickin world! /s

^kill camp, spouse. Unfortunately, live Tennessee, employers requiring return work despite increase cases, hospitalizations, deaths. many officials telling us pray faith, shutting things back down, mandating masks, requiring employers allow employees work home can. moving family state soon find jobs elsewhere safe travel again. I'm sure 2021-22. Oh get away ya roach. People die every day since beginning. world can't stop there's new illness knocking about. Get ffs. Though lockdowns supposed 2 weeks could better prep hospitals etc? #And blame BLM disagree this. Protest spikes would already appeared now.  Yuma known gem Arizona.

they pretty much stand principles, prove wrong lol Well, assuming Europe States testing rate, new infection numbers us higher (even per capital) importantly: didn‚Äôt decrease. doesn‚Äôt matter it‚Äôs contagious. point media social media echo chamber picking unique unusual cases stoke fear. Remember it‚Äôs sort story sells papers. unusual. 

Nothing contagious nature. Children die measles that‚Äôs contagious isn‚Äôt reported on. Confirmed cases, guess. Source? husband quit job. make decent/passable money working home. want put little guy back daycare thing understood control. privilege happy have, exercising help cut contacts people privilege. one place track hospitalizations Florida: increasing 3 weeks. good chunk Americans stupid entitled that's why.

A couple weeks ago, took risk getting haircut. chose middle morning hoped busy since would work. arrive find one customer, three people total including hairstylist. handle that. I'm waiting guy get done getting haircut, wait listening conversation. guy stating stupid whole covid virus is, started mocking people wearing mask.

You also companies requiring employees come back office instead working home. employees capable job 100% remote required continue work home! I'm witnessing many companies opposite sake of, ""face face interaction"".

You basically chunk people believe since gotten chances low get nothing worry about.

Look, understand business needs open employees physically sustain. However reason good chunk businesses cannot remain working home still. Unnecessary risk. deliberately obtuse. Many things inconvenient benefits outweigh harm inconvenience. Even without pandemic, make sure vaccines date get yearly flu shot. inconvenient book appointment take time day visit doctor inconvenience outweighed benefit getting sick making anyone else sick. Masks same. 

It's enjoying inconveniences cost benefit analysis. care people health. benefit worth cost. statement also wrong, please use proof evidence commenting estimates. Japan island 120 million people. France size Texas. Canada larger landmass U.S. 

Canada's obesity rate 29%, France 21, U.K. 27% Japan's 5%.

The U.K.s smoking rate lowest, Canada France higher U.S.. Japan nearly 60% higher U.S.


They expensive cities live less expensive rural areas. high standards living. longer life expectancy U.S.
And spend roughly $1,200 per citizen less per year Government tax dollarss pay versions universal healthcare.


So despite population, landmass, obesity rates, smoking rates, plenty variables similar lower costs better outcomes. bet that, dojng ""mistakes"", avoid getting sued false advertisement whatever. country. people. 'real american' thinks invincible. live MA, state downtrending. People disciplined here. get it. friends Texas California scared shitless lives. next day? Shhhh ü§´ pretty sure states done nothing plan contact tracing quarantining people hot spots rushed reopen.

 itching reopen quickly possible due economy public complaints didnt bother anything prevent future spikes like countries since saw virus mostly overblown ""bad flu"" going harm big cramped northern cities like NYC.

 think also really betting idea seasonal virus like flu wouldve gone away now. 4th July going disaster ""‚ÄúWe are,‚Äù Gov. Ron DeSantis said press conference Tampa""

Source? understand politics work Sweden? sarcastic. open schools september it‚Äôs going turn mess, reopening things soon, august huge surge think really important variable I'm surprised pepple talk it. Positive rate new cases proxies understand it, vary accuracy much. country we've talked lot community spread, cases unknown origin really need avoid. really tipping point this. know cases contact trace, instruct contacts self isolate stop spreading it. R0 goes lot effectively track trace isolate making less stringent social distancing controls keep outbreaks occurring. That‚Äôs enough representative population. CDC estimations, could high 10x confirmed cases. 23M US. That‚Äôs still 7% US far. Good job. happens actually put effort contain virus. actual link OP.

Nobody taking consideration effect lockdown life. don‚Äôt know live weeks protests one wearing masks grocery stores people still gathered groups outside deny end. already ran excuses (seriously, last attempt saying hospitals/State Governors lying followers invade hospitals prove this) fandom firmly believe whatever says (my father law, e.g.) Easy fix. Slow testing. [This NY Times opinion exactly talking about, along rest right wing media. baffling people believe TV personality knows doctor expert field. yet, are.  It‚Äôs truth. 
Because government can‚Äôt anything people don‚Äôt believe coronavirus exists kill anyone majority Americans mattered everyone said (word rhymes boomers) weeks ago, kept saying ""but look Florida Georgia!""

Nothing changed highly infectious disease transmits. seasonal. Reopening, barring change virus change behavior (mask wearing) back closed things down. exponential curve, ramping up. There's way around that. Slow spread get crazy high numbers. people still quoting tested numbers determine death rate. nobody told doesn‚Äôt make sense yet?

Again, English first language, often leads misunderstandings, someone could explain better, would appreciate that. there's nothing wrong paper, would beyond interesting finding. one lol...

hehe remember trump issued travel ban entire Europe except UK time UK already hit, would made difference. countries stuck right middle winter too, peak cold &amp; flu season top pandemic sub hard type news. media too. Actually disgusting. sounds amazing! Hey! give place read this. briefly read pooling blood testing, every source find specifies testing positive HIV, notified, wouldn‚Äôt possible dumping thousands blood donations without identifying blood actually HIV+. also individually test blood type? take word even though lots people don‚Äôt know blood type giving negative blood recipient positive blood extremely dangerous? viral load individual hiv extremely low? pooled blood sample doesn‚Äôt detect since blood diluted mixed blood? seem like questions would easy find answers blood pooling common practice. Annnnndddd month long protests going on? people shopping daily grocery stores mask?  Wonder many early deaths hydroxychloroquin. Agree - I'm US way anti-maskers understand asking wear masks protect others, themselves. anecdotally, seems like nearly spread asymptomatic pre-symptomatic. numbers US lack contract tracing capability scale, doomed thing ripple section section.

I also shocked country letting US citizens fly point. Virus mutation? blaming China failures Europe ridiculous. come mental gymnastics Even within executive branch messaging inconsistent wide variety topics predating covid. current inconsistent messaging consistent past behaviors. One lasting changes make result stop licking fingers like that. never knew much started wearing mask face. take extra time sort papers, use one wax finger moisteners grab grocery bag work. 

It's definitely eye-opening. Work Myrtle Beach, SC. I‚Äôve several people vacationing PA said it‚Äôs great able walk around without mask. can‚Äôt tell many times I‚Äôve heard country panicking nothing all. New Jersey same. 

But worst come complain one wearing mask safety. üëè WENT üëè üëè VACATION üëè üëè üëè PANDEMIC!  think age protective factor, seen people 29, 31, 34 either dying severely ill they‚Äôre verge dying, said Dr. Uppalapu. study showed obesity increased amid coronavirus. 40% people reported gaining 10 lbs quarantine. early estimate paper (0.8%-1.2% applied corrections current raw numbers via 20 million infected estimate current US statistics. bring IFR 0.6% 0.86%, closer early estimates. correcting, within range 0.8%-1.2%. politicians control healthcare dont listen medical science professionals. wish could say feel sorry you, made bed, no, dont. tell you, cook- wear mask- passionate people *wearing* mask morons not. get venomous mouth breathers enter shop wanna dick around health coworkers insult bonobos like that. surprise really. behavior people mentally compromised many fronts. 

Wearing mask garnered much hatred - coming side claims whatever want life. 

Government buildings stormed assault rifles, blocking hospitals, refusing wear mask... next? Yanking masks people wearing them? 

Look, reality wearing mask decrease spread virus. Staying shelter decrease spread virus. want about, OK - but, wear mask? making statement sorts here. something protect others, bur well. Yeah people definitely careful right now. Anecdotally nearly normal levels travel though primary concern University students. Small communities tightly confined disperse larger ‚Äùhome‚Äù communities across country. happen fall break, Thanksgiving break, winter break. would imply 50% us population virus would mean nearing herd immunity cases slowing. totally case. think IFR greater .09% Well, makes sense.

Also someone neutral politic system (I agree different sides different things follow party), somehow masks became politicized seems like. people getting sick. infecting home groups now. One person brings home whole extended family gets it. Business must go on. People need get sick. ER nurse virus part daily life. need herd immunity order achieve need people sick.

Real floridians considered Florida man shit incredible entertainment tries speak though. Doesn‚Äôt surprise all. Would gone bad flu season wasn‚Äôt pumped hard media governments. 

All heartache lockdowns etc something we‚Äôve living year destroyed society. these. new cases last days people came Sweden. even imported case US.

It exploded soon opened borders. 90% imported cases Serbia, Bosnia, North Macedonia Kosovo. rest places, including Sweden. 

The biggest outbreak ƒêakovo nunery nuns coming back Kosovo. 50 cases 3 days probably many since kids kindergarten got it, people attended mass also got .... major fuckup.

The worst news seems local transmission started, specially Zagreb. think atleast million americans die happens unfortunately. trump alt right needed feed something sheep keep going downvoted sure. reasonable line thinking. masks (what silly thing say) caution government action moves quickly opposition said action overwhelmingly mocked silenced. SUMMER STOP said challenge rent

Coronavirus patients hospital England dying slower rate peak epidemic, analysis suggests. 

[University Oxford found proportion coronavirus patients dying day England fell 6% 1.5% April June.

Improvements treatments, changes patient population seasonal effects could play role. Nothing like designing entire philosophy around single datapoint. Lol. Thanks - case interest one paper published NYC SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, infection fatality rate (IFR) hard accurately estimate. key parameter disease modeling policy decisions. Asymptomatic spread limited testing understated infections hard predict ways across jurisdictions. survey serology, antibody, studies COVID-19 infection find official cases understated average 25-to-1. Further, analyze deaths infections New York City estimate overall IFR United States 0.863 percent.

Be .5 % 1% - still awful either way. count odds permanent health issues, least double IFR close hospitalization rate. can‚Äôt stop testing? Someone go check that. Might promising! think worlds exponential population growth big problem work, spend!!! Patients diagnosed asymptomatic patients close contacts diagnosed patients directly isolated, rather restricting activities QR codes. QR code used restrict movement people areas high infection risk. briefings never anything proper begin with. 

They held tons misinformation always caused confusion havoc. 

Texas, Florida Arizona going start hurting - summer months... administration stated would by. Imagine working oilfield Odessa. really wouldn‚Äôt believe insane shit hear person, see comment section local news. people get ""Sovereign Citizen"" cards one yet. pretend I'm Optimus Prime bonobo needs jail. There's definitely element truth this.

When someone wants something unusual, government say, ""You this."" really helps overcome fear stigma.

But also people actively want exact opposite anyone tells do. deaths still falling though- Covid weakening better care? lag death catch proportional cases? crazy. reason half country buy in. heavily influenced people like Rush Limbaugh saying country needed open back first day lockdowns, began questioning merits Dr. Fauci Dr. Birx reporting. climate, would police even touch ten foot pole? takes one person color saying ""no"" riot breaks out.

You know true.   We're forecasting election winner here.

You need ton precision say ""holy shit, lot dumbasses think opening country bad idea"" make Choji Naruto proud. Speaking of, hoping would see kids running around Naruto headbands given mandatory masks. Covid‚Äôs gonna finish job Sherman started. Southeast CT quite good. see people masks, also plenty without out/wearing necks. Citizens allowed question governments decisions! dare Karens! myriad problems resulting inflamed cardiovascular system cytokine storm. MA, chillin! fun bozo southerners! agree people much ""instant gratification"" culture can't look future make sacrifices daily basis ""it's bad"".

I think never waste opportunity shout, ""FUCK YOU!!!"" politicians abandoned us.

Both climate change pandemic systemic issues. There's amount personal involvement personal behavioral change replace effectiveness systemic solution.

If every single person stopped children became vegans, going stop climate change industry munitions driving it.

If every single person wears mask, never effective lockdown virus endemic, masks easily worn correctly, people making masks bandanas shit. They're medical grade.  Thank kind stranger. give ideas. Yes obviously. site check country?? Facts manipulated statistics. 2 weeks away. That's gonna really bad  trump background really necessary I‚Äôm worried Texas. austin hit 100% ICU bed capacity moving emergency capacity used week 2 Australian government entirely filled useless sacks shit somehow managed keep things control decently. ‚ÄúWhatever want‚Äù American way. avoided states far?

Difference 25% deaths per capita, sweden total 5230 deaths whereas USA 125000 deaths, mostly since sweden similiar problem New York, absolute majority population lives shows much failure response states. work large factory small area sent four people home. Gonna fun summer. 40 million+ Black Americans. think same.

Unless Asian probably covid-truthers demographic. Yes costs money, US also wealthiest country world. came half trillion dollar covid relief package almost overnight largest corporations.

The money's there. competence political not. There's always convenient excuse ""Oh money tho"" comes helping average American. media, virus spreading... much winning USA days. Keep boys wonder curve mattered. NY, MN, Boston peaked coming side. Maybe means less active spread shelter/recovery. Houston never peaked slow build exploded opening everything protests?

Or slower build think. NY gets attention March/April building Jan/Feb know. disgusting shitheads really happy shitty impeachment final takes Gestalt. wonderful. people get infected die, better election outcome november. Smear shit faces quit fuckings jobs win election. Losers Yet shocked, OK shocked maybe surprised Malcolm Jenkins back saints. live Louisiana even know went back Saints. Guess I've distracted life kill Chinese people like ranted fucking mental patient join ReOpen PA

No thanks can't make Wait y‚Äôall don‚Äôt already that? Everyone pretty intensively months. NYC almost everyone takes masks seriously. hard losing 20,000 people city alone. people realize need workers go places? lockdown, essential employees hit hard. think brunch movie theater staff well trained, equipped, prepared.

So make sick, force businesses close anyway, what? without burst cases? According article need 300,000 tracers 30,000. ""not going well"" understatement disagree, free hypothesize see fit. Agreed hopeful news. don‚Äôt even know person even said ‚ÄúI think death toll go up‚Äù....... like... shit? That‚Äôs common sense, still good news. Days Well, many companies sending employees get tested 1 gets sick tests take 5 - 10 days told. least 2 weeks can't work anyways. going keep happening though know many companies going do. Especially (from I've read) 30% false negative. Governor Abbott effectively undone everything mayor tried do. Literally day Houston's mayor required face masks, Abbott undid it. mean looking Mickey one, totally Donald Ducking home zoom :)

Ducking home shirt pants :) She‚Äôs tested 12 times.    come mickey, right thing Thanks rabbit hole. first annoyed lack information, damn interesting maze.

Interesting posts month ago. Yes works, comes price western country willing pay. know, kinda value freedoms, thing unheard China.

I personally believe would let anyone weld shut home. need wide-scale compassionate use rollout Avigan hot zones across world. already prescribed antiviral influenza effects well-known &amp; documented. Even decreases hospitalizations 20 30% godsend regions limited ICU beds. giving much credit ‚Äî mess head deaths citizens opened r/Coronavirus post listening to:

Oh, irony :D student gets C, it‚Äôs great. 

When F student gets C, it‚Äôs wonderful. 

So, hey, improvement. *grasping threads*  Lockdowns lifted quite time ago I‚Äôm afraid. Things looking okay, started allow quickly. DOH hospital test still traveled close contact

That's February. else think could June--summer influenza? Lol... Yeah is... interesting U.S. state pretty middle road this, control elsewhere. feel happy able. Basically answer ""the places hit hardest first peak"", pretty much greater region NY adjacent neighbors, Washington. Half bots 1/4 internet trolls fight giggles. 

Unfortunately remaining 25% people lawmakers listen to- poorly informed, old, selfish folks. Right, forgot internet can't see sarcasm. fabricated consipracy theory lie. bit freaked new case numbers doubled past week. *really* bad sign. shit's going last much longer have. one thing really go long way towards slowing - masks - somehow become political issue US. Covidiocy become worst aspect virus. Well governor said expects us deal increasing numbers... idiotic indeed forget obese diabetic (thanks obesity). I'd bet still decent number smokers here, too. wear pants zero health benefit.

WEAR MASK! It‚Äôs fallacy American vs European comparisons. America scale equivalent European continent, individual European country. 

This pandemic really highlighted far handle properly need good governance multiple scales: local control outbreaks, regional organise hospitals, national/state level control inflows outflows, federal/supranational level coordinate states/countries. 

Failure one levels exacerbate issues others, country handled situation perfectly, fails one multiple scales. America‚Äôs self-sabotaging governance really doesn‚Äôt help. source internet honest enough totally full Better nothing all. Also help brief contact, like stores food pickup ""Games same. got fierce.""

\- Slim Darwin due governor's fast response.  going prison. Better pucker up. know. Canadian, who's also pleasure suprise overnight US hospital visit incredible 6 months later still discussing this. study retracted ffs, mask works reducing respiratory virus spread individual population level, know since least since 1918 spanish flu. ¬†FactCheck reporter Angelo Fichera, interviewed Jensen,¬†noted,¬†""Jensen said¬†he think hospitals intentionally misclassifying cases financial reasons. that‚Äôs comments widely interpreted paraded social media.""

They get paid morex costs treat Covid patient due strict quarantine intense intervention methods. Doctors get paid (tend salary) hospitals get paid treatment costs. make matters worse? lag would lead possibility multiple games played discovery, leading potential players infect.

Unless bubble actual bubble, be, seems like absolute hazard hold Florida places. NBA MLB MINDS Disney.

Hey sports orgs! CT, NJ, NY done great job getting numbers down. Try meadowlands, IZOD center even used! Much lower risk NJ still mandatory mask order public, strictest statewide order country. need critical mass people wearing masks peer pressure shaming works. Almost like herd immunity. I'm sure enough people Miami care enough others start wearing, start looking noses without masks. reinforcing misguided argument wearing masks large assemblies constitutional rights. words words explain irrational behavior. People weird af this. phones, apps, bank cards, health cards etc

We beloved Tim Hortons app apparently knows waaaaaay much.

Yet trying stop virus protect health martial law.

The way live grid, like hermits. Cmon, media biased ? hmm, happening? 1 would exist without case 0.

T-rump peeked r/lockdownskeptics last night see they‚Äôre saying shit hitting fan. Saw post said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm starting lose hope‚Äù thought, wow actually realizing flawed logic conspiracy theories failed them! Clicked post read comments. nahhh saying they‚Äôre losing hope narrative shifting towards reopening cause Libtards media keep pushing anti-economy agenda. Ugh. He's right though. We're still first wave. Check back October November second wave. reality check, still midst worst public health crisis 100 years. Opening bars FUCKING PRIORITY !remindme 3 weeks Entered? I‚Äôve hearing fireworks every night since shortly Memorial Day. Ask repeat next shareholder's meeting... Let's discount fact young not, beds filling rapidly could lead secondary deaths way delayed emergency care non COVID patients.  US failed state that's why. Compared damage lockdowns? 

More die then. Oh definitely bad actors today, perfect free market well informed citizens would able divert interest business move instead one better support societies views good moral. whatever reason (self esteem, time, globalization) society able align values long enough period time move market way see fit, instead allow minority decide, minority decides farce labeled ""regulation."" Dump money testing. Advise mask wearing, serve example AVOID making political talking point. Mandating masks makes even bigger political issue. 

Work states guidelines even penalize aren‚Äôt using science dictate move forward. Provide resources funds contact tracing, etc, whatever need. States localities one creating measures mandates fit circumstances dealing with.

Is way make hand sanitizer, masks supplies readily available? way create universal guidance restaurants, bars, places people gather? Prescribe measures whatever work need get point.  unfortunately no. everyone. Even pregnancy group fb pregnant women Texas bible belt laughed NYC personally posts said real conspiracy. argument woman florida mom fb friends said deaths made up. even though said knew people died. bunch posting covid scared. It‚Äôs like train. 


You need hammer brakes way reach bridge out.


Unfortunately, Florida still cruising. terrible take. rotate phone right you‚Äôll actually see things massively improving I‚Äôd like sign Cinderella Castle Coronavirus Pancake Breakfast. Free antibody tests 12 under. American empire fall eventually. stupid fucking way happen though. think Sheriff 19th century would publicly come announced going enforce returning runaway slaves?  


That's stupid strawman argument. Like absolutely batshit. Yes. 
Some doomers went top. may joined time two. whole federal government except economists ironically downplayed crisis. Even people TWIV downplayed it.

Damn doomers. article says scientists going write article peer review I'll reserve scientists' intentions gets published; cannot imagine would truly publish results focusing data point immediate glance outlier unless lot work understand context validity... get torn apart peer review.

This almost sounds like media site trying generate clicks insinuating COVID-19 around early 2019... usually Reuters pretty reputable knows. I'll wait another week damn fatality numbers lower anywhere else. *Trump Pence wear darn mask, neither I!* - Every denialist 'Murrican Can't say rest country. Florida vast majority people see wearing masks. Probably 90%, still people. Sadly, ‚Äúat-will‚Äù employment state, fire pretty much reason all. Well that's great except things listed propaganda.

The bit hydroxychloroquine? Yeah, Trump telling people go seek science - studies since shown appreciable effect antimalarial drug COVID-19.

And even know talking something specific regards WHO, lies coming Trump damage, 100%. even people overseas falling it, apparently. Nah, countries track too, lockdown wear masks without fussing (and protesting... Wtf protests virus?). numbers might bit off, sure, reason America many cases reporting far off. amount people would follow order would dwarf amount people disobeying principal. enforce it? enforce enforcing it, anyone seen wearing mask indoors ticketed cop.  hunt bot masters tickle throw up. People don‚Äôt realize serious flu actually get. Since flu permanent lung damage. take 2 asthma medications daily, probably rest life. get it. Florida needs stop testing fixed? beautiful tests?  never remember soap 100% year. Graduated 2015. heart heavy education system. I‚Äôm final season 3 (Netflix US numbering). 

It‚Äôs wonderful! True, interesting see really many. quite bizarre disease means either symptoms 15% manageable home hospitalizations though.

People child care. another full shutdown, adults need work, kids go somewhere. school, shady private daycares take many kids pack building. Ya cares wear masks right? :( People logic never locked anyways. stop whining, every comment agree ""reasoning"". they're ""official"" numbers have, ofc they're accurate well representative, everything else pure speculation, like thread topic. Well that‚Äôs fucking stupid. don‚Äôt know guy said end...

It really boil politics US fucking A. It‚Äôs possible, there‚Äôs evidence wouldn‚Äôt able say sure ICUs rapidly filling up. Houston treating adults children‚Äôs hospitals city reached 100% ICU capacity (they still surge capacity left, fortunately). 


In Florida, new case numbers 5x weeks ago. poll actually targeting? never taken poll seemingly includes half population always ends reddit? Sure. Discussion happens 12:45. doctor Dr. Payal Kohli, cardiologist Denver. Shit, I‚Äôve ready. terrible analogy mask stop spreading, reduces somewhat, impacts breathing. ask people uncomfortable year realistic. anyone know you‚Äôre work temporarily (as can‚Äôt return) you‚Äôre waiting test results COVID, you‚Äôre eligible unemployment type state/federal funding? I‚Äôm Florida helps. Sorry sure ask :/ Source? Vermont really good wearing masks yet ^/s  country speaks one language: money anything make it. I'm amazed we've somehow able withstand influx hospitals. Although trending wrong direction last week, I'm surprised still capacity. attribute older people staying locked homes, even now. 

But unfortunately, expect last. many cases now, we're moving wrong direction. week two, expect hospitals tough times. seen news lately? antibodies last months.

Look graph cases vs deaths. Cases actually relatively stable quite death rate plummeted. Good interpretation! Thanks reply. pretty crazy think southern states young people driving spread virus. means severe cases come later, young people spread older generation. 

Worrying thought. See Canada. go outside March, April hella cold. lockdown, nothing opened, went nowhere. crappy necessary. hurricanes awaken dredge ocean.

Then Elon musk going make mechagodzilla head mars shit settles know.

What states trying compete genocide you? especially like group trained gym, 81.8 per cent trained least 38.5 per cent visited gym six times more, remainder ranging two measures. 

Almost 20% ""gym"" group never even bothered go gym anyway. sub heavily reminds lot the_donald crazy commenters are. many insane comments like yours. Antivaxxers, Trumpites, covid doomers, show kind cognitive issues. sad see much science denying dedicated life science, like efforts research nothing people would rather think emotions. I'm coming back again, way depressing :( added backlog yesterday. going ignore Cuomo turned around state 4-6 weeks faster expected lowest infection rate country? Good thing NC trying overturn government ‚Äúoptional‚Äù mandate wearing mask. reported properly.

And consider would cases skyrocketing. testing. seeing spike cases younger individuals, probably healthier, without conditions get it. cost health finances later though? happens cases need hospital space continues rise see capacity issues?

Deaths down, important main number need focus on, still turn get ugly real quick. cannot become complacent. know effective would be, especially corners places bathrooms shadow.

Also could lead people washing hands ""the UV light kill me"". Making worse better people wash hands gonna lie, seeing Asimov quote (as true relevant is) every single post US fucking getting little old. guys much better situation states. way things going here, shocked civil war broke eventually. economy fucked, cases spiking again, government corrupt care actually cutting testing funding, stock market humming along fine federal reserve keeps pumping money it. shit show. don‚Äôt even know immunity permanent. don‚Äôt even know vaccine permanent, like isn‚Äôt flu. Hopefully, large immune response is, immunity substantial. even vaccine can‚Äôt seen fix problems. 

The best way combat virus would to...you know...actually combat virus. point english language, 4 times less actually mean anything, it?

I suppose mean 25% much.  worded, first needs ""a less"", four times ""less"".

and, fewer, less. referring Colbert Report, that's ""conservative satire"" comedy show Comedy Central. Whatever video saw joke. Texas also one obese states US? Netherlands 80% people go ICU covid19 obese. devastating overweight + lung disease you. coward woop one. hope, better wait couple weeks concluding anything number deaths result new cases hospitalizations.

On average, peak deaths come [2-3 weeks peak cases. Nope. told couple different places, including hospital, hospital said test I'm experiencing medical emergency. [Twenty million Americans theories prominent physicians virus fact mutating less virulent cases, confirm % people hospitalised less likely die before, study shows. 

Maybe stick point aren‚Äôt trying score cheap political points gloat many cases are? exactly keep heading, too. mask stuff ridiculous. sense don‚Äôt agree fact Washington state masks ‚Äúmandatory‚Äù starting today 1 county state authorized actively enforce it. doesn‚Äôt make sense. Yes agree. wonder that‚Äôs another possible contributing factor article mention. May not. behind paywall, weird giant ""N.J."" spike deaths? US really needed sympathetic leadership. protest would‚Äôve days instead leadership pushing violent response. 

You get paid for. literally saying covid past done. Literally. dense? Yeah really care. believe US functional Democratic republic longer. personally would rather leave though really possible. 

Redcaps advocating civil war trump loses promoting accepting election results. Could really give fuck less redcap scum. touch head. go raining. try wash hair. remove head. course is, stock market! continue delete comments leave comments ""Fuck, stupid"" ""You're retarded"" up? contributing civil discussion? mod team promotes nothing opposite. This! ...excepting hospitals starting overflow we're still week three real shit show. We‚Äôre talking people already billionaires stealing half trillion dollars think couple thousand month combined pandemic unemployment relief lot money?

$3600 month six months plus one payment $1200 $19,200. Six months food rent that‚Äôs gone places could live. I‚Äôm one cheaper parts California unless take roommates aren‚Äôt even getting rate.

Maybe could keep focus actual problem. mean $500 billion problem. $19,200 ‚Äúproblem‚Äù that‚Äôs actually critical safety net something probably already baseline. don‚Äôt actually need structure society everyone wage slave. Unless, course, keep buying nonsense notion even possible one person accumulate billion dollars people get $19,200. believe fired specifically whistleblowing, bet ass companies find way get rid you. states, including Pennsylvania happening, called ""at will"" employment, literally fired shoe comes untied boss like color shirt wore today. Yeah, fucked. refused service store open. grocery stores Walmarts people set outside allowing certain number people stores time don‚Äôt mask on, won‚Äôt even let in. Southeastern US. law they're not. kicking Europe's ass infection rate hope you‚Äôre right, increases started 3 weeks ago. typically takes around four weeks infection death report.  

Additionally, lot people recently infected younger. Wait spread parents older folks. Might lose chance catch cases early soon federal support testing pulled. Telling ""go home"" drunk, fantastic! ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  Data Europe seems indicate spreading schools big issue.  Let‚Äôs ask Ancient Rome worked long term. Oh wait... Good point. ski resorts earliest cases remember. jumper thinks flying 99.99% air time I‚Äôm genuinely interested think stupid curious reasoning behind they‚Äôre stupid, they‚Äôre ‚Äúfucking stupid‚Äù 25%? get number? 30% 45% story Houston‚Äôs ICU capacity believed hover around 80% ICU capacity used without COVID 19. mean they‚Äôre cases away needing locked time?

I can't speak Houston's capacity would wager there's misunderstanding.

80% probably capacity instead occupancy. 80% occupancy, capacity would 20%. said 25% aligns point. Although, given nature virus, tell hospital 25%/is still close R0 still trending up. 

But money community need drives decisions. 

When Wuhan became overrun virus, China dug roads sealed people houses. goal stop new infections entirely bring active cases zero. 

If that's goal locking state time insufficient. that's goal need different plan. ones decided kill anyone. exception President every states‚Äô political leadership went effort recommend promote social distancing mask use form.

The US deaths per capita countries. Decisions made even receive text notification looping in. Fortunately, people microwaves large, imagine clothes dryer instead. Nah. got people, gonna bigger number. Look rate, fine. Death rates flat now. They‚Äôve always followed increases cases. really funny use name Karen insult. actually pretty shitty makes sound like 12 cannot ignore protests rise cases. true. daily deaths 7 day moving average peaked 2200 per day mid-April. it‚Äôs 609. 73%. New cases (7 day moving) previous peak 32000 per day early April. bottomed 22000 new spike. -33%. similarity trends. Deaths much dramatically. hospitalization rate? Still around %20? virus hits everyone eventually, death rate stays (1/3 1%) would close one million dead. Social pressure requires social support effective.

In Florida, huge portion people support idea hoax, covid real, masks ineffective infringement rights, duty keep economy healthy acting like nothing different.

In environment, likely people pressure others wear masks... I've wanting move New Zealand since child. Still do. Love country! Holy fuck La Haine one time favorite movies! I've seen know find I'm going search again. happened come T.V. one night speak french hit like ton bricks. U !! U A!! We're Number One!! Yes, let's take already precarious economic situation add complications it. 

Are gonna bring house arrested people food medicine? would push ""someone else's problem""? like trying drive looking side window It‚Äôll retracted week Florida general never really closed. governor safer home order. businesses however close, could pretty much go anywhere actually open. wanted go grocery shopping could go everyone else. Certain business‚Äôs labeled essential never closed. restaurants could take stayed open. opened back phases, went phase 1 phase 1.1 1.1.1 matter weeks. Opening things like hair nail salons, restaurants certain percentage things. phase 2 little bit later. Fuck, that's crazy. South Carolina trajectory, looks like.

Arizona utterly control. Yes claim something illegal misinformation. agree staying home, spread false statements they're facts. One bars/restaurants near Trivia attended religiously I‚Äôd usually go friends Friday Saturday too. reopened indoor dining adding relatively cases daily, there‚Äôs chance you‚Äôll catch confined space strangers masks. buddy owns restaurant feel him, I‚Äôm willing risk life couple beers Cases dont matter, hospitalizations death rates matter. overwhelming majority cases asymptomatic dangerous person it.

In last 100 days city, quite large, used less 1% hospital bed capacity since March covid patients. Many, many Americans understand compound interest marginal tax brackets. Exponential growth may well alien math. NBA needs again. They're set restart abridged season weeks fucking Disneyworld Orlando places. like comparing everything terms Tulsa rally. keeps digging poor turnout. (1) problem 'open country' protest demanding people re-open country middle epidemic. succeeded states, result turning epic disaster.

(2) There's nothing wrong worried protests health grounds \*before\* learned spreading much virus. they're largely we've learned viral spread minimal, ranting reeks politics. time move another talking point. Ive gone local subreddits talked mask use. people onboard, many people violently time.

Problem tiny fraction population uses reddit. see almost one masks live Nebraska. f%cked. wonder 44% look what's going say, straight-faced, fine. Make mistake, people freedom fighters; self-centered assholes. like that. Goalposts forever moved regardless provide them. 

I'm stealing that. Thanks! Reliable source figure 300,000 per day? knows exact details, point country went full blown police state while, really changed many Swedes view Denmark, image go lucky Ma√±ana Ma√±ana culture shaderd good.

Anyway, main contention headline claiming ""Swedes"" hankering travel abroad false.
Only media talk it, normal people plan Hemester, vacation home Svemester, vacation inside country, maybe combo.

The rest world relax stop fretting us, good. Matches numbers Denmark Norway well. Time start defunding! interest happen align Remind wearing mask outdoors place social distancing achieved achieves? guidance along wear masks public places social distancing cannot achieved. changing rules here?  Texas stupid. declared success got hit really hard shut immediately flattened curve, since flattened span weeks almost completely reopened. we're seeing growth shut down, except governor swearing never shut again. hospitals absolutely overwhelmed now. told die economy going plan guess. I'll decontaminating get data trusted, peer reviewed sources. trust agencies incredibly sad.  it‚Äôs definitely important thing, sports back capacity marks level progress towards beating thing. may seem like best timing pulled means learning live adapt l.

 failure leadership.


From beginning, people heard contradicting messages experts elected officials. Experts say coming America, president says liberal hoax. Experts say close down, president supports protesting closures. Experts say wear masks, president makes look weak. piss poor leadership throughout whole thing confusion, disbelief, rising death toll stems it. So, take out? seeing cases based activity 1-2 weeks ago. It‚Äôs like waiting steer Titanic away iceberg it‚Äôs 10 feet front ship... Perhaps small silver lining deaths appear going (even raw numbers terms) cases. signs private choice comply go elsewhere?

As opposed health department rules cleanliness? Really different. keeps schools opening. could warned. especially they're going let people come go please Northern imbeciles go party becasue open want fun. Mabey 10000 would ok can‚Äôt right, it‚Äôs wrong üò¨ people paranoid covid tracker think martial law next also people wanted military called breaking windows looting started. can't blame 5th seed cascade without blaming first four also elderly turned away young. Doctors given chance offer care healthy patient likely recover unhealthy patient less likely recover... awful place Italy that's exactly choices made no, sit heat inject bleach veins.

Silly libtards! /s remember sounded matter fact it.

Because story we've seen play across world. People US already started locking February according economic data. Yikes  Vince McMan... (I don‚Äôt know spell stupid name care look up)...has face made thumbnails. Thank Mr. Pence. ‚ÄúThis sure humble Texas people‚Äù yea only. living hear life, seeing people handled things now, chance time soon. I'm pretty sure Pence tested every day using Abbott 5 minute tester. can't say though continues point disparities. everyone access daily quick tests, could stop virus quickly. 

Someone developing saliva test--I know happened that--but imagine it: lick tiny stick every morning. turns blue, quarantine immediately.  sticks tried Senegal, think, cost less dollar make. Similar tests available malaria. really think saying.

The case count goes people get tested.

Only sick people get tested.

If tests run sick people....then sick people.

Which really makes point even worse means even cases asymptomatic carrier groups getting tested. one regret undergrad pursue stats minor. broadly useful skillset. like know Texas counties, Harris county Houston located... too, apparently. That's disappointing Powerful men leadership positions fucking up, know let's blame suburban housewives. bothered check evidence yet yet another one ‚Äòno evidence‚Äô haven‚Äôt bothered check sort situations.    know search google date see Gates made comment February, demur statements later?

Like, average joe one thing, hell, even average leader - Gates done tabletop exercise situation uniquely placed raise alarm simply day states started taking action. blaming him, giving pass like he's untouchable figure. much failure every actual leader. Yeah know people planning FL trips north cause North shut boring. People suck. sincerely look biggest douche bags High School follow advice. Possibly even 18k real fucked part, yeah that‚Äôs good point. Ship already likely sailed next week‚Äôs numbers don‚Äôt act NOW, it‚Äôs going get really really really fucking bad something tells one care still go party 4th July I‚Äôll take things antivaxxers selling stupid people $100 please I‚Äôd curious see virus ~95% population adhering ‚Äòbest practices,‚Äô we‚Äôre otherwise level reopening countrywide.

South Korea exactly this. They're concerned ""second wave"" they're seeing [whopping 30-50 They're 1/7th size US, would equate 210-350 cases/day US, instead 37k yesterday. happy wrong. think time, based would happen absolutely nothing. say, looking great... situation Argentina?  Ain't truth. People going change hits home. Luckily, James Harden love strip clubs, Florida known their--WAIT SECOND, SHIT. I‚Äôve Jobbie Nooner Raft previous years, spreading out. People shoulder shoulder water one stays boat whole time. It‚Äôs cesspool non-COVID year, can‚Äôt imagine like year.  Religion helluva drug think small percent probably really noticed stocks go up.

I really hope less consumerist mindsets, drive-thrus Starbucks pretty long, think case large % people. People wanting embrace challenge (and probably feel empowered to).

What's interesting BLM might proving better driving global solidarity covid-19 climate change. wonder that's telling order solve problems like covid-19 climate change, first need equality. course, could western eyes, maybe West wants BLM East wants Covid-19 (really hard BLM China, info that). Yeah - long enough us know all. Maybe inevitably goes back China we'll get numbers that? Well ya. werent enough even lockdown. people think over. Even Mayor Miami saying thats people thought, hes much try inform people otherwise. POTUS responsible, CDC responsible, idiot Americans cant follow basic guidelines responsible.

Heck Ive people claim ""health care workers"" sit argue masks arent necessary. guess found people graduated bottom class cheated way school work industry. Agreed. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs 9 12 tests. 20 co workers multiple tests well. testing repeat testing. wife head go every Tuesday 2 negatives. Waiting 3rd negative now(her work requires sent lab respond tested ear once) Florida imploding read whole article lol.

I didn‚Äôt say doctors get paid more.

My original point hospitals receive funding Covid diagnosis. That‚Äôs citizens frame staying locked down/re-opening binary move. There's way country could stay closed months that's re-opening process extremely slow paced pretty much regardless location. Unfortunately, autopsy‚Äôs mostly thing past. They‚Äôre quite rare days. date, county done one COVID19 autopsy. agree lot pandemic chaotic confusing State government Texas murdering citizens, pure simple.

He said real Tri-State area always NY,NJ PA. said CT always tries join don‚Äôt belong, lol. Philly boys. usually push barge harbor set there. I'm hoping push barge set without telling anyone. town flat enough people see yards. family members protected case 0 working together. brother Sweden said ""fuck y'all I'm going herd immunity"" listen anyone said ""please don't"". That's him, case 0 familiy members. friends family make fun CONSTANTLY lockdown taking seriously. think nobody knows anyone it, really hard take seriously (for them, even feel dumb sometimes extreme am). 

Its really frustrating. time start knowing people it, late. right causing rifts lot relationships. precedent established lies okay reason behind fallacy palatable enough.  Brilliant!

Classic Reddit shit Holy crap, guys!

\*\*eating ketchup chips safely watching Canada\*\* we're going herd immunity, expect 70% catch virus happens. That's 231,000,000. CFR 1% like we're ""hoping"" (though S. Korean, serology testing, claims 2.2% European nations hit hard around number well), that's total death toll 2,310,000 (1%) 5,082,000 (2.2%) virus burns out. might take couple years get there, we're ""letting run course"" point, that's course we're on.
 
We big hopes vaccine, comes fruition, need plan alternative numbers laid above. Hope best, plan worst.
  
Oh, worst case scenario also need include fact starting look like infection confer long term immunity. lungs already scarred first infection, second infection year later might even deadly. There's reason Dr. Fauci infectious disease experts referred ""worst nightmare"". highly contagious, airborne respiratory virus fatality rate seems deceptively low general public, initiate long term immunity. think George Carlin said something like 50% Americans stupid. Right you. keep going totally dissociated think much actually give up. choice have?

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Holy fucking moley that's jump going interesting. point, everything seems pointing avoiding indoor gatherings, even extended family members. Suddenly, school season rolls around, going opposite. Yeah supporters ones taking things seriously maybe sorry people DYING? never said every single person lmao. Stop making baseless accusations look good fine... main thing limits ""spray"" oral/nasal cavities infecting others around you. 30 40% cases ASYMPTOMATIC barely symptomatic. especially true 20's... may think hay fever allergies. even run fever. literally kill anyone 60 mouth/nose covering. leave bit? numbers make much clear actually means. Mask wearing unnatural, unlike potty training (for non special needs children). Can‚Äôt compare two. teachers going send home preschoolers every time take mask off? way 3 4 year olds going comply day everyday.
Edit: many patents need go back work. many luxury stay home homeschool children. It‚Äôs unrealistic. honest it. Stop faking American people thinking ""advocacy"" personal benefit. Disney already announced yesterday delaying opening thought. insane us one countries centralized air handling homes. country felt cost savings weighed risks. frustrating. literally peice cloth. Get yourself.  I'm open minded

This good attitude have; need keep open mind focus upon research scientific consensus whenever possible.

With mind, personally seen indication ""outdoor activities"" problem. live country widely believed 'eliminated' Covid-19 allowed exercise outdoor stringent lock-down periods, albeit one important caveat - 'Keep Distance'. example people would go run large open space park keep far away individuals.

Nearly research globally concluded close contact (less 6ft/2m) two people spread virus. likely virus spread respiratory droplets produced infected person coughs, sneezes, talks.

Therefore anyone region ongoing high rates community transmission keep distance wear mask.

People protesting, shoulder shoulder retail, restaurants, *at lake parties*, wearing mask keeping distance increasing risk community transmission.

Source:

* [wiki/Coronavirus - [WHO - Modes transmission COVID-19 [CDC - COVID-19 didn‚Äôt say money comes someone checks box. said it‚Äôs included next year‚Äôs budget.

I also didn‚Äôt suggest 30k makes huge difference. even sure said that.

I suppose I‚Äôm clear either. give up.  Gates knows far vaccines disease regular family doctor. worst part ignored warning people things like awareness evidence needed handle properly March. chose act effectively. Exactly! Uncritically swallow positive information, doomers! Psstt... put beds center call hospital. Thus hospitalization numbers flatten out.

Later label center natural death morgue keep covid deaths down. protests handing masks needed, along side regular people thing. 

Then contact tracers. Contact tracing done phone, street handing masks... really sure point trying make need really lockdown place contain spread.

Locking individual places accord combined allowing free travel entire time still screwed.

I dont see benefit trying blame healthcare workers still plenty people traveling whatever wanted. purpose moving around, leave alone. Go fools demanding right go vacation, traveling multiple homes, etc.

Viral outbreaks start slow get big quick. country enough cases support uncontrolled community based growth started lifting restrictions. cases seeded plugging along low infection rate suddenly opportunity break out, seeing 2-3 weeks places started reopening. haven‚Äôt seen single one smug, condescending ‚Äútwo weeks‚Äù people while. wonder why? Me. am. think people understand exponential growth? believe lack knowledge idea works, lack caring happens... issue even worse then. zero super spreaders year suddenly super spreaders pop country country across globe exact time Jesus lol ignorant much? Look outside bubble surprised learn. is. Texas Florida thank Arizona taking FUBAR trophy. blame way?

I mean, voters going elect? politician ensure better tomorrow, need go pain today

Or one We're going make things better today without causing pain! ""when everyone turned air conditioners on"" phrase makes sense Florida. Unlike north, they're year-round. going Florida play?

Go to... know, North Dakota somewhere like that... Thing is, really work way, even adjusting nosepieces, curve arms work ears. kind shitty tbh. stop wearing one, infuriating say least.  call nation shithole kind agree premise, think direct correlation absolute rule do. Also, obviously political situations representative people, like military dictatorships colonialism. US one iron clad excuses, electoral college allows result representative popular vote. Many US citizens ashamed saddened leadership many us working hard keep Trump second term, even though efforts may vain, never represented ""man"" like Trump. Americans pretty fucking stupid. 

They actually even wrote Lancet paper setting makeshift fever clinics triaging people. Didnt read back Feb? people taking time take Covid related poll actually concerned LMAO Lots professionals saying losing severity. stop watching positive cases deaths. freak knew many people got common cold clean surfaces keep distance want, STALE, SHARED, AIR hours upon hours day causes best circumstances corona spread. 

They need true HEPA air systems (many NJ schools ac anyway), leave windows open fresh air flow take outdoor breaks much possible. 

The amount money effort goes cleaning surfaces HALVED use half proper air filtration, monitors rotating outdoor time every 15-20 minutes classes.

Murphy, though, one governor's mentioning airborne transmission, start. [Too [already extreme homo-phobes.

Forget toxic masculinity, that's straight radioactive. stop testing many people, gosh! Yeah, although even things alluding to, course *good*, still pretty much things done competing corporations. However bad shady treatment corporate competitors is, like sort humanitarian crisis actual mistreatment individual people anything. moisture need sure talking *neutralizing* antibodies? think know study referring to, noted younger patient less serious infections low undetectable levels neutralizing antibodies, good reason expect memory cell mediated immunity. I'm pretty sure common cold corona-viruses cause repeated infections 4 little cross-over immunity (which bad, initially hope use one virolation agent Covid looking good right now) links single-strain coronavirus known cause multiple infections per year I'd really interested seeing it.  need get R0 

You mean R number.

R0 virus's theoretical R number everyone community susceptible (the 0 R0 means zero people immune antibodies vaccination) one changes behaviour.

Sorry pedantic! guys sounded like scam back Feb Yes, dear that's nice. like climate deniers always cherry pick studies support PoV. Luckily scientific consensus really clear mask issue, responding gish gallop nonsense longer really worth anyone's time point. remember...and helmets doesnt legitimately impact death numbers? 

If death caused intubation wasnt ""not Covid""?

Just like bad ulcer gave wacko remedy believe would heal you, kills instead. cause death? ulcer? disease becomes less severe. Daily deaths still declining pretty much states, least growing anywhere near rates new cases. Overall excess deaths also almost back zero means even though people still getting sick large numbers, don‚Äôt get sick anymore, likely improved treatment. trend continues, it‚Äôll harder harder advocate mitigation. would done diplomatic way, like asking, ""hey think mask would help prevent spread nose covered?""

These poor employees first told wear masks would scare customers, they're told (correctly) wear masks. Deaths might lag bit longer wait include virus spreading people people giving parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, bosses... schools start up, worry many teachers getting too. Since total case numbers going up, deaths don‚Äôt seem bad NYC. Doesn‚Äôt mean herd immunity working? Since people testing positive getting sick it. forgot obese one higher risk. 

Glad body-builder pandemic currently. Fuck china, always knew killing citizens keep mouth shut poor management covid-19 [image police violently suppressing coronavirus [I think issue Riverside country Governor gave counties power open up, Riverside county opened quickly. Like almost night. friend dance studio opened weeks able to. One good friends tattoo shop open damn near whole time. wife works CBU starting classes online person Monday, mention don‚Äôt really anything set even though months plan. Doesn‚Äôt seem like great way mitigate issue. smart governor would try maintain balance sickness economy. Find measures cost much maintain economy like masks, hand washing, testing, quarantine, tracing. steps low economic costs. governor would select business activity high economic potential low sickness risk: outdoor restaurants, shopping pickup distancing, manufacturing, .. would shut businesses risky high economic potential: bars, festivals, dormitory housing farm workers .. me, like using facts expertise deal problems. üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ, trump handlers trying keep screwing Anyone familiar internet fake service animal credential industry surprised took long. mom serious business executive sat multiple company boards got companies take Microsoft seriously. also worked Microsoft helped run early days since Bill real experience running big tech company.

Your comment seriously sexist ignorant bullshit. I‚Äôm currently living elderly parents die hard talk radio listeners decades. I‚Äôve screaming radio begging parents dismiss recklessness saying entire quarantine time period. Thankfully, many arguments, able judge seriousness situation pretty much page approach living this. feel like never forgive radio hosts dismissing whole thing putting lives people like parents risk. take government's failure lol No, 7-12 percent infected now. close back please? Scientists take 6+ Month rigorously study virus understand . 

Karen debunks 6 minutes internet research. well every country except SARS hit ones lazy beginning. remember advices early february said. People please something still contain it, literally every country outside asia basically nothing. Heck EU basically offered member countries buy combined masks everyone January, member countries basically declined offer.

The US advantage getting stuff together one week longer europe, given nature virus already pandemic, spread inevitable. lost it, like UK waited two weeks long. Americans enlighten basic factors may behind bounce back

I find perplexing different European countries also suffering lockdown fatigue non compliance rules (see Brits Bournemouth beach, Spain quite lax requirements certain regions)

I can't seem understand US bounce back far severe countries, I'm outsider looking in. makes feel better, degenerates stole tax money front eyes probably pay someone watch kids? Someone‚Äôs getting helped, need it. Arizona states heading directly direction New York April. States need impose stricter measures, example closing bars mandating mask wearing lift burden hospitals. 

Unfortunately already late change devastating impact have. Could imagine shut travel whole thing started? might able completely wipe COVID-19 Oohhhboo! much better FlynnStone apparently immunity everything VAT, Car gasoline tax aside pay 35-40% taxes social insurances Germany. Additionally employer pay half almost social insurance (that's everyone).

I think biggest difference is: actually benefits paying taxes. sick stay home 10 months (3 weeks fully paid employer, 60% paid health insurance) still able use 30 days paid leave vacation (per year). There's copays medications, cheaper general prices negotiated government insurances (if remember correctly). send kids university smart enough, roads good free use, polixe nice army able defend border. Public transportation existing (I'm German, I'd rather die giving car). Gimme drone fitted neon orange food dye loaded water gun. I'll enforce it. make point generalizing black community generalize Asians? Lol. Go Rona then, moar infections freedumbs! Would strange didn‚Äôt appear besides one sample really slur sheep. can‚Äôt go meet 4 friends bar I‚Äôll murderer even though families good health scream lungs shoulder shoulder tens thousands strangers? 

Going start naming ‚Äúcovid logic‚Äù It‚Äôs simple.

In March got it, still pretty early far knowledge goes it. first weeks, dead set going ER even though getting bad. knew sick, wasn‚Äôt 100% sure Covid. So, thought, already bad happens Covid go hospital could catch Covid top it, could causes kick bucket since immune system shot time. 99% sure 1% hung up. mention reports time saying can‚Äôt really help except put vent. Early April really considered going, denied. wasn‚Äôt mid-April two days feeling better something went haywire spine/brain stem nowhere incredibly fast, come ER finally. said no, moment would‚Äôve called 911 give option evaluating me. Situations circumstances different many people. looks like he‚Äôs spanking truth bottom, way moves right hand. Considering outdoor transmission much less likely, question wisdom policy mandating masks outdoor spaces easy maintain distance. mistaken saw case r/legaladvice thing. 

Will try find caffeinating. study carried Prof Carl Heneghan, Professor Evidence Based Medicine, Dr Jason Oke, Oxford University Dr Jason Mahon University York.

It's jokers again. always said IFR low anti-lockdown. think know we're talking about. Something eating ultraviolet light injecting disinfectant? Hmm, Ok, Ill change profiles 2-4 days, want change cause I've changing alot, thanks explaination get upvote. comments show small snippets ""after covid"" future, something never get news. appreciate them, keep posting! That's never feel guilty something take advantage company

Right ya, friends get it. act like I'm suggesting start insider trading physically stealing things. want use new (unmonitored) play games instead 6 year old Walmart Black Friday special :(

""I can't, work!"" 
The work given raise entire 5 years there, different one? press release. say claims peer reviewed. Sometimes press releases made public relations reasons get funding. 

Note wording: tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) common mosquito (Culex pipiens) unable transmit SARS-CoV-2 virus. **This demonstrated *preliminary data* study**....... . bad terms hospitals brazil? possible part reason virus mutating? really wish could enforce closure borders except commerce over. northeast could band together shut rest country. numbers would eventually drop almost zero we'd able resume normal life lot faster. think states getting hit hard serious shit storm protests shut again. Like Texas? Forget it. people gonna stay inside.  Horrible Hopefully less doctors getting sick too. expect many antibodies numbers compare ""non covid"" years, ""Flu season"" years, would nice comparison.

This seems like sensationalized title though. I'd say cases going hospitalisation going down. least severe enough cases. Obviously. Times changed bit since though, numbers pretty positive seeing 2 months ago. whole, I'd agree boat really dangerous far pandemics go. Assuming stay boats such, yeah, people getting close enough others worry it.

However, bringing *that many* boats one small area requires whole lot people running store get gas, food, alcohol, etc. likely handful stores right near docks/ramps. lot retail traffic could avoided, potential workers shops catch/spread seems pretty high. Back hole death rates flat despite increasing cases hospitalizations, would seem confirm article‚Äôs point?  Damn. kind feel bad well company handled this, esp. US everyone else fucked.

We left offices March 13, ~150 us location toting monitors equipment home.

On monday, booked walk 3 others scheduled, gather personal belongings, letting get desk chair, file cabinet, furniture items.

There way around paid vacation, dont want it. happens company fosters work-life balance productivity. Productivity always follows. Amazing! so, there‚Äôs significant chance you‚Äôve saved life. NY here; personally ive heard 2 individuals aged 31 33 placed ventilators, made miraculously however, think younger better chance getting vent Agree - think nice weather March/April bought time. transit back forth Northeast Florida February March, expected Florida bloodbath early on. People even claimed Florida success story.  another form virtue signaling. real actual death rate 4% would super noticeable.

I think lot peoples ""not caring"" comes from, beginning people saying ""someone know die this"". But, majority people still know someone impacted significantly. 4% would. Door know anyone died 9/11? 'Its katana. social distancing stick.' Stop overexaggerin something kills mostly old people going away anytime soon. effect economy great, continue lockdown arbitrary unknown point met future foolish. problem federal government gave everybody enough money stay home, penalized people breaking area's pandemic laws. would learn quick follow safety rules risk losing financial support. small part problem states blowing cases. Several barely anything combat spread start, taking long, enforcing it, snd giving soon.

But yes, help, especially protestors follow mask/distancing also go food, fun, pleasure afterwards. I‚Äôm surprised. one tech field knows Tesla one worst company work for, output. 

People give year two lives, Tesla stamp resume. Baseball pretty cool. lot statistics related elements sport type nerd. :) knew month ago. knew two months ago.
But it‚Äôs like ‚Äúsurprise mother fucker - corona!‚Äù bother. People hilariously denial point. made already great. don‚Äôt need gap year, need school working. College already fun. wasn‚Äôt struggling. Taking time worst thing could happen happens country efficient organised; there‚Äôs reason US falling behind (not outbreak also economically). it‚Äôs ‚Äòthose illegal immigrants must stealing jobs!‚Äô say anyone gets itm get severe pneumonia. saying things support point true. 

2 10 get hospitalized. That's reality. 

I definitely say things. I'm sorry issues reading comprehension. 

Anyone thinks serious taken idiot

I repeated many outlets (scientific) pointed out. Pneumonia considered mild symptom. think disease lists pneumonia mild disease taken lightly. 

People afraid exactly...stay inside distance more? problem there. hurt anyone. 

Stop trying support points lying. engage conversation someone so. Imagine jackass understanding health conditions making mask dangerous Virus. Meddling Karen‚Äôs Darrens. wish federal government would send funds parents quit work watch help pay daycare...literally anything.

Lol, GOP literally killing country try prop stock market. Maybe like dancing cockroach? downvote you, moving profile pictures make eyes feel strained uncomfortable. Either they're anti mask crowd. Whatever reasoning, I'll upvote make yes core TED talk gave he's quoted saying something along lines ""if vaccinate everyone reduce population billion."" That's foundation videos built. genuine quote, sort things could make person think.

But is, course, that, foundations pretty shaky. talking killing people vaccines, talking reducing future population. idea people better healthcare, children likely survive childhood, birth rate plummets. vaccinate children, make adulthood, women need become baby making factories ensure couple make school. CT well...I rarely see people without masks, although always exceptions. Exactly said Air quality terrible. said mask worn dont nose full black snot end day.

Partially„ÄÄtrue. Even though air quality bad, people China wear masks. People regularly wear masks China pandemic well 1%.  Chinese persuaded forced wearing masks around late January/early February. Every official figure appear TV mask big factor process. forget (European) hospital bill corona treatment bankrupt you. Wouldn‚Äôt taking away right certain people don‚Äôt agree authoritarianism? You‚Äôre one suggesting Size matters. least that's I've told. Dear lord, let brief. Happen link share? nobody even talking anxiety require counselling corona causes lots people hit wrong button crappy Chinese time machine? Feb 2020 anymore Lmbo annihilated dude. Spread cheeks America take rona ass.  Lol love have! Problem might scale. got vaccine elder, vaccinate them, save lives quickly protect vulnerable population. 

If plan reach herd immunity level vaccine, need billions doses make dent globally.

Targeted vaccination might middle road, vaccine people close vulnerable population. Apparently America would rather continue fucking instead wearing mask. (S)he wrong, though. article even mention rally. Bullshit headline. study clearly bullshit.

Florida going get destroyed unless people wake get program. know people died NY virus weren‚Äôt nursing homes. Don‚Äôt loose sight horrible virus is. trend pointing now. relax, pretty easily get this. reason 21-44 group (24 years) 45-54 (10 years) 55-64 (also 10 years)? thought funny would great could! Thank you. I've seen past months kinda feel like policy makers US take challenge instead warning supposed be. anyone surprised?

Herd immunity requires around 80 percent people antibodies. less 1 percent confirmed cases America. blame people Wyoming? like 13 deaths 3 months. Near live let say complete mayhem. 10pm like normal matchday early hours morning. police surely knew could happen didn‚Äôt even attempt try stop it. 

Criticise government want people literally don‚Äôt give fuck anymore flood beach‚Äôs football stadiums mass, do.  Start worst days! Fall going real fall general population care Little Johnny's cough week seeing grandma puts grandma ground. EVERYONE played beginning. jumped China Europe first reason virus strain US predominantly Europe. Flights Europe US higher number US China. still, really doesn‚Äôt matter. Blaming Europe failure US utterly ridiculous. It‚Äôs many people dying home, ambulances, Covid-19 tests performed post-mortem. Instead, people hospitals suspect passed Covid-19 reported pneumonia, heart-failure. known. someone explain come death number decreasing infections increase ? like virus :)

Their numbers like 10K new effected sound high, there's many Indians drop ocean.

They 357 cases/million, USA 7568 compare. may mean Spain carried virus china  area finally starting get hit everything college decided can't afford Fall online.... worst wave paying thousands dollars sit classroom 40 people so.... Yay... Fuck country. average woman places like Niger Mali continue 7 children each, hunger going happen? 1. others said, scale shape Florida's increase. Almost 1000% increase June, 2 months slow decline that. could continued trend May they'd almost zero cases today, instead they're halfway NY worst.

It American way. mafia trying enforce covid restrictions... would go far... is...mmmm...strange fuck That's borrowed DOJ rulling americans disabilities act. True based plan yet Republicans still hate it. Right, seem suggest lack trust authorities. But, yes, interesting see results many get tested primary care. way put # cases # deaths see deadly continues be. way, maybe could see record spikes led record deaths behind it. guess we‚Äôll never know. jump cases scary, fixate stay home. RIP America eh , consider major league sports boring waste anyway, modified blood sports , mandatory meth steroid use. properly flattened curve encourage masks, yes. Really? saw news trying tie new covid outbreaks trump rally's ignoring risk thousands people gathered BLM protests... though? really trust majority British public anything right? Gay adult men account 70% new aids infections United States making 2% population.

Funny enough last comment. seen ""proposals"" thrown around negative interest rate essentially equivalent someone standing outside house yelling shop. helped slowed spread gave hospitals get prepared. Without vaccine, can‚Äôt spread it.  50k + protests probably biggest factor spreading right shutdown. Either way.... expect NY Wuhan style infection rate major cities.... rural areas.

Well least one spelled Poses correctly ... still fucked Americans Disabilities Act, tho. Even country manage lock entire border virus came, said country couldnt provide everything industry needs, raw resources, manpower, buyer, nothing changes.

While lockdown effectively stops virus coming in, also stops trade going country. whats troubling poor countries Paying others healthcare literally health insurance is, including precious private plans.

The real reasons *slightly* nuanced; (1) want pay poor people's healthcare, (2) trust government well. 

Of course former despicable, latter ounce logic it, really experience f\*cked privatized system is. shirt, shoes, service. What's big deal adding mask.

Real freedom lovers go pantsless. hard lock proven type mask absolutely nothing. Yet It‚Äôs corona time USA! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ question die covid covid. outside realm possiblility 1 year old undiagnosed shit simply died happening asymptomatic nearly asymptomatic covid. Numbers wise right. Two huge differences though. Protests outdoors know transmission rates much lower. many protestors wearing masks. Trump's rallies indoors, know people show bother mask distance all. mean expected 2, 3 weeks protests started right? 

I understand things worth fighting for, like racial injustice. result so. People half brail excluding NY NJ cases global graphs. Well, southern states expose much brain preserved. IL going phase 4 reopening today 3 day average new cases started go already days ago. predict come back school IL fall... Yeah dont understand anti-maskers. Like theyre getting worked lol Sumo us trying watch diets. forgot blaming Obama winter Aus - better tempted socialising. said, numbers tiny anyway. Businesses private free deny business person reason (or reason) desire regardless sort disability. good case heard English equivalent: ""God helps help themselves"".  live smallish city, one following mask policy. backwater here, proud trump voters, don‚Äôt believe systematic racism. We‚Äôre getting fucked bc mask enforcement, it‚Äôs happening somewhere, isn‚Äôt happening here. forgets western time still us aren‚Äôt complete morons. I‚Äôd like able leave house without risk mouth breathers breaking social distancing yet do, landlords don‚Äôt care force type policy. Idk, it‚Äôs cool see better wouldn‚Äôt know living detecting milder cases getting better treating disease too. really went mask protest blm protest cant even like oh spike spike basically gap them.

And accurate countries. Technically still is. group people think Bill Gates paid create coronavirus (and patent it), shrink world population. going use nano micro chips mind control via vaccine Perf masks much prevalent NY protests relative Texas/Florida/etc? Looking figures amazed NY's daily numbers still low... surely evidence masks extremely effective. course, totally people south people gathering protest millions  try stay away mental health sick addiction pressing r/coronavirus. friends Lombardy repeatedly told ‚Äújust flu‚Äù whenever showed concern. Obviously opinion changed. Now, city hotspot. frustrating people downplayed concerns, it‚Äôs turned way worse predicting. ............... trouble understanding ""you can't look want to"" logic. There's major problems protests (and much) I'm sorry see that. can't help anymore I'm going leave conversation.

I adult living NYC pandemic 9/11. It‚Äôs hard overstate traumatizing watching deaths unfold, people jumping windows tv, unable call loved ones phones out, thousands missing posters plastering city, everyone wondering beginning.

I never thought min/max type person, guess I'm it. Indiana closed schools piecemeal many closures coming lot Northeast- source: nieces still school Indiana week local schools closed. became sick, definitely spread sister nephew. nephew diagnosed ""viral infection"" tested. sister denied testing. nieces stepsister grandmother tested positive covid. brother law works meat packing plant actually one people area tested negative- even still symptomatic manager forced back work matter days testing positive. Making us think he's getting already it.

In short, probably waited long school front. Also, least sister's area, stories common probably forced back work still infectious. sister given 3 days off, brother law fever, none. nieces grandmother given week off. need opinion polls tell us we've done shit job.

The opinion polls tell us information people getting shit job.

""44% Americans lied covid19 response""  friend mine took tests (virus &amp; ab) 2 weeks row last month. front line back April absolute chaos. negative everything times. fair, Trump lose popular vote, got election process designed 1700s. STUPID thinking people DIE.

Whenever get thinking, smack realize ""The hospital could also save pucking life, time GO!"" Wow, knows fewer vs less. Coronavirus cured! like 70s: Since haven¬¥t died yet, start accelerating reducing resistance. obviously dont care repercussion actions, let's good here.

Dont fine mask wearers, send hospital bill covid patient cannot pay.

The mask folks obviously dont jave problem paying tens thousands hospital care, would wearing masks. Although would expect deaths increase somewhat case numbers rise, period sustained high rates new positive tests (20-30k daily US), deaths declined. lag doesn‚Äôt account this.

The two viable explanations increased testing caught mild cases official reported numbers, deaths dramatically underreported way weren‚Äôt before. I‚Äôd guess it‚Äôs mostly former, meaning number actually infected either declining, spread contained demographic limited exposure high risk populations. 

It‚Äôs pretty obvious poor testing capacity drastically understated number infected April/May spikes northeast. it‚Äôs likely things aren‚Äôt really worse now, aren‚Äôt improved extent anyone would like see, local outbreaks disastrous.

There‚Äôs probably also underreporting deaths though. I‚Äôm little scared somebody‚Äôs gonna look retirement communities florida/Arizona find hundreds thousands corpses.

Since region opened general public mild symptoms test themselves, number samples skyrocketed. 20,000 samples taken every week laboratories longer able attend.

""We probably underestimated pressure,"" says Ann S√∂derstr√∂m, director health V√§stra G√∂taland region.

In early June, V√§stra G√∂taland region began offering public so-called PCR tests show person ongoing infection covid-19.

Everyone mild symptoms able test health centers interest greater region expected.


According V√§stra G√∂taland region, 20,000 tests taken week health centers around western Sweden, compared around 5,500 tests end May.


- Primary care done great fantastic job changed quickly, went 4000-5000 tests week 20,000 small kick only, says Ann S√∂derstr√∂m.

#The lab time


The increased testing part Sweden's national strategy, according V√§stra G√∂taland region, capacity analyze samples reached peak.


Laboratory capacity expanded internally procurement private labs, region considers longer possible carry many tests consequence long response times.


- use labs private labs labs Stockholm, try find many places possible run tests. us important prioritize patient staff tests first place, become long waiting times non-priority samples longer function. first get answer test 5-6 days, cannot take test way know, example, whether go back workplace not, says Ann S√∂derstr√∂m GP.


#Couldn't expected pressure great public?


- think primary care would effective been. probably underestimated pressure, done Stockholm antibody tests downsized.


Who prioritized sampling guided recommendations Public Health Authority, means patients health care prioritized first, followed staff operations. comes staff part classified socially important operations. individuals come.

#Children tested

**Tests individuals mild symptoms therefore limited summer. Children 16 able tested whatsoever covid-19 Western Sweden without advice doctor.


- close tests completely, must prioritize tests analyze holiday season. staff must also vacations. autumn go back normal. Individuals mild symptoms wish test contact health centers. may still times summer, says S√∂derstr√∂m.

In autumn, Ann S√∂derstr√∂m also says care V√§stra G√∂taland region hopes able offer antibody tests population. tests, unlike PCR tests, show person ongoing infection instead give indication whether person continuous infection covid-19  country specific depends policy, age structure population hospitals capacity.

I give data Israel:

roughly 3.5% active cases hospitalized.

Currently 0.8% classified severe cases. EPA gigantic ass list chemicals used disinfect Covid also include long takes (some seconds, minutes). know without doubt current knowledge astrophysics end all? nope. 

Are aware competing hypothesis, which, unproven, coherent plausible? thats actually true, mean mortality rate like .01%, less seasonal flu? Florida actually publish hospitalization data. Why? already working home, productivity increased. couple doctors Pittsburgh claiming thing Italians Source? mild know...like pneumonia. always think pneumonia mild... you? many idiots. 

Clearly disagree medical world pneumonia fact mild. anyone thinks mild idiot. 80% get mild symptoms, consider symptoms mild, saying 80% wrong. Anyone pneumonia, mind, major classify mild symptom. Mild. I'm saying consider pneumonia mild. 

Again, saying pneumonia *not* minor symptom. disagreement medical world, think downplaying severity disease medical world obviously taking quite seriously.  equivalent getting shot. gunshot wounds deadly. I'd prefer get shot however. 

You're saying people get COVID getting equivalent gunshot wound. scare mongering. country eventually going go back work, vaccine. Economics economics, people can't last savings, government can't keep borrowing money entire year. saying anyone puts risk equivalent putting front gun. scare mongering.

It‚Äôs strange. I'd fact check statement you. Assuming mean US. Perhaps way read cases seemed recent. example Llangefni chicken plant close down, surely operational April? looking US response. still people office want analyze exactly went wrong prevent happening again- even means reallocating duties away certain centralized position power.

The Europe connection important travel stopped. Also, US left glaring loophole get Europe UK, still denial outbreak.

I think biggest factor lack federal response. mean, administration literally done bare minimum. Tr\*mp administration really left decision-making individual states. point, 50 states unique response acting country way, led extreme lack cohesion way virus reported. states (NY, live) really strict lockdowns. Others (Florida, Texas) ""closed"" maybe week reopening, that. differing, fragmented responses individual states led 50 different interpretations virus severity. mixed messaging, kind choose believe, people want bury heads sand pick easy narrative: virus big deal.

Add fact TONS mixed messages masks. first CDC said masks anything‚Äî personally think may avoid shortage, like happened toilet paper. rescinded claim, saying masks actually best thing could prevent virus. President decided cling former believe masks ineffective, since large percentage population listens (he delegitimized news followers) they, too, decided mask-wearing unnecessary, infringement civil liberties.

The U.S. incredibly divided country right now. 50 states trying combat virus unique way, also highly polarizing president split country half. led patchy response, best. We're long painful ride.

And yes agree they‚Äôre undercounting probably think way. That's coronavirus political issue USA. many US states, lied massively inflated covid case numbers financial political reasons. New York example, even need tested positive considered covid case. labelled covid death even tested it. Hospitals get paid label patients covid, lot, especially since elective surguries cancelled (their main money maker). became political issue moment organizations decides lie inflate numbers political clout, financial reasons, use numbers leverage can't ways.

What percentage people Jobbie Nooner going wearing masks think? No-one sharing drinks? hugs? Haha Trump didn‚Äôt make up, heard positive results. lots medical studies conducted proved beneficial. Cause article literally mentioning Disney, specifically named them? You‚Äôre absolute right though, NONE places open right they‚Äôre drawing crowds, knowing FL bet are, they‚Äôre likely contributing rise positive cases. Georgia predictably seeing spike, exponential growth phase faring better CA, AZ, FL, AL, TX. Wisconsin ok now. would expected GA WI lead pack given early reopening. family members protected case 0 working together. brother Sweden said ""fuck y'all I'm going herd immunity"" listen anyone said ""please don't"". That's him, case 0 familiy members.

And now, logic, entire family going ""fuck y'all"" getting infected outside family saying ""please don't"". them, case 1 outside familiy.

I'm sorry mate, argued logic equivalent checkmate. Per logic, Case 1 never responsible Case 2, either Case X responsible due building previous Case, Case X bears responsibility Case X.

Since Case 1 first Case, bear responsibility Case 1, case. Per logic. 

This argument effectively over. remains realize lost. Wait. What? Florida‚Äôs case number far today (via Worldometers) nearly nine thousand? almost that's type people causing much problem right now. apartment buildings? individual unit systems pull independently central air? CDC said lower infection populations antibody tests give 50% false positive. antibody tests hit miss time. assume room 10 people get tested reflect CDC said said would 5 false positives one false negative. 60% potential inaccuracy rate, less accurate flipping coin. agree you‚Äôre saying.

Fair enough, read articles. aware Trump's bufoonery saying need test less, take mean country fact testing less comment stays unchanged Thanks luck. We'll fine. think asked age range millennials are...he would wrong Question expert: would repeat test confirm result confidence?

If test slightly reactive antibodies produced corona viruses, like ones cause colds, running second test would produce second false positive. Different people's immune system necessarily produce identical antibodies virus. 

IIRC, human antibody response covid19 usually binds ""spike protein"" uses infect cells, small percentage infected people produce antibodies stick different part virus. type antibody less effective blocking virus, seems part successful immune response eventually ends infection. test wont cases? /s distinguish slavery job though.

Even redditors want answer questions , beginning. Instead relying people ""doing right thing"", ""common sense"", passed laws clearly spell needed. mean simple science. can't really say anything sure get strong evidence, verify evidence.

But make reasonable assumptions evidence says otherwise. fine assume get immunity, least time virus. human body works. long, unknown.

In addition that, case lack evidence tells lot. lack evidence people becoming reinfected means people gaining immunity sort. I'm confused. Whose fault Finns go Sweden bring back virus Finland? there‚Äôs proof opposite either, naturally sub absolutely loves negativity Came say CBS lol ""No way good news think 10 times people infected thought were,"" Fauci said. ""So think that's something need address ‚Ä¶ consider start literally flooding system testing, really get good handle going community.""

You literally clue you‚Äôre talking about. covid-conspiracy theorist sounds exhausting, manage every day? 7 minute single mile 7 minute pace 10 miles? 

You could obese run 7 minute single mile. really impressive time.  Ok Karen. Lots people without mask Memphis protest.

 

 

 

 

 Fair enough. can't job elected for. replace them.  Don‚Äôt selfish ass sheriff see studies next 2-4 weeks. Look up. Hey downstairs neighbours! Take fucking hint!! Sincerely, Canadian. That‚Äôs one!
Oh bleach visited USA couple times work everytime go buy medical insurance covers 60 k , knowing expensive things still worried . 
But strikes really insane inaction public . Early diagnosis life saver people worried cost wont even regular check , blood analysis fucking die preventible causes . 
Sure dont large houses cars fuck-me coffin sizes . 
Sorry man much see outside American public seriously brain-washed corporations. cant understand logical human many concepts going called first world country. Urban Houston, Texas maybe 40% masked, rural places. Conspiracy theory? Lol...he whole presentation reduce population. Believing that, might little top. say nuts asinine. Pandemic Scorpion like: *GET FEAR!* gonna say anything month long nation wide protests/riots rent Hockey rinks too. 

I wonder construction workers digging mass graves grateful work?   cases growth literally highest been. even think reopening murica coincidence bet.

U.S heading steep downward trajectory, weeks ago massive protests across country, we're seeing spikes!

Texas Florida opened since late April, 5 weeks (incubation period 2 weeks) spikes, fact, numbers going down. protests happened, huge spike went protest LA last week didn‚Äôt see 1 person without mask

Btw, people yelling, masks ineffective. wanted hide identities badly perfect excuse cover faces, chose wear masks try look 'tough' enjoy. Al Gore conspiracy theories personally rip American people, global warming story telling? Oh wait... turned true. story Bill Gates. honest person would give disclaimer personally invested profiting corporate welfare trying promote. know. 

I live really fun right now. protests LITERALLY first week SAH. governor trying, local governments give fuck. 

The worst part us taking serious start. ate restaurant family took toddler Barnes nobles March 3. last real outing we've had. Everyone house starting get stircrazy, mean go park, bought cool blow kiddy pool tot, started garden, eat crazy scratch meals time, expect like this. 

SINCE MARCH getting worse. really maddening. time wasted things even less safe. They'll still blame 9/11, Katrina, Covid, great recession, black plague. People \*are\* trying though. hear this: People spending hours line vote, least ones anyway. real voter suppression here. well shit around long may April May 2019. Worst cough ever had. like month lame joke I‚Äôm glad got im texas here. greg abbott dan patric blood hands. state wide mask mandate jump. overturned mask mandate houston mind effing blown. facing hostile attack leaders state federal level. see behavior treason. proud country whatsoever hurts see fellow citizens harmed. might depend area. Like Maryland, moving reopen slowly, EVERYONE wears masks they're like since locked down. still cases dropping things becoming normal (aside masks). I'm amazed states require masks, tend ones spikes think America thinks invincible. entire debacle sense ""I care"". virus mainly affects elderly people comorbidities. beginning, led many believe really problem.

The shouting freedoms conspiracy theories people's way saying keeping businesses open, keeping job, going spring break parties important. want believe indifference life give excuses really care. Doctors know much treating disease since got infected. help reduce death rates. nightmare scenario....states bad health qualities, high % pre-existing conditions, lower funded health care systems. someone used live Bakersfield, surprising all. see old friends posting generally giving fuck looking evidence, evidence exists. Well that's fucking dumb heck thinking Saturday small group friends weren‚Äôt aware one friends party right shows exposed covid. shared drinks put mouths things. I‚Äôm getting tested wondering someone could tell could gotten infected fast? tested positive yesterday told us last night us trump helps usa get better.
All people support trump, tagged usa a.i. stupid.
Then theyre promoted attend rallies, gatherings.
Without mask ofcourse. R/wooosh Okay dumbass, READ comment, would realize give shit feelings, I'm talking shaming someone position choose defy completely versus something. People like exactly shitty mess, idea psychology works refuse leave mental bubble understand compliance always come force, breeds revolution (in case following political events late). 90% hassle fines people color. heavily enforced low income areas microbial barrier puncture, causing puncture? wet mask ""punctured""? world view shaped corporate controlled media. issue people listen. Part problem people go first info hear. CDC said masks, large portion population still believe even story changes. People told ‚Äúit‚Äôs safe go out‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe worst over‚Äù good percentage population believe someone know ICU dead. planning moving France finish studying. Learning french right But, but, shareholders feelings? I‚Äôm saying data you‚Äôre presenting misleading. You‚Äôre presenting absolute lowest deaths per million population vs US UK. Again, agree said. However, countries list already STRONG preventive measures sort thing. Face masks countries cultural norm... something U.S. U.K. hasn‚Äôt incorporated culture.

Maybe point show US UK follow outlier countries? so, definitely would explain alongside data. Yes, apparently satellite location main hospital TMC campus.

Although could change, course. Also carbon emissions 4 year old grandson significant speech delay *finally* got IEP started school. class four days things shut down. work us. all. 

I hope messing much long term. I'd rather trouble understanding catch covid-19 classroom. might good move now, especially baking tasty treats. wishing best luck! Welcome Costco love you, get fuck out. I'm boat. Graduated last year, qualify stimulus check, made enough qualify unemployment. job (school photographer) essential got cut, I'm shit outta luck, especially given looks like may long job comes back.

Thank god roommates essential jobs, cause I've coasting little savings had, probably wont cover another month two rent look like weight, shape Scorpion Mortal Kombat [reusable need Kunai chain. gonna deaths, got people. Thats works way mass protests across country influence numbers. way doctors endorsing mass protest pandemic influences numbers. always trump dumb redneck americans. Yeah ever selected one either. guess I'm stereotypical enough, lol. Bigly 20% ""healed"" people get permanent healt damage hearth, lungs, liver blood. open social distance, wear masks avoid large gatherings. world is, cure. open let rip create plague dreaded. watch coming weeks. Yea usually bother flu vaccine, year think will. must understand Sweden scratch surface, things great. pandemic preparation plan Sweden clearly identifies number vital sectors economy need protected case pandemic. goes outline sectors need clearly defined countermeasures sector continue operating almost normal times.  


But guess what?  


No countermeasures prepared. Equipment lacking. Fuck entire country shortage equipment got point nurse national television telling everyone bought raincoat local outdoor shop enough protective equipment.. 


There predefined ""pandemic routines"" terms employees go daily tasks. Former state epidemiologist Johan Giesecke also stated problems exacerbated fact many immigrants work elderly care sector due poor understanding Swedish language.  


And best part. newer versions pandemic preparation plan, requirement hold safety inventory case pandemic removed. Instead, new plan ""look need equipment well anticipated pandemic make necessary purchases"".  


Now read again. again. realize dumb politicians Sweden are. told happen. Stupid doomers ""two weeks"", right? waited like 45 minutes see spike, means spring break trips fine! extent applies anyone works lot. BMI basically leaves anyone ever added muscle frame. 

I admit though would unusual peak physical condition BMI 30. would huge scandal country, proof like this.

Whole media attention + Public Unrest + Demand stepdown + Cases filed Supreme courts = official stripped position arrested

Hey, no. AMERICA That‚Äôs...not source. cloth masks provide sterile field. thank you. 13 cases per million london.
Everyone really great social distancing messaging tories changed. became confused, hypocritical.
Now, one cares.
People lockdown fatigue given green light.
I‚Äôm angry   entire south bad shape case Nail Salon province 6 infected employees, resulting 18 confirmed cases 680 people tested quarantined. can't imagine every city state, every single day. wise 111 cases population 14 million. Ethiopia! Saudi Arabia! Indonesia! Actually late late

NYC late

This like extinguishing fire house burned Better re-think protests 60,000 people. Even Bangladesh professional management lot places protests spikes example MN, MA, PA. outdoors wearing masks makes huge difference whereas reopening putting people together indoors refusing wear masks explosion coming from. also moved quickly burning stuff attacking cops. Jumping gun kinda thing. virus hyper-object. humans get bored things, assume things get better lived experience tend too. many people unequipped think comply trends patterns see every day life happen/ People still think ""elective surgeries"" category encompasses boob jobs liposuction. actually surgery emergent enough done hospital's open slate. scheduled surgical procedure. That's millions different procedures put hold indefinitely. want laugh him, think 
many people jackass infected. Pls cheese Yeah, ok. work HVAC. person wanted futuristic mask UV light. see could prevent others getting blasted harmful UV. BosWash. 44mn people virtually one contiguous urban mass I-95/NE Corridor.  doesn‚Äôt even give insurance Dr. John Campbell one videos couple days ago titled America vaccine update, said doesn‚Äôt expect vaccine available end 2021. Dr. Anthony Fauci thinks much differently. wonder right. lasted longest, seven days, stainless steel Now, add chilled environment equation meat packaging. true general sense.. money well life believe evolution we're watching human pandemic unfold sick pangolin/bat. Yes. Florida report throughout day one update per day? Really though. coherent leadership leader power believed virus would looking like Germany something. numbers would high would better grip things. think courts already declared case law law enforcement duty protect anyone. wonder many, think stay closed, have, jobs, businesses etc. don‚Äôt shit, shouldn‚Äôt opinion. businesses make world turn. explains crazy people frothing mouth every attempt control outbreak. remember seeing video DeSantis bragging handling calling reporters reporting properly. 

I would pay money see reporters confront manner. absolutely are. put people danger encouraged well. gets sympathy well wishes. Fuck guy anyone aligned similar cause. thing people don‚Äôt realize economy destroyed either way. Oh beauty karma! England? Germany? China? üòÇüòÇüòÇ soon state opened back up, everyone went normal though issue completely disappeared. figured going start putting measures back place.  shit ""accepted"", ""scientifically unproven"". Jesus christ, going dick, least intelligent. think ~~economy~~ troops morale ;-) feel many states govs either side skewing numbers. VA test get lower percentage positive keep opening phase 3 come next week. soon still 400-600 cases day popping beaches pushing even higher. I've seen say decrease 6.0 5.9 percent.. well true tested 10k yesterday 10,500 today... course going lower amounts close worried lest restrictive environment won‚Äôt thing anymore. child special needs won‚Äôt keep mask remove classroom? don‚Äôt know happen. True, leadership countries act like still takes weeks travel one country another. everyone cooperated knowing going spread planet pandemic would've month. Even leaders world mostly psychopaths realized would've benefited everyone end quickly.

But no, countries kept secret others pretended like happening all, others pretended like together made entirely different decisions containment, even used pandemic excuse expand territory seize power.

When something really deadly comes (and sooner later) human civilization collapse disease warfare we'll deserve stupid. Don‚Äôt canadians call catsup? wonder favorite Governor. states point need follow NY, NJ CT make quarantine mandatory states like Florida. Since current infection seems high.

Wonder antibody test would show, probably like 20%. two children. school. 

And wouldn‚Äôt expect three year old keep mask on. couldn‚Äôt get kids keep hat three. 

But also wouldn‚Äôt expect three year old attend K-12 schools. ORLY? Look, mini strokes, bigly strokes. Money Please!

Mona Lisa Mouse already spikes nationwide, part existing statistics. Hundreds thousands protesters streets last month. virus care politics. hostile like, change reality. Traveling different states listed constitution?  We're pandemic? Hello??

Jesus, like I'm talking toddler. 

Actually, toddlers understand better guys. seem understand making money right even plane full. Imagine go work every day pay employer hours worked. That's basically what's happening right now. come MN, state protests originated saw longest sustained amount protests weeks, saw increase cases? Look states opened early states protests. states opened early seeing spikes, states protests seeing spikes. mean protests impact spread COVID? No, mean protests main driving factor spread COVID, ie. thing would happening GA rn even protests. though? Restaurants get scaled back carryout only. Texans aren‚Äôt wresting masks, obviously can‚Äôt handle responsibility limited capacity restaurants. someone living large metro area Midwest, worried elementary aged children fall. Break welders. duh doy. idiots. also nationally coordinated testing every water treatment facility- used tell need pooled testing. Disagree... look rest world models responses incentive people go back work sick. people top leadership positions best position change minds, least demonstrate severity virus. could also interaction medical establishment see results reopening. could soften message tone. 

It‚Äôs unlikely, participants groups might even realize *where* virus spreading places shut down. 

That‚Äôs we‚Äôre celebrating- one man severe health problem. Iraq War long ago.

And US began ignoring mass slaughter various Native American tribes. Americans know. true regardless takes kids. Trust parent live fear every day life. babies it‚Äôs highest fear never goes away. two kids 4 put daycare. feel risk low enough.  literally blamed ‚ÄúI got Satan deemed get it. wanted quiet work. slow building church. That‚Äôs about.‚Äù Florida already reopened, one wearing masks, tourists coming boatload. town, Jacksonville, says making people due cause ""it work towns sued"" started, would know worked? sounds like town want get sued REALLY want one closed sell aloc stores. like science-based conversations, may direct r/COVID19 . mostly stick facts numbers there.   cannot get sad irony situation: purport argue greater local autonomy decentralization state national capitals ones legally challenge local city government acts autonomously means consistent public health norms. Fucking idiots Seems tad privileged mentality. Regardless sentiments, serving public serving public, bet workers mentality wouldn‚Äôt job thing feeding them. also exempt minorities wearing masks avoid profiling. enjoy Zoster later, since that's ""more healthy"" vaccine. I'd much rather giant sore eye blinds debilitating neuropathic pain get damn vaccine!  pretending disabled law states? also exempt minorities wearing masks avoid profiling. city in?  Wish family luck. Also, good thinking \*gasps southern twang\* No. 

I know essential *because go church.*

I asked question, least could answer instead snarky downvoting me. think mostly preserve masks think also change thinking mask properly protecting wearer vs cutting effectiveness someone sharing emissions someone else.

Obviously people idea earlier turned right, didn‚Äôt think really clear see clear cut cases everyone choir practice getting it, families sharing table weddings, etc. eventually became clear getting spread talking/singing pretty effectively. know better treat it. know ventilator settings , approved steroids antivirals now.

In March/April didn‚Äôt even know proper vent settings Covid Agreed! minimum rent / utilities / payroll / taxes suspended. Policy without regard small businesses shows lack foresight! casino work gives masks free, along company's sister properties. (local casino 15 miles strip) entirely inside HVAC system, turned opened install replace bulbs, see problem. UV filter installed decontaminate tap water coming townhouse. Technicians need replace bulb year. also detected virus frozen salmon food market. seized recalled it. Wearing mask prolonged periods time healthy; harbor germs, restrict oxygen/retain CO2 increase moisture lungs. evidence masks even helping situation? Officials told us weeks masks needed became ""best practice"" new information increased fear needed try something. Still, refuse pay fines face wrath collection agency, paper noted, emphasis purportedly education, enforcement.

Then good fine? I‚Äôve ordering food go since April I‚Äôm 20 y/o can‚Äôt cook hates everything make grocery store... guess go back fruits veggies canned bullshit though using feelings, bro! Sure, might help, filling planes capacity surefire way exacerbate transmission. might well try make much money possible, right? Germany, America want create en ethnic lower class poor uneducated. 

Please say /s. US needs this, consider it.

Several months ago. doctor told COVID test came back negative false negative. big brain moves! Obesity? fuck you. clear mean sort herd immunity. number pre-symptomatic people moving around likely lessened peak. either case unacceptable. Completely back protests everyone needs wear mask get tested attend. random dude. award winning world renowned economist philosopher. yes thoughts conclusions likely considered worthy discussion whatever /u/shovesbigthingsuphisass69 types taking morning shit. nation lost collective shit 9/11, event overblown, event whose repercussions still affect air travel privacy. eager send sons daughters die it,

And even without taking single day mourn victims attack, attacking unrelated country. order requires masks outdoors can‚Äôt stay 6ft apart. OP‚Äôs comment. Sorry making clear. Yes, number infected people many times reported. 

I‚Äôm glad agree me. pandemic accelerating. wouldn‚Äôt. would like influenza vaccine. small , non-dangerous dose activate immune system you‚Äôre safe real thing know people believe corona virus serous. done convince take things seriously make believe? It‚Äôs always both. exact ratio probably never know sure. really hate politicized everything now, people one side believing it‚Äôs protest reopening. Damn partisan click bait media pitting Americans time like this. saying there's evidence support default position said human transmission anti-body immunity. 

It mean happened. needs evidence.  ""Good morning America. Here's we're going f\*\*\* today."" it‚Äôs hilarious nobody mentioning giant swaths people protesting. Hundred hundred people gathering en masse everyone‚Äôs acting like couldn‚Äôt POSSIBLY anything it. It‚Äôs conservatives. Lip Sweat name new band. virus real Texan here. took words right mouth. exact problem infuriating witness mental gymnastics people go justify wearing mask social distancing. Given amount people wear mask, longer confident people willing take vaccine comes available. truly depressing. waiting guy get done getting haircut, wait listening conversation. guy stating stupid whole covid virus is, started mocking people wearing mask.

Shoulda walked out. Let business know lost patron beholding customers mask regulations. wondering, hard wear mask going outside? People seem make like big deal.

Personally, feel normal wearing mask. Also, noted cached version *all vegans!!!*

""We believe freedom humans animals.""

Go figure! Let rallies happen either political party, make outdoors everyone spaced 27 feet apart headphones ears tuned broadcast signal.

10,000 people 27 square feet person = 270,000 square feet. 

10,000 people spread across 7 acres masks eye protection quietly listening broadcast signal would super powerful. That's safest way it. Wear masks sit sun want added peace mind. Terrence McKenna idea culture society boat rowed thousands. boat heading towards cliff momentum great correct, pilots hoped continue rowing hard boat would break cliff. Well seeing provided 2 pills, script, go home deal it, consultation charge maybe several hundred dollars additional fraudulent charge. Would hope wouldnt unreasonable. eh

Deaths involving Pneumonia, without COVID-19, excluding Influenza deaths: 118,510
All Deaths involving COVID-19: exact behavior trying avoid. People traveling vacationing going spread disease new areas. Please stay home take summer traveling comments needs higher context matters. Stop proving right, I‚Äôd already said black lives matter idea good cause. problem leaders hijacked cause nefarious goals. 

You can‚Äôt raging racists calling ethnic cleansing anti-racism banner. 2020 it‚Äôs turning outing idiots year. You‚Äôll spread virus people, potentially killing some, electoral system? case state provide tele learning. Denmark did, successfully.

Tactician mode. 

I read horror stories Fort Joy, planned ahead. far nothing difficult. extremely rewarding! Make fun Muslim women wearing face mask (niqab).. God making wear else get punished!... irony...

Sorry data this? LA rally wearing mask. tell maybe 50% people wearing masks.

Let‚Äôs naive. 1 event. thousands country. proof found outbreak party 100-150 people? Sorry I‚Äôm buying it. Pensions tied market though? think get money pay rest life. majority America 75%+ case paying attention. Manufactured opposition. It‚Äôs crazy social media turned average American brain puddle goo.

Doesn't stop people literally giving 0 fucks using mask inside.

It's fucked up. can't even hope go away soon simply won't. young boy always dreamed baseball... Meanwhile next door Norway 4 Covid patients ICU.

Right? Like couple drank aquarium cleaner, managed kill point? started new job WFH. issue whatsoever. training required job (M&amp;A, difference learning new company thinks acquisitions). totally seamless honestly easier would person. everyone seems fully adjusted WFH workflow. They're telling us WFH 18+ months. Gotta outside enjoy saharan dust storm. 2 generations exist according media, boomers millenials

Gen X, Gen Z Silent Generation exist apparently think it‚Äôs obvious fucked considering smartest scientists across earth STILL baffled virus. 

I hope get lucky, whatever may mean. agree testing. tested EVERYONE used contact tracing quarenteened test positive came contact someone tested positive, would done closures now. 
The system sucks! Phase 3, don‚Äôt basically know it‚Äôs safe? it‚Äôs mainly case seeing long immunity is. I‚Äôm sure pump vaccine election even find 2021 wasn‚Äôt actually super effective Same...and right definitely helps. Say ain‚Äôt so. Hope numbers don‚Äôt continue climb. one wants lose loved one. He‚Äôs three. Something tells he‚Äôs acting norm age. I‚Äôm dedicating entire summer working him. teachers aren‚Äôt expecting struggle age group, question understanding early childhood development. First smart college yet... way season like this. Need go ahead right thing let people adjust/plan along athletes students. That's saying know. Lots people gathered Memorial Day, beaches opening, graduations, protests etc. NY spike cases all. sure we'd lockdown happening. thing is, even start rolling October, it'll take months get everyone needs it. we've seen anything anti-vaxxers anti-maskers lot people need refuse it. Yup. Idk Florida, doesn‚Äôt Arizona Sheriff literally recently got COVID also came said still won‚Äôt enforce mask wearing? think abolished drug related incarcerations decades ago everyone needs speak make happen. (possession, distribution still needs regulation public safety purposes, advocating drug abuse programs public health issue)

A cop make law, unfortunate stupid laws exist, job enforce charges judicial system decide whether warrent pursuing. case judicial system ones discretion bringing charges warranted, public make sure officials elected get away stupid laws long advocated actions government's side redact remove sentencing occurred them.

&amp;#x200B;

If enjoy giving people speeding tickets, enjoy giving citations possession, etc kind dick. Cops get choose enforce based feel. cops use discretion times there's grey areas law, that's educated them, vast majority time enforce laws ever come proclaiming going enforce laws agree hold badge.

To fair also agree cops pull someone give money christmas time. That's misuse police authority. based Chinese data jan/feb idea going tested people visible symptoms.

And highly variable age, e.g. maybe 1/3 80+ yrs old 1/1000 10-19 yrs old. It‚Äôs good idea ignore 3 months evidence pandemic you‚Äôve primed exponential growth. No. It‚Äôs conversations really tiring doesn‚Äôt matter say.

Go browse r/medicine. Type keywords you‚Äôre asking about. exponential now, [you see slope tick upwards mid-June even log MAD MAN, trying spread virus?! I'm 35 year old mother 3 makes technically millennial. old people refuse math act like we're still 9 year olds walking around mittens tied coats fucking weird. say, remember west smirked China? heh, turns China best covid19 response country earth terms per capita cases deaths, especially considering hit first without time prepare whatsoever. ""State officials attributed much new outbreak young adults flocking bars reopened, many ignoring social distancing restrictions aimed lowering virus‚Äôs spread""

This says Yes THANK YOU. super careful April May danger highest upper Illinois. things started calm down, started also open lives bit. careful, wash hands, stay farther away people public, wear masks don‚Äôt attend public spaces germs could easily shared. kids started daycare think that‚Äôs fine. also see friends family while. 

I get isn‚Äôt flu young children repeatedly shown ‚Äúdanger‚Äù COVID. Yes- could die? course. die flu well do? Get vaccine live normal lives. don‚Äôt stop living kids get sick. 

I get parent children worlds. truth isn‚Äôt dangerous kids older people. whole reason socially distance keep apart close things avoid peak infections overloading system. virulent Illness careful spread once. danger passed, common sense careful (masks, washing hands, staying crowded places places showing statistically raise chances getting it) (in opinion) fine. mask wearing, social distancing Texas....I agree half state blame. But, state government knee capped local enforcement mask wearing basic social distancing. Austin's mayor begging governor walk back stance weeks able enforce mask Abbot caved due sudden rise. people wanted get haircut. Shame. hear Bill Gates killed bunch people Africa too? 579 US adults polled.:... knowledge that's hidden us. cataclysmic disaster happen, 'discussed' pretty much ancient human history. knowledge, outlook ""eff it"", world resource then. Bill Gates went vaccine route, Bezos Musk went spaceship route. someone move Florida small California town 8th grade, placed 6th grade math explained ‚ÄúFlorida schools don‚Äôt teach math well.‚Äù whole thing butt fucked.

Put everything hold pay people need money right now. Take care small businesses people worried next month's rent.

You people simply obey. I'd rather take COVID chances lose business become homeless.

Why fuck hard? like Adam Savage's lot more. Fauci keeps campaign testing, Trumpence try shut down. disclaimer, said masks prevent disease get disease, could probably sue them.

Nothing actually going prevent spread disease, masks help slow spread disease. could everything right, wear mask, wash hands still get disease variety reasons.

It kinda like things like canned beans expiration dates years buy them. actually spoil decades long stored properly, want people suing them. That's pretty dark. colleagues (yes I'm teacher) would pose problem differently: care money there. 

I can't say I'm excited risk life walking back underfunded resourced workplace, hey, that's going everyone needs paycheck.

I read report New Jersey yet, truth state can't afford best practices. plan creating school tries minimize risk keeping quality high. perfect, longer *good* choices, least worst. high school level likely mean blend remote f2f, much synchronous time time f2f educator support possible. Orange County then... Went skyline drive morning social distancing, went 711 get gas bumfuck Virginia. Literally person mask everyone stared like space alien. One person microwaved one book. netherlands √§lmost fully open, first july normal, exept, need keep 1.5meter distance people 18 years older work home posible.

We use masks public transport, might spot 1 mask shopping.

For everything still stable 80 people icu (our highest 1800) aren‚Äôt ‚ÄúThis going get ugly guys‚Äù 

Lmfao love many people subreddit absolutely *love* saying this. It‚Äôs like get suspense something. Relax. seeing cops enforcing it. good paper totally different reality People don‚Äôt ‚Äúlike‚Äù article doesn‚Äôt prove original claim, hospitals reporting deaths. evidence support claim? like 4 weeks anyway... Boring. Blocked! [Remember add racist list Next time keep lies yourself. numbers go up.... /s Houston hitting 100% ICU capacity happened, can‚Äôt ignore dead bodies start piling up, active measures Texas takes today won‚Äôt appear data another 3-4 weeks. It‚Äôs going rough July August Lone Star State... first case makes State Supreme Court probably get smacked down. point spent *way* $500 lawyers though.

As we've seen states individuals running cases up. politicians political activist groups. instance Lt. Gov NC threatening sue Governor executive orders. city ADA lawsuits grocery stores masks.

Cute. poll population 579 people. seeing 5-10 videos 

Videos source reliable information. I'm worried poor workers luxury staying home. huge influence strategy.

Clearly since Sweden adopt herd immunity hailing British strategy herd immunity ""where need go"" also crystal clear most. you, course, most.

He said English ""translation"".

Not original Swedish.

ETA: checked video. timestamp gave. Giesecke makes clear **his opinion** Sweden let virus run course. intimated talking Swedish policy, so. personal opinion. ""under best scenario""- sound good data rarely reproduced either due poorly explained scientific methods

My point was,, guys probably used sample reservoir can't reproduced. Maybe.

I would tell lab run tests unless preserving large enough sample comparisons via parallel labs (which competitors, bad). gotta love news coming makes someone particular said ‚Äúso told people, slow testing!‚Äù even week ago look like even bigger jackass. swear God, 2020 like episode Twilight Zone don‚Äôt believe conflating meant one King Co. thEyRE tEsTinG I'd say God Help Us All, think pact devil would better results point.  economic experts said, economy going recover we've dealt virus.

I know hard concept people understand. idea people keep going spending money nothing's happening highly unrealistic exponential growth ripping community. People get scared starting see that.  Straight could happened, told surge due young people need hospitalization sounds unsanitary even normal times. 95% sensitivity even worse, though false negatives problematic serology test way use now. Half people refuse tested. fact [The lieutenant governor Yeah I'd bet money start first day two distancing, end week they've given up. Can't receive Eucharist FB Live. main message newsbrief changing stance.

They also bit longer piece (by audio) says exactly ""Sweden problems general spread infection could highlighted clearly spread infection increasing"" multiple....more 30. One case wwe testing negative. Went home symptoms tested positive. Talent don‚Äôt want come encouraged come in. love WWE‚Äôs talented roster company scum. People woefully stupid here. country world find zealots people refuse acknowledge truth.

The US president- ignorance encouraged platform along many negative paradigms. 

There many us go unrepresented fact media doesn‚Äôt want rationality here. want sensationalism, want stir extremism up. article posted way backs initial claim though. intentionally dishonest?  No, teachers won‚Äôt send home every time take off. said child refuses wear one. shouldn‚Äôt fall teachers enforce masks. It‚Äôs responsibility parent get ready coming school. problem square one (wearing masks) maybe isn‚Äôt good idea. Pennsylvania swing state. Pittsburgh Philadelphia regions normally quite liberal entire area (aside places like State College Harrisburg) very, red. right Pennsylvania wants nothing preventative measures literally tried impeach governor way handled lock down, opinion, appropriate. thought facial recognition hot CoNsPiRaCy lately, making wear mask is... Atleast get y'all's bullshit straight. report post let mods know!

Unless also wanted bit cheeky virtue signaling well ;) chance sincere that, pretty much everything ever heard Trump jaw-droppingly, sickeningly, infuriatingly true. We've reversed lines satire reality. dwell well away sanity, comfort dreams.

You basically can't make anything Trump that's dumber reality Trump. protects people, him. wants people protect much protecting them.

Not unreasonable request, unless give shit people, like apparently 44% country according recent survey live county zero cases week. hadn‚Äôt outside house weeks. didn‚Äôt think letting buddy drink beer smoking bong someone would lead getting covid maybe 10 total cases county since started.

If would known cases town wouldn‚Äôt left house law CT since late March. everyone used I've seen people without masks stores last months. One kicked CVS manager one. done lot destigmatize whole thing get people used it. Florida hospital here.

We diverted first time yesterday. joke comes actual enforcement. I've yet hear law coming hard non-compliant persons here. Cali talks talk, now, walked walk far penalizing violators. 


In Bay Area currently, mask wearing 95%, I'm planning see family LA Fourth July weekend COVID numbers make impossible, anticipating 50% compliance, despite statewide order mandatory masks public. assholes anti-maskers conspiracy pieces shit want protect ""god's perfect breathing system"" much constitution? Yes, expect is. Especially, South Asia. Although data unreliable sure. Unfortunately people need listen experts complete denial, burying heads deep sand. good site buy cloth masks from? Mines given nurse want get family  Texas back tests available. maybe it‚Äôs time lack medical professionals. Either way I‚Äôve trying get tested spots filled 3 days. People also taking 5-7 days get results back said thing Croatia Also similar carbon emissions last time remember. go Lowe‚Äôs youngest wore mask. leak sink needed bring parts make sure right stuff. made mad Karen‚Äôs buying petunias guys clearly don‚Äôt need things getting. Lowe‚Äôs good job allowing certain amount people it‚Äôs anyone mother come in. It‚Äôs like think it‚Äôs magically gone away. covid skeptics even listen Bill Gates. believe he's using 5G spread covid-19 reasons. unbelievable crazy conspiracy nuts are. create test says yes coronavirus, test 100% accurate telling people virus virus. But, would give 100% false positive rate would tell everyone didn‚Äôt virus do.

So using numbers quote, test correctly identifies 90% positive cases misidentifies 70% people virus virus. hope loved ones stay safe healthy. I'm Ontario, Canada city moved Phase 2 couple days ago, allowing eating patios, getting haircuts indoor malls open various restrictions. perfect, provinces handled better, things considered, we're well. Population 14.5 million averaging 200 cases now. I‚Äôm sorry deal that. Hope stay well! That's incorrect, cars highest profits per unit. losing money net entire operation growing exponentially, building factories etc. really terrible knowing things work. people seem -falsely -- impression infection spread due poor governmental reaction NYS

NYS worst initial outbreak New Rochelle. thing declare public gatherings [within mile source outbreak. People freely going NYC could many public gatherings liked 1.01 mi center outbreak. results predictable.

Cuomo also forced nursing homes accept [4,500 COVID forced coronavirus patients close quarters vulnerable population, [20% COVID deaths good leadership? need gov't support go back work. r/SelfAwareWolves Wow way generalize people observe data ‚Äòone people‚Äô moron Apparently haven‚Äôt heard place called Wuhan?

What terrifying 3 months prepare nothing. Oh worse...we‚Äôre 4 months since get shit together, nope, going happen.

At point, buck stops administration charge. understand there's spikes number deaths week previous years?

20-40% people dying one week year week several years cause alarm?

And would worse without shutdown.

Or normally many preexisting conditions managable, people live decades.

Many people even know pre-existing condition.

The thing fake facts.

If fake, Trump shut travel certain countries?

But proven virus U.S., limit contact people U.S. shutdown?

Why Trump continue let Fauci speek?

Or China's fault likem claim, 'China handled better', WHO? 

But people want ignore U.S.?


Maybe Trump fire Fauci, spreading 'lies' dismantle CDC reasons.


LOL, keep screeching fake news Covid19, guys sound like Flat Earthers, moon landings fake, jet fuel can't melt steel beams, etc... going enforced? ""Chances everyone get this""

Well certainly putting effort make sure, sir Yes, best option all. Denmark telelearning quite succesfully. Many reports actually postie change teachers children. think countries done well, can't recall offhand moment Asian countries. get data? Internet television? true. hand mosquito-borne viruses, struggling think also transmitted respiratory droplets - any? can‚Äôt come one. 

That mosquitoes would transmit covid strong hypothesis no-one likely surprised results study. gif this? favorite Simpsons quote Wondering anyone else starting lose hope life ever returning normal? Likey effective safe vaccine become available. People cant wont isolate forever, let alone months. Government lacks sort leadership going offering us type help. think covid may one mutation away becoming ele humanity ones? Grandmother 81 COPD aunt severe asthma. wear light masks go doctor pharmacy.  
Maybe tiny fraction people can‚Äôt use mask, certainly isn‚Äôt case majority non-mask wearers. ""politicians"" generally Imagine dumb thinking librarians/libraries ‚Äúhive‚Äù minded.


Lmao bro go pick book don‚Äôt reproduce. Please You‚Äôre moron, that‚Äôs all. so... youre saying possible. might hold true current mathematical principles, who's say new math can't made. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, father calculus said principles calculus came simply idea.  assume seen developing world billions business friends

This part problem disagree point since Chinese government mostly done bad things, cannot anything good. devil deals absolute. ok acknowledge good deeds.

Let's take basic level. friend. He's getting rich, helping others, likes build homes. homes well priced benefits many.

He also likes rape daughter beat wife. That's China. also like steal neighbors. That's China. thinks center, nobody else matters, him. That's China. bill gates, jack trades like fight argue everything. That‚Äôs do. Considering infowar hand country responsible, I'd really need see samples 2019 letting enter thoughts. Yeah, glad stay there. primary source income worked there. promotion system based boot licking I'm sure said many places. :p Restaurants texas open since May 1st, bars since May 22nd. Spikes Texas occur June 16. Texas convinced whole reason, maybe reason. like explain condition backed ADA (something actually real) 

..but turned away without mask reported ""FTBA"" (Freedom Breathe *Agency* LMFAO). lot types events seem take place predominantly outdoors, definitely helps. it‚Äôs double edged sword explosion July 4th, people feel emboldened continue following adequate precautions. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs winning here... Thought Trump loving sheriff's loved law order? sheep case unaware sheep likely slaughtered. Long thought country sad state politicizing mask wearing really something fucking else OP experience, it‚Äôs majority. people life considered level-headed concerned others shown care long it‚Äôs convenient them. Nearly everyone know swears they‚Äôre social distancing make tons exceptions. It‚Äôs disappointing. Yeah debate weeks ago promised sit one videos.

Basically it‚Äôs talk reducing carbon promote product Bill Gates involved with. one point talks reducing populations would also reduce carbon. offhands lists ways that, good showman lists vaccinations (another interests). nut jobs pulled line ‚Äòwe reduce worlds population 10% vaccinations‚Äô mean Bill Gates wants kill 10% us.

I went deep commentator; pointing Bill Gates really wanted murder us would announce stage TED talk? also pointed loads ways billionaire like could murder us; like fund terrorist groups, straight bomb shit us remote island. wouldn‚Äôt notice vaccinations killing us start ask questions??

It quite enjoyable ride dumb heard first line before? Seems like song lyric..maybe.. That‚Äôs viewed it, too, suddenly living many factors came decision. 

Everyone plan get hit first punch. ""Runny nose congestion, nausea diarrhea placed CDC's list symptoms. Coughing, fever, fatigue, muscle body aches, headache, loss taste smell sore throat already established part listing."" Pneumonia cases everywhere It‚Äôs bad Huntsville Al. Saw whole picnic table surrounded like dozen leptons sitting around without masks like. know doctors nurses don‚Äôt believe social distancing won‚Äôt wear masks public. It‚Äôs pretty sad also pretty arrogant media make Trump look bad. Trump makes Trump look bad. Mods, pretty sure violates subreddit‚Äôs rules. Don‚Äôt see relates coronavirus way, shape form u/DNAhelicase That‚Äôs mentality since February True. pretty non-partisan level headed prior Trump. Sorry, checked Google, understand means. explain please? aid set stop long people find work, don‚Äôt qualify unemployment helped. Go Scotland üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø think im special, see point there's one else around. like wearing condom bed yourself... makes sense places others. Massachusetts, example, 150 positives/day peak 3000/day. 

It makes sense slowly reopen stuff parts country ignored precautions seeing outbreaks. Airport screening work anyway. Entirely unlike twisted news article suit viewpoint. Lol knew It.

 trying get friends play months. happen eventually. idea fun game I'm really RPG person. would China gain lying point new outbreak? Nah, let R U P rallies happen. make sure people bunched together without masks. sure blame biology this. reductionist, presupposes us dismiss facts based worldview are... what? Evolved higher humanity? Yeah agree. I'm definitely going wear mask anywhere go, also like idea state forcing people to. sticky situation public health vs. politics. Can‚Äôt trust parents teach what‚Äôs 1+4. need dangerous pandemic environment learn 1+4. 
I mean work preschool Canada even stuff coming I‚Äôd rather parents teach right because, get KIDS ARNT SANITARY!!! prophecy come pass... got email morning job, they're ready start marching people back office beginning two weeks. 

Absolutely need office job. mean stop testing altogether, according ""leadership"" testing means cases...... informed work 2 positives week. worked home effectively end March 2nd week June. dont need here, yet insist attendance every day necessary.  sit cube, isolated day long, getting get water use restroom.  get mask immediately.  soooo stupid here.  told today simply wear mask, wash hands stay away people.   effectively home. bet something it. Also heightened precautions nursing homes etc probably helping keep number severe cases extra-vulnerable people. hope. want Halloween too!!! least wear one yourself. owe anyone explanation personal choice.  can't. majority people make effort ever. 

Literally 5 seconds takes sanitize hands mask question most. New high score! Worst Coronavirus Pandemic Day far!  common cold spread inhale virus particles infected person‚Äôs sneeze, cough, speech, loose particles wipe nose. also pick virus touching contaminated surface infected individual touched. Common areas include doorknobs, telephones, children‚Äôs toys, towels. Rhinoviruses (which cause colds) live three hours hard surfaces hands.

Most viruses classified one several groups. groups include:

human rhinoviruses
coronaviruses
parainfluenza viruses
adenoviruses time kids high school, remote learning much feasible, need miss year. son last 3 months Kindergarten remote, learned basically nothing. blame schools teachers, certainly tried- developmentally appropriate kids young. mean, mind control already exists. Put something TV often enough sheep believe it. Quick easy. Yeah Missouri‚Äôs numbers relatively low, big spike cases yet, contract tracing we‚Äôre red. It‚Äôs really annoying people you‚Äôre doing. scatter communities making harder challenge. go bad ideas individually confronted believing they‚Äôre attack ideas becoming entrenched identifying ideas. It‚Äôs counter productive. You‚Äôre contributing problem. Difference person supports ‚ÄúMAGA‚Äù / Trump person support face masks is;

The MAGA idiot follows racist, bigot, white supremacist cult. person supports face masks cares fellow humans community. 

Wearing mask you‚Äôre healthy you. It‚Äôs protection aren‚Äôt healthy. 

Tl:dr fuck Elon racist Henry Ford era. y‚Äôall coping pandemic/virus? 

We tend talk LOT science financial impact virus, I‚Äôm interested today y‚Äôall doin. It‚Äôs 3 half months since shit fan nice conversation. 

How y‚Äôall holding up? I'm sorry people live reckless life (and own). Lmao even discussion that's going on. they're saying definition planet round. *is* giant floating square there, ain't planet, least terminology wise. Wait!! magic end April ? July maybe? Summer magic maybe? Hmmm making short spell illness marfh seem likely Covid. gastro issues, super tired, fever chills followed runny nose poor appetite. careful worded comment, appreciate heads - great day. Wage slave, grinding get bills paid. !remind 5 months Profits help rich interesting. response 'rona, US enough tank economy, enough actually stop spread virus. Living hell earth. room inn baby jesus try next one now? tired winning yet? completely back normal, it'd sure pretty close every single person proper mask on. Use algorithm already late, impact infections much hard lockdown locked least 2 weeks growth based today's cases alone. started sub yesterday. Nobody posted yet joined. 

r/masknameandshame No. Marshall Met Mother. Dudes judge. majority Americans *did not* vote Trump. lost popular vote ~3million votes, FYI. ""There COVID here. terrible, virulent, unseasonable case pneumonia"". Asian neighborhoods NYC hit nearly hard black Hispanic neighborhoods, City data confirms Asian residents lowest rate non-hospitalized isn‚Äôt allowed sub.

Yeah, people literally killing others ""economy""(bribes super PAC's) mean! may burning house, God forbid call mean names.

Go f**k yourself. Stop protecting people. advocating civility way racists start throwing people disagree ghetto. offense average american dumb gets. means nothing. disagree them. majority americans conclude anything really doesnt matter shit lmao went looking, found zero evidence fines NYC. found multiple articles saying fines. Reference please.

Everyone wearing mask selfish prick. skin color income irrelevant. don‚Äôt need education point, especially NYC. don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs don‚Äôt want (see comment selfish prick) reality? much fear losing job unionised well? make sense. 

In UK probably always optional I've never forced join one yet working abroad years everyone place automatically enrolled union money deducted paycheck every month. old slackers paid younger guys old hardworking men pulling weight them. didn‚Äôt choose metric imperial... using imperial ever refuse get times. I‚Äôd rather stuck past like stuck limbo like Canada. wearing masks. General social distancing sanitation well. includes working home whenever possible. Keeping distance strangers possible. allow places open reduced capacity country run ultra-nationalists, policed skinhead Nazis, owned Wall Street. We, people, expendable; course care get sick die. Oh dear confusing Jews chinese???? sure deserve shot racist sure stupidity do. Mounting Evidence: T_D posters room temperature IQ I'm right border Rox MYK Credit credit due, despite totally fucking up, pretty surprised impressed Greg Abbott people first governor willing close stuff cases got high What?

Your sentence implies maintaining social distancing protesting same. think that's meant written.

And trying say think are, equally guilty negligence wilful spread virus, would still disagree. One protest specifically protesting rights wear masks right social distance choose. protesting specifically face measures. Whereas protests often promoting maintaining distance, wearing masks, sharing things, touching face.

They quite different, especially latter protests LITERALLY lives, whole former LITERALLY saying lives lost either fake, would die anyway, matter much freedoms, etc.

Quite, QUITE different I'm shocked pleasantly surprised. Part pushback selective was. wanted ban flights. Others wanted 14 days quarantine.



Honestly 14 days new entry quarantine would saved many people much grief. Swedes **cannot** go Norway. That's point: **the Norwegian border closed Swedes**. 

Norwegians always able go part Sweden requirement quarantine upon return. That's new. ashamed yourself! people died virus ww1 selfish hick flyover state! Freedom overrated! hail state wise leaders never wrong anything ever!- Ignorance hubris two things best. Damn, would told wear masks avoid social gatherings. Wonder could go wrong putting closed, pressurized air tight hundred people hours almost zero respect basic security measures avoid spreading virus...

I mean, many times seen virus spread people crowds? THANK I've always figured herd immunity argument flawed ever put finger Funny ‚Äúpolls‚Äù work. 

I‚Äôve never asked. don‚Äôt think moving quickly. imagine many ppl agree weren‚Äôt polled. people wanted freeze rent, guarantee unemployment insurance, regular stimulus. suppose worst one would one cases per day. would rather hit car going 40 mph speeding slightly time impact 10mph speeding lot? surprise one bit...... mess; feel sorry business owners hope they‚Äôre provided support. point opening early you‚Äôre going close again? Let warning states still haven‚Äôt gotten message. Good thing US many guns!  would cut administrative costs significantly would wind paying back taxes anyway. 

It's easier send everyone money hire people review ~360million citizens. 

It worked way stimulus. Maybe trigger words encountered. Fuck, think earlier. tell people they'll hop board could look super cool. think mean ""slaving away"" survive, living check check less, working multiple jobs.

Of course, work ass making good money, (usually) doesnt get immediately put bills, survival, necessary things sustain life family.
Of course saying everyone *good* well-paying job.

I'm trying help clarify thought trying say.

Have good day. :) Nah, grew angsty, attention seeking teenage phase long ago. I'm also attention seeking, emotionally stunted adult either, keep edge yourself. ‚ÄúAirtight‚Äù I'm excusing administrations response, I'm even American. I'm saying country benefited whole coronavirus pandemic China. treat people like animals, lock up, continue manufacturing rest world. sure came condescending response, really relevant comment about. bat time, bat channel. Coronavirus included mostly talking collective clusterfuck. know? Like shit sandwich coronavirus would like cheese. hey. resemble remark!


this places seems attract strange ones world. Hahaha reply classic. honestly problem flair Europe Good News. think regional flairs important tbh, want filter much US content Actually blaming Bush Obama. single piece COVID-19 coming China Russia would say reliable trustworthy. 

With cities China size are, basically zero chance ""Only"" 80,000 cases, new cases weeks. Unless every single citizen quarantined houses 2 weeks, one breaking quarantine transmission one person another. possible. well state locked hard March 20 too. Stay home expect grocery shopping going walks. Thats it. stayed May 26. still continued rack new cases 1000s. say maybe people complying (and sure happing particular neighborhoods) live suburb 100% compliance-to extent got 'scolded' wearing mask walking completely alone outside (people would literally look windows see car way grocery store) get SM rant it. Every home yard sign reading STAY HOME KEEP OTHERS SAFE. medium sized town (about 100k) still seen 777 cases-and 40 care homes. Im honestly baffled. also largely affluent town people able WFH. people staying home yet since March 14 (when first case identified) new cases every day. wage slave, get paid enough survive. good call, I‚Äôm happy people still think way do. Get boonies nice city real leaders.  plenty people protesting lockdown exactly reason. certain point going able convince them. I'm Alabama, couple friends absolutely refuse wear mask. I've tried best, every governor, every scientist, Nick Saban, everyone said wear mask except President. Nothing nothing convince wear mask. willfully ignore amount evidence try hard enough. I've even told him, getting college football (it's big big deal Alabama) numbers get better. ""The Swedes"". figured Norway allowed people go Gotland, Denmark allowed people go Sweden? ""The Norwegians"" ""The Danes"". small part populations want to, case small part Swedes think able go Denmark discrimination. ""The Swedes"" exactly find sane people. ironic considering Xenophobic comment comes as. start saying ""The Americans"" hate Sweden? governor husband Marcey Ducey Married Children, still think chance. Wanna know got tear drops? **not** fully closed, people travel need follow 10 day quarantine return. Texas, places. I'm glad he's listening. I'm surprised, frankly. Thurston. sheriff Lewis county (our sheriff's twin brother) went protest told people wearing masks ""don't sheep"". gets really conservative really fast get city. hard make case people shun someone getting haircut accuse spreading death plague people praise thousands people smashed streets protests saying ""wear mask, ok"".

I mean get nuances, none reaction surprise. So, one unemployed college grads next group college grads comes year now? sure feels like matter, America's initial response block China pat back job well done.


People go places. fly now. people think going happen??? Moeti noted, Congo still Ebola outbreak, different place; diseases also menacing population.

‚ÄúThe new Ebola outbreak Mbandaka, Equateur province, DRC; along measles outbreaks Central African Republic, Chad, DRC well, South Sudan countries; increase malaria countries Southern Africa compared last year; reminders need ensure continuity essential health services life-threatening conditions time fighting Covid-19,"" said Moeti. don‚Äôt think anyone does. aren‚Äôt long term enough this. experience corporate chain stores (e.g. Costco, Lucky, Walgreens, Safeway/Albertsons) much small businesses/mom-n-pop shops. 


Large stores afford turn away customers put Karens then. Small operations - much. wonder happened last weeks could caused rise cases?  did.

Because even April's response awful.

It's weird Congress run bunch people play hardball existential threats like climate change COVID-19.

Grandpa, virus care WW2. afraid. going stand down. could please goddam job address thing. order includes following:  bars similar establishments receive 51% gross receipts sale alcoholic beverages required close 12:00 PM today. businesses may remain open delivery take-out, including alcoholic beverages, authorized Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission.¬†  Restaurants may remain open dine-in service, capacity exceed 50% total listed indoor occupancy, beginning Monday, June 29, 2020.  Rafting tubing businesses must close.  Outdoor gatherings 100 people must approved local governments, certain exceptions.

Finally, measures taken. see kind measures coming days, situation worsens. too, greetings Finland. They're threatening whole Europe. [Actually, didn‚Äôt make much impact. No, ONE hospital system (TMC) ran REGULAR ICU beds. It‚Äôs warning. already temporarily doubled capacity prepare covid.

They expect truly run week.

Keeping mind many millions live Houston area, fast cases rising, we‚Äôre talking couple thousand ICU beds. TX reporting ICU filling fast, near capacity, hope plan 10-15 days numbers tripled, given average age ppl living FL heavily relay tourists, ole Ron FL going keep lying day day, FL end worse states, see hitting NY level numbers within 2 months. long going last? cases soaring, deaths side on

But scientifically accurate side seeks protect people spread deadly virus. 

And side ignores experts, outright denying contradicting asinine conspiracy fiction.

It matters side on. political is, gradient response crisis vast, willful deception ignorance abound.

This nexus failures education, media standards regulations, medical systems, governance. 

Thousands, millions die needlessly entire generation medical workers PTSD, survive. 

The ""both sides"" narrative gives false equivalency ideas merit. People want go back slaves. They‚Äôre basically drones search feelings, know true? fat grandma grandma own. Must someone‚Äôs great great grandma üëµ oh no, they're learning... amazing stuff thank you! true. Americans responsible spike. great. However, ever stopped working, I've got plenty stuff keep busy.

I went, however, friend put minor toothache lockdown scared go. missing tooth two visits get new one. Finally someone got sarcasm post.
Makes think people getting paid upvote narrative fools follow. be. zombie apocalypse. People understand would come either places eventually.

Since banned travel China, virus found alternate route Italy NY rest US.

If banned travel Europe, would eventually traveled China California rest US.  We‚Äôd probably ready reopen soon idiots would listen Lol Exponential growth math. South. aren‚Äôt affected math. How‚Äôs Elon racist? He‚Äôs weird dude, I‚Äôve never heard racist. It‚Äôs either thing either.  rise CA may we‚Äôll party protests

Texas Arizona clearly seeing states reopened explosion cases think happen states cautious begin reopen? live Philly area PA done great job getting cases however retail stores open week indoor restaurant eating, bars, gyms, etc open think horrible idea giving examples states. 

The one hope far people wear masks see people starting relax go green phase can‚Äôt wear masks eating restaurants, drinking bars gym they‚Äôve told things ok they‚Äôll think won‚Äôt wear masks much. would horrible end ruining progress we‚Äôve made past months. Yep, ideally what's going get less people killed. case wearing masks public. hard, difficult.

Wearing mask ever political statement. That‚Äôs problem future you‚Äôre worried current though.

Must cOnsPiRacY, right?
 someone gets car accident dies due injuries sustained car accident, autopsy performed COVID found system, count COVID death
 
I think depends situation. heart attack stroke driving causes get fatal accident heart attack stroke killed own, really killed me? think might conversation worth having. heart attack stroke, would alive, exactly clear cut thing. information here, something heard Steven Crowder try get someone change mind about?
 
Even if
 hospitals pressured add COVID causes death due increase funding
 
It mean
 created wildly inaccurate death counts due COVID
 
That's conclusion logically reach given data. couple isolated examples really mean anything.
 
Do proof that? Because, again, seems like experts saying opposite, seems pretty much Fox news anchors like agreeing you. that?
 
This idea mostly based greedy for-profit hospitals doctors are, right? see higher rates death countries, then?
 
Particularly, somewhere like UK? national healthcare system. test per capita. deaths per capita higher death rate?
 
Is global conspiracy?
 
Do wear mask public? think real threat, think entire fucking world shut big deal? time high testing. 39k positives 637k tests 6.11% positive. used close 20%...

In May would get 28+k 300k tests. testing amount nationwide it'd 60k positives given day. assume increased testing 600k May *wouldn't* find additional 10k cases assume surge was.


Hospitalizations going many places, many places seeing drops cases positive rates. Saying surge real everywhere absurd. surge northeast. stand corrected. thought #50. Googling bit, depends who's ranking, sometimes put Louisiana behind us well.

I'm sure better New Mexico, Mississippi Louisiana gives us bragging rights, though.

And sadly could avoided people shit heads. Yeah. Looking page ideas would easily addressed reasoned dialogue. lots little misunderstandings actually pretty common. follows through. Nothing she‚Äôs saying especially crazy talked people share beliefs fact everything they‚Äôre saying even directly disproven there‚Äôs value they‚Äôre saying well challenging assumptions. 

For instance there‚Äôs really way prove outside people really dying covid-19. don‚Äôt believe virus it‚Äôs deadly it‚Äôs easy discount evidence like excess deaths hospitalization. especially true given difficulty finding information accessible way excess death particular. take underlying assumptions beliefs educate fill gaps there‚Äôs uncertainty find later that, person does, adapted new information reassessed things. evidence like excess deaths convincing. censored instead accomplish making feel defensive. OK Karen. Sounds like job...for Federal. Government. think used word stipulation correctly. Also Reopen, like many businesses did, people assume quarantine entirely. Like, whole reason many people home there's nothing do. people stopped wearing masks local bars, restaurants, clubs opened up. hand sanitizer, capacity. 

So kinda treat morons like children start saying ""No can't go dangerous"" enforce mask policy much possible extent needs stigma mask means threat.

This includes president following see masks symbol disapproval. Well, point be, bad job wear them. Case 2 would exist without case 1. needs even stricter fines!

Finally, saying ""I got voted for..."" basically reddit version ""I told so"" think know people feel that. I'm IE (Riverside). completely depends business. enforcing rules strictly...but yeah. PLENTY places still mask free majority - is, people either mask wearing chin, IMO count. pretty startling. Grocery stores pretty good though it.

Case 1, poison cheese. Case 2, eat cheese knowing poisonous. could've chosen eat cheese. Thus, fault ate cheese. Case 1 responsible outcome Case 2.

Came say thing, ""good luck finding nurses physicians work places."" reading study penn state says number flu like illnesses weren‚Äôt attributed covid ridiculously higher earlier year, much transmission rate could much 80% higher initially thought. asymptotic differently symptomatic cases combined lack testing thrown big curve ball many cases actually are/have been.

I 100% could wrong. don‚Äôt mean state fact, could definitely see case. me, video kids sandbox Refusing wear mask purely stupid. wanted economy, fucktards would everything could operate safely. Go crawl back rock. don‚Äòt believe stats germany would interesting way look it. alabama would near top proportionately true won‚Äôt work long every hospital completely full soon. live area that‚Äôs almost usual. police ever bother ticket there, it‚Äôs bunch rich people sports cars driving winded roads. one person know got ticket said didn‚Äôt realize cop chasing going much faster, cop didn‚Äôt know turns like everyone lives does. Mind you, 40-60 year olds, teenagers driving cars daddy bought usually go fast. going depend specific circumstances (how vulnerable family members? option staying put days? place testing available?) get tested wait days moving, absolutely might well. not, proceed though positive, wear mask, stay away family members much can, etc. would still try get tested though, better know wonder.  high death rate vents necessarily indicate venting causing deaths.

People covid hospital likely die people covid home... sicker ones go hospital. similarly receiving O2 ultimately intubation.

This challenge observational data.

Similarly issues volume status, first issues overloaded patients correcting lot issues aki hypotension.

As remark physician vs hospital... certainly regional medical ""culture"" ""norms"", patients generally MRP (most responsible physician) relatively long periods time (a week often), outside night hours someone else cover. allows consistency management plan. hospital tell can't intubate patient, make policy guidance statements regarding resources data.

Currently trying, most, limit intubation. line practice prior covid. Unfortunately due PPE shortages high levels fear, non invasive techniques generate viral aerosol avoided time (ex. Bipap high flow nasal cannula)... We‚Äôll remember next time vote. hasnt reported media? knows people don‚Äôt want wear masks he‚Äôll lose support tried tell people wear them. he‚Äôll take 50% workforce essential workers only. There's pollution people coming Indy 500 Indycars themselves. Nothing. reference point. it‚Äôs still long time. want know takes long. 

Why don‚Äôt (voluntarily, course) grab say, thousand people hospitalized virus 6 months ago, (again, voluntarily) expose SARS-CoV-2? 95% (random number pulled ass) fight without showing symptoms mild ones, one would think reliable protection would last year, wouldn‚Äôt it? 6 months seems long enough work. 

I understand that‚Äôs huge safety risk, times emergency, info learn would used greater good. Worst case scenario, learn immunity isn‚Äôt thing vaccine research waste time; start focusing ways managing virus. sooner learn something like that, better. would nice future economic/business model/system puts people‚Äôs lives first profits. isn‚Äôt example currently living with, don‚Äôt know is... .26 cfr stupid acknowledge 5? means lost woods nobody looking you. Rate we're going, hope kids 100 years read. don‚Äôt think number force hand. also think numbers steadily climbing people going stop going eat stop shopping stores unnecessary items much. still good number people never wear face mask never believe serious, matter many die think numbers rising force lot people stay home. Sound right Ron DeDouchebag. responsibility help may infected telling them. behavior sociopathic protests. always looks like slob  Ah yes, let's go back hiding put people back work. Sorry luck, restauranteurs barkeeps. possible Covid also brain Save bit anger sh\*t really hits fan. think happen people start running money, running food, work months, getting sick losing loved one? add fact currently tension police force local communities states. i'm saying check calendar. mark state opened, mark protests, look spikes. whatever opening spike comes first, whatever protest spike comes next. key events, mark too. mark 4th july parades big ones match 1st peak 1st event, 2nd peak 2nd event, etc Im close enough downtown hear gets loud, luckily thick things. I‚Äôm denier anyone else know denier. said cases going due testing, never said rise symptomatic people. also mentioned protective equipment never said word mask. must told say mask, even Dr. Birx Dr. Fauci say word mask. Moon spells cover And? point is, reopened and, omg surprise, confirmed cases skyrocketing.

Next you‚Äôll counter ‚Äúoh there‚Äôs testing‚Äù, someone explain positive test result rates going rather happening testing ‚Äúgetting better‚Äù.

Next everyone gives exercising willful ignorance refuse understand logic facts.

Did miss step? everyone that's sure, lot ignorant people without empathy social media, NYer told fuck themselves. I've often pondered myself. Australia hoarding TP 30 positives, I'm Virginia told ready phase 3 cases sit steady ~500 day. mean, really putting situation vacuum assuming else equal comparing 1929 2020. make concessions based idea capabilities free market different essentially untouchable regulation versus environment 1929. flatter yourself. There's answer people think wearing gloves important. Bruh democracy fucked already current administration, voter suppression, polling stations working machines enough machines making hard fuck people vote. Shits fucked Finally ready combat it.  Yes tested everyone NBA. tested every person US 5.2% positive would 16 million active infections. could predicted this? think rock could Haha. Yeah. Humble kill them. Texas here. Stuck disaster caring people huge number idiots. us everything isolate sake safety others. Oh don‚Äôt worry. book thump says immune...or it‚Äôs conspiracy...or idk. can‚Äôt follow lack logic. knows, he‚Äôd rather Economy bounce back time election. Remember politcal parties serve corporations people it‚Äôs surprising. That's nonsense. nation appalled happened New York City.  Cough...bullshit...cough. Ladies gentlemen class idiot please give warm welcome stage Yeah that's even dangerous single mention protests? Seems pretty clearly correlated. reason nightmare deadly. 

But yea, talk virus mutating less deadly, hypothesis wishful thinking. None proven true far. Also, hospitalized patients 4 times less likely die, get breakdown demographics/conditions? know nursing homes elderly got hammered initially... we're careful protecting make smaller portion hospitalized patients- boom, hospital patients whole less likely die. 

Basically, people less likely die hospitalized may tell us absolutely nothing virus mutation... shit, mutate worse, demographic changes treatments improve (like have), could still observe people less likely die. think people think majority us get it

Agree governor minion trump. Total douche. it‚Äôs job educate unwilling ignorant renting holiday home many many Danish kroners German tourists. rates crazy year. Yup, best thing economy get virus low levels people actually feel safe confident go participate economy, knew? bad cause billionaires lose million :( That's simply CAN'T it. poor billionaires bit less wealthy :( primary purpose mask protect you, protect others you. important *everyone* wear them. Chicago largest protests nation cases rising (yet). I‚Äôm sorry made crack fuck Let's pretend moment sincerely believed says believed - climate change problem, need better vaccines. make sense invest businesses philanthropy? seems facially obvious hard see perspective totally absurd. really trying understand, though. I‚Äôm going kids go school respiratory therapy

Comes home Christmas, announces changed major Art History. Learning concept versus first hand experience said concept definitely gives perspective, yes. speech net benefits; inflame conspiracy theorists more. Meanwhile side causeway........ I‚Äôm glad bailed shitty airline corporations multiple times years..... Good see schools preparing reopen. Means parents kids able return work without find expensive unreliable child care. company big issue April, many production workers able use regular day care schools make sure kids cared for. I‚Äôm glad company able put policy place give people days forgiven attendance policy, also pay 2/3 normal rate days missed could verify related covid shut down. know everyone able available it‚Äôll weight many working parents minds children back school come fall. Positive thinking! 5% nba tested positive since league mandated testing last Tuesday.

Edit Yeah that‚Äôs novel pathogens work. lay low while, feels absurd, really waiting prime conditions pop like uselessly telling people stay home without anything facilitate that, even workers risk live at-risk person. cloth mask make claim, including one made. never need cloth masks like ones we're using there's little way certifications hard data. data suggests cloth masks far better keeping virus keeping out, *but* still makes invaluable. Every rich country (France, US, Germany, Spain...) MUST Didier Raoult do, poor not-developed countries everyone healed. Could‚Äôve happened anyone/s What, lying. think argument would improper correct thing based best practice time. Medicine dynamic field always changing i.e. drugs found less effective thought drugs found dangerous thought. New procedures replace old procedures.

We looked things worked didn‚Äôt work. That‚Äôs entire point post treatment regimens much better now. learned best way deliver supplemental oxygen patient, learned drugs help outcomes. Unfortunately, can‚Äôt change outcome past illnesses. Yes, live extreme hot dry climate. people indoors air conditioning time. Well, done. figured out. treat. family professionals resources made work. tell gonna scale risk kids behind started? it‚Äôs great idea bunch people crowded around table football table, shouting whooping, without wearing masks...

Has guy grasped yet virus spreads? China way ""developing world"" country. weeks November remember lot people sick Sixteen PLAYERS tested positive...what support staff? 0% white, male, visibly tattooed Huntington Beach shoppers wear masks scientific survey two bike shops yesterday afternoon. 8 dudes, 1 mask. business fined individual. live Tampa suburbs. time reopening recording ~20 cases per day less 2% positive sustained level two weeks. 

I go Sheriff‚Äôs office yesterday background check job UPS fax over. Sheriff strict, none stores seem care one walking around masks. town looks exactly way back February. 

Boca *was* hit hard originally excluded phase one numbers decreased. Yep, probably surprise nobody given system culture handling pandemic...  agree.

That said, fuck conspiracy dorks. pre-emptive step based outbreak yakima county ensure see similar resurgence elsewhere.  Yeah, he's always credited wife driving force behind much latter philanthropic efforts.

Hard forgive ""Microsoft Bob"" tho :) Yeah totally get guys saying agree. Sorry hear that. exactly expecting.  They‚Äôll try. opened every business hard close hospital. following them, houston texas close 50% three weeks ago moved progressively 100% New York sending virus Florida long Covid-19 existed. little late I'm fan Steak Shake. Politics? Yeah. everything else. Healthcare comes mind. nearly enough preventative. one wants go seek care idea bill even ""good"" insurance use effective measures like mandatory masks, social distancing, contact tracing screw around watch infection count increase dramatically? 1/3 US obese, it‚Äôs definitely 1 20 here, probably like 10 20 Think handle virus know theyre thing global warming, want pretend like happening. thing slower. expect.... idiotic leaders... Hopefully able get stupid Trump office Nov put people believe science least try something different 2.5 weeks Disney! Trump Bolsonaro go two biggest failures ‚Äúleaders‚Äù history respective countries.  They're broke. Can‚Äôt see?

It makes perfect sense 

Expressed dollars cents 

According Trump Pence got question, part icu reserved covid patients whoever needs it? Florida larger amount older adults living NY, whether nursing homes not. I‚Äôm sick blame game nursing homes deaths. It‚Äôs tragedy, yes. last time checked, never lived pandemic like this. NY first state try figure do. got nursing home strategy wrong. yes, Florida better make mistakes nursing homes. aren‚Äôt following New York‚Äôs proven successful strategies, knows. Texas Florida banned alcohol sales bars Texas scaling back opening restaurants. 

Even conservative states actively enforcing policy, edge-lord. can't tell number times I've called sheep last days. Usually pointing infection rates spiking across country. person usually goes unhinged rant gets banned sub. 

It possible Covid also brain disorder? local day camp requiring masks workers kids. didnt make sense me. Kids understand wearing masks, foreign concept them. Christian Mother astounded believe virus cannot see Government agenda calls ""plan-demic."" real cannot see irony tries convince God's existence evening. iPhone don‚Äôt see anything like phone. That's sad... opinion. People need adjust reality. happiness function watching sports find new hobby productive learn something vs wasting life watching TV. July 18th 2 weeks 4th. link actual study? articles news completely fucking useless mention age stratification anything. Silly boy, Trix kids! fact think countries testing level scary, dumb? cases confirmed test more... 2202 beds SE Texas Region 2018 use (as reporting 06/25). 31% 2018 Covid. 


They required law certain percentage total also available (regular rooms convert) surge capacity. Nowhere address staffing additional beds. Doesn‚Äôt help many California law enforcement agencies say won‚Äôt enforce mask rule. Northern California going regret choices someday pleasantly surprised recent polling showed majority Jacksonville. Maybe there's hope city. vaccination, rushed vaccine.  job police protect private property rich. dont obligation protect anyone, supreme court already made clear. Canada 2 month full lock down, SLOW re-opening READY (when scientists/doctors said ready) far better use masks USA (still great, far better).

Check numbers. We're fine. need actually make real progress re-opening, effectively test trace. can't test trace 40,000+ new cases per day... COVID lives ideals treating everyone equally. probably already have. reason alarm virus. contagious ever show symptoms everyone mom time stuff like normal then? already ugly. Good luck enforcing it. nba season cute idea lasted. No.  saying Sweden like cheese filled rat poison? Wow, that's really quite harsh you. accuse cruel. 

What Sweden like brother share house can't kick out. responsibility help rest family things like making whole house dangerous deliberately letting infection spread room. rest relatives avoid brother? Yes course. ultimately responsibility rests *allowing* happen clearly avoidable. [this meme sums Everyone else avoided it. hope gets better soon, tbh stay room take responsibility mess made. 

But first place, responsibility going along successful plan rest family devised turn whole house plague colony. They'll probably close, spike California postponed opening Disneyland Governor DeSantis want seen issuing mask order, want seen closing businesses.  Halsey Beshears dirty deed him. (Half it, least.)

Either that, Beshears team player, fired end day. civil servants required take oath. mean get interpret Constitution, that's job federal courts. oath confers rights whatsoever. guess hear there. think cat's bag one. Best luck yours. former data scientist Florida fired refused falsify numbers. literally examine data. Or, continue operate baseless claims. **will** disastrous consequences

There, fixed you. resource detailing far behind states testing results? son Texas tested today. doctor said results could take 2-7 days. said today, getting results tests performed last Thursday (6 days ago). 

Texas experiencing record number cases right now. curious many tests waiting processed. I‚Äôm also curious know specific percent tests positive, could apply percent total cases waiting processed get idea bad it‚Äôs going get....not bad enough already. Back vacation...? It‚Äôs like guy came back work taking 2 month vacation everyone dying workload. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt 100 percent know going happen.‚Äù

How many examples idiot need? Hello? China, Italy!

And examples deal it, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, etc.

He either lied statement complete total idiot! ""evil"".

If doctors ""fucked up"" legit concern. ridiculous people brush off. 

Because see least 1 BIG fuckup. Maybe 2.

The policy keep infected seniors homes obviously, objectively, ""bad"". removing infected seniors long term care facilities many seniors infected.

The reason policy change ""bureaucracy"". policy led deaths many many many people *should never infected* totally avoidable.

So that's one fuckup.

And intubation situation. seems like ""bad policy"" responsible unneccesary deaths.

I mean .. policy decisions result death, right? Dont think good look things? done fucked up. also lockdown going beaches masks on... first time 2020 glad live NY Unmasked activities close. 

Nah People understood fine spring. problem president half media lying since then. Church cinema banned. zoom church watch Netflix now.  Hah, find funny always wait train. Call phobia guess, I'm way crossing streets.  Willfully ignorant morons, that's who. :( mask offer small amount protection user? Sure.

It‚Äôs small. One NIH study homemade mask half protection surgical mask. trivial amount, considering surgical mask considered good enough PPE health care workers outside aerosolized ventilator environments. One hour homemade mask would thus comparable 2 hours surgical, HCW shift mask half day. False $1000 fine go business without mask Look Lenka Koloma's Facebook. fruitcake put together.

Also, relatively US.

[NYS (a major state locked down) Unemployment Rate -

Not huge difference except NYS NYC dropping COVID numbers cautiously moving next phase reopening bump employment Texas huge setback increase unemployment. good man. Reddit done. ‚ÄúPeople‚Äù paid coerced, scan threads find comments contrary narrative reddit wants. fools misinformed position jump in. Reddit media machine. I‚Äôm embarrassed it.

It‚Äôs hard Florida Man! don‚Äôt like probably guy‚Äôs beliefs, least hasn‚Äôt suggested stop testing use prayer instead actual treatment. publicly anyway... probably virus kill matter facemasks.

Again..never answered actually arguing against. 

We're saying serious. We're saying procedures. basically makes us far goes. Pence 10 days ago: guy. 

The biggest surge LA theory hold. Guess LA v\*tes. say d\* word bot take post. takes different President make sure shit happen barking wrong tree dude/ma'am. context, less correct. also math proof. Less adjective, verb. see would confusing non native speaker. Testing 2x 3x case rates obvious exponential, means real case growth compensate testing differential maybe two weeks (tops). Don‚Äôt get complacent. ""Assuming incubation period distribution mean 5.2 days separate study early COVID-19 inferred **infectiousness started 2.3 days** (95% CI, 0.8‚Äì3.0 days) symptom onset peaked 0.7 days (95% CI, ‚àí0.2‚Äì2.0 days) symptom onset (Fig. estimated proportion presymptomatic transmission (area curve) 44% (95% CI, 25‚Äì69%). **Infectiousness estimated decline quickly within 7 days**.

BoTh SiDeS PoInT! problem Floridans going try run away bring virus back New England. NY states right thing requiring quarantine need much stricter That‚Äôs awesome! Keep good work.

However, Gates next nothing - stepped away Microsoft quite time that, really involved days.

I'm baffled ID2020 actually thing anyone right mind would see anything good it. see vision future dystopia. mean, pulling numbers ass. Density, weather, mask wearing, social distancing matter. Ridiculous say need full lock 0.8 0.9...especially many cities lower R0 without full lockdowns. Ahh, like never left March right shade defense Haha yeah know broken. Enormous difference broken ankle sprain Yup, hundred percent. certainly poured gasoline fire. That‚Äôs cap. Walmart yesterday I‚Äôd say best 50% people saw wearing masks Another poll üòÇüòÇüòÇ assure majority Americans support re-opening much true. Polls joke.

Otherwise, yes, though possibility virus accumulating mussels infecting marine mammals also concerning. trained entirely Skype. hold lot meetings like unless data can't convince less efficient. Instead people lagging conference room technology issues like describing, seems like everyone gotten comfortable remote setups. Instead adhere strange social distance guidelines best social distancing keep us home. 

I really like company far one decision can't wrap head around. I'm convinced leasing issue something gung ho getting us back office. We're also company building this. agree. crazy opening schools large offices etc. already know large gatherings indoors extended lengths time terrible virus.

It‚Äôs statement warning! say book non-full flight choose board find it‚Äôs packed. Shameless! fact dont think thats hostile says lot lmao  So, asshole? Yeah. Cities can't impose heavier restrictions state does. Houston probably would mandated masks everyone (not businesses), re-opened early Texas tied hands re-opening whole state early blame questioning it? lowered projected death totals multiple orders magnitude. like weatherman says going get 2.2 feet snow end 3 inches added, no, think so?  Well context, believe hospitals tend operate 70 80% capacity. partially concerning, matter week covid patients need 20%, could happen month, happens patients hospitals fill ones.

It's true treatment covid super deadly. understand it, substantially deadly contagious flu, hospital system, despite possibly best world, cannot handle surge happen exponential virus exposure. 

If hospital capacity exceeded many people die covid unnecessarily, people need treatment literally anything else, hospitals full, health practitioners overworked, general supplies limited. inarguable spending tax policy priorities parties favor corporations one side other. submission removed because

I‚Äôm saying time reopening, things look like this. cases located south Florida counties weren‚Äôt allowed open. 

We never moved phase two, also blame people stopped caring. Idk live Florida not, even mask requirements ignored. one cares. dramatic increase *not* situation time reopening, happened *since* then. logic, 30-45 year olds hospitalized. count total infections calculation mortality rate hospitalized. Well autopilot mode, change lane turn settings let car decide. turn signals making changes appropriately. think car roads today automatically signals steering wheel turned whatever direction  announcement comes Friday Florida coronavirus cases continue climb. Florida reported nearly 9,000 new cases shatters previous single-day record. Imo punishment house arrest pandemic over. Make $500 fine pay ankle tracker effective vaccine mutating like banshee. 250+ strains identified 1000+ expected end summer. best bet eradication. continue like slow burn spreading endlessly dramatic measures taken BUT, one major difference

There another huge difference.

When NY peaking, limited testing. People getting tested hospitalized older-at-risk people. Young people mild case couldnt get test. 

I predict peak NY like 20-25k cases day today type level testing. 

FL likely finding lot mild cases 9k batch NY finding started lack understanding science. many people understand basics biology, chemistry, physics. know computer works, know human body works, even basic level. people understanding possible given current technological achievement scientific knowledge.


If know anything works, believe cell phone towers cause virus, active tracking device implanted via syringe disguised vaccine? long someone trust tells you, believe know enough think ""that make sense"". 

This even (or maybe especially) less academically inclined citizens need taught fundamentals various scientific fields school. world, ANC would seized family's property deal jackass' influence. lol @ thinking law enforcement meant protect anyone I'm gonna say contamination testing. I'd like see genomic study sample vs currently circulating virus. Seems unlikely me. fucken stayed lock like rest us. 

Now going shut time, citizens won‚Äôt federal safety net expires July. absolute right send patients hospitals, hospitals still overrun. girlfriend works smaller hospital Colorado peak sending patients bigger hospitals. Even sending patients, ICU hospital still two people single room worst. LA hospital? hope doesn‚Äôt, isn‚Äôt gonna pay shit, are. Taxpayers will. opinion matters topic, firmly believe governors sacrifice well population votes/a better economy prosecuted. They're going forced backtrack anyways. Italy wake call Europe. Yeah high chance someone get infected ""bubble"". Tell grieving family guy actually get murdered cold blood.  realized typed silly say one complains. meant wearing masks stores feels standard opposed places seems 50/50 best discouraged worst. work retail service, sure lot see. Maybe we're already dealing reinfections? Also, peer-reviewed yet, I'm gonna hold onto point.  long open? feel horrible business owners bars probably one worse place pandemic. lots places go vacation. little, late. kids, like said. too. Many people don‚Äôt. you‚Äôve never around young kids referring 20 months doesn‚Äôt mean anything don‚Äôt experience having/being around 20 month old. 15% reliant 30% give opinion Link? mean trust? Someone dedicated life medicine? politicians ? appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* We‚Äôre inching towards full blown crisis. Well ""doomers"" screaming keep everything closed year. However act like normal human wearing mask, washing hands, using slim amount common sense, would ok. Unfortunately revealed/confirmed large population special kind stupid. Anyone thinking political hoax somehow managed get whole world play along it, beyond stupid. doesn‚Äôt make sense. exploding everywhere then? It‚Äôs time pick couple essential jobs move garage.

Remember vote ... asanine governor might kill parents. Trump needs vaccine. Don‚Äôt get wrong, investment good, worry rushing things.

The political gain pushing vaccine election substantial. true arent numbers going down? Every study still points heat effect pack crowded bars kind negates hot outside. cooler temperatures virus survives longer air surfaces means chance exposure. Closed windows doors keep cold means less ventilation outside allows virus build up. two things also part meat packing problem - basically people working sealed refrigerators allowing viral load pile workers cannot avoid exposed. system blowing air we‚Äôd see problem areas forced hot air heat systems.  Thank god weekend here! ain‚Äôt heroes. country forcibly nominated martyrs Yep. really wish waste energy **still** pushing bare minimum wearing masks, social distancing feasible, etc. fucking are.

And northeast appears bright spot, anecdotal evidence, observations, show people mostly stopped wearing masks. People clustered together waiting get somewhere. on.

The case rate *is* low am. hope stays way we've let guard completely far see. I‚Äôm binging Great British Bake-off. helps. like left wing media celebrities kept pushing BLM, caused millions people congregate protest pandemic. Basically, he's whatever interests. Like people life. Restaurants bars breeding ground this. stinks risking life go one. 

I see bars restaurants packed capacity here. friends dining since day restaurants open.

No thanks. I'll cook. account that. hope true. intelligent trying use vast fortune help world, like current government. Also constantly lying probably helps.  virus keeps getting weirder weirder man  I'm eagerly awaiting us finish gas leak presidency.  cancelled weeks/months ago Yeah states increasing yellow orange geographically covers much US aside NE. everywhere. yes, world collectively nothing worry middle WW1 Sadly point already late. Hospitals see big surge incoming cases...

Glad action taken though. Yet shows control virus take seriously instead, demonstrated times countries took seriously. Yes shut grocery stores, food parcel delivery services, banking, auto, telecommunications too. shut roads place automated checkpoints ensure essential travel. revert subsistence lifestyle mandate absolute quarantine nearly everyone least six months. may get handle virus.

10 Cloverfield Lane goal. Checking southern IN, 10% wear mask, 40% mock wearing mask. foresee slew ""Karen"" related videos weeks come. ü§™ officially counting people sorting skin color. Still baffles German. mean point? never stated ""race"" ""skin color"" document life.
Name, date place birth, residency nationality thats New testing strategy: testing = virus sad LMFAO March '19? Even seems bit early. way it'd go unnoticed nearly year contagious now. feel like response would different federal government would shit together it. hospitals running beds shits getting worse. It‚Äôs Black Plague sure, animal person diseases continue long cohabit animals planet. fact can‚Äôt handle low death rate pandemic means don‚Äôt fair well next Black Plague happen. Thank Florida stupid. Uh, single indication yet. I'm alluding unavoidable rise cases moving incubation stage. course safety measures warranted appreciated. thing really matters wins. believe Dr. Jo savior change people's minds, let's get elected another 4 years. People need change other's minds this. something leave politicians inform people. need inform other, neighbors physical digital. country setup going change.

2/3 people vote, 2/3 showed vote every next election sub-set people would control gets elected....YOU HEAR NON-VOTERS MAKE UO MAJORITY, BAND TOGETHER CHANGE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT. Nah factor say that's reason black Americans higher death rate ignorant Also mention many instances hospitalization got painted broad ‚Äúcovid‚Äù brush stroke even weren‚Äôt exactly covid government providing incentives per covid patient treated. conspiracy theory nut something read regarding total number reported cases. think initial opening bad. Maybe week early, enforced distancing guidelines, required masks, stopped proceeding reopening cases increased, nearly bad N = 579 they‚Äôre trying generalize entire nation hundreds millions people. Lol. Couldn‚Äôt least taken thousand? Florida Flu nice ring. Texan Flu could work. could say American Flu. American Virus? Lots options here. Midwestern states drive 12-16 hours get nearby beach. 

Florida nicer beaches compared south Carolina/Virgina beach..and 2-3 hour flight Midwest airports. article useless, completely ignores time component. states seeing first upswing now. situation approaching Italy/New York type crisis level. New York (roughly population size Florida) crested around 11,000 per day. Italy (three times population Florida) crested around 6,500 per day.

BUT, one major difference... state fully open business many people basically ignoring it. that, shrink gone.

Well ... long endemic population, never re-introduced. anything like cold (a coronavirus) flu, probably disappear. enough people become immune due previous infections (or die)

This likely happen, happened areas hard hit early (the Northeast, Italy etc). antibody testing, testing asymptomatic people, shown case counts underestimated least factor 10 since March, means significant fraction people infected. Probably enough start affecting R. many people contributing spread inane idea necessary public health measures considered optional

We many people contributing spread strategy muddled throughout. want eradicate disease, real lockdowns. strategy though, simply flatten curve - reduce R, realize would likely still 1 even measures taken. low enough healthcare capacity overwhelmed enough people became immune finally push 1.

Now people insisting idea eradicate entirely based distancing masks. Which, great, insist people wear real, effective N95/surgical masks greatest extent possible, charade pretend draping dishrag face makes real difference. reality many cases leadership/messaging bungled eradicate based measures alone.

The reality point eradicate disease reaching substantial number infections basically provides herd immunity. simply question quickly reach threshold. Lift restrictions, go faster risk overwhelming treatment. Go slower suffer economic/social consequences longer. think fewer people got sick due quarantine measures? zero sum game. say ""everyone stays home one does."" pretty easy understand less people mingling other, fewer people get sick. Hey come give break. Literally one could predicted resurgence think rest world handle problem? either giving money people directly making mandatory pay employees throughout crisis lockdowns effect.

If really think US way work die possible solution, one call others children. NBA trying finish season. It‚Äôll new season begin thought it‚Äôd good test run see would work wouldn‚Äôt. said, 9,000 new cases trying play at. Bubble not, it‚Äôs concerning. know won‚Äôt back really considered. Communist China, government falsifies numbers oh wait that's USA. Love see brain poisoned idiots mindlessly parrot GATES MAN BAD, VACCINE BAD.

Dumb hell. So... Florida track exceed tomorrow? Hospitals run

Death Toll well national average

They fucked pro wrestling fan I‚Äôd like give AEW shout out. They‚Äôve running shows actual testing wrist bands required showing negative test results enter facility. seems they‚Äôve much responsible wrestlers‚Äô safety. Word WWE simply temperature checks. I‚Äôm proud AEW fan today. Hopefully good luck careful procedure holds. millions trump fans running Walmart filling resuarants show ""they love freedom!"" Lol Nah, I‚Äôm seeing people saying sky green. I‚Äôve seen people saying came France even USA Exactly Russian agent would say. People amazed tell that, week, seen 1 friend person 3 months, made trips outside walks early morning meeting delivery drivers outside.

Just imagine us either unemployed working home that. Heard same, I've heard get paid 30000$ every COVID case report. great doctor USA, msut making millions every day. age well Governor takes head sand someone spilled mojito him, bans drinking Tiki bars. Umm surely blame partially poor leadership end day us wear masks social distance. everything close order right thing? people idiots take CDC grain salt nowadays, viewing people lives aspirations expected risk needless risks taken.... mean cops got new cruisers town medical damn well PPE. to. severity situation increasing, would disastrous consequences would choose something it. 

Yeah, remember listening epidemiologist interviewed back reopenings starting states really seem clear downward trend. said, ""Well, kind academic. going reopen, cases going go up, hospitalizations going increase deaths going increase. Then, choice close things again. fact, time start closing things down, public started locking anyway."" remember sounded matter fact it. And....here are. Yes, true. lower initial dose virus get better chance immune system beating it. like radiation - little OK lot BAD.

This generally good idea sleep different bed going potentially getting infected. Florida place people vacation, what? get it.  issue is, people view binary: Open Close.
It's not.

You open safety measures mask, distancing, cleaning, increase testing tracking backend.

However people think opening going back pre-covid. thinking reopening till vaccine out.

Many options reopen, choose options back square one. let millions go without masks zero restrictions. fact bar low frighteningly sad. Wow.

5 days ago someone asked people thought FL would hit 10k. guessed 21-28 based current Rt. 

I figured would 8.8k 21 days point.

It took 5 days. Oh no, completely believable. Americans kind assumed decades money importnant anything choices made powers chosen money. assume yes, hopefully not. NC hot heck now. Perfect time open Disney World! /s higher percentage die us healthcare system good nations like uk simple fact people going avoid hospital long can‚Äôt afford it.

That's presumption, one based fact current trends. deaths per million, almost HALF UK at. 383 637. can‚Äôt judge complex issue like single number. It‚Äôs disingenuous best.

Lmao. one talk disingenuous, considering arguments far proven false, based emotion facts. Central FL hospitals full, long way travel find state also dealing filling hospitals. Yikes. profile picture...? new reddit thing don‚Äôt see using Apollo? SARS flu. Please learn difference. Obese people greater risk. 70 million Americans obese. 

The danger *you* risk health care system could become overwhelmed. would bad, *you*, need sudden emergency health care. I'm saying pretend exist, I'm saying constantly addicted news freaked time good either.  tell people go outside, go exercise, ride bike something. sit house feel doom gloom everyday. get saying? Myrtle Beach already seeded dozen outbreaks states. wrong well least gross oversimplification. many virus paths larger countries, one.

Also, citing ""chinese social media"" source bold claim. Depends type mask. N95 mask, well made diy cloth one electrostatic HVAC filter protects wearer much protecting others wearer.

There's enough data know working-age white folks suburbs, small towns, rural areas quite likely see significantly less impact virus demographic.

Here's uncommon story across U.S., local paper, earlier testing four community sites Minneapolis St. Paul ended Wednesday, partial results showing negligible impact protest activities COVID-19 case growth. Roughly 1.5% 7,706 tests first two weeks sites turned positive virus.The results reveal disparity spread virus, though. **The positivity rate white people test sites .2%, compared 1.3% among black people, 5% among Asians, 7.4% among Latinos.**Minorities made 40% tests 90% positive cases identified sites. probably weren‚Äôt infected protests, Ehresmann said, many work lower-wage jobs don‚Äôt present work-from-home options increase infection causation, course, mostly white folks heading could leading increased infections deaths among individuals races. There's least direct correlation investigated.

In case, certain people banking Kevin Karen caring either way -- happy re-opening plan killing right people. Karen sick paying mom live home anyway. heard twiv podcast people starting wonder anyone time peer review papers. going review them? stacking people focused research well. thought papers views - importance -  ultimately going reviewed.

Nope. People want stop wasting time talking sky blue, fact relevant virus coming China. Experts predicting pandemic years appearance virus surprises one. surprising badly certain governments failing handling distract people realizing badly they're failing. Oh, going pass easily even close everything tomorrow people wear masks inside homes. bullshit residual effects includes permanent lung / kidney / heart damage. shows stupidity Texas government.

It's state government stupid. city (and I'm sure others) already said plans enforce new restrictions. Though surprising since least one person city council anti-mask. can't help wonder large portion Americans understand mathematical concept exponential growth.

Stop wondering. don‚Äôt.

Even college educated people think things like y=x^2 y=x^10 examples exponential growth, far fewer intuitive understanding exponentials come quickly grow.

The exceptions couple widely criticized studies came California, included bad sampling, data manipulation pulled fatality rates down, combined fact population question unrepresentitively young healthy. zip codes New York lost 0.6% population, don‚Äôt know could possibly good faith argue IFR low 0.2%. 

I‚Äôm suspicious estimate may influenced political pressures, I‚Äôve seen zero compelling evidence back up. 

All said, fatality rates dropping getting better treating patients, speculation virus either mutated less fatal, least social distancing + mask wearing reducing amount viral load people exposed (both still pure speculation point). maybe going forward IFR closer low, time announced pure BS.

Because crossed fucking line.  earth bars ever allowed reopen beyond me. entire existence depends people packing together pouring liquid throat lowers inhibitions, makes want cozy others, generally completely degrades decision-making ability. 

The states would actually bar owners favor telling truth - way safely reopen vaccine. want try stay afloat take-out alcohol (where allowed), guest, otherwise better start thinking new way make living. I'm saying can't - unless find reason data wrong suggest stop spreading nonsense conspiracies. FYI anyone already know....

Easily, that's major airports, travel population density lol lands first, spreads like wildfire, ultimately moves country like seeing since lot citizens ignorant sides, leaning towards extreme ignorance right side now. complicated. Coronavirus spread well open areas. Protests outside many people wearing masks. exactly great conditions coronavirus spread, say elast.

Reopenings imply indoor restrictions also loosened, well mask requirements.

In short, reopenings almost certainly much, much bigger impact. microwaved pizza rolls ready Jesus man...  AZ: 5000 cases per day

TX: Oh yeah, well 6000

CA: That's nothing - try 7000

FL: Hold beer challenging provide rebuttal disease mutating better like sars deaths 

I care post, THREE claims sentence zero evidence provided. bunch research prove (a) virus significantly mutating, (b) mutations undergoing reducing lethality, (c) way like unlike mutations SARS. 

It's order magnitude easier spew nonsense refute it. I'm hours research argue someone who's making claims without basis. waste time say lot word word trick? Yeah....how many say wearing face mask correctly - cover mouth nose - ENTIRE time public? wearing chin count. give another $75k 3 months ill gladly work field hospital Georgia reopen again? 2 months ago? 

Remind me! 2 weeks It‚Äôs catastrophe people affected 56% people enjoy ice cream time year. thought virus got wiped? Pence answer question tell others listen state local officials campaign defied recommendations officials last week.

I words. Pennsylvanian here. I'm literally writing governor urging mandate quarantine PA southern states 14 days. 

It's apparent Florida lawmakers President going contain this. serious negative impacts happening economy shutdown. majority us (myself included) don‚Äôt feel impacts directly, it‚Äôs easy us say ‚Äúeh work home, makes sense safe possible.‚Äù

However, people getting royally truly fucked shutdown businesses going down, they‚Äôve lost jobs can‚Äôt hope find new one, etc. people shutdown far dangerous virus, understand vocal minority gets say here.

I can‚Äôt explain idiots refusing wear mask, understand people favor reopening. talking WIC Child Left Behind, think? mention statewide mask mandate. cant make people wear mask public, that's illegal. businesses sure, public. Nobody enforcing know can't legislate anyway they're hoping get called it. test, get case.

/s answered question came ask! Thanks yes, say conviction due lack evidence that's mutating less deadly. Virus actually mutated worst Europe terms easily spreads, Italy NYC got got... evidence mutation less deadly. 

People less likely die hospitals could simply elderly risky demographics better protected make smaller portion patients... Treatment also got better, we're longer plugging people ventilators expediting deaths.... proposed evidence evidence. You‚Äôre counting score we‚Äôre even first quarter yet. need media/publicity/social media campaign movie, tv, music celebs urging 40 demographic stay home &amp; stop socializing. would say past 3 weeks ever since protests, vast majority friends &amp; colleagues (all late 20's mid-30's) hung non-household members, though claimed distanced 6 feet apart. One buddy even heated conversations wife wants build extended ""household"" 2 families pre-schoolers play together. fit narrative. right protest. Unlike Michiganders protested cars. *and penis. Yeah I've heard many stories people partying Saint Patricks day going bars. cancelled California. lot people already going bars NY. Firstly, understand everyone situation. missed point, entirely.

Many us able choose situations. pandemic changed us. fact, cases, reinforced ideals (e.g. many companies beginning change perspective WFH, people starting realize benefits personal Consumer retail demand many people lost jobs

You sure that's reason? anecdote specifically offered different story. waaaay conservative now. Retail demand down, people lost jobs, people going retail stores. Even ones trying open, people going nearly much. see walking business that's affected asking them.  People travelling anymore... people lost jobs, safe so. 

That's underlying thing missing - safe things many us would like, us ability cope that.  I'm sorry stuck (in overpriced apt probably adding would wager white collar people actually spend increase entertainment, home improvement, technology, etc. everyone blowing cash bars restaurants time.

It's true, people put money towards things like home improvement rather spending out. That's fact. Businesses going accept this. spending before? doubt it. made home improvement purchases, done stuff, like gardening (yay!) spending down. spending probably 1/2 used spend. 

It sounds like making statements support don‚Äôt know single person enjoying this... 

As this, get bubble? Spend 1 minute google topic: ""I enjoying lockdown"" come back delete line post. people may boat you, many people aren‚Äôt there‚Äôs escape available they‚Äôre going take it.

Again, missed point (I replied 'Consumer demand return virus gone, way around it'). supporting anecdote stated good % us position take unnecessary risks changes caused pandemic actually beneficial towards us (not everyone like us). That's reality everyone accept. can't make us go back normal, better normal (obviously talking fact virus kills people - I'm talking stuff like control time used ownership relationships.)

No offense, post reads like frustrated trouble seeing beyond setting. I'm going recommend 2 3 walks day, 2 3 shorter bursts exercise day. Turn news already.

It‚Äôs explained million times. don‚Äôt die soon confirmed COVID. get worse, get admitted hospital, suffer 2-3 weeks ventilator, die.

Deaths lag behind confirmation. true day one hasn‚Äôt changed. 

People don‚Äôt receive positive test results promptly fall dead. Well, take days notice.... happening.

We'll see happens then. NBA devised strategy seems smart supported Dr. Anthony Fauci himself. Jumping conclusions help situation. personally think way plan go wrong, looks like they've taken every step ensure safety everybody entering bubble Orlando. Hopefully everything goes well lol appreciate truth matter ugly inconvenient hear. Since pandemic started I've seen truth downvoted even banning users altogether. Much appreciative here. common cold kills someone weakened body/immune system (such AIDS cancer), die common cold severe condition? Covid-19 directly linked underlying cause pneumonia, respiratory failure, heart attack, stroke related deaths. mention massively underreported [excess make abundantly clear something killing far people normal.  
Additionally, want call ""cooking books"" mortality statistics ""cooking books"". Take flu example. number death certificates list influenza cause per year less 500. number autopsies perform flu test nearly zero. mean less 500 people die flu per year? No, course not. numbers reported CDC estimates based excess mortality hospitalization deaths. compared flu, coronavirus death counts orders magnitude accurate likely revised CDC look excess mortality entire time period. believe hospitals reporting government? believe obituaries? 

how deep conspiracy mind go? I'm curious well. 9,000 insane. ""aTLeAsT wE'Re NEw yOrK"" cases pass 10K it‚Äôs close see big outcry shut down. Let‚Äôs forget many workers don‚Äôt want work either sitting would issue. we're shutdown *hard* 6 weeks would beat thing No, new contact-tracing feature know use location. uses bluetooth, detect another phone nearby, exchanges random numbers phone. identity information never leaves phone. software never knows location. apologies then. looked date posted.  Normalizing masks western world might end historically important effect pandemic. Savour right, might become defense face detection future. There's lockdown borders country states besides NY, NJ, CT, place that's ""safe"" safe all. take single person coming cause spike. cancelled September Disney World vacation back March 20th; sad ultimate manifestation self care wife myself. woman line said ‚Äúyou keep reservation 30 days prior trip‚Äù said ‚Äúplease cancel it. don‚Äôt think things back normal then.‚Äù don‚Äôt believe assessment wrong.

I'd think could. really comfortable protests that, particularly health outcomes black people seem worse. then, part disparity going tie directly economic inequality that's another facet systematic racism country. [I feel super comfortable telling people ""now time"". Little letter-from-a-Birmingham-jail me.

So want protest, I'm sure strongly voice disapproval. outside vast majority protesters seemed pretty mask-friendly.

The one thing think *everyone* able agree anyone chirping support opening protests anti-mask horseshit gleefully points BLM protests disingenuous cunt. far removed weekend too, can't blame buildup tests delayed reporting.  Well, leadership, think would gone Obama? OK. kids listen. best thing economy would people wear masks!  

Does think economy going anything 50% people going 50% careless? won.

Enjoy four years. I‚Äôm Rhode Island governor super strict right bat. great job cases manageable. also prepared overflow field hospitals throughout providence.

US gov't decided use coronavirus pandemic way bail companies rather 'right' thing. Amy response FAR late. virus winning wont beaten long time now.

Its basically herd immunity action now. Thats get immunity infected.

If cant seriously screwed.  exactly think needed done differently address virus? Honest question.

On one hand knows **a lot** viruses, hand he‚Äôs good getting rid them. worldometer showing 23...which state reporting 7? fine. It‚Äôs completely different! Sure Italy, Germany, Taiwan etc aren‚Äôt able identify every virus carrier. China, Russia, US actively release false information number positive tests, US actively suppressing testing order keep numbers artificially low. 
The US actually worse China regardless release press, China least trying test control within borders. Well... least broke record.... I'd argue one group worse doesnt mean group praised, ya know mean?

Over 1 million swedes abroad 4 weeks testing/tracing would worked.

Sweden reallocating resources analyze 100k tests per week. way hell testing/tracing would worked. many people needed tested was: enough staff, enough test kits, enough analysis capacity.

Something else would done testing/tracing start working. example lockdown severe enough number cases shrank enough, solution. Face masks might worked? knows...

At least there's better testing capacity now, even still inadequate number cases. Gottem. Yesterday, major hospital Houston said day away capacity two weeks away surge capacity.

I think Florida still fucked, picture might little less horrific seen first glance. fact positive cases Florida trending younger supports theory. We'll see happens future, though, can't (easily) hide excess deaths. Well counter argument end last lockdown. ‚ÄúLook unused field hospitals!‚Äù go again, history repeats itself, predictable.

How people dumb beyond me. mandate mask usage everywhere, problem would solved within months, without strict lockdown required. That's pretty standard president stuff. That's they're surrounded police.  2 weeks generally accepted amount time based observations around world, New York, even FL (it almost exactly 2 weeks shutdown cases started decreasing). positive results involve feeling sick (around 5 days), deciding get test (another day), getting test results (2-5 days), results recorded aggregated county DOH (another day), reported state next morning (another day). They're going lot trouble something thats ""hoax"". Cindy Hyde-Smith. wondering Mississippi. Jesus Christ Remind Me! 6 months. And...back square one.

Good job, everyone. Yep 3 weeks ago everyone SDing wearing masks everyone mask wearing wearing right. regard perianal space. I'm scarred go store. terrible. China's fault. People correctly looking China. makes sense me. take 2 weeks symptoms start 1 week get tested (get appointment, get results back, etc). flew Delta funeral, (of course) first time I'd flown since started. staff wore masks, even local airport require them, Delta required passengers. Hopefully 100% people turned away able breathe positive experience. Well, Florida takes State Legislature make *""law""* probably not.

I suppose could try say ""code enforcement"" issue. Like mowing grass, non-running vehicles property.

That *might* stand up. first case makes State Supreme Court probably get smacked down. point spent *way* $500 lawyers though. think extremely unlikely Texas goes back stay home order, right now, could see going back take dining only. welcome wear hazmat suit got one handy. certainly hurt. Perhaps would inspire folks take half-measure wearing mask. Good you. 

And society depends them, obviously. need reckon shitty whole sector economy is, there's exactly enough time space relocate everybody homestead get whole crop season going end June. 

The point mitigate transmission causing least amount harm possible. may noticed plastic barriers, masks, floor markings advising keep safer distance shopping. 

The fun part keeping habits going forward would probably cut flu deaths per year, too. would hazmat suit. Abbot killing us, moron closed restaurants 50% capacity mask issue yet. friends Quito (2850 meters) Cuenca (2560 meters) areas starting get hit. might resistance, like warmer climates might slow spread initially, virus seems get around barriers sooner later.  confusion pre-symptomatic transmittion asymptomatic carrier transmittion.

Pre-symptomatic transmittion common, models put peak infection 0.7 days symptom onset, pre-symptomatic transmittion believed account 40% 70% spread (based case studies like Diamond Princess).

Asymptomatics carriers much harder study believed responsible small portion infections.

Since way tell difference pre-symptomatic person asymptomatics carriers late, would wise careful time, i.e. distancing, wearing masks indoor public spaces, etc. Still seems high. heard lot nurses say, ""I wear one day work, want shopping."" want go emergency room feel ‚Äúslight sharp pain‚Äù ? Maybe try stop smoking weed vaping? CDC right 1 400 die 1 20 go hospital odds death hospital also 1 20

Someone else rough guess using data also Remind Me! 6 months. preprint still indicates rampant community spread.

Just testing isn‚Äôt enough, action needs taken based testing numbers continue rise unless action taken.

Can‚Äôt blame others, gotta something it. come guys keep ignoring 56000 new cases California showed last 14 days, 25 percent total cases. People gathering en masse California protests. support movement behind protests, don‚Äôt support gathering groups hundreds people pandemic, don‚Äôt get that‚Äôs controversial. gathering giant groups people right now, right wing left wing, part coronavirus problem. Call enlightened Centris, don‚Äôt care. whole ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt mass gathering, mass gatherings!‚Äù Mentality right laughable. whatever fuck want, don‚Äôt completely delusional fact decision enter crowd screwing entire country far pandemic goes. seem miss important part here, warn countries higher current numbers record numbers. reason neither Belarus Russia warning list. even important miss entire point WHO's statement. warning high numbers countries, warning acceleration. ""accelerated transmission led significant resurgence left unchecked push health systems brink again"".

That case matter personal opinion Sweden's strategy. literally argument use justify statement. wanting talk total numbers anything list belong thread. lot countries higher total numbers Sweden list btw even irrelevant. Well, considering additional safety measure costs money effort, I'm guessing we're going continue reopen anyway without it.

Obviously go get need food though, covid i'm country 25M people .. everyone freaking recent 'spike' 20 new cases per day last 4 days. people started panic buying toilet paper (seriously).

that number, 9000, impossible us comprehend. fcuk isnt everyone choosing lock home ?? Half many possible infections.

It make people much safer, less technically less guess. layperson, saying months ago cut ventilators. one, data China showing ~85% patients ventilators died. two, seemed like one drastic invasive responses. best, dying process extended, looks like reality much worse that. also fail understand patients treated random drug Trump promoted.

/s Doesn‚Äôt matter. PBC live made masks mandatory. 

Been running errands work across county week still half people wearing em. everyone says dumb boomers majority people without em looked 20s-30s. I‚Äôd like think laziness starting think good 50% people live don‚Äôt care anyone themselves.  don‚Äôt think two statistics looking numbers way, neither explains sufficiently. odds dying something odds something happening you. would assume cars actual number ‚Äúgiven you‚Äôve car accident.‚Äù car accidents aren‚Äôt contagious. without controlling likelihood car accident begin it‚Äôs particularly helpful. 

Also, think it‚Äôs important consider dying potential outcome, others account well. don‚Äôt want die car accident, also don‚Äôt want horribly maimed one either, let‚Äôs honest really don‚Äôt want get car accident begin (inconvenience, minor scrapes, finding years later fucked back). yeah, chances fender-bender aren‚Äôt negligible, like said significant precautions place.

I understand you‚Äôre agreeing, trying help people put anxieties context, sorts talking points exactly what‚Äôs used people decide there‚Äôs little-to-no risk. numbers without context meaningless manipulated fit whatever narrative people want.

And, hit another point: vast majority people clue whether families healthy. There‚Äôs every chance someone circle underlying condition simply haven‚Äôt found yet. Feeling healthy enough give precautions either! thank God, keep getting mosquito bites despite home days screened windows Wrong.

The virus could evolve would spread better early, kill people late evolution would happy adaptation.

Late disease host useless virus, killing particularly issue, there's law gravity virus evolve less deadly.

Anything prevented superspreading events early would poor mutations would spread. Anything inhanced superspreading events early would spread better.

As long first week potential superspreading preserved enhanced could kill lot 3 weeks infection.  that's ""will God"", call Satanist. data set ‚Äúde-identified,‚Äù HIPAA‚Äôs privacy rules apply. two methods de-identification: ‚Äúsafe harbor,‚Äù suppresses fields reveal personally identifiable information, ‚Äúexpert determination,‚Äù relies experts verify limited risk identifying country benefited whole coronavirus pandemic China.

How? China's economy suffered rest world's economy suffered. Arguably Russia benefited US laughing stock treat people like animals, lock up

How continue manufacturing rest world.

And much less would otherwise sure came condescending response, really relevant comment about.

It's absolutely wrong coming paranoid. active misinformation sources. Apparently can't read, that's national poll. we're clear, polls basically right. popular, national vote 3,000,000 people. I'm also right: never double digits like this. Nope, like 90% not.  Ah think pandemic legitimate reason keep kids home Sweden wrong forcing parents send children school face harsh penalties. 

Glad agree.  really desperate. It‚Äôs concern anymore learned early intubation way go Covid patients. past past we‚Äôve learned it.

So many people think died improper intubation?

And think concern seem obsessed people made wrong decision presented completely new novel disease.

Pfft. ""Obsessed"". called ""Something thinking moment"".

I think ""jerks"" ones dont care stuff like this.

I mean .. *do* think maybe somebody look things like bad policies exacerbated number Covid deaths, right? think maybe stuff warrants kind research? 

Or throw reciepts shoe box put bed, promising ""get around looking stuff"" point line? think combination Fox News, Radio wet-brain public servants, whose wages paid taxpayers, yet comply government regulations guidance wear masks. PDs taking action, knowingly putting officers general public risk. love it? bunch meatheads skin tight clothes. would love know Poll taken, area 90% wearing mask. Even went full open everyone acted normal (no voluntary precautions), would take 18-24 months move population. I‚Äôll track down, read real good analysis basically boiled ‚Äúherd immunity isn‚Äôt even strategy.‚Äù Yup. say think lot wishful thinking/narrative point, meaning things like school reopenings, colleges reopening, NFL season start time etc on. They‚Äôre putting things place plan start usual (hopefully) adjust accordingly time goes on. 

If things still accelerating end summer can‚Äôt imagine they‚Äôll move forward things. Atleast I‚Äôd hope not...kind amazing countries freak react get even tens cases, whatever reason states don‚Äôt get tens thousands cases. 100% sure one mean, no.

I've already answered question. Drop bone. embarrasing. also get second tested symptom onset testing readily available area. Take care good luck. Thank you! Unfortunately, distinction risk risk. risk coupled together everyone household.

The reasoning this: one gets low dose infection careful likely immune system manage beat off. However, pre-symptomatic shedding virus copies air chance getting much higher dose breathing in. sleep next breathing night 8 hours get high dose immune system less chance beating.

I know nice virus really worst nightmare. necessarily true, coworker got result 12 hours wife's took week (just got today actually). depends highly get tested many free drive thru testing sites getting huge backlogs.

0.5% sounds great extrapolated across whole population. hopefully time +/- 300 million people get better solutions Yes, needed preparedness even February, needed government knew do, needed large stockpiles equipment, especially face masks ventilators -- since commonly used among respiratory illnesses.

Someone else said lot conviction mutating better. say wasn't. McEnema?! Lmfao Utah doesn‚Äôt even 100k cases yet. Actually, NY amount cases like Utah (20K), number deaths pretty much (around 150).  One favourite comics... Fat Ninja exception Los Angeles possibly Atlanta (too early tell), growth cases occurring places large scale protests. Right growth occurring Alabama, Arizona, North Carolina, Texas, etc. 

Like - growth Detroit, Chicago, New York, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, etc going down. 

So maybe might localized issues, overall given seem conclusive correlation - mean unless people rural Alabama flying New York protest, going back home. \-Wealthy families find ways keep kids home

First, emphasis American ""individual liberty"" dogma. tell population century thing matters whatever fuck want owe anybody anything, surprise ask (for example young people) stay inside people susceptible virus, gut instinct ""no, whatever want"".

Second, terrible American healthcare. quality (if billionaire definitely want almost surgeries done US), accessibility. Considering medical emergency, well go.

But important here; lack social safety nets. countries coping better essentially *shut down* month two. would possible US, people would literally starve. American government taken decisive, effective action. sounds obvious; *is*. reason obviously incompetent government. government get magically own, voted supported large section population. *culture* allowed incompetent government rule first place ignored.

That's true. US qualify medicaid certain percentage federal poverty level they're necessarily paying healthcare Irish economy strong, know think isn't.

I never said kill people economy. Merely pointing emergency covid payments grand solution making be. hard times ahead everyone know extent success solutions short term future. Cause that's racist, duh. LMAO lil bit late would true, actually start containment, today, completely effective, immediately. 

I still seen mask order Governor DeSantis. ""the West."" countries, issues selfishness surrounding COVID. Hell, look Brazil. president said okay people die free housing. India, ton people shirking social distancing.  spikes nationwide, including places large protests, coming weeks get much worse. catastrophe already happened. 120,000 Americans died half year already still wake call. Cause news. barely banned China. Everyone non-Chinese China coming country screening quarantine. half-assed, nationality-based ""ban"". doomsayer, something heat amount viral load passed around?

Not saying doctors found better methods treatment, numbers could skewed heat weakening virus.

Death rates could worse Fall...

Again, scare tactics, trying logical discussion. possible heat contributing lower death rates severity virus currently? Like said elsewhere, understand there's least push universal gloves... since we've known since beginning virus lives surfaces weeks assuming surfaces clean... 

But nope, masks masks apparently. had/has lot different problems. 

One fact didn‚Äôt give government negotiating power prices drugs procedures. Medicare system, government would theoretically paying everything medical, would able negotiate price, already jacked ton drugs procedures. 

Obamacare increased taxes healthcare costs people responsible keeping prices people Obamacare. 

The mandate requiring health insurance, otherwise pay fee great policy either. give shitty golfer medical ideas. Plenty countries better success stories China, avoiding plague entirely.

China's recovery impressive though. Since likely anymore, no. includes players currently tested positive. guess water parks places rent tubes closed effective immediately. new way flexing money walk around without mask Infection mostly respiratory droplets air, breathing, speaking, singing, especially coughing. much touching. symptomatic? Fever/cough? Also, tests probably really low sensitivity detect infection 2 days. 60% sensitive 4 days day infection, 80% sensitive (the peak) 3 days since first day symptoms. Well, ends guess go back regular 240 week unemployment, plus rent allowance free healthcare. always great unemployment benefits. Shh, one tell they've saying *months* now.

FWIW Denmark's criteria countries thought testing adequately 5%. sure WHO's is. 

Anyway, hopefully incident cause Sweden think everything going fine, clearly not. article pisses off. link original source? offer weird, zoomed-in version graph manages crop entire axis?

It's dumb. GUYS TMC ONE HOSPITAL SYSTEM ONE INSTITUTION

Good luck that. wear mask planet fitnesses miami. compare outcomes next 10,000, 50,000, 100,000 people test positive New York versus anywhere else country, you‚Äôll see mortality rates 1 month last patient assessed essentially identical. obvious reason availability testing. healthier people gain access tests, mortality rate people tested positive decreases. New York vastly underreported number infected, slightly reporting number dead. Also, though, treatment care improved since peak New York. quite understand attitude. highlighted Swedes exploiting typical tourist hotspots country inbound tourists would, leading businesses suffering, endure much greater expense maintain rural camping sites.

You think act condescension subreddit hate part frustration speak of?  numbers pulled ass ages ago (feb?) personal guestimates we'd looking half Americans getting year next. (25% year, 25% next)
And fatality rates early South Korea Italy rates were, looking losing roughly million parents grandparents year, roughly another million next year.

My assumption every person died, would another ""almost died"" ever fully recover. Maybe they'd like COPD people Oxygen time, maybe they'd organ damage something, would severely life altering. So, another 1 million year, 1 million next year.

And every one died almost died.... another ""got bad, got it, back mostly normal"" Maybe go jogger, someone takes walks. Maybe fell shortness breath, survived COVID19 recovered that, broke hip fall? Maybe another 2 million year, 2 million next year.

All told, thats 2 million dead, 6 million various levels disability injury. (How many died polio, vs survived various levels disability?)

Since early numbers, death rate fallen quite bit, yes. absolutely think something could chip health like getting flu, getting pneumonia.

Hopefully immunity lasts least years. ‚ÄúReduces‚Äù. Hahahahaha Rebekah Jones, real numbers? rest unemployed conclude opening fast enough.

What proportionate response could possibly donning mask much? really depends conduct poll.

Wasn't poll conducted ""US"" whole? so, bode well general.

What really sucks responsible pockets US ultimately negatively affected efforts diminished towns/cities largely irresponsible.

This group effort, else wildfire burn whole forest discrimination tree. there's fat chance group effort working us, considering we've seen opposite since pandemics inception here. Maybe shouldn‚Äôt elected tv show host run it. small country San Marino, enclave state Italian peninsula far covid-19 hotspots Italy, declared today zero active cases remain country (population 34,000).

San Marino hit pretty hard considering small size. Data since beginning outbreak (source: worldometer): 698 reported cases, 656 recovered, 42 deaths. Ratios: 20,572 cases per million, 1,238 deaths per million (source: worldometer). twice confirmed ratio US.

For whoever wondering, country San Marino located center north-east Italian peninsula, far Adriatic coast, borders Emilia-Romagna region Marche region. Today 20 tests made, since beginning 5,669 tests performed, 16,622 antibody tests (half population) performed.

This question you: thikn Swedes follow **recommendations**? think they've done perfectly? Might better conseqeunces (in Denmark tihs issue consequences meted state rather employer views travel Sweden potentially endangering staff / operations)? 

And Denmark can't change laws political right now. making due recommendations **in strongest terms** real consequences meted form potentially getting fired. 

Same deal Sweden start pandemic: Sweden COULD changed laws strict NPIs due political missing. criticize Denmark Sweden? backtracked mask wearing. claims left loophole cities enforce mask usage. notice recently. 


Cities force businesses require mask usage fine businesses customers wear mask. Cities cannot fine individuals wearing mask. Absolutely, I'm resident redeployed COVID units almost everything wrong first - HCQ/Zithro, early aggressive intubations almost use things like BIPAP high-flow nasal cannula, steroids, anticoagulation. Like things really got right Tocilizumab Remdesevir, latter hard get it. Shit even took couple weeks remember started really proning

Granted, think blame doctor cause avaliable data (mainly China time) supportive things. Luckily hospital think quicker pick delaying intubation, steroids, aggressive anticoagulation think one lowest mortality rates state. 

The thing is, like psych residents nurses taking care ICU step units. 

If hospitals Texas, Florida, Arizona go surge capacity like hospitals NY/NJ (which would technically consider ""overwhelmed"") death rate go even new things we've learned. Hey Florida,

Do like Texas.

The rest America

PS seriously stop Florida man, you‚Äôre better that. trust poll says anything anymore. vast majority country grossly misinformed even basic facts, even poll likely misleading trying prove conclusion rather find one. lot us don‚Äôt really care non scientist doctor say it. Yes obviously banned international travel even earlier. Washington - 

Don't wear mask - law trouble. 
Take part city loot riot - sure, problem. means, correct numbers 30% covid, percentage climbs one percent per day.

But bear mind 80-90 happens small scale sometimes city wide cases state wide others, means soon there's transfer people (which they'd normally reserve space car accidents, heart attacks, etc etc)

They handle even ninety while, one mass casualty event, one hurricane, one tornado, one festival results hundreds sun stroke victims, etc etc would push edge job. can't teach 5 year old day. Stay safe Texas bros :( CA restaurants 50% also they‚Äôve closing streets cars letting restaurants setup tables outside.  pretty nice actually. rectify, believe meant *relative* stats, absolute total count actually  Trump convincing people COVID big deal masks worn make look bad. beginning cared GDP fought protective measures every step way. numbers horrific asked less testing make reflect poorly him. said publicly several times past week. LESS TESTING COVID SKYROCKETING. WTF would've thought opening way cases still rising, sloppy masks, getting together groups could result spiking cases?

Certainly Governor Desantis, apparently. love left protesting huge crowds. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott closing bars lowering restaurant occupancy back 50%. comes Texas faces record-high coronavirus cases across Moving apartment woke headache lil throat tickle. get test going home? Could also hangover mean absolute stats? different total stats? way proper quarantine works, everyone respected it, contracted virus would move past contagious without spreading it. called lowering R-value. R-value one, pandemic goes away; one grows exponentially.

School children required get certain vaccinations, times vaccine mandatory certain circumstances, SARS, despite people making similar argument are.

You think White people wearing masks...? fair, think people think majority us get it, especially follow reopening brashly been.

People haven‚Äôt talking flattening curve much still ought be.

The economy US state state Texas locking comparison states lockdown hasn‚Äôt accomplished anything beneficial economy actually hurt long-term give Rubio one. way crazier issues. Nope, Sweden behaved properly one would close borders them. Simple. imagine going hospital broken arm, test positive Corona, getting forcibly unnecessarily put ventilator leaving bodybag. What's lee-der-ship? saying correctly?  one said he's smart Americans. Humans intuitive grasp exponential growth, mathematical training help much.

Here's thought experiment:

Take piece paper, fold half. Then, fold half again. thickness quadrupled. 40 times (ignoring physical limits paper, double thickness 40 times).

Without math, thick think paper is? 95% confidence interval?

Spoiler alert (and know spoiler tags work would go past moon's orbit!&lt; many areas city, easy maintain distance outdoors. sidewalks often crowded. Try change back. Mostly good news world (similar trend happening over) Herd immunity Sweden probably much lower states US dense cities half amout single households.

I believe US actually less dense cities average, people likely spread suburbs.  this...way thinking....or way calculating numbers grow quickly, new number grows even quicklier ... somehow number gets big, gets even bigger fasterly biggester. must person somewhere viewed numbers done some....MaTh? could seen coming. lol guy. can't deal facts. also opened long Florida. NH opened effectively 2 weeks ago. July 4 next weekend heat. People partying like virus. 
 
Come August back lock people stupid everywhere. No, I'm American care less protests. anything, think silly times pandemic, know, that's Americans decide. saw wrong comment (yours) needed addressed corrected

My account two days old deleted old one -- u/Ich_Will_2_Nummer_9s. that, account u/rundeshaus. fed reddit deleted account, twice now, came crawling back social media addiction.

So tell -- exactly ""motivation""? I'll wait. Matt gaetz whatever fuck idiots name is, wore gas mask make joke ""hoax"" Florida hang outside capital building killing citizens. Wrong sizing also big problem sure. qualified? areas stringent quarantines imposed, like NYC, work. countries stringent quarantine imposed, worked, too. Also, deaths sure going go Texas Florida ICU's hitting max capacities. YEs, people havve confirmed employees leave fired answering phone calls returning messages. people purposely ignored calls employer. Tesla eventually said, ""responding within 2 days fired third day"". still respond.

How much child think company 48k people two staying home? one else fired, two yahoos lied press refused answer phone. likely scared questioned press stuff, tesla never mentioned messages.

They lied press quit responding employer, simple. Logically don‚Äôt see makes sense. virus around year, doing? One could see clearly spread current timeline. could unnoticeable throughout world year sudden explode everywhere time? Makes zero sense Well, we‚Äôre certainly going eradicate it. know places like NY PA measures taken positive impact nonetheless. US pretty shitty spot. innovatove Trump book author! took credit work &amp; maybe even pay for. Innovation needs lots dedication hardwork, multiple girlfriends hollywood opposite! season going cancelled. Give week. shhh one tell deaths tend lag month I'm Madera. Luckily cases high good recovery rate here. Florida 7 times likely infected last month. balance out? know it‚Äôs smart spouse essential worker cautious people really sleeping separate beds spouse goes store something? Wouldn‚Äôt least 5 days wait symptoms show? husband went back office job week avoided kissing slept bed. It‚Äôs hard know what‚Äôs normal caution what‚Äôs much. hope agree issue pockets northeast states pushing back restrictions. big part see out. Ladies Gentlemen,

 present American people. average seem capable manage pandemic response President lot senators governors.

Thank you, everybody, stay safe listen experts! Great, dead risk retired medical personnel Actually growing rather slowly.

The problem Indian ""lockdown"" able reduce growth all. India merely reduced rate low exponential growth, rather higher one. America. Nope. polls ever showed Hillary lead like this. Hillary never states play. Remember, boy electoral college total 90,000 votes across 6 states. again. swing states Biden double digits Democratic primary turnout 4x 2016. orange daddy finished. science ""fake news"" too? Ouch! deserve though. 126k 328 million. actually look deaths, find majority elder care homes, people risk factors. people get virus asymptomatic! yes, fearmongering shut entire economy virus really serious vast majority. beginning thought threat, updated data showed otherwise. Educate yourself, buy sensationalism media subreddit. Thank link, would argue even despite that, counter obvious argument wages problem... wages problem. Without true safety net rely on, low paid serious trouble. That's safety net people critical. basically perfect plan. seeing rural areas successful like atlantic Canada NZ similar terms size, economy, population, density, etc. works won‚Äôt necessarily work different places different situations.

Catching early also would helped. someone decided ignore WHO, ignoring UN WFP say shutdowns kill hundreds thousands day starvation people aren‚Äôt willing listen either. don‚Äôt learn.  Yep, got bit Reddit argument yesterday poster said can't afford shut anymore. 

As economic experts said, economy going recover we've dealt virus. 

One way another win. CDC going webmd route except instead everything cancer covid. Yeah, think people said ""we shut nothing happened"" proven wrong, go EU route, get numbers low possible, try again? Spain reported basically major country earth involved WWI Yep, gotta be. people can't even bothered wear mask definitely waiting turn line swab rammed nose safe. /s Imagine actually taking college-level statistics class government dip shit. god, we're intensely fucked here. anybody remember DeSantis press conference shouted journalists told wrong numbers high?

Sidenote: Yes, there's still tons people refusing wear masks Central Florida. Absolutely. Sean Hannity convinced thousands (maybe more) Americans COVID-19 bad flu comparing *2 months deaths COVID-19* entire year deaths flu Ugh, someone fire guy already? Please? He's absolute incompetent done modern era harm Sweden practiaclly public figure (although tbh blame ultimately rest Prime Minister letting stupid technocrat like Tegnell run country). York County area parents informed people wear masks, included. avoid places people don't, living Midwest, glad elderly parents state run government gives shit. if, alternatively, treated systemic issues systemic solutions.

If gun jams neglected it, dumbass.

If gun jams federal government bothered award contract better company they're dumbass.

Forcing us internalize individualized responsibility allows irresponsible. I'm person see super upset buffet's i'm skinny. fat american allies? Liar. fell ladder once.. Never felt thing. fact, felt anything waist ever since. Imagine going effort make fake card avoid mask way calculated per total population, meaning sick, healthy everything between.

There 2 accurate ways calculate deaths hospitalizations ongoing pandemic. Confirmed Cases, Total Population. People believe COVID put total population metrics pretend that's ""estimated case"" metrics.

At point future disease studied better, estimated case count based antibody testing results self reported symptoms. add suspected deaths get ""true"" estimated death hospitalization rate. Right, extremely limited applicable individual known cases. see support text law society wide lock downs. could probably close private business using ordnances, see lawful way interfere private gatherings movement. empty af hospital too... *except* time icu full 7x normal amount patients ecmo ventilators. 

Now imagine bad would hospital full everything operated normally. see MAJOR problem?

Also empty evidence need social distancing works Meant specifically ones tested. know unlikely same. entry quarantine travel ban every time. People going try get push people underground need create many exemptions travel ban rendered useless.

There reason major health orgs (and maybe still don't) back travel restrictions things like this, simply worth time enforce compared everything else that's possible I'm sorry.....what? ""These jokers"" work world's leading medical institutions. shown Sweden, economy operates pretty much without lockdown. lockdown also prevent number innocent people dying. really effect, long people wore masks. NYC hotspot COVID protests, weeks peak marching demonstrating numbers still going down. Trump really needs start caring virus stock market understand hate doomsday person. Virus care politicians spin. let spread, spread will. Abbott fooling anyone himself. 44% Americans clueless comes spread disease? Young people ones YOLOing spreading everywhere. younger median age, absolute worst it‚Äôs going get. full on, nation wide lockdown, probably not. Local lockdowns might better. cant remember exactly silly stat crimes committed black people racists always parrot. It‚Äôs little bit funny Americans whole statistic now. Probably longer 1200 problem can't globalize it. location different. reopening situation good enough area. Reopening increase cases, ""now we're open forever"", like valve, open bit pressure builds close bit, controlled city/state. ""We've popularized going expert advice, guess problem unfixable"" Annnnd Florida shattered daily record 8900+ Nothing! Oh Fucking God Disney likely close. Whether announce today next week matter. Don‚Äôt worry everyone. Jacksonville Beach isn‚Äôt going serve alcohol past 12 anymore. big announcement today help stop spread  isn‚Äôt huge surge hospitals filled capacity.

Plus, always get reinfected there‚Äôs that... Absolutely was. one issues. critical groups Swedes social media they've taken calling ""Dr. Tengella"". fairly apt since he's performing unethical public health experiment without consent. got facebook stupid meme saw ""manly"" meme wearing masks building immune system. comments circle-jerk particular group shaming wore mask most. called fools, called fool believing COVID-19 exists. 

It goes between-

1- liberal hoax ruin economy thus 45's chances re-election

2- Chinese declaring biological warfare

3- exist big deal all

This comes people. They're bandaid assume moderate compliance best. 95% compliance public (not businesses), cases would drop like fucking stone.

Which contradict point - since Abbot even mandated masks businesses, compliance would likely spotty did. masks present effective remedy crises. measles, actually stopped rudimentary precautions act together society. idea guarantee isn‚Äôt ‚Äú9k new cases week‚Äù empty. absolutely part problem. science points one thing you‚Äôre still spouting rhetoric part based credible facts.

Please stop. Please put mask.  course is. That‚Äôs best. Murica. Nope, that‚Äôs majority is. delineations ‚Äúsimplest‚Äù majority 51%. Lolol funny, man cancer cardiovascular deaths. chart gives wrong impression people actually die general. read COVID-19 sub more. Vaccines already produced masses speak ( although risk vaccine fails). America enough needed. It‚Äôs third world countries going wait anything. vaccine risk population. Granmom going get matter feels vaccines. really bad. That‚Äôs doubling 13.05% today  cute think started recently. really think thing ""wedge"" issues before? places California causing new cases conservative suburbs LA. I've following quite time, today marks day officially became statistic this... Although, glad Stockholm stepped testing, could actually **confirm** had/have it. moved reopen may, almost July. arent moving quickly, *moved* quickly reopen. damage done. try go back now, expect riots. wont Ron DeSantis one worst governors modern U.S. History. think blame people brainwashed paid attend rallies.

Or blame governments allowing this. Y'all even shut down. nah, thing. I'm work college rushed opening last week. student came tested positive entire office exposed. plans place possible exposure administration completely quiet. reasonable PRECAUTIONS TESTING, prophylaxis like masks high risk situations condoms high risk situations, shutdowns abstinence sex living. would like see relatives die example, risk risk. wouldn‚Äôt like see anyone starve death face lower risk covid-19 either. forgetting millions democratic protesters? anyone doubt, research themselves. know, use computer something Facebook. lived city 10000 people would 5 people died disease 4 75 years old. I'm looking curve definitely looks like never position reopen Yeah, I‚Äôm essential worker I‚Äôm afraid highway corona virus. People flying swerving traffic. ftg Work grocery store SC confirm. Even younger employees take masks back store. share palletjacks floats dont get sanitized. one us gets it, getting it. would give anything able take work till savings end sight, resigned accept inevitable. people accept new lockdown? number going down, Beijing CDC reported 3rd generation patient today (someone directly related Xinfadi market), also first case Changping district far away.

So, still question whether outbreak ""contained"" conclusion drawn. There's plenty proof Sweden exporting cases Croatia. also caught exporting cases countries, suspected exportations well (1st link Croatia): feel like I‚Äôm watching horror movie extreme slow motion every character making worst possible decision. I‚Äôm frustrated Americans chosen selfishness months pleasure destroy progress we‚Äôve made, cause deaths ruin economy more. still try find things enjoy moment going lot hikes, reading, playing video games catching tv shows. I‚Äôm online school British imperial government certainly neglected respectable analysis India. mention native Indians almost completely cut treatment went white people. iraqi information ministry every state Yes Trump excepted places Europe golf courses course virus would avoid nation Makes sense. Probably better people‚Äôs mental health let watch family members die instead properly inform protect other. ü§™ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇ Unbelievable deniability gets you. Or, know, less 1% US's cases/deaths significantly lower rate per capita. could political like suggesting right, expensive organic grocery store near top can't shopping mandatory paycut husband take expires July 1. mostly use PeaPod Instacart. businesses still wfh right thank god godspeed new docs starting residency That's insane. wonder many asymptomatic hospitalized last 72 hours. would nice see complete breakdown number age, hospitalization, etc. gf took latest grocery trip seriously started stocking there's another run grocery stores. we're PA case numbers still dropping. Seeing travel hotspot areas surges makes think northeast nearly woods yet, still regularly see people ignoring wearing mask.

We're stocking up, now, caught pants down. reminder take proper care shit expect always work, keeps toes. West coast Disney: Maybe reconsider.


Florida Man Disney: Hold turkey leg! welcome :). Though seriousness, often wonder compare statistically countries around world. get high percentage people lacking ability reason? course badly educated country long trained mindless consumerism distrust higher learning, sometimes wonder indeed factor well. Maybe undiscovered chemical contaminant causing large scale brain damage? Ten point something finally got auto mod huh economic consequences overwhelm hospital system?

I understand folks need work, something full lockdown masks pussies want mitigate risks right think maybe genocide. Oh, going fun watch. start blaming detectors giving covid connected via 5G network. Well, China one possible originators. think France another. US seemingly likely culprit think ever really conclusively determined.

In case COVID... blame China responding way have. deserve criticism that. like lab-grown weaponized virus dumb shit like that. disagree, American's stupid, come terms fact can't stop vocal stupid minority besmirching good name thus can't anything watch ship sink.... Further... true overflowing patients. high levels patients, doctors can‚Äôt spend amount time treating one triage death rates go up. yet, people died western Europe US...with population sizes... Yeah either way far virus spread goes don‚Äôt see blame game much pertinence discuss. could done better &amp; certainly could done better ourself US &amp; could still better. Even well aware going on, government also us public early March vast majority us even slightly considering threat. government wind far back November. didn‚Äôt think issue. forget late thing potus clearly saying worry 15 cases would soon become zero. &amp; think China deserves criticism long ass list crimes humanity fact Covid matter ‚Äòdefinitive‚Äô evidence prove originated &amp; even it‚Äôs hit miss virus would become now. Swine flu absolutely traced back pigs United States &amp; traveled globe. would killed people still don‚Äôt see fault. It‚Äôs natural disaster imo &amp; don‚Äôt blame natural disasters people. come together &amp; help one another, least ideally that‚Äôs we‚Äôd react. wonder mass protests anything it? case mortality infection mortality ratios? Wow. Wow. Wow. 
Trump failure every way human be. 57% study 30 cases.
Not mention little explained terms lifestyle- smoking, vaping etc. apply unemployment? unemployed? protests breakable imo. looting dont punish even talk amnesty see masks reason tips scale. Everything politics now. Don‚Äôt fucking fly right dude. states opening millions trump fans running zero care concern. sort does. Announce sooner rather later, crazies anything stupid aware what's going on. daily headlines while, even pull back die cast next week two. that's lockdown also drastically helped reduce overflow.

Let's forget first wave Italy hit mostly north, healthcare resources abundant. second wave widespread, hitting places available beds per capita low.

And yet still hear people Sardegna (~[5000 hospital beds complaining get tourism.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Thats happens leader country tells people virus hoax refuses wear mask look ""weak"" mask blocks 99% transmission, everybody front personal fanblowing 1% around deal heat, better worse off?

I feel like fans defeating purpose masks? Sheriffs worst law enforcement. aren‚Äôt even really law enforcement. elected politicians agenda. first part police reforms needs away dumb fucks. rubber bullets... shooting virus.

/I suppose add /s.  Otherwise...  choose Croatia demonstrate anything bad, pick almost every country SE Europe look increase cases, apparently stirred people one instance beginning May Corona got imported workers Sweden...

Why borders widely open though? *raises hand* Exactly. 

At certain point, pandemic threat medical care.

Even risk survival really great young healthy take proper precautions, COVID tanks hospital ability survive anything requires hospital care becomes much riskier.

I'm glad many people like odds Corona. like odds surviving car accidents without hospitals? question.  not. officers going issue citations begin with. Name one city mask fines officers comply. definitely spread fish though protesters sides blame

One side believes covid doesnt exist

The side decided covid longer problem Yeah there's list shit politicians one too. Jeb Bush Rick Scott, two devils one still haunting us Senate. Broken, broken system blue hairs keep perpetuating. ""Er gawd he's trying chip use 5g towers control brain , that's easier way make money SELLING SOFTWARE "" making sense... India decently capable country. space programs pharma stuff. Texas little melty  Mine too. house wide cases doubled since beginning week. Unfortunately, seems like understand time lags:

""‚ÄúWhen system cannot absorb, there‚Äôs capacity consideration limitation, that‚Äôs obviously alarm bells raised,‚Äù said.""

He needs act avoid hospitals reaching capacity rolling back opening California. acts hospitals reach capacity late. US deaths per capita countries. Decisions even receive text notification looping in.

Can provide policies stated made President? ask he's pretty much dishonest broker say whatever situation seems warrant, active policy seemed made state level. I'm legitimately interested policy decisions knew people could die result.

Also, administrators article meant occupancy said 80% capacity. idea choosing arbitrary number aligns point means. arbitrarily tell hospitals 25%? ... continued Sheriffs elected officials. swore protect Constitution can't enforce law think violates it.

If believe seperation power, free move Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea leftist paradise. Oh, there's cases pretty much everything listed more. Definitely more. Rednecks smart tend meet death even simple circumstances. conspiracy theory nonsense.

Conspiracy Theory? man barely form unplanned coherent sentence. really think he's one charge campaign? C'mon. told work employee several family members tested positive vacationing Florida last week. people think going Florida fun good idea right now? WHAT? Unbelievable man Again, experience yeah.... I‚Äôve actually rough time dealing that. feel like I‚Äôm dramatic it‚Äôs giving really jaded view people now. Damn COVID making straight existential crisis lol What's worrying actually upvoted much. Ofc matters PR thing. fact catch positives mean spread increasing, important distinction. percentage positive tests going up, meaning spread increasing see definitive numbers. always clear spread tests shows gone ICU death numbers instead. never unaware amount positives higher exact numbers. Trying make increase amount positives spread accelerating legit form propaganda misinformation matter view strategy Sweden uses. Mask enforcement usage become lax late. don‚Äôt know y‚Äôall buildings haven‚Äôt one since started grocery stores full people without masks despite mandate. ‚ÄúHad continued May early June course, thought disease prevalence low enough, may moved quicker it,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúBut want see positivity rate go start.‚Äù

he's one brought metric, he's gotta live it. try talk her. closed minded self centered might get mad like ‚Äúoh well ya do?! Can‚Äôt live life fear!‚Äù Hospitals emptier. great guys justify masks social awkwardness. nice guys feel way, people enjoy social interaction nuances.

It's plain offensive see people justify way.

Sincerely, opinions normal people. (that go reddit) Yeah trump nothing try quell protests instead wanted get military involved making problem worse. totally blame arrogant could swallow pride try thing people instead election campaign. understand food production works, think. see, people produce food produce certain seasons tourists then, sun warmth plants grow then. know, amazing concept. anywhere America. know moron chief pedals psychosis (Virus going away, mocking masks Coronavirus parties), shocks willfully ignorant catastrophic leadership. test cases. HELL SAYS THINGS LIKE THIS? 'catastrophe' make change

Or, know, actually closing non-essential stuff?  Norm Macdonald: Hey remember Coronavirus funny? Well last state release slaves keep record up! Fingers crossed, hopefully get vaccine public soon. fall/winter could get nasty. Last Us 2. I'm Chapter 19 40. make go away reduce infection rate low enough person gets infect less 1 new person recover. that, shrink gone. enforcing mask wearing, social distancing, contact tracing. epidemiology 101. 

Each person cheats raises R drags further, enough people cheating raise 1 start going enough people become immune due previous infections R go back 1. grows exponentially long, going take drastic measures like lockdowns get rate 1 start shrinking.

We many people contributing spread inane idea necessary public health measures considered optional. Plenty countries successfully implemented measures succeeded containment. Fuck yeah we're number one many things. USA USA USA! Polling opinion fact exactly reason we're here. opinion matter reality concrete. Both? Americans something? finally enough? political divide blinded many. Congress, time 25th. Central Iowa - every age group % people stupid shit. combine Dakotas, possibly Virginia‚Äôs. Ideally things. research seem indicate parties intimate gatherings one main sources spread. protests probably facilitate spread gonna take time get enough data fully evaluate much spread occurring there. 

Either way people irresponsible give license irresponsible yourself. That's horrible. I'm sorry. We‚Äôre becoming ever trumpesque God you, friend.

He certainly Florida, even believed lying bastard. New York throwing shade positive find population snowbird seniors back north. capacity quite high. ya. nightmare. Ah got ya. even considered basically hibernate summer anyway. changing fast. Minimal effort paper related different, published 13 days last findings course did.  Statistics tell likelihood individual attend rally one doesn‚Äôt believe science odds coming county covid spikes certainly higher coming county larger proportion population believe science. third possible answer crafty Chinese came night, defrosted sample, stuck fingers refroze s/ Welcome Germany February, Dr. Fauci! Ny guy chiming report day, previous day test results come in.. NJ CT also follow system, different states report different times number changes day absolutely right everything said want take away it,

I'm pretty sure studies shown masks slightly help well. much less reduction someone else wears good note anything encourages people wear Yes funny guy listed literally everything could side better a, b, c, x, y, z zero justification. 

It‚Äôs exact tribalism makes country laughing stock world billionaires continue prod around make money. hates voter suppression bother voting oh shit suppressed vote Pretty much both. absolutely see money important. even representative say people willing sacrifice economy Texas huge tubing industry. really rafting. thousands people sitting big innertubes, crammed together close every tube touching every tube around it, drinking beer, party. white water rafting. There's excitement here. shit ton people hot sun asses feet cold water, gently floating slow moving river. Look pictures ""floating Guadeloupe River."" talking service dogs.

An employer require proof disability instance. come court. Fffff corona fake news close back moss traffic. Well mean Florida basically asking dipshit governor point got sent back work. supposed do? people knowledge social reach warn everyone dangers early on, foundation said NOTHING started spread Wuhan unchecked

FUCK bill gates nonprofit ecosystem whole, failures laid see point Yup. Houston mask fine police union literally said enforce it. Mask orders literally virtue signaling. Keep opening, freedumbs! Muh liberties! Minorities account 65% cases race/ethnicity known, make 30% US upper management unfortunately. boss management. HR either. top. wrong, mass gatherings dangerous even everyone wearing mask. NY‚Äôs single day record? good morning!

how guys coping stress? working + eating healthy + saving money goes along way stress taking toll body. physical aches pains. also help i'm sharing enviornment 2 negative people earth. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* *Donald Trump entered chat* states two week martial law response lack compliance 'punishment'. that's over, see still want act people enforce avoid again. Treat like kids boot camp going act like kids. blajo checking I'm spreading virus around, taking steps ensure best ability happen. Vulnerable people remain home, scared, remain home well. I've taken risks family consideration, parents isolated nearly 6 months infect them. would prefer keep working living meaningful existence rather hiding crowded home binge watching Netflix. problem that, I'm sorry, quickly losing battle public eye, take look around. Mask up, get life. hide home, really care, get stool stop thinking someone else's job keep safe, trust me, nobody else looking you. little late even cases come ban see drop 5-14 days, Houston track reach 100% ICU capacity tomorrow, means tomorrow every car accident, mother labor, etc. Houston unable receive intensive care need it, deaths going skyrocket. affecting kids? seen updates since kicked popular obviously true. I'll mention ""no re-infections"" crowd gone too. perhaps sweden strategy work warm tourist locations high population densities HUGE! Total deaths way judge response country. us leads countries cases per million 6,052, pnly country close uk 4,370. Looks like we‚Äôre fine. Yes. spread ventilation China. I‚Äôm sure United States keen hiding type information.   Yeah joke got old like 3 months ago little late even cases come ban see drop 5-14 days, Houston track reach 100% ICU capacity tomorrow, means tomorrow every car accident, mother labor, etc. Houston unable receive intensive care need it, deaths going skyrocket. infect 500k people everday year postCommunity options  ""rarer,"" I'd say based statistics (which I've following closely), ""exceedingly rare, point outlier."" Every disease kill healthy people age. Young people die flu. Young people die chickenpox. (I chickenpox age 30 almost hospitalized, even though I'm considered ideal weight age height.) 
The fact matter median age deaths COVID-19 \*80 years old.\* pretty much tells need know severity thing. average person dying old, could've died anything. something like 40% deaths taking place nursing homes. nursing home take someone literally \*can't feed bathe own\* anymore! point, stiff breeze kill someone. 
That's say \*can't\* kill young healthy person. \*extremely unlikely.\* fact affect policy \*dramatically\*, instead, treated like Black Plague. ain't. 
Thanks listening TED talk. Lol. :-b Well 45 people die guess always going outcome.

We've road generations now.

Why ever think otherwise? anyone studying transmission easier high humidity? believe mix poor education, social life especially toxic upbringing. Poor education bad enough own, uneducated parents make things worse they're truly ignorant(sexist, racist, etc). grow seeing it, realize wrong try escape toxic environment, take spread it. Toxic mentality like virus, US seems bad work med center, it‚Äôs true Houston good amount hospitals outside med center, word mouth began maxing several days ago. med center beginning max big deal. doesn‚Äôt matter percentage covid vs covid. beds means beds, end story. headline get clicks, yes, statistic absolutely cause concern. Climate change meat buns. Vietnam fairly evenly affected country. someone drafted family knew, friends knew, local community knew. became pronounced everyone loop come home. Similarly lot community involvement. many neighbors really know? Back grandparent's time knew everyone ~100 houses neighborhood, pictures prove show regularly 'good times' want return to...on social media.

COVID tends kill elderly individuals. many older people average person know? Beyond that, would know die? someone family know care strongly enough take time contact you? Beyond that, majority elderly individuals active social media beyond families. Also, COVID spreads person person, cases stay localized. Meaning one town acutely aware damage COVID, many deaths yet.

Vietnam well known impactful since deaths spread fairly recently large parts nation, time everyone paying attention aware status individual risk. localized locations highly risk mostly unknown majority, deaths passed along people know them. pcb last week. like traveling back time pre covid car accidents well. kinda baised include biggest killers. choose ignore experts, then? I'm IMPLYING accommodate me. I'm merely implying even though state boasts increasing testing, simply enough tests accommodate directed doctor get it. mean entirely possible bunch covid patients discharged vast majority new cases we've seeing people 44 I'm intellectually dishonest sharing actual reality contradicts parroted hysteria bullshit? florida percent almost 11 today Wear masks. Study study show exponentially limit spread. 

While can't eat drink mask on, could easily require patrons keep masks till server brings food, bartender brings drink. 

Masks work could easily keep country running like many countries today discpline respect towards social distancing wearing masks. Summer fine, I'm prepping tell PhD advisor I'm stepping foot campus undergrads there. I'll get lab work done night to. Henry Ford racist. Jews, strong opinions black folks well

Funny enough he's reason square dancing schools today. thought traditional form dance would keep us falling jazzy sin It‚Äôs crises many people talk about. Lots them, like cruise ship employees, trapped making income. Florida beyond FUBAR already. I've reported them, multiple times. Maybe another mod simply discarded report left them. meant per month. always idiots, trump gives credibility people normally listen do. 

It greatly increases scope problem. graphs fucked up. exponential like growth NEW cases, derivative function itself. means total amount cases going explode. happening US. Feels like COVID getting warmed up. affects mean...we could obscene military budget could maybe actually afford that. Ship weed I've wondered thing. someone disease enters area recirculated air, without mask, germs would pulled circulation dispersed. Hope older coaches don‚Äôt catch So, effect closed. I'm curious see well people comply second lockdown coming certain areas. Yes likely Swedes Croats case like May... point again, ""pariah nation"" - many Swedes travel around days So... telling could far worse today. 

Thanks... guess.  Likely bipolar  that's desantis said he's right along

/s maybe little contact tracing figured might good idea rub elbows closed room full people? hard believe late game figure out. start understand many zombie movies set US. Probably countries control. sure. Discharges &amp; deaths definitely up, we've typically seen growth hospitalization regardless discharges. Something else happening. confirm.

I live Orlando, driving around (even Orange County mandating masks), everyone pretending business usual.

Publixes packed, people crammed restaurants, bars. Hell, roommate receptionist massage place says they're fully booked weeks.

And top that, governor wants pretend problem young people getting sick others, here's thing: young people work retail, food service, etc. Young people come contact boomers covid-denial every day, lot idea virus.

This going get loss worse gets better. wish could recall DeSantis. yeah I'd say anecdotally like 95%/5% masks/no mask. least I've seen different areas Central CT. 0.5-2.2% mortality rate. based mortality rate cases estimated true infection mortality rate? Florida, stopped alcohol sales insit consumption, 8,000 cases reported today.... thought job prepare fight coming back. I'm legitimately interested policy decisions knew people could die result.

Well, know people die every year uninsured therefore cannot manage health care. know policy fix this.

And actually seem motivated change that. US condemns people death every day refuse change enact policies save lives.

Everyone knows COVID-19 cause death patients. US allows virus ravage people instead containing like many countries done, making decision kill many people.

Actions consequences. know consequences refuse act way prevent Also, administrators article meant occupancy said 80% capacity. idea choosing arbitrary number aligns point means. arbitrarily tell hospitals 25%?

It's math problem. threshold 25% capacity 80% occupancy trouble. That's negative number. Positivity rate Fl daily basis place - guess we're big state parts better others based bulk tests come from. 7-day average there's that. plus young people parents, jobs, interacted tourists, etc etc 
Where getting data? talking true surge capacity adding ICU beds surge capacity surges due protests. go 24 hour period. state reports different times though. problem people don‚Äôt agree ‚Äúreopen‚Äù means. people want ‚Äúreopen,‚Äù meaning strategically open offices, schools, retail shopping. Others want ‚Äúreopen‚Äù going clubbing every day week, packing hotels shore capacity, hosting Coachella. Lives currency spent enrich others. ""mismanagement"" much deliberate intentional.

When serve money, serve Mammon, lives immaterial. Literally immaterial, material valued here. ‚Äúhating family.‚Äù also know person saying thinks whole situation, get based conservative talking points I‚Äôm sure people take guesses. 

The bottom line is, seeing serious numbers begin occur, NY NJ imposed measures needed see improvements see now. Many states either opened soon never imposed restrictions serious, needlessly suffering everyone done long it, maybe states wouldn‚Äôt seeing spikes new records. job won‚Äôt operating long. Texas governor pulled head sand morning, gov soon too. manslaughter Abbott idiot handle opening way. fiancee go since vendors venue saying ""The state open, open. can't reschedule."" either $12k take preventative measures 

Hospital metrics way according AZ Department Health:  

* Covid inpatients decreased 343 
* 30 ICU beds freed 
* Ventilator usage decreased 103 
* Still hovering 88% ICU capacity

Unfortunately cure stupid keep mind tests taken graded today, week ago new york's peak 12K new cases early april. florida's quite yet expect it'll get worse.  unemployment? government giving 800 week pretty much anybody job.. safety net? Seems pretty close UBI read article well multiple studies exact issue thanks. feel like thought said last part threaten people. not. I'm fit. said last part kind existential/dark joke. Well... mostly... world really going shit atm. problem 2 months would late. It‚Äôs frustrating taking seriously. test rates really jumping up. wasn‚Äôt yesterday number tests administered really started increase.

Increase positive test rates number tests remains flat bad combination, points testing reporting breaking records. I'm road trip across basically middle America right (Colorado/Kansas/Missouri). Family funeral.

Virtually *nobody* (95%-ish)of people various truck stops, etc. wearing masks. people **working** usually least one sorta on, hanging chin something similar. Plexiglass seems everywhere frankly amazing rolled quickly place.

Most highway places hot food, sandwiches, fountain drink kiosks open usual. zillion signs asking social distancing.

One place surprised see three restaurants inside three open running. sit places....Mexican, Chinese, sub sandwich place. sign asking folks social distance groups, it. anybody watching dragging away chains anything weren't......I stick around course, maybe got dirty look.

Everybody working restaurants masks on, slightly gas station folks. Again, plexiglass everywhere.

I stop rest areas know those. know manned might insistent masks that's guess. 

My assessment America part said ""mask thing"" needed more, except unusual circumstances. pandemic end Either herd immunity (not ideal) vaccine. We‚Äôll seeing headline Like 1918 Flu, history repeats...Doom/dumb prophecy fulfilled... stupid complaint people literally dying turn 17 Sunday feel shitty. 

I gonna go little swimming hole place got closed bc corona. thought maybe could something friends outside none friends allowed hang rn city hit hard. like ‚Äúokay least hang boyfriend‚Äù turns symptoms rn can‚Äôt hang test negative feel better might take long time really allergies considering it‚Äôs hard get test live 

Just sad :( mom trying make fun sweet I‚Äôd rather skip years birthday honestly I‚Äôve lost ten pounds since lockdown I‚Äôm eating better, sleeping more, exercising home (what else gonna do?). Yes, new news, old news, controversial. change anything. 70 million people 60 USA. No? I'm simply saying sometimes get stuck bubbles forget people dumb shit regardless place residence.  listening Re-pub. representatives? plan blow April, big Easter celebration problem! summer months sure really killed spread virus dead tracks, especially southern states. nothing worry about.

This big DemonRAT hoax caused 5G wireless towers, anyways. Masks actually make sick, dontcha know?!? impossible wear one hour without succumbing *Karenitis*.

So worry pretty little head little global pandemic, early June wake like dream. go *spend, spend, SPEND*! need economy afloat share holders! Hey Spain pick child please? century custody Florida.

Civil war 350,000 dead Americans virus. Casinos poker rooms aware either.

They opened one bars disney springs soon bar order came throug right middle day. like Bay Area experience. first question (not valid). Yes second (false sense security). Temperature-checks merely theater.  little late. go FMLA? Linux, MacOS, ChromeOS - viable competition days. can't blame someone creating product everyone thinks better wants use. like forced fortune 100 companies use product early days. countries must look u.s. completely baffled ineptitude handling pandemic Where's joker meme? somewhere... No, probably understand works, understand academically idea translate something actionable. People really fucking stupid, even ones stupid prone ignorance laziness thought. there's anything I've learned working customer service last 12 years, literally end depth stupidity public. honestly even trying extra snarky anything, rationale behind actions people take, concepts think would relatively well known understood usually best partially known even less understood. 

Many many people actively learn things, meaning take time/effort pay attention doing. unless job directly relates exponentials (finance, math, etc) chances vast majority people understand would way actually grasping exponential curve actually means real world application/scenario. there‚Äôs gonna wave 3. Huh? What? John Hopkins University days it‚Äôs 0.5% people 60. That‚Äôs fair point it‚Äôs hard industrial settings everything imperial here. ever get machine North America convert everything metric standard. mention need twice tools. standard set metric set. I‚Äôd say go metric: it‚Äôs way simpler system. Florida‚Äôs underreporting deaths worse China‚Äôs DidNt EvEn UsE TeMpORarY HoSPitAls NeW YOrk! sad I'd comfortable senator Binks charge? people charge Texas responsible COVID-19 deaths happen now. created willingly open defiance good sense majority people want. say woulda therefore subconsciously wrote would . Never life pronounced words would together speaking.

This helping you. know nothing birth, learn things along way. Sometimes learn observation, times someone teaching us. us clearly learn anything all.

This crux matter: rest life, whenever think, say, type variation should/could/would've, going think exchange.

Many decades now, leave teenage years, grow middle age, enjoy quiet, relaxing retirement that's filled time spent hobbies loved ones, going look back say smile, ""Hmm... BuffaloBoobs really solid. I'm finna look say thanks tip. probably apologize needlessly bringing race conversation multiple times."" Stay strong wear mask even idiot isn‚Äôt going mandate it. 

I‚Äôd also recommend staying public often possible given way things going die waiting room anyway, I'll take it. Fucking love Andes mints. Things getting crazy AZ. Plus, July 4th 3-day weekend next week. growth people.

Biggest myth 2020 Probably amount wind factor. there's none risky. Yet Florida Florida. blatantly false. found Tarrant County mandating masks business anyone going business county penalty. Wearing masks makes country look like Communist China. Americans. lab rats. rights prohibit forcive requirements like this. read Constitution cover cover? have. Every word. There's nothing stating governments force people wear anything. course fantastic place live. entire world functions funnel resources it. problem fantastic place live comes detriment massive number people. us ok benefitting gross ass imperialism. 0.3% 350,000,000 Americans north million deaths. herd immunity attainable (unproven) low end (60%) that‚Äôs still 600,000 dead Americans. 

Herd immunity strategy. Wearing mask reduces risk infection someone else small fraction. However, reduces risk PASSING virus significant amount. infected people wearing masks, there's like, 5% chance contagion. That's random percentage. youtube channel last week, Dr. John Campbell showed infographic explaining it. Everyone safer everyone wears masks. 6 feet separation STILL HELPS decrease 5%, especially outside.

Just remember 1% 0%. really low. saying friends, teaching background, way easier get rule following start year super strict let go. one raise hand get seat 3 months make required gonna bad time.




Same shit here. Nice explanation!! killed mayonnaise diamonds avocado toast eating monster! go spring break get people sick?! /s study mention anything patients suffering long term effects lungs virus? sounds like great news imagine people mentality ‚ÄúWhatever I‚Äôll go hospital get fixed up‚Äù realize great risk (potentially) dealing major long term health effects trade off. Houston office work home whole time. Houston based client, major chemical company - office jobs WFH. know minorities hit hardest, think reckoning large numbers whites wont social distance, wash hands wear mask. many people would die take virus seriously? Would 300,000 U.S. deaths 2020 sufficient? actually comical. USA botching beyond freaking belief. Japan like 100 cases per day 125M people  shut things again? don‚Äôt let run it‚Äôs course? I‚Äôm hard time grasping stoping society small percentage risk individuals. Shouldn‚Äôt tell individuals self quarantine let everyone go lives? personally know 4 people gotten it. older heavy set. told felt like cold week.. really worth shooting economy foot? 

This comment probably get downvoted that‚Äôs ok. point share opinion. majority people state old young feel way do. humans getting sick recovering since existed. makes different. leave.... ones already open (Universal, seaworld, bush gardens) going make close. Holy fuck! Canada 35 million people nationwide saw 380 new cases yesterday. But. ride rides many times want though everybody gets sick.... one that's projected fall moderna one BC Canada, around 8% age group, maybe big enough outbreak see number stood steady. definition little late. literally going piss batshit crazies there. Cuomo took seriously early, giving daily briefings shutting state early. early enough, turns out, DeSantis consistently downplayed threat. see hate aimed DeWine.

Bold believe corporation would give shit wellbeing customers. They'll shut state then. I'd trying get money back him. Disney roll back. don‚Äôt care DeSantis says. Dead people ruin happiest place earth vibe. don‚Äôt respect religious practices would like minimize adherence religion safety all.

Fixed ya modern version miracle loaves fishes. Jesus wanders among group hungry people magically creating extra food feed everyone saying ""God tend you."" Again, telling people God save them... FEEDING HIMSELF. point God magically cure, rescue save anyone -- sends good samaritans work them. whole basis Christianity good works administer God yourself, instead get prosperity gospel. Yup. wouldn‚Äôt surprised majority laws US level written blood. said anything zombies? Pundits!!

I mean, better 4chan kakistocracy currently controlling senate oval office. got new car fall. Totally forgot use months home. spreading virus amongst young people - bar/haircuts protests? invisible sky man real! isn't, would actually deal reality myself. wah.. wah... WAY low. People seem learning nothing. submit report county health department. Also, serve alcohol, report business ATF and/or city government issues liquor licenses. live Bay Area California. Right now, feels like I‚Äôm floating island sanity there‚Äôs world ending hurricane raging around me. Weekend reporting lags. Best look 7 day rolling average. oh already isn't, Miami heralds insta page announced many Karens coming out. Lol time collectively act March. 

People real dumb stubborn though, unfortunately gonna take LOT deaths people start taking seriously. really needed one month. One month. curve following path every country. countries took 2 months come peak peaked early April. waited early June start slow reopening, we'd great shape. no, politicized pandemic back square one. economy never going recover half country scared go bars, restaurants, gyms. Europe levels, I'd feel much comfortable going spending money, instead, I'll keep money pocket continue sit home foreseeable future. Like criminals amazing effort people put avoiding something legally. Bill Gates, conspiracy-crowd‚Äôs new George Soros. won‚Äôt listen unfortunately. incalculably stupid. Rather $500 fine, I'd like see sentenced 100 days volunteer work COVID ward local hospital. clean bed pans, change sheets, clean puke, transport patients, sit read 12 hours full PPE. refuse $1000 fine plus 30 days jail. town still bars closed southern CO someone lives area, absolutely heartbreaking infuriating see occurred Soldiers Home. Explain away 120k+ deaths (which dwarfs death toll every county) praise delayed testing seen Texans ""river rafting""... [Think ""lazy river"" amusement park, hundreds, thousands, people inner tubes slowly floating around dedicated raft coolers ice might related too.

The NYT reported couple days ago five largest Coronavirus clusters US correctional facilities. One wildest things hear American Chinese people able call cops groceries delivered them. Florida pretty much taking herd immunity route? lack clarity frustrating part. want one stop location see # tests, results, hospitalizations, icu, discharges, deaths. plotted baseline. That's like minimum governments providing. need inform policy decisions shared information. gate bridle power grabs, government overreach stomping rights. letting market decide. Good grief. middle ground wearing masks, distancing, following good hygiene. everyone this, much safely resume many/most normal activities. actually likely require complete shut public‚Äôs unwillingness anything inconvenient uncomfortable. think absolutely able say post made sure, really make sense comment got modded..  idiots MAKE politically polarizing could health issue could dealt with. start calling political hoax half country saying same, end saying people wear masks safety really oppose (and, again, idiots want show ""support"" continue trend regarding anyone's safety) then, yes, politically polarizing issue. remember Abbott changed stance good week really bad national media attention. know it‚Äôs bad #AbbottResign hot trending hashtag. plans scaling back days ago. Also, bars enough. He‚Äôs still allowing mass gatherings mandated mask wearing. I'm AZ too. alone anger despair. people lack foresight get set rules?

I hope things change soon. Tragedy overtakes stupidity eventually. Houston, problem. eagle, always eagle Tesla profitable.

They yet post annual profit (and believe one year positive cash flow mean much automotive anyway industry stop investing company), Musk received money bonuses Tesla ever made profit current stock SpaceX's finances secret, likely well.

They constantly raising money lost major air force contract surprise literally everyone. indicative well. 2500 compared Italys highest day cases beginning florida. CDC basically lists flu symptoms perfectly late January now. think normalize holding politicians responsible weird many people don't. worry. Breitbart readers told testing protests blame hoax. üòî Hand Bikini Inspector badge Holy fk! last sentence better alternatives unfortunately. 

And people vote otherwise shamed ""wasting votes"" 

So clue change theory. Horrible, happen, sad üò¢ also didnt bring MLB's plans reopen fans attendance, neither subjects topic conversation. topic conversation post wearing masks.

2. Malaria Covid. 90% Americans believe polls worthless indicators. 10% media outlet employees airlines cancel ticket tell you‚Äôre sick might corona? cousin mine positive I‚Äôve sick since Wednesday. flight Sunday Nah. 

That‚Äôs result increased testing. 

/s month ago lot people sub saying ‚ÄúFlorida fine, doomers! testing=More cases! I‚Äôm going visit grandparents retirement home today!‚Äù people found now. room meat locker, yeah maybe people know US headed towards civil war, point even trying. really practical disability medical condition would prohibit someone wearing mask still able shop / walk around

Even claim ""I can't breathe"" could get portable oxygen concentrators people limited lung capacity using decades. used mask. people trying pin blame trumba wumba....STOP IT. absolving morons attempted homicide recklessness so.

It every one responsibilities keep issue contained following proper protocols set place scientists study shit. Trump deserves punishment course, want demonize someone, demonize neighbor thinking good masks Whatever dude. Considering many are/were traveling US daily would possible came several countries? Lmao someone clearly read someone else's comment mentioned 4% figure condescending prick reason Okay, day drinking is.

I precious little else take mind bunch morons run state. Yeah, I‚Äôm kinda loving anonymity all.   Oh man it‚Äôs going going up. live Florida need stock stuff now. Stay home! read then. Jews blamed disease nothing new. Hello American, live country hates homeless people much, illegal feed government actively criminalizes homelessness. group cops shot resting homeless man target practice.

Thousands people cannot afford health care die every year.

And actively committing war crimes pandemic we're still dropping bombs children.

ICE running sex trafficking ring raping children thousands.

Our prisons run guards hold fight clubs forcing inmates murder sport.

No one cares. We're own. actually believe could reopen strategically people wore fucking mask took common sense precautions (distancing possible, etc).

Or companies *can* work home actually fucking it. entire company back office jobs 95% computers successfully operated WFH 3 months. forced come back full time safety measures cases surge state absolutely one explain need here. recklessly endangering lives sake ""tradition."" help state requirements absolutely boneless following CDC ""They're guidelines."" Biden swoop victory whoever controls take he's White House.

Piss conspiracy theory nonsense. Pussies! wait two months‚Ñ¢

Got it. lowest loosest statement possible absolutely ""most America"" buying stuff. 

The problem people (not people selling it, people believing it) sincere belief ominous forces destroy \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ they're vocal it. Two words: **air conditioning**.  I'm literally putting moving back South Florida want one screw up. Connecticut often get grace top charts. 'second wave' germany small one they're still taking precautions USA ever did. 500 cases day, that's nothing compared 40 000 US daily cases : never said that. said declare pandemic like Slovenia Montenegro soon. signed take care sick people, government weaken healthcare system work far beyond limits. passion sick children, work peds. we‚Äôre starting take adults sick refuse simple things could ended months ago. take care them, innocent people put harms way. healthcare system closer collapse might think. simply don‚Äôt ability again, longer, certainly don‚Äôt ability handle respiratory season. make sacrifices life sick people, doesn‚Äôt mean (or us) taken advantage of. theatrics anyways. ""banned"" huge asterisk. Plenty chinese flights still came u.s.  made look like something half assed. Wearing mask doesn‚Äôt stop getting virus protestors rioters wear mask smh add saying home births bad idea. lot factors outside birthing need considered going home birth. Based jux's post, makes sound like home birth end solution everyone not. We‚Äôll know 2 weeks Can't guarantee anybody win third option (Dr. Jo) anybody cannot bring one other. 

And that's I'll say that. Vote whoever believe voting's important mean ebola makes bleed.. corona makes slot. make youre something white guy south Georgia, mainly white people wearing masks, denying COVID , etc. think OP 'the south' probably there. wish country could model actions handled really well...

I wish country model actions whose government handled UBI force economy reopen...

I wish country model actions act like petulant children fined citizens wear masks... cult personality Ive seen 19% positivity rate 8.9k new cases figure. 11% people talking weekly positivity rate average? Swedish Troll Herd follows around seemed figure yet attack critics Swedish strategy, people get curious what's going worse ends them. best defense would sit quietly corner draw attention horribly failed strategy. taht seems beyond them. 

Anyway, yes, interview *interesting*. Personally found ridiculous wrote long [takedown it, cite shaming lies ""who returned Croatia Sweden May 2 plane via Frankfurt"" ja lol, even longer date article. still supposed 2m possible, hear people calling 1m now. 


I hate country. Bur he‚Äôll share away Facebook....ah freedumb Oh god. 

That's almost double yesterday. 

That's 90% increase 24 hours. 

Holy crap. Santiago-Chile, went full quarantine 2k~ cases, weeks tripled new cases (from 2k 7k cases), almost 2 months quarantine we're going 3.5-4k~ cases

I'm even sure USA states 2k-3k cases full quarantine, reason that? one looking anything, remained willfully ignorant late pathetic many levels. So... jail him? also played hard Peter Thiel et al. Classic start ""merger actually hostile take over"" plan. Yup Texas gonna uglyyyy. Complete lack political anything stop it. would required competent ""whole country"" leader. math good you? IFR (an unknowable number pandemic done) low, based current US deaths 140 million people would need infected. That's 42% entire country. Even worst hit areas seeing testing positivity rates 33% testing probable symptoms.

Just admit saw statistic liked sound somewhere, applied zero critical thinking skills, started regurgitating will. work restaurant. Trust me, people complain masks. Studies show kids main carriers speak. Thats europe many schools even require masks anymore.

How makes sense beats guess kids school look for. hope run public facing business sued lose majority BLM protestors wearing masks, I‚Äôm sure wish could stay home means watching black people get murdered camera law enforcement anything it. unfortunate protests happening middle pandemic happening trying save innocent lives. people denounced science aren‚Äôt wearing masks social distancing they‚Äôre packed grocery stores, bars, restaurants, etc. knowingly spreading virus kill people around them. mad dumbasses people trying save lives still respecting guidelines much can. think virus spreads slower rate higher temperatures also less potent then. recently saw side side comparison data page dashboard next chart releasing now.

Has anyone else seen possibly share link people see differences? worse that. People going way country prove virus threat. like lemmings   idiots think Science myth. This. Disneyland already paused opening. Disney World likely follow, thing happened back March (DL first, WDW). Yes spread throughout US. sure population. assume referring average patients? death rate??? ah, thread level. Remember W used button distract whatever going way? fun times ...

Really. upset stuff. benign. Almost nobody ever died (in US).  though...other states thing not, Florida shy 9K new cases today.  2009 pandemic? played sports 2009 Proof anti-lockdown keep saying bs.   
The easing lockdown started may 11 half Spain beginning June.         
The weekly average 2800 cases may 11; weekly average 300 3 weeks. That's call increase?       
Everybody knows lockdown declared way late. Challenge trials would really accelerate this. already 25,000 volunteers. ever say reopening wouldn‚Äôt cause cases go up? bothered leader state using word ""gonna"" 17 times press conference that's data manipulation  vaccines work. least, everyone *should* go believing. work, god damn miracle record never beaten. often takes decades develop vaccine. record right 4 years. Gonna 10k today Corruption. better...

When people realize lockdowns product virus... 

When realize virus like force nature...


When start imagining worst happen without jaded cynics suddenly using philosophy coping mechanism...

When hit bottom rise, isnt ANYTHING ELSE MENU?? Moved Florida Alabama thought moving ""up""... Definitely lateral move, best. least vote might mean something  nearly bad could though. virus lethal would pretty much end civilization know it. We're fortunate worse asymptomatic taking hospital space.

So scary spreading rapid rate (without vaccine numbers going bad re-opening matter what) think need get super depressed upset like world ending. 

It's shitty thing people dying/going die maybe wakeup call lot things ultimately side could end better world. One actual future instead countdown. *yet* Ozzie? 20k \*white\* Texans. also said lower income familys may single parent essential worker, support whilst finding someone watch children? wishful thinking say rise cases somehow turn around days.

Considering state governments much anything federal government pretends issue, things likely get much worse states NY. NY see numbers like 10 days mandating pretty strict lockdown. Since done states, think continue see rise cases. Things going get bad next couple days hospitals fill up. insinuating people like shitshow florida fine shit show NY? America, people OK upset shit show's. thing makes way ""lolitics"" comment.   love people catching ineptitude politicians? Watch report two deaths number. There‚Äôs probably GOP manual titled ‚ÄòHow Cook Covid Books‚Äô available Official Trump Store. That's really reason people hated lol ""Just like that, poof, it'll gone"" TN. I'm damn tired.  one cared care now. They're supposed stay home sake people also free somehow. Fair enough, guess getting don‚Äôt fully understand badly catching could effect body long term, even younger generation. agree need semblance normalcy moving forward, it‚Äôs ppl shrugging common cold, fact, don‚Äôt know enough yet 

Best bet usual, wear damn masks ;) honor heroes. Shit like pisses off. new science-backed data shows asymptomatic-but-positive cases definitely contagious certain amount time? expenses higher small businesses. local mom pops, literally family run businesses, much overhead is. save electrical maybe single part-time employee two pad things out, still worth go belly couple months.

I #ReOpen type, really feel folks spent last 30 years building something up, right things, screwed. height processing almost 11k less 36 hours, roughly 1600 tests per million.

The recent get Florida 29,000 tests 6/14, 1,350/mil. don‚Äôt know 7 day wait accurate- is, it‚Äôs completely unacceptable considering twice long figure shit out. Welcome food service Fair question. would definitely contend heat feels oppressive much consistent basis here. think northern cities get hot that's usually temporary (up week). heat index routinely nears exceeds 100 degrees peak summer. Whether much materially hotter, dont know.

I think another factor would that, experience, restaurants dont much outdoor seating set up, used often. Maybe dont go right places. I'd say cultural/structural difference too, maybe. maybe I'm used suburbs biasing opinions.

We rely ac ton. cars, homes, jobs, eat.

Regardless think would ineffective stage make meaningful impact containment/supporting business tradeoff.

Just thoughts, anyways. bucks 6 completely stopped wearing bras like 5 years ago. time wear cami layer sweater something (work usually cold). also certain shirts ""safe"" (too loose patterned notice tit shape, I'm wearing couple layers anyway). even someone noticed nipple, justify remembering wearing bras centimeters thick still often left outline/shape showing due consistent cold work. Thank practice infection control. epic something useful gonna that.   shit Bill Gates trying agriculture seems pretty villainous. mean, guy also found guilty heinous monopoly practices court law. think always skeptical philanthropists make switch they‚Äôve accumulated billions capital markets dating back Carnegie Rockefeller. It‚Äôs kind exciting! husband works film industry he‚Äôs work since March. industry starting things go well hubby starts work August 31st. Wahoo! stupid stupid ps. never said anything herd immunity. quoting data Election lies ahead severity situation increasing, would disastrous consequences would choose something it.

Yes...imagine elected official negligent? Hard imagine. s/ Well hopefully die soon longer spout nonsense Co-worker tested positive (I personally never came contact with) minor symptoms. tested negative earlier month, stroke Monday. underlying health conditions, he's 40. can't say sure connected, way attacks nervous system really makes wonder.  see. they're spread across US though right? I'm trying see what's ""population"" there's comparison states counties. put hands down, once? bet waves sleep. feds use whatever states give them. states use PCR tests PCR tests accurate method detecting active disease. use serological tests, inevitably count anyone who‚Äôs ever immune response virus. No, testing gone way up, deaths still going down. irony calling someone else dense, lol. don‚Äôt specialist understand basic logic first every subsequent glance appeared bad idea:

A bad thing happening 

It‚Äôs rate happening increases relation number people around other

Rules put place decrease number people around other

The current rate increasing despite efforts rate increase slowed response rules

The rules lifted part new plan lower rate increase

The question is:

‚ÄòWill rate increase?‚Äô Looking dashboard, seems stopped even pretending contact trace. Contract tracing currently lowest. know rhetorical felt like I'd add little point. already took 12 weeks offered FFCRA. Essentially, he's leaving good terms they're paying vacation. We'll see there, employer definitely wants back whenever would willing. That‚Äôs assuming EVERYONE catches coronavirus around time.
And it‚Äôs still pretty good figure spread number years.
Why negative?
Like I‚Äôm cautious anyone this, haven‚Äôt socialising, wear masks even outdoors exercising, see point getting overly terrified virus know enough about.
Death inevitable point. thousands diseases spreading time, hundreds cancers develop.
I believe social distancing lockdowns necessary, test trace necessary.
Living fear not. scared death natural it‚Äôs unhealthy consumed by. death rate low. Let comfort. oh literal zombies whew Hey know Grauls! husband worked high school. Good place good people  I'll respond comment:

I feel situation worse. testing way people right month two ago likely catching many cases previously were. We've also seen doctors get better treating patients even curing virus itself. hospitals prepared handle surge back March April we've seen 2 months data get better predicting surge happen. also seeing younger people get infected right means likely see less deaths previous. 


Additionally: also know send positive patients back nursing homes apparently obvious first time. true, dumbest motherfuckers anywhere live here. Hence misquote... emergency fund fault government bail Yeah, think timeline makes sense getting started China October started Europe late December. takes couple months things ramp noticeable level, especially beginning outbreak know look for. Oh, meant don‚Äôt get food packaging isn‚Äôt risk even though evidence virus lasts cardboard, plastic, etc see bars Tampa. Wall wall idiots. thankfully shut today. I'm staying fuck home forever. Sucks live country governors make best decision last possible second we're proud them. standards low Honestly shocked people start striking hospital. willing help yourself, expect others put lives line? country selfish people time pay Piper. cant remember last time plane completely full, except rare times someone missed flight. see huge change normal practices, total response virus, shocking. spent 4.5 months pandemic Vietnam. Vietnam 350 cases total 0 deaths whole pandemic least 100 Vietnamese people repatriated countries, quarantined immediately upon arrival Vietnam. little community transmission.
 reason simple. People Vietnam openly wear face masks air quality poor due motor bike exhaust. Vietnam borders china. Tens thousands Chinese people came Wuhan Chinese new year holiday end January border China open mid March. Ho Chi Minh, city 9 million people, densely populated. masks work litterally millions people infected. Masks prevent droplets. wear mask protect others, reciprocal. Americans foolish selfish think freedoms. There's freedoms pandemic. scientific BS that... BS. unpopular question, 100% support protests, one talking protests possibly main driver uptick?  Bar hopping help, really mass protests contributor? data source track this?  kids still risk death COVID. Statistically low, sure, 1 100 dies, that's still LOT dead kids. kids permanent physical damage. kids psychological damage possibly reason people die. reasons protect people disease risk them. Right. That‚Äôs spurred first time right? March Madness cancelled, Disney shut down, etc. actually high-altitude sickness!""

Also, answered questions got, ‚ÄúYou qualify testing time.‚Äù

So, no, absolutely available anyone, definitely teenagers 18 (the topic here) still available symptomatic people. Hadnt heard before, banquet Jan 18, Wuhan instituted super strict lockdown jan 23. US stay home order many states nothing like that. Many Americans floured restrictions refuse wear masks all. 

China also isolated EVERY case, whereas US, mild cases sent back home potentially infect families. current airplane attire: M2.5, [ESS + [gasket rock ESS + gasket b/c already eyepro...I may look like [PC hey...we wearing masks...who cares look like point. happening September 5th one that. simply pointing blood donations tested HIV. Conservamedia making stink month. new Benghazi frankly they've got whine about. insinuation makes huge assumptions. compiled tally find many COVID-19 patients **discharged hospitals** nursing homes

Discharged, hospitals make habit discharging contagious people ICU. know experience elder care facilities dealt 4 parents. Larger ones dozens workers, aides, chefs, servers, cleaning people, nurses, doctors, office workers, maintenance etc. None live site. go home, many public transportation.

Do thought exercise. What's likely vector transmission, released elderly patient already passed disease recovery process, low paid cleaning person takes train work every day, goes room room touching things every room may never tested due test kit shortages?

Discharged older patients leave hospital. get hang declared healthy. Consevamedia screeches sent Javitts. parent, would want that? live city? get there, 4 hour ambulance ride?  study done conclude vectors additional transmission. one does, call political posturing. Well I'll damned. hospital? article: ""Gov. Ron DeSantis state federal leaders continue point increased testing cause rise new cases day."" Falling ladder hurts, regardless whether believe gravity.

Closing bars seems little late. need close amusement parks, bowling alleys, gyms, movie theaters, places worship, indoor dining well least. enforce masks!  Ok. I'm really starting freak hell out. put ties sides shield tie behind neck. Works well. didn‚Äôt pass bill, clearly isn‚Äôt. ü§£ San Francisco. Lots places get tested. say attended protest. Also- pretty much everyone wearing masks. wouldn‚Äôt dream going quick errand without one. that‚Äôs we‚Äôre doing- quick essential errands. went BLM protests threatened African American lives purpose opinion. taken deadly virus already often obese impoverished communities. 

Protesters honestly probably killed Black communities cops white supremacists combined. repeat 1918 flu gets named Spain disclosed first

First tge virus Europe NY type C strain D614G, strain isnt found China, mutatedat one 2 places.

We also know virus naturally double every 2 days, meaning NY's rapid growth testing ramp rate rather spread, actual NY infection started much earlier.

Just going case genetic evidence jury still Europe spread NY NY spread Europe.

What know Trump 100% order coverup (hes even pretending anymore), first place report always gets assiciated orgin. 

So unfortunate truth coverup pays, pretending virus dosnt exist might lead 130k dead date, certainly made sure US dosnt look like orgin, least outside scientif community certainly looks like oponion this. say anything anti-business, comment priorities.

The sad truth Trump promised Trump hotels Mississippi Tater Tot deep, deep Tump's ass Reeves (Who trash this) propagating Trump's ignorance wasnt holy shit  bright side, US identified 25% world's cases even though 4% population. amazing feat testing! Also, mobility increases exposure poorer countries fewer people traveling abroad catch disease foreign lands. 40,000 nursing home residents already wiped out. might agree protests long ago, tests still inaccessible people milder symptoms, free testing programs specifically protestors cities, Minneapolis 1.4% protestors tested positive. It‚Äôs hard say whether higher would expect people gave people opportunity get free tests, definitely doesn‚Äôt indicate protests superspreading apologize retrospect clear! think? we‚Äôre talking protesting...you know, like states 7% positive rate.

Stuff takes time show statistics. expect 2-3 weeks even bigger spike cases, biggest might say, due protests. 44% people whose vote weight 56%. **The facts:**

Elon South African first generation post-apartheid white man, whose family owns emerald mine (and operated like slave mine Apartheid). Grew only-white Pretoria, wealthy family immigrants.

They *moved* SA beginning apartheid *left* right ended.

He studied racist xenophobic high school SA, even Afrikaans considered inferior.

**Interlude: Elon's daddy issues**.

If ask Elon who's evil motherfucker planet Earth, say father, hesitation. true. Musk patriarch breed apart regards evil deeds thoughts, point ""Elon got rich emerald mine"" moot, since Elon brother cut ties (and disowned) daddy young age, way initial successes.

Elon Musk might crazy, cleptocrat dressed like ""entrepreneurial genius"", one thing sure despises SA roots, since interwoven person hates world.

**Facts 2, baby!**

In bathrooms Tesla's factory often swastikas stall walls. N word heard shouted white employees towards black colleagues.

People also saying US hospitals calling Covid get $13K case, realizing bargained amount designed keep insurance costs down. Lol number damn low terrifying. 

Less month ago, Florida averaging ~600 new cases/day. Two weeks ago, ~1200. protests generally outdoors. highly highly unlikely spread outdoors. also US, so... also live upstate New York smallish town.

Here matters.

Even reopen economy, half people country comfortable going returning places business think safe reopening handled responsibly... reopening going matter much. Businesses still make enough get by.

Public health crises like one require mass adoption compliance, depends public support. masks pushed encouraged day 1 federal government, clear consistent message. federal government actively encouraged states impose stringent short-term shutdown. testing stepped much earlier.

These steps require public compliance actively undermined federal government, we're seeing consequences. 56% people think reopening effectively safely conducted, reopening going matter anyways. ***""Some may die, sacrifice willing make.""*** \- Lord Farquaad. right, fixed it. issue, shutdowns aren‚Äôt one size fits solution. worked Europe won‚Äôt necessarily work without causing harm good society runs differently.

Yeah trying claim federal issue, sorry came across way. opinion winner take drowns lot voices states go things like Maine Nebraska doing. liberal parts south conservative parts coasts, get crushed every election goes swing states. 

And number electors equal number house seats (based roughly population stated) senate seats combined. Right, Med Center probably reduced number elective surgeries, like hospitals, free capacity.

So ICU beds may scarce, overall capacity still high, correct? There‚Äôs imminent risk anyone turned away.

This headline meant panic inducing. It‚Äôs misleading point disingenuous Sure, 195 countries dealing virus, news media, colluding affect US election. think George almost everyday. huge influence existence upon planet. Saw live least 3 times. dad 12 13 years old. dad loved too.

""When born get ticket freak show. born America, get front row seat"" 95% also couldn‚Äôt wait get state officially announced re-opening. nothing. Lockdown required get immediate threat lessened, amount virus floating around safe level, open masks, distancing, etc. ride there. lockdowns meant flattern curve avoid overwhelming healthcare system caution thrown wind upon reopening, work got thrown away essentially... there's proper way shit aggressive reopening made it'll significantly longer return normal. fucked pandemic timeline. looking October / November recovery *if* went complete shutdown tomorrow. United States reopen strategy built sound bite easily tweeted shown single picture (level 1, RED, etc) lot nuanced contextualized. 

Local leaders given maximum flexibility respond new data. Businesses follow social distancing guidelines relatively low risk. Data showing 10% infected people infected 80% people. 

Churches bars (like Texas) never reopened, sent signal danger clearly wasn‚Äôt. 1 person COVID singing could infect whole room. 1 drunk person stumbling around bar could infect everyone there. 

Wear mask, keep distance people, stay home coughing sick, wash hands every time pass sink. Don‚Äôt go clubbing. Don‚Äôt go bar hopping.

Well can. Absence evidence evidence. factor ""well everyone knows Sweden cases identified"" argument hear say. evidence based organisation work evidence provided. Sweden testing low numbers affect WHO's judgement. point Sweden want classified manner, testing finding positive cases sooner. Especially say, everyone knew testing them. Here‚Äôs story you. daughter recently met group parents small private school discuss way reopening handled. met outside, masks giant circle. Many kids present, wearing masks, running around yard. kids hadn‚Äôt seen since March. didn‚Äôt take long one parents realized kids sneaking around side house hug other!!!! Aaaahhhhh! kids like 7-10 yrs. old. don‚Äôt think social distancing happening schools. Make marijuana federally legal. Lots revenue job creation. Even people smart safe home orders seem throwing caution wind well. It‚Äôs like everyone figured threat must bars restaurants open. learning disability? two different neighbors planning go beach Pensacola end July. think it‚Äôs bad idea. seeing far tourism think look like 4 weeks? worldometer.info restated deaths US 6/24 124K 126K. believe actually 2,000 deaths...anyone know what's going on? using different data source reliable info? Thanks. Seriously.  I've biking get shape. Ordered eagle crank old truck budget looking decent. That's lost overtime. people sorts things avoid scenarios.

You seatbelt laws, traffic lights, national system understandable signals, safety standards vehicles, licenses, registrations, insurance. I‚Äôm sick people acting like fact still car accidents somehow negates horrible things. entire system based around fact cars dangerous! another reason needed shut quickly- give medical system time learn unfortunates got anyway.

A pity that. needs replaced fairly often nothing.

Which people probably do. really using Sweden, country nearly 50% deaths per capita US, shining example handle things? 

The economy US absolutely operate lockdown. Look outside bubble office jobs. number sounds large, much life one deaths steal victims average? causes death like auto accidents kill far fewer less per year, yet still represent larger threat American lifespans Covid-19. meaningless ""non-random"" equally across board. feel bad front line people deal morons refuse wear masks every day. I'm masked work venture out. anywhere besides work grocery store 4 fucking months. I'm part wish everyone would same. again, even are, anyway comparable US number reasons. can‚Äôt see you‚Äôre complete fool. 

Regardless, many people pandemic begin with? 1. good luck preventing single person contracting many years come. That's thing. 

Unless talking accelerationists. fringe minority minority. live northern Mississippi. growth county shown last two weeks alarming. went like 700 cases 1100 200 cases last 4 days. People still aren‚Äôt wearing masks everything wide open schools still planning open even though multiple sports teams throughout county shut summer workouts two weeks positive cases. Mississippi going get reaaaalll bad per capita. horribly misguided take. 

Yes, things stacked towards mega-wealthy they've seen nothing gains entire crisis. 

However, would magical thinking believe indefinite shutdown would affect people afford ride indefinitely. 

Shutdowns costly, letting virus spread unimpeded. assessing risks making smart policy decision. Yeah people realize breathing fresh outside air kill XD safer spending money boat small desalination plant...

and bait freezer.


then need fish day, drink desalinated ocean water, get tan. stupid complaint. need allow feel whatever we‚Äôre feeling. getting ready turn 30, moms birthday two days later. celebrate together every year. I‚Äôm definitely bummed 30th won‚Äôt expected, feel robbed yearly celebration mom. understand you‚Äôre feeling.

Don't forget going back cinema. Plenty people frothing mouth return movies soon yellow tape cut. ""Muh cinema muh church tho! Plus they'll taking safety measurements, therefore it'll totally okay!""

We're fucked. That‚Äôs point, though. People saying lockdowns unreasonable. won‚Äôt listen existence lockdown proof severity they‚Äôre distrusting institutions science first place.  Maybe it‚Äôs time dress like pimp, ultimate ninja disguise lot people sick weeks virus, many suffer life-long damage. Post-covid-syndrome thing. Lol 20 month old say ""Bah bah BAH bah"". might need look speech therapy... Nursing students doubly screwed, also lost clinical placements. I'm sure also true healthcare fields. Thanks dose truth depression Friday friend! :( live 8405', nobody within 15 miles (several thousand people) tested positive. say evidence really mixed confusing. 

When article says fewer cases, mean fewer people severe symptoms, since surely really contact tracing bothering test mild symptoms. believe evidence spreads slower high elevation. Perhaps single largest per capita US outbreak March Crested Butte, elevation 8900'. 

But mortality seem like might lower. Maybe. Colorado great data, really break things fully county. ski towns seem really low deaths, except one 0.34% town died - every death nursing home. could actually 90% deaths nursing homes - anecdotes know source of. 

There multiple explanations, way pick them. course keep coming back symptoms mimic altitude sickness. Even best treatment now, dex, drug used HAPE/HACE.

My best guess, though, descending lower elevation treatment significantly improves outcomes. Austria, hardest-hit town 40% infected, implied 0.2% IFR - nearest hospital appears 1500' lower elevation. 

It's also likely lower obesity better cardiovascular shape simply acquired walking hills improves outcomes. directly tied elevation, correlated - people poor countries live high altitude walk lot. appreciate response, think ""little habits"" world going anything curb virus see actual evidence anything we've done actually done good. ?  I‚Äôm denying outbreaks underway. don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs deadly majority people always going happen. going happen everywhere else it‚Äôs surprise it‚Äôs reality what‚Äôs going happen there‚Äôs vaccine. like 10,000,000 people US ~70% exposed. Ten million alot resources. really feel nation's healthcare workers. favor *try* stay healthy everybody. thought guys never closed? Yeah, going list considerations like bathrooms, break rooms, cubicles, talking phone masks, etc. like uhhhhhh we're okay though??

Plus, sent us home equipment (at least two monitors tower per person) hassle can't see risking again. Especially there's case office react. 

I really, really, really want commute more. Miami?

It be. bet enforced equally. 

They going writing $500 tickets places like Liberty City Little Haiti. 

But rich folks live Miami Beach, yeah probably gleefully enforced there.

A lot people live South Florida realize much Miami *dirt poor*. pointless write tickets going pay. Increased circulation; think? call Florida ""America's Wang"" nothing. üôÑ US still taking seriously, know distance learning option fall teacher probably kids school get extras like music art. 

(Last part makes sense)

but since everyone hated emergency dustance learning, info changes, look good.

Their survey negatives hybrid distance learning, negatives traditional five day week.

I can't tell poorly written designed encourage five day week, mask, traditional option. California growing some, Texas spiking alarming rate. Plus, places California causing new cases conservative suburbs LA.

It's political. Agreed. even take moment waft farts toward nose quality control lift mask little. Yup, government still denying cases existed Dilley family detention center attorneys saying weeks COVID-positive clients there. This, plus average age positive cases going down, like 25-34 age group, means less likely die. Feds need give aid state local governments. feds print money borrow 10 years 0.7%.

Trust me...my sympathy anyone family disappeared thank jackasses like virus.  Said everyone like you, every day, past four months.

Buckle up. We'll get States strict rules around mask usage, exactly. We're talking rules around mask usage, we're talking protests happened nationwide, seeing nationwide spikes. Please explain hundreds thousands people crowding streets month *doesn't* contribute spike? He‚Äôs crook deserves punished. Waving Florida NY mask on.... Yes, new news, old news, controversial. change anything. 70 million people 60 USA. Thank you, want give person real response. Seemed like brainier People won‚Äôt even answer phone Ajit Pai‚Äôs dumbass somehow flooded country scam callers Oh, they'll enforce it. gives cops Miami ammunition PD needs collect revenue. Coral Gables? Maybe not. Doral? Hialeah? They'll probably ticket wearing mask improperly, mouth Doral PD break femur.  It‚Äôs good logic. idea catch outbreak community gets kinds numbers. pooling work NYC already know antibodies. wonder 4 July effect something We'll start looking countries schools open they're managing it. course, countries also likely much lower infection rates US, everything copied. already far cases every single state necessary ‚Äúseed‚Äù outbreak. utterly failed contain every imaginable level, it‚Äôs really late now. point thing matters political change regulations enforce social behaviors allow people stay home work, stay apart other, last resort thing left sadly, wearing cloth masks slightly reduce expelled aerosols. Right headlines constantly of, ""is soon go out?"" usual commentary reply was, ""we find weeks.""

14 days automatic anything. That's early research that's gone.  spikes combination Memorial Day reopens coupled failure wear masks.  gotten severe week hospitals never thought they'd get people, adequately underfunded staffed. Thus spiraling control. next, functioning society? Awesome, best luck hubby! reading soap opera Bold Beautiful starting production L.A. Lots rules: temperature wellness checks regularly, everyone set must wear mask times except on-camera talent filming, staggered call times biggest takeaway kissing/sex scenes filmed use actor's significant others and/or blowup dolls!

We entered Phase 2 couple days ago Toronto, last major city continent so. Fingers crossed things go well follow lead bringing life back semblance normalcy. people Houston figured masks go mouth ***and*** nose, wear mouth chin, like Georgia? Don‚Äôt listen bs people, it‚Äôs fake news, increased testing... feel free go shopping, visit local restaurants, without mask. fine real estate investors waiting property become vacant. confirm. I‚Äôm Boston people wearing masks, going out, working home. We‚Äôre going dinner patio outdoors, first time we‚Äôve restaurant since February. lowest rate country currently. see coronavirus there. heard ventilators great caused damage. think Americans know Quarantine means. heard two people tested positive Aunt works called make sure fine isolating, said ""yeah I'm isolating, I'm Wendys nieces lunch, I'm going go back home."" knew since couple days beforehand like got news either... Well CDC states overall average death rate 0.26% regardless age. 

Now know potentially infections could 10 fold, theoretically could decrease death rate 10 fold. I‚Äôm downplaying virus means, world governments handled nursing care homes slaughterhouse, disaster. poor baby Sure bigger factor still think factor now. Correct I'm wrong people feel symptoms currently banging doors testing facilities. We're going next sports year. takes literally ONE positive grounds worker trainer... back home y'all. 
2020 ""Lost Year"" quicker start act like want something it, quicker reasonably get back life knew form. would involve actually something administration hates that. Oh right!  That‚Äôs good do, local stations. Helps out. one lesson I've heard large groups people never learn fucking lesson don‚Äôt see would baffled. Rodney king happened here. Hurricane Katrina. We‚Äôve mess long time. responses awful Huh? What? John Hopkins University days it‚Äôs 0.5% people 60. Texas's response behind New York's several ~~days~~ months 

Not like Texas see happened NY two months ago. sent Hernando County Health department tested Telemedicine video chat. expecting it, thought might severe sinus issue. I'm asthmatic experiencing 5+days severe headache, fatigue muscle aches well. line cars/trucks testing alarming well. Oh gawsh High quality, fact-based journalism! last time German government tracked minorities ethnicity, things go well. Nah, KKK, known lighting crosses fire terrorizing black people, actually deeply Christian organization.

The cross prefer called Cross St. Peter, upside down. ""See frown? Turn cross upside-down!"" PS, watching ‚Äúnews‚Äù likens bearing brain concrete wall trying figure headache. I‚Äôll keep mine off, enjoy yard, family, everything else left positive thankful for. stir front news want. mind virus go away people avoided getting measures taken? 

Because mind see EVERYONE planet eventually getting virus you‚Äôre either going survive die complications. Could take many years everyone finally pass recover it. precautions simply slowing inevitable. We'll probably see big number tomorrow, followed relatively small (but still big) number Sunday Monday. expect see north 10,000 tomorrow 5 7 thousand per day early next week. spread continues unmitigated, surprised see 20,000 cases per day mid July. Ha. obviously live here. go indoors hottest times year. Rona LOVES indoor air conditioning. afaik unlikely Chinese vax get approved tested U.S. ... Yup. we‚Äôd aggressive testing tracing etc get go could saved enormous numbers lives also economy Thanks info. Media hyper focused states right now. saw Palermo NYC right? happen city live back then? could have... hear second wild speculation... come bronchitis? terms enforcing wearing masks indoors, would far effective implement steep fines businesses serve unmasked customers indoors threaten individuals fine wearing mask. serving unmasked customer indoors incur $1k fine, public spaces want people wearing masks take enforcement hands.

Of course public transit, enforcement would still target individuals...  appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Good know! virus last long porous surfaces like paper cardboard. lick stamps! Use adhesive-stamps prepaid postcards. Mail away! mean studying long term effects covid, comparing causes deaths life expectancy?
I would equally interested seeing covid19 patients reduced life expectancy later obviously would really long term study keep **6 feet** others. cloth face cover **not substitute** social distancing.

Why crowded mass gatherings also N95 masks, even cloth masks, one-way valves make easier breathe through. valve releases **unfiltered** air wearer breathes out, type mask **doesn't** prevent wearer spreading virus. reason, places banned them.

The rest places ban pandemic over, least *informing* people would go long way prevent easily overlooked flaw sabotaging mask efforts. Palm Beach County, meeting pass mask mandate, woman named Whitney, essential worker according article read, got said mask order ended anti-mask speech front public, county commission, saying wear mask reason wear underwear...""Because things gotta breathe"". stupidity like that, wonder South Florida seeing cases go roof. instructions virus, newly infected cell sprouts multi-pronged tentacles studded viral disfigured zombie cells appear using streaming filaments, filopodia, reach still-healthy neighboring cells. protuberances appear bore cells‚Äô bodies inject viral venom directly cells‚Äô genetic command centers ‚Äî thus creating another zombie. *Bio-Posadists 5 houses little street already sold year, 2 undergoing significant facelifts suspect they're sell too. usually big deal 1 family moves. Something done. much relevant early pandemic testing increased significantly people known exposures tested without symptoms. I‚Äôm horrified live Abilene right now. city council meeting last night one city council members said masks useless mayor said Abbot‚Äôs initial shutdown intense. see video yourself: need new leadership!!! ZERO confidence guide us storm.  You‚Äôre right. They‚Äôre protected around 30k tests today.. get 100k confirmed one week they‚Äôd need positivity rate almost 50%. guess reported numbers hang around 8-10k day, 30% still stupid high positivity rate.. 

They‚Äôve 4 months get together.. 6 wanna go back absolute start. incompetence mind boggling

Ninja edit: even can‚Äôt confirm virus, doesn‚Äôt mean won‚Äôt 100k new cases next week. won‚Äôt *know* them... Maybe city city. Hampton / Newport news. work long term care facility I'm pretty aware does/ mask shop. fair, avoid plagues Walmart big box places intentionally rn. eat out. It‚Äôs sad need know exactly? Hey man, Trump-supporting mom SC finally acknowledged virus something concerned with! said turned around day favorite beauty store packed shoulder shoulder. progress!

Of course, explanation massive spike SC protestors, ""black community, diabetes hypertension"", ""out state tourists"", everyone before, must someone else's fault.

As ashamed mom way, people talking actually think. blame always fall someone else. happen Chelan Douglass county? We‚Äôve lost 124,000 Americans needlessly. Every projection number 200,000 beginning October. people families, friends, kids grandkids. idea biggie absolutely astounding. 

We got 124,000 deaths 2 months lockdown. think going happen numbers economy reopens? 

I testing COVID antibodies community. well aware risks thing. don‚Äôt know care anybody risk factors death thing, don‚Äôt know sad happy you. That‚Äôs original tends become dominated powermods (look /r/PublicFreakouts example). accountability whatsoever mods Reddit, solution ever given ‚Äúgo create another sub‚Äù. 

Typically, mentioning alternative sub banned original. way it‚Äôs existence even becomes known word-of-mouth, users sending PMs users We‚Äôre silenced and/or banned mods. Incidentally exactly /r/freefolk started stayed 5,000 users first years. 

The problem begin aggregating difficult people original sub. You‚Äôre getting people fed moderator power abuse, you‚Äôre also getting people breaking rules sometimes rules involve specific narrative sometimes involve basic decency. Also, inevitably group started new sub creates clique mods people knew old sub, short order become bad worse ones trying get away from.

To give idea, one freefolk mods known abusing users verbally, implementing crazy rule changes pissed everybody purpose enjoyment, making comments sexualizing minors, banning anyone tried criticize post screenshots abusive modmail responses. petition removed 97% approval taken down. Eventually, mods would carry theater year would pretend ‚Äúban‚Äù would re-join mod team new username week later. group people claimed creating refuge mod power abuse. 

The whole create new sub thing solution, work. need system moderators accountable. course without chance powers elevated everybody else without accountability, Reddit would hard time getting unpaid volunteers bulk work site work school Department... I‚Äôm honestly terrified.  predictive models. worse case scenario 95% population gone. 

Best case, mirror Spanish Flu deaths. 

Feel comes back Mother Nature, pissed big time, it‚Äôs payback. 

My first posts warnings late January, downvotes relentless. good ELI5! Convenient going big lies lol think it'll less bad would've April. probably asymptomatic mild cases detected, older vulnerable people going make smaller percentage sick population know risks self-isolate typically so. Plus, treatments lot better.

It's still going disaster unnecessary one too. I'm Georgia, bad slightly less bad Texas, I'm watching hospitalized numbers go ICU availability go down. Even fewer deaths result going stress hospital system, probably going cause long-term damage people, yeah, going deaths could've avoided social distancing mask wearing. Ok I‚Äôm going beat you:

We‚Äôve never cases day. Boom. win. true. like looking forward next war :( Holy shit even alive? ever go hospital wait home? Really? think someone COVID came house let responsible is? That's really claim here? 

It's clear sick, need stay home quarantine *yourself*. Going around people's rooms inviting really bad, irresponsible behavior regardless whether take it, fault primarily shoulders sick person ignoring common sense decency. Praying essential nurses doctors staff. guys dont deserve this. all. sorry someone NJ/NY area. Keep fighting. missed point. Yes, I‚Äôm US. Yes, area (Metro Detroit - Michigan) worst. I‚Äôm saying is, see tv isn‚Äôt that‚Äôs happening. US ‚Äúliving hell‚Äù must nothing worse. hear north korea nice time year - go check real estate. That‚Äôs living hell.

Downvote away, don‚Äôt care. hardcore Reddit user. part Plandemic! tried Washington state. Several county police officers fine people... course, population. Proportionally Florida more, knew posted this

Not mention excess deaths pneumonia deaths same. Good try though CLOOOOOOOOOOSE! Texas even position act like total fuckwits reopen early. Thanks thoughtful response! mind highlights bigger issue public health infrastructure unprepared something like this. health infrastructure prepared something like would need worry less flattening curve due larger capacity available. Makes realize society bigger problems can‚Äôt handle bunch people getting sick time. thank response. appreciate insight :) Florida fallen Getting better utilizing ventilators. know. Since California also really bad saying. earth get that?

My point solution everyone, therefore continue look solutions. (I even saying this, end poster made be.)

Why angry? attributed opinion even mine get angry sarcastic about. teacher mother. thinking kids. POINTS: JPMorgan analyzed data 30 million Chase cardholders Johns Hopkins University‚Äôs case tracker found higher restaurant spending state predicted rise new infections three weeks later. **In-person restaurant spending ‚Äúparticularly predictive.‚Äù** Conversely, higher spending supermarkets predicted slower spread virus.

Honestly hard eat takeout delivery? happens combine democracy low funding education. idiots electing idiots. vastly likely sample March 2019 contaminated.  think ONE stimulus check sent since whole thing began three months ago. 

This government rude awakening people taken care of, happen quick. government politicized pandemic, nothing divides Americans fictitious political parties.

It's stopping pandemic anymore. even right anymore. strictly side wrong. Nothing matters disagreeing side, whatever may they're saying. failing prepare, prepare fail DeSantis, chief ""Florida Man""  means eat avocado toast... obviously can't wear mask eating... logic sound! don't- care backlash appearances. last thing need associated mouse plague. 

Disney already pushed reopening Disneyland Anaheim. Start finding new job. going get shut real quick rate. I‚Äôm surprised too. Pretend it. 
I cyna flu, like flu... Oh, yeah. don‚Äôt either. Seems like would common sense. no, idiot. There‚Äôs thing nuance life, complaining boss sexually harassing you, leave darn job. Pull bootstraps, entitled boss isn‚Äôt raping you. leave job, apply another bothers much! MAGA! feel represented like lol. nearly 10 kg February May spent lot quarantine time practicing baking none exercising. Turns I'm pretty good baker tbf.

Already lost 5 kg since end May since go exercise gyms open, still dont fit many pre-quarantine tshirts someone NJ, governor awesome COVID response, neighboring states. Notably, tri-state area (NY, NJ, CT) fully coordinated responses since March, three governors well nearby states PA, MA, RI often joint press conferences COVID.

There's reason area US one area reducing new incidence COVID cases... Eastern Washington south past OLY? Exactly. there‚Äôs way confirm person I‚Äôm speaking actually ‚Äúqualified‚Äù contact tracer don‚Äôt get questions answered. deal far many people scammed real money falling phishing schemes. 

If they‚Äôre calling should‚Äôve confirmed phone number first. services this; assume governments don‚Äôt want pay them. live Saskatchewan Canada one places started reopen. seemingly gave dumb idea provinces states safe, even consider circumstances. small amount research would shown population small spread never many covid cases begin with. Wasn‚Äôt plot Legend? really incredible accurate epidemiologists' predictions beginning. Lots respect discipline. Along like thousands viruses bacteria...Jesus panic headlines getting desperate report by.

Solution...don't fuqing drink waist water ...and bleach matter


Actually second thought...don't take word anything here...live lives lmao to, it‚Äôs fault are. TV could make look packed careful use camera angles. great, want scrap entirely, whatever they'd replace with, guarantee far, far worse.

This admin done *anything* exemplary / well. did. Instead eating fairly large lunch company cafeteria another large-ish dinner I‚Äôm smaller lunch dinner. first couple months lost weight I‚Äôm back left March.  live metro Atlanta, governor head firmly wedged Trump's backside. gotta say, mighty relieved learn held Atlanta, I'm sure governor eagerly offering up.

Though I'm sorry city. ever loving fuck year They‚Äôre 10% rise cases.

The said limit 5%!

And even Abbott acknowledged 10%, still called ‚Äúwarning flag.‚Äù Dude, ‚Äúwarning‚Äù long past due. Florida never wave begin with, first wave. anyone going refuse go back office company tells to?

I actually like working home. Europe, find insane wearing mask office going common (seems common factories reason). Sitting enclosed space dozens people poor ventilation know recipe disaster. I'm convinced every western country get second wave this. percentage population really going protests? 1%? 

What percent population gone restaurant, hair cut, back work? 30%?

I‚Äôm guessing numbers, get point everything part bat sh@t crazy conspiracy people? yes, UN estimates 125 million deaths critically impoverished peoples coming year, due economic downturn caused Covid19, primary US EU donations charities get hit hard economics recessions. appears misleading, people counted Covid pneumonia. Trumps needs fire Fauci hire yes-man lie numbers. Fear virus worse virus itself. able afford live continues on. Also people wearing masks. see 100+ people every single day walking around without. work pretty closely brewery Houston they've told us TABC high alert businesses compliance, apparently fucking around. know Florida gets knocked lot, still feel bad them... awful.   What's point? purpose testing make decisions.

If symptoms, stay home self isolate. trouble breathing, go hospital. symptoms, wear mask I'm room people (except home). Test result changes none that. knew bit trouble formulated ""reopening team"" placed banker charge it, instead epidemiologist. apparently $600 per week extra comparable $500 fuckin billion üòÇ 

$3,500 month nothing dumbass. 

hell that's multiple times better Canada. 

you made seem like people live 1200 stimulus check that's fucking wrong. I'm calling bullshit omission. eventually vaccine. also get better treating patients four times less likely die April, Oxford study finds

Getting later better getting earlier. mind see EVERYONE planet eventually getting virus you‚Äôre either going survive die complications. 

Lots countries driven transmission virus person less one person. 

Also, that's simply things work. everyone world got polio, plague, smallpox, etc. Heck, Spanish Flu ended infecting 1/4th world's population. 

Your take supported sort current historical evidence. None right - but, get paid push specific narrative. 

X–æ—Ä–æ—à–∞—è —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞ –±–æ—Ç–∞! why, people counted Covid pneumonia.  Deaths lag 3-4 weeks behind. never right maim innocent people weak virus. weak. Definitely weakest I've ever experienced. small sniffle. slight. really noticeable all. warrant use kleenex. Dabbed nose shirtsleeve. Barely left mark stain. Still nearly two months away. lot happen two months. Things could brought control, maybe it'll apocalyptic wasteland people scavenging toilet paper rubbles American cities. done long time ago oh well lost grandparents, mum.
I know grief does. 
I also know wasting life scared nothing. much mum wished longer life, spend last years trapped inside unable socialise sing choirs, she‚Äôd wanted kill anyway. one advice gave passed let fear death consume me.
I take precautions protect others course. feeling relieved low death rate, including myself, unaware effects virus older otherwise vulnerable immune systems. obeyed rules lockdown, seen one friend boyfriend since march. always wear mask, even outside I‚Äôm exercising. 
Honestly don‚Äôt get you‚Äôre taking issue people finding comforting death rate low age group- similar infectious diseases. course death horrible, feeling awful scared 24/7 opinion boomers likely go conspiracy rabbitholes general, nothing different covid.

Im also 100% convinced customers people like Alex Jones mainly boomers. Prejudices? dont know. travel, including inter-state, shut March. I'm watching people head south winter flock back states imploding one safest. fucking mess. shit we're talking death rate could get to. hard imagine, all. ""houses,"" dozen family members living one room together. family members socialize people village neighboring villages.

They told masks. way wash hands.

Then, villagers take fruit fish nearest market town congregate close contact hundreds people. Awww, they're crying Facebook sympathy attention.

Even pre-covid, whenever someone would post Facebook ""soooo sick!"" I'd look view weak, sickly person I'd rather interact much, ever.

But talking masks (for attention), get sick let world know (for attention / sympathy), willing victim, sickly, piece shit human. related here? wants go back warehouse exploited min wage make assholes rich, black lives matter, exploited lives, start another movement, tear run exploiters business, world go without plastic trinkets dollar store. Signs worthless employees enforce them. stopped gas store, line 4 5 people without masks employee barely wearing there's correctly. decided get snacks pumped gas left. hit shit already, heat index already 100. God bless you. üá∫üá≤ can't sarcasm like subreddits next-door comments like that. Andrew Cuomo son former New York Governor Mario Cuomo. totally guessing here, I'd think something like 20k Texans.

Well first, pre-existing conditions? 65. apologist need satiated first consider absolute minimum help fellow citizen. what.. masks forever? Mobile keep saying plenty ICU beds available, I'm afraid they're going keep saying suddenly none.

Pretty much gold star answer. extra credit, add ""Or hurts party's chances"" Yeah pandemic also revealed US dire need mental institutions crazy conspiracy theorists. know barely tested anyone. 2k deaths day 1% death rate gives 200k cases day. We're supposed wear pants??? !@#@#!$% Nobody told me!! Ok arbitrary 90% said really change overall point...


There are, almost definitively, less active cases today back March, April, May. 

Just cause know they're active cases today mean exist back May. 

Like... That's whole ""if testing numbers go down"" logic everyone makes fun of, factually correct. Numbers artificially low. Great job, still late!! Europe, Austria specifically basically already solved problem, many European countries. second wave, come US, yall brain dead. listened rushing Re-Opening. ‚ÄúHe to‚Äù....

He done long ago decided ignore severity pandemic I'm glad hear this. 

According [this figure](http://covidactnow.org/?s=58173) CovidActNow shows progress 50 states making contain Coronavirus, state Northeast Orange Pennsylvania right next green states country. PA help limit spread coronavirus, could really help Northeast. r/pureMichigan little nose? Hmmmm, sounds like sort thing witch would say..... people need money live, life=dollars. everyone afford stay closed, everyone afford work, everyone afford halt income months. Sometimes sustaining livelihood important taking precautions possible. Corona thing kills. Pull mask straps! Back day festering pandemic *opportunity*! Yeah, wear masks. also, gotten Covid recovered that's reason relief celebration. good worry consequences 10 20 years out? Especially they're entirely control anyway? Worrying, context, accomplish anything. Lives gotta lived living constant fear terribly unhealthy. Plus, general bummer. Alright beach party time let's pack bars!!!11 local Applebee's bar makes 75% revenue food, still run bar serve drinks there? table service? Sadly may right. least one major US airline going business. mean they're struggling, might happen, justification actions. American United bought liquidated within next 6 months. company competent legal team would ever allow type action unless 100% sure would never see consequences blatantly dangerous action.

This feels like Blockbuster Video boldly advertised would stop charging late fees fine print justified charging full purchase price (~$50) DVDs due date instead. 2 things happened: 1) decided never spend dime again. 2) realized done. ""struggling compete/adapt"", ""experimenting different models blah blah"", simply shambling corpse unafraid class actions damage knew would protected bankruptcy. hospitals indeed receiving money magnitude $13-$39K treating covid patients. That‚Äôs fact. butt hurt pointing fact? Secondly safe assume certain PROFIT, PRIVATE medical institutions dear country could abused support government? profit medical system country run honest Abe angels? Wish people stayed home :/ specifically relation immediate health emergency near future. true, upvoted? trump administration testing now? thought state problem. article lot interesting quotes Fauci, actually, illustrate point. Lol embarrassed American, sharing country morons could responsible killing family. Governor sued?
Every death state hands, every medical incurred due inaction hands.
Tampering public records felony - charge him! Houston problem Arizona covering ears, singing, ""La la la, can't hear you!"" why? wrong people? Ahahahaha!  ""Glorious Leader"" absolves responsibility, inevitably ~~sheep~~ followers same.

I strongly imagine guys going ravaged COVID cyclic 3-month repeats (still 1st wave, mind) idiots either dead get clue.

250k+ dead COVID time next year? Entirely possible. Maybe 300k. There's disrespect women Even Valley Children‚Äôs Madera standby receive adult patients Imperial Valley. Rip There's really few? wrong people? get hesitancy close family business put career hold, wearing mask costs person nothing. 
Lots masks area Washington, ubiquitous. cant imagine people looking funny wearing one point though. Jesus people eating Dallas?  wish could move New Zealand. NBA MLS.tournaments Disney separate parks entirely private sports complex logic make sense. repubes controlled state house senate spewed Suprem3 Court cleaned up...

I meant pollution Chicago creeps lakeside way door county :(  Italian surgery done I'd likely travel Italy get done healthcare costs US horrendous bigger issue enforcement mask wearing. outside 5 today, wonder many citizens (to include shop workers) compliance Ooooooops I'm home GA. Bought food yesterday, go another 1-2 weeks.
I hope people provide power water wearing masks.  hard 5g bill gates microchip morons there. think lot people though that, that‚Äôs we‚Äôre mess üòñ Jesus insane, vaccine that's perfectly safe take years make, can't afford stay way years... Chicago 100% wearing masks indoors. Even go walks neighborhood close 75% wear masks though don‚Äôt need outside. sometimes since walk lobby use elevator, lately it‚Äôs hot humid take I‚Äôm walking put back go building. think meant say incurably incalculably. Thanks. gonna say same. 

Which means somewhere 1 70 1 250 need hospitalized. somewhat similar flu stay posted. Correction: 8,942 **known** cases Hot weather = mass gatherings beaches/parks

Rainy/cold weather = people mass gather could've seen coming!? thought virus big deal/didn't exist! Holy shit, really increased cases deaths 2.25-2.5x many since last Task Force Briefing late April point world leaders say 'screw it' put vaccine that's proven safe? I'll rather take hearing 'social distancing' lockdowns' another 4 years well guess finna die Well get two choices turd sandwiches write candidates help incumbent win, shit gets difficult. 

I'm still voting Biden, I'm going hate start finish. data indicates deaths due Covid-19 attributed pneumonia intentionally reduce mortality case fatality rates. Nah, waited got hundred cases began rolling lockdowns. numbers finally made good progress. stupidly went wild despite everyone knowing Spanish flu second wave. guess never travelled far south hot, never really believed people say much hotter tropics despite lower mean summertime temperatures. Why? want right wing traitors die! Keep em open! Well I‚Äôll say couldn‚Äôt go protest kids I‚Äôm obviously expert goings protests. However live stream watched, video seen protest live, I‚Äôd say less half people wore masks. one towns got tear gas. isn‚Äôt surprising probably half people around wear masks anyway. people contagious I'd agree you, since are, make sense. So, protests allow white men guns eat begin? SC percent positive 18.3% today 
 
You mean die this, right? you, simply care dies? Oh. WHAT? Covid causes vomiting? Shit, I‚Äôd love live New Zealand hmmm that's good suggestion

thank Depends COVID19 antibodies.  That's humans you. care tomorrow brings, care get us want right now. Canadians want border re-opened anytime soon. think Bill Gates mostly really poor body language makes seem awkward untrustworthy.  live Florida. loathe beaches here, gross. supply issues know going devolve poor left dead. dropping fast :( put pile societal responsibilities one cares about. Please ELI5 sigmoidal growth, seen exponential growth mentioned Covid. 

I also found countries ability slow growth (is still sigmoidal, sounds exponential me):

Without measures slow exponential growth, COVID-19 continue spread exponentially many months. Eventually, enough people recover disease slow it‚Äôs spread. person recovered infection longer spread healthy person become sick coming contact infection. However, left untreated, COVID-19 spread throughout population resulting many deaths. mentioned, scenario would quickly overwhelm health care system exponentially increase number infected individuals appearing short time frame. would lead death many people due lack hospital beds, medicine, ventilators, resources.  crisis taught anything, aliens invade, we'll take opportunity shoot try attack them. jfc HAHA, no. nearly meaningless move. people willing take precautions first place, closing bars chases different venue. people Texas going seriously care hit 100K.

The thing is, 3 general camps mindsets right now.

1) people follow guidelines, stay home almost time, going absolutely wearing mask so.

2) people pandemic fatigue put show wear mask occasionally ultimately care think anymore.

3) people believe minor illness impact way.

I'd say groups probably fairly evenly spread 3rds around country definitely weigh much heavily groups 2 3 conservative locations. 1/3 people trying right thing 2/3 people keeping fucking everything up. There's light end tunnel. huge portion population unwilling follow proper guidelines own, simple certainty states going collapse this.

I said months ago think we're much brink, absolutely going see states starting close borders states failing most. grew Florida live outside state. embrace claim went middle school every Florida Man someone asks about. feel mom. background science, husband student history. told living fear, unable think critically lack common sense frustrating, especially taking reasonable precautions.

I get it. Texas saw 90% increase hospitalizations two weeks saw California‚Äôs 32% increase. 

So, yeah. People aren‚Äôt criticial California. reason.  

¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø lucky New Zealand though. I'm frickin Canada hate cold.

I've always wanted live US climate better here, deal people. I've banned discussions sort within home. come up, forcibly intervene tell change subject. generally remain peaceable avoids subjects.

Unfortunately, often finds littlest excuse get onto conspiracy theories. honestly even know anymore. particular crazy, still gentle loving woman care for, want children know sides family, cutting something harmless us personally seem worth it.

But boy frustrating. talk often it. FIL believes stuff, least (mostly) knows respect boundaries leaves us it. aren't. ask them. /s Yeah mean really matter much? start boarding amount time take everyone else anyways. 

But it‚Äôs super inconvenient work you‚Äôre always going time get airport early stand southwest boarding line. means probably check carry get bad seat. Compared United, reserve space I‚Äôll probably get upgraded first class.

I can‚Äôt tell number times I‚Äôve leave straight conference meeting get gate it‚Äôs closing. It‚Äôs nothing SW consumer line it‚Äôs really good option business travel STAY HOME

But go dinner 50% unenforced capacity limits apply. Disney delayed opening though.  point plan getting expect to. I'm everything permanent lung scarring kidney damage. flatter curve, less people infected see go away. 

These real numbers, hypothetical guess numbers get point out...

People like throw percentages required achieve heard immunity. subjective number active infections time, measures social distancing precautions taken. keep R0 1.0 long enough, virus could actually go extinct. 

You either achieve with...

100% herd immunity, virus nowhere go anymore, regardless shitty childlike tantrums wearing masks. lot people die happens. likely ever get high, we'd go way get infected.

80% herd immunity little social distancing precautions, virus terrible finding new hosts could fizzle point

60% herd immunity people start taking seriously. lot active infections time, take time drops zero infected

60% herd immunity number active infections already low, could potentially stop right here. 3 5 people meet cannot give virus, receive it, combined everybody interesting fewer people, numbers could drop like rock.

With enough vigilance (masks!) Perhaps achieve 40% get infected mean run. merican vomits bald eagles. First increase cases, weeks later come increase deaths, unfortunately. hope everyone's sake people self quarantine better go back city visit south Florida. lot people can‚Äôt bothered coronavirus want sports back, it‚Äôs gonna take head coaches dying players getting career shortened people CONSIDER caring Protests way week, least areas country, last many, many hours. Like commenter, appears arguing political standpoint. not. I'm pointing partially responsible spike numbers. Ah yeah makes sense, didn‚Äôt
Know testing figured much Cutting hateful, science denier isn‚Äôt bad thing. Especially since I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs mostly shit mother too. Surprised Pikachu face choice. hospital getting maybe 4-5 new cases week, end March two weeks ago. 8 positives today alone, like week. 


I went outdoor seating bar mask two weeks ago, GF people masks on. Nobody else cared. went grocery store yesterday maybe 10% people masks. pick something Lowes go inside again, 10% people mask on. cultural thing, know they're trying prove. Ah yes, hope prayers stop pandemic right tracks  second best time take action immediately best time.

We're worst possible time take action except time future. can't really deal them. person like going listen reason. let scream echo chambers pay mind. Americans think Cardi B Katy Perry medical experts. saying all. think state going purple quite sometime else election would close. landslide situation stretch. Florida lived 40 years. Every single person know voted vote again. know mask protect you? reversed. husband WFH income affected. left high exposure low paying job. oldest kid would pre-k fall. Guessing keeping home. fortunate ride pretty effortlessly, denying that. experience, don't. can't reason someone position reason into. Expected. People already warned protest early opening many states isn‚Äôt true. regards Medicare would pay out, hospitals receive patients even it‚Äôs lower patients would typically charged According one ranters West Palm, that's normal death rate, know it. Recent study shows gyms aren‚Äôt driving factor behind spread. Sounds pretty gross dude, experience, large percentage restaurants bad. think people wouldn‚Äôt go eat knew half goes kitchens. Introvert Texan here. state embarrassment. really, really, bad use brain first place. Again, he's blaming texans. Well, stupid leader mandate masks opened soon....what expect? musta living drug induced dream think would turn different. trying fix little late. Sorry Texas. Hope new dream willl magically happen. Didn‚Äôt Gov. Desantis say happened NY couldn‚Äôt happen FL people unnecessarily panicking? inspectors thing? fined? fed troll. Mother trust government?  *I send pestilence plauge house, bed...* at? though. believe it‚Äôs related population density Lol stop spread slightest. Looking like something make so. thats good one....made laugh shit, anything kids taking far serious boomers. spewing BS Facebook refusing wear masks. idiot president actually said that. doomed. Lobbied? didn‚Äôt say exactly. bitched moaned Facebook still are. remember right, Orange County CA held protest way back April couldn‚Äôt go beach. Pretty sure lot people wealthy business owners. Please tell you‚Äôre austin - would like avoid costs Front line people either died got infected immune now. Whatever left OK. Oh god, that‚Äôs terrible. he? know go... someone cooking books None attributable large scale protests people gathered shoulder shoulder? [They Masks work NY.
Masks work Asia.
Masks work leaders people trust tell use them. Oh wait, that's why.
To bad credible leader. Well supposed bleach?  predict mysterious drop reports bunch people online denying 3-day weekends affect numbers. Unfortunately.. lots won‚Äôt suck ‚Äúpride‚Äù get angry store (gas stations, Walmart, Target, etc) enforcing wearing masks. majority people wearing masks Orlando now. Miami mandated law. Florida gets bit sensible south travel. least hit keys. people crazy. Palm Beach, because, y'know, old people. In-laws got high school diploma went Bible college, yeah, pretty much fit description uneducated. else would CEOs earns 10s millions without repercussions shitty management?!?!? that?

I'm Houston every time go grocery store see least 95% people masks. Maybe handful without. We're go to
Ohanging leftist

I'm neither right left. concept right wing vs left wing politics anachronism. political divide populism, men created equal, vs globa!ism let's emulate caste system. basically scorched earth tactic employed body. Viruses hijack cells use make copies themselves. fight virus, body kills infected cells stop making new viruses. things go awry many white blood cells even healthy cells vicinity infected cells become target\*. especially dangerous respiratory diseases dead lung cells basically slowly drown patient within, top already reduced capability absorbing oxygen. 

\*Whether happens accidentally purpose unknown afaik. One could argue body starts kill cells could potentially host virus last resort, argue killing sick individuals would also reduce spread disease therefore would evolutionary benefit species whole. 

P.S. writing memory. study biology many years ago touched subject ever since, hopefully say anything really wrong. bad permanent lung damage irreversible like every state playing plague Inc reversed, lot quite grasp concept. Heh hoping really solved time travel paradox Fucking spread far he's spread Covid! He'll find dumb way spin this, I'm sure  Well us dumbest country earth considering much available citizens. unfathomable dumb fat country is. deserves credit except killing people. would expect early next week. Weekend lulls. CDC's recent estimate 10 times cases reported based antibody testing attributed asymptomatic individuals, lack testing.

The fatality rate include cases, 5% 23 million 100k. mean, language article without doubt intended cause fear. Instead including important nformation research, author chose scream ‚Äúzombie virus‚Äù every sentence. omitted next paragraph quote, basically stated don‚Äôt know significance is. especially love people mock frequent adage ""we'll see two weeks"" like makes hoax something.

How considered *less* credible knowing concept lagging indicators average time exposure symptoms, exposure hospitalization, exposure death? 

this exactly data bears time time again, yes wait 2 weeks see effects today's events. sorry covid disease instant gratification? Like people stand wait things take time life? Really brave already antibodies. That‚Äôs rich coming state locks people smoking plant made 2 protestors basically brain dead rubber bullets, hang up. What's full lockdown? mean litteral sense imprisoning people homes (asides groceries medical attention course). 

Or rather shutdown non essential business ban gatherings beyond certain size? never did. duty collect. love coasters used /r/rollercoasters reddit homepage. fuck sub become echo chamber people wanting re-openings parks re-opening bunch pictures videos people idiots love coasters blinds common sense. 

I'm hoping maybe loud minority sane ones like staying quiet cuz there's much talk right (and nothing exciting) saying wrong first paragraph literally imploring people post news stories potentially serving evidence might challenge beliefs. that's kinda dumb Given Houston, median doctor income utterly roof.... idea ""funnel nearly money research..."" seems utterly absurd.  average make $313k year. Please tell profit business. think understand idea non-profit business. hospital make profit, individual employees obviously paid. paid well, be. Unless suggesting want healthcare workers make money all? unless we're kind post-scarcity post-money system, see that's feasible.

Second, say funnel nearly money back research *and care*, I'm talking would profit hospital. idea make profit mean revenue can't significant, mean still need compensate people services. want best employees pay best employees.

Third, doctors make lot money, should. doctor extremely difficult, requires years education training, comes massive legal ethical responsibilities. tremendous burden, quite frankly 300,000 dollars year arguably low doctors I've met. Certainly deserve many ultra-wealthy financiers business moguls make way money hardly anything help anyone's life.

You're one making claim. claiming MD Anderson for-profit business. Prove it. 1 bad year schook vs continued presence spreading deadly virus....shortsightedness got us mess... Laugh them. Point laugh.  Could months nightmare over... Half million people stupid want enjoy life *wise* one. *responsible* one.


Jesus christ, point self reflect see narcissist stuck bubble? thing heard compared 1968 flu small business owners lobbied go restaurants bars? plot thickens indeed Ok plus side, Arizona numbers plummeted today. Hospitalizations fell 300. Ventilator usage fell 25%.

Strange articles previous 5 days endless articles record highs.  Cities Texas begging let enforce masks- Abbott specifically allow independently mandate individual masks. one suggesting abstaining everything that's bad faith argument completely barring fringe groups one saying live bubble risk category still optional. 

It would take sharing needles abstaining sex, please educate HIV using comparison anything.

Edit. Anything everything- used wrong word   control. always were. Every state spiraling control since March. seeing it. knew happening going outside minutes every two weeks. I've outside rarely past 3 months can't even look block without getting disoriented. isolation? contagious time? Yes. state in?  Floridians pay taxes. Also car insurance mandatory. complicated, nuanced. mandate face masks prohibit high-risk behavior.

The government printing money using buy equities bonds prop market, money going people help get this. People choose losing lives livilihoods, government's number 1 responsibility protect us existential threats like one. 

Fear good fearful situations. Dismissing fear leads reckless behavior (see America circa 2020). 

The discussion ""do lock-down function normal"", discussion always ""what government protect health wellbeing"". That's government exists. 

It's blaming 2.5 million people getting infected, holding responsible welfare responsible. They're even pretending try protect us, government issued rent relief even table -- yet they're buying equities like there's tomorrow. 

That's wrong. lead longer pandemic much much higher debt levels liabiities long run. Texas current 12.7% tests coming back positive, rising. See Canada testing center tell us call us within 24 hours result positive, possibly longer 48 hours negative due limited staff, login line health card number see results soon done, regardless whether positive negative. know states built digital system checking results. half people die...or kill one loved ones...or both. Norway low infection right now. can't compare say Texas Florida moment conclude gyms contributing spread. Science showing us unmasked indoor activities spreading virus.    ICU deaths Lombardy NYC 20% 25%, treatment improved considerably people stay inside Casinos, Bars, Malls, etc stay cool get house SAFE again. /s (kinda) remember mayor NYC scoffed Trump banning travel China told people go catch play ignore Corona late March. Mandatory mask ordinance issued live Kansas City, MO. Effective Monday. That's good news got today, numbers look like dumpster fire. think believes mom brainwashed

Well that's ironic. Barrier created made innovative product worked well adopted broadly. 

Plenty places use Mac platforms, including tech companies. 

Most people compute personally within Apple ecosystem.

Should give word processing app away free? paying license continuous updates, bug fixes, support. Would rather buy floppy disk buy every time update comes out?

Google docs Libre office viable competitors dont want pay. I‚Äôve rescheduled wedding twice honeymoon three times. Costa Rica Mexico Florida, swear could choose Fargo, ND, it‚Äôd come next epicenter. 

We still going, going, doesn‚Äôt mean stupid. driving renting private residence friend private beach access. Instead going dinner, get week‚Äôs worth groceries stay get takeout. Honestly non-essential contact half-day fishing trip - two us guide only. think it‚Äôs fair say people sick reschedule, need mental break still go vacation you‚Äôre smart it. 

It‚Äôs also hard times economically lot vacations already paid for, I‚Äôll tell hotels airlines longer friendly refunds ‚Äúchange date, keep rate‚Äù they‚Äôre bleeding money, too.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* might unpopular opinion much want every person public wear mask, think police given responsibility enforce mask requirements.

They available arrest idiots leave establishments mask rules trespassing keep away actively stopping people streets.

Instead, hire public health inspectors shut non-compliant businesses public workers engage community counter anti-mask propaganda spreading right wing social media.  Good point. audibly said ""holy crap"" saw number.  get that, really do. sometimes laps around city parks would evening stroll. Could explain what's misleading?

I've listing doctors scientists entire time fail see beyond reality numbers exactly are. problem precisely become politicized situation. It‚Äôs longer managing virus getting minimal deaths infections. Instead, devolved mask vs mask argument based primarily upon political affiliation hard hold party line. It‚Äôs team vs team situation. 

Yes, good people country people wholeheartedly want help us get this. want people don‚Äôt care care. Unfortunately, takes handful don‚Äôt care fuck everyone. That‚Äôs say shouldn‚Äôt continue wearing masks give hope. cannot. I‚Äôm holding breath convince anyone reality. Reality is, data there, experiences documented accessible. said, far many people willfully ignorant, outright rejecting observable, factual reality. 

TL;DR - love optimism can‚Äôt give up, truly fucked. takes people don‚Äôt care ruin everyone likely kill dozens irresponsible actions.   He's already backtracked many points made early on.

It surprise people trust says anymore. completely disagree. We're even talking long term effects. said, data we've seen (which enough, that's problem) - data says 25-40% EVERYONE infected, even symptoms, major life long health issues including brain damage. 

What terrifying? feared?

This like 9-11, lost close friends digging rubble. remember saying course toxic, governnment kept dismissing telling people can't live fear. wish God friends others terrified pile toxic waste demanded protection. fear may kept alive. 

Mark words, health care costs ramifiications long term far severe anything experience now. Much like 9-11, way people die next decade post-Covid conditions die next two years. Espscially young people. die, still lives happiness ripped disease. NJ public schools offer Pre K, child eligible turn 3.

Kids need toilet trained pre-K. Wearing mask reasonable requirement. Lol, like live democracy. parents, grandparent, neighbors? 2022 continue wear masks go eat time. get take out? See posts like ""I'm certified OSHA specialist"", ""Here ADA approved card says need wear mask"", ""Masks give hypoxia"", ""Hospitals calling everything COVID pays more!"", etc. Ugh annoying stock essentials. assume people panic buy second wave imminent mandatory shut downs become implemented again. state's largest county 17 day reporting lag hospitalization data. lag increasing several weeks, almost certainly data problem. I'd happy wrong, single-day discharges add up. Gee, thoroughly shocking outcome pretending pandemic happening. sure good thing shitloads people die this. remaining 33%? Mmm. math makes perfect sense [CDC's numbers 0.4% symptomatic cases die (symptomatic case fatality ratio 0.004) 127,000 fatalities far, means 31.75 million symptomatic cases^(\*).

If 35% cases asymptomatic, 31.75 million symptomatic cases, must 17.1 million asymptomatic cases. That's total 48.85 million infected.

With population 320 million, comes 15% infected leaves 85% population uninfected.

Also, 10x tested would still mean 92% public uninfected, 95%.

^(\* Assuming infected representative general population. reason elderly disproportionately infected, numbers go down, that's big if. Also, symptomatic case fatality ratio bizarre number... really mean infection fatality ratio would closer 90%.) Saw guy store week wearing mask hanging one ear. Mask side neck, nothing face. We're doomed. Agreed. Also leaders completely abandon rule law favour violent mobs. We're fucked. politicians trying compare whether economy would perceived okay supporters whether economy would actually okay. There's huge difference. Dummies think going okay they're able get haircuts shit, apparently. People look little bit farther worried recovery whether would faster slower many trained laborers dead incapacitated disease. around \~45k end day. 50,000 day getting infected 
 seems crazy enough me. think stage safe say people get either way. Well would good news people respirators dying replaced new patients needing them. Nice understand someone financially comfortable wants hide comfortable home, really messed many people want decide risks fellow citizen, facing different set circumstances, take. Worse want control allowed forced poverty. What‚Äôs solution? happened third party hotel booking service-Cancelon. name ironic. kept taking bookings April filed bankruptcy intent ever refund money. 56% people polled. Sample size means meaningless. Protesters wore masks, police filling restaurants didn't. Medical Center Houston reached capacity go surge capacity 2 weeks time. Whatever measures take least 2-3 weeks effects seen. 

That means likelihood, people need medical attention go without doctors choose lives dies. Italy go exactly scenario political leaders still taking shit seriously mind boggling. Also criminal far I‚Äôm concerned. already delayed Disneyland , one might need pause well. People find great relief healing water. 

I seen many people walking weeping.  ocean powerful force.  help feel small are. 5g? think mostly trend counts now, 558 peak end April, yeah still much I'd trust politicians would consult health professionals take advice, that's much ask. one Floridaman. Sounds like Floridans denying true selves over, it'll interesting see many people died this. guess 500k end although hope I'm wrong heard feline coronavirus? causes mild disease, lays dormant. 10% chance mutating inside body cause FIP, 100% fatal disease. SARS-COV-2 developing similar ability would frightening, hopefully unlikely. county already came said believe goes constitutional rights citizens sheriff won‚Äôt enforcing mask mandates. family compliance, didn‚Äôt need mandate, thanks sheriff coming that, probably won‚Äôt see lot people weren‚Äôt wearing now. Wow! worse thought. Germany never 7k new cases day thought back 6k new cases lot. Florida even fourth population Germany. could let gotten bad Florida? ... What? ....you know 79 people died arizona 2 days ago highest death rate, could easily acount less ventilators. joking???? There's never need???? cold? Every form flu that's ever existed? shit already kills hell people every year???? fucking insane delusional???? Idaho here. county went back stage 3.  I'm pretty confident know nothing tourist economy US Italy Greece- US tourism economy larger country world employs people country. still can't believe smart enough pull plug early decided try play state that's basically done reverse-NBA pretending like nothing's going on. one realistically expect go well pandemic? actually agree him. omg, what's happening me? fine Bay Area, heard Sacramento area handling masks well. I'm sorry! pretty much guarantee it. question going get ahead victim it? Looks like might need go grocery shopping weekend make sure I'm fully stocked staples. No, incorrect numbers created equal. China underreporting millions different Guatemala able perform testing. fact posts like get voted shows sub gone full propaganda.

New Jersey death tolls skyrocketing bring also get voted fit propaganda pushed beginning March said America would absolute shit show, Covid-19 would rip throughike knife hot butter downvoted Oblivion.

Here unfortunately proven right, terrifying thing, going get lot worse coming weeks Damn, Florida gave 22% today‚Äôs positive cases yet 6.4% country‚Äôs population seems like another system rich able get around rest us prop up. 

You could avoid [Land Value progressive wealth tax can't dodged. Ah yes, good old PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY!!11!

SARS-CoV-2 average time infection symptoms 5.6 days max 14 days, that's 4 life cycles. limited spread situation hard lockdown, that's plenty time get virus control go back normal minimal future outbreaks. 

It's bad fell far-right media narrative need open things RIGHT haircuts economy! Now, need deal repercussions continue new closures reopenings future resulting untold job losses economic turmoil simply sustainable business model nearly businesses never know next shutdown be. rebuild Hadrian's Wall.

And make Romans pay it!! saying work everyone start giving automatically makes ignorant??? I‚Äôm sorry young people healthy would figure developing vaccine help people high risk first moving younger people actually healthy. Sorry think comment ignorant I‚Äôm trying selfish like Floridian here, seeing level stupidity gaining many cases, people fact resistant, US deteriorating much nation, dont much faith anymore. excuse whatsoever. purpose serve face covering work. hospital grade PPE.  Healthcare workers know better. training education shows know better. Wow worser case scenario? Good job, Texas!  know, hence /s. Young people great accepting responsibility actions. Oof. sucks people close ignorant.  Problem clear symptom covid could attributed too, closest thing would loss taste smell that's big load bullshit know covid contracted contaminated surfaces know food packaging usually contains surfaces. tough call whos worse politician poll......trump desantis doucey kemp pence yes ill throw diblasio too.....these people dont give damn...... Gonna interesting see plays out. keep seeing articles florida cooking books. reported news professionals saying exactly conspiracy theory. still hope right, things looking grim. really baffled. Many states opened still 18k cases per day. Many stage increase 2-3 weeks previous one. border measures mean people fly spread virus places previously escaped worst. masks, virus itself, become political, runaway train.  Yet story isn‚Äôt appearing mainstream press. That‚Äôs still focusing full scare. What? fuck that, like living lot.  fair, came back Paris got say places quite dodgy amount people packed certain areas. Brussels lockdown officially ‚Äòended‚Äô many people gathering without fully respecting social distancing. We‚Äôre still looking second wave, albeit severe US obviously

But best friend works place LA says thing happening there. decided care anymore No, that's works unfortunately. Take look mirror. Sitting defending weakest pathetic disease response among developed developing countries well. Again, key word IMPROVES, eliminates.

One word: gangster. stock market sign general economic health... I'd love check math post any. mistake, exactly? Wait fr? Huh TIL MURICA SURPRISE!

Most people would use technlogy porn, nice food money.

Back internet new promising, everybody thought would used knowledge creation. Papers full articles would artists creators stuff. becomes mostlly either cesspool webpages selling things ads familt photo albums.

DEEP STATE TAKEN TEXAS! /s fault, keep listening trump, see far get you. dumb realize dumb are: new pandemic WAMFFS two daughters, 4 2, registered start back school mid August (San Francisco Bay Area). I'm particularly interested finding risk factors among children spreading virus.

Without information, seems like send kids school, would wise limit contact grandparents. article helps ease fears little bit, small sample size I'm sure, stated, cases contradict findings France.

I look forward links discussion thread. cases, parents grandparents guilty completely responsible demise.

If new soda market 3% chance killing drank hundreds millions people drank anyway, would feel sorry them? wouldn't. forget people putting risk, sorts idiots **have** go bars, Starbucks, etc etc.

The people deserve pity people like children adults truly little control interactions life.

These people ignorant, selfish entitled. deserve coming. worked ragged big law firm (I associate). I‚Äôm talking got pushback taking Saturday afternoon fly Northeast say goodbye cousin given week live (and secured coverage another associate 16 hours going unavailable). sent email, got reply 1 7 people (no condolences, though guess would expecting lot) asking work plane.

From point on, ‚ÄúFuck-You-Firm‚Äù mode. started making moves exit lawyer life entirely began reaching contacts. 

Coincidently, first ever seizure three weeks decision (have since learned let periods high stress trigger. thanks that, law firm), ONE WEEK set give notice. 

Man. Thank GOD first seizure (followed many many months come) gave notice. kept 12K/month (after taxes) gig. basically didn‚Äôt work (granted, ubering dozens doctors every week trying figure wrong). stayed additional 4 months got awesome paycheck BEST insurance. hit $3K deductible, 100% everything covered. Tens thousands dollars worth MRIs, angiograms, EEGs, MRAs, CTs, ER visits. name it, I‚Äôve probably imaged way. 

It felt good stick man. ""Sheriff Butthead? I'm State Trooper Smith. arrest public menace.""

But happen California. Eh want survive better lives us transcend primitive desires. Unfortunately won‚Äôt headed path destruction. I‚Äôve keep thinking something along lines. Like told ‚Äúyou required wear mask‚Äù? No, that's situation. Ehhh, Schlitterbahn, it'd difficult enforce social distancing long lines. mention guaranteeing tubes sanitized well lack chlorine chemicals rides.

I feel like left water parks open, they'd get slammed like rivers are. Maybe enforced reduced occupancy something? Also, massive censorship get cite lack evidence particularly meaningful. burden goes automatically should. There's way China lying numbers.

The problem nationals returning China show Covid. South Korean, HKnese, Taiwanese, Singaporean, Vietnamese nationals returning China test across board less Covid carriers nationals returning EU, UK, USA, bigger hotspots.

Sure, blither want China evil also incompetent therefore they're lying anything could possibly make look bad. looks bit insane claim every neighboring country testing nationals that've living China that's flooding since January also lying cover China.

So Chinese' Covid numbers artificially deflated, really orders magnitudes Redditors constantly claim sans-proof. Otherwise they'd show tests returning nationals. don't. Deaths lagging mean... kind deserve lose money trying go mass gathering pandemic. Still pretty crappy company though. Ok nevermind. Username checks out. Florida fudging numbers, classifying coronavirus dears pneumonia strokes. Yes, people going trust someone who's incorrect/wrong multiple things past. That's pretty basic. per-capita impact US losing international tourist dollars absolutely larger per capita impact European country losing US tourist dollars- completely impossible argue otherwise. pay attention everyone!!

That correct answer!

No.
Contact. can‚Äôt prepper trying prep shit already hit fan lol. don‚Äôt want society around that‚Äôs sure. society sick hell that‚Äôs predicament now. ""Were going get mine well get build immunities""

The poetic justice get second time...  real gift virus time. :3 MIL probably jealous I'm seeing restaurants safe places. Eating means can't wear mask, exposes hostesses, servers &amp; bussers patrons. also can't believe cooks always wearing mask standing hot grills &amp; fryers. seen food prep people wearing mask. Subway shop, I'm sure get much business, get business. People also think many people (dishwashers, prep people, cooks, waitstaff, etc) coming contact food &amp; serving/eating surfaces. Call paranoid, opinion. Haha gold. Say Devil Masks! Pretty much. would‚Äôve upvoted you; speculating probably downvoted babies protesting stay home. Read post comment history. It‚Äôs cuckoo goldmine.  yet freely make broad indefensible claims can‚Äôt form coherent argument. Didn‚Äôt ever professor challenge you? Yeesh. Jesus fucking Christ. someone Boris‚Äôs rule, feels wonderful portrayed comparatively positively.

It won‚Äôt happen again. Seriously though America, get act together. get hit Sahara dust well, that's another thing people allergies, upper respiratory problems asthma worry about. population density around NYC highest nation...

Yet Florida track surpass NYC's numbers next weekend. 

The highest daily number cases NY 11k, weeks containment measures put place. 
Florida 3k day away, barely measures speak of, even talk opening Disney...and outbreak beginning spiral.  really speak spanish medical purposes ordering food basic shopping. however, told heard latino radio station day car. lady called best friend tested positive hung lot. radio DJ told use faith dont victim fearmongering...that way try control people false fear...that really crazy message spread amongst community perform many essential functions. really cant science deniers. wont let kid go around laws exact reason. hate me, im taking chance. Food businesses come go. worked three businesses one year went - one 1 year old, one 5 years old, one venerable 15 years old. boom year! It‚Äôs razor-thin margin most. 

I friends well adding sides toilet paper take menu! reality hospital want COVID stuff pays little. ""non-profit"" hospitals want elective surgeries bring money bread butter. Covid Karen have.

I'm Australian, we're letting anyone in, except we're thinking opening borders mates across ditch New Zealand. friend 40 known work ""Mr. Tony Atlas"" got covid fucked blood clots hospital stay. shit hit anyone  Close 12??? even open? Noice. 3 months lateüëå Also also: Arizona *still* beat Florida new cases per-capita 47 per 100k vs 42. Well easy see suicidal. I'd love contributing least something world go. I'd in. Sorry UN WFP warning could die reactions virus virus itself. also reported left wing media.

Here quote:

""More people die economic...fallout die coronavirus"": World Food Program USA Why? Like seriously why? better argument would use swine flu example work political climate. Bonus points actually use h2n2 h2n3 argument outside that. would use whole testing philosophies principle/comparisons. would justified matter would least hold compelling argument least 4 responses rather people completely shutting start first term ‚Äúcrisis actors‚Äù.

1. That‚Äôs works dead virus not.

2. need massive framework even make achievable really isn‚Äôt possible. talking biology, science here. money loooooooong time US makes list. don‚Äôt see issue statements father. mean, he's engineer christ's sake (admittedly, went school one, experience training). He's went waayyyyy ""right field"" can't look intelligent person anymore. He's always bit judgy people even bit prejudiced (but, said racist maybe 4 5 years ago), last years 11, point like talking phone spending time him. It' makes sad. That's true. 

To honest, virus going spread even masks.

So, every authority going look bad.

I like he's blaming younger crowd. Older population seems care little virus I've seen. 

He blaming anyone really. accomplish anything. creates unrest anger. I'm suburb north Houston. I've chilling home dog. Mean 70 year old parents going father day church BBQs yesterday called parents church group get together someone's house. mom laughed said one wearing masks. definitely young folks. old folks give fuck either. yes stereotypical evangelical Christian Fox News watchers. DC Horrible creatures come rocks = House flippers. average death 28 days infection.

Is citing stats without evidence like, kink? 13 days pneumonia death.  I'm going run biking rowing I'm wearing mask shouldnt mandatory ...And flu shot saves many lives every year... It‚Äôs joke life-saving vaccine. We‚Äôre unlikely able get number 0, lower deaths illnesses much possible. Even covid vaccine you‚Äôre probably going completely eradicate it, contain enough go back lives without hundreds thousands people dying every year. Bold assume everybody backyard pool. three old hard fry slivers onion rings  saying current virus found wastewater samples, previous mutation. That‚Äôs surprising here. US, that. working everywhere else, we're still climbing here. garbage. He‚Äôs half listening, I‚Äôm grateful he‚Äôs taking action, don‚Äôt get wrong... But, closing bars restaurants might bit gamble. Also, everything closing down, people unemployment still required search job order keep benefits. health insurance. Literally everywhere else government subsidized care.

What think government subsidized care is? think word ‚Äúsubsidized‚Äù means? think money comes from? entire point making can‚Äôt seem understand private insurance premiums, government subsidized healthcare taxes, health care costs subsidized portion population putting money pot take need insurance get care

This false.

It‚Äôs truly amazing much non-Americans think understand America clearly don‚Äôt know talking about. drank kool aid anyone itching kill grandma they're bored indoors

This problem. odds grandma catches dies extremely low, stop thinking death sentence. If:

A. Person refuses leave, 
B. Person refuses wear mask, 
C. Person refuses quietly peacefully arrested **for trespassing**, 
D. Social media would cancel existence use force whatsoever,

What part ""may suffer"" ""murky evidence"" understand? exact kind fear-mongery bullshit I'm talking about. EVEN TRUE, article points out, MILLIONS Brits already. do? Cower fear? honestly wonder would take rednecks finally agree wear mask.

20% infection rate? 50%? Probably nothing. comments literally say would rather die ""oppressed"". really hate people sometimes. really isn‚Äôt. wear one day working people‚Äôs garages shit. Sure gets hot shit, that‚Äôs ok. Better getting dead Honestly, it‚Äôs probably bit both.

Undereducated (due fact public schools defunded decades) people never learned critically think. Many grew taught listen parents members church never question authority.

It‚Äôs definitely pushed people mental illness, people dumb too. that, people tired quickly started getting pissed. political appetite many states. Add fact president still desperately trying downplay anything related coronavirus one priority re-election expense American people. He‚Äôs actively sabotaging efforts save lies conspicuously avoiding seen wearing mask. leadership example causing needless deaths. absence evidence indeed men something happening.

It means, enough data available sure. Often wording seem misleading noob scientists. Yup.

Shortly, wear mask, kill you. like protesters run cars, former President sent pipebombs, acid thrown people's faces.

Also, since elective procedures resumed many unwitting patients screen positive, asymptomatic, still count hospitalization. Worrisome otherwise healthy asymptomatic people likely spreading throughout community cavalier outings bars, clubs, restaurants, etc. answer question makes response harder explain you. 

Fact 1)
Sweden currently enough hospital capacity meet infection rate.

Fact 2) lockdowns place hospitals NY (city upstate),NJ,PA,VA, MD (the states personally confirm, maybe more) ran ICU capacity we're forced overflow capacity transfer patients less impacted hospitals. main reason lockdown, reduce amount happens run ICU resources increase percentage infected people die. effectively people treatable/savable die unnecessarily. 

So please explain me, sincerely asking, would relaxing lockdown prevent short term? effectively saying lockdown increased rate infection US. make sense especially looking numbers New York reached herd immunity seems drop cases correlated lockdown went effect. mechanism propose, proof mechanism, says lockdowns increase rate infection?

Additionally strategies aim herd immunity. lockdown lengthens time reach herd immunity keep hospitalization rates manageable reduce mortality get point. also prot6for preexisting conditions.

Simply unreal. disgusting would use Sandy Hook massacre political benefit. Yeah, put another way:

You hold fort defending SARS-Cov2 nation. natural geography walls soldiers defend it. number Covid soldiers get inside walls exceeds amount soldiers defend it, lose battle (and disease).

Wearing mask like building pits trenches slow enemy's attack. Hand washing like repairing walls fort, preventing enemy sneaking in. Social distancing staying home like hunkering fort, listening spies leave un-defended. Exercise good health like building structure better combat threat.

Wearing mask might temporarily annoying, helps. Hunkering might boring frustrating, necessary. Building immune system healthy practices might tedious, got 1 fort defend disease.

And fort falls Cov-2 nation, uses wage war friends family. think people don‚Äôt know else put money sell? guess.  thank Jerome Powell , feel guilt toward future generations loading debt. stock market assets go price  Good know. significant increase them.

What cuck... Hospitalizations lag 2-3 weeks behind infections. going get worse. Imagine proud this. people *already* rule Texas, that's DGAF masking distancing. they're going learn sorry is, 'Rona DGAF politics  poorly educated,‚Äù exclaiming ‚ÄúI love poorly educated!‚Äù: I've never heard I'm OK government acting behalf make reasonable guidelines ensure safety others even causes minor inconveniences you.

And I'm OK thinking that's line value lives around you. course U.S. failing. know L.A.

One could easily prevented.  Translation: TMC sees record profits. Another normal day United Corporations America. No. lot ppl willing volunteer given chance vocal it. Especially younger folks willing help scientific endeavors. Americans going acting like buffoons deny science hate China passion. MANY ACTIVE CASES? 

WHY ONE REPORTING NUMBER RECOVERED???? mean, definitely us. Happy cakes! read article NYT today epidemiologists, whether they‚Äôll sending kids school. Almost without fail, kids, wanted back school could work. retired, didn‚Äôt kids, thought way many unknowns. 

Cognitive dissonance. I‚Äôm saying can‚Äôt relate needing help kids. But, gotta least admit sending school could certainly undermine efforts contain virus.

And we‚Äôre it, we‚Äôll stop moralizing towards blue collar workers want work. epidemiologists willing ignore facts suit personal needs...  understand hate doomsday person. Jeeze. wish people would wake fact virus, political issue civil rights issue. virus capable killing people. medical personnel experts virus get advice politicians concerned getting reelected seems foolish.

I appreciate it! I'll pass. I'll make pilgrimage Reserve, NM get green chile fix. war Ba Sing Se. necessarily get deeper tend agree... choice words bang on... said, historical context. interesting seeing fall Empire refused acknowledge Empire.

Lol wtf dude literally entire job... didn‚Äôt exactly take education human, please put category neanderthals. Many parents economic luxury care kids full time generate income care said kids.  lot 65 die- everyone shrugs says ‚Äúpreexisting conditions‚Äù moves without realizing many people preexisting conditions country even see otherwise normally rational-ish people like Bill Maher, going ""the cost lockdown"" without fucking realizing stupid saying lockdow worked degree need 

 ""there 100,000 deaths, economy""

 America real president, lockdown would provided time everyone wearing masks everyone educated importance masks, excellent contract tracing procedures established country could slowly opening back like Canada

 instead getting worse Trump refuses wear mask actually organize coherent strategy pretending it'll magically go away really going another lockdown soon huh?üò© Sounds like they're adopting NY messaging. Fingers crossed maybe they'll copy policies too. know, maybe thought reward would worth people looked up. figure powerful politicians country inherited fast track power, surprise anyone wealthiest people also exactly rags riches stories.

Honestly, probably spend much time twitter someone would called much sooner. thought made obvious including Rand Paul end. 28% per article one apparently read.

What know capacity ICU normally operates at. usually 90%? 50%? 70%? Without information, hard know bad fill ""normal"" capacity much 28% COVID patients really driving capacity issues. Thats literally people trying drive peoples brains since day 1.

It's extra corona deaths letting spread. potential deaths hospitals able save lives literally choose one life another. happened Italy cases, consider lucky worse.

This fairy tale land shit hits fan ""works out"" get help need need it.

If hospitals get overwhelmed people die waiting room, home, hospital hallway removed make room someone better chance survive whatever for.

But America keeps ignoring it. lock downs PREVENTED overwhelming happening, STILL idiots protesting masks, saying virus, ""see bad all, 120k dead""

It ""wasn't bad"" states virus started locked HARD. US would well quarter million deaths point still peaking dare say.

Worst part, lockdowns, jobs lost, businesses suffered, US undo lot containment lockdowns did.

No wonder tri-state (NY, NJ, PA, Conn) considering quarantining out-of-staters. like that's even feasible really realistic.

Imagine looking back 20 years seeing first lockdowns rendered useless. I‚Äôm Houston perfect storm COVID. huge population risk populations (Hispanic Black specifically), large amount crazies think it‚Äôs hoax (Texas), huge population youth (think they‚Äôre invincible summer break). Even one substantial medical centers world we‚Äôre overrun COVID despite valiant efforts Mayor Turner Lina Hidalgo suppress exceptionally well ultimately overpowered dipshit Governor Abbott‚Äôs aggressive re-opening plans. Abbott kissed Trump‚Äôs ass got. hope next wave protests get hell out. ICU's normally run higher dystopian healthcare system cuts 'excess' hospitals leaves us completely unprepared healthcare crises like pandemic. Actually think learned lesson NYC.

Clearly don‚Äôt live Texas problem polls fact can't take survey entire united states.

But think it‚Äôs important note #1 thing could done since whole thing started wear mask, social distance, wash hands. done community spread would drastically reduced early on, businesses could‚Äôve opened earlier, general economy could gotten back track earlier. Take look South Korea, hard hit February even still 5% unemployment low active cases. It‚Äôs implemented stringent testing tracing programs, citizens problem wearing mask. 

At point country, it‚Äôs far late. virus completely control. period hardship, government Americans need take hard look went wrong year response, take efforts fix it. major cities home state (AL) enacted mandatory mask orders Birmingham first back late April.

That's racist. Ok bill run president already agree. New Zealander here. America zero deaths now. Zero. someone lives here, anytime go number people responsible wearing mask maybe 1 10 1 20.

At least, that's experience... Tuesday**

Monday always low reports Sunday‚Äôs data reading idea popped head. Southern California? FL past weeks started getting hot people stay indoors much possible. feel like remember reading comments people TX AZ said similar things. kinda flip flopped used spend winters mainly indoors NY growing up, summer outdoors. Florida outside ton Winter mainly indoors summer.

I think reason think could play part recent growth. mandated state level? I'm almost positive governor could declared state emergency. New York clearly care vulnerable population. Guess we'll wait see ü§∑ protests people wearing masks? 

The protests also happened states currently spike cases?

Or mean maga protests morons scoffed safety measures whined able get hair cut standing shoulder shoulder shouting wearing masks Honestly, point I'd completely surprised. think anyone could handle worse have... much going right idk Brazile KnOw That's scary fucking disgusting week NJ.

The whole Swedish strategy hinges far over. That's half Swedish population (from latest percentages remember) still faith FHM. Right wrong, that's is.

I neither current strategy, apologist Socialdemokraterna, patronizing attempts moot. I've supported real opposition party last 10 years, gaslighted again.

The Swedish response composed bad decisions good decisions. uncertain times, think pretty reasonable jump conclusions virus disappeared stopped affecting population world. hope criticism taken heart, credit given credit due.

**A previous version reply removed ''political content''.**  8 million people New York City, 21 million Florida. Florida bad New York City 2.6 times many cases. Maybe they'll get next weekend, point take population account number cases. massive surge deaths couple weeks right?  *aisle pneumonia something common summer months, south? Serious question, someone never it, always thought winter ailment. 

But yeah, wonky numbers super suspicious...and called left right. thing want fucking shitshow end constantly contradicting news.

If oxford vaccine works, 'experts' etc telling us pandemic wont end 2023 etc? Nationality race. Good job missing point. Worse mandating masks, forbidden city providing penalty wearing mask. Well, government wanted back butts seats. can't tell people people they're allowed around co-workers customers. mean...Trump wants stay open, bad idea virus containment. virus also worldwide issue. everything American politics. one else world even cares president is.

I think weird still let restaurants serve alcohol. social distancing? would explain Sweden kept schools open. pretty common lot vaccines. weaker immune system, less immunity get, less time last you. yes, usually people vulnerable get least benefit personally vaccinated -- immunocompromised, elderly, etc.

That mean get it. immunity still better immunity. infinitely better get kinda sick, opposed getting on-a-ventilator sick.

But also reason everyone else get vaccines. immunity young healthy helps protect either fully respond vaccines, can't get health reasons. fewer us get virus, less likely get virus. talking about?

Almost vaccines work way -- people weaker immune systems get less benefit. common elderly immunocompromised people get partial immunity, last long.

Saying Sweden went ""fuck let's see happens"" plain wrong. 0.1%, ball park Israel age group.
And again, IFR, important number represents actual risk, probably least 5 times lower. % capacity limits always bogus. They're based Fire Code capacity - many people cram fire marshall closes down. 50% building capacity seats restaurant would use table space.

I really mind fuckwits going Darwin Award, seriously pisses gall take others them.  anyone experience flying US recent? (My partner flying NYC Seattle weeks wants join, air. I've quarantined since March.)  Listening thing hadn‚Äôt yet tried. keep reading every business supposedly cleans sanitizes everything every half hour whatever. I've worked stores restaurants. know like work fast-paced, physically mentally challenging, underpaid job lack proper training best times. way companies performing proper biosecurity measures. all, even places relevant training (nursing homes, hospitals) good preventing COVID-19 spread; right mind would assume Joe's Burger Shack better?!

I trust anyone keep safe. waiter restaurant ultimately *really* care customers get sick, especially hard determine sure people got infected. I'm staying home except what's absolutely necessary. know tbh. mean expect parents still jobs quit help kids learn? leave middle school high school kids alone learn trust will?


Shit, man - I'm tempted say let's sit one hope vaccine arrives end next summer. Yup, go see many old people young people unsafe. Southern CA btw. reason blame going young people sick enough get tested March/April tests looked like getting it/spreading it. increased testing capacity seeing positive tests young people blame shifting them, even though somewhat nonsensical. Title simply isn‚Äôt true, good chance we‚Äôll soon Depends evaluate it. try wear mask every time go out, sometimes forget grab one leave. poll worded simple yes-or-no question would probably answer yes, even though remember 100% time.

Of course, signalling self-image play role well; people know wearing masks, like think well themselves, misremember often actually wear masks unintentionally focus times do. Truth is, reached capacity 2 days ago. website. like forgot remove wanted pretend ok. URGING CAUTION GATHERING INDOORS??? ISSUING MANDATES OFFICE WORK? BAILOUT RESTAURANTS INSTEAD FORCING OPEN? 

For fucks sake, reactionary approach pinpointing giving us facts contact tracing risk management WRONG MODEL. [*crosses arms Arizona*] mhhm...

I still remember look sups face asked procedure place covid got here... Back January. looked confused.
How'd guess? 
That's store worked ran masks first time due panic buying. part gods plan Basically lying say first vaccine could ready September! seeing people following it. Since memorial day people stay home. Compliance extremely low ever enforced begin Unlike March, least snowing live. That's one positive. Ah. deleted comment Lewis Co. exact thing 1918 Spanish flu. time virus isn‚Äôt waiting fall fuck problem? didn‚Äôt post anything offensive said alliterative names wouldn‚Äôt keeping theme/pattern call retarded? actual fuck? top dude‚Äôs name literally Tim, Chris, ignorant fuck. true millennial (25) urge CDC director follow fashion guidelines stop wearing yellow tie dark blue shirt. mad racist bruh. workin cause. answer first question - common sense IQ level  \*Karen heads exploding everywhere\* Well, took Texas hospitals nearing capacity since two weeks ago.

All died die preventable deaths. 20's, mostly late 20's. oldest Millennial's turning 40 based people's definitions. ICU beds Pinellas County, live, 11% vacancy right now. Ding ding ding. Ah, dude group people saying plans slow testing despite Trump adamant that's exactly he's going do. hate fauci everyone around Trump grows spine, Trump pretty much best adviser going do. Europe probably also reopening much soon. takes time new outbreak spread noticed. Check weeks. No. Serological tests good method diagnose active viral infection. confirm virus. reason it‚Äôs used antibodies virus come strong 5-10 days symptoms. I‚Äôm sure. I‚Äôm running serological tests right now.

In fact, wrote also link posted. that, forcing masks hand sanitizers safety measures law, actually *enforcing* them. could‚Äôve opened relatively fine safety measures implemented. required surge capacity 20%. Houston, may mean something county, go 86 104. really significant. Btw, 2 available beds they're ones 6 county area. many areas 0 ICU beds first place. Fauci borderline useless seem driving actual policy changes, wonder Trump keeps around.  x 100 Consider even full lockdown get 7-10 days growth rate last days, currently incubating cases become symptomatic.. is, peak 5-8 times higher current numbers [1]. Anything less strong worse.

The alternative would serious restriction circulation. getting county, even municipality; neighborhood big cities. Italy, 1.5 months, going happen US.

[1] see charts countries except China. Make conclusions.  started pretty heavy diet exercize plan January get ready half marathon ended going virtual run April, easier keep exercize whenever want. 50 lbs since January.  less he‚Äôs listening huge backlash

Eh, another cowardly politician right idea - lockdown insanity - caved mob.

Meanwhile Sweden recorded single digit deaths. Turns cells tiny octopus legs stab virus surrounding cells. making ton assumptions here. makes feel like ‚Äúsuper mommy‚Äù blast parents, it. work ass kids. three year old OT year sensory issues, go tell don‚Äôt try. Here‚Äôs sticker you! buy anything marketed N95 internet. They're usually actually KN95 marked insane amount, $15 each. want KN95, search specficially type. N95s even available average outlet.

Here CA, Walgreens Rite-aide stocking blue medical style masks, 50 count $25-30. Massive markup, totally unreasonable. lower quality ones would found 20 count pack pre-Covid. flying summer 2021. guess people dying good thing plate. always found way business backwards. Whenever I‚Äôve worked home I‚Äôve always productive. I‚Äôm fairly introverted, people would always stop desk distract me. would would stand talking me, blatantly wasting time. time left completely forgot doing, would take like 15 minutes get back ‚Äúgroove.‚Äù Plus talking people don‚Äôt want talking totally drains energy. top that, would even work hours per day since didn‚Äôt worry traffic either side work day. Sorry rant, one kind got away me.  grew Washington. live Oregon now, lived briefly Midwest. Whenever tell people grew Washington, matter am, almost always think mean DC. Maybe I‚Äôm misunderstanding comment, think you‚Äôre mistaken. R0, pronounced R-nought, basic reproduction rate, modified (I.e. become &lt;1) based attenuation measures like social distancing mask wearing. either case, it‚Äôs expressed R0 though. referring effective reproduction rate, contingent levels susceptibility given population (I.e., percentage pop antibodies)? funny article new news actually load bullshit.

&amp;#x200B;

 *American Airlines start booking flights full capacity next week...*

&amp;#x200B;

Don't fooled folks - never stopped. flew one current hotspots month ago. Packed planes legs flight. true number Americans who've infected COVID-19 may top 20 million, according new estimates Centers Disease Control Prevention.

""Our best estimate right every case that's reported, actually 10 infections,"" Dr. Robert Redfield, director CDC, said call reporters Thursday.


""This virus causes much asymptomatic infection,"" Redfield said. ""The traditional approach looking symptomatic illness diagnosing obviously underestimates total amount infections.""

Could seeing many cases decreased deaths? would put IFR death rate somewhere 0.0X region people 65 drastically increasing age virus seems circulating young working population states ease restrictions. Finally. Well can't sell alcohol even go obviously not, seemed like comment writer saying corona virus bad, insinuating either bad before, waiter known better. simply saying statement waiter know better virus, putting situation. 

It misunderstanding Yes, let Americans in. for... year so, imo. least without mandatory quarantine.  20 year olds running around without masks. Stop bullshit. Per CDC CA excess deaths FL. good analogy car ownership. countries like car owner schedules routine maintenance gets things checked whenever hint problem. costs little short run, upside stranded desert facing $3000 transmission bill. 

The US guy never routine maintenance, gets oil change sees leak garage floor, figures check engine light software glitch, plays stereo loud doesn‚Äôt hear funny noises coming engine. everything hunky dory ends stuck desert facing $3000 repair bill. FUCK BILL GATES places biggest protests, NYC DC, seeing spikes.

So hold much water.  Yeah 71 hospitals many reported. 71/71 everyday gets messy agree. earth many places let open weeks reopening beyond me. exactly pissing recovery numbers ppl celebrating excuse move forward - recovered means didn‚Äôt die, still don‚Äôt know recovery looks like long term. know I‚Äôm screaming void, it‚Äôs scary always competitive. think lives big challenges. 2 weeks late  Difference AC northeast used comfort home lounging sleeping, temperature outside still moderate 80F degrees suitable wide variety summer activities. 

Contrast southern states, outside ambient temperature much hot reasonable activities, forcing people indoors AC gain reprieve afternoon heat scorching 95F degrees.

Most likely combination people taking virus seriously states new outbreaks, also congregating indoors AC higher rates well. bet saw Fl governor ‚Äòcooking books‚Äô get numbers lower thought, ‚ÄòI cook book‚Äô. 
I doubt anymore people dumb Reading article seeing current proespective treatments...did anyone ""contagious zombie cancer"" bingo card? agree. Hopefully people learn mistakes made Texas. things went well help states reopen. Early reopened phase 1 many people still relatively vigilant wearing masks maintaining social distance. 

Then phase 2 went barely two weeks phase 1 started real time observe case increase. People large still pretty good mask protocol. Sure vocal mouth breathers bitched it, least businesses responsible grocery stores recommending/mandating customers use masks. Case load increased, unsustainably. immediately phase 2 decided reasonable capacity limits weren‚Äôt necessary bars restaurants could return 75% capacity. leave 25% seats empty, operate 75% fire marshal capacity. Rarely bars restaurants ever get fire marshal capacity might well full reopen point. 

Then sometime around Memorial Day month back reopen large number people decided didn‚Äôt care masks anymore bars operate capacity again. People blame protests didn‚Äôt help, least folks masked up. real issue accelerated phased reopen without regard phase progressing. I‚Äôm Florida see many younger people wearing masks right thing older people. work restaurant people complain limited seating/make fun us wearing masks boomers. OK Karen. Sounds like job...for federal. Government. paying businesses stay closed providing financial aid unprecedented crisis please corporate masters.

And China fine, know they're article. Newsom Yesterday CA conducted 76k #COVID19 rate: 5.7% 7 rate Imperial County, however, 23%. Hospitals today we‚Äôre working county reinstate stay home take seriously. PA resident mandated masks third phase reopening, answer is: No. know... course testing important. they're exactly making case ignoring creation kind continuum risk. helps people make decisions they're going make anyway creates confidence decision making. lack discussion airborne transmission indoors continues staggeringly stupid cool really Florida?

In county, California, 24 hours. Wow, week really way long wait. course, we're still seeing numbers county Florida seeing (per capita), I'm guessing waits could get longer too. Relevant username?  Approximately.

NYS ""Pause"" started March 22. Texas may big States Rights afford local governments. recent example Abbott henchmen sued Dallas county mandatory sick time provision workers. get there. Someone, somewhere find something useful containing virus. miss 0, 0.1% (already corrected).

However data posted irrelevant.

CFR = Case Fatality Rate = deaths / number confirmed cases

Official data Israel:

20-39 yrs old:

4 deaths/\~7,000 confirmed cases = less 0.1%

&amp;#x200B;

Of course IFR significantly lower. plugging hole human lives? thanks. Let company die instead. ...That‚Äôs works. sectors still working home. work higher ed college cautious supporting work home whenever possible,about 90% working home full time. Yes old people died. 5000 people 10m+. virus nearly bad guys wanted be. That's pity - article sub starts Oxford Expert says (because ride Oxford's reputation) them. 

Are aware IFR estimation, averaged calculations done random pre-prints, many terrible quality, excluding large government surveys published?

That version meta-analysis. hard time thinking person cares less safety well employees McMahon. documented multiple times poorly treats wrestlers. need open, cautiously. Small stores like barbershops, tattoo shops, car dealerships check temps people, book appointment only. 

Larger stores need enforce masks social distancing. registers open 4, since there‚Äôs 20+ don‚Äôt allow 3 people per line. Places pack people together need stay closed. Bars, clubs, sporting events on. volunteering 16 months country locked down. daily updates helpful actually appreciated trusting government once. context, United States already know expectations low trusting government. really sad hear honestly became home seeing used work load laid forced go markets daily due lack refrigeration savings really difficult. hope get I'm sure it'll happen tourism gone foreseeable future we'll see do. couple months ago people told idiot said India get hit bad. told locked really early issues. are. never got one made much last year. 

I‚Äôm making anything close made last year. 

Fuck. economy going tank regardless actually philly news reported seeing spike cases. ... one loves enough tell you. last 2 important things, thinks countries ideology wars cause France rich countries follow China India knowing they're best way heal patients said politics also cause think they're better medecine doctors Trump supporting Raoult great medical organizations US shit like countries. also said something interesting US, americans bad life expectancy new treatments US anything good, better use old treatments stated Raoult (he said new traitments good) Trump followed Lancet's statement saying treatment bad Trump listened Raoult said Lancet shit dosage cause following deaths (only India, China, Saudi Arabia countries around, Africa know use treatment). work medical field lot documentation sent members required 8th grade reading level. 

It sounds like speaking 1st grade level. much ghoulish enthusiasm scientists! Thank spelling better did! precisely it. that's just... disappointing SR dropped rather crucial piece communique. americans stupid? Start gambling stocks, way fun, that's people doing.

Just bet stocks go anymore, bull market over. That‚Äôs reasonable response question. cannot simply completely stop society want over. 

Everyone trying prepper reason one could get toilet paper start this. Total shutdown needed not, you‚Äôre going government needs distribute supplies. anticipate number new normal Florida atleast month. saw numbers NY, still cold New Yorkers didn‚Äôt Disney worlds beaches visit, best could. Also could blame population density, public transportation novel nature disease. Florida complain ? - actions? Reopen leadership, every instance I‚Äôve seen regarding COVID, stick guns test positive. that, mean fuck many people possible potentially get people killed self absorbed delusion. may said, mean wrong. virus called upon november, data europe kinda suggests virus Europe november maybe even late october. august spread unlikely. Also flu season 2018-2019 pretty bad compared bad flu seasons. making presumption based circumstantial data. still believe covid 19 story becoming weirder every new piece info. way lot poeple , including Fauci kinda trying defend China(actuakky government China) pretty weird. mean outbreak started china people scared get packages huge propaganda around packages safe (without really data sustain claim) china bans salmon import europe chicken US providing little evidence whether meat contaminated especially infect anyone world instead stand ban said nothing... Bible literally says avoid places plague. Sigh. 

Why get stupider? Seems like Florida depopulate time climate change erode populated coasts. Again, **it‚Äôs impossible know specific videos you‚Äôre referring to**, I‚Äôm surprised amount time effort you‚Äôll take respond me, instead simply citing source. man's brain 'backfire.' Thank you! Texas re-closed bars (drinking inside, still allowing to-go cups). ...

That part growth. Exponential growth zero proportion infected people show symptoms.

Put another way, different headline:

""LESS 10% ASYMPTOMATIC RATE INDIGENOUS VILLAGES""

Separate effect:

Outbreaks follow exponential growth! follow sigmoidal growth. Infecting every last person \*difficult\*.

It takes time/travel make jump one village next. ""100% people ultimately infected"" lot easier accomplish ""100% infected short enough time span they're showing symptoms time"". think certain point even Texas politicians know flooded hospitals good look

Really it‚Äôs late Uh, brother, aren‚Äôt. Minnesota 500 new cases today. cases rising.

Also, again, you‚Äôre saying thousands people standing shoulder shoulder yelling impact spike kids beach bar did? won‚Äôt lie protests mistake ways, way contain people‚Äôs pent anger frustration cop summarily executed another guy middle street people watched. Way many people sick brutality many stuck home, losing jobs, etc. inevitable. classic deaths intersection paradigm. Nobody ever puts light certain amount people died could prevented put light sooner. Ok well anyone wants come valid plan ensures families like mine survive shutdowns furloughs, I‚Äôm it. we‚Äôve got inept government doesn‚Äôt give two shits caring citizens, terms pandemic safety nets general, then, fend ourselves. Injecting lungs apparently. I‚Äôm getting dragged Twitter right asking politician report stores following protocol. There‚Äôs going back. It‚Äôs going burn population.  vaccine we're hoping come fall btw

edit: actually, i'm sure is, someone clarify? Absolutely. That‚Äôs normal path. ebbing flowing flu season. 

But one different, I‚Äôm creating new virus type class: Kamikaze Virus. 

It‚Äôs unexpected. It‚Äôs ‚Äúfollowing rules.‚Äù What‚Äôs source? thinking anybody cares thoughts matter. saw link pneumonia deaths wish could find Florida

But 3 terrible places could care less health Floridians.

That means care

^^at ^^least ^^a ^^little SC percent positive rate 18.3% later defended President Donald Trump's controversial decision resume large campaign rallies despite pandemic, saying Americans right freedom speech assembly. 

PENCE said Fauci. Please reread article. common issue across non-liberal world. Italy wanted 150k serological survey, 1 month managed test 40k people people answer phone call they're scared lock home get test.

Shutting sex would absolutely stop HIV.  Florida announced morning they're preventing bars serving alcohol inside, affectively forcing close again. Racist stupid. Love comment talking president taken politics, things like left up. also forgot 2 trillion stimulus package basically went smoke benefit (of us) whatsoever. collective memory fucking goldfish. almost world wide pandemic going hurt economy without closures lock downs (sweden) would've better prioritizing citizens. million vets year. border ""closed"" long time, crossing allowed essential reasons US nationals/residents returning home.

If look death statistics Florida, already that. point, think Fauci could run Indi candidate beat Mr.  resident, I'm sorry break you, exponential spread phase, already late. Even asshole governor shuts everything 100% immediately, STILL going lose lot people. question is, put political agenda aside longer downplay virus, staying Trump's speed dial still important lives residents? might partially right, also wrong. disease already killed 120000 people country. flu killed less 40k people states 2018. already significantly worse trending upward. minimum 200k die America alone. flu ever done that.

That's you. common problem vaccines.

If significantly reduced efficiency older persons, prioritize vaccinations younger people 1st, especially work elderly, slow spread. Essentially, get vaccine people effective 1st manufacturing limitations. 90% effective younger adults 50% effective older, reduce spread giving younger 1st.

We also several vaccines testing, may find one effective elderly another also prioritize accordingly. That's old people saying pawn blame. I‚Äôm disappointed country. don‚Äôt know caused people think way, it‚Äôs absurd. People think it‚Äôs fine we‚Äôre one countries still big problem COVID 3 months ago Yeah unfortunately think anyone provide us timeframe. many unknowns obvious variables aka cooperation, make anything take long time.
Still think visual awareness start. even family members lost loved one tell thier experience. think many people disconnected virus doing. people kids teens adults, might bring cooperation challenge. Interesting...where choruses calling Abbott traitor threatening violence? Someone tell Rogan longer safe Yep, me. I've basically given him. Yeah, listen Bill Gates medical issues, right?

I'm refuting horrible health crisis experiencing, I'm going stick listening doctors, hacks unleash crapware world. still know people realised works yet. There's getting you, much clear. normal person looking long list sources see Swedish government plain simply denying pursuing herd immunity.

Test, contact trace, wear mask... rocket science. mistaken belief first epidemic world last 40 years. 

You also mistaken belief working classes way paying expenses middle classes cease work close businesses due current epidemic. 

And also mistaken belief anyone required governmental enforced closures businesses, home hobbies. Microban, Mediclean, Benzarid, etc. liquid disinfectants meant pump-sprayers.

Basically used keywords I'm mistaken translated english mandarin. paper keywords correct actual wordings chinese would use search terms. saw post ago saying protests basically attributed nothing spikes corona virus cases around U.S. genuine question: close want people long mask we're outside? impression needed stay six feet part even everyone wearing masks. I'm even sure pants anymore. it, thing Italy places hit hard early. know like.. 
 
The issue around long haul people eventually get relaxed second wave NY. That's like someone asks room dirty respond know dirty looked.

It mean there's fewer cases, know testing started. ton teachers older, near 60's. hope there's way keep teachers safe all. Adding kids vectors certainly mean virus hit everyone vaccine ready though. 

The detriment quality education going significant, impact public health would much worse, think. ""Dr. Bosch colleagues went back even further, examining nine samples taken every weeks months January 2018 December 2019. single sample, taken March 12, 2019, got positive result tests virus."" 

Only 1 positive sample can't retest, almost certainly false positive. Now, multiple samples March testing positive, would say something. CDC expected death %

Indiana: 100

Illinois: 116

Tennessee: 97

Ohio: 95

Virginia: 106

West Virginia: play causes deaths, can‚Äôt play gross numbers. Illinois Virginia seeing higher overall expected deaths.  country embarrassment planet. don‚Äôt think catching flies dude; killing them. Rolling eyes reading gov‚Äôs comment. beginning March, many countries around world began lockdown, super concerned American. thought ‚Äúthere‚Äôs way we‚Äôd able lockdown like them, won‚Äôt happen, culture won‚Äôt allow it, even would likely considered unconstitutional.‚Äù lo-and -behold country came together locked down. 

That is, issue mask wearing became political original fears wouldn‚Äôt able lockdown actually came being. love country freedom allows us, fuck sake fellow Americans fucking dumb. I‚Äôm convinced that. think elderly teachers staff members allowed take paid medical leave, doubt kids suffer emotionally intellectually can‚Äôt go school. poor also suffer disproportionately can‚Äôt afford childcare. Wait till extra unemployment money stops end July... backfire states mandated masks? Comon california!! need number 1 real, really seem like that... sorta hard believe people actually fucking stupid It‚Äôs culture job agreeable doctor. Everybody FMLAd years type ‚Äúmedical condition‚Äù. mask use gone 5% use 99% work. don‚Äôt really care 1% may may legitimate excuse. governor. Houston San Antonio made masks mandatory decided needed supersede local governments knock orders. turned political issue nearly everywhere go it‚Äôs 50/50 masks. cities finally found ‚Äúloophole‚Äù mandate businesses mandate masks worn, still grocery store plenty folks refuse. colossal public health failure. It‚Äôs maddening. Im sure nice see, time kind sad reach level severity taken seriously. things hit rock bottom people react. Instead people trying avoid rock bottom first place. read Disneyland California, totally believe it. dude that's pretty impressive. honestly expect obama brought completely unrelated post. We‚Äôre fucked! people infect others, people travel state state share it. governor getting shit staying closed well dumb fucks going make nothing ""You people""? heard that's racist now?

Anyway, people actually care facts? Honest question remember Cohen testifying congress looked sounded like half deathbeds. fuck teenager 300 people parties!  worry, hide them. Dem gators glades gladly scarf corona corpses.

/politicians certain side aisle guess guns work all. everyone knows CEBM track record is. straight misread comment thought trying compare coronavirus plague spring year 1212 something prediction rest year rookie numbers gotta bump numbers difference New York competent Governor got track, Florida's governor stubborn act. Warning signs there, predicted, mocked Spring Break, shouted afterward, entirely ignored leadership. get long list quotes North Korean government officials saying North Korean 0 cases 0 deaths.

Please do. would actually find fascinating.

Heres joke return:

[TinTin ordering food] ""I would like large vegetarian pizza extra cheese, SWEDENS INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS HERD IMMUNITY STRATEGY FAILED, breadsticks please.""   really sucks seat assignment

Studies shown boarding/deboarding faster method. Bars never open first place tbh. Lets first find something works younger people. Philly outdoor seating number places summer hot &amp; humid temperatures regularly hitting 30 35 C / 86 95 F, sometimes 38+ C/100+ F. really *that* much hotter Texas? imagine typical July temperatures bit hotter people could go later evening morning before/after peak afternoon heat. education system isn't. I'd selling belongings getting ready live car work called back. unemployment systems ancient unreliable. *lose-lose pretty sure u.s. still sending people home back nursing homes this. catastrophic failure. Florida's statistics found (scroll past table county-by-county metrics, charts historical case death metrics).

Deaths yesterday came 44 new deaths, today far 39, time comment 3:20pm Florida.

Deaths though lagging indicator, sustained case-growth, indicated 7-day moving average cases Florida, seems hit inflection point June 2nd. cases become hospitalizations hospitalizations carry turn deaths.

Right though seem change death trends, look 7-day moving average, pretty reliably around 30-40 people.

June 2nd + 3 weeks = June 23rd, means would expected see uptick deaths soon already.

Where deaths seeing data? possibilities consider.

1. new uptick cases, Florida still plenty ICU capacity even need critical care kept alive ventilators ICU intervention
2. Medical staff able learn previous outbreaks, using better treatments therapies could meaningfully changing lethality disease's progression, reducing death rates.
3. time new cases deaths exact science, deaths could still materialize coming weeks.
4. COVID deaths misclassified Pneumonia / Influenza deaths. State data Florida Pneumonia Influenza Mortality Surveillance National Center Health Statistics Mortality Surveillance System show year seen marked increase percentage deaths P&amp;I compared last 5 years. worst P&amp;I spike last five years year weeks 4-7 2017-2018 flu season, P&amp;I made 8.3 8.5% deaths Florida. year week 12 flu season Florida already attributing 8.8% deaths P&amp;I (worst last 5 years) jumped 10.8% week 14, since come back \~5%. last data points CDC week 25, currently week 29, missing 4 weeks data. wait see P&amp;I deaths tick back newer data becomes available.
5. median age patients Coronavirus right also way Florida, following median ages county reported 2020-06-19 (see Seminole - 26, Orange - 29, Duval - 30, Hillsborough - 31, Broward - 33, Dade - 41, Palm Beach - 40. know younger patients higher survival rate, people becoming sick, population patients less likely succumb disease.

In reality, there's probably mix 5 things listed bunch factors list consider keeping death rate right now.

Should celebrate fact death rate staying low? Yes no. Yes, time avoid loss life take win. No, right still soon know increase cases eventually translate increase deaths, cautious count chickens hatch. also concerned many younger people exposed new virus, long term effect still unknown. could witnessing entire generation negatively impacted rest lives, ways may serious effects quality life and, economic lens, ability meaningfully contribute workforce amount ongoing care might need. Anyone telling right understand long term effects disease (in either direction, dire nothing worry about) either liar time-traveler.

Frustratingly, best thing wait collect data, kind respectful one another taking simple common sense precautions keep safe, including maintaining proper social distance, wearing masks public, washing hands avoiding touching faces. hope death rate stays low states impacted right now, I'm California myself, seeing case numbers increase well.

I hope answers question, stay safe there. ""Those learn history doomed repeat it."" - person smart enough wear mask probably. Especially total numbers go up.

I think triage done differently. Many people sent home self-care self-quarantine, since done hospital often OTC meds. people go home oxygen instructions check oxygen levels, I'd prefer get it. Extraordinary times call extraordinary measures. right, faced novel virus important thing caution positivity. It‚Äôs complete separation reality. You‚Äôre grossly overstating ‚Äúcraziness‚Äù. may wrong way getting logical therefore it‚Äôs likely challenging underlying assumptions would fruitful. 

I think maybe you‚Äôre one that‚Äôs confident knowledge would rather people left field ideas go away challenge assumptions. I'd take bill Gates advice health lol.
People dum Unreal desantis call florida ""heaven's waiting room"" pretty recently? honestly hope ill intent states nothing walk directly cliff. time petition fucks waive rights medical treatment. sounds harsh fuck, they're us world even harsher. good know!

Fauci said great things reinvigorate notion today.  technically incentive hospitals categorize deaths covid would receive funding per death federal government. Something like $72k instead $30k - don‚Äôt quote numbers, investigations found evidence happening anywhere.

Furthermore many states, populous ones (except NY) actually require positive lab test blood sample categorize death covid related, it‚Äôs even possible states mis-categorize deaths get funding. 

It‚Äôs also interesting states don‚Äôt require lab test require ‚Äúprobable symptoms‚Äù classify death covid related taking approach order lower numbers. includes Florida couple southern states. almost didnt listen god punishing them.

Righties sudden going start citing UN Reports get Americans go back work? Didn‚Äôt answer question, 

Yes did. Post source backs assertion hospitals stating deaths. original claim seem intent running from.

Again, isn‚Äôt trick. Either sources don‚Äôt, don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs win also you‚Äôre repeating false information! ""Mild."" still sounds awful. Every medical professional know told two weeks ago cases **would spike drastically due protests**...and think skipped part said **protesting part spike**, sole part.

yeah uh huh brother

Your wording much different two posts. Cases even close ""spiking drastically"" Minnesota, NYC, Maryland/Virginia. plateauing decreasing. really amazing profit motives certain industries.

e.g. feel like restaurants really well private ownership there's universal way make food enjoyable, there's room competition innovation. Standards vary lot restaurant restaurant.

But municipal utility services really well public ownership there's really one job: keep utilities safe consistent. standards vary. way compete companies local monopolies (like internet providers do).

Historically, utility companies transferred private for-profit ownership, price goes quality service goes down.

Airlines, think, like utility companies.    feel way. I‚Äôm wits end this. Even one fortunate that‚Äôs financially secure, distance fear taking toll. telling ‚Äúit‚Äôll soon,‚Äù evidence trending contrary there‚Äôs solid proof ever vaccine. Pair potential lifelong complications even moderate cases I‚Äôm scared practically time.

We‚Äôre together, even doesn‚Äôt seem like it.  book advance. would compare Sweden Indiana?    
Compare Sweden Denmark, Finland, Norway... 11,5 times **less** patients ICU 3 **together**.    
What Belgium (1.5 million pop) honest deaths counts hardly hit? 32 patients ICU.         
Italy, 105 patients 6 times inhabitants.    
Germany, 300 patients 8 times 250 number half re-opened. 

Who tell numbers Sweden going increase? bet considering curve. Word.

If think thousands, sometimes hundreds thousands people walking shoulder shoulder chanting yelling zero impact spike you‚Äôre complete denial. Many lacked masks even wear reduced effectiveness yelling.

It doesn‚Äôt diminish purpose protests, absolute unwillingness put responsibility something almost every healthcare professional warned juvenile. still hasn‚Äôt mandated masks. Nobody wearing masks it‚Äôs ‚Äúsuggestion‚Äù

Good thing smart counties taking upon require masks inside businesses face fines. course Abbott defending saying he‚Äôs always allowed local governments power since original executive order confusion never explicitly stated.

We know studies spanish flu economic damage caused government rules, caused fucking pandemic itself.

Maybe majority Arizonans want keep bars open. Cool. 40% people go even close pandemic rages, number likely going like 60% real soon rate.

That kill 60% restaurants. going do? Make mandatory go out?

The best way short sharp pain. China likely grow 2020 Germany &lt;4% unemployment rate.

So much greedy fucking stupid guys. made America great again. Best pandemic numbers since Spanish flu. Rock approx 30 BMI tall. sure technicality impossible 30 BMI low BF.

Enjoy police force there. hire young healthy substitutes positions? seriousness, I'd rather challenge someone grow fuck challenge figure ""strong"" means.

I'm worried reading comprehension here. seem one struggling.  Island continent, dipshit. billionaire caving didn‚Äôt already people working? Ducey issued plea public

Doesn't quite apocalyptic flair it?

Goddamnit, guys. know people wear masks? listen health professionals? think whole thing conspiracy control them?

It's *little* digging shows lot headlines straight deceptive. Stop shit. REASON people trust anybody. Companies end leases, go work-from-home permanently, quality life goes w/out commute... Wages could also go w/out pay costly offices/power/utilities/etc... put following prayers every night:

""Dear Lord, 

Please absolve populous desire post WaPo Links. know paywall place faces average human."" like 75%+ ""Please! Everyone please!........""

*Starts sucking dick* That‚Äôs still one step closer universal, though would want take. nope, that's literally ideologically convenient. put damn mask quit acting like spoiled children. crazy literally sex unprotected lower risk catching STD vs going house getting corona..they need come vaccine plz really trying die hill I'm even on.

I knock research. knocked article properly contextualizing existing research. speak everyone? Read article see 3 sentences there's nothing worry employer operates way regarding inclement weather.

""If dont think safely make in, please stay home...We want anyone get hurt...This job worth life...""

It'd still count unexcused absence, whether call not. Get many terminated. know Disney getting lot flak, looks like extent listening to. remember lot places already open Florida including Busch Gardens, sea world, Universal Orlando Islands adventure, well number small amusement water parks. Yes Disney big, places still open.  Sounds like someone said director public health threatened, way around.  ""Dont go work"" . Easier said done least could do? beard mask seal. Also ""wear mask"" put chin ear. work either. know this? dont know. Stop juvenille Sandy Hook crap. making things up.  ‚ÄúThe media‚Äù isn‚Äôt providing hours-long live streams skipped answering comment.  Protestors handing masks bystanders. 


Nice Sandy Hookin‚Äô indeed. lived Houston I'd shelter sure. leave could.

Yesterday articles saud 97% ICU capacity, thought game already.

With luck also people getting young require fewer hospitalizations.

Now theoretical chance something. POSSIBLE avoid becomes like Lombardy Madrid, doctors choose patients treat leave die. think walked back TMC portion available hospital capacity Houston, causing unwarranted level concern. doubts. 10 times many folks would expect significant proportion cases would appear ‚Äòappeared spontaneously‚Äô. unscientific experience opposite, lot friends believing already COVID, date none tested positive. Yes, human nature want go back normal. reason narrative billionaires government bowing economic pressure rather protect everyone instincts. 

Everyone wants reopen, bad idea it. reason we're moving forward anyway economic pressure, largely billionaires. Americans selfish. don‚Äôt want pay health care others. mention Medicare all, response get. Texas one obese sticken states. Haha used steal return time addict. Good times (not really) I'm part reason need team lol stop getting depressed every time see news?

It‚Äôs non stop constant shit awful US general population is, many fellow Americans fucking beyond stupid. incomprehensibly stupid. depressingly upsettingly incredibly unbearably stupid. parents moved Florida to. shit started, ready live retirement style. I‚Äôm worried since many fucking assholes think it‚Äôs end world wear mask. many fucking idiots think political ploy hoax. Apparently 120k Americans died 3 months reason according them. 

FUkInG LiBTaRdS cHinA vIrUS hOax aMirITe?

I‚Äôm NYC where, even though one hottest spots country, think decent job. locked down, subways public places still empty right now. took subway rush hour people subway. still see masks everywhere far tell.

If people weren‚Äôt fucking idiots, know, listened doctors instead fucking reality star, Karen Facebook read Fox article once. 

God damn all. NJ took seriously dramatically reduced spread still aren‚Äôt even fully open. (No indoor dining, gyms, etc.)

Other places didn‚Äôt take seriously, merely avoided horrific spread opened everything (for part).

It‚Äôs wonder places right back left off. I'm conservative state. people wear masks. wear one never anyone give weird look say anything weird me. perception get people around feel need wear mask suspect that's there's inconsistent messaging it. **‚ÄúArizona state crisis¬†right now. One five tests come back¬†positive.¬†It's 20% positivity tests¬†taken Arizona,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúIt's scary.‚Äù**  Arizona deals surge Covid-19 cases, Tucson 10 beds intensive care units available population 560,000 people, Mayor Regina Romero said.

My comment (mayor echos bit) Ducey held another press conference today &amp; mandate masks &amp; rolling back re-openings, including casinos, bars, etc. issuing stay home orders. Coping what? Lockdowns flatten curve ""You tell metal sharp all."" weighs less duck, made wood therefore witch! easy not, surge capability end day. yes, hospitals around laying well, happens limit elective surgeries.  Relentless mutations. heavy weight RNA virus. kind thing.

They become Kamikaze type viruses, really don‚Äôt care kill hosts. 

Which different current Virology thought.

Combing R values measles &amp; death stats Ebola.

AKA: Kamikaze virus.  Pretty sure nobody wants level shutdown. Well, maybe folks bomb shelters Wyoming...  he? Sounds like he‚Äôs taking half measures taken months ago secure isolation tents stop spreading it? dunno would handle ebola?  idiots downvoting ? Absolutely right 2 square miles hospitals 100,000 employees. largest hospital complex entire world.  February personal responsibility FL, wouldn‚Äôt spread. earlier expected good call- buy bidets toilet paper now- going another supply shortage soon. *only* 56%... alarming... vast majority protestors masks hope BBS set backup case fax machine breaks. Stupid yes. 

America ahead places conspiracy theory belief though. imagine thanks Internet others catching up. Hey also Northwest Florida, experience exact mine. I‚Äôm server busy restaurant 3 servers come positive. didn‚Äôt even verbally tell us, posted inside kitchen big deal. left immediately told going get tested would come back work test results came back. think we‚Äôre half staff 110 servers. It‚Äôs going get bad soon. course not, community spread drastically reduced still there, good news said reduction allows focus outbreak control early testing, contact tracing isolation, risk outbreak time spotted spreads community transmission always going get much higher people go vacation country opens international tourism. wait help leadership. Assume isn‚Äôt any. Read best data get hands prepare accordingly, regardless governmental guidance. Texans special kind stupid Half way year people still understand difference CFR IFR. Hope original sample. put monuments traitors now? Cause won? problem governor tied hands cities rendering us incapable anything. Last estimate saw 20 million people infected US. even attempt trace number contacts. Texas entered chat.

17% Thursday. Waiting Friday update. spent first forty years life fundamentalist Christianity. confirm. pretty much nailed it. focusing small number people. 

In California, hundred protestors state almost 40 million people. Polls showed protestors represent Californian's preferences. 

Heck, even represent American's preferences overall, still majority Americans, 56%, conclude country's moving quickly reopen, 15% say it‚Äôs moving slowly 29% believe country moving right pace. It‚Äôs great thing governor fantastic &amp; diverse state Texas listening people &amp; he‚Äôs willing whatever takes make sure mistake doesn‚Äôt happen again; besides, part opening quick soon led unbearable increase COVID-19 cases, many positive &amp;, worse yet, among young people üëÇüëçüèª SARS MERS corona virus diseases SARS-CoV MERS-CoV. Confusing names right? Almost nobody understands them... (/s) guy happy lol right primitive screwheads, let's try again, shall we?

Wear ducking masks.  ususal. extra payments treatments given. Anyone ability make Covid case make procedure Yeah I‚Äôm sure going dinner lot hundreds thousands people marching streets masks getting pepper spray teargas makes people cough. assume stay linear even though new daily cases tripled. Go back time three weeks set daily counts causing icu spike, extrapolate current case counts long term.

300 turn quickly 900 depending long takes turn things around.but napkin math

 hospital system projecting get 900 icu patients next two weeks either right right, I'm betting u/davidg111 u/davidg111 Well, see, said there's nothing worry 1) increased testing showing cases 2) there's higher positivity rate test results primarily due 3) increased community transmission. 
 
It's perfectly rational, need worry thing. 
 
I wish kidding. bar Los Angeles opened back up. 

Gotta assume closing right back soon. numbers pretty similar Texas. thing backfire base.

""YOU COME BACK HORSE GODDAMN IT."" That‚Äôs need do. instead, we‚Äôre cutting testing. Also, White House defunding TX sites. mean, disease fade away, right? damn dirty liberal types lmao. Plenty Californians smaller towns want things like state here, I've also heard things like breaking California 5 separate states. Wouldnt know it, would homogenize demographics, rural hicks would different governor liberalish central valley, leftish bay area, diverse southern california.

Or something like that. pay secessionist's governing plans much mind. They're new age confederates. Phase 3 trials usually last 1 year order test long term side effects. 

I'm 100% sure Oxford Moderna started phase 3 trials.

But started around May/June, September around start idea vaccines actually working. course, preliminary data.

Here's good link CDC describing phase exactly they're testing  Ditto Houston. Gulf coast humidity + ‚Äúsummer‚Äù heat April October = indoors AC blast.

Edit: it‚Äôs constant doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs non-factor. means never ending factor. Canada 300 cases day. fucking terrifies border open one day. flu bro I‚Äôm holding terribly.

But seriously, PM address, I'll send tortillas Albuquerque Tortilla Factory. Could probably shelf stable green chile, too. :) Good test case. Right now, looks like outside pretty low risk. impact masks that? 

We know U.S., evidence increase cases protests. participants wearing masks though.

 Now, Russia, masks gathering outside similar numbers.

If surge, help give evidence masks outside causes risk low.

Of course, Russia dishonest U.S. numbers, we'll see. one understands exponential growth unless you‚Äôve really looked it. Great *American* Haircut Protests WAY back year April 2020. comment totally civil.   Americans are. Cities? depends.

On one level i'm sad beause people trapped part country want follow good health advice kept safe, people get ill die happening around them.

On another level, certain number warnings, guess situation Texans chosen themselves. is, thru actions, want state. 

People warned them. People shared lots data science led example. Texas said ""nah, let 'er rip.""

So....ok, let 'er rip. fun guys. fucking whine nobody warned you, government hand-selected failed you. set motion defiant warnings, pleas even, take precautions. I've going store... local stores require masks, people keep distance, feel safe enough.

It's ideal try bigger shops less often minimize risk point acknowledge can't avoid exposure.

I think probably safest getting delivery, terms think healthy live fear time. need get house mental well even slightly elevates physical risk covid. I'm going winter unless Yeah mortalty went doctors got better treating patients, much good hospitals get overwhelmed.

But virus mutated got less lethal, would good. (This normal viruses, would great happened.) Driving Black? means damn thing going make mandatory.

Edit: ah see edited initially said. I'd like see actual proof. said New York hospitals full months ago footage proved otherwise. actually used footage Italian hospital look think otherwise Wait, stopped elective cases yet? hospital 3/4 full ICU beds 2 things covid related. normal year fill time. Cool. investors? oppose this?

Well know do, feel like not... they're gonna get away it. See kinda hit ground months ago initially shutdown. decided jump ground free fall again. Soooo, however long takes shutdown/roll back reopenings. Well even need ventilator think fair njmber still need ICU Dallas, Texas decided allow large gatherings 100 people, mentioned 4th July celebrations still underway. large event called Kaboomtown normally 400,000 visitors. recently moved undisclosed location, sure stop people hunting down. quite mess Yup.

That's totally different actively *dying* illness. people chronic issues live normal life span. People worn masks adhered physical distancing largely east downtown. (San Gabriel Valley, etc.) west side closer beaches people are...and abiding guidelines. Factor recent protests well. completely true backed lot science enough known long immune system protects us virus yet. know long-term impact median cases. Texans still refusing wear masks public supposedly taking away freedoms, killing others. I'm reading seeing learning! I've tried explain masks work can't use ADA say disability business let in.

Not person would care. understand many respiratory viruses passed person person develop symptoms speaking breathing? infectious diseases incubation period, means days catch you‚Äôll incorrectly think you‚Äôre healthy.

If people think they‚Äôre healthy want go to, say grocery store without mask, responsible long hold breath entire time they‚Äôre store.

We‚Äôre going beach public lot makes nervous. really risk seems pretty comparable staying city week Well, saying overrun COVID-19 tad misleading. 20% ICU beds COVID positive patients. mean can't generate ICU beds nothing, minor oversight. happens every year almost every major big city hospital flu season. often put overflow patients pacu emergency department. abnormal all.  Bet billboards forcibly posted hospital CEO's cars they'd forced sing new tune what's unwarranted. virus spreading private gatherings homes

Birthday parties, anniversaries, graduation parties, visiting parents.

All death traps.

Stay fuck home.

Barring that, visit outside mask couple people. seems reasonably safe. usually counter revolutionaries. Look I'm saying thing going happen. likely wont happen although rioting seems probable certain circumstances.

That said, think perfect storm brewing massive civil unrest things break wrong way. *a lot* bored, angry, unemployed young people there. People may school go back to, may sports distract them. know trying bring stuff back recent surges good sign that.

If ever time seriously concerned stability country right now. Totally man. level ignorance I'm seeing around Reddit honestly scary me. think Americans like think, like do. whole Americans selfish. know somebody going come post mine call bigot, I'm glad I've wasted time. it‚Äôs mike pence, people. evolutionary denying Vice President. tested trypanosoma, babesia, CJD, malaria... means get keep giving hugs future.

Outside masks counter productive. elderly high risk restaurant bar anyway. 

We getting wearing masks waiting vaccine. pass young become background irritant. Kentucky cases people traveling well. Also, two families know recently traveled Panama City Beach. lovely time weeks. True. personal experience never lines get flu shot. usually access free flu shots. set appointments, procedure takes minutes, done right little exposure short amount time. 

Been pleasantly surprised precautions doctor's office visit 2 months ago. Luckily location currently control, ramps later fall, worried. Overflow overflow. COVID grows exponentially, things land people ICU don't.

Put thinking cap on.  Healthcare doesn‚Äôt really work way. way insurance concept, private single payer, works, people putting money people taking out. Insurance isn‚Äôt money tree. can‚Äôt make work everyone gets put (at least, monetarily speaking). indeed absolutely people insurance cost them: healthy wealthy. Now, I‚Äôm arguing current system working, something like Medicare single payer isn‚Äôt good idea. point simply overlap Venn diagrams favor current system vs alternatives going match pretty well diagram healthy money vs chronically ill don‚Äôt. cheaper drug dealers (It takes 6 weeks see uptick, won‚Äôt seeing potential protest uptick another 2 weeks)  America first! great again, yet? know deaths increase again.

Sure thing, sure lots proof. listen doctors nurses say it. Sweden's 518 deaths per million flex bro. seventh worst planet.

Here's Arizona's latest case/death charts, 7-day looking good. I‚Äôm always amazed people think don‚Äôt need insurance young. Glad needed it. Serology deeply problematic due cross reactivity endemic coronaviruses. seems (albeit minimal) analysis 'native' serology ~10% significant variance. 


It's really quite difficult give solid number 'this many people caught it'. 20% likely far high realistic, however. There's thing empty hospital unless operational all. Even pandemic there's always people treated - many hospitals 50% full times. saw really dumb attempt convince people conspiracy among medical community, believed because, well... think obvious believed it.  normal ICU capacity? get from? Southern cities definitely accents lol. lived south 6 years. heard way accents southern cities Cincinnati. cognitive dissonance anti-intellectualism certain Americans time something sociologists studying decades come. opposed 85-90% capacity like days. No. got billed $350 1 generic 20mg pantoprazole getting ulcer pains. get 60 40mg month $7.75. asked sister could bring bottle home. said no. False. Austria removed order end May.

You shop, eat, go bar masks. Thank level headed response. personally idea ICU beds near capacity always good data showing that. 

Having said such, still concerns COVID-19 rise states like TX small 20-30% buffer likely exceeded short time surge cases they‚Äôre seeing. want hope best people especially states hit hardest right now, seems make lot sense react stop thing (honestly should‚Äôve proactive never got here) opposed letting spikes happen top apparently already stressed ICU system. took work day election day year. Hoping wake celebratory hangover. Beautifully written. Thank you. wholeheartedly agree. beyond angry well. 

Maybe, eventually, real change come this. now, let everyone see awful America. Active cases Norway hundreds experiment definitely wont reliably translate countries. Americans wont even wear masks want us vote *more* regulation?

Sorry, we're stupid understand what's good us. Either we're scared ghost Joseph McCarthy good news dont die get itemized bill. bad news way pay it.  Remember November vote Oh. thought making joke?

*taps head* terrifying. happen? anyone ill-informed also sure themselves? 

Like, clip would funny except fact midst public health crisis. honestly worries share country people like this. want deal happened west. told us March needed avoid using hospitals overwhelm emergency departments, (WA, OR) took seriously. non-essential surgeries cancelled. May, many local hospital chains recording giant deficits result. 

E.g. UW Medicine lost 500 mils first 5 months Coronavirus costs coupled loss discretionary business form elective procedures. start furloughing thousands employees cut costs. 

I'm saying they're greedy bastards. are. given run hospitals, even University teaching affiliated ones, profit businesses, kinda choice. Oh godddd isn‚Äôt fucking source, it‚Äôs conservative rag publication. Excuse me? No, means video (preferably multiple videos) taken real people rather MSM propaganda. comment made burst laughing. talk certain group people life playing safe, distancing, wearing masks. talk another group people life apparently I'm overreacting make feel like I'm crazy. comment exactly need say non-believers finally get it. Thanks laugh. delayed cases long enough mortality reducing drug treatments found. shutdown saved thousands lives delay alone. I‚Äôve thought lot, I‚Äôm honestly torn. I‚Äôve religiously gotten flu shot every year long remember.

But COVID I‚Äôm avoiding going much can.

The idea relatively large public gathering wait line indoor place get needle stuck arm stranger sounds incredibly undesirable.

I honestly don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm going get flu shot year. that‚Äôs terrible. COVID/Influenza double team could nasty. risking high chance COVID infection get flu shot worth it? sciatica would recommend seeing massage therapist feldenkrais practitioner. cost less numb problem. still lot time left year. Even loses election, still plenty damage. I‚Äôm US haven‚Äôt seen anybody call Chinese virus literally 4 months, it‚Äôs kind obsolete discussion point mean want minimize damage NYC probably zero second wave. woods probability. surer sign apocalypse. Exactly. pathetic people wait government tell do. kid school I'd making plans 2020-2021 school year now. Connecticut would gladly take RI can‚Äôt even right. See article came today comparing economic outcomes Sweden (who lock down) Denmark (who aggressively locked down). 

Sweden‚Äôs economy outperformed Denmark.  hard gauge true impact pandemics everyday person privacy laws restrict access cameras overcrowded wards overflowing morgues, die home; humans visual creatures. see it, care. 3,000 dead 9/11 tragedy, 120,000+ dead Americans less half year kind taken stride: people *saw* towers collapse, heard crying screaming New Yorkers, witnessed people jumping buildings.

But pandemic, really *see* unless hospital worker something along lines. see people dying collapsing symptoms streets... Even Southern California's reopening incredibly minimal compared entire Midwest. 

Midwest numbers---still declining, maybe flattening (too early tell).


Literally EVERY Midwestern State seen postivity rate hospitalizations decline lot. WI, IN, IA, MI, OH, IL, KY, MN went down. 

Difference? Midwestern States built certain level immunity. CA sitting home masks orders major population areas MONTHS. start reopen---cases jump.

IN opened early May (in dining, bars, malls, etc). Active infections dropped 66% 4 weeks re-opening.

WI Supreme Court threw Governor's restrictions. Deaths plummeted. 

MO went gang-busters remember Memorial Day Ozarks people partying? Hospitalizations 25% since them.

Every single State seeing increase (TX, AZ, CA, NC, AK) states low levels virus March-April. re-opened things went up. 

Midwest NE harder hit re-opening Midwest aggressive....their numbers went DOWN.

Don't say ""MASKS!"" least IN, WI, OH, MO, etc masks usage always rare gone near zero since mid-May.

Chicago maybe Detroit decent masks usage I've read.


Edit: expect votes. love people say ""SCIENCE!!"" point data showing narrative incorrect cry like go away. time best scientists documenting carnage real time.

Edit: make stance clear, everyone wearing them, protect person wearing them, protect around them. Unless something like n95. What's telling seems USA calling 'Chinese virus'.

Every time come across thread breaks dollars US healthcare (what healthcare??!!) drains poor buggers either don‚Äôt have/can‚Äôt afford insurance terrified get ambulance never mind putting big toe hospital door whilst bloody agony think god bless NHS. 

Wouldn‚Äôt wonderful third political party created (why not?) actually wanted help people America right reasons. Oh, yeah, kids little germ goblins. I'm A-Ok going virtual route.   'We know first said 60K deaths c'mon forecasting three times now. bad.' Yet want get insurance. makes sense. Insurance literally paying people's healthcare.  Yeah he's counting reported cases reason. 100% spot on. paid $189 month health insurance high deductible plan history health problems got terminated COBRA wanted nearly $400 month. fuck afford lost job? *Karen entered chat...* Nope. true.

Wait school don‚Äôt mind sharing? confirms I've said many times (and condemned for). actual number cases least order magnitude higher official count. takes mortality rate \~0.5%. reference, official CDC info 2017 flu season 21 million cases 61 thousand deaths.

So, right now, Covid basically flu vaccine. likely actual number cases climb even higher, compared confirmed case number, Ab tests performed. will, course, push % mortality even lower. surprise actual mortality rate 0.1-0.3%. anyone read article? isn‚Äôt even complete headline. virus bad must mislead people?? cold weather make worse?  immunity, vaccine can't provide immunity... Yes course, crush one tbsp bleach, heat, inject enjoy move Texas low taxes 

you leave Texas realize dying lower taxes theres people need /s there, maybe put /s. But, we're going need them. Oh been. Much love. sense they're small communities whose land connection across border? Yes, would say valid exceptions closure.

In sense tourism time? clue. here. know lot people moved Texas, I've heard cities growing everything, living Philly/the north east looks better ever. would never want go place leadership acted way Masks protect wearer! Wearing mask keeps viral person shedding around them. good.

And never use tag. I'd rather eat downvotes.  something disinfectant, injections lungs? look that? Exactly. Dudes big calves totally different story regard body composition. They're calves fat. packing lift heavy shit.  Trump like slow testing less cases.
Isn‚Äôt like want slow reproduction don‚Äôt overpopulate earth, slow pregnancy test?
bruh I‚Äôm dr scientist, feel like one could other? Plasma taken blood. Curious-how exactly could prevented. agree lot deaths could prevented-all needed stop putting covid cases incredibly vulnerable nursing home populations stop going right ventilators. tow actions alone would saved tens thousands lives. sad part hits point return, political leaders still won‚Äôt anything instead point finger blame elsewhere that‚Äôs going magically help situation. 

Everything laid front tools resources remedy right now, still consciously choose ignore it. makes difficult want help people one cares begin with. news ?! literal fuck?  News flash....people virus stupid, traveled home.  Oh, break, gettin busy spreading virus kids wanna bang. thought states already stopped elective surgeries two months, first time around. market

Gotta stop chief, Tesla paid marketing 

What solid product outperforms EV competitors. got via Elon's tyrannical methods- which, yes, shitty- hard employees, they've produced amazing results despite that. One thing saw website 23ish percent ICU COVID 77 ICU things. know nothing really ICU recovering surgery hospital soon? Houston starts getting control balance discharges things new COVID people may reach worst case scenario Oh bad. It‚Äôs actually really hard tell days. Apologies.

Might want use tag. means wait vaccine Agreed. Letting insurance company handle first right now. don‚Äôt take kindly fraud. would unwise hospital told people panic unless actively beds surge capacity. Stoking panic rarely helps. Highest ever far. someone Canada say ..... shit

Glad jumped dont messed bunch politicians screwing around weren‚Äôt listening. didn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúSimon Says‚Äù. /s Donnie said beaten covid..how be? like 3 months ago Dems wasted impeachment nothing guy gets it. handling Covid-19, slanderous pedophilia claims rescue diver, irresponsibly giving child utterly ridiculous name, he's definitely soured image brand me. cars seem pretty cool, that's pretty much ""good"" thing him, offset stupid shit. go fuck right off. live work hospital rural PA. truly scary thing many members group Nurses Doctors.... Weird Democratic states' motto several months ago. ""So said slow counting please"" Still amazes people thought second populous state would spared. Wagnerian, expect next months include giants turned talking dragons, twin sibling incest, short, angry metalsmiths denied possession products.

None which, frankly, would place 2020. One first markers civilized society healed broken bones. else would doctor's? yes do... that's eugenics highly protested against. Disabled people valuable members society. Yeah, always wanted attend there. bit expensive though. think donate blood due shortage there's loads requirements agree Baker lot things, think heart right place genuinely cares Commonwealth. I've impressed leadership especially compared rest country. Every interview presser released text transcript. It‚Äôs much clearer says much nothing way. got then/thans mixed up. wonder many hundred thousand Americans die corona start trying quarantine. Maybe people stop accepting situation 1mil? Guessing sarcasm exist whatever part planet from.

*Edit: Ohio. Basically Canada.* Yeah, live Lompoc, staff prison families shop here, use gym, go restaurants PEOPLE wearing masks here, like SB County sacrificed Lompoc people SB could go gym again. I'm angry Newsom never allowed county reopen count prison numbers. doomers saying ""things really bad 20 seconds,"" far everything seems fine. fucking embarrassing rest us can't imagine looked right view countries. I'd rather know, quite frankly. I'm Massachusetts currently trying open up.

I'm still trying quarantine much can. go always wear mask sanitize get back car. know people going restaurants can, think irresponsible it. 

I dont wish anyone surging states dies disease. pray God, people realize little government cares hold accountable. throat ear hurt little past days, think allergies. husband tested negative. Anyway, rare chronic blood cancer get blood drawn. tell hospital lab throat, think they'll turn away? red blood cells low, really need blood draw. Many colleagues fitness industry dont give fuck. Dont bother masks gym, want get back inside hit weights...get clients going again. Im hesitant reason...I think moral obligation reduce risk especially sensitive populations. ***shh. one tell him*** buttchugging plaquenil great way OD Probably going 'pause' testing please Trump.  nothing lockdown. could get jobs Walmart qualify Medicaid. forget reddit hates fat people. think everyone making excuses trying say ""fat healthy."" 

Every time say ""BMI sucks"" get downvoted people different body compositions. athletic people family high-ish BMI. body builders, muscular literally bigger bones swear God sister's wrist big women's watches. BMI lower I'm way less healthy strong, higher body fat percentage. think takes literally ICU beds. Texan lives Austin, I‚Äôm surprised motherfuckers. new here? Fucking 2 say that? 2. 100 2? burn right? Fuck cancel culture.  Ok, let's talk math then. virus known spread easily indoors. Indoors also idiots denial wear masks touch things. Consider Walmart supercenter see 10,000 customers day. large protest 10,000 people, they've temporary (not continuously open last 4 months like nearly every crowded store US), people touch other, they're outdoors, protests we've seen almost complete mask compliance. 

So let's math exposure. likely cause greater greater risk? Wal-Mart seen 10,000 people day coming indoors last 90 days, one-time protest 10,000 people? 

Now let's extrapolate offices, bars, restaurants, casinos, movie theaters, stores places remain open continue open day. HONESTLY think people city spreading virus protesting spreading virus going stores, restaurants, shopping? Shopping, touching things, many times without masks?

Lol, city Texas, I'm pretty sure one Target house 2-3 days people come ever protested city last 10 years. Working retail, would see people literally every day. They're going start prioritizing people demographics. So, think less chance, think old, whatever, they'll give spot someone else. Unfortunately it‚Äôs standard procedure. Can‚Äôt donate blood either.

Edit: people saying gay people donate blood, clearly states article they‚Äôve abstained sex 3 months donating. essentially, sexually active gay people donate. course you‚Äôd a... *medical doctor*. basically taking path US south. Gov Abbot idiot. gets tv tells Texans stay go out...yet revoking unemployment benefits anyone doesn‚Äôt job search couple weeks now. waived encourage staying home....and jobs hiring right essential services... exposure virus job can‚Äôt back virus. 

It makes sense. making decisions? end day, seems like attitude ‚Äúwell people gonna die anyway‚Äù. save economy can‚Äôt think long term. rate?

Civil war. Ya live amongst hillbillies even wear masks. seen three people total store mask. That's probably since March/April. universal Busch gardens already open week two, sure didn‚Äôt help numbers we‚Äôre seeing That's disgusting Ahh yes, lying intended two months ago, come lie American people intend now. media balls even bother giving criminals stage lie from. uh-no. thing would prove true death rate far far lower thought-like , know, 10 x lower. CDC saying numbers sprang last night deaths form numbers show two weeks-the CDC basing fact number people ALREADY antibodies showing testing. it, lived (probably didnt symptoms mild symptoms most) , didnt die -that means death rate even lower Costa Rica Uruguay really two Latin Countries tons issues rn. think Moreno could gotten Ecuador list, really fucked wasted great opportunity. saw way changed disability rights Ecuador, clear real visionary. source shitpost? called ‚Äúat employment‚Äù. company fire anything want long doesn‚Äôt pertain race, sex, religion, etc. hopes escape punishment resulting chaos.

Bankrupt nation let mafia feast corpse. Worked USSR. chin masks. Oh chin masks... almost .... plan smart 

what hack epidemiologist wanted remove pensions? logic one thinks cops soldiers cowards given wear body armors. fight rambo-style wonder point general population care. likely time way late. keep talk lot people quite said virus nothing reopen denier talking points. Calm smart. wearing mask isn't. sadly main political talking point rediculous reason. knew soon mentioned it. Hello, fellow Steelworker! It‚Äôs racist so. came recommendation sooner, could seen coming?  sanctuary enlightenment? might last neighborhood standing.

Just kidding rest us crash economy reckless disregard COVID drag us. I'm starting think open schools + winter + federal incompetence = 300,000 dead Americans vaccine comes early next year That‚Äôs key metric. tests = positive results necessarily problem. ratio positive results increasing, that‚Äôs problem trolled thread, feel better? Interesting. go frills, like 98% people wearing masks. Today staples probably around 80%? Every go indoors, masks.

Yes, GTA. Toronto downtown/midtown specifically. think hr leaders problem elon problem. 

Elon‚Äôs decisions far way involved. 

Not doesn‚Äôt suck. made claim. show us evidence. I'm deeply embarrassed associated you, I'm baffled world declared war us, biggest idiot bully block dedicated, religiously (ha!), unjustified hubris interloping. worry, live U.S. pay shitload taxes go bankrupt go hospital. happened Michigan?

I'm still worried also us others might spread to. Yep. Ft Worth Texas resident here. Essentially everyone ignored signs bc nothing initially bad now.... colonies wanted constitution written we've dealt ever since. he‚Äôs accepting available data face value anyone ounce logic knows either protests spread corona bitching moaning people going parks, beaches, hiking bunch bullshit afraid walk back on. Oops, dropped magnum condom monstwr dong Honestly fucking imbeciles like piss off. You‚Äôre fucking idiot. Texas Medical Center literally small CITY HOSPITALS. place fucking massive unreal you‚Äôre there. 

Can least wipe shit eyes pull head ass don‚Äôt read dumb fucking comments like yours? Interestingly enough, think places outside miserable time year, taking really hard virus. it‚Äôs hot humid outside, I‚Äôd prefer inside AC on. places, like Seattle, highs 70s, it‚Äôs pretty glorious outside right now. halfway point talking called inflection point calculus/mathematics. 

Thanks data. high school math teacher, virus real boon ‚Äúwhen ever going use this‚Äù question. care anyone knows lol Pause small p \*no chance\* schools reopening parts country fall (if entire country, we'll see happens NY opening up) peepee poopoo Open everything say...n shut matter say....We anything go back rate... like Stormy Daniels Michael Cohen. contact tracing?  actually WEARING masks?  in, them, wearing right way?  I'm saying many people protests mask on......but covering face openings Bart Trump Simpson: awww worst day life

Homer Fauci Simpson: worst day life *so far* I'm 100% you. Blows mind everything sub positive fake everything negative 100% accurate. Also, protest nothing ppl honestly believe truthful testing saying yes, went protest. Oh sorry didn‚Äôt even see comment  No, all. negligence EVERY expert told diberstely chose ignore it. Thst includes Federal State administrations many states, primarily fault lie Trump directly undermining even well meaning states. position President gives bully pulpit, he's used detriment every effort control situation. Worst Coronavirus Pandemic Day ... far. boy WH letting country burn ground blackest state nicest one. odd. gonna whole antisocial generation Terrifyingly good point.... noticed Target south Lamar like evening. We're going Zapp Brannigan doctrine Thats signal transition phase 3 reopening. said word ""overrun"" misleading may incite panic nessecary.

On terms, think lockdown unsustainable, thats another day discuss. People sub aren‚Äôt able think non-binary ways. Yep, quit help take care mom could consider going back anything worth going back to. screwed days third shift make quit fire them. lot good people jumped ship look back. Home Depot revisit plans move area think Lowes would real trouble. barely complete Menards is. Canada government locked started shoveling money us. lot people complained country shooting foot financially (I pretty surprised MUCH money gave everyone front questions asked). However, lockdowns provinces fairly effective, we‚Äôre opening rapid pace now.

America cited cost reason half-ass lockdown, looking like won‚Äôt worth anything they‚Äôll again.

After said done, I‚Äôd curious compare much percentage points COVID Relief respective countries‚Äô economies. Wow used go Ontario Mills constantly growing up. can't imagine ever cleaned well enough, space *huge*. I'm sorry hear stuck shitty situation, hope nothing else customers got deal start finally masking up?? Don‚Äôt underestimate Brazil India entered game. Things could start getting interesting. Especially trump realizes preform fucking miracle, curing problem, stopping testing banning positive results. Rip senior year, might well uni freshman Sometimes wonder I'm actually country that's considered ""Superpower"". way pandemic handled absolutely atrocious. kind thing made people take seriously New York New Orleans (where am). cities sharp decline cases due extreme measures city/state.

You right free speech also, sure, use speech hateful inconsiderate way absolute fuck head. right think want, wearing mask, distancing, absolute fuck head. article cited one study, others. Seattle thousands protesters treated, fewer 1% came back positive: http://komonews.com/news/local/fewer-than-1-of-seattle-protesters-test-positive-for-coronavirus

As others mentioned, lots cities protests, weeks ago, yet don‚Äôt see large spike many them. Data seem trending towards protests non-factor, thankfully.  antibody tests totally accurate though? article talks 90% accurancy also mentions 70% could false positives. honestly quite understand get 90% accurate 70% false positives whoever wrote article seems sure. guess understand it. 

But true, lot 20% tested positive could false positives. found ducey staffer Oh! know one! Lipstick pig right? Ontario? GTA I'd say closer 50%. Grocery stores sadly less that. insane many people wearing masks indoors.  possible. We‚Äôre together one us six feet under. f for?! Seriously, incompetence everyone team, except Dr. Fauci, mind numbing. Unless going come stage wearing masks tell everyone wear masks, don‚Äôt see point. Maybe sign government literally outlaw kind thing, it'll run rampant industries order continue profiting wealthy. people concerned increasing wealth dying result it. like cancer society, spreading rapidly, enemies Anecdotally, NY seem conscious mask use Honestly point im lauging ass dumb Americans are... think responding wrong person. everyone talking 130k Americans virus killed two months 320m killed yet /s Yeah...exactly improves lol. never said eliminates. seems disconnect disconnect people attack masks. never claimed 100%, claimed proven beneficial. 125,000 deaths 4 months *with* widespread lockdowns time business usual then?

That's appropriate response.  ""Coronavirus responses highlight humans hardwired dismiss facts don‚Äôt fit worldview""

Yes, human weaknesses exploited, given climate change denial much larger problem US (and Australia) elsewhere, partial explanation. downplaying seriousness COVID-19.

The American political media system uniquely dysfunctional individualize problem focussing psychology. ""Vaccination, resource depletion, climate COVID-19 life-and-death matters. successfully tackle them, must ignore science tells us science denial.""

To tackle must denial reasons science denial. powerful elites use media power spread misinformation, buy politicians make claims thus make part normal conversation. vicious cycle extreme inequality leading systemically corrupt political media system, turn fuels excessive inequality.  could like, bit quietly though?

No one's really got time that. change. deaths rise. takes time. Hospital ICUs TX already max capacity, beginning mimic NYC.....

Death rates remained level time being. Stop posting bullshit retallied deaths counted recent ones.. Exactly, many studies done China months ago already honestly can't believe countries ""discovering evidence"" example masks work limit spread.

It like can't believe we've gone exact shit, fuck China guess think college football would one biggest impact biggest tragedy taking China seriously till March keeping questioning methods, rather warned learning get staff? democracy fucking dumb sometimes hysteria. I‚Äôm trying shame anyone. would also leave every single self employed person small business owner entire USA insurance way buy insurance.

More day I‚Äôm convinced want slate wiped clean. April ones?

Because I've seen people blame June ones. really believe deaths went ~600 last week 2500 deaths one day? Pay attention what's going around you. Nigeria gone strike, demanding face masks pay reflects rising risk.

 question hell supposed needs medical care something suspected Covid infection? next weeks, probably see every state put restrictions boring Arizona residents entry. brought escape coming insanity Florida becoming apparent, time governor Ducey appeared least moderately sane. hell broken loose don‚Äôt know hell do. Lol 

I can‚Äôt argue one I'm saying horrible. think TMCs ICUs 72% filled non COVID19 patients? think could ppl put pain turned life threatening? NJs governor putting almost 2k deaths today confirmed test bs. Sticking 4,500 I'll COVID19 patients nursing homes bs. now. many lives think cost? clue treat virus beginning. now. many positive steps forward. ignoring them? wear mask, part. refuse stay echo chamber though soon see happening. cases 5% 1.5% number drops. Deaths stagnant month. Hospitals reporting patients less sick. I'm taking break sub comment. Whatever happen will. Got damn title image. say....  population AZ ~7.2 million. We're going see anywhere near 250,000 deaths unless something changes dramatically. Texan nurse. fucking hate ignorant citizens are. Unfortunately, ""muh rights"" crowd, risk life family's life taking care patients ICU. rest world obsessed us? We're #1... yay... People, would needed hear message, You, Representative sworn serve us, done job instead endlessly protecting big bumbling oaf serving personal interests. really hope USA get serious conflict Presidential Bullfrog helm. knew Presidenting would hard?   Liberals: \*fully owned\* Cheers smart ones like you. brainwashed ones holding back even thinking managing pandemic. hospital continued cut hours raises hold, destaff many people responsibilities workload increased compensation. fact we‚Äôre allowed overtime all.

They received 700 million don‚Äôt pay back plus billions they‚Äôll pay back later. many hospitals across country isn‚Äôt one hospital that‚Äôs quite bit money that‚Äôs going line big guys pockets.

Edit: I‚Äôd like add held elective surgeries month, probably less. don‚Äôt staff number surgeries now. study done severe symptoms psychiatric issues proved linked covid could undiagnosed cases. Remember Cuomo hospital ship disposal instead sent positive patients nursing homes killed 5000 people? I‚Äôm wearing mask, ask anything troll, too, then! bot! broll! Embrace doom, broll! live city officially canceled public events end 2020.

It's really weird seeing different response different parts country Hot damn. POS makes Richard Nixon look like hero patriot comparison. find one mink corona farm, kill all. doesn‚Äôt help good chunk citizens think it‚Äôs hoax. Fucking morons going get many people killed. There‚Äôs treatments over. virus won...all people needed stuff faces restraunts go shopping. stay home. Really, US even lock down, since still loads people visiting friends/family sorts stupid shit, asked locked they'd emphatically tell YES. Last one steel chair Imagine believing government prevent something inevitable. Maybe Senate vote anti tornados bill next, think anybody wants tornados. I'm conservative state. local grocery store typically maybe 25% people wearing mask. can't understand thinking significantly go law requiring regardless jacked freedom imagine get. 

Again, even think need law significantly boost numbers. Public figures wearing promoting importance masks own. \- person head sand/up ass It‚Äôs mind boggling ignorant touch reality are, least pretend be. closer 8 billion okay continuing research report that, too? Damn, jumped 30% americans 70% called collateral damage, gets worse longer mitigation period lasts. Even canceling elective surgeries cause deaths eventually. Nationwide voluntary organ donations completely stopped, fail save life eventually. heart attack stroke victims can't go hospital things start look bad.

It happens resources stretching thin, going hospital comes risk. Sure was, spring break helped spread virus US. rich banana republic think fly all. think could literally kill parents.

But that's choice. Hospitals losing fuck ton money lack appointments elective surgeries. ICU care doesn‚Äôt bring much money. capital. city. megacity/ economic zone called JJJ capital economic zone, combined population 130million.  good news? happens patients would beds COVID exist? No, burden proof puts responsibility one side other. medicine, don‚Äôt assume X true unless/until prove Y. undertake research come conclusion.

We can‚Äôt assume novel coronavirus causes long term health problems without proof, like can‚Äôt assume cause long term health problem without proof. CDC completely untrustworthy anymore far I'm concerned. bungled badly become another political wing government guarantee following Abbott's lead. TX governor like everything already open going continue get worse. yeah ok bud well done. hospital CEOs means probably investors. faceless investor gets sacrifice human life bottom line without repercussion. Texas NYC first second week April. Scary shit. 

New York better now, I‚Äôm still staying hell inside. locked harder pretty much anyone else, along massive amounts testing contact tracing. mean, comfortable n=5000 that's problem. sht. completely wrong. can't afford neither many landlords. 

The issue sticking landlords lot landlords end getting stiffed renters never pay back. longer pay money renter owes landlord. owe, likely stiff landlord payments. imagine, someone owes $1k they'll probably pay landlord back keep record clean. goes $10k say, fk landlords I'm keeping money.

You sure get money eventually. landlords may never paid. government step fix problem. went massive control spread new cases way fast believable Judging purely quick read abstract: people focused parts virus recognised T-cells (which essential part immune system; cells mostly live lymph nodes) ‚Äî contrast common approach studying parts recognised antibodies (which another essential part immune system consist free floating proteins stick viruses). 

A majority people T-cells already recognise SARS viruses, even unexposed particular virus. may explain majority people mild symptoms: T-cells fight infection without resorting antibodies. Since immunity testing measures antibodies, people may test negative despite effective T-cells previously fought infections. 

(I can‚Äôt remember else talked about‚Äî cannot see abstract start tapping this!) assume stores law enforcement actually enforce mask mandate. 

My governor announced mask mandate yesterday. 4 county sheriff's already said fine businesses anything it. Well apparently he's living American dream, who's blame? Back old familiar curve seems, hit testing maxims. Ah. ""Please continue die shovel corpse furnace stokes economy"" cool. I'm confident beat governor, also beat rabbit chicken. Trump chose reality TV star instead leader crucial beginnings pandemic. funeral home block Brooklyn [still refrigerated container heavily They're still working backlog funerals. 9-10 day while. funny people small business protesting open back responsibly labeled grandma killers.

BLM however, fits Democratic party agenda seen acceptable risk. people common sense coincidence cases spiking weeks protests. would good news? [Try see feel 3 hours much Elon sucks. Damn....Best new baby. Italy's death rate per capita still higher Sweden much higher USA though government can't make wear mask line get COVID-19? residents know they've signed yet? So, contact tracing combined limited lockdown? Seems similar countries doing. probably best way minimize impact economy. dust plume that's 20,000-30,000 feet altitude, hospital demand üòÇ Wtf? pandemic includes people getting sick dying covid. agree original commenter: days April far worse (and almost assuredly far cases seeing anyway) exactly way Germans 1946 responsible holocaust parents responsible deaths Vietnam. masks mandated LA County? There's tear beer listen stuff dollar bills underwear.  

You know like even money? reelected.  
The ballot box change takes place, like vote country, unless reelect shithead 12th time. Two people.  Fixing unemployment requires states extra work. Declining process evictions means less work states. Obviously they're going choose easier solution. Holy shit that‚Äôs depressing believe covid-related bills covered government... expect over-and-beyond treatment, like nobody's flying us free-loaders Switzerland hospitals full. tried throwing bootstraps it? Good thing God protect Christians, right?!? love babysitter sky! See China Korea Australia. pretty well normal except get occasional breakouts put effort containing. Track trace isolate seems enough hold R0 around 1 without much social distancing requirements. isn‚Äôt court law burden proof, it‚Äôs novel disease requires significant amount high quality, peer reviewed research.

Imagine much better would turned cops murder people oftenly cause citizens protest. Usually one hospital full, it‚Äôll go divert send patients others nearby room. (And they‚Äôre full too).

If you‚Äôre using surge capacity, spreading staff, equipment, &amp; supplies thin possible. means easily end icu rn 4th 5th 12-hr shift row, caring three four critical patients.

I walked ER without healthcard. hadn‚Äôt since kid idea ER specific worked. Brought debit + credit + ID asked needed prove.

Take fucking tax dollars. assume people gonna go sporting events point time take shit. He‚Äôs accelerated dumbassery 2020. Literally every wrong move could make, he‚Äôs somehow managed make even worse one. Absolutely abhorrent worst possible ‚Äúleader‚Äù could global pandemic crisis like this. Even ignore pray disappears, magic. Houston, got problem. exactly I've feeling this. honestly making reconsider rest life. easy crisis, we're failing disgustingly. happen worse catastrophe happens? dont deserve country anymore. 

I idea do. confirm like miracle Maybe received tweet... Like know Flint, but, well, nothing plans to. ^ this. List skills find occupations align with!!  People understand weddings matter, marriages do. Miltary bases, (this one least). go without mask outside can't enter building go work without wearing one. Many eager free though. hope stays way solution sort. get Abbott dude. wonder many working since COVID safety precautions. Many flight attendants took leave working. one it. could tell 10% country die still wear mask. coffin It‚Äôs incentive lead monetary gain. That‚Äôs makes leadership USA completely rotten. stop spreading 70% number around. statistical guess clear R value adjustments anything.

Fast forward 3 days ENTIRE family (5 us) sitting ER getting Tylenol 3 told anywhere severe bronchitis pneumonia. 

I learned lesson.

If ever lung infection trouble breathing understand miserable coronavirus infected people feel/felt.

Please mask go public, touch face, wash hands often! importantly #stayathome. sounds like NYC playing again.  EMT's busy E.R. docs/nurses bringing sick/dying dying themselves. sister lives houston. watched two large families walk Red Robin masks waited take parking lot. criminal.  Unfortunately not. 125 thousand dead divided 25 million Americans infected average Infection Fatality Rate 0.5%, study study country country demonstrating least 2.5 months: IFR around .5 .7%. ran fentanyl switch compounding dilaudid bags. Lucky frequent flyer sickle cell patient lot 500mg dilaudid vials. much work make. entire country corrupt NY, NJ, (IIRC) Conn. cited data, simply want get truth. know newer data correct older data incorrect vice versa?

Good. include employees behind small plexiglas? lady post office near home doesnt wear one even though zipcode currently one highest rates transmission county.  Everywhere science ignored really. Beiijing city capital? Oh goody! Another whistle blower! Adam Schiff you? Yeah! Unreal since set record new cases today! home, can't drop job without thinking that, I'm trying work somewhere else can't quit then.  one silver lining outdoor spread appears pretty weak, much virus present many southern states now, it‚Äôs still going major, major risk think much AC spreading virus people taking much viral load sharing air / space long periods time. virus airborne, caught microscopic droplets hang air get surfaces people touch spread around.

1 infected person wearing mask, washing hands, social distancing probably going spread disease. infected person goes bar, wear mask, drinks / converses people close several hours unloading untold amounts virus essentially closed environment. People would swapping gloves like they're surgeon mitigate anything place.

Also UVC lights get pretty expensive. way they'd work indoors they're shining barrier people. A/C system necessarily recycling + spreading virus, people getting heat inside together poses threat. Small business wave tomorrow (or maybe day after..) stocked start self-supporting venture things settle down.    
I invested pencils. thousands streetcorner picked begin enterprise. step up, actually something first place. What's fun doctors trained either. New Orleans least one neuro-otologist (not lot cochlear implants going on....) running ICU unit. plus side finished residency last 10 years completely date. think he's evil, incompetent fits. think EMT's ALSO strapped max time transporting patients 2+ hours away? think they'll pay life flight covid patients? think states want inflate numbers taking sick states? going happen. Period. order work, infected air needs pass system. what's causing spread. spread caused one jackass spewing virus air particles fall ground, blowing air pushes particles around much further. want safest option, shopper bring you.. suggest clean every item putting away.

The mask protects around protects you, even wear mask, may exposed someone wearing mask. Well, Opening happened well this. spike came right around 14 days protests tho must opening it!! Damn. kind sounds like here. Schools arent open yet, planning fall. Everything else open pretty much. Hardly anyone wears masks, social distance. area isnt bad states, matter time till is. They‚Äôre less testing previously finding cases. going bad.  I‚Äôd say Chauvin really messed people hate sleep paralysis find experience fascinating enjoyable. Northen VA compliance afaik. difficult seeing quite diverse area pulling together, states ostensibly part nation/culture working us. much mandatory/benevolent imprisonment quarantine, many idiot states want sentence us make sacrifices irrelevant. don‚Äôt understand you‚Äôre downvoted either? brought fair points. Also there‚Äôs whole people gathering tailgating thing. exactly wife extremely basic health insurance. It‚Äôs like $100/month us either us wreck something least won‚Äôt get hit crazy ass bill.

I really wish better healthcare system US. small dick energy great one  Dreamed raodtrip states young. Last years much.  United States think higher points means win. Acting like Mr. Bean rat race going im winning im winning numbers go One hopes.

Is possible Houston residents less likely close contact New Yorkers though? ""It completely normal us ICU capacities run 80s 90s,"" Methodist Hospital CEO Dr. Marc Boom said. ""That's hospitals operate.""

""my country's economy proudly.""

A flag ripples background. bald eagle screeches background, albeit laboriously suffered coronavirus. hospitals NY full. Orange County hospital messed up.  locked 1 death hand flu cases... guess given economy collapse then?

As epidemic grows starts raking big numbers cases deaths, people tourism theme parts stuff. even open.

So seems lead collapse Flodida's economy, irrespectedly do.

Tourism Turkey declined 99%. People want travel around middle pandemic. (That last procent went anyway must really big fans holiday Turkey though.)

So based that, decline 99% Florida well. guess also smaller declines enough collapse it. wife went order spices Orii unlimited spices purchase spice rack, self n95 masks. $180. I'm glad Covid too, hope continue feel much better. Viral pneumonia pretty nasty. Id like know dead working flights Florida shit hole people went spring break. Hope spuds McKenzie t-shirt Lauderdale worth causing someone else die Chad. probably referring COVID patient percentage, around 30% last checked 70% ICU beds occupied ailments per governor: closing back ""last option"" One thing U.K. didn‚Äôt manage, plenty deaths hospitals point reached problem capacity, it‚Äôs kinda scary Halle ing US.
Especially morons flocking beach last days, gonna end twilight zone long time (except Nz is) Yeah, ""crucified"" mean ""lots people say mean stuff twitter."" That's happened field hospitals went unused.

Then again, many southern states generally literally retarded. Would jobless this? would surprised get job given demand nurses. That's funny. someone list went opposite way; March &amp; April, agreed lockdowns &amp; precautions, could even say ""fear-mongering"" time, that's serious posts were. Now, he's lockdowns compares silly things like deaths obesity this. Dude sadly jumps trends easily influenced others (ironic considering he's bit social media influencer himself). one other? care. I'm part - I've working home, going grocery shopping week mask even though I'm incredibly low risk personally. still fucking want football fall possible safely. season played? /s wait open schools. Fuck off. Redcaps deserve representation. families going start getting sick. trump litterly rallies slowing testing like wtf trying make political anything actual fuck moron funny thing NYC we‚Äôre actually point semi ‚Äúnormal‚Äù due people taking seriously, outside it‚Äôs absolute mess. I‚Äôve even handful 10 people less hangs friends we‚Äôve perfectly fine specifically took extremely seriously. It‚Äôs stuff like post /r/Houston people known positive going intentionally anyway causing insane rapid spread; people truly give shit many currently rising areas fact there‚Äôs enforcement insanity. Wtf!? buy bottle drugstore like twenty two bucks! never understand met ominous weapons vicious dogs /s That's annoying enough own. Adding pandemic makes unconscionable imo. US federal incompetence yes, US also massive protests social distancing people wearing masks started 2 weeks ago. No, that‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying...

Level 1 - protesters. get infected, don‚Äôt know it. go home, infect family, go work, infect coworkers, creates level 2, much larger group people, protests. turn same. Visit friends, family, go bars, go work, name it. Level 2 infects much larger level 3.

1000 turns 3000 turns 9000++.

So it‚Äôs much protesters themselves, it‚Äôs couple levels transmission.... keeps growing. Levels 4 5+ becomes control spread. think it‚Äôs old HIPPA rules 90‚Äôs protect identity person might truthful questions. Thirty years ago people forth coming sexuality. 90‚Äôs bunch hemophiliac kids got aids tainted blood taken donors gay I‚Äôm sure rule response unfortunate accidents. So, still OK protest politic lean left, virus real again? Yeah. Right then. Wen bicycles.  becomes new norm. vaccine produced speaks even louder, it‚Äôs dangerous virus need avoid spreading getting. vaccine never comes distance learn live it. it‚Äôll kill us try decide it‚Äôs safe never be? 

Getting sick dying, getting someone love sick dying, afraid change, stupid irresponsible fair enough, I'm GTA neighbour go today: see single pedestrian mask on. literally person outside, *way many,* wearing mask.

I think got saved initial reaction efficient effective, immediately getting asses handed us now. we've fallen *way* track well, we'd original cases, we'd hurting it. is, love next spike bring us. Fake news.

Everyone knows stopped back Easter. confirm insanely difficult get test AZ. called hotline right 7 AM, waited 2.5 hours half someone tell callback tomorrow. fortunately waited line approximately 2 hours. nyt article said appointments gone 7:07. NEED nose job! It‚Äôs essential! like optimism 'probably.' told Trumpsters flu Thanks :) Elon fitting leader Team Rocket I‚Äôve found subreddit automod looks parent comments political discussion, helps. fuck 40,000 people protested shoulder-to-shoulder Zilker park.

Next week going wild. 10x people, according this, already rolled dice and...won? Or...didn‚Äôt lose yet?

The number people bandy IFR rates concerns incidence progressive pulmonary fibrosis etc etc like they‚Äôre suddenly experts needs stop. 

Already apparently demographic changes infection population news reporting actually lowering death rate. 

And isn‚Äôt great news, certainly change picture somewhat. Especially compared arm chair health experts wanting right END EVERYTHING. Except unlike killbots, corona virus number dead causes get stop. many people seem know this. :( think much polarization happening created stoked outside agencies. better way weaken foreign country divide people convince conspiracies sides. Mess minds everything totally fucked watch eat itself. math wrong. forgetting everyone pretty much agrees fact already, CDC also recently estimated, real number infections 10x greater seeing testing, none people even sick enough bother getting tested let alone end hospital die. wouldn‚Äôt see spike cases looked way filmed lab, crematorium, supported HK riots? thought trying cause panic, break cordon leave Wuhan. seemed agenda way worse that. Covid glad get invite Utterly heartbreaking. Indiana's numbers supposedly going down, interstate travel limited, chances we'll screwed soon. get lot looks wearing mask whenever I'm outside home, I'd rather weird dead. politically alienated over-exposed majority held hostage mean spirited self serving minority. reality nutshell. Can't get cases testing. Cant see light. basically says India given looking herd immunity. 

Issue herd immunity poorly understood many unanswered questions. article brings many issues relating herd immunity -  daily death number actually way lower. Scam fear mongering seems likely reopening, could myriad factors. Minnesota origin protests late May haven‚Äôt spiked, NY.  Takes two weeks kick in. wish, marginal. flip side, bet people grow frustrated family regret life decisions. consumerist machine continue eat. Retail therapy part medication masses. Probably bar $800. billed ‚Äúsurgery‚Äù I‚Äôve arguing insurance apparently that‚Äôs documented as. Zero coverage line item despite ‚Äúpretty good‚Äù coverage. doc ‚Äúout program‚Äù like chose doctor jamming things nose. lol, thinking thing. Every day record breaking day sort.

I‚Äôm numb now. I‚Äôm loss do. can‚Äôt even talk people health safety without going full defensive. Oh that‚Äôs great, entire country afford live places like New Canaan we‚Äôd set! matter keep multi million dollar yachts far enough apart other. know this...or what's already happening? testing recovered athletes? I'm curious mom received check month died Covid. sister, paid mom's cremation, still waiting hers. try testing fewer people? Finland? saw meme! said perfectly. Trump cut funding mobile test sites... exactly help testing capacity there? mall two weeks ago (I helping someone set kiosk there) traffic felt like typical non-summer weekend traffic. Stores limits could in, 25% people wearing masks. Yeah governor idea wtf he‚Äôs doing. Careful now. economy shut much longer worry virus killing us. Food shortages kill far more. Wait people broke virus nothing bedsore. Thankfully live liberal suburb Chicago still requiring masks indoors, we're Wisconsin right summer home going store mask I've gotten many looks. happy hear agree that. West Virginian ""We going studying ya'll follow fu***ng guidelines."" mayor &amp; county judge tried. governor completely overruled open up. Leaders pulling stops protect sworn protect, right?
No not! thing protecting cushy job position 
Presidential Toad. sad! many people going die result money grabbing focus
these swamp figures portray. Again, Sad. dental surgery go twice emergencies lockdown. surgery, waiting room spaced everyone 6 feet apart. also took temperatures went office. Masks required too. little worried guy bone graphs/implants extremely competent. entire staff extremely careful. setting numbers many rural folks getting sent cities hospitals die there. 0 media presence australia.

I never seen fosters ad beer life. Never, panicking leads irrational decisions. Staying calm best way approach situation. lol *1200 LA hadn‚Äôt shut 3 months would now. honestly gotta find way close borders, save north east south struggles come terms use face masks situation California really upsetting, nailed early. Melbourne Aus, dispiriting. IMF pro U.S. institution? Pretty sad USA favouring economy lot lives. Stop pumping markets start distancing! OMG; knew cases climbing, death numbers caught surprise. DC? expect it. wondering number tripling. Earlier tonight like ~750, consistent recent days. guess one way make clear regarding cancer patients comment. cancer patient rate doubled (or triple whatever growth is) every two days? even 3% sure there's going another 30 cancer patients coming tomorrow people tested positive cancer reached 3000 tomorrow double 7 days, triple another 7? say Covid.
One thing, yesterday's thread hospital capacity Texas, projected 100% capacity happen 12 days. day. nurse Dallas Reddit yesterday day saying COVID ICU limit let someone die get ventilator.

You're blowing it, Texas. Sort shit out. percentage population New York got it? localized herd immunity thing? guess question is, would state wide restrictions travel work towards this? thinking dire alternative, seeing people can't stay put, wear masks, etc. second wave giving new meaning 'the south rise again' ""how 1 year old get Covid"" seriously? people know either already kids back daycare never stopped sending daycare first place. People work. attitude around anyone locked bunker deserves Covid getting gross.

This devastatingly sad hurts heart.  talking 20-40yr old age range, think mom dad bringing home them. Oh get it... Trump gets Mexico pay wall! shows difference, necessity breeds life wisdom, choice come cost, ignorance. covid latter lethal. chicken shit call shot. 

He needs push responsibility onto constituents because, ""hE StRoNgLy ~~toLd~~ RecOmmeNds StAy HoMe!""

Fucking spineless amoebic anal discharge. seems backwards work state, pay majority taxes federal government, state plead federal government money actually need it.

Federal government decided paying tests. states going scrambling fill financial void, Donald Trump thinks covid test reporting going keep getting elected?

Fuck that. Taxes go state, let federal government negotiate budget governors. COVID. $9.00 pill. Let‚Äôs hope place work doesn‚Äôt start price gouging anymore hospitals already daily bases. Summer started 5 days ago one near left Bank America tho? it‚Äôs 107 days, 125k Americans died, well 2 million Americans infected. second wave starting. Care revise opinion? Easier people, expense others. That's inequitable..

I'm big fan policies treat people same. know several people collapsed refused pacemaker surgery ""elective"" surge. get sniffles corona. Thank u posting this. stuff people need see order stop panicking. Speculative  Statistics, work?

At time, better testing means capturing milder cases went un-confirmed before. cases, less deaths, also spread (judging percentage tests coming back positive) significantly younger pool victims, situation different Wuhan/Italy/Spain/NYC, clear deaths/hospitalization situation evolve here. 

There progress treatment, especially anti-coagulates anti-inflammation management, probably contributing less deaths hospitals: Dr. Birx totally breezed fact Positive results way FL testing plummeting.  reality, event seed, actual cascade result spike, takes little infections multiply. *hundreds thousands

They publicly announced reopen Florida shit together, would reopen. start letting investors pummel shit governor. 

This goes industry Florida, pain investors pockets leadership would choice listen, are. Last knew average incubation period 6 days. 9k tested positive yesterday already passed along 18k people. Limiting things prevent following double/triple, ship already sailed next week. 2 weeks could easily see 40k new infections FL alone  suppose get well 15 days.

The median time takes 'recover' Covid-19 three four weeks. Many cases last eight weeks. Helps keep dirt bugs outta grille, too! BTW, least use face masks here. We‚Äôve road before.

Lot's stupid things legal. still stupid. ""Hold beer watch shit."" STFH.   Lol well.  pointed new research shows face masks reduce spread infection.

**No RTC studies ever found protective benefit face masks stopping viral respiratory infections.**

Here examples:

[Jacobs, J. L. et (2009) health-care workers (HCW) significantly likely experience headaches. Face mask use HCW demonstrated provide benefit terms cold symptoms getting colds.‚Äù*

[Cowling, B. et (2010) studies reviewed showed benefit wearing mask, either HCW community members households (H).‚Äù*

[bin-Reza et meta analysis 17 eligible studies. ‚Ä¶ None studies established conclusive relationship mask ‚ÅÑ respirator use protection influenza infection.‚Äù*

[Smith, J.D. et (2016) undertook meta analysis available studies face masks. identified 6 clinical studies ‚Ä¶ meta-analysis clinical studies, found significant difference N95 respirators surgical masks associated risk (a) laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, (b) influenza-like illness, (c) reported work-place absenteeism.‚Äù*

[Radonovich, L.J. et (2019) undertook study healthcare workers assess relative effectiveness face masks 2862 randomized participants, 2371 completed study accounted 5180 HCW-seasons. ‚Ä¶ Among outpatient health care personnel, N95 respirators vs medical masks worn participants trial resulted significant difference incidence laboratory-confirmed influenza.‚Äù*

[Long, Y. et al. six randomised clinical trials (RCT‚Äôs) face masks ascertain protected either wearer others around viral respiratory illness. total six RCTs involving 9171 participants included. statistically significant differences preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza, laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections, laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection influenza-like illness using N95 respirators surgical masks‚Ä¶.The 4 use N95 respirators compared surgical masks associated lower risk laboratory-confirmed influenza.‚Äù*

Face masks work well surgeons want avoid dribbling sneezing patients, useless comes stopping viral infections. terms preventing spread COVID 19 evidence achieve anything all.

If hope protect viral respiratory infection, covering face face mask useful concrete lifebuoy.

There RCT studies anywhere analysis show protective benefit face masks stopping viral respiratory infections. ***This aren‚Äôt any.***

***The issue wearing masks political debate, one based science.***

In addition this, several studies found significant problems wearing masks. vary headaches, increased airway resistance, carbon dioxide accumulation, hypoxia, way serious life-threatening complications.

No one telling frail elderly lung diseases, COPD, emphysema pulmonary fibrosis, dangers wearing facial mask *of kind*‚Äîwhich cause severe worsening lung function. also includes lung cancer patients people lung surgery, especially partial resection even removal whole lung.

In one study, researchers examined blood oxygen levels 53 surgeons using oximeter. measured blood oxygenation surgery well end surgeries. researchers found mask reduced blood oxygen levels significantly. longer duration wearing mask, greater fall blood oxygen levels.

*Bader et al. Preliminary report surgical mask induced deoxygenation major surgery. Neurocirugia 2008;19:12-126.*

The importance findings drop oxygen levels (hypoxia) associated impairment immunity. 

This sets stage contracting *any infection*, **including COVID-19** making consequences infection much graver. essence, mask may well put increased risk infections so, much worse outcome.

There another danger wearing masks daily basis, especially worn several hours. person infected respiratory virus, expel virus breath. wearing mask, especially N95 mask tightly fitting mask, constantly rebreathing viruses, raising concentration virus lungs nasal passages.

We know people worst reactions coronavirus highest concentrations virus early on. evidence suggests cases virus enter brain.

In instances enters brain way olfactory nerves (smell nerves), connect directly area brain dealing recent memory memory consolidation. wearing mask, exhaled viruses able escape concentrate nasal passages, enter olfactory nerves travel brain.

*Perlman et al. Spread neurotropic murine coronavirus CNS via trigeminal olfactory nerves. Virology 1989;170:556-560.* Huh. mean like... Wearing masks practicing social distancing? kind efforts prevent deaths? Like... Taking proper precautions sanitation work? ""State media"". public service media knob, controlled government funded tax money allowed take sides politically. guess impartiality fria tider clear minded rationality samnytt... question. 

The virus actually going anywhere. environment now. like wait months disappears. open 6 months, there's going surge numbers. be. I'm sure people think waiting do. Can't stay closed forever. Testing NY still limited compared Florida now; said, there's ten-day track record 5-day doubling times. tremendous, best ever Congratulations them. Big dick energy applies gay dudes too. Actually ESPECIALLY lol  nothing utmost respect scientists get completely unexplained results publish work.

The real issue is, samples 3 / 2019. 

So, presumably enough samples 10,000 labs run check ?

Sorry, work depends sample sources cannot replicated, (like unique fossils remnants extinct species), OK, even case, ensure sample runs destructive. 

So, credibility really depends split samples labs run. course zero chance selectively target minorities poor, letting wealthy middle class whites slide. referring T-bots knew would second wave, now.

As aside, outlaw /s tags let people figure things themselves, get feelings hurt. big difference I'm sure people getting gatherings: 
being masked outdoors unmasked outdoors masked indoors unmasked indoors 

And put percentages would something like:

.01%, .1%, 1%, 10%

All investigations point coming unmasked indoor gatherings people.  First glib joke.... new meaning term safe sex 

On serious note. pointed article, people eat. US legal safe places, happens. understand concern pushing underground making risky involved. 

Now back lame jokes, gives new meaning term window shopping it‚Äôs going change overnight, cases high next week. needed act week ago. Ill honest, Im depressed hell living US. Basically one wearing mask live. Things getting worse worse. f%cked

Went post office today first time work one wearing mask. even employees. technically federally employed workers. 

Ive working whole pandemic Im essential worker never anyone much say thank you. wouldve made unemployment. 

Im *this* close giving up. Fml Well hope area Florida manages well aren‚Äôt inundated dying patients. Best luck nurses. Compared US maybe, objectively, exactly exemplary. Leadership struggled months mask issue, lying efficacy enough. Yes that's actual games biggest risk, since sustained close contact heavy breathing masks. However, theory, players COVID-free games begin, fact Florida make difference since players allowed outside. practice, one players probably sneak bubble get infected.  Nope people live heart disease awhile. magically drop 2 weeks.

I think smoke eat unhealthy advocating it. 

I also think acting correctly right thing do. we're advocating following guidelines. want examples left leaning leaders totally disregarded knowledge virus spreads came mobs street personally supported? Lol sure trying prove Houston, problem. quick easy way feed small business corporations. California list too. can‚Äôt argue people. don‚Äôt believe early stage rises, see big numbers late prevent them, stand slackjawed saying ‚Äúbut changed???‚Äù. Lol. rare us benefiting right now. wearing masks becomes political, virus spread becomes political. Damn, company even considering opening vaccine announced, probably go back vaccine starts get mass produced. looking like I'll WFH easily rest year, probably next summer. phrase commonly ‚Äúwhat point‚Äù think I‚Äôm going start using ‚Äúwhere point‚Äù instead seems add certain level exasperation:) 

My box checking weird I‚Äôm Mexican, means check White(or black, native, Asian) I‚Äôm Hispanic/Latino. It‚Äôs confusing don‚Äôt like it. claim Minnesotan nationality done ?? think anyone ever accused corporations caring whether live die  Yeah, impression antibody tests included anywhere numbers. response taken month ago. Newsom tweeting time remind people wear masks yet one listening. Another major issue public health officials OKed mass protests really willing talk impact protests case count. sends mixed messaging/shows hypocrites telling people stop socialising ok ignore rules long good reason Yeah virus weird. follow Coronavirus page Quora, actual epidemiologists immunologists (giving benefit doubt. know could lying.) see reports like ‚Äú8.5% may never developed antibodies begin with‚Äù shit like that. think immunity might wear quickly would need boosters every 4 months, I‚Äôm pretty sure practical global scale. It‚Äôs scary. they‚Äôre taking possibility practically immunity seriously. common cold coronaviruses infect us multiple times year, vaccine cycles ideally smaller immunity duration. viruses, sharing caring.

Karen, maybe Yes, go short jog without mask need hold breathe whole time. Take slow deep breathe walk door, careful hyperventilate. People protesting told say were, used BLM. Yep, sure who's hoarding still difficult find. Maybe next year better. I'm banned guess Yep, 100%. I've roles output mattered. People even generally agreed people perform good better working remotely. 

If stepped last hours day Friday get personal shit done would get text boss directly calling suddenly needing talk person kind work. transparent childish.

Ultimately exited job via system giving barely enough shit never get fired, eventually position ""eliminated"" (aka laid off) -- collecting salary multiple bonuses year working 25 hours week taking every Friday go ride motorcycles. immediately picked much better job paying more. 

I encourage everyone else position same. Extract absolute maximum value company mistreats you. Squeeze everything can. give fuck you, certainly give fuck them. Yep, 14% died already. Guess president swamps idea working. /s clear ""recommending"" face coverings middling success. Especially many make political issue health issue. happen eventually. Agreed. Trump cause this, symptom overall sickness country.  also understand bar thing. favorite dive normally enjoy visiting times year God pandemic, wait. Trump scores high numbers again! Winning! God love living stanky, quirky, incredible city. Let's keep going, DAILY DOUBLE! *it's matter perspective*  called challenge trial hard legal perspective. Animal studies looking good immunity right now, never disease like confer immunity, worst case vaccine would need regular boosters maintain effectiveness. Sorry, thinking non special needs distance pretty easily, outdoors helps. Indoor lines like supermarket waiting bar drink much harder. literally trump worshipers too. Fucking cult 45 going say spikes cases rally attendance, though correlated, likely causative. likely people came places already taking precautions bought trumps rhetoric attendance happened cause. grabbing data from? New cases vs daily hospitalizations? reading bubonic plague. article talked small pockets Europe managed avoid 70 - 90% population killed. Milan particular. One way kept people quarantined, nail doors windows shut infected houses. Whole families sick healthy shut house. crazy extreme. Lol sucks. everything right didnt sin money tight spot time now. 

Looks like johns spent last saving. website complete utter cesspool. Someone dares disagree you, u/DISREPUTABLE? Claim they're shadowy figure that's paid trying push narrative account younger completely arbitrary cut completely ignore reasons someone might new account explain baseless conspiracy theory. way, attack person's comment's substance. Character assassination need, cares actually addressing argument that's made. 

Protests middle pandemic silly. truly believe that. main reason resurgence almost definitely reopenings. known quite time risk transmission much lower outdoors, especially masks worn. Loosening indoor restrictions mask requirements main reason. wrong misleading, corrected you. it. point. spooky conspiracy theory trying spin me.

I'm going website good now. Bye. planned go beach next week, cancelled real fast. right. sure would downvote that. 

Or maybe think exponential unsustainable pop growth good thing That's crazy. Mine (a huge entertainment company) told us WFH next year minimum likely 18-24 months. assume 18-24 months remote work probably WFH permanently willing accept promotability falls cliff. 

I fearful would pull shit late summer nope. neighbor invited apt next door gathering sorts .. said thanks thanks . plus girls probably look like swamp donkeys anyway (i'll pretend least) get portable table. That's really good idea, even over. Fuck coasters Jenna, brought table! Yea white house 20 year olds spreading virus asymptomatic carriers places worship

That place super spreading. rural Texas love churches.

I'd expect spread continue churches closed. I'm boat. Worked home successfully 2 months. second boss got 'OK' government back office. get work wearing mask 8 hours, instead safely house. way across California band. Seems latitudinal attitudinal, look geography. Yes, protests reasons hospital Wearing pants used easy. months quarantine, preference toga made bed sheet. way fall bed unravel myself. 

See Ted Talk helpful pandemic tips. Deff spring breakers, protests mean, really SARS-CoV-2, causes COronaVIrus Disease 20**19**. 

So I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs heard CoV-1 it‚Äôs like 18 coronavirus diseases one. I‚Äôd imagine couple severe enough get names. China beat virus quickly know works. people like Gates truly serious stopping spread they'd advocate course action instead suggesting test more. proves capacity test more, chose rational reason test fewer people able to, actually want people tested, reason want tested would found infected, were.

FoHM need tests track spread virus, since test, trace, isolate already failed way beyond Swedens means keep working. Early TTI actually Swedens strategy! Lab capacity back February March much lower May June levels. early March lab capacity analyze 20000 tests per week. early April 40000 tests per week.

The desire test came government (and mainly, opposition leader) wanted regions take responsibility testing. Regions want take responsibility testing since FoHM need it. (And see Jacc3 post pays.) took unreasonably long resolve (imho) conflict resolved testing increased substantially. V√§stra G√∂taland surprisingly quick even, leading lot confusion spread rapidly increasing region (even posted here!) people regions thinking level testing would already available them.

But back claims... FoHM need increased testing track spread society following really make allowed government simultaneously claim rate infection slowed, ""herd immunity"" far away reality, spread stopped, even wanted people infected. rational excuse decisions made regarding testing, masks, non-medical interventions.

1. can't remember ever seeing claim spread stopped. FoHM claim this?
2. Every case, even cases, need found evaluate whether spread slowing picking up. Sweden manages track flu season every year tests.
3. swift ""herd immunity"" claims track back Tom Britton. Tom Britton speak FoHM (or government). Neither Giesecke matter even he'd like claim bill more, something refused.
4. anything Swedish government saying much all! Instead media taken daily press briefings mixed together comments experts paint confusing picture what's actually going on. government pointing FoHM.
5. turns virus spread quickly expected numbers Wuhan Italy.

It's hard keep Swedes! can't imagine hard must foreigner can't double check people actually saying gets twisted clickbait machine. lag someone becoming symptomatic sadly passing, usually around 2-3 weeks, keep watching numbers, feeling going start ramping soon also.... Nope, possible. offer American Individualism solutions global pandemic country. Heavy breathing close contact, masks. Trainers hotel employees wear masks come close contact long periods time. Plus daily testing lag risk false negatives, still risk, strictly better daily testing  app people using? wrong people downvoting part problem going left empty feeling get every episode. still recovered Respiratory therapists manage ventilators. Recent studies shown correlation obesity hospitalization rates/death. 

It‚Äôs point I‚Äôm even sure obesity information comes from. obese percentage dead/hospitalized always obese percentage population data dumps. we‚Äôre seeing actual studies showing correlation. 

It‚Äôs almost like media-made narrative like back March simultaneously reported young people hospital, find later patient information young people extreme outliers. 

I idea what‚Äôs going on. now, I‚Äôd advice ignore anything except science. Think looks ways crossing street? Note woman lead-in photo. Wearing mask chin bra count. 

I'll believe pictures people getting tickets. No, USA leader testing 10x rest world even 1x. fact USA world per-capita testing. boggles mind get facts twitter assume they're right time. one even wants send kids school September live NJ. started reopening places reopen next week possibly end July. hate wearing masks really? ""flu"" know people got sick last March still get weird effects..... biggest problem water parks lines becaue water, there's really anyone wearing masks even lines.

You could probably lines part safely people actually listen follow rules. provided reliable numbers. scientific findings affected cooking numbers, thing they're lying sums. Cooking numbers different censoring/fabricating scientific findings.  seriously trying push line whole global pandemic contrivance simply vanish account US election?

Because so, perhaps consider professional attention?  100% agree. point full lockdown simply reasonable. wish isn‚Äôt country.

That's primary concern current push mandatory mask usage pointing flawed studies effective virus.

Good. I‚Äôve saying *months* now. Hopefully finally official Swedish report says it, dishonest propaganda using [‚Äòfailure elder care‚Äô scapegoat]( Sweden‚Äôs much higher death toll compared Nordic countries finally put rest. is, always clear anyone critical thinking comparative analysis that: ** ‚Äúthe crucial difference total number infected deceased Sweden‚Äù**. Everyone caught without mask sent hospital bill covid patient.

They obviously dont care consequences actions, problem paying bill. right hahaha  whats excuse people bash day long controls horizontal vertical. refuse wear mask themselves? 

Everyone wearing mask heavily populated public area confined space people outside households.. need n95/n99 can't source one. Even Scarf bandana better nothing. help reduce spread great deal. 

 blame everything Trumps actions. followers dumb modicum sanity. Many wear masks. take serious think. take says pinch salt. people take serious Radical Left Media. People need get it. man arbiter reality. responsibilities, local office responsibilities, state electorate responsibilities. responsibility make wear mask wipe bum bum. acting like idiot regards masks. make partisan thing many Liberals refusing take seriously. Even peak all. Mardi Gras anyone? proverbial poo fan blamed Trump cancelling Mardi Gras. beyond idiotic. 

Personal, City State accountability came first.

Trump's leadership mess shockingly poor. get go. told states. decide they're doing. delegate power. actually USA supposed work. expect POTUS answers. Listen scientists medical experts. Stop blaming everything one man. ain't correct ain't helping anything. he? completely separate comment. responded post. RemindMe! 1 week #Translation:

The elderly Sweden suffered worse elderly Nordic countries relation country's total number infected dead. Sweden's Municipalities Regions, SKR, writes new report elder care managed corona pandemic.

At time, SKR notes sharp increase number deaths among elderly compared previous year, writes ‚Äúlimitations Social Services Act‚Äù mean elderly care must give priority urgent needs: ‚ÄúCleaning elderly person priority care elderly person. sick, ‚Äùthe report states.

Elder care also allowed move elderly people special wards without consent - makes difficult residents need separate infected people healthy ones, writes SKR. think widespread US well. Parents keep children school avoid family infected safety children. think anyone choice seriously consider keeping children home. think statistics come from? come information generated people.

What think contact tracing is? think data reports come from? say ventilators mean intubations and/or oxygen like last line b/c maybe means I'll able go baseball game summer like many times year. really want true result can't deny timing massive spikes around country. agree masks extremely important could probably masks mandated stadiums. general population fucking stupid though. That‚Äôs usually case whenever there‚Äôs odd single-day spike anywhere - got backlog tests dumped data once. 7-day rolling averages better tracking measures cos cut lot day day statistical noise. point lockdown stop virus. make sure hospitals didnt become overwhelmed. fine right now.  Okay, can‚Äôt assume everyone incorrect numbers nullifies argument? inject fabric softener beforehand fine. skimp, get good stuff. mean though? Like anywhere property? Walking dog? Going jog? public places like starbucks grocery store? No, nuts you. hard. Kwanzaa now. Central New York open 6 weeks outdoor activities abound almost zero change case counts \~5 day attributable community spread county (450,000+). outside, even without masks seems pretty safe even big crowds limited mask wearing. Anecdotal course, good example New Hampshire-esque area TBH think would handled better margin maybe 10-15%. riots would still happened. protests (Both sets) Would still happened. People would still want get back work asap welfare system US mess people need work. sure Obama would given public stimulous payments would locked international travel quickly think would left travel US China US EU effect longer diplomatic. believe would composed message. speeches would written experts would simply taken position talking head. come wing like Trump does. 

That said. think people would wanted get back work much same. Employers would demanding people get back work much would caved pressure backers. We're talking genius answers. We're talking man presidency party picked bank affordable care act written insurance companies. many issues keeping public control Trump did. Remember Wallstreet Ferguson?

I believe would message ""Everyone wear mask!"" tho. genuinely believe would repeating every day point. suspect would talk making mandatory 1 get bill passed 2 want anger voters. think point public covid lockdown exhaustion would led images we're seeing news right now. People refusing told good them. urge people stop making political make personal accountability!

But everything i've said Obama would opinion. change anything. access knowledge. access facts. fact far likely catch spread country wear masks. rocket science. would look bad group scheduled convention end August Jacksonville orders masks.

Instead seems like states getting hit worst states started reopening aggressively never really shut down. Yes! Karma train coming!!! happen many states. Reopening went quickly without real plan. States needed testing capabilities control virus lifting restrictions.

Yes underwear needed guys won't..have tracking death totals .for ever reason people dying covid near rates nyc  Yeah, don‚Äôt really get either. Personally, I‚Äôm going continue wipe food packaging case. Worst case, I‚Äôm extra minutes takes Yo, ever claim racist? would say yes three. opened early (this debatable depending region), would fine people taken proper steps towards reopening (think masks, actual occupancy requirements, social distancing, easing restrictions slowly etc), combine reopening people thinking phased reopening=fully reopen get large gatherings close quarters inside offices demanding employees return work regional super spreader event making. made even worse big orange causing division among party lines recipe disaster. look originally planned US lot countries never stopping virus spreading trying eliminate it. containment overwhelming healthcare system could prepare next wave. Months later first wave never actually went away marginally better prepared take care it. would guess Italy US hoping phased open correctly time. probably second wave point successfully bought time necessary prepare first wave handle successful reopening. TL;DR Americans go hard soon saw stoplight change colors went full speed ahead. [There can't second wave first one never take 2. Plus, let Bill Gates give vaccine piss hillbillies. ask run PPE something? That's still problem states.

There's perfect solution truly doubt leaving middle seat empty really makes plane safer. ""Here white people wear masks side them, PoCs wear masks to. Seems perfectly logical me.""

You skewed sense logic. black white people supposed equal, one afforded allowance protecting virus middle pandemic ""perfectly logical"", exactly? Many inner city communities, lower general immunity less access affordable healthcare, well population concentration, together significant population danger demographics according risk factors concerning virus, danger infected. anything, means masks important, less.

Science racist. logic is. least one us knows we're stupid default. :P realized yet, probably live bubble supports world view. feel sorry you. :) can‚Äôt imagine Veruca Salt would tolerated mask, either. Start hospitalization rate. characteristic virus. death rate cannot higher that. puts theoretical upper bound 1-2% death rate.   Depending they're from, may quarantine get back home.

Ah, cloth masks mainly protect others potentially infective droplets (versus wearer), purpose, would perhaps effective? I‚Äôll try find interview. ""magnetizes"" water droplets outside mask, attract outside mask, pick viral load *inside* mask, release air? 

I'm following infected person breathing wet mask significantly viral load exiting mask before. 

Also, provide source. beach town, hill live fancy houses, city put electric sign saying ‚Äú$2000 fine fireworks‚Äù 


But wearing face mask? Priceless 2020 Winter runway - COVID coats #isurvived hope one hospital reads gets ideas. Jfc. That's nightmare.

We COVID-19 floor COVID elevator screening area.

Or had.

It good plan.  feeling. I'm actually taking statistics speak. bewilders never come across single poll entire life. Thank response though. going mob rule protests (and are) righteous therefore exempt bad description consequence sucks empath 2020 it? saying it‚Äôs fine people die isn‚Äôt risky something like HIV? kids dumb, get live grandma, grandma gets dies. Kid will, level, know infected grandma. adult capability understanding types emotions would still fuck gave grandma virus killed her, even situation control. can't imagine kid thinking killed grandma. Time someone learn code Keep saying going rain eventually far future eventually rains, always say, ""See, told would rain!""

That kind prediction pretty meaningless though. Go ahead America, hopefully least someone realise they're wrong what? Even King Japan

Japan emperor, king. real numbers also inaccurate hard say much anything

What ‚Äúinaccurate numbers‚Äù referring to? knows many really infected China January/February. many really infected India, Pakistan, Bangladesh today.

Ah understand you‚Äôre saying actual numbers infected people much greater limiting factor amount tests manufacture. Agreed 100%, pandemic actually way worse numbers show. 

Thanks agreeing me, guess. Adjust numbers many already dying pre-existing conditions, caught virus died instead. increased death, certainly hysteria mass impoverishment people trying milk it. it‚Äôs especially scary ‚Äì cases rising like New York, everything shut people took really really seriously. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶not happening states (who don‚Äôt New York‚Äôs infrastructure, medical personnel, budget) current pace 1% people US officially have/had coronavirus.  weren‚Äôt party. Could used support asked extra cleaning (daily) bathrooms work. Management didn‚Äôt want pay cleaned every day open, essential workers onsite using bathrooms 5 days week. yelled pointing failing clean area daily, minimum, wasn‚Äôt compliance guidelines, several levels executives. say reanimated eating brains? Nothing. Checkmate. NBA players Jabari Parker Malcolm Brogden got Covid19 attending BLM protests. Three months ago werent testing thousands people cold like symptoms day wife anything go by, maybe not. antibody test last week came back negative. need full lockdown. aware what‚Äôs happened places hospital beds? absolute disregard front line workers human life general astounding. I‚Äôm laid off. Wtf? think working thirteen hours straight, breaks, proper PPE okay? even fucking close true. I‚Äôd say maybe 30% average. Nearly 0 southern states Finally.  data plain wrong, say Illinois 88 contact tracers local community colleges offered online training full classes county health departments advertising hire. Illinois laid plan month ago hire thousands. He's coward coward. like orange boy  completely disagree. 

I think US would vastly better off. Remember US composed pandemic playbook pandemic response team learned Swine Flu? dismantled Trump. 

Remember co-operation international bodies? destabilized torn apart Trump. 

Remember focus science public health? torn apart Trump. 

The response would different. Far better. would wide co-operation states Fed government, messaging based science, public display leadership. response would started January. Lil late Wow never heard guy. Gonna check videos later. Wait classes over.. going money time anyway indoor bar restaurant dangerous.

Outdoor bars restaurants bit safer.

Take picnics lowest risk get days. Well, hindsight 20/20 (no pun intended).
I'm expert either I'm trying blame you, think always easier outsiders think knew better along. make difficult decision waiting intubate someone already struggling breathe, tempting jump intuitive conclusions. data often misleading proper testing takes time (for example, ventilator number China could case reverse survivorship bias). Hydroxycloroquin great example happens skip scientific process go feels right. far remember, determined promising candidate experts, promise blown waaaay proportion political reasons. Lil late Sucks even idiots like sitting comfort corner spewing nonsense become pet peeve mine wear glasses face mask together.

Luckily, mom sews masks made nose bridge. That's totally true - months ago (March) symptoms hard time breathing partner experienced breathing heart symptoms. Neither us even allowed see doctor get tested, let alone admitted hospital. called doctor line multiple times given official diagnoses ""probable covid-19."" one particularly bad night partner told ""usually symptoms we'd tell go ER immediately, might covid can't tell that. Stay home unless things become desperate enough literally cannot breathe all."" (We hard time breathing enough speak complete sentences neither us could walk stairs without multiple breaks). get delay. Everything emergency March April. numbers bad worse! End reopening nonsense!  can‚Äôt find Lysol wipes anywhere. Sounds like fun Disney world itself. precautions they‚Äôre taking safest place state Florida. 

I still think it‚Äôs crazy go Disney right now. it‚Äôs unsafe experience extremely limited it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre discounting prices. Phil yelling? might skewed results, people wear masks. Yes kids dying lot. guess what? Kids die bunch things. Take me- 8 month old ICU 6 days RSV. highest oxygen one point, intubation discussed. Luckily turned corner positively later night. RSV adults produces mildest cold. children? Either kill even symptoms. 2 years daughter it, 2 month old son caught it. fever (still big deal infants anywhere near severity ICU stint daughter had). 
My point: never hear anyone talk RSV change lives dramatically flu. flu dangerous children! 
I totally saying COVID isn‚Äôt worse flu- much deadlier- depends age group. Yes kids got Kawasaki- account still shows low incident negative outcomes children. - like 99% children (I find stat- study) age 9 won‚Äôt die something like 98% don‚Äôt require hospitalization. yes COVID kill kids chances super low. parent live risks time. I‚Äôm concerned husband kids. Well, darling, *a lot* studies published recently support argument wearing face masks, Randomised Control Test studies anywhere analysis - many - show protective benefit face masks stopping viral respiratory infections. 

So little pickle - pretty clear many governments intent pushing issue through, clear cut why. Maybe cautious many studies done show *harmful effects* caused wearing them, worry. 

As someone likes show concern people's well - bless - thought might interest you. look, isn't, read it. left MO last week, don‚Äôt think saw single person wearing mask. Plenty people smoking cigarettes inside packed bars though think type person you‚Äôve whole life determines you‚Äôll later age. plenty ‚Äúyounger‚Äù politicians ignorant, good older politicians pushing positive change. 

That said, regards pandemic, could old fire response still basic straightforward. You‚Äôre situation base that‚Äôs willfully ignorant facts reality representatives qualms placating ignorants. Oh courteous, think overzealous above. Iirc, said ‚Äúnot guy anything, wear mask like nose could still contaminate food you‚Äôre making us, care two elderly grandparents, one finished second round radiation.‚Äù look face sheer surprise dismay priceless, moment wasn‚Äôt worth idiotic thought process got there. know 6 people it. One (who flew Seattle LA May) gave parents, died week ago age 57. Two others early NYC recovered fully. One friends (healthy, 30s) hospital three plus weeks struggling hard sever lung scarring likely deal lifelong complications. Trump said look ban giving medical advice? seemingly doesn‚Äôt think people basic math. keep trying fudge numbers eventually can‚Äôt hide bodies. June 24th people per capita died Covid CA FL.

One masks mostly closed one open. I'm wondering preacher. would explain things. Food supply chain scary... even want talk it.

 Massive outbreaks chilled meat plants.. no.. evidence survive chilled plastic food wrap?

 call bullshit. Means I‚Äôll get sooner, loss. Hey China bot guess virus doesn‚Äôt care you‚Äôre Texas. could seen coming.

Stay safe, Texans. Pretty sure you‚Äôre Karen here. You‚Äôre freaking another person makes Karen. don‚Äôt give shit people do.  Hmm. Funny, missed Mississippi governor ordered statewide mask wearing.

Oh right. hasn't.

So I'd say Mississippi government officials also blame this. Probably sort exponential calculation aim please üòÅ ^^^although ^^^I ^^^usually ^^^miss Cough Splash Mountain somehow politicized pandemic, lose-lose situation governors. WA, certain people loudly calling Inslee resign issuing original stay home order, renewed new mandatory mask order. Damned do, damned don't. One way other, good portion population going pissed. reminds seen Newsroom bring climatologist discuss global warming report, newscaster says something like, ""What report mean?"" ""It means we're screwed. Everything already over, given what's already table. technology actually reverse impact Methane Co2, etc. save us now.. ..or killing population humans, replanting earth trees on.""

Link here: must states article says Florida Yeah, neither party put forward strongest candidates time. could compare number elections, follow politics... well seen (and we'll see too) Yep, brother prime example. least think virus hoax, straight give shit it. anything sanitize, he'll wear mask store requires it, time. fucking infuriating I've tried change mind, response always ""I really care"". Gotta keep big corporations happy screw little guy (local bar restaurant owners) Latin America try pretend they're leader free world? I‚Äôm going Florida week can‚Äôt wait  Yeah exactly Trump hate people can't stop think like five minutes whether shit believe really makes sense. stuff saying something takes hours dedicated thought PhD figure out. ""is way idea might correct"", giving five minutes. 5G thing, play devil's advocate first heard it, asked ""wait, really quick analysis countries hit hardest Corona compare 5G rolled see there's correlation? (there course). even was, come clear geographical spread virus."" Like really bad China first, started spreading Asian countries started locking shit down, spread Europe started locking shit down, spread United States um uh, well guess we'll see plays out. We've streets since end May. practically July Massachusetts first new cases per day state. much longer wait uptick admit argument bullshit. Nearly 4 weeks now... problem India keyboard warriors seem know better actually getting shit done. Increase testing 5 times? even know cost behind that?

If easy test get control USA doing? How's Russia doing? cases bound spread, prepare keep mortality rate low that's what's happening India. Shame. that's point, county bad outbreaks, make news dont, devastating corner country mean, definitely far expert, best case scenario likely? better get numbers then

you got USA, USA, USA‚Ä¶..

Full disclosure: European, stay safe... live, pay? Hah. Well main problem roads. don‚Äôt ring roads, single north/south highway passes center town, gets jammed day result. They‚Äôve talking fix decade now, sensible public rail options got voted population like 2008, since it‚Äôs one insane idea another. Nothing ever get done.  where‚Äôs data implicates south It‚Äôs hard feel like can‚Äôt actively contribute. However, definitely contribute sharing high quality information everyone accurately informed, wear mask, best protect family based recent reputable guidance. even know Trump votes terms way US system works. 'outright' number relevant due way districts etc divided

either way, already understand point. majority americans good bellwether sensible behaviour do. take news others publish sized. much nuance. feel bad Floridians don‚Äôt feel bad Florida all. governor racist Trump crony blames Hispanic people virus instead reopening plans. don‚Äôt care happens economy all. built construct faith general public. ‚ÄúThe one guy gives us is‚Äù. Turns he‚Äôs another politicking scheming liar. never one lick faith anyone else trump administration fauci went right ahead betrayed that. Yah feel? Fox News must German branch told lies. 99% media reported Trump proven factual. know seems hard believe times, really bad President. sad truth imagine actually probably much worse know. Go tell someone else plague rat. Stop bothering self centered bullshit. going post every day now...

 also took Machine translation proof read 5 minutes fix errors... want victim pretending people care lol Northern California, specifically Santa Clara County. Florida probably don‚Äôt lot hope DeSantis. That's awesome, that's takes. bullshit wearing masks somehow political, like lazy self centered willing wear mask out? Yea, president made virus political. happened. Except whole Governor thing. Kind hard ignore that... Yeah medical professionals don‚Äôt give fuck drug Trump decided stock Yes, least second wave.

It third. convince mask $500 fine Jesus. time. disease who‚Äôs spread stopped almost entirely wearing face masks, point remaining closed screwing economy again? least area crippled yet dam close. Closing keeping things closed longer would crippled them. 

We bent curve CA original plan stop virus.

We going stop it. Yes let‚Äôs help economy helps poor. great idea.  Exactly. leaders society masks on, would question. lot people would laughing ones wearing them. ""fuck we're full"" tests confirmed cases stop panicking, real cases much much more, virus circulating long lockdowns r0 5 firstly noticed infected way 35 million(flu cases America per year) America fatality way lower think. guess currently infected least 500 million world wide. least half us smart enough want live hahaha noticed comment removed, interesting. Simple question, someone gets car accident dies due injuries sustained car accident, autopsy performed COVID found system, count COVID death? point doctors hospitals pressured add COVID causes death due increase funding. created wildly inaccurate death counts due COVID. smell new ‚Äú13%‚Äù meme incoming shit America with

With 4% population... one would drive V√§sterbotten Denmark. flights. point flying VB super complicated anyways, flight routes closed. least masks mandatory, passengers spaced   opened first place human coronavirus, no, target chosen present SARS-CoV-2 anything else that's plausibly found human body. possible something that's expected human body would contain target. like shouting ""Look out!"" truck already run over. exactly point.

I simply made observation phrase wrong, easily understand meant.  

What funny two nutjobs lost shit arguing death wrong phrase correct guess meant.  guess people nothing try nitpick away forever forever forever, someone else made simple observation. want make joke virus would disappear April year gets warmer virus can't survive spread summer I'm honestly tired stupid shit people putting I'll abscond one once. Javits started taking COVID patients couple weeks Right, think basically kiss late July return goodbye point. 9000 new cases Probably another part foreign funded disinformation campaign. certainly help people using cards, adds destabilizing US. good progress made NY tri-state area too. Way pick slack everybody. RemindMe! 170 days Try looking legal definition legal terrorism luck. 16 players caught virus staying home. anything they'd safer inside bubble. lost immunity. reason Midwestern states going immunity. Hey significantly less people...of course OH going go down. Trump chairing meeting followers warning signs there.

We literally watched play 6 7 places exactly like 3 months ago. literally know exactly virus works spreads still tried pretend like happen them. WH Task Force briefing nothing gaslighting bullshit. Constant back-patting Americans continue die cases freaking skyrocketing again. It‚Äôs possible early strain less contagious deadly. I've navy 14 years. Haha... yeah. Actually yes. years ago might said ""those pussies"" too. definitely one. used think like that, dont keep shit warm, cough doesnt stop cant sleep. Funny things change.. rookie Covid deaths per population NY/NJ/MA 8-10x states. number concerning cases, deaths.

The excess mortality line numbers. We'll see states get close number coming weeks hit new peaks. think UV filters might somewhat solution needs looked into. Fuck off, go watch ballet. I'm even ""football"" fan american still disagree you. enforced? Doubt Denmark better without them, half social distancing guidelines did, re-opened sooner, plus deaths per capita Florida, first part pandemic, state population density, longest time. definitely overestimated good general population. narrative always masks protect YOU, do, degree 80%+ mask compliance protects entire community. selfish people focused protecting themselves, 80% may happened own. again, worried stressed protecting yourself, everyone would run grab n95/n99s, leaving healthcare workers even hole. New Jersey posted addition Nice chatting you. mental hospital deprogramming

Could Facebooks new slogan. ""may"" fucking generous. People asthma trouble them, I'm sure that's they're referring here. cancel baseball... problem guys don‚Äôt understand midst global pandemic, several weeks long time. takes time spread y‚Äôall weren‚Äôt seeing spread fast enough said fuck it, must serious. reminder vector this.

Our best theory originated China proven. Sure. Texas hospital CEOs said yesterday isnt problem. staff day day, week week, month month.

Dont kill me. said. ex data scientist posits they‚Äôre cooking books make look like big spike recovery going Fourth July. positive reporting withheld, iirc, benefit DeSantis narrative. problem US systems place get long running social welfare place. partisan bullshit, took long get single $1200 payment folks. 

People want go back work cant rely government suddenly pull head collective asses long enough push bureaucratic process would help people time. Pair entire party ""well, got mine"", common citizens can't wait. choose risk homelessness infection. mailman touch today though Unfortunately true. 0.8 0.9 reached full lockdown. UK reached 0.8 2 months strict lockdown 1 month softer lockdown. 0.3 unrealistic point Relax there, take tin foil hat may cancel RNC convention. Yes, works elected officials start pandering ignorance, weakness system. I'm proposing replacement, works fairly well time immune corruption least makes sluggish. 

I think part solution lies improving education system focus critical thinking rational debate. beliefs one thing, people need rationalize objectively understand flaws may exist reasoning (nearly every viewpoint tradeoffs), learning say three magic words ""I know."" We've got much dogma knee jerking going country I'm tired it. Something wrong florida... looking loophole willing thing benefits everybody? Omg. Wtf... masks?!   People gonna lose it. took roughly month initial lockdown people stormed statehouse Michigan rifles. third people country trust Trump opinions taking cues far serious is. poor investment public education last decades bite us ass. solution though government assistance, re-opening businesses. don‚Äôt hear Germany France Canada brink mass evictions they‚Äôve foresight provide steady income replacements year instead 3 month bandaid. Americans deep brainwashing though believe people deserve prioritized businesses. I‚Äôve wearing gloves volition used certified food safety still cross-contamination mindset. Spreading surfaces doesn‚Äôt seem primary vector we‚Äôve seen people handle asked much, unfortunately. 

Whether you‚Äôre purpose, tone comes deliberately obtuse combative, wanted know. number way low False think like 5 families Florida right top head. live west TN. people going bring virus back city like crazy Yeah, knew trying say NBA's season canceled future. NBA's Orlando bubble plan seem bad idea. Even Dr. Anthony Fauci supports NBA's restart plan. get everybody bubble everybody tested negatively twice COVID-19, impose 14 day quarantines anybody entering leaving coming back bubble case family emergency something like that. Daily COVID-19 testing everybody good too. workers Disney would also full PPE gear surfaces stuff like would routinely cleaned. knows everything turn lol cancel months ago. attempt salvage season playing one location fans. entire college classes one year ‚Äúall lives matter‚Äù crowd today? here‚Äôs another example don‚Äôt. it, thank actual pre-print paper: says multiple wastewater samples tested back 2018-JAN, one set samples taken 2019-MAR tested positive SARS-CoV-2 genomes. 

With knowledge easily virus transmitted, positive result one set samples unexpected best. might go far say improbable. Without reviewed entire paper, I'd guess likely kind testing error anomaly.

I'd say hold judgement paper peer-reviewed. There‚Äôs someone Twitter posts extremely detailed threads this. Pretty Look far aspergers friend god tier IQ coupled social ineptitude leaves basically disabled.

That's me! Minus god tier IQ part. cook place outside houston, day went 25% cap whatever percent, seating full capacity. fucking joke bad resturant handled going wear mask gloves sure, want expel droplets onto cards. Oh no, realistic understanding society works called ""first world"" nations. give example underlying condition someone would aware having? ""Bars included Phase 2 governor‚Äôs reopening plan, also allowed movie theaters, bowling alleys, tattoo parlors businesses reopen.""

So movie theaters indoor dining still ok? long till get dragged kicking screaming halt well? agree hospitalizations/capacity important stats. daily % positive still gives good idea relative spread compare prior days.

The thing based random sample would could infer % positive rate representative % positive rate entire population. that‚Äôs we‚Äôre trying here. want use easy come stat gives idea relative spread compared prior days controlling amount tests done specific day

And would actually expect %s lower testing becomes accessible, higher go winco. Hope enforce masks Wednesday like 25% :( would define ‚Äúaction‚Äù? I‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôs indifference malice. yeah. see deplorable outcomes do. Frgaile like snowflakes Ok doctor going coronavirus patient? yes, nurses travel places pick need. I‚Äôm sorry. part sadly it‚Äôs team effort. Stay safe. Wow must like super cool popular.  even known point? know anti reddit propaganda believe protests played part it... took months officially knew face-masks worked idk earth cannot blame protests without evidence. seems odd 3 weeks protests seeing massive increase... state started opening around beginning May starting see rise almost 2 months later. (edit, nevermind see said sarcastic... put /s end) thinking sounded pretty good. guess might little used Trump Biden. Er gawd yer right! Link? So, esteemed educated colleague, push gloves least gloves would also protect us? ""We stuck band misfit toys.""  


That's awfully generous. seems accurate description US 'leadership' right would 'pile burning garbage'. parents? Nah, rented he's actually going go summer home bit next month. Interesting rates crazy though! right probably many renting case. Makes sense Germans even usual want holiday Denmark year. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* great social/economic experiment opening closing reopening closing. Chuckle.. Florida +9000 cases day finished yet. daily case records staggering.

No way open Disney mid-July planned. Absolutely way. realistic though. Young children children special needs may tolerate masks. parent preschooler refuses wear entering NJ public school system, hope teachers plan incorporate ‚Äúputting masks‚Äù curriculum. *is* safer wear one maybe kids willing follow teacher‚Äôs directions opposed parents. read got Satan deemed get it. wanted quiet work. slow building church. That‚Äôs about.

I started watching *The Handmaid's Tale*. embarrassing United States going route. says 5% need hospitalized numbers pair quite well. Say 80% asymptomatic, 15% symptoms recover home, 5% hospitalized (just using random easy numbers). 

I see would conflict worries! :) Incorrect. Excess mortality exploded. Check charts country country death rates normal skyrocketing fact disease unnoticeable year killing people tested nearly enough problem shut economy logically. clearly wasn‚Äôt case) sneezing mask WHOLE point ... side Atlantic, really feels like Trump Bolsonaro designed make Boris Johnson look better comparison... Thanks. Yeah, must quite common, given happened 48 year old international traveler. 20 - 1 = 19, like COVID-19. Coincidence!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? Yes ""when going use this"" sentiment toxic. use math constantly get kind skilled engineering, scientific, technical job. Like use get highest paid demand jobs. sad kids (and even adults) understand this. Shh gotta quiet library. ask people test positive- found correlation protest attendance infection Covid. definitely tough time people compulsive behaviors. Stay safe. That's tip iceberg. extreme situation pandemic, many people would otherwise hospitalized staying home. Normally, viral penumonia breathing difficulties, would observation least couple days hospital. number serious cases actually waaay higher number hospitalizations. Hahaha, hilarious.

It's obviously much subtle. need tell leftist hack. strategy make minorities believe victim make white people believe opressors, way stop vote left.

Thing probably lot *worse* Sweden month ago. 

Now actually start mass testing see evidence massive spread going on, see ¬´tail¬ª top.

(My guess deaths/ICU cases continue improve, see relapse fall though. think Sweden‚Äôs curve like back camel. First top highest though, big ¬´body¬ª beneath extra tops)  Exactly point, think sarcasm lost sometime text. leader paying rush things I‚Äôd confident. go ER lungs bad shape oxygen levels start dropping. physical symptoms drop, many smart phones measure blood oxygen (google phone model).

Videos crying Karen's coming. Exactly , taught stop drop roll, go corner shelter place , taught need wear masks. Sure, even taking account:

How?

We supposedly 50% asymptomatic rate, start with.

I find hard imagine situation entire population people region, living open-air environment, gets infected exactly time. Generation time 4 5 days, he's describing 46 separate villages. Symptoms drop couple weeks non-severe cases, nearly everybody currently showing symptoms many thousands people become infected 1-2 generations consecutive superspreading events.

Wondering number Texas cases today. :( Something tells enough tests that, ever enough tests. 20-40% people dieing every week tens thousands deaths dieing preexisting conditions last year, year that, Obama presidency, even W, Clinton, Reagan.


At least people home entombed ice cream truck ice skating rink room morgue.


And Fake, China's fault, lied, Trump shut travel certain countries.

Trump also sent everyone Fake Flu check. Trump allows Faucci, medical advisors, White House CDC tell us wear masks.

Trump should.grow set fire Faucci, medical advisors, whole CDC, go national TV state would rather dead unemployed.

Sure businesses may fail, never stopped Trump. Can't wait start reading people online think beginning closet thing zombie apocalypse....

You believe amount insane tinfoil hat people online think leading point we'll fend shoot friends family supplies survive hellscape united states... hundreds thousands people protesting rioting close proximity weeks end would lead subsequent rise cases?
 
Pretty much anyone following virus spreads. Hello friend! ICU nurse Phoenix. Used work post anesthesia care unit past year called back work ICUs severely understaffed. halting lot surgeries create capacity surge COVID cases receiving. running room patients opening new units order make room more. problem COVID patients end ventilators stay weeks. can't get fast enough order accept more. get filled quickly. get point people often aspire make sandwiches subway work hotel front desk saying ""man, can't wait serve people"" Exponential growth like someone popping firecracker, one second turns gunshot. next second turns IED, next half second turns cluster bomb, next quarter second turning nuke. next tenth second turns multiple nuclear detonations. Sad true. damage done. Even accepted pay, airlines would severe trouble. I'm contact tracing... ü§î 

And claims use skewed logic. you. üëç We're balding due 

You're think one generation us finish school online, sorry wording properly. don‚Äôt know like Cali, first didn‚Äôt even say school canceled, updated every week instead cancelling whole year  Damn shithead kill people try feel good surrounding adoring fans. 

Now *know* cult. Mississippi recorded first 1,000+ new cases day. director health asked testing? 

He said people need stop making argument. testing level month ago. continued, positive cases people walking clinics hospitals symptoms. absolutely sure? mine certainly has. OH Utilization rate 10% higher deal dumb things around office like water cooler talk meetings listen background continuing work. feel American sports, baseball might good. outfield literally socially distanced batter, catcher, ump closest. course there‚Äôs also area players waiting bat together, I‚Äôm sure could something that.

Other sports seemed screwed likely lead lot cases people contagious testing positive. Hockey people trying get puck plus benches everyone‚Äôs squeezed together. Basketball got people lot places trying get open constant 1v1s ball man-to-man defense going on. Football likely corona‚Äôs favorite sport people field sidelines close together. Every play ends people dog pile. players, would assume kicker punters probably get least amount cases. linemen fucked.

Makes wonder sports good not. make sure got refresher sports US [from would assumptions them:

-	Baseball: Social distancing, sport (at least outfield)
-	Basketball/Hockey: high intensity, teams making plays around hoop net sometimes ends lot people together trying get ball puck (i.e. board play sometimes hockey rarely leads fights something goes wrong)
-	Football: Possibly Corona‚Äôs favorite sport. Linemen fucked cases arise sport
-	Soccer: kind socially distant get set pieces corners
-	Tennis: Seems pretty safe, especially take crowd out
-	Golf: Rich man‚Äôs social distancing sport. crowd would probably ones likely get rather players
-	Wrestling, boxing, UFC, etc: Would assume would lead cases, I‚Äôm sure reason tested much recent event UFC
-	Field lacrosse: Guess would like outdoor hockey game via lacrosse stick (haven‚Äôt watched forever)
-	Volleyball: could kind social distance it
-	NASCAR/racing: assume it‚Äôs ok minus big wrecks sometimes, guess take account pit crews
-	Track Field: Unless Usain Bolt, would probably lead cases sprinting close other. course, though, basically umbrella sports usually see summer Olympics, one Discus throw
-	Swimming: assume would lead cases via water share people close races

I could definitely wrong some, that‚Äôs see sports here. Besides playing sport, there‚Äôs always time teams grouped locker rooms, training together, sometimes general public. course sideline handled somewhat similar sports group players playing congregated one spot.

And goes even deeper refs, coaches, numerous staff, security (maybe needed crowds aren‚Äôt allowed), arena staff fix field needs fixings (Zambonis hockey).

Through this, I‚Äôm sure simply comes aggressive testing crowds. wouldn‚Äôt know else do. See get deleted mods. always like woke boy. majority americans voted trump

Yesterday 649 deaths. take nursing home patients data? still 4x less? same? worse? know odd argument trying get going. acting pissy it.

Yes, number infected people many times reported. Especially, areas limited testing. initial numbers China probably extremely unreliable, cannot used comparison. Testing South Asia (per capita) moment limited, presumable real number infection much higher, making numbers also dubious comparison. vistor? thing March worst outbreak largely contained New York City area. states outbreaks crisis-level affecting New York City.

Now we're seeing crisis levels California, Texas, Florida, confirmed 5000 cases yesterday, Arizona far behind sure keep surging refuse take strong precautions hosted Trump rally.

Alabama, South Carolina, Mississippi confirmed 1000 cases yesterday. Mississippi especially small poor state.

The question hospital-straining superclusters spread across entire US people collectively take seriously? know. lost jobs Dude late really good news. happened March latest. let's never forget actually loosened restrictions back then. important bit

Yes, lot mild cases truly mild, even asymptomatic, huge risk take. many people underlying health issues even aware of, still much know yet disease, especially regarding long term effects. wish co-workers would listen. I'm sorry around them. (or loved one) gets infected, think anything change minds. Sorry long rant- know one needs lecture. feel frustrated many others situation.

Guess came back positive day meeting? ventilated couple days later? idiot spread 3 6 staff members, incredibly lucky 3 staff high risk group.

Boss quit late may board directors decided leave staff unemployment rather reopen. ""Resigned protest"" thought daily gathering 20-40 high risk patients would fine half staff immune.

Seriously, logic? Fuck gram gram, think CEO bonuses? correct deadly viruses like Ebola SARS1, true SARS2. SARS2 quite deadly enough asymptomatic transmission selection pressure become less deadly. people got SARS1 Ebola quickly incapacitated therefore able spread well. hand, SARS2 spread effectively people develop symptoms. 

SARS2 basically worst nightmare viruses. curiosity, know whether microwaving mask contain metal would sanitize it? case vote greater evil? it‚Äôs much better boisterous obnoxious bars Zoom... /s forget slogan ""To serve protect"" ""judge, jury executionier?""  said ""America deserved 9/11 bush no, ""proof"" Harvard University Deaths lagging indicator seen uptick (or least stop downward) trend now. right case increase started 10 days ago cases steady 2 weeks deaths continued drop.

The likely reason deaths following curve cases much higher percentage recent cases younger population much lower death rate. think still pretty low risk, even though increase cases. numbers hard read lot people. state large, much testing hard say whether trend bad concerning.

The positive rate staying pretty low. good, bad. dropping tests isn't.

Seriously. headline ""44% Americans believe country re-opening quickly."" fucking embarrassing. see lot ""20 somethings"" anti-lockdown protests, looked like bunch boomers. matters California never enforce it‚Äôs politically correct.  Misdemeanor = offense

Felony = crime

Misdemeanor =/= crime Unless make money sports, giving shit sports right stupid. wasn‚Äôt asked clearly isn‚Äôt representative shut down. NBA/NHL/MLB/NFL.

I say die hard nfl/nhl fan. NYC tbh  There's significant racial disparity Florida:

[Florida coronavirus rates twice high black, Hispanic areas, internal state data County's population 18% black 69% Yeah, I'm curious too. Hospitals like empty beds they're gonna 80-90% occupancy rate much possible. plenty routine surgeries may end patients spending time ICU temporarily recover (think heart surgery). However, numbers surgeries lot last year, wonder Covid percentage is. 

I really want two numbers: Overall ICU full percentage Covid ICU percentage (what % whole covid suspected covid) I‚Äôm guessing steady access PPE entire time? I‚Äôve shocked many wealthy hospitals NYC lacked enough PPE go around. Go fins! reason half country didn‚Äôt ‚Äúbuy in‚Äù tried federal lockdown state-by-state. Coronavirus *not* community numbers significance, locked month. 

Now people saying ‚Äúfuck that, locked month reason‚Äù public trust gone. can‚Äôt blame non-compliant people - look noncompliant.

They lost jobs, homes, businesses reason. Less one thousand cases area entire duration lockdown. hadn‚Äôt even gotten yet, truly. Then, lockdown ends, everyone totally cool thousands people streets yelling spewing droplets everywhere.

You either care covid BLM. I‚Äôve chosen BLM choice. media/governments tried it‚Äôs shown people don‚Äôt give flying fuck health. Covid restrictions important long politically convenient demographic harmed ‚Äúundesirable‚Äù. Three weeks shutdown? important enough obvious shills astroturfers try change country origin, important enough let them. seen evidence reinfection possible, every study far pointed level immunity catch it, even truly asymptomatic sickest getting strongest immunity. course. Female Body Inspector. study done 2009 flu pandemic, well current politicizing remember back Florida got caught fudging numbers yet Redditors still insisted good example successful reopening. people gotten quiet lately. businesses? can‚Äôt give money every business keep afloat Take mental health break news least week. isn‚Äôt making point thinks he‚Äôs making. people directly know anybody Covid-19 right tiny fraction population got it. still 100,000 Americans dead climbing. know somebody it, would even horrific need safe like being. Lol bullet 3, ""difficulties contact tracing""......no shit Co√±o Ok great glad county safe en entire generation America‚Äôs young people working essential industries dying off. need start throwing rocks police, setting things fire. becomes political protest, completely acceptable. matter - idea, care do. asymptomatic carrier. even possible? Could mean coronavirus already familiar virus mutated? However, case, fact identify sewer water March last year, means already mutated then. really weird confusing finding. Trump certainly watch Snap Maps Snapchat, easily see thousands people social distancing wearing masks NYC. anyone stopped think lead world number cases simply also lead world testing?
 
Our rank tests per capita: #26
 
Our rank cases per capita: #12
 anyone stopped ask questions regarding ACTUAL numbers regarding death due virus?
 
Huh? Yeah, lots people.
 anyone stopped ask 25% deaths aren‚Äôt even tested virus counted COVID deaths anyway?
 
The majority experts seem agree number deaths actually quite bit higher officially reported. Check recent spikes unspecified pneumonia related complications, example.
 maybe hospitals receiving 13,000 dollars per COVID patient compared 4-5000 non COVID patient?
 
Have stopped consider idea costs treat someone COVID someone without, due isolation, quarantine, fact virus novel we're testing bunch treatments?
 wants hear truth whatever reason
 
What's truth?
 try spread truth, get censored banned leftist media dampening fear worry imbedded us
 
So think virus big deal, then? *entire world* locked collectively freaked took drastic measures something that's solely manufactured fear purported American left? actual fuck talking about? It‚Äôll week! pandemic emergency? U.S. haha aunt thinks he‚Äôs devil I‚Äôm confused why... ""richest"" country world...

Basically go saying increased restaurants predict increase cases two weeks later, dug around Chase Credit card spending data til found ""stuff"". So... racists blaming Asians actually blame, encouraged people come places like Sweden? exactly thinking... Cool chart, unless show deaths sources, really showing anything all... know Thursday yesterday, right? You‚Äôre posting stuff Wednesday. haven‚Äôt hit surge capacity yet. Looking like 11 days used think too, one thing can‚Äôt square twice, trump called upon followers come show violent force, twice found.

When scurried bunker turned lights White House scary people would think wasn‚Äôt home, tweeted bullshit, tomorrow night MAGA night. dog whistle supporters come clash protesters. one showed.

As headed wet fart Tulsa rally, made similar tweets inciting followers clash protesters, one showed up.

As Cohen told us testimony, trump doesn‚Äôt issue direct commands, lets feelings known provides cover misdeeds expects loyal followers fill blanks. way always deny culpability still getting outcomes desires.

Either followers dense put dog whistles together, paper tiger. Since talking trump, everything man kind lie, I‚Äôm starting think expansive gun-toting militia waiting beck call might largely work fiction. 

Sure plenty supporters guns, probably even large proportion would happily threaten boogaloo online. trump calls take streets, become brownshirts sweep away troublesome protesters, nowhere found.

If protests shown anything it‚Äôs ‚Äúsilent majority‚Äù trump. like watching Jaws again. virus air! Nothin see folks, back beach go! thing is, never tell anymore. people believe really whacko attacko stuff. Earth flat. Vaccines death. Masturbation leads low testosterone. Women psychos money. Etc etc etc.  Yeah definitely. cost/benefit here.

Luckily places instituting masks things like cycling running, places have, see counterproductive. I've ever World. :\ There's first world problem ever one. Would able link sources, especially got multiple strain info from. keep getting mixed answers that, yet see actual peer reviewed evidence. Governor finally takes head sand.

Yes NJ great right now, remember laughing Florida taking lesson situation? better. We're rushing get haircuts eat restaurants ""it's bad now""

Well bad Florida... was.

Don't follow phases, stay safe. CDC predicts 5-8% people nationwide, 10% cases detected. NYC may around 20% infected. sure sarcastic actually dumb.

Lol. I'll get mission accomplished banner. need go camping woods stay away people. Florida reports nearly 9,000 coronavirus cases, new single-day high
From CNN's Tina Burnside
The Florida Department Health reporting least 8,942 new cases Covid-19, bringing state total 122,960, according data released state Friday. 

Friday's data highest single day reporting coronavirus cases since start pandemic.

Yesterday, Florida reported 5,004 new cases coronavirus. florida even exist Covid doesn‚Äôt give shit summer heat, comes indoor air conditioning! observe Tennessee isn‚Äôt true... That‚Äôs hoping say 2020.  Traditionally, elderly populations don‚Äôt take well vaccines, that‚Äôs established. don‚Äôt know new mRNA style vacc though. developing world point, developing world countries actually better equipped mass vaccine production, like India China, America. Weeks drinking bars later..... hmm might little problem here. sounds harsh, people simply going reap sow here. 

The tragedy people smart cautious taken collaterally. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs ‚Äúokay‚Äù especially ‚Äúgood‚Äù happening, there‚Äôs much large swathes society refuse activate neurons. let people Sweden country fault country. 

Um, no? Sweden's fault letting infection run population create ""herd immunity"" controlled burn. Swedish Mountain, dozens Dutch German campers, cars Latvia, Lithuania, Norwegian cars, Danish cars. week midsummer. get exported cases. camping area, people work Sweden.

Ah like Ann Linde said ""multiple letters"" Swedes complaining Danes breaking NPI recommendations? Sorry side debate lied kind thing often hard take seriously say tons foreigners Sweden. Proof happen. looking forward reading papers peer-reviewed. wondering happened people said crazy thinking Florida would spike NY?? lol Even cut military budget zero still wouldn‚Äôt enough subsidize every citizen business let happen without fight.. 'step inside ring, put guard let opponent hit wait gets tired' strategy isnt exactly inspiring safer nba player florida resident right mean obviously troll account there's two valid points here. One, shame effective weight loss strategy, two, shape worse health. that's yikes dawg This! found March 2019 samples Barcelona. I'd slow conclusions still know little Considering fatality rate particularly high first place takes fairly long time people die, much pressure mutate towards less deadly, no? People can‚Äôt accept harsh realities ignorance hell drug. lot people don‚Äôt understand right options shitty vs. really shitty desperately trying cling normal pandemic doesn‚Äôt allow. Dr. oZ BoTh!!  Deaths covid important metric, that‚Äôs hard really judge middle it. many current cases going die it? Presumably higher percentage die us healthcare system good nations like uk simple fact people going avoid hospital long can‚Äôt afford it. Number cases important metric. can‚Äôt judge complex issue like single number. It‚Äôs disingenuous best. Imagine apologist conspiracy theory nut jobs ignore fact people condition using card false pretenses. Social distancing canard applied push people families poverty desperarion, giving police extra powers harass arrest going taking walks, except suddenly stopped applying - *definitely social distancing* - mobs rioters looters, taken streets since. Suddenly stop caring social distancing police orders people need stay incarcerated homes. part reason strategy dumb.

People clearly need understand rules, why, necessary resources comply.

When not, end whatever is. number new cases day continues rise, eyes also percent positivity rate number people tested day. Friday morning, rate new cases 13.05 percent, increase Thursday's 8.72 percent.

Crazy high percentage too. interesting. I‚Äôd like learn could provide source? Haven‚Äôt left house since finding I‚Äôve exposed except get test. ppl fortunate, people selfish asshats. 

Also still takes 5 days get results? absolute fuck? *bend covid knee*  Section 7 clause B subsection 1: reads "" MERICA"". could sound less prejudiced replaced ""people US"" Trump voters/supporters. Less half voters voted generally 50% voter participation. So, quarter population elected people voted him. closing businesses preventing people gathering reasons going help reduce cases?

what seeing right spike result opening places.... I've writing senators congress people. I've tweeting president please move actions good faith. know anything else do? want complainer. Americans need help mess badly. Yep. see NY license plates everywhere (I'm south florida one worst effected counties)

Of course Florida blowing up. new Yorkers brought fled city. ""only young people getting it"" crowd. I'd like applaud governor, let's honest: zero choice. People going start dying. point, political cost body count becomes great, even measured economic cost. didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm spotting Karens. ICU‚Äôs reached capacity Houston yesterday  dude deaths cases especially trump slowed testing still getting high cases Bruh absolutely true. Every single time I've gone store driven past people easily less 50% wearing masks, honestly would say around 25% wearing ‚ÄúNo one ever got sick rallies, include me! Start church, get sick...‚Äù said. ‚ÄúI got Satan deemed get it. wanted quiet work. slow building church. That‚Äôs about. world won‚Äôt see that. Why? live behind veil. choose live behind veil. choose hate God.‚Äù

Translation: would rather die admit wrong. can‚Äôt wait Town Hall meeting one obese pre-existing condition. 20-30% people USA. puts dangerous group. roughly 25% USA get would 1 5 chance hospitalized. 

That's still rediculous number. 

70k football game . said 25% (17500) randomly selected 1 5 chance hospitalized. rest 1 40 chance. 

Of randomly selected...and one lucky ones hospitalized 1 5 chance death. 

(That's assuming none pre-existing conditions). 

Yeah... I'm thinking rather empty game announced ahead time. go. people know go either. 

Yeah need entertained way. I'll read book. Dont try bring another viewpoint this. reddit hivemind already decided US literally satan incarnate, countries (including China Russia) putting us shame. 

We need shut economy close eyes. Fuck millions people looking losing homes, life savings, small businesses. Fuck people need close economy stop talking scary Invisible Enemy defeated. meantime though fuck hard working American disagrees worried savings. money-hungry, heartless monsters care themselves. Unlike me, clearly empathetic caring want turn everything essentially sentence half country financial destitution. Lmao come statistic like this? survey send American people? Alabama, practically one wears mask. Walmart pickup week employees masks hanging around necks required wear one. shoppers going out, maybe 1/20 wearing mask. It‚Äôs business usual land don‚Äôt ‚Äúbelieve in‚Äù virus. new cases mostly among young people, that's surprising. still think virus mutated benign strain. think eventually get there, yet. minneapolis rising either last checked low paid employee, cant fucking wait till jackass tries pulling one fake exemption cards me. ready boot ass store. still uses money leverage steer huge amounts public funds, usually institutions control over. I'm saying he's profiting I'm pretty sure he's he's convinced that's what's best world, depressing part he's probably right. huge issue single person amount power, even particular one trying use good. Based *confirmed* cases, 1 5 require hospitalization 1 20 die. least handful studies based antibody sampling suggest it‚Äôs quite dire that, also several reports antibody tests aren‚Äôt particularly reliable, return lot false positives. 

Maybe (and hopefully) they‚Äôve addressed reliability issues, I‚Äôd like see proof accept optimistic figures, particular we‚Äôve seen attempts countries involved study downplay severity virus different times. Agreed. They're even getting living part right.

I'd also wager people like ""straight talk"" call people ""snowflakes"". fuckin guy. State issue shut alcohol drinking restaurants bars due spiking cases, Disney World? We‚Äôve gotta open Disney World live Orlando. guarantee people answering poll lying. doubtful since number people going back work inside, without mandated masks two months ago much higher produce spike recently. remember, event might lead spike spikes order, can't protest spike opening spike memorial day spike, later end july everyone blames 4th july fireworks/parades, remind them. Unless someone wins. 76% said article. Op probably put data June 12th.  That's nice all, implanted microchip identities gateway Orwellian dystopia. something inside body (without option take you) different papers leave home. one figure social security number walking past, extending internet things people ... ugh. No. no.
I'm sure would make great Black Mirror episode, though. What's source 2020 pneumonia deaths? WONDER data 2018 far tell course. mistake Again, legal definition absolutely garbage. dictionary definition absolutely matches said trolling gangsters who're assaulting claiming COVID beat absolutely falls outside dictionary definition terrorism.

And yet people lived air conditioning, even buildings. sunny sunshine state Aside people working tech field still allowed work home jobs require people go office. stay home quit job unemployment, exhaust savings eventually get forced unemployment voluntary qualify mortgage forbearance rent deferral programs.

That said, I'd expect see compliance mask orders higher could go wrong? /s. thing celebrated facts. Understanding topic discussion imply belief feeling part. 

Though issue law used instance. concerns law selectively enforced obviously abused. One significant studies showing definitive link smoking cancer cohort study (which uses epidemiology principles), clinical trial. Epidemiologists extremely important medical field. fact lot physicians go study epidemiology especially want work global organization like WHO.  100k people stadium seats probably safe. much difficult keep hallways, bathrooms, concession stand lines, etc. safe, though. Also Indianapolis small city. Houston definitely protests. two places see people masks; inside Costco mirror. eyes covered ?

&amp;#x200B;

You know virus enter body eyes ? enter respiratory system tear duct mucus membrane eye .

A loose fitting mask person wearing stop bodily fluids going everywhere, ie curb spread virus. Thats surgeons/nurses/doctors them. Incase infect patient whatever illness might have.

So close proximity someone isnt wearing mask somehow eject bodily fluids everywhere, theres still chance catch it. Stay safe dude.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont think kind info shared enough virus entering eyes. I'm mistaken, large cities pretty filled already, they've actually able slightly decrease ICU population, made smaller rural communities. surprise, age who's tests coming back positive dropped nearly 25 (from \~65 \~40) years across country meaning severe cases require ICU treatment much less likely despite high case numbers 1:1. (the ICU numbers go absolute values, proportionally) Now, younger population begins mingle older, could change, viral load still seems important indicator case severity asymptomatic carriers tend lower viral load, limit ICU bed need predisposed severe symptoms already (smokers, asthma etc.). You‚Äôre reddit dude lol maskjamins, baby. body wearin', 'cause mofos carin'. [Man found Dallas apartment 'died three years Total failure regardless, States required masks way better shape Texas, even see spike. record numbers.

I think clear happening going happen. Dat! mean, much US actually that, aside New York got hit hard anyone else could. 

The problem matter much learned states' healthcare systems verge collapse. Man wish guidelines Texas, people part wearing masks, hence reason spike. super market last night caught Karen yelling one employees stating reason wearing mask make president look bad. like WTF?? I'm also wearing mask due trying survive fucking pandemic, nothing president!!

""Karen's"" used sort common sense back day, happened?? get raw data here: find kids already coronavirus back March april, mean 0 social distancing back then. mom teaches school, day lockdowns PA started, school large event gym 0 social distancing.

It could happened kids age dont show symptoms all, wouldnt tested. Federal sense every state locked time due fearmongering. suspect knew meant that, though.  really wish require students wear masks too. takes one student bring home. game again. hadn‚Äôt thought way.

But regardless, areas stringent quarantines imposed, compliance better. Whatever level set bar at, compliance going waver around it, people less asked them, exactly what's asked, more. set bar much higher level, much stricter measures, wavering around suggested measures going high level. barely set restrictions, wavering going around low level. 100 days home 600 week profit pocket burning people must go party beach. police need reason hand financial driven citations. 

The police catch person without mask. Rather fine, officer takes picture name. image uploaded site rouge's gallery people wearing mask. People search caught without mask. 

Let social pressure motivation, fine. Neither I, world live deal best something happens.

I wish nothing best whatever worth you, everything avoid getting giving virus. also believe healthy live fear keep perspective... especially situation, positive outlook extremely important, studies shown mental health really impact physical health. It‚Äôs nobody gives fuck. 
We‚Äôre doomed Failure leadership. Despite federal governments lack leadership, Illinois governor shown decent leadership throughout mess. Illinoisans complying wearing masks hunkered pretty hardcore April May.

If local government stepped up, could enough save lives, least. choice. Next couple weeks gonna shit show. can't help think China tested 2 million people find 256 cases last outbreak. Earlier issue, tested 11 million people (and entire city) one week.

Add fact they'd probably lose war implemented social distancing enemy see report it. Feels like there's us posts sub ever fill also, given health department Bundesland going in, airline. also mandatory two week quarantine came abroad, think case anymore (depending country come from). 

My point even though said everyone wear masks, still allowed people take eat (the virus going stop infectious eating), flight one hour long people could gone without food. wait, word way?

I'll say they're hurting money. Instead he's unbelievably unmanly Reason morality. Imperialistic countries need Imperial measures. I‚Äôm Florida. don‚Äôt remember smirking it.

Disney isn‚Äôt problem. anyone know could go obtain average hospital stays? I'm curious that, average cost per stay US especially. Good going Florida nothing like locking barn door horse common sense tested first maybe slipped ""stupid"". proof though? seen it. I've simply seen ton insinuation must root cause spread. clarifying directive easily explained fact conservamedia making sound like deliberated pushing contagious pos cases senior homes.  Florida's cases rise directive. unless senior homes made full lockdown zones staff living onsite nothing going food supplies, continue hot zones. bad things. completely half assed. Furthermore Texas government actively fought cities counties attempting enforce mask wearing. would little cautious right now, possible recent protests could bring increase cases days (taking consideration 2-3 week gestation period), case. we're 120,000+, still going

And **that** optimistic, may realistic say, *""and getting started.""* ""European standard"". believe want  poor billionaire owners?! First time seeing antima! That‚Äôs genius. Well test, number goes back down, right? ^/s making miss bars:-( Governor DeSantis want seen issuing mask order, want seen closing businesses.  Halsey Beshears dirty deed him. (Half it, least.)

Either that, Beshears team player, fired end day. Oh yeah, think impossible feat that's random person blogging vacation farm comparing climbing Everest. claimed farmers can't take vacations, said unlikely would intensive season. 

Over 90% businesses Gotland employing less 5 people, small family businesses cannot afford hire someone, especially year pandemic previous tourism Gotland stopped due safety measures recommendations unnecessary travel within country. one posted another topic difficult region year, ignoring sources suddenly claiming people would jump joy visit Norway RIGHT NOW.

Shit gonna hit fan US. trump administration run bunch idiots. Can‚Äôt believe botched whole dam pandemic. gets worse shut again? really think US see another lock soon. many people influenced leadership. followers. glorious leadership need mask, they?

Lead example. Meanwhile Savannah, nurses across street hospital getting lunch still refuse wear masks. Fuck place  real issue many ICU nurses have, many shift without stretched thin,

and many patients compared nurses. Pre-pandemic, years ago wife ICU open heart surgery, one room, one bed, one nurse. Plus little backup nurse watching paired neighboring room could cover bathroom breaks whatnot, Plus nurses nurses station helped nurses needed 2-3 nurses help someone take walk, roll change equipment something.

My wifes first ICU nurse named Francis. several first.

Could Francis watch two rooms little windows? Yes. Could Francis good job watching two rooms once? Maybe nothing bad happening.

Would care suffer Francis watch 2/3/4 patients instead 1? Yes.

I worry Francis ICU nurses pushed beyond limits. one two days row, weeks. get concern live Canada. 

We‚Äôve living together least 6 years, considered common law relationship. Common law relationships legally binding marriages. way taxes work here, difference benefit listing common law spouse (which last 4 years) vs married spouse.

Additionally, life insurance property together. That's happens reactive instead proactive. advertising product service really false advertising. errors probably stupid sloppy. Even doomers surprised news know high risk 75 year old. Restaurants favorite thing. love taco bell fast food.  risky me.  start hide bodies?

Nah, wanted add perspective. totally get coming quotes get bit tiering imo totally justified much needed atm. gladly read Reddit repeatedly current dire situation overcome. start fire covid disease can't much said, SARS-CoV-2, quick fix (: understand anybody went school would want wear masks.

Selective listening school ignorant parents spewing bs.

""Nearly 90 percent Americans say wearing mask ..."". Based observations, statement leads believe something like 70% Americans simply liars. place see consistent mask usage smaller stores absolutely insist everyone store wear mask, escort don't. Hell no. Something similar happening Florida, finally, least little bit backtracking DeSantis....  [Quoting another That‚Äôs quite article ([Clinical immunological assessment asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 said. found people *asymptomatically infected* lost antibodies quickly showed symptoms. Importantly (and certainly lost media reports) majority groups (60% \~90%) still detectable antibodies 8 week mark.  several odd things article make little skeptical. one thing, study also saw drop antibodies 8 weeks symptomatic infection, whereas several larger studies tracked symptomatic patients least long seen drop. example, [Dynamics IgG seroconversion pathophysiology COVID-19 ‚Äú*Antibody responses decline follow almost 2 months*‚Äù. ‚Äú*In survey, find evidence decrease IgG antibody titer levels repeat sampling.*‚Äù ([Humoral immune response prolonged PCR positivity cohort 1343 SARS-CoV 2 patients New York City  two studies, looking nearly 500 patients, find evidence antibody decline, study, 37 patients, find evidence. can‚Äôt ignore it, discount wait evidence.  it‚Äôs entirely plausible asymptomatic patients would weaker less durable response symptomatic.

Lmao shit won‚Äôt. type asinine rebuttal that. Florida could‚Äôve easily planned better mitigation efforts, rushed reopening appease Karens, pretend everything fine. Also, people Florida probably think shoot virus doesn‚Äôt help either. facts are, outbreak underway Florida, yet still try deny lmao. better? watched texas daily cases rise 1000 6000 say shit new cases printing 4500 day. literally waited Houston hospitals hitting 90%. Wear fucking mask. Tell mother brother sister wear mask. again: summer always intensive season farmers. Anyone claiming clearly totally ignorant complexity agriculture. 

So mixed, like thought. Meat dairy spring/fall heavy sector generally. Eggs year round. Vegetables vary, summer. silly claim would peak summer clearly false. 

Ah thanks link. interesting bit data: WORKPLACES 2016 EMPLOYEES DISTRIBUTED DIFFERENT INDUSTRIALS 10 066 workplaces Gotland 2016. majority workplaces agriculture. 

Which neatly disproves earlier claim majority tourism. 

It clear little experience farming. busiest seasons tend planting (spring) harvesting (fall). lol ""when sun warmth plants grow then"" just... mean... joking? 

Anyway, think I've proven claims everyone Gotland tied tourism farmers busies summer when, snicker, ""the sun warmth plants grow then"". Thanks goal source. kind you. particular given several those. sweet. nice day! Live PA, lancaster county...


Can confirm. testing = cases.... Lol, beyond obvious everyone agree it. 

Just popular reddit mean everyone agrees. allow take alcohol scenarios. know rules definitely pick bottle wine takeout dinner It‚Äôs over, buddy. valid Houston Florida? here, plus side done wonders spending. Realistically, rates currently seeing I'm sure actually ""buys anything"". 

Basically 5% infection rate try grouping groups hundred; groups come back positive back square one.

If break 20 groups 5, samve effort theory... much effort take combine track combination pools? Yeah, doesn‚Äôt work. He‚Äôll know soon enough rallies. ""problem"" mean ""mistake killed people"", yes?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah, get it. think especially communities lax mindset seriousness messy.

But gives hope preschool program hope son attend fall. live one states seems containing things people accepted mask protocol. It‚Äôs encouraging see type potential option maybe opening people need childcare help. Right!! I'm sorry caught it. symptoms? fairing alright? probably thinking, shut economy, GDP 50%. 2% population perished, 2% GDP down. count much that, unless daddy Donnie tells too.... don‚Äôt use ventilators anymore? Bear Minds 90% die yes casualty rate much higher due lack medicine stuff going 90%

Edit : there's still possibility leaders look demographics disease decided group acceptable loss, aka genocide Lol shit? virus originated China. Everybody correctly pointing finger China. sure getting Fauci. industries need open people get back work, I‚Äôm seeing lot companies whose workers perfectly capable working home trying reopen, stupid. rush? live IE, police sheriffs refused enforce here, pretty bad.

Otherwise, values another way. raised huge impact values. people didnt follow quarantine claim didnt work? Florida hospital employee here.

Our ICU hit capacity yesterday started diverting emergencies hospitals.

It gets worse every day. still buy ""COVID actually high-altitude sickness!"" hypothesis swirling around like 2 months back--*however* stands reason things lungs similar happens high altitudes, perhaps people whose bodies adapted life high altitudes would higher protective factors.

Has anyone done comparisons people Nepal high-altitude areas part world? Ass cancer cases one day Australia since pandemic started. ELI5 me? Greater air handling capacity, in-room air purifiers. school needs dedicated health safety officer. Genocide NOTHING amount people killed, it‚Äôs deliberate eradication ethnic group, race ethnicity, background, culture race.

So whether many indigenous die, Bolsonaro deliberately doesn‚Äôt help lets die, could accused genocide. Holy shit Well said mate. absolutely blame right wing media questioning it, especially back March April. It‚Äôs antithesis word ‚Äúconservative.‚Äù ‚ÄúOpen back up‚Äù day 1 lockdowns radical, reckless idea. Limbaugh likes say smartest audience think themselves, know damn well, listeners waiting point view issues align it. Someone much influence millions people absolutely blood hands. 

If look weather analogy use Texas example, yes may 3 inches snow. Problem is, ‚Äúopen up‚Äù strategy, snow isn‚Äôt melting getting another 3 inches snow, another. Next thing know time, back 2 half feet snow accumulated around town, systematic breakdown... I'm resonded to, example strawman, probably respond something like ""most people want murder people."" 

The guy salient point, issue actually system itself. 

The issue democracy inherent assumption electorate rational informed. Unfortunately, electorate rarely rational informed, leads scenarios like people self destructive. particularly terrible US ignorance culture people believe convictions override science facts.

Edit: Never mind responded stuff abortion, he's bright. economy really works rich. Shut down. Now. won‚Äôt see change unless start feel portfolios /r/COVID19 got taken astrofurfers stopped able control narrative around wanted things opened. See results. Back starting line. florida resident confirm taken seriously. Florida much ""masks weak libtards"" camp. take day Great lakes Florida beach day week three times Sunday. can't work home need get back get work. company. zero reason everyone work home so.

Yup. pleaded management least make voluntary got ""business democracy."" first-past-the-post system, vote one top two candidates *are* wasting vote, shitty is.

Certain people specific states outright laughing asses NYC. Even going far proclaiming deserved this. 

I hope works Texas, Florida Arizona. even get hopes well wishes. 

Furthermore, stay state, follow shelter place covering mouth. Especially since like NY wished us die. 

What next; visiting NYC, PPE yanking masks? 

Disgusting deplorable behavior... parents found exposed confirmed case covid19 (who exposed someone passed away). came stay home next week haven‚Äôt touched them. wait results go get tested go today? didn‚Äôt think would show 2 days never know. needed go dr appointment I‚Äôve cancelled, theoretically leave self quarantine home.

that's even worse, it? waste attention resources. Everyone knows originated China. point article counter-productive vilify specific region pandemic global issue. like barricading front door backdoor wide open. Wouldn‚Äôt surprised test hold onto butt cough Really dumb question number new infections equals number new recoveries day, say curve flattened? figured would take 14 days. figure would increase testing enough find them. testing 28K people day. love cheese. wants pure polls joke. Also, tested samples every month 2019 negative except March. Looks like contamination me. Give 3 months compare fact can't keep heads unemployment lockdown government's fault. 

Not fact compensate lockdown, , country like US, social security systems there. saying doctors can‚Äôt corrupt influenced financially? curriculum medical school taught otherwise. mess around long enough everyone test positive. Florida also senior citizen population 20% really bad, compared NY 16%.

This going bad. Well guess wittle fee fees gonna really hurt lose senate presidency November. orange daddy incompetent managed put North Carolina, Georgia Texas play 2020 election. gonna fucking massacre. Sad agree. without actual enforcement policies majority people going care. Going interesting rest year. Ok ‚Äúall takes infected people without masks everyone vicinity danger.‚Äù use blame BLM protestors people admit ‚Äúdenounce science don‚Äôt wear masks.‚Äù don‚Äôt know kind science believe doesn‚Äôt make sense.

I'm pretty sure one grocery store last two weeks.   Umm..... probably not. Neighbor: ""I see big deal is, hardly anyone neighborhood wearing mask one gotten sick.""

Yet. He's gonna get virus. He's taking hydrochloroquine remember? people Florida wear mask stay inside two weeks watch rates drop like believe. everyone got unemployment bud.

And now, states seeing big surge cases, rather admitting deadly disease, perhaps NY fudging numbers, want color facts different color paint? think big problem millions people, including myself, became unemployed this. past months devastating everyone‚Äôs finances think people sit wait government checks come out, getting impatient get back work. say reason.

I‚Äôm going kids go school respiratory therapy make millions. 31k hotspots. guys got new cases single day got .CH far, got lot imported cases Italy. 1k -2k cases USA might traceable quarantine contacts, even person met 30 people past 2 weeks getting sick, talking 900k people.. Somethings wrong, feel Probably dont know think, know working living. douche help case. Yes, exactly. sooner better, time still better never. 

None places seem idea comes after, though. made sense back March panic move, world followed lockdown containment get economy back running. Unless close state borders US going series lockdowns failed reopenings everyone 18 months, there's good chance every business service industry go under. work man 20's hospitalized it.  AFAIK put ventilator ask. work weeks. He's back work, seems fine now. Yep. used worse start, gotten much better last weeks. FWIW I'm far one who's noticed this. [Frode Forland, Norway's state epidemiologist believes critical debate interviewed several Swedish media ask questions things support Sweden's strategy. feels like want support government strategy. Sweden goes whole world.

Again, gotten *better* SVD, DN, Kvartal, tabloids, etc. *always* better state run media, hoo boy beginning state run media lockstep. better now, still shows signs downplaying sometimes. Like instance. still parents teachers? Irrelevant, that's sheriff decide anyway. Shutting open three weeks blow roughly 40 employees work three bars, exhausted Paycheck Protection Program loans, said. 

I feel workers. crazy dysfunctional society become we've conditioned accepted twisted system normal, people choose making paycheck survive vs preserving health. problem closing bars, failure government job ensure people need get emergency without put lives unnecessary risk. like toe cheese shit sandwich. getting complacent, recognizing 1.5 months ago significant number unknown positives.

Today probably find 90%+ positive cases, know back likely 50%. Recognizing bad thing.


Saying case rates silly. almost definitely isn't. cases always existed, know them. sad thing wearing mask mostly protects you, wearing mask mostly endangers them.

People refuse think ‚Äúit‚Äôs personal choice‚Äù think fail realize this. Thank didn‚Äôt know changed anything terms policy. See, equate AZ leadership closely Italian police Hellsing Abridged. Gratuitous amounts people dying, meanwhile they're tent bragging offered immortality (Joke's you, promised double immortality!) Reality ANTIFA lie, pinko good difficult keep status England infections pick up. Scottish border can't closed booked southwest Vegas August, removed middle seat every row. Thought everyone know mortality rate largely function age people getting infected. infected people eighties, would kill 10% them. infected people forties, would kill 0.1% them. (I'm trying downplay seriousness, 0.1% still ten times bad traffic accident deaths.) heard major outbreaks nursing homes recently assume better protected now, nursing home deaths made 50%-80% deaths back spring, deaths rates current waves fraction March/April death rates keep up.

At time, better testing means capturing milder cases went un-confirmed before. cases, less deaths, also spread (judging percentage tests coming back positive) younger population, situation different Wuhan/Italy/Spain/NYC, clear deaths/hospitalization situation evolve here. progress treatment, especially anti-coagulates anti-inflammation management, seen studies claimed hospitalized patients better outcomes months ago. Edit: saw one  But, but.... one week decline really show us anything. Well, us paying attention .... Yea Art Deal... /r/murderedbywords protests, especially anti-lockdown protests condemned, hard care. everything relaxed nationwide, seems many agree. could cut military budget 10% next 20 years enough money every working American take 2 weeks work paid. We'd still far largest military budget world. Yep spread definitely due mostly bars massive protest metropolitan areas Okay? That's unrelated title. ""less"". American's hub city Dallas....


This fine. deaths dropping March levels... means known along.  massive excessive deaths occurring due Covid. Unless plans take foundations apply funds US PPE something helpful, needs stfu stop perpetuating echo chamber shit already know. tbh it‚Äôs getting old hearing rich fuck people tell US bad they‚Äôre without helping. Fwiw he‚Äôs wrong, it‚Äôs fucking old hearing ol shit inaction attached. Nah... mean, course ask professional. year ago almost 3 year old saying 12 words variations Bah, too. he‚Äôs using full sentences, singing along songs, asks words doesn‚Äôt know read books. whole plan normalize wait vaccine. Hospital become hotel peak tourism time. swabbed heard pretty invasive. burnt smell could tiny bit blood. Kind like picking nose long fingernails cause cut. get better. joke right? economic impact horrendous. See unemployment... No, cheap effective. dealing potentially millions deaths globally, 10-30% drop mortality *lot* lives saved. long say danes. weird thing americans call danes ""dutch"" reason. Well almost nothing gets reported weekends, effectively count weeks' data Saturday Friday, weekends backlog accumulates. Waiting cancel youth fall sports. understand yet area Good points know. that's exponential growth curve looks like ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I wish people would better. no. suffer extendedly. lol Good try Comrade, we're falling propaganda, go pedal shit elsewhere. think cancelled, think be. dollar signs much pass up. hope right thing, I'm counting it. would cooperate. must respectfully disagree (slightly). think come support distancing &amp; wearing mask, would enough turn tide. Even could it. cult following would turn dime &amp; start wearing masks. honestly believe verbal support would enough get 80% wear mask. never happen course, even he, Melania, kids came don‚Äôt think would enough change message.

I'm sorry, 9k new cases? fuck? point criminal charges filed decision making politicians? issue rising cases itself, rate. 

if cases go slowly enough, never really gets control. said, still going far quickly southern california right now. writing wall Desantis wanted pander Fuckface. large extent, true, depending opinion - confuse opinion (I think chocolate better vanilla) misinformation (I think vaccines cause autism).

Guess there‚Äôs reason anything shit 9000. overnight numbers must brutal. DeSantis finally caved shut bars today. Restaurants still open long make 50% money food. still make masks mandatory. going end well Florida. really tho? answer no. ramping up. Exponential increase really look like big gains does. significant procedural error leading fatal outcomes, rather virus. 

I'm sure deaths flu would much higher ignorantly treated every bad flu case intubation, right?  3 weeks day. ready first place. went phase 1 phase 2 seven days. feel horrible owners really blame DeSantis following reopening plan. Would bet good portion 44% need income. It‚Äôs either go bankrupt/ bleed years savings go back work low risk death. point banning travel one location silly good reason believe could elsewhere. time travel restrictions went up, way late. would think work grocery store people legitimately incapable freely deciding this. People don‚Äôt wear masks, go wrong aisles, don‚Äôt social distance, also don‚Äôt wear masks properly wear masks even REMOVE masks cough!!!

Last week customer pulled mask coughed face, wasn‚Äôt trying malicious specifically incredibly stupid also selfish thinking gross cough mask opposed me. (And I‚Äôve started coughing hope allergies idk)

You‚Äôre going force people, punishments. aren‚Äôt things myself, visual data helps see big picture.

I've tried googling gotten answers. I've covid symptoms 21 days still symptoms. biggest hobby swapping postcards people world, I'm finally feeling good enough write postcards. anyone know still contagious? write postcards symptoms gone? I'm seriously ill anymore, still cough lungs shitty still getting headaches vertigo (although bad). know covid lasts like 24-72 hours cardboard, think write cards today keep waiting? sarcastic. :) bodies adapted, instance, express ACE2 differently something like that. possibly adaptations make harder get infected.

Yikes.....  news... American Association Realtors says housing markets booming perfect time invest first home second home! Lol! millions trump fans running around proudly without masks purpose Texas opened up.. sure nothing it. polls give hope ""majority"" think correct thing less 90% Woohoo, number 1! Greatest time. Biggest bestest.. beautiful numbers. great job. one better, one beating us. begs question 'why then'? give fuck constituents, serve corporate masters. world effective gave money random people wearing masks correctly social distancing. Told stop bothering plague rat.

Stop harassing me. I‚Äôm really curious common people Covid19 long-term even permanent damage bodies. horrifying stories people thirties didn‚Äôt necessarily get life-threatening sickness virus still feel like crap months later. apparently rare even asymptomatic people evidence lung damage show CT scans.

Does anyone know studies could put estimate likely ‚Äúlong hauler‚Äù lingering problems Covid19 than, say, month contracting virus? badgered couple people work yesterday wear mask common area (as company policy). One sheepishly put mask on, laughed us said ""well guess know selfish one is.""

I mean sheer stubbornness. Refrigerator truck morgues bodies forklifts pretty much woke everyone NYC area. would link article support point trying make? often wonder done convince people joke needed conquer virus throw one heck world party after.
Then remembered full page magazine ad. photo man close biting bullet inside oxygen tent. anti tobacco ad. image stuck unforgettable.

Texan work, agree. job easily done home. employer, political reasons, making us come office. think issue larger rafts sitting right next strangers people shouting laughing hours right next other. Yes outside safer bar, may 8 people raft. Noah gave ample warning catastrophe hit, could ignore pounding Ark. human nature understand hard. still tackle **real** issue this.

Mandate businesses require masks customers employees follow risk shut down. would help slow infection rates monumentally. Limiting restaurant capacity mean damn thing nobody requiring masks.

Que next weeks get better **then** finally hits them: ""maybe require people wear masks?""

This really starting piss seeing leaders(R*publicans, f*ck automod) purposefully playing dumb know damn good well doing. They're disingenuous. say ""we idea would happen"", they're really thinking ""man, hope weather storm el*ction day"".

Sorry asterisks, I'm really tired sub censoring people saying f*cking truth excuse ""incivility"". someone literally murdering people, forgive get little ""uncivil"".

This censorship starting become real joke. know laws well, strategy stay lawful keep business churning $$$ profit growth. quarterly profits proved profitable, stopped investment R&amp;D growth Student Ithaca here. Super happy see Tompkins County well: one active case left yesterday, ZERO death! would rather anywhere else moment. feel like one states that‚Äôs truly bent curve Lmao shut leadership really gone shithole.  framed press. said ""people went told us conditions bad"" would different.

Why making something happen? make hospitals, can‚Äôt make doctors nurses.

There simply aren‚Äôt enough traveling medical personnel staff stand field hospitals.

Socially distance mask fucked. concern people start think everything ok since things starting get better, take seriously continue wear masks social distance. figure? people know least 100 folks. 90%. messed up. time started banning travel, already clear signs community infection. late then. would stop new infections coming overseas. Ghettos civilized policy we're headed.

But still, assault bot, know anything else. Poor little software. Covid Exit Strategy best graphed data state. Oh yea gotcha. I‚Äôm saying wasn‚Äôt important protest, find annoying many people seem scream leaving house unless went protest. 41 rolls proper duct tape expensive prom dress I'm glad places keeping mask order, know around aren't. 


Even place work, whenever customer comes without mask (fortunately pretty rare), instead giving one stock (we limited supply), we'll ask put sleeve face pull shirt face continue business usual. knowledge, turned away customer yet without face-covering. well. work small office one taking CDC guidelines even office guidelines seriously. coworker returned vacation Texas coughing sneezing creation without mask cool says allergies.

The assistant manager gives crap enforce mask wearing policy (no mask, entry) even though requirement put place office. can't talk boss also firmly ""anti-mask"" put I'm around look compliant. know do, feel scared hopeless. someone follows sports closely, would surprised holdout. Something like 80% league lives paycheck paycheck spend money. I‚Äôve seen plenty videos articles big name players coaches excited get back playing.

Especially you‚Äôre far home, don‚Äôt want walk around wet face full goo. forget companies extensive COVID policies actually enforce them.

Or businesses areas masks mandatory also enforcing really need zombie outbreak brains eaten convince otherwise? Bush's fault, president time. disturbingly large numbers Americans genuinely feel 9/11, Katrina, 2008 crash (all happened Bush's watch, least partially Bush's fault) Obama's doing.  automod sub White House employee! realize h‚Äôs spending last half life fighting malaria right?

What's Floridas hospital capacity right hey, big businesses took bailout laughed way bank! Thank God saved!!! /s two thirds. Florida even 400 per million 

And people still pretend like south failing compared north Reminds Baghdad Bob Hopefully 70%-90% accept coronavirus vaccine. obsessive drive prove opinion correct, assuming parents 1.2 million kids thinking, also assuming thinking. 

Drop bone, dude quit chasing tail. even. got dish sauce pour first serving. second serving turkey stuffed shit rotting flesh Thanksgiving. think peak Lombardy around 3200 cases 9600 test. Population 10 millions. 30% positive rate joke. Reopening proper measures precautions place better half assing lockdown. US bad both. partly true. median age positive tests Florida 33. Lmao someone clearly never paid attention math class. error poll going like 4% Selfishness, greed, cruelty ideals. would gladly see others dead edge. are. morality, ethics. enemies science truth, cannot reasoned with. Evil evil. margin error confidence level? Also assumes draws IID. Even independent, highly doubt identically distributed (which would increase margin error significantly). 

Think way, 90% CI means 10 samples basically able find 1 sample wrong. Given many samples currently ongoing, skeptical this. Fuck him.

We're hospital 30 minute radius we're diverting hospitals within network closest one 45 minutes away.

I hope EMTs encounter time sensitive issues.

We're currently working trying free capacity we're hearing transportation backlog we're hospital struggling continue diverting hours. also companies requiring employees come back office instead working home. employees capable job 100% remote required continue work home! I'm witnessing many companies opposite sake of, ""face face interaction"".

This company nutshell. deployed like 97% workforce home work remotely. started recalling people back office one June 1 supposed go back 15th. 

I three kids, two can't trust oldest watch others 9 hours. (Hell, oldest can't even bothered feed animals)

Because that, company allowed extra 30 days home. good 30 days going me? mention schools idea going proposed hybrid schedule, two days school/two days home week school/week home. Neither work working parents. 

There reason work remotely foreseeable future. someone came conspiracy Bill Gates started push online schooling, would say ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø, implanting chip taking temperature activating 5G? everyone condition right got covid-19 without hospitalization? (just patient mild symptoms recovered especially young adult)  bartenders know Texas making significantly money unemployment working. Haven‚Äôt even right come agreement. call progress letting guards letting run rampant, opening soon possible, let consequences come second progress fucks given. afraid backtrack said progress it‚Äôs ruse. Florida way worse reported also. Almost everyone know went get tested people turned away testing sites within 10 minutes open. enough staff enough tests population.

 They're also 100% bullshitting numbers deaths hospitalizations. go business normal. Beaches slammed, people masks, parents taking little kids crowded parks. brother apparently still wedding 2 weeks. Sorry, there. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 8k cases infections two weeks ago agree, ‚Äúrisk shut down‚Äù thing soft, especially state like Texas politicized, isn‚Äôt enough.

You want make public safety mom San Antonio TX dental pain bad drinking something remotely cold taking hear breath away. know hospitals full even remotely safe go see dentist?  


Is anything check going dental office? Probably right, definitely sad remember couple months ago people suggesting let happen go herd immunity.

My response say ""Fine, take 60% population multiply think plausible death rate catch virus."" Even take death rate influenza (about 0.1%), unrealistically low covid-19, US get 330 million * 0.60 * 0.001 = 198000 deaths. That's lowballing *everything*. Anything realistic (e.g., 70% significant herd mortality 0.3 0.6% mortality rate) goes multiple times higher. 200k unrealistic *floor* bad things would be. that's counting deaths, considering many people survive persistent chronic health problems rest lives catching it.

It's foolish idea try intentionally go herd immunity ""naturally"", especially path get promptly (in less years) period overwhelmed hospitals. think mods think ""we're it"" comes   p olitical nature discussions steer away inherently p olitical nature topics. can't really escape seem acknowledge that. threads get heated emotionally whether like not, serious topic could real lasting damage nation. would thought pretending thing anymore bored Quarantine would workable solution?  expected alternate dimensions 2020 full cyborgs food pills. scary like anymore.

Disneyland announced yesterday they're postponing re-opening. supposed July companies make choice allow employees work home need right.

There companies adopted great remote work-flows companies haven't. Remote work absolutely suck company right.

Furthermore, companies can't like, ""Oh hey, remote thing seems working out, let's keep up!"". redesign on-boarding process new hires, establish new policies procedures. 

It's easy employees working home say great, need come back office. But, company needs prove shareholders remote work feasible profitable long-run.

I'm saying applies office. But, companies fucking suck remote work, companies get right. Designing remote workflow works easy every company different.

In fact, would argue companies make switch remote, incrementally collect data ensure models work. good company, also employees.

My mother school teacher teaching remotely right workflow sucks complete ass, students suffering it.

Every business different, I'm playing devil's advocate here. want make sure company gets remote workflow right designs based evidence data. not, could wind hating job 6 months. would anyone consider poll average Americans? like getting medical advice Oprah? poll epidemiologists emergency room physicians?  positive note, Orange County turning blue.

Looks like 1 million dead estimates weren‚Äôt far Well, ignorant already, economists project 100,000 small businesses shut permanently since pandemic escalated March, according study researchers University Illinois, Harvard Business School, Harvard University University Chicago. latest data suggests least 2 percent small businesses gone, according survey conducted May 9 11. Well, government got clue infection rates since brilliant president decided bad idea test. practically speaking guys zero idea many infected moment. 9000 new reported cases?!?! hope reporting backlogs...

In state 22 million people tho! kinda crazy.

If assume hospitalization rate something like 15%, means around 1350 require hospital bed sometime next 2 weeks. probably couple hundred need intensive care...

scary. I've seen graphs 70% adherence break point really effective. Sounds like time talk Mab. understand masks reduce R. telling happen 95 percent compliance like telling get thing competent federal leadership. 

That's technically true - likely happen. getting 95 percent masks compliance. good get 50 percent many southern states. current infection bad - need hammer - lock it. think happen - soft one maybe like closing bars etc. China level one need (minus welding people homes course). refer New Zealand. active cases given area, continuous active testing, treat Covid poses significantly reduced, even without vaccine treatment.


You're right Covid going away, may years viable vaccine, managed people could understand science enough government viable leadership. That's common problem. politically safer (regardless letter next name) reactive proactive. Humans tend poor risk-assessment (you see gambling, people cross railroad tracks despite oncoming train, etc). taking proactive steps, even based firm evidence, politically risky. posted two days ago, surge capacity still projected last 11 days. Even did...there's India... wonder many suicides triggered sub-section mask refusers, ones go way taunt fun reaffirm care people, assure one does. Defend selfishness accusing selfishness, praise other, go church time. Sorry got subject that's cause list hits closer home top even possibility major causes excluded. least I'm thinking Covid19 anymore. probably valid argument May. Jefferson County Alabama we've consistent 5% test positive case since May, although creeping up. number new cases double May, think pretty good indication indeed number people actually infected probably around double May. Either cook books lose job fight another one pandemic. gas companies immediately destroy water sources without making sure EPA thing. say can‚Äôt pay clean bankrupt. owner flies home private jet mansion. company broke.

Stay safe. care Americans think, CDC whose opinions matter. Good luck live Tampa trying schedule test CVS. I've trying days MinuteClinic scheduling site broken one knows schedule appointment, except online. cared liberal social pressure, complaining us wearing masks time :) Reminder percent positive suddenly stop mattering cause also increasing.

59k Tests, usually around 30k tests. Percent positive 13%. 90% increase current infections population single day, even close. literally possible with, even R 2.5 much brags success ""he banned China anyone else"", probably thing knows fight pandemic.  history shows anything, people blind severity situations past time stop it. sharing exact methodology used produce data CDC website. that, independently verified, major news story. is, clear done produce numbers whether deserve attention.

Yes want to. stores right demand that. either comply go elsewhere

IDGAF, business proof website specializes partisan political news coverage Sovereignty exists.

You choose go life scared. That's fine. choose look facts, behave rationally, reasonably. Even though I've it, wash hands religiously, wear masks public, distance appropriately, etc. reality 4 5 people get it, symptoms handled home. people without known pre-existing conditions die? Yes. outliers? Absolutely. 35-40% deaths date nursing homes, assisted living facilities, etc. young healthy person odds get COVID able weather home. Saying like shot fear mongering bullshit.  deal scary parts come intelligence. hoping saying bad. That's reality. 

Except not. looking statistics. looking worst outcomes, imagining that's like everyone getting COVID. That's looking intelligence. That's looking fear. mean don‚Äôt really care much country I‚Äôm talking state 

The people need get tested can‚Äôt get tested, we‚Äôve 15-20% positive tests days city, Trump defunding 7 testing sites Texas. That‚Äôs unacceptable. Lombardy peaked two weeks closed. Florida still wiiiiiide open. Numbers much granular regional level. peak, Moscow used responsible half cases. Now, 10% due two months strictest lockdown country, overall numbers down. 

However, vicinity St. Petersburg slightly declined still unfortunate levels, large cities seeing increases (partly started getting tests per capita). That, least-developed regions virus used spread silently finally getting enough tests reveal 100+ cases day. think design. People like Trump believe average citizen pawn, someone work, serve country, whatever else power want need done. Take away education make stupid think themselves, makes easier manipulate lies, telling want hear, money. Especially money right. That‚Äôs Canada. It‚Äôs like couple weeks shitty lockdown, start going everybody wearing masks.

No bars anything like though ""Don't good citizen! keep spreading virus!"" First steps last resorts?  almost sound sadistic Trump is. little, late. TX needs lockdown now. get things alive longer stay enslaved. option provide things keep people alive would go to. life really changed.

Aww, upset quoting words back you? 

You take things seriously, responsibly without shutting fear them. Well, us can, anyway.   I'm curious... states news source tell rising quickly? news source use? Stop disengenuous. Small businesses evil cabal interested profits. I'm saying ideal, small businesses make 70% businesses. Instead helping them, government helped cronies. Many businesses make tough decisions try open safely go under. That's fact. sure would prefer open keep employees safer. Different states follow different patterns. report (Florida, New York, New Jersey), counties report individual times day (Pennsylvania, Texas, California), counties even report multiple times day (Los Angeles notably.) 16/360 4.4% positive rate, bad tbh texas But..but..I thought number go less testing. Worldometer meter 11,600~ NY northeast general well. think terms New England Vermont number cases growing. entire town 1-4 cases.

I've actually hearing people moving area outbreak bad here. I'm less thrilled about. sad fact tip good ol American iceberg speaks volumes matter. Touch√© chrono trigger. We‚Äôre absolutely fucked nobody wearing masks. I‚Äôm leaving apartment.  ""The Gang Solves Coronavirus Problem""

What's alarming fact many dumb dumbs positions power US making response pandemic much less effective otherwise would be.  said explain 11% rate...? ...and 9000 1 day. tomorrow, day that, day that, etc 14k I'm surprised before. I'm curious... states news source tell rising quickly? news source use? Lockdown skeptics:

Reality: *Sad trombone noises* live masks worn everyone, distance politely kept, anything everyone friendlier cautious stores such. 

Everyone refusing wear masks maintain social distancing. counties masks mandated, residents calling county government right order everyone wear them. SMH. sure, I‚Äôm hoping mostly affects areas I‚Äôm in. documentaries say it‚Äôll start Tokyo, maybe we‚Äôll warning. whole ""don't one tell do"" attitude many have. Yet they'll respect shoes/shirt service signs without question. experts say there‚Äôs little evidence link air conditioning spread coronavirus. Rather, risk likely comes amount time spent indoors [close proximity Yeah, chose wear mask flightdeck gulf much hotter. Wear appropriate mask bad.

Since assumption wrong, anything else would like try throw me? Lettuce. There's even festival. (You asked!) BENGHAZI investigated many fucking years???????? Right, like said: one case detected likely slip by. rightly pointed Swedes allowed travel Croatia likely one case importation occured. Incoming hordes people celebrating ""one last weekend party"" lockdown drops suspect, maybe hospitals reported? cleaned data?

I understand mentality people wanting vacation wanting enjoy beach, especially since depression anxiety skyrocketed lockdown. 

I think people suffering mental health feel like absolutely need go vacation Florida so, also take extra precautions social distancing obedient wearing masks indoors beach.

[EDIT - break words dumb BOT thinks adults can't speak calmly] reason positive cases deaths showing downward trend several weeks? would assume cases means greater chance death reflect that. hospitals medical professionals differently vs three months ago? want hear 'just wait two weeks!'

I yet see shop Denmark trusts people buying souvenirs jewellery. Food produce - sure. sold touristic places Gotland though. might 50 million dead people huh?‚Äù

Well, yeah. Record keeping complete consistent. One doctor England might classified flu death caused Spanish flu. doctor US might classified death caused pneumonia. technically correct.

We may never know true toll coronavirus reason. Russia seen gigantic spike pneumonia deaths year, coronavirus deaths high. kind spike Florida too.

Idiots, them. People say understand need increase STAFF well. need nurses real right Houston. people drive cars... detest avoid cities general, part true. Also, say homeless people am, they're shelters/state housing/not sitting street corner. 

[According I'm actually pretty much right; less 1,000 ""chronically unsheltered"" homeless people entire state less 3 county (which covers population 500k 800 square miles). Anyone homeless unsheltered likely refusing assistance due mental illness (which course real problem, I'm dismissing factor all), lack access shelter.

I refuting original person's assertion we're stepping homeless people time. Given total area covered completely possible people never see stereotypical ""homeless person"" sitting street, we're certainly tripping way work. unsheltered homeless population dramatically concentrated California, Oregon, Washington simple practical reason weather allows (combined high cost living state governments relatively little fix problem). course compounded states literally shipping homeless people California. 

Homelessness rates much Europe actually much higher here, though I'm sure varying methodologies impact statistics lot (and recent stats include refugees homeless course wildly skews numbers). Fucking piece shit worthless trash police even fucking enforce it. Fire fuckers. excuses justification bioterrorism.

Even lockdown ‚Äútoo loose‚Äù like US, see stupid things happen. town, liquor store never closed, head shop, food bank shut down. get draconian, worse unintended consequences happen. need reserve measures larger threats this. know, man, it‚Äôs pathetic. people screaming months going beach getting haircut would get us killed trying convince us amassing throngs people every major city effect all. Americans presented incredibly easy options help keep others safe: wear mask, say contact with, get vaccine comes out. even want that. fine first opened everything. everything open sends message safe. opened. wish people would realize this. would dumbfounded weren‚Äôt positive tests negative tests. people think tests 100% accurate? quite follow. would mean people got infected would fewer symptoms, prevent getting infected first place. also expect see similar phenomena places like alps, rockies, himalayas, etc. Yet need challenge ideas ideas come mental illness. debate schizophrenic closet people want eat heart, you? No. put meds.

These people completely fucking batshit insane. Go take time little research own. argue front Gov't counsels masks interfere God's Perfect Breathing Design, need masks God protect them, unconstitutional without read one single word Constitution. 

Go ahead, join Facebook group. Watch tim-foil hat conspiracy videos jerk to. come back try make argument need mental care. Geniuses. that's counting coaches entire staffs. Theres usually day week delay infected begin dying droves. Also, hospitals completely overwhelmed yet, big killer. systems start go longer provide care, people would survived begin die well. I'm well convinced virus takes much longer time know work destruction, 3 months first contact, say thing Spain year bit next level. we're actually dealing virus spreads year even shows living perfect start Plague .Inc run right we're well truly fucked. believe that's accurate. ABC OWNED DISNEY REOPENING DISNEY WORLD. FUCK.  ETA: Actually, wait second: true. claiming Gotaland mostly tourism then. 

Yeah, said agree quote one woman. thanks goal source! really appreciate much. :) That's really shitty. I'm surprised put rotation them. can't wrap head around people adamant go gyms times like this. work home. push-ups to. Order weights exercise bike. Glad know I'm alone :) 1950ies law aimed curb KKK temporarily repealed May 2020. also seem primarily concern people concealed carry appears enforced all. lol. laughed loud read this....... (although viewing Canada, us pretty much belongs the, ""No shit !!!!"" category. 

My question is, say remaining 44%???? need build wall around Florida make pay it. forget guys, virus democratic hoax wearing mask unamerican takes away freedom. /s I'm seeing businesses left right close city lockdowns.

Would agree put programs place prevent event another pandemic? example, part taxes already pay allocated emergency fund could simply distributed businesses cover wages, essentially paying everyone stay home period time? We've declining arguably since Nixon Reagan. 9/11 definetly beginning end though. virus become political bet continue increase 2020 election magically disappear everything going back normal. far know cases aren‚Äôt common, hear they‚Äôre scary mild case people permanent lung damage extreme cases. 

Keep mind respiratory infection results pneumonia certain damage lungs, COVID, usually goes away 6 months. According article can't. yeah precautions listed good. many people longer unless store. Oh shit you‚Äôre right. completely forgot rallies... given neurological impairments, chiropractic physicians managing many similar outstanding benefits. I'm kinda angry, parking lot parties cool feel like people jacking steeze. I've perpetual lot shit, show not, *years*.

COVID-19 ‚úñÔ∏è

It checks out. Time illusion. Lunchtime doubly so. frog can't choose posionous. Sweden could. could happened? Simple.

Take one closed bottle coronavirus. Add anti-science religious moronic politicians. Result: one open bottle coronavirus. thought insta convention center facilities less sick patients need oxygen supplementation critical care patients went hospital. That‚Äôs Javits center NYC.  Kind exactly like masks. Masks slow spread, stop it. accumulation incremental improvements different efforts - distancing, masks, washing hands, yes, temperature checks greatly reduce spread. must living alternate timeline, otherwise poll complete complete bullshit. Disneyland California, Disneyworld florida. understanding cali state government passed temporary mandate stopped phase opening caused Disneyland delay.

That, coupled fact Disneyworld taking park reservations resort guests week opened reservations AP holders today, makes think Disney wont shut Florida unless state makes them.

Edit: changed law temporary mandate. McConnel incredibly forward looking blocking SCOTUS nominees. Like looking 40 years ahead.  They're also working antibody prophylaxis treatments folks good candidates vaccines. Florida set field hospitals yet?

They need get ready asap. Hospitalizations death lag new cases.

They quicker set advance better they'll be. can't stop new cases now, damage control time now. think Germans send medical teams Romania things get hand. Worst thing this, starting containment measures. means expect two weeks growth, three six weeks needless death. ‚ÄúIceberg right ahead!‚Äù swear pandemic revealed sorts craziness. 

- people treat plague opportunity brag martyrdom 

- misanthropes actively return normalcy even science suggests could done safely

- (mostly work home) types concept many people needed keep society running even non essentials closed business regulators shut web portal launched make easier public file complaints businesses violate COVID-19 guidelines last month, cases statewide started surge.  spokeswoman said agency eliminated portal complaints dwindled.  state moved reopening number complaints greatly reduced agency returned standard online form receiving complaints regarding licensed business individual licensee,‚Äù spokeswoman Karen Smith said email.  department‚Äôs records show number complaints doubled April May.

And today Florida almost 9000 cases reports state intentionally manipulating COVID data. So, likely much worse know. also ongoing unemployment fiasco Floridians trying survive. could much better responsible leadership shred decency toward fellow humans.

What happening Florida negligent reckless - criminal too. Check Wire.in Florida, elect hipster doofus governor, really shocked sure would consider ""caves"" category Florida beaches talking vacations lol.

but yeah, dumb. go fuckin lake hang something aren‚Äôt immune lmao U U seeing failure local state governments. Small government doesn‚Äôt work make new beds say everybody thought thing do... then? think greater point know people idiots created societal institutions, like government, prevent harmful behavior coercion, including use force. Failing implement proper public health measures covid like permitting people commit negligent homicide. 

If DeSantis legalized murder, say everyone's job keep shot neighbor. that's happening here; requirement wear mask, there's lot people around stop you. walk around without mask, chances uncomfortably high could start transmission chain ultimately kill someone. data Florida irrelevant? anything it‚Äôs relevant American population. Asking people wear mask social distance much? Like ask people wear condom spread HIV. comparison made. Ofcourse shut HIV. helped . Texas thinking stronger virus...A VIRUS! didnt understand comment apparently. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è quite strong response someone entirely missing point made. It‚Äôs going tough. NBA going try bubble idea, it‚Äôs going easy one person breaks bubble, you‚Äôre fucked.  insanely fucking sad. data showed needed done, many states said fuck , are. Stay safe there, random Texas redditor.  Yep, seems issue. wish could check people's social media giving ICU bed. ""anti-mask/reopen now"" posts go end line. ventilator them. real study would pretty hard determine (maybe tracking covid recoveries people 75+) average dying see long live recovery see long covid typically cut life short. Especially someone stupid Greg Abbott. 3 months hard lockdowns - countries - even allowed walk outside without state permit exercise, let alone anything resembling normal life, hardly surprising we're seeing groups young people partying like there's tomorrow. 

Agree not, inevitable. muh liberties cases going up, mine. country control. biggest danger patriots stoking another massive wave.

 drank kool aid anyone itching kill grandma they're bored indoors. know explain old people higher risk friend's grandmother, killing forcing open economy places cases growing cold blooded.

If selfish morons would take seriously could handled curve would come like every country. Instead, day one, half country dragging feet like health experts doctors advice wrong STILL saying dumb shit. Fucking ridiculous. *expect* anything Americans anymore. live Houston...yesterday told fellow Houstonian flat doesn‚Äôt believe ICU‚Äôs capacity like reported. might end right current contract tracing data isn‚Äôt showing protests large contributing factor increase. Aim ire idiots can‚Äôt stop partying couple months. airlines fucked, would rather fail? Well reads like 2 million tested realize actual number cases 10 times that.. .05% thats 2 million deaths horizon. death rate lower would lower areas accurate testing. Like Korea Japan.. Germany Italy .05 % greater death rates. thing way worse anyone realized bodies stacking prove it. Beautiful Finger Lakes. 

Theirs lots tourists safe. 

It pretty dry month, waterfalls kind dry, much history here. Well that‚Äôs barely majority it‚Äôs start!  problem people want positive change also ones wise enough look history see successful violent revolutions pretty rare, usually get something worse started takes decades actually get better, time loads innocent people die, we're kind trying avoid that.

There plenty things enjoy outside monster leaving house. one results modeling mortality rate jumping 2% 95%? let fool you. Im Houston people streets wearing masks. Nobody following guidelines. Threat Level Midnight. link spikes protests? Translation: ""Sigh. Murrica gonna Murrica."" go: think one freshest versions ""American conspiracosm"". Stay away disease infested Southerners. Come back states gotten shit together. Yes watched guy sneeze walking grocery store full without covering anything. watched snot spit fly face good 2-3 feet easily 12 feet away time. got back car left. No. number days thing. Well, that‚Äôs entirely true. Best practices suggest 14 days quarantine time concerned spreading disease. difficulty disease broad range severity duration. people fine 14 days. Yes, were. There's LOT denialism though. Here's overview post it: mix, part people wearing correctly now. Right, mean article USA Today links several sources  Either another example headlines polls full bullshit. equivalent trying put fire garden hose, spigot mile away takes minutes change pressure turn water. FINALLY somebody acknowledges failure of**social distancing** still major keep **6 feet** others. cloth face cover **not substitute** social distancing.

There reason *every* crowded mass gathering condemned, outright banned. feels especially hard emotional eater. pandemic add stressors, eliminated several healthy outlets me. Maybe polling numbers. That's probably biggest motivator. right really focusing protests nothing blame knew would. Honestly terrible optics, whatever wanted achieve could done pandemic launching massive protests *right now* done muddy waters. crazy talk abolishing police nationwide gave trump talking points needs keep voters convinced need him. would anyone get help pandemic already bottom barrel? would help poorest poor give money richest rich?


yes would get additional help working? I'm assuming receiving benefits pandemic, otherwise would living? benefits magically turned pandemic. fact, food stamps gotten boost. 


honestly dude seems super ignorant matter probably need read something posting complete bullshit. people dumber thought possible. people. order Trump minions wear mask well? course That's problem, remote learning gone well all. taxing parents overall effective. Day cares remained open I've seen, gone ok far day care outbreaks. easy answer. can't generation kids skip year learning, set back least year half educationally knows developmentally. consequences extended lockdowns unfortunately. extremely difficult situation needs figured shutting door school year answer. Yeah, don‚Äôt think things went top either. looking Northern Italy towns death rates 11%. Granted towns everyone older. Small northern Italy towns aren‚Äôt exactly youthful. 

But warnings legitimate real. remember NYTimes snuck Wuhan interview sick individuals sitting park IV bags hung trees. 

How quickly forget bad thing decimated certain places early days. knew nothing. didn‚Äôt drugs actually worked it. didn‚Äôt enough ICU beds vents. 

Hell anything, Houston running ICU beds tell you. Maybe didn‚Äôt take room serious enough. 

Lockdown bought us time. Unfortunately, wasted time part. time ramp n95 masks didn‚Äôt, example. 

It‚Äôs overreacting take precaution don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs overreacting take precaution know. know it‚Äôs spread airborne droplets, perhaps washing groceries overreaction. back February/March? No. idea thing spread. think concern also staff people think going Florida fun good idea right now?

They think. Tell small business killed


Most want things go back normal pretty spot either way. come land terrible jagoffs. needed place shorter commutes. 

come florida brother said. 

you walk everywhere, brother said.


down wild change pace. overall, can't complain. know i'm yankee. try stay trouble useful. ever followed wrestling know ruthless behind scenes. Read autobiographies former wrestlers. tell all. portray Vinnie Mac good guy.

It's cash. Unless everyone put mandatory quarantine entity state county continue. Everyone diagnosed perform show go on. De Santis worse Trump, Abbott, Kemp combined.

He's real, ship guy. Covid affects like expectancy, similar cancer research. Thanks sharing! also chose use service dogs example, glad wasn‚Äôt way base there. americans stupid agree potus... seriously can't stand here, would one countries even want come beyond me. one thing hate British study. one read damn *summary*. says opening page something like ‚ÄúIf nothing done, could bad X.‚Äù got pointed extreme pessimism made fun of. Imagine much better would people looked images coming China Italy realized CDC must wrong. It‚Äôs also US bunch people waiting knowing government tell instead thinking themselves... it‚Äôs pathetic Hmm. Worldometers‚Äô last days logs say also include positive results antibodies tests different state, last month wife‚Äôs hospital expanded icu. I‚Äôd bet others worked expand too. Exactly. slow spread much manageable becomes much easier protect vulnerable.

Think it.

One two cases pop neighborhood, vulnerable people stay home. hundred cases pop overnight, vulnerable might already infected destined already overcrowded hospitals. Mortality sky rockets. Lol  first time life, happy living feel safe compared states dunno, lot vents country they're easier move around beds patients. they're used often, people go ICU need intensive care them. think we'd run beds first. I‚Äôve seen indoor reopenings nobody know going them. I‚Äôm certainly not. We‚Äôre going dinner first time since February made sure able seated outside made reservation. initial lockdown meant buy us time for. Clearly people running world Cuomo DeBlasio, Trump.

Not bigot like would understand that. someone legitimately can't wear mask, fine. Face shields thing. long keep wastewater samples laying around? Ipsos shared methodology published poll, found bottom page +/- 4.7% 95% confidence interval, sampling USPS Delivery Sequence File database. also weighted responses based Age, Gender, Ethnicity, Education Level, Census region, Metropolitan Status, HHI, Party Identification.

That lot variables incorporate weighting sample 579 households, could handful responses got lot weight poll (it's tough know absolutely without know counts households across weighting segments). also inevitably going response bias, like poll. doesnt bet counting usually do. couple weeks back suppressing case count, look like hump. Oh good wearing facemasks helping reduce spread...now keep mine off. Thank friend. Please stay safe. guy. Omg. seriously idea what's coming he?. Yeah use cotton mask go grocery store, keep neck gaiter around neck pull I'm outdoors get close people. Seems working alright. think see 2 major changes. First, think pandemic drives rush suburbs semi-rural areas. someone living apartment, lack outdoor space drove mad, whereas parents able use large yard keep about. That‚Äôs absolutely crucial going forward.

As living cities, hope gets apartment designers really focus adding balconies apartments allow residents access fresh air ever happens Like everywhere else cities are, go rural hell breaks loose. Bill Gates trying best good vast fortune people crazy think part global conspiracy whatever boogeyman idea want scare people with. ignore dead bodies start piling up

Tell Florida higher usual pneumonia deaths, firing person charge information, arguments nursing homes report deaths... city live (south Brazil) woman killed accident fight old dude security guard guy trying enter supermarket without mask.

In small city south manager stabbed twice guy reason, managed grab gun kill mask guy.

Crazy stuff... simple mask worry, arguments laughable. good fam, catch dumb ideas listening morons.  just, like, put book bag leave alone 4-7 days? Lipid-wrapped RNA stay viable forever. soft. ability endure discomfort country nonexistent. Face masks? Fuck that. Social distancing? Nah, I‚Äôm good. Stay home can? haven‚Äôt months! 

Until federal government real mandated response, keep yo-yo state level. Well, fact coronaviruses, one form another part natural world. 

It humans created enormous fruitful reservoir infection particular form SARS basically cashed paycheck run ball (to mix metaphors).

It like HIV Zika virus, Dengue, Ebola - destroy original reservoir, strain original virus set survive one hops human population. 

This precisely evolution works - fact primates evolve - evolve rapidly, genetic material ever transferred homo sapiens surviving subset extinct subspecies' (the Australopithicines, Homo genus, perhaps others) gene pool. Yeah.

I really need keep job. I'm high risk ability work home right saving life.

Yes. testing enough back then.

Answer question: think caught 50% actual cases per day back May? 90%?


If answered ""no"" default admitting teh actual case numbers higher back numbers reported.


By expanding testing finding cases even tested 1 month ago. Z Nation?   QUICK! PUT BAND-AID BACK ON! Good them. shut indoor dining too. Twitter best algorithmic conspiracy popularization, gotta hand that. exactly ""reopen economy!"" folks wrong harmful - false dichotomy, reopening prematurely gives worst worlds becuas spikes infections deaths PLUS destroy consumer confidence horrible economy widespread disease instead one those.

With mandatory lockdown preserve concept reopen things may actually safe, thus preserving consumer enthusiasm. mandatory lockdown uniform policies instead piecemeal policies corporate safety theater. waiting consumers get sick overrun hospitals get scared voluntarily stay home harmful path outcome - people staying home going bad idea right now.

I can't help feel imprudent premature reopenings largely done try push people unemployment present statistical GHOST recovery. ""See good numbers are?"" yeah cuz yanked everyone unemployment, they'll work 3 weeks possibly sick boot better position safely reopen March..... wait awhile go straining pat back. surging California, Washington, Ohio. praised early better job tri-state.

You guys reopened like did. we'll see. It‚Äôs already effectively closed. tourists sat home. Lorries beer biscuits heading country. Lower IQs: higher infection rates. Natural selection work people.

It gonna inevitably spread throughout nursing homes. know one extremely careless handling that's got fined.

My nursing home's biggest mistake implementing employees wearing masks first case confirmed mid-April. time, found due testing every single person nearly 20 residents 30 staff it. Masks late. 50 140 residents get it, 20 died. 65 staff got it, 2 died. personally trust random dudes twitter Roman statue profile pic AstraZenica British-Swedish company, American, yes already started agreeing production various countries including US EU Smart. idea many Americans would rush move opened. want craziness lack leadership! let us ask nicely? Spring Break. Everyone went Florida brought back them. That's big reason colleges shut Spring Break told people return. I‚Äôm sorry. deserved better. don‚Äôt owe mother share dna. remember that. took years let go. ask, know rates death intubated covid patients looking like days? 


If remember correctly, beginning 80-90% mortality rate Covid+ got intubated, double normal death rate intubated patients ARDS. whether got details right, ventilator mortality rate come much? mean, would bet localities USA strictly enforce nudity laws. acting unconstitutional manner? People understand concept things greater good health community.  almost sociopathic nature.  something really needs addressed pandemic attitudes showing truly destructive functioning society. FYI, guy arguing r /conspiracy user. keep mind reading crazy shit he's saying. certainly nothing elderly boomers using multiple bedroom homes sitting rooms vacant retirement nest egg getting angry one's buying exorbitant prices. No, nothing that. embarrassing American. Yikes new campaign slogan? turns asymptomatic thing.

I'm sure effective simple prayer /s. sure im sarcasm thing right. Lol Seems like that‚Äôs true matter disease puts ventilator. It‚Äôs really tool last resort. 

My father-in-law put vent pneumonia year ago doctors basically told us say good byes good chance would die. pulled thankfully certainly felt like end. Considering past performances Coronavirus Task Force meetings, probably good thing president appear. absence exponentially increases chance good information disseminated, rather unscientific notions masks usage disinfectants vivo. Politicians can't trusted distrust one fundamental necessities functional democracy. soon people blindly support politician, falls apart.

Props girlfriend hope guys continue stay healthy! mean 'amplified'? Non-Americans done nothing trying convince Americans retarded premature reopening was. Scandinavian countries (well, maybe Sweden right now) objectively better us factors listed above. like idea positive enjoying have, we're blindly, zealously positive, burning problems social justice, healthcare disparities, environmental degradation, crushing poverty student loan debt medical bills (my current problem even issue developed countries) get fixed. think embrace good, also mad hell bad fight make things better. saw post ago saying protests basically attributed nothing spikes corona virus cases around U.S

Sounds like politically motivated post. Thousands closed spaces screaming yelling isnt dangerous 100 outdoor pool party brings nothing death

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Ironically small business owners really make money never stopped working whole time. complained bitched couldn‚Äôt go restaurants, bars, gyms etc wasn‚Äôt even money them. childish needs immediate gratification. basically telling ventilator put mother might caused death?

I'm cursing foul sailor language right now. turns true?

All good feelings towards Upper Chesapeake Medical Center going gone going put 'to sued' list.

For fuck's sake... cannot kill people simply scared viral aerosol. End discussion. Chicago absolutely true.  Hmm... almost every country local authorities negated covered virus problem grew heads. standard repertoire humans pandemic.

What also cast doubt numbers export cases suggesting far higher numbers. know thats high number asymptomatics never tested (like country).

The Chinese wrote Nature paper. testing before. Look stats. Sure, announced hospital. Otherwise it‚Äôs his/her job line. reckon part people pretending young people go back terrible low-paid jobs. They're forced economic reality, blamed do.

Still, would expect nothing less leadership country. one greatest shitshows I've ever seen. love phrase. fantastically put. Florida's self-inflicted, least inflicted governor. million time next year separates bar restaurant? bar sells

Fauci warns outbreaks South West spread across U.S.: extreme, recommend arrive sanitize absolutely everything brought (and mean everything) isolating section house completely cut possible 2 weeks least. already late uh oh, someone busy huffing glue got exponents grade 5 Yes, good point. sheer stubborn mentality lot Mississippians harkens back dated medical superstitions good, old-fashioned pig-headedness decries much modern science going fuck state red zone, like southern neighbors. 

While I'm glad relatively low population numbers counties far keeping things manageable, comparative developed states, sightless disease last much longer most. children parents soon pumped like party balloons ventilators hospitals, realize reckless behavior is. 

We already scare household grandmother tested Covid, bored, retired father needlessly public daily, inside home, unmasked, day two before. went horrible night limbo current health potential family tragedy, awaiting results, would need tested next. Fortunately case flu. felt dodged bullet. father back home next day. üò© simply true. 

There always anomolies, majority studies show black black, one bit grey make white. Ppl care anymore. die die. give horse mask dont mean they're gonna put on. say literally everything I've heard Chile, including friends lived temporarily, seems like insanely cool country filled reasonable fun people? Cool, like 4 months ago. Good one, everyone. Lovely team work. Crushed it. Yeah, I'm afraid law enforcement going much deterrent. (Promask/profreeDUM) can't running around handing mask citations.
Here great idea though. call project ""protect me"" ordinary citizens reporting others. someone shop w/o mask, person report them. like reporting drunk driving. Florida already shutting back down. Again. think moved fast first, clue tell you. types exactly bastions critical thought font factual knowledge. actually trying convince choice wearing mask correct one. 24 hours know seeing 5-10 day turn arounds Yeah, Canada there's actual direction federal contradict every couple days. Imagine Trudeau told provinces deal little assistance fed. Nah perverts think man become woman call ""woke"". r/orangecounty Listen good authority many redditors it‚Äôs impossible get CV outside, fine, I'd say nation suffering consequences collective inaction 2016 Huh? factor in? There‚Äôs going second wave...or wave all. long. Slow. Burn. We‚Äôre already past 100k lives good percentage older people. I‚Äôm sorry think something works older people first since ones extreme high risk. Hell haven‚Äôt seen dad 3 months stage 4 cancer. three states leading pack; Florida, Arizona, Texas positive % rates upwards 25% last week so. result increased testing.

And deaths generally lag 2-3 weeks. We've started hitting real growth last week. Check back couple weeks.

Of course, I'm sure new talking points then. sure you‚Äôre honest providing full context?

Cause know truth director prompted reporter pontificate worst possible scenario could sensationalize news.

Your articles repeatedly mention isn‚Äôt projected model worst case scenario.

Far right extremists taken sensationalist article context - go around persuading others hiding fact isn‚Äôt projected model worst case scenario everything else also goes shit, including wars, conflicts, oil prices, etc get worse things expected ... And, really hate say it, state's color. Arizona red reopened. People want stay reopened. Governor said us covered, even though one highest numbers spiking cases, mandate masks consider rolling back reopening, including casinos! people want. least red voters. 

I usually lump people red/blue groups, case obvious thing simply can't overlook it. pretty major long lasting fever for... couple years back. unbelievable much distorts things. worst spent day bed barely able move wracked nightmarish, vivid fever dreams left lasting sense despair. time warping effect get drugs feels like seconds last hours. feel like spent years hell bed.

Of course, would assume nurses familiar fevers know effects. Maybe there's element panic caught *the* virus. sure hope there's lasting mental effects. dream job absolve duty proper job. kind idiocy that? wonder produce garbage products kind attitude America. FYI people aspire working job. overwhelming majority, fact. leave bad? go go go go never ever come back.

Also worry FUCKING loathe too.

PS: know virus serious, browse sub. leftist fucks like make place political. Perhaps, parks open NBA completely different things. NBA players even allowed go parks. would reasonable Disney temporarily postpone reopening parks actually save NBA deal. way, would able deal fewer people overall. bruh really thought reported 1m daily cases lmao recent BLM protests important system racism largely responsible virus decimating minority communities. already are, mean...?  I'm sure **should** enforce things they're simply asked many things. think government always use violence way reaching policy objectives best way reach them.

For one, discretion stop people wearing masks could easily extend police harassment disproportionately applied. happens people forcefully refuse still? violence get used? guns get drawn? hard data 'parties'? real im state low cases kinda hope shutdown since treated like shit essential employee acted like owed giving work could refused work go unemployment like everybody else  Well around subreddit month ago post made top page explained yourself. They‚Äôve already made 2 billion doses stop trying stress us Pulmonary fibrosis totally fine. hospitalized months totally fine. big deal. happens many cases enough hospital beds? Florida economy going be? think anyone going visit state growing cases hospital beds? Apple closed Florida stores. It‚Äôs called reality. Stores close, tourists won‚Äôt come, people lifelong health effects medical debt. Good know that‚Äôs big deal. middle class need emergency fund unemployment plus $600 week. Everyone know furloughed making hand. People can't fucking entertain anymore. extra free time I'd finally read books I've putting forever.

The people suffering lower class can't get unemployment. honestly retail places hiring accommodate middle class people spending extra money. Fuck going hardware store now, wait forever get buy shit work. I'm Harris County (Pasadena, TX) honestly tell ya' people give shit guidelines. 

Restaurants overly crowded new people coming sit close table already seated restaurant anything ""We can't tell move"".

We got alert phones yet tell fact people gathering like everything normal isn't. 

Texas completely fucked atm unless start charging people going directly store buy supplies. Honestly... point care kill families. impact strangers care about. There‚Äôs nothing funny gay people...but closeted gay evangelicals kinda hilarious deserve gentle poking fun come senses. Point is, nothing wrong, carry on.  major disaster, FEMA, federal agency, would normally get involved. However, someone knows experts, plans existed prior 20 Jan 17 canned, nothing replaced them, strategy replaced them. Came say this. Would nice see Churchill getting due. Well might well get roll TP stores go empty again. hell things still open? wonder US covid spiraling control new case counts nationally keep reaching new highs.


In Canada things closed months, amount covid19 cases feel drastically point keeps setting new lows new cases bars, restaurants, etc opening back (with capacity restrictions course employees wearing masks even though customers don't).

I guess NY got message sounds like rest US digging hole deeper. worst possible leadership! dont get opinions non-experts newsworthy It‚Äôs bizarre people still want everything shut down. understand taking precautions like wearing masks, it‚Äôs shutdown don‚Äôt like. Don‚Äôt people put food table somehow? can‚Äôt without working Don‚Äôt worry, nothing done Nick‚Äôs Texas sized 10-4 Fuck that. don‚Äôt know word use instead ‚Äúglad‚Äù wrong word implies happy something instead furious it‚Äôs gone far. absolutely data backing decision reopen early. enough data backing bad idea. 

Instead proactive, listening science, paying attention places around world hit hard, state leaders decided saddle Trump GOP, cave demands utter morons. 

Now we‚Äôre levels disaster never needed happen. people actually taking serious months ago take serious several months dip shits ignored evidence fucktards get drink on, ignore masks, shop, selfish people guise fighting group freedoms fighting personal freedoms cost everyone else‚Äôs. 

Damn straight something now. it‚Äôs gotten much worse anyone functioning brain could see going get worse. don‚Äôt get luxury pleased decision FINALLY act desperation. Fuck fuck anyone valued bar/restaurant/tubing time functioning, healthier society. I‚Äôm furious. Never let forget rest us selfishness destroyed lives, businesses, immediate future well-being neighbors. Canada needs keep borders America closed America stops behaving like bunch spoiled little brats won‚Äôt listen science. world watching America become shithole president keeps calling countries. going happen US again? First go always TP cleaning supplies *rolls eyes* Yeah.. I'm glad they're dumber thought Nope. hotels. killed mayonnaise diamonds

(and thanks that) think that's bit unfair. Every single forum turn alt-right cesspool unless strict moderation criminalizes wrongthink. I'll let draw conclusions Rick &amp; Morty covered fairly well. That's debatable Worldometers wikipedia (and little math). Gee, wonder why.... England US, brothers everything. I'm sure transmitted packaging. People factories handle grocery store food stockers touch it. I've refused get take fast food since March. 
After working fast food 3 years know never change gloves they're supposed to. Go bathroom touch food GLOVES, touch phone food. lot restaurant workers around area wearing masks. national highest day week. south beat north. Congrats. Every major us city plenty homeless. You‚Äôd insulated burbs miss it. Pshh, experts clearly clueless /s HIV isnt transmittable standing next someone infected, also research meds fight HIV. Bad comparison.  isn‚Äôt consumers. They‚Äôre saying can‚Äôt get items grocery store. 

Read article headline misleading. Honest question, NBA MLB actually going play? season start, game one someone tests positive. quarantine whole team. get work wearing mask 8 hours, instead safely house.

Same, bud. Sorry hear that. Hope work many boomers do. underestimate house mouse! lol stay state, follow shelter place covering mouth. 

A majority cases across country seeded New York New Jersey, taken advice. like Cuomo rush shut state nerve say federal government quarantining state would act states' rights nonsense. leaders going eventually reap sow citizens end sowing. Doubtful imo, death rate 1/20 ""Aren't beautiful folks? said, 'do em gold!' said me, 'ahhh surrrr, gold extremely soft metal, put soldiers lives risk' said, 'maybe job risk nerd. fingered 10 without paying believe it... mean, paid guy drug her, get it'. say room generals, say trump smarter, bravest even saying?"" hell say. Go store you‚Äôll hard pressed find 50% wearing mask. Anyone else experience opposite? actually lost weight (unintentionally) due making nearly 100% meals home, access free junk food work. :\ Yeah, pretty fucking sad surprised. took family private beach house Florida beginning June. hyper-vigilant. Masks always, groceries delivered front door, contact etc. went downtime beach town Friday night pickup take-out. Bars restaurants PACKED. masks. Fucking idiots, them. beginning June start summer. Now, literally two weeks summer started, numbers exponentially spiking. wait till next weeks, going absolute shit-show. Back home county I'm seeing incredible number people suddenly asking online ""how get tested? feeling great"" happen before.

Shit get real. Phase 3 hard predict depends certain number people getting sick. analyze results see placebo vs vaccine groups.

You can't really predict timing phase 3, unfortunately. quick long. unwinnable fight. best learn live running community. signs Tucson Houston airports? Alternatively, travelers could required fill electronic form boarding: 

**Why traveling COVID hotspot today risk rest country?** 

A. forced make impossible decision (for example, spouse suddenly died children another state completely depend you).

B. critical frontline efforts another location.

C. cognitive ability situational awareness understand risking lives others and/or lying risk despite access plenty experts told otherwise. 

D. heard novel coronavirus understand consequences spreading disease, consideration people's lives. Wow really? Jesus. open? job. protect serve. understand. It‚Äôs important failing business die consumed. weak trimmed. Better companies arise. whine people losing jobs remember alternative avoidable deaths. Right now, they‚Äôre keeping pretty hush hush - confirmed cases Renee, Kayla Brixton (nxt talent), producers Adam pierce Jamie Noble.

The word it‚Äôs 30 people company testing positive it‚Äôs likely going go up.

Wondering parents would threaten sue you. Perhaps I'm reading wrong, think World Food Programme (WFP) Executive Director David Beasley warned addition threat posed COVID-19, world faces ‚Äúmultiple famines biblical proportions‚Äù could result 300,000 deaths per day ‚Äî ‚Äúhunger pandemic‚Äù. 

Notice ""could result"" part?  means level fear \*might\* happen, saying ""will die"". Globally.

Also, no, \*we\* talking American deaths. \*You\* introduced possible global deaths.  Definitely tragedy, thread American lockdown, American deaths. 

Yeah, governor made things worse, clean hands situation. I'm fuzzy whole wave thing. defines beginning end wave wow know wave really over, especially know percentage population exposed? Come fuck man. Oof. Live close-ish yeah, it‚Äôs bad right now. Yes, find climate deniers annoying. type people opinion set concrete that, matter evidence put front matter many times told argument myopic, short sighted entirely biased towards pushing personal / political agenda, still manage keep chewing bone chasing tails like crazy dogs. 

It's rather frusrating, it, sweetie? Unless 70% people take heed wear masks, impossible police. recall pooper scooper law went effect NYC, everyone thought 'well, enforce it.' practice, turned need everyone fully accepted it--probably 90% enough bring others along without necessity policing. know something don‚Äôt maybe lol Bbbbut numbers /s they're huge numbers infections too. get it. Like one wants go on, wear mask get control things get back somewhat normal? crazy people going destroy lives beyond infect; businesses close good, people losing jobs homes everything people selfish wear masks Typhoid Mary isn‚Äôt alliterative. feel original nickname keeping. literally said ""there important things living"" referring economy. 2020 - year hindsight Florida woman won‚Äôt happy big? way, way bigger Nah, testing sure indicate cases, therefore less testing logical best strategy...

/s Reopening issue. wearing mask social distancing is! Maybe ICU? specified US, get bent shape someone responds using America metric? cancelled dentist appointment today worries. risky undergoing dental work? I've three past two weeks already. I'm talking root canal, crown extraction. someone NYC, realize Infection Death rates trail action 14 days.

NYS peak numbers already lockdown month ... another month two lockdown (depending state).

Their numbers going blow water. 2020 ultimate hindsight. 

It even wait us look back coming us Smh thinking using heads That‚Äôs paddlin.  Government implemented [movement control early on. Perhaps, fly instead regard, people traveling states breaks would anyway. :shrug: kind policy would flimsy best.

It's feasible worth resources. finished week 2 layoff/lockdown back April 

so good Still safe either way :) it‚Äôs good know yet grandparents parents saying protests causing current spike. hope them. chilling shit. wonder paper coming now, covered Friday, large outbreaks sweeping large parts country again, see results mass premature re-openings. don‚Äôt doubt premise article all, rather I‚Äôm curious timing. feels deployed, end I‚Äôm sure. know various bad news virus seemed lag behind time periods infection prevention would critical, that‚Äôs disturbing‚Äî public learns certain things it‚Äôs already late course planning planning. mean think children special needs. many ideas come population. Non compliance normal age group sometimes helps children see friends masks. sure shit NJ. shut mid March things getting control could barely test, also test turn around time averaging 2 weeks. early mid April cases certainly March. last time went Costco mid March precaution wiping cart came in, it. double-fuck Windows 95! quit frontend developer it. think speak us say ""holy fuck"" That's pretty good idea, I'll try find some. Peer pressure work entire fucking state stupid believe Trump Fauci. here, customers come time saying cant wear one 10 minutes it‚Äôs uncomfortable, news it‚Äôs minor inconvenience worst.  Idiots learn hard way unfortunately.  Blaming millennials? Ran excuses? FUCK OFF! think people see people walking street without masks take person doesn‚Äôt wear masks. they‚Äôre needed you‚Äôre outside yourself. long you‚Äôre wearing indoors. stores. work. Idk think hearing minority country scream masks end world it‚Äôs representative whole country hope don‚Äôt fall trap believing is. better though. must better. Tuesday so. Disantis pull Abbott crap say cities can‚Äôt harsher rules state. look countries actually gotten thing control, you‚Äôre 100% spot EXACTLY protocols they‚Äôve followed squash it. 

* Stop incoming infections (IE close borders)

* Masks all

* Aggressive testing contact tracing cases come positive 

* Instant 14 day quarantine positive cases everyone they‚Äôve come contact with. 

It works. I‚Äôm sure choose follow guidelines instead fuck around/ignore areas verge collapse it‚Äôs outrageous. We‚Äôve made thing much worse ever be, make even worse everyday. OC, mask compliant place I've weed shop street. Always masked gloved staff, 6ft social distance, standing guard temperature checks. predicted Trump's win even announced. Nice worry, judging see, everyone else did, too! Apparently God's ... well ... bit dick. Also, halt flights FL somehow block vehicles Florida license plates. dude said. really old post Well, unfair countries testing 

About 17 countries Europe tested Sweden, long before. (I include small countries Russia Belarus - althought testing rate much suspicious death rate) reopening people hate, ignorant reopening always bound cause closures again. would plan extended furlough you. Right vote worse, evidently reach age, matter hard try, someone younger going know people want better you. 

And know what, might even right good ideas, younger people want, go, well I've planet 70 years, know people want.... know people literally went eat yesterday Florida. Elderly people preexisting conditions. don‚Äôt care all. amazing took long explode war COVID, America barely launched assault, let alone established beachhead, far, far, far ""winning"".

When leadership plays Blame Game war, turns back it, literally pretending war's there, defunding prosecution, denouncing science, everything *except* help People Swore Serve....why FUCKING LIVID ?! We‚Äôre reaching breaking point Houston. current rate, we‚Äôll run ICU space within couple weeks. Abbott backing literally option. Restaurants open 50% still seems crazy me. Many people still aren‚Äôt taking seriously, probably won‚Äôt people know dying. Abilene resident here! majority seriously believe it‚Äôs fake made up. us wear masks public assumed sheep. It‚Äôs rather hostile alarming! funny. Surprised pikachu intensifies study explain China would shut downs schools public transportation least care hospitalizations, spike deaths come weeks spike hospitalizations one point 72% Americans favor military force Iraq. counter question is- they? genuinely need wear mask, legitimate reason, STAY FUCK HOME ! called Shielding. need arrange others shopping etc. already local volunteer network available this. Venn diagram circle. Americans. worry Brazil may get #1 spot badly country screw Covid-19 response. I'm glad they're closing those. cases started sky-rocketing influx tourists tubing. One reason almost never leave house! I'm arguing staying open, pointing people going die scenarios financial recession cost lives well. also consider wearing mask part identity American, see young people wearing masks lot. going hit 200 000 new cases today? :( course did. also said community spread Florida one 18 died it. went Trump U. ~5% case mortality, means 2000 deaths day month (statistically, obviously infected today die exact day) like 10% fucking way nationalized.

Rather let 'em go bankrupt. like planes disappear crews die.

Just let someone else buy assets dimes dollar try better business model.

No thing big fail. Rather they're big put life support. next Tuesday, stupidity level 176! seem Florida Texas trending California, higher infection number either states simply true. second wave Beijing one kid getting friend played apartment complex. trying scare/force government buying middle seats? Like United threatened start mass layoffs government bail out? Problem Florida already started decrease testing per day...so chance actually show 15k tests going down. day check sub hoping good news day slowly gets worse worse. like watching pea sized snowball slowly morph massive avalanche. asthma wear mask! Middle first page daily: Unfortunately there's large segment American population take seriously affects personally. like every single possible issue could imagine coronavirus. would wish anyone taking seriously, would absolutely wish upon every single covid-19 denier otherwise they'll never learn. also ruled Cuomo de Blasio cannot treat houses worship differently businesses

So churches taxed business? like extreme poverty brought decline automotive industry economy based current lack sort coherent modern society due lack resources caused decline. Oh wait wait wait, hold one second ... virus suppose something stand to, defy, like going public places wearing mask???? ... going rooten tooten gusto Texas ... microfiche dewey decimal system, better yet, CARD CATALOGS! Wow, that's almost bad worst day NY... virus cause massive &amp; lasting damage survivors... it‚Äôs truly deaths worried about. 1%

32%

64%

You fucked%

That's covid moves. try telling leaders can't even count. Texas something made sell cowboy merch internationally. bodies start piling street maybe people start wearing masks. Actually mine outright already. Let tell nice worried economy. Yep. excellent preliminary indicator whether increased cases coming increased testing vs. increased spread number serious / critical cases. number, unfortunately, headed wrong direction recently, first time several weeks. that, plus base hospitalization numbers, put end ""it's increased testing!"" argument. sure post means.

If enjoying life backyard packed beach, responsible one? makes one staying home go infect get infected narcissist?  reality younger years child‚Äôs life much impactful become adult latter years. Things happen you‚Äôre three year old larger impact view world things happen you‚Äôre 13.

Why call ‚Äúformative years‚Äù.

Trying minimize offset impact young kids taking long term view matter.  federal government may exert power states variety ways; mainly cut funding. Without looking (so take grain salt), consensus reached across state lines drinking age (and perhaps speed limits?). Someone correct me, wont mind!

Correct. believe Reagan administration Congress conditioned federal highway funding states willingness raise legal drinking age 21. legal challenge conditioning federal funds manner, Supreme Court held it‚Äôs constitutional. sure true numbers huge situation looks bad truthfully must take account amount testing. increased testing expose especially milder cases worse cases seek treatment before. critical metrics hospital bed use, ICU patients deaths.

Oh, trouble Florida stopped repoting amount ICU patients couple days ago. yeah, bad situation, case number best metric. ever TMC? welcome look /r/COVID19/ , plenty antibody sorological surveys posted there.
The CDC posted numbers linked.

In anything antibody surveys show lower bound infections two reasons:
1. people develop antibodies
2. Antibodies may fade away people 2-3 months

If want disregard facts fit view - ok recommended.   No. die, die. 
 
It matter virus. Thank fuck clung onto old tiny clothes high school 10 years ago. Nothing else fits lol. went 3 meals day 1 order conserve. I‚Äôm broke. Abs Rona. feel comfortable living house lost way? That's truly evil vulture energy. first time, though. would different now? Pool testing works limited spark like beijing expect 200 2 million tests positive, expect 200k positives Yet Florida, governor says it‚Äôs totally people decide whether go won‚Äôt closing anything ever. Crazy stuff. substantial number people contract disease experience symptoms. CDC says total number cases may 10 times higher what's reported. That's millions people lives affected measurable way. 1000 upvotes you. Many us saw coming far away. opposed current public strategy ‚Äì hasn‚Äôt backfired all. Sounds like job *a* federal government. one. Federal Emergency Management Agency memo obtained ABC News, hospitals Montgomery, Tuscaloosa Birmingham transferring patients facility facility running ICU beds. Hi, I'd like know bit antibody testing community, provide education reliability test results (i.e. probability false positive low prevelance areas)? able disclose percentage tests come back negative? interested percentage people think Covid actually right. ok possibly lung damage rest life? wonder researchers classifying coronavirus. also read somewhere COVID affects cardiovascular system. love people complain wearing mask go back neighborhoods get trouble leaving trash cans late tree grow certain height. want thank posting article, reading comments provided good half entertainment. didn‚Äôt say let‚Äôs act like US China comparable I'm sure know enough virus know that's common not. first saw seriously ill, one outside country could get tested. chance study people mild/moderate symptoms long term. fault. devil it! 

He described 53-year-old man diabetes hasn‚Äôt maintained good health habits since left Navy.

He said dry cough since March, recent days worsened expanded include headache, fever loss focus one eye. 

That's bad fake virus! Trump Making America Great Again! simply statistic plans.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

/s neither. doesnt matter point im homeless/catch virus anyway fuck it.....my time almost up..... Even New York big deal, saw messages predominantly software engineering forums people New York claiming already blown big deal.

The idiots everywhere numerous. would go reach conclusion. AIDS already this. TB already this. Covid AIDS TB, know viruses bacteria exactly that, break slowly multiple months. took two 80+ year old people comorbidities possibly 32 days exposure first die Diamond Princess ship, one highest viral load scenarios date chock full old people, assuming catch virus boarding. ample evidence old people fall severely ill die much quicker younger healthier people. virus takes possibly month kill two compromised 80+ year olds super high viral load scenario can't call nutcase entertaining possibility would take several times longer break younger healthier people. ¬†( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)¬† one wants look like barbarian, long barber client wears mask risk low, Dubai controlled virus reopened mostly. Got haircut done today along nails facial. see actual impact spike least couple weeks...

That's problem ignoring case count looking hospitalizations deaths: they're trailing indicators, useful tool predict case count. Yep.  used example 2 house parties? NPR good source tracking Well, mean already know certain groups manipulating people social media. even conspiracy. going stop people leaving county going another nearby one go eat get nails/ hair done. 

Unfortunately nothing type deal. Shut down, leave open. inbetween cause spread rest california.  think catastrophe mean entire immediate family becomes ill, half wind hospital one two dies, survivors suddenly deal scarred lungs neurological problems years afterwards. Otherwise detached reality scope difficult understand. Here‚Äôs true story. mask broke about. happens cases? hey least get get killed school nice. Sweden knows mistake... harrass minority communities even already do. really think giving cops large financial incentive strictly enforcing law like would help anything current climate? comment 30-45 year olds, quite quarantining older population. also anecdotal news hospital/physicians. might diabetes/smoker's lung/other illness would make vulnerable.

Some publish studies suggest nearly kind permanent damage, course degrees vary widely. It‚Äôs unreal different rest state NoVA. get past Manassas, confederate flags banjos come out. oh yes. due intelligence, asthma paranoia.


what's intelligent use pillowcase hepa cotton sheet underneath. covers way area mask gives breathing room.


i'm also lots research treatment. look maths+. get input physicians can.


also avoid going anywhere remotely crowded, i've decades.


i stocked various sanitzers even started. toilet paper fools.


changed filters hepa house.


don't use communal kitchen shower.


i've went weird weider. stupid? dunno. majority workplace think so, question anything. Philly, one coworkers returns family vacation Florida next week. Dude's gonna pariah. Perhaps ask boss making work home two weeks. self-absorbed? really hard care things outside small bubbles personal contact. Yup lot ignorance texas people severely ignorant comes hygiene. Stupid adult child's throw tantrums can't listen medical experts . UK least, generally apartments mechanically ventilated naturally ventilated. high end apartment blocks house's mechanical systems generally ventilated stand alone independent systems per apartment. also typically case hotels sometimes see centralised extract systems pull room extraction air concern. 

More issue apartment buildings plumbing system cases Hong Kong Sars virus distributed apartment block via sewerage drainage system. imagine could issue poorly designed systems trap might become dry allow particles cross contaminate apartments apartment.

The biggest concern moment air conditioning commercial buildings likely circulate air around large area different zones. tons anti-covid-regulation protests around world.

Your media keeps seeing them.

Which interesting. 'passangers' embark ship there? Much rest first world months. China testing whole cities.

The real question hell US beginning. must real smart nobody would predicted scenario /s don‚Äôt herd immunity influenza. Many people catch year. 

Just know, catch version influenza, build antibodies it. problem 200+ variations it, get sick 200+ times. covid-19 mutates covid-20a covid-20b, could see multiple waves happen vaccine them. Bruh shut overdramatic ass up. Softer Charmin. I've already it, friends it. Worse symptoms they've mild like flu symptoms. Grow pair must something water    seeing America's system federalism fail. impossible make sort national emergency laws, states much power, they're often competing other.

In alternate universe Barack Obama president Coronavirus, things America would better president promoting mask use.

But would see half states threatening secede country national mask law put place. im wondering lawsuits tossed around en masse people go work. Good thing he's chrge   Seriously, friends 50 age group take seriously all. says contract tracing points house parties vector transmission rather protests, solidifying already know masks outdoor/indoor transmission. idiots prefer they're noses Trump's ass rather take science seriously held accountable deaths state! Covid-19 lead Pneumonia, like respiratory infection.

There‚Äôs probably fair number doctors put Pneumonia cause death unaware patient COVID, didn‚Äôt bother testing corpse.

However... since there‚Äôs explanation give... bad actors definitely going go crazy manipulate reported numbers. Testing best indicator future hospitalisations. allows prepare, judge resources needed measure success combating community spread. Friendship coronavirus ended, police officers best friend. Yup. absolutely 0 action they‚Äôve taken robospam callers, it‚Äôs impossible know contact tracer calling not. get potential spam calls everyday, don‚Äôt time listen all. vive la France?  Apparently houghts p rayers considered incivility sub?!? Man love posados guys think back 3k dead day soon? long Wisconsin‚Äôs bars open now? Surely winter come Yes, remains seen Rt sweeps younger, social group.

Florida could compared Sweden, except Sweden crowded many highly social activities going on. People naturally stayed home height pandemic... think SE Europe also interesting watch considering second wave, Israel. El Paso - El Paso lawsuit filed Orthodox Jewish Catholic plaintiffs New York (city+state+state AG named defendants) allowed, [and cases participated mass BLM protests gatherings time prohibiting religious gatherings. 

Regardless prioritize issues hand, strictly constitutional perspective, can't ban in-person gatherings one 1A right allowing in-person gatherings another 1A right. 

You technically practice religion without going church like technically protest without gathering streets. government can't allow one prohibiting other. ironically, NYC mayor previously [tried in-person protests said, ‚ÄúAnd look...people want make voices heard, there‚Äôs plenty ways without gathering person.‚Äù

There also issue indoor capacity restrictions different businesses houses worship, judge noted must same.

You read injunction Welcome /r/Coronavirus facts matter people base opinions clickbait headlines there's way stand appeal watched press conference, let sum up:

&amp;#x200B;

* Political spin idiot
* Dr. lady many graphs enough explanation mean
* Dr. Fauci speaking intelligently directly common sense things need do.
* CDC Guy 1 foot politics 1 foot medicine
* Questions idiot Wall in, let infect everyone, hit 100% antibodies, let out. Wait second. trying say people running show stupid? Surely jest, good sir. Right it‚Äôs less 1% can‚Äôt imagine getting even half 20%  I'm sure mass compliance issues this.....  30% hospital beds possible covid. Nobody. anywhere end year never. people like confronted. wonder responded you. Seat belts Uhhh... them? Take pick: NPR, Johns Hopkins, NYT, Fox News... many sources showing maps virus outbreaking. There's way protests increase cases some, time, fact protests outside filled mask wearing people helped ton. 

That said, also extremely clear protests significant part issues we're seeing Texas (and areas) reasons pointed out. Live free die. Same, went gym twice last week. maskes, me. Felt like everyone staring, oh well. havent gone back, doesnt feel safe one wearing masks. thought working mask would pain didnt even notice tbh. wear mask, people! DeSanity needs get mental evaluation done They‚Äôll go money is, US bunch cases, US Eventually turn another h1n1 today, circulates way lower death rate compare initial waves. Well done boobs course. work special needs children. get that. Unfortunately, non compliance young children considered special need isn‚Äôt direct result poor parenting. That‚Äôs I‚Äôm hoping preschool teachers preparing, children needs safely classroom setting again. nothing youth everything culture state. bunch people especially Texas guidelines. live Chicago, bars barely opening today 25% capacity, restaurants open outdoor patio seating. Blame state city set rules link quality source statistics? doubting seen date excess death stats FL yet. China, country actually stop outbreaks, list? I've seen similar articles countries like Germany South Korea they've clusters pop up. like people want countries fail.

Jealousy good look, saying. irrelevant regulations keep flopping back forth open closed. long supposed wait hope -maybe- someday get back business usual? furloughed/laid workers jobs matter. ideal realistic workers sit home, unemployed, indefinitely. Like though? Still waiting president cheeseburger use defense production act get supply chain open necessary testing equipment. funny still somehow possible even though clearly completely incompetent leaders. Well wearing N95s probably SPOKESWOMAN

FOR COMPLAINT DEPARTMENT

IS NAMED KAREN someone justify wearing one prevent user getting sick. selfish be? whole mask thing strange. ppl think acceptable wear one could responsible another's death. look different drinking driving. think wanting responsible potentially killing people would come naturally unfortunately lot selfish people world. rich getting richer care about. pandemic incredibly profitable US especially Trump administration. fucking disgusting. I‚Äôd love see it, problem considering see case maps sure put together regards protests Hello New Jersey, first state statewide mask requirement general public. confirm sky fallen here: down, left right, cats marrying dogs, men marrying women! think Im worried getting complete fool. See actually care others. Unlike you. lot consequences situation simply getting disease. Wait responding asshole like you? game whack-a-mole foreseeable future. worst part could avoided. California real estate prices 1.5% last month. seeing many people panicking. Sales around 46% typed way implied inferred typed above. Reading comprehension fine. going buy homes? We're see surplus supply gonna bring everyones property values it. Disneyland paused state California approved reopen. 

It‚Äôs game chicken neither party wants cancel reopening secretly hopes does. possible mutate less effective strain then? Yup. I've happy people wearing masks around here. Even cars there's absolutely need. ventured far inland whole time, however, that's mask wearing becomes less prevalent. weird, dynamics city attitudes versus rural attitudes. can't stand close care interact people move rural areas. can't bothered caring they'll whatever want, seems. understand people learn attitudes. would also except 'next quarter' place next election. How?

Jeans last like used to! Username checks out?? Attention whore ! Sure Janteloven pan Scandinavian thing. 

But simply true Swedes *most* conformist lot. Danish friend mine likes joke mindless Borg star trek named way many Swedes behave (Borg somewhat common Swedish last name). Swedish friends like complain endlessly phenomenon too. 

This extreme conformity really evident media, esp. one compares Danish press conferences Swedish press conferences. Q&amp;A Danish pressers often downright *uncomfortable* sometimes since press hammers officials hardball questions. Compared Sweden press ask officials softball questions actually became minor scandal [""crazy German"" was, GASP, asking questions aggressive since Done. 

Also term ""borgfred"" [literally: ""castle peace""] *think* mostly Swedish, that's used describe way crisis politicians fall line opposition stops questioning ruling government toes line. Now, international phenomenon extent-- places world see phenomenon degree crisis early on. Swedes took extreme compared neighbors, borgfred took forever crumble Sweden. time start crack, [during party leader debate COVID June 2/3 Nordics already opposition parties successfully get investigations launched ruling government. 

Or course person research, actively encourage everyone read sides topic new them. I've provided start, go make mind feel like it. like medical system. Bummer. want fucking blast, need go Universal Studios Japan Osaka. They're going Super Mario park soon! I‚Äôve loved Dr Campbell whole ordeal end 2021 sounds bit far given completely unprecedented push vaccine; tend believe it‚Äôll sooner rather later given estimates like Winter 2020, Winter 2021. Definitely hopeful thinking think response vaccine researchers serious business American may school shootings, worst poverty rates, extreme capitolism racism, least say, gusto, arent tards planet definitely care others, reason care others definitely they're stupid. vicious cycle 2020. finally put red traffic lights back KCHD Actually yes wife works 2 3 infectious disease drs area. ya Deff follow  cant believe I'm going say this....but ReOpen fucks actually dumber / worse antivaxxers. antivaxxers least acknowledge disease harmful. ReOpeners whole level. 

Also, flu bro...*/this guy. Probably 1000 times. 4 lives now? Take away tax dollars. Actually useful information all. one asked baseless speculation. Try reading question confused. not? probably exactly Disney want announce closure Disneyworld.

Right Disney lost lot money due closures already.

Someone, somewhere probably thinking how, Disney closes Disneyworld, could probably lose NBA deal, huge hunk change would offset lot losses revenue.

(Just guess though) Cant see blindfold hands eyes also youve already scooped eyes spoons. people world stopped caring point. People think problem 70+ years olds rest get bit flu okay. true course, people tend think superficially. man really arrested. He's purposely infecting people turn infect others. False. 

And besides: average age coronavirus patients CA vs FL? Naming companies irrelevant whataboutism numbskull happens testing done media fool yal basic statistical analysis trickery Still quote though. Good thing SVD, DN, etc. exist. Yep - would double twice shelter-in-place order people actually follow. Given leadership political environment, likely even worse.  remember water nice warm downstream power plants Lake Michigan. Absolute SAVAGES Tennessee went 1400 cases one day. New record, second new record week. according Dutch ministry health, hospilization rate around 3,5%. 
source: biggest newspaper today Better hide forever! People fight common sense measures reason must fines.  That‚Äôs Disneyland California. Disney World Florida still track open couple weeks. ashamed home country. 

What surprise /s per day. never forget forgive people audacity protest pandemic. happened death count 100k. Yeah that's always case comes anything Florida related.

I actually really enjoy going beaches Florida, really hope state rest US recover one day. 44% *highly* concerning, doesn‚Äôt take genius understand dangers crisis 3 year old wears mask. turned 3 month. train them. let kid go outside without weather appropriate clothing don‚Äôt want to? I‚Äôm guessing no. it‚Äôs don‚Äôt go without mask. Nope can‚Äôt go walk without mask. Take mask off, go right home. Keep mask whole time- yay get sticker. knows go out- grabs shoes mask.

Outside special needs, anyone claims kid won‚Äôt wear mask isn‚Äôt trying. Especially reach school age understand why. Guessing. know numbers better weekend forced mid-week. convert non-ICU beds use ICU patients (‚Äúsurge capacity‚Äù protocols), works run non-ICU beds also. think would week two current admission rates they're essential business lol Cool.

  You‚Äôre right, impossible choice. problem really live society make choices like that. many people make choices like time. Things don‚Äôt way, lot resources world. could distribute evenly able provide people need don‚Äôt choose spreading pathogen disproportionately impacts elderly, immune compromised, less fortunate. real problem. Young people less likely die severe case, mean severe cases among young people good outcomes. Permanent lung, kidney, heart damage make good outcome, less-bad-than-dying outcome.

EDIT: Typos high cardio intensive sport like basketball? betcha could be. saw that. crazy. Nevada pretty low cases/ deaths compared states can‚Äôt believe fast open back up. Nah, HCQ will. /s much worse that. people exactly opposite government tell do, muh freedumb It‚Äôs one thing wanting people jump help pandemic initially gets control densely populated region like NYC, expecting risk lives months later people want enjoy freedoms mask-less another thing entirely. 

We learned much past months. also learned stupid people be. Sometimes like utterly ashamed part human race.  made Yuma really bad too.

Now whole part Southwest sent SD Tucson medical care.

Crazy. Thank /u/veryaveragegirl gold! wish true statement given topic... confidence data understated Ample numbers facilities. 

Though agree, go somewhere far less populous far less outbreak stupid fake bubble thing, smart... test, test, test.. problems enough dont care. Ah, interesting. Thank much detailed explanation! USA, person health care worker, concern mine. Nope. months ago.

I learned say anything ever unless facts figures high-governing body, even it‚Äôs something say passing regular conversation. Yup. Politicians next election, people bought pay politicians next quarter. So... time next quarter unless next quarter election. TL/DR people 1600s smarter us Americans terms stopping pandemic doesn't. Previously, heavily tilted toward older people getting infected. current wave seems driven younger people, die often virus.

Let's hope infect many older relatives... face huggers. Great.  ‚ÄúMy gut feeling better 6-10 years training countless years experience dealing sick people.‚Äù

I think movie TV tropes caused this. apparently much ask.. partisan issue human health crisis. 

We need listen talking heads, analyze data, part. 

Maybe won‚Äôt get it, maybe someone know- won‚Äôt get it.. someone encounter MAY give pass someone isn‚Äôt same..

My question is: many people encountered genetic makeup you? 

What don‚Äôt? 

It‚Äôs much US don‚Äôt know links readily available, could please share? see comment thread, I'm trying gather much information topic possible make informed decision two daughters (4 2) school starts back August.

Thank Lmao instead actually right they‚Äôre gonna slowly pull bandaid 3 fucking months slightly increasing measures realizing last increment added wasn‚Äôt quite enough. Idiots. Underrated comment 
MODS PLEASE FIX AUTOMOD SETTINGS - comment keeps getting flagged ""incivility"" why??????

compare theoretical downsides taking seriously vs seriously enough, especially light know 6 months knowing virus.

I would much rather d00mer alternative. One prepare best possible outcome life, that's underpreparing/not preparing all. Possibly conditions school environment related low infection rate. would like know building - like maybe lack central heating/ cooling possibly smaller class sizes , might lead outcome . really don‚Äôt want home school next year. would love terrified school death trap. Fuck WebEx.

Sorry work shitty past 2 days working Cisco's WebEx support kinda made fan Zoom GTM. hope Microsoft make something Teams rivals WebEx. chat program already nicer.

Sorry rant needed type hope great weekend :D Canada: ***No*** can't describe feel schadenfreude. find sympathy hard come by. whole country watched New Yorkers get sick die, watched city grind halt. asked shut things couple months could repair make sense this, got bored, made political, refused stay home, refused wear masks, getting sick dying like New York did.

This want. wish country smarter this, could look went learn mistakes better. are, even country spiraling control. truly beyond belief. seems interested finding small errors material central point argument debating real point argument making. isn‚Äôt productive discourse. Seems like want right. playing trivia want. life death millions aren‚Äôt taking seriously. Yeah Pencil (Pence) saying 250,000 people going dead pretty soon...

Looks like doomers were/are right.

Duh. Question:

I moving high rate city low rate town. parents live town, 60s, going live them. precautions take, even feeling well, make sure there's chance catch could carried me? I'm absolutely terrified passing something asymptomatic. know younger person getting change many opinions probable 35 yr old fully recover. get bad case they'll think another flu totally isn't. Wanna tell us agenda is? One key problems stems electing village idiot lead State FoxNews NRA said so.  feeling US's exit major player world politics dramatic unexpected entrance. probably best, given proved can't handle responsibility. Outside cities, get rural churchfolk. They're every state, they're dumb pile shit. TLDR. 
 
Medical Tape. doubt true many restaurants/businesses. What's point though? air recirculated believe filtered either. One person could infect full plane. look Houston subreddit talking article tell why. people agree things need shut properly majority people dont give fuck. either joke, inconvinience lie them. binged days right around memorial day... eye-opener help anxiety haha. regret nothing! teh LiBz plan transcend primitive desires eat stay warm cold? funding various vaccines research viruses many years lot may see vaccine much earlier usual virus.  done lot move science forward honestly one gives fuck end result going less deaths less suffering.  Hate Gates much want improving situation instead making worse.  really need take long hard look start questioning ended miserable insufferable people hell bent shitting anything everything good. Beach safer anywhere inside sourced every single thing said long-term damage, think understand clicking link works. 

We're discussing pneumonia. relevant? realize that's we're talking about, right? 

If we're adding irrelevant info, like Jello.

The average test death 21 days outside America, number closer 28 days here. shared quite bit, I'll find source that.

I provided peer reviewed study SARS, links NHS reports' findings; going blind links back delusions thing? big thing EU start discussing air bridges kick start tourism. report makes seem like Sweden unsafe country go terms Coronavirus. Sweden 5,000 deaths 65,000 cases. Extrapolated death percentages countries, Sweden 35,000 unidentified cases. might used wrong stat make class Sweden unsafe country classification true. knowing 35,000 cases walking around country bad dangerous. countries quite rightly exclude sweden tourism air bridge prevent re-import virus. 

It really matter Sweden increase cases testing much past been, report figures given country. Sweden country provide accurate figures lack testing, Sweden's fault, WHO. much higher percentage cases days younger population much lower death rate. think seem understand. said, sheep farming intensive spring fall. Apples too. sure else they're growing gotland, two things summer lull. food intensive summer months. Crazy know, hard understand seemingly since already explained once. simple ""when sun warmth plants grow then"" frankly childlike thinking reflect actual complexity different agricultural sectors. 

Also, even intensive periods one find people run farm one's absence. Pretty normal stuff small holders. rate slow we're talking 12000-15000 infections tomorrow. 

In weeks we'll million+ (confirmed) cases Florida alone, death rate even less 2.0% talking 15000-20000 deaths. I'm saying country cant shouldnt strive improvement, Bankrupting entire country isnt going fix actually counter prohibitive one afford anything fix leave long lasting effects economy. maybe get fucking shit together god damn society stop spread ASAP even start school year bit late, safely. probably okay. psychosis, wonder understand Trumps word salad. know everyone says perfect person. brags tens thousands Americans die disgust you. numbers asking about? 3 months prepare Flu season hits- hospitals still capacity going see massive catastrophe unfold. may locking longer first round soon. saying believe bill gates created virus excuse mind control crazy figure we'll record days August? July 4th legacy...

Someone joked yesterday title ""U.S. Sets Daily Record"" true while... senior members team tell horror stories used be. made lots improvements process software make problems less common easily mitigated. 

It gives us better motivation write good code don‚Äôt wake 2am deal problems :) That's conservative, that's called brain dead. get point. canceled July 4th trip PCB.  Bill Gates nanobots 5g towers fake news? Yeah again: let Swedes enter, bar like countries?!  also people still get exponential growth starts slow, looks like happening, slow period growth sudden getting thousands cases day. like lily pond analogy says thing starting sound like viral-induced autoimmune disorder, almost like airborne AIDS. wonder people would finally take seriously starting calling that. Economy nothing decisions made, despite articles constantly bringing like We‚Äôre right there. husband(the sole provider family 6 finish college)was furloughed half May June. Unemployment isn‚Äôt even half normal pay. We‚Äôve taken 3 month relief option mortgage provider one kids broke arm 5 weeks ago, leaving us $3k medical bills. Even mortgage relief, applies principal interest payments. still pay escrow relief property taxes home owners insurance. won‚Äôt sell house bought last recession owe half it‚Äôs worth now, we‚Äôre struggling. furlough won‚Äôt see full paycheck last day July. 

I know people like peg people wishing reopen selfish pricks want haircuts, trying pay bills fees kids. praying company(a global multi-billion dollar company)doesn‚Äôt extend furloughs. sure people would think asshole situation COVID infected person who's quarantining themselves. really, really clear responsible person COVID sufferer putting others danger.

Case 0 argument, Sweden disagree

Those might three common words someone's knows they've lost argument, wants save face make exit. makes instance particularly funny I've argued exclusively based logic know many comments now, one agreed disagree *is yourself*. went get blood drawn lab tests. don‚Äôt insurance, went private, small lab. 

No one wearing masks. 

Luckily told couldn‚Äôt certain one tests find another place, damn surprised. Outside Buenos Aires lockdown getting lifted gradually. Buenos Aires return tight lockdown since cases getting control. Title referring Florida‚Äôs leadership occupants piece land itself. burst covid trutherism today, assuming related similar burst new cases us ""COVID-19 beginning lose virulence coronavirus mutating could die without vaccine, according Prof Matteo Bassetti, Italian infectious diseases specialist.

Prof Bassetti told Telegraph last month, COVID-19 losing virulence patients would earlier died infection recovering. Prof Bassetti, expert critical care, pointed declining trend number cases indicated vaccine longer needed coronavirus could go away permanently.

‚ÄúThe clinical impression virus changing severity,‚Äù Prof Bassetti told Telegraph. ‚ÄúIn March early April patterns completely different.

Now, past four weeks, picture completely changed terms patterns. could lower viral load respiratory tract, probably due genetic mutation virus yet demonstrated scientifically.‚Äù

Prof Bassetti believes reaction human immune system coronavirus causing mutate attributed lower viral load measures lockdown, mask-wearing social distancing.

""Yes, probably could go away completely without vaccine. fewer fewer people infected could end virus dying out,"" said.""  Exactly. Contact tracing works countries like Korea privacy laws changed SARS, technological means so. Meanwhile guys never give information technological means equivalent third world country certain parts US. might interest read [legal definition specific examples describe scenario. Nope Thank providing informed understanding situation helping fellow humans. seems appealing thier sense caring others. many seems fines barring access required, complain about. speak language sticks. Also, seen ""capacity"" lot places? I've seen many restaurants posted capacity something like ""40"" I'm looking around going ""how could possibly fit many people inside Jamba Juice?"" It‚Äôs shoulder pads make head hands look small. 

Wait second. second thought, he‚Äôs wearing dad‚Äôs suit. I'm loop, Texas start taking precautions going back precautions? insane. first time history mad scientists charge government. Utterly ridiculous. Thats know don‚Äôt live socal get corona, get corona. end day, going stop partying. can‚Äôt true, live Portland, swear it‚Äôs like half half. lot people wear see lot don‚Äôt restaurants shit. It‚Äôs absolutely nuts Hell, never worry second wave never get first. Upvote good news. good news - vaccines making progress, less pollution, supply lines pulled China. Remember advances make deaths incurred even tragic, less. Stay vigilant!   ‚ÄúBill Gates sounding smart speaking common sense‚Äù

The bar non-existent problem problem. That's federal response comes in. truth is, redditors saw pandemic coming, US government prepared such. There's silver linings situation. China trustworthy also imagine unwilling tour hospitals medical facilities see situation first hand himself. Evangelicals lying people? shocker. Exactly. epidemiologist, frustrating people laughed downplayed recommendations this. It‚Äôs even frustrating public gets hit hard, like Texas right now, simultaneously asks public health help also blame us increases didn‚Äôt listen first place. Poorly. works poorly. like every move whole administration States made. Everything always turns little, late, relaxing way much, way soon. question increased cases tied process change answered ""Watch what's happening hospitals."" case counts really rising? Hospital data says ""Yes, rising terrifying rate."" bad idea though? I'm actually surprised already. article basically officials saying don‚Äôt rely contact tracing point. Ok wrong thanks correcting Selfish Individualism fucking disaster pandemic crisis like remember taking survey.... Seriously, causes people lost? File ‚Äúit‚Äôll magically go away‚Äù trash can. sounds like wants work trump administration.  10 million confirmed cases worldwide 500,000 died. That‚Äôs 5%.

Similarly within US, 2.5 million confirmed cases 125,000 died... 5%. 

These numbers held steady since outset pandemic, time seen massive increases testing worldwide. 

Certainly, everyone get tested, actual death rate lower. However, unless antibody tests completely spot on, don‚Äôt think say definitively much lower rate would be. I‚Äôve read, they‚Äôre super accurate. 

It‚Äôs possible read outdated, simply haven‚Äôt seen latest studies demonstrate accuracy antibody tests. someone point one that, I‚Äôd appreciative. I‚Äôm going confirmed cases barometer deadly be. thanks! though innocent proven guilty kinda foundation western society.

But hey, discarded freedom, might well discard well. good right? /s Right, can't see winning current President. There's enough vote Biden win. It‚Äôs kind sad decision left businesses municipalities rather state federal leadership. Yeah going idiots keep voting every time?  late. public sick slighted. We‚Äôre still missing cases, maybe even huge majority. Many people won‚Äôt get tested don‚Äôt think don‚Äôt think symptoms serious. Well done, hadn‚Äôt thought angle Disastrous: reelection question. keep **6 feet** others. cloth face cover **not substitute** social distancing.

And really think make impossible take  Education remains key future, online learning insufficient achieve goal. ESSENTIAL utmost classroom instruction fall. accepted fact earlier week strangely it‚Äôs provided ‚Äúplan‚Äù brain needed. 

Yes- I‚Äôve home 15 weeks. 
Yes- I‚Äôm frustrated community idiotic. 
Yes- I‚Äôm outlier hasn‚Äôt rejoined society.

However I‚Äôve practiced enough home time ready big league year home. go... state OH never mandate wear masks. go grocery store less 5% people one on. According logic get near position power behave want, people elected do. last sentence inconsistent rest argument. really. average age cases 33, hospitalization rate much, much, lower small sample size also source research problematic.

160 clients salon catch covid parties wearing mask, account others untested. research keep track close contacts ones sick?

i started reading article well reasonable grouping people. one case study 9 million covid cases, 455 contacts single person. contact tracing would handful.

&amp;#x200B;

""Since Case diagnosed, contacts, including hospital staffs, family members patients, routinely screened.

and presumably many hospital staff masks, visitors patients, remember masks common east even long covid. people trust this? He's computer scientist, biologist. Vegan diets actually worse planet, might want check facts buddy. plane several years live within biking distance work, though economy car. Looks like checked boxes anyway. Got stupid thing add? understand think one side other, ability moderate use things damage Earth's climate. say, much good thing bad thing. usually teach 6th grade, drop out? ever blackout drunk one night stand semi desirable bar skank??

/s Please protect around dont fly. hope feel better soon. I'd rather go back office. Atleast days week. need work/home separation. wearing mask wicked idea Cities decide themselves. Im sure Nowhere, Nebraska doesnt really need abiding people think LA NY"
