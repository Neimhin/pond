Well, next 3 months would counting someone protected vaccine reality I'm make breakthrough numbers 3 months.  breakthrough numbers would eventually trend towards trial numbers given enough time. that's fine - 95% REALLY good. - Tests: 1,211,012 - Cases: 45,265 - Deaths: 362 - Currently Hospitalized: 35,414 - Currently ICU: 7,346 (+/- compared day last week Tests/Cases/Deaths &amp; yesterday Hosp/ICU)

That trial 40,000 people it. think missed opportunity. Even great internationally attracting event (do go never been), could scaled local event closer roots. Could fun. 

I'm Canada event here, Calgary Stampede, basically big rodeo. They're going year I'm sure it'll smaller scale think it'll like ones remember 80's.

first question answered: would someone covid related anxiety avoid indoor dining first even they're vaccinated?

my answer: because, terms risk infection, past year so, effects vaccine rollout, dangerous setting. someone anxiety pretty likely avoid first, probably depending factors like community spread (and hospital pressure) restaurant specifics (say, place widely known caring restrictions past year). even maybe someone household vaxxed yet can't vaxxed. 

i never meant say people done second dose (or Johnson) absolutely partake indoor dining. Thank you. Yeah, must US trial thinking of.

Thanks information! Sounds like authoritarian nightmare - perfect Aussies suppose. Well said! Time export them! fear mongering? headline stating approximate percentage increase. pretty damn dry... I'm young that's still 4% life. understandable want over. Unvaccinated people don’t attend large gatherings either. August choice don’t care happens them. know. wish people would chill fuck get vaccinated already. Happy means get quicker whole San Marino thing hilarious, glad *have to* go stadium, can't really call masks ""harmful"", you? Again, hopefully August enough people vaccinated. Answering first question: Kids low risk COVID, certainly hurt vaccinate them. Anecdotal, I've known probably 30 people 18 catch COVID (none particularly high risk), none lasting effects. Vaccinating also comes benefit making herd immunity come quicker easier. CVS setup stupid unless it’s changed.

When trying get appointments wanted schedule exacting days wife case either us commission day after. 

So pick time don’t tell day. Well heck work? got appointment window assigns day. Well that’s great lot people need definite days especially 2 part vaccine. bet tons get cancelled never scheduled that. K send Canada please. Thanks. could manufactured many countries

Stay safe I've fully vaccinated month dont want go anything. I'm working home dont want commute stand next anyone. going anywhere affected I've gained weight know go dont wat to. I've actually started seek professional help, I'm afraid I'll gain much weight could really mess self up. Yesterday went run errand afterwards sat park ate. nice wound spending several hours there. think COVID anxiety get help late. Good luck get beautiful world regardless gross is. fully agree need accelerate production complete worldwide vaccination effort sooner. disagree IP waiver helps us achieve goal. may sound idealistically attractive paper, discussed real chances increasing probability manufacturing tainted vaccines reducing future research investments, current bottleneck see production requires IP waiver address.

You seem getting angrier frustrated every reply. I’d encourage pause, collect thoughts, compile coherent argument side discussion.

What *specific problem* exists manufacturing pipeline requires forced IP waiver? aren’t partnerships rival manufacturers, kinds forged last six months (Pfizer/Sanofi Novartis, J+J/Merck, AZ/Serum Institute) leverage existing factories better option?

I really want move past insults you’re throwing get specifics think actual problems proposals solve them. unfortunate. UK got pandemic AZ. general consensus people vaccinated hanging haven't? point vaccinated person reluctant hang anyone else unless also vaccinated wondering experts data say. Continuing test safety imply vaccine less safe. continuous safety testing imply rollercoaster put operation prematurely?

Great data. I've already explained misleading use breakthrough data rather trial data./ repeat case simply read first trials showed 95%. can't use breakthrough numbers time delays.  example, lets say fully vaccinated, I'm person protected vaccine. lets say eventually catch COVID 3 months now. Well, next 3 months would counting someone protected vaccine reality I'm make breakthrough numbers 3 months.  breakthrough numbers would eventually trend towards trial numbers given enough time. that's fine - 95% REALLY good.

On top that, various issues testing reporting, etc. simply misleading people use breakthrough data instead trial data, gold-standard controlled, double-blind data. ...the mass vax center near broken up.

“We glad see working countries help meet supply needs,” Jeff Zients, President Joe Biden’s Covid-19 response coordinator, told Bloomberg News statement. said company ahead schedule commitments supply U.S.

The governments Mexico Canada said last week expected begin receiving doses Pfizer’s vaccine U.S., first time company’s American-made shots known delivered buyer American government.

Zients’s statement first indication administration won’t stand way exports Pfizer’s product doesn’t pass hands directly.

Pfizer said statement started exporting U.S.-made vaccine, declined specify countries. “We continue use global supply chain ship vaccine doses governments, delivering commitments ensuring continued reliable equitable rollout,” according statement

Pfizer rose 3% New York trading Monday, vaccine partner, BioNTech SE’s American depositary receipts rose 11%.

Vaccine shortages worldwide spurred countries blocs impose export restrictions, limiting ability manufacturers send product across borders cases.

Early U.S. production wasn’t subject export ban gobbled entirely government, used wartime powers prioritize orders, cornering market domestic production. allowed U.S. race ahead peers, spurred calls distribute doses countries without production. hell children need take vaccine ?? Thanks! employees already got vaccinated? miss pay/time acting early? weary out, period

If vaccinated still true they're ones drinking misinformation.  attribute greed idea here, least directly.

They making much vaccine currently. need future product appeal investors, needed not, boosters look great investors. think need them, think Pfizer Moderna think either. 

We however need investors fund mRNA company investments research vaccines TB, Lyme, Malaria, various STDs, probably universal flu vaccine.

My crazy relative sent family thread, I'm sure even numbers correct (though expect lot correlation vs causation fallacy), small fraction people suffering negative side effects vaccines still far better everyone caught COVID...

Not sure even worth trying, wont change mind regardless... find hard keep mouth shut stuff like this. understand. I’ve working home since March last year rarely gone pandemic. haven’t seen friends family since live state. panicking returning work later week first time year. I'm disputing numbers. I'm thankful it. goddamn lot stupid fucking people wearing masks wonder get sick. T-cell immunity driving bus, extremely robust works differently antibody immunity.

We hear constantly variant evades antibodies, conveniently ignoring variants causing increase cases US right now. kidding me? I've offended smelly flesh bags bacteria clouds years. pandemic recent excuse. Jealous. amazing. really hope that's ""We're better expected right now, let states need these"" kind turn-down ""Vaccine science fake! fraud! Microchips!"" kind turn-down. That’s true:  [an article days saying LA may get yellow tier San Diego does. LA 41 cases San Diego today. find info this? pretty severe allergies varying food pollen medication. Penecyllin nearly killed child. someone also CT numbers don’t lie dude. Lmfao downvoted? word street impending approval 12-15 months bureaucratic wait like one month going do? I’ll rather enthusiastic antivaxxer. use bit less I’ve kept longer hand washing. hands really feel lot cleaner 5 second half-hearted splash dash. also tell people it’s free. lot people wary healthcare general fact ask insurance info turns lot people it. Eh, someone CT intelligence bit...stretched thin.

But again, guess worse states in.  meant. understand wearing sick corona still there, please don’t honestly tell you’re going wearing mask spring summer 2022   Agreed, fortunately main US vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J) said plan apply full authorization. Moderna already has, one hopefully ready next school year. I've doses side effects besides sore arm day.  mean don’t provide full picture? used 1 stat supported position ignored rest. provided full picture form 4 meaningful statistics. 3 4 Iowa outperforming states. didn’t cherry-pick stats like did. think lot people, mask wearing given sense safety little bit control felt like chaotic, risky, unpredictable situation last year half. There's scary killer virus there, least wear mask protect others extent. 

So understand people might think, well, maybe keep wearing it, like feeling security want envision remaining safe secure future. 

But reality, think world returns post-pandemic normal (which going happen regardless social media naysayers), mask mandates eventually discontinued majority people stop wearing regular basis. (Maybe people still wear sick, would consider overall positive.) People need masks feel secure/safe covid anymore think even lot hardcore ""I WEAR MASK REST LIFE"" people quietly put away.

I mean, could wrong, legitimately see significant numbers people continuing mask daily rest lives. get shot camera thought would make look weak. Considering stats COVID children, would be?

Look gas production refinery shut downs US. Strangely. Refineries decide shut slight tick demand vs supply- Senate started looking (strangely- thanks Feinstein). 

In case, would think Chao (McConnels wife) dragged committees. Go 5th paragraph:

“By April, vaccinated individuals, including 37 doctors one New Delhi hospital, found contracted virus, leaving many wonder contagious variant behind second wave.

Many India already assume variant, B.1.617, responsible severity second wave. variant sometimes called “the double mutant,” though name misnomer many mutations two. garnered name one version contains two genetic mutations found difficult-to-control variants.” agree - reaction seems way over-the-top excessive. mean anything possible, significant uptick cases anywhere point get scrutiny genetic analysis, we're flying blind. Same. People here, especially social media, bullies issue. Fucking red rural area. One thing that's interesting breakthrough numbers -- unlucky people still get Covid despite fully vaccinated -- hospitalization (8.8%) death rates (1.7%) seem roughly vaccinated. 

I think striking one prevalent narratives vaccines prevent (or greatly minimize) hospitalizations deaths even breakthrough cases. data seem bear out.  still listen Dr. Osterholm. crazy pessimistic, warms heart. obvious he's caring kind person freaking cute listen old man read lyrics '70s songs brighten day lol. 

But mostly agree Dr. Gandhi (except said first vaccinated people getting drop masks ""fair."" ???????) people? US? Absolutely not. people ? countries? Sure.

The cases I’ve read people became sick second time sicker second time. don’t fuck around people. Get vaccinated even natural infection. Vaccine antibodies superior acquired via natural infection. serious? first paragraph: 

""Scientists say data thin cite reasons behind country’s second wave.""

and then:

""Preliminary evidence suggests variant still responsive vaccines, although slightly less so.""

nevermind fact something like 3% india vaccinated, millions indians gathered political rallies religious reasons, yet somehow blaming variant breaking thru vaccines lol Won’t happen officially approved, emergency authorization. Yes, exactly Florida made illegal require vaccinations reason. understand feels reasons:

* messaging bad even fully vaccinated, told wear masks around *other fully vaccinated* people. theory *safe* around everyone. 

* Heard immunity telling us likely reached-- anti-vaxxers *could* breeding ground mutations new virus variants current vaccine may protect us from... taking us right back square one.

These concerns anyways. Actually you’re wrong point number one, kind stopped there. vaccines incredibly effective stopping covid blocking transmission. You’re wrong mean don’t die stay longer? Yes, families kids fear go out, especially kids health issues. Yes. All-time low 0, year ago. I’m Alberta. I’ve vaccine (first shot anyway) even vaxxed people supposed keep obeying restrictions here. variants wreaking havoc, lot idiots refuse follow health guidelines. US slowing everyone wants got it. empty history ought able see it. get free articles times. Try incognito window - emptying history ought help. Good luck. grocery store N94 mask heard lot coughing. panicked remembered vaccinated calmed down. I’m still thing last year tho. Combine 30 40% population getting vaccine continuing mutate virus. Plus rampant outbreaks countries like India Brazil.

I'm happy go maskless outside unless crowded, inside, I'm keeping mask unless household. least now. advocate forcing people get vaccinated, end big chunk population getting vaccinated take longer go away. true say vaccinated means need concerned significant minority vaccinated long are, choice negatively impact us. subreddit mentally coping pandemic? I’m Europe still lockdown must say fatigue hopelessness real. 

Sorry wrong place post this.  first income bracket around 29-35% depending live, employers pay equivalent fee employee's pre taxed income.

Most things 25% VAT, 12% 6%. 

12 % VAT applies to, example, food, restaurant visits, hotels works art artist sells themselves.

6 % VAT example newspapers, books, taxi, bus, air train travel Sweden, concerts more.

There also additional tax alcohol depending beer, wine, liquor. tax liquor $20/liter, wine $2/liter, beer $0.75/liter. set slightly increase 2023.

There's also even complicated fuel carbon tax, includes tax gasoline type car one Yeah, there's lot made 'spike' still lower lot places baseline while. Hospitals Japan already busy covid indeed, mainly even people minor injury don’t hesitate go see doctors, thanks healthcare insurance system making medical bills real cheap.

However, biggest reason hospitals Japan don’t want to/can’t accept covid patients. Roughly 80% hospitals Japan privately owned, less 10% private hospitals enough medical resources covid. hospitals seem think it’s risky receive covid cases even financial support government. 

[source haven’t thought prove kid 16? need ID honor system like tell Disneyland 2 year old actually 23 months old get free? Moderna still needs get tested. US pay. girls life might shitty vaccine choice take. she'd banned everything shamed dumbass people. easy stupid assholes judge isnt family. 

Anyway people still get shitty companies US government pay anybody severe reaction like this. Anything else unacceptable. I'll never trust doctor long live.  reduce things though, thing I'm pretending cases actually drop nothing. I'm going go hang unvaccinated people indoors unmasked long could potentially contributing problem continued transmission.

But like, that's really hurting quality life avoid. Especially mask part, hot yet uncomfortable yet. problem nuance, understanding science/knowledge unfolds real time? Surely reason way why, CFR 5%+ beginning this, officials estimating deaths millions? first link shows reinfection symptoms 93% protection previous Covid. That’s great. It’s probably bit higher go viruses. second article give four possible explanations city hit again. I’m leaning towards number 1. again, it’s common everyday someone’s got rando story reinfected. It’s nonsense part it’s scare tactics That’s total population. headline says Adults 18+. prove that? last heard immune vaccines 13. depends birthday is. Influenza mutates much faster coronavirus. agree - hesitant young boomers experience wondering point majority deaths folks chose get vaccine first opportunity. question majority deaths folks antivax simply people bothered get it. June suspect majority deaths would preventable vaccine deceased could gotten chose whatever reason. get protection receiving first dose, 2nd? boss wife went visit parents last summer. parents 90s, age never certain long they'll you.

They dedicated safe possible. 2000 mile (one-way) trip Georgia Washington state driving, towing travel trailer. used trailer eating sleeping bathroom, curbside pickup restocking food needed. Took five full days driving way, got see parents little risk possible one got sick. That's good thought, honestly really hope that! probably seek mental help. Slowly surely… want 5 year old bad…. Hoping end year. What's gotcha here? probably wear seatbelt driving since intelligent thing do. also take precautions vaccinated due high community spread around since vaccine 100%. things make great export places extreme poverty, like India, timing vaccine rollout directly translates deaths. would give huge leg end getting vaccine one shot stored cheaper equipment. Would mean quicker deployment time, could good optics played “they need kind/type vaccine do” angle, would prevent many deaths. India 10k deaths day soon enough. Rising cases never match deaths 3/4 weeks later. Half million daily cases = 10k deaths day short weeks. Brutal governmental failure. Wow. That's pretty awesome. think 30% state city fully vaccinated. Ouch! I’m happy Netherlands stop J&amp;J goal still Beginning July first dose. 

On hand, Norway pessimistic prognosis Moderna Pfizer plans give everyone first shot end July, wonder Sweden knows something rest Europe don’t. Thats interesting. something learned/researched, yoymu formally educated subject. judging either way, genuinely curious :). wise take situation. hope many people come conclusion find peace changed reality. union told us vaccinations mandatory staff.

 vaccines required teaching district? curious many hospitalised died past year age range compared flu.  year going anywhere grocery store, doctor's offices, mom's, got two weeks FIRST shot take anymore. went got haircut massage saw movie. waited 2 weeks past second shot lived. places pretty damn deserted too, surprisingly given I'm Georgia though purposefully went times.

3 weeks second shot went 3-day weekend vacation nice milling public, talking people eating restaurants, without overwhelming fear someone going murder covid. people decide themselves, sure. people going go back normal  mean Tennessee top 10 back too. Hahaha saw long lasted. Man, get more! time start licking doorknobs spit-washing squirrels!!!

Kidding, heh. Maybe comfortable easing back society instead jumping back in, nothing wrong that. experts think that's ridiculously pessimistic. That's would take it. Personally think need something write COVID they're writing alternative viewpoints now. walgreens get anyway. There's enough research done showing immunity covid (from actually contracting it) temporary. know immunity covid may already dissipated. vaccine protect better longer. read another reply spike proteins mRNA vaccines produced inside cells cut pieces leave cell presented immune system, even cell gets destroyed intact spike proteins leak much much smaller quantity body would producing full C19 infection real virus, immune system take care without causing problem. Yes, use mRNA similar lipid around it... Interesting concentration *so* different major difference.   realize it'd posted deleted. see NYT article CNN similar one, imagine sources too.

That's reason late.
They took lot effort time get vaccine stable. stored three months normal refrigerator. That's fantastic, think vaccine still huge hope lot countries.
And Ingmar Hoerr, CEO mastermind, getting cerebral hemorrhage helping either.  65+ vaccine rationing thing, making sure first vaccines went vulnerable.

This time medical approval thing, much strict. Part process dosage, child needs lower dose adult high dose dangerous, going hard cutoff. 11 11 months they'll expect wait 1 month. Sure boundary boundary reason, line needs drawn point. uk data whats concerning even potential existing vaccine problems, rely wacky system evaluate safety medical product? Belgium reserve list, yes, doesn’t mean cut in. 

For go age people serious illness. 25 years old serious illness (and we’re talking cancer, need/had transplant kind order), won’t get picked. 

There stories people cutting lines properly investigated, it’s always shown vaccine centres went list people didn’t respond time. 

Oh corrupt politicians like Sint-Truiden. Mayor cut in. a-holes exist course. Denmark ordered vaccines Sweden time also done better contain spread. arguably better position Sweden is.

One hope J&amp;J (and AZ) would opened younger people voluntary basis, chances happening unfortunately quite small. Denmark looking least. I'll one better: Schools area enforce three feet distance (unvaccinated) children ""when possible"", strictly enforce six feet distance students (vaccinated) teachers. 

Oh, schools open children crammed poorly ventilated classrooms, crowded cafeterias school buses windows closed, regional school administrative buildings superintendent's office closed public DUH, we're middle pandemic. 

Zero changes made protocols response new variant. 

Like...I even know say shit. Yeah, mean, earth ***could*** get slammed asteroid ten years, I'm going worry it.

Besides, generally unhealthy American lifestyle much processed food, much food general, much sugar diet, little exercise, want worry long-term health effects way productive things could worrying about. yet, still bought ice cream potato chips last weekend grocery shopping.  Almost every one know change lived life pandemic. continued going restraunts, traveling, going bars. Seeing many people werent willing make sacrifices lives good everyone else ruined perception people. want around people. infuriating see live care free many died.

Change social routine incurs cost- social cost specifically.

Our system neofeudal hypercapitalism ties activities mention social legitimacy. fact, neofeudal hypercapitalism erects paywalls every path social legitimacy; whereas profit meant expanding outward new markets, eventually hypercapitalism saturated easy conquer markets *Foucault's boomerang* took effect (also known Imperial Boomerang): tools used expand empire outward (weaponized finance corporatocracy) eventually turned inward. many ""services"" focus disruption former accepted standard order insert paywalls wherever possible.

When COVID comes long, people suddenly supposed less social. already hard sell given human beings social animals, even harder social venues tied consumption $$$ *relentlessly advertised normalized imperative activities* (because profits).

And add *lot* America service economy. Given America brutal healthcare costs, virtually safety net, etc people even mercy employment... destroyed due lockdowns. do? Enter 2 favorite quotes Man rational animal, rationalizing animal. -- Robert A. human beings *follow* moral systems, principles, ideologies; instead *use* *pull ether* whichever moral system, principle ideology justify rationalize actions performed behalf self interest. -- unknown redditor (paraphrased)

So faced financial/economic/social destruction lacking mental societal tools adapt way would allow thrive new situation, rationalize instead way possibly can. cases fiction broken *calamity* form COVID itself- loved one get *really* sick die due it. 

In effect order rationalize behavior *socially financially need*, descend rationalizing complete absurdity that's takes. term this: *hypernormalization.* coined Alexei Yurchak book *Everything Forever, More* covered last Soviet generation. term hypernormalization means rationalization absurdity- belief fiction.

FWIW I've shots ""out"" public place... 10 times maybe? 2 shots... rest mandatories (car inspection, etc). I've always masked (often N95+cloth), always distance, otherwise stay fuck home. I'm trying excuse behavior- I've tried understand it. think look hard AZ UK, pivotal vaccination program. gambled giving old people (at time low evidence effective), also gambled spacing doses (stepping tested conditions), wanted done ASAP.

Mind, saying results far bad, using AZ old people turned work probably saved hundreds cases blood clots young people. spacing shots far (and cross fingers) helped cooking resistant variant. make less gamble removes fact UK botched badly control covid push forward whatever had, good, bad ugly. fyi, 15 cases US 8 million shots administered prior pause. around 1 530k. Still low, pointing 6 cases based outdated data. yup. climate change, global warming, + droughts cause forest die burn unseen levels.  Interestingly found article that: corona-related cancellation Oktoberfest automatically mean end German folk festivals, according German Showmen's Association (DSB).

Translated (free version) new cases last 24 hours, 

that's many days 300,000 NEW cases day?

Say 5% need ""ICU care"" time next weeks.

where india find 15,000 open ICU beds every day, person 7 10 days stays?  

150,000 ICU beds needed , rolling patients every 10 days, minimum.

this going end well please show he’s made businesses can’t restrictions? Everything I’m reading says counties can’t mandates anymore businesses still set guidelines. Nah, people gonna start getting third fourth shots cause vaccine definitely affect them. strong reaction means vaccine job well. source this? psyched that, worrying symptoms something went wrong immune system kicked in. friend pointing many people reaction vaccine abnormal. then, really got said besides, maybe one people would've asymptomatic got full-out COVID.

No idea that's scientifically viable theory good point and, combined others reaction, made feel better. 100% this. It’s much easier simple rule everybody cope differences exemptions. 

Besides. dates relaxing rules published months now. ""Last summer...no, last REAL summer..."" strong reaction means done job. got second dose falling asleep sick, thankful getting reaction thankful even chance get vaccine. followers current government one both, remaining plain evil  Hell awesome. No, going back days. days over. Social distancing masks going forever matter what.  Got vaccinated decided pull trigger, even sent kids school. One week back kids caught cold. keep trying live please pretentious person I've ever seen? That'd great Sinovac? Risk children virtually non-existent risk contracting COVID subsequently transmitting also low. understand caution, see logic this. Munich local here:

I think overestimate amount planning goes Oktoberfest. big fair (ok world's biggest fair) every small village holds fair every year (normally). spots carnies spots tents, mostly rented advance years. clubs involved parades special things plan Oktoberfest organization big deal.

From point view biggest time constraint construction beer tents. less wood construction partial concrete foundation. start building around July (if remember correctly). However, pandemic going carnies nothing anyway beer tents used Oktoberfest exclusively. Bigger attractions like big roller coaster maybe need month set up.

All tourist part centrally organized, visitors come Munich.

The problem Oktoberfest crammed beer halls, colder weather makes perfect place super spreader event. hope that, vaccinations go well summer, could set something smaller locals (like Frühlingsfest) inviting carnies smaller beer tents. Nope. *Ugly bags mostly water* Walmart bro consider moderately risk-averse, mean, vaccine really grocery shop, visit mom, go doctors needed. also masked house cleaners every week. Though, spikes cut house cleaning (still paid them) groceries delivered. working home fairly isolated.

A weeks double-vaccinated went solo vacation Pigeon Forge. ate restaurants indoor things along outdoor things. Indoors wore mask, except restaurants. Outdoors, wore one show people crowd bleachers cheering shouting lot. perfectly fine comfort zone. nice milling around public spaces stopping chat people, meet dogs, chit-chat hanging out, without worrying murdering covid.

I friend autoimmune disease he's double-vaccinated still gone anywhere. wife hugely active socially would go eat, maybe see movie, visit friends least occasion. Aside doctor visits outdoor walks still hsn't gone out, though wife ventured back grocery store worries still reluctant. Yup. gotta gotta do. I’d thing. country shown chart second shot little boost antibodies recocered covid. Can't find data based though, probably internal testing hosptial. Based talking giving one shot recovered set stone yet. Exactly. special needs daughter that’s haven’t taken back school yet. mask staying on, needs much. I’m going get vaccinated ASAP send back every kid class vaccinated, teachers, too. Luckily, live people jumping vaccines. We’re nearing 70% adults vaccinated. time low pandemic started? I’m sorry I’m praying people India right now.  Lol you’re room full 1000 people 100 come that’s lot extra people. 

I think math throwing 10% lot. Depends works. foresee lot businesses “we would turning away potential customers”. Poor band. Dear Maria hit different :/ Yep. hate covid headlines say things like ""all time record"". totally me. I’m vaccinated would rather stay home myself. I’m dreading going office given sex life. 

This pandemic too, excuse. Sorry bearer bad news, 1 death Probably. get herd immunity we'll never lose social distancing mask wearing restrictions. They'll us forever herd immunity. Oh, heck, even try? They're never going end. year, next year, ever. hope wrong that. exchange someone thinks masks stay year long matter many vaccinated. REALLY discourage lot people. told entire life nothing ever truly free, hard suspicous. something goes whole life experience, wonder what's catch. would belive get bill afterwards? would belive guineapigs? would belive microchip kind control substance vaccine? Nobody cared health far, would belive suddenly care enough give something free? first hesitant got vaccines going Padre games constantly since!  still say “last year” referring 2019 understand Maybe pray hard enough, doomsday boner come true. Children make 22% population, shocking statistic. Well starters, likely fewer anti-vax kids certainly union representation. So... exactly reaching herd immunity? time panic? Much better uk. lockdowns covid.  Thanks buddy! Congrats wife :) feel first second shot? would great myth covid went away last summer could end.

Starting mid-June thru August cases absolutely exploded USA last summer. they’re two weeks. exists, extensive problem. looking recover ""life"". last summer cases went up, also ""seasonality""?

Cases declining due vaccines prior exposure. they’d known left Australia. We’ve known year they’d get permit leave can’t shocked now. stateless, halt flights permanent probably europe  states started incentivize hesitant (WVA, Maryland) Biden seems unable propose anything here.  refundable tax credit would easily push numbers much higher - anti-vaxx contingent largely lower income 300 bucks (for example) huge carrot able resist. wonder meant hep b, go schools fast. can’t there’s flights. PR disaster probably confined US Europe dire consequences latter

The AZ disaster albeit lot beginning fault (fucking studies, production delays) made progressively harder vaccinate parts Europe largely dependent non MRNA vaccines, e.g. Romania, mistrust already runs high. still convinced AZ bad vaccine instance probably made obsolete soon possible many countries 

In developing countries, trust AZ JJ vaccine probably higher Chinese vaccines. even compare stats branding, viable them. least people figure out. sure advising Biden vaccine hesitancy. trying drop political points here. hate Tories, simply hate police country much.  It’s USA state Biden would announce 300 dollar refundable credit taxpayers dependents ""vaccine hesitancy"" would disappear week.

But 300 MILLION per million Americans. 10 Million 3 BILLION. 100 Million individuals 30 BILLION!!! (so, words, 1-2 percent Covid Aid) USA think meant got sick covid first dose agree, people need research make minds, told think.  Many second shots though, total number people vaccinated much lower. Still bad. Get zoomers vaxxed! PR disaster dumping inferior goods would much smaller hoarding vaccines. J&amp;J inferior, even bettter one shot design.

I mean, Cina behaved decent pandemic exporting rough numbers. One think it. Australian travels India third country, stays two three weeks travels Australia? allowed? interesting Moderna said almost mRNA use 100µg. upcoming CureVac 12.5µg. actually enough vaccines now. current strategy Norway (and, guess many countries) delay 2nd shot much possible offer majority people non-risk groups chance first jab soon possible. Risk groups get 2nd shot shorter waiting period. 

This lead lot people needing 2nd shot 2-3-4 months time.

This could one factor extends waiting period last percent deemed least risk. Good job guys, like we're already 5 months worldwide vaccine rollout. 

Better late never, guess. country available? might thinking dropped pithy political point really unclear reader.

For overseas readers perhaps see things UK residents - UK policing consistently underfunded decade extent party throttling financially said restore numbers cut.

UK ridiculous place right now, afflicted even cynical version Trump. cruel difference one cultured educated pretends stupid. still fools voters.  Per capita compared EU members, course. sounds fantastic! sort comforting hear stories like people learning enjoy different ways rely mindless-consumerism-spend-spend-spend.

The way people reacting reminds ways I've seen alcoholic friends react co-enabling friends quit drinking, people get resentful friends starting families can't party every weekend anymore. No, someone need go therapy want eat fucking Applebees.   sucks even conservative estimates we'd hit 50% going days. We're slowing even least optimistic prediction considered.  swear  prosit

Ftfy it’s over. almost like shit like takes time patience instead half assing shit you’re inconvenienced. Username checks many daily cases h1n1 august 2010? thought took 17 year old get vaccinated 15 year old stayed home... thinking 15 year old 16 4 months, gives shit 4 months? mass vaccine clinics run dept health also child profile vaccine registry. vital stats registry... Every child WA gets vaccine gets administration logged something called child profile, provider school look see child’s vaccine history. They’d go log name DOB, find match realize DOB wrong figure out. sure legal repercussions lying DOB healthcare situations brain said plausible someone would know lied vaccine admin’d person approved/recommended safely receive it. No, parents can. Imagine fucked kid could bringing completely preventable disease back home one family members catches happens lucky enough survive it. Yeah, see much anti-vax stuff Spain. 

Although guess see older population anyway high risk COVID, likely see younger population started vaccinated yet.

If not, means lipid nanoparticles longer intact mRNA spilled buffer solution quickly destroyed environment. would make vaccine useless.

Im surprised coming late pandemic, would assume lot underreporting well impoverished areas.  using vaccines 3 different suppliers, therefore term 'steady supply' spot on. course.... previously mentioned, EU countries also give Commission mandate act interfering unproductive ways, example DE, NL Italy trying make deal start, France pushing Sanofi (I mean, seriously...?). bad luck mid-2020 would thought BioNTech/Pfizer would first vaccine market, AZ able deliver despite contracts, tiny deal made Moderna. heckling price rather getting guaranteed deliveries, also heckling product liablity, US UK released companies liability, global supply chain challenges also caused US essentially blocked exports major components necessary production. basically whole mess needed sorted out. good see EU got mandate put right person it, fixed it. need temper ""1 new death"" fact bank holiday weekend. look numbers, ones reported Monday/Tuesday always much lower rest week due fewer people recording deaths weekend (and week, it'll Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday low numbers reported, shadowing bank holiday weekend).

If look Worldometer graphs UK deaths see repeating pattern 2 low days 5 high days per week purely artifact working patterns, actual rates people dying.

The 7 day moving average trends watched, one day's numbers isolation.

Having said UK's 7 day average deaths 15 per day still falling. SF SF.

The entire SF Bay Area performed exceptionally well COVID. yes problem Turkey  concrete numbers yet risk reinfection vaccine vs natural infection? think pushing would probably sway lot people. I’ve seen data saying natural infection 80-90% risk reduction reinfection, I’d assume similar reduction risk hospitalization/severe infection. think best target pushing vaccinations never infected haven’t vaccinated, go infected previously. Or, know, including title actually countries world going pandemic. Glad wait till birthday get vaccine get Haha yeah, mine 12...fingers crossed go 6m-11 approval shortly. Lol, depends size room it. Whether 10% increase lot depends hospital capacity overall trend. 10% week sound like noise me, 10% next week next week problem. somebody think poor, destitute pharmaceutical companies

To clear arguments patent protection **not** ""deserving"" pharma companies profits, rather, increasing decreasing patent protection result greater lesser innovation new drugs. America's best kept secret. Pfizer finally going start fulfilling Canadian orders Kalamazoo, MI instead Puurs, BE. expect Moderna follow suit shortly.

That's symptomatic infection, asymptomatic infection transmission. applies worried getting sick, also worried transmitting vulnerable people want help keeping covid cases falling might want cautious. think earlier trial stage children. Pfizer lead trials children. may turn Pfizer may first one kids Canada access reason.  Yes, yes, yes. tired people knowing, understanding, researching, following rules masking. kid autism. always figure hand think something trigger meltdown. guess think masks bullshit never got used wearing one thought something happened plane could say ""autism"" Southwest would ok it. using autistic kid excuse whine mask mandates. depends high local covid cases high vaccination rates. someone fully vaccinated hardly one else community is, covid rates 1 10 people vaccinate, likely catch Covid transmit someone vulnerable second unvaccinated living area 1 100000 covid. 


Also vaccinated people mixing freely unvaccinated people creates perfect conditions evolution vaccine resistance, Covid rates high, dumb. Looks like Arkansas dangerous place live. literally nothing profits. Countries violating basic human rights seafarers violating international treaties they, signed refusing allow crew changes. 700 cases/day country &lt;6million still high baseline. actually make estimation? Using argument, room full 10 people 1 comes in. lot.  sure county you’re referring might want take look testing numbers comparison. places testing hardly last April, making cases look much lower reality. variant/strain spreads become dominant, sentience process, natural selection aka survival fittest. symptoms start person feels unwell person become less active spread virus less. symptoms lessened without compromising virus reproduction advantage virus person remain active.

The virus causes disease Covid19 spread symptoms start often mild, long person feel unwell period high spread, mutation allows virus reproduce faster advantage. person develops severe symptoms days later matter, virus already spread. something learned/researched- I'm expert. Like people's unwillingness let go live despite pandemic disappointed me, wanted understand why. seems logical me; run filters logic keep/discard whatever :) India pls, people dying want variants Holiday weekend. India keeps workweek West also celebrates May Day. People put way much stock seasonality covid. It’s definitely factor hasn’t particularly reliable, like would dominant factor like flu, surges every year months like clockwork. parts country declined bottomed last summer, others (pretty much entire south half) spiked hard time. Also covid infectious symptoms appear long people usually die. strain already transmitted patient's family friends makes difference kills person two weeks later Vs person recovering two weeks later. see sides but, clear end day parents done research best understand travel works right best assist child process.

For sake clarity. 

Certain sequences RNA perform [reverse modify genome, particular mRNA designed so. Exactly. Like said, numbers lie Imagine living country bribe people save lives! Thank this. comment sat way long without challenge. love idea?? cause way smarter them, he's mad /s vaccine stop transmission, reduce possibility original UK strain. AZ vaccine ineffective B.1.351 strain vaccines reduced efficacy. data efficacy double triple mutation India.  Numbers change 16h since post made! 

Holy mother God: again.

NB ""10 times infectious"" sense transmits 10× easily (i.e., R0 gone 3-5 30-50), sense viral loads 10× higher. still huge cause concern, may also indicate immune escape, neither quite bad headline makes out.

Edit: fact, here's epidemiological data makes think may much, much, much less bad headline make week it’s back butterfly kisses homies.  much would 10x increase viral titers affect transmission roughly? 1.5x? 2x? 3x?

The UK variant 60% transmissible IIRC, much higher viral titers (vs previous strains)? lot schools supposedly vaccinating kids without parents approval... Since kids smarter dumb parents higher amount getting vaccine. mother recalls permission slip required polio vaccine NYC. mother (a doctor!), wouldn’t sign first. period time later second opportunity get vaccine able convince mother sign form.  22% population kids... yeah needs go fast can't hit herd immunity matter what. 5,5M expected Spain Q2 delivered promised 300.000 April. 1M expected May 4,2M June wish best. Spend 2 weeks Kathmandu valley Annapurna area two years ago absolutely loved country.

Definitely wants go back over. America .... interesting large sums cash involved. excluding governments course. call BS unless name expert. Even then, could’ve unlucky infected finishing regimen. Thee things happen extremely rare instances. Yeah, maybe everyone automatically opted opt-out form instead permission slip. kids want parents don’t simply “lose” form. country protecting citizens important profits shipping companies, real concern shipping giants have.  Viruses mutate become infectious, rather infectious mutations tend take virus (and bacterial) populations.

Often deadly diseases particularly infectious, host tends die passing infection. diseases tend mutate become less deadly (in case fatality rate terms), helps infectious.

But disease fatality rate around 1%, frankly, little selection pressure become less deadly. 1% hosts die, big deal, 99% more.

So told dangerous half truth. Probably people whose objectives trivialize Covid-19 whatever reason. post think shouldn’t get attention? mean open things [I made comment exciting. Someone reported noise complaint, *five* police officers turned up, told us COVID regulation, took details told us go home. email university admins issuing us warning. like \~8 us there. seems 2.6 low side. lancet paper November gives range 2.5-3.5, new variants took hold. account vaccines arent 100% efficient stopping transmission, estimate 75-90% vaccinated naturally immune, herd immunity original strain. 

We get one way another though. mean countries make harder... correct consider opinion

After fun vacation Florida, Cody Paige Petek two children set fly back Des Moines, Iowa, Sunday. layover St. Louis, 5-year-old son, nonverbal autism sensory processing disorder, struggling wear mask.

The Peteks say Southwest Airlines crew refused let connecting flight.
Dr. Vince Hassel, also flying Des Moines, says people started lobbying get boy board crew refused.

“They weren’t going let kid plane didn’t put mask on. kind bandana around neck, wasn’t throwing fit. watch play absolutely horrible,” Hassel said.
As scene playing out, family says 5-year-old seizure, medication board flight Des Moines.
The Petek family says drive home St. Louis rental car. hourlong plane ride turned nearly six-hour drive.

Anthony L. Marchetti Jr., Peteks’ lawyer, believes Southwest violated Americans Disabilities Act. Transportation Security Administration’s policy states people disabilities cannot wear mask disability exempt wear one.

In statement, Southwest cited federal law requiring everyone 2 years age older wear mask travel. airline says “considers applications exemptions” passengers disabilities, child “did exemption.”

The airline says employees offered book hotel Peteks, family could try trip later time. Instead, family chose drive, airline says gave full refund. you’re associating kids n increased transmission?

Also giving desease immunocompromised people children still can't get shot (or worse due parents getting one approved). Seriously? logic sucks. Covid require two weeks minimum. Pretty much everyone team covid back March last year (our boss came work running fever). one two weeks. think anyone even week. Maybe two three days. like two days end week. still felt like crap next week could work. Yeah get you. Maybe flu season makes sense time year relax. 

I read anxiety vaccinated people afraid go out. hope return normal soon. See articles linked. Yup, much better go lower risk higher efficacy vaccines reduce vaccine hesitancy

It's also probably happening everyone became much careful we're ahead curve result. crowd particularly busy vaccination schedule.

i'm sure there's some.... ""where/when existing sequence best"" questions answered. 

&amp;#x200B;

2-3-4 jabs every visit \~6 Pfizer said kids 2-11 get Sept Anti maskers vaccers 
Should look this
Then look India 
Then get fucking shot Title edited highly misleading. JJ vaccine then? new MRNA vaccines quite simple compared biologics. yet, generic biosimilar factories set world.... possible third shot would continue give body immunity way need flu shot every year immunity? boss, per links replied comment, vaccines manufacturers indemnified claims arising ""unavoidable side effects"", things like itchy injection sites, sore arms, temporary fatigue etc. another vaccine creates blood clots someone unavoidable side effect, cause litigation. 

But take 4 minutes know, read article commenting on, see fact recourse FDA-approved vaccines, EUAs. I'd much rather go Montreal Texas, I'd happy give extras.   I've seen parents baby interact anyone got whooping cough vaccine. pretty common. 

It's really fatal newborns, pretty easy prevent, vaccine good seveal years. they're doing, they're contractual obligation Oxford uni  Adding brains anti-vaxxers make hive mind dumber. always. Felt like hit bus 2 days first shot. Second one severity, felt bad around 12-16 hours. Pretty much felt like flu without congestion coughing. Still anything afraid though. Sure, felt crummy, better actually sick. bit stretch goal, wonder carrots sticks mind.

As far carrots, I’d work private sector subsidize/increase freebies vaccinated. ITunes Amazon credits starters.

Allowing people cruise fly mask free vaccinated would also help.

I surprised haven’t seen creative public service announcements people like Morgan Freeman, Tom Hanks Rock urging people patriotic duty get vaccinated. Like hey grandfathers stormed Normandy save world, need get shot arm.

As far sticks, could force military perhaps federal workers get vaccinated. also wonder future financial aid colleges could tied vaccination rates.

If get 70 percent vaccination rates adults, combined existing acquired immunity put bed quite time. 100% expect ""Church Anti-Vaccinian"" popping eventually people try use excuse. don’t want take vaccine, quit job good luck you. right get vaccine people around right get sick cause read something Facebook. I’m waiting idiots got lucky far everyone else careful get sick die out. Mother Nature get move on. I’m pissed couldn’t visit Grampa time see died cancer last month, motherfucking idiots wrong thing. Really comes willing business pay lawyers. might win court, probably get back $300,000 lawyer fees costs. know me!!!

Oh. Wait, actually describes situation exactly. get close herd immunity. Really comes willing business pay lawyers. might win court, probably get back $300,000 lawyer fees costs. lot, no. Mostly people parents' age bought seventies eighties whose children grown. Agreed. willingness take vaccine rising. policy letting younger people get vaccine may encourage hesitant friends family. Personal experience often best way counteract false information don’t understand science trust government. seems happening USA. Also prohibition funnily enough Unfortunately, additive like that. got assume folks natural infection group gotten vaccine well (for asymptomatic cases, even know), lost enough antibody load longer sterilizing. 

I would assume half infected population contributing herd immunity vaccine group. So, 60-65% total.

That's certainly close deserving celebration, there's still bit ways go herd immunity reached. suggesting immunity remains level indefinitely, true. rest world also needs help, remember there's also huge percentage selfish people get vaccine. right, doesn’t feel like he’s setting failure. Unless forces them, lot people aren’t gonna get vaccine. Availability longer issue. 1 dose stated article. guess US government start 1 dose hopefully try get people take second dose. Annual flu vaccination rates pretty consistent around 60% super easy get drugstore days.

Feels like that's ceiling unless big push schools, large employers, public venues get people it.

I'm hopeful hardcore anti-vax group small, rest need nudge. years never got flu shot simply easy places get it. became clear could get walk-up basis $0 copay, always get it.

Hopefully future years we'll flu covid shots together. Cries young non-essential True I’m glad agree  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

It’s over! Let’s party” moment don’t think that’s really going come. reminds bit 9/11 traumatic event shaped world continue eventually time stopped constantly center public discourse. Already see signs public’s focus shifting elsewhere

I don’t think we’ll ever “go back 2019” move forward. masks come distancing end eventually hopefully world pays little attention emerging viruses HR department scheduled mine. never lifted finger. kind funny Americans line overnight black friday deal hassle vaccine save lives / allow us safely reopen. bit funny given comment setting front Walmart / Costco / Target. hear similar strategies starting looked - basically outreach try talk people ready get vaccine right there. real nice could sliiiiiide August, guys. Vaccines general. want pay measles. consider flu shot. typically easy free. also something kill people. yourself, lady standing next compromised immune system. Save life, get yearly flu shot.  Alex Jones said everybody gets vaccinated dead 10 years.

RIP me. Cue social pressure  Tax rebates vaccinated next stimulus. don’t get vaccinated can’t get reduces based get it. shouldn’t foot bill people get vaccinated. guy chose ""KimJongFunk"" reddit name comes harmless wordplay. 11. I'm North Carolina larger metro (for state). honest waited state opened everyone. able schedule appointment portal health care provider 1 day group opened. major nightmare. site bit busy 45 minutes.

On top that, Walgreens pharmacies also offering appointments though agree level go hunt slots. 

I'm bit concerned really difficult month numbers still going down. think also hitting lower hanging fruit (like me) going crazy game system prior phase opening, also eager get open. know CA mess think combo state portals poorly built simple reality managing roll 35 million people. 

Rural areas I'd imagine rolling Walgreens whatever local health infrastructure have. I'd hope much mess due smaller populations knows. don't, vaccine turns covid disease dangerous even one rare cases still get sick.

We ""know"" someone else sick diseases we? reason cared covid kills people, unvaccinated people...so vaccinated, matter. girlfriends car got broken got 2nd Pfizer dose…

Really makes think…. make things like Disney World, movie theaters, sporting events, etc. require vaccination proof. Sure, people get fake vaccine cards, it'll enough incentive people. troll state governors facebook page. every post makes, there's many comments covidiots. there's way going get 70% people voluntarily vaccinated without means.  Let’s go! Get children vaccinated too. Yeah significant change since people bigger buffer personal space whole pandemic anyways. like 3 trucks come neighborhood itll christmas music. Yes.. thats right. Christmas music. think one first real reach goal. We’re close 900k-million dropping steadily everyday idk likely maintain 500k another 2 months. decrease linear would need decreasing 13k day. look current pace decreasing much higher pace it’s likely decrease even rate suspect. True. don’t get 3rd shot, won’t mean whatever happening happening well? reason already mandatory military vaccine emergency approval full approval. vaccines get (and lot) mandatory COVID gets full FDA approval. go back far enough different still ancestor.   CDC probably little lower lack rigourous testing CDC did. We've known long time outdoor transmission low. Yet rule said technically wear mask even outside.

So yeah, outside 6 feet long overdue. Honestly, feel like point may well open June. issue people want doses can't get them, plain planning getting it. that's case everyone already knows risks fine see problem opening everyone WANTS shot gotten girlfriend vaccinated yet, want it, girlfriend feels 100% confident Pfizer vaccine that's one we're trying go for, places near us available yet we're hoping they'll soon. soon, we're likely get Moderna shot dumb get free healthcare deadly disease. Fuck it! I'm telling girl going biggest reason held off. I’m high risk told people knew wanting get ASAP, see opening appointment, send link I’ll sign up. wasn’t going sit internet hours day looking open slot go get it. worked. Get second jab next Monday. Look, think important make every effort both, find people can't get informed enough vote years hearing candidates campaigns, surprising people taking COVID vaccines priority?

The reality everyone super excited things, be, hard make case everyone. Moreover, agree vaccines super good population, immediate tangible benefit tomorrow except feel better. Life change 180 degrees tomorrow got vaccination. still masking up, working remote, taking precautions, etc. Getting vaccinated tied activity today big motivator. people barred flying taking public transit whatever without vaccine, see people sign much faster. thought export ban? partners brother hasnt able get one yet. First hesitated thought he'd pay. big thing young man without health insurance. also working 60 hour weeks. educated he's looking spare moment go/might already signed up/done walk in. Im sure I'll find weekend.

We need huge PR campaign. actually 100 dollar saving bond originally. really carrot trying decide. met super libs. vaccinated immediate meaningful impact quality life.

It doesn’t really. got vaccinated, quality life didn’t really change it. went “almost certainly going die Covid” “even almost certainly going die Covid.” shame factoring risk people. It’s 70 percent adult population general population. read somewhere else thread they’re 62 percent adult population one dose goal seem attainable. NJ trying reach goal June although everyday it’s looking little bit harder. think north east hit 70 percent goal June July. Chambersburg coworkers think covid fake vaccine bullshit political play wolf I’m honestly envious you. don’t want anxious it, am! I'm ok that. get flu shot every year.

This article talks scientists concerned ADE COVID vaccines toward People still babies think happen. way many idiots think shot kill never get shot matter tell them.  Shout Angelinos helped get us here! tracks saw last August, showed pictures schools opened around Atlanta, bunch white students wearing masks, every one black students wearing mask. Contrary lot people say, seems like African-American community took pandemic seriously. guess understand point view, I've followed rules going like lightswitch, feel zero stress going back normal. NY definitely going vaccine rate. We're 48% first dose 36% second good enough imo. happens accidentally get many doses, mix match vaccines? bite bullet pay people. got already? Cool. Here's stimulus check. yet? Cool, sign get vaccine. don’t want listen science that’s call. I’m pointing scientific consensus according published research. matter everyone vaccinated people interact vaccine get where? ask know Walgreens making people wait 4 weeks CDC guidance 3 weeks Pfizer. didn’t caution, made things easier them. Maybe allowed schedule appointments, good, that’s different caution. They’ve adjusted 3 weeks. think estimating many want go back old normal compared big ask change is.

Will things linger? Probably like TSA pointed out, things linger, mostly mild annoyances huge shifts ways life.

So going prove vaccinated get countries even might take while, places going require vaccine passport, people might go places stresses them.

But really think people going big ass clubs bars, gatherings, travel, huge weddings, public activity, going change dramatically over? That's like saying 9/11 going fly anymore, maybe, nearly everyone added extra steps.

In 2019 friend group big ass trip Vegas weekend. 3-4 hotel room, clubbing, drinking, shit around town, went day club even see pool many people it. Guess kind environment city like Vegas trying post covid? Beyond that, lot us willing go back (once we're vaccinated). may extra steps (vaccine requirements etc) people willing give up.

Also, rule changes purpose here? Pennsylvania's already 63% adults. 51% people general, including children, eligible. get second shots CVS confirm vaccination clinic, may plan place already second shot put aside Thanks. Ill let public health experts/scientists decide needed not. Pfizer's decision. not? vaccinated, what's risk you? Thank you! People like data. That's gets complicated many people jobs year remotely. challenge explain they'd go office now. Demand fallen cliff state. peak 132k daily vaccinations 72k. Whatever, know two weeks family members across 3 states gotten 2nd shots. can't wait start going restaurants without worry. next guest Tucker Carlson Wtf, third world collapsing now? seems reachable

That seems like next week, week next Oh please. Ok: cite cases outdoor transmission, go. I’ll bet come kinds superspreader indoor events last year. Name outdoor ones don’t link indoor event. Funerals? Start churches. Sport events? Linked bars along strip nearby. School sports? Linked indoor events cold states. Specify one specifically outdoor scenario virus spread. not? second dose prescheduled Yeah good news. 40% still really low target population said that.  shows approximate real-time update vaccinations currently estimating August 5th 70% population fully vaccinated. date slowly getting pushed lately agree July 4th ambitious. basing calculations danish stats 

I'm basing available. provided case fatality rate age far overlook 60% (Danish) deaths age ranges amongst risk groups already vaccinated Denmark. 

That incredibly low results large amount deaths. I'm overlooking anything. Vaccination obviously adequate overlook vulnerable older age groups virus passed them, also already vaccinated.

Again admission not. look daily death statistics virus absolutely still passed onto older overlook July August far fewer cases per day 700 get now. 

Today May, AZ vaccine decision made even earlier. July August. 2-3 people dying every single day right now. Try focus reality Danish authorities estimate using J&amp;J vaccine save one person ICU cost 12 30 people severe complications vaccine. estimate cancelling use vaccine cost deaths postpone reopening.

I know could possibly made conclusion 700 people infected every day 2-3 dying every single day. That's 1 233 350 people dying every day due infection. vaccines dangerous. risk ratio even galaxy. decision made Danish authorities completely unwarranted obviously completely idiotic. would probably go like lead balloon could offer stimmy check vaccinated since ones willing take steps revive old normal. Unless... got late. matter needed wanted also potential safety concerns school starts? want vaccine least one shot now

that's true live.. longer scramble.. people still sniffing around.. might waiting place walk open slots.. want first priority ***convenience***.

&amp;#x200B;

where live, 72% one, 49% both... 

it's pretty safe go unvaccinated right now.. sense urgency way down.

""i'll tomorrow""  case one month masking indoors outdoors otherwise bbq you! I'll bet he'd do, hold manilla envelope, say reach desired numbers, he'll reveal contents live TV. Bug them. let put longer. Send list times locations. Lazy excuse anymore. might need nudging that's help.  accounts I’ve read here. thought actually weekend met great Aunt's hospice nurse talking feels blessed got vaccine, wait til family could get it. asked family get it, said ""well, signed myturn.ca.gov told would get text turn, never did. guess still medical personnel."" showed everyone eligible, happy immediately told family. 

Of course, everyone story, reasonably well off, well educated person even know family could get vaccine. seems crazy me, I'm trying think saw availability. work Reddit. one city reached me. doctor check make sure knew. subscribe newspaper. 

There might larger expected group people know. knew last spring Fucker aerosol virus. didn’t care bosses told wear mask March: given two N95’s past fit tested work wore patient’s homes starting March 2020, rotated use.  read article last April virus spreading, specific; employees catching presence one infected person not, read many articles aerosolized virus quickly dissipate outside one case Wuhan could tracked outdoor transmission. year many hiking camping trips refused congregate indoors, even stepped buying van convert interstate road trip take get daughter cross country new job, didn’t want stay hotel rooms. little thought virus transmits; like secondhand smoke, make logical deductions. Outdoor wedding sporting event? course not. hiking trail? Never wore mask. every expert news last spring said thing specifically: you’re going catch run, walk, passing someone trail. still fixated vaccine litigation solution? real problem hundreds thousands dead Americans millions dead people world. Clearly problem you, rest us real world is. think lot large institutions would like FDA approved begin mandating it. agree line thinking, _may_ legal avenue whereby differentiation approved emergency use could matter, thus setting precedent could weaken vaccine mandates (even though legal 100 years mandate vaccination) camp definite YES covid shot MAYBE flu shot.

If sitting CVS nurse said both, would take it? Covid one made go there...but flu too, not? right plan start largely accomplished

The distribution vaccines kind wonky. Southeastern PA got way fewer vaccines gotten - although fair, Southeastern part state used shafted rest state. greater Philadelphia area basically red-headed stepchild Pennsylvania. Dying horrible disease 99.98% people live through? Source? infecting others vaccinated thing likely uncommon it’s something worry based studies Israel CDC That’s point, he’s saying doesn’t care  Exactly. used work warehouse beer home country breakage rate bottles close 7%...now know colleagues probably let bottles slip backpacks anecdotally 1/20 bottles actually broken. spoilage rate 0.5% amazing especially considering demand forecasting, cancellations combined temperature quality control requirements “real world” environment.  

Honestly think article highlight win. think government run vaccination clinic would much higher spoilage rate.  GOT satirical take lmao mean we’ve reporting issues whole time.

But really point. point California, low past case rates (natural immunity) seem predictive current rates. Vaccination rates, masking distancing, etc seem better predict rates. county like 250 per 100k.  Well, sounds like clusterfuck. Sure, spread people, that’s concerning part me.

The unfortunate reality infectious disease someone safe doesn’t affect them. soread affect others.

I’m still excited start going back normal too, still concern well.   Masks like chain link fences trying keep mosquitoes out.

It doesn’t work. Children account roughly 22% Americans. that's many cases, means immunity matching blended rate immunity value adults. Really interesting.

And makes sense. 60% adults shots, 90%ish effective. Children said 50% protected virtue children. That's roughly even protection. roughly 50% protected society collectively. 

Beyond this, children eligible (Pfizer next week) I'd expect ratio drop. mean, people definitely there. talking friend fully vaccinated month now, said ""considering"" going grocery store grocery shopping instead getting delivery. like, yeah, ok, soon achieved fully vaxed status felt comfortable eating indoor restaurants, obviously different places regard risk. fine long start shaming IMO. Lots people feel injection. Totally normal. Probably not, pain actual needle associated skill person administering relaxed muscle is. Lots people seem report barely felt covid vaccine shot soreness fact.  threat?   I’m going lie, we’re spite beat states something. We’re stubborn people. go [CDC's state trends look CA, OR, WA see overall CA's peak cases rate double WA almost triple per-capita basis. Overall case counts CA also roughly 2x CA.

Certainly SF exceptional numbers major city, keep mind comprises less 2% population state. would Tory then? defunding police UK Tory policy decades. would eat indoors restaurant flu season without precautions.

I think that's potential point misunderstanding various reddit commenters. trying bit wise went back December 2019 flu cases insane. That's everybody that's fine, I'm like coming nowhere comes taking Covid seriously. Depends fills survey comes mail   whole damned tee ball team got chickenpox! wish would figure out. covid want get vaccine know much ACTUALLY need... think paying people get vaccinated great idea. science...  Yeah, mean, wants live COVID-free place go normal life zero worries simple thing like picking groceries could end killing maiming you? bunch chumps! anybody else barely feel thing vaccinated?

Everybody family complained arm pain, barely felt prick. vaccine wrongly inserted?  Aye, Prison Guards Healthcare Workers well. least Police generally breathing fresh air. Prison Guards building air circulating around (I know air-con nothing beats outside fresh air). Covid-19 rife Prisons.

As Healthcare Workers, job refuse (without good reason) vaccine forfeit job. ifs, buts!  upvote sentiment enough. you’re scared shadow don’t wanna go - stay inside. rest us gonna go lives....  I'm also worried even specific worry particular restriction. worry restrictions sends message human interaction inherently risky best avoided. frankly terrifying thought. fully vaccinated, unfortunately me, I’m still scared go out. thought would return back normal fear would fade away getting 2nd shot, boi wrong. Hypotheticallly, safe feel getting 2 shots AZ vaccine six weeks apart?

Can feel safe people get Pfeizer/Moderna do? Big true anti vax one anti care? really persons fault point. Yeah get boolean stuff. kid play outdoors kids see reason cram us cramped restaurants indoor dining wait another six weeks cases die down. We're going traumatized waited another couple months eat overly greasy burger. \*knocks wood\* think Covid way California good.

Otherwise would waiting end May/early June Pfizer Moderna amid 3rd wave. huge uptake Canada.  say should. Im simply stating fact. I’m fully vaccinated dipping toe living normal life again. Went dentist, eye doctor, got massage. dentist awful, like always. appointments blast quite honestly. got new glasses (finally!!) massage relaxing- haven’t breathed slowly deeply long time. Health appointments top priority right now- think skip eating indoors restaurant quite yet... besides friend’s place seats 8 people anyway. 

For comes truly worth doing. anything pandemic showed prioritize things find important. 

My husband. Physical mental health. Supporting close friends. Going back school. Going beach. 

Moving forward, social events indoors public low list now. continue ‘rona habit going beach couple times month summer. house parties. probably hang much people don’t fully wholeheartedly trust- obligation parties random coworkers. continue spend time hobbies like reading houseplants. study GRE realized really want get Master’s degree program want requires it. 

Priorities shifted grateful. link worked me:  necessarily. ongoing learning process everyone. hope sharing though reminding importance continued research. data greatly reduce strain especially countries like India high number citizens recovered Covid. think so. pandemic shithole Bolsonaro probably end late 2022 early 2023. thanks optimism hope.   Yep, state 32% fully vaccinated rolling 7 day average peak 130k daily vaccination 78k checked now. That's bit disconcerting seeing 3 weeks since opened vaccines general public April 12. Free Beer immediate draw people in. masks would officially vaccinated, like two weeks second dose.  know you’re right, can’t agree more. probably continue learing bizarre disease myriad symptoms years come. eyes average american, especially ones already skeptical, it’s gonna sound like flip flopping. think lot people lost trust/faith Fauci initially said don’t need mask up. major fuckup part, dont think chalk new info. it’s respiratory disease causes spread coughing, anong things. mask no-brainer, think govt knew would shortages chose downplay aspect. 14 lupus here, excited relieved hear news! care. Smaller crowds fine regardless pandemic. Fuckin morons going keep virus going long tine.  Yeah it’s unfortunate we’ve got many antivaxxer parents won’t let kids get it. think would, I'd wrong. even relevant? exporting something least it'd disagreement scale, owe anything.

You need ""owe"" anything anyone something decent. Sure, selfish like. expect called it. go Target. UGH many people getting vaccine ""you still get COVID vaccinated"" that's case ton vaccines had. gonna say india? Lol yep. Fully vaccinated went favorite bar first time past weekend. outside entire time, anytime walked get drink wear masks. totally get it, masked appropriately never anti-mask, vaccinated (and outdoors) felt really theatrical really quickly. That's fine, people age group even getting covid? really flip flopping adjust message based new data. brand new disease, gone zero information quite lot still know everything years yet. happy keep trotting article headline every week true time again. Masks distancing sick household member need stay though. want people spreading flu every year.  That's also reason never drive car even order pizza driver might crash way house. experienced several different types anxiety pandemic including pre-pandemic anticipatory anxiety MD (retired now), anxiety locked down, grief give socializing, complacency, anxiety related grocery trips, vaccinations looking life may change long term. don’t think pandemic really over. Mutations cause waves outbreaks like battles wars, time let think normalcy hand, resumed socializing traveling, next wave mutants doorstep mask lock again. demoralizing, wish combat traumatized again. Look current world numbers graphs Worldometer, worldwide pandemic peak. Every weeks, new set countries beset. Half US antibodies, vaccinations disease, leaves 160 million us get sick get medical religion. No, normalcy next hill. meant generally. Many countries received less vaccinnes ordered. police UK many things, underfunded definitely isn’t one them. well, criticize government (Texas specific), changes shit. Stupid governors like Abott DeSantis still sitting office making stupid orders. anybody happen know scientifically use amount vaccine everybody...from 400 pound adult tiny 12 year old child?

For reason use dose vaccine 400 pound adult 100 pound adult. immune response really dependent size individual. I'm perfectly fine allowing people wear want, mandate them. businesses want require them, that's fine, always business cater want them. UK variant shown cause reinfection rates higher original wild type. spreads faster reinfect easier. Oh damn, got it. Well, barring eradication, hopefully minimized becomes risk like others around pre-COVID. mind allowed drop mask mandates? Really? understand none news articles pointing also makes illegal public K-12 University Arkansas requiring masks well. Arkansas state statewide ban preventing schools requiring masks. front page national news even mentioned. post says completely banning citizens returning India. Period. won’t even accept quarantine. Australian citizen steps Australian soil India past 14 days jailed 5 years fined 66000 AUD. stage Australians India essentially stateless risk contracting dying covid. Australia jail return. Meanwhile, Chris Pratt, Zach Efron, Natalie Portman etc allowed enter country despite Australians all.

Still think it’s right abandon citizens letting Hollywood stars in? thinks masks normal?

Many asian countries.

But everyone wearing 100% time course not. Hopefully US gets point like Japan - risk feel comfortable using mask time without social derision, may sick mask protect others.

I doubt outcome, hey dream! knows why, couple cases year /S

Fucking liars. Little sis 13 autoimmune disorder.

Ecstatic read this!  Might something Californians actually getting vaccinated Stupid sexy monkey doo-wop group. 15yro: yay! 11 1/2yro: UGH! close! Firstly, it’s new technology. mRNA technology around years. Secondly, it’s “record time” urgent need vaccine, money put amount companies working it. safety steps skipped, less bullshit bogging development wayyyyy funding. you’re uncomfortable using Pfizer, use Moderna Astrazeneca, one non-profit. don’t see much gain releasing non-profit vaccine world help, you?  companies already contracting multiple facilities Rentschler, Polymun, Rovi, Recipharm Lonza. that’s name few. mention, absolutely manufacturing things last year. impossible?

And top that, companies flat refused begin process world wide production last could’ve already extra capacity production. 

And you’re pulling 3 months ass means anything we’re looking poor countries vaccinated 2024? whenever person feels comfortable things like community spread, vaccination rates, etc. 

Why insisting people go spend money something feel comfortable doing? turned strange conversation. Source? didn’t see anywhere yet quite interested.  Australia. people, it’s easier low barrier access come vaccine

This way. That’s one don’t understand. can’t get mad people believing science, science says it’s ok gather outdoors, say it’s ok. You’re picking choosing want believe anti maskers(edit: say pro mask, pro vaccine, person socially distanced. hit two weeks second dose I’m gonna continue believe scientists) Kind seems like vaccination passports could key strategy getting shots arms.
Edit: course people throw temper tantrums get want anyway. start catering many whiners? can't, w/ straight face, say viewers FOXNEWS watching primetime programs (Tucker/Hannity/Ingram) getting honest information vaccine safety/effectiveness. opinion shows profit fear/doubt. People watch shows nightly bombarded w/ message extremely skeptical C19 vaccines. There's comparison, yet largest viewership news media outlet (including broadcast). Exactly. Especially young black person America, life covid shit. sucks now, let's pretend sunshine rainbows this. remember everyone freaking Trump likely getting reelected Covid hit.  People immunosuppressants, comfortable feeling second dose? I'm Cosentyx biologic take psoriasis. Got 2nd dose Pfizer 8:45 morning. far side effects, arm even really sore all.

Of course I've reading immunosuppressants vaccines lot it'll likely least somewhat less effective much less unknown right now. I'm obviously going wear masks public, I'm going go shove large crowds anytime soon, plan going hang friends not.

Just curious people remained cautious second dose loosened bit? Agreed it’s really shown FB old friends won’t change ways since always headline useless article makes think right. basic ( cases divided death ) prove overall death rate like 97.9 99.8 like 5 times them. Cliche rural town Florida ( it’s like 14 straight days Florida highest amount new cases ). even assumption though. live they're blasting radio TV commercials free steps sign it. can't go 20 minutes without hearing one ads. Last year planned bio breaks around walmarts large travel stops (like love's example). places always open. 

This year, everything open special advance thought bathroom breaks really needed. Britain smart demanded capacity UK would used fulfill UK order. EU done EU plants, clear overview capacity. I’m sorry idea you’re talking about? source think type product made one facility? companies already contracting facilities Rentschler, Polymun, Rovi, Recipharm Lonza. that’s name few. mention, absolutely manufacturing things last year. impossible? 

And top that, companies flat refused begin process world wide production last fall. Australians fine fellow citizens catch covid face potential death due lack medical resources India? 2 days. thing happened me. would imagine many people like husband I. fully vaccinated, since Feb. 13 month old. can't return normal quite time still. think still many fully vaxed people still trying protect others, kids otherwise. articles always days sometimes week two behind. ridiculous. polling data page updated yesterday ""raw"" : someone please link article without paywall please one didn’t mention Russian vaccine like JNJ, based adenovirus manufacturing isn’t widespread. Covaxin mentioned Indian, also inactivated vaccine like Chinese, also heavily funded Indian public money that’s important you.

And I’ve mention conveniently skip over, amount adenovirus mRNA IP waiving going get vaccine within less 3 months inactivated vaccines infrastructure already immediate use. I’m getting tomorrow. cohort lower risk (50+ male). 

It’s nothing anyway; least present. I’m still happy get it. 

Vaccination come! mean, plan stop wearing masks public anytime soon, basically ""free"" terms disease prevention. find particularly difficult breathe mask extra protection top full vaccination.

This even COVID thing. Even somehow eradicate COVID-19, longer necessary healthy people wear masks, America needs normalize ""wear mask feel sick"". (Japan Spanish Flu.) matter common courtesy. Same! I'm afraid virus, I'm afraid people (after seeing revel worst year now). demand return ""normalcy"" everyone else's timeline one example. Oregon Washington appear passed peak [respective dunno, CDC updated outdoor mask mandate Murphy still said no.  Yes lol. I'm 21 getting vaccine reason never got flu vaccine. I'm eager ever get shot, I'll fine get sick. thought would problem due prednisone got antibodies tested 2 weeks getting second shot. body made fine. assume fully immune--get tested. key me. people die illness, sad. 

When people die illness could prevented safe, free, widely available medical procedure one biggest PR campaigns modern history? drop dead feel nothing. I'm saying happy want die deserve die way. I'm simply saying hard give thought all. happened today’s NYT story herd immunity posted earlier? Annnnd many people longer smell &amp; taste properly..... give vaccines EU Countries follow EMA? 


I'd glad Country received AZ exit earlier pandemic since benefits outweigh risks almost non nordic Country.  I’d like place safely then, sure, you’re sitting stadium like actively communicating people, drinking, eating etc like you’d bar… what’s harm wearing mask? Heck, bedazzle mask sorts sports-team crap! Haha  WFH?

Edit: work home..Sorry...got it.. I'm dumb Yeah, think Boston aiming mid-June latest. mid-June, everyone 16 opportunity fully vaccinated build immunity, 2 week buffer window couldn’t get immediately. Got second shot Saturday. freaking bones hurt bad damn day Sunday Monday. even laying painful. Weak heck, cant squeeze fist. Can't make hard bicep. fever cough tho. symptoms, long expect last?  quarantine hotel can't get anyone sick... Right twice many options do. Lower uptake actually good news others around world. exports case low demand, production go less demand.  Yes vaccine still works it. Wow, almost high percentage vaccination correlates reduction COVID-19 cases deaths I'm guessing good months ago, California (especially Southern California) probably world epicenter pandemic. low amount cases lot people already vaccinated lot people already infected past months.

That's convinced parents get vaccinate.  problem travel finding open restrooms 2 hour intervals. Eventually someone car needs one. RV? Cal, traveling one county another (large counties) difficult. Feel free tweet thought:

One day, coping inability achieve herd immunity commonplace smoking. indications vaccines make significantly less likely transmit virus, number 0. There's overlap groups. people types immunity. back envelope, 44% vaxed, 25% infected, reduce vaxed 25%, add. That's perfect prior infected group probably vaccinated lower rate, either due resistance reasons. Still gets decent percentage, though, continue grow (hopefully vax side infected.) FDA approved, authorized. There’s difference.  Yeah precisely one scheduled delivery May (of 1 million doses).

It's likely we'll get another considering many currently owe us due quarter, exactly comforting already May can't tell us many vaccines they'll sending us *this* month.  got first Pfizer shot! Yaya mean idk you, August/September definitely wouldnt like go full stadium wear mask India doesn’t give dual citizenship. People lose Indian citizenship moment obtain another one. Australia essentially letting lot citizens become stateless. lot People came India attend funerals care dying relatives. cap international arrivals Australia makes nearly impossible book return flights time. Yea, people clearly ignorant manufacturers noting capacity make additional vaccines IP already. attempts shifting blame toward health experts subsequently ignored politicians supporters pretty weak. Oh, well awear

Been told many times

Pain issue Stop madness. vaccinated 1) chance getting virus extremely low. 2) good data says vaccinated person still contagious virus load non-vaccinated person spread virus equally 3) vaccinated person ALWAYS better lower risk non-vaccinated person regardless live. 

The people Australian New Zealand done great job dodging virus. remain unvaccinated, still high risk mutation getting control.

Source? moderna biontech vaccines specifically received shit ton public money. US specifically numerous pathways spread IP moderna. 

You certainly lift IP vaccines. you’re talking Russian government Chinese government. mention, moderna vaccine way better Chinese vaccine. 

If you’re going whine supply chain, lift JJ vaccine well. don’t see issue that. Exactly this. adenovirus vaccine may exist longer mRNA vaccine immunocompromised person would require immune system remove it. stays system longer may actually create reasonable immune response body longer time react it. knowledge mRNA much less stable would degrade body regardless whether body removes not.

Though similar original comment, hypothetical whatever I'm saying could completely wrong. Yet. Viruses funny little way mutating, especially rampant community spread going many places. Michigan recently set new pediatric hospitalization record.    Blame governor, pharmacy Well, submitted final approval, I'm aware vaccine has. submitted application EUA MHRA (the UK regulator). first doses leave GSK's fill finish May earliest, likely June, there's rush MHRA approve. Unless we're getting earlier shipments US line doubt. Today NPR said week!!!  I’m sorry been? part increasing vaccine production don’t get? part countries slated vaccinated 2024 don’t get? can’t keep parroting disproven silly thing. specifically said symptomatic Covid. seem assume 5% response vaccinated. isn’t correct. 

That's trials studied, that's used that. still get asymptomatically well, want even danger involved. Vaccinated people get Covid mostly mild cases. Additionally it’s virtually zero deaths. 

We know exact numbers that, trial-like double blind randomized trials it. likely also very, good, like efficiency symptomatic COVID. I've already covered chances work that. isn’t breakthrough data anymore. Israel many states similar results vaccines 

It still breakthrough data, numbers Israel hard disentangle form factors (lower community spread, demographic differences vaccinated, etc).  I've already explained breakthrough data misleading early time. It’s wrong underrepresent vaccine benefit keep fear mongering. 

So kindly please stop misrepresenting it. 95% symptomatic COVID. that's good, misrepresent it. Yeah could’ve gotten one 100,000 shots January gonna get thrown anyway, instead spend months longer waiting thrown out. extremely low risk getting serious form blood clots low platelets. confused ""normal"" blood clots like birth control pills, less serious.

The risk somewhere range 1 100 000 1 1 000 000 vaccinations, mortality rate perhaps 20%?

The issues basically discovered AstraZeneca (they use technology), although still clear rate blood clots vaccines.

However, Denmark good handling virus risk dying virus also low there, especially young. key aspect choosing stop J&amp;J AZ, together fact ordered plenty mRNA vaccines. I’ll shocked ever happens Mine turns 12 September. wait months. Isn’t like every state though? should’ve made available general public months ago. many people don’t want us would’ve gotten immediately could’ve safer sooner. think means? global south we’re still looking countries vaccinated 2024. 0.2% vaccines thus far delivered poor countries. 1/4 people well countries vaccinated. rich western countries aren’t concern next three years unless we’re talking variants created global south coming back wealthy countries. Prolly similar me. Yeah many made arms? That's much valuable number.

The people care waste people footing bill doses. care people.

There's supply issue US  Uh lmao. That's major anxiety needs therapy. course nobody see way doubt dude get help. Exactly.

At 10% growth means Covid cases double end June quadruple end august. would mean ~5000 daily hospitalizations...which still well numbers winter.

And won’t continue grow 10% anyways vaccines natural immunity continue climb. one time, band camp.. optimistic talks voluntary vaccinations might made available dropped vaccines

As opposed mandatory vaccinations? think may facing huge workman’s comp lawsuit Lolllllll thanks Doubtful dosage would make much difference. want strong long lasting immune response. tends cause reactions people. 

That's also reason second dose tends stronger - first time body seeing it. 

Will take second dose week, along rest family. Soup prepared ahead time case get knocked one cook. 

Small price pay beat shit. unvaccinated person Australia may lower chance *contracting* covid vaccinated person US, getting covid vaccinated getting unvaccinated also 2 different situations. fully vaccinated lower rate contraction (90-95%), much lower rate hospitalization (94% reduction) near-zero fatality rate covid.

You could argue benefits minimizing spread vaccinated individuals, cases high, still enough reason minimize high-transmission settings, selfish standpoint risk hospitalization death objectively quite low almost circumstance. Keep mind statistics hospitalizations deaths vaccinated people vulnerable at-risk populations, make numbers look worse would lower-risk segments population.

At point indirect health direct economic impacts strict lockdowns &amp; restrictions outweigh risks covid spread cases drop population approaches herd immunity. I’m sure US past point close it, calculus done used influence government policy.

August looking pretty far away... Otc nasal sprays even saline make huge difference antihistamines option. Denmark bought many doses many different manufacturers, including enough Pfizer/BioNTech alone vaccinate pretty much whole population (and similar amounts CureVac Moderna).

They also uniquely good position due good keeping spread down.

I would open 100% put sign says “please socially distance” discussed, manufacturing capacity issue. available capacity used, vaccine makers aggressively building - investments justified ability sell vaccines produced there.

As demonstrated time again, talking point lie. It’s entirely untrue. 


The next paragraph conservative libertarian bullshit talking point. I’m sorry reality ideology.

Unfortunately, need clicks... available? Story heard ABC news said Fall seems far Also weather pretty rainy dark shitty right Oregon Washington + Allergy season.

Never elect leaders based race, religion. mean science can't really prove anything %100 certainty we're pretty much %99.99 sure vaccines don't/can't cause cancer. case would wrong lot well established concepts biology vaccines general maybe fields too.

There mechanism vaccines cause cancer reason believe one exists. contrast, lot viruses (like covid) latent effects even known cause cancer. said response first dose 2 weeks ago, it’s entirely normal want head busy store. really come across unsympathetic can’t understand that. would ask doctor you’re worried, rashes Covid fine got Moderna shots. rashes either shot. corona last year april getting vaccine perfect late needle arm.  Presumably subjects consented. disease new argument can't give informed consent, risks less known can't see adults meaningfully consent experiment.  Hahaha neither, honestly answered question. 🤷🏼‍♀️ thank you! post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Gtfo anti vax articles still pearl clutching shout mods? I've seeing way less anti-vax nutter stuff used to. Whatever doing, keep up! Desantis effectively ended mandates October ending fines anti-maskers.

Then cases deaths reached unprecedented levels January.  own, wear makes comfortable. could preemptively take allergy meds, I'd ask actual doctor. It’s tough situation around. There’s lot Venezuelans illegally immigrating Trinidad. can’t blame better life. it’s factor driving spread. Many Windward islands isolated manage better. Nope, week two tube shoved throat ventilator. think current silence stop dick-nose crowd discarding masks lying vaccination status. Let's make sure everyone wants shot gets one.  kid 12 korean years Nah keeps repeating telling people get vaccinated, vaccinated people get together without masks. Also advising unvaccinated children go see vaccinated grandparents. manage go thru bad year still religious celebrations. spike obviously different 2020 summer since we're seeing hospitals go bad. they’re hypochondriacs. Two men Hanoi Da Nang confirmed Covid-19 Tuesday morning Vietnam dealing fresh community outbreak.

The Da Nang case, 28, resides central town Hoi Quang Nam Province come live work neighboring Da Nang since April 29.

He started show Covid-19 symptoms fever fatigue last Sunday tested positive new coronavirus next day.

The source transmission determined patient, tagged ""patient 2982.""

The Hanoi case, 26, lives Bac Tu Liem District.
He passenger sat near group Chinese experts, come work Vietnam one later confirmed Covid-19 returning back country, Vietnam Airlines flight VN160 Da Nang Hanoi April 29.

After entering Vietnam, Chinese experts sent Nhu Nguyet 2 hotel northern Yen Bai Province 14-day centralized quarantine April 9 23. samples taken coronavirus testing thrice, results negative.

After completing centralized quarantine period, group came Trung Bac Company province continued health monitored 14 days another hotel supervision local medical staff.

Yet experts left hotel visited many localities northern Vietnam April 23 25. April 28, returned China Huu Nghi border gate Lang Son Province. day later, one five experts confirmed positive virus Chinese authorities.

The group far infected 14 people, including 13 northern Vinh Phuc Province one Hanoi.

For ongoing community outbreak, Vietnam also recorded 20 cases northern provinces Ha Nam, Hung Yen, Hanoi HCMC, counted April 29.

They linked Ha Nam man returned Japan April 7 tested positive completing two-week centralized quarantine Da Nang April 21. man also failed quarantine another 14 days home required.

By April 29, Vietnam gone one month without recording new locally-transmitted Covid-19. Pfff.. get one, please? :) covid still bad Brazil? Also guy replied upsets me. ""Absolutely pointless change now"" no. new evidence data comes use it. Trust science. took medicine symptoms gone! guess stop taking meds now. Thank God big bro. Nah. We're good taking thousands athletes every corner globe pandemic. Anyone know due second dose lost vaccine card? got vaccinated Oakland Coliseum makes difference. No, he's saying. Well hope based previous mutations current vaccines provide decent immunity against. late let confederates secede? Confexit! I’ve gone 140 200 back 157 pandemic alone 

Fucked first 6 months. Exactly. live TX, county leaders made known beginning pandemic Covid prevention measures considered voluntary within county. Individuals could choose whether follow guidelines public places property. business owners free enact require customers abide prevention measures wanted confines business locations. not... entirely them. governor enacted pandemic mandates, county leaders made clear none would enforced within county limits, completely voluntary here. So, great many people living here, nothing changed all. nonessential businesses never closed bit shutdown here, many independently owned businesses never enforced mask wearing, physical distancing, occupancy limits. Restaurants dine-in, bars live music dancing. Festivals happened, church services happened, holiday events attractions happened. Sure, people cared followed prevention measures, care free go lives normal.  Please go get vaccine. given much stronger immune response vaccine much better preventing catching Covid again. time, yes, time rather, “everyone,” hit point enough people immune can’t spread aren’t immune easily.

So far, variants occasionally infect vaccinated people, like coronaviruses inconceivable one appears spread widely vaccinated population causing little hospitalization, widespread mild illness. variant ever arrives, dig people immunity, get sick.

I'm really sure looking for. Nobody thinks we're going stuck permanent Covid hell anything, nobody thinks I'm saying cause keep permanent lockdowns place. open up, people going getting sick dying covid years virus finds way unvaccinated pockets country. want least get point really sporadic little flare-ups,” said Carl Bergstrom, evolutionary biologist University Washington Seattle. “That would sensible target country excellent vaccine ability deliver long term — generation two — goal transition new coronavirus become like cousins cause common colds. would mean first infection early childhood, subsequent infections mild partial protection, even immunity wanes.

There really shift community-centered view herd immunity. I'm Michigan watching outbreak unfold, driven largely Thumb, conservative section state reason dodged previous outbreaks. virus went nuts counties. seems happening eastern halves Washington Oregon. going keep happening virus runs communities infect, could take years. state double fire prevention budget earlier year, lets see much works us lol. good news pretty much everyone masks hand least smoke wont get bad wouldn’t bet it. even US govt history skimping types payments like insurance companies. program run one largest insurance companies, Chubb, behalf US govt. missed first study topic. Seems good amount evidence building behind it. could good thing. best way convince people get vaccinated strong data applies them. one shot may less scary people two shots. Politicians bothered 1 million occurrences end media daily occurrences nobody cares about. asked one Bush Obama - refused. nah time low started 2003 Yeah, often find strange non-American. Cases thankfully decreasing, still rampant nowhere near control UK Israel even countries much fewer people vaccinated like Ireland. government paid attention random people like you, instead listening Danish health authorities, obviously doesn’t know talking about. Oh well, guess Nordic welfare model failed us yet again. fair point. true everyone thier opinion. want vaccine great, great well. still spread vaccinated? Correct I’m wrong. need vaccine stupidity

We one - called education. Never Data Israel says chances asymptomatic infection 14 days second doses reduced 94%.  supply. I'm renovating wood I'm buying fresh/green/wet could probably plant it. 

covid took ""just time"" supply/demand model, punched face lit fire. memory serves, way worked old folks... pick age group, 65+... turned 65 anytime year (so even still 64, turn 65) eligible. Maybe it'll kids?   whole story. vaccines stop catching covid, stop mutating. nuanced got vaccinated good. still need cautious high risk situations basically eradicated. still mutate way renders current vaccines less effective useless. spreads, mutates higher chance vaccines rendered less effective. 

We certainly situation begin relax, case go wild vaccinated. roughly 600K homeless people USA. Even part 8 million administered, would still 8/7.4 million severe reactions. Far fetched reasoning me. Apples oranges buddy proposals also mean people can show vaccinated recovered would subject regulation negative test result. 

So reward people getting vaccinated, able get still entitled things providing negative test. wrong approach? open quickly reward people getting it. exactly you? Well...how know daughter's teacher had/has COVID? guessing?

It's easy assumption make make true.

One first things people disgruntled lose morale work start skipping work. becomes standoff employer employee think school systems position firing teachers right   12 year identical boys home since March 2020 also spent first middle school virtual. I’m excited!! new rule started today... ""Close contact definitions changed. wearing mask person longer identified close contact. (This means close contacts school everyone wearing mask.)""

We're 3ft school btw. *Those genders going reveal themselves* /s Wholesome news. understand, basically states Brazil fallen terms covid.

For idea, Sao Paulo state (the biggest Brazil), hospitals 75% now, like almost 100% end march. 30% less people hospital April - 32.000 people March currently 21.151 today.

I saw news today one state critical situation 

I'm Brazilian Yeah anxiety I've already hanging friends outside masks stuff like gonna thing maskless cause vaccinated me. I'm last one group. like gave us permission tweet this. Thank point everyone wants vaccine one, yes, restrictions end.

You sure that? *really* see Germany something like “Being fully vaccinated good enough risk collapsing healthcare everyone also booster... way bought four boosters here’s incredibly complex strategy take less six months.“  state federal funding pulled start acting like decent humans. trial treatment prophylaxis? results published? part safety phase immunocompromised? Why? thought abundantly clear vaccine companies little liability whatever happens Yep I'm overly anxious go out. got really used peace quiet real urge give up. shopping? nope fuck I'm way happier online ability pick choose compare items 3 different tabs time looking reviews.  Movies? Nope home theater great I've watched way movies would ever go to.  Bars? Nope miss least. Gym? Nope Built almost paid based saved cancelling membership. Oh play music want work whenever want. Work? Shit I've fine home year would want change that... think that's bit backwards. we're accepting risk opening indoor dining worth it, needs mitigated somewhat, social distancing really make difference breathing air. Capacity limits would make easier contact trace make sense, probably economically damaging larger places. bobcat fire practically backyard last year going San gabriel mountains looking seeing black, lifeless pines miles fucking sad. 

I terrified years fire season. No. act early fiercely, like dumping 100x efforts, done. make leaders leader. First state get primary, set tone entire primary season election cycle. think masks optional Western countries end year. Curious evolutionary pressure could play. works harder find hosts, adapts took daughter get day opened 16+. line stupid long. automatically made appointment jab #2 day. 
We showed weeks later said jab virtually nobody there. wait, except 15/30 minutes post-shot. recognized four people stood line near us first time. CA! found odd. please add 7 year olds asap go Maui skip post landing covid test!   Ooh see. Gotcha. That's stupid. one effective measures Australia's response. still sinking feeling virus mutate something threatens modern civilization. 

Researching news mutations, nearly every article variation “Covid mutating faster originally thought”. hate doom guy point hit “Oh shit” phase mutations? already abundantly evident governments couldn’t get top original variations due small part anti-mask, anti-science/medicine movements. statistics new mutations hold up, totally fucked. 

Again, quite yet question point would people realize would downhill side civilization? like 500,000 dead US made bit difference here. UK variant made difference guess India variant make difference them. People losing family members didnt seem make difference would *any* point people would get page rid this? Herd immunity necessary end public health crisis. You’ll note American states withdrawing restrictions speak. Israel still cases flowing they’re essentially back normal. Guinea pig ass way club get dance hang people see smile again. Preferably fully vaccinated hey, I'm starved point. People going move pace. bothers you, go pound sand.  particular reason left last sentence paragraph? California continued better state, lowest per capita coronavirus case rate nation last week. Texas double California’s rate; New York, quadruple; Florida nearly six times California’s case rate. **Michigan still nation’s highest rate, 299 cases per 100,000 residents — 10 times California’s rate 29 cases per 100,000 residents.** twice much J J? think J J best choice people already covid.

Pfizer found cause blood clots well. COVID-19 Daily Update: May 3, 2021
 
New Cases: 255 (1,233,985 date) 

**New Deaths: 0 (23,914 date)**

[Current Hospitalizations: Wasn’t exactly Russians vaccines used Europe? Talking smack them? Even president won’t say vaccine taken. Actions speak louder words ever prove lol aren’t gonna get cancer 2 CT scans bs. put restrictions want (other protected classes- race, religion, gender) Federal customer. “You wear geeen t-shirt shop here” actually legal. Governor Death Sentence can’t say shit. dumbass create enemies among businesses want shit get better. Strip Joints fucking open Ft Lauderdale- Democratic area state. 

We business. I’m vaccinated, still wear mask 8 hours day- don’t know, want numbers go down. don’t want anyone else dying- it’s hard. 

We FLorida- know many people know Brazil countries suffering horribly? would want family, employees, clients. Neighbors?!?! prolong shit? don’t want local governments respond outbreak? Really?! 

Fuck. neighborhood- we’ve done well vaccinating. large gay community already knows pandemics real. wanted prove point, let communities like mine keep rules see results.

 meanwhile, store keep rules place. arsonists pose much larger threat regards fires climate change Varies widely. Ireland Nordics probably even better best American states. France Eastern Europe, especially Bulgaria really going struggle. waited hours say 250 mil. 14 dose interval. 21 dose interval suggests could higher (62%). 
In Serrana tested 30 days, results go month. honest there’s nothing worst passively languishing. medical system gets slowly choked death. evidence even we're still talking 277 cases now. enough data make accurate conclusion. appears one lucky ones severe long-term symptoms

40% symptoms. 97% symptoms severe enough require trip hospital treatment. one lucky ones, one typical ones. assuming 12-15 year olds get it. think realistic assume 12-15 vaccine approval add 2.5 3% best total population vaccinated. Hello!

I 21 years got 2 CT scans, one december another may. used check covid risks. recently found CT scans could potentially develop cancer young people. would develop cancer later life? Would upset children 100% cases? would pretty fucking fantastic step. shall see, still think giving kids vaccine EUA application irresponsible. vaccine could easily dangerous covid. still infect others

No, [you Stop spreading misinformation. 'covid anxiety.' didn’t develop environmental allergies couple years ago. might also MCAS (I Ehlers Danlos syndrome that’s major comorbidity). I’ve never heard immunotherapy environmental ones, appealing crazy, stopping pick couple things Walmart today. came person door asked wanted vaccine. heard announcement loud speaker saying stop Pharmacy get vaccine right now, another lady walking around asking people wanted it. fully vaccinated really cool see!

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* thank god Pfizer explain boomers created system? Yet, crickets! keep trying google can’t seem find straight answer. Im fully vaxxed urge everyone same—this feels like weird missed opportunity damage. got shots February. accidentally grocery shopped maskless. 7 day case average California county tenth got first vaccine. vaccine top. Antiseptic nose spray. Zinc lozenges. 40 mg melatonin everyday. Propolis sprays. Vitamins. Three masks. I’m like fuck it. pain vaccines like month half total. only... :) Guess depends line business. 26 people, soon 28 we’ve smashed quarterly goals exceeded profits last 6 months. anything, teams much happier overall. think we’ll wearing masks 2023 2025? What’s likely outcome Herd immunity doesn’t seem likely?  Finally! Live Tacoma? Yes I'm definitely group. feel like end month adults enough free access first second vaccine I'm gonna stop caring altogether around then. vaccinated June 2021 want be. onus protect health point, already part protect refuse get vaccinated expect cry funeral die covid. (edit: comment United States already see coming comments. see you. Save breath, save strawman arguments) still murky whether kids spread less adults, likely studies using methods demonstrated infection rates children similar observed adults. evidence suggests differences susceptibility children adults entirely due lack testing children likely asymptomatic show mild symptoms

I sorry That’s good question. Pfizer said expect apply first half year, would mean would apply month. Well, bad getting better. cases deaths fallen like 20% first time since November.

The said transmission rate fell 1,06 0,93. idea, even Germany rate transmission higher.

As said, good things get better soon, hope. almost 50 million doses vaccine administrated. Brazil capacity vaccine much more, seeing perspective government basically vaccines measures control covid, good.   mother two identical twelve year olds home since March 2020, freaking excited! too, I'm 38. Let know hits prepare! **No** manage 8 people and, asked, loudly proclaim productive wfh. reality, however, barely 1/3 are. We've simply lowered expectations, eased deadlines, held starting scheduled projects pandemic. We've slowly started increasing expectations last month flailing hard, pushing back much yet still, somehow, think deserve wfh jobs. wouldnt really explain increased intensity fire seasons states &amp; countries. enough controlled burns definitely contributes much seem think  That's nice idea, people reject solid proof vaccination (that CDC card easily forged), can't really select who's gotten didn't. documented cases reinfection. offers high rate protection reinfection across population complete protection individuals may old immune disorders. Reinfection isn’t common it’s unheard of. See Amazon city Manaus. got hammered herd immunity. Got hammered second time variant P1 later on. 

Get vaccinations people!

Edit: Manaus link... recent allotment vaccines, vaccines overall. imagine many states similar position interest declining. time start cold calling people offering transportation scheduling get vaccine?  It’s really interesting see people’s perspectives (or comfort levels) fully vaccinated. 

Case point vs one girl I’m friends Facebook. 

I’ve shots, I’m comfortable normal stuff (yes keep wearing mask it’s right thing yes hate it). Like mom ate restaurant moms birthday today felt comfortable. 

On hand, there’s girl I’m Facebook friends shared post Ron Desantis signed ending executive orders (which tad early IMO, Desantis I’m surprised god hope Florida votes next year) like “well I’m going keep staying grocery delivery”. Granted baby makes sense, she’s also fully vaccinated little freedom say sister still airhead getting shots. 

This going really fascinating watch people navigate like fully vaccinated life next couple months.  400lbs 12yo slightly higher normal BMI unless talking 12 year old gorilla. I'm pretty sure talking humans, case 400, excessively overweight ANYONE, especially 12 year old child. always get much comments headlines. Thank perspective! Australian, feels pretty relatable. quite possibly worst ever fire season COVID. Way overhyped lol, everyone hyping ""double mutant"" indian variant already proven vaccines work Killed duty cop 69% everything else contract Novavax even signed yet even deliveries expected large quantities Q4-Q1 2022. lot people wanting J&amp;J, export 100% countries, heck export J&amp;J india we're good Moderna Pfizer hoard J&amp;J one wants it. 4/5 friends randomly chatted gotten vaccines say they're scared can't opt J&amp;J. Luckily got moderna 2 dose. offered J&amp;J would refused, reason 100% J&amp;J can't exported Thank much. really 'suffer' though, knew would switch spring, trade longer intervals. longer interval scheme worked fantastically, covered vulnerable groups responsible 95% deaths less half time ultimately saved thousands lives.

That's win.  hard feel good knowing many walking refuse get shot. Living MN I've got better lot still. I've got nephews nieces etc still feel could walking danger. I'm two weeks second shot tomorrow now. means data fully vaccinated act carriers long asymptomatic virus linger mind. Maybe there's I've seen yet try pretty hard stay stuff. Yes. great allowed us give last 65+ crowd az shot, meaning could save 200000 doses pfizer younger demographics speed rollout 60+ group, went incredibly quickly, might add. one thinks getting 50%+ adults least one shot great fucking achievement? That’s massive portion population. Back December/January quick gate. Im jusy going polls

[Gen Z Interest COVID-19 Vaccine Plummets Country Reopens, New Poll Covid-19 vaccine push, one speaking Gen Z’s polls get outdated quickly vaccine efforts havent concentrated Gen Z could something it. article says that. Well depends data source, UK still ahead per person 7 day average. One Germany ahead 0.04 vaccinations per 100. Iowa actually right line national average per-capita vaccination rate, outright exceeding weeks. Uh....cause kids get covid too? can't wait get 4 9 year old boys vaxxed unknown. unknown causes fear. I'm little bummed getting second shot weeks. huge homebody COVID I've really enjoyed ready-made excuse stay home. I'm fully vaccinated, excuse hang in-laws? Hell yeah! I’m 15 I’ve waiting forever. Approved authorized emergency use? 330 million...roughly. prevent hospitalizations deaths.

The primary way preventing infections, least serious infections. need calculate infection rates fully vaccinated order get clear concise picture happening.

Also, could tell source percentages? normal times, it'd essay instead paragraph nation 12-15 year olds demographic kids likely frequently mixing crowds public help us lot getting transmission thinned enough get back normal quicker post upvoted 6 trillion times? entirely agree. lack vaccination sucks, first-world problem. inefficient stock every pharmacy country week's supply vaccine, we're probably going anyway. Meanwhile we're entering summer already-declining cases stable medical systems, much rest world *really* needs vaccines *now*. last main point - every anti-vaxxer one dose someone else needs more. variant California since least 4/3 - think wife also might overreacting. background, would love perspective: live Los Angeles, fully vaccinated 10 yo twins vaccinated bc approved age. Wife 50 MFTR (this classify immuno compromised help). Since kids vaccinated comfortable sending back school even school starts back fall. part sort understand. However, also ok us go outdoor restaurant, visiting fully vaccinated families (their kids vaccinated) people house fully vaccinated. supposed travel Spain late July canceled trip bc also comfortable flying w kids. So, go camping August California instead. ok seeing mom unvaccinated (my mom QaAnoner why). So, sum up, ok going restaurants, fully vaccinated people over, going anywhere beach hiking trails kids fully vaccinated. think qualifies Covid Anxiety? I've pretty cautious whole time. going places outdoors, n95 inside, etc 

My wife took first flight year half felt strange, cathartic. love travel refreshing able again. said still wore n95s whole time, used nasal sanitizer pre-travel used counter rapid test got home seeing daughter.

I think, me, good see people living life. seen much lately gave sense much needed normalcy.  Sweden seems poised hit average 100k day well. 130k last friday. wish piss bonfire; however, all-time low zero? 6 months yet except ~15k trials. Within months, though, 6 months data literally tens millions people. Soon that, hundreds millions. Safety data collected tremendously fast, rate collected also rising. Ive 1 CT scan year past 5 years. fine Q propaganda. entering masses now. Oh doesn’t bode well places haven’t vaccinated 40%. 

Get vaccinated people! study Brazil yet (I guess we'll get Serrana). 
But Chile.  

16% efficacy covid, 35% efficacy hospitalization, 42% efficacy ICU, 40% efficacy deaths.  

Although would say harder get proper efficacy rate first dose interval pretty short (28 days, protects 15-20 days first dose...).
And see Johnson (and cohort Brazil¹), efficacy grows overtime. 

1 *Estimated effectiveness 50.7% (95% CI: 33.3-62.5%); 51.8% (95%CI: 30.0-66.0%); 68.4% 
(95%CI: 51.0-80.8%); 73.8% (95%CI: 57.0-84.8%) 2021 epi weeks 9, 10, 11, 12, 
respectively. weeks correspond 2, 3, 4, 5 weeks 2nd dose CoronaVac, 
respectively.* actually does. Or, least it’s big part it. 

The TL;DR back olden days, fires used regularly come landscapes clear dry undergrowth/debris leaving many established plants. 

Then, got really good fighting fires started putting whenever could matter federal state policy. 

So, debris undergrowth built up, fire comes there’s much heat devastates everything. 

We’ve finally (mostly) recognized error ways, variety factors (lack funding support, people liking smoke planned burns, many houses, etc) we’re far behind prescribed burns. 

Timber Wars really good it. Great news! sure can't drive shit, Connecticut folks good work drive thing back. I'm member family who's vaccinated. rest terrified it

But they're still planning ton vacations remainder year. tell get shot first, get ""you're kid, I'm parent"" treatment

They budge pls - Canada Pay (or offer relevant trade) get vaccinated. can't rationally debate insane people, still bribe smart thing add year (depending age) onto lives. 380 million Americans right? fair amount coverage. always hear kids health issues COVID pose risk group disease, flu? fun allowed headline fucking ridiculous tiresome. Children account cases adults vaccinated. higher percentage concentrated children better. Source 40% reduction testing please Colorado may first days decline. should’ve clear comment, it’s second Pfizer dose didn’t even “choose” Pfizer, facility went gives Pfizer. 

I’ve signed second dose coming Sunday now. know I’m gonna get silly comment lol First all, I'd get second dose time soon after, regardless. card piece paper need worry much.

But able get replacement card. Call original place ask them. probably differs state. around inch shorter is. rate growing, pass within next 6 months so. sometime know &amp; next vaccine approved be?

As far know Novavax supposed coming longest time - 2 dozen vaccines phase 3... FWIW, IL issue today pharmacies, like Walgreens, report doses. know states affected. Manaus never herd immunity. using IFR covid deaths rates never 40% infected. False positives PCR ""in theory"" impossible. Yet, course, keep happening. likely answer sample contamination - requires infected person vicinity sample, flat rate go away nobody infected. I’d argue one saying reason, people arguing isn’t immediately perceived incentive instant gratification kind way Thank I'll try Driving CT scan potentially cause fatal car accidents. look precise risk level? Mine big enough well, like might well considered 12 one. think makes bad parent wanting to, see would proper documentation records. Cause fill paperwork kinds info , insurance u might have, ssn, etc. F*ck coworker! freaking idiot probably would vote bolsonaro chance

Edit: sorry words, I’m tired seeing people denying covid FWIW land incorrect visa, etc usually airline return next flight. (They may try recover costs later) Presumably Indian Airline would deny boarding first place knew passenger would rejected customs. deport person either a) end detention India b) come agreement embassy Australia would take care quarantine. guess depends much bad pr Australia would thing would get it. probably resources handle random people trying sneak back in, special case like I'm sure could meet plane quarantine. Probably something like plane disembark via stairs go terminal. Europe US bought billions vaccins need themselves. would expect vaccins end less rich countries.

India, China Russia also producing lots vaccins, appears everyone competing gets send vaccins where.

It's ideal, probably fast go. miracle richer countries least trying somewhat disease still raging home.

I think take 2024. take time, billions people vaccinate.

The concern variants real, annotation vaccinated variant ever dangerous original virus was.  TSA extended mask mandate public transportation September, would surprised flu season. expect able get public transportation without mask least March 2022. sometime know &amp; next vaccine approved be?

As far know Novavax supposed coming longest time - 2 dozen vaccines phase 3...  immune COVID-19 said so.  10% 16 17 year olds gotten vaccinated eligible weeks now. probably see 10% 15% 12 15 age group too. 77 dog years What?! long? way. even think we'll even wearing second half year 2022. approved lmao 

they’re giving emergency authorization Hearing young children India Brazil dying Covid shows young people invincible like previously thought   enough people want it. even going make 60%. Germany probably top around 70% well confounding variable that, fda probably approving pfizer 12-15 year olds next week, theres question enough pfizer juice everyone wants one. given fact ""certain states"" declining huge amounts vaccines due low demand, id bet answer ""yes enough pfizer juice everyone"" Maybe it’s fears unvaccinated people claiming they’re vaccinated feel power taken away people anything now. There’s also lot premature lifting mandates happened, like Texas, feel like push even wrong direction. I’ve pretty much stopped wearing mask work mountains see almost one. still chin case run situation need quickly. Wednesday two weeks 2nd dose I’ll still play safe store wear mask. I’m nervous getting plane still probably cases next zero. get science don’t really feel ready go back yet. I’m really rush join society messed shit last year. sometime know &amp; next vaccine approved be?

As far know Novavax supposed coming longest time - 2 dozen vaccines phase 3... Ain’t truth! It’s huge %, covers middle high schools huge potential spread, would probably help quite bit. 14 weeks *after first jab*. Remember UK 12 weeks jabs.  sure considering it. bad? It’s risk tolerance versus his/her. Mine too. He’s easily big enough wouldn’t make nervous get shot... plans visit Orlando fall. Considering vaccinated go, somewhere dr office. make terrible parent? yea nuanced answer yes, spread even youre fully vaccinated, similarly, still catch even fully vaccinated. however, chances either happening minimal best get information like that? believe correct term catastrophizing. know Germany going continue speed right close gap weeks go by.  say “variant B.1.617 super spreaders reason severity second wave” Um, please read thread, research.

Cooperative R&amp;D, sharing knowledge, help production indeed initial plan. BMGF one major players opposed this, eventually helped scuttle it.

&amp;#x200B;

You might think ""IP laws"" important, money important lives poor, brown people, keep ind mutations globalised world eventually spread everywhere, case. One also sheer self-interest. Idiots Walking Around? tons universities requiring tons 18-22 yos college getting it...how manage go day thought processes like that? Locking people left right doesn’t anything police state? Lol 
Get real  Yes, much :(

That's 0,225% total population 1 year take account excess mortality.

But US far 0,215% countries worse numbers:

In Peru already 0,505% died direclty indirectly Covid-19 according excess mortality.

Bulgaria 0,44%, Albania 0,394%, Czech Republic 0,358%, Mexico 0,357%, ...

 [The 30 worst hit countries Covid-19 pandemic according excess mortality 2020 April 2021 - I'm feline either. wait? Take whatever available you, vaccines work. Unfortunately think correct. many people won’t get vaccine all, bailing second shot avoid “possibly” feeling day two. I’m U.S. can’t speak rest world it’s sad. fine. get daily years end, mind. Everyone ignores deaths send help. Either fearless helpers use medical equipment see bullshit saying. Sounds like win-win situation. Yes no... Yes government funds health care system, adverse events paid them. highly doubt able seek damages like wrongful death claim.

The vaccines also still approved. Theyr deployed standard program. What's unclear one would opt in... read go doctor convince authorize discussion risk. mean standard weekend UK two day long ?

Or students. “With masks”. God, hate Chicago. probably last state still masks. Yep. concerns. Damn ya'll hitting Israel numbers. Still summer 7 day average. open state? isnt true. schools shit show worldwide. kids dont care, about. I'm saying logic let 64 year olds get wrong. logistics easier let schedule. vaccine approved 16/18+ first, never medically age 64 65. someone 15 turning 16 can't get birthday. 
Personally, care 15 11 y.o. gets it. Ah yes bad isrealnationalnews site reporting this... You’re right, weekly increase rather concerning. wasn’t trying downplay numbers rather explain stating percentage increase decrease seem alarming numbers low (single digits) explained statistical noise natural fluctuation, yeah you’re right case here. Mayday bank holiday always first Monday start May, always leads three-day weekend. bank holidays except Christmas/New Year (and four day weekend Easter). agoraphobic tendencies, thanks panic disorder. pandemic done favors. fully vaccinated less month, slowly trying come out. met friend outdoor mall last weekend, sat restaurant took mask! First time since March 2020.  Nothing wrong wearing mask comfort level. like, I’m fine going vaccinated friend’s place dinner anyone problem that, they’re literally anti-science Dropping J&amp;J apparently caused 2-week delay Denmark's ""Vaccinationskalender"". expect abundance Biontech Moderna doses Q3.

How explain 275587 excess deaths 2020 pandemic weeks?

[Painel de análise excesso de mortalidade por causas naturais Brasil em 2020 source Brazil (Conselho Nacional de Secretários de Saúde).

rickk79's coworker either blind stupid... need downvote comment. That’s likely recent poll taken.

[Carnegie Mellon showed 34% vaccine hesitancy Gen Z, highest amongst age groups.

The timeline moving fast course hesitancy go people get there’s better outreach everyone. Yes correct. Let's give J&amp;J homeless export rest. Germany expects minuscule deliveries CureVac. What's expected number doses Q2 Sweden?  Awesome! Thanks! seatbelts cut risk fatal car crashes 45%, yet still probably drive around wearing one. Pfizer better producing tons, hope world vaccinated asap 💖 Kill bug (even say unlikely still want optimism, thanks) comfortable wearing masks you’re vaccinated. wonder Denmark Sweden completely skipping J&amp;J rare side effect. J&amp;J shot essential part EU vaccination campaign. Even US approved age groups would totally get away without using all. people say follow science actually following personal anxieties drooping CDC guidelines align them.

Now mask guidelines relaxing vaccinations go continue shown effective, anxious doomposters latching onto every little thing continue giving rationality insane levels personal lockdown subjected year now. Correct I’m wrong wouldn’t “all time low” covid hospitalization in, say, 2018? Okay. you. I'd ask 11 year old. Worst they'll say no. CureVac next one. According Italian press, approved end May. There's absolutely nothing says ""drop mask mandates"" quote given: Key word, ""easing restrictions"" 

""Chapek said outlook parks “really going determined rate vaccination public.” also said, “And could accelerate expectations, give people confidence need come back parks. overlap know herd immunity? Sure will. believe we’ll state 6 foot social distance mask-wearing 22? Absolutely not.”""

And one said think masks scenarios gone end year. Chapek confirmed even year Disneyland best case scenario. Cases probably low summer anyways due seasonality, long we’re number fall surge okay. round applause people sticking tests lions nose losing limbs. That’s incorrect. Florida made vaccine passports, businesses asking proof vaccination customers, illegal. stop military, schools, employers requiring vaccines. gotta real brave stick testing swab q tip lion’s nose it’s feeling sick grumpy. Luckily Chuck Norris world’s greatest vet. medical purposes  get stat ""fully vaccinated"" ""first dose""? Funny see Swedish Grammy winner named press. Even Swedish press called “Older man guitar”. necessarily. 16-17 year old largely make choices whether vaccinated, younger kids/teens taken doctor parents. Plus, like 90% older teens vaccines interest getting vaccinated. some, might true, also way logistical nightmare vaccinate teens, especially since need bring parent them. vaccination rates go time. Gotta let people know baby brayden/jayden/cayden/hayden/raiden/scorpion coming Please hurry up, want travel Japan least next year. holding year :(  Yeah lands weekend rolls Monday 3 day weekends uncommon. Two May use leave right usually get weeks without using annual leave. sure vaccination rates plummeting cliff? gonna longer. sorry hear daughter, hope gets better. Living India, I'm happy guys, also EXTREMEMLY jealous right now!

The condition absolutely fucking horrible here. Bruh. one going let summer pass us elderly vaccinated. Luckily vast majority one shot June current rate. least Sweden we’re 1% day now, hopefully 70% come around late June, assuming taht actually give 2nd shots already vaccinated. Right? Pfeizer study done now. Data excellent. 

Sorry trying protect children global pandemic!!! I’m terrible mom. 

WA surplus vaccines. taking anyone. I’m lucky live place excess vaccines instead somewhere ravished pandemic. I’m taking granted; I’m getting vaccinated.   take unless permission land. It'd discussed diplomatically, exceptions would likely made. Otherwise guess Australia may offer pay fee something person incarcerated time India deported. put house arrest embassy restrictions lifted. Private malls, private amusement parks like Disney, private music concerts, going dealing lawsuits liabilities things continue sell demand high. Yes start increasing %'s 25-50% eventually 100% masks thing.

You think Disneyworld says, ""You must wear mask""? demand go anything? absolutely not. ....

You go outside get hit car. say ""what expect living police state?"" sound silly?

You bad night, can't sleep well, wake next day feeling grumpy. say ""what expect living police state?"" sound silly?

A people expect quarantined fully vaccinated still got quarantined people close proximity tested positive. say ""what expect living police state?"" sound silly?

I say one last time. smart. cynical certainly infantile. Otherwise look like buffoon rather someone contribute HK's path freedom. Fascinating! Please Stockholm follow suit. uptake terrible now. want shot party come summer. People still doubting based DeSantis. think lion Tell friends book vax CVS, show location vaccine. think false assumption. know lot people vaccinated, think anyone thinks going cost pocket. know state require id insurance vaccine. ask can't require deny anyone lack it. proof vaccine afterwards though, yes-that could tricky part. unintentionally racist it’s almost funny least bit appropriate. normal. I'm meds, wish so-called professionals clear, truthful, willing help. Instead deceiving people telling get negatively impacted go screw themselves. Right, I'm saying medical purposes consider ""I'm going 12 time 2021"" count 12 2021. Like people turn 65 October 2021 able get vaccinated 65+ became eligible back January/February despite actually 64. considered 65. stubborn, South would finally kicking North's ass something.

Still emergency use like everyone else? Correct. FDA covers vaccine liability United States - hence article title. also incredibly strict authorization.  Sinovac? (Real question, achieve immunity today people convinced work)  day every year ?

Because assuming labour day holiday Saturday .

It would mean guys could potentially three day weekend every year. TBH, lot anxious types could go rest life see hear again. would bet it, next vaccine approved Western World probably Curevac one, since started rolling review procedure February.

They aim end May/June EU iirc Eh think people tired “lockdowns”. think people seeing past notice businesses affected restrictions happen small businesses. little guy shut Home Depot, department store, etc hasn’t felt even little pain whole pandemic. I’m sorry facts twist. said expect living police state. pretty straightforward statement Yes. CT taxes everything. would tax “your shit” could. state embarrassing.

Haven’t gotten vaccine yet...  Everyone masks last year though Children risk Hep B, that's required. agree happen FDA approval, think make list. Ngl think government dropping ball they’re updating guidelines vaccinated people. know people mentality “why would get vaccine? government tell finally 6 feet apart another vaccinated individual middle forest without mask?” 

Like get need bit conservative, large portion needs vaccinated already haven’t wearing masks while, maybe bit aggressive. 1. polls use NBC source. necessarily knocking NBC, know much track record, can't count separate sources.
2. particular poll surveyed 2,200 people. that's pretty small sample size compared studies. I've heard lot teens waiting final exams also. fires distant memory, yet talk world good month two...then COVID really hit. Why’s that? 👎 sensationalized headline makes sense, 👍 good news!   Huh, never thought would wonder someone Tory going BLM 'defund police' bollocks. got second pfizer shot today way. 2 weeks I'll staying home. 3 kids cannot get vaccinated yet. think you‘re comparing vaccines Medication? apples oranges. Medication doses changes travel bloodstream, needs different doses depending persons size (compare effects alcohol small/large people). 

Vaccines create cell response, educates immune system create right antibodies get sick quickly. education active ingredient vaccine large, dose small already. far know, might different vaccine sizes different age groups, best guess case vaccine didn‘t time test extensively. 

I 100% sure right also sure also 100% applies mRNA-vaccines, understanding.

Given problems already experienced across vaccines production, sure spreading engineers thinner would lead production? I'm sure.

## Abstract 

#### Introduction

Hypercoagulability thrombosis caused COVID-19 related higher mortality rate. limited data antiplatelet effect, aimed evaluate impact aspirin add-on therapy outcome patients hospitalized due severe COVID-19.

#### Materials methods

In cohort study, patients confirmed diagnosis severe COVID-19 admitted Imam Hossein Medical Center, Tehran, Iran March 2019 July 2020 included. Demographics related clinical data hospitalization recorded. mortality rate patients considered primary outcome association aspirin use assessed.

#### Results

Nine hundred ninety-one patients included 336 patients (34%) received aspirin hospitalization 655 ones (66%) not. Comorbidities prevalent patients receiving aspirin. Results multivariate COX proportional model demonstrated significant independent association aspirin use reduction risk in-hospital mortality (0.746\[0.560-0.994\], P=0.046).

#### Conclusions

Aspirin use hospitalized patients COVID-19 associated significant decrease mortality rate. prospective randomized controlled trials needed assess efficacy adverse effects aspirin administration population. article protected copyright. rights reserved. 1800s, period 1 3 deaths United Kingdom caused tuberculosis.

Covid transmission people likely greater amount virus gets body. like get single virus particle body get sick. need certain amount viral load survive body's immune system point becoming infectious. 

That means room someone covid vs without mask, with-a-mask situation inhaling less airborne covid person, would less likely become carrier. make mortality rate Covid Brazil? numbers India trustworthy before, make absolutely sense. new cases deaths following exact trend, time.

I hear (no judgement like that's fine) sounds miserable I'm extroverted. can't wait crowded ass bars again. Going weekend trips friends going place place, meeting people, seeing what's there. That's would like I'm sure sounds miserable well. like party even pandemic.  Seems like NC getting similar place. 15yo eagerly watching news approval, we're wondering formulation 12-15yo group maybe different dosage. formulation, mean less wait time we've seen around later adult groups... think. Can't find anything article whether formula not. Anyone see something provides detail? 16yo show ID, clinic's computer. took word it.

With said, I'm lie younger kid's age seeing PG-13 movie, safety efficacy, last thing I'd want create risk harm wait months.

The ages 6-11 approval expected September. takes longer that, we'll grateful jump gun. Ideally get point 100% cases vaccinated people... similar family member thinks anything government bad, yet family member every form welfare available. I’ll never understand reconcile that. unexpected good news encountered stubborn met native Nutmegger. It’s amazing many people refer pragmatic approach scared.

It's projection. terrified trying hard act like not. Therefore, everyone else must terrified, too. false bravado. Well considering age group would 5 12 he's barely one doubt we'll waiting 4 years. Vaccines way achieve herd immunity. avoid deaths main approach takes. Pfizer started 6-11 trial end March. They're concerned effective dosage safety, since high confidence safety due method function. Wild take bud. Large molecule cell line different small chemical compound. Genius. worry since can't talk tell feeling bad. least school age kid could tell you. still going school, sports, events like nothing changed adults staying home can’t anything seen actual explosion cases is, think calling ""2nd wave"" ""explosion"" accurate.

Not really reason change anything right even though risk small. Like thing missing concerts happening anyway.   School Cuomo literally waiting De Blasio set date, one-up him.

Cuomo allow NYC reopen July 1 spite DeBlasio. two hate undermine chance get. example, Cuomo getting sexual harassment attention, DeBlasio amongst first call resignation. 

Also, numbers looking really good Cuomo easily justify fine open earlier. don’t disagree. flu really mess younger people. I’m arguing flu vaccines required school.. aren’t currently flu risky little ones. CT report Saturday/Sunday positives weekend instead rolls Monday numbers, weird spike Monday, decrease rest week. Right 2% positivity rate, added 41 hospitalizations since Friday (342 total) 15 deaths period. case number accumulated based probable confirmed cases, positive test required added total; screws analyzing rate vs. states. 

Iowa, slightly smaller population less population density, 4% positive average 7 days, 231 new cases since weekend 12 deaths time frame (showing zero weekends Monday, think reporting lag). Iowa showing something around 44% one dose vaccine around 35% fully vaccinated. note here: Iowa runs far fewer tests CT counts lab-confirmed cases totals. reporting differences probably skewing numbers bit.

Overall, high vaccination rate, low positivity, still require masks retail outlets statewide Iowa's governor pulled back restrictions February, restrict localities instituting mask requirements; several cities still mandates place, probably suppressing spread populated areas. disparity new cases deaths, CT number people hospital already (I'm trouble finding Iowa's total hospitalizations time frame), COVID cases usually take one two weeks go symptoms death. possible CT see another major spike deaths whatever immunity vaccines offer wears off. Cases probably always continuing climb, slowly, kids get vaccinated dumber citizens figure get implanted microchips give reluctance get vaccinated well. Really? Novavax seems much closer.  states countries also behind controlled burns. California drier weather trees. learn accept that. It’s hard accept children though. really think risk/benefit analysis kids air this. wonder “fun vacation Florida” included Disney, gives absolutely exemptions masks. point ""vaccine hesitancy,"" vaccine unwillingness. vaccine stupidity, maybe.

You gamble kid's lives want, free country definitely support right that. I'm going play safe, case. US planning nationwide vaccine passport system?

Because that's effectively Israel has. Want go restaurant club? need vaccinated proof negative test.

People need stop overly broadly applying Israel's ""knee-bend"" point country implementing type policies have. Weird UK favored first doses absolutely knocked pandemic out. What?? current Pfizer trials (for 6mo. 11 yr old) go well age brackets, child eligible vaccine end year. Lol first sentence article would made better number children contracting COVID-19 U.S. much lower record highs set start new year  town, high schools used vaccination centers general public. doesn’t seem realm possibility. Same, need entertainment. ""started little bit""? ""It mass vaccination little bit""? 

Let's put way: considering abilities country, swedish vaccination going catastrophically bad. well behind EU average, countries behind Sweden Germany picking pace Sweden not. 7 EU countries managed vaccinate even less Sweden, according another thread here, due pathetic panic AZ J J vaccines, Sweden shot target giving everyone dose well September. sound like ""a month ahead schedule"".

So yeah, great news happen 55 59 year old living Kalmar. Huh. thinking back several months, wave ""Stop saying 'herd immunity' vaccine"" articles, like [this idea herd immunity, phrase that’s used use vaccination. vaccinate certain amount population able protect rest population isn’t able get vaccine,” Maria Van Kerkhove, head World Health Organization’s emerging diseases zoonosis unit, told CNN’s “New Day” Thursday.

But guess context *is* vaccine widespread use, make calculation including natural immunity? \~74% US adults 50 received least one dose 
\~67% US adults 40 received least one dose 
\~58% US adults received least one dose

\~70% US adults immunity (vaccine previous infection + vaccine) 
\~61% entire US population immunity  awesome. would great colleges would coming year. hope I'm wrong something tells see lot flu people making lost time socially. longer government/media stay stalemate antivaxxers longer rest us normal people suffer.

Dr. Lewis gives soft sell sometimes works. patient say, “So going give vaccine now?”
He respond, “I don’t here.” patient shuts down. “Then I’m going take it.”

The subject makes husband, Rev. David Smith, even uncomfortable. “Honestly, wish people wouldn’t ask,” said, chatting Wednesday night prayer Tusculum Baptist Church. “I think it’s none business. it’s dividing people.”

As beautiful Appalachian spring unfurls across northeastern Tennessee, Covid-19 vaccine tearing apart friends, families, congregations, colleagues. “It’s muddy mess,” said Meredith Shrader, physician assistant, runs events venue husband, another pastor, notes choice become much health care. “Which voice listen to?”

Communities like Greeneville surroundings — rural, overwhelmingly Republican, deeply Christian, 95 percent white — radar President Biden American health officials, efforts vaccinate U.S. population enters critical phase. places polls show resistance vaccine entrenched. campaigns aimed convincing Black Latino urban communities set aside vaccine mistrust made striking gains, towns like also convinced country achieve widespread immunity.
Betty Smith husband, Pastor David Smith, Tusculum Baptist Church, worry vaccine become divisive issue community.
surveys suggest. People say politics isn’t leading driver vaccine attitudes. common reason apprehension fear — vaccine developed haste, long-term side effects unknown. decisions also entangled web views bodily autonomy, science authority, plus powerful regional, somewhat romanticized self-image: don’t like outsiders messing business.

According state health department statistics, 31 percent vaccine-eligible population Greene County gotten least one dose Covid vaccine, still Tennessee overall, one lowest rates country, far Centers Disease Control Prevention’s national tally 55 percent. many older residents inoculated, eligibility open adults, vaccination sites almost desolate.

Still, conversations show many people, resistance firm. Roiled internet fallacies, many hunger straightforward information people trust. Others practical needs, like paid time recover side effects, Biden administration urged employers offer, opportunity get shot doctor.

What’s also lacking groundswell might encourage hesitant make leap: Many people gotten vaccinated remaining tight-lipped.

Greene County carpeted hundreds evangelical churches range steepled 19th-century edifices backroads barns. People scrape subsistence farming, jobs small factories, welfare checks cash flow retirees moving onto cheap, vista-blissful land. Drug busts heroin methamphetamine sustain humming cottage industry lawyers bail bonds services.

Covid smacked region hard winter. Eleven people Jim Rita Fletcher’s extended circle died it.

But no, Fletchers, lifelong Greenevillians, get vaccine.

What’s point, ask? government still wants wear mask indoors. “I don’t see benefits,” said Mrs. Fletcher, couple waited see family doctor.

Neither science statistics new vaccine daunt them. retired 70s, Mr. Fletcher telecom engineer, Mrs. Fletcher, secretary accounting clerk.

But Fletchers, Free Baptists, worry vaccine includes aborted fetal parts (it doesn’t). don’t trust government, convinced long manipulated Covid case numbers.

“I think hornswoggled,” Mr. Fletcher said.

Before going doctor, many people phone Mr. Cross. doctor’s medicines don’t seem working.

Mr. Cross, lectures around country Rwanda preventive wellness, studying advanced degree naturopathic medicine. shop evokes themes dear Appalachians, people calling early April weeks “redbud winter” — spring chill redbud trees swell mauve-pink blossoms. store wall lined Mason jars filled herbaceous plants like jewelweed, passionflower elderberry, Appalachians taught use Cherokee.

He scoffs perception people vaccine-hesitant simply they, like him, Republicans.

“That doesn’t make sense me,” said. “Trump brought vaccine in.” political affiliation, continued, “you’d jump take it!” Instead, said, people think vaccine entwined politics.

In Appalachia, Mr. Cross explained, fervor people sidestep vaccine ratcheted history tradition. centuries, Scots-Irish settlers tucked mountains evade army conscription tax collectors.

Jeremy Faison, longtime Republican state representative grew area, agrees: “Throughout pandemic, lot us like, ‘It’s serious situation family take care ourselves.’ ”
Mr. Faison, libertarian evangelical Christian, added, “So take exception government putting mandates us, pressuring us something.”
That view bolstered religious, near-joyous fatalism. People say haven’t caught Covid year pandemic, take chances. True, might get Covid die. either way, win-win: longer life Earth or, faithful, eternal life Heaven.
“There’s time appointed every person die,” said Reuben Smucker, Mennonite pastor Greeneville works garage-door installer. “We take care bodies physically, emotionally spiritually, it’s time go it’s Covid, well then, it’s time go.”
After Mr. Cross, elder Seventh Day Adventist Church, counsels Covid patients, prays them. “That’s important thing,” said. “Because it’s God healing.”

Yup. extreme vigilance cost actual science spread countries well. basing calculations [danish stats stats country (USA?) many times higher case fatality ratio Denmark. Likely country test far less less healthy population.

That vaccinating 12-15 year olds soon really help things get moving. Schools cesspools.

So tired fear mongering headlines. there's anything need right now, optimism. vaccines approved teenagers - Pfizer - wouldn’t vaccinate announced two weeks ago:

*A Tax Credit Small- Medium-sized Businesses Fully Offset Cost Paid Leave Employees Get Vaccinated Recover After-Effects Vaccination. Thanks President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, paid leave tax credit offset cost businesses nonprofits fewer 500 employees 80 hours (i.e. 10 work days) $511 per day paid sick leave offered April 1 September 30, 2021. tax credit allow employers provide paid leave employees get COVID-19 vaccination time employees may need recover vaccination cost employer. tax credit apply nearly half private sector employees America.*

Good employers want encourage vaccination amongst staff...They there. heard peep day announced, however. would like see something point like bonus check mail... Maybe $300-$500. They’re taking jabs! Interesting, complex, take Hastings Harvard law professors. understanding employment US largely ""at-will"" therefore terminated really reason. legal precedent prevents termination getting vaccine, related precedent said employers make call. Also, EEOC sided employers may exclude employees refuse vaccination without cause. others took it?

Given polarized nature pandemic, wonder kind thing encourage greater unionization among political leanings recently less pro-union. reassure me, thanks trying. 

My trust public health damaged irreversibly. included full-text article comments  fully understand this, seem really cool.

That’s terrifying. That’s something people don’t seem understand: enough go around nightmare scenario. R vaccines available u live u dont want one? messaging sucks. Really sucks. CDC needs hire advertising agency help messaging.

My GF ""fully vaccinated"" today. weekend, dumps wanted go see Demon Slayer anime movie left theaters. said, ""So go? vaccinated."" (I've ""fully vaccinated"" 2 weeks already) put quotes, days away 2 weeks going significant drop immunity, especially someone still relatively young healthy like is.

I could see thought process going head, pulled theater website, ordered 2 tickets showed late show people theater. told masks required theater anyway. kind felt ease.

Then, went grocery shopping movie said ""can go eat movie?"" We've outdoor dining entire time can, indoor occasion there's hardly anyone else restaurant. So, went ate sushi place movie.

I think ease going out, worried dining indoors - be, vaccinated!  ""These things"" go ANDA biologics equivalent. (I assume meant biosimilar?) approved biosimilar vaccines anyway... since know much, please explain bioequivalence process vaccines - also let know regulatory approvval pathway would choose ""ANDA vaccine...""

Or maybe instead look FDA says topic biosimilars, generics, bioequivalence : generic drugs versions brand name drugs may offer affordable treatment options patients. Biosimilars generics approved different abbreviated pathways avoid duplicating costly clinical trials. biosimilars generics, important differences biosimilars generic drugs.  example, active ingredients generic drugs brand name drugs. addition, manufacturer generic drug must demonstrate generic bioequivalent brand name drug.  contrast, biosimilar manufacturers must demonstrate biosimilar highly similar reference product, except minor differences clinically inactive components. Biosimilar manufacturers must also demonstrate clinically meaningful differences biosimilar reference product terms safety effectiveness. I've said I'll say again: folk mental. adult daughter looks healthy fairly severe chronic illness. true sufferers chronic illnesses often treated dismissively healthcare providers people general. pointed eloquently commentor thread.  first time since March 2020, multiple parties events weekend. Feels incredible! Get shots, shots! THIS. fear anxiety getting virus I'm fully vaccinated worry spreading others I'll still wear mask. good God, disappointed let world people it! 

I'm traumatic reaction, yes, guys think. feel betrayed society way reminiscent felt country collapsed war. People behaved callously selfishly, misled badly power, enough make lose faith they'll behave rational way much anything. 

It's very, hard trust people, feel they're mindless mob idiots. even harder consumed anger all. many people died... needlessly. makes sick stomach.

So go find surrounded mobs, crowds idiots happened trip took, infuriating. I'd rather stay away. would thought listening experts would turn way? feel neighbor Taxachusetts? Lot people got woken fact think lol Emily Oster, economist Brown University, *The Atlantic* March families plan take kids trips see friends relatives summer, reader sent email supervisors university suggesting Oster promoted leadership role field “genocide encouragement.”

Holy hell. oversees vaccines facilities manufacturing currently? really thousand deaths caused vaccinations?  panic attacks too. got flu vaccine last year paced around pharmacy like mad woman waiting turn. started sweating, every fiber wanted bolt. paced around finally called name it. felt relief. barely feel shot. also got covid vaccine. Almost cancelled rescheduled. went tired thinking obsessing it. way systematically desensitize needles? Like look needle, touch needle, touch skin, etc? Touch porcupine? Haha. Sorry know awful panic attacks are. contradicted *first Tuesday, Pfizer announced Covid vaccine brought $3.5 billion revenue first three months year, nearly quarter total revenue. **The vaccine was, far away, Pfizer’s biggest source revenue**, report Rebecca Robbins Peter S. Goodman New York Times. reopening plan today lot people US, things normal long time.

Kids attending school. People going work. socializing normally do. Restaurants bars open. large mega concerts (such big pop country stars) touring yet, smaller artists performing bars small venues.

Many people travel outside US. Cancelled cruises international travel restrictions tangible effect people. 

if go small rural towns many parts USA, it'll look exactly like 2019. public's ROI? fix it? people fundamentally broken humans still enslaved base instincts lifesaving progress cannot occur without motivation cyberpunk/American healthcare levels profit, say bring AI. Humira alone 20+ billion dollar drug. vaccination rate probably soon higher among teenagers countries' adults. Priorities?  amazed quickly it. Two weeks passed J&amp;J ready go back restaurants again. Back working office 3 days/week, hoping keep hybrid model, wearing mask outside away people.

There's life live I'm inside 24/7. naive sentiment is... Yup People become squirrelly house long. clear stuff more. can't wait stay home alone time choice like pre-pandemic. company giving shot (CVS/hospitals) get reimbursed insurance companies. Ok, far car thing, get prescription filled don’t car? would wager bet Americans don’t cars live cities. people know use public transit. live Bronx, plenty subway lines buses get anywhere need go get shot.  Many doctors especially [Daniel Griffin pushing CT values included reports year. also recognized necessarily false positives, rather weak positives people likely cannot transmit virus. Checking important see changing, getting less virus copies. Efficacy means that, every exposure COVID-19 body encounters, 95% (20 times) less likely develop infection vaccinated. Taken altogether, chance fully-vaccinated person developing infection realm 0.007%, around 1 13,000. chance spreading disease much lower still. 

So one things that, *technically* possible, unlikely almost completely moot. Time move back! Pretty easy governments play carrot stick people they're refusing to. WV right, incentivize getting 70% lifting restrictions people hate. Require proof vaccine attends large events. Yep, good point.  think sums see aggregate level.

A third rural hospital executives says less half staff vaccinated, third say 70% are. That's access information access vaccines, that's culture populations trending lower older populations (20-29 lag 30-39 40-49 populations pretty wide gap thus far) would assume lot lack urgency talk above.

When put together see outcome we're heading toward (topping 60% eligible population). IMO, there's one easy answer. Canada hard time criticizing health system proud it. major obstacle improvement. believe UK NHS. got British-made vaccine mix, really wonder whether vaccine nationalism played lack look problems. ""except building factories take lot time.""

Sorry what? US get notice everyone else something? (/s, know answer)

This crap everything, people always bash US need help complain US helping. US always expected everything everyone? like US helping, countries need take self responsibility times. 

Do people want US less involved involved world affairs? Really sick seeing people complaining BOTH. Oh yeah wackos want US Corona policy Sweden would shit pants US also adopted tax policy Kudos you. I'll following. doesn’t screw rest us, I’m fine Pessimistically, assume find reason avoid it. hope you’re right! side effects managed Tylenol staying hydrated, don’t last long.

We'll almost certainly lower overall death rate vaccines, proof natural immunity good enough. pandemic parties gonna insane thoo, might wanna try one something February 23, 1993 Progressives generally aren’t Fauci hero one side villain other. personally don’t listen him. enough information available us make decisions own. 

I’ll never forget confessed radon told us need wear mask weren’t enough masks. case, could least told us cover piece cloth. amount increasing everyday less now. line graph still rising slowing fast increasing. still feel India starting crest since new daily cases graph steep 4 days ago. flat wall straight anymore, slight decrease slope. mask mandates indoor gatherings. two big ones. kidding. Especially OG group Swappening. really. One two three neighborhoods hit hard. Manhattan Murray hill hit nearly badly. cases go next 2-4 weeks open organically. people feel safe stop. sudden rapid seems case, yes. second dose easier, though. recommend looking sources outside US. Australian news seems better US view others. used read lot Free Press, especially local publications. last 10+ years taken special interest groups show even bias anything mainstream. point article mentioning rejecting opportunities increase production specifically mentioning that. WW3! Fauci said this, people would get vaccinated  wish could share optimism. Around boston ""outdoor"" mask mandate yet almost everyone see wears outside. Modi? you?

There world map check countries general mortality data not:

There half world without mortality data, I'm afraid never know true magnitude pandemic. Still unsure people expected efficacy low. Measles 97%, Yellow Fever 99.9%, flu pretty bad flu specific mutates... Vaccines often 90%+ spike clear target. idea someone got J&amp;J,Moderna, Astrazeneca shot get Pfizer Booster? effective originally received Pfizer shot?  Got - truly hope cleared socialize soon! naive think cases india 357000 anywhere near figure. 
 source : family member ICU due covid. actual figure 10x restrictions phased required? may aware this, 90% drugs prescribed US generic drugs. also may aware, facilities also seas. also may aware, comparing raw numbers warning letters would pretty bad way measuring violations. 

Now hope snootiness end, there's actually pretty good book describing heroine stories FDA investigators overseas facilities. certainly bringing outright cases fraud light. aside, there's plenty highly developed facilities, world, India, capability manufacture vaccines. simply put fear mongering front cannot physically produced competent way suspicious. 

Not mention, someone CMC regulatory experience field, FDA oversight depending place manufacture destination. people who've COVID get worse response average first dose?

Chicago plans fully open July 4th! huge! They’re even announcing Chicago Auto Show return. looks like normal summer incoming. Reinfection real risk. Get vaccine shot repeated 5-10 times... 25! Nice. 
My son distance learning. He’s class 35. 6th grade neighbor class 38! full-day person class friends groups 32-35 students. Thing is, still testing enough, see repercussions opening measures people start get interned, takes time  That's sort rub. point think cautious folks concerned protecting anti-vaxxers anti-vaxxers are. 30% (or whatever is) get vaccinated care Covid living like normal awhile.

As person extremely cautious vaccinated, say let way. Open up. Us reasonable people protected others want be. want take chances, it. percent fuck around find hard way, rest drive us towards herd immunity via infection. Shrug. end let fend lift restrictions. fine! Congratulations getting vaccinated! Fwiw, received Pfizer well shots, least I've ever felt vaccination ever. needle small. great! Barely. 

Realistically, actual chance getting spay vaccine injury slim. case isn’t worldwide known, US government usually ignores you.

And no, covid vaccine covered. no, vaccine companies immune can’t get them. companies aren’t sue-able governments doesn’t care, yes, proxy, vaccines aren’t covered  paper says nothing 15 times lethal original article says ""reports say"".

I feel like fearmongering. another comment points out, 15x lethal would imply 15% fatality rate. kind jump might case due lack medical care I'd like see strong evidence declaring result variant specifically. exactly like people say officials must believe vaccines work they're wearing masks outdoors keeping mandates vaccinated.

Both FDA approval showing confidence vaccines taking masks least outdoors would lot public messaging. article seems imply N440K around little already B.1.1.7 B1.617 taking despite ""newer"" Indian population.  Yeah commented similarly condition receive second stimulus package vaccinated available. would owe back tax time. precedent, never civilian EUA vaccine, meaning incredible amounts data. Good data case vaccine wiped COVID Israel showing 91% aggregate efficacy 6 months. getting better, still summer levels. thats awesome. love finding places. senior prom Homie buddy introduced Boondocks lmfao Look way, US finishes vaccine effort, large portion vaccine production focused india

India key ally region hit hard, help coming soon Biosimilars abbreviated approvals already approved Biologics. Biosimilars show BIOEQUIVALENCE. Biosimilars require ANDAs (i.e., 505(j) 505(b)(2)). filed 351(k)s. 

Approved biosimilars exist. Biosimilar VACCINES exist. list filings biosimilars: See vaccine list? No. 

You understand distinctions. Details matter.   vaccine fully approved FDA needs mandated many professions, especially hospitals, workers vaccinated condition continued employment. TPR keeps going up, due less testing. think place like Chicago, unwritten rules stick around laws change everything opens back completely.

That sucks, rural areas. know, first wore mask outside people wearing masks, felt awful, like dystopia arrived. felt painful people dangerous now, dangerous vicinity. felt loss able walk crowded area worry-free. think people rural areas really, really want feel things, get mad anyone reminds world right now. least, that's I've made sense response this. refering ? bulgarian though know comminism. event killed 100m ? Pfizer already data FDA Approval applying month, I've heard takes FDA 6 months finish process high priority drugs (one reasons FDA created EUAs first place) guys link good articles/data vaccine development safety send hesitant individual? NYC probably best proving ground durable immunity natural infection. Good question. gotta think goal approved fall. Okay? free? weekly tests PCR. won’t retest either, assume positive could correct. 

One staff told cared TWO positive staff, guess helped realize might indeed positive. Moderna seems month behind Pfizer rollout related milestones. No, still infected vaccinated. vaccines 100% effective infection. rare please spread misinformation find even non-rural areas hospital works, least nurse level down, routinely refuse vaccines types. make completely single payer.

Cut middle man profiting death pandemic never happen again. Funny, Apple profits greater 30 Pfizer’s combined Gates/Bezo’s wealth equals Pfizer make 40 years. Somehow small segment society brainwashed everyone thinking life-saving companies bad, hip computer company’s good. You’ll fine, kiddo! Life beautiful you’ll plenty time catch up.

I’m front line HCP missed 29th 30th bday. party together :) fee months

I thought vaccines free, telling going paid months? Sigh... checked post history singular encounter one person thought we'd masks next year they've completely lost it. kinda weird. Like 10 hours ago, reasonable take things... Thats 263 cases covid think thats crazy, wait hear homo sapiens agree single payer healthcare would nice, anything?  B.1.617, know current vaccines robust against, drowning variant, easily transmitted two.

Isn't necessarily case variant emerged later two? Maybe sufficient time 'prove' relative advantages. noticed United States huge surge dumb Americans, India Europe ""oh, poor countries, hope get better"". Also hospital staff need get vaccinated. dumb don't..they fired cause might spread virus people hospital...and make everything worse. Well see effect Reddit, British users complete denial what's going still pushing conspiracy theories like effort EU throw shade great vaccine Brexit. insane. 

Even MHRA, regulatory body, finally admitted blood clot issue, officially advised 30 years old take another vaccine, still screaming conspiracy. No. first one sore arm, maybe.

For second one 50/50 chance feeling slightly sick next day. fever 8 hours. friend body aches like exercised bunch. Another felt fine tired slept rest day.

One person terrible health 50 said worst thing could ever happen back work next day giant hypochondriac time really believe him.

So might feel sick day second one. still means vaccine works. I'm Chicago. general un written rules are. 

When walking dog empty street/ side walk mask. soon crowds maintain 6 feet, quickly put back on. 

Wear times indoors strangers, wearing indoors friends. 

Pro vaccine well. 

With bars/ restaurants respect wear asking staff, walking. wearing seated. 

I hate I've driven rural parts U.S. look like I'm asshole wearing mask. harrased once. GQP busy committing acts treason like Mitch Moscow diddling children protecting diddlers like Gaetz. Yes, actually, Every ""raw material"" (which really raw - actually things like filters,etc) Curevac gets get shipped India (which successfully got excess capacity USA earlier week). 

Curevac late market. bring product, instead continuing deliver existing vaccines. bit ship Curevac here, appears close end year delivery, versus vaccines produced bulk now? 

Why scaling vaccine future, worth people dying now? applying long take?  Look proof stake vs proof work. PoS used vaccines isn’t Pfizer’s vaccine. Biontech developed totally honest feel need major push regain confidence J&amp;J vaccine. felt options seemed attract skeptics given traditional tech one shot deal. never recovered pause. Still seems barely going even week available again. Yes, time start trials. requires 6 months data. EUAs need 2 months data. take FDA 6 months review it. understanding employment US largely ""at-will"" therefore terminated really reason.

'At will' employment protect business legal liability employee fired cause. Seriously, rest world desperate vaccine. Complete waste leave vaccine supply shelf. one wants one area redistribute another area. Give people want it. Sobs Indian :(  aware ordered delivered two different things...

I repeat, translate preventing one death per week? think previous infections + vaccines. gonna get people lagging? that's great point. late June/Early July.

either states removing people wearing anymore issue really talk someone. normal feel way vaccinated still play somewhat safe. person entitled feelings certain point unhealthy, either end spectrum. free you, someone still pay, either Insurance government.  Fauci said this, everyone doubts would see validation lying whole time. I’m headed summer see friends are/will fully vaxxed. Bummed closures, though. going cruise bike around PDX take sights spare time. need guidence like this. Let people know feel confident let loose vaccinated. company right dealing lot sick leave people *are* getting vaccine. They've figured get shot pretty much guaranteed sick next day. company kind asking us schedule shots around everyone else's shots. yup COVAX would’ve solved issue. unfortunately reality sucks poorer countries, barely get scraps, stay way richer nations need it.   happily accepted taxpayer funds publicly-funded research facilitate vaccine development, pardon kissing ring benevolent corporate overlords! thanks, appreciate think might explain difference Oregon Washington then? Similar climate, similar politics, Oregon slightly temperate climate overall.
People equally fatigued covid never bad either place. mean it’s weird socks off, keep em’ good  telling vaccines last 32 years federally mandated limited liability manufacturers. COVID vaccines also different emergency federal process. understand think somehow manufacturer liability gold plated guarantee nothing bad ever happen pandemic. necromancer perhaps Sith lord could bring back Edward Murrow Mike Wallace. that, I'm really sure. 

Even WaPo, NY Times, Politico, Slate say things make raise eyebrow. take break it. Please god let work It’s luck 90% effectiveness 100% effectiveness. Population immunity puts wall immunized people around you, around people can't take vaccine proper immune responses, like people certain chemotherapies. Right brother I’ve read “they” testing sure, poster said there’s really reason think couldn’t. I’ve even read speculation might end even broader/more robust immunity boosting different “team.” idea true might be. think big flaw article lot anti-vax people already got virus next couple months acquire immunity way. estimation long get 60% vaccinated (which achievable non-Southern, mid-west states) effectively reach herd immunity half remaining 40% would get immunity natural infection. That's true, EXCEPT protected. Religious reasons protected that's reason people use say want get vaccinated (whether that's true). Jesus want get vaccinated, know. never made sense me. religion general makes sense me.

Businesses, unless they're medical-realm, probably want lose 20% workforce mandating vaccines (that's current 'i dont want get it' numbers, though I'm sure decent number groan get becomes mandated). want deal inevitable religious-discrimination lawsuits fly left right. since they're firing 'for-cause', they'll need pay unemployment employees.

All things mean businesses mandate employees.

What companies 'mandating' sorts situations bend employees will, put writing say can't get promoted get raises/bonuses. way people either get quit accord everything said previous paragraph valid anymore.  rarely see anyone wearing outside. going building. see lift uber drivers wearing them, it. Well know friends vaccinated not... friends lying. restaurants bars use future apps designed government CDC gives QR code... California New York already making apps like that. Throw rager? means vaccinated people test go store get haircut take walk night nobody goes anyway. find exaggerated. Korean War! Depends wanting look at.

Yes, percent total population relevant herd immunity, wanting compare across states, % eligible population relevant. Hard vaccinate can't vaccinated.

Obviously, number little eligible population due exclusion 16 17 year olds, probably lot easier find adult population statistics rather 16 less common cut population. weird take assume companies obligation invent something that's never made before, opposed thankful able actually it. Talk entitled... 2 year old problem wearing mask. sees wants too.  explanation fewer naturally immune Oregon Washington

Equally, people might pandemic fatigued experienced severe traumatic effects NYC.

I'm dismissing prior immunity, I'm sure factor. I'm sure combination behavior, weather, luck, dominant variants, building standards ventilation perhaps, prior immunity - understand reluctance consider anything herd immunity explanation. Sus Almost every vaccine efficiency study done masked participants. know efficient unmasked situations. then, masks indoors still thing now. Outdoors, fair game. thoughts governments, eventually large businesses going get active vaccine encouragement mode.

Large businesses want economy turned way back on. guys think masking end states restrictive? Correct. projecting early 2022 age 6 months 11 years. [It's toward end Brown shut bars restaurants? there's reason mods removed article subreddit. Completely fair. isnt good wording although welcome news. Good. Let anti-vax assholes roll dice, give people asking it.  wouldn’t concerned fact country won’t reach herd immunity. article leave lot important context. Rest assured beat coronavirus - might get shots every year similar flu, life go back normal soon. Consider also many technological advancements made, made, made negate much COVID impacts world. We’ve got lot look forward to, whether reach 80% vaccination. Don’t stress. We’re final stretch, don’t listen doomers cherry pick data make seem like we’ll never end this. soon. cases drop, think? reading article yesterday US able reach herd immunity there's many vaccine refusers. I’m sorry buddy. Hang there. saw headline 5 years ago would assume ""Covid-19"" inexpensive semiautomatic. *Cries European* factory suitable producing mRNA vaccines available production, IP license? That's thought weird adamant Biden wearing mask said Patriotic. CDC changed guidance. point, pushing masks outdoors fully vaccinated people negative. First, keeps people afraid be. Second, undermines benefit getting vaccine hesitant rushing get it. Yeah. Foolish think USA would end way NZ did. kinda thought would happen, would get vaccine would that. Western media narrative around current Indian outbreaks pretty firmly blaming Modi (as be) here, eaten restaurants three four times like you, first vacation touristy place push limits. got home, ate restaurant felt...wrong. Hopefully begin feel comfortable soon. good, we're homies here! Toothless honestly stuck unemployment job print piece paper, going print piece paper. absurdly easy forge covid documentation. Really need printer.  Immunocompromised people can’t get protection vaccines. small group people legitimately cannot protect themselves. Also, allowing covid circulate – even mild forms among people vaccinated - allows mutate. eventually lead version defeats vaccinations. There’s thing allowing continue circulating without causing harm communities. ￼￼￼ That's British mainstream media actively ignore topic unless can't anymore. even report that, try present scaremongering instead actual issue considered. 


And get letter vaccine appointment, even told vaccine get day appointment make sure mention much money NHS wastes show appointments puts peer pressure already vaccination centre scared speak up.

The issue pretty much ignored refuse vaccine, they'll try convince give go take information news only, easy convince them. need things like encourage vaccination. COVID COVID vaccine preventable contagious diseases. [Maybe read rules sub start must edited source.

Unless telling think local TV station crafting headlines read worldwide audience. which, case, LOL. “So what” also argument. claimed tax dollars didn’t pay develop vaccines, demonstrably false. Without tax-funded research many countries, would developed. degree companies entitled profit public research contentious issue, separate false claim vaccines weren’t developed public funds. interesting plays - opinion, appears big overlap people think employers allowed make vaccination status requirement - people support ""at-will"" employment. must nice shortage, hope we'll get soon Europe (30% first vaccinations country, hope keep current pace) r/technicallythetruth? camp ""all covid months bundled together"". agree single payer necessary discussion, correct real positive bearing covid response europe vaccine deployment. beginning April seemed nearly impossible get vaccine appointment here, people traveling rural areas nobody wanted them. Showed get 2nd dose yesterday, people getting shots people got first one. US opportunity basically end pandemic within borders, we're passing vaccine hesitancy. So, uh, build wall Alberta BC make Alberta pay it? Meh, I’ll fully vaccinated week. others don’t beyond control worry. Although understand can’t vaccinate medical reasons - that’s shitty situations.

Also, I’m virologist won’t reach herd immunity one way other? i.e vaccinations natural immunity, eventually pay $100 anyone

Not anyone. aged 16 35. $100 savings bond, $100 cash. time get wet [increased risk younger vaccine 100 percent effective individuals, effectivesness measured community scale, necessarily individual scale. Although mRNA vaccines near 100 percent preventing death severe cases Covid-19, even mild cases allow continue circulating prolong this. 

There also people cannot vaccinated, people know vaccine cannot work (certain immunosuppressed patients). people forced depend herd immunity reduced exposure.

A large non vaccinated population also opens reservoir mutations, vaccine may may work for. 

Basically, vaccines work best large scale, eliminating reservoir minimizing exposure, even offer 100 percent protection individual.   based 2B doses year 3.5B annually next three years take us \~15B?

1. one producer only;
2. probably need 5B vaccinated worldwide herd immunity;
3. achieve herd immunity much sooner certain countries account bulk global travel. lower case counts NYC last spring whole pandemic? live, dark 4 pm 8am winter never got bad almost state.

To clear, seasonality factor, think enough explain Washington Oregon worse anywhere else right we've lowest cases whole pandemic.

Portland Oregon far south Seattle Oregon way worse Washington. better Washington case counts deaths rest pandemic. Oregon Washington certainly extremely similar seasonal risk patterns. explanation fewer naturally immune Oregon Washington. Oregon better weather Washington they're south. think eventually also people go fun things without pay lot extra. Want go NBA game? Well, need free vaccination, OR, need pay extra $125 Covid-19 test. never needed mot outdoor things, viral load would low anyway. Pfizer RnD though, BioNTech. Pfizer capability run trials ramp production though, hugely important. mention ""two-fold less"" serum antibody neutralization way better reduction south african variant has, vaccines sure seem working well enough one. depends reason states using. it’s still ramping delivery makes sense let catch up. it’s don’t demand makes sense reallocate. I’d like think so, unless he’s got magic tricks sleeve, I’m convinced we’ll get there! gonna happen emergency authorization. FDA need fully authorize vaccines get kinds numbers. Also haven’t seen good justification emergency authorization children get vaccine. (At least otherwise healthy children, perhaps justification children underlying health problems made) never open 100% again. Sorry say it, folks. trouble. Johnson &amp; Johnson working it... 100%.

Make life expensive difficult people vaccinate. Look taxes, travel restrictions, etc. etc.

Already world made clear need proof vaccination go US anywhere, people already going limited domestic travel potentially years. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* many people honestly hung final approval FDA? feel like move another excuse take it. Fair enough! Thanks food thought. That's awesome. statewide. get it, realize different area code haha Possible Required renew driver's license

Oh boy, read initially ""if get shot we're going make renew license"".... honestly may also work penalty. Fox hosts vaccinated still telling people to? podcast convinced start taking coronavirus seriously. That’s frustrating. hope keep fighting good fight. Maybe people capable swayed. may even admit face, probably won’t, they’ll later quietly change behavior something said got them. Ok would potentially end everywhere then? see incentives penalties like... required renew driver's license, travel domestically pretty severe. feel like that's way overreaching. yeah, work QA pharma company. explain IRB's, SAE's hoops go get even IND approval, care. can't use logic change someone's mind something use logic get into. honestly pretty lofty.

People want vaccine least one shot now. next 4 weeks, anyone wants one fully vaccinated.

The people without 1 shot already people hesitant resistant vaccine.

I'm sure he'll able flip many people's opinions. guess we'll see. I'm game this, unvaccinated (outside medically ineligible) need face consequences negative externalities actions  Problem many Republican states allow vaccine passports mandatory vaccinations. Look Florida instance. Wow, waited since looks like people deliberately difficult getting free shit theirs. people planning get vaccine afraid dying COVID. EVERYone likes free shit. protected class things involving medical history, like example employer fire / hire past history cancer.

I wonder going lawsuits regarding vaccination ""medical history"" protected class. stagnation really end world, things considered? goal flatten curve stagnant curve flat curve.

I'm saying ideal course. point, personal health decision whether get vaccine (yes obvious decision me; say personal decision unlike mask wearing primarily protect yourself, others) can't keep everything closed anti-vaxxers (who dead set views doubt could change minds anyway) refuse get it. People LA basically never stopped partying. think never pandemic based social media. thought employers near absolute right provide safe workspace. instance employers require employees wear PPE. jobs regulatory requirement. refuse, fired.

You argue unvaccinated employees create unsafe workspace. reference, california currently 63% adults least 1 dose, 70% doable, expected think need authority ""Pfizer exec says need 3rd shot.""

How Pfizer exec says, ""we need 3rd shots reasons why, data support it.""? This! live Alabama tried take kid park Sunday. playground still closed. Why? makes sense know now. want people follow science politics. that's like saying excess deaths ~50%?? Agreed, may still shit Toronto right now, knowing happening elsewhere feels good know. Panicking what? needle? Come on. old enough use internet connected device, needle keep accepting medical care save life? Perhaps get professional counseling. many licensed professionals could turn order get help. protecting yourself, protecting around you. would want endanger lives others ""irrational"" fear? make difference sake humanity? think 60% would much likely floor case. Flu vaccination get attention COVID-19 vaccination has, people obviously far fearful COVID-19. went small party weekend, 6 people fully vaccinated since March. lot fun, thing caught hangover.

Get vaccinated people. point donate unused doses countries can/will accept them. even small number first, hearing vaccines go expired still lot ppl vaxx insane. really hope supply rerouted India states going use underestimate many people 30 procrastinate days weeks end hesitant emergency approval new, totally anti-vaxx. Hopefully get enough people merely hesitant get board. I'm sure vaccines get permanent approval, hopefully long. It’s reasonable yet still somewhat lofty goal. think people see big number assume can’t done many felt prospect vaccinating even 50% country brought up. Right, consider 4 weeks ""long term"". want know possible vaccine side effect show 6 months more. people know opted J&amp;J idea vaccine also sent mRNA instructions cells order produce spike proteins like mRNA ones.

The difference vector vaccines send DNA cell core mRNA vaccines (and viruses) replicate cell cytoplasm. Thus, lot confidence mRNA vaccines vector DNA vaccines. helped attempt cover problems like blood clots. I.. Feel completely fine. Really good, actually. really hope staunch Republican celebrities make vaccinations public.



They really need poster childs now. I'm afraid family get vaccinated unless see people respect readily get vaccinated.



As covid survivor minimal symptoms, tell wish sickness upon noone. Additionally, first Moderna shot, things starting smell taste good again; instead rotting garbage. Damn never could imagine vaccines worth negative $$$. both. dont know got downvoted. symptoms except sore arm shots hesitate get third makes sense time comes. We've blown every single goal Biden made he's really business overpromising stuff.  Even “hesitant” leaves certain proportion flat procrastinating. “Oh, yeah, guess next time go pharmacy. Maybe next month...” Especially they’re working home, low exposure, etc. incentive probably catch relatively quickly. First shot probably get sore arm might feel rough tomorrow. Second shot worse, even absolute worse one really bad night feeling like crap days. Vaccinations slowly steadily improving across EU... give time. rolling symptoms days, I've gathered got worse side effects most. probably okay, keep getting good sleep stay hydrated case minimize future symptoms. 20% people downright refusing take vaccine another \~18% still unsure. find difficult believe ever go past 65% mark. You’re talking decades rnd. 

They also received guarantees buy billions dollars worth, whether worked. Imagine flu shot travel shit.

Not bad idea tbh Buddy's wife went second shot like this. fine; may slightly worse side effects. sneaky.  Sometimes see people jogging street, completely alone, wearing mask. It’s mind boggling. people cannot use common sense think themselves. Instead listen news everyday find ist verboten. it’s probably anxiety issue. Hell yes!!!! great minds think alike. I’m sure... get flu shot every year know hardly anyone work friends get flu shot, husband doesn’t. people however get covid vaccine. Required travel domestically

I assume mean planes trains boats, right? messaging political public health officials nothing short disaster throughout pandemic.

That said, Wolf hit home run today. eliminate restrictions, including social distancing requirements, one fell swoop beautiful thing. tying lightning rod masking vaccinated, ascribing specific goal, makes sense world. reading use term vaccine hesitant, puts idea minds people never considered way first place. Maybe reasons getting it, didn’t know how, hear term think well, maybe hesitant. type thing.  That's lot words say absolutely nothing. mean guess ... I’ve anxiety whole life find odd coincidence... isn’t anxiety full blown akathisia.. odd symptom long Covid come find. get it? Vaccine 95% effective. Catching COVID proof vaccinated. lol Canada might get one shot us 😂  Maybe not. got covid vaccine soon could I’ve never gotten flu shot.

Yup, I'm taking care first think past point due hesitance going take care neighborhood. can't figure trolling actually understand this, pretending know talking about. I'm leaning toward latter. know I'm bombing US oriented thread, I'm envious guys. I'm India guys know bad situation here. what's less reported fact government made efforts vaccinate whole population faster. 

We pre-ordered negligible number doses, health minister repeatedly said government plans vaccinate everybody, even parliament too. Ironically enough, busy promoting untested drug (coronil), nothing scam. 

I know vaccinating big population big task, government made next efforts, second wave arrived full glory. guys lucky biden, keen getting guys back work. Hell even Trump took shot! Get stick take Pfizer jab  That's kind job president, though. I'd rather drop mask mandate 30 days nationally apathetic resistant deal consequences choices personal way. Oh, we're still lockdown Spanish flu too? Time moves forward, friend.  think perspective know whether best decision quite time. long term effects covid disease vs long term effects covid response.. difficult predict point. referring plant Pfizer _acquired part company troubled history violations_, many personnel training issues, worked five years successfully remediate. sound like license suspension - sounds like case Pfizer bringing manufacturing quality control expertise rescue plant significant issues.

In words, that's exactly proving point: vaccine manufacturing game, saying ""make fucking products"" sufficient: need actual experience expertise.

Which brings us full circle. whole thing we're talking whether forge partnerships expand manufacturing - should, are. whether forcible IP waiver gets us there, nothing presented demonstrates would: provided single example one company without relevant expertise thinks reverse-engineer vaccine.

There plenty candidate manufacturing partners could build facilities time, vaccine makers working many licensing arrangement produce enough doses expedite vaccination effort. direct partnership needed make sure production process done correctly - mere waiver intellectual property rights wholly insufficient without production expertise.

You presented single scrap evidence IP waiver what's needed expedite vaccine manufacturing. think far likely advocating position work pharmaceutical industry believe IP waiver would benefit employer.  Bug them. Look appointment times locations them. Text list options choose.  

The hard work getting 50% 70% vaccinated mostly come encouragement friends family. Laziness excuse anymore, localized vaccination sites less mass-vaccination sites coming weeks. it. coworkers anti vax trust 6 people died J&amp;J shot. trust vaccines werw developed less year. Put front Walmarts, Costcos Targets people head shop. 

I also wonder J&amp;J hold slowed lot lazier folks down. mind getting two shots, know mom dad, hesitant get one, would never get two completely inept dealing health stuff, twice cause forget. Convenience would maybe get get done.

Wimmy wam wam wozzle! prepared administration one would hope. Urban areas could hit this. sticks may not. know why. flu shot isn’t really comparable.

If doctor offers take don’t really seek out, due laziness sometimes low effectivity %.

But covid vaccine? Shit woulda gone anywhere that. got first Moderna shot back April 15th local vaccination clinic. set get second shot 13th.

Eh, I’m really sure. personally don’t think it’s going become “non existent” (in way as, say, Ebola) pretty long time, ever. think we’ll many thousands cases day long time still. I’m pretty pessimistic idea ever reach herd immunity. Maybe certain smarter areas will, country not, regions (like entire south) won’t even come close. covid almost surely around, that’s mention fact variants, seemingly likely ever actually escape vaccines, keep coming infectious, means need even higher level immunity keep controlled. 

My opinion sooner later (I hope sooner), decide live it. adults eligible vaccination. Soon children too, they’re near zero risk anyway. hope people leaders stop looking unrealistic expectation covid go away, start taking pragmatic look idea point, people still getting sick ones actively chose so. would shocked happens. Vaccinations dropping quickly, difficult get Republicans get vaccine. expect we'll see 70% northeast, entire country. think people seem think saying ""nobody cares anymore"" Yup people gotten jaded year covid news, stats, deaths, etc. many forgotten empty highways full refrigerator trucks. using correct data real ratio vaccines. administered millions people young old 1 blood clot death per described. know buy logic antivaxers drive vaccine-resistant variants. antivaxers likely get spread disease, yes, spreading unvaccinated going put evolutionary pressure virus escape vaccine. antivaxer gotten disease recovered, seems like prior infection gives immunity comparable released vaccines, reach herd immunity anyway.

If anything, near-total vaccination rates may forces variant evolution. know I'm saying sounds crazy, there's similar concept dealing pesticides.

I'm sure underpromising overdelivering, least somewhat realistic. fully FDA approved widely available longer excuse (speaking americans 16 older).  employer's reason firing presumed legal. fired employee prove fired illegal reason. Reduce community worldwide death disability. Astrazenneca gives vaccine cost price... Honestly even unvaccinated people able outdoors mask, long crowds. Outdoor transmission extremely rare. mean say this: 63% one dose now. 4th July maskless parties real possibility would even consider - $50k trip location crowding access major medical care - without vaccinated? y’all rake forests? vaccinated? everyone mentioning Novavax (the protein based vaccine) Curevac (another mRNA one) soon, I’ll throw possibles 2021: 

There Zydus Cadila’s **ZyCoV-D**. It’s Indian based vaccine, uses DNA (not RNA!) deliver instructions cells create antigens immune response. holds numerous unique advantages: skin patch instead shot, stored room temperature. downside needs three doses it’ll take three months totally vaccinated. Phase 3 ending soon, hopefully approved India June July! Production already begun, although hundred million expected year.

Russia protein-based vaccine called **EpiVacCorona** Bektop Vector Institution. It’s actually already use Russia Turkmenistan, phase 3 studies technically still going I’m including one coming (it isn’t widely used like Russia’s Spunik). Technically, phase 3 done month two vaccine could see wider usage then, concerns phase 1 2 data see. 

China LOT vaccines don’t phase 3 data readily available used lot countries. CanSino Biologics’ Convidecia, Sinopharm’s BBIBP-CorV Sinovac’s CoronaVac emergency use many countries. Another one coming Sinopharm’s inactivated virus vaccine phase 3. Hard consider “coming out” “out” 

Canadian based vaccine maker Medicago realllly interesting vaccine called **CoVLP**: plant based vaccine uses plant cells create protein shells mimic Covid. plant close relative tobacco!! Phase 3 started March won’t much longer data revealed (phase 2 really good results) Canada already ordered 75 million doses. 

Cuba vaccine Finlay Vaccine Institute, trial done June... it’s another protein based vaccine. lot known it, trials going Iran add bit legitimacy. could end Q3 Q4.

There’s lot meme articles probably already know, **QazVac** Kazakhstan ending phase 3 could actually available world early Q4 works well. uses deactivated virus get immuno response. 

French vaccine maker Valneva using Dynavax technology produce inactivated viral based vaccine called **VLA2001**. Q4, French already placed order 100 million. 

There’s another protein based vaccine horizon types groups hands it: started SARS vaccine made Baylor College Medicine Texas Children’s hospital. saw could tweaked effective Covid. India’s Biological E took bought license used technology Dynavax turn full fledged Covid-19 vaccine. CEPI joined funding, Biden administration donating money production too. don’t even think name, it’s moving lightning paced, well funded, phase 3 trials started last month, could approved Q3/Q4 could lot manufacturing power behind it.

 Also pretty basic reading vaccine efficacy herd immunity show 'sloped forehead' logic, actually quite important minimize variants community spread. Let come Brazil 🥺 7 month old 2 kids 5 home. Since still know much covid damages heart lungs really young children can't see risking going yet. year since seen family friends really want go places but, I'd stay home forever means zero chance getting covid me.

I can't wait vaccine 6m - 11yr olds. fine. I’ve actually worked CMC conducting approvals. It’s really tiring hear simplified pharma lobbying talking points used justify horrific actions. regards expanding vaccine manufacturing either. terms marketing, “expensive rnd” justify patent evergreening product hopping, seemingly WWI trench warfare lawsuits back forth companies protect patents 20+ yrs block generics biosimilars. 

The fact sterile injectable products massive public investments reaching back decades, public guarantees purchases remove risk, Logistical regulatory assistance along way.

Yeah vaccine distribution problem poorer countries one example tbh. It’s current state world, really shocker. I've read EU starting procedure Coronavac well. people want traditional vaccines, maybe Chinese one way them, use inactive virus tech. Really? come there's provinces without massive outbreaks? makes sense... first get cases. Aye. sounds like it'll pretty easy get then. think it'll simple going CVS without appointment get one? UK AstraZeneca probably outnumbering Pfizer doses, bought another 60 million doses Pfizer boosters, presumably everyone getting boosted boosted Pfizer AZ not. Counterpoint: everyone would hang vaccinated Agreed! Rogan podcast last year depressed came ok got second dose hour earlier first one three weeks ago? 1st one: ~9AM. 2nd one: ~8AM.

Also second Pfizer shot hurt first anyone else? also didn’t get Band-Aid time. Normal? kids LAUSD option online instruction rest semester.

Remember y'all, Facebook ain't real life. since 2015 maybe longer. seeing 10% village idiots 90% astroturfers. Pfizer vaccine gets fully approved change 'it's alright take 'take get fired.'

Anti vax people cowards. push comes shove fold every. freaking. time. emmeffers thought injection bleach veins intended joke.

The current system allows tests 72 hours old tests means 72 hours incubate become infectious (source needed understand infectiousness correlated symptoms). It’s unrealistic goal areas, county already 66+% adults least one dose we’ll get within month two rural areas state probably won’t happen state whole might happen while. appreciate setting concrete number imagine they’ll drop cases/hospitalizations low. numbers heading right direction still quite high.

Maybe we'll see smaller scale shows. think you’re misunderstanding person talking about. 34 1.8 million Ohioans vaccinated since December tested positive COVID-19
 
is irrelevant. vast majority 1.8 million people wouldn’t gotten COVID anyway wouldn’t exposed. 

If change behavior drastically enough get vaccinated (say, go full-on quarantining nightly orgies licking subway handrails) yes, absolutely could higher risk getting COVID even though vaccine highly effective. issue many events already once. Two cancelled events row could death knell. I'll fully vaccinated Thursday. I'm gonna easing way back normalcy vs complete 180.

Covid hates outdoors. Came say this. 🤣 I've saying quite time, wanna definitely make people talk get get vaccinated? Make commercial Trump, Biden Obama saying country needs united get get vaccinated help everyone. disgusting  I’d much rather scan QR code phone. definitely ways this. Yesssss! c'mon let's get data 6 months+! confident daycare vaccinating and/or keeping masks day. Awesome. Make new rule. stupid morons locked house, allowed restaurants, hotels, trains planes... now!!! ""real world"" results mass vaccinations started (not phase 3 trials) south american country (I know Chile another country) Sinovac around 63%. Yes  idea means lol fully vaccinated person, I'm fine OK it. Low risk part getting sick (and ""low"" serious understatement). unvaccinated determine acceptable level risk. 

That said, friend group, probably 70% already fully vaccinated remaining 30% already first shot gonna moot point soon. obvious vastly undercounted AZ related blood clots UK. I'm angry that, wonder whether ever admit it. 

Here Canada scientists feel risk turn least 1 50,000, 1 250,000 Brits reported. wish waited Pfizer. Got shamed 'vaccine shopping' strangers take care stroke. important bill we've long time. definitely worth even lost shots. No. Given American production capacity, could exported limited amount day one. Keeping instead would've still prioritised US citizens. judged everything metric, would living life right now.

Also, vaccine safe. cut bureaucratic red tape, safety precautions. sounds right.  guess still better February tho.

Happy Cake Day! Yeah, hosted backyard party neighbors weekend. adults vaccinated three kids wore masks. vaccinated adults wearing masks 80% time kids wearing masks 100% time still one person leave early concerned many unmasked people around.  get paid get spit face im kind desensitized point happens, talk it. want serve least three months house arrest effectively age world made boomers boomers. political choice strict priority system based age either admit virus next harmless young people, admit chose let smaller number young people die save older. 

Let guess, already vaccinated boomer dreaming summer Mallorca? Free weed beer? almost makes want move there… 🤣 assume go restaurants flu season pre-Covid? go store without wearing mask? not, not? assume vast majority people haven’t. depends someone CT from. CT believe still biggest wealth gap discrepancy country. beautiful landscaping, lot areas still heavily forested (on walk home last night work whole family deer crossed road front week saw fox road house, neither phased me) best education schools like Yale, wealth gap apparent. Look photos Greenwich look photos areas New n remind that's state. Yeah shocked absurdity response, although maybe he's way everyday life weeks least. see now. like ""put mask keep 5 months helping others"".  already blocked you. sh&amp;t Sherlock. trials weren’t exactly long term. 8 months-ish starting fifth month vaccines. 

Stop living scared. you’ve mRNA vaccine, B117 essentially effect efficacy. I’d go far say adenovirus vaccines, data produced front. people immunosuppressants double vaccines they’re body doesn’t respond normal dose. something would need discuss doctor feel like need extra dose vaccine. don’t think particularly egregious, even driest statistics misleading information framed certain way. make climate change seem really strong basically non-existent using dataset changing it’s presented example. 

If country one COVID case one day two next „COVID CASES DOUBLED“ would factually correct headline, one sending message I’d least consider misleading.

Caught walking gym early morning mask pulled immediately thought ""can please done shit?"" know that's wrong ways go (in state) everyone know vaccinated I'm getting increasingly tired  Great, want stand solidarity vaccinating population?

AZ absolutely critical Australia. 20M Pfizer ordered (less million delivered?), local onshore manufacturing capability AZ. CSL (an Australian pharmaceutical manufacturer) contract produce 53.4M doses, started production recently.

However, TGA recently recommended Pfizer/BioNTech ""prefered"" vaccine 50. 50 either wait doses PZ/BNT arrive (probably six months more), take AZ vaccine signing disclaimers etc.

Many people avoiding result. Trumps supporters would say holograph that. find excuse what’s best country. pacific northwest full people think covid conspiracy vaccine dangerous...Its frustrating healthcare worker part country. Holy fucking shit!! really lost hopes point 3-4 months ago shitstorm never gonna end. Go UK think missed word “fully,” confused second though hope CCP pays you, honestly. work NYC already seen mask wearing way outside. Since I'm fully vaccinated wear mask outdoors NYC anymore. Ok, great rest folks encouraged get it.

I'm sure virus related PTSD thing. No, it’s actually well-balanced interview. think going see many 16+ voluntary vaccinations. Probably need wait full approval soft mandates (work, schools, unis...) see accelleration demographics. month ago, CVS give 10M doses. figure Walgreens similar. Even super conservatively say 20M doses, wasting less 1% seem awful. Especially last month seeing demand drop, seem bad me. I'd obviously prefer used, tragedy.

I can't quickly find many doses they've given. found article 4/1 stated CVS give 10M doses. school open, 12 students per day 4 periods. Parents sending students in. I'm room teaching handful students person 25 others online period. US overwhelmed hospitals right now? Even Michigan seeing steady hospitalization decline.. Vaccines + school + youth sports. Come now, seniors got vaccinated Covid cases tanked 65+, Covid cases tanking young adults/adults since getting vaccinated... trend pretty obvious lol Yeah Chile heavily P1 would expect loss efficacy That’s opinion. 
~10% opinion. I’m WA. made appointment went got it. easily passes 16. I’m sure wasn’t technically legal, don’t care. link trend several factors – particularly high vaccination rates among older Americans. U.S. recently announced 100 million people fully vaccinated COVID-19. dynamics also play, new COVID-19 variants loosening restrictions school also worth noting vast majority pandemic, age group highest case rates 18 24 U.S., Centers Disease Control Prevention note kids still represent really small proportion worst-case true. somewhat nuanced conversation though. Michigan, they've reporting higher rates hospitalizations kids [been]. unclear simply represents intense transmission versus actually increased severity. think that's entirely clear yet. Colorado, little surge going on. states actually, cases going down. We're still kind plateau, maybe increasing bit Colorado. seen slight uptick kids hospitalized COVID-19 Children's Hospital, dramatically so, like seeing November, December part conversation severity gets little bit complicated yes, absolutely true less severe kids adults, particularly older adults. also true say completely benign kids. Fortunately, pediatric death fairly rare event. look top 10 causes death, annual basis, year, we've had, depending whose numbers use, somewhere 300 600 pediatric deaths COVID-19 far. That's probably undercount. would fit somewhere top 10, somewhere like No. 6 No. 9 terms causes death point I'm making, yes, less severe, still potentially severe disease. We've seen tens thousands hospitalizations already. need vaccine children, protect, achieve herd immunity, also protect children themselves.

…

Article continues Yes big difference. Turkey time wild type variant Brazil mostly P1 Chile also suggesting 55 60% efficacy mostly totally P1 troll headline? live Friend, disagree you. respect you. good night also know people are/were vaccine neutral waiting convenient walk-in locations. also know people waiting full FDA approval, think reasonable benchmark. Getting two groups vaccinated going lot easier breaking true anti-vaxxers. sent back school soon, unvaccinated, concentrated sealed boxes sharing air eight hours day, airborne pandemic raging, idiots! Probably lowest late 2019 honest like October November can't wait see youngest nieces nephews person! definitely relate hesitancy jump back in. There's need rush live area still putting high daily numbers. I've able things vaccine good masking, put previously. getting easier. helps lot local numbers low. aren’t vaccinated yet? may aware, bank/public holidays particular constituent countries UK. e.g. English bank holidays Scottish bank holidays... meaning ""bank holiday"" different England Scotland :-) NY Times confirmed story made appointment 12 14 year olds state site next week. wouldn’t allow use real birth years, made temporarily older system catches up. 

I think public school vaccine issue probably largely dependent live. Unfortunately probably along red/blue lines now. case dad suffering advanced prostate cancer. money pit. spectators Olympic village athletes stadiums ready go don’t vaccine yet Good luck you! Yep. “WhAt VaRiAnTs” Good you, thing. I'm telling to.

Rather, I'm explaing I'm going counteract 95% reduction risk things greatly increase risk, community spread low enough provide additional layer risk reduction. 

And take much longer am. People getting vaccinated cases starting go way down. Pretty soon reduction risk lack community spread dwarf individual protection vaccine. resume normal activities. expect full FDA approval? 250+ million doses, 100+ million doses, 6+ 
months data ever collected analyzed around vaccine. world delay for, especially Moderna/Pfizer? nice. Where? I'm 25 California got first dose back February. vaccine opened literally everyone weeks ago within 2 weeks everyone wanted one able get one. demand fallen cliff 40%. There's restaurant/bar near NJ that's pretty much ignored capacity rules since went 50%. ate lunch day packed. Text zip code GETVAX (438829)
Or VACUNA (822862) Spanish 

Will respond three vaccination locations near you.

Pass on. specify: exactly mRNA vaccine feel justified? cannot refute give specifics. bit specific ""safety testing"".

I'm trying make story you, must understand many currently making story vaccine. get 14 year old vaccine already? I'm aware choose get now, age group got emergency approval yet? think thats... legal lol. wrong would love learn. Need get 60% overall July-August. Ideally 70% fall avoid winter wave altogether. Probably wouldn’t big anyways, would rather none smaller one. work midtown. city hurting cash right now, think could stay locked longer. Pay wall :( suggested people get vaccine also said it’s right get something dumb along lines. 2 year old 5 year old here. Can’t wait it’s approved kids We're talking VACCINATED people here, buddy. Meaning risk serious complications post-Covid-vaccination LESS risk serious flu complications. whenever finally feel comfortable emerging society again, flu risk big concern, Covid, since greater potential threat you. 13 joined cross country running team, wasn’t tall son 16. Normal teenage food plus adding running anywhere 10+ miles day. grocery bill likely glad little brother didn’t get organized sports. *Let's run government like CVS pharmacy!* Ohio data example success efficacy vaccine. 

I also linked data posted another thread CDC data significantly better trial data. 

Your comment “1.8 MM people wouldn’t gotten Covid” weren’t taking risks assumption. 

Even so, vaccinated, expand behaviors confident risk contracting Covid lower. 

Why world getting vaccinated - expectation significantly lower risk contracting virus do, won’t serious symptoms, need hospitalization. 

Basically guys point data young sample size enough. 

I disagree - 96 MM vaccinated far greater sample size trials. trials 8 months long. giving vaccine since mid Dec. 

And current cases significantly less trial periods. Aw hell EDC Vegas moved October ,now there' sa second chance cancellation. I'll gladly wait 2022 though means things 100% safe. Okay then, you’re much better everybody else. won’t missed. might slightly less last monday basically steady past week so, cases continue go deaths ￼I wish vaccinated-only events. I’d chum masses then. Plus it’s like reward acknowledgement right thing. there’s relief around people actually care. Right vibe area “Don’t ask, don’t tell. Also, lol, believe vaccines/COVID?”

Lots businesses happy give rewards signing dumb email ads year older. vaccine related promotion I’ve seen one donut shop dislike.  I'm nervous too. much still infected second vax readjusting social anxieties gotten 2018-2019. Little afraid cat callers street harassment bolder, little things like that. point is, are.

Id manage expectations bit. point lift regulations NJ, excited family lives there. herd immunity. CDC's latest would need 90% vaccinated get immunity, expect ever will. However, expect people vaccinated, additional risk. Since anyone wants vaccine able get one end summer likely fully vaccinated point, point maintaining restrictions.

Would make cool story tell grandkids Yeah, live couple hours Sacramento people getting vaccinated, case numbers going up. it’s weird see articles saying California cases low see something affects schools accept state funding. realize younger people recently, could even get vaccine begged it.

Also ice pack spot couple minutes makes hard feel needle live WA lying. Many places King County (by far populous country) allowing walk-in vaccinations without ac appointment. counties literally begging covid-deniers come get shot. I’m waiting.

Stable public health low threat infection guess? live NY we’re technically longer required wear outside, people still less ~35% population vaccinated. imagine less less people care wear mask higher number goes. terms governmental control, can’t really buy idea people power jizzing they’ve required masses cover mouths/noses cloth. It’s science-led public health, intellectually easy get behind one recognizes half million people died disease country Sarcasm. country safe reach herd immunity.

How much longer supposed wear masks for??? Impossible talk strangers without feeling like weirdo. made statement you. exact comment related ""Most people know"" even made concession ""I'm sure that's true everyone"". Based personal experience (once again, important qualifier), exception rule.

Hopefully 12-15 gets approved week see nice little bump them. Numbers adjusted approved. state might (for while) - states sure.

Also keep mind children get it, that's parent/guardian's decision whether ""want it"" not. course could go ways. Or, 90% vaccination + infection. Vaccination serve limit body count get point, though. trend, India may reach casualty one year. still important thing now, idk is. Maybe you, coz freedom. Big brain time, NPR  dont think message, people thought wont get enough crowd worth everyone said nothing would happen Florida. Text book American living Canada helps understand Canadian culture much. Thank you. means wasted hundreds million vaccines. Alright world anyone slightly higher normal BMI taken parents set fat camp probably want parents executed re-educated too. me. whole office vaccinated we've stopped wearing masks building, I've gone eat times, seeing friends more. fuckin awesome. fantasy land Dentist.  
Please don’t bite. Ok, bite. job? Good hear.  also don’t need wait vaccine shipped distributed.  capacity already there. Miami pretty much walk CVS’s get Pfizer vaccine.  Worst case make appointment next day. Wow, data incredible. Kind hard picture seven-one thousandths one percent much less one-ten thousandths dying. Yes heard so, too. also seemed like earlier year US keen trying change policy quickly. DPA could've revoked time afaik. 4 million doses AZ could exported (token) ""loans"" Canada US - circumventing Trump's contract clauses. would've possible AZ doses, maybe even producers. I'm denying legal hurdles though. least social media article seems require subscription could summarize copy/paste? thats bad dude conservative Brazilian coworker says communist propaganda! denies pandemic problem Brazil! read multiple places piece protein. case right well, virus safe, less 1/million issue past immune response. 

The problem people use something like ""the vaccine produces spike proteins"" scare tactic... purpose? prolong pandemic? hope works!!! really difficult time since January finding vaccines entire family. last get 2nd dose Sat!!! sore arm amid mild 2 hour headache first (but could stress wondering going side effects. lol). quite sleepy second.  also overrun people thinks vaccines gives immunity infection lol There’s sortable chart end NPR link. 

From chart: 

Iowa 13th adult vacation%, 8th 65+ vaccination % 24th one dose administration 6th percentage total vaccines distributed. That’s better most. 

If link data indicates different, please provide it. internet probably mistake  depends live, cant make general rules without knowing situation is. would complain limited amount. US owe anything. long time. No. got big brain telling im anti science genuinely wished moment someone would nuke world. can't take anymore That’s rather awesome. I’m two weeks well haven’t gone anywhere...yet. basically phase 1/2 trials, determine optimal dose. Essentially vaccine want one size fits idiot proof though. 

Basically ship boxes anywhere same. less steps better, especially want vaccinate population globe 1-2 years. ""and stupid Pfizer kid came said 'I heard Canada last year ate dog'. explain whole class teacher heard part story"" Since people aren’t dropping dead vaccines pivot say latent effects line That’s unfortunate. district sends emails parents staff someone school tests positive. list school though unless someone close contact told information. *clearly* said does, fact, find quite annoying... even read said?  testing indian variant?

Which requires government action even would produce global production.

So link article Bill putting together system international cooperation knowledge sharing could done, Gates used money influence inside organization put stop this: 

This incorrect. Even article said would facilities around world could've making vaccines route open science manufacturing processes pursued.

 know fact how?

And incentive would Pfizer, example, spending billions without IP protection?

Why wait? company wait another go first fail succeed?

The best path manufacturing bottlenecks worked Pfizer whoever produce much can, rather waste precious resources helping countries build facilities take 5-10 years build anyway. pandemic ends prices remain high. great system boomers created.  happens they're threatening fines jail time, anyone returning within 14 days visiting India. they're expected quarantine another country. Well governor too. We're rolling back several major counties increasing restrictions, time opening schools more, one place *can't* vaccinated people young  headline pretty misleading. covid vaccine currently FDA approved age group. used emergency use authorization, different full FDA approval. Link dead, mirror alternate link? health experts Covid definitely contributed screwing us future pandemics.

Or maybe politicians monied interests, mostly partisan slant, knowingly purposefully spread misinformation cast doubt public health experts cynical attempt curry favor voter base whip murderous frenzy? Much social life theatrical. face mask element adds another layer it. *isn’t* IFR. wrong denominator (number vaccinated people opposed number infected people).

It important use terms properly. Comparing number IFR misleading. Ok that's BS anyway, I'm still loss actions AZ hostile towards UK? thought private company acting behest British government...

Edit: make weed legal. fucks sake. 2021.  quality tongue darts there.  Hey everyone, I'm wondering anyone delayed side effects vaccine?

My boyfriend got first round Moderna vaccine last Wednesday. hours later developed flu-like symptoms moderate pain arm injection was, resolved 24 hours after. boyfriend, hand, chills Wednesday night went away, developed flu-like symptoms Saturday, three days vaccination, lasted two days late Sunday night. chills, fever, night sweats, headache, body aches.

Last Wednesday night, night getting vaccinated, played frisbee outdoors group friends. Today learned one player's brothers confirmed COVID. boyfriend worried actually symptoms COVID weekend seems like vaccination symptoms last 24-48 hours vaccination make sense develop 72 hours getting vaccinated. I'm wondering anyone else vaccinated experienced delayed symptoms? Otherwise, think may COVID since long enough vaccine effective. [I want go India Alberta Canada comes mind. Ontario too, finally going little.

The world goes beyond US know. donating they? articles mostly seem like selling vaccine. merely granting poorer countries allotment vaccines.  well aware vaccines effectiveness. That's got shot first place.  that, utterly refused last year participate program could've increased production across world numerous facilities. current boom case loads spring onward would massively shunted extra doses. quite shame even pandemic, cannot get cooperation unless there's billions dollars table. is, we're going see countries vaccinated 2024 there's still shills sub refusing acknowledge harms caused this. I’m bit confused. read article day public health experts longer believing we’ll hit herd immunity US. article poised reason threshold population immunity may higher originally thought.

So... here’s part confuses me. could reach herd immunity, including natural infections? So, even enough people don’t get vaccinated, wouldn’t rest get infected eventually leading coveted herd immunity threshold? not? think get long, slow process. approval ages 12-15 within month so, help, well full approval likely end year. full FDA approval would huge would allow workplaces schools require vaccine. 

I think probably get 50% population least one shot end May, (maybe optimistic) probably 60% end summer (since 12-15 year olds probably getting shots). full FDA approval hopefully allow us break 70% years' end, approved early enough 300m Americans “unexposed”, idea getting information (if you’re actually getting anywhere)  IMO least till vaccine gets full approval vrs emergency approval. might quite bit crowded use last year would overwhelming.  Iowa right around national average, say mediocre vaccination rate, better most. little 20 states better Iowa, ranging percent better way 16% better. least 24% people fully vaccinated Arkansas that’s something.[Arkansas vaccine Thanks! too! COVID-19 classified infectious respiratory disease. It’s long known COVID-19 also neurological, GI vascular manifestations. COVID-19 also present cronic disease (long COVID) respiratory, vascular, GI neurological implications. There’s nothing new that’s well accepted based image recent work would lead reclassification COVID-19 anything primary infectious respiratory disease. quite normal. Well, normal weekend - little weekdays. Yeah get stores getting packed, although one crazy crowded. Shit, look photos Homestead Ave Prospect Ave Hartford you’ll remember they’re like 2 streets apart.  think saying odds may better 50/50, downside outweighs potential benefit enough cancel anyways. 

Essentially worst case cancel last minute, disaster due people flying able get testing might need.

Best case semi normal Oktoberfest, might cost city money worth people like it. 

They saying things bad, highly risk averse.

Of course, see can't plan local one. EU something. UK allows exports well. 

Not EU apparently. That's AZ told EU welcome open vaccine processing plant 

EU - read AZ contract...  soon make optional, many us intelligent, science-believing individuals avoid businesses

You believe science think vaccinated people need wear masks. focus needs vaccinations, full stop. Well, case didn’t understand. vaccine doesn’t work immunosuppressed won’t know feeling…likely ever! I’ll careful virus fully eradicated unlikely.  3yo 2mo old here, really cramping style! Hopefully they're able get shot soon. Tried find trial sign nearest ones 1k miles away :( yeah, actually topic article, response “it’s 100% effective it’s 100% effective, duh” name Sputnik would first clue. much propaganda exercise vaccine. vaccines help get sick also help infect others? Talking vaccines interested Sputnik V. second much important case Aw didn’t mean like that! hoping assuage concerns let know life good you’re vaccinated. Hope stay well get point, finding new friends seems bit excessive. Anybody got numbers this? Let's say half group gets vaccine. percent population much closer herd immunity? show Pfizer said vaccine wasn’t safe full approval? Maybe they’re looking one million mild side effects would bearing usage it. I’d rather make assumptions like want to. one premier vaccine scientists advisory board specific vaccines comes says difference safety I’m going trust internet speculation random redditors. Unfortunately still ways - clinical trial process bit different 6mo-11yo age conservatives know mostly anti-specifically-covid-vax. suppose could call hesitant, aren’t shy telling people they’ll regret getting vaccine. math showed work impacted populations groups.

They calculated number expected covid cases, inpatients, anticipated deaths caused delay 1 month. calculated risk hospitalization death population.

They concluded there's enough Pfizer supply risk including j&amp;j worth it.

I impressed way reached conclusion, despite skeptical decision. Now, j&amp;j offered voluntarily.... benefit outweighs risk, it. Thanks rubbing 😂  isn’t simply better matched vaccines IPs waived goal quickly increase vaccine production esp. account cold chain logistics. Yet don’t see anyone barking tree.  best response! god-awful response health experts even hint restrictions go away definitely strong effect backlash mask mandates, lockdowns, restrictions, definitely partially blame states preventing measures happening future.

The health experts Covid definitely contributed screwing us future pandemics. It’s magic wand, no. going say it’s impossible? companies agreed participate program offered fall, we’d looking vaccines manufactured already. It’s simple IP transfer. shits complex doable. talking poorer countries vaccinating 2024. It’s like can’t start help eventually. 

How exactly IP issue? Again, participated fall, we’d already seeing vaccines made facilities producing able to. We’ve got hundreds Nobel laureates, hundreds countries, god forsaken WTO, numerous manufacturing plants, saying release IP. bill gates monopolist touts industry lobbyists lines supposed write rest worlds evidence? others like switch thinking it’s okay? June? July? 2022? 2023? 

What there’s new variant don’t know vaccine work? lock everything again? recent number heard 56.x% least 1 vaccine dose far. think that's unreasonable. Peer pressure thing. go would really convince unvaccinated person sit spend evening finding appointment instead? (And spend evening mean spend 5 minutes, appointments easy find now). primary page focuses first doses, surely correct metric given effective are.

Germany 5 weeks behind US, 9 weeks behind UK. They're vaccinating roughly rate countries then, course first doses tailed US UK since.

Is Germany ""falling behind"" second doses though? first doses slow catch point. Germany's ""total doses"" rate (graph slope) appear lower US/UK respective point, though dramatically so. mom kid gnarly respiratory issues (not anywhere near severe CF) imagine relief happy you. Imagine believing word comes CCP’s mouth. constitution explicitly says citizens meet whomever want move freely may problem. eventually get remaining population catches it. got vast majority vulnerable vaccinated, shots available anyone wants one. open full simultaneously work lowering barriers vaccine (no appointments needed, pop sites people already congregating, insurance incentives, etc). Washington since governor hoarding many doses letting used. We're even going back much strict lockdown since cases rising since people can't get vaccine. pandemic broke open public discourse around issues either typically sidestepped — mental health struggles, instance — accepted little resistance, like the rigidity modern workday. returning normal life mean sweeping hard conversations back rug?

This people need think hard about. normal pandemic? implies life better now, certainly better whole. concern people return work, social settings, get socialize - feel grateful. 

We grateful returning ""normal"". idyllic utopia many seem fondly remember. better pandemic - that's fuckin worth   CDC tracks seroprevalence state I'm sure make numbers. cases seroprevalence seems decrease, counter-intuitive. 

The design looks good - 1300 samples 52 sites every two weeks blood taken non-COVID reasons. I'm puzzled by, example, NY pediatrician, confirm children young, virtually risk, really need vaccinated? 

I’m assuming access, everyone life that’s vulnerable at-risk already vaccinated now. process suppose 20 easy steps crunched time fo 5. It’s pretty sweet. I’m fully vaccinated immune conditions. It’s nice able less normal things. Still gotta wear mask places least nagging worry “what get it?” eliminated. Alright, where's source mRNA, specifically mRNA, covid vaccines could developed easily right now, IP available? expect get downvoted others Yes feeling anxious normal media blasting fear mongering get page clicks since start pandemic  Also think public schools demand vaccinations?

Universities seem be. Kids ones schools, also staff faculty. Search ""China covid"" YouTube look  Yeah biological mechanisms play 5% vaccines effective?  wonder often we'll see public wearing masks next years voluntarily get sick. feel pessimistic.

It looks like question within public confident people protectiveness vaccine. docs cautious, (many?) others optimistic. also takes time adjust pre post pandemic. understandable. Without AZ vaccines, less. We'd less...

They may managed produce many vaccines planned, vaccinated tens millions vulnerable people many countries, selling vaccine profit. confirm. Maybe less excitement 25-35 year old women. guys holding arms Said shit it’s getting downvoted lol Guessing that's problem self correct. yes unfortunate. Views Covid changed rapidly. example, vaccine hesitancy among blacks declined 59% November March. year-old Covid survey ancient data point tells us little current views.. although seem Confirmation Bias value here.  event x2
It bucket list item beer drinking, overall fun.
Just avoid grassy areas outside tents, saturated human waste (from 3 ports) mention humans. You’re talking two separate issues. It’s true US blocking raw supplies. Hence issues there. 

That’s entirely separate issue IP. refusal participate program initiated fall increase production numerous facilities world wide surely lowered production capacity today. Given vaccine manufacturing sites sitting well capacity asking IP lifted. start resolving today, help future. Don’t forget we’re talking poorer countries vaccinated 2024. It’s like throw hands say “oh well, didn’t participate fall don’t manufacturing already occurring forever give up”. Canada roughly same. Yeah, figured. catching way many downvotes snarky comments early seemed like sensible comment. way know happens, weird Arthritis type thing fist shot otherwise fine, second shot basically zero side effects. Novavax completed phase 3 tests. seem like informed decision test positive? They’re already country already spread virus would point exactly? can't people Oregon Washington follow science logic covid restrictions. tests run adults first, serious cases deaths focused adults. 

They process testing kids ensure safety. Right now, good friends still exceedingly cautious. I’ve fully vaxxed six weeks much changed stuff get “obligation” social stuff (baby showers! Easter dinner!) “fun” social stuff (drinks people! Birthday parties!). I’m exhsusted. Thanks. hoping someone knowledgeable would chime in. 

Here's hoping! finally went out! say niece nephew, parents, parents Easter (2 weeks 1st dose vaccinated), went family outdoor wider family birthday party (nephew turned 3), two weeks 2nd dose. Yesterday, went zoo. Baby steps I'm getting there. Still pretty anxious though. think Im ready maskless restaurant though. I'm aware. fair tech savvy probably hard figure get one where. that's also fading now. counties refusing vaccines awful easy make happen now. beginning took lot work sometimes staying night get done can't imagine that's case now. Hopefully lot people come senses. Fully vaccinated. first step go shopping without eye protection, even feels weird. sure long feel comfortable enough something like indoor dining. lesson that?

That better save face *no* vaccines need lose face *some* vaccines need them?

If EU waited AZ better production capacity, would done fewer vaccinations people would died. would *look* better, one would under-delivered.

Britain ""wrong"" thing EU-apologist logic, signed contracts without confirming AZ production capacity place. we've vaccinated 2/3 adult population reduced deaths 99%. There's way could done we'd made deals production capacity place. others think like make safer everyone, spread would go way down. I'd probably eat indoors. 

But beyond that, obligation go eat inside restaurant. moral imperative that. perfect. clarify original point, ""as protected I'll ever be"" point way reference actions within general control. Thus I'm seeking semblance normal life, complete abandonment social distance reverting nearly completely isolated life many us went past year. Higher levels protection beyond vaccinated involves several factors cannot control, point choice become vaccinated feel like major ""step forward"" individual it, scope greater good.  100% effective? Theres government majority approving use voluntary program would like take AZ J&amp;J vaccine. Basically offering people skip line would like accept risks. first one seems biggie happy day second Pfizer. could've worked production would've slooooww. People always talk western world can't China did. Australia actually similar pandemic policies China, except China restrict early stage (Mar./Apr. 2020). achieved good result. methods nothing political system, excuse. long leaders ball make move implement policy suggested top scientists, work eventually. idea getting voted. one reasonable positions, imo. yet, people want undue progress we've worked tirelessly achieve. that's thinking. plenty places outdoor seating could even get together hang parks, city really nice ones. No, none things true. risks 10-fold less people 20s, turn 10-fold less people 40s, turn 10-fold less people 60s. Roughly. point risk vaccine enough safety data outweighed potential benefits, trials approval kids lag instance 1,000 deaths 0-17 age bracket. significant number vacuum, well worth vaccinating prevent, still small value compared rest pandemic. Yes that’s true Covax far. It’s expected deliveries short anyway. behavior people area, misinformation people drinking in, weary out, period. never liked socializing anyways. addition loose arm, don’t hold breath. Breathe normally, try slow easy exhale. Don’t look needle, it’s likely won’t even feel it. Best wishes! Yes, giving example.  Whether unpopular debatable, long ago, people also clamoring harder lockdowns (emergency brake). think issue part badly implemented lockdowns (all shops closed, hotels closed unless business travel, real ""control"" total laissez faire) course frustration vaccine rollout feeling air summer either risk covid miss again. That's true. Vaccine neutral ppl lazy fucks need incentivized logic. circle of, say, 50 friends, probably 15 ""Eh pass walk site feel like it, I'll it"" whereas 5 anti vax. That's good percentage neutral lazy fucks respond tiny nudge. nothing life perfect. Genetics probably. like get chicken pox vaccine still get CP.  numbers make 0 sense. Including swedes? Canada dropped age AZ 40+, run it, well much meme-worthy commentary Gen-X, found exist long absence cultural relevance. 

I suspect would case countries older generation waiting so-called better vaccines, younger people grab get. know, European states use many little (and nasty) incentives like demanding negative tests entering specialised shops, state offices, gyms, hotels... vaccinated people need quarantine on. push many people towards getting vaccinated. Okay others think way you, don’t think collective thoughts might influence others? Good. Alcohol poison live Boston?  value, live like important anything else. bring end pandemic sure bring people died COVID back life. social distancing &amp; masking teenage age group really depends region from. follow insta tiktok HUGE number teens certain regions done pandemic since last summer. They've partying, skating, fun maskless big friends groups. paid price caught corona, NBD. get virus really affect health standpoint sympathize give up, would never blame them. mad props peers call reckless behavior. easy go popular sentiment age. mean. agree not? Where, exactly, idyllic utopia comparing normalcy to? here's direct link source cited Der Spiegel: Especially young black person America, life covid shit. 

Really? bad it? seek greener pastures?

Woke culture blanket statements worst thing come Pandemic. Everyone sat home thinking different ways could shout much life sucks they're smart know something one else would understand. Lol ok buddy Health authorities stress even though vaccinated individual become ill, **they still transmit virus** 

ugh, can't also stress extremely unlikely. Well CT probably reaches 70% adults first dose tomorrow. current prediction CT either mask mandate quietly drops 17th announced drop June 1st. 

Apparently businesses want mandate continue avoid make decision matter potential fights customers. (The mandate simplifies things) think going end pretty soon might continue bit longer absolutely necessary. value itself, necessarily need bring anything concrete. Let's honest first one. know several states upset get faster.  surge.  grateful returning ""normal"". idyllic utopia many seem fondly remember. better pandemic - that's fuckin worth

Well idyllic Utopias exist, that's pretty fucking stupid standard compare to. me, worst next morning, completely better morning that. Curious live. least live people wear masks right (although it’s starting change) one makes dangerous government control (it’s piece fabric) organizer protests corona restrictions made several wrongful claims pandemic mortality, according research (?) done [the newspaper] Filip Sjöström, organized several demonstrations, claimed covid-19 lead increased mortality increased pressure health care. also said covid worse flu. statements proven wrong official statistics from, among others, Statistics Sweden Swedish intensive care \- think difficult discuss statistics. Therefore would rather avoid it, sometimes bring up. maybe something stop doing, Filip Sjöström says newspaper.

Not sharpest tool shed apparently everyone's forgotten last year shitting deniers giving exact arguments give now. apparently vaccine covers every variant covid could ever throw us; despite literally proof since can't study variants exist yet. 

People seem think over, clearly not, want inconvenienced. words, feel safe media obviously exaggerating clicks. 

Just. Like. Deniers. Said. Last. Year.

I hope shit nothing happens. Fucking pissed high risk kid lost much childhood could lose even due people deciding even though experts say otherwise. 

No one actually tried explain mutations possible initial vaccines here. mutation can't make vaccines inefficient. places like India massive breeding ground leading many, many chances mutation.

Nah, downvote people ""pandemics over"" train. Much easier actually explaining anything. people probably moved longer check sub

Good point, people likely covid anxiety like people do. 12-15 tricky age actually big enough lung volume-wise spreaders virus. seen whole classrooms middle schoolers come year (masks required many schools here). higher risk say, preschoolers. problem don’t greatest data risk kids, even due lack testing children earlier pandemic. work part-time right even three tweenage patients long term heart damage due MIS-C.

Every parent pediatrician know chomping bit get kids vaccinated. I’m well aware. point it’s enough frankly.  Early mid-June Chicago aiming for. get wrong, I'm fan CCP, I'm saying, speech freedom really brings simply illusion control something, actually, don't. cost $3.3e11! Maybe literal fucking morons travelling pandemic? point, either gun jumped, ive mislead/straight lied many times find impossible afraid anymore. 

First told us millions Americans would die pretty much anyone die would inevitably get it. happen.

Then told us vaccine generation production ramp would take long able even think returning normal least 2023. Well, that's case.

Then told us variants would evade vaccine efficacy send us right back start pandemic. happen.

There's countless fear mongering stories well.

Now there's stuff like this, trying convince scared returning normalcy.

I know vested interest trying make fearful, I'm gonna deal anymore. masking, distancing, got vaccinated. I'm anymore. I've exhausted precautions available me. happens, happens. 20,000 stripped number. know nothing seems. would expect good even amazing treatments end pandemic, chances isolated cases dying it, would extremely low. idea what’s happening places I’m located PA.

Are otherwise generally healthy, get cold flu bad typically? 

The immunosuppressant likely makes vaccine good COVID worse, that's say pretty well protected. people vaccinated, better protection everyone has. Especially virus infectious this. also helps protect people literally unable get vaccine due various reasons control. maybe not! I'm fully vaccinated last couple weeks I've outdoor concert, MLB game ate two restaurants indoors. I'll admit felt uneasy first. felt weird around many people. 20+ thousand people case baseball game. take long adjust feel normal. People social creatures nature takes first step realize feels good get back things pandemic. It’s dangerous 50’s necessarily, they’ve said vaccines would practical take less risk COVID AZ vaccine linked very, small amount blood clotting events (far less average woman birth control example).

Please try understand vaccines tested thoroughly. 100’s millions administered worldwide. problem, we’d picked now! know Florida getting spring increase cases deaths, right? hand, fortune favors bold. we’re throwing quotes justify opinions. Yup, codeswitch office deal microaggression BS fun. Hopefully mental health sticks taken seriously give people flexibility empathy lives this. simplified I'm doctor, vaccines basically ""training"" immune system. weakened/dead viruses used body form antibodies memory cells keep means fight viruses become reinfected line. capability fight reinfection means ""immune"" based virus's DNA overall health immune system.

Mine lasted two days. Day 1 major chills Day 2 mostly muscle aches bad headache.

However, change environment 20X likely get vaccinated, actually likely get before. indoors without mask around strangers without masks would far dangerous thing I've done regarding COVID. Many, many times likely get COVID way anything I've done last world people getting vaccinated can’t accept immensely lower risk levels get back normal activities.

Because greatly lower spread virus, adds another good layer protection. ANOTHER way vaccines protect us.  I'm vaccinated now. 

When wife gets fully vaccinated spread low area, I'll ready lot things. 3 weeks, spread dropping quite bit area. long ready things. would imagine, republican states, government tries march us ceaselessly dumbest civil war history

We're marching towards civil war. ridiculous claim. would yourself?

Kinda makes sense allergies. people, like me, get incredibly drowsy allergy meds, even ones ""non-drowsy"".  can't possible, even hosting 15,000 people UFC 261. /s three want milk, meat, yogurt.

Protein, protein, protein. Yeah, making dumb joke. so? Well, government warned Astrazeneca damgerous 50. please tell vaccines available use mRNA technology? I'm fully vaccinated still take precautions going (Masks, Hand sanitizers, washing hands, etc.) leave house except work utmost urgency (Though diminished, especially Ramadan) sure getting downvoted absolutely correct. vaccines also showing 100% protection death hospitalization. That's important thing. COVID always us. key reach point killing many people. doubt. 12 year old son 120 pounds now. wife also 120 pounds.  last sentence really cements absorb anything anyone saying, obviously said you.

That's shame. [Yes. vaccines work. Yes people like not, nobody put jail insulting them. Meanwhile we’re headed *back* 25% capacity things Washington  different vaccine. approached way Pfizer, Pfizer Moderna produced mRNA vaccines result spike protein created body, exactly same. Cheap marketing propaganda. saw opportunity jumped profits, along huge government support obvious reasons. 

The “we cared patients lives” bullshit. mean I'll go out, I'm delusional. get decent vaccination rates it'd like attending high school knowing 50% students anti-vaxxers. Even go fully vaccinated that's little disconcerting knowing vaccines work. Sounds right. weird people can't dialog topic strategies countering paramount herd immunity states.  thank American media scaring people much even vaccines won’t convince return normal life. province approve vaccine Health Canada didn't? I've heard exact excuse. fucking infuriating. Common ones include ""well people around get dont bad reaction so"" ignorance maddening. Moderna manufacturing outside US, prioritized Switzerland EU avoid export bans Looks like good job providing protection hospitalization. definitely help prevent healthcare system collapse reduce hospital’s workload etc. 
For protection symptomatic COVID, surprised see wide gap (84% 50%). virus Turkey Brazil belong different variants? wear bib time, eat, fucking idiot? One, don’t know shit kid health conditions make kind judgment risk level. Two, vaccinating children removes reservoir virus circulate mutate way could make harmful rest us. Three, novel virus vascular complications, don’t know long-term effects. Four, Pfizer’s trial showed 100% efficacy adolescents. Take dick jam windpipe rest us don’t listen stupid bullshit. Depends else going it, it’s usually “involuntary” child abuse thing. don’t see degree outside severe poverty, poor education, low IQ parents usually concert altogether. time complete biopsychosocial breakdown within family, it’s never malicious intent. I’ve never reported obesity alone. have, however, reported parental failure address type 2 diabetes obese child. Obesity absolutely correlated poor outcomes. However *a lot* people hospitalized fit without preexisting conditions. say judging yeah, displaying cognitive bias. 

My clinic transfered otherwise healthy 50 yr old today hospitalized. Yesterday transferred otherwise healthy 53 year old. figured need vaccine bc healthy they'd fine. moderate, diffuse infiltrate pneumonias associated rapid decline ARDS. seen story play again. sick people thinking fatties sick people get seriously ill covid. based reality. biased self wants believe you, I’m sick country become.

My rational self can’t find lot articles supporting claims. eventually get sick.

And keep COVID going, creating new variants, infecting immune compromised people cannot get vaccine, ultimately prevent America ever reaching herd immunity.  

Selfish even begin describe people. Good. Let's stop circulation mutating. tracking TEN new variants now.

Remember entire pandemic started one single person year ago today 3mil people died it. It’s enough get one single infected person country infect many others cause lot deaths. would personally love live civilized country like Australia cares it’s people much. ""Don't believe China's numbers"" /s

Then imperative people believe nothing done contain virus. Difference Chinese US numbers match different responses. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Just stay fuck away idiots wear masks get vaccinated. I've heard, almost one allowed China. They're absolute strictest allowed in. think Chinese nationals come right now. Plus, despite little western cultures okay (for good many vs rights individual), they're authoritarian force people quarantine. 

I think they'd allow another Wuhan happen matter what. maiming them. Reveddit extension showing removed notice. Pfizer available 12-16 year olds early summer. Fake ID time? Yes American adults eager get shot, would happen later, soon furthermore exports guess, also would happen case high demand US. It’s government numbers, death toll truly control wouldn’t able hide bodies. That’s I’m curious about. scenes mass graves like Brazil India?  good percentage neutral lazy fucks 

I love words order.

Like Neutral Milk Hotel cover band.

Time take walk past vaccination site then. possibly imagine number Americans trying get Canada? There’s Pacific stop them. It’s almost like Mexicans trying get US, smaller scale. almost thousand per week, many attempts unlawful. I've met southern california. blow off, they're there. people pushed covid hysteria hard willing come now. 20s, loved going drinks coworkers.

But time went got older tolerance alcohol grew less ... started become chore.    sure based on

Thought would comment well. [It literally new goal give first dose adults week 35, i.e. September 5. earlier goal would achieved end June. new official Swedish goal, something pulled ass.

The reasons cited delay are:

* Changed vaccine delivery prognosis
* Janssen's vaccine suspended
* Persons 65 given one dose AstraZeneca able/recommended choose mRNA vaccine second dose
* Shorter intervals doses (6 5 weeks mRNA 12 9 weeks AZ) “How exactly IP issue?” Because, discussed, manufacturing capacity issue. available capacity used, vaccine makers aggressively building - investments justified ability sell vaccines produced there.

Removing ability get paid building factories means fewer factories built. exactly opposite needs happen.

Everyone wants accelerate worldwide vaccination effort - including vaccine makers. We’re race save lives, we’ve seen unprecedented collaborations massive investments production. 

An IP waiver simply relevant process, manufacturing expertise quality control processes far important successfully producing vaccines. single bad batch third party produced vaccine doesn’t meet quality standards would inconceivable amounts damage worldwide vaccination effort.  exports still (beyond already agreed upon Mexico/Canada).  Lethal doses, must take  guess specified activities meant. Obviously things closed gradually opening, including museums, zoos etc. know indoor dining restrictions bar restrictions. Next time I’ll exact expect people read mind this..

If forced to, go indoor dining areas US business reasons only. happy it, understand life risks mitigated mine much possible. customers billing rates increased commensurate additional perceived actual risk. big deal, capitalism work.

In home city go case rates start dropping (and/or aforementioned business rule). Based worldwide data seems somewhere 60% fully vaccinated stage game, area probably 4-6 weeks trends continue.

Note applies indoor dining similar indoor activities. I've patronizing outdoor patios since last spring obvious science showed outdoor spread likely background noise. science support outdoor patio dining meaningfully less safe getting takeout. mean Facebook full factual data based information! true, read Facebook Facebook safe! card cute nobody asks see it. Right. Every covid vaccine ultimately presents spike antigen, matter method. Ridiculous. little dude better chance struck lightning covid casualty. Young people need vaccine, prevent catching virus. Never said vaccine prevents getting Covid. 

You specifically said symptomatic Covid. seem assume 5% response vaccinated. isn’t correct. 

Vaccinated people get Covid mostly mild cases. Additionally it’s virtually zero deaths. 

This isn’t breakthrough data anymore. Israel many states similar results vaccines

It’s wrong underrepresent vaccine benefit keep fear mongering. I'm at, mix. We've cloudy colder days recently, also warm days too. Fox news almost exclusively watched 65+ age group, again, showing extremely high vaccine uptake. 


Stop trying politicize vaccines. Learned syntax master must have.  Nope, spikes broken fragments, all. cells also present spike surface. told seek help mentioned would still cautious getting vaccinated. It’s previous governors left CT huge hole. need make weed legal. 

Lamont fantastic throughout Pandemic, vaccine distribution plan top notch. grateful live CT throughout mess. went 1,244 1,366. really sound like big deal. Using percentages would imply numbers much larger. Political parties really turned people opposite side things every issue, right wrong. offer tl;dr? 86% delivered vaccines used. near top. Yes we're Iowa people want rushing get it. Yay! kid ready go!   B.1.1.7 becoming dominant variant community.

Is data effective mRNA vaccines it? keep seeing *effective*, anything effective compared initial studies? far tell, vaccine sites could better utilized IP restrictions lifted. certainly manufacturing capacity could expand with, raw materials primary constraint.

There’s “giving up” - right things happening accelerate production coming MK years. It’s IP waiver isn’t thing that’s needed accelerate production, vaccine makers *already* selling developing nations cost. knew saw compelling paper past two days. think everyone mandated take vaccine. REALLY bad reaction second shot I'm STILL saying this. duty fellow human beings. L452R antibodies work. also warmer fully outdoor weather California now, right?  enforcement NYC work? know Chicago occasionally send inspectors city issued almost 500k fines places (usually overcrowding, ignoring curfew, masks), seems happening less often. think places quietly ignore rules city quietly look way? feels like starting happen here. mean...hyperbole context pretty stupid. 

""We eager return normal. Normal candy land money trees like people fondly remember""

See? statement literally meaning makes impact, substance. word soup. 

Words meaning. Utilize meanings get point across instead saying dumb shit writing ""LOL PRANK BRO XD"" I’m waiting see cases stabilize. Right Michigan dramatic decline cases (our 7-day average half two weeks ago), I’m going wait see stops start mingling strangers again. Granted, I’ve always bit homebody, don’t mind staying home little longer. Odd name committee lol paid price caught corona, NBD.

It's big deal mother father catches die it. people sense humour. ask half reddit people act like vaccines offer mild protection covid still deadly ever. think actively hurting vaccine effort. Don’t man. think read around 17 million 12-15 year olds US. “The following day one died.” Hi - tested COVID positive December' 2020. symptoms follows

Day-1 Day-10 - Temperatures 103 Oxygen levels 95+

On day-11 day-15 - developed severe itchy rashes body.

Day-16-20 - Loss taste smell

My doctor told body rashes could due hyper-active immune system. advised Anti-Histamines. least me, anti-histamines helped curing itchiness rashes.

Now, extremely worried taking vaccine. scared skin rashes might resurface. Anyone boat got Pfizer, Moderna JJ vaccine? rashes come post vaccination? you’re saying political rallies religious celebrations cause major outbreak. Interesting borrow Gov. MA? Boston's acting mayor today defending 8/22 re-opening date expedited despite top 5 vax metrics. Yes, agree. I’m waiting tad bit longer need move forward life. Dane here, choice AZ/J&amp;J vaccines vaccine, wouldn’t hesitate second get them. since alternative getting Pfizer/Moderna vaccine month later, guess handle lockdown bit longer. 

Honestly, think hardest part getting vaccinated later, risk missing another summer. 

At point grandparents gotten 2nd shot (and complaining Facebook got terribly sick day two shot), parents get 1st shot month, siblings get first shot next month, latest start July. 

Generally, population positive towards vaccine (I think recent survey amount younger people found 85-90% would get vaccine). But, unlike redditors barely locate Denmark world map, also trust government believe making correct decisions us. kinda waiting sort response ;)

Would apply OP found necessary argue Germany still vaccinating slower?  lol think major issue want massive difference lives ""haves"" ""have nots"". family pretty torn whole ""seriously, allowed indoors around kids vaccinated"" thing, another family know. families, far-right people somehow offended kids' parents treating people's vaccination status health risk kids.

There's already massive conflict brewing beginning bubble over. people want get vaccinated, we're **slam** brick wall numbers everyone wants vaccinated started process.

I think there's hope social pressure societal pressure push people line getting vaccine. moment government really starts pushing hard pro-vaccine messaging moment ton people become vehemently anti-vaccine. instead passively convinced get people know that's big win.

More that, pretty difficult quagmire ahead. Kids refused public school without vaccination record, adults lot protections likely lie suits them. vaccinated people allowed X Y, even pushed business owners, assume lot people turn hill die on. think makes perfect, brutal, sense. mean situation? learn cope something utterly egregious. We'll living covid deniers anti-vax idiots essentially complicit murder thousands upon thousands, situation cigarettes. statement meant provocative. time there's truth it, truth status quo. Ugly, unacceptable truth. 

Obviously putting way meant accept situation, meant try provoke reaction, wake people up. kind quiet, dark, everyday apocalyptic vision. I'm sure there's ways putting similar. They're worth exploring, think. Like could imagine poster says something like ""this live anti-vaxers."" caption would picture somebody oxygen machine maybe picture people funeral.

The idea cigarettes commensurate problem. short statement captures quite lot ask me. post heavily downvoted? Awesome. news younger kids? guesstimate percentage get it? That’s massive I'm hoping mask rules airplanes last while. places densely populated, poorly cleaned. It’s actually new mutation. wave different normal wave original strain. People dying within 3-4 days onset symptoms stupid ass florida. People dying. need vaccines. 
At point wouldn’t want access doses, even cost more? 

We 50k vaccinated population 1.3 million. hospitals 50% capacity maxed 10 days tide doesn’t turn soon. Also shows infectious Covid is, completely destroyed flu measures took, still tonnes people dying. It’s gunna take while. 2nd shot three weeks ago. I’m still edgy. wasn’t good colds flu this, didn’t really get worse me, felt bit prepared guess. It’s holding though. don’t tell go Brazil visit hospitals there. volunteer time report back sees. sounds kinda desperate hilarious saying ""after 3 months we're finally 0.04 doses per 100 faster, HA! Get rekt UK!""  
 
But good. good hear Europe's vaccinations finally picking up. people world vaccinated better. “In Connecticut, 1,980,863 people (55.6%) received least one dose 1,425,477 (40.0%) fully vaccinated.” According Yeah nah, good job Pakistan I'm still sceptical this. feel like it’s much new variant that’s main cause hell India, rather counties poor vaccine drive, Government opening things way soon people vaccinated. large political rallies religious celebrations didn’t help matters. someone lives CT, add praise. getting vaccinated (I antibodies got corona year ago though, got tested weeks ago confirm). guarantee don’t catch COVID intervening period, sure, COVID 95x higher rate CVT compared general population compared small increase risk vaccine. Death’s serious outcome COVID. Strokes pneumonia real bad. small study Italy showing Pfizer vaccine may work well obese adults. sure increased dose would helped, vaccines given higher doses older people immune system respond well. Mine too, meant actual paperwork vaccination interesting! article state first shot previously infected people similar immune response second shot people covid. Could something immunity floating around interacts vaccine causing strong side effects second dose. hey im scientist interesting see research it! Weird must've read data wrong read wrong stat get it. Get grip.

It's irrational anxiety. Saying get rip exactly helpful. Unfortunately Fauci made unwise decision announce continue stay locked even taking vaccine, opposite that. Even logically sound advice, it’s positively counterproductive terms gamifying vaccination process get people want get vaccinated. Reinfection going happen. one may story risk real, especially / variants gain escape antibody mechanisms. Naturally acquired immunity vulnerable understand.

Get vaccinated everybody! ""Some academics criticized nights “[human guinea-pig Iain Buchan University Liverpool, scientist leading trials, insisted [Covid-19 rates low chances outbreak slim. ""

I'd agree ""some academics"". another note great coming onto front page sub see smattering ""good news"" extreme example, unvaccinated person Australia currently safer vaccinated person US due basically zero community spread Australia.

The problem disease likely going endemic. basically means like flu going away. main reason covid high fatality rate compared infections novel disease immune systems never seen anything like it. Vaccines save many lives. everyone chance get vaccination safest society going get. going need learn live deadly disease fear rest lives. fair using logic may never see end. Chances seem high Covid goes endemic continues mutate years come. Also using logic people wear masks probably statistically irrelevant total mutations possible since US isn’t largest source cases anymore. I’m disagreeing logic saying sounds like mad total situation probably placing blame incorrectly. one proud US handled pandemic last year place blame fully vaccinated people wanting return normal seems like stretch. saying Acetaminophen generally dosed 15mg/kg every 4 hours. 96lbs hits 2 x 325mg tablets. 

Another fun fact US, children’s acetaminophen, children’s ibuprofen, children’s diphenhydramine suspensions calculate volume/dose. 25lb kid would get 5ml (even though different mg/kg/dose mg/ml volume). actually don’t. testing vaccine see kids need less. think flu vaccine usually higher dose elderly too. receive payment, workers must provide proof vaccination human resource departments agree receive booster shots recommended Centers Disease Control Prevention next 18 months.  u wut mate one joint less baked.

It sounds like doesn’t want fumble 5 yard line. He’s several weeks away full efficacy makes sense wants extra cautious now. They're spreading though. indescribably grateful live Australia throughout entire pandemic.

One thing that’s interesting people know covid got vaccine tended strong reaction first dose reaction second. know 10 people applied to, 10 reaction second shot.  Albertain here.

We’re fucked ourselves. longer case May, so? believe vaccine export ban ended April. social event nothing

It's cop excuse. bet person even go dinner friend. Trust bayonet boy - level faux-victimhood ain't healthy :/

Nobody begrudging US' speedy vaccine rollout. come cost others, arguably part thanks export bans. I'm ugly prefer look mask. ^ this!!  Yes did, 45 helm think really choice that. realized much hurt us tried correct that. definitely become regional year learned ever wanted know droplets many micro particles spit go flying around anytime anyone speaks. Even without COVID, that’s still pretty gross. I’ll find way push back mind I’m sure. Eventually. partially agree, kids getting shots safe. mostly stop spread virus kids major spreaders.

Not mention kid wants knocked sick week stay Hawaii. three basically 100% effective serious covid.

AstraZeneca believe around 80% effective asymptomatic Covid 3 week gap, must higher 6 week gap.

I'd take vaccine available Mexico, Sputnik/AZ/Pfizer/Cansino/Sinovac feel super safe. We’ve got Brazil variant T&amp;T. daily cases deaths highest they’ve been. 

We aren’t getting vaccines expected thru COVAX. 

At point we’re trying get many people possible get first dose. 

Less 50k people 1.3 million vaccinated far. 

The worst part lockdown could avoided far many people gathering socializing Covid thing past. 

Our hospitals 50% capacity and, given current rates, we’re looking 7-10 days beds available. 

I’m hoping number cases starts going soon damage isn’t already done. possible, though? time, won’t people left?

The virus hits wall eventually, everyone’s either vaccinated, it.

Or rather, “everyone,” hit point enough people immune can’t spread aren’t immune easily. Vaccinating EVERYONE helps curb spread virus possibility mutating.

What ridiculous thing say. There's way know 100% certainty person wrong. vaccines new know sure. I'm 99.99999% sure they're wrong, ""science"" can't prove right real data dependent several years passing.

I know LOT folks drove Texas Motor Speedway Denton shots. well organized felt like less exposure drive distribution center. Several folks know high risk went route. Lots friends drove elderly folks since worried exposure well walking/waiting line. 

I think bumped numbers administered coupled low population makes appear though high per capita immunization rates. also think Tarrant County numbers lagging. lot us go elsewhere. so? Oregon's (and hope say Washington's) rise already begun plateau. 14 weeks? Huh? vaccine? getting guidance from? normal feel soreness fact?  barely felt soreness afterwards tho hurt later either Honestly, paid close attention well Caribbean nations done (looks like pretty well?), agree. relatively small amount vaccines could basically eliminate chance large outbreaks countries ever occurring allow open tourism industries little risk outbreaks. 

I really worry situation we're seeing India (and Brazil) repeated month elsewhere Americas could lot prevent we're taking delivery vaccines we're able use. argument made that, people vaccinated essential workers yet. non- essential workers vaccinated home (retired work home)are spreading exposed it. says ""may"" need.

Hey baby, put ass...for science? feel anything, seen going known. hurt later on. planning make AZ J&amp;J vaccines available volunteers, honestly doesn’t make much sense point.

Covid causes blot clots, so... makes sense we'll see vaccine. BUT, much smaller numbers.

This like mRNA vaccines far - we're skipping step; maybe step causes severe side effects. 

I get AZ vaccine option. I'm Alberta we're moving desperate territory. short term side effects AZ pretty bad - get much sleep night, lot pain. worried getting blood clot myself, little worrisome. hope mRNAs prove safer become norm future (or get oral vaccines working). going blame Trump recommendations Fauci colleagues? course choice. choose lying (whether good bad reason, really matter) attempting harm, chose lie. stand corrected.

I could list hundred links, here's one last half day: CDC acknowledges much: needs accept basic truths COVID:
- Elderly obese = high risk, young healthy = low risk
- kids rarely spread (likewise school general)
- outdoor activities rarely spread it
- seasonality matters 

We would make 5x better decisions followed simple facts, know 9 months. Honestly, feel fully comfortable deaths state least week. start relax wear mask.

""It's mostly occurring group risk severe disease anyway, elderly. people frail elderly,"" said Calum Semple, University Liverpool professor child health outbreak medicine, co-led research.

""We're saying vaccine work,"" told briefing. ""In fact good real-world evidence working. also shows vaccine perfect.""

The data, presented UK's Scientific Advisory Group Emergencies last week published online SAGE Friday, showed among 52,000 hospitalised COVID-19 patients studied, 526 vaccinated first dose either AstraZeneca Pfizer shot least three weeks earlier. those, 113 died.

The vast majority post-vaccination COVID-19 cases fatalities among vulnerable, elderly people, researchers said.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Agree, maybe work team taking care victims week. estimated, instance Dr. John Campbell vidcast, official death figures factor around 4. thus already deaths exceeding 10k per day. Possibly couple doublings already baked in.  
  

The case testing seems top capacity around 3.6-4 Lakh per day. upgrades, people, upgrades! strong supporter calls national savior. Correct. “all time low” hospitalizations California would probably around 1850. Well vaccines give 10-50 times higher antibodies regular infection, could posit protective, especially variants, previous infection.

And variants would theoretically prevent kind natural herd immunity like common cold -- like everyone common cold that's nobody gets sick next winter. Apologies lack clarity. responding aspect comment, Moderna-specific. US blocks exports vaccines also exports vaccine components, leading supply chain issues around world.... except US. discussions says family say everything normal, people getting sick even remotely bad 

I contractor one guys management team. worth pissing I've already. 

I can't believe people living denial based political views. Great post. I'm coming unfortunate conclusion public health officials feel message based current goals even involves half-truth (or worse). 

For example, wanted preserve masks PPE medical personnel said masks effective (or worse). 

Then pushed low-ball herd immunity figure (going 60-70% steadily moving up). quote NY Times ""In telephone interview next day, Dr. Fauci acknowledged slowly deliberately moving goal posts. so, said, partly based new science, partly gut feeling country finally ready hear really thinks.""

Now we're seeing unwillingness say fully vaccinated people go back normal life without masks lower social stigma unvaccinated people stop wearing masks well.

In case get point they're short term believe they're real damage credibility public health even among us fully board science. first I've seen reference long time appreciate That's exactly right. longer covid lingers around spreads un-vaccinated vulnerable countries time mutate evolve nastier strain. recalcitrance around getting vaccine basic safety precautions giving fertile ground continue spread evolve. first strains may relatively tame compared future strains spread easily deadly. I'm sure Germany much less hesitancy US. Definitely worse UK great uptake. hesitancy changes people get vaccinated wait time see US Germany end % vaccinated. pull kids school today due state longer mandating masks. 8 year old came home really sad today person classroom wearing one, teacher included. getting picked day.

Stanford Medicine Wednesday began administering shots children ages 2 5 trial Pfizer coronavirus vaccine, marking another step forward getting younger children trial part larger, nationwide Pfizer study testing vaccine children young 6 months old. advancement pediatric vaccine trials important even though children lower risk adults developing severe disease dying COVID-19, many nonetheless fallen ill died. also critical inoculate children order reach higher immunity levels overall population, since spread virus others even become need make sure children protected,” said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, pediatric infectious diseases expert leading trial Stanford. “There’s 3 million children infected, thousands hospitalized almost 300 deaths. Even though it’s half million-plus adult deaths we’ve seen, we’ve seen impact children want make sure they’re protected. transmit others want make sure protect community 3.5 million children United States infected COVID-19, representing 13.5% overall U.S. cases, according American Academy Pediatrics. 347 children died, representing less 1% overall U.S. COVID-19 vaccines slated tested, authorized rolled descending order age. Currently, Pfizer vaccine given people young 16, Moderna Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines given people young 18. Younger groups expected come next, starting adolescents younger teens, followed children, toddlers babies young 6 months last week applied Food Drug Administration authorization vaccine used youths ages 12 15, clinical trial data showed 100% effective preventing COVID-19 symptoms age group.

Yes, replies like: ""Won't somebody think poor, destitute pharmaceutical companies""? argument made allowing profits pharma, two minds issue. Nevertheless, people seem default support big pharma often unethical things, rides top publicly-funded R&amp;D seems like devolved anti-medicine rant  highly unlikely US, drug company anyone able pay, pay damages. 

Perfect example epidural steroid injections causing arachnoiditis. known well documented ESI's cause arachnoiditis. known since JFK office. Yet, hand like candy quick profitable way alleviate back pain. dont tell even though insurance policies problem paying without question, drug used isnt FDA approved use end hurt drug and/or doctor error there's nothing compensation people end disabled life it. 18 month 3 year old home. It’s anxiety. Insanity perhaps. 1st time someone prove got covid vaccinated individual, we're going see 50 million articles vaccine work.

They’re running again, gas still hovering pretty high. I’m sure OPEC nothing it. Wow lot second doses. start prioritizing first doses? no, that's absurd. Using percentages imply anything magnitudes, implies proportions. Learn percentage. 0 hundred years. All-time low? That's awful percentage never binary, people understand nuance. ""Per capita"" brings issues. CA's population nearly 40mil WA's combined near 12mil. massive population much closer proximity one another increases risk spread. Looking CA whole comes things like make sense. never ever go back precovid normal BC beat 🤣

Get vaccinated get Godzilla day. would send vaccination rates roof. Well according mine still slower, numbers currently volatile bank holiday weekend UK reporting vaccinations get delayed rest week.


But hey, better. 1 week vaccines approved 12-15 demo, bet stupid clickbait headline saying ""teens arent getting vaccinated, why?"" someone different risk tolerance mean ignorant. issues play besides hospitalization death. People say masks ""go away"" end year- that's factoring whatsoever private malls, private sports stadiums, private music concerts, private amusement parks aka.. virtually anything large setting involves entertainment inevitably mask mandate good position time sort proof vaccination.

Now people anti vax get fake ones? what? Masks around longer people think, especially depending activities consider ""normal life"". Sorry hear family. hope everyone recovered well. apply muscle Assuming natural r number 2.6, relatively high estimate, would need 65% vaccinated hit R 0.91. Add natural immunity infections far lower even that. really think aren’t using pandemic excuse oppress people even more? % tickets given lack social distancing protesters? massive %  Maybe so, honestly say kniwn becoming friend, would never friend first place. despise HK govt betraying people Hong Kong.

1) regions far less 60% vaccination still get hit hard even highly vaccinated states ok. 

2) Covid likely higher R0 Winter, might get lulled false sense security covid falling almost 0 Summer. end restrictions get hammered Winter. one saying anything wrong AZ J&amp;J.

However, possible get voluntary basis.  Moderna. Moderna bunch patents keeping mRNA stable  Def go see doctor. They'll refer neurologist physical therapist figure what's going on. I’m sure change allow us take J&amp;J AZ voluntary basis, reckon will. work US? tell vaccine get signup? remember months ago, way around ""new day time high covid cases deaths"" damn good see changes considering scarse vaccine moment, would pretty good news 10-20% people needing one dose.  Yes that’s allowed. Two weeks another country. flight ban two weeks anyway. know ... taking comfort fact like half kids hangs able vaccinated least - middle school. question is, vulnerable vaccinated even deep South, care small bump? know small bumps South summer amongst unvaccinated cause ""different reality"". Every state achieve equivalent herd immunity despite vaccination rates - cases get point. sweeping generalizations verbal attacks reveal kind person are. You’ve lost credibility. They're suffering kinds care capacity shortages countries barely managed avoid, notable exceptions like Italy.

The death rate really goes access care becomes unavailable. Otherwise survivable cases quickly turn critical.

My fear enough ability mobilize urgent care get ground address growing rates. really tragic know could done available resources fully prepare this. curiosity, why? makes sense pre-school/daycare settings. flu spreads often quite burden young, staff cares them. states I’ve lived hasn’t required pre grade school though. Maybe should. don’t know. I’m saying risk/benefit analysis covid vaccine children easy one make. Even get mild complications vaccine don’t feel well days.. thats potentially would covid.  really ought include flu vaccine least offer every year schools. Kids uninsured offered free. colleges too. make awfully sick. Almost killed young healthy. God, wimp. Trials started month ago - expect ready vaccinate late ‘21/early ‘22.  point arguing. people convinced world ending, nothing say change mind. headline little misleading. Iowa badly vaccinations, 40% population, 23rd country, top half. 

What article actually says counties accepting vaccines know confidently administer refusing rest areas use them, makes sense. Bioequivalence relevant small molecules. ""prove bioequivalence"" biologics vaccines. Biologics vaccines treated differently regulatory perspective. yes Absolutely agree. Threw poor kid bus, expecting airline look like villain immediately giving “autism” claim. posting child’s photo news? exploits kids like this?

Yes, people agenda happy go viral. point thing keeping us going back normal us Wow. must care much constituents. ::eyeroll:: lack medical facilities large scale...They missed totally flattening curve second wave. know people mentality “why would get vaccine?

Why would CDC change reccomendations appeal people aren’t following recommendations first place? know lot people flat don’t want vaccine, feel like need “legitimate” sounding excuse get it. kid school 100% person since august. K-5 100% person. 6-12 hybrid. 10,000 students. 150 cases covid. Zero traced school spread. infection rate 1.5%. Community infection rate 4%. They’ve had, still wear masks entire time school. She’s 7. It’s fucking pathetic anti science bullshit ever seen. annual flu shot required pre-school/daycare NJ, may state-specific.

Yes, school, targeting younger kids one. factories could increase production. disagree reality. You’re different antivaxxers denying reality. Yep surely holdouts rejoin society things public etc. they'll minority thankfully rest us locked waiting them.

When drive, worry whether people wearing seat belt. 7-day average unlinked cases still less 5 IIRC  That's fair risk mitigation I'm sorry, kid autism good reason exception rule time. pandemic, need think everyone here, allowing extra time tests perfectly reasonable exceptions make disabled population. Covid give shit kid Autism. vaccines stop catching covid, stop mutations.

Unfortunately never eradicated. Damn never thought I’d hear say particular point time. listen Osterholm Update podcast, he’s predicting around time it’d highly likely US would’ve experiencing another big surge . It’d interesting maintains “party hard” stance weeks episode. you’re smarter CDC “looked data”? choice point. house guests 4 5 weekends including weekend.

Thank clarification. I'm 100% expert, like call obvious nonsense see it. [Flu pneumonia literally nearly 3x children covid. Neither vaccine required children. Neither require mask. Neither “concerned parent” pulls kid school over. - unless kid underlying issues suppress immune system. kid hates anything near ears. can't stand getting haircut fight kicking screaming getting hair washed trying clean ears.  


He wear mask, worked really friggin hard it. Parenting, concept. Find article mentions end 2023. Exactly. see people copd saying reason wear mask, particularly vigilant. issue feeling able breathe triggers panic attack, take time acclimate mask. may easy, protection. I’m Bermuda. Enough vaccines everyone still dummies lockdown. death everyday week two   studies show effective transmission?  Something something history repeating itself.  Probably people 18 years age make 22% total population?

(Actually 23.1% according Doctor? pretty encouraging closing 65% 50 64. zero hard data support this, true anti vaxxers come across fall age range. hand, younger people know gotten yet apathetic anything else. 

If max 85% 65+ 75% 50-64, need reach 60% &lt;50 get 2/3 vaccinated overall. know rate change depressing days, seems virtually certain eventually reach 60% vaccinated point 65%+ definitely still play. going summer I'm going blame Trump knowing severity since January consistently lying downplaying risks. undermined social distancing mask mandates stay home orders every turn. Hell, first thing released hospital still covid remove mask front cameras.
He applied pressure CDC early messaging, resulted inconsistent messaging mistrust some. current administration believe messaging closely adheres science, we've shown they're willing compromise pressure know Iain Buchan academic would care I've vaccinated?

It's ""not option"", tried before. Here's article three law school professors/director legal option.

You got like, 5 mil doses laying around? Jonesing real hard Thanks report. statistics/reports median age deaths? especially curious whether Indian variant dangerous population younger 50 years old. political choice strict priority system based age 

No, actually obvious democratic choice, one pretty much every country guess, already vaccinated boomer dreaming summer Mallorca?

No, I'm actually younger person dreaming summer Mallorca, I'm absolutely confident happen people age. Huh. Looks like cactus. Seems appropriate. that?  Sounds like buying lot conspiracy theories there. countries tried. Every single verifiable country enforced blanket lockdowns restrictions everybody. Sweden included, pull out.

In fact, wrong.

Sweden tried exactly that, relying people's personal responsibility asking high risk individuals stay home never enforcing strict general lockdowns. got nowhere.  thanks would said ""party hearty Marty"" Well fuck duck.

I’ll tell believed household imminent danger death serious lifelong consequences contracting virus would matter consequence. We’re healthy high risk category (actually I’m smoker I’m risk I’m vaxxed) wear masks, social distance youngest back school two days week I’m fine protect kids so... chose, personally, wait. old he? obese? cant seem anything else disappointed country. someone explain now? set wait til next week. stopped keeping count individual cases July 2009, focused major outbreaks that. know anyone kept global track unfortunately.

The point pandemic declared global situation really notice anymore.

I think media driven pandemic time though. Scare mongering tabloid reporting keep enough people scared long time.   3,900,000,000 BCE Young people lower risk death virus cost benefit analysis little different, even younger people still lot safer. chances ending hospitalized ICU many times greated COVID vaccines, true chance dying.

5yo 2yo here. We're anxiously awaiting approval ages get covered well. ask why? thought kids nearly severe course disease? Seems pretty ok would say. Good. deserve it. understanding same. Vaccines apparently different medications.  Body mass doesn’t affect dosing. expert though. ...if strong immune response 1st 2nd jab means it?   less trust Government protecting data companies like Apple example. said... best way protect personal data hand anyone. Really wish Japan would pull together. wife kids planning visiting family 2020....they home since 2018 (we moving Germany US summer 2019). know Japanese citizens get (which are), wife vaccinated kids obviously not, parents late 70s since Japan dropping ball vaccines, vaccinated, either, risk high, plus huge costs PCR tests Japan ($300/pop) required upon arrival departure, feasible....as much enjoy visiting Japan, wife's family home country that's concern is. Yea 2029 seems right crash happens every 10 year. think people put figures context. Hundreds millions peanuts compared Big Pharma companies actually make year. Vaccines least profitable pharma sector, biggest global players (e.g., Roche Novartis) stayed away since beginning. think increasing production globally anything inhibiting nations supply? diverting produced vaccines. manufacturing facilities begin producing vaccines. No, masks like covering sneeze, efficiently. sneeze people? new survey conducted National Rural Health Association Chartis Center Rural Health showed 30% 160 rural hospital executives responded said less half employees vaccinated — even though health care workers eligible months now. third said 70% staff vaccinated.

Oof. Israel 94% number asymptomatic. Slightly higher symptomatic recall. Time fill pool champagne?  [Here’s let’s see goes. fear mongering. true story. client, female dentist got corona 6 days first jab (NYC, super heathy). hospitalized. Lived it. long flu? virulent? still take extra precautions. know think cute, government hasn’t big problems companies like Experian. also already data it’s matter centralizing usable system. lastly, saw Experian private company screws accountability, government screws voted out. dont understand Osterholms burns people bad.

He makes shitty predictions dont seem affect policy? OK... ignore him. Look guy thinking us politics easy lmao latter - amending EUA allow 12-15 year olds.   Clubs AZ back open full capacity already though. I'm sure states US lifted restrictions.  saves giving articles traffic US beginning well. quietly kept covids isolated Noone saw bad initially relatives friends coworkers started dropping. Thats conspiracy theories born.  Everyone listen up! /u/sjfiuauqadfj upgraded us 6 safe thank /u/sjfiuauqadfj mean like anti vaping conspiracy theorists something?

Because understand wanting children get hands flavored nicotine products. long things regulated safety (no contaminated cartridges imported sketchy online retailers) think it’s perfectly fine adults please. fact think it’s overall positive society means getting smokers switch cigarettes (which personally seen many smokers switch vaping).  Also blame variant crazy increases Brazil India know lot spread caused behavior. 100% blamed variants? seems large global misstep wasted opportunity millions vaccines missing current production. billions dollars \[public going investment create vaccine, seems like public say ROI well. looking many countries vaccinated 2024, risk long time variants form spread. Yep, communism totally lead 100 million people dying I'm sure profits shared employees putting long hours expertise hoarded execs board members.

/s there's local cases long time people think necessary Except I’m anxious. assumption anxious absurd me. annoyed people zero ability calculate risk/reward continue set tone. calculated many weeks delay decision use vaccine would cause order risk serious illness COVID time period match risk serious illness vaccine. calculation done age group based current situation expected vaccine deliveries.

In case AZ decision stop using easy due continued delivery problems making delay negligible. J&amp;J think choice clear-cut, increased deliveries Pfizer possibility extending time doses helps compensate delays. high-risk groups vaccinated infection rates going down.

98% people offered vaccine Oslo accepted far. Keeping confidence vaccines high also factor take account. Even fully vaccinated stay home! least another year never know. Plus love waiting get table. Getting great deals hotels flights. love empty beaches are.   don't. patients die home, they're counted amongst dead COVID show official numbers. Reasons I'm ready go ""back normal"":

I'm immunocompromised several risk factors. enough chronic conditions. I'm willing risk long covid.

""I wondered whether Dr. Fauci would get flight moment?"" Fottrell asked.

Here's Fauci responded:

""Well, answer 'No' following reason: risk category. don’t like admit it, I’m 79 years old. can’t think reason go trans-Atlantic. Right now, I’m sequestered. survey people Ireland UK came participated survey intend get Covid-19 vaccine; 11% said would not; 14% said unsure.   younger people significantly less likely report intention avail Covid-19 vaccine.  aged 30 significantly less likely say would accept Covid-19 vaccine, fewer 70% indicating positive response 20% indicating high levels uncertainty.

Considering 35% young US gotten shot, say groups care society wider world? straight forward. **These things go ANDA biologics equivalent needs prove bioequivalence.** may number things differing treatment. think vaccines got EUA wouldn’t also process lots released production bit mystery.

Yeah, NYC mostly open increased movement. much case last year. wonder reporter confused 15x virulence 15x lethality. Including B.1.617 observed incredibly short exposure spans enough.

Full approval almost certainly come year. would business risk legal threat legal threat near future. care data, they'll ignore plunge ahead narrative. I'm following Washington numbers, downstate New York (which full out-of-control surge last spring) pretty closely echoing last years pattern, almost week. Cases went close zero late spring summer came back September. clearly weather related cases fell warmed last year, rebounded got cool fall obviously lots behavioral changes going well. makes sense. Vaccinations prevent death causes. Depends define ""rejecting opportunities."" mean, could claim rejecting opportunity climb Mt.

Waiving IP magic trick immediately cure illness world. check out, reccomendations specific publications? would compliant got Moderna? comment made morning thought vaccine production slated 3.5 billion quite ago? Still troubling we're still looking almost 2024. things go well.. Given underlying data credibility issues, well specifically focused media (2020 early 2021 crowded western media) entirely possible covid much bigger problem went overfull radar. unlikely issue otherwise unknown power. thanks    Since 50% LA least 1 vaccine dose (providing decent protection) likely 20-30% already caught virus (more reported possible testing gaps) cases now, kinda think already herd immunity close it, locally.

No, thread title Pfizer, take US government funding. wanna argue government funding laid groundwork development mRNA vaccines, fine, though whole bunch went government giving dollars. way government spends money. 2029 Great Depression impossible. Nobody worried national debt anymore? agree you, dumb they've become politicized. know vaccinated people real life hesitant remove masks outdoors want mistaken deniers. wonder preemptively schedule son first dose next Friday 14th, even web page still checkbox ""This person 16 older"". I’m fully capable hating Apple, Amazon, Pfizer. don’t pick teams. deaths going unreported, might number ready biggest global players (e.g., Roche Novartis)

Pfizer's market cap 220B. Novartis 210B. Hoffman-La Roche 275B. Johnson Johnson's market cap 475B. Now, I'm really sure breakdown, I'd imagine good portion J&amp;J's revenue strictly pharmaceuticals.

But guess point sentence makes look like bit players went vaccines, that's true.

Sure, big guys stayed away it, maybe that's knew tech. Moderna vaccine worked (obviously tested everything) 2 months US even started COVID restrictions. Oxford's vaccine appeared well way thing hit big time.

And imagine Pfizer going making healthy profits foreseeable future. They've got contracts scale production long time anything resembling competition since we'll likely supply limited (on world stage) next 12-24 months. Yep. hungover past 3 days row. Party time.  Totally valid. pandemic *may* ending mean change are. Yep, friend's wife's sister got vaccine due job requiring it. think lot people similar situation. makes hard. 

Don’t want shot? job you. Actions (or lack thereof) consequences.  know someone vaccinated. People say It’s also India inundated Covid. It’s thing happens healthcare workers... antibodies fight much, getting massive doses virus, immune system overwhelmed. article goes discussion 20% profit margin Pfizer says they'll get vaccine.

20% HUGE profit margin. *Andrew WK likes this* don’t know similar issue got back office. It’s sixth day I’ve work since March last year, rest time I’ve working home. 3 people today, like ghost town. communte back horrendous, raining day. food lunch depressing.

Going things better home chumps. last year taught good I’ve got things home. regularly see Alex Berenson person verify even asshole you’d guess. Username checks out.

We’ll let be. fun staying locked up. Yeah, bit grey line. used false positives, bear danger either personal societal consequences. could call weak positives too. Either way, removed statistics since essentially count. keeping track herd immunity understanding could helpful. Jesus christ. I'm glad better employer require vaccinations non-vaccinated employees allowed travel people company vehicles, sent state projects, allowed work within 6' others, basically can't jobs effectively.

In words, vaccinated want stay employed. think overblown summer George. Church-going neighbors agree you. means mask less inside church, would take vaccine. Sure, Washington Oregon surging New York not. difference somewhere. We've warm April, even Seattle. Record low rain.

Hopefully see cities follow Chicago’s lead. article: “N440K mutation reported several viral sequences across India based results, predict higher infectious titers achieved strain could possibly lead higher rate transmission. “

My guess covid makes rounds rural areas every winter years, forcing hospitals larger cities. Masks social distancing go away period larger cities, come back whenever concerning strain rolls through. Think periodic ""mask distancing advisories"". Also, legitimate medical accommodation needed. Things turning shit Central Oregon currently.

Half people know refusing get vaccinated spite telling vaccines necessary end this. cases roof hospital maximum capacity. feels like I'm odd one leave door, received shots already.

There many goddamn tourists weather warmed restrictions states eased. Many schools outside Oregon semester schedule finish week meaning travelers state stop coming. want give everyone visiting benefit doubt hard believe every single person bars eating fully vaxed.

[22% new covid cases good proportion people opposite mentality use percentages means huge jump. use raw numbers usually big jump. use way stroke panic fear. best wait longer. know plenty people personally long term symptoms I'm sure tell man. 

It's fairly common anecdotal experiences something getting properly captured. Without paying full medical scans there's way tell extent damage. Could something minor could serious issue long term

Edit: literally one aspect looking Two-fold less there's ac India people meeting indoors.

Seattle New York similar climate much year. Seattle even people vaccinated. explanation reason NYC well there's natural immunity. documented. lot people back NYC second homes much surge. Seattle also gas kids back school 2 weeks, whereas New York person school year.

Seattle far fewer people per 100,000 get covid. would feel good NYC's plan lived there. That's normal Pharma. Even average. what? whole bunch industries technologies wouldn’t exist without government funding. doesn’t mean companies aren’t entitled profit. 

These vaccines wouldn’t exist without companies researchers, don’t understand argument. potential profit makes 10’ish vaccines worldwide possible year, otherwise it’d risky.  really well. don’t trust people smart tbh numbers dropping record low levels. issue people [went full tilt lockdown won’t get vaccinated left seem think overcaution way go, making people right question effectiveness vaccines,” Gandhi told me. Public figures policy makers try dictate others’ behavior without scientific justification erode trust public health make people less willing take useful precautions. marginal gains staying shut might justify potential backlash. MRNA HIV vaccine heard ? FWIW article poorly written  There's rational reason think would prevent that. They're different vehicles delivering largely antigen. seeing experts recently say chance reaching herd immunity

People put way much thought ""herd immunity"" sort talisman. not. greater percentage population immunity vaccination prior infection, slower disease spread less likely non-immune person encounter it. magic number suddenly disappear though. celebrating fact 56% adults US received least one shot vaccine, yes obviously pushing get vaccinated, lamenting ""we'll never reach herd immunity"" whatever even means. Get vaxxed get axed. super hot, AC India surging seasonality means drop?

Not OP, best guess combination of:

* Different variants better different climates (e.g., South African variant, barely got anywhere UK); and
* Supposed seasonality largely reflection people's behaviors (e.g., Covid surges people meet indoors, rather coldest such). NYT story may never reach herd immunity anti-vax holdouts sending anxiety spiral. fuck supposed society, keep waiting people trust scientific advances? funny people way get back normal avoid years Zoom, elbow bumps, masks, trust Crazy Aunt Hilda FB confirm priors hold rest us back. want wrong this, esp. herd immunity impossibility part. many public areas? Yes. restaurants, bars private gatherings either. Storytime! :-) Yep. Basically comes is: terminate almost reason, except limited number reasons would considered discriminatory, one them.

The exception could maybe see someone part established religion specifically allow get vaccine/inject anything etc. case, would turn issue workplace safety etc. 

Sort like US military, beards/turbans banned long time safety reasons. anyone military request waiver allow facial hair/headwear kind, that's it: get waiver, *allowed* wear those, *right* remain employed. dude passionate thread titles.  CDC guidance March indicated need quarantine COVID exposure vaccinated

Can someone tell Canada? Got 5% population city quarantine due exposures last days. People fully vaccinated required quarantine someone house *exposed* COVID, *has* COVID, contact someone does. insane. added relevant data. BTW much higher virulence meant even short exposure time carries high viral load. effect antibody efficacy. Maybe uneven distribution explains cases kept coming even overall infection percentages inferred death count quite high. Good hear this!

I hope least -some- under-12 group gets approved relatively quickly, also. son 11, turn 12 right around time I've seen lot folks guess it'll come available under-12 (end year/start next year) applies testing done early.

In countries overwhelmed, lot people tested go hospital, happens they're close death.

In India's case, deaths might lagging behind cases days. Everyone still wearing masks. used talking point anti-vaccine forces spreaders misinformation. assure full licensure absolutely nothing stop them. claim simply bribe FDA Pfizer, nonsense make seem full licensure real thing. good, honest people bound encumbrances reason.

What full licensure allow organizations mandate vaccine. Admittedly, it’s clear couldn’t already this, remove doubt.  Let's put way: Pfizer started company producing food additives. point, world's leader citric acid manufacturing, used mold precursor. became pharma manufacturer WWII, adapting mold breeding process penicillum mold, point supplied something like 90% penicillin worldwide. And, yes, made profit this.

 Since then, Pfizer instrumental bringing many new critical drugs market.

 Yet criticism brought Pfizer back then: simply profited nature's penicillin. describes sentiment really well. decided ""good enough"" instead actually ending pandemic. Reminds beginning get together try stop initial spread.  [CDC report age-specific dose number information CDC, data Texas represented figures. question almost impossible tease causes effects, look graph New York City cases impossible notice near zero cases summer, mountains cases last winter/early spring, year. respiratory viruses seasonal numbers show seasonality. goal prevent mountain cases showing next fall.  people keep denying severity problem grow serious

This seems sub now. see many people downvoting want get back ""normal."" I'm still wearing mask one thinks I'm anti-masker.

no offense, really dumb reasoning.

follow science. fully vaccinated want wear mask outside, CDC saying ok, wear one. gives fuck people think. lunatics judging way.

obviously long mask mandates still wear one indoors, everyone afraid judged shamed going back normal, forever stuck bullshit Covid lifestyle. mean category 5 hurricane gone? Novavax Curevac great new additions vaccine lineup. Curevac mRNA seems work well, Novavax peptide + adjuvant based technology also seems work well. Maybe get hesitant people get Novavax jab like idea traditional vaccine technology (similar flu vaccine)? Yeah quite wrong..Lol troops pulled Afghanistan year.  want stay home themselves, want force us to, makes unacceptable.


That's one hell generalization, boss None profits vaccines (and many drugs) would even possible without government research, don’t really understand argument. Pretty sure venn diagram people 'overly love America', 'anti-mask', 'vaccine hesitant' one circle. City fully opened rumor mask mandates stay place next year. I'm sure agree ""fully opened"" first Pfizer produced soreness arm went lymph nodes three days. second shot anything. dying horrible disease little motivation most. ironically, tied stimulus vaccine would lines door. Yes! want infant vaccinated ASAP! November, baby almost 1 year old. Seven months unprotected daycare makes anxious there's nothing else done besides daycare teachers getting vaccinated continuing current safety measures shit saying penalties honestly fucking insane lol. Imagine flu shot travel shit. news children’s timeline legit made day. three kids six cannot wait fully vaccinated. Israel rigourous testing CDC did. Lol too. 

So happy though. may right, say claim got vaccinated get COVID. employer could fire think lied vaccination. guess worse case scenario, get fired. has, right: people generally respond, even respond negatively celebrity campaigns.

But rather cite source, I'm going slip Chappelle here: yea lol, theres inflation almost every single year last 70 years ask yet? poorest state India, medically challenged even best times. Covid caused lot devestation. Also moderna anounced started working toward two weeks ago. way. People need fucking grow pair, god.

Why people fucking awful gauging risk? 

At literally point past 12 months, remotely scared COVID.. 99.5% chance shrugging I'm early 30's fit guy. 

0.01% less chance death. 

And assumes I'd actually catch it, given. We're already exporting vaccines, article says third shot likely required 6-12 months first, all. 

So concern really rooted reality. sorry, 0% chance happens. Likely. appear bit different:

""We observed weak association increased T-cell response vaccinated Moderna compared Pfizer. Though subjects needed confirm validity trend, difference could consequence higherdoseof mRNA Moderna vaccine compared Pfizer""

in annoying go watch fireworks -- traffic, crowded, really hot &amp; humid, kids staying late school night, etc., etc. really miss last year. absolutely terrible.  Fourth July lit. 🇺🇸💥💥💥 That’s.......kind genius IMO. disagree trying say, think statistic reliable. observe cause transmission vast majority infections (somewhat pedantically observe cause anyone make really good guesses cases). possible true number way higher. got sick unmasked person street coughed you, able tell outdoor transmission. either really confused arguing bad faith. never said wanted go around ask people vaccines personally. said pro enforcing people get vaccines societal good bring. we've done life school college requiring people get vaccines.

I'm pro vaccines requirement job, requirement anyone wants live interact society. getting vaccinated helps everyone, preventing creations new variants protecting might great immune system.

Beyond makes sense businesses require means workforce take less sick days shows employee level education least willing team player instead caring one around them.  want nothing fully vaccinated 4 weeks first Pfizer still dealing extreme restlessness insomnia... don’t know do! think lot companies benefited covid mom pop shops taking biggest blow. you’ve sort make effort go get it. take people - pop ups communities, businesses, sporting events, etc. - better coverage you’ll get neutrals. tell Moderna farther along 12 studies. company given definitive progress reports though, guess. However surprised Moderna gets younger group first. I'm hoping race actually - faster get young kids vaccinated better. $ex? Asking friend. Ignorance stopped good excuse least decade ago. We're internet age now. hard find real information virtually topic. someone really 'hesitant' 'full understanding', well they've *months* educate themselves. somehow managed find time? 


At point, 100% people claiming they're 'hesitant' anti-vaxxers hiding behind bullshit excuses save face. Excellent point!!! makes anyone feel better, hardly felt it. would possibly get caught? state local federal registry. They'd call place claim got vaccination place gives info without consent HIPPA violation. feel like showing face public much fundamental right driving vehicle intoxicated.  Cases beginning fall DoFo's province. paraphrase Wes Mantooth: ""Even guy can't think something!"" literally didn’t even feel mine ask guy stuck yet. think nuanced. evidence largely suggests outdoor transmissions rare mask wearing needed (both based evidence + accumulated knowledge past viral transmissions). However, Covid-19, public health guidance treat Covid-19 utmost caution due novel nature virus. CDC guidance based science still decided over-rotate safety aspects mask wearing enough accumulated evidence.

I'm willing bet decent amount money scientific commentaries around outdoor transmissions hedged lot ""it's unlikely."" Certainly commentaries based science strong theory based assumption airborne virus like Covid-19 behave similar airborne viruses decent amount accumulated knowledge in. Lol booster end necessary due variants original two doses wearing screwed. fully vaccinated people thread already saying get booster. already going reach herd immunity first two shots boosters end needed keep protection even less people protected near future. Community protection drop point Covid comes roaring back. first world problem have. wish needle fear thing held back getting vaccine - rather availability vaccines. think they're going die
.. care killing others Unless slam dunk case, plaintiff front money. Attorneys work contingency iffy claims. friend lives Noida say many dead people running wood burn bodies. 

Rich people fleeing country Europe Thailand places several cases police used take oxygen tank patients give VIP patients. 

It really hard listening Signal, holding tears back. really sad! Pfizer booster based SA variant months later!

ALL ANTIBODIES joke, seriously shit needs stoo Getting vaccine approval people 16 probably help, too. lot unvaccinated places kids. it’s flu season there’s outbreak going cancer otherwise immunocompromised baby it’s really common  completely ignored entirety conversation lol

""But so-called extreme weather attribution studies clearly repeatedly found climate change exacerbates heat waves, help create conditions wildfires burn intensely spread rapidly.""

from Cannot come soon enough! Finally feling good in-person school fall 1st grader! ethical lawyer would take money people trying sue business meeting CDC guidelines order try force employees get EUA vaccine legally questionable manner. legal threat go 'both ways'. Looks like 12-15 year olds, Pfizer requested emergency authorization April 9th could granted late week next week. So...a month-ish? sure lag longer younger kids one adolescents interesting recent benchmark. /r/selfawarewolves Vaccine free. want, even tell person giving vaccine currently insurance. note down, bill state. attractive bridesmaids? big hurrah reached 3m covid vaccinations day.

Well 3m day year, every year, flu vaccines.

So got process place mass-vaccinations year. need adapt covid vaccines, seems do-able.

So personally, much doubt getting booster hard getting first shots. insignificant number people feel like vaccine EUA tested enough, waiting fully approved get it. approval removes one barrier hesitancy.

Full approval anything 'hesitancy'. Precisely *zero* people claim ""it's emergency authorization, bro"" absolutely *any* idea difference EUA full authorization. propaganda talking point got anti-vax FB support group. know means, care. instant vaccines receive full approval, dumb happy asses jump right next bullshit excuse take it. would need percentage vaccinated israel see cases falling? I'm sure common was, Hep B lives surfaces much month cases. common AIDS, lot transmissible. press conference yesterday, Public Health said partially due reporting lag. time, look number deaths episode date rather they're reported, county averaging maybe 4 day. Lamont

I'm assuming fall fairly quickly - MA/Boston seem outliers days. LET GAMES BEGIN Problem developing world lack money royalty. lack resources corruption.

In addition memory, amygdala also triggers ***secretion of*** ***that affect*** ***and*** fear aggression response initiated, amygdala releases hormones body put human body ""alert"" state, prepares individual move, run, fight, defensive ""alert"" state response known [fight-or-flight I'm quite mandate skeptical, biggest gripe simply governors unilaterally imposed restrictions without balls say ""when hit X, we'll lift mask mandate"". seemed like great chance kicked road indefinitely. I'm elated Governors coming publicly making statements. makes much difficult later change minds without incurring significant backlash. hoping Cuomo makes similar announcement coordination Gov. Murphy NJ Governor CT (can't remember name). 70% vaccinated masks. Question potential 3rd Pfizer dose. got vaccinated J&amp;J month ago. know currently studies done UK vaccine mixing plan results June see safe effective is. wondering potential 3rd doses Pfizer (and maybe Moderna) mean got J&amp;J jabs. Would J&amp;J own? people got J&amp;J even need get 3rd booster? 

I know efficacy numbers fairly close Pfizer/Moderna J&amp;J (after month). I’d love maximize protection even still continue stay work home, also option visiting family haven’t seen 1 1/2 years. ambitious goal he's announcing like confidence plan place.

Now time incentivize vaccinate, got vaccine offer $100 I'm going salty. takes vaccinate I'm open it, lets get 70%! could always encourage people get vaccinated Friday. way weekend recover need it. 56% adults gotten far.

That means need ~32% people haven’t gotten yet get next 2 months order meet goal.

That’s ~36M adults next 61 days, **~592,000 first doses among adults per day.**

Our 7 day average currently ~950,000 first doses day, steadily declining. 

Assuming rate continue decline, it’s going close, think it’s achievable provide incentives vaccinated. CT signed law (last week) repeal religious exceptions required vaccines starting 2022. Children allowed attend public school unless vaccinated per CT requirements medically exempt. child currently school w/a religious exemption grandfathered graduate. CT 6th state religious exemption. lawsuit filed day signed law; ""The plaintiffs alleged state violated First Amendment right free exercise religion rights guaranteed Fourth, Fifth Fourteenth Amendments. also claimed unlawful discrimination violation Individuals Disabilities Education Act."" That's extremely common symptom hundred different problems, doubt anything vaccine unless first dude new niche side effect hundreds millions people taken vaccine. People ""irrational"" fear treated irrational, confined accept vaccination. ""Irrational"" people allowed endanger sane.. dead yet! Lol, places need work vaccinations, people never wore masks first place True take get pandemic guess  long residents stay there.... course virus isn’t FDA approved won’t know full extent COVID damage time passes either. people reasons. 

Still suppose positive hopeful right course maybe something simple like paying folks get jabbed enough.  Yeah forgot 56%! adults first shot, actually could well possible, need massive advertising campaign.  already roaring 90s dot com crash ca. 2000-2001, housing market crash 2008. Yeah. got really close edge disaster US cities, started lot resources poorer Indian states. India’s gone ledge hard. going run arms. need incentivize people getting vaccine fence. That's me. really want get vaccinated. tons open appointments J&amp;J near (so need one dose). would described severe fear needles. I've pulled page make appointment dozens times can't it. start panicking thinking it. That's exactly thinking, that's big goal imagine solid plan they're announcing like this.

This genuinely makes little hopeful future. even there's source, think worry comes market.  Maybe never happen. probably till get children eligible. able vaccinate 16 right making reaching herd immunity much difficult. children become eligible likely reach it. Maybe add crowdfunding goals policy: *Reach 70% legalise weed.* Yes, 50/50 gross profit share (excluding China, works Fosun). Yes still label ice cream trucks. they're handed ice cream, someone sneaks around back truck, surprise jabs them(J&amp;J necessary since back), hands cdc card. dont remember age probably woud want forget. worry alright. Ya, evidence third shot much weaker original studies. Depending things go long immunity lasts (we really don’t know all), might given people weaker immune systems (old cancer etc) high risk (health care). 

But let’s honest here, everyone making go along. I’m pretty sure vaccinated personally know multiple people “pro-vax” haven’t taken steps needed get theirs. don’t get personally. [Hey that's actually pretty Yeah know. Vegas put betting odds whether goal going hit think people would put money side. Many international flights already require vaccines diseases youre already required vaccinated several diseases going public schools. Lol. Chinese extreme contact tracing Wuhan. 7000 cases traced, linked one outdoor transmission. literally gone brother. Explaining process IRB submission, Serious Adverse Event reporting, data analysis... everything. response 'oh.. get advanced degree mRNA science? know scientist.' maddening. spent hours explaining trust system. know safeguards there, deal daily, done 2 decades. sat there, waiting try 'gotcha!' actual scientist studied mRNA. (spoiler: he's eithe

The people waiting FDA approval going move goal posts. politically correct way refusing. full licensure allow organizations mandate vaccine. 

California already mandated college classes fall. military whatever wants I'm sure hospital chains mandate whatever want. mean, also think that's reasonable thought, US done vaccines past specific areas. gotta get Yellow Fever vaccine going Ghana Kenya example. Great goal vaccine ""hesitant"" indoctrinated ""alternative facts"".

Can't see one getting accomplished many people refuse part society. dying disease motivator people already dying disease. Also bunch still convinced hoax numbers faked. Yup need check tied getting second dose pfizer/moderna single dose j&amp;j. Tell people get $500 get vaccinated, actually it. someone fell ""vaccine hesitant"" camp first started, made appointment shot #1 Saturday know 2 people boat made appointments.

People coming around!  Pfizer make money.

I'm really behind homebrew COVID vaccine I'm glad go get one free. weird lazy would unhappy caught covid could vaccinated. still going get vaccine travel anyway.

If going get vaccine either way, I'd want ASAP. Transmission outdoors extremely low according data. don’t fully vaccinated wear mask outside. We’ve known awhile. “guidelines” incredibly slow update.  vaccine disease? Thanks sharing this.  I’m going send friend hasn’t gotten reason.  She’s hoping get J&amp;J one hates needles much. like 1800 deaths per million. Yeah congrats bad Brazil. 

Canada 650 deaths per million.

It's always funny countries Americans choose compare complaining they're ""not bad circlejerk claims"". Reminds ""don't realize Venezuela worse? We're even Honduras levels murder, like Somalia. SMH damn uninformed circlejerkers""

Your 2020 covid response, many aspects country, absolutely shameful given wealth hoarded powerful America. things never get better long worried ""dem smug foriners"" fellow countrymen. Mind route United States wanted go, blowing off. \**un*fair enough CDC came back 90% pretty close Israel saw. Please send vaccine Cuba. think lot people get flu shots regularly, every year, maybe percent think help gotten higher? would help.

I also think one roadblock lot people covid see need. think saying need one shot instead 2 vaccine antibodies would also help drive vax rate.

Vax immunity better, according studies, one vaccine recovering covid sends antibodies sky high. common thing think. everyone anti-vaxxer nutjob. folks bit hesitant reading things like ""the second shot knocked ass"" etc etc probably eventually come around. trying make flu? Literally nobody's talking that. mean emotionally invested bunch celebrities poorly singing Imagine beginning Pandemic?  don’t like needles... probably don’t want experience intubated. That's lot. Fully vaccinated? 2 weeks second dose 2 weeks J J? CT already 70% CHILDS PLAY. said I'd beyond stoked rest country got well nah 60% easy, 56.3% adults 1 dose country right now. 70% gonna tough impossible. 2 states already hit 70% (new hampshire &amp; massachusetts) 7 states within stones throw away

the problem getting deep south, hovering 40% 50% make significant improvements logical reason one couldn’t get Pfizer booster one got shots. 

If Pfizer, would included patients got non Pfizer vaccine booster trials. way sell people...

Remember can’t essentially done clinical trials. done clinical trials decided bunch people room, sometimes limited information.  Manipulate fear fear manipulate. Good job sub line thinking well. I'm 28, good health, worried Covid. vaccine much variable Covid is. BUT, people get vaccinated, can't go back going maskless, it. human organism exposed RNA viruses like corona viruses DNA viruses like adenoviruses long time. That's assumption long-term effects. However, adenovirus vector vaccines engineered carry DNA corona spike protein cell core while, part corona virus, RNA normally replicates cell cytoplasm.

With regards blood clots, admitted occur even 4 weeks vaccination. One theory seems remnants DNA somehow cause problem.

All attempts find met aggressive denial without explanation. Oh way, don’t bother looking Pfizer’s issues sterile injectable plants FDA. Especially rocky mount one. Nope. company many fda issues could never manufacture vaccine. mention, products South Africa numerous places, imported US, wouldn’t FDA auditing sites. Nope, let’s never mind continually show don’t know you’re talking about. mean, one stopping want wear mask outside. still you’d like. Moderna allowed company, question useful. ability produce Pfizer ability produce Moderna. reason nobody else setting factories think worth investment.

Though admit Pfizer Moderna expertise valuable consult with. (I know bioNtech's expertise mass production, partners must got someplace them)  Budweiser sending free beers fully vaccinated. 120 x 24 = 2,880. dying even according official numbers (and official numbers accurate either) Experiment performed failed 1922-1991 hell wears mask outside lmao Even made mandatory, hit 70% adults. brother got DYING TWELFTH MAN JERSEY would probably break get vaccinated. in-laws insert VIKINGS GEAR. Like I've saying lot lately

Darwinism work. Yeah I've saying weeks everytime new booster required, see less less uptake. lead less overall protection community. lead covid able storm back. reason might even need boosters many rejecting vaccine right now. vaccines actually issue? I've watched people get 4-5 shots back back military entry level training... good remember without allowing kids 16 get vaccine, never reach herd immunity. realize apply stated goal here, 70% total population can't happen without kids. set within hours Vaccine.. I’ve gone drinking 3 cups coffee able tolerate any. I’ve docs explanation. Seems handful people reporting restlessness/ insomnia temporary side effect whatever reason mine lingering ok yes, correct technically. meant one guy vaccinated, one step closer herd immunity internet fountain wonderful knowledge many lack ability dicern good information bad.

You could tell someone look something, mean sources good! Lol. You’re discussion. You’re ignoring reality based personal theoretical suppositions. people r next name working tirelessly get likeminded community vaccinated, outreach efforts seem keep falling short Keep mind numbers *way* off, account natural untested infections all. Additionally, reported cases deaths strongly correlated otherwise might be, due fact hospitalizations reported cases fact person sick enough hospitalized, person likely add death toll individual sick enough warrant hospitalization.

The [CDC currently estimates ratio unreported cases reported 4.3:1, already makes death rate reported 4x high, even without considering statistical skews like one mentioned.

I personally know people vaccinated yet much pain trying get scheduled floodgates first opened are/were waiting till could go Walmart walk-in pharmacy get it. 20 years experience managing clinical trials. cannot tell much care process behind medical therapy approvals. go hours 'rushed' safe anything else there, want hear it.

I’ve lost mother already (non Covid 2 years ago) sure hell won’t lose another parent. fully vax me, dad, everyone around us. already done weeks ago....why??????? that's ambitious, hope able would count people get vaccinated reach collective goal. Vaccine passports mandatory vaccination school/work/entertainment/travel sadly way convince many people. Key word ""adults"". That's much possible goal Yea, makes sense impression everyone going get vaccinated. true though.

Are forecasting 70% adults planning getting vaccinated? Seems like that's high.  Thank clarifying comments. First world problems real problems, changing perspective pointing plight developing country always help people feel better- less 13+ months this.

I'm Ontario, worth. Shouldn’t they? 50% vehicle sales SUVs now, hundreds thousands cheaply built mcmansions built bought former forests farms every year mcdonalds every corner. Think might tad bit higher 10%.  *Lol* need ""ping pong"" people there's large pool susceptible, unvaccinated people population, still case.

We know long immunity acquired infection lasts, know acquiring means risking health around increasing chance vaccine-resistant strain emerges screws us over.

Letting virus ""burn out"" kill thousands people risk rendering vaccine useless. There's reason doctors, public health experts scientists urging everyone get vaccinated. keep focusing C-Tap, seem forget isn’t even IP waiver scheme - it’s intended voluntary information sharing effort, forced one, IP waiver wouldn’t include manufacturing know needed actually use patents. article:

I expect every guidance CDC vaccinated people only, mind unvaccinated people (besides medical exemption) want encourage uptake. Though expectation likely followed vaccinated unvaccinated Roger San Francisco. thought too. literally none things That's protected reason though. Bad PR maybe irony 3rd shot may take what, 95% 97% efficacy? end? Would 4th shot make 99%? semblance problem spread deaths among vaccinated folks (see Israel data), seems like Pfizer cash-grab. 

These mRNA vaccines much better anything we've ever before, little silly draw line sand 2 3 shots say everything side inconsiderate others. 

If prove vaccine efficacy drops significantly X months, maybe warranted. right now, nothing Pfizer Pfizer  Fine, probably rounds 100%. honestly age group virtually 100%. 

Where live, recently announced date one single person died COVID 2-weeks post-2nd-dose. woman LTC 100 years old. Question. resource countries acknowledging vaccines?

For example, even know US recognize Astra Zeneca vaccinated individuals? know administered US, like - we're sending India, we're sending Canada. anyone know it’s approved get it? it’s approved long one get it?  teenager deadline vaccinated fall — camp summer — remember vaccines spaced, mean seven- eight-week window around Covid vaccines shots can’t Lee Beers, professor pediatrics Children’s National Hospital president American Academy Pediatrics, said, “We’re really trying push message, get see pediatrician get caught routine vaccines you’re going end really tricky place delay Covid vaccine vaccines.” know safely next someone without mask.

By vaccinated. percentage adults *can't* get vaccinated whatever reason small. autoimmune disorder, probably wearing mask forever anyway. Everyone else's interpretation data wrong -- kind validation US. ""death/case"" ratio always good (Trump tried bragging one point). That's likely US testing really high. catching asymptomatic cases, going drag death/case rate (and lift # cases up, obviously).

Someone correct I'm wrong, need flu shot every year quickly flu virus mutates flu strain that's prevalent year may completely different last year's.

Given SARS-CoV-2 seems mutating slowly, vaccines effective known strains far, think yearly COVID shots would needed. Whoot! I'm cheering you. Good luck finals job. kiddo turns 12 end July. Can't freaking wait this. wife got 1st shot today.  getting second around first june. Yes, number first shots cratering people unwilling unable acces injection site. 1.3 billion people would take 1,200 years kill everyone. ever want hit herd immunity needs start req vaccine passports attend big events, fly etc who? working home.

I'm going find source though. harder find one better. seem assuming everything 100% effective 100% people vaccinated borders magic. Probably rate vaccination plummeted. need serious outreach, bet 75% Americans J&amp;J pause 70% (getting vaccinated eventually). think betting 70% *adults* unrealistic, think manage... good them. Biden likes under-promise over-deliver maybe possible. keep pestering friend get it. It’s 5 weeks since state opened eligibility everyone. don’t understand apathy. People put random numbers without thinking. 25x deaths sounds absurd.

As pointed out, 85k deaths day, cases would 8.5 Million day. Considering world wide mortality less 1%.

I've following protocols past year, frustrating things used simple become pain. someone stick them. insignificant number people feel like vaccine EUA tested enough, waiting fully approved get it. approval removes one barrier hesitancy.

Several hundred million received vaccine negative effects. that's good enough them, think full approval is. They'll come excuse get it. know get exposed vaccinated possibly acts like booster? far, way employer done it, it’s “If whole department vaccinated, take masks.” one holdout work site. He’s feeling peer pressure. 1K stimmy check everyone gets don’t recall Pfizer ever issues bad *a license entire facility suspended*; refresh memory details incident?

Manufacturing isn’t easy, that’s precisely point: even government backed facility like Emergent can’t get right direct assistance manufacturer, exactly tiny company expertise field going successfully reverse engineer produce vaccine scale without support vaccine developer? IP waiver alone entirely insufficient: need significant institutional knowledge properly, manufacturing process complex part whole effort. There’s reason Emergent facility turned J+J.

I don’t believe second Biolyse capable safely reverse engineering producing COVID-19 vaccine way claim - certainly next 6-9 months.

To second point, think it’s important vaccines used world produced facilities comply GMP, wouldn’t agree? developing world deserves vaccines made high standards everywhere else, think it’s offensive suggest otherwise.

You’ll able explicitly say what’s going on.   slowing India's case rate suspect well, considering country running testing materials. ""You must file vaccine exemption BMV"" actually kind genius idea. Vaccinated people still get it, mRNA vaccine prevent symptomatic illness 95% time, larger number seem able get infected asymptomatically. clear many be, good they'd spreading it, going vary vaccine possibly strain, issue good grip yet. epidemiological perspective, big deal, long R0 1, winning. individual level, might still matter. Like, fully vaccinated, around people covid, going go visit great grandpa nursing home, wear mask anyway. **which stored fridges 2 8 degree celsius 6 months**  can’t serious Hit quota dude!!!

Dying big issue. long-term effects could concern, sure. main reason get shot good citizen help protect vulnerable among us. people cannot get (medical age) rely others careful? still think basic precautions like masks general hygiene important protect groups, mention keeping illnesses like cold flu passed much.

The biggest problem assumption, imo, refusing vaccine affected still. Beyond cannot get whose bodies respond properly, affects dealing sick people, on. That's worry rushing me, we've seen things get overloaded elsewhere rushing. We’re 56% according CDC. county use 16+ cutoff we’re 70% already terms supply logistics don’t think that’s main challenge. Rates slowed rest goal seems outreach encourage people get vaccinated. would highly unethical US tiers vaccines. Obviously AZ would accepted. said, cruising, see used national/international scale US? read WH vaccine passports heard push start using them. People understand this, they're arrogant like told do. First, antimaskers deniers. care outright partied start. Now, think vaccine end-all cure-all, gallivant heart's content can't take another aching day inside house wearing simple little mask.

The social butterflies suffering, using vaccine catalyst whatever want now. realizing even close herd immunity (or ever be, according experts), tons cases breakthrough infections despite fully vaccinated (and exposed people, chances getting time). Vaccinated people also pass virus. Variants keep piling already chipping away vaccine efficiency. Eventually one punch vaccines like exist, people wanted 'party hard'. still many unknowns Covid, yet people hang every word CDC, Fauci officials. Guess what, still 100% sure either. they're willing follow 'experts' right cliff without hesitation.

Our way life changed drastically, weak-minded people can't cope loss precious little social lives. basically wartime right now, except enemy microscopic. ancestors handled way worse previous two world wars. really cared 'doing right thing', they'd continue ride follow mask social distancing protocols vaccination, scientists get even better grasp variants, booster shots, forth. $n0wf1@k3$ need amenities now!! Covid it, world really needs extinction level event occur point, majority human race can't even adhere self-preservation.

PS - F AutoModerator - please catch digital Covid, thanks fully vaxxed I’d agree you, it’s first shot that’s goal, think done. Probably USA first bc FDA USA degrees outside. Hiking? Obviously mask. Standing line outside shop? Mask. Walking downtown area moderate amount people sidewalk? Eh, depends crowded really is. Probably mask, cause probably within feet people times block. Hanging park playground watching kid? Probably mask, depends crowd maybe.

Anyway, there's gray area, ""outside"" lot different things.

Sounds like making clear closely shared outdoor spaces longer require masks. Nope. way happen. think end 60% pretty much. People either deny it, lazy/scared it. look everyone right now. lines anywhere state get shot. fuckin empty parking lot. People expect everyone else work back normal.

Are going judge people waiting full FDA approval take 3rd/4th shot? 

Are going wait CDC recommendation take additional shots? determines ""science""? would bet people would say CDC, FDA, and/or medical associations like AMA. me, I'd want see AMA/equivalent add kind ""regular immunization"" schedule.

My main point we're getting way ahead even talking vigor. currently still hypothetical.

Now 20% saying get another 10% saying likely.

With alone, could hit around 70%. hopefully time, incentives, etc., improve even   forget Pfizer said 12-15 year olds might able get first doses soon nice demand boost. everyone team covid back March last year (our boss came work running fever) gyms, salons, offices, “amusement family entertainment businesses,” meanwhile also allowed hit 100 percent capacity.

Just *don't* record insane stunts. us incredible dumb stuff teens fortunate enough none us cameras (or poor cameras). Also announced today, mask mandate lifted 70% adults fully vaccinated. Cases summer levels yet, deaths low they’ve since began thing last March. 

I’ve rather surprised long it’s taken get cases down, considering much state getting vaxxed. guess cases/deaths always lag vax numbers couple weeks problem is: everybody far vaccinated company working home since March last year. Whether covid long really matter them. care whether log work not. can't, take time off. That's fine. can, work even running fever yesterday. might feel functional today.  Live Brazil, confirm.

Good thing safe effective vaccines currently available everyone age 16 (soon 12) places US hit point within month so.


Instead telling people open eyes, *you* open *your* eyes see one fooled panicked articles like this, give rest. death toll 25 times official number. news, water wet  Yesterday, spoke person turned Covid positive 5 minutes chamber. 

We distance 6-8 feet us, double masked (he wearing cloth/surgical masks) sitting next open windows. 

I take quite precautions work, guys think could contracted virus?

I'm pretty anxious live India we're basically giant Coronavirus playground right now. scroll [NYC coronavirus look map total cases per capita, clarify I’m trying explain. places lowest cases also among highest vaccinations. see almost Manhattan yellow, lowest cases. Fuck Find club that's playing house music (or techno, ""older"" laid back type electronica), show yourself, bit drink, bob head around hours.

Wow, went NJ schools K-12, flu shot never requirement. again, mid-20's now. become requirement? company exclusively working home (with handful exceptions) since March last year that's issue. give lotto tickets vaccine. bring idiots bad math science. I'm sure case much US, discouraging see slowing vaccine administrations- given big drops (and mean graph shows straight since mid-april hit wall) cases NYC surprised hit 65%-70% immunity threshold, hence ""hitting wall"" effect. almost 60% city gotten least one shot figure probably least close 50% realistically immunity vaccine- plus fact probably 30+% natural infection since got hit hard (obviously much vaccinated infected population overlaps) ...it still nonetheless seem hard see would close sort immunity threshold.

Again herd immunity hard defined term obviously mean cease infections see city goes back another surge. Great news. 

Once everybody US wants shot easily, without major effort, get one, sit serious conversation moving this. agree seems good true lot employers (like mine) want 10 day quarantine positive test.  you’re referring LA Times article, explicitly says *aren’t* factories available - goal asking IP waivers force technology transfer build new factories scratch, cutting IP rights mRNA technology *for future pandemics*. explicitly acknowledge help current pandemic response, highlight COVAX best chance that.

I’m seeing mRNA capable manufacturers ready able start production haven’t already included effort licensing deals.

The people forced IP licensing agreement good would pharmaceutical companies want expedite mRNA efforts without making upfront investment. regulatory affairs employee one companies, might see opportunity suddenly spend bunch time Reddit advocating company get free R&amp;D others’ expense. make mistake, that’s commercial competitive goal - it’s way expedite COVID-19 vaccine production short term. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

That’s big difference young people drastically less impacted death wise. Probably still better cautious. 

Also probably US one federal government competing leaders, 50 state governments competing leaders, thousands local governments competing leaders.

The time saw message six-ish months 9/11, plenty even think pandemic real. one reasons death toll high. make healthcare prohibitively expensive people bad insurance avoid seeking medical care, people working retail service deaths normal easiest 'blind' data show COVID large impacts US. 

Hundreds thousands people died last year statistically without COVID factor. effectively wipes ""oh causes got marked covid"" argument, so, many normal possibly explain away. high-concentration areas high vaccination rates seeing happen.

Fairfax County, Virginia first-dose vaccination rate 48%. Seroprevalence somewhere 14 21 percent. So, individuals level protection around 58 percent (if got COVID equally likely get vaccine don't.)

Transmission rate around 7 per 100,000 per day positivity rate 3%. two days, 50 cases day county averaging fewer 1 death per day.

California's seroprevalence really similar. wonder seeing something closer 60% total immunity enough life continue whether seeing impact warmer weather. live Koreatown everyone wears them.

Antibody tests specific Covid point couldn’t say got infection recently. Yes - that’s met Dr. Art VanDelay
Who famously pulled giant Covid variant beached whale thus saving whale. spike test? That's one matters youth pastor used comment boys special friendship Currently, received 1st dose one vaccine, allowed get 2nd dose different kind vaccine may work intended. least medical personnel able give legal means.

If got 1st dose one type vaccine need get 2nd dose different kind, actually asked start vaccine regimen new kind vaccine. 

For example, received 1st dose Pfizer want receive 2nd dose Moderna, may asked receive 1st 2nd doses Moderna 2nd dose.

There's currently enough data confirm get booster effectively vaccine originally inoculated with.

To answer question, instead getting booster version Pfizer, would better getting 1st dose Pfizer, instead.  case rate falling they’ll keep falling situation changes. Sincere curiosity? people know whether maskless person vaccinated person one anti-masker? 

Is like floating light top head we've vaccinated CA? Cuz seen one started wonder whether got scammed version Pfizer? /s case. Yea first shot like shot 1.5 already understanding  Yeah don’t really mean full anti vaxxers, mean people fence don’t full understanding facts. 3rd shot going help already skeptical stupid unenforceable policy. start crap like might well say everyone fully vaccinated people died therefore 100% protection. reason became frightening simple. enough vaccines everything else immaterial point difference Pfizer make money. US taxpayers paying doses knows governments could pay Pfizer vaccine.  could probably reopen 2 3 weeks fine push came shove Keep mind virus rate growth exponential. Either R0 1 cases grow exponentially it’s 1 falls exponentially. it’s also situational. R0 restrictions different without bunch people vaccinated different without. 

My point R0 1 part last Summer doesn’t mean there’s seasonality. R0 could’ve 1.2, R0 exact situation Winter time could 1.6. You’ll see rising cases situations though would rise faster Winter. 

But let’s say vaccinate bunch folks reduce R0 0.4 situations. R0 0.8 Summer 1.2 Winter. Cases fall Summer long increase Winter. happens flu. 

Make sense? I'm 13. can't wait see friends again. Fucking finally. entire US lol frankly happen July 4th let's say mid June There's FAQ linked top thread. mean vaccination important reality 3-4 weeks done done it’s time move seems getting lost people.

My guess politicized became case still don’t see continuing restrictions makes sense everyone wants protection it, people essentially opted out. Outdoor masks useless unless crowd.   That's understandable think chances actually cancel quite small also question. Gonna comment follow Summer George!! seems premature Germany seems frankly like wrong decision. Please elaborate Correct. important thing getting good vaccine people use rolled flu shots. get two vaccinations within 14 days other, unless tested vaccines other. covid vaccine, nowhere near enough time test safe give another vaccine without lowering efficacy, highly doubt would advertise getting once. anything, advertise covid vaccine significantly flu, giving increased transmission rates covid. currently highly effective stopping dying covid. directly stop catching covid. indirectly reduce risk catching covid. increase bodies ability respond exposed. mean never show symptoms, highly likely exposed early strain won't. Think bell chart everything symptoms flu like symptoms hospital admission ICU admission death along X axis. vaccine drags peak curve heavily left significant mutations drag back right bit bit. vaccine much shield body thors hammer immune system difference important, least end 30 40% unvaccinated. initial numbers show vaccine great reducing spread obviously affects vaccinated people 1 significant variant population. studies show significant reduction efficacy vaccine certain variants depending criteria, i.e. still stop dying likely end ICU. 

If manage get herd immunity across entire world eradicated rate mutation slow vaccines remain highly effective. moderate vaccination rate developed countries poor vaccination rate less developed countries remain significant issue us highly likely mutation occur prompts another wave due rendering vaccine useless. 

The CDC says keep wearing masks confined puic spaces relaxed controlled situations (if vaccinated) seems like reasonable course action me. Wait, variants? one lol They’re excluding USM employees USM required vaccination. work USM met anyone problem it, want vaccines. However work left-leaning school may norm. Oh yeah, I've way enough know Pennsyltucky. nothing free. shows later forms taxs guess zero understanding vaccinations work, might come conclusion. However, even basic levels understanding subject, see no, statement make sense. Please read responses educate yourself. Right, also, currently, NBA sends test gets ticket *and* gets results back testing company. like bring photoshopped image piece paper. Yep..exactly. Give people reason get vaccine. People definitely disagree “vaccine passport” thing it’ll damn effective getting people vaccinated.  said “long overdue”. state opened vaccines 16 2 half weeks ago. 

I think illustrating one big takeaways struggled past year controlling covid. “My situation matters. I’m exception” philosophy. words say  Can't wait replace anxiety virus dread daily commute!  still extra. every 12-15 get shot. Demand adults already places availability demand. Let eof usnthwt want kids vaccinated get vaccinated. Doubt put dent available countries. There's forcing involved - freedom seek employment elsewhere, right nothingburger directions. Employers generally laugh wrongful termination lawsuits states. need incentivize like crazy also literally take vaccines places people can’t reach it. Presumably they’ll revisit realize 70% fully vaccinated might high end multiple reasons important one actually identifying deniers. know safely next someone without mask. check cards? guy danger you. Etc.  Friend, cannot draw limits ""has enough science"" this. Pfizer determines need 3rd shot, cannot turn we've enough. need right thing protect get shots. You’ve read incorrectly article. CTAP worked last year, pandemic, vaccines could currently produced increased capacities are. 

You’re also incorrect article referencing manufacturers able produce vaccines. know plenty facilities able produce vaccines. manufacturers Pfizer moderna partnered plenty them. slow cumbersome $$$ deals. IP issue saying simply thing without lengthy bottleneck process contract negotiations. You’ve incorrect nearly every step way ever supposition stand unfounded disproven. Why? Can't wait til I'm vaccinated go wherever hell want, whenever want. make choice staying home time much enjoyable. needed outdoors 6ft away someone anyway... Giving vaccine younger people allows reach herd immunity much faster. Israel see large herd effects vaccinations vaccinated 50 year olds. experience clinical supply chain deal drug point completed manufacture distribution clinical sites know process manufacturing long tedious. Getting facilities approved (sop’s etc..) takes long time good day, imagine current times it’s much challenging. That’s guess least. saying that’s reason, even reason people like you. people different. people look cdc guidance right thing regardless enforced (me). plan guidance expected 100% effective. Wow that's good reason! OP sister teacher LAUSD. everyone heading back school now. time Summer! hahah still decent demand J&amp;J US. article it. seems mostly people scared needles. prefer 1 done. also misconception Vector vaccines “traditional” vaccines even though certainly not. people know opted J&amp;J idea vaccine also sent mRNA instructions cells order produce spike proteins like mRNA ones. 

So think demand remain. Especially less risk rare side effect.  hear that. many kids tell got tired home fighting parents everything day! side people like sister want send kids back LAUSD weird schedules going have. They're hours. Homiesexual friend planning roadtrip Canada U.S July, hopefully borders opened information vaccine 16 newborn? guess - it’ll recommended specific time interval (6 months) first two shots spread lead bottlenecks California? might different MN parents older kids still consistently wearing masks go playgrounds thought definitely crossed mind. Nothing wrong cynic.

I think we'll wait see literature says. agree /u/columbo222 here. death rate 1/100th rate before, makes 1/10th deadly flu. point, things worry dying Covid. Inland Empire LA charter schools I've worked bunch kids still virtual bunch encouraged return. Obviously bit cautious mind Los Angeles we've got 20 kids campus. probably might change next weeks. vaccine percentage certain percent still lead outbreaks loved ones vaccinated getting covid. That’s say I’m gonna go still concerned low vaccine numbers. also care safety unvaccinated people. know belief fuck em would like high enough percent protect people well. nothing else make sure hospitals aren’t overwhelmed come winter. Super duper improbable I’m tired lockdowns sure, already two vaccine shots, else want me? Let sushi Friday night without test lucky stars find table damn it. easy think. Results need entered healthcare employee hub. certain extent already polio. United States uses injected dead polio vaccine, oral polio vaccine, rarely cause polio outbreaks, still used parts world ease administration ability passively immunize people close contact  Everyone lol guess thats reality home workers never deal with, fair point, really sucks. trying say people worked service/retail throught this, 2 week minimum thing initially responding much reality alot business employees. also restaurants retailers still made people work symptoms too, go ways think also.  effect vaccinated, outdoors? actually testing now?  mix shots exceptional circumstances. friend mine pretty bad side effects Moderna shot going get Pfizer second dose. issues aren’t common. QA always issue. Don’t forget vaccines complex products market decades use live cell manufacturing utter nightmare therms regulatory manufacturing. Poopoohing difficulties impossibilities best way go. May be, UK underreporting much.

Some sources say least 30 times infections deaths reported. Covid last week January runny nose couple hours. That’s bad got me. got first Moderna vaccine two weeks ago mild fever, chills, headache 36 hours. symptoms started roughly 12 hours got shot. arm pain lasted 2 days. Needless say vaccine way worse Covid was. get second shot May 20th. Good goal. I'll start practicing. Remember fully vaccinated numbers point highly skewed favor elderly people, data still pretty impressive me. I'm wearing laminated vax card around neck like press credentials! /s Thanks word masks though? normal still wear masks. think wealthy neighborhoods like Fairfax County Westside Los Angeles covid never really huge problem throughout pandemic, compared poor minority ghettos. think going forward question extent control outbreaks dense zip codes populated shift workers can't work home? may end hovering 60 70% level nation-wide end year, anti-vax sentiment. Irregardless, re-boot economy activities daily living. distribute like Sinovac instead? 
Down evil capitalism amiright? I'm confused.. prior covid, willingly go around asking people vaccines birth? I'm pretty sure around lot people vaccines, kids vaccines, people yearly flu vaccines. makes different? I’m going re-learn scowl. Canada here. We're surging Vax campaign could use even more. 

So US slow, send North. pay back month US needs it. like phrasing, capitalism help solve problems, can’t fully relied upon. It’s literally second paragraph. time took type comment could read article got answer question. Department Public Health says face coverings longer required outdoors fully vaccinated people except crowded settings performances, festivals sports events. Theres really reason remove mask mandates, CDC already started that. Almost restrictions supposed lift June 15, counties lift earlier want (Disneyland opened week). think indoor gatherings allowing small groups vaccinated people too.  Finally. thing exceptions COVID considered 'direct threat', employer may make accommodations could endanger employees. i.e. someone work home. Great. required close quarters employees, may make exceptions employ them. Nah September struggling keep schools open. Vaccination kids beginning. Real mass events non-domestic tourism (Oktoberfest basically foreigners) last thing come back first thing shut case resurgence. I'm French, agree you. opinion people really volatile, many follow trend turn. now, trending well Pfizer Moderna, we'll see end. right. scanned QR code. there's going simple way check confirm. actually get vaccination take identifiable info you.

Well that's true. People died COVID fully vaccinated, certainly 100%. 

Do know 100% number came ? trials, trials designed look effectiveness that. such, number misleading (and proven wrong.) 

For trials, sample size deaths PLACEBO group incredibly low. fact, zero deaths placebo group (so would say placebo 100% effective preventing two vaccine trials explicitly report hospitalizations efficacy outcome make latter issue clear. vaccine, one person control group severe COVID-19, eight people hospitalized; [Johnson &amp; 34 people placebo group severe COVID-19, five people hospitalized. It’s true zero vaccinated people hospitalized either study vaccines took effect. numbers small, can’t draw reliable conclusion high efficacy may outcomes. Diana Zuckerman National Center Health Research [pointed Johnson &amp; Johnson trial, **“It’s misleading tell public nobody vaccinated hospitalized unless also tell 5 people placebo group hospitalized.”** She’s right. can’t confident predicting effectiveness precisely wider population outside trial, either. example, vaccine trials included relatively people older 60 participants.  see fragile numbers looking compiled severe disease. **In the** [**Pfizer example, one vaccinated person developed severe COVID-19 versus three placebo group—which meant single bout disease made difference calculated efficacy rate 66 percent one 100 percent.** trials, zero people severe disease vaccinated group versus one control group, adding subtracting one would even dramatic. **The problem even greater deaths. efficacy analysis, two vaccine trials—for Moderna’s Johnson &amp; Johnson’s—reported COVID-19 deaths control groups.** [You regularly continue monitor vaccine safety even current hurdle authorization here.

No it’s troubling all. stong exploration Times article wrong, go preferred narrative?  Nice mean, mandatory anyone schools probably require BC even considering 18s yet (18+ invited sign up) even though Pfizer (approved 16+ Canada) anything else. gonna us think. long circles back U.S.
And right start easing restrictions masks. go 🙄 made bit sad first too, think it, entirely surprising. 

I said something like another comment - 65-70% population likely get vaccine (20% said definitely won't, 10-15% said probably won't/aren't sure they'll get it). We're 55% eligible population least one shot currently, makes sense starting slow approach 65-70% number. Hopefully get full approval also get approval children soon, would help lot guessing six months likely they'll enough firm data make recommendation.

So, started March, Christmas almost 8 months today. get Christmas date? No, social distancing general, article clearly states. We're close known long time.

That’s Washington D.C. 2018  Well, issues *similar*.

Undocumented workers comprise, *highest* estimates, half-percent Canada's population; obvious reasons tend participate province's universal health care, represent largest demographic not.

This terrible gap, think exactly comparable.

Agreed!! feels gaslighting. articles talking mentally healthy whatever wanted last months either? husband slowly returning outside world still careful since 1) everyone know vaccinated 2) one yr old won’t vaccinated knows long 

It would different weren’t many people scared vaccinated....but numbers going everyday hope people get vaccinated soon (0.0001%) died COVID

Is another disease IFR comparable to? issue, particularly travel piece, state opening timelines vaccination rates flipped now. vaccinated, would love fly Miami dance ass off, Boston would feel like asshole given opening 8/22. feel fair tbh. example, NACI recommended AZ well 30+, Ontario set age limit 40+ Québec 45+ comes bullshit punitivism. don’t know assume asked participate PSA Bush, Obama, Biden. sure would convince participate. gain (because it’s always personal gain) working Biden helping country improve Biden’s administration. course would helpful don’t think likely unfortunately. bit melodramatic mate.

I'm 25 15 people age range talk to, one vaccinated yet. Kind crazy see people age country overall vaccinated. guess shows much bubble in. Can't forget peoples' individual experiences going shape respond, need berate bit extra cautious. may lost someone important lives, etc. Personally, I'm fully vaccinated lost someone this. joining normal time soon, I've seen first hand do. people ready take risk yet. I'll join y'all possibly next Fall, maybe. live, choice. either vaccine offered government nothing. kid 11 damn it.

Read goddamn article. Jesus. avoid medication much possible believe many cases masks symptoms rather letting body heal. medical interventions carry risk, take high risk situations. waiting month longer probably needed indoor activities like dining can't wear masks during, otherwise resuming normal life deciding factor someone getting vaccine... really clearly looking excuse get it.

There's big difference ""I'm gonna take extra bit resuming high risk activities"" ""I'm gonna continue full extreme lockdown measures"" I'm hoping reach 70%, seems realm possibility.   don’t like almost certainly take less time unless adverse results found.

The 12-15 trial needed 2,260 participants compared ~40,000 original.

The 6 mo. 11 years trial also started end March five weeks already. I'd expect September. Problems digestive track (especially diarrhoea) known side-effect AZ. I've problems week, seems better now.

We're mobile contain anything means vaccination. get vaccinated, take care you. point, reduced likelihood contraction 90ish%. Eventually enough exposure virus slowly build familiarity immune systems reduce nothing cold. one thing learned French answer polls differently. Many express uncertainty towards vaccines, still get children shots voluntarily. may mean still see large vaccination coverage France, time tell. People realize needed done done. older risk vaccine available them, chose get it, that's risk. know considerably people real life COVID anxiety see sub. small children likely won’t able get vaccinated time.

I still prefer outside despite fully vaccinated self knowing risk good ever going be. Could anyone explain young children eligible vaccination? Also seems like many people believe ""they'll fine"" worse ""they can't get it"", would like know degree would small children ""be fine""? long term effects covid like adults hospitalized it? heart brain problems like people's symptoms suggest? What's mortality rate children covid?

If possible would appreciate information please thank you. Generally speaking feel good turn ibuprofen hope solves whatever going on. smart probably not, cheap usually effective...yep still incubation stage, might show test. pass flying colours infect everyone around week later. worries, I'm boat you! Preach brotha good enough, unfortunately. incubation period long 10 days. (Some cases take long 14 days, they're extremely rare.) initial stage, might test positive test, properly run quarantine must-have international travelers.

That is, course, can't stop international travel altogether. quarantine would need much longer 3 days Canada currently requires designated hotels.

Trump's administration relied solely negative tests ignored social distancing, masking, measures. end result? almost died covid, White House spawned several clusters.

Sooo, no, unfortunately testing alone answer - unless quarantine 10 days flight, 10 days after, make sure. Chances bad outcome *having COVID*.

With Pfizer vaccine there's statistically significant chances side effects worse mild cold flu, go away quickly.

My wife vaccinated, oldest daughter (17) fully vaccinated. youngest daughter also get vaccinated. Yeah that's conspiracy theory show much superiror danes are, idea 30μg generate stronger response 100μg. [the article linked Because
the cohort received 100 μg dose level receive booster
dose, data immunogenicity second vaccination dose
level available; however, **no substantial differences in
immunogenicity 30-μg 100-μg** dose levels first
dose.

Pfizer saw 100-μg generating better response side effects, give booster. immunogenicity data includes datapoints taken booster. Another way saying it’s 99% effective... remember correctly, article Atlantic months ago said (in US anyways) necessarily reach herd immunity regain ""normalcy."" another one yesterday title ""Don't Wait Herd Immunity."" maybe NYT article came today doom-and-gloom seems? Personally I'll fully vaccinated 27th (getting second Moderna shot 13th) probably go back eating restaurants. Anyone thoughts this? help given early virus still replicating. usually shortens overall length time person needs care.

If vaccinated people participating activities greatest risk spread, going lower threshold ""herd immunity"" (in quotes actually herd immunity would define it.)

The US wanting completely open here, vaccinated unvaccinated people moving spaces. need higher level vaccinated people keep cases low circumstances.

Maybe say succinctly: Israel using combination restrictions (mainly form Green Pass) vaccinations order drive low cases. can't look Israel's vaccination rate apply country moving closer closer restrictions whatsoever.

I think even anti-maskers dealing strongly desiring rapid return pre-COVID ""normalcy"" (as normal 2019 life was, anyway) changes normalcy make uncomfortable even anxious way handling it. see heavy count drinking-oriented things Meetup, types events represent social ""normal"" strongly desire return to, particularly strong extroverts (and become strong extroverts social lubricant really like feeling way) feel ""normal"" social situations like bars.

During meeting Hanoi May 4, Dam, also head National Steering Committee for COVID-19 Prevention Control, said outbreak different previous three ones due pressure southwestern border quicker spread new variants India.

He also reiterated need prepare plan response scenario 30,000 infection cases, adding must strive make happen.

Dam ordered 0:00 May 4, finished 14-day quarantine concentrated facilities tested negative coronavirus twice must temporarily stay there.

It must enhance monitoring pandemic community, zone affected areas wipe soon possible, said.

Warning illegal entries across border, called border guards, authorities mass organisations border provinces keep close watch immigrants.

Speaking event, Health Minister Nguyen Thanh Long urged localities seriously follow directions Party Central Committee's Secretariat, Government, Prime Minister, the National Steering Committee COVID-19 Prevention Control as well guidelines Health Ministry, ministries agencies concerned transmission risk high.

He underscored need continue following 5K principle, including compulsory mask wearing public places.

According him, Health Ministry stepping negotiations bring vaccines Vietnam facilitate technological transfer produce vaccines home.

The ministry reported May 4, world recorded 153 million COVID-19 cases, including 3.2 million deaths.

As 6pm day, Vietnam logged total 2,996 cases, 1,608 locally transmitted. 38 new cases April 27./. 16 year old sister got shot March 2 even though turned 16 March 12 🤫  pleasure. hope things get better soon okay possible! data say 263 fatalities 5/3 Generally speaking, ""responding quickly changing conditions"" strength government. Yeah, let's see numbers. now, continues falling, even Sao paulo. dumb equation made up? 

How saying 150 million produced there's north 200 million receive vaccine? many given two injections. Early UK data protection death 3 weeks 85% 90% younger age groups.

Obviously 100% could described ""rare"" example San Francisco seen cases 70+ demo 25x lower peak December/January. 400-450 less 18 per day. group 70% vaccinated. 

People younger age groups (25-39) seen cases lower 10x peak. 1,875 180 so. 

Vaccines work. [Data listed here. even Reddit. Look ""news"" channel, run constant banner showing current ""numbers"" covid infections. scare tactic drum viewership dying industry. Publishing News used getting important information people, believe changed industrial revolution News became business supported wealthy owner. never bite hand feeds you. slowly gotten worse century. know, Dear Maria (Count In) debut? tax dollars paid develop vaccine. Yet, get profit 50 year old covid recovered female hypertension donate blood plasma 44 year old brother (who's sugar)? read somewhere person blpod relation cannot donate blood plasma?

In case, I, 22 year old covid recovered male pre-existing diseases donate blood plasma uncle?

Just clarify, three us vaccinated yet always elementary schoolers wear masks tbh. Kids germ machines! got flu came back immediately got pink eye (I’m joking btw) people serious risk factors obesity already fully vaccinated now. 

And decided offer J&amp;J/AZ volunteers.  haven’t reported actual numbers take bullshit argument elsewhere. think didn’t word commentary correctly, least São Paulo, I’m seeing pubs restaurants open without proper social distancing closed areas etc. agree leads raise COVID cases. pray mild symptoms. so, that's entire point getting protected testament successful are. proof Biden obsessively masking helping hesitancy all.  False. Masks social distancing requirements stores regular life. got this! didn’t hurt personally, philosophy enabled greatest suffering human history. agree. would call whomever current administration literally going science comes precautions fully vaccinated. It’s causing hesitancy stop. I'm sorry hear bruise. long reviews usually last ? Lol... Pharma marketing payouts doctors frequently outpaces R&amp;D well. think lot unpack /u/akadriver much better job would. clearly difference infants, toddlers, 12 up. we're strictly talking little kids (and teenagers) Unlike adults, rarity severe COVID-19 outcomes children means trials cannot demonstrate balance benefits vaccination potential adverse effects favorable children themselves. short, given rarity severe clinical courses limited clarity risks, criteria Emergency Use Authorization appear met children.

Might technically true. mean still good idea so. know percentage population 12. lets assume 20%. That's still big percentage population spread virus, even direct ""measurable"" thread them. ultimately means consequences others. Lastly
Pfizer plans file full FDA approval Covid vaccine end month. whole EUA thing non-issue. mean definitely right/left thing, unfortunate is. 

It's signaling views via way approach pandemic. Liberals feel like can't return normal even science says safe way validates choices republican governors states like Texas Florida. strange problem think slowly erode time. remnants signaling quite awhile, though.  Somervillian, say article right money. restaurants STILL 25% capacity, even though rest state 100% (with distancing). led many local restaurants closed completely winter, still struggling open can't find workers willing make less tips hours less tables. 

When consider Somerville small town land area, people walk blocks Cambridge/Medford take 10 minute train ride Boston restrictions relaxed, makes SENSE. Mayor Joe disgrace. That’s great all, would private employer risk lawsuit this, especially anyone highly impacted industry low cash reserves? need hurry give full authorization employers comfortable mandating it. arm hurts, may get sleeper earlier normal. That's happened me. 

The 2nd shot left gross bruise went away week.  idea really ""why"", true, belies ""cases go summer"" belief persistent board. Yeah, guess so.. rejected opportunities increase productions since last year. Oh, I'm sure. happen live U.S. city cautious reopening (hell, NYC going reopen are). announced today goal reopen full capacity July. However, think places reopened presently good opportunity research, especially mixed vaccinated unvaccinated populations. Sorry, agree you.

In September/October November 2020, business stores open cases lowest numbers covid far Brazil. honestly think problem that, people tends wear masks public transports stores, example.

 opinion, problem bars, parties etc. 

If observe numbers, states Brazil, cities reopened business like month ago numbers continues falling... honestly think problem. I'd worried severely injured car accident way get vaccinated complications said vaccination.

You things far riskier every day without even realizing it. sweet summer children This. loudest voices rarely rational I've vaccinated 2 weeks, I'm still wearing mask one thinks I'm anti-masker. 

I really know stop wearing it. Lol Missouri, land slowpokes, unless driving St. Louis.

Edit: also land idiots basically everything wrong pandemic. well sorry rest world, USA keep kids school stunt growth. Generally, however virus needs survive reproduce. long occurs enough cases matter lethal not. needs lethal well enough point sustainable reproduction. 

There thought process here. mutations random. really no. European countries planning 70% adults vaccinated June reason taking long supply.  That's.. God, that's awful. I'm sorry.  That’s life, sure story take great rush every day driving car etc far greater risks don’t think twice normalized Anecdotes inform policy. data clear vaccination protects people high rates. would make terrifying headline people read headlines. CT 69% partially vaccinated…which even better sign we’re creeping localized herd immunity. Fingers crossed.   key word usually, always. Evolution favors increased spread, happens typically include pressure become less lethal (since dead person can't easily spread virus). thing matters increased spread though, everything else irrelevant. increased spread occurs happens kill host, still favored.

In case SARS-CoV-2, increased infectiousness likely due combination increased viral load (and better fitting spike protein). increased viral load particular well correlated worse outcomes. drive home, companies spent stock buy backs 2018 RND. embarrassing emotions can't put money rational mind's mouth is, surprising. know tempting stuff anxiety down, favor approach compassion instead. People get put woo-woo inner-child shit really works treat parts us like scared children, soothe calm them. bodies need help believing mind knows true, especially year terrifying.  feel like employers require want deal sick leave hospital bills July-August end year? Kids bite day care time. However, birth primary way. used monitor kids bitten kids, need anymore. COVID November, first shot Pfizer side effects, got second shot yesterday feeling pretty sick since last night know one nurse quit right started.. said sign type thing... Sorry, I'm remembering previous ""MISSION ACCOMPLISHED"" banners we've flown. # new cases actually goes sustained levels saw last summer I'll relax. Stop that. That’s sincere. Jokes aside Osterholm saying that, we’re end stages Oh it’s gonna happen. heard first! “Innovation” mmhmmmmmmm.

But yeah, valid critique, definitely worth reading. symptoms 2 days mild, lost taste/smell like 10 days. 

i'm freezing cold little achy today, that's curious. wonder indicates still had/have active antibodies compared you? developong countries sadly severely underreporting... simply funding systems place deal That's point I'd make. prioritizing that? Letting vaccines fester years allowing variants come existence possibly spread dangerous rich nations. focus increasing production rather securing future profits? I'm saying know would insane purposely hidden. Incompetence much likely telling way played out. scenario climate change, infrastructure, election reform - never enough ""political will"" actually solve problem.  short term gains matter. know solve problem there's significant portion population can't bothered. long immediate creature comforts affect directly, problem. Agreed. ...not tweaker. cautionary tale ride 2ish weeks 1st jab. Suicides raised overall, yet marginal. Besides uncounted Covid-19 deaths, also big portion people dying lack health system centers pandemic, less cancer prevention checking, less necessary surgeries, sometimes enough space people ICUs, etc

Australia positive numbers pandemiccompared countries. That's problem lab studies: antibodies != immunity. Additionally, comparison people who've covid, unvaccinated people. get it. think reality probably lot muddier. Upstate new York also less immune New York City disprove said.

Why super hot, AC India surging seasonality means drop? worry since can't talk tell feeling bad.

Pretty sure children still let know something wrong, even can't talk... couple(2-4) weeks required data given think. CureVac Novavax rolling review since first half february. Ugh I’m sick second shot right don’t want get third Yeah exactly, I'm agreeing you. think need authority ""Pfizer exec says need 3rd shot."" execs different priorities healthcare workers. 

The person replying bit harsh. ""protecting others"" picked J+J could better vaccine? Pfizer, I'm speaking general. person's line reasoning, think would harming others his/her eyes. probably states increased eligibility themselves, means demand getting low supplies went unused, could increase eligibility use supplies, ultimately makes old system logical states could always rely getting last weeks unused doses next week. eligibility open every adult now, makes sense use new system instead said thread Merkel's last super duper curfew, emergency brake, circuit breaker, whatever lockdown called now, pointless. going happened countries ahead, effects vaccination would kick soon rendering PR stunt completely pointless. Well, surprise, vaccines work expected. all. got second Moderna 3 weeks, 6 days 14 hours later. Everyone thoughts lag applying clearance approval might be? Yeah, think he's like dooming, kind grandpa. regret allowing get depressed anxious months indulging ""straight talk"" podcasts. wish focused less message game-changing vaccine info emerging November/December 2020. despite diversified info sources numerous advisors across globe. mishandling fault. else one imagine word open manufacturing?

Apparently, idea, one put formula online everthing else works out. work way. onus governments. companies. 

We pay companies whole lives. pay government time. pay expect help need it. 

That's vaccinations work. people mind it. 

But saying even government pay ones developed manufactured fair. 

Tell I'm missing something. even countries healthcare free, doctors nurses get paid.


So missing here? First gotta cure misinformation…  Excellent!!! see. clinic again?  troubling. Maybe cram church Sunday sing prayers hope...or maybe not. Agreed , two best friends definitely going get they’ve little lazy side. Maybe people highest risk dying take 3rd shot? friend asks help, help 'em. know effects virus decades road. understand ""No new COVID cases"".
I understand ""No COVID deaths"".
I understand ""No new COVID deaths."" live, eligible 3 weeks ago.

so... impossible fully vaccinated now.

because they're starting get booster .

first shot plus 21 days pfizer I'm hesitant allergies better wear mask. Everyone except babies 2. one want whole family vaccinated, happy least preschooler able get it. Approval drug given priority status generally takes 6 months submission. Look [PDUFA (Prescription Drug User Fee better idea normal timelines. lot time waiting turn line top time takes review data. certainly cut time 6 months, given shot already available EUA, sure still get skip line extent. I'd imagine panel reviewing data comprised lot people involved EUA submission, familiarity previous data certainly help speed things along faster vaccinate rest world, faster stop mutations. Us getting 5th dose help end worldwide pandemic. depend whether person/persons firing enough sense say why, reason right use, they’re firing you. Knew manager let slip had, opinion, many POC department. time short that... *Fire season entered chat* thanks, imagining Thank you! effective numbers presented. Can’t blame people rounding up. agree. hesitancy reason people vaccinated, can't let anti-vaxxers hold economy hostage. everyone wants it, reopen 100% anyway. 

And know people talk immunocompromised whatnot, honest, they're sick get covid vaccine there's probably lot kill covid anyway. Exactly. 2 people avoiding third shot literally save one life completely agree. I’m yet get first dose, don’t think general public, excluding need 3rd dosage, get one lot world vaccinated. still get terrific protection 2 dosages. Also, knew someone died car accident wearing seatbelt, therefore, wearing seatbelt, drive within speed limit, drive right side road. Everyone getting vaccinated part. mean highest vaccination levels country Atlanta area, wife (both vaccinated) come we’ll bring kick-ass gift. Congrats!  great terrible idea. likely cause disinformation. Relatively good news. Meanwhile Boston waiting August 22nd even vaccination rates way better... wedding November city, I’ve kinda anxious happening. huge sigh relief Well looks like I'm wrong top bottom here. would extraordinarily stupid org recognize Moderna case. could easily exception requirement receive another EUA vaccine. Can't come soon enough. % catching covid stop wearing mask for? 100% isn’t possible Featuring Dante Devil May Cry series That's implying last paragraph. Possibly, there's nothing indicate yet beyond conjecture Yeah that’s said No. I’m saying hold accountable. Especially since used taxpayer funds develop IP. need open IP. Otherwise putting profits ahead ending pandemic. Party til puke. No, third shot takes 10% back 95%. cases vaccines fade time, get tetanus/whooping cough booster every ten years. also worry variant evades current vaccines.

So far evidence either case. However time tell. Third shots prepared case either worry turns real. Exactly, yeah. 65+ thing priority. approved 18+, 64 year old slightly scooted ahead nearly thing 11 year old scooting ahead 12. mention, kids hit puberty around age 12... kid age 11 change lot 6-12 months.  skipping ahead option. need wait birthday. incentivizes exactly one vaccine hesitant. need promote freedoms vaccinated, esp since odds drop precipitously shot. would IRS implement credit? Call county see individual got vaccinated? would still stay away people get vaccinated. free vaccine. Don’t worry price insurance BS. I’m middle selling house, buying house, moving I’ve busy hell too. top priority getting jab though. Try using site makes easy find appointment. Good luck everything. Congrats graduating getting job. I've stopped worrying post-restriction mask mandates tbh. Based I've seen public transit, lake, bars. doubt mandate followed people end summer. Giving vaccines threatened populations still benefits us reducing opportunities variants emerge. OP sounds like meant give fairness would also protecting extravagances you’ve mentioned. booster time sensitive then, yes, healthcare workers also 1st  honestly want get booster shot. Give old people europe, desperately need them. even better: send india.
I refuse take booster shot sole reason Yep.  dont give vaccine Florida fantastic! don’t. part wait around bunch people aren’t going anyways Yeah never wore one outside Sacramento year. I’ve vaccinated since January, shocked trip SF EVERYONE outside, felt self conscious wore it, annoyed; read science last spring it’s transmitting outdoors. don’t follow politics, follow science. rich buy helivac out, porters guides die. Would imply ~500K per day then. Seems fairly achievable context 7 day average right around 1 million, challenging require dipping pretty heavily ""maybe"" ""wait see"" crowds (recent polls indicate ~60% population dead set getting vaccinated). vaccine doses reallocated federal storage state usage. matter. folks need convincing already live places masks required. hope get it!!!! Would love youngest vaccinated! true. Pfizer slated SUBMIT end May. Approval come weeks later. Definitely later July 1st I'd imagine. think best way encourage people would something like announce August 1st free anymore pay $100 get it. Losing getting free may motivate people. agree. There’s clearly black white it(pro vs anti) gotta find way reach grey area (apathetic/lazy etc...) you’re fully vaccinated you’re still afraid go anywhere that’s totally fine please don’t expect accommodate you. I’m fully vaccinated I’m getting life look B.C see cases falling past week. everything poor provincial leadership population doesn’t care.  Yeah, unfortunately I'm college student Alabama. :/ access opened couple weeks ago, right finals pretty busy. middle moving starting first full time job next week, hopefully going try schedule first dose next weekend -- dont know insurance coverage I'm longer dependent. something plan ask new employer day 1 Reddit users telling made spelling mistake comment worthless people serious phobia simple, unfortunately say make Pfizer compulsory, mean people received vaccine. big portion military (20-30%) opted out, military force take EUA vaccine. seen using military testing force them. discredit Moderna takers. Theyre going look around say I'm already wearing one get vaccinated they're already doing? seems like obvious decision - done earlier? I’ll go get Pfizer 

DOUBLE VAXXED don’t offer tax incentives. promise “no masks” July 4th reach goal. get done. 100% removal restrictions communicating need that.   Unfortunately, might happening summer budgeted (some city programs funded via hotel taxes 90% last year). Makes sense. get Name one EU country better vaccination record covid no, gave research Covid.

Soon social distancing masks restrictions go away, people want keep fine, need get see others living life again. coincidence 'roaring twenties' followed shortly Spanish flu epidemic last century? general, viruses - like replicating things, cant always replicate shit perfectly. 

sometimes, something happens replicating thing may lose ability replicate things perfectly, all. 

these imperfect replications, natural variance existential factor, called mutations. 

mutations pretty much anything. nothing. mutation kill replicating thing. make replicating thing replicate (GMO mosquitos!)

It enhance thing replicating thing well. sometimes even enhance replicating things ability replicate. 

when mutations help replicating thing replicate, chances also help next replicating thing also replicate. mutations get passed next generation. 

this works everything, thumbs protein hooks. well smell smell detector is. 

for viruses however, evolving kill host isnt always best practice. 

Eventually run hosts kill, end blood line. 

so, sometimes virus may evolve less ""deadly"" (meaning loses whatever trait harms host, less effectively) simply places live kill things. doesnt mean stays way, always re-evolve deadlier mutations, simply re-activate older, inactive mutations.

 isnt something virus knowingly does, evolutionary statistics work. Free others decide want give attention sounds like pretty decent answer. I'm OP. post removed article title likely sensationalized. Please use source less sensationalist title instead.

Yup. There's science behind 70%. stretch goal based currently are.

I think happen eventually (once vaccinations required colleges/workplaces/etc.), probably long high COVID rates cease thing.  likely done it.  I’ve long held didn’t explode December 2019 China. bubbling least 6 months opinion. Look India today.

Agreed, add: Pfizer making determination. They're showing data, gets approved (or not). Isn’t US almost there? is, let’s say, 250 million 16+ people US. yesterday 147.5 million people one shot. 70% 250 million 175 million, need additional 30 million first doses. question is, 30 million first doses guess. doubt splitting population two groups good strategy. always US? always seems lead conflict. nope , first one Depends compare Michigan. 

You can’t compare case counts unless factor rate testing etc. 

Michigan higher covid deaths per capita believe. site CO today Broncos cheerleaders mascot try help convince people come. Whatever works ... glad they’re trying something! year round, winter spring rainy season. incredibly difficult get past legit serious phobias. Like take years therapy. Can't ""get it.""

No good solutions ever found extremas spectrum. Employers shouldn’t get dictate employees put bodies. sad day people advocating type actions kind think we'll plateau around 60% adults. kids approved (12 next week - hopefully) least keep overall numbers moving positive direction. 

From think public schools likely private universities begin requiring vaccination proof appropriate age groups. hopefully begins capturing adolescants age 12-19 so. probably (I'm guessing) \~10% overall population good coverage year going forward probably getting another 1% aging in. mention able release &lt;12 coming say 2 years. 

Basically - think way even get close 70% total pop keep playing slow ground game adults, start institutionalizing requirement adolescants, hope gets us coming December. 

After think war attrition play coming decade likely. good news hopefully gets people basic resistance variants come quickly adopt booster strategy.  Spoken like somebody experience this. would done already easy. Sorry brain triggers response, I'll tell stop. I'm definitely category, embarrassingly enough. Told would getting day became available 2020, yet put month. Getting first shot tomorrow though. People seem getting bolder faces fully unmasked supermarket lately. people, folks look like they're hoping confrontation. give wide berth.  helps tell nurse dont want see needle&amp; look way. accommodate’ global problem extends far beyond India disingenuous claim developing world lacks resources much manufacturing occurs outside Western production capacity Covaxin unfortunately low. vaccine excellent.
With lower production comes lower amount real world data it.

And last least, Indian mindset foreign always better local, tired seeing low quality products childhood. even high quality indigenous products frowned upon prolonged, face-to-face contact. wonder test sample size hundred million help speed things along, lol work state union pushing mandatory vaccines that's want. work cramped cubicle farm (still working home right now). want person cubicles around un-vaccinated go back in-person. really feel like late May going things turn around Toronto. think we’re supposed past peak Canada now, newly accelerated vaccine timeline I’d surprised cases didn’t start dropping even Toronto end May. May, definitely June. tons people including one friends fine getting vaccine, aren’t rush lazy aren’t supper concerned. Everyone eager get vaccine gotten first dose, still millions people plan willing get one. Congrats! Awesome hear. Lol wow. People dumb vaccine doesn’t even trial results. Imagine already made 200-300M doses later found ineffective? think Curevac possibly nice addition EU vaccination portfolio, now, using resources BioNTech Moderna better. fully vaccinated-only events, sections, areas benefit? others still wear masks. yes, better chance struck lightning dying covid vaccinate. many die auto accident every day pre covid world? many died flu they've flu shot? Moderna Novavax considering Yeah thinking too. People lazy convenience key. There’s also people can’t get around easily. admit waited got email saying could get local place, people know drove 3 4 hours get vaccinated, availability. hope local doctor offices, libraries, pharmacies grocery stores, blood drive vans, etc start helping people get vaccinated. think they're legally allowed safety kids. legal thing.  goal kind tells White House expects first doses continue crater

I call ""cratering"" - we've vaccinated could access injection site willing get shot. more-reluctant more-remote take longer. Tagrisso enters chat...

But AZ managed convince NICE confidential discount list price £5,770 ($7,395) per 30-tablet PBS access breakthrough medicine lung cancer

A significant lung cancer treatment option costs approximately $88,000 year soon available little $6.60 per script, thanks expanded listing Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). approved US coincidences... fact SF liberal anti-Trump gets, became symbol. mean yes agree you, I'm still stating really bad Michigan. far vaccinated people partying together think that's okay, directives placed staying safe. still mask anywhere go around people know, even though I'm 2 weeks second shot fully vaccinated. barbershop yesterday. lady cutting hair talking colleague knows guy took Pfizer died. 

No details died, died of. lady cutting hair immediately says ""I'm never getting vaccinated. luck I'll dead 5 days"". 

I say anything lady cutting hair, want walk one piece. kind misinformation going around. 

I also live bumblefuck, nowhere. northern NJ. Certainly right better. India's case rate going up, albeit thankfully slowing pace, US going down.

They fewer cases fewer cases capita, although hard say much given certainty large undercount India moment. banking fact many people ultimately take need personalized touch get done. Whether that's doctor interacting person, localized pharmacy trying push it. 

I think super slow going, would imagine least 100k day completely crazy. also suspect people start blatantly going life without caution (as vaccinated) hopefully hold outs begin come around. worked hospital didn’t get flu shot wear mask flu season. way covid mask policy. Employers could take approach force people wear masks. know would enough incentive. I’ve got dumbest question probably ask elsewhere. But, room full 20 vaccinated employees one person, unvaccinated, masked, distanced, etc. don’t understand it’s direct threat. 20 protected virus one person taking safety measures. 

I work HR fully understand direct threat concept well ADA accommodations possibly needed can’t take vaccine I’m loss put together. think saw *maybe* two people unmasked outside SF last year. contacting prominent republican intellectuals Mike Lindell Ben Shapiro make PSAs wants happen. going happen thanks anti vaxxers cynical young people. Right. whole internet loses minds e-celebs say things like ""if young healthy vaccine necessarily priority you"". whole concept personal choice personal risk gone window, opting instead let others think Give 10% Republicans want impress me, Mr. Biden Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

Providing information studies VLP vaccine, Prof. Dr. Mandal said, ""The Phase-1 study VLP vaccine started March 27 complete first phase. end week, second dose Phase-1 study completed. phase-2 study.

Afterwards, Phase-2 study take place period 2 months, hopefully able start Phase-3 study August and, towards end year, plan successfully complete Phase-3 study open use humanity country world, ""he said. would true virus actually deadly 80 immune-compromised. 

Instead require propaganda campaign continue fear hysteria, doesn’t actually exist day day life. 

Nowhere hospitals capacity. Nowhere young healthy people dying. live fantasy world. Try CBT - would highly effective here. I'm arguing vaccine incredibly effective virtually 100% effective. however 100% effective person originally wanted elaborated on.

You however making numbers many deaths would happen everyone vaccinated. can't extrapolate current number deaths random time interval many likely even exposed say Covid kill x number vaccinated people. diehard Trump support might account 25-30% population.  could still achieve 70% vaccination without them, would take vaccinating everyone else. wife got Pfizer vaccine. Two weeks later, AC compressor car died.

I'm making shit up, folks. *Study out.* know 6 months. Get appt doctor see work something out. phobia one thing, anything work around another. right. seems some, hurting Biden important helping US. ""You're required get vaccine EUA""

""No""

Then fire 'no reason'.

That's real life works. tied county residence unless lied  Wait it'll possibly take 10 years vaccinate new group? may looking % total population numbers, different % adult population. yea, california currently tied #10 far % adult population goes, basically neck neck pennsylvania stones throw away new jersey new mexico They've relaxed cold-chain storage conditions, imagine depend lax get that; want waste shots.

Alternatively, Pfizer comes single-shot vial finds way reduce wait time ""give shot two hours taking vial freezer"", they'll able walk-ups.   Yes are. People think 3% cases reported. specifically work Cancer Center. good friend (who usually respect, think intelligent) tell believes cure cancer, there's money treating it, curing it. 

My argument less scientific. asked ""who gets cure? Patrick Swayze beloved enough it? Ted Kennedy politically powerful enough get it? Steve Jobs rich enough it? gets it?' response 'It's believe, can't change mind, okay?' Probably Ohio. They’re likely checking names anything. # doses / Total Population * 100. 

Probably enough people jumping borders move needle.  you’re working home unemployed, gotten used going out, it’s much priority someone who’s going stir-crazy working high-risk environment. eager get vaccinated work grocery store can’t avoid contact customers, sister procrastinating husband work home get groceries delivered. people without 1 shot already people hesitant resistant vaccine.

I think also got good amount people plan get it, really rush so. they're afraid, feel sense urgency. people working full time, scheduling might issue. got mine last week search one around noon could rush lunch break. seem appointments regular weekday office hours. originally hoping get Friday could next day recover needed, lucky settle Tuesday. hand, French students likely learned something year beyond use Edgenuity Zoom, unlike American counterparts. shame put trash beautiful place. Agreed - there’s got significant chunk people aren’t extremely antivax, don’t want put much effort indifferent.   fully open quotes makes feel like theres catch people without 1 shot already people hesitant resistant 

That's completely true. know people schedule June Utah opened everyone. appointments opened people know booked far think worth effort reschedule planning keeping original times. definitely getting point people put effort getting even anti-vax think people halfway dedicated getting done yet.

The next step available people grocery stores walk-ins without appointments kind like often flu shots. wish. would pay laughing gas shot epidemic end vaccination uptake say 70%, including kids, perhaps next year. J&amp;J gonna change aspect. People don’t vaccinate continue get infected infect others. 
Feel bad can’t get vaccinated due health reasons. US employers situations - fire without stated cause. services longer required. Really interested grounds terminated employee would sueing. OK, completely glossing important details here. Like: song would play? do, I've strangers run get face little warning. enough time get mask on. 


Also, like keep taking putting back I'm walking places. put forget get home. Way easier. Problem 70% gonna run politically based vaccine skeptics. honestly surprised extremely anti Biden would refuse vaccine ""fail"" hit goal. Really! Free vaccine deadly disease (USA), people want turn ""irrational"" fear. someone close relative literally *no* immune system, I'll gladly take third fourth shot. reduces chances getting ill, well decreasing chances spreading relative maybe accidentally killing them. science says, ""This reduces potential spread illness"", bet ass I'm there. people I’ve encountered aren’t even typical anti-vaxxers anything. It’s always “meh, think I’ll wait awhile get it” “I don’t really think need get it, I’m healthy” favorite far “I want wait better one covers different strains”

This happens continually cut funding education system 40 years. People don’t learn critical thinking absorb hear Although, side spectrum. talking old colleague said vaccinated he's waiting. 

I asked he's waiting for, basically turned thought still large queue long waiting times. 

I told sign today probably vaccinated within next 2 days without wait live. pretty much wide open live anyone wants one. said he'd look probably vaccinated shortly.

So definitely misinformation fixed spreading awareness. I’m surprised don’t recall. don’t know you’re talking repeatedly. It’s like I’m FDA you’re Pfizer’s mcpherson plant, getting dinged again. mold bacteria sterile areas too? Lol 

Let’s even bother wi hospital debacle. likely don’t recall either. 

I don’t really care “believe”. believe based sort understanding apparently. 

If someone can’t actually produce vaccines, like claim, that’s one thing. dozens facilities world wide saying let’s make fucking products. I’ll direct comment dozen links back stating it’s easy, hey started last year we’d likely seeing millions increased capacity. reason start either again, we’re looking going 2024 countries vaccinated. Probably people know someone/heard news someone bad reaction (fever chills, sleepy day) ignoring many others jack all.

It's shame too, second shot probably needed lasting immune memory cannot use world mortality average medecine, oxygen health care system crumbeled. go nearby district hospital tomorrow count dead bodies coming crematorium ground cemetery go see situation yourself.  updated numbers since last week 75 deaths 75 million fully vaccinated. 132 95 million, slightly higher percentage, yet still 99.99986% efficacy.

If 330 million Americans got vaccinated, that's around 458 fully vaccinated people dying COVID. Surprised vitamin E acetate toxic. Yes, think apathy number lot higher many people think. neighborhood 75% people least one shot 50% fully vaccinated people know gotten one yet 'too busy' get problems needles whatever. None anti-vax, just...apathetic. Heck, almost never get flu shot apathy although would first line get Covid shot allowed. CDC sort schedule something report daily vaccine numbers?  won’t take it, trust me. However government entities start offering holdouts incentives I’m going fucking pissed. Can't vax dumbos. 70 something million em least I’ve wondering too. likely Volunteers passion. It’s word. someone forced barely get anything work, work. Like building houses etc. Also volunteers usually need donations keep going.  70% population even want vaccine?
That seems like good question answer first Wrong sub, ha could even hesitant. people lazy, even busy. people can’t afford take day second shot side effects hit unfortunately. needs push employers understand that. *Ah shit, go again!* feel like cross “pestering” territory makes worse. Part makes frustrating, couple reminders back didn’t annoying won’t either. 

And yeah cannot understand it. vaccines ticket pandemic, someone otherwise takes whole thing seriously rush get shots That's kind point.

We bunch people hesitant covid shots, many likely flu shots point lives. bunch people care flu shot, eagerly taken covid shots.

If two together, adoption would rise. People would go mostly sure ""sure, I'm here, give both.""

Doesn't fix true anti-vax crowd, nudge people care lot vaccines...but take easy. husband moderna saying thing second shot. We’ll get high levels immunity. get hard way. know low pop areas area process pretty damn miserable. Every appointment would booked instantly, scheduling sites would show ""appointments available"" appointments refreshed like every hour, qualification requirements updated match county standards either lie go doctor get one california expanded coverage. People desperate early vaccine ended waiting crowded lines day, practically begging get virus.

I think lot easier hit 70%+ numbers go walgreens get one spot like flu shot. said resources meant quality resources. Unless companies vested interests involved, one cares. 

When company wants to, pretty good job. they're motivated profit. 

Rest time lost corruption.  co-worker tell ""Hey, booth right there, I'd probably get done"" hasn't. Mind you, we're essential we've vaccinev available us since March. Advertising walk-in locations setting mobile clinics convenient locations going get lot people, think. sister wasn’t trying super hard find appointment she’s working full time, taking care toddler, looking new apartment, found walk-in appointment offered babysit needed to, happily went got vaccine. That’s great timing. I’ll fully vaxed two weeks second shot days spare  Central valley. Definitely different here. Absolutely used buildings, rarely see people outdoors.  Ok I'm glad came question. I'm PA resident drove OH get vaccinated, vaccination go towards OHs numbers PAs numbers??? previous attempts analyzing large datasets successful “the focus building evolutionary tree SARS-CoV-2,” says Kumar. 

I get - exactly did? construction progenitor virus/Greek letter mutations/etc sounds like definition evolutionary tree. suppose used different methods, statement makes sense all. Offer $50 Amazon gift card watch change mind Can’t wait need big majority people get vaccinated first friend help make appointment go you? may scientist, points come one (or several, seeing science works) teachers striked. 63% one dose ? high, thought hovering around 50% one dose like 40% fully vaccinated. That's pretty good. Yeah cars nonfederal controlled travel start constitutional issues. PA currently 63% adults least one dose, 41% fully vaccinated. hit 70% PARTIALLY vaccinated would another ~700,000 new people. seems reachable. wait another month. next question though many people skipping second dose? would think willing get shot would get both, there's percentage people skipping second shot. Thank you!! Thank god finals actually done now, close shave made it. That's big reason I'm big behind vaccine news, big relief may 85k surely real number 60-70k every day. district alone seeing average 20-25 deaths every day 52 districs state India 29 states. district even desely populated comes average terms population. So, acn imagine situation dire government admitting. me, deaths coronavirus treatment,"" 

...but treatment oxygen.

there oxygen.

therefore treatment.

and lots people dying.

&amp;#x200B;

according me. Still. I’ve antibody titers checked employer mandated vaccines (pre-covid) good way fake that. Disagree it’s long overdue. We’re woods yet don’t well. Millions still aren’t fully vaxxed. suppose fact 'Pfizer' easier pronounce became reason *BNT162b2* called 'BioNTech'.

It even special trademark, simply can't remember Absolutely. even frustrating obvious people countries THING like going wearing masks. Hope? lost faith humanity here. see what's value human life India chant values, ethics, sanskars, traditions, faith. reality garbage. People write headlines like publicly shamed.

Pretty much side effects except very, minimal arm pain injection site. got paranoid immunosuppressant psoriasis. Thinking reaching doctor seeing get tested antibodies 2 weeks. realized /r/LosAngeles reading comment.

How awesome news making headlines! anddddddd that’s exactly you’re wrong. get media wants clicks never realize much people actually believe it. roommate said “oh heard new variants affect young people much more, i’m staying in” even tho he’s vaccinated. aunt remained complete total isolation year, read headlines saying “vaccines may protect variants” continues stay inside. TRUST ME....people see headline panic instantly believe it. media holds immense power people’s beliefs. half friends don’t even believe natural immunity antibodies exist horrible, fear mongering articles say immunity goes away. it’s horrible think Ontario cleared vaccination requirements well: considered part safety precautions, like steel toed boots helmets. time.  think that's weirdest part COVID, unpredictability affecting people. could well immunity antibodies since new, data really draw hard conclusions.

Guess we'll see shot #2 goes hoping get similar effects first shot. difference I'm politician bothered 1 million occurrences end media daily occurrences nobody cares about. Free patents them, america wont doesnt care. Meanwhile china russia helping lot developing countries rn. remember France spiked past US summer last year. comments like ""this disease unpredictable...."". Since Biden's whole covid strategy promise overdeliver I'm lot optimistic might actually hit 70% vaccinated We’re moving lowest restriction tier Thursday. Still got restrictions, everything basically open varying capacities. I’m stoked. think big discount health insurance vaccinated fairest way this. employer offers discount non-smokers, could function way. probably depends celebrity. 

Most NPR fans probably already vaccinated, Fox News hosts got vaccinated, might sway minds.  believing forcing people drive sober infringement personal freedom

It infringement personal freedom, that's OK. Sometimes personal freedom take back seat. So, zero?  meant indoors, yea, masks outside distributed like flu vaccine, big deal. Somewhere around 50% adults 65% children US got flu shot 2018-2019 flu Last spring little information COVID knew conjecture. 70% would require another 35.3 million adults take vaccine. 61 days go, means 580,000 first doses per day (to adults) average. 

This goal kind tells White House expects first doses continue crater, still worthy goal. goal 70% adults, approval teens won’t help. I'd love hear thoughts depression, schizophrenia, eating disorders. supposed get too? mental illness mental illness. I'm thinking it, major news network telling viewers accost anyone still wearing masks public, meaning risk getting attacked bare minimum safety. know sure trails age groups 6 months progress. saying much far along are. surprised see apply 2+ tomorrow, surprised waited October (that latest imagine unless announce something wrong) would somewhat surprised age groups together though (yes said wouldn't). it’s drilled head since beginning herd immunity end goal. However, would argue doesn’t really matter much since vaccines excellent reducing personal risk. think beginning big assumption we’d get flu tier vaccines 40-60% effective, case herd immunity would’ve mattered way stopping deaths 

Yeah. wild. ""Company makes money product makes"", DAE big pharma?? evil corporation?? 

food distributors/farmers could make profit margins zero give rest hungry people. construction companies make zero profit use rest build free housing homeless people. 

I agree major issues pharma, COVID-19 vaccine good success story picked apart endlessly easy demonization industry even like parties follow recommendation Yeah, given quarantine requirements, employer let unvaccinated people travel huge part job. people know getting vaccinated. recall correctly, Professor Von Nostrand also known love beach golfing. AZ J&amp;J basically completely disappear rich countries post-pandemic. one get Pfizer Moderna available.

The problem convince people poor countries without situation control like India get vaccine rich countries want. vast majority Africans 30 years old, good luck convincing get vaccine marked unsafe Europe even approved US. According article, waiting longer cancel would devastating financially much travel planning goes it. lot federal/state/local government workforce represented unions. FWIW, heard federal government military requiring vaccines, FDA approves them, could change. interesting watch. like 'except places can't distance'? outdoors entirely? Eh I’m concerned, it’s inevitable. There’s nowhere virus go  Dude, title thread talks Pfizer - first word. participate Warp Speed. know government funding prior COVID accept Covid vaccine."
