Once things go remove mandate, covid still crush hospitals. metric looking at.  work South West Florida? son asthma get I'm thinking will.

The information risks kids confusing though. death rate low, though long covid alone risk fully understand yet.

Would parents smart get young kids considering risks not? adult jumped chance would son asthma. I'm wondering parents kids without underlying conditions.  think lot folks able optimistic years this. think it’ll take lot time broader emotional traumas slough off. 

Easy hurt, hard heal. Delta offspring confirmed infectious?

If one another variant emerge. stingy misers would continue ramping vaccine production. large parts third world remain unvaccinated. 

There random factor. Even get really lucky time still remembered stingy selfish assholes historians study 2020s. Luciferase enzyme destroys Lucifer? never used masks stop flu shouldn’t mandated now. Every single mask mandate ending kids enough time get vaccinated. won’t, many governments plan keep mask mandates permanently. Congratulations Poots, played yourself.  It’s it’s coming OSHA premise unvaccinated people make workplace dangerous, argument made vaccination status remote workers affects workplace safety workers. Adding answers, south got slammed delta earlier year, peaked, downswing. Seattle weather probably getting point people spending time inside spreading. know young mean im young friends anyone vaccinated covid.i refuse hang anyone reducing chances needlessly taking hospital bed someone genuinely needs it. 

I mentioned hospital beds someone pop say BS vaccines preventing spread. Like really big issue still lower chance severe disease, help body clear virus faster. really bad weighing low probability high impact events. That's seat belt laws passed. Agreed. can’t believe incredibly poor timing masks mandates lifted time winter. already know years years experience, covid, viruses spread people move indoors winter. That’s flu season winter. Yet are, yet failing learn prior mistakes.   agency part unit government 100+ staffers mandated. Similar company stats, already put mandate place deadline passed. Prior mandate 75% vaccinated. 93%, 6% medical religious exemptions, 1% non compliant. don’t think they’ve fired anyone yet. Yes, amazing see. raising money pay oxygen condenser one members need.

It incredible week half watch sub step big way. didn’t actually show anyone “real” data yet. Yeah, that's I'm glad company requires weekly on-site testing employees office covers cost.

Lock downs worked mean taken valium night half hour before. never seems much self administered dosages. Valium something could take higher dose 3x home dose? guise COVID real emergency anymore.

You realize hospitals turning away people beds staff. 

The mandates go away hospitals longer burdened. Great question, uk ordered almost 500,000 doses US this?? That's suggested valium, administered medical settings exactly reason. probably meantion conscious sedation dental work tried gas work sufficiently. supplemental couple pills, work eventually.

Masks never going away.  planet sized one Fifth Element would God patriots?!  Lmao okay sure, that’ll definitely happen west coast. Get real. conscious sedation

Something like first thought. dentist always lets chill gas 10 minutes giving novacaine. Space much even notice give shot. Fuck joe biden ditched mine second shot. looking back Europe think mean Eastern Europe thought Germans would huge vaccine uptake no. Anti-freeze used flu vaccines, chemical called polyethylene glycol, may found anti-freeze, used vaccines inactivate flu different chemicals found various different “anti-freeze” products. harmless typical amounts (ethylene glycol) toxic.

This article pointing another example term “anti-freeze” used medical disinformation trick consumers without background chemistry. issue “I ditch mask it’s safe so”, it’s it’s never going away, it’s like safe “never catching covid safe”. Risk it’s personal, risk tolerance it’s different yours. Maybe that’s lot people already ditched masks exist yet find them. doctor prescribed antianxiety blood pressure medication far there's effect taking 3x recommended dose. Doctor think conscious sedation appropriate he's actually meantioned several times.   Surely there's someone specializes this, no?

Can take bunch valium something? I'm expert...  Wow, goes much higher thought.  better tracking total mortality rate, find interesting analyze question attribute death. cases fragile people likely die certain year, catch disease, going year death. clarify: Flu Covid Colds Measles kill, eliminated diseases, going eliminate exact number died diseases, certain ratio still die reasons (because susceptible/fragile.)

With COVID, really good data many countries many people die overall year, becomes easier see event COVID increased death burden, far substantially counted COVID deaths. (In US , weeks ago passed 1 million excess deaths: i.e. 1 million deaths happened, since COVID began.) 

Ultimately COVID reason died, even secondary reason. Many people going desire say secondary COVID reason due psychological overreaction unexpected effects. macro scale however, whatever COVID primary secondary reasons are, ultimately whatever happened caused kids age 18 die lower expected numbers everyone else die much higher expected numbers.  quarantines reduce infectious deaths kids. countries like New Zealand Iceland lowered deaths everybody. places COVID rampant, adults took big hit. Right? way civilian portion US gonna get 97% anti vaxxers keep dropping like flies. short version can't bargain away OSHA requirement, entitled bargain how's implemented.

Labor unions large supportive mandates, provided employers obey meet confer rules. We're going negotiate documentation requirements exemptions (that's big one), happen unvaccinated employees, long they're job protected unpaid leave comply, terminate, whether exemption denial grievable, pays testing, etc.

It's going complicated, complication compounded since state OSHA, 30 days release standards. functionally federal standards I'm sure something that's federal version.

I expecting this, another 3 months. spent 3 weeks negotiating voluntary vaccination incentive them, week away pulling trigger. I'd gotten bunch extra sick leave employees, well cash payments.

In light news morning, fully expect bail that. Disappointing, unavoidable. Can't blame that.

The paperwork burden actually lightened considerably. Presumably, January 4, number workplace exclusions drop close zero, relieve HR bureaucratic nightmare. fail understand argument. vaccine highly efficacious contracting spreading disease, weakens epidemiological argument enforcing it. case mandating vaccine remaining unvaccinated liberty affects individual choosing get vaccinated, actually impose burden onto unconsenting third parties spreading disease them. However, we're acknowledging primary utility vaccines preventing people dying, rather minimizing spread, goes back primarily personal liberty thing...rather epidemiological argument bringing pandemic end.

That's fine.

Sounds like confidence low. currently favorite news story. think care it. holier thou Reddit. Worst part studies like this:

Many people feel justified taking promoting medication, claim always knew, others hidden it’s use

(And somehow missed recent studies?)

You can’t proven correct didn’t evidence. guessing, following non-expert advice, gambling.

This shown smarter, knowledgeable, right promote it. attitude won't. Definitely meant tongue cheek, contrast something something ""luciferian"". Yep. Seat belts prevent deaths auto accidents. save lives, though, smart mandate them. Dum dum dum dum dum could get normal month people would simply correct things. people refuse get vaccinated, refuse wear masks, and/or come close contact others stretching thing interminably. *I must put decimal point wrong place something. Shit! always that. always mess mundane detail.*

-Michael Bolton apparently study. ""Masks suck!"" 
Boo Hoo.
You're ass. Science care believe. still part problem. orange happy colour. Lol alright buddy exactly what’s happening. It’s question. Case numbers track spread. card count Vegas, recite every Buster Posey bats 15 years. study saying US worse high income countries, would comparable diets thus obesity rates.

We’re something uniquely bad regards covid. referring Moderna vs Pfizer. mRNA vaccines small risk, adrenovirus vaccines not.  needs constituency tell that. taking account fact vaccinated people much less likely get virus first place. hard wear mask?

It's hard, I'd rather wear it, (and already don't). Yes, inconclusive conclusions retracted paper.. I’m assuming guy salary much higher median whatever position said, nearly everywhere hiring. Wait... I'm vax'd company opts weekly tests, subjected weekly tests many fuckheads want get vax'd? Wow, fuck that. But, see, vaccinated person much less likely virus first place. taken account. It’s like risk really 25 times smaller paper claimed, based enthalpy’s comment basis. study merely inflated expected numbers. studies phenomenon. again, point, case numbers meaningless Imagine making preventing people getting sick sound like bad thing simply true unvaccinated chance spreading covid vaccinated. randomly putting millions people lockdown regular basis, stifle social economic development. People afraid travel fear stuck far home without warning, willing risk opening new businesses randomly shut sometimes. happens Chinese New Year, example, kill small restaurant due loss expected profit, even government provides support pay wages rent.

99.9% chinese people havent sort restrictions since april 2020 go Philly, wear entrance event, everyone takes inside. Masks already thing past part.  Bwhahahaha! fan hard mandates. seems little German... apple flavor dewormer little buddy. Wrong. unmask now. may never achieve herd immunity.  productive. moving towards normalcy moving on.  unmask achieved herd immunity, happen faster everyone masks up! Anesthesia? ame done. believe makes difference highly vaccinated communities. support anyway.  decisions counterproductive face public health crisis right, cannot accept them. risk claimed study wrong due math error. denominator wrong factor 25, retracted. guessing someone go math fine tooth comb resubmit corrected conclusions point. I'm vaccinated done masks distancing. I, one, support decision wear mask. big deal wearing mask? helps cut transmission virus. simple. can't help?  I’m seeing that. Maybe changed graphic. Vaccination answer help quell pandemic. Continuing wear masks stay away also works dampen virus transmission. basis claims vaccine possibly causing myocarditis? would fantastic news. presume higher income countries tendency higher obesity rates, shown considerable factor covid symptom severity. Covid vaccine cause myocarditis though . exactly paper retract ?   Oh I'm sure say that. I'm also sure follow through. Quitting job willy-nilly something people truly willing do. Talk cheap. company really loses workers, bet there's going vaccine mandate. CDC always errs side conservative. say ground beef cooked well done, it’s still legal order medium-rare burger. probably did, much reading headline will. Social media news headlines change us anything choice. me, risk extremely low take larger risks daily. unvaccinated causing mutations, making vaccine less effective. vaccines came out, infection going Delta happened. Bring coffee someting. HR head sent email, almost immediately got back profane responses. got pregnant immediately shot birth control faithfully soooo apparently lol. city mask mandate. go neighboring ones don’t I’m often still wearing one, safe. I’m afraid getting sick, I’m afraid testing positive needing quarantine 10 days worst bad cold, symptom wise. 

But masks? fucking suck. hate goddamn much. They’re uncomfortable, hot (especially summer humidity), hell people sensory issues like me. matter long it’s on, still feel there. hinder communication personal interaction, something huge part job. I’m giving person training weeks we’ll see goes masks. 

If people want keep wearing masks it’s necessary, go it. honestly may keep wearing public transit, airplanes, trains. want MANDATES stick around something commonplace flu. genuinely absurd. It’s draconian. chances fine.

But I'm going give family bit better odds I'll around next year take care them. people getting side effects booster? Central Europe vaccination rate ranges 54% Poland 66% Germany Switzerland. Slovakia like 42% population vaxxed.  Case numbers track spread. Dead morons 2nd, long ago? would love ditch mask, safely so

Go get booster worried waning immunity. I'm sorry go that.

I researched long covid. vast majority cases clear weeks. Vaccination also reduces probably experiencing it. I'll take chances.   ""One way account methodological problems use simpler measure, known “excess deaths”: take number people die cause given region period, compare historical baseline recent years. used statistical models create baselines, predicting number deaths region would normally recorded 2020 2021.""

Not really exact science. quick estimate throw together excel hours. 

And assumes everyone Florida it, else someone would come forward eventually leak false numbers. democrat doctors, administrators, counties would surely raise red flags, right? Welcome. main purpose prevent people dying, lot people seem perfectly ok risk, force get it? playing devil’s advocate here. Construction  Navy first lot things proud of.

Best floaters one! Weight limits drowners. hit car killed too. Risks everywhere. I'll take chances. worn mask many months never intend again. much vaccine (both shots modera context) help patients 90?

My grandpa vaxxed recently tested positive I’m really concerned sarcasm? **Nov. 5, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

Yup. 99.9% survived deaths cases currently decline 6X covid booster accidentally!!! girlfriend watching netflix tonight sudden frantically started texting father. released hospital 12 hours monitoring administering fluids. He’s fine right now, I’m curious similar cases. hospital called cdc said first case aware of. Anyone heard overdosing covid boosters? Again, we’ve learned nothing then. It’s law places wear seatbelt, generally protects you, seatbelt wearer. Masks protect others, wearer. Many Asia already wore masks covid. hard wear mask? Sure. NYC, Phoenix, Austin, Nashville, San Diego, Chicago last 3 months. Chicago claims need masks. wear outside ubers. please point data getting shot actually reduces transmission virus? studies I've seen point opposite vaccine ""leaky"" vaccine (that's actual scientific term I'm silly), I'm curious people still think vaccine good idea? I'm honestly trolling  I’m 90% vaxxed still pushing lockdowns. new goal “fewer 10 people hospital covid”. province population 750k. always goalpost move trust held vaccine needle today. completely harmless nothing going arm. even shaking held it. took cover flexed metal bit. amount effort took flex metal bit showed going snap arm. size needle showed definitely going hurt.

I know fact could hold needle filled covid vaccine skin without cover hardly raise heart rate. moment needle goes fraction mm skin I'm going break down. moment needle intends go skin I'm going start panicking. know I've tried summer.  Got courage go courthouse get ID renewed today 3 months expired. 99.9% people infected COVID Florida previous wave still alive lmao.

STIKO always day late dollar short. antivaxer movement got really jumpstarted? debunked paper linking vaccines autism got retracted?   pretty important clarification clickbaity title: “There may plenty vaccine available, uptake vaccine equal,” emergencies chief Dr. Michael Ryan said press briefing Thursday. Yes was. Vaccinated also spread virus. lesser extent unvaxxed still do. Y'all getting skin checks? That's privileged shit.  somebody explain vaccine mandated story anthrax. got series some. people upvoted need give rest. describe energy level part bit though, least job perhaps pre covid routine? Makes sense. Seeing pretty well I'd include good portion spoiled fucking brats know good it. Although also would exclude good portion minorities US seeing still treated adequately legitimate high amount mistrust towards gvt. Probably could said minorities countries far less extent. worried immunocompromised person, can't continue wear mask even though I've received 3 shots. probably need decide whether let employer know fact work remotely indefinite period time hope catch it. 

My original plan continue wearing mask closer endemic, getting sick going risk ICU bed. Fortunately, like I'm organ transplant cancer patient stop taking meds, die. Here's thing: ""Operation Warp Speed"" last prez, current. last prez took vaccine leaving office.

It makes zero sense political party effect adoption rate. anything, liberals b vaccine! lol

The vaxx fight pure political theater enrage stupid voting certain party back office. going work. side effect? Covid spreading killing people.

Oh well.

""It is.""   Apple next super spreader event. Get real profits. Go apple! country. international embarrassment. u stapler? wearing mask living fear? wearing condom living fear trying get dick covered warts spread megalomaniacal progeny? feel like that. say venting first comment, then?   Ok. Fine. affect taxes country then? doctor cannot give “smart words,” say parent, stress level Covid dropped dramatically teen able receive vaccine. zero concerns “long term damage” whatever told multiple doctors smart people life know history vaccines came fruition. long term affects Covid way worse.   reservoirs new variant may even contagious give breakthrough cases although considered ""mild,"" makes feel like garbage makes things smell like garbage 6 mos. afterwards.  ends justify means case. need end crisis. Good, shouldn’t get cushy retirement get discharged ignoring orders. prefer Joe Pesci. ""Joe Pesci given DNA"" sounds divine. sorry you, too. Theoretically would limit spread. somebody infected, could walk past thousands people getting stadium. seats, handful people close enough risk.

Same thing fit mask rules restaurants. Damn. sorry. Hope avoid obviously, worth wearing mask.  veteran, approve consequences. So, tells possible 1/3 people Western World above. Bc unvaxxed numbers seem holding up, least right now, levels across multiple countries. include US that. hate we're polarized we're literally taking different medicine based party affiliation.

I would overjoyed ivermectin great cure covid. seem like, properly administered, (i.e. chugging horse dewormer) positive effects. also seems like better alternatives. Let's keep studying things ignore noise. vaccinated travel lanes... trust company makes it, scientific basis potential therapeutic effect COVID-19 pre-clinical studies; meaningful evidence clinical activity clinical efficacy patients COVID-19 disease, and; concerning lack safety data majority keen sell much possible? hell garbage ever get published? That’s ton people died Florida, Michelle. It’s hard people infected they’re dead. 

Florida example anything good pandemic. Lol. Yes many meds manufactured India. partly thought Bill Gates' statement regarding open source vaccines ridiculous. saying, Covid course kill pretty nasty even vaccine. housemates (all undergrads) got it, vaccinated, absolutely wrecking week. life threarening still... careless protection, since thought it'd almost assymptomatic young, healthy vaccinated. experience convinced young people often super bad too. could done lot better. 

You're right, numbers lot accurate. Especially look places like Africa basically nothing counted. However, unlike many poorer nations uniquely capable better resources hand. poor response. 

I deny obesity serious problem United States, definitely is. many friends medical fields around world. One interesting things noted United States support preventative care stop medical problems like eating healthy life style changes. proof need typical hospital food given tends consist mostly carbs processed foods. tend hand pills surgeries instead really focusing making changes. Many European cardiologists focus much harder teaching patients preventative measures bad medical problem happens. cardiologist spend large amounts time surgery instance instead. medical system preventative practices patches making money. That's one problems allowing obesity get by. Again, talking many friends countries agree people Untied States bull headed. always know what's best. brother morbidly obese knows needs refuses says he'll die day anyway... 

I think comes obesity need programs work people instead going doctor stepping scale telling someone overweight eat better. program worked people everyday lives would much effective. know many would say need eat better exercise. would obviously agree someone that. However, looking side leaf difference smoker someone cannot control cravings? problems controlled regions brain. Many people admit hard stop smoking recognize eating. studies coming showing brain structure genetics play role obesity well. simple many use non-obese people think.

Therefore, looking covid showed us obesity implement programs help people step step make widespread. Economically could save country lot money would far less sick people sure. 

It probably help covid protocols shut lot people homes lol Q able stop happening thanks Clairvoyant nature energy feed following guidance. Great, scare away Satanists. Early 2021 long since came passed  Cambodia releases data vaccination status people died Corona. 90% adult population vaccinated. 36% deaths group. 68% deaths 10% non-vaccinated. Almost 7X overrepresentation. Cambodia using Chinese SinoVac / Sinopharm.

A couple things may distort numbers compared Western perspective.

1. Cambodia geriatric (average age: 24yo) West. Perhaps young people higher/lower risk breakthrough infection compared older people? know.
2. Many older Cambodians still traumatized Communist holocaust late 70s. people may less likely see government assistance, since they're older (and bad mental health) vulnerable. non-vaccinated may skew towards vulnerable, effectiveness vaccine overstated. know.

Anyway, take-aways. 1) 90% effectiveness vaccines seen reported seem right. 2) people's (who absolutely way associated Westen multinational medical corporations' marketing departments) attempts try cast doubt Chinese &amp; Russian vaccines wrong, extremely irresponsible, downright evil. wut boat. think loud mouths delete internal comments social pages go get vaccinated. learning 5 weeks vacation 29 years service won’t handed pushing button computer don’t understand.  Science doesn’t say “significant” number young males experience myocarditis. Get facts straight. cylinder lifts broke, panted piece PVC pipe black used seat wheels. 

It sit job anyway, missed chair. I'm Wildcard! mean “made difference whatsoever”?

Isn’t 1.3% case fatality India 19% better 1.6% case fatality U.S.?

(I’m saying ivermectin cause difference, it’s small difference.)  doubting you. Would like know more. citation long-term problems 1890 pandemic? The retraction marks 189th for papers Covid-19, count.

Then consider huge proliferation pre-print articles get uncritically held fact. 

And every 2-bit PhD, economists meteorologists, decided pretend public health experts.

*And* even high-quality, vetted information part collective journey understanding (will) change good faith time, always learning correcting.

There much noise information anyone get lost it. always find expert tell tribal opinion correct, they'll sound really smart do. Argh! Oktoberfest?! I’m soooo sorry trust someone defend nation terrorists much coward ro get vaccine? That’s patently false. multitude studies saying numbers severely underreported. 

On top that, like said, study comparing high income countries. Nearly high income countries obesity crisis right now, however better. Obesity issue here. vaccine protects much better mask.

The CDC changed guidance trying keep unvaccinated people safe (and masked). hard mandate masks unvaccinated. look mortality rate vaccinated breakthrough infections, right line flu. case unvaccinated people, covid much deadly.

You need get booster want one. still well protected hospitalization/death, decent protection infection. See real vaccine that's I've saying.
This based real definition vaccine changed could meet requirements ""vaccine"" Please understand, little country mask mandate. country moved on. basically bay area LA refuses move on. Many locations banned mask mandates. Live choose live choose. Please leave alone. change already is. I'm pointing unnecessary *actually* *you* pretend offended change.

The fact Eurocentric hold nonsense is; fact want cling weird part. probabilities multiplying factors to?

Infinitesimal? Define ""go away."" 6 states mask mandates now. cities them, even close them.

In places without mask mandates, *maaaaaaybe* 1/3 population masks. worried about? people w.r.t. masks really affect you... like completely change terminology one complex sciences man come with? Latin offends somehow? does. know it’s anecdotal I’m one unfortunate sufferers (pericarditis still) Wow interesting move apple. Good them.  we’ve never mask mandate flu season, mask mandate last years flu season due covid, led time record low flu season think we’ve never mask mandate flu season, go back old ways learn experience?

Two things:

1. Maybe mask every year flu season. **But needs something public decide (e.g. voting), something mandated unelected public health officials.**

2. also absolutely real concern encounter viruses frequently bodies harder time fighting encounter (and, eventually, People never wore seatbelts before, started wearing didn’t before? Maybe take opportunity realize masks flu season may better flu vaccine produce.

Seeing people's faces important aspect communication part human experience. think seatbelts all.

Masks important pre-vaccine. Now, there's reason many like them, resistance change. Misleading title. People vaccinated proof infection (genesen) also allowed jnto restaurants  agree. don’t blindly trust Pfizer vaccine children since haven’t seen sufficient trials examine myocarditis risk. course not! want wear uniform babes, hold fire hose climb ladders don’t expect summarize detailed médica report headline post title. information general public, purposes inform, information presented clear intended manner. sensationalized embellished misrepresent information circumstances. 

Like pointed years life lost per population size meaningful way normalize data something comparable familiar concepts. Car accidents per year, infections per 100k people, side effects occurring per 100 people. present context data immediately intuitive average reader.

The Section titled “Self-Serving Framing Messages” speaks issue metric. Anesthesia understanding pain relief, like novacaine. doctor give novacaine, really I'm concerned pain. General anesthesia supposed IV days, case something goes wrong. order get IV need get needle, I'd back initial problem. 

I really wish way get vaccine except shot. Nasal spray, drink, literally anything else would fine. Science says significant number young males experience myocarditis mRNA vaccination. don’t explore child vaccines trial size small examine myocarditis risk?  maybe stop pushing mask mandates till population sufficiently vaccinated. said before, community safety. quite care do, care pushing relax mask mandates we're close sufficiently vaccinated country. Amen selection bias, health care workers first get mandates first groups resist one spearheading court cases. think particularly vaccine resistant group. shopping anywhere need mask. I'm putting yeah plenty anti-vaxxers say thing. bad lean lies. Boom les go I'm surprised even operate phone computer lack intelligence. News flash: got vaccinated. needed I'm hell lot fun. Sorry miserable. Ok, compare Orange county Santa Clara county. lot difference. Santa Cruz? seems like discount data agree preferred results. Whatever works you.

I also see kid. 

I really worry districts may make mask mandates permanent. Right least bad option, bad option. time people realistic conversations ramps masking visitors, reminder keep air flowing. Obviously time!  anti vaxxers take vaccine.. 
i dont get logic.... CDC FDA approved boosters something like 90% vaxed adult population.

There’s someone bickering it’s CDC FDA. bet hair slicks back real nice  Satan 5G!!!

NO 5G VACCINE!

Yes, fully pfizered. 2 years people still think vaccine marking beast. necessarily. US, 40% adults obese. Canada, 30% obese. France, 20% obese. Also, 75% Americans overweight (that includes obese Americans).

American lifestyle car-centric extent high income nations not. notice errors data sets hundreds entries time work I’m even data analyst learning experience there's one 2 sources big idea flies face science, maybe believe it. vaccines may require doses part primary series order provide long term protection. We’ll likely better understanding next years. retraction solidify minds powerful proof is. ""They want truth getting out, pulled evidence!""  ones getting vaccinated probably also ones likely use excessive force. *Since 2 threads responded similar comment one, pasting response here.* 

The anti-vax people deniers way political reasons maybe many ones mainly political reasons, though often use anti-vax talking points try petty, likely support pills support monoclonal antibodies. long think political opponents prefer advocating them. Yeah Americanisation society happening. refuse acknowledge them. Why? Spain already given 1 million booster shots. Look new infections. low stable while. Yes winter coming many vaccinated ppl helps lot. Plus everyone wears asks.  Unvaccinated individuals 6.1 times likely get infected vaccinated people. Testing helpful, vaccinations quickest easiest way improve workplace safety COVID-19. 3 shots already still blaming unvaccinated shot doesnt work? Get clue mate 😂😂😂 It’s flu    Guy work got booster. Knocked ass day half. said similar reaction second shot seems whatever second shot booster well maybe? anyone negative reaction second shot reaction booster? could write fucking Stars would still get request next job...

\#lovehateExcel got vaccinated. Covids Never offended something absolutely agree Looked book appointment Moderna booster yesterday saw warning men 15-29 Myocarditis. second shot knocked butt pretty good, myocarditis. worried getting booster? could said monoclonal antibodies. Absolutely yet vaccine immune response shore immune system... sigh. Logic lost. see point, dangerous, delta variant employees/businesses pulling fed? I'm sure. Yep, understood.

The 89% reduction death hospitalisation high-risk patients. Maybe low-risk patients cuts risk 10%, knows. Granted low-risk patients already low chance hospitalised first place, say reduces risk 89% general statement incorrect. vaccine = get covid
pill = get covid late. People already pooping stomach lining.  Less 25% India fully vaccinated. Yes, hold, manipulate, format, display data. barest definition database, Excel one.

I completely unaware retraction, recently read news article it. Thank mentioning this. 

Funny news articles/social media wont blast retraction notices. Ask IKEA  UK even come close hitting hospitalisation levels previous waves. Oh thank you. They’re scared needles word vaccine. votes? Seems like reasonable post sharing reasonable observations. HIV misinformation still tragic problem countries.  lot people. Taking something guaranteed make sick going least cause pause whole lot people. booster makes sick second shot reasonable think another booster year would cause thing. figure keep side effects get people it. mean, CDC saying exact thing months ago. wanted folks open windows fans going…for Christmas. According article, change affects customers 100 Apple’s 270 US stores, Apple still need remove masking requirements future, least cover rest stores US beyond.

Moderna original doses 100 micrograms mRNA .5 ml suspension includes ingredients like stabilizers, etc. booster dose moderna .25 ml instead .5, cuts active ingredient mRNA 50 micrograms.

Pfizer’s original dose 30 micrograms mRNA, given injection .3 ml total, including mRNA ingredients, booster dose exact same. Yes agree ventilation helpful. I’m dubious anyone follow advice.  studies say vaccine alone isn’t directly causing it, improper injection vaccine causing it. It’s supposed go muscle go bloodstream directly that’s issue. got booster get 6g control metal objects 4 feet away, 10/10 would recommend Possibly… Alex jones Ron DeSantis told take it, surely would.

There many likely scenarios know yet, eventually: either Covid become yearly shot, become 3 4 shot course, initial 2 3 shot course every often (bi-yearly every 5 years, etc.)

We'll know time goes studies continue. Damnit... That's whole reason got stupid vaccine. without protection infection covid spreads like crazy - look UK Europe. Many vaccinated die hospitals getting full. obvious solution stop pretending vaccines two doses give everyone booster - many countries currently. Vaccines alone answer need properly given three doses two one. This. Italy ICU occupation rate still 4%, i.e. literally nothing, despite less ZERO restrictions except indoor masks green pass.

Vaccines masks **work.**  Projects run Folding@Home team, COVID Moonshot, looked protease inhibitor molecules targeted areas SARS-CoV-2 shared protein structures across known coronaviruses. sites remained unmutated across coronaviruses since first emerged, great targets insanely unlikely mutate, work viruses coronavirus family.

Hopefully COVID Moonshot team produce open source molecule completed clinical trials around year now. point may at-cost protease inhibitor coronaviruses. see articles topic, Pfizer pill labeled experimental. pill certainly experimental clinical trials. I'm curious NYT use label? OK. That's great. 'As soon possible', still works given later.

Colorado struggling right now. We’ve seen Texas, Florida, Utah handful states struggle keep hospital demand. However, believe mask mandates make difference— NPI still around we’re talking here— need see proof. 
 
FWIW, I’m speaking someone Chicago. hospitals nowhere near overburdened it’s flimsy mask wearing thats preventing that. It’s strong vaccine coverage. There’s emergency yet we’re still governed air “what if’s” “wait sees” present March 2020: guise. stored away

Citation needed. Yeah thats true, also shows allow height incidence. 80% vaccinated, 20% still clogg hospitals. Also remember people yet get vaccinated want to, like young generations.

It reminds diet soda sold health item. Pretty ironic worked d*mn well. talking STIKO, vaccine skeptics. highest committee terms vaccines, comparable CDC FDA. STIKO already recommends boosting people highest risk like elderly. high quality dataset comment made recommendation vaccinate 5-11yo, STIKO expects comment weeks. EMA allow market release anyways.

Personally I'm interested Merck COVID treatment pill approved UK going mean whole debate. Seems makes like flu far treatment options. Vaccine available want it, medicine available treat want go route. IMHO, going lot harder government mandate vaccine apparently pretty effective treatment option like diseases. proves effective, expect massive wave lawsuits people sue jobs back leave vaccine refusal. also explains current wave Europe - half vaccinated likely longer protection infection. 

It legit bothers news want admit part. good idea get booster older age. wish transparent Weaponized idiots can't replace heavy equipment operator years training schmuck street quote Hofmeister iirc, yeah, STIKO also recommends boosting people immunodeficiency people contact people, medical staff staff elderly homes similar.

Did imagine them?   mean need yearly boosters?  ❓ question: 
If person took vaccine shot today - contagious vaccine not? OSHA would pushed rules earlier could takes substantial time full process. Mandates contractors healthcare went effect immediately announcement planning mandates  Maybe hesitant begin eventually got jab found fine anti vax stuff bollocks all. Enjoy autism booster! Seconded vet. Get article 92 they’re baaabyyyy.  don’t lot vaccine hesitancy around anyways, latest measures (restricted travel unvaccinated people) helped convince hesitant population. We’ve 700k deaths might part lol  worked clinical trials work academia sometimes sadly deal quantitative data (I much prefer qualitative work). kind thing common requires rigorous checking data various people. pandemic academic climate 1.

Could handled better? sure.

But compared many governments still handled better side! Cases half highest peak deaths much much lower. think count together usually it’s either/or whole company funny J&amp;J mRNA effectiveness dropped 86% 13%. health insurance since May, since college student age 24, insured via parents anymore money insurance, since broke student job

You needed health insurance covid vaccine. free even without insurance!

And girlfriend got first shot, ID already lost validity 4 months. gave shot despite this, told get new id second shot.

But past stays past. Tthe important thing get shot soon now. worry unvaxxed might overwhelm hospitals might die enough resources deal emergencies, preventative medical care.

I worry borders might close overnight I'm country higher numbers. 

I worry endure restrictions longer unvaxxed.

Actually.. worry. *resent* above. actually answer that. (This abbreviated version goes clinical trial. Anyone sufficient background able add 'actually ....' they'd right. I'm giving broad overview)

The data scientist sees results. involved developing study, make sure data collected usable, on, they're dark data get final report. 

The data (or be) entered Excel. entered database created study. Usually person entering data involved collecting data. done ensure there's bias entering it. person entering data also blinded know treatment patient getting (again, there's bias reporting).

So. happen is:
Person 1 - performs study. 
Person 2 - documents happens source material (report forms, clinical notes, etc(
Person 3 - takes notes puts specific database
Person 4 - gets results database 

What likely happened person 1, 2 3 could person, possibly agenda. time got person 4, trusted system looked data. 

(That's say many points catch this. 'end data' include numerator anyway. Even Person 4 seeing individual data point, least know n thing they're reporting. helped create study, know star n be.

Source - I've worked clinical trials 20 years. Agreed. full vaccinated plus booster, wearing mask entire pandemic expected, starting wear mask. get sick future wear mask around people. Masking extremely effective coupled social distancing, threw window long time ago. Maybe antivaxx AfD party.

It true AfD supporters oppose vaccines most; however, general opposition mandatory vaccination Germans remember two dictatorships country's recent past. makes sensitive mandatory measures imposed State.  cost money symptoms. people actually need tests days?  much complex social issue that. cigarette attached someone's body. Thus, shaming much easier. found training people gym using positive encouragement much effective. gave much stronger motivation shame made want come back. Shaming tends push people away bad problems. Negative feedback motivate some, like myself, I've found much less effective.

For cannot escape obesity due health factors prevent extensive movement, shaming helpful. know someone due chronic Prednisone use autoimmune disease destoyed joints cannot almost exercise hard unfortunately. 

I say though, encouraging lack exercise poor eating general population good all. billboards encouraging it. 

My German friends like point one biggest problems sugar everything here. I'll never forget German friend going store store looking loaf bread high fructose corn syrup sugar it. finally got angry throw loaf ground lmao said matter country. sugar everything. One biggest problems food options tbh. Masks impede things like communication. boyfriend accent pretty much rely translate majority he’s saying people. legit see frustration build eyes he’s repeated third time. becoming increasingly clear, we're looking future boosters every couple months required. 

We'll need booster twice year. primary reason large numbers unvaccinated result large outbreaks, turn lead new variants. variants sooner later escape vaccines. Thus, deal anti-vaxxer problem first ever want get pandemic. ☝  described T. even start breathing heavy get blood taken. I've never traumatizing needle incident.. natural anxiety towards them. said suck look away Preprints? Usual procedure prior printing results studies vetted scientists, prior actual publishing i.e. peer reviewed. Due current fast furious need hare data Covid-19, many (if most) studies shared prior proper “peer review.” studies get big *asterisks* say “preprint.” Many people don’t understand difference.

Then again, Lancet actually published Andrew Wakefield’s fraudulent study regarding MMR autism, ultimately revealed utterly flawed, fraudulent ultimately retracted; led Wakefield losing medical license; exposed business interests - damage already done. Yep How?  act way believe get sick. get sick they're willing take anything doctors offer. got Moderna booster initially getting Pfizer, brother, doctor, told studies showing heterologous boosters giving people better protection sticking brand. really, think anyone would fine sticking Pfizer.  participants unvaccinated, mild-to-moderate COVID-19, considered high risk hospitalization due health problems like obesity, diabetes heart disease. Treatment began within three five days initial symptoms, lasted five days. Patients received drug earlier showed slightly better results, underscoring need speedy testing treatment.” government desperate whole thing end. likely subsidized free US, like vaccine. 1 20

 recognize COVID symptoms? get tested time sneeze? one jump ""proper ventilation"" respiratory disease bloodletting?  wonder this. considered fact vaccine prevent contracting spreading covid, sense makes person asymptomatic. Vaccinated people however allowed gather groups, entertainment work. 'Life normal' say.

How many vaccinated people tested? numbers available? unvaccinated must test practically everything, there's good data available group.

The unvaccinated can't easily go unnoticed get infected, since share space asymptomatic vaccinated required test, could see indicator many vaccinated might unknowingly carrying spreading covid? Sort canary birds used mines detect dangerous levels carbon dioxide.

The current rise infections Europe would make sense this. number much worse lower vaccination coverage? Yes, thing I'm wandering about.
How recognize COVID symptoms? get tested time sneeze? confirmation safety large groups people (typically 1,000–3,000) confirm efficacy**, evaluate effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare commonly used treatments, collect information allow used safely.[29]Phase III	Final confirmation safety efficacy	Testing large groups people (typically 1,000–3,000) confirm efficacy, evaluate effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare commonly used treatments, collect information allow used safely.[29]

Clinical trial sizes determined sizes unrelated trials. 1) everyone get vaccinated yet, child group approved 1.5 months away fully vaxxed status.

2) cases state still rising highest they've wave.

Wearing mask benefits virtually downside, problem continuing least everyone wants vaccinated be. Sure completely different chemical backbone mechanism action, it’s basically thing. mean they’re pill form everything. Right. 

For situation, height pandemic limited amount people seen (to like 1-2 day). seeing one patient, quickly left office let windows rest ventilation. one side, one rooms, windows screen air went quicker way. . know American nobody social distancing shit anymore. We've peeled ""6 feet apart"" stickers ground, we're putting back on. how? implications? we've studying reporting genetic influences disease for.... ever? Pure culture war bullshit. vaccine -- Alabama kids age 14 go get it. ending Rona pandemic might benefit Democrats, they're willing sacrifice kids. teachers. parents. ... long symptoms going ICU? imagine thinking masking social distancing effect, lol. Covid also immune conspiracy theories. Also horse paste (I’m sorry, totally human drug Nobel prize). 
If actually researched things yourself, would know ivermectin worthless Covid. Anytime study comes supposedly shows benefits it, it’s later retracted major errors right scientific fraud.  mean 5G pill. Let rewrite headline: “Vaccine highly effective preventing death even among 65, significantly risk Covid mortality.” spludge screen? ^^ much lower prevalence - case original trails took place summer 2020) efficacy simply looks much better… Yup. F em.  Oh absolutely. think original comment maybe expensive give positive result precaution. also yes, it'll expensive.

If covid, insurance government throw money vs risking insane hospitalization costs. Merck notably study patients least 1 risk factor made likely get severe outcome. read enough pfizer study know methodology well could used randomized set population.

a source that:  rest us effective vaccines effective treatments breakthrough cases, horse (and probably real, TBH) paste eaters go rot care. Umm. Ritonavir intravenous used force multiplier:
It currently used augment HIV treatment increasing bioavailability co-administered anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs So, anti vaxers take pill? called citizen reporter media outlet allowed China cover covid crisis first started Wuhan. one attempting record crisis early days. arrested silenced. going hospital open street camera call conspiracy? better quit breathing, cause enjoying way much freedom. label lvermectin (lower case L) horse pic insight might prevent long Covid? They’be said long Covid happen even mild cases know it’s based severity. Long Covid number one concern whole Covid situation.  afford it. Merck charges $700 - Pfizer's effective bespoke Covid antiviral drug opposed rebranding existing antiviral, I'm guessing cost more.   main protease (Mpro) 

THANK YOU. title 100% false, asking for. correct title been: ""The drug, Paxlovid, binds enzyme called Mpro (a virus specifc protease) stop virus replicating"" misinformation Christians bad people spreading misinformation vaccine.

imagine saying actually believing No, honest numbers.

That statement going require evidence support it. Yes, Evergrande mysteriously able make bond interest payments refuses reveal source funding. wonder could be?

You aware *30%* GDP real estate. That's 5-6 times economies. still 4 times US pre-2008.

The Chinese government propping bubble last 20 years. ironic actually believe China's economy based financial smoke mirrors. Wish redditors kind passion metabolic health. see something insurance would happy pay for. Heck, maybe government might pay need certain length time. Especially given current situation. peanut butter shot.. feels like open ass check insert container peanut butter. took long disapate  Effective ventillation needs air flowing B. rooms windows one side, ventillation benefits reduced.

The setting also important. offices school, rows tables mean open window slow draft carries aerosols infected person happily slowly along next 10 people sitting down-wind. I'm wondering well. I'm vaccinated boosted zero concern I'll hospitalized die Covid. I'm still worried getting mild breakthrough case suffering long term symptoms, especially since seems like correlation sick get developing ""long covid"" losing taste smell.

I think people who've never chronic health issues understand horrible thought losing taste 8 months year sounds, would great treatments developed also ended preventing long term issues. viral RNA translated proteins necessary replication strung together one super long peptide chain. Covid’s main protease (Mpro) needed process proteins cutting specific conserved sites may become functional. Pfizer’s drug specifically inhibits protease may carry role thereby block activation proteins preventing replication.   I'm going assume smart enough realize donating going prevent getting booster. smart enough know live country giving boosters, country's supply affected poor countries getting vaccines.

So lack intelligence keeping donating...it's lack compassion abundance animosity. exactly immature said?  FAKE NEWSSSS!!! SCAM huge conglomerate drug company conspiracy FAILED US GOVERMTENT DEEP state Hillary get us take drug would make us better! TAKE drug TELL US TO! PROMISE!!!


/s agree, media spreads much misinformation fear. see thing states, states. split time California Florida find people California believe people dying streets Florida. reality much different people far less focused covid. Hahah watch anti vax crowd move goal
Posts Since Trump Republicans. Ok, get boosters lol

Bro know hoping for. never developed 'cure' influenza yearly flu shots prevent severe illness without mandating restrictions, COVID shots even effective flu shots. us decent health insurance do. We're also likely vaccinated though. (U.S. centric answer course) like living even covid...got it. think pandemic cause well. necessarily draw parallels. difficult traumatic time most, even us better off. would try addressing anxiety traditional methods used things, might help.  Like said don’t live there, maybe people don’t mind opening windows winter heating house. Guess see. Well, 2 kinds pill treatment people. Hope help control whole situation even more. wife pro tease...kills me. Sarcasm save friend...if usefull info pls share comment?...as probably know covid strange little bug, immune sarcasm.  prone mutations? f\*\*\*ing idiots still deserve die even though they're idiots! costs research trials. said sell discounted prices less wealth countries. Finally, hopefully argument antivax family.

 Still, think they'll stubborn, despite trump taken vaccine anti vax yet vaccine taken leaders. Two headed idiots leading people deaths. 

We live strange times , certain. true anti-viral stops virus replicating. results return 1930s-style Western supremacy. Spoken like 14 year old. Well done.  keeping Evergrande situation?

i heartily endorse way cpc dealt evergrande -- make investor class foot bill, rather US approach, bailouts billionaires sticking working class

i also really think economy rocks, unlike US economy, based financial smoke mirrors -- china actually *makes* stuff, entire world monoclonal antibodies everything else treats symptoms. like peepee needle take man pill antivirals similar directions. works like Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), probably two modes:
1) People come general upper respiratory infection get tested, likely flu, COVID, possibly others (strep?) depending presentation doctor's evaluation. COVID, probably get script therapeutic sent way (or antibiotics strep Oseltamivir flu, etc.) idea get better quickly prevent severe disease.
2) People hospital severe disease. point, usually beyond window therapeutics tested/intended for, still effective reducing severity length disease, though often much less they'd taken earlier.

Source: lots flu, supporting elderly family members live household Covid looks like I'll first recover. Two members household yet unvaccinated b/c they've young get it.

Question is, know 10-day period symptoms appeared around others. But, I'm taking care family members Covid, shower change clothes, still good around others? find guidance this. people end wearing masks don’t see not. meticulously crack window every hour exactly 10 min, course not. they’ll probably either crack window awhile better nothing.

Yea think people would. People crack windows bus time. enough education people would probably imperfectly.  replied someone said chemical formulas ivermectin mulpirnavir. blocked me. individuals 6.1 times likely get infected vaccinated people.

An infected person tested sent home work recover far less likely infect co-workers infected person tested continues work.  Testing helpful, vaccinations quickest easiest way improve workplace safety COVID-19.

You can't catch COVID-19 someone infectious, regardless vaccination status either person. 

You catch COVID-19 someone infectious, regardless vaccination status either person.

Thus detecting whether hazard present could introduced workplace (i.e., mandatory testing employees) makes sense health safety perspective.  anything ""good"" said come era COVID, FINALLY started investing public health way. deaths cases decline. 5 million reference WORLDWIDE one includes deaths vaccine. vaccine still scared might time stay home let people live lives. Government forcing private companies enforce vaccine mandate wishes insane government reach worth stop virus 99.94% world survived. I’m fully vaxxed way  Oh god, mRNA inside *right now*! attended college UC Berkeley; bad none stuck. Ah sorry confusion. Human cells indeed COVID-19 protease enzymes. Protease group enzymes cells use break things (think proteins, fats, sugars, etc). drug prevents COVID-19 (Sars-cov-2) using protease enzymes causing die. Since human protease enzymes different shape, effected. OK, like dozen different vaccines something like 3-4 different technologies used produce vaccines, include traditional methods. one vaccine COVID.

Well, know anti-vax types feel *diversity*.... considering also lot countries national healthcare aggressively get price everyone. America it'll big problem. say $700 per treatment easily jack price $70,000 per treatment there's nothing stop that. 85% vs 90% means essentially power, given sample sizes weren’t gigantic. Aaron Rogers lunatic. knew?   spouse ended getting pericarditis second dose Pfizer. He's worried thing happen son share genes. Son became eligible vaccine kids. I'm wondering likely outcome pericarditis something genes kind random one off? Son 9 almost 10. know seems effect young males women. Best username ever... Especially consider still deaths test group. efficacy preventing deaths might even higher 90%. perhaps hospitalizations simply extremely high risk people, morbidly obese extremely old immunocompromised. monoclonal antibody treatment free anyone wants it.  Trump thing. first two western vaccinations gain approval (in general, US) researched outside US, Trump claimed entire thing hoax promoted bleach cure.  take it? anything anti-vaxers proven they'll take medication except ones would actually help.  Yeah. annoyance-bordering-on-hatred antivaxx fucks extend wishing wouldn’t able get bailed magical antiviral pill. don’t wish death anyone, taking thing fact make difference, I’m it.

Rodgers raining NFL MVP, Packers aren’t going get rid star player this. I’m trying defend Rodgers since dumb move him. they’re going release permanently remove league this. That’s extreme overreaction minor public health safety measure. Since athletes supposed smart? dudes get hit head living I’m exactly surprised risk including active viral particle inactivated vaccine vanishingly small. think automatically makes mRNA vaccine safer. 

(not mRNA vaccines already perfectly safe.) viruses harder ""cure"" easier prevent (e.g. hep B) essentially ""hide"" cell. therapy cannot enter viral reservoir, can't kill replicating virus. viruses ""hide"" well (such hep C) destroyed. lots different reasons really (virus anatomy, mutations, replication rate, stuff know) different viruses respond antivirals vaccines differently think myth can't fight traditional small molecule applications viruses usually effectively combatted vaccines antibiotics tend useful bacteria. always case though (there's meningitis vaccine bacterial previously mentioned small molecule hep C cure) single simple explanation.

Somehow, ask: 

Are pills necessary fight virus, grow profit margins? Human cells multiple types proteases many different uses, different gaps. molecule Pfizer drug designed fit gap Coronavirus protease, fit human proteases, viruses matter. limit knowledge topic tho, take word fact. Even came after, terribly upset first group get it. said, I've 3rd Pfizer shot 2 weeks now.  Me. felt like crap second dose booster sore arm. trying funny. Trying understand big picture end result. Except cases UK elevated months now, hospitalisation rate nowhere near winter peak, you’d expect high levels vaccination. trend established elsewhere. would take digging, actual full sequences published Pfizer Moderna vaccines. Someone linked paper full sequences month ago. spike sequence identical, ends different.

Edit : you, it? Maybe, think we’re past phase mass fear pandemic. Maybe require positive test offer rapid tests site case person hasn’t tested positive yet. don’t want limit access much time crunch. Monoclonal antibody treatment quite bit expensive.

1. stuck working high risk enviornment, dealt increased stress, increased risk, either got sick saw people know get sick, increasingly agitated customers/patients/clients, may may gotten extra financial support it. However, likely financial situation got much worse lost benefits. emotional health took major toll.
2. student, life changed substantially. Social interaction changed heavily, work life (if one) became far chaotic, entirely locked old cliques/social activities. Sports, events, meetups, gatherings, classes, extraciricular activities majorly disrupted least 6 months, full 18 months cases. good one's mental health matter slice it, even introverted type.
3. reckless type, people around became increasingly stressed agitated culture wars issues. People close may died, family may experienced serious setbacks COVID. Sure, might bear big chunk responsibility that, change fact life people would've also become chaotic filled disease, death, destruction, disruption, constant battle. good mental health either.
4. cautious introvert locked down, held 18 months watch world torn apart experience major setbacks. Global movements response caused lot chaos, US Europe.

Uhh... 1% Navy 3% Air Force thousands... (with Marines Army even higher % unvaxxed) horse ate vaccine No, overall. 67% overall fully vaxxed per RKI. Idk, wear anywhere accept public transportation. store said something would leave give business. part end madness. mean, show data, could different story, important note even emergency approval granted US, problem right Children safer many vaccinated adults. Zero concerns children based statistics I’ve seen them. story mention anything rates vaccination mask wearing, know say people described necessarily ""stupid"". CDC proven joke this, Apple's biggest company world, I'm sure looking data. parts India still success it? shilling it, curious. asking question way answer. take needle, got asked come work august year. 

The current situation mandates likely appearing soon means even started interviewing job, likely would never even make probation. I've keep busy now. someone think people hospitals? /s  oh well then, many us done part care anymore.  guess enjoy chicanery subterfuge. Actually didn’t want go impoverished third world child /s interesting. 

Those insanely good numbers. way media (both mainstream social media) portray it, makes sound like thousands servicemen women gonna getting discharged vaccine. I'm happy see good numbers. mention non story anyways, considering military shoots vaccines God knows basic intake pre deployment. Lol. Directly Unvaccinated people * 6.1x greater risk testing positive COVID-19 * 11.3x greater risk dying COVID-19 compared fully vaccinated people.

So greatly increasing odds getting vaccinated, still risk. death rate consider long covid effects.

Sure probability small, like chance getting car accident small. one accident without seat belt matter low probability is. (not boosted yet, soonish). Masks absolutely suck constant reminder much life pandemic sucked. hope so. know money everything them, even dead friend change mind. hard keep kids them, family all. Urgh. refuse wear one outside doctor’s office vaccines widely available months.

Or, know, days 11 years old. 

I much appreciate vaccinated people world wearing masks helped protect children last 6 months. know suck vaccines widely available (or foolproof) may think Red code means either already quarantined way quarantined.  told last month we'd comply OSHA, matter what, bc Medicare dollars. state argues irrelevant, Medicare huge revenue stream.

Plus, possible fines. got notifications soon OSHA announced today: better vaxxed.

(Not actually hopeful this, that's official company line.) way see we’re going exposed mRNA vaccine either Covid infection vaccine. Covid going become endemic - every human planet eventually going e posed it.

So either virus injects RNA cells vaccine. it’s vaccine it’s one small subset proteins body quash infection.

If it’s virus - sorts bad things happen.

I’m opting vaccine kids. see downside.  Even common side effect young people - myocarditis- far common infection vaccination. would feel need get 3 full doses regimen hasn’t studied recommended Yes, literally huge one done last 8-12 months. okay. feel like wait, wait.

Otherwise, go it.  Well think can't vaccinate 9 years olds country. even studies relating vaccinating children. team players. saving lives.

Wrong job.  Boosters Moderna half doses. immunocompromised people get third doses (full doses). doctor would know needs would advise get.

Neither one would problematic. Either, heck, *both* would safe. Vaccine dosage linear like painkillers drugs. prisoners US given *entire vials*, 7 doses, once, mistake, they're fine. virus naturally immunity right choose get vaccinated. Making decision allowed normal. don’t see choose get vaccine appropriate circumstances cannot without feeling alienated. 

Vaccinated unvaccinated spread virus. science drives decision making unvaccinated tested regularly major inconvenience. reality depends. depends country. countries/states/provinces treat COVID much seriously others. UK like 250 deaths day big deal x number cases. 

In country ppl get scared theres one case (some parts, pre-June). One Lockdown immediately. we're talking larger companies do-- mine employs ~80k people worldwide.

They provide tests free unvaccinated need test negative covid get temporary pass building, test good 3 days.

 Vaccinated employees show proof vaccine (just once) get permanent QR code security badge access building.

Regardless vax status, everyone get temperature scan admitted building fever can't come in.

Remote workers skip literally never come in, managers dictate person work based position. 

For whatever worth US company locations 90% vaccine rate. Hi, 75 year old mother got invite **Moderna booster** shot december.

She already got **2 Moderna shots (so fully vaccinated)** back May.

It's even possible gets **full dosis** instead **halve dosis** nomally used booster.

Now I'm worried getting 3th Moderna shot **completely safe** could much?

Are already many (older) people got 3 Moderna shots total? great news US military. we’ve never mask mandate flu season, mask mandate last years flu season due covid, led time record low flu season think we’ve never mask mandate flu season, go back old ways learn experience? People never wore seatbelts before, started wearing didn’t before? Maybe take opportunity realize masks flu season may better flu vaccine produce. single mask mandate ending kids enough time get vaccinated.

Kids 5 still can't get vaccinated. Based Pfizer said earnings call might another year yet kids 2. Awww yeah totally proud girls, too, grown up/mom/dad, making choice protect kids community. 🤗🤗🤗🤗 Well want booster. Exterior pest control/lawn treatment country literally compulsory covid vaccines. highest uptake western countries. 

Govt usually passes businesses mandatory plus vaccine passports make impossible get vaxxed. Supreme Court going throw mandate quick. Can’t tell do, identify donkey. Animals don’t need vaccinations.  truly believe masks thing next years, much like it.

I got fully vaccinated thought lifted mask mandates vaccinated people, telling vaccine works faith ability protect me. Reinstating mask mandates stab back vaccine protect enough, keep wearing mask add another shot yearly. think i'll boosters. Thank you! 75 degrees, thankfully waiting perfect Los Angeles weather. harder fully vaccinated older sister dragged along younger one. proud too. you’re normal It’s high impact though. you’re vaccinated relatively healthy going fine.  Let's make citizens sue businesses federal court think business noncompliant. citizen wins case, $14,000 them. Call bounty something. Seems legal. really.

You right basically theater *outdoor venues* (because outdoor spread rare, even big events) bars/restaurants (because people take masks eat). **But places fall neither category.**

I’m saying need mask mandates (either permanently). depends policy goal detailed cost/benefit analysis.

But let’s pretend people masking, possible, indoor, public spaces doesn’t slow spread. does. (I’m sure much care slowing spread ubiquitous vaccine available). actually passed what? hard time finding answer. state still 13% positivity rates climbing again. 😩 directly Would like name cities you’re talking about? They’re absolutely ever going away Wear one want. shouldn’t law everyone wear mask half year forever. Ahh Joseph Smith scenario lol. +1 sentiment find 'God-given DNA' bit oxymoron.

Me sitting home unvaccinated hurting anyone, there's path forward involve sitting getting poked. know that, kinda makes synonymous path forward. saddest part becoming politicized people going avoid regular vaccinations too? would huge backslide developed country tragic. Lol never going away. They’re required vast majority cities. certainly going phased time goes on. announced? I’m wondering quickly company communicate policy. assume they’ve kicking around plans since rule (if exact specifics) anticipated. kind regulatory board oversaw doctors conduct. Maybe look forming something like that. I'm proud little one! parent!  demanding high quality data seen bad thing? would vaccine sceptics say approval given quickly rare side effects occur. 

Because takes months data collected analyzed. meantime, breakthrough infections start happening more. people end dead maimed infections need happen.

It time needed regardless ""vaccine skeptics"" say.  parent. federal worker. care immensely. kids vaccinated equals fewer people act vectors covid. went reddit hospital covid instead treating ivermectin demanded sent home bunch sick burns.  Case numbers meaningless point.  scared needles. like one bit. could go more, hate needles enough give thoughts creep out.

That said, getting vaccinated wasn’t bad all. sore arm first time, got ass kicked day second time, needles weren’t issue all.

I wish things involving needles could easy painless.  think mean lower unvaccinated patients grateful treated medical professionals share similar views. ones clearly incompetent malicious. can't even make argument they're given inferior care less qualified providers.  Lol cuz majority us, get told something it, ones aren’t getting deserve kicked out. Working way remdesivir actually inspire confidence kidney damage increasingly associated it.

Don't get wrong, fully vaccinated healthy- healthy adults 65 ever recommended booster, I'll get one asap.

Im 20s good shape triple vaxxed. want wear one wear one. choice. got booster second day could, really quick, minimal side effects day. Super glad got way! cares? Well probably federal workers also parents. federal workforce largest single employer us, help logistics get lot kids vaccinated. also set standard, hopefully large employers still follow suit.

Additionally, giving workers time encourage workers go weekdays, rather overly crowded evening weekend appointments. 

This important since lot parents take extensive time recently schools closed minor illnesses like cough mean drs visits quarantining waiting Covid results. 

Personally, think every business this. “I don’t really want employer able this.”

Well, newsflash: employer always able this. could said “get covid vaccine you’re fired”. could said “as condition employment must provide negative measles test per week.” could also say “In order work to…” pretty much anything want. choice work work there.

Holy fuck, major news folks… holy fuck Thanks source. think found atleast something go boosters: discussion weighing risks benefits, CDC estimated among males ages 16-17 years, every million doses Comirnaty span year would prevent 1,540 COVID-19-related hospitalizations, may 73 cases myocarditis. males ages 18-24 years, figures would 3,150 39, respectively.” People reason way conclusion reasoning makes much sense sometimes. can't always wait research make decision. There's much research done, much time real world. I'd say reasoning/argument makes sense based things people miss able see, smart &amp; knowledgeable. There's difference predicting logic guessing blindly. Flair Central &amp; East Asia though. already know obesity diabetes correlate severe covid result poor diet. couples eat food. ohh didnt know moderna halved dose, thought 100ml compared 30 pfizer reason slightly better result anger thread top. One heavily upvoted comment almost wishing new variant emerges this.

I’m also veteran think it’s small subset probably good example. think lots veterans PTSD still could lose VA coverage though. argument fair people. Correct, another reason need robust testing infrastructure, e.g., cheap widespread antigen testing home every couple days. Even doctors accepting PCR ""gold standard"", positive antigen test strong sign start antivirals waiting PCR confirmation.  don’t see effective public health measure worst it’s waste time money. think yellow fever worse. kept cold fucker burnt going wouldn’t exactly call “good news.” pandemic doesn’t come control third doses, first doses. think is. haven’t actually able find data risks booster yet numbers look close original 2 shot numbers. statistics based comment Thomas Voigtländer, cardiologist Medical Director Bethanien hospital Frankfurt. risk given context covid infection. pointed towards isreal study biontech/pfizer.

I often dream eating food now. even taste certain foods.

But wake things different.

It's strange. Perhaps good. father leg blown vietnam. I'm also veteran. felt could relevant. certainly depend age Sure, people get ""like cold."" might even majority cases. Maybe even large majority them.

But guess what? still killed 700k people country. still wrecking hospital systems causing ration care utilize sorts ""surge"" support.

And happening even 20 months virus ravaging country 60% population vaccinated.

So, no, assessment ""it's like cold"" useful see actual damage here.

""Need"" funny word. need mRNA vaccine exactly? 

Because still needs get mRNA vaccine order best protect around him. that's ""need"" care about.  Ahhhh old Florida reporting method. nice! start eating horses now?  apply self inflicted aliments well?

I'm also going traveling said marathon getting booster makes sense.  booster vaccination policy Germany changed yesterday today. Previously, booster shots given people 70 (and maybe pre-existing conditions). Now, everyone get booster shots six months second dose.

It concerning watching incidence rise Berlin, today we're 180/100,000 particular neighborhood 207/100,000. Clubs open vaccinated people without mask requirement, vaccinated people transmitting virus. long clubs open people interacting without masks, virus incidence continue rise. wonder difficult/expensive manufacturer. 

Aka, price represent Pfizer trying make money/recoup research costs, complexity manufacturing cost drug itself?

If it’s former, expect it’ll easier convince donate/lower price less wealthy parts world. they're based solely case counts without context. [Show anyone hospitalisation trendline story *entirely* maybe, think that. many go Regeneron clinic. that's infusion. politics. best friends wife said kids allergist asked wanted Moderna. turned 7. friends wife proud son voicing opinion saying, ""Hell no"". told that's opinion, that's he's repeating it. can't tell piss off, mh opinion, teaching proper values. Like looking everyone. That's kids getting vaccinated. We're society together. wouldn't, maybe fact cases actually plateaued and/or slightly rising past couple weeks something it. excellent news 3 days symptom onset bit tight window.

Not really hard get pharmacy within three days symptoms. would link article heart disease? That’s problem. viruses testing infrastructure COVID. Finding influenza test turning around quickly typically challenge outside major metro areas, mentioned that's people even cared enough get diagnosis.

If maintain well-scaled COVID testing network, include at-home testing, telehealth visits nurse practitioner, physicians assistant, non-doctor medical professional prescribe drugs would sufficient. Look nation decent vaccination rates (Portugal, Cuba, UAE, Spain etc) figure that, yes, does. I'm ok this. shit ya may wrong, source tho thats dose comparison one place bc ive hard time finding one obviously confused significant difference. Almost none Delta ICU admissions deaths area vaccinated. Case load important hospitalizations/death rates significant proportion population vaccinated. Sadly probably feed conspiracy theories... assume you’re joking, legitimately shocked find vocal anti-mask group community (a church, 3k members) led pastor doesn’t believe Aids, frequently recently reaffirmed doesn’t believe aids, advised HIV positive men don’t need use protection spouses believes HIV doesn’t cause Aids. 

And yet, still large, vocal following. doesn’t seem like it’s prevented vaccination entirely? hundreds people dying country evwry day. without containement risk new variants appearing way higher. Thankfully vaccines treated three doses vaccines regain excellent efficacy spread. think lot people scared needles rationalize - even convincing - they're opposed reason. even mean fear pain prick, mean visceral reaction skin penetrated something injected inside. Everything we'd encounter nature bad. know ended regularly poked due medical issues, pretty serious aversion needles even though KNEW little pain involved. something freaked it. stop going things like flu shots rational brain lizard brain, always involved extreme spike anxiety. overly optimistic sensationalized title. There's certain time window needs taken in. think unvaccinated people going pop pill versus vaccine? lol, remotely offended change, think really weird hill die on. you? says nothing long covid, still apparently problem got 2 doses. There’s data boosters yet pills long covid’s really thing care single person. Took shit load shots deployment. Anthrax series super painful worse. 

There one created puss filled bubble upper arm like 3 days cant even remember lol

These people idiots. people talked work got two dose shot issues minor issues w/the first shot got knocked ass second. one guy work got booster got knocked ass w/the 3rd. Looks like someone’s good frictionless spring vacuum.  Get people vaccinated. things.

1. treatment way impact someone's decision get vaccinated. Tamiflu Xofluza zero impact importance getting flu shot new meds Pfizer Merck zero impact vaccine priority.

2. patients nursing homes/hospitals people closely monitor symptoms access treatments new meds lifesaving get quickly.

3. goes experience, average person, meds effective sooner take still shorten recovery time one two days even taken late. two different issues. Vax refusers discharged, period. Insubordination.

Veteran's benefits earned past service honored. anthrax vaccine exactly FDA approved (it approved cutaneous exposure inhalation exposure), 2004 federal court ordered anthrax vaccine made mandatory. FDA issued emergency use authorization vaccine protect inhaled anthrax, military's anthrax vaccination program resumed manner required consent receiving anthrax vaccine. vaccinated anthrax (and deployed) window, remember signing paperwork vaccine.

Still, even anthrax vaccine mandatory, still career consequences. People would put non-deployable status (and servicemember deploy get promoted favorable assignments).

And none applies vaccines full FDA approval. required, continue required. People refuse court martialed discharged. sounds like took small study bootstrapping replacement caused miserable week something I’d apt agree, feeling rough day year terribly troubling. understand everybody circumstances maybe can’t take easy day, maybe lasts longer day some, think vast majority people interested receiving booster, benefit far outweighs negatives.

Also fwiw, booster two days ago yesterday wasn’t great, would say 50% better day second dose. Perhaps diminishing side effects returns. 

All caveat it’s nowhere near given yearly boosters prove warranted, though it’s obviously well within realm possibility.   certainly issue vaccines, something need worry personal level. chance second dose like 1/10,000 chance third dose 1/50,000 (from Israel numbers). zero worldwide deaths three doses, number people 20s died covid 2 doses small zero, still positive individual benefit. course societal benefit large since unlikely transmit Delta third dose. per pill?

Few studies show vaccine effectiveness waning account I'm calling ""shadow immunity"" previous infections unvaccinated group.

If 100k vaccinated people 100k unvaccinated, consider 60k unvaccinated group immunity previous infection, math going make vaccine look good. Nope thats legit  Yep, 8 Billion doses administered worldwide. Insurance government subsidies bring price down. Remember thought we’d pay vaccine? die, course!  ""Real Definition"" I'm refering definition CDC changed better meet capability mRNA vaccine covid.  EU digital pass presented ID scanned venues.

Unfortunately estimate vaccination rates drastically drop. 
Everyone hesitating whether get vaccinated not, say get infected, would take drug need get vaccinated. issue lies idea we’ll ever “end covid.” Zero covid isn’t going happen. expensive US countries either subsidize cost completely cover it, country poor universal healthcare much anyway.  Lol. Trained physicist, working data scientist turned amateur epidemiologist modeling ""expert"" 2020.

Yeah, ok quick mock ups anything, devil truly details challenge knowing getting cocky Dunning-Kruger head space.

Now excuse me, spherical cows model. important point vast majority studies seem overlook (ignore?). understanding vaccines population fully vaccinated allow viruses adapt become resistant. Honestly I'm matter fact people give two shits actually ending covid.

That’s amount booster got approved moderna supply isssues doubt they’ll handing 100mcg doses third shot.. guess time tell. Currently around 8% new global cases worldwide happening UK. 8 globally total deaths. currently number deaths per day back first half March. 69% people fully vaccinated (not top 10 globally) Booster shots starting up. clear (at least me), means over. also clear long time vaccines straight forward route this. Inevitably, UK forced reinstate additional measures. Probably winter. People deluded think over.  I'm part Southern California dropped mandates 15 June. places, masking remained fairly consistently high, brief dip summer uptick arrival Delta. 

Depends context (area, type venue, target clientele) I'd say, general, 60%-80% people still masking indoors. (Myself included.) Among public-facing employees definitely 80%+.

About half people still wear mask nose though, kills me. choosing wear one, choose wear wrong?  thanks reply🧡 ""Real definition""? damage done. give bit fair credit preprint, like go arxiv publish whatever. far remember, need published already subject past n years, vetted someone has.

Disagree. thought test longer free would increase vaccination rate. didn’t help all… $700 per dose US 1.7 million dose order. Sounds like fair price halving death rate 14% 7% study showed. Probably cheaper UK due single payer setup, US numbers.

What's that, $10,000 per life saved according quick maths. Tell me, think $10,000 high price save life? *your* life worth less $10,000? families? Would kill random granny save taxpayers $10,000? Yes?

This concerns people acting like pandemic vaccinated. We've reduced mortality rate 70%. That's good. we're also satisfied endemic spread. People suggesting cases matter vaccinated die. 
So continue spread disease, even among vaccinated populations, that's still steady rate infection getting many thousands people every day. okay mortality rate approximately 30% originally was? 
 
I mean, cases *low* endemic, sure guess tolerable. we're going see flat even slightly positive slope daily cases graph.. sustainable.

That's what's insidious ""just asking questions"": makes people feel like _might_ risk, human nature throw hands up.  markets outside they? Surely good idea social, leisure activity that's outdoors, rather indoors. People going meeting anyway. want whine slippery slope nonsense then?

No issues actual policies save lives? think he's entirely wrong. got sick whole lot less last year almost certainly due masking/distancing. waiting booster, got denied, I'm Young healthy. Guess got corona today, fully vaccinated? 😒 They're really hung something blood. wild oral medications also end blood. not, ""long Covid"" refers lingering symptoms infection long virus eradicated body. Therefore, think benefits long Covid sufferers. doctor. J&amp;J absolutely kicked ass 36-48 hrs. feel great 36 hrs fell well enough place would've gone. would recommend government do? I’m curious would suggest I’d also like see numbers improve. go could stand behind this.  Ok? say anything numbers, motivation.  First doses *significantly* moreso.  study found Moderna booster 11% likely get infection, increasing 42% likely 6 months. 

Assuming booster brings back 11%, person booster 6 months quarter likely get infected someone isn't. 

Your choice that's worth you. longer wait, beneficial get booster. big part democrats support vaccinations mean trade crew job made 20+ good operators. I'd say majority take vaccine. imaging situation 39+ jobs have. looking individual job perspective (20 people roughly) seams reasonably. Presentation everything. Put tube, make “apple flavored” it’ll fly shelves. actually read Pfizer link: ""It could prescribed broadly at-home treatment help reduce illness severity, hospitalizations, deaths, well reduce probability infection following exposure, among adults. demonstrated potent antiviral vitro activity circulating variants concern, well known coronaviruses, suggesting potential therapeutic multiple types coronavirus infections.""

Right, get covid, take course pills slap about, making sure hospitals aren’t full.... that’s probably good thing, b. people get bad reactions flu shot far between. anecdotally speaking pretty much everyone know bad reaction least second covid shot. know anyone bad reaction flu shot. Def agree  CDC says 6 months   game changer. Oh yea, vaccine still must, least help I'm way. Flu shot, worst, makes feel like got bad night sleep. Nothing worse that. Covid shot made run fever good 24 hrs. planned lay couch watch Netflix even enough shape that. shivered burned slept. seem pretty intent throwing medicine cabinet despite antivax. know several deniers willy-nilly took animal version Ivermectin Hydroxichloroquin without prescription. understanding they're ride die symptoms appear. they'll take whatever can.  
  

Personally think success product solely rest much propaganda misinformation distributed. growth developing world china alone, they're fine, covid, rest economy Judging everyone spoke COVID, would sure take pill. See, issue want vaccine before... after, sure get desperate COVID... every single one them. fair, Trump tell people get vaccinated.

I doubt he'll since got booed it, say it. Speaking experience, symptoms usually hit hard hit fast. First day symptoms felt like regular cold. Days 2 3 felt like really terrible cold, definitely enough worried. think disease hit hardest either 5th 6th day. However, I'm young relativity healthy, Mom got absolutely wrecked virus. basically completely commission 2 days.  Almost 2 million per week still getting first shot US (that's approval 5-12 year olds). insignificant amount. BC idiots literally think vaccines work staying body forever, whereas pills go again.

They understand pills enter leave bloodstream like vaccines do, leaving behind reaction body. Right would simply raise starting salaries money would save requiring vaccination testing? also took Monocolonial Antibodies, isn’t offered people age group. 

Those restrictions apply commoners guess… 🤷‍♀️ right thing. plenty vaccine go around (assuming US). would consider eligible, ""care giver"" risk people. bad thing ask potential negative side effects? thank you. Sticking needle arm whether want violation bodily autonomy. Forcibly secluding society deliberately made choice violate social contract, also alternative vaccination offered them, merely necessary evil protect society dangerous lunatics. I'd curious see effectiveness co-administration strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. Correct I'm wrong, appears they're using ritonavir metabolic properties opposed antiviral. USAF Vet. command says ""You're getting vaccine"" got damn shot. Fucking flu shot knocked ass every damn year, GOT IT. None ""BUTMAHHRAAAAGHTS!"" bullshit   hard time believing 1000s highly paid people going walk away vaccinated giving homes, boats trucks lives this.

1000s cops threatening 30 went ahead it. 

Time tell.. I'll ignore transmission right know enough make proper answer, what?

You're going wait one shot vaccine? One already came - long term effectiveness worse multiple doses (shockingly). One shot vaccines rarity, even downright impossible. need boosters. always have.

They take little prick arm protect friends. 3 billion people jabbed least once. proper issues they'd glaringly obvious point. Fortunately Floridians, DeSantis zero control this. Florida federal OSHA jurisdiction, meaning enforce set workplace safety regulations. OSHA issue citations Florida DeSantis power stop it.

In states state OSHA, state agency required meet federal standards MINIMUM. positive tho?  sequel nightmare Every word response contradicted first sentence Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced investigational novel COVID-19 oral antiviral candidate,PAXLOVID™, significantly reduced hospitalization death, based interim analysis **Phase 2/3** EPIC-HR (Evaluation Protease Inhibition COVID-19 High-Risk Patients) randomized, double-blind study non-hospitalized adult patients COVID-19, high risk progressing severe illness. scheduled interim analysis showed 89% reduction risk COVID-19-related hospitalization death cause compared placebo patients treated within three days symptom onset (primary endpoint); 0.8% patients received PAXLOVID™ hospitalized Day 28 following randomization (3/389 hospitalized deaths), compared 7.0% patients received placebo hospitalized died (27/385 hospitalized 7 subsequent deaths). statistical significance results high (p&lt;0.0001). Similar reductions COVID-19-related hospitalization death observed patients treated within five days symptom onset; 1.0% patients received PAXLOVID™ hospitalized Day 28 following randomization **(6/607 hospitalized, deaths)**, compared 6.7% patients received placebo (41/612 hospitalized 10 subsequent deaths), high statistical significance (p&lt;0.0001). overall study population Day 28, deaths reported patients received PAXLOVID™ compared 10 (1.6%) deaths patients received placebo. actually quite people quit went testing struggling backfill positions. need new people apply many people feeling overworked. not, bc treatments work crucial give early possible.

Patients tend go doctor / hospital, till feel really ill - point virus already replicated exponentially, spread organs treatments inhibit replication come far late.

Vaccines way out, prevent severe illness first place. person wrong multiple claims one dangerous sorts people confidently wrong ""knows way you"" /r/medicareforall people highest risk severe outcome certainly would.

It’s cold expensive heat house open windows 10 minutes every hour weather cold. Wow thats lot 5 days  great example bullshit become accepted frequently cited fact. learned show dope sick, dramatized look long term development opiate crisis Purdue pharma's centrality it, frequently cited study pain management field turned letter editor doctor regarding small group patients hospital setting. doctor idea cited (as would expect written letter cited) horrified learn used. Exactly. Wonder anti-vaxxers equally opposed pill. Lol, doubt it. What’s point comment?   Yup agreed, even breakthrough can't vaccinated hopefully receive highly effective treatment. turned Anthrax still got benefits. Go figure Well court decides protection fully vaccinated person enough, government decide give booster instead sending lockdown (which do, still wait month 6 month interval, mind shortened 4-5 months). 

If there's pharmaceutical solution, definitely lot less invasive contact restrictions.

Also, three parties form government Germany legally end possibility lockdowns end month. Since majority parliament, done deal. normally open windows Christmas even Covid. House gets hot us dinner cooking. UK houses lot smaller USA think. house good retaining heat- good! Jokes them. Got J&amp;J Pfizer I’m like 200% protected. 

I’m literally one man gang immunity.  developed adults, especially 60+ wait longer pill kids.  Good luck , one person know 3 4 times senses came back, 🤷‍♀️. Worth shot least. treatments already, lol.  previous infection uncorrelated vax status, means half unvaccinated people previously infected.

We assume *is* correlated vax status, unvaccinated group higher levels natural immunity vaccinated group. Pandemic BTFO  But... but... fake happens me. serious! Monoclonal antibodies aren’t anti-viral.  pretty funny ngl Yes. Fact - Actually, immunity fade. Unlike Polio, who's mutations reduce effectiveness vaccine thus giving one lifetime immunity, coronavirus mutations will.

Opinion - Therefore, lifetime immunity may achievable one two even three shots. could take several human generations stunning leap forward preventing spread kill rate slows Polio rates.

Based humanity's resistance stunningly effective free vaccine, doubt species saved science.   video MedCram explains “booster” shots based current data.   benefits earned past service honored.

Depends discharge length service. awarded dozen Navy Crosses 20 years given Dishonorable Discharge whatever, none heroics matter get shit.   little, late. even walked back bit two breaths later. We've treatment works great. Monoclonal antibody treatment. 

Not saying Great news. saying treatment works widely available. issue study seem done high risk patients.

In Merck study, placebo group hospitalized 14.1%. Pfizer study, placebo group hospitalized 7%.

So either Merck study high risk patients, Pfizer study low risk patients. Something add here. Honestly, unless genuine medical issue, never excuse vaccines released general public. tried turning off/on again? Current Chinese economy bit rocks. Power shortages looming property bubble many, many property developers struggling. 

Have keeping Evergrande situation?  hope sarcastic. sounds exactly mouth breathers would say. continue complete opposite needs done help get pandemic better control continuing full hospital beds increase death count Covid. would say anything else it. Lol able enjoy short existence earth, even worst times, human right actually, whether want admit it. literally phase II-III results, phase I. Doubt care though. spreading nonsense everywhere. Lmao yes. sure that. Perhaps end pandemic since moving endemic phase. Saw story yesterday 60% deer area Ohio adjoining states test positive covid antibodies. Thus potential reservioir new strains.

Each year get new flu epidemics. strike early enough say Tamiflu yes alleviate symptoms yearly flu vaccine. far, US followed happened Europe. We're usually 8-10 weeks behind them...so right around holidays another rise cases. Imagine thinking viable solution lmao   Well duh... everyone wanted first shot got one. ones getting stragglers mandates get enacted. Meanwhile boosters new tons people hitting beyond 6 months want them. virus gives fucks feelings badly want return normal life

That ignores reality people going put indefinite mitigation matters, enough slack left keep it. Sure, COVID may care people's feelings, virus fatigue real compliance tank further. simply realistic expect people vaccinated continue abide NPIs real socio-economic externalities whose return diminishing rapidly. “do research” ivermectevangelist here. uncle Jimmy getting frisky chasing dragon? Also, three different vaccines, incoming. one work mean won't. thing vaccines work years even decades.

In general, every vaccine mucousal disease, ie. respiratory intestinal, wears much faster one systemic disease.

This also true natural immunity. reinfected cold virus every years.

We always knew vaccines last forever. hope several years.   Key words: exponentially proliferate, sudden, massive, short term increases. lot cheaper ICU bed ventilator support everything else happens afterwards, patient survives.    see point disagree well. would argue mandate vs mandate areas drawn along lines, place would reverse vaccine mandate pill never going implement mandate first place unless forced higher authority. Sure, flip-floppers *exactly* zero, would surprised percentage significant. Yes, *on top of* you’re describing. impression literally impossible create pill virus

Tamiflu probably well known pill virus. FDA approved since 1999. Well no, they'll keep buying horse paste vet. really worried people contract covid survive facing 2024? medicine carries risk unknown? Also monoclonal antibodies experimental. Imagine thinking anti-vaxxers take pill actually works Wait Q2 specifically ? really enjoy wearing mask places I'm definitely paranoid side, 100% agree you. stop 'punishing' vaccinated people. side, wish people would stop bad attitudes people want wear masks! Thank providing super geniuses great opportunity research.  almost like novel virus pandemic rapidly changing situation. whoda thunk there’s long incubation period asymptomatic spread. isn’t much evolutionary pressure get weaker less severe aforementioned viruses.

I doubt there’s good articles it, feel like it’s likely mutate something worse something less deadly dangerous. parts conjecture. Tony Fauci smart smart smart. Rand Paul dum-da-dum.  kid turns 2 January I'm really hoping get extra shot birthday present. would bet vast majority people getting first shots people due outside pressure, like risk losing job, loved one get sick enough finally allocate one brain cell COVID couple seconds.

Moderna booster, felt nothing except sore arm day got it. bar eligibility low. January/February supplies low. taking someone else getting one. places booking appointments week.  I’m thrilled regarding development, truly believe Merck halt pandemic. said: people refuse vaccine avoid Covid line pill hospital admission. FREEDOM crowd employs gold medal-worthy mental gymnastics regarding topic, bode well future pandemics/ disease transmission.

Yes one rarer side effects, second person I've talked experience. bday party next day host made thing rum punch something I'm drinking glass I'm like hell put pepper got bunch weird looks. Honestly, someone legitimately **IS** high risk group, getting booster hard. supply clearly there, unused. would say go it, shots actually people's arms, better are. start long lines again, would hold wait higher risk groups get theirs.

Right shot either going you, sitting freezer, going garbage. ""taking someone else's shot"" speak.


Disclaimer: lawyer and/or professor ethics. That's like, opinion, man. want pay exorbitant markup Ivermectin, though! Pfizer vaccines distributed worldwide, I'm sure they'll figure distribute pills well. Everyone wins pandemic defeated fully. Oh I'm sure authors clear things resubmit paper using correct data -- say comes exact conclusions. We'll hold breath then, long. There's large group people America alone can't work home. Teachers, police officers etc. Mind mandated government ordinance. that's happening soon enough. even New York.  Need cheap home tests, together, means better delta strain, covid March.

We already track anyone world wants vaccine one then, add in, far get. J&amp;J originally got Moderna booster, cause shown much higher immunity response another booster. arm sore first day, felt nothing else. Ivermectin produced several companies price relatively cheap. There's ton money made medication itself, except unscrupulous pharmacists/pharmacies gave filling exorbitant markup.

I've reported one state board expect anything come since 3 months. HIV antiviral Ritonavir expensive, brand name drug administered via infusion, only

That's correct. Ritonavir available tablet form that's take new Pfizer drug. 10 tablets Ritonavir 20 tablets Paxlovid 5 days, home. wonder there's social anxiety aspect well. I've heard people online say like masks easier mentally go day public know nobody see face - certainly agree extent somebody mild-ish social anxiety. 
 
People social anxiety way, way, way overrepresented online spaces obvious reasons, could help explain disconnect people say online vs. actually happens mask mandates lifted (everybody immediately ditches them) makes curious. months ago (I vaccinated April) eating sprinkles (like ice cream) tasted like pepper. one else family said tasted way. wonder could side effect vaccine. seems faded now. Agree though, would take food tasting peppery alternative. :D starting feel hopeful again. watching Europe bracing it. Yes, it’s related MHC (major histocompatibility complex), people tend attracted people dissimilar MHCs. US already Delta outbreak though. average 5,047 cases day last two days. MI still trending up. 

For context state numbers reports last 5 Fridays:

10/1: 2,597/42 deaths

10/8: 4,205/82

10/15: 8,297/104 case avg.: 4,149

10/22: 7,505/118 case avg.: 3,752

10/29: 8,078/122 case avg: 5,047

If look state Michigan's covid map, see upward trend continues urban rural counties. Here:  Valtrex herpes? Remdesivir Covid (not pill still)? Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxelapervir Hep C (literal cure)? ARVs like abacavir HIV? Calling State Farm,, want Rogers rate longer! live US, can't afford house, can't afford healthcare, etc.  don’t find amusing odd 3% CDC staff 50 y/o opted jab ? guess origin suspected ""Man made""(lab leak).

So suggesting targets specific genes, case South Asian gene,makes look little disturbingly like bio warfare. Weird way view struggling communities losing foothold they've gained.   Lmfao dipshit. Monoclonal antibody treatment possibly saved life. definitely cured extremely ill fine 48 hours.  sick get bed. wife quite sick worked aswell.  problem half extended family doesnt trust vax either, even lot got vaccinated initially arent going get booster gossip misinformation :(   already advocating ivermectin lol change anything  Pfizer needs create shell company sell name like Fluxamine Kapacitarcin, start couple rumours covid forums antivaxers lap up. stop giving fucking hospital beds Ah really hope so!! It’s interesting treatment 30 pills 5 days much body altering one two vaccine doses Possibly behavioral, possibly neurotransmitters. know they've fully explored why, know mental health conditions sharply increase risk death covid. Schizophrenic people die rate surpassed elderly, example. People said ""now [newest anti-covid thing exists] go back lives cares crazies"" every new development, think right one. Well that's FDA review is.  anything? Retrovirals probably much better treatment antibody treatment. took once, children came H1N1. went direly ill (104 fever) completely fine matter three hours less. single mother, profoundly helpful enabling care sick children. astounded. seen practice though. places good vaccination rates raw case level also low, suggests unvaccinated people giving majority case numbers well. idea rampant case numbers they'll completely decoupled hospitalizations imagination far tell, never actually observed. got vaccinated six months ago made appointment yesterday couple days get mine. He's refusing get his. Ars says multiple people newly diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 high risk developing severe COVID-19 enrolled trial No. sounds like right numpty. reason why? much false misleading vague non-specific. isolated, quarantined twice grid, nothing lifestyle changed.  Dude, realize people truly help family becomes much liberating. suppose honest includes proofreaders either don’t bother looking data given one two hours true. still total incompetence. noticeable drop population noticeable communities, depending whether mean 4,000 dying day 900,000 total deaths rather 240,000 reported. hope sarcastic. Well that's tough shit them, it? try go head-to-head physics, willl loose every time.

These kind people would house parties Britain WWII expected turn lights bombers see targets.

Sorry see happening, pattern eerily similar time last year. there's one bright spot, places relatively high caseloads rose summer never really tapered seen dramatic increases deaths far.

None. Nucleoside inhibitors approved daily use pregnant women.

The real risks typically kidney damage osteoporosis. shocking number people understand matters.

Close half population infected. Assuming previous infection uncorrelated vax status, means half unvaccinated people previously infected.

That gives unvaccinated people immunity, amount time.  (This *not* controversial point also *not* good reason someone previously infected remain unvaccinated).

**If correct this, vaccine efficacy appear go people infected, since efficacy calculated comparing infections vaccinated people unvaccinated people.**

In fact, limit everyone vaccinated infected, previous infection provided amount immunity vaccination (it probably provides less), vaccine efficacy appear *zero*. Yet, vaccine scenario still, reality, super effective. (If vaccinated group previous infection magically become unvaccinated, would much higher risk infection). Watched documentary last week observed mutation rate Covid-19 gone due better replication. virus made per infection increase observed rate mutation.

People pushing vet access to. Lots counties would needed mobile deep freezers distribute Pfizer Moderna.

Folks get boosters. Public health officials scientists mostly agreed pandemic masking social distancing still important even vaccination. stuff political.

source: biomedical scientists freedom choice military. told that's Yeah, “live it” means living people dying, old sick. still yet see repeated COVID infections body. local orthodox church saying congregants too.

Everyone shoring around vaccines. dermatologist specifically said come routine checks. things I'm concerned about. ...and still hurtful people syndrome, example, families. Well stated! get it! ust fyi theres difference two boosters. original moderna double dose pfizer (of thing) moderna booster half dose pfizer booster third full dose - confused looking bc like got 2x pfizer thought moderna booster would better Actually, satan angel fall read somewhere name fall Lucifer god’s favorite. 

So biblical connection it’s wild associate Latin word roots enzyme.

Just thought world couldn’t get stupider. People live HIV 40 years spread it. I’ll take COVID. Trump scientist........ got hit pretty hard second Moderna. got booster pharmacist asked side effects two shots. told sore arm first one, got knocked second one, seemed hopeful would milder symptoms third. I'm sure basing anything, way telling patient worry. 

Either way, still flu like symptoms booster, much less severe second shot, like third maybe half bad. got booster evening, next day work, able show morning work full shift.

I'm fully vaxxed get booster I'm almost tempted say I'm meant continuing WFH! troops follow order charge machine gun nest, take vax? It’s meaningless look risk reduction hospitalization low risk patients, chance hospitalization much lower.

If you’re looking trying make COVID disease never overwhelms health service, number reported exactly number matters. Omg mean Pfizer sells pills made Pfizer? *WTF wrong world?* million......that's really much dent yet. hope right, think may get shock. people move indoors due weather, virus spreads more.

At least one induce mutations. I'm Florida, expect Desantis fight tooth nail this. Anyone saying guy ""nothing"" Covid misinformed; he's tireless zealot comes Covid fight. Unfortunately side Covid, still (almost) respect doggedness super-villain kind way. 


One potential downside me--will company end work home everyone vaccinated? :)  Time get another job so, intention commuting back crappy open office.  ""Open collaborative!"" No, loud distractive utterly without even privacy old-school cubicles.

The problem still take hospital beds ultimately get severely ill. they’d stay home live consequences I’d it, don’t. important thing they're driving overcrowding hospitals primary care, results unnecessary deaths many go untreated catch serious illness that's treatable caught early. 100% us vaccinated, vaccinated would driving spread, matter nearly much vast majority develop serious disease die. people get vaccinated, see vaccinated breakthrough cases reinfection, spread vaccinated, helpful keep playing ""who's spreading it"" (though vaccinated high viral loads shorter periods time, likely spread less), metric longer matters group needs convinced, matters explaining they're delaying return ""normal"" harm others, including healthcare workers pointed out. Yes understand that. going open windows it’s cold and/or storming outside 10 minutes every hour company? don’t think it’s realistic. vaccinated? dad vaccinated? live area lot active Covid cases? *Despite* extreme safety measures, White House Press Secretary Pskai contracted COVID. someone wants lock time *they* think safe come out, need stop let them.

Already recommendation independent Data Monitoring Committee consultation U.S. Food Drug Administration (FDA), Pfizer cease enrollment study due overwhelming efficacy demonstrated results plans submit data part ongoing rolling submission U.S. FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) soon possible. That's realistic point view, can't eliminate endlessly mutating virus unless vaccinate 100% world population (not possible), quickly (not possible), 100% effective vaccine (does exist yet). DeEP sTaTE!!!!1! going back further, Wakefield's fraudulent paper linking vaccines autism Follow money.

This argument never made sense.

Is new drug sale yet? 

Why sell both? Bayer still sell aspirin.

Sell ivermectin container load 18 months new drug shown effective (if even effective) wait approved (if ever), sell ivermectin new drug.

If ivermectin effective, merck capability make anyone else, makes financial sense make much sell pandemic full boil.  Yeah, mean I'm still keeping half eye NY Times tracker map looks like there's bit Delta bloom happening western US now, southeast past Delta, boosters, kids get vaccinated, etc. reason keep mandates around much longer. “Be careful reading health books. may die misprint.”

Well course say works think works? Literally every company selling anything say that. Pfizer say data back claim - data sent FDA FDA decide whether data valid. really don’t see issue?  laughing fact Person says Person A's drug effective, rather independent third party. course Pfizer going say works lol.

From said independent board experts monitoring clinical trial recommended study stopped early drug’s benefit patients proved convincing.

Also press recommendation independent Data Monitoring Committee consultation U.S. Food Drug Administration (FDA), Pfizer cease enrollment study due overwhelming efficacy demonstrated results plans submit data part ongoing rolling submission U.S. FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) soon possible.

Either way, bring antivirals!  lot people view masks less tool keep us safe tool act superior. don’t want give up.  be. always been. one this. That’s exactly vaccines work. Every shot increase durability antibody memory response. don’t need boosters every year diseases low mutability. issue sacrificed durability speed terms dosing interval. future, vaccinate children grandchildren, likely 3-4 dose initial regimen followed booster every several years perhaps every year 65+ coincidence?  coincidence?  still dont understand got downvoted. guess question leading idea sort conspiracy got downvoted?  huge.

AfD lost seats last election September partly due covid stance. Also they’re like 5th popular 6 parties Bundestag parties refuse work wouldn’t say they’re force reckoned right now. not, stupid.   Yeah right this.
I thinking antivaxxers, since clog hospital beds, making life dangerous everyone.

With big effect. actually similar medications like tamiflu ageist flu, *very* effective preventing flu deaths despite treatment see lot flu deaths every years.


Goes little like this:
Day 1 - throat little sore - allergy
Day 2 - damn allergies year
Day 3 - runny nose, little cough - okay I'm feeling good, minor cold
Day 4 - fever sets - maybe cold, let get test case
Day 5 - oh, I'm positive COVID, I'm feeling pretty good, need see doctor
--------- LATE ALREADY
Day 6 - difficulties breathing, let's go see doctor
...


Add little bit ""COVID hoax"", ""let immune system designed for"", ""let's try homemade quinine first"", ""the hospitals kill people protocols"" mix get dead patient, despite wonderful pill. vaccine provides 100% immunity diseases. Sorry someone misinformed you. Vaccines manage spread degree infection. 

It's way someone may die car accident wearing seat belt, hell higher chance survival wear seat belt. Right average 12 unvaccinated deaths every ONE vaxxed death.

Living different worlds. wasn’t serious answer. That’s gonna dawg. Lol earth anything patriarchy toxic masculinity That’s they’d say. took vaccine I’d use pill got sick. Good luck them. Hope continue ivermectin, Zyrtec vitamin isn’t shortage new pills. even know what's it!! also gives massive hard-on. honestly that’s okay considering much cost getting hospital lol think maybe cause test themselves? peace mind someone shoving random liquid arm prepare. That's mindset imo, mine, I'm vaxxed lol. Like physical hands something ingesting might give lot people ease mind. could wrong.  empathize egg allergy falsely told ingredient would affect him. However, don’t go online! Talk doctor. walk ingredients concerned. one conversation doc earlier could completely altered health. description seems like expect side effects doesn’t really seem like something would grab pharmacy use yourself.

Very good news I’ll wait details. likely issue type treatment. molecule specifically built interfere sars-cov-2's protein. kill things. 

This (semi) cured HIV. Excellent! great coverage Vacc plus remainder able move pandemic far sooner. Finding someone legitimate religious exemption vaccine one killing people tough find. good day planet...... human industrial progress destruction Actually, no. nutters currently claiming pill actually Ivermectin new name. is… really stupid, least means willing take it. orders magnitude easier distribute poor countries, need cold storage, medical professionals administer pills. basically becomes “here’s pills instructions, call symptoms get worse.” Uh, anecdotal part, anti-vaxx laws this. wild two reasons:

1. level vitriol Pfizer palpable (agree tad they’re profiting vaccine it’s really non-issue ultimately)

2. scream vaccine still untested load equally dumb shit got excited this. 6 months. honestly surprised wiped booster. may even worse second dose! kinda think right. taken anti-science cohort proof Ivermectin perfect cure, repackaged big pharma collaboration FDA make money. get booster nearly everything. Even overweight (not even obese) qualifies booster.  I’m fully convinced mask mandates permanent. don’t see reason believe otherwise.  General other-than-Honorable, sure. Think read somewhere recently servicemembers denying vaccines would given standard Veteran's benefits, that'd imply other-than-Honorable. 

Dishonorable Discharges given result Court Martial. Nobody getting Court Martialed refusing vaccine. idea insurance companies government heavily subsidize new drug. 

If not, new brand name drugs typically expensive structure many health insurance policies many people could benefit drug able afford it.  No? DONT WANT problem engineers. get comfortable working medium people serious (and simultaneously irreverent) forget people outside field might object naming conventions. awkward conversations luddites reconfigure daemons operating system.

It's I've always said - never let engineers talk customer. think people follow measure? People won’t wear masks going open windows 10 minutes every hour winter? ""UK bad, UK collapsing"" popular narrative international media love push moment, various reasons. inside UK, bizarre read daily stories people live telling I'm living Mad Max things just... fine? 
 
The idea ""uncharted waters"" absolutely moronic we've already lived winter Covid... except without massive advantage vaccines. choose wear want, requiring needs end. unvaccinated patient still develop natural immunity receiving meds? Far right pundits. Hahaha love Atlantic accurate. areas majority vaccinated, true?

I mean, going see uptick first shots 5-12 get them. huge, saw several parents losing mind outside school upset school might vaccination day students get vaccine - many parents associate desperately trying get kids first wave shots, remarking plan wait two weeks see us deal providers prepared want streamline take kids. ""For livestock use only"". It’s super simple measure. People moaned masks guess people learn new stuff. don’t understand defeatist attitude. Ugh drives nuts  would stop taking claim sort microchip braindead conspiracy made decision almost data Provincetown Bear Week outbreak. Precautionary principle.

Same shit happened recommending masks. I'd say high risk based people live with. Even weren't, lie get booster. zero qualms lying get mine saw CVS appointments every time days days. keeping anyone else jeopardize other's health CDC wanted wishy washy.  booster works people ""high risk jobs"" means works everyone.  Go get boosted people protect family government bureaucracy never will.

(also, CVS least checked jack shit. Click box says eligible online good go.) I'm aware of, get really sick February 2020 tested negative flu assumed nasty cold. impression literally impossible create pill virus ig I'm scientist know shit Genau. high incidence rate Bayern life pretty normal business bouncing back . need lockdown 
. yes vaccinated got 3rd month ago.

People moved on. Life go

Excuse ? ""Do research"" code ""I people TikTok tell to"".

As opposed enlightened among us people *Reddit* tell us to, glass house I'll throw rocks want to!    \~1200 participants clinical trial Pfizer antiviral pill vs. \~43000 Pfizer COVID vaccine. seems like ""small study"" too. natural selection fella needs day off. pulling overtime year half already issue much antivaxxers taking hospital beds, antivaxxers taking hospital beds point hospitals capacity people died treatable ailments, cancer screenings postponed, surgeries postponed etc.

We surges cases ""self inflicted"" ailments stemming things like obesity, smoking, risky behavior, etc suddenly fill hospitals capacity. However, someday covid hospitalizations relatively low number, ""taking hospital beds"" point issue.

I think interesting people take ""rushed &amp; untested vaccine"" somehow take anti-viral pushed onto market. Either way, whatever works get us side pandemic. catch COVID shot? (Including months before) Honestly? always mandatory vaccinations, either something like Italy France health pass. vaccinated, recovered tested allowed work, others aren’t. opinion that’s way boost vaccination rates  vaccinated, severe breakthrough infection happen mostly old, sick immune disease take drugs reduce immune response. would normally attentive symptoms get tested rapidly.

So vaccination treatment, make Covid death preventable. end Covid death sure, like someone killed car crash get ejected wearing seat belt, preventable death. math... Brings fatality near 0% chance even catch symptoms severe enough hospitalization.

Such welcome news data proves accurate.  Right, thanks clearing up. 

Maybe pfiser could track one specific symptom though? know couple people still can’t smell taste 8 months later. That’s clearly psychosomatic.  understand it, yes, they're targeted protease inhibitors, sort used HIV drugs. long mandated shoved throats safety? 

Can’t wait. 

“YOU DIDNT TAKE COVID PILL KILLED SISTER!! 👿👿👿” atheists foxholes, why.  Patriarchy, toxic masculinity, penetrative aspect. Got Pfizer booster yesterday. Reaction much less first two shots (probably less last flu shot). considering playing recreational league volleyball game tomorrow, initially almost certain miss. read ""there people interested booster total number people gotten first dose overall.""

Cuz I'm dumb.

Get booster, lucky Americans. something irregular happening, pretending happening make go away. would backtrack testing regulations make instant antigen tests free throughout country. Scientists need keep close eye hospitalization death rates, tend lag behind rising infection rate ~3 weeks. hospitals fill people die high numbers, restrictions come back. Unusual times call unusual measures, dancing club without mask human right necessary risk spreads disease.  vaxxed? 

If get treatments 90% effective even high risk...

90% protection vaccines + 90% protection pill like.... Insane. reduces like 5% .55%? Ah, think that. Makes sense. no, meant: someone gets covid takes pill, maybe much lower chance long covid, virus didn’t cause much damage body. 

Idk, I’m hopeful! wait studies come Choose throw molotov cocktail someone's window? Breakthrough infections make approach pretty much guaranteed fail court. doubts 2G stand long given that, too. political appeal obvious majority seems back it, legality seems extremely dubious best. Imho would mistake plays hands anti-vaxxers importantly far right persecution complex. Now, get wrong here, I'm playing hardball. Mandatory vaccination way go. There's legal precedent (for example, small pox 1983), clearly called raise questions fairness not, contrary, way end needlessly prolonged debate, boon itself. pandemic, though, obviously still biding time. Vaccines, least type viral infections, can't solution. give us time develop better medications actually cure. mean entirely justified called for, expectations management obviously important. Frankly, especially face stances like yours. vaccinated equate getting free pass, still must subject rational risk evaluation, again: breakthrough infections thing, therefore restrictions protect cannot get vaccinated valid reasons need apply everybody still.  certain point let people live lives risk. sucks decision. Way better. wait symptoms show up... Huge deal. probably will, probably won’t. subreddits tend pretty anti-vaccine, always take look folks’ reactions there. 

This still good news regardless, we’ve told since vaccine rollout still abide Covid restrictions people can’t take vaccine, vaccinated people non-zero risk transmitting virus. another safety net may allow us lives back. people willingly putting risk catching transmitting Covid longer major danger anyone themselves, remains little reason continue indefinite Covid restrictions. Still great news  decrease transmission worth it. Especially [40-63% decrease depending one two infectious strain known. Exactly. There's excuses treatment real deal. want get vaxed? Fine, pill treat get infected.

Don't want pill? Well that's refusal care choice. RIP guess.  Merck’s stock going down?

If memory correct Merek’s pill 50% effective given 3 days infection. 

89% effective 3-5 days symptoms much better! kidney failure know number people got COVID vaccinated, none hospitalized. couple weeks ago bad case norovirus, fever, vomits, diarrhea… lasted couple day, everyone family got it. pleasant ? No. freed disease. really don’t think it’s sustainable keep wearing masks social distancing forever (it’s going away).  here: ""Based know, think social media companies should….? 
"" section, 53% (blue) vs 47% (orange) looks reversed.  Half Moderna still almost double Pfizer. Whether that’s better settled, sayin. people may even prefer lowest dose get.  Completely disagree. think kids take masks they're suddenly mentally healthy. tbf reason slow eligibility requirements nothing point Agree transmissibility higher cold, symptoms hand rarely are...again statistically speaking.  
On certain level people still need realize natural selection ever going process dampen technology shines less less every decades. thought therapeutics general. couple anti-virals flu, get used tiny percentage people people hunker home get sick. couple days decide go see doctor may take couple days get appointment. may get positive test prescribed. go get -- may may stock.

Therapeutics work best Day 1. Day 5 virus huge head start. medical system designed responsive. US donate 500,001 now. really rare like getting struck lightning? vaccines take last much longer this?

Disclaimer: idk means maybe I'm misunderstanding point lol That’s hypothesis, perhaps likely, nobody knows sure juncture. more=better, halved moderna booster still almost double Pfizer.

But agree, whatever’s available two good, would follow cdc guidance stick already possible.   Oh absolutely agree. Masks required London Transport bus train operators, understand compliance patchy would good reminder.

I guess focusing additional risk Christmas socialising different generations get together. got flu nieces couple Christmases ago, know prime time leurgys spread. literally said “I can’t wait” Ignoring politics, wonder see pill temporary vaccine permanent? one thinks twice popping pill seems like appropriate response illness deem insignificant. disagree 100%, mental gymnastics made.  Fair enough.

I'm engineer, write papers. Reddit hug death said Merck one too. know, anyway? geniuses RESEARCH really know going on. ITT: concerning amount unironic forever maskers people claim “don’t really exist” We're fine ffs, even R number dropped flu season. dont get articles dont take actual situation account? got Moderna booster J&amp;J early April. feeling pretty vulnerable I'm happy let us mix shots. wishing death people? ever tried go gym workout mask? don’t want see friends smile again? don’t want eat restaurants winter? don’t want able scream sing concerts?

Sounds like pretty damn sad life me. 

Masks comfortable always meant temporary. Facial expressions part human communication. It’s radical admit that. Sometimes people believe data says wrong change data. Maybe wanted heroes “they gut instinct” thanks writing way dumbass like understand it. think made feel lot less stressed this. effective writer!! cheers Oh worry, I've seen posts recommended Twitter algorithm assuring new drug mostly Ivermectin repackaged sell money. Luckily I'm American live somewhere sensible healthcare policies.   car accidents don’t stress healthcare systems literally ration care tell people need minor surgeries chemo need wait majority (90% more) unvaccinated covid patients stop taking resources. doesn’t matter it’s “just cold” (which it’s already that) way transmissible. That’s problem whole pandemic, majority cases mild even asymptotic, spreads rapidly % require hospital care happens few% massive amounts people. UK recently started vaccinating kids 12-15 year olds getting one dose. Yes, perhaps 69% close top globally, essentially everyone 50 got vaccinated matters way more. Saying booster shots starting stretch - around 8 million given country less 70 million. I'm sure think additional measures needed. modeling predicts way less hospital capacity used last winter. UK willing cope level pressure hospitals, incomparable extremely bad flu season, measures need come back. antivaxxers ask medicine either sick right? tested well, know long term effects. :) Damn man, know wearing piece cloth face could stop living normal life, sounds pretty sad you. Well leads antivaxxers taking pill great got Moderna shot #2 back around May 15, get third shot? I'm hearing six months sources, eight months others. say hope new strain? said true, people going keep spreading become vaccine resistant we'll square one. pills readily cheaply available, 

Ya, like ever going happen. expensive af.

-An American ""Why would get vaccinated? I'm healthy! Medication sick people.""

I honestly think that's least part mentality. that's case, decent number might willing use pill getting sick, would good, still frustrating get vaccinated. pound cure worth ounce prevention, apparently.  Covid ends stalling past half-century growth convergence developing world it’ll sad day. yearly booster one thing. yearly booster makes sick 24-36 hrs another thing. get flu shot every year. might feel bit blah next day that's it. function 90% well 100%. yearly covid booster knocks ass day half something I'm excited about. I'm sure I'm one boat.  


I mean still basically blip. 
Statistically.  
I guess shit taught school.  
If 330mil samples 700K lets say 1mil put favor become infected/altered via scientific experiment would considered outlier. literally 0.3%.  
How MATHAMATICALLY insignificant whole population? 
Explain numbers feelings, hate use brain debate heart.  allow others replicate mRNA vaccine already created another pharmaceutical company 

Sorry that's research, that's asking decades worth grueling research knowledge, expertise manufacturing processes free,, funded tax payers EU/UK/US. Open source mean world also contributes hardest part discovery phase, requires lot funding, decades worth effort plenty times leads where. remain confused stuff. got infected March 2020. got J&amp;J March 2021 terrified needles. I'm told need get another shot either Pfizer Moderna? mean I'll need another shot 8-9 mos?  Access would database software.

Oh god, gave horrific memories going go cry shower. Thanks.  Seriously. take mask go around apartment building, subway pain ass. think another lockdown unlikely. Hospital ICU numbers still quite bit away peaks earlier year hospitals back totally overwhelmed like countries.

Those end hospital especially ICU mainly unvaccinated people. think happen is, restrictions unvaccinated people, example can't go Christmas markets even current negative test. Hopefully convince least less hardcore antivaxxers get vaccinated. ""normal"" idiots people strict anti vaccine doctrine. realistic people get time? article says needs taken within 5 days start symptoms. people usually bad enough point go in? There's going scaling price depending wealth countries. still enough evidently matter?
If enough anti bodies worries reinfection. vaccine good enough make immune. conclude vaccines alone insufficient contain Delta variant, people maintain non-pharmacological precautions mask-wearing, eligible booster shots get promptly.

Why still obsessed containment? Everyone going get COVID point; goal hit health system. *Vaccines proven job this*. immune system reacts strongly ""fake"" virus, mean immune system super *not* terrible? engineer, want say seems careless less sciencey make assumptions

Our world runs assumptions.

If quickly throwing together power supply test, I'm really much math experimentation. pick handful parts throw small ritual summon gods engineering grant bountiful electron harvest.

If fails, I'll sacrifice art student try again.

It's things work Anyone else constant edge anxiety/panic feeling COVID? I’m scared mean directly caused Covid? I’ve always general anxiety it’s constant roof panic attacks. Covid actually cause that? Smoking, obesity, excessive drinking ""put extra strain hospitals""... endemic... call strain ""revenue""   I'm sure elsewhere, but, least US, unvaccinated also tend cluster together, like given group people 80% immunity 20% vulnerable; like, given group unvaccinated people, strong majority vulnerable. say is, personal experience, still rules place, nobody cares nobody enforces anything

been places advocated remaining covid rules place end nobody gave shit Holy strawman batman! never said every single person taxed exact income. that's boogeyman want tilt windmills at, go it. Comparing hospitals March 2020 irrelevant proves ultimate point. Chicago currently mask mandate benchmarks removing “wait see” we’ve completely stable situation nearly entire year? That’s using emergency powers there’s emergency. completely eliminated, high vaccination rates seeing tens thousands cases day like many places now. vaccine seem reduce transmission noticeably - likely large case numbers see places like US mostly coming virus hitting big clusters unvaccinated people.  ""Now Viagra!""   breakthroughs! vaccine produces double antibodies average getting disease real.  Obviously can’t know sure. right process putting together thesis research paper, ever see data point identical another always check it.

I can’t even show Professor data without checking first know fact immediately hone data points top other. 

Best case scenario extremely negligent, worst someone fudging data get recognition/publication. 

We never know biomedical field screams bad / rushed science era truly cannot afford make mistakes like this, public opinion already extremely tender. kinda doubts feda approve  also hate people like lot year half you’re still trying downplay severity pandemic. Yes 700k blip. leading causes death US 2019 (using year 2020 outlier due covid swaying things, 2021 complete) heart disease 660k deaths followed cancer 600k. Nothing else 200k. yes, please continue pandemic blip. Germany's positivity rate higher UKs while, suggesting spike pretty inevitable likely get worse weeks yet. Same. 2nd dose didn’t leave couch.

The brains people 25 completely different 16 year old. Unless teacher idea like right now. Many kids broken. Yes pandemic restrictions factor well, constant masking plays part.

To clear, right masking least bad option, still bad option needs realistic ramps. bullets chamber always good. vaccine stuff like Merck's pill, COVID essentially finished major health threat vast vast vast majority people.

The conversation mindset around COVID need shift public mind COVID case 2021-2022+ entirely different risk factor compared COVID case 2020. one sleepwalking masks schools.  confirmed cases. infected people probably tested/diagnosed covid.

[The CDC estimates 120 Million infections *before* delta 1/3 population. unreasonable estimate additional 1/6 infected recent surge.   It’s all
Politics treatment likely used hospitalized covid, window treatment would different tested. wonder well drug fairs treatment started hospitalization.  proposal starting point bipartisan “COVID Compromise Act”

All citizens eligible age take fully federally approved vaccines choose 1 3 options:

Option 1: Eligible people chosen vaccinated:COVID / COVID related medical coverage either continues existing insurer provided federal government.Mask wearing optional; universal mask mandate.Immune legal action related breakthrough cases / spreading

Option 2: Eligible people chosen vaccinated:Insurers longer bound provide COVID / COVID related medical coverage them. Incurred costs related COVID infection treatment covered. Mask wearing optional; universal mask mandate. federal COVID precaution recommendations followed people proven / linked unvaccinated COVID spreaders held legally responsible costs / losses via litigation people get COVID (For instance, dated social media posts / pictures used evidence)

Option 3: Eligible people chosen vaccinated want benefits option 1:Mask wearing requirement outside home. Weekly COVID testing requirement cost billed medical insurer person (if insurance). Anybody option 3 found proven complying requirements option 3 automatically default option 2 retroactively

This act effect individual states COVID cases drop predetermined number. reach point act suspended numbers go predetermined number. sort medical ID required person show chosen option status.

Thoughts?   underrated comment day mean aren’t going say won’t work. think *probably* anti-correlated, suggest, needs studied.

Also, avoid using term “natural immunity” way using it.

I “vaccine-induced” natural immunity. people natural immunity previous infection.

It’s always immune system, acting naturally, work. guy work got total bullshit religious exemption vaccine (he completely made up) got COVID got extremely sick, went monoclonal antibodies. pisses much. Like allowed get treatment got desperate refused vaccine. Ugh, sucks. hope symptoms super mild, probably be! gf breakthrough cases boosters symptoms basically nothing (meanwhile booster shot completely laid 2 days). US 47million covid cases, close half population    Cool. shouldn’t forced people called health dept ask eligible, done asking interrupted hurried, ""hey come right now?""

Cool, let's bring back Smallpox, Measles Polio it. ""it's PErSONal ChoiCE!""

Personal, haha, yeah right. Dont tell republicans! horse meds work swear!  pandemic easy, else would fighting covid misinformation then? 

And no, course agree authoritarian prison, beyond insane little. bloggers around world profits covid misinformation punishment whatever. agree prison punishment misinformation neither ideas, that's it. (She wasnt even local, channel): reason could take credit development vaccine. People think responsible Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, German firm.

Dna looks like barcode  day 5 Pfizer pill still pretty effective, check study results great seems antivaxxers using support view vaccines necessary. obvious, first line defense get infected begin getting vaccinated. can't get vaccinated breakthrough case may good option. proof chinese economy produces pudding

GDP also pretty terrible metric economy first place, says nothing distribution wealth.

the best way americans look GDP, look GDP per capita see much money they're getting screwed of, billionaires continue line pockets government handouts That’s gamma globulin Why? seems totally unclear true.

The caveat would efficacy look worse if, time frame trials, vaccinated people individually experiencing *repeated* exposures. part, think happening, though.

If assume that, delta peak, 500,000 infections/day nationally (which relatively high estimate), means 1 600 people infected daily roughly 1 50 people infected 4 month period. approximate chances someone meaningfully exposed twice roughly 1 250. likely make big impact apparent efficacy.

Feel free correct thinking wrong, though. CDC establish clear definition ""smoker,"" think gives us permission use definition.

The CDC also vague things...Depression underlying condition, say need diagnosed. also list ""Dementia neurological conditions,"" raises question whether migraines, technically neurological condition, qualify. Clearly clue many needles they'll get end hospitalized.

FTP removed league. rules, whether star not. Bet Kaepernick he'd fired Whoops! indeed Moderna, know that, thanks. got booster yesterday Safeway one getting one. accidentally went wrong Safeway sent right one. Neither anyone getting shots. online forms schedule appointment ask way many questions perhaps discourages people. get flu shot might go Safeway since CVS long lines. hypothetical scenario someone enjoys burgling home?  Merck 8 deaths placebo 0 antiviral. although 50% reduction hospitalization deaths presented kind misleading end preventing death important. least article state anyone died taking Pfizer drug.

Anyway results great news. Treatment really needed looks like vaccines alone can't end pandemic (at least respect hospitals overloaded).  Time make sure everyone knows Democrats officially support EUA antivirals. assure not. especially saying ritonavir taken orally... agree. idea qualified booster someone told things list didn’t know about. great news much virus replicated time people suspect covid, get tested, wait results, contact doctor? Delta make people sick quickly. imagine people trial access special testing doctors almost delay. Getting sick Friday evening could knock getting full benefit drug. That's Moderna.

Yeah, mostly relied idiots right thing. idiots die want. infect children even though we're vaccinated (or soon enough little one), pop pill way.

Ahh that’s good news. googled “far right antivaxx germany” saw post WaPo article popped up. didn’t dig deeper that.   People immuno suppressant meds take safely it’s effective too?   Ah yes, I’m complete opposite “what I’m supposed do” getting vaccine stop spreading someone killing them. 

Logic Dude could possibly think reasonable suggest people drastically reduce quality life long-term sake weakened immune systems? That's never things before.

We never told people ""mask everywhere NEVER go large indoor events"" bad flu season, here. UK quite good infrastructure pcr testing, free next day delivery, next day results. Plus get many free lateral flow tests want time. sort infrastructure place, hopefully able make good use pills. Pfizer never fails give hard-on. Imagine going lousy comedian medical advice. many confirmed unconfirmed concussions Rodgers had?  hold higher esteem cops ? 

Because everyone glad firefighters show up, mostly firefighters kill hold first responders equal esteem.

As really change perception firefighters whole?

It definitely changes perception *these* firefighters, others refuse vaccines. Firefighters (in many places US) first responders medical emergencies; need anti-vaxxer giving gramma Covid refusal follow public health policy. Mate, ghost Einstein posted Reddit, someone would along find fault it. sweat :) Nooooooooooooooo . Don’t spill secrets . That’s 1830s tbh. jazz age might’ve racist, wasn’t full puritans. decade ended Prohibition USA.   rather horse. mean really fault third world democracies dressing sluttily, deserved overthrown I’d bet entire bank account morons still won’t take it. can’t anything laugh heel turn. guy misses Next Alex Trebek suddenly makes beeline Next Alex Jones Yeah need mandatory vaccinations kids school  Europe...over summer. That’s fine. Anything make take pill. fuck sakes can’t believe babysit entire sector population. ""...and considered high risk..""

See that's thing. control group hospitalization rate seems saying patients actually high risk.

If high risk control group's hospitalization rate would higher Pfizer study. super mild, like Light cold, still feel shitty overall    bar actually set low 65. Anyone BMI 25 “high risk” receive Mab treatment needed. (was) 5-7 205lbs last year. Concluding much study amount effort someone would put hastily cobbled together email. demonstrated potent antiviral vitro activity circulating variants concern, well known coronaviruses, suggesting potential therapeutic multiple types coronavirus infections. [""Study participants unvaccinated, mild-to-moderate COVID-19, considered high risk hospitalization due health problems like obesity, diabetes heart disease. Treatment began within three five days initial symptoms, lasted five days. Patients received drug earlier showed slightly better results, underscoring need speedy testing fuckimg imbecile. cost pandemic drags on, governments employers slowly moving towards mandates reduce expensive part pandemic reducing rate hospitalization vaccinating people highest risk hospitalized (the unvaccinated vulnerable).

There comes certain point political denials pandemic run full head onto real costs denial.

If me, would allow hospitals allocate billing pandemic related charges proportionally vaccinated unvaccinated patients. allow insurance companies charge unvaccinated share. We'll let actuaries cost out.

Freedom preserved. Responsible parties pay damage do. 

If pill drastically reduces damage, good; freedom preserved, costs reduced. doesn't, unvaccinated continue pay extra load they're willingly putting hospital system.

(I'm know harder understand can't done current laws) Big true hold higher esteem cops ?
I hold first responders equal esteem. 

But really gonna let firefighters change persecution firefighters whole? Oh, sorry. don’t know managed get confused someone gives shit people. were. Hey Rogers! 

Yeah, didn’t help you. late seems. Sounds like he’s got cognitive decline covid 80% broke within 2 years retirement. ultimately, they're nothing. people refuse take COVID vaccine definitely willing undergo antiviral treatment, least see touted much seedy sources, like Joe Rogan Facebook memes.   Yep UK's general Covid curve 4-6 weeks ahead mainland Europe year, yet media act like UK-only problem spikes, act shocked UK cases fall Europe's rises, despite 100% predictable.  
 
It's peak media sensationalism panic-bait. fuck people still falling 18 months quite baffling. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

I breakthrough case couple months ago pretty rough honestly. would think 2 shots+natural+covid pill(in worst case scenario), would cakewalk ever caught again. Also mention monoclonal antibodies needs come resort. 

With anything life analyze risks vs benefits. easy choice get vaccinated logically concluded getting covid would worse vaccine. never knew i’d end getting thats besides point.

Now caught recovered 2-3 months, don’t really want get booster anytime soon least. I’d pissed get sick booster shot may need it. problem one counts natural infection getting boosted. would think getting actual virus better 3rd shot terms protection became political can’t get real answers. go again…….  Thank you. I'm glad well too. People forget research vaccine started years ago SARS outbreak China. also coronavirus. reason research stopped SARS kind disappeared vaccine longer looking like money maker pharmaceutical companies. wonder much longer FDA withholds boosters everyone US. looking worse every single day. article pretty thoroughly explains drug's current situation. trial showed works astonishingly well, they're immediately submitting FDA approval. Hopefully checks out.  Got mine husband. late 30's. underlying condition husband got many empty slots got mine. Eh..might well. ask proof whatsoever.

We went CVS SoCal. probably heard antibiotics (penicillin, amoxicillin, etc.) treat viruses, conflated thinking drugs treat viruses.

A lot people mistakenly ask antibiotics treat viral infections, problematic due antibiotic resistance. Thus there's lot messaging take antibiotics viral infection, see making leap thinking means drugs take viral infection. want it.. fear it.. whatever. I'm going play words. Atleast Spain buy 15 min test pharmacy home. go 15 min test hospital/next day PCR want recovery certificate Yep, either switch look Portugal (\~87% ""fully"" vaccinated), they're 600 cases/million/week 3 deaths/million/week. Compared US (58% ""fully"" vaccinated) 1500 cases/million/week 23 deaths/million/week.

The US death rate corresponds 400K/year, making 3rd largest cause death, accidents number 4 200k/year. US Portugal's death rate, would make 50K/year, tied flu. vaccines effective without boosters ending pandemic even much much worse Delta strain.

Boosters + 2 new treatments go even further... people use them. Yes

Signed,

Most developed world government negotiate single price (cheaper sell country otherwise) drugs He's NFL, *of course* he's taking illegal substances.

I doubt sports league anywhere clean, I'm sure even possible make NFL without 'roiding. don’t see matter. general unvaccinated hospitalization rate around 1% give take, it’ll probably never reach anywhere near 7% world.   assumed certain things man went Berkeley. know say assumptions.  vaxxed person watched listened joe Rogan podcast Gupta - ivermectin legally prescribed medicine - saying used something else ignoring fact used humans regularly bad journalism. 

If controversial reason - tell why. think yearly shots required 2nd 3rd vaccine we’re done? america right? looking 3 weeks doses? saying Pfizer designed study make drug look better?  get 90%?   news, Aaron Rodgers already showing signs early CTE (Chronic traumatic encephalopathy). Judging rationale, ship already sailed.  would noticing reporting rest world? Somebody death wish would guess. Used sentence ""A breakthrough treatment would used treat breakthrough case covid 19"". 

Breakthrough used describe treatment would mean broke glass ceiling known science make something new. 

Breakthrough describing infection would describe infection broke immunity safeguards individual including vaccines. give horse ? sorry harsh criticism... live digital age anything said repeated. often repeated rhetoric scientific data case can't trusted comes pfizer. 

I'm sorry, that's false, ignorance contributing issue. nothing else, I'd recommend read article commenting it, learn process yourself. else we're doomed endless sea people spreading misinformation. 7% hospitalization suggests *were* high risk. That's way higher gen pop. Merck cut-offs probably even stricter get 14 percent demographics available researchers different. hard compare results 1 1 say Pfizer group high risk.

At rate possible drugs used conjunction would amazing news. need low cost treatment. COVID totally finished 90% vaccine 90% anti-viral, odds well still lockdowns certain places time next year excuse society rejected alternative: digging giant ditches filled millions idiots (more specifically - corpses). Logic gone second typed original comment lmao Insurance companies going want save money. significantly cheaper couple days ICU. oh, um, yeah....  Anyone making argument would come across example research. needs shut start liking freaking Bears.   Yes, privileged. also article Australia social healthcare system skin cancer third common cancer. ""skin checks"" really cancer screening.  Yep, reason care one way Trump say vaccine, one researching producing it.

I think silly skeptical vaccines reason. see people (not me) were, though, Trump's track record. guy literally drew weather map Sharpie screwed said hurricane going hit Alabama someone whose word trust.

But Trump FDA. Trump Pfizer Moderna J&amp;J. trust institutions full smart people working hard solve problem.

I fought hard try get one vaccine trials wanted shot early. (I accepted trials, sadly, instead line get shot eligible.) matter politician said. allowed post... pardon ignorance, gate-keeper. stay outside unwashed masses. tagline says ""Pfizer says product highly effective"" pardon literal interpretation opinion said interpretation. Waiting moderna booster, every clinic seems Pfizer anyone get free. mRNA shots recommended 90% people (without lying loopholes) 6 months 2% people 1 month. J&amp;J 2nd shot recommended universally everyone think 2 months first. people followed recommendations, would least 6 months since gotten second dose, people would qualify boosters. keep looking pharmaceutical silver bullet end Covid, undermining ability end Covid. way end Covid combination vaccines, contact tracing, testing, quarantines, isolating cases. 

Now throw therapeutics there, too, without effective testing, contact tracing, quarantines playing whack mole. 

Not scientist, opinion. initial DTaP series, however, FOUR boosters getting initial series kid. also discussion had, possibly getting first dose now. me, boosters available much clear, knew call. 

For first shot, province waves allowed get shot honour system quite sure wave in, things apply opened age group without caveat. 

And that, took places get shot. signed automated systems, supposed called. 

One place called three months later generic message walk shots, another place still never sent anything.

I waited week called places looking participating clinics location, discovered there's clinic little complex street.

They saw right away, they're chain they're owned, automated systems, pharmacist called moment eligible second shot, booster well. 

She called even knew supposed get boosters. 

If there's required might bring house hit sleep something, getting convenient time. people forget plenty childhood vaccines 3-5 shots part series.

Or maybe lots non-parents here. best reception: got first dose(s) left arm, get booster right butt cheek. vice versa. Oh I'm definitely going to! wanna copy paste convo earlier put things perspective, also thanks user study, rate myocarditis general unvaccinated population 1 per 10,857 compared findings indicating myocarditis common SARS-CoV-2 infection vaccination, reported previously Barda et discussion weighing risks benefits, CDC estimated among males ages 16-17 years, every million doses Comirnaty span year would prevent 1,540 COVID-19-related hospitalizations, may 73 cases myocarditis. males ages 18-24 years, figures would 3,150 39, respectively.

The takeaway myocarditis covid infection 11 100.000, vaccination 1-3 100.000, therefore vaccination makes lot sense. know asked genetics pericarditis arugmentation similar vaccine doesnt protect heart inflamations every covid symptom aswell. know that. 

We're still learning vaccines behave learning go. could need annual boosters, could like hep (or childhood vaccines) get durable long-lasting immunity set number shots. 

You know. pretend know. okay know.  weird 2021 happiest I've long time even insanity. honestly think there's element 'normal life' makes us miserable honestly desire return it. say that. think it. Berkeley notoriously ""woke"" crowd. Knowing know beliefs, fit preconceived notions student educated Cal would believe. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ sure confused.

In cases, natural immune response gives immunity. I'm guessing heard *large* group waiting grassy knoll Dallas days ago, waiting JFK Jr. (yes, JUNIOR) come back dead. Welp. Fuck guy, guess.    legit idea supposed get booster not. immune compromised right now? careful generalizing ""they,"" we're talking ~50 million adults gotten vaccinated. running IV positive test (or necessarily even going get tested feel ill), they're riding out. globally recognised liar gets thanks me.  Neat! ounce prevention worth again?  No, I'd skeptical came October 2020 vs. January 2021. I’m healthy af young. Chances getting severely sick covid dying small. still don’t want disease it’s easily preventable vaccine. I’d rather all. 

And far, it’s worked. I’m vaccinated never gotten covid. happily got Moderna booster too. Still healthy af.  fills patriotism. really bump 2 month old post ask “who cares”? It’s hilarious think college admission based ability Ivermectin?  one Britain recently approved? Anyone thoughts new effective medication affect upcoming OSHA mandate? particular, court challenges likely argue mandate overly broad punishment overly harsh highly effective treatment. know legal language new treatment option make less likely courts may enforce enforce mandate? double vaccinated, group, think OSHA rules say worker protections sufficient protect worker overly burdensome something like that. Again, know rules legal language. Maybe attorney OSHA expert would know. Thanks. Well said!  say depressed. We're depressed point. Thinking considered high school pretty generous ""do research!"" crowd. Nobody cares kaep anymore Awesome! vaccines pill! 

This fantastic, go science!

So take fucking mask off? 7% hospitalization suggests high risk. That's way higher gen pop.

This piece data I've really struggled find course this. overall hospitalization rate unvaccinated test positive? one point last year, thought low double digits. recent graph seems indicate true. thought fairly savvy regards data statistics, recent events disavowed I’m overweight,and work public, didn’t even give info get booster.

I would say get it. Yes, course. think clear learning go follow guidance comes out.  term gets used lot medicine, though, vaccines - breakthrough nausea, breakthrough pain, etc.

I suppose could said it'd good *all* cases, less meant, feel like would downplaying commenter's point people can't vaccinated. intentionally excluding people chose instead.

But yeah! really is. really beat virus like this, need three things: vaccines prevent/mitigate cases, fast accurate tests identify them, effective therapeutics treat them. last piece. Good think nobody studied soap body, light booty! think person looking nuanced take. totally right, seems like good idea get booster available. know argument is. shouldve named Pfizermectin Good thing beacons knowledge like Bro Jogan help Galaxy brained Alpha Males decisions. Glad research... definitely effective, nearly enough end pandemic, even 100% compliance.

Given that, reason would support future mask mandates protect healthcare system. hospitals becoming full, snap back mask mandates.

Masks reduce transmission, enough stop pandemic. Without draconian lockdowns get literally zero cases, virus always surge back. Masks timeshift someone get infected, prevent it. Masks bought us time vaccines.

The lasting solution vaccination, natural immunity risks entails. southwestern Chinese city Ruili small, remote largely unknown internationally. also, comes coronavirus, perhaps tightly regulated place past year, locked four times, one shutdown lasting 26 days. Homes entire district evacuated indefinitely create “buffer zone” cases elsewhere. Schools closed months, except grades — students teachers leave residents, including 59-year-old Liu Bin, gone months without income, city relies heavily upon tourism trade neighboring Myanmar.

If someone show evidence contrary I’d gladly acknowledge it. [My favorite go away? Maybe I'm asshole, I'm interested catching there's treatment.

Every voluntarily unvaccinated, selfish person letting virus spread mutate culpable still spreading risky disease. He’s great runner taking about? It’s one best parts game. ability scramble either extend play throw run first downs. Hate guy vaccine stance want, dumb take running ability.  think he'll fine.  Maybe he's planning run public office...he seems saying things lot people agree (unfortunately, seems family feels same). I'd kinda prefer stayed home pine needle tea.  Yeah good question dozens. pretty skeptical ivermectin thing research today found [this meta study 24 different ivermectin clinical Surprisingly results showed treatment ivermectin reduces hospitalizations/death 62% and, used prophylaxis, reduced infection rate 86% (but prophylaxis data low quality take number grain salt).  convinved people scared shots case, completely free argue them, since unlike vaccinations take little bearing risks. Well, entirely true since clog hospitals.

But feel much free send back Pfizer Merck lawsuit memes them, remind they're part Big Pharma. Unlike Merck brand Ivermectin course. That's Big Pharma. term 'breakthrough' kind suggests event supposed happening, vaccines never intended prevent infection. aim prevent severe illness, hospitalization death. vaccines \_do\_ mitigate infection decent amount prevent.

Nevertheless, pill great news. throw damn football Rogers trying pull something nothing. toad    Yep, they'll argue retraction part cover conspiracy loved rewatching x-files prior 2016 anti-vax crowd flat earthers make think one watching pure entertainment. 

back day conspiracy theorists like fox mulder meme. tell three truths:

a) Life short enough is.

b) COVID-19 really bad you. 

c) virus spreads easily almost certainly encounter lifetime.

What information you. make decisions. Right, classify mildly annoying almost downside.    makes sense, promise im dumb ig didn’t see dilution factors would different.. thanks! culture war bullshit. 11k people company sent us email today saying ""Anyone considers job high risk, considers high risk, get booster.""

Joe Rogan took prescription Ivermectin, horsey style.

However Tractor Supply near still stock yesterday

Form conclusion Canadian here: think we're gonna need build wall. Sorry guys lots cool but... Yeah. also keep Ted Cruz. They’ll probably still take ivermectin it’s cheaper “stick big pharma” whatever… mean sure, would great eliminate side effects. don’t crave them. is. people bad reactions flu shot every year. still get them. I’m point don’t particularly care people keep getting boosted not. primary doses important. got those, it’s much business else do, like society large views flu shots. think you’re dope don’t get it, that’s you. 

Again, nobody saying wohoo side effects, day feeling great small price pay eliminate chances getting seriously ill (in theoretical world yearly boosters). error confirmed hypothesis, look closely? Yeah smallpox shot bed week. ruined leave time deployment. got cool scar, though. Yup. donkey like leaves barn, never, ever going back in.

Look damage Wakefield did, part publics perception vaccines *anything* tainted due bullshittery.

Even forced retract steaming pile disinformation, still taken gospel truth Facebook. absolute insanity, side, want obliterate viruses power underworld? Yup, mix-and-match ~~approved~~ authorized FDA, precise wording. see hurray pill reports. nothing side effects toxicity. 

As always: killing virus easy, killing host process difficult part. people falling windows. folded around 750,000 units project last year so. nice know go waste. Show data pill alone. done tandem ritonavir much effective. yes, study tiny. assure know way subject. Honestly doubt it. point, anyone getting shot that's obviously smart thing already it.

I would bet vast majority people getting first shots people due outside pressure, like risk losing job, loved one get sick enough finally allocate one brain cell COVID couple seconds. presence effective treatment going materially change math people.  sad reality society people think COVID real affects them: get super sick lose loved one. 

These vaccines might newest type technology, safest compared older/original live virus versions.

Get vaccinated folks. comes control sufficient control measures. 

First doses well 3rd doses get us closer goal. pill available every CVS, pandemic over. 90% reduction severe outcome vaccine + 90% reduction pill case breakthrough infection.

The fear antivaxxers getting vaccinated elderly people severely sick literally cut 90%. risk evaluation equation tipped FAR way normalcy isn’t even worthy debate anymore. surprisingly fantastic option feel like taking 2 doses vaccine well booster shot ain’t enough help stop disease continuing spread even replicate 🛑 ✋ 💉 Empathy fatigue real thing, many people willing continue take precautions protect refusing vaccine probably run patience people also refuse 90%+ efficacy anti-viral. it’s “small study”, first all… saying “ Nothing reported effectiveness itself” plainly wrong. Pfizer soon request approval use COVID patients. get it? vaccines give blood clots 100%, just.... take 20-80 years depending old are. wait, eventually everyone got shots dead!

*Serious argument anti-vaxxer heard. They're genuinely convinced plan people longer living 80s elderly expensive keep around. government wants everyone die 80 save money. government though, clear. guess them? intention pills folk able take home. case, imagine sort ""order online got symptoms next day delivery"" way go.

Yes, handled crisis well, several cases death I'm aware due hospital ICU bed avaliable states struggling. national news people medical privacy. Hopefully!
But around lot doctors complained people wait long going doctor covid, cases try treat already pretty bad.
I don‘t remember pill talking about, claimed need take early sickness effective.

And expensive take severe cases, leaves us quite pickle. randomly exposed (out wild versus relative friend something tells later covid contact traced) start show symptoms, people even go get tested symptoms get bad enough know sure allergies acting again. day two three. covid test sites around take around two three days get results back... point day six. get hold doctor, cuz test doctor CVS Walgreens something doctor even know sick yet. call doctor's nurse line leave message since never answer tell tested positive covid ask please prescribe wonderful drugs out. time nurses get message, pass doctor, doctor calls pharmacy, pharmacy fills it, figure way pick pharmacy without infecting everyone there, probably another day since USA pharmacies arent 24 hours. 

 basically get wonder drug day 7. Yes that’s hyperbole.
You might noticed contention mask mandates throughout US. one sleepwalking masks anyone importantly children.

Edit add: people care children wearing masks, get vaccinated.  choice. think worth you, please so. think worth vaccinated, always curious people do.   widely available.

is tho? so, much cost? thought richs Even likely turn underestimate. watch. gotten third dose yet? im dumb english isnt first language, difference breakthrough treatments breakthrough infection?   downright annoying wear. Gets itchy scratchy. Easy get sweaty. Makes communication talking difficult  Silly note, definitely getting 100ml. would LOT vaccine. New York Times article felt like press release Pfizer.  truly one amazing interviews ever. It’s often get see someone utterly torch reputation quickly also thoroughly. wondered anything already fully vax even third dose People spent much time emphasizing long vaccines usually take develop. turned clinical trials easier put together whole world virus. Med benefits want work get anything them. VA medical doesn’t buy houses probably won’t cure PTSD. always medical, process red tape looked like pain ass, know quite people use them. That's risk second dose (1/10,000 men 12-30); never measured greater background rate first dose. doubt get first dose now.

We know rate 5-11. dose much smaller, average side effects lower adults. months know that. $700 pop feds bought bunch already Currently free either state/fed/insurance eating cost. that's assured true going forward. cheaper alternative good thing. something planned weekend’s matchup Rodgers Mahomes. Hope put money towards premium reduction instead. police mask usage fucking tired it. Today known antivaxer nose peeking urgh Talk doctor. doctor son.  don’t care antivaxxers take it. care people trying protect take it. I’m sure risk will.

We obligation change behavior protect people aren’t willing protect themselves. So? like fundies here... /s got booster. team Moderizer. 6G feelsgoodman.jpg terrible take why? Yes, ten pleasure! explains lot, actually. glad don’t Rodgers jersey. would get trashed immediately. thought job comedians funny. Rogen terrifyingly dangerous. hold up. Let's say followed necessary clinical trial protocols met endpoints, take approved trump prior election? Anyone thoughts new effective medication affect upcoming OSHA mandate? particular, court challenges likely argue mandate overly broad punishment overly harsh highly effective treatment. know legal language new treatment option make less likely courts may enforce enforce mandate?  double vaccinated, group, think OSHA rules say worker protections sufficient protect worker overly burdensome something like that. Again, know rules legal language. Maybe attorney OSHA expert would know. Thanks. Worm-free Horsey.  Biological systems really complicated. think dubious say know cell replication error uptake error downstream effects. Mostly, they're innocuous, iffin wasn't, would insidious hard pin vaccine. agree they're acutely safe efficacious, agree know much dosing longterm immunity, also know long term issues vaccine itself. longitudinal data... around years. sure, previous vaccine formulations decidedly harmful long term, necessarily rule vaccines. Well looks like producers correct add guy face smartest show TV repeated blows head factoring new variants lots things need prevent via vaccines, sure likely public's attitude apparently matters I've learned anything last 2 years probably gained fans lost. holy hell say that?

The CDC currently recommends get it. That's lie loophole.

I admittedly know things list. thought BMI 30 example BMI 25. That's HUGE difference. change fact I'd need lie find loophole get one, change fact many getting one admit qualify.  I'm boat you! lockdown staying home practically cleared anxiety/depression (+medication took these) realize mostly environmental. also rediscovered things enjoyed thought grown - actually, stripped suffering mentally.

Back work 5 days week still decently anxiety-inducing, feels different. sure world ever truly feel like gone back 'normal.'   He’s got cognitive decline Shailene Woodley watch foosball. :) “I’m big strong guy thought never going affect me. got Covid realized I’m like everybody else,” said.

What - thought going punch virus submission? inconclusive research paper ivermectin could treat COVID 19 showed improvement patients.

Ivermectin basically hydroxychloriquine 2.0. research paper said could effect, quickly got debunked, Qanoners tried use way avoid responsibility. least agree every day vaccines administered without widespread complications less reasonable get vaccinated? Absolutely right, we're long past eliminating Covid much world.

Clearly, possible. New Zealand got pretty darn close, China almost entirely suppressed virus. appetite US sort draconian lockdowns quarantines China used control spread.

People US would freak one person tested positive Disneyland, government locked doors [detained 30,000 people that's sort thing absolutely required want get Zero Covid.

Given we're never going take actions like West, pretty exciting see treatments come online.

Even China, successful controlling Covid, point choice going need made long keep restrictions, allow Covid transit reduced rate vaccinated population. Reject simple preventative measure build machinery protect virus accept expensive treatment foreign machinery protect virus. Uh huh, logic checks out. 

SMH people entire family Packer fans, brother told us took Rodgers specific stuff 3 year old’s closet mom told us cut jersey use toilet bowl cleaner. Fuck guy. hope Love kills weekend NFL suspends ass least 4 games. Ride pine rest career shithead. Every school that. exactly news. thought Olivia Munn high maint. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Glad Niners didn’t trade now. would also ended IR rest team 😔 get autoMod selectively removes messages ""incivility"", I'm glad deleted. do. less skeptical Biden admin pushing premature deployment because:

A. looming election vaccine deployment would affect

B. Biden team, estimation, credibility less opportunistic

I see people may disagree point B point seems obvious face. It’s clear given structure health insurance policies - let alone Medicare Part - true.  

If, posit, ICU likelihood gating factor, insurance companies make available fully covered outside typical drug brand name deductibles older immune compromised individuals - group significant ICU potential Covid. 

My point idea likely expensive drug offered way makes available everyone zero low cost. Focus football skills personal life homie SARS didn't, ""dissappear own"". massive effort eliminate it. Lots Asian countries huge shutdowns contain it.  aspects isolation extremely beneficial, negative reprocussions mental health well (which vary person person). 

I know me, able work home absolute game changer me. flip side feeling isolation feeling ""doign something wrong"" taking risk spending time peers significant negative impact mental health. I’m confused. One day article says cases declining. next day another article says things bleak headed wrong direction. april 2020 amazing time family forever. sat talked, cooked together. felt fortunate could afford it. Try CVS I'm back normal life, I'm still feeling mental health improvements got lockdown. social anxiety still much manageable pre-pandemic, I'm less worried things general. used huge fear I'd suddenly fired job, one would help me, life would spiral control, just...don't.

I think knowing people also worrying pandemic dealing effects made feel less isolated started social distancing, ironically. What's reasonable one person may another, guess. they’ve studying vaccine decades!

Seems it’s fair know particular instances would definitely interesting know would happened Trump won. Early Democrats saying trust vaccine. wonder uptake would changed continued following Trump victory. Meanwhile - UK similar numbers daily infections deaths 10s. UK's vaccination rate around 75% Covid19 pill, bullshit....What  Trump happens taken it. Also Desantis, Tucker, …  paper? I'm former smoker. bad man using underlying medical condition get booster? wonder would classify health treatment 'fear'.

He took antibiotics feared infection.

She got arm put cast feared heal right otherwise.

They got chemotherapy feared cancer would kill them.

Like, yeah, fear injury infection whatever hurting built equation. course is. question whether reasonable fear.

For immunocompromised people, fear dying COVID reasonable. healthy people, fear passing COVID someone unwittingly reasonable.

Fear vaccine that's year administered millions times widespread complications reasonable. kind fear child turn light. pill

What moderna pill? LOL Vaccinated people care mild cases themselves. can.  antiviral targets Herpes-specific DNA polymerase, preventing viral replication. definitely helps suppress breakout.

Herpes simplex virus somewhat unusual latent phase, though. virus infects cells becomes relatively inactive, without replicating. latent infection unaffected drug (since drug targets replication), difficult clear virus. Luckily, latent phase, virus reproducing, neither illness, transmission. illness pop-up years later.

There several treatments clinical trials, including monoclonal antibodies, antivirals, like Pritelevir Phase III trials.

It probably possible completely cure HSV, tricky know exactly yet. Luckily, Covid long latent phase like HSV. know, could number us Californians required conditions (depression, overweight, etc.).

I planning get mine tomorrow caregiving elderly mom (COPD, diabetes, dementia) December. lie. Vaccine induced natural immunity… fuck? 😂 miss athletes didn’t spout 8th-grade-level education opinions stupid Jean commercials. Big fan packers him. lost respect him. Go big go home. people dont things half way. gotta go way tot bottom rank smelling rabbit hole. People always good identifying skin issues. would go least every year. don’t want die something stupid like acral lentiginous melanoma wanted save $100. take infusion antibody cocktails hospitals. JFC. can’t *get* much worse! awful.

Edit: can’t type Yes. U.S. 

In industrialized countries access issues clear drug made available. 

For example, two vaccines shingles, older less expensive one newer significantly efficacious vaccine. US, pretty much every one gets newer vaccine. UK National Health Service provides older less efficacious vaccine. Nationalized health systems make kind choices time. 

I raise specific covid drug older monoclonal antibody treatments still work less expensive. clear National health services developed world give access new treatment. athletes work everyone else? It’s funny really come above-average intelligence career. see accurate picture intelligence seems.

Also, run real good 😂 skeptical vaccine pushed prior election skeptical vaccine pushed 2 months election?

Do trust FDA jobs?  hope get approved country English something referred breakthrough non-medical sense, positive thing, something novel good and/or useful. something called breakthrough treatment, expression means treatment promising big improvement before.

A breakthrough infection means virus got someone sick despite vaccinated. literally ""broke through"" immunity vaccine. craziest part covid realizing many people around complete idiots  :) Poor kiddo. Poor parent. Hope he’s better now. They’ll claim forcibly retracted deep state JFK whoever responsible silencing truth. There’s literally way logic opinion.

_________________

Few things here. 

Last Friday CDC update removed 500k first shots data correction. update Friday numbers last weeks Thursday. becuase whole week daily avg messed data correction. 

CDC break 5+ yet decided update 5+ since thinking might total number.

I might 100% sure total population 5+ heard 28m kids, added 28m old 12+ total.

Nice boost 18+ - guessing mandates hitting people getting shots.


I might move updates week seeing good numbers kids getting shots. Cbd shed tear. Yep, make much sense. quite groups qualify add comes roughly 85-90% US adults. sure went lot hoops exclude last 10% like yourself. 

I went got mine local grocery store pharmacy, even ask qualified under. said much took self attestation met requirements way. brain mixup. noticed wording “early isolation”. maybe could see. might nice break month two got one. fluff piece we’re coming almost 2 years distancing masks end sight almost feels like gaslighting? 

And know takes studies long time get published etc feels touch. dataset made available public?"
