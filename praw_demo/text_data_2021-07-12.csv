0,2021-07-12," Yep, basically Staten Island Brooklyn. What's outlook can't get second shot due medical advice complications first dose? Bachelors online I'm still working Masters, started COVID online program.

Online always thing college. That's fault telling people anything used pandemic, sterilizing immunity. fault vaccines, make small percentage base rate get confirmed symptomatic covid. controlled presence NPIs curb outbreaks, absolute rate small, percentage base percentage. long?

For me, thing makes sense ""it depends level vaccination community spread location."" Watching tv still prevent infection driven gathering athletes support staff... Less 1% people got Moderna vaccine reported tinnitus, 1 3 people (and rising) get tinnitus lifetime. 

It‚Äôs one things might even real side effect, showed data (as might expect ultra-common condition do) listed. real side effect, still barely affects chances developing tinnitus. Yes keep gyms schools libraries museums kids camps etc open. get get sacrificed  True. worry people get vaccinated already see numbers drop/not grow much going forward. went second shot weeks ago centre wasn‚Äôt busy. busy would expect anyway. I‚Äôm Lyon exactly small low population area.  Canada donate doses part Covax. There's Pfizer Moderna deal.for doses years, need keep enough potential 3rd dose possibly yearly refresh.

Completely irrelevant new vaccines bought. vaccines donated.

Just stop spreading misinformation. would interested see well. strong suspicion *not all,* cases Long Covid psychosomatic. travel vaccinated state, Iowa, legislature outlawed masks public schools. Forever. madness. 80% cases Delta point. real concern. mRNA vaccines target spike protein, virus mutates much vaccines longer effective, simultaneously mutated able infect humans all.

That's false. spike protein composed roughly 1000-1500 amino acids varies virus virus. Many, many variants interact human ACE2 receptor. different human coronaviruses different spike proteins, infect us none current anti bodies work coronaviruses work COVID19. That's novel.

We've also already seen mutations changed spike protein COVID19, thankfully far mutations affected immunity people antibodies negatively.

It's entirely feasible mutation changes spike proteins enough (mostly) avoid anti bodies formed mRNA vaccines still able interact ACE2 receptor.

This called shift. expected point given enough mutations. relatively rare precisely reason want keep active virus mass (i.e. infected humans) low possible. people get infected higher chance shift. 


It's highly likely get something called drift, small enough changes still mostly identified COVID anti bodies. already see known variants.

E.g. Biontech vaccine seems slightly less effective vs Delta variant.

Enough drift might require booster shot get good protection again.

Drift means start 0 since kind protection portion vaccinated populous. E.g. 50% less infections 70% less hospitalizations. Enough slow spread enough stop even currently unpredictable unexplainable scenario happens virus evades mRNA vaccines remain infectious (which understanding would ridiculously unlikely), 

Again, much likely think hundreds millions infections scenario far unexplainable. 

mRNA vaccines, much breakthrough are, magic. offer vessel contain information body produce antigens/proteins own. shortcut producing antigens directly body instead outside lab. quicker process apparently looks like precise end create antigens (in case spike protein) body. longer match virus, immunity gone heavily breakthrough mRNA technology result pandemic would allow us effectively alter vaccines almost instantly.

You correct, develop mRNA booster shots within weeks. issue is, old vaccine longer works due shift would start zero lose progress made first 3.5 billion doses various vaccines administered. taken us 7 month get now.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple may aware this, vaccination requirements travel around ages, long covid. I‚Äôm pretty sure vaccines rare side effects.    maps positivity rates zip code give sense mask up. it‚Äôs not. Ontario gave many fist Pfizer doses. wasn‚Äôt order big enough Pfizer give everyone second dose brand. It‚Äôs government fuckup anyone flips out, risk getting GB vaccine 

1. Less getting covid.

2. unlike flu vaccine (which also less risk getting GB getting GB flu).

GB caused antibodies make antigen (ie spike protein) looking like something nervous system. Myocarditis type 1 diabetes occur fashion. Since vaccines 1/100th antigen natural infection, antibodies tend specific bad stuff less autoimmune risk. California K-12 students refuse wear masks inside school classrooms buildings, required new state rules, prohibited entering campus, another form education provided them, according new regulations state released Exceptions made students special health needs state rules build recommendations released Friday U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention, provide flexibility states school districts. federal recommendations, example, school could allow vaccinated students attend classes without masks. California choosing take strict uniform approach, also possible federal According recently collected data, 99% responding school districts reported reopen fully in-person instruction fall ‚ÄúThat seems safe course ensuring every student come back school fall,‚Äù said state Supt. Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, reviewed state health rules. ‚ÄúI certainly see logic it.‚Äù

‚Ä¶ link. understanding city break data way public health officials know focus efforts. that‚Äôs always news outlets focus on. 

Also, data seems constantly evolving. example, today NYC public researcher told public radio pop vaccination sites turning effective poorer neighborhoods, new strategies works. anecdotal evidence keep mind view France still ‚Äúforeigner‚Äù French native British immigrant 3 years ago. However wife French whatever that‚Äôs worth üòÅ

Anyway thoughts‚Ä¶ France ‚Äúfondness‚Äù homeopathic remedies bigger think people realise/admit. example herniated disc lower back start year moving heavy furniture. Almost everyone know told go chiropractor rather MRI follow medical advice. say MRI followed spine specialists advice people look weird. sister law also herniated disc back ten years ago still issues goes chiropractor times year still! Whereas back basically fine now. MRI three(!) years (which knows herniated disc) never followed keeps going chiropractor ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

When covid hit almost everyone know didn‚Äôt take seriously. ignored measures mixing households etc know many people covid. badly friends family died. Yet still play fire ignoring advice. 

As anti vax specifically feel social media biggest factor. parents law refuse honestly believe massive cover vaccine related deaths. range *millions* people. believe crap read Facebook ‚Äúnews‚Äù sites. 

I don‚Äôt know true people certainly true people know. Also many people don‚Äôt trust/like Macron. think lying serious covid stay power. 

So yeah it‚Äôs weird. least small view France. would extremely unlikely. would definitely prioritize clean hands shoes off. But, September, going start making people pay--hoping push get vaccinated instead using multiple tests test negative. interesting see works.  Excellent point!! Sky blue last spring summer made baseless argument evidence

That‚Äôs becuase don‚Äôt understand argument. re-read carefully think it‚Äôs pretty clear I‚Äôll summarize below. evidence due lack access?

I made claim cause. claim made *your* take focused parts article *they* don‚Äôt back ignoring parts do. assumption you‚Äôre bias people areas article mentioned. correlation political partisanship vaccination rates 0.85

Correlation worthless without sort causal connection. might well talking divination using tea leaves scientific value it‚Äôs totally unrelated argument anyway. See above. Get neucleocapsid antibody test. fine. entirely reasonable here. superpowers happen get 3rd one 3rd company. Canada donate doses part Covax. There's Pfizer Moderna program.

Canada deal.for doses years, need keep enough potential 3rd dose possibly yearly refresh.

The day they'll give something else AZ see, planned yet. given hypothetical may never happen ignored part hypothetical situation change anything perception AZ following donation. glad see CA take stance. I'm hoping follow. France's vaccination rate EU average much. EU average 53.9% France 52.3%.

""CCTV footage revealed two people walking past mall transmitting virus.""

Unless emitting colored clouds virus vapor something, think we'd dismiss claim merely guess. particularly good guess, since there's evidence thing even remotely possible.

(There plenty people *suspect* got trip grocery store jogger 30 feet away outside, suspicion got extended contact loved one assumed it.) It‚Äôs least desirable vaccine. thing would probably one ineffective Chinese ones. fact matter AZ offers similar levels protection two doses Pfizer. rejecting pride almost bad anti-vaxxer. opinion completely detached reality. die faster, they're cheaper. is. know died caught covid? 

Also, math reasoning honestly grade school level. whole PCR threshold debacle anti-vax covid denier misinformation.

and glib saying ct threshold doesn‚Äôt matter... does... own. explained me.

People like poison discussion prevent meaningful education. cycle threshold issue popularized well-researched NYTimes article August 2020, may foolishly dismissed ""anti-vax covid denier C.D.C.‚Äôs calculations suggest extremely difficult detect live virus sample threshold 33 cycles.

I think downvotes lot posts like shaming vaccinated people wear masks. posts quickly turn accusatory...like really, wearing mask 20 minutes inside grocery store inconvenience everyone makes seem be. 

Well, find inconvenient, I'm fully vaccinated live area 80% vaccination. you.  got second shot made heart rate high enough make wonder l needed see doctor. eventually went away scary couple days. condition taking medications weaken immune system, may fully protected even fully vaccinated.

UK heavily relied obviously exceptionally effective vaccine. redirected.

Exactly, done either way. Though would far difficult China get evidence US sabotage compared vice versa, end products would Taiwan China.

The strategy also depends largely control international media, know who's better that.

See, making defending China easy. Data countries show vaccinated people fine even get infected. people refuse get vaccinated US, willingly rolling dice life. 100% correct.

0% chance happening. fact you‚Äôre getting downvoted sharing facts infuriating. sub full people acknowledge news fits agenda going back normal ASAP. It‚Äôs really fucking sad embarrassing. Damn awesome numbers. Y'all right tip ""heard immunization"". 

Keep Canada cool! listening. kept providing anecdotal examples. interpret Singapore counting people vaccinated sinovac ""vaccinated"" time allowing sinovac? question ask government. We're talking effective sinovac care bribery case. claim sinovac enough vaccine info correct. wiki page says real world study Chili showed 65% effective symptomatic; 87% hospitalization; 90% ICU admission 86% deaths. going see studies Indonesia, Brazil, Turkey wiki page. Turkey announced 84% effectives (against what?). see western countries using Sinovac? Well, need to. access Pfizer, AZ, Modorna better effective rate. Again, discussion comparing vaccinated using sinovac vaccinated all. discussion Sinovac vs Pfizer, AZ, Modorna, would personally pick latter. many people choice. sinovac MUCH better vaccine. last reply topic. Cheers. number seems rediculously low. Hoping quick recovery. 70% pro plague pro plague accessories means 5% get immune got weak response still pretty bad disease.

That‚Äôs really works.

Well Tennessee so... Astro-Mod here, massive side effects first dose, almost nothing second.  hesitate say lot unexpected things happen, extremely unlikely event like imminent. say this.

Also, te delta variant. reports bypasses protection vaccines People saying *everything* done control spread disease ""authoritarian"" since beginning. I'm sick it. viewpoint deserves taken seriously. literally nothing whining overgrown children.

And even case, telling defend position moron complained authoritarianism without offering justification? Double standard much?  Whoops, number absolutely sucks. basically insufficient keep Delta steady/calm. virus R0 Delta variant eat unprotected 30‚Äì40% pretty easily many neighborhoods 70% first shot, high 100%. NYC diverse socioeconomically politically folks might think. pretty conservative neighborhoods Brooklyn huge anti-mask rallies/protests last year. Staten Island. poorer and/or conservative neighborhoods lagging behind like everywhere else country. Lots people still masking cautious last year, everyone. many breakthrough cases seeing? told breakthroughs exceedingly rare. Lied us again? Forever? target reached? target? That‚Äôs pretty much CDC done since pandemic started lol. They‚Äôve lost credibility, imo  careful much look isolation. turn hypochondriac. much reading get people super anxious‚Ä¶which overlaps long covid symptoms. Wear N95? FDA also allows mixing vaccines certain circumstances. Luckily USA never ran circumstances, whereas countries have. COVID fairly unique right cusp whether suppression mitigation better, leading arguments even among good actors. vaccination, many places mostly reopen, others opening, everyone super excited wear masks anytime can.

If 25-year-olds killed 10-20% rate like 1918 flu did, would case. Suppression would rational choice.

Note scenario way connected reality. SARS-CoV-2 mutates much slower influenza, already vaccines, ability change vaccines moments notice (e.g. specifically target delta future variant) wanted to. I'm vaccinated. not, public, manage get within six foot radius, somehow manage give covid, immune disorder?

I'm acting irresponsibly scenario. That's sure. think us who‚Äôve gotten shots ‚Äúwised up‚Äù already needed do. kind attitude what‚Äôs keeping people gotten shots getting them.
Telling even shots, you‚Äôd better live life you‚Äôve done year now, selfish, definitely convince them. demanding condescending attitude isn‚Äôt helping. Seems like yes, less worked well cases (delaying second dose UK countries), well in

I bet look UK's reasoning extending 2nd dose, like Canada, mountain evidence back made decision felt comfortable without running new trial. like would never run trial make sure 2nd shots works 25 days instead 21 days. cases (hydroxychloroquine, various home remedies COVID, etc).

The opposite statement.

Some recommendations evidence back claims, others not. know ones I'd trust.

My God people love arguing sake arguing. hospitalizations always lag bit behind cases, wait days You‚Äôve whined masks 3 comments kids year half wearing one public. wear mask make food then. dunno that. 100% people believe doctors end dead. 

So believe doctors? referring fact life 100% mortality rate year that?

In honesty POV anecdotal. I've service anything Chinese Navy government get hate us--certainly middleasterns besides Ayatolla easy downplay say 2% population. That's small number, big deal. Sure, 2% actually represents 6 million Americans 2% much easier ignore.

By way, never forget 9/11 3,000 people died. thanks‚Ä¶ Masks remain certain amount people vaccinated, children included. that, unless COVID suddenly disappears face Earth, there's really nothing else done.  went talk group completly unmasked people super polite them. 

Unmasked people likely aggressive Ssshh trying make China vaccine looks bad, bring logic Isn‚Äôt natural immunity? Good catch critical thinker (not /s) Sure, missing events things closed see want go again, would problem wearing mask distancing? pretty much cost nothing possibly lot benefit large scale there's lot od outbreaks going around. I‚Äôm Canada, much hesitancy here, 67.6% entire population least one dose province (BC) 78.8% people 12 one shot. totally agree, gotta keep conversation going! Someone posted one: conclusions interesting, doubt. I'd close look follow-up work done since.

Thanks links, however. Ooo that‚Äôs nice. Probably better fact.  NACI non-Government group comprised scientist makes recommendations generally follow decided better mix Pfizer Moderna quickly give everyone 2nd shot wait additional Pfizer vaccines show up. 

We already extended 2nd shots 16 weeks believe get many people first dose possible. Delta variant started becoming prominent world wide look like single dose super great fighting (I believe reports suggested 33% efficacy) thought better direction would get many people 2nd doses possible. 

We know Pfizer Moderna extremely similar essentially eliciting response spike protein deemed would safe mix match mRNA vaccines. 

Mixing vaccines un-common done frequently world wide.

Says   *sydney. reached Goulburn, whole state isn‚Äôt effected. far That's one way make stats vaccinated infections vs unvaccinated infections look really great. Seems like DeSantis move  already pledge donate 80M doses. rich countries do, ignore WHO.

May countries free-riding R&amp;D vaccines little less entitled little grateful. Governments, particularly democratic ones, prioritize people foreign countries, particularly life &amp; death situation like pandemic.

If CDC scientists say need boosters, use boosters. helping donate vaccines, enough .. boosters, vaccines whatever scientists deem necessary, sending dose that. particularly important delta seems renew surge here. 

If tables turned, poor countries same. certainly quick fix millions people waiting vaccines get full approval get shots. we're one week Fourth. bet watched lot YouTube videos dense. Could also vaccine provide protection, especially vaccinated late last year. reality know long protection lasts well vaccines protect delta. sucks, whole situation bs.. Ouch UK discovered.

My case likely DTaP vaccine. important protect kids well. Delta infectious kids. Even mild asymptomatic case, seeing long covid cases, neurological issues changes grey matter brain post covid. kids going dealing long term impacts covid long gone. Vaccine like, immune system army vaccine trains fight virus enters body. also trains build guns ammo effective virus.

So better immune system training time build guns ammo needs, still lose war battles still damage body. Hopefully less since able beat enemy back faster less training, guns, ammo.

Given vaccinated people already significantly protected infection, wearing mask public seems like bit overkill.

I guess makes sense vaccinated parents wear masks home whenever feel slightly weather, case mild case Covid. certain high risk events may prolonged contact unvaccinated people. fine. 8-12 weeks ideal AZ sure punishment referring too, certain kids kicked school reminded pull mask on.

Even union guidelines told us understanding lenient, in, complain mask lapses. 

This parents want complain mask insist kids wear them. It‚Äôs never going end. nobody getting vaccinated US anymore?

Even mild asymptomatic cases without vaccination lasting physiological changes. High hopes Colorado follows suit.

The CDC like, ""It'll probably okay."" Given serial fuckups, I'll taking bit cautious approach.

An infected person, vaccinated parent share indoor space.

The parent MUCH less likely get breakthrough case bring home infected person one wearing mask.

Wearing mask benefit, much less.

Best would everyone still wore one, two barriers. maybe one effective barrier, given incompetent people mask fitting.

I feel countries already strong vaccine reticence, hearing Canada stop using AZ may reinforce beliefs. Lets hope I'm wrong, dozen millions people around could end preferring vaccine perception, science facts. Yes, Germany. I'm Berlin got Pfizer Friday (following Astra May), friend mine health care got Astra February + Moderna April. recommendation follow Astra mRNA shot, particular brand. think needs clear people getting vaccination mean can't ever catch virus. mean much much less likely to, body already developed antibodies ready fight better, leaving lot less lethal position would otherwise. hope get well soon friend.

You go restaurants/hairdressers others you‚Äòre either 1)vaccinated (21 days 1st dose) 2)tested last 24/48 hours 3)had COVID recovered.

It‚Äòs one reasons Austria one lowest incidences Western world even though everything open (even though it‚Äôs rising last week) think there‚Äôs lot evidence cloth/paper masks, close quarters like planes, aren‚Äôt really effective. you‚Äôre breathing covid air hour without vaxed, layer cloth won‚Äôt much good. mean I‚Äôm RN always joke I‚Äôm basically combination waiter drug dealer lol

No one wants permanent masks. wish majority population would get vaccinated already (everyone get it, should). mask free again. then‚Ä¶ need slow spread wear masks. difficult? UK tiny compared Canada population that‚Äôs way bigger densely populated. UK going true test regards ending restrictions Canada.

The ""freedom"" body stops endangers others peoples cannot vaccinated. parents high 80s got J&amp;J problem. likely state funded districts. Privately funded schools would exempt. concerned getting covid yourself? along lines spreading it?

I personally insanely cautious throughout pandemic (like alienated friends family cautious), I'm fully vaccinated I'm basically completely returning normal. feel point like dying developing terrible long term effects covid seems really statistically improbable, happens, happens. I'm concerned spreading others, figure they're taking exact risks am. Like they're eating popcorn theatre behind me, that's choice much mine there. Cautiously watching news Delta I've really enough. also feel like things get bad enough everything goes lockdown months, I'll probably glad normal life stuff now. 



Just find interesting months ago would probably camp wearing N95s everywhere super duper careful. main, mean most? AZ sinovac. AZ slightly more. Depends strain, immunity original Covid doesn‚Äôt provide adequate protection Delta variant. people got twice, different strains. Official sources country say 0.1% vaccinated population gets COVID. around 3000000 fully vaccinated people, 3000 got COVID far. official numbers (obviously skewed get find asymptomatic numbers).

Teasing apart also accounting incoming variants extremely difficult. signs Europe suggest less vaccinated states get hammered, vaccinated states may well without additional NPIs (this uncertain part). Re: Canada, also spreading two doses countries (8-12 weeks versus typical 2-4 weeks places), I‚Äôm curious that‚Äôll come play efficacy.

A bit that. booked day became available year, I'll receive second shot 7th August. minute one person died vaccine one would take it.

So many countries actively using AZ countries would love get supply even rare chance death observed. Lockdowns implemented protect low possibility ""long Covid."" Long Covid shown correlated severity infection, since vaccines significantly reduce severity, issue vaccinated people. time, unvaccinated people refused vaccine, restrictions cannot left place protect them. WSJ Mirror: Oh no‚Ä¶ Anyway Let's straight now, everyone opportunity first dose now. appreciate people unable vaccinated due health conditions miniscule number compared refused based nothing apart ill educated.

Now know vaccine 100% effective overall risk groups fully vaccinated even 1 jab milder symptoms plus likely younger anyway concerned.

For unvaccinated already know generally covid less effect children (apart affecting education isolating) need overly concerned them. 13% adults far refused jab ones risk. That's 6.75m adults risk.

Proud country ! I‚Äôm literally reading I‚Äôm waiting area received mine. 

- laughs nervously 50 60 percent effective... im sure thats probably people dont get flu shot... maybe 100%? (Just opinion maybe im wrong.) 


as flu + Covid. .. see read.. dont seem co exist well..  


I swear read somewhere least amount flu cases last year two due corona virus dominant virus. 


(Im trying bash dont want anyone take say fact.) recall memoru.. apologize sincerely any/all wrong... please correct am.. wring see 900 children dead? hope get better soon!

Would mind sharing you‚Äôre going now? Like, hospitalized? Thanks Hear southwest Missouri? hospitals *aren't* overwhelmed. Hell don‚Äôt think cdc cared long haul either. Fyi, Ontario charge vaccine procurement. federal government is. what's happening production sporadic. Pfizer still coming lesser quantities. Essentially Pfizer trying keep customers happy. tau variant? Whoa... hear that's twice bad pi variant.  don‚Äôt think worry anymore. treatments medicine people already infected, vaccination take away long Covid. even live regret decision fix it. Yes, yes real estate values? 
Asking *totally* joking way‚Ä¶. Luckily cruises stricter. Either requiring vaccine identification don‚Äôt provide you‚Äôre restricted constantly getting retested ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Side effects correlated effectiveness. That's People forget sometimes pandemic, time absolute essence. Pfizer mass distributing third world countries right waiting result future breeding grounds deadlier variants. Vaccinate vaccine readily available you, PLEASE WAIT. Ya really wonder half people bots what. enlightened comment really showed snobbery refusal back-and-forth conversation. Echo chambers usually don‚Äôt work out. spelled ""unintelligent"" wrong Maybe said ‚Äúcome together pull through.‚Äù 
Definitely society large come fine end. ‚ÄúMost‚Äù could mean 51-50% could also mean 99-1% correct? don‚Äôt know tell you. positive test rate going back almost 8 central Florida. Almost high last summer. media isn‚Äôt making numbers up. friend certainly isn‚Äôt making got ‚Äòrona- felt pretty terrible- despite vaccinated. Check Covidactnow.org 
Every state increasing infection rate. 
Many better vaccinated states aren‚Äôt 1.0 yet, every state undeniably trending eclipse 1.0 many already 1.2 1.3 range. fact you‚Äôve downvoted comment concerning. makes second guess everything I‚Äôve reading above. Sigh... Considering totally opened, already passed point. vaccinated folks get COVID, deal long COVID effects (effects lungs, heart, brain etc.) ? Germany, need masks indoors public transport longer mandatory outdoors unless waiting station bus/tram stop. fear Long Covid, want brain fog lasting months busy year ahead me. biggest issue GF nervous COVID I'm asshole brought her. hope ok get isolation 2 weeks. I've one Pfizer far hopefully helps somewhat. Thanks man. He's getting info place 99% redditers get info.. ass. read news article ""The Sun"" unverified shithole publication running mouth anyone everyone listen. Likewise Iowa agree, also think really depends person. dad stepmom around Christmas mild. Stepmom lost taste/smell, tired trouble sleeping, that's really it. dad never real symptoms speak, said felt off, never sick. Almost like feel cold coming on/your body feels off, sickness kicked yet. 

It's crazy different everyone! wish mild considered like them! Macron forcing population get jab get Covid test longer free last august. seems working, 1.1 million people booked appointment Monday evening announcement. Every school county shut least last year 25% kids tested positive sick time. What‚Äôs wrong hoping plane?  Sorry hear that, kinda sucks humanity think it‚Äôs still spreading bad even vaccines there. second part statement rubbish, there's data suggest delta deadlier. fact rate death far lower previous variants, that's likely due vaccine take better treatments now. never said ONE vitamin. complicated want know factors instead hand wavy ""oh complicated"" response.  Vaccines effective original strain, current variants problematic. see point picky.

Rejecting Covishield seems bit silly though. sure honest. haven‚Äôt seen information SARS MERS long-term symptoms. Though seemed primarily respiratory illnesses. Covid I‚Äôve reading throughout, isn‚Äôt limited lungs. 

Someone else linked article Singapore study persistent symptoms 6 months infection: inflammatory markers found people experienced either mild severe disease associated issues circulatory system leads elevated risks cardiovascular disease. Sometimes people blindly follow government everything. bet mixed doses told so. get carry home infect parents teachers. kids actually die COVID-19 thankfully rare, transmission. [Asymptomatic kids seem high nature, school operating without precautions high risk.  never mandatory sweden, elderly care got offered one prioritized/early. Good honest information vaccines enough us get sufficient coverage. 


Infection spread hospitals lower many workplaces (not mention parties households), made sense priority general. Look eyebrows dude, dead giveaway That‚Äôs crazy. It‚Äôs like hunger games since April try book vaccine. People showing pop clinics 3am waiting hours... people rely Twitter, Reddit etc find pharmacies.. it‚Äôs terrible rollout still way little people fully vaccinated start another round shit now... Nothing burger‚Ä¶ literally change Moderna title company name.  people downvoting? valid question something called vaccines? possible completely misread comment. first time. Exactly. part Basic Human Rights forced undergo kind medicinal procedure. dont to, unless banned wearing something like n95 mask? Right, say don‚Äôt Pfizer delays disingenuous. don‚Äôt Pfizer supply didn‚Äôt order enough everyone get second time. Yeah clear here, I‚Äôm predicting apocalypse anything. vaccines bit less effective bit careful, that‚Äôs all.

From I‚Äôve seen, Astra Zeneca shot May actually better job cells. People get Astro Zeneca shot first Moderna shot second wind fairly competitive antibody levels, double cell levels. mRNA vaccine makers put ‚Äúlock‚Äú protein spike stop changing shape connects cell. seems really helped immune systems effectively build lots antibodies it. (totally speculative) theory allowing spikes connect cells, Astra Zeneca shot actually gave immune systems opportunity cells learn handle infected cells.

When original trials came out, Pfizer shots new peak, everybody dazzled antibody action, seem give sterilizing immunity. high cell count Astra Zeneca shot seemed like booby prize comparison, nobody cared; worry cell reaction another vaccine stop getting sick first place?

But said, cell response probably lasts lot longer. means long run, Astra Zeneca shot could actually bit effective, least competitive people think.

By way, early evidence Moderna shot may turn longer lasting Pfizer. use triple dose mRNA. Initially, kind seemed like overkill led stronger side effects. it‚Äôs possible Delta variant needs big antibody response tackle effectively Moderna begins get edge. it‚Äôs hard tell vaccine wasn‚Äôt widespread early on, used UK usually mixed matched Astra Zeneca, making hard direct comparisons.

Take grain salt though. I‚Äôm medical doctor. point concerned lasting effect trauma children? lived hard childhood continue struggle adult it. can‚Äôt imagine lot kids won‚Äôt end lot mental health problems later this. understand period unavoidable protect vulnerable, children vulnerable lasting mental health problems covid. Month two. Nope, asshole monkeys gunna assholes. reading comprehension needs work. Yeah, sadly agree.  reality half country basically insane believe nothing real.** 

At point, believe anything suffer personal loss COVID. shortage vaccines everyone currently opportunity go get one. Unless recommend government forcibly vaccinate them, getting vaccinated accord get CDC dealing unfortunate reality creating policies.

I think CDC option recommendation continued masking social distancing case throughout lockdown period. CDC couldnt enforce recomendation height lockdown series waves had. Lockdown worked states took seriously residents states collectively needed done. really think anyone listening CDC reccomendations right want btw- delta problem us vaccinated. didn‚Äôt even follow fucking science one.

the vaccine protects inoculated serious illness look things. delta variant really [spreading equally across entire vaccines likely causal variable here. dinging CDC vaccine perfectly preventing infection? vaccine ever perfect preventing infection, ever. opinion, CDC made reasonable recommendation sane members society. rest society chose use CDC's recommendation indulgence protect community, fucking year through, nothing going get them, unless forcibly vaccinate good. Hospitalizations rising fast, actually‚Ä¶ mean random people say whatever want, zero covid never going happen somebody waiting going eventually decide waiting forever really makes sense.

There‚Äôs lot psychological damage people may take longer others return ‚Äúnormal‚Äù evidence points little need worry people vaccinated. 

If health agencies recommend booster you, get it. know somebody‚Äôs sick, steer clear (which always anyway). I‚Äôm fairly big germaphobe, I‚Äôve conducting since got vaccinated people around did, plan continuing conduct way unless something drastically, completely unexpected happens. It‚Äôs worth missing life worrying covid point. factor long covid, reason everyone forgetting about.    Good idea. sense safety fragile can‚Äôt let people express concern first global pandemic pretty much anyone‚Äôs lifetimes? Sturgeon confirmed Scotland move 19 July ‚Äúmodified‚Äù form level 0 government‚Äôs five-tier system Covid controls...

It's define things. people think things back normal because... ZERO level. utterly tragic.... yet there's certain segment believes God's plan! lot people really understand EUA approval. ""well good enough make guinea pigs population observe"", ""although yet amount data like sure, see effective low risk. 600,000 people! Barely worth mentioning! trial gave month ago. can't seem get act together. dropped site coordinator seemed equally frustrated Novavax.  went school West Virginia, seem conservative thing.

We prohibit sleeveless shirts showing stomach shorts shorter mid-thigh attending--but goes boys girls enforce both.

There different rules sporting events outdoor events much lienant  trust them, think others shouldn't.

Do put words mouth. 

Regardless choosing misinterpret statement, clearly stated understood reasoning slow make recommendations. 

You seem believe CDC absolute monopoly science many scientists epidemiologists carrying studies making recommendations matter, strange someone professing devoted ""the science."" suspect want wear mask ever choosing almost religious devotion CDC act superior toward people reconsidering masks Delta variant spreads. Berdymukhammedov recently told Moscow-based broadcaster Mir rare interview ‚Äúthanks work (we) carried out‚Äù, Turkmenistan ‚Äúyet discover case disease‚Äù.

It's right article It‚Äôs really scary hear Missouri hospital COVID patients December. It‚Äôs preview coming rest country schools places reopen without mitigation strategies. Yeah vast majority youth went venues. really big clusters infections festivals well.

Hospitalisations IC occupation still going 2 weeks things fully reopened.  world America wasn‚Äôt 50%+ fully vaccinated sure. 

""Based hospitalizations U.K., Delta variant seem likely lead hospitalization death, particularly among unvaccinated people, according recent study published Lancet."" 


And next paragraph says ""In U.K., children unvaccinated adults age 50 2.5 times likely become infected Delta, according recent study published Imperial College London."" [Here's frustrating disappointing past year. many Americans putting head sand ""covid over"" + unvaxxed people going unmasked everywhere going get much worse gets better.  Nobody ‚Äúwaiting‚Äù, thorough necessary tests trials make sure people wouldn‚Äôt harmed taking vaccines. Imagine scenario don‚Äôt ‚Äúwait‚Äù, barely test vaccine, administer general population, half users drop dead. Suddenly there‚Äôs new global crisis 75% world sick dead, that‚Äôs infinitely worse. mean, probably depends dictator. Wow, sincerely admire commitment guys. Meanwhile I'm trying get family vaccinate site little mile away, dad it. Israel enormous population 16s. think person learning normal school environment. people dont see wearing masks, particularly high school level majority people vaccinated, normal. Haha that‚Äôs got teaching. Press f.  think right. 5% 8% most. ton students employees vaccine school attendance employment. Get ride! Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

Hang friend. can‚Äôt wait review data 2 weeks 100% wrong don‚Äôt care tbh. introduced worse things body. I‚Äôve eaten insects consumed worse. mRNA dose can‚Äôt much harm. It‚Äôs help alleviate covid deaths sicknesses that‚Äôs good enough me. Totally agree. find solution protection outside vaccine, excluded society jobs? That's question I'm grappling with. I'd like see jurisdictions keep mask mandates place boosters roll out

It ain't happening. Sorry dude. came Americans accept again. thought mask compliance bad before? Imagine it'll like majority Covid-fatigue. Anecdotally - skeptical number, received notice state month second shot needed get second shot. option inform mistaken, instruction ignore email. I‚Äôll also add don‚Äôt know single person skipped second dose. fun one worry getting covid me‚ÄîI‚Äôm booster!

Now sun... eh, looking bit gross, honest. Didn‚Äôt know many vaccinated would rather get covid get simple booster shot. ü§Æ think shows process doesn‚Äôt work global crisis waiting literally costing lives. guess must reading much Twitter majority tweets see pretty much state isn‚Äôt option, need keep wearing masks distancing, need achieve zero COVID. know Twitter !== real life noticeable margin, reading lot taking toll me. Guess stop going much‚Ä¶ hope state end like this. Great news! Also schools places require get one, unlike since it‚Äôs EUA, means go fucking college instead paying thousands dollars maintain campus haven‚Äôt two years. Yea that‚Äôs true that‚Äôs also completely relevant we‚Äôre even close able say we‚Äôre safe place yet. Minor correction, rna type protein, nucleic acid. vaccines Pfizer releasing third shot, makes question entire thing. comes unreliable right feels like easy big money grab.

It's like reviews computer hardware, nobody posts good reviews, expect work perfectly post review. obviously difference case since people can't help it.  Damn. knew acetaminophen bad liver, take drinking, etc etc, idea extra doses send liver failure potentially kill you.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks rigorous explanation. Kinda riding Lawyer Craigs Twitter comparing last year‚Äôs summer wave one. peaked 7/18/20 started earlier, 5/30/20. always blows mind people think downsides masking, especially there‚Äôs rigorous scientific evidence actually work provide significant benefit.

Non-verbal communication lip reading important pieces communication. Language acquisition young kids likely affected blocking these. Teachers tell kids understanding facial expressions.

Masks introduced using precautionary principle case might work, despite evidence randomly controlled trials.

European countries, BC providence, many US states masking kids. There‚Äôs evidence places higher transmission rates it. going copy 3Q financial estimates Yeah.. people really want vaccine. government good job rollout. shouldn‚Äôt rely discord servers information There's consensus among top public health officials booster probably needed certainly enough data say otherwise. Pfizer vaccine companies want cash out. fooled. health officials recommend it, need it. Jezus guy dumb endgame covid endemic disease people encountering akin encountering cold flu. may ‚Äúcatch‚Äù it, may know it, may something relatively minor like cold, unlucky folks may rough days, fear death going hospital be, intents purposes, gone, people never never got vaccinated.

And treating like become norm. edited give examples I'm talking about. Pfizer filed EUA 12-15 early May got approved late May. Moderna filed EUA 12-17 early/mid June. review data getting approved early / mid July would similar timeframe Pfizer adolescent EUA said done. literally made statement: ""The CDC consistently slow adapt recommendations new data (ex. glacially slow admit outdoor transmission surface transmission rare, even data indicate many months).""

So, that's direct critique process, reflection believe....

Also, I'm ""misunderstanding"" anything (trying patronize me, lol). I'm calling others act arrogant credential, data, understanding why. essentially think recommendations bad get go, hence mention: 

""INDIVIDUALS may choose follow up-to-date data rather rely potentially outdated recommendations CDC"".

You trust them, think others shouldn't.

bar none, know them, possess knowledge know make decisions. want people follow science, practice majority Reddit always says ""trust science, trust data"" I, science teachers know, put best effort students, extremely difficult overcome raised believe. think reach point (in United States) basically shrug say unvaccinated people, ‚ÄúOh well, they‚Äôre taking chances?‚Äù

I'm already there. sure else we're supposed do. sucks, they're putting others risk, is. Public debate rational analysis require good faith arguing. stuff works things like science, falls apart public many people acting bad faith either know argue analyze things rationally care. I'd get booster tomorrow permitted. Unfortunately U.S. claim waiting evidence vaccine faltering probably late least vulnerable folks. Watching latest Israeli data hoping CDC proactive time comes. lag 3 weeks waves UK cases growing month half point. parents live there. finally able visit recently. 

I would venture say weeklong stay, myself......I saw maybe 2-3 people wearing mask. We're pretty much already kids still eligible. think we'll really position.  guess hear ‚ÄúThe original Moderna shot doesn‚Äôt work well _____ variant, I‚Äôm waiting Moderna 2.0 fully approved‚Äù guess see coming weeks. I'd glad hear predictions check back see right. According CDC stats, 70 million vaccinated Americans ~5,000 cases occurred vaccinated. 

So you‚Äôre vaccinated see concern really need. I'm hopeful, seeing Israel put 1,000+ cases today mask mandate, vaccines, give warm fuzzies. Sometimes people edit maliciously, example posting something abusive argumentative tone, editing later make seem like responding unreasonable, I'm guessing make clear edit change content tone post. -even ones support lies conspiracies gotten vaccine! Whats state agencies California coming mandates, backing and/or changing immediately after? First CAL-OSHA policy 'if even one person unvaccinated workplace, everyone wear masks,' this. 

Its almost like little bit critical thinking common sense sending mandates public? see would cause backlash districts, cities counties?  Yeah. think we‚Äôve done Bush ‚ÄúMission Accomplished‚Äù error instead dealing apples apples, dealing apples apple pears. Delta different enough original SARS2 R0 mortality standpoint treat year‚Äôs situation differently treat influenza year year.

Edit: apple pears delicious. Shaped like apple apple crunch. Tastes like juicy pear. long ago, US still leader western world.

Speak yourself! cares reasons pathetic? alternative swathes unvaccinated people filling hospitals, reasoning matter. I'm advocating wear masks flu season. That's disingenuous argument.

You brought flu, much, much less deadly disease. said here's distinct difference flu coronavirus, one really transmissible exponentially spreads environments significant vaccination mitigation, another almost eradicated basic hygeine masking. comparison two absurd.

Post vax covid less deadly flu season. would higher uptake, especially amongst old, point started discussion. ignored fact death rate approximately 250/day right already higher average flu season, death rate minimum right now, increasing months, winter. Co-worker COVID last year. get vaccinated crazy anti-vaxxer spews bullshit them.

Anyways... covid last year someone lives home tested positive. guidelines since re-exposed? Back testing case levels last year reveals 93% reduction deaths. awesome.

Until continue looking peak comparing social restrictions place time vs. social restrictions are/will place peak time.

The peak MO 7-day moving average 85 deaths per day 5.5k infections. signs indicated spread worse, political support lockdowns time low.

Best case scenario MO barreling towards 50 deaths per week. Without masks sort lockdowns? Good luck keeping number 100.

Good I've returned living like before, respect people concerned. wear mask I'm feeling weather required venue I'm in, still make effort give people space, especially they're wearing masks means they're either unvaccinated vaccinated still concerned.

I think get respect people choices. biggest source stress lately people trying force others that.  Sure, within reasonable boundaries. im reading booster shots variants coming out. got covid month ago waiting get vaccine per doctors suggestion. planned getting next month i'm wondering wait booster come since seems like advance trials one?

what guys think? would even allowed get booster got original vaccine? Unsure getting downvoted. need shift focus total case #s # hospitalizations break vaccinated/not. COVID spreads around much people, we're looking influenza pre-2020. live Florida. refuse send kids back full vaccinated forget many parents clamoring masks. think realistically, shouldn‚Äôt except vaccines kids approved emergency authorization. numbers don‚Äôt justify emergency kids 12. Full FDA approval would happen sometime 2022.

We‚Äôre still finding safety issues vaccines EUA. J&amp;J vaccine [was cause rare neurological reaction.

The danger Covid kids order one million, similar rare dangerous side effects vaccines. approve kids, need absolutely sure net benefit. Yep, I've said before. There's extremely strong correlation people religious people anti-vaxxers, really can't ignore elephant room anymore.

It's almost like religious culture culture that's easily tricked bullshit something. gonna get screwed eventually think ""not requiring hospitalization"" could work well put perspective. Breakthrough odds change significantly Delta. countries tracking. 

The vaccines work. stop spread continues mutate longer effective.

Canada studies show 88% protection symptomatic infection Delta shown 79% infection shows 64-70% infection shows 69% infection.

So land somewhere 64% 88%, likely somewhere middle.¬†

Some best studies come Singaporean contact tracers.¬†¬†Singapore high vaccination rates mRNA they‚Äôre still seeing tons asymptomatic spread even via fully-vaccinated CDC says test vaccinated¬†individual¬†unless symptomatic, even confirmed exposure, means likely missing lot cases.¬† kids 12. know that, right? sample size cases extremely small. 

166 sample size (remember, trying compare effect vaccination vs. vaccinated), sub groups broken 1 dose, 2 doses, time frames those. 

again, that's there's massive, gigantic 95% confidence range. 50% range Pfizer 1 dose! Abbott POS. all, that‚Äôs small number dead. It‚Äôs near Ebola lethal. 

A lot healthy people know careful didn‚Äôt want long covid. they‚Äôre telling us we‚Äôre going get covid anyway? see people blowing covid shots way blow flu shots. 

The funny thing is, we‚Äôre told protection infection possible via boosters. accept getting covid? Whose narrative this? literal 30% false negative rates getting detected.

PCR test 30% false negative?  respond incentives  

This punishment incentive. There's actually preliminary evidence scanning swelling point nerve responsible smell emerges brain, doctors think may cause loss smell. So, essentially backtracking wearing masks. paying attention science rethoric pushed media politicians 'vaccine two shoots,' knew going g happen opened quickly. Due misplaced false sense overconfidence people showing. Look UK, Netherlands USA. 

I sick tired common sense objectively seen anti-vaxxer fearmongering. jot understand science Delta variant changed Covid game bit 

Here Canada, many people reading B117 stats thinking everything set done, thinking Delta Delta Plus essentially same. not. yup : ( also deathly ill chronic illness, yay. ...so legal way get vaccinated. 

For children younger adults law exists since 2020, bunch adults without proper measles protection. 

People moving Germany France, Poland, Austria, etc. also easily without showing measles vaccination certificate. 

That wrote ""not quite true"". true mandatory vaccination would target everyone living Germany.    Calling ""not proof disease"" ""attempted mass murder"" pretty far beyond what's reasonable. Important question. people hospitalized we're moving closer waves influenza. Yes, obviously third dose won‚Äôt solution every immunosuppressed person. could good start help some. Let‚Äôs can. year nonsense still hearing bullshit argument. kids problems wearing masks. parents teachers ones struggling concept... pediatrician said likely fall. feel free send kid mask. well furthering end ostracizing  Unfortunately, common sense common anymore lot immunosuppressed people can't actually safely get third dose, like transplant recipients third dose resulted rejection. impossible certain. Apparently would aid mandates vaccine organizations. course individuals whatever reason waiting said approval. reality still different pretend like is. 

when communities decided ignore virus, ICU's fill up. always feel like people railing vaccine passports places requiring proof vaccination general never tried put kid public school summer camps/programs general. 

In district, public schools bar kids attendance provide proof vaccination valid medical exemption. 

Not that, schools require proof whole *slew* vaccinations, one, understand adults suddenly losing mind requiring proof *one* vaccine. I'm speaking American. opinion, EU single entity. EU's coronavirus response coordinated countries US states. big distinction I'm making separate test system traveling. comparison, US covid tests treated same. There's distinction test health concerns test traveling.

I'm glad hear countries opening free tests travelers. Seems like new ever changing, majority EU countries still charging. Netherlands opened up, France ended free pcr testing policy. symptoms? Outside staying home 24/7, there's nothing completely prevent anyone getting sick. makes uneasy. Gee, almost like taking stick actually works. Western europe going sail past US short order. US adequately vaccinated, UK experiencing surge superior vaccination numbers far fewer elderly unvaccinated. got receipts that? France anti-vax say country (Poland)? 50% people one dose still increasing. Here, vaccinations stagnated 45%. We're basically giving second doses moment everyone wanted already got jab.  Depends kid. nephew problem fact sister remind occasionally take (e.g. leave indoor environment). Spiderman mask likes run around loudly yelling spider face, almost game point.   install HEPA filter DIY style? it‚Äôs ok get ‚Äúmild‚Äù covid, fuck this? 

Because people dying non-mild cases COVID? think vast majority US already reached point. Almost anyone 12 wanted vaccine gotten it, remainder probably want it. Work home started coming end many people, schools fully open fall. locations still taking seriously vast minority. I'm sure get statistic from, way mark. Actually, [only 0.003% fully vaccinated people hospitalized Covid (I can't find data France, likely since rare detect otherwise media would frenzy it).

In France, [73% Covid deaths 75 older, staggering 91% 65 Now, [62-80% people 60 fully vaccinated rest ample chance get vaccine, chosen so, therefore choose risk life get infected. restrictions remain place anti-vaxxers? way increase vaccination elderly point would force.

Covid never going away, society needs learn live vaccinations, lockdowns. everyone chance get vaccine made choice, lockdowns travel restrictions must entirely abandoned. lot flu covid dominant, taking precautions like masks distancing. absolutely coexist without things.

There 100 percent vaccines. That's important many people get vaccinated possible. I‚Äôm American would really see much rise received full approval? That‚Äôs mainly antivaxxer excuse doubt much weight even unvaxxed people Decades horrible science education, abandonment secularism, decline discourse holding us back.

When pfizer gets approval, arms twisted, many.  Even assuming data reported accurate (which always case self-reported data), correlation causation. significantly attention given novel vaccines vaccine past 40 years - reporting easier ever due internet. Someone far likely report death COVID vaccine flu vaccine even death completely unrelated - simply novel interesting - due ongoing misinformation campaign around them. 

If give 300 million vaccines 160 million people - primarily older adults - would expect tens thousands people die within weeks receiving vaccine unrelated causes. 

What *does* kill people fear, uncertainty, doubt misinformation like spreading. Ah thank you! Somewhat vague story WSJ: 

""J&amp;J, AstraZeneca Explore Covid-19 Vaccine Modification Response Rare Blood far research understanding clotting events gotten they're gearing reengineer vaccine avoid it? Macron failed nation. This. Seeing arguments non-vaxxed side, many been/will continue discouraged every sign vaccine bringing us closer normal. thought rush get vaccine work well enough curb spread. They'll point highly vaccinated areas surging evidence.  
Cynical, want get rest people vaccinated, there's got carrot.  There's element forum like anyone 'worried' covid, wanting take precautions. can‚Äôt make decisions something evidence for. ‚ÄúBut new problem 10 years‚Äù based guess science-based decision making. 

Other respiratory viruses also lingering side effects eventually go away. four commonly circulating coronavirus strains cause common colds long term effects. One caused similar pandemic 1889. It‚Äôs endemic. British government reported thousands ''breakthrough infections'' know people got heads can't catch covid would whole U.S. COVID rates look like unvaccinated states nation? logic doesn‚Äôt hold up. Fingers crossed get proposed third dose, works like it‚Äôs supposed to. what's taking long? said we'd approvals months ago... EU inspect factory, we're talking administering EU? 

If they're saying different factories may produce slightly different products, also requiring inspections approval Pfizer's manufacturing US allowing people vaccinated vaccines made there? Obviously lmao entirely possible. tried one. Worth noting Soumya Swaminathan (who one quoted Reuters advising mix match) [has said advising individuals public health agencies okaying it. 

The Reuters article (which says ""dangerous trend"" *citizens* making decision, goes ahead misrepresents said headline. ""getting this"" traditional sense, COVID endemic disease require yearly vaccinations like flu reposted ton. Mods‚Ä¶? makes think that? believe blood clots vaccines less prevalent women deal using anticonception pills.

Its good look vaccine kills people country disease prevent. today 2nd person year died covid Australia case. (now equal 2 each).

Also blood clots caused contraceptives dont tend serious exactly equivalent. 

We outbreak one city now. age range AZ lowered (over 40) risk catching covid potential harm comes makes equation worth while. 

In rest country, cases, AZ recommended 60s.  posted times everyday. quick search you‚Äôll find lot info, answer no. medically indicated recommended time.  Anecdotal. I‚Äôve 1 vaccine dose caught last week. Didn‚Äôt cough extreme fatigue, aching joints, excruciating headache, breath constantly. week work normally work home. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm back 75% health. decline fine bedridden 30 minutes. mild, genuinely one worst experiences life, would recommend even young, fit vaccinated. saw Homerun derby, Japan, mind stopped. 10,000s people, beer, closed spaces, hugging kissing. CRAzZZzY!!! seen anyone show evidence variants 'less lethal' except vaccinated individuals. I'd careful assuming overall hospitalizations deaths solely due variants lacking punch. deaths time low US everything open back normal. feels, try different kind. KN95 stay totally away nose mouth barely feel face. Plus offer really good protection. intent beginning put vaccines full process people would able accuse FDA taking shortcuts potentially releasing something unexpected negative effects.

Of course appear work well, arm chair vaccination specialists whining delays full approval. win situation, anyone understands it, Fauci. Almost everything read long-term effects, i.e. long haul COVID, issues shown unvaccinated people. I'm sure people get acting like breakthrough infections causing swathes long COVID. Looking outsiders perspective seeing videos Texas compared places like Cali, tell I'd rather live. Young people eligible vaccines Europe yet.  SARS-Cov-2 mutate quick enough generate variant complete immune evasion overnight. likely everyone OK current vaccines get mild boosting natural breakthrough infections resulting mild disease. higher risk may need boosters may may tweaked currently circulating variants.

The media overhyping variants. Sometimes, even best forged documents get pwnd data contains. eg (probably issue case) PCR test Feb 30, 2020? Pretty dodgy. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

""real"" boxing? No. got ass bed moving days. days, I'd supplement kettlebells, steel mace, TRX, resistance bands, etc. None things required expensive equipment lots space. point impression world ever equal? cases almost entirely unvaccinated Got it. Fully understand. deserve votes.

Just original poster posted question, jumped conclusion formed picture someone got first shot felt really rotten, perhaps heart palpitations, really skeptical get 2nd shot. really done that.

There multiple reasons cannot take vaccine all, leaves vulnerable position control.... Bottom line - hope way pandemic. every single human being. don‚Äôt see correlation no?! Watch damn video! It‚Äôs self explanatory. Now, unless youve head hole last 18months lockdowns based CASES DEATHS. cases. Yet recording recorded incorrectly. Purposely impose lockdowns? don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated &amp; work healthcare, nobody care contracted covid &amp; followed guidelines I‚Äôm covid denier. fact hospital admissions deaths recorded way inflates numbers. 

Deny want it‚Äôs video. Straight mouth Irish health officers (the people 
Mandated lockdowns here) I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre aware Ireland still strict restrictions regarding travel hospitality despite fact extremely compliant taking vaccines. They're already saying this, seems fundamental lack understanding part approval process ""rushed"" (it research beaurocratic nonsense).

I also wonder many currently taking taken medications went years approvals, recalled anyway. Remember anti-depressant drugs came early 2000s quietly disappeared? Well turned years research testing prescribed general population work cases made people's depression worse. happens, reason stop trusting modern medicine (or maybe people, statistics seems beyond grasp people thought)

I also wonder many people get vaccinated risk dying low go buy lottery tickets ""there's chance"". entire life listened Cuban News buddy hear you. friends unvaccinated. never took pandemic seriously lives never changed beyond travel plans cancelled. pretty much understand (they kids kids older chosen vaccinate them). hard talking now. Vaccination uptake vulnerable *really* high UK, they've fully-vaccinated time now. Mississippi.

Parents across nation reckless exposing kids. Go grocery store anywhere observe many kids 12 wearing masks. Even high vaccine countries still huge unvaccinated populations. still slightly fucked, definitely completely fine. Sounds much like placebo effect I'm glad they're feeling better. Australia? everyone less well well-adapted lineage, older people vaccinated badly begin with. People refused maintain pre-Vaccine precautions. sad. question is, never ‚Äúbeat‚Äù coronavirus. we‚Äôve come point vaccines, we‚Äôre told go mask less long we‚Äôre vaccinated, there‚Äôs way expect society adopt masks forever right? totally get family important thing earth you, certainly exact problem comes flu, right? lifestyle needing ensure don‚Äôt get infected change covid hit? Maybe I‚Äôm misinformed, I‚Äôm impression we‚Äôll basically treat like flu point onward. 

My point simply, point, need okay vaccinated people mask less. sick second shot. plenty sick days booster shots, lot people, especially service industry, hard time getting time off. narrow population unvaccinated, [covid bad ever getting County's COVID-19 cases 41.1%; California cases surge country, 43 states cases latest week week case counts rose 40 counties previous week. worst increases prior week's pace Los Angeles, Santa Clara Riverside California, 282 people reported dead COVID-19 week ending Sunday. week that, 158 people reported dead.

That's decline. believe Cuban propaganda sure lol vaccinated nanny one option less exposure money less time, it‚Äôs much trust one person (and benefits social side day care). feel though, shit LONG isolating people older kids vaccinated back normalcy. Like don‚Äôt fault friends stayed home got vaccines live little, that‚Äôs family‚Äôs reality. trying sound rude definitely generalizing there. mean we? almost community US thinks homogenously public policy. plenty friends Vermont, one came last week went bars got drunk. cough anyone's faces. vaccinated really care. get sick, stay home then. Hospitalizations deaths still decreasing despite recent surge. really call surge compared happened last Fall. Countries high vaccination rates aren‚Äôt slightly fucked though - they‚Äôre completely fine? Huh! That's awesome considering another point view. Rare. would say Sweden still limited supply, probably long. close end that. people already anti-vaxxers vaccines around years covid. using 'not approved' approach gets normal people nervous. go something else mentioned minds already made up. Taiwan's Death/Case Ratio high? Even accounting lag 2 weeks, still 5-10% range. School Board meeting week live, bunch antimask parents organized group, ridiculous. One woman actually claimed masks give urinary tract infections, facial deformities, need dental surgery.

One mom brought kid spoke cried saying masks reason anything past year, ""their stupid.""

Like half went antivax rants, wearing masks, crowded room. state School Grounds, unvaccinated, supposed wear mask. 

They constantly verbally attacked Teachers reason existing mandate state. talk policy actually enforce it.

There faculty security guards entrance school kid goes last year enforcing masks pickup/drop off. Made parents go back car get mask. absolutely enforced mask rule students/faculty also parents pickup drop Russian government surreptitiously eats crow... Nah guy pathetic. person cares mother can‚Äôt keep steady job. UK real-world data Pfizer Delta (you're welcome, got plague-riddled to) [96% reduction baseline risk obviously extraordinarily, unbelievably good odds, going small number super fucking unlucky people happens to.

It's totally reasonable point rare is, also think good kind stuff like implying people say got super fucking unlucky lying. responses pandemic economically unsustainable. Whether right time end restrictions later change fact we're reaching point can't afford anyway. young children, especially children younger 5 years old, risk serious complications higher flu compared COVID-19. However, serious COVID-19 illness resulting hospitalization death occur even healthy young young children, teens adolescents COVID-19 likely Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Children (MIS-C), rare severe complication COVID-19. However, adolescents, risk serious COVID-19 illness less children younger 5.

did live constant fear flu prior covid?  not, there's reason now. would point even be? lmao ok Delta wrench truly fucked up. Without close point daycare was‚Ä¶ something consider, rates low enough, staff vaccinated masked. seemingly causing way breakthrough cases impacting kids more, it‚Äôs again. hired teacher hours week basically outdoor child care, better nothing, we‚Äôre really gonna hang till vaccines available kids. problem UK probably approaching maximum take-up comes vaccines. 87% adults received least one dose, 66% two doses. remaining 13% adults probably never going get vaccinated one reason another. mid August vast majority single-dosers got second doses well, brining us approx 87% adult coverage.

We vaccinating children 18, there's room vaccination coverage growth mid August.

As others said, best open time wave summer rather Autumn Winter. now, there's **never** good time, unless take decision vaccinate children (who make big chunk population). I‚Äôm saying anyone else definitively wrong I‚Äôm taking skeptical role saying can‚Äôt know anything certainty. places burden proof directly anyone thinks say something greater degree certainty. People back weren‚Äôt made psychotic internet propaganda actually likely know someone personally affected Polio. youngest starting Kindergarten August. wearing mask since start covid last year problem keeping go Haha yeah asthma history, taking COVID seriously. bad kid I'm screw around find COVID me. start cause death argument, build case based admission practices? Brain cells? CDC recommended third shot, Pfizer. CDC atm recommends two doses, reviewing studies third. want source google various therapy plans, I'm library. Remember, supporting someone else tried prove wrong, needs provide sources, prove wrong. anti-vaxxers already best give Polio new chance life again. fucking disturbing parents willingly placing children line fire highly preventable diseases they're convinced cause That's fair, problem virus spread/cases are. fact, masking order state anymore schools can't require mask thing middle school 95. Spaghetti straps bra straps ""distracting boys"" really pervy male teachers see you‚Äôre saying. It‚Äôll definitely interesting see something like winter surge amongst unvaccinated communities reacted general population. really hope doesn‚Äôt lead us shutdowns sort, long areas high vaccination rates (I think city hit 70%+) remain open let dealing surges make decisions. 

Localized shutdowns probably used start, especially places like Texas shut NY big surge, time Texas saw real surge, already fatigued lockdowns. Localizing nuclear options like shutdowns mode thinking moving forward hope. ... get delta surprise *(and political+economical disaster)* answer hypothetical question would yours.

I still think punished harder risking scenario happen. friend ranted vaccines months. One time asked didnt argue even though quite obviously pro vaccine. 

Simple, soon even mildly inconvenienced get it. like people rant new technology, people actually hold out. got 1 month me. People predictable. sorry hear that. üé∂ Let ~~eagle~~ cases soooooar! Privately funded schools would exempt.

We several friends enrolled kids private middle/highschool kids didnt wear mask returned full time in-person learning months earlier rest districts here. Missouri checking in. counties lower 20% population vaccinated, ICU population SW MO hospitals already highest whole pandemic  Earlier Fauci affirmed Indian vaccine - Covaxin's ability neutralize 617 variant successfully. FDA rejects Covaxin's emergency use authorization citing insufficient data advised apply full license. happening now? FDA biased towards certain decisions Fauci playing silly? Sounds pretty German innit diseases defeated already making gradual comeback number years thanks anti vaccination rhetoric spreading toxic mommy communities. Ever since whole, vaccines cause autism conspiracy, we've seeing uptick cases number long forgotten diseases vaccinate children against.  allow Department Defense make mandatory military. Az really unpopular country. making 50 or40 million 

And gov decided donate 20 million covax.

Lots people waiting Pfizer. feel like year constant corona virus news, shouldn‚Äôt many left don‚Äôt know that, whether want not. Guess that‚Äôs happens lots people afraid vaccine pandemic, people power deliberately encourage conspiracy theories cheap way win publicity coming say this. People Ontario, am, screeching reopening phases move faster. phase 3 Friday watch second dose momentum doesn‚Äôt go tubes soon indoor dining back menu.  get it. decide quit job getting vaccine concern theirs?

If get tetanus shot every 5 years I'm work example. employer going risk employing me. agree you; think kept things closed long futile hope could prevent waves, instead learning worse diseases managed keep society much open (e.g. remote school possible?).

I think we'll see shutdowns scope, part they're pointless: vaccinated people never going take precautions took last year, unless want send police force them.

But governments have, maybe without fully realizing it, committed idea normalcy depends consistently low COVID case numbers. I'm sure plan COVID case numbers can't stay consistently low. 

I guess we'll see happens UK Israel, sort become test cases rich countries.  knew pilot flat earther... get sorts professions, even makes sense. story since it‚Äôs fully approved. knew that, feel need say it‚Äôs emergency approved somehow negated point? swear, iron lungs become thing southern states. Stan Turkmenistan.  Okay point leadership come together public get everyone vaccinated? I'm seeing young kids stores caregiver shopping kids unmasked! 
Yes hear guardian choice excuses, reality do. Plenty shops curbside home delivery.

Lets get everyone vaccinated protect unvaccinated then. Yes include get masks back on. wonder country American from. Probably Canada. Brazil. Nah, sounds like Belize. Well, doesn‚Äôt matter, it‚Äôs single entity anyway. impression France longer full right body since today, maybe freedom part French core principles anymore

Vaccination many older viruses already mandatory France, breaking news freedom stupid things body already restricted like freedom attack people, cases causes harm society.

If think that‚Äôs bad thing can‚Äôt help guess don‚Äôt understand french core principles mention. Cases irrelevant. 

It‚Äôs severity cases matter. 

If vaccines work we‚Äôre told, non issue. Maybe. Get better soon! Europe? Naw. Places like Spain still seeing massive uptake.  Tennessee citizen 

Or Tennesseetizen parent 2 12s, cannot wait get vaccinated safer. clearly thing full approval would stort  far tell North Western Europe vaccine available anyone wants it. It‚Äôs choice people make get vaccinated. 

If you‚Äôre saying vaccine doesn‚Äôt work - well honest, that‚Äôs bad. Life goes one way - taken enough time. 

If individuals still concerned risks don‚Äôt wish vaccinated, every right continue practicing additional hygiene preventative measures even self isolate. 

But it‚Äôs time governments put back individuals decide much risk wish take. Get better soon! saw that. person hero anti-vax Facebook moms. I‚Äôm struggling come way describe without getting automodded know what. Mind explaining one different many others routine?

Like, stuff groundbreaking, adding one many required.

I'll getting yearly checkup work fall I'll required get vaccine thing happen step rusty nail.(don't know english name it, tetanus?).  feel like fear mongering tactics get unvaccinated ones get vaccinated. frustrating see people come excuse excuse take chance vaccine proven effective. fear life got back thanks vaccination soon taken away blame fact unvaccinated ones making ending pandemic easier. causing lose faith lately. idea want inject ivermectin discussion. thought long discredited. Jacobson v Massachusetts

Hey thanks interesting history fact! aware case like existed. Maybe that's trick; ""I respect decision, need prepared eventuality...""  Dis di language option chosen. 

;) wrongful termination case win

Wouldn't argument centered around fact medical professional speaking legal matters official capacity concerning medical matters put wrongful termination case rest? know many countries somewhat careful even expert particular area try give advice connected field directly fall within scope expertise. case, giving legal advice medical professionals, medical professional legal expert.  sub schizophrenic? hear voices? Problem long several millions remains unvaccinated create pool virus mutate point become fully immune existing vaccine.

Logically donation make sense, end many people want countries trash, matter good trash. It'll lasting negative impact sending bad message. Intention important vs people receiving hands perceive it. rumor people believe stronger truth, sadly. 
See CDC link. reality few.  best thing can't sue government side effects death forced take it. Great stuff. patient 90 years old, likely immunocompromised. Ooooofff. Heard faculty people college professors somewhat annoyed masks. college students won‚Äôt follow restrictions well. Lmfao point comment make excuses people. get point, college students always option move online school want return person yet. point, much worse force students stay online, especially sky high tuition prices. anti maskers anti vaxxers gonna die first much  Johnson Johnson around March/April bc that‚Äôs one job offered. Well that's going happen whether want not. got move on. true, lot people vaccinated still high risk getting sick covid, patients medications suppress immune system. ‚ÄúHospitalizations 24% time period‚Äù does! Especially plan carrying disease! We've got pretty close everyone wants vaccine one now.

Open damned borders. Healthcare worker here. me. gladly show booster every six months. Ill set day get semi annual teeth cleaning. vaccine get around long ago get it? unvaccinated kids, wear mask around kids. unvaccinated kids, wear mask around kids. vaccinated kids, wear mask around kids. vaccinated kids, need wear mask. pretty simple. Vaccines prevent hospitalizations death, got vaccine there. CDC data already showed 0.003% vaccinated people ended hospital. People enough time get vaccine wanted one, end hospital fault choosing to. immunocompromised protection vaccine therefore rely herd immunity protect them? anti-vaxxers running around directly harms quality life. That‚Äôs like literally saying: Seoul bans people getting wet pool‚Äîmight well don‚Äôt go gyms short version. 

Awsome DR Fiscus sends letter state healthcare providers letting know states mature minor doctrine. Sen Janice Bowling (R) loses mind. 

Dr Fiscus 25th, yes read that, 25th person leave top position since pandemic. 

I mean, cannot make crap up. think driving France? American I've told partisan issue, I'm curious way are. take risks everyday, driving coming contact cold flu viruses. believe realistic reasonable live completely risk-free lifestyle. would reasoning. good idea False Considering bad outlook start year, Trudeau absolutely Apollo 13'd this. immune system work same. Anti-vaxers making choice directly stifle quality life. deserve treated equally. still choice get vaccinated choice effect lives others. want protect society say can't apart it.  Blame redirected. 
Think nonlinearly, can. 
 Actually, think it, US quite motivation sabotage batch vaccine distributed China. lot chance Taiwan. 
 
So, think nonlinearly. 
But choose use defend position China. Yes CDPH issued statement today. They‚Äôll reopening üò∑ Lol relax, ‚Äúpull through‚Äù, society fine. Hey humanity, it‚Äôs time die, guess. Check data UK. Cases surging hospitalizations deaths remain extremely low. vaccine works, vulnerable people protected correlation cases deaths broken,and that's exactly what's happening.  It‚Äôs (EU) trailed bit got enough logistics back up. should, [kids need schools need isolation. Part reason haven‚Äôt gotten past problem yet give people way much freedom whatever hell want, regardless wether affects around them.

Certain things mandatory like get us back track progressing Covishield still accepted EU (some countries accepting it, all). bureaucracy issue resolved soon, send additional false message people reluctant begin with.

I tried share millions vaccinated it, work. Especially Pfizer Canada, harm credibility... Yes , it‚Äôs click bait inaccurate title.

Also article :

Some studies shown infected Covid vaccination produce much less virus unvaccinated, reducing risk passing virus others.  long term issues young going youo keep locked decade decide long term effects going be?

We're already seeing kids school problems socialising, problems reading people's faces (because masks hide whether someone smiling not). People's education ruined. Kids ability make new friends ruined. they've locked 18 months.

You might think, well important children make friends next decade, cope imprisoned home alone work long term effects covid decade are. *does* matter.

Imprisoning 15 million kids couple anecdotal stories long covid grossly irresponsible. much broader view.. sense vested interest helping world. would preferable countries donate supply mismatched vaccine doses administer them.. tagt also rationale explained statement back anti vaxxers latched onto vaccinating children.. it‚Äôs it‚Äôs unsafe, it‚Äôs countries suffering greatly still can‚Äôt get vaccines all. Okay appreciate it. mainly wondering sit floor spend time pet dog. I'll careful guess haha. Thanks. Update : half them. no-brainer? they? Canada use find risky compared vaccine, let send poor keep good one. expect people end do? 

Take have? choice take better one. don't, don't. Canada used AZ choice too.

If nation want take hope goes somewhere used instead. lot countries would gladly take vaccines. They're highly effective blood clot risks well worth considering dangerous COVID is. Got-dang youthful rebellion kids gettin‚Äô vaccinated ‚Äòn hwat-not! recently received lot negative comments still wearing mask, become noticeable since even comes people (or even overly) serious taking risks. 

For personally, it‚Äòs annoying often forget take off, even home, I‚Äòve become used it. comments getting annoying tbh, especially since wearing mask doesn‚Äòt affect others significant manner.

Is think don‚Äòt trust wear mask what? Damn. We're already this? i.e. alluded ""being healthy"" mean specifically respect covid? lot ""healthy"" people died Maybe I'll ask question thought dumb too.

When started hearing mutations transmissible, thought: Could release manmade harmless version coronavirus that's even transmissible would outcompete dangerous ones?

But question OP . . . understand one could exist time. need US. always breakthrough cases. doesn‚Äôt mean vaccine ineffective disagree. come people's immune system fight easily (asymptomatic), get mild symptoms, get serious symptoms, die?

Obviously there's factor equation play. asking factors are. Without good numbers many non-hospitalized vaccinated people end longterm heart, lung, damage Delta variant don‚Äôt see harm prepared booster shots. guesstimate 3-5%. roughly rare hospitalizations plus deaths. Oh yea would make sense would go . think article posted sun Florida highest total amount new cases well. Okay Lots Staten Island. one shocked people get shot. shocked. Super awesome lot come shore weekends. Maybe stay home benny trash! Unless hearing test after....... saying. Like do. shout listen music loud. Peace. Speak yourself. don‚Äôt get flu shots.  Yeah that's exactly it. took massive early lead stopping Covid really effectively (at massive cost anyone that's either stuck outside Australia, definitely think right call). leaders broke hands patting back, are, drunk pantless dicks hands starting line, rest world 3 laps ahead. unfortunate media managed successfully damage reputation vaccine, despite rare blood clotting issues incredibly efficacious. hope time fears subside; soon enough countries recognize WHO-approved vaccines border passage. understand hesitancy Sinovac lesser extent Sputnik, anyone two AZ doses allowed entry country. administered millions UK residents, hundreds thousands Canadians.   post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

At UDLA, students immunized COVID-19. expected reach 16,000 registered races. Photo: Galo Paguay / EL COMERCIO
Valeria Heredia (I)

Today begins phase three 9/100 Vaccination Plan , called Contagion.

Its objective inoculate people 48 16 years old; situation mobility. run September 5.

The number inhabitants age range 8.5 million, according population projections National Institute Statistics Censuses ( INEC ).

This represents 68.7% 12.4 million, part target population identified Ministry Public Health (MSP).

The dynamics similar one took place previous weeks, is, day age group served. example, today people 48 years old; tomorrow 47; Wednesday, 46, etc.
On weekends, latecomers may come, is, make assigned day.

This done 26th month. date, modality change again: two days age, said Jos√© Ruales , vice minister.

The Portfolio planned open new vaccination points. Quito, unification, went 51 24 sites. But, week before, long lines campuses, including Bicentenario Universidad Salesiana, north, Paulo VI Consejo Provincial schools, south.

Therefore, decision enable five points, located universities : Cat√≥lica, De las Am√©ricas, UTE, San Francisco Hemisferios.

La Cat√≥lica reopens today 08:00 17:00, 10 brigades. capacity 1,500 people per day. ""The processes simplified speed inoculation,"" explained Silvana Ortiz , Dean Nursing.

In UDLA, hand, already organizing open space public, Monday Friday. Currently works weekends.

On Saturday Sunday, example, immunization students carried out. doses scheduled applied 16,000 young people majors, including graduate students. done Granados campuses UDLA Park, confirmed Marlena Le√≥n, academic vice-rector.

""With initiatives, progressive return face-to-face classes expected.""

The university also provides immunization former graduates. 50,000 citizens.

In UTE, hand, students begin vaccinated Tuesday , alphabetical order. USFQ supported placement doses workers tourism sector.

To qualify points, MSP support National Electoral Council ( CNE ) Red Cross.

Diana Atamaint , president CNE, recalled made 4,000 electoral precincts available become vaccination sites. ‚ÄúEveryone available. depends Health operational capacity: personnel supplies ‚Äù.

In sense, Portfolio coordinated Quito Health Secretariat hiring 40 vaccinators. go new sites.

The Ministry Health also strengthened alliances private companies. Adelca, example, enabled vaccination center sports center, located Al√≥ag, since June 7. week reach 5,000 people.

The firms also immunizing workers. Grupo DK - brings together shopping centers Quicentro Granados Plaza - began administration doses last Thursday. Megamaxi same.

For V√≠ctor √Ålvarez, president College Physicians Pichincha , vaccination wrong start, progressing better pace. ‚ÄúThere adequate process clear objectives. organization still needs adjusted ‚Äù.

Therefore, calls greater openness unions. help logistics volunteers immunization. ""Months ago managed inoculate 4,000 doctors.""

Epidemiologist Daniel Simancas agrees peer. achieve goal vaccinating 9 million citizens it
is essential doses CanSino . announced 700,000 arrive next August.

The reason one required. ""This reach largest number population face arrival strong variants, Delta (identified India). sadly not. I'm living first hand Africa (I'm Canadian) people want AZ. heard countries restricting use, they'll send stuff want use population.

Consequence everyone spoke prefer vaccine AZ. Especially covid basically seen thing affecting mostly weak foreigners (they deaths, barely existing health system unaffected, morgue saw noticeable increase, etc.)

So news condescending donations help making millions wanting rich countries trash vaccine (how perceived here).

So heavy travel restriction approach great there's covid country, like Australia recently. However, room like piece dry wood fire, walls doors helpful before.

Social distancing good people can't sit still nafurally, entropy always wins that's temporary solution 

Therefor gotta vaccinate people wet metaphorical wood pieces. However, letting vaccinated people travel good reason. Bringing wet wood tip population towards vaccinated majority (this fairly small number try compare countries would make difference popular cities vaccinated immigrants would favour). 

The key high vaccine proportion heard immunity. broadly speaking, higher vax/non-vax ratio + people still safer lower ratio less people. also means population gets less sick said disease vaccinated people likely taking ventilator beds/resources. Higher rates vaccination means able tolerate higher covid numbers. Look Ireland example, hospitalisation numbers way lower proportionately numbers last year.

The scary thing there's big non-vax cohort, basically covids playground. interplay vax non vax people covid leads variants could eventually overpower current vaccines.

Doesn't warnings vaccines imply person know possible rare side effects choose himself/herself whether he/she wants take vaccine not? listed warnings go side side mandatory vaccinations law?

Vaccination becoming mandatory, explicitly, implicitly like need take vaccine travel, need take vaccine come office, etc. imply disregard given warnings? got AstraZeneca first shot Biontech/Pfizer second. recommended Germany AZ first immunologic data showed much higher antibody titer mix. also slightly better 2x Biontech/Pfizer.   bioNTech vaccine, safe bioNTech vaccine world.

I'm saying skepticism correct, governments abuse trust past blame peoples skepticism. would go that? think resources pull project magnitude exist countries? 

Even way world could devote year everyone's life immeasurable resources towards eradicating Covid, would unlikely worth (not mention would likely spread animals again). done history, took decades globally coordinated efforts, disease far, far deadlier Covid. Immunocompromised individuals small minority majority, vaccines silver bullet covid. Pfizer worrying booster lot developing world doesn‚Äôt vaccine? Please refer comment regarding different type antibody test. Sure, I'd agree that. ask people done this? supply issues?
Here Norway either get Pfizer Moderna shots, mixing. people got mixed vaccines ones got AZ back january/februar, couldnt get second dose one blood clot issue. outside, cases spreading outside? look 1976 swine flu. understand skepticism. I'm saying skepticism correct, governments abuse trust past blame peoples skepticism. Agreed friend. think won‚Äôt undo it. still much better spot last year way restrictions. ~70% anti-vax sentiment absolutely baffles me. teacher country got johnson vaccine 30 days ago.She tested positive infected teachers 10 sure that?

 also 30 yo man got mrna shots still got covid, headache,sore throat, bone pain.

Do make conclusions can't sure vaccines.Perhaps reduce transmission little. false. 100% there's still strong correlation intelligence education that, income.

Sorry, no. correlation intelligence education, touted many people, artifact IQ measured. IQ tests designed measure things generally taught school, people past mistook intelligence. exist IQ tests try general education independent, hard design thus expensive buy. So, people use definitely IQ test websites.

Also, lot European countries, family income education weakly correlated. Thanks school free nearly free all. Regardless, help way vaccine hesitant. probably also making mixed vaccines feel unsure nervous it‚Ä¶ need clarify specific ASAP.  don‚Äôt want click link, study herpes virus vaccines chickens 2015 IMO troll here. CDC website says people can't actually get vaccinated. also says people underlying conditions get vaccine. I'll try explain.

The required antibody test tests IgM opposed ""usual"" antibody test targets IgG. IgM produced early stage infection goes body produces IgG neutralize virus. positive IgM indicates there's chance active infection early stage. think additional layer security trying filter asymptomatic pre-symptomatic cases case viral load low PCR test detect.

Things changed vaccines rolled out, since vaccinated traveler may report positive protein IgM despite infected (especially vaccinated close departure). N protein IgM test came in. mRNA virus vector vaccines carries information body produce protein corresponding antibodies. Therefore, positive N protein IgM indicate person came contact virus recently. hand, negative N protein IgM indicates positive protein IgM likely result vaccine instead virus itself.

Also, yes, got inactivated virus vaccine board flight long provide negative PCR test plus proof vaccination.

Hope clarify things bit.

P.S.: ""destination within destination"". need test results able board plane. separate tests done upon arrival, something else. [Relevant should. Canada follows suit now. Like, know, Palestine. right here. might antigen vs Pcr. Also incubation time. someone lives France great news imho. France pretty big antivax problem. 

My wife fully vaccinated know two adults also, friends doctors vaccinated now. 

I number conversations parents sons school pick many *really* getting vaccine. parents-in-law (also France) blows mind wife's mum 70s dad 80s basically lived inside home past 16 months anything. 

I glad Macron clear this. need it. Although know lot people going react going pretty. doubt Calgary see serious short term spike. vaccinations prevent super spreading, we‚Äôre low season. Colder weather schools coming back real test sure understand either.

Spike positive long time vaccinated. Nucleocapsid proteins show 2 weeks infection last several months, sign active infection.

It make sense either positive results disqualifying travel... Actually positive would mean vaccinated past infection, essentially highest COVID immunity get.
You might want double check requirements worried about. warning *policy*, science. Netherlands chance? believe tried (I Dutch currently living there) failed people started using qr codes people knew get tested resulted enormous spikes cases last days. link studies? cite NYT source. ever correct? lol anyone would opt j&amp;j beyond point.  UK today currently #2 cases (34000) # 57 (6 deaths) terms deaths. That's due UK insane testing well extremely high vaccination levels among vulnerable ~ 95%. 

Cases peak 2 weeks Euros schools close. lifting remaining restrictions mostly nightclubs make much impact given social distancing Euros. know get lot self-indulgent trolls days, based recent post history I'm willing believe honest question. Okay, could indication right? LA. tested negative covid damn ive never coughed phelgm life. like Florida bizzaro California..our schools mask optional hell knows. Obesity airborne explains lot. thought diet lack exercise. 38.8 fully vaccinated, 26.9% hade one shot. 64.7% total.
As understand mostly spreads young unvaccinated group. understanding advised mix manufactures. Well easiest explanation would NDP power there. really depends countries able get access vaccines though.

For example Canada passed US ago % first doses going pass % second doses week. look stats isolation fairly similar.

But difference Canada really started roll 2nd doses big time last two weeks (2nd appointments open book anyone 18+). US hand vaccines available easily months now, much populace simply refuses get vaccinated.

So question is, France's rollout like timeline wise, compare EU countries? part EU UK obviously much faster. Pretty much, hang there, get ! Good decision. Yeah don‚Äôt see happy ending unfortunately Every asshole high school joined military wanted go war. would talk openly wait shoot Iraqis. sure believe whatever want makes feel better part institution.

The reason Israel able vaccinate big chunk population insanely fast special deal cut Pfizer. exchange getting early access, would turn entire country experiment 10 million people. Pfizer access medical data, use fully assess vaccine time respond rest world.

For reason, confident Pfizer‚Äôs predictions vaccine come true. better test ground analysis vaccine, place earth early mass adoption.

The UK fast relative places, initially mostly using Astra Zeneca shot, different vaccine. Pfizer Moderna vaccines good job targeting antibodies, immune response subsides fastest coronaviruses.

I admit opinion. think set remind post, turn Pfizer vaccines indeed turn become less effective six months elsewhere, too. think it‚Äôs matter time countries catch Israel terms know. vaccines 100% effective Good enough everyone move lives.

Someone correct i'm wrong. life line works lot better water yourself.

I thought originally myself, reflection analogy good one given tendency virus mutate. entirely possible new strain could emerge unprotected population renders protection population less effective.

Or relate back analogy; might reach shore find eroding quickly away. Hopefully not, Delta given hint could happen. Thailand's main vaccine still AstraZeneca. vaccinated AZ dose 1. shhh, let Sinophobic crowd knows that. mean carriers still spread variant? They're making choice body, nothing wrong NHS details: Kids/teens get series 5 doses provides good long term immunity.

Edit add booster get pregnancy combo vaccine it‚Äôs mainly given give baby immunity whooping cough (pertussis) vaccinated. Yes Thanks sharing that.

Every year start term see girls bare midriffs, guys unbuttoned Hawaiian shirts undershirt, etc.

However keep rooms 67 degrees, outside weather highs low 70s, month school everyone's decided hoodie pants better showing lots skin.

So truth dress code enforcement ""deal cold want to, choice.""

The dress code I've ever seen enforced one vulgar words/graphics printed clothing. Yes, original comment talked places low vaccination rates. young Netherlands effectively act relatively independent sub population low vaccination rate, fits prediction 500% increase. go back brought restrictions again. wealthy well connected snatching doses since January. think wouldn‚Äôt get booster? Lol.  No, Pfizer significantly better AZ, per UK study data. 88% vs 60%. Don‚Äôt spread misinformation. Pfizer also stored higher temperatures. None ‚Äúleaked‚Äù emails said thag.

I thought saying kids wear masks would make crappy year. confusing.

I'm concerned teachers juggle playing mask police. kid wearing mask properly, continues wear right, kid get sent class? eventually lead suspension?

If safety goal, feel kids following safety protocols consequences. knows administrators follow consequences. Consult doctor. People cannot provide medical advice here. I'll give benefit doubt here, continue post anti-vax rhetoric, banned. really true? I've never heard that. deaths time low. true. Hospitalizations way down

Surely strong source say false ? Mine readily available health data  American govt needs step take care people.  Well always going case, CDC screwed badly here. idea rolled back mask requirement vaccinated people would somehow magically make covidiots get vaccinated. course didn‚Äôt, stopped societal pressure wear damn mask. 

Between that, deciding bother follow breakthrough cases unless results hospitalization death (right delta started come US) refusing acknowledge delta might problem even us vaccinated‚Ä¶.I lost lot faith organization. get take first shot skip second. seems go vaccine skepticism get least one unless side effects severe. general forgetfulness need follow-up providers? Ok. I‚Äôll simplify: it‚Äôs likely literally anything vaccine related vaccine.

Perhaps covid test order. Flu, cold, rsv, etc. donated straight factory? saw comment day saying meaning Canadas received doses donated. Yes. vaccinated see lower hospitalization rate compare wasn't. don‚Äôt call carriers? Typhoid Mary asymptomatic. Consult medical professional, cannot provide medical advice here.  zero doctors medical researcher would say vaccine. live Chile government vaccinated 50% population Sinovac. currently around 70% total population vaccinated, look cases dropping like crazy, vaccine works. False.

(Checks history - Conspiracy, Conservative, confused‚Ä¶reality denying idiot confirmed) Waiting patiently answer words response. know hospital worker refused get vaccine point. Hard core Pentecostal. hospital week made vaccine mandatory. person apparently going request religious exemption.

It's BS. hope doctor sit review shoot anything medical reason. religious objects vaccines? vaccines. contains stem cells? Kay not. issues? getting shot get door. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions.

I've seen older people vaccinated fewer cases fewer hospitalizations, proportion young people among cases among hospitalizations risen. Delta spreads faster contagious/ Dutch public health institute said infections could traced source, 37% happened hospitality venue bar club. Infections among people ages 18-24 surged 262%, followed 191% rise 25-29 year-olds. . . 46% Netherlands‚Äô adult population fully vaccinated, 77% country‚Äôs adults least one shot. Health authorities said 1.3 million people would receive first second doses week.

the article also alarming rise confirmed cases, hospital admissions increased modest 11%, 60 COVID-19 patients, week, institute said. Twelve admissions intensive care units.

Time tell last bit means. Hospitalization spikes usually trail behind infection spikes week two, things may take turn worse. hand, sounds like lot new cases young folk tend lower hospitalization rate older patients, maybe not. statements sound like they‚Äôre somewhat sensationalized. yet see real medical study long COVID people weren‚Äôt hospitalized. Even study article based survey data people giving self diagnosed symptoms ‚Äúbrain fog‚Äù anxiety. number things could cause symptoms. seems bit misleading phrasing statements they‚Äôre proven facts, they‚Äôre far it. Fully support individuals plan come seek solution. likely support family doctor find good way get protection. According science, vaccine don‚Äôt need worry. Jesus. can't imagine taking different OTC medications once! guess come household never really took pain relievers. get cold whatnot, take dose nyquil, nasty cold. Tylenol reserved severe pain headaches. Everything else pretty much bear it. willy nilly taking shit would throw red flags me!! guess we've raised mindset ""grin bear it."" Cool. Good job getting vaccinated. too. We've got lot common. imagine backlash chaos dont get approved? course theyll get approved. best friend high school teacher, understand frustration. one hope. still know better career scientists. excuses come. Yeah neither I. Given we‚Äôre nearly year half still seeing spikes, also reports vaccinated people catching delta variant (which seems common we‚Äôre told), we‚Äôre probably going couple years, huh?

I REALLY hope isn‚Äôt case. felt good getting vaccine I‚Äôm losing hope. COVID still problem year half later vaccines??? Post-approval monitoring unusual.  ""within 6 months"", could earlier then?  source shows article wrong? 6 months ago people going states US jump line get vaccine.

Now everyone cares shot raffles get people vaccinated. think solid data yet. exactly long term effects I'm concerned (plus neurological issues changes grey matter brain) adults unvaccinated children there. Strange, much better countries  That‚Äôs case here. state changed policy 4.5 hours releasing it. Vaccinations 100% even people mild disease develop long COVID. assume otherwise? Currently teaching 6th Grade ELA summer school. There‚Äôs lot hope. vaccine-hesitant dad something similar April. complained feeling sick, asked possibly COVID encouraged get tested, dismissed idea (to surprise, since concerned getting COVID past).  

It weeks later, sending screenshots open Pfizer/Moderna appointments area ""nudge"" get shot, finally admitted gotten J&amp;J early April, like 3 days pause. Like you, happy, part like, ever gonna tell me? Lol. literally insane. listening science?  overcrowding hospitals antivaxxers threat everyone. acutely, also long term backlog procedures grows. Bro sad, you‚Äôre entire history talking Chinese vaccines. get SE country hates China, get life spread propaganda Thank giving essential piece information clickbait headline felt necessary exclude.  spraying body image? can‚Äôt find saw record 80 coronavirus deaths 5,014 new cases Monday, positive results third people tested, state-run MRTV said.

This country going suffering long time. Oh trust mental gymnastics they'll make something else before? Seriously, tone down. joke friends family people anti-vax latch onto anything. curious. plans live forever? vaccine isn‚Äôt enough would be? 

It seems like stressful way live. Yeah, sucks. office returned 4 days week. gave us one additional Friday - flex Fridays (wow, brave them). Unvaccinated folks wear mask, vaccinated don't. seems like matter time get sick. 

Look, returning normal, office stuff dumb pointless. 90% job remotely, higher ups obsessed ""butts seat"" meetings, am. 

So fortunate 2 days month, feel ya. 100% reason. leave work early next day second shot ‚Äúout it‚Äù. Tired, weak energy couple days. first shot piece cake.

Many people probably figure good enough protection first shot choose get fed second. Yep mandatory reasons. vast majority people get vaccine waiting full approval right wing talking point use prove logical ones. Never mind fact able walk around lot less risk relatively safe (in high vaccination areas) people got emergency approval vaccine. keep pushing point even made clear disagreed. make argument monitoring. Probably combination two factors.

The new strain slightly lethal/slightly higher IFR. 
The last peak could less testing/higher rate undiscovered infections.

But bigger takeaway Russia poor vaccinating elderly/at risk population. countries seeing exact opposite now, much lower rates fatalities hospitalisation. no, RNA/nucleic acids aren‚Äôt made proteins. Multiple jobs required vaccines condition work them. Healthcare, research military examples. Many also require proof immunity question whether someone protection. [Just one example pdf submit information digital registry would surprised places check registry giving vaccine. bet would pretty easy get third shot wanted it.

That‚Äôs enough wear mask, guess. consideration kids huh? NHS workers care thousands exit wave? Yep know several people waiting ""full approval"" know well get then.. new excuse like ""well cases barely around I'm taking vaccine risks period"" uniformly. [There sharp east-west  Agreed. wonder point considered neglect don‚Äôt vaccinate child something like Covid. ""Within Biden administration, fear Americans convinced coronavirus vaccines provide short-lived immunity requiring booster, less likely accept shot. concerns could fall wayside new data Israel, expected next several weeks, shows conclusively immunity wanes six eight months, significantly raising risks elderly vulnerable populations.""

That ridiculous. people going get vaccinated. Nothing work outside actual requirement. Again, government going step behind, like masks. vaccine. tremendous supply. allow possibility.  So? still possible. Better chance it. .... yall feel current narrative state economy/ Wallstreet? good w/o worrys?

Nasty little group people we'd better without. places tracking that, like Americans new species can't use data. did. agree conclusions. Seriously, think err side caution, even inconvenient.

Man I‚Äôm fed people spreading misinformation. guess would better I‚Äôd added source initial comment. thought pretty common knowledge sub. big deal announced could stored higher temperatures. comment alluding government conspiracy so, yes, removed. Plus Pfizer Moderna could market vaccine themselves, running ads influence people hesitant. suppose make lot money Orb√°n cronies that's good guess. Yeah. never ironclad way proving it. positive definitely tho. dad MS died COVID April 2020. know hard is. Best luck, don‚Äôt let bullies get you. I, immune issues relatively good health, continue mask indoors despite dual pfizer shots people like you. Wait, full approval? believe even US that's still recommendation CDC, federal buildings still require them. Yes no. terms safety, formality, vaccines known safe, duration protection unknown thus far.

In terms legality makes significant difference. EUA government could make essentially de facto required get vaccine leveling large consequences refusal, shady work around would likely challenged lengthy court battles. fully approved, government could, inclined, actually force people get vaccine. private entities could technically require vaccination remain employed/become employed them, full approval would make much palatable so. Many companies, keeping things voluntary, explicitly said ""we requiring vaccination **at moment**, heavily implies plans future.

Once fully approval goes through, expect nearly every government job require vaccination. Federal especially. States try hold off, feds threaten withhold funding, usually crumbles pretty quickly, states likely require even suggested. people claim getting full approved get it, right?..... right? I‚Äôm trying hang on, it‚Äôs impediment international travel consider dropping getting approved vaccine limbo continues discussion subreddit. Almost looks like negative news vaccines moderated away. Lying legal cases, using forged documents breaking pandemic measures not. Vaccines, actually. Russia four vaccines: two vector vaccines, Sputnik V Sputnik Light, inactivated whole virion vaccine CoviVac somewhat questionable vaccine EpiVacCorona made state-controlled/ex-military lab (which known making bio-weapons back Soviet Union). 

It mostly anti vaxxers (Russia world leader antivaxx movement), people oppose everything people waiting vaccines (I believe using excuse get vaccinated) ignored. many anyways.

The real problem anti vaxx movement: bloggers, mass media, politicians, public figures, medical workers, scientists oppose mandatory vaccination/vaccination overall. 

On top confusing response Covid itself, like Russian regions tried impose semi-mandatory vaccination, Moscow opposed claiming law, try themselves. Using Covid lockdowns political reasons, like stop mass protests canceling lockdowns vote Constitution referendum on. 

Hardly anyone wearing mask. Well, people wear mask properly (\~10%, believe mostly vaccinated people), people wear masks hands legs.   let unvaccinated ones suffer consequences

those consequences also include becoming variant factories might vaccine resistant.

When every become dumb selfish? First all, don‚Äôt know clear goal isn‚Äôt mean mock ideas, expressing opinions French citizen. 

That thing said, contamination going up, going alarming rate. choice make, restrictions possibilities. (i mean government) 2 choices :
- close restaurant, cinema, museum etc‚Ä¶ everyone again
- close unvaccinated people

What‚Äôs fairest option ? Closing everyone mean vaccinated also get blame even protected protect relatives. Closing unvaccinated mean technically discriminating unvaccinated. 

I vaccinated voluntary. well family, respected social distancing. didn‚Äôt saw grandma year, even live 1h road afar. followed rules, free see (and great meal restaurant !). liberty. liberty stops liberty others start. 
My liberty go out, go restaurant, see family. Unvaccinated people one blame 4th wave. close again, fault our. choosing liberty vaccine, cause restrictions, infringing liberty. 

You still right vaccinate know. come cost. Frankly, find funny, make people face responsibilities say it‚Äôs unfair freedom. truth unvaccinated people, even worse antivaxx, kill people. Yes actions people die. see people still die teatanus France, still don‚Äôt understand people court homicide. 

TL:DR : unvaccinated people cause restrictions, therefore it‚Äôs infringing liberty go out. Time weekly dose AZ vaccine bashing /s mean, think going happen? seeing contentious topic masks last year? Surely knew sizable portion country would ditch masks without getting vaccinated.

Not mention vaccinated people spread virus, CDC tracking breakthrough cases result hospitalization death, know exactly much vaccinated people spreading it. woman today told ""nothing worry about, 98% survival rate God side"" people can't helped. ‚ÄúFreedom fries‚Äù also pretty ridiculous.  mean, every person's bag ticket gets checked airport, would shocked also check every persons test vaccination. Yeah, need info pubic, people successfully cheat. fair. It‚Äôs sad think even vaccine approved 12 many wouldn‚Äôt get idiot parents. I‚Äôm california states literal digital registry. would know. sad law even necessary. people health workers know importance usefulness vaccinations most. haven‚Äôt seen breakdown symptomatic vaccinated Delta. hope sniffles cough considered symptomatic hospitalizations still dramatically down. would say Definitely will, hopefully everyone that's still ok. bot's bad, people are. Also, no. You‚Äôre conflating two things. use fetal stem cells context object (cells taken aborted fetus). lazy linguistic twists argument even exists, doctor able shut down. MRNA vaccine used abortion derived cell line point testing development. realize lot people won‚Äôt bother getting tested runny nose headache, right? Especially cold flu season. That‚Äôs lot ‚Äúmild‚Äù cases walking around. care much vulnerable (kids, immunocompromised, etc.), you‚Äôd support maintaining strong defense *infection*.

I‚Äôll whatever takes get booster. hope ‚Äúhappy get infected crowd‚Äù enjoys quarantine. sincerely hope don‚Äôt infect defenseless ‚Äúmild‚Äù case. Good point, mistake part. concerned blood clots reported recipients earlier year research showed J&amp;J AZ could opt one mRNA ones instead would make feel better, common ones area anyway.

Exactly ONE side anti-vax anti-mask anti-health. Democrats care people PEOPLE, political reasons. Nope, they'll move goalpost.   Well maybe stricter regulations regarding vaccines? Rather incentivizing people, let unvaccinated ones suffer consequences, they‚Äôre likely degenerates anyways. way everyone different, many people assume counter totally safe mix match (despite warning labels, made difference.. used even worse back 80s 90s).   Ok guy. Please, take time read article shared. might little long you, it‚Äôs worth promise. Wow, thanks write calls hundreds thousands deaths ‚Äúsmall number‚Äù? sick jaded. people lives, friends, family cared them. mattered even think didn‚Äôt. argument though refuse anything involves stem cells point development?

Personally, plan watch ass CDC said don‚Äôt wear mask obvious virus airborne. I‚Äôm interested booster don‚Äôt want infected, period.

What expect rest...  stage people full well know risks. fully vaccinated would put crowded situations nightclubs/sports stadiums. I'm fully vaccinated know even catch symptoms likely anywhere near severe. People choices make live choices. somebody prioritises partying long term health knowing they're vaccinated meant feel sorry them? Likewise somebody believes bullshit rumours vaccines sympathy levels going minimal. Decisions made balance lots people suffering economically. work hospitality went longer many businesses would go already have. new daily deaths record 780, daily new cases still lower peak 6 months ago.  


Russia still got low number vaccinated. split already:

Of course, splits must fair, justified etc., naive think without them. Yes.  details need articles leave out. No, suspect either crowded bar went loudly chatting someone asymptomatic.

But people got upset polls showed people wanted apology. offered one. fair, six deaths way lower we've day. We've 20-40 day now. 

I'm hoping cases peak soon I've seen estimates could reach 100000/day, 100-200 deaths/day. Thats really bad. ‚Äúuniquely American‚Äù ask kids mask. It‚Äôs true European countries didn‚Äôt require masks required older kids, others required school kids. Several countries east Southeast Asia also required school kids. Highly processed foods are. Pretty sure pretty processed. Covid respiratory virus. Don‚Äôt smoke weed anything else. greatly increase chances getting infected. That's surprise. heard Merkel explaining exponential growth early days, standard public information leadership high Germany.

Thats method everything measles typhoid Ebola, cost much fun all. remind people vaccinated globally means less likelyhood contagious varients causing resurgence.  Hospitalisations deaths still going UK. amount going relative cases like second wave, still concerning given completely opening soon yet vaccines fully available demographics responsible spreading covid - millennials gen Z.

EU‚Äôs green pass included soon I‚Äôm sure. I'm boat you. year house arrest, bitched enough, wore make everywhere go somewhere. got shots told they've severely reduced chances infection, severe infection eliminated chance mortal infection. I've saying ""trust science"", I'm going trust science says Pfizer veins protects me. people seem think goal zero infections.

Just fucking let us get lives without large risk loved ones dying. fucking hard?  Looking historically effective vaccine something search treatments seems slow end. instance, measles, mumps, rubella, polio, research done treatments diseases last 50 years? lot money effort seems get allocated finding treatments vaccine available. surprise multiple vaccines covid hear much treatment research. Generally speaking, they're made exception essential workers vaccinated AZ way back March. could choose another dose AZ switch Pfizer. people know went AZ respond well first dose switched.

Yes, that's real question. much longer need wait? trust politicians?

Thanks effort! Probably one forced it, stepped up. way could fully get know damned virus. It‚Äôs children autonomy go anywhere want.

I, like you, operating assumption need one evidence released saying otherwise. Deliberate exposure spreading infection always going bad idea. That‚Äôs vaccines exist first place. 

Breakthrough cases something want. increases risk immunocompromised people chance worrisome mutations. current vaccines seem high efficacy long time, level first months. Variolation-type practices stay pre-1800s.

Ah right. 'The Hospitality Industry' bloody awful throughout whole pandemic. bigger organisation bigger two fingers they've giving public. Sick back teeth constant bleating.

Well personally I'm never going near anything larger family 'hospitality' business ever rest go screaming wall bankruptcy next year better. missed.

We certainly need 'Hospitality Industry' looks anything like moment. blight society. US would always prefer companies foreign pharma - J&amp;J similar enough AZ seriously doubt ever see latter US.  massive deaths hospitalizations years. Got it. Vaccination measles mandatory Germany. Evidently French strategy fighting vaccine skepticism family doctors phone patients didn‚Äôt work. People respond incentives, resistant stronger need incentives. important US watch Israel see variants either spreading contained. Interestingly article noted 60% population gotten first shot (not fully vaccinated). Given started rollout early conjunction Pfizer, I'm wondering segments population hold-outs. know Ultra-Orthodox Jews anti-vax, must others too. say UK title, graph shows data US.   No-one really complaining public gatherings. Around world, reopening either happened happening fits starts. Covid's going away completely, world can't stop forever.

It's teachers unions pushing narrative children schooling inherently unsafe. they're really hit end here. going another year entire generation -- *next adult generation* \-- held social isolation without schooling. think everyone chance/ability get vaccinated get steady flow functional vaccines consistent basis like Flu (or current vaccines hold) start see mentality happen people move good.

(Other real reason care about,we ""looked at"" wear masks here) lockdown extremely mild.......Then covid cold..... I'm San Diego, south LA I've certaiy seen lot reporting issue, mainly local NPR/PBS channels.

But course, likely diagnosed Covid days probably likely NPR/PBS consumers. agree even here, wider public outreach issue poor. California districts in-person-only schooling Fall, much demand rural areas. good reason. Incomes much lower rural areas, year half, 6 million school kids home often without adult supervision. wealthy afford child care.   debated scientist smarter me. would tend agree risk assessment, need anti Vaccine possible time.

What certain least Sweden chose route soon vaccinated 70% adults stil mostly limited supply vaccine. Hopefully reach 80% adults beeing vaccinated. would decent compared rest world. California public schools mostly remained completely closed, beyond spring 2021 in-person classes youngest students, sounds like they're forcing issue make parents opt public school system -- students parents wanting continue mask rules longer apply adults, nervous parents read ""masks still required"" reason keep children home.

Public education seem coming rapid end.  prefer term smarter  understand you‚Äôll spread less vaccinated makes less likely develop symptoms help spread e.g. coughs sneezes

If manage test positive share joint someone they‚Äôll probably still get 12% UK population 8m people. That's 8m people far less likely get severe disease assumption reduce completely eliminate ability transmit make difference too. Infections rise there's doubt let's honest UK restrictions name since May 17th anyway. totally forgot children- that‚Äôs excellent point.

(Which high list suspected places Spanish Flu actually started.) Difficult worry could one unlucky few. Also long term repercussions mild illness fully understood - given long covid even mild covid cases debilitating there‚Äôs reason concerned. far remember correct. believe requirement wear mask stop spreading infection, prevent catching it. I'm US know precisely, still, think change happen one day another, probably gradual thing. right now, children 12 cannot vaccinated, constitute less 10/15% US population, kind lot. means there's still big chunk people possibility get vaccinated, think change happen next month so. gets approved everybody tho amount vaccinations returns stagnate time (like now), pretty much done people able vaccinate useful amount time. question many people convinced hesitant group happen. probably painfully slow hard tho, probably see amount vaccinated slowly creep knows where. Pfizer said studying vaccine children we'll probably results September/October. So, answer question, studies show safe effective, maybe nov/dec? Early 2022? Around time imo. context doctor license already revoked literally mental issue. somehow many people trust believe bood clots vaccines less prevalent women deal using anticonception pills.

We live age disinformation. ‚ÄúAn infected person spread COVID-19 starting 48 hours (or 2 days) person symptoms tests positive COVID-19. person still considered close contact even wearing mask around someone It‚Äôs bit one-two punch.

""95% less likely symptomatic infection"" exactly would get ""the vaccine works 95% times"". could well partly this, i.e. breakthroughs vaccine work people.

However, binary ""works 95% times"" vs. work 5% time way would get reduction infection rate. could e.g. shift severeness survive instead dying, mild disease instead severe one, get instead asymptomatic. could essentially effect population level.

In case discussed would mean hospitalization instead death vaccine's effect latter (shifting curve) would mean change vs. unvaccinated vaccine simply work all.

I'm saying possible; I'm getting likely significantly improve areas still good. Vaccines widely available US people already made choice. bad areas still bad people made choice get vaccinated. see changing another year. Normally, yeah, Delta variation sounds like still making harder really tell since mixes variants unless specifically test it. know much it, specifically, data generally showing rates infection gone way vaccinated (at least main variant). think definitive evidence natural immunity would impossible achieve eventually. link evidence? interpretation virus still new enough experts know status decade two five. 

I mostly responding comment reply seemed like commentator advocating natural immunity approach they've said smart approach vaccination. responded like anti-vax clearly aren't. 

Edit: know many people infected COVID-19 immunity time afterward, contribute herd immunity. don‚Äôt think reasoning necessarily backwards. Vaccinating one person less vaccinated area prevent others getting virus could potentially infect many others. even vaccinated person getting COVID makes new strains likely could effectively cancel consider many people infected used booster someone already vaccinated instead giving vaccine lower vaxxed area. would love mandates never used everyone listen experts say wear masks masks work.

The U.S. vaccinated less 5% country past month Japan vaccinated 15% past month. Perhaps Japan start slow soon, U.S. has. We'll see. again, would likely know details better me.

Anyway, congats getting vaccinated! English totally readable btw. certainly better Japanese! unvaxxed people feel ones cannot get due age health reasons. Outside know masks, hand washing, social distancing, vaccine work. little reason spreading outside idiocy. don‚Äôt herd immunity flu! don‚Äôt need tell that, literally saying, herd immunity vaccines.  unlike you, also read 2nd sentence gives context rest article: important full context: Fetal cell lines fetal tissue. think may also people posting fake ‚Äútestimonials‚Äù fully vaccinated getting infected. don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs everyone, one never underestimate insidiousness malicious actors social media. People ‚Äúbored‚Äù pandemic it‚Äôs ‚Äútaken long.‚Äù 1918 flu took couple years resolve. probably one rough winter get through. 

Realistically, would make sense mask distance winter. would great westerners could steal cultural norm wearing mask knew sick (with anything communicable). Nobody going either. get it. It‚Äôs tough. Also everybody‚Äôs risk tolerance different  shown multiple sides even mild infections lead long Covid Oh Belgium anything. could handled level European Union, fact likely people working airport customs interact local Belgium government all.

I think country gets pass things like EU standard safety regulations air travel.

And country might even anything actually setting up, guarantee already infrastructure things like interpol passport screening, would make extension services like that.

It matter particular European Union country could design infrastructure systems this, matters whether combination member nations could create system could used everybody Sinovac good donated Africa. Thai people need better protected BNT Moderna. source information? works? Incl. private data policy?

_I don‚Äôt feel bad offenders shut._
I agree that. bypass adding extra backslash inevitably causes polio outbreak, myriad preventable fatal ailments made immune to, remember republican lawmakers HAPPY restrict politicize life saving medical science. 

Personally think stopping unnecessary suffering Children good thing. that's Greece got centralized system labs declare results, get document platform's website. comes qr code takes website, supposedly officials scan check details accurate. NJ Last saw 25% african americans vaccinated. Asians most, whites second, latinos next. like analogy think instead plane emergency. oxygen masks drop. put first.... kids. Otherwise, able help kids all. (You'll dead).

Sorry that's even worse analogy. people did, they're still alive guess okay.

Not necessarily take two Pfizer though, think one enough. people Vaccine passport...... China recognizes western vaccines except J&amp;J, EU recognizes chinese logical case vaccines ('antivax') future vaccines EUA? would antivax got rejected? religion, free change mind Source? (I can‚Äôt access content due location) they'll say without hint irony remotely trust government access phone. Look FB steals data, gov problem  yeah enough worry about, need Covid level. also 90% people wear masks, apparently people done Covid, Covid's done quite yet. Stay safe, go Suns! Thanks already got second dose Pfizer. fact entire family got Pfizer. waiting 40 million doses start arriving August. ü§≠ Majority want sinovac. know colleagues work St Jude pretty pissed. country vaccinations primary mRNA vaccines seem superior? 4.6 per 100k, pre-vaccination quiet periods sf. point still going up.

Not trying alarmist saying things get anywhere bad last winter again. case rates go even highly vaccinated places. hospitalizations tick somewhat too. I'm vaccinated fuck vaccine passports.  Ireland much choice say American, take offered. year two us discussion end. end date, whole pandemic fade away, resurface, maybe get better, maybe worse, maybe disappear completely .... like another year two. places may completely covid free places hard time.

You might good area might vice versa. case, we'll wondering discussing another year two more. 

I think 1918 pandemic lasted four years circled planet infect reinfect areas faded away. least two reasons might policy, they're protecting people:

 1) want people waiting line get vaccinated catch covid people line them.

 2) Someone recovered covid amount protection natural immunity, someone never exposed doesn't; vaccines short supply, asking recovered wait receive vaccines allow people protected sooner.

I think countries (France?) policy people recovered need one dose two dose vaccine (which also lets people protected given quantity vaccine); research findings consistent showing covid recovery + 1 dose produces higher antibody levels 2 doses vaccine. What‚Äôs alternative you? wear masks inside forever, hold weddings concerts large events? I‚Äôm glib curious know realistic options us live virus coming years. Anecdotally I‚Äôm teacher elementary students underserved community taught remote entire school year. attendance rate best building.

Then would million times worse. That‚Äôs exactly problem makes us rely retrospective studies. obviously prevaccine really won‚Äôt know asymptomatic mild cases actually affect physiology vaccinated people long.

There kinda logically fallacy question‚Ä¶ person doesn‚Äôt know they‚Äôre positive, wouldn‚Äôt doctor lab/imaging unless something else going on.

Vaccine makers started applying full FDA approval **May/June**. [A simple search shows

That‚Äôs comparable proof all. First didn‚Äôt link actual source so‚Ä¶ Also HIV different disease symptoms means transmission. mention combining drugs create satisfactorily effective initial treatment different needing boosters much effective initial treatment. absolutely COULD case COVID well unless something else haven‚Äôt shown furthest thing knowing case. That's ridiculous expect countries recognise program. hope issue working details/bureaucratic nonsense accept proof vaccination external system.

Eg Malta initially accept UK digital NHS app proof vaccination, shortly around week later, assume found way satisfied verify it.

It can't hard accept EU digital covid certificate, fingers crossed gets sorted sooner rather later. financial perspective much interesting government allow people visit allow brits leave (tourism money vs tourism money spent elsewhere), would thought best interests get fixed. don‚Äôt think lump normal ‚Äùanti vaxxers‚Äù together people skeptical Covid vaccine. I've VA FL like night day. Fiscus least 25th official leave **A** state‚Äôs top vaccination position since beginning coronavirus pandemic...

Of 50 US States, least 25 people equivalent position quit retired. 25 Tennessee. ""Hospitalizations 24 percent time period, deaths low single digits..."" 43,960 accumulated weekend, reported one day, actually number new cases single day? Assuming US also, we're WAY better shape last year due vaccines. said, case curve watch right UK. sort similar boat far vaccination rates go (though probably cases/natural immunity top vaccination rate). Delta lot transmissible. Unvaccinated people kids may get significant number cases, plus may significant number breakthrough cases vaccinated people (which cases mild). 

Luckily seems UK pretty low mortality rate surge, effect high vaccination rate elderly. US also hopefully similar. Considering they're removing Covid restrictions July 19, think they've concluded doesn't. lovely positive take sounds like shitty year. really hope feel much better soon, job continues make happy, next year less eventful you. Basically yes. reduce chance resistances HIV patients several drugs combined. thing done Tuberculosis. Due tendency resistances start combination 4 different antibiotics. happening happen 70-80% freely deciding vaccinated, sorry, case, hospital flooded covid cases. realise there‚Äôs slim chance dying even hospitalised, right? Deaths lag  me, would frankly racist give anti-vaxers pass. I'm sure dictatorship it. Jacobson v Massachusetts still precedent America many people would argue America dictatorship. makes sense. guess different outlook makes age groups matter me. 9 year old high risk, we‚Äôve extremely careful entire time. I‚Äôve never seen getting flu (which honestly even did, asthma makes flu really dangerous thing). it‚Äôs scary us since last March. Obviously seeing severe cases younger kids heartbreaking, we‚Äôve always seen likely outcome son. Maybe feature could get added highlight edit.. show changed. Would nice reason, people waiting approval like really gonna change point. lot stuff happens time get sick. get cold flu body fight millions invaders, puts stress systems.

Covid unique regard. studied lot more. Well hope democracy put place.

That complete lack empathy them, pose risk shocking. hope see one day **Will ever able determine covid vaccin immunity?**

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'm kind horrified awe we'd (UK here) vaccines delta hit. is, countries high vaccination rates *slightly* fucked, rather megafucked.

Countries without much access vaccines going incredibly dangerous position soon. That's worrying.  Every step avoid infections vaccinated taken. experience anti-infective substances. antibiotics, also antivirals. I. ex. antiherpetics (aciclovir) anti HIV drugs induce resistances people take regularily, making lose effectiveness, eventually ending lethal many cases worry, herd stupidity keep safe. different Vaccines available risk(Autoimmune example) find Vaccine works them. mNRA ones example show risk Autoimmune diseases. 

Nobody medically valid reason get vaccinated(extremely low percentage population) excluded anything. chances likely want protect say work remotely. 

Any reason simply choice barred return normal since choosing participate solution. I've wearing mine despite vaccinated. protect somewhat yea, definitely want spread it. problem get unvaccinated unmasked person take home unvaccinated kid. case it? parents stupid enough send kids without masks, blame bring back vaccine-resistant strain, strain dangerous young people. Also spanish flu- people took even seriously mutated, causing second wave especially dangerous young.

It likely spread due troop movements war. actually know. information distribution vague best. Hence shit planning. expect someone knowledge field understand I'm done here. test active infection antibody test -- otherwise nearly everyone got sick would remain positive long time. Instead PCR test, looks snippets RNA match exact sequence Covid's RNA (it's RNA virus). Basically, people actively fighting infection test positive PCR test. Antigen test another one looks active infection looking viral proteins.

If symptoms went away probably soon test negative PCR test (or maybe already would test negative took test today). They're actually ending COVID vaccine clinics adults want seen advocating vaccines [The health department] ended events school property ‚Äúout abundance caution‚Äù vaccination efforts ‚Äúperceived give wrong impression regarding parental consent.‚Äù

Why might shift worrisome Brian Haile, CEO Neighborhood Health, group nonprofit clinics providing vaccines around many rural Tennessee counties, school gymnasiums one venues large enough hold vaccination event indoors, air conditioning, enough space social distancing, Haile said. cases never get 100k daily cases US again. We'll see sporadic regional stuff, like Missouri (think Michigan April). watch government acts, say. might warning Delta, also shutting vaccination centers testing centers place. pandemic phase United States over. agree, also need manage fact people given year life foe disease already. 

Of population, would break 3 groups: vaccinated, anti-vaxxers, don‚Äôt get vaccine legitimate reason (be medical, legitimate fears it, access reason, etc.)

You‚Äôre going change anti-vaxxers minds easily, US, don‚Äôt see sort vaccine passport getting large scale acceptance. can‚Äôt get vaccine rational reason small group. 

I don‚Äôt think continue lock whole country large group ignorant people won‚Äôt change minds. 

I‚Äôve advocating unvaccinated people (who don‚Äôt legitimate reason) placed bottom medical priority list COVID related treatment. 

I‚Äôm saying flat refuse treat them. you‚Äôre community outbreak hospitals fill, catch COVID need ventilator, someone else needs ventilator car crash whatever, bad you‚Äôre unvaccinated. 

We allow people make decisions, don‚Äôt let decisions impact health care system. simply don‚Äôt allow shut ICU wards use needed ventilators made decision get vaccinated. knew risks, don‚Äôt let decision impact someone else get vaccinated. way wont happen.
and it'll worse. they'll inside more. cant see anything else happen

its like texas re-opened bars like week shut ended. happen? 
texas one worst places world while. 

im sending kid that. thankfully ive full time stay home parent whole life dont adjust. hes 4 hes missing preschool knows stuff anyway. it'd mostly social reasons great, terrible. 

I would expected infection numbers higher today, weren't. number lower tomorrow well, wave come crashing almost fast soared. administration asking data need booster perfectly valid request. without doubt Pfizer rest vaccine makers would love nice constant income stream thanks annual boosters forever. 

Whatever within administration believe motives. end day, need good data show boosters needed. exactly needed. Every six months, every year, every 2 years? yet properly answered based actual data. 

So I'm govt asking data studies truly figure need timing this. Sure. there's lot lose, one wants children set back. clear gain. didn‚Äôt mean flippant way‚Ä¶I meant way it‚Äôs tragic regardless toddlers older kids. Subjective indeed. I've spent time Texas three times. Summer winter weather pretty much unbearable. friendly people sure, plenty (although that's common pretty much everywhere). own, works great. pay decent amount attention pandemic news don‚Äôt get impression all. 

This genuine question: assumption media overplaying situation? look groups, think anything, situation downplayed. (Not saying agree, idea floating around anything, make case it). I‚Äôm curious goes see situation ‚Äúsame‚Äù overall information front us. person Ohio claiming brass keys magnetically stuck her. *Brass.* big brains. dont trust government anything. Hey live AZ well. Haven‚Äôt missed day work entire pandemic. knee deep customers Arizona worse infection rate entire world. followed rules, stayed distant, always wore mask around people, never got virus. Masks distancing really work.

I‚Äôm fully vaccinated happily wear mask around people. Also taking chances bringing home little ones. vaccines expensive. cost peanuts compared benefits, economically. assuming boosters valuable new vaccinations can‚Äôt know either. agree difficult important decision make limited information. That‚Äôs even important try know much act gut feelings intuitions. 100 cases GBS 12.8 million doses given, 99 cases made full recovery. 1 death 12.8 million - 0.000008% chance death. think called fighting odds. Wrong. Check history. Among stupidity, find plenty comments telling vaccinated people take masks get back living lives.

No one insisting stay inside forever.

I understand people Reddit create straw man arguments attack, are.

I simply believe facts science, allow guide. noticed provide facts data back position. wonder why?

Edit: People like actively causing cases deaths. I'm cringey, call people like downplayed actively promoted spread? ""The EU"" thing comes matters, every country different. sure tell they're mandatory Italy. Polio mandatory since 1966.   much data ability infect others?

Are likely contagious unvaccinated person? reason believe they'll shed fewer virions? sinovac capable good delta? I'm getting second shot week  think average family tent. suspect filtration/ventilation systems planes honestly. correct response.  Think it. new variant coming, lot transmissible lot lethal. need new lockdown.
Now, chose discriminate force everybody stay home, allow people good immunity go out, participate economic activities. Airlines lot ventilation air scrubbers planes think lot heavy lifting here.  Yeah, clue. appears reading none variants bypassing vaccines directly taking advantage whatever reason (age, condition, vax date) lower antibody counts. that's needed plus spike antibody counts again, another hit original vaccine may enough save R&amp;D time. besides difficulty without caught, it'd supid public listed pharmaceutical company like Fosun (why Pfizer sabotage vaccines shipped Cuba Vietnam?)

Let's look gain loss:
Gain: Taiwan would deaths, mostly elderly weak. Make much difference war. Besides Taiwan kinds vaccines.
 
Loss: data would suspicious western countries would make sure China's reputation damaged.

The gain justify loss. Actually, think it, US quite motivation sabotage batch vaccine distributed China. lot chance Taiwan. Cases matter vaccines deaths remain low. genuinely feel bad see what's playing Australia right now. guys along NZ great job embracing zero covid making work; government essentially threw away trying lowball Pfizer. really hope things pick up, there's reason country globally significant well-developed Australia difficult situation. Plus, far selfish perspective I'm really missing Melbourne Grand Prix; easily one best dates calendar. always woke 2am watch it. Found anti vaxx. pro vax cult? u ever gotten polio , Measles vaccine? vaccines side effect chances rare..How anything different? Cuz made year? problem fix eventually refusing vaccine. Let go way. People abroad know it, many want rich countries trash... None staff manage want vaccine prefer vaccine better option become available.   asthma get flu shot every year. Ive gotten flu times healthcareworker despite vaccines, never terrible. one year never got around (working long hours/overtime) work offer them, ended pneumonia o2 saturation low 90s/upper 80s. terrifying sorts steroids weeks. Sitting bedroom unable locate inhaler single scariest moment life. 

Get vaccines people. makes difference get infected. 12-17 year olds get Pfizer moment, areas enough supply give adults dose. Ooh sounds like strong argument. ""In particular scenario fuck religious personal beliefs."" Waterproof one. I'm working Africa news catastrophic impact vaccination here. country people want AZ, trust it. 

Why they? Canada use find risky compared vaccine, let send poor keep good one. expect people end do? 

Even richer one see point taking covishield, can't even go France yet. also herd many countries reserving AZ age groups.

Many millions may remains unvaccinated many months go. Good reservoir create many mutation.

Meanwhile quantities vaccines expire without used. cite NYT source

Oh wow. bet complain people cite Wikipedia you? feel like one field get rushing get one vaccinated would end mandatory. 

How promote science behind medicine refuse trust case I‚Äôve seen pandemic upright spread misinformation. IMO shouldn‚Äôt allowed stay field science prove it. 

Last line key. science determine it. 2nd cousin posted something Facebook without source. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

You suspicious numbers.

Also, every report countries shown efficacy high 80's low 90's. numerous peaceful yet crowded protests well outright riots US last year, none seem driven infections far able discern. Fingers crossed incident dodges bullet too. able get past incognito. I‚Äôve also looking good sources recording breakthrough infections transmissions, find any. addition 100 reported coronavirus deaths June, Marylanders haven‚Äôt gotten inoculated made 95 percent 2,385 new coronavirus cases 93 percent 6,707 new coronavirus hospitalizations state saw May 10 June 8, unvaccinated people made 89 percent new hospitalizations 97 percent new infections Maryland, Schrader told legislative panel last month. I'm disappointed. got free donut free beer.

What lottery ticket given NJ big winner? Yeah, americans annoyed us celebrating getting Euros final drawn alot anti England comments recent weeks Depends heavily country. Belgium actually front runner Europe adults offered least first shot (with 80% taking it) moving 12-18 year olds (although Pfizer currently approved age group). problem obviously youth party vacations took non-vaccinated country clubs open one decently testing imposing Covid measures. always going go wrong quickly couple hundred Belgian kids fraction problem. Interesting coworker came full blown symptoms last weekend Pfizer vaccines board. can‚Äôt smell taste. Got second dose February. I‚Äôm curious causes breakthroughs. I‚Äôm impressed son courage mask. Much better said doubt they'll deliberately sabotage vaccines. What's gain them?

Anyway bioNTech made German. CEV Mate mine 100% asymptomatic picked antibody test getting ready go hospital.

PCRs time we're clear.

Another mate antibody test I'm convinced it. Mrs covid positive isolating together. days took LFT every day part test release trial - every test negative. many people unvaccinated?.. Good getting tired anti vaxx anti mask morons. need US to. bad. People trying go directly kids. leave decision parents, good bad.

I see fired. extremely inappropriate, matter good intentions. 

If kid eligible vaccination, would heartbeat; would livid anyone went without authorisation. wife also huge concerns talk things. She'd freak F authorities went heads. got mines back March. I‚Äôm still standing strong.  simply want set precedent bodily autonomy young age. that, might get bright ideas, like abortions might thing worth like too. Diligence already cracked. past month, there's woman openly flaunt ""there pandemic, I'm wearing mask"". recently, man openly wear mask go exercise (though original plan piss police, based video), company's workers rushed factory muxk-up communications dont want isolated/quarantined.

Hell, morning, even see video 2 brats disobey request stop check ""passing"" paper (detailing need go work) police. Thank saving time. mean it‚Äôs 5%*the risk getting infected Covid you‚Äôre vaccinated? fired getting people vaccinated. Quite opposite actually.  Well went swinging Libert√©. √âgalit√©.

Strangely VA originally considered dad partially disabled due tinnitus significant hearing loss, took paperwork. think considered 10% disabled due ringing ears.  That's many people IRL also I'm seeing. Brilliant, brilliant. ~60% protection Delta variant would call low risk, especially elderly teacher risk factors. Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana. It‚Äôs moving west Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas. Las Vegas also outbreak.

People started traveling work.

Immunocompromised people carry before, taking precautions. ideal world could get danger back baseline, normal level. That‚Äôs exactly started symptoms. fear symptoms appeared.

This report, based real world British vaccine data delta variant, shows high efficacy hospitalisation low infection 1 dose. Sadly data deaths severe disease Scapegoat CDC directed medical professionals test vaccinated individual covid unless symptoms. idea many vaccinated individuals asymptomatic mild cases tested. still symptoms?

That‚Äôs people know 30 haven‚Äôt gotten vaccinated. It‚Äôs they‚Äôre antivax anything, don‚Äôt seem worried all

Also, I‚Äôm fully vaxxed anyone says anything vaccines fantastic job preventing severe covid death. solid infection mild asymptomatic case, especially Delta. 

Many vaccinated people want wear masks prevent mild case results long covid neurological gray matter issues long term. prevent infecting others around us. Yeah, Macron's really aggressive this, ar least ain't another lockdown Let‚Äôs say help certain magical box! brother finished K12 (equivalent). stressed exam, wearing masks. fact, seen little ""breaking masks"" here.  they're rampaging across global health systems causing massive death Sounds awesome. I‚Äôm talking K-12. suppose depends whether see another car driving towards speed faster car's crumple zones would prefer. like vaccines, population vaccinated, better protected are. That‚Äôs whole idea behind herd immunity. Individual vaccinations work, still people getting pretty sick vaccinated kids haven‚Äôt infected still risk. least 11 employees Sunrise Hospital Medical Center tested positive COVID-19 attending party June 7, according Southern Nevada Health District emails obtained records requests Brown Institute Media Innovation‚Äôs Documenting COVID-19 project. emails, shared Review-Journal, indicate eight employees fully vaccinated December January, meaning virus ‚Äúbroken through‚Äù protection employees infected received one dose double-dose vaccination. One unvaccinated. least 10 11 delta variant, easily transmissible strain virus.

So maybe Pfizer onto something getting booster 6 months? That‚Äôs law voted parliament. we‚Äôre far accepted. That's fucking stupid even words. School Board meeting live recently. One speakers public comments started listing medical complications said could happen mask wearing. included urinary track infections, facial deformities, need dental surgery. Can't script shit. point was.more questioning sort approach would work woth people clearly scientifically illiterate begin with. Really? thesis, wearing masks whole day, morale psy stable seemingly need relearn every single time there's another wave? Singapore counting sinovac vaccinated anecdotal. see western countries using Sinovac?

This excuse blindly trust sinovac effective.

It reasonable ask evidence reputable source corrupted country ... especially sinovac history bribery before.

For reason, keep giving results Indonesia, turkey, Chile.

I'm Thailand. know corrupted government looks like.

Singapore discarding sinovac huge signal sinovac worthless.

This last reply cannot really refute evidence Singapore discards sinovac...lol anything Canadian procurement strategy we're here...with little help states.

I'll going work doctor applied travel exemption got one. Well guess that's rest world then? Nice knowing here. We, poor people, going die new variants crop rich countries purchase boosters.  ""but end many people want countries trash, matter good trash.""

That absolutely correct. currently live Philippines people regularly buy ""surplus"" items coming Japan (stuff Japanese want export low price poor countries).

In addition, many countries use Sinovac vaccine probably less safe effective AZ (although reliable data probably never available vaccine). Thank got second dose today Convention Center! well oiled machine, within 45 mins.  yet retire wear shoes. Weird. Sometimes people mindlessly blame government everything.

I'm pretty proud well turn around vaccines summer. I'm shocked even got summer. Good shit Canada. hospitals get overloaded effects everyone, unvaccinated. number healthcare workers PTSD past year insane. much understand ""screw em!"" attitude, drawbacks. Thank :)  doubt, wear mask. Even vaccinated, live place vaccination rate low. ELI5 this? literally immune system works. response secondary infection, antibody production ramp again, rapidly, thus protecting COVID even antibodies wane. Sterilizing immunity might decrease, chance hospitalizations severe symptoms significantly lower, negligible among younger people stronger immune systems. Memory B memory lymphocytes proliferate activate much faster/easier naive lymphocytes. one reasons second dose usually hits harder first dose. Public health isn‚Äôt something play nice about.

* High fever
* Joint muscle pain
* loss taste smell (aka drain bamage)
* Pneumonia
* Lung fibrosis
* Encephalitis
* Encephalomyelitis
* called ""long haul covid"" neurological symptoms like long term fatigue, brain fog, disorientation, psychosis

Plenty 'mild' symptoms put weeks, last destroy quality life, possibly rest life.

Basically: Wear fucking mask wash hands.

&amp;#x200B;

Just get intubated mean suffer.  I'm sure getting data I'm San Francisco we're 80% vaccinated yet cases exploded past two weeks. 

Unfortunately vaccines masks state dropped masks. Vermont kind good general whole pandemic, what's secret? :P  guess enough possible. European countries need use sampling. I'm ugly without mask. I'm sparing all. üòÑ almost missed too. There's break first couple paragraphs make look like end article, kept going that. It‚Äôs really impossible. 4yo wears mask whenever we‚Äôre public he‚Äôs indoors school. preschooler it, others don‚Äôt much excuse except ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care‚Äù. ride, one time MLB postponed, Korean baseball games shown ESPN. really serious getting vaccinated, could probably ordered 2 fake vaccination certificates first vaccination certified. maybe get one 2 instances first different pages. 

Then basically go get 2nd shot twice. You‚Äôre right. Unfortunately always people blow proportion use new info Anti-Vax propaganda, peddle consume said propaganda likely people already made mind getting vaccine add circlejerk. people acknowledge low odds use either get different vaccine take risk (but mindful it). FDA ruins credibility covering Modern Medicine would dark place main agency fuels trust medicine wouldn‚Äôt trusted anymore Hardly surprising. vaccination equals less infection vice versa. efficacy alone would choose mRNA shots others. Doesnt PCR test show false positive like 40% time? tbf Taiwan's dire situation entirely little China. back late 2020 local company secured 30 million dose Biotech vaccine via Foshun, company based Shanghai distributor Biotech vaccine great China area. deal disrupted authority Taiwan want buy vaccine Chinese company. authority also delayed arrival vaccines donated local business owners buddhist groups refused buy proved vaccines aboard favored domesticly developed vaccine, even start 3rd phase trial. Without questionable moves Taiwanese people would given biotech vaccine long time ago.   teach elementary. heard complaints kids. Granted teach 5th haven‚Äôt heard issues K teachers. also good friend moved Taiwan teach there. 4 year olds class wear fine. It‚Äôs matter patience modeling. I‚Äôm sure exceptions kids special needs, typically developing 4 year old handle mask fine. Get well soon!! Wow, that's pretty intense screening. Like said, good luck!  True, side effects, lower efficacy, contamination issues, it‚Äôs tough time vaccine overall. Would gotten back vaccines short supply, getting type priority? Sure. supply isn‚Äôt issue, would honestly choose one mRNA shots. think main issue first wave we've majority people vaccinated. still question case hospitalization ratio remain consistent pre-vacination levels. Yep husband vaccinated BC. Hubby got second dose today. know many friends double vaccinated. need increase funding parallel realities combat vaccine hesitancy UK 68 million people 30000+ cases highest vaccination percentage world.
Poland 40 million people 60 cases vaccination levels sort low.

Can explain phenomena delta variant everywhere Europe. got second Pfizer doze May. Early July got fever 101F. Took flu medicine get rid fever. gone 2 hours later. test showed covid know type. completely fine next day spouse even told quarantine despite positive lasting symptoms. Thank you, Pfizer. Fully vax pfyzer 4 months. Caught delta. symptom able smell taste, otherwise, feel good vaccine stimulates spike protein antibodies, request correct test, detect natural infections (nucleocapsid). really concern vaccinated associate unvaccinated, exactly policy preventing.

People always say this, answer target based. able maintain reduce infections, importantly, deaths, good. deaths increasing, infections sharply increasing, restrictive. 

It seems simple enough, is. Small increases expected, looks like seeing regional pockets rampant growth, folks starting crack down. region alright. I'm hoping holds up.  Study:

If vaccines 90% effective 85% people vaccinated, I‚Äôd probably ok going unmasked. we‚Äôre doesn‚Äôt seem like long time. I‚Äôm willing risk health, I‚Äôm willing risk health community.

I don‚Äôt want responsible anyone‚Äôs death I‚Äôm willing wear mask make likely. Apparently willing risk killing others cost wanting piece cloth face. test positive antibodies vaccine? know everyone tried. Got first shot issues ever since üòû. Supposed get second shot Friday think wait. Hoping one shot gives protection?? they‚Äôre basic facts, plenty data showing masks 0% effectiveness. Please post sources you‚Äôre going make types claims. Unfortunately, time now.

The removal mask mandates always connected vaccination rates viral behavior, individual risk. think there's religion bot removes posts religion yes, kinda. No. Enjoy yourself, fun live life. You‚Äôve done part.  Alot apartments hall way part building ventilation. Ever notice vents bottom doors. ya gonna spread like wild fire buildings. Countries duty protect people first! taken care of, help countries out. forced wear masks school parents fucking stupid get vaccinated. @ me, I'm familiar pathetic counter argument. headline misleading - may wanna read article amend comment, since top-level already acquired lot upward momentum. :)

She fired increased spread, fired increased vaccination efforts (teens), time delta variant causing infection rates rise. 

The editor whoever charge headlines obviously made bit confusing, first impression - fired aforementioned ""new spread."" much, much, likely contracted one 200 cold causing viruses. allergies. seems like mechanically true. also seems like imply asymptomatic cases result transmission less often. know evidence Breakthrough cases resulting hospitalization death. breakthrough cases. Yea feel like sub kind bubble doesn‚Äôt reflect actual life. I‚Äôm Philly everything basically normal. 

And I‚Äôm also healthcare like 90% friends work healthcare. They‚Äôre living lives like always did. Everyone vacationing going out. 

I keep reading comments ‚Äúpoor healthcare workers‚Äù everyone I‚Äôm talking healthcare like ‚Äúit‚Äôs whatever‚Äù point Yea, asymptomatic, one would know those. guessing, unvaccinated 10%, 90% somewhere... Germany changing rules mostly ignore new cases go hospital admissions ICU load. thankful ever get fired new article face  whole family got vaccine shots even know infant hit 104¬∞ fever nowhere. Shit wild. shows vaccines still working Okay fair enough, referring classroom settings 12+ year olds general public areas...didn't even think younger classrooms context discussion. N95. wife showed delta infection caught security camera. person infected walked another person wearing mask exiting building lobby. Less 2 sec space person wearing mask got it. infected person coughing sneezing talking walking by. Delta joke. Yea vaccinated (wifey too) variant fucked us up, fortunately stayed hospital shitty experience, I‚Äôve chicken pox 20, worse. Sometimes underestimate kids though. kids 4 6 last year trouble wearing mask day school. make sure get ones comfortable weren‚Äôt pressed tightly nose mouth weren‚Äôt tight ears. teachers high risk medically helped explain protection around us. victims? show evidence significant negative outcomes school children?

Counterpoint: think logistics issue supply issue. feels like government decided moderna pfizer interchangeable. LOTS vaccines. would send whatever vaccine clinics first doses going out. would imagine would difficult coordinate order second doses, making getting vaccine hard might breed hesitancy. think regardless says, decisions mix made science seemed support matter much may even better mix MRNA vaccines. Keep mind incredibly rare, almost vaccines bad rare side effects.  Im 23 yrs old, got vaccine 10 days infection. i'm bed 40 degrees celsius. However, feel pain trouble breathing!  I‚Äôm going Star Tours I'm high vax rate area too. I'm worried thing keeps spreading mutating vaccines longer offering much protection we're back square one. can't get shots arms, see good way out. least long time. 

It's ironic see want believe ""covid over"" things could make end. 

Other countries speeding us vaccinations. really troubling we've plateaued early near numbers need. mention embarrassing. coincidence highly educated areas US also ones high vaccination rates. lack education areas truly dangerous. think US experience significantly death, hospitalization nowhere near uptake amongst elderly.

In California, 94% people 65+ least one dose vaccine. Across US, 88%. guess UK maybe bit better US still pretty good score. long hoping plane, guess okay. Say 5 times fast got 2 weeks ago. sore arm. feel great! going ok. told half dozen times ""Covid over"". Don‚Äôt need little bit both? they, literal LAW MAKERS, upset telling medical professionals existence LAW? 

So fired her? people power make new laws amend existing ones? 

That's infuriating. thank quoting section see read article (ad block issue?).   This.

There pockets dumb, population across provinces part. Might get 75% eligible population double dosed end July. Jesus fucking Christ, people really heard ""don't let polluting corporations shame using plastic wrapper"" thought ""fuck yes, I'm gonna fly drive fucking everywhere"", you?

I'm literally radical socialist mainly climate crisis. Y'all apathetic apologists pretending like corporate pollution excuses individual footprint dozens times sustainable maximum. high states, though. NJ 67% adults vaccinated, NY. Vermont also 70%. see states getting worse again.  Good!!! - spoken parent children attend CA public schools. *laughs 16 years Merkel, (with quick 7 year between) 16 years Kohl.*  testing method differ countries? Currently dealing w delta variant. Feels like bronchitis. Pfizer 2 dose March. Grateful isn‚Äôt bad end. Hoping subsides quickly Yes, they're asymptomatic means they're likely pass vulnerable people even know case might mild.  That‚Äôs afraid of. Thank you! Yep. owe one. majority sub wouldnt going events even wasn‚Äôt Covid. it‚Äôs really surprising can‚Äôt comprehend anyone would want Wait children get vaccinated, too? Unfortunately typically contagious time symptoms start. would quarantine whole family tested 5 days potential exposure ensure positive passing infection others.  someone who's caregiver elderly stage 4 cancer patient worst nightmare. 

We managed get initial pandemic. what? everything right. there's variant...

It's crushing. lately mix .. since properly tested mixed. know believe tbh seems go back forth things ..but already got em mixed hoping goes well. can't assume natural immunity waning people get COVID vaccinated. vaccine perfect case likely mild. Yes immunity likely wane point, studies shown continued strong resistance.... still something like 99% deaths ICU admissions unvaccinated.... mean can't get sick though, definitely get sick. sorry hospital. hope recover soon.

Out personal curiosity, comfortable answering, vaccine receive issues make higher risk?

I fully vaccinated, medication suppresses immune system science yet tell us well immunocompromised people protected post vaccination. Thank posting. People seemed \*missed\* part earlier transcriptions. anti-vax crowd gonna matter what. hear saying, worry crowd says can't control it. best thing get vaccinated take care yourself. wish could get everyone onboard, sadly they're going learn hard way might late do. yes. even healthy people dying. Covid killing people would otherwise lived, health issues not. regular variant fucked bad symptomatic three days long term symptoms still even getting vaccinated. 

If delta variant infect vaccinated *less* likely kill want fucking know. safe not? 

If reisolate I'm going lose Jesus Christ can't afford anymore damage guts. replied comment comparing Canada US even used graphic compared rates provinces/states.  Today me, tomorrow me.  There‚Äôs line, yes. Won‚Äôt give exact number that‚Äôd trivially pointless, It‚Äôs pretty high number. Higher amount deaths lack mandate causing now. person person basis, number deaths/illnesses cause wearing mask store fully vaccinated (almost always zero hey, vaccine works!) definitely worth comfort level convenience one. Maybe selfish, past year fucking horrible me, mostly due Covid, vaccine ticket out. That‚Äôs got soon possibly could. society wants go back limited restricted life 2020 even months let alone rest life, end me. Honestly. I‚Äôm student. need in-person learning activity. need unrestricted social life. Getting back AMAZING, like get little emotional thinking far we‚Äôve come. need live upcoming years fullest extent. Otherwise start cripple academically, physically, mentally.

It‚Äôs likely going new endemic coronavirus strain like four others circulating. One started last coronavirus pandemic 1889.

Learning live virus way forward. San Francisco currently 90 cases per day climbing fast last week. test positivity rate doubled timeframe. 

That's low compared December scary compared even two weeks  let‚Äôs remember non severe cases means needing supplemental oxygen. sick month, long haul symptoms still considered mild. honest, measures already existed news. new measures different, cover many people.

But exist, that's point. People making fuss policies existed already that's what's ridiculous it. What's new COVID vaccine *included* previous requirements often vaccines preventable diseases. course Yeah suspect makes vaccines pretty much useless. Excellent‚Ä¶. guess stay put. 
We lots water around us, efforts shift water shortage next topic concern, I‚Äôll decent place. 
You guys look decently covered though too. good chance he's working virus years outbreak 

If legitimately think Fauci developed COVID-19, far gone. re-think Facebook groups joining. vaccines also mandatory Slovenia (polio, measles, tuberkulosis) cant really compared covid mean death newborn. fully support vaccines avoid covid shot long can. Nothing conspiracies. new research emerging, new dosages, reliability tests, side effect treatments etc. understand distinction trying make. 

But use different examples want: ""why car seat kid already can't speed?"" whatever. 

You trying say people something enhance safety ALSO eliminate another safety measure potential harmful outcome. see contexts. Tennessee rapidly heading there. roads disaster gigantic craters busiest highways. Truckers named TN's roadways worst highways intersections entire union.Their bridges collapsing due poor maintenance. roads properly graded turning place business roadways graded noticeably higher road causing damage. biggest problem overwhelming amount dumbasses say TN overcrowded, full, continue electing people allow unregulated growth area leading unnecessary congestion poor infrastructure. leaked emails Might worth try room attempt earnest. ready move family members ‚Äúnon-contaminated‚Äù area quarantined room section symptoms additional testing dictates.

Just keep mind, you‚Äôre vaccinated fine near certain level confidence.

Also, don‚Äôt let beat hard. nothing wrong. Stuff like going happen vaccines almost always minimal worry.  example, Canada gave second-dose mRNA people got first-dose AZ

Partially true - gave people choice. got AZ first shot, get mRNA second, AZ second - you.

Many people got double-shotted AZ first give blood clot, second almost certainly won't.  Ah - family doctor strategy didn‚Äôt actually materialise? 

Indeed, fourth wave could potentially dramatic given sudden upswing Netherlands.  Pfizer stock Jan 2019... studied medical health still refuse vaccine you‚Äôre lost cause.  say finished Phase III trials November better healthcare, prescriptions prices, education prices America. Lol discriminating healthcare workers take vaccines forever countries. work patients don‚Äôt wanna risk others. you‚Äôre vaccines don‚Äôt work hospital you‚Äôre joke. Hold up, think Fauci humans responsible developing specific virus lab?  üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº extra protection, well hedge development vaccine resistant strain. read anything u/ImYoric wrote? let Covid run rampant unvaccinated population without restrictions vaccinated person *unavoidably* exposed point protection imperfect protection get vaccine.

The reason small percentage fully vaccinated people hospitalized short timeframe even fully vaccinated people count statistic, timeframe would gotten Covid even without vaccine. longer timeframe without protection everybody *can* get Covid *will* get Covid, includes (probably) unvaccinated people multiple percentage points vaccinated, means millions fully vaccinated people get disease hundreds thousands end badly.

It's simply true restrictions protecting unvaccinated, though obviously main beneficiaries. would healthcare workers want get sick spread sickness? evidence? look forward goalpost moves vaccines gets full approval. live PSW worker everyone workplace received shots except ONE person refuses. really hope Canada follows!  possible know, definitely see raising vaccination rates. I've seen lot anti-vaxxer style comments subreddit saying they'll get vaccinated FDA approved, fact makes ""risky"" ""experimental. 

It's anecdotal guessing, personally think America see marked increase. vaccine? stop masks right? would anybody going health worker field would want anybody get sick Covid-19?  care elaborate ? would fine people would get shots, lot still going out. That's called hypothetical. Imagine applies give answer.

Also guy know negative accepted risk infecting lot people. what's point? question rhetorical. protect? kids? really get sick covid. teachers/parents? Get vaccine... inconsistency social distancing, staying home restrictions considered infringement human rights? vaccination considered so?  already stop red lights, regardless wearing seat belt. option ""Wear seat belt stop red lights, put roll cage reinforced bumpers car to."" Someone might enticed roll cage reinforced bumpers means stop red lights anymore. tell ""No, still stop red lights wear seat belt,"" would choose keep wearing seat belts (or not) stop get upgrades. 

But nice false equivalency. bet thought sounded good. Next time think through. One coworkers religious uses excuse get vaxxed.

Here‚Äôs thing, he‚Äôs catholic, pope setup vaccine clinics Vatican. 

It NOTHING religion, damn thing stubborn asshole doesn‚Äôt believe pandemic real. 

This man would occasionally see pandemic would always another story insufferable idiot.

This convo‚Äôs devolving reckless histrionics. Please take elsewhere; I‚Äôm interested strawmen. I'm saying green pass dangerous people get permanent pass, even infected ones, know can't really people right thing. single U.S. health official said boosters could risk serious side effects.

Thanks info. seems like Reuters agenda here, newspaper inadvertently copied agenda copied Reuters article. sad major newspaper still purposely spreads harmful misinformation agenda. family reacts like vaccinated, imagine bad could vaccinated. vaccine might saved one hospital visit.

While true many cases, travelling tourism purposes, also family visits, work, etc  Yep. comparing apples oranges. Sorry yes, 12+. screenshot says 33 cases/day. 

You trying use 1-day number, trying use MOnday number. That's improper two reasons:

1) preliminary subject large changes, 

2) cases go Mondays even Tuesdays there's reporting weekends. use 7-day averages. hit nail head. wasn‚Äôt accident surprise. Tennessee voters chose this. I‚Äôm here, still waiting Novavax get EUA. can‚Äôt seriously talking ivermectin Hydroxychoroquine. garbage never end. It‚Äôs 18 months. mention China refuses recognize vaccine Sinovac least effective vaccine around? That's scientific method performed. make Decisions based data evidence, Reddit, hearsay. can't adopt attitude of: ""well, think change singular article says so, joe blow road says so"" no, it. Everything taken consideration consensus made. like outcome, make incorrect process, somehow broad set knowledge lol, 2 days week, recalled (with every-fucking-body) office 1st july. because. think need dictatorship want citizens country die pointlessly.  9.7% nothing compared rest market time span. Also, Trump's buddies Pfizer? CEO hates hoping, like respiratory symptoms, people vaccinated infected delta minimal damage scarier covid effects. worry long covid vascular damage. hoping vaccine body stop virus causes lasting damage. consistently care facts data. lie things political motivations (masks airborne spread) make conscious choices selectively track things like breakthrough infections toward similar ends.

Great! good caving social pressure ‚Äúbe normal.‚Äù I‚Äôve gotten used complete ‚Äúweirdo‚Äù Florida. haven‚Äôt contracted covid, it‚Äôs good prize. üòÄ ‚Ä¶. isn‚Äôt hard set second dose go it. jobs paying go not, can‚Äôt punish going. get time get it. don‚Äôt understand. quote taken context.  meant people listen health officials pick choose vaccine want. would think really problem countries track vaccine already well. realize CDC science also public policy right? rules combo both. failed miserably public policy aspect. 

The reality half country basically insane believe nothing real. CDC dealing unfortunate reality creating policies. 

And btw- delta problem us vaccinated. didn‚Äôt even follow fucking science one. think vitally important understand much risk passing others vaccination. Especially increased infectivity new variances. whole ""Because slightly related verified metric, theory worry best case scenario"" thought process driving policy getting really old point.

It cost thousands lives ""the virus probably airborne, masks necessary"" caused millions disabilities ""The main concern mortality exceedingly rare among young healthy"" causing millions infections ""Children probably substantial driving force viral spread, masks needed coming school year"" ""There little risk vaccinated severe symptoms little risk passing disease others, masks social distancing needed vaccinated.""

The truth is, soon know wish could drive policy assuming worst finally get handle situation maybe save lives prevent flood long-term disabilities. Honest question... alternative VARES that's reliable?  Yes, matter policy, understand. I‚Äôm talking world now. lot healthy treat covid vaccines like flu vaccines (skip them) they‚Äôre told getting covid anyway. risk mild. feel like shit days, miss work, miss pay, etc thanks vaccine? You‚Äôll get vaccine, get covid, 14 day quarantine anyway!

Lol.. crazy. need downvote - right - need take 3-4X recommended dose least day suffer acute liver failure. may take 1-2 times recommended dose Tylenol get ""extra"" elsewhere. easy everything. Here's list common counter drugs include Tylenol least formulations (not including off-brand equivalents):

It's easy imagine scenarios take multiple these. cold/fever grab Tylenol fever Sudafed PE cold. also period cramps, grab Midol. One symptoms headache always take Excedrin. frequently allergies sure cold allergies decide grab Benadryl regularly take well. time bed, grab Nyquil addition topping Midol, Sudafed, Tylenol. Boom, easily 5X recommended dose depending frequently took them. 

Sounds crazy written out, easy this, especially different times day experience different symptoms.

There's also issue addictive opioids include (basically government request make ""harder"" abuse end lower Schedule classification) many folks end overdosing drugs order get ever-escalating opioid fix. slightly separate issue. wonder case tbh number people present went second dose low. queue efficient hardly anyone there. counted 35 waiting area post shot. interesting see drop numbers end being. know lot people area stuck remote learning public schools done end year moving private schools even though mask mandates probably going place. school districts CA maintaining mask policy could enough motivate people fence staying public switch.

Read comments. MIN AGO
Vaccine prevent deaths, new delta strain less lethal nature, simple that. new mutated virus strain,less lethal virus form covid, vaccine protecting from.Remember ,not flu strains virulence every year either, make new vaccine every MIN AGO
Are increased deaths though?
The current vaccines prevent people infected registering such, prevent severe sickness likelihood death comes it. unless people dying high rate along new infections, especially vaccinated, can't see cause alarm MIN AGO
Of course numbers going according hospitals. want get paid. Hospitals greedy businesses making money first HR AGO
Wonder many vaccination? Wonder many still wear/wore masks?
I'd also like see ages patients hospitalized...willing bet they're elderly. Well, that's part parcel American's failed response. South Korea high availability usage KN95 masks they've controlled pandemic far better US. US made KN95s widely available free cheap actually enforced them, doubt would question. another example ""we something poorly, must mean work."" beginning June, \~5% Canadian population received 2nd shot. Sometime week cross United States reach \~50% population 2nd shot. kind things country achieve everyone excited vaccination. Sample size six, two vaccine... chance bad side effects people able miss work  hear majority people refused take personal responsibility protecting community would pass blame every opportunity, given not, blame authority everything. sure get statistic from, way mark. 

It definitely looks like we're working different statistics :)

I basing summary study vaccine results Israel. seem remember took account people vaccinated least 3 months (or 6? remember). I'll try find  0.003% fully vaccinated people hospitalized Covid US  (I can't find data France, likely since rare detect otherwise media would frenzy it).

Interesting point.

The raw(er) data point seem take account time, e.g. vaccinate someone, they're unlikely fall sick within 7 days, everybody unlikely fall sick within 7 arbitrarily chosen days.

Amy: wanna something, it, splick consequences! Hospitalization increase levels able handle it. Even states low vaccination rates, 70% 60+ population vaccinated. know Delta variant hits younger population harder previous variants huge concern.
 *oh no, anyways* literally even take long stuck last year

Can explain mean this? enough immunity prevent transmission, over. matter long stuck whatever talking about, us bit good current situation. People gotten vaccinated enough stop it, still spreads. Nothing last year would change that. agree  giving many Moderna shots problem, adding kids mix something can't imagine?

Not clear getting at, hence downvotes. Thanks additional info! interesting.

Glad able get it. think it, comment back find elicited antibody response time? I‚Äôm quite interested.

It seems help cellular immunity even don‚Äôt elicit antibodies, obviously would great third dose made happen well. millions people vaccine. 30% probably test positive exposed. according average vaccine responding delta variant. long dying ending long term issues fingers crossed reach herd immunity next fun variant shows up. basically intrusion state [Bodily one highest values western world.

Correct I'm wrong. reason average age getting lower older groups started getting vaccinated essentially removed hospitalized demographic. Go look UK right now, cases went 2k/day 33k/day.

There **whole big world** outside US. 

If would like remain ignorance problem. don‚Äôt drag people you. 

People literally every day sharing first hand experiences variants countries varying levels vaccination uptake. 

The data literally shows number deaths severity Delta virus hitting India. 

At time India well enough donating vaccines countries. short space time healthcare systems overwhelmed. 

There video there. Go look it. 

I tell personal experience Gamma/P1 variant hit country way differently original strain. 

A healthcare system held year almost overwhelmed. happened fast. 

You choose learn experiences others choose remain echo chamber. sound fun! didn‚Äôt get stimulus checks. sure got one. 7-11 cashiers don‚Äôt make $150k. Thats bad. Lots Canadians used AZ first dose, best better nothing. (Its actually really good). Hopefully countries receive use think fully understand scenario person responded discussing I'll give perspective parent Texas. Here's facts:

1. Parents ensure kids enrolled attend school kind breaking law actually cops come them.

2. Texas governor banned mask mandates requirements schools government buildings putting limitations people order prevent COVID (e.g. can't ban recess P.E. enclosed areas social distancing well fight COVID.)

3. Kids 12 able vaccinated school year starts. last heard, Pfizer going seek permission vaccinate kids 12 potentially September, optimistically we'd probably looking October earliest first batch kids able immunity.

4. lot parents communities anti-mask anti-vaccine, complain loudly time school district something try keep kids safer. result school district going stick necks fight back state government face foaming mouth anti-vaxxers.

My kids wearing masks taking precautions took prior wife vaccinated end vaccinated. choices basically a) pull school homeschool they're going fall behind can't act surrogate teachers, b) send in-person classes they'll get better education risk COVID vaccinated. There's good option frankly, Delta variant think would lot hand-wringing masks. 

As risks, think focusing death COVID huge mistake, since say risk long COVID symptoms 50% (although fair, I've seen studies low 20% 40%.) I'd prefer risk kids long-term problems this. Parents extremely difficult position right now.  almost like religious cult~~ure~~ cult~~ure~~ that's easily tricked bullshit something.

FTFY Lots reasons. Ethics. Due Process Clause Constitution. Supreme Court. desire avoid civil war. might depend country.  It‚Äôs amazing people continue cling idea kids ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get‚Äù ‚Äúdon‚Äôt spread‚Äù covid. 

This separate severely affected it, overwhelmingly generally true.

But lot people literally think kids don‚Äôt get it. Just‚Ä¶because. It‚Äôs mind blowing. one respiratory illness acts differently others we‚Äôve ever encountered doesn‚Äôt infect transmit humans 12?! It‚Äôs nuts

I coworkers saying ‚Äúbut kids never really got it‚Äù showed cdc data showed indeed did, approximately 2/3 rate adults, kind said oh yeah‚Ä¶.and could tell somehow didn‚Äôt even believe that.

It‚Äôs coincidence soon kids went back school, every time, within month, area‚Äôs covid cases started climb rapidly.

Really hope get kids vaccines authorized next month two, it‚Äôs looking great. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going cause massive carnage like last year vax wall that‚Äôs built lot society now, fear kid cases spread creating hollow statistics lead people panicking, well obviously don‚Äôt want cases need be.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* mentioned Doc (Urologist) last week discussed anti-vax movement. seems like anti-vax folks like clutch onto sources data easily manipulate support confirmation biases. use spread fear misinformation. specifically mentioned sites VAERS openEU internet allowed millions report ""anything"" happened post-vaccine try correlate vaccine itself. wife actually works CDC Virginia. said stated kitchen table, vaers openeu taken grain salt corroborated. specifically validate it, says team sifting medical records based reports much seems bullshit. even mentioned purge hundred data records originated Russia using U.S.-based Proxy/VPN pile misinformation within database. vaers openeu great sources information, easily manipulated. trust something odd vaccine, CDC report it, have. Thank much. curious. Canada us AstraZeneca first dose got mRNA vaccine second dose. example, got Moderna 2nd shot. also friends Pfizer first, got Moderna second. really weird government allow get Pfizer saving 12-18 years old.

I glad feel better now. Like said, could worse. Stay safe take care! Americans need start developing critical thinking skills, again. see, big difference ""near future"" ""over next 40 years."" thought guy talking 5 years like ""No way."" Maybe communities high vaccination rates. live place like fully vaccinated rate still 40% looking potential trouble. Sure, many non-vaccinated people self-inflicted trauma, still going deal communities. Enjoy stimulus checks. 

I get second stimulus check. That's ""dead end"" job work.

Projection much? Maybe little self-reflection would good buddy. Blocking now. good day! **say little louder** **when vaccinated** Considering Florida's low vaccination percentage, school starting district August 2nd, spread Delta, point eventually cases go down? Currently, due laws regulations, can't ask students wear masks (I teach state University) son's school/ daycare ""masks optional"" better daycares deny Covid even exists. probably going look like Delta wave UK Israel, cases hospitalizations increasing much less past waves death increasing much less past waves. hospitalization rate isn‚Äôt age dependent mortality rate, it‚Äôs still age dependent. Seniors 4-15x likely hospitalized Covid 18-29 year olds, according CDC. seniors vaccinated, see uncoupling case rates hospitalizations. dramatic drop mortality rate, still important, especially hospital capacity still what‚Äôs driving public policy. Lol

Hope get long covid Sinovac first shot AZ second shot

That seems risky unproven (and logistical nightmare boot)... give half doses AZ half doses Sinovac?  fact they're [half fully vaccinated seems like bizarre experiment me.

Like *hopefully* hospitals handle vulnerable people safe virus evolve new tricks. There's really reason think could work. odds would much better waited vaccinate people. People show Covid symptoms tested covid proper authorities given enough data points see community spread disease. Well gave answer, it?  Well care idiots. got COVID May last year, almost died twice hospital pneumonia weeks later. since flu jab, pneumonia jab Pfizer COVID jabs year.

Suspect going forward main casualties COVID anti-vaxers.

It would interesting statistic. neighbor's son son's wife want get vaccine. son's wife Covid trying care two kids since son military stint. faafo, guess. already it, advise try "" [Smell "". think they‚Äôre asking get idea impact vaccines. 12 can‚Äôt get jab. curious well. Well bugs‚Ä¶ Spanish flu mutated less deadly, still prevalent today. herd immunity. Covid got vaccinated chance. sick day vaccination (Moderna) assure nothing compared sick Covid hospitalization 6 days. loss breathing scariest thing life. Seeing children, can't even imagine mean cdc pretty clear vaxxed don‚Äôt need wear masks say unvaccinated. country failed them? could get life saving vaccine today year half novel pandemic‚Ä¶ pretty sure without America would possible. can‚Äôt speak them. I‚Äôd hope so. I‚Äôm worried own. Genuine question - taking long? resource describes approval process? Same. panicked lymph nodes swelled researched learned normal took vaccine shows body's immune system reacting. almost gone feel fine still bit worry know reactions vaccines might given me. Overall, say take vaccine. would disaster, put 2/3 population's body refuse fully approve Macron quite populist. Earlier pandemic seemed like vaccine skepticism politically expedient, Macron flying antivax flag. French getting vaccinated higher rate polls predicted, Macron changing tune. mean fair lot medical professionals left leave profession this, either due burn wanting deal people. *Sigh* Again?

The numbers published daily Rospotrebnadzor *operative data*, include people, whose death registered previous day determined COVID primary cause death confirmed PCR tests.

Rosstat (the national statistics agency) publishes ""natural population movement"" reports (births, deaths, marriages, divorces) monthly include separate sheet COVID deaths four groups: COVID primary cause death; COVID suspected primary cause death; COVID primary cause significantly contributed; COVID neither primary cause significantly contributed. know. Even people know safe logical entire time, got vaccinated, went window. Even people kids 12! It‚Äôs covid disappeared isn‚Äôt thing anymore. Only‚Ä¶it lesson covid vaccination dangers disease seem learned one family time among certain groups people. 

It's fake problem strikes someone near them, even then, going really honest happened why. think parents kids would let get vaccinated? Great, make sense anymore.


You telling lies, even saying variant vaccines. Like seriously!?! .. 


What's next comment? Protein shedding? 5G chips? Black Plague(I know caused bacterium, still infectious disease) best example think of. 

And know price was. Even back days Justinian making rounds, killed staggering portion population. 

There smaller plagues floated around Europe, they'd literally seal people homes take extreme measures quarantine people. 

And finally, Spanish Flu. cost 1/3 world's population.


I agree you, I'm saying...there infinitely painful ways achieve herd immunity, sure. surprised due brainwashed, litigious parents. made mom sick three days. know four people work days well. know many people little symptoms seem uncommon people strong reactions. 

I definitely got worst flu life two weeks quit wearing masks. able shit week.  really matter? makes sense. Thanks. ""Its FDA approved, I'm gonna wait know safe.""

*later*

""I trust government entity tell whether safe.""

Sometimes there's reasoning folks. You‚Äôre right. people vaccinated, fewer people die. I'm understanding correctly 1/3 current COVID-induced ventilations children?

If new different information basically glossed report. square regions around world Delta outbreaks. PARENTS failing them. Spouting antivax/antimask crap throwing respectable-looking link become common tactic spreading disinformation and/or intentionally misrepresenting data ‚Ä¶ us don‚Äôt regularly click read hyperlinks. 

It bannable offense, imho. HAGUE, July 13 (Reuters) - New coronavirus cases Netherlands jumped six-fold past week, mainly among young adults, following decision largely scrap restrictions. Confirmation fastest weekly rise since start pandemic came days government reintroduced curbs nightclubs, festivals restaurants response surge infections among 18 30 year olds. system health checks mandatory coronavirus rapid tests venues social distancing could guaranteed put place, cracked large number people looking night months lockdown. Well yes I've seen UK numbers 95% 60+yo vaccinated, 75% 30-60yo 60% 18-30yo.

I'd say good numbers everyone who's risk dying protected, reason escalate things make available whoever wants it.

I agree certified important, may bring vaccine reluctant onboard people trust process data transparent enough gets picked wider public. Bullshit article bullshit newspaper. kids get seriously ill COVID mean won't. would err side caution, really care problem that. people died vaccine Covid? Yes. let live life live yours. vaccine works, fine. worry fired precisely trying job correctly. Many doses Pfizer Moderna vaccine given J&amp;J vaccine. No, vaccinated people spread too, variants likely vaccinated people. shown variants nonsense starting starting vaccinations  way protection rest society getting vaccinated, about? ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs going 1508 people dying per day it‚Äôs going up. sure argument trying make. UK‚Äôs numbers leveled off. keep rising. many long-term studies COVID? People already dead likely stay dead long term sure. survivors? long take smell come back? Smell disappeared neuron damage: long term effects brain? many years life expectancy people ¬´mild¬ª version lose?

These questions asking.

Small reminder: COVID vaccines part virus genome (the part lets immune system recognize it, part allows virus replicate). afraid vaccine, terrified virus.

Also: people vaccinating health decisions me. ok long stay away me. law allows live life long take risks give (again‚Ä¶) COVID.  explain mean? would guess vaccines administered approximately amount. Good thing I‚Äôm medical professional would phoning f*ck ‚Äúcare‚Äù people like this. No, wish tie back like presumed.

I asked lot people argue think want happen, they'd actually too.

Overall far apart think phrasing bit rough. 29 per week ~8 per day. 1500 people died every day pre covid. yes, wrong, 0 risk, vaccine safer pub full unvaccinated people got covid driving  I'll add bit.

When compared Western Europe North America, less likely rush doctor anything, said two categories diseases: bullshit fucking shit - former recover own, later untreatable, case there's point going doctor.

Of people know got COVID none panicked none talking afterwards unless relevant conversation.

In perception percentage people vaccines general wary COVID vaccines specifically high. read comments Russian news site regarding COVID find people, usually either mistrust Russian-made vaccines (because ""the industry shambles, made anything decent"") wait approval Western vaccine (Chinese-made mistrusted too), mistrust COVID vaccines due speed development lack long-term testing, finding real-life difficult. Personally, know one guy later group (and none former), position summarized ""Ours probably water labels show, guys Europe could actually injecting people untested stuff"". Wow! one 2 things convinced her? How‚Äôd it? understood well. would essentially mutate whole new virus evade mRNA shots. 

Still worrisome, thinking fall - young kids going back school, people huddling inside. I'm much worried fully vaccinated people know - gonna ripple effects society take toll ways. Hopefully there's enough vector take hospital systems again. 

And hope mutate way causes severe illness small children. would nightmare scenario fall. know. :( feel sorry kids. find hilarious gave one link thought proved conspiracy theory turned ton evidence pointed he's like ""no bro, ignore that, let throw another one"" one also emphasized importance mask wearing. Hopefully absurd idea reversed soon. worry much downvotes, sub pure zealots really representative.

Oh actually nevermind, rule indeed reversed already. Sanity prevails. Nice thought, not. That's wrong. also danger others, contaminate them, spread virus create new variants..  One question much age new cases lowered. we've seen age go before, like fall/winter, hospitalizations/deaths still shot up. example Nov 22, 2020  fewer people dying COVID-19, even cases surge**  demographic shift clear ‚Äî 18-to-29-year-olds lately accounting largest share new cases across age groups. mind.

Anyone forcing masks children point operating completely alternate reality. I'm nervous although I'm vaccinated I'm going catch variant. can't anything... state officials need figure way get vaccination rates up. Recently attended first Catholic wedding surprised much mass children sole purpose advancing God's kingdom love... all. Fair enough. What's complicated answer? look? went averaging 9 deaths per week last month 29 deaths per week today. Last month 7k cases week, 33k. math, seems like deaths actually outpacing known cases. 

There never deaths like last year, also seeing deaths aren‚Äôt staying flat either. Yeah average age death relatively unchanged. every senior citizen vaccinated. Reinstate? US ever vaccine/negative test mandates indoor dining? hope Germany follows Ask supplements essential oils haven‚Äôt FDA approved, then.  Dropping mask mandate encouraged antivaxxers begrudgingly wearing masks times drop masks entirely. Lol...how on-ramp onto freeway! retroactively makes approved cause don‚Äôt want scare people

congrats yall coming new excuse anti-vaxxers going use approved.

""Well course approved it. to. I'm still taking politically motivated"" reason EU waited another month got full approval starting vaccinations. almost definitely marketing play pharma companies discredit companies, secure brand loyalty. vaccine industry profitable long term, need make much $$$ possible shortest time possible. Everyone emotionally fragile moment, secure future sales/brand loyalty bring yearly booster shot. Let‚Äôs forget pharma dirty business‚Ä¶  Oh yeah, too. Actually mom developed neurological issue Covid unfounded fear. Luckily something permanent, still messed up. I‚Äôve already seen ‚ÄúOkay, anything FDA approved doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs safe.‚Äù Literally stupidest thing I‚Äôve ever read many long-term studies vaccine? tyranny trying make health decisions people. guess, still risk. plenty people also get vaccinated. There's separate system travelling, difference test result signed doctor, certifying done properly person took test. entry requirements determined national governments, I've travelled decent amount within EU never needed PCR test. approval really formality point? I'm fine following letter normal procedure, especially since practical level pretty good reason trust vaccines pretty safe wide majority people. look UK data, data already proven wrong finally convinced fence-sitting friend get vaccinated! i'm terrified even feels one ache, going blame refuse get second shot lol oh boy. Bonus points, parents anti-vaxxers going behind back.   want mask mandates now, boosters might eventually needed? Boosters might needed yearly, think mask mandate permanent? odd hope mask mandate vaccine working? logical hope mandate instated protection starts waning (if does, know yet)? Thank you!!!! much information want share parents, can't. Unfortunately, think Fauci untrustworthy, FDA hands tied matter. argue many people vaccinated already, approve vaccines save face. threaten liberty? illustrate me?

I impression France longer full right body since today, maybe freedom part French core principles anymore

But correct wrong, please specific unvaccinated people threatens parents flying US weekend visit family terrified. fully vaccinated seniors, healthiest shape. flying 15 hours straight. 

Whereas home country cautious going out, US know they'll visiting multiple relatives, going public general sight-seeing. tried convince wait least couple months traveling listen. Yes, know vaccines work, I'm vaccinated chances hospitalized extremely low. can't help feel anxiety suppose needed place share. oo wish they‚Äôd specific. teenagers toddlers? know supposed get flu vaccine every year right? raw numbers, rate implying random chance. posed hypothetical scenario, also reason rigid process. Americans dying weren‚Äôt wearing masks, acted covid hoax, still gathered large groups stadiums, selling games, generally cocks whole thing. lack vaccine didn‚Äôt cause that, stupid selfish mindsets killed them.

New Zealand got 0 cases vaccine even produced stuck game plan, don‚Äôt blame people dying lack vaccines available right away, that‚Äôs true. Immunocompromised people TIME wait this. Delta blowing NOW. plan watch ass CDC said don‚Äôt wear mask obvious virus airborne.

You clearly want believe certain narrative. CDC said February 12, currently recommend use face masks general public. virus spreading community. sick patient investigation hospitalized, CDC recommends wearing face mask around people entering health care provider‚Äôs office, alone, home, need wear mask. People close contact someone novel coronavirus, example, household contacts care givers people known suspected 2019, I‚Äôm sorry, nCoV 2019, wear face mask room patient patient able wear face mask. Health care personnel wear PPE including respirators caring confirmed possible nCoV patients they‚Äôre direct contact patients increases risk exposure. 

Want guess many new cases US day? Zero. also clearly suspected airborne. worked CDC back then, would made call. easy sit here, year half later, act like everyone known know now. Here's light reading effects asymptomatic mild/moderate cases. seems there's lot we're still discovering effects Covid-19 duration. Asymptomatic equal absence ill effects... done prevaccine. might see... say, logical \*assume\* improvement think lot people also assumed mild symptoms also meant nothing happening internally aware of.  
 
‚ÄúThe researchers found elevations C5b9 pediatric patients severe COVID-19 MIS-C, surprise, also found C5b9 elevated patients minimal asymptomatic disease. 22 patients complete data available, 19 (86%) met criteria TMA \[thrombotic microangiopathy\]. Additionally, sC5b9 levels elevated patients meet criteria TMA. Although children COVID-19 severe disease, study shows may effects SARS-CoV-2 worthy investigation.‚Äù

Just fun off-topic bc people who've hospitalized Covid-19 (versus studies they've admitted reasons happened Covid-19), here's neat table literature friends keep asking I'm still cautious even though I'm vaccinated. two year old daughter can't get vaccine yet!  agree, bannable offense, misleading best.

Glad read link, followed called BS. definitely need follow like that. Sorry Dr. Fauci, didn‚Äôt realize talking expert üòÇ  Yes. me. started killing healthy toddlers statistically significant rate, would quit job stay home mom. Majority do. minority dragging us down, frustrating heck cause leadership country support lies conspiracies. vaccine efficacy ratio comparing vaccinated unvaccinated. 

If 90% effective, means 10 unvaccinated people would gotten it, instead 1 vaccinated person would. 

That's great vaccines wonderful, still means cases go general, also go vaccinated people. Rationally, vaccinated people want cases go up. .. it‚Äôs even winter yet.  it‚Äôs starting surge now, imagine what‚Äôs going happen areas cold weather arrives people go indoors? Ditto Alabama. MS &amp; AL bottom nearly every good list top nearly every bad list.

Go ahead, someone bring football. can't believe tried both-sides plague lol. majority tweets see pretty much state isn‚Äôt option

It's literally option.

There's putting genie back bottle. We've completely eradicated couple diseases throughout human history going happen Covid.

Likewise, viruses cause common cold likely deadly people enough immunity make mild moderate annoyance. *Sigh* you‚Äôre probably right  Nah fam, time they've emergency approval. meditation work.

*shocked pikachu face* Joe weak lets Trudeau walk him. border would open long ago (for vaccinated people) last president. Even Gottlieb screaming rooftops they‚Äôre needed. face nation week (I‚Äôm paraphrasing) said (Pfizer) believe people (mostly older people vaccinated early) may benefit third dose going fall. make possible, need study submit info fda 2-3 months, option available it‚Äôs deemed necessary/beneficial. Delta variants going even worse them. roll dice without vaccine. way happens, goalposts move. ""FDA corrupt"", ""I never trusted FDA"", etc. Yes have. there's ton differences time. surprising someone would think predict going happen surge based happened last surge. Probably not, people clutched pearls said ""what unimaginable devastation"" thousand people died China Italy, said predictions 200,000 deaths US outlandishly apocalyptic. numbers blew past though immediately began rationalizing making excuses. hundred thousand died still said nothing burger, need ""get serious"" reopen offices joke people in-person work. 

Given way people reacted claimed impossible fearmongering kept coming true, I'm pretty sure would've behaved exactly 10% mortality rate killed age groups equal proportions. Sounds like easy wrongful termination case win, especially told poking bear writing relatively close termination hear you. posted early vaccinated. felt nothing either shot. impacted. mean obviously people realized it‚Äôs pretty mild compared actually getting covid. It‚Äôs shame people still nervous Populism hell drug. evidence claim? sick depressing many sociopaths there

Psychologists telling us long time 30%. 1 every 3. Technically say 30% Dark Triad traits. maybe people believe them. likely reject approval would approve people 60 example, risk benefits look different. still do. Yep. Backwards ass, easily manipulated people stuck past corrupt, conniving Party. pandemic wait proper approval pandemic would almost making vaccine useless. Look deaths per day USA since introduction vaccines Jan, gone significantly down. issue cost vs benefits. already major studies showing effectiveness, going massive monitoring rolled out. Indeed, problems one vaccine found. kind wish side effects weren‚Äôt bad

They're not. sore arm day first shot felt like hangover hours day second one. Everyone know worst cold/flu-like symptoms day. tiny tiny percentage people severe reaction feel like need broadcast world reason. Since ground - think likely cause? Education? Opportunity? Poverty? Politics? it?  People always exactly like this.  Careful...that gets downvoted reported around parts. wouldn‚Äôt make news infections didn‚Äôt happen, asymptomatic. We‚Äôre reading norm used stoke uncertainty. thousands exposures every day don‚Äôt turn infections you‚Äôre vaccinated pose threat kids anyone else. C‚Äômon now. least we're opening slower many countries. Night clubs allowed open September, provided number cases etc low enough. Thank sharing life me, kind stranger. appreciate perspective attention nuanced impacts COVID been‚Äîespecially mental health. Right away, pleased read mother empathy subsets population unable protect themselves. feel you, family, present day life. Sadly, similar situation played across world millions families.

As ‚Äî first-time father knowing it‚Äôs like care pregnant wife raise baby pandemic. nesting *real*. biggest concern child know long-term effects virus. stay dormant host random event triggers reactivation?

I say ‚Äî zero fucks give healthy adults choose receive vaccine, including parents small children. reason virus mutates pandemic continues becomes endemic. Californian, support 1000%. kind thing want kids vaccinated despite popular people say stuff like ""kids get sick"". part get. Polio vaccine mandatory since 1966 (Italy), 2019 96% children aged 4 indeed taken it.

I really understand antivaxxers seem think vaccine mandatory adults limitation freedom mandatory children never problem.
They freedom-limiting mandating car decent condition order allowed road.  UK recognizing *any* vaccine given NHS.

I fully vaccined, incidence rate 6.5, incidence UK 300 quarantine entering UK. fully vaccined Britian quarantine Germany. Companies choice TFL making masks compulsory underground, trains buses London  point Consider them. Given warped acceptance dystopian restrictions changed drastically since we‚Äôve gotten safer. Weird vaccine passports garnered massive support numbers dropped massively wont know isolated theyve contagious week though. Again, dont IMMEDIATELY show signs sick, contagious showing signs sick.

They felt fine, reason isolate going around public spreading week ever know even it.

What point even trying make here, aside proving dont know viruses work? States like Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, etc. going get wrecked Delta Fall get heads asses vaccination soon. realize legal precedent forced vaccination (Jacobson v Michigan) later cited reason eugenics (Buck v Bell), later Japanese internment camps US (Korematsu).

And new Civil Rights Disability Protections made sure precedents rarely cited. find good law debates believe Kennedy Dershowitz even Barnes good job. jurisdiction approve (or not) drugs EU though? approved something, mean approved elsewhere.

I suggesting countries delegate public health review process WHO? EMA, FDA, health Canada delegate WHO?

No, work like definitely shouldn't.

Again, Edit: mean FDA inspected emergent plant wait who?

I know talking here. think FDA right inspect factories approve vaccines medicines use US citizens.

I really think anything we're discussing here. is: France reject travelers vaccinated approved vaccine European countries like Germany accept functionally identical AZ? Indeed massive opparation companies need verify, ready yet like miles away. speaking American. opinion, EU single entity.

Well opinion wrong. thing coordinate vaccine procurement DCC system (meaning actual certificate - many doses need enter not).  
Everything else inidividual countries rules vary wildly. amount unvaccinated people real risk (not kids) incredibly small. It‚Äôs choice Yeah, hard time believing maybe 5% people hesitating officially approved threads going take is. taken look graph covid cases Hungary? Can't argue results. open bus windows let outside air circulate bus. South Carolina warm year round. I‚Äôm unaware anything like that, although read everything. certainly think it‚Äôs something reasonable wonder assume studies interested read them.

I however think it‚Äôs pretty reasonable read lines based know vaccines. 

Knowing prevent bare minimum majority infections (could change antibodies wane, even pessimistic current reports 64% efficacy preventing infection), case breakthroughs elicit immune responses clear virus quicker (which means less chance pervade damage systems) keep viral load lower (less virus pervade damage systems).

Couple fact yes, things happen asymptomatic/mild cases, likely severe cases (I don‚Äôt numbers cite given massive amount people recovered fine think it‚Äôs fair general assertion), think it‚Äôs pretty reasonable assume it‚Äôs POSSIBLE vaccinated asymptomatic cases long-term complications, reasonable assume would significantly reduced.

KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysia reported 11,079 new coronavirus cases Tuesday (July 13), first time daily infections hit five figures, amid health crisis seen hospitals Covid-19 assessment centres flooded patients.

The previous daily record logged three days ago Saturday, 9,353 cases. Tuesday also saw 125 deaths record 972 patients intensive care.

At 855,949 cases overall, Malaysia one South-east Asia‚Äôs highest per-capita infection rates.

One reasons rise emergence Delta variant spread via airborne transmission, said Health director-general Noor Hisham Abdullah.

‚ÄúWe informed Delta variant dominant variant,‚Äù told news conference.

The number infections projected increase next two weeks stabilising, added.

There concerns rising number cases, deaths patients hospitals, even large chunks Malaysia including Selangor KL seventh week total lockdown, government boasting high number people inoculated.

Nearly 11.8 million Malaysians received least one dose vaccine Monday, 24.8 per cent population, said Health Minister Adham Baba. included 11.3 per cent (3.68 million) received full dosage.

Social media awash video clips pictures bodies piling hospitals.

A viral 15-minute video uploaded YouTube Monday purportedly distressed frontliners comparing healthcare system Klang Valley - Malaysia‚Äôs populated districts comprising KL, Putrajaya Selangor - sunken ship.

‚ÄúWe replacing oxygen canisters hour. patients might required share oxygen five patients,‚Äù said unnamed frontliner.

No images frontliners shown voices appeared altered protect identities, gag order health workers making unauthorised comments.

Meanwhile, vaccination centre Selangor capital Shah Alam shut day Tuesday 204 workers tested positive Covid-19, following mass screening exercise 453 workers volunteers.

Those tested positive isolated new team workers man Ideal Convention Centre Wednesday centre sanitised, officials said.

The government defensive caseloads continued climb six months state emergency imposed mid-January stated aim taming disease.

‚ÄúIf think ship still sailing, think sunk,‚Äù said another frontliner. true. true. Well, look bright side. least Bulgaria pathetic 16% vaccinated adults.

I absolutely idea wtf they're doing, whatever they're wrong. may ask, long sick covid hospitalized? know people died cancer don‚Äôt see protesting cure general, seems like everything involving children glossed pandemic. really weird focus seems be, ""who cares kids, get adults work?"" course lol I'm surprised already required simply liability reasons. 

If person goes hospital something, contracts COVID dies, word gets one nurses caring transmitted vaccinated... That's potential lawsuit.

The almighty dollar revered far anything else country. I'm surprised hospitals taking steps make sure exposure kind liability. guess don‚Äôt know anyone died covid. Well do. lots people lost family members. Thank you. answer knowledge speculation seeking. especially since they're likely around immunocompromised may effective immune responses vaccine still vulnerable delta, sure. delta symptomatic rate still high AZ, data onwards transmission yet there. Certainly zero though.

There's three studies showing Delta dangerous previous variants.

Pathetic.  three cannabis stores street totally take granted. Crazy it‚Äôs legal everywhere!  Car accidents aren‚Äôt contagious. Looks NC direction‚Ä¶nope üòû Vaccinated people still catch spread covid, especially delta variant. vaccine protects death hospitalization *reduces* likelihood symptoms spread, still outbreaks fully-vaccinated groups.

In Las Vegas, group fully vaccinated health care workers caught covid party attended hours. didn‚Äôt spread patients, though, wore PPE work. think 98% anymore, delta variant. says that:

More 78% 65 older fully little 1/5th not.

Even 1/5th number cases older people would without vaccines, spread case numbers go 5X, get deaths group vaccines lower case rates.

There's also evidence older people likely get breakthrough cases deaths breakthrough cases (I assume immune systems strong), there's that, too.

Moreover, evidence Delta rougher younger people older variants. 

Finally, fall/winter surge, cases skewing younger still ended lots deaths hospitalizations (despite questioning would due age  Nov 22, 2020  fewer people dying COVID-19, even cases surge  demographic shift clear ‚Äî 18-to-29-year-olds lately accounting largest share new cases across age groups.

Maybe places extremely low vax rates end localized shutdowns then. certainly expect see overloaded hospitals area average average vaccination rates. difference many people following along tracks.

But people following along tracks generally much younger healthier last time, expect deaths hospitalizations much lower (per case) last time. Voltaire - ish? Good. everyone already add ones *already* mandatory like polio, hep b, pertussis, etc.  12% 12-17 year-olds Mississippi even one shot COVID vaccine--compared 67% Vermont 62% Massachusetts, think 2-11 EUA going change things much Mississippi, though would helpful parts country. Neither vaccines. people died driving sober driving drunk? Yes. let live life live yours. driving sober works, fine. worry swim waters big sharks!!!

Thank üòâ every wave, cases went unvaccinated people, hospitalizations deaths went up. 

I'm sure cases go up, hospitalizations deaths go amount. question much? Like said thread, person 85+ 600x likely die covid someone 18-29. 18 crowd event less vulnerable. vaccination rates MUCH higher 65+ 30. expect ""unvaccinated cases"" much much skewed towards young people (who less vulnerable) prior surge one expecting unvaccinated people get infected hospitalizations deaths?

Because generally lot younger healthier average infected person last surge. I'm sure some, expect much lower ratio. 25 double pfizer young? variant increases percentage breakthrough cases. dramatically, does.

Lets say 75% effective stopping infection Delta variant. unusual people group vaccinated people exposed get it.

Your group 4 people mentioned. There's probably family members, coworkers, etc 4 come contact with. 4 larger group. 

At 75% effective, would expect 16 people WOULD gotten nobody vaccinated, 4 vaccinated people would get it. keep spreading virus, it'll keep mutating it'll never ends us.

I never felt ‚Äúprisoner‚Äù lockdown like see people say. went daily get fresh air exercise. Shopping fine, etc. 

The health system lot pressure never collapsed. health issues past 6 months always got excellent treatment promptly. Doctors appointment day. MRI three days later etc. 

Financial support cannot work due restrictions good. Far better lot countries.

Sadly dad must one rare outliers. I'm kind confused though covid vaccinated indeed covid six months ago. people 60s US able get first dose mid January earliest, would mean fully immunized end February. Six months ago today takes us early/mid January.  vaccine efficacy measured ratio comparison unvaccinated vaccinated people.

90% efficacy means 10 unvaccinated people would get it, instead 1 vaccinated person would get it. terms infections Delta variant, may like 3 4 1. 

What means rising cases among unvaccinated mean cases vaccinated. Rationally, vaccinated people want fewer unvaccinated people get it. mention outside US, getting vaccine difficult.

I‚Äôm getting second dose later week, absolutely way get earlier, least Canada. countries, people still waiting eligibility first dose; understand issue Mexico.

We know sure. Long Covid necessarily minor. actually idea US we're tracking breakthrough infections unless result hospitalization. look UK, Israel, countries. US tracking this. actually. Since outdoors they're checking vaccination status really wont much issue.

You want talk real super spreader events look indoor bars/clubs great thing family friend group right literally everyone know one uncle one person work vaccinated, believe I‚Äôm trying. How‚Äôs going far? would incredibly stupid ineffective way reach herd immunity probably impossible reach various reasons. feels reasonable. Outdoors science says generally necessary. US place required wear masks public transportation. many unvaccinated people indoors everywhere unmasked get ugly. feel kids can't get vaccinated immunocompromised put risk due CDC playing dangerous games try encourage people take shot. Based fully vaccinated, 60, generally healthy, really much need worry now. vulnerable regularly interact someone vulnerable, live area surging infections, yes, avoid mass gatherings. otherwise, understand always faced risk, known unknown, attempting minimize 0 bad risk management. people wearing them. unfortunate taking long. one side makes absolute sense that's process. literally means process working. side fact ""fully approved"" holding us back advancing vaccination effort. cases mostly unvaccinated people... unvaccinated people infected protection hospitalization? People talk like climate change deniers. folks talking like since '80s people starting believe them, association climate change arguments. making matters worse cause. Congrats, ya played yo'self.  mean want lose taste smell indefinite amount time? possibility, even vaccine.
Im seeing quite vaccinated people threads hospitalized. hospitalized minor cold. Wow say exactly mandatory, Merkel explicitly said open idea covid tests cost tested person. exactly France right now. want get vaccinated pay covid test, turn necessary pretty much anything. So, vaccination fact indirectly mandatory one prolonged hard lockdown

How *you* define this? people mean ""literally everyone stays home *x* amount time can't leave all."" problem still need people keep lights on, keep water flowing, keep making deliveries, handling emergency services, etc. also need people support *those* people. That's insignificant number people, still contribute community spread. know enough long covid yet. patients get relief vaccination, not. long relief last? kids old enough vaccinated? There's much still unknown virus, exactly risking really vaccine passport people issue with; introduced. least Germany, government started rolling ""passport"" system April, *long* average Joe allowed vaccinated (""passport"" quotes; mostly people vaccinated get exempted certain things, like needing negative COVID test counting person private gatherings). everyone starting get vaccinated, everyone totally cool passport system. fact, people think great idea. China. practice literal slave labor there, even working conditions always ideal safe US.

Most families China earn enough pay schools children qualify far know, public schools can't afford prestigious ones. schooling system ridiculously emphasized importance, guarantee better jobs better well, even public colleges. Whereas west increasingly, matter good degree unless go Ivy League college, even guarantees. travel decent amount PA/NJ/NY/DC/MA regions places go see masks anymore strange county different surrounding areas. waste. important leadership score political points keep residents safe. disgusting Oh believe I‚Äôve shots since day one wish government much mandate vaccines. It‚Äôs necessarily existence masks pisses makes sad, it‚Äôs idea despite PART (staying home limited gathering year shot, always wear mask, get vaccine), still indefinitely take precautions, pisses and, opinion, gives legitimacy ‚Äúwho cares never end‚Äù argument laughed even month ago. Texas noticed especially places like rural areas, 35% Texas vaccinated, go Walmart suddenly 100% everyone vaccinated (even 5-year olds) Except even funny. 

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, wait, right then, could totally skit SNL. ;) r/ChildFree leaking know yet. There's much still unknown virus, exactly risking antibodies likely gone within year. That's Pfizer want give booster people six seven months.

I would like ask follow-up question this, so, mean like third shot (and fourth say, done) mean closer like booster every year type-thing?

Because see next 2-3 years world governments solve globally need booster year?  there's high potential could essentially US people would 1. worn masks 2. gotten vaccinated soon possible.

the longer people refrain things, longer talk anymore. middle high schools. Many parents won‚Äôt vaccinate older children. situation could worse secondary level. UT. Makes sad. Username checks out. Agreed France using European standard like rest UE. Iirc it‚Äôs signed using digital certificate. is. endanger others vaccinated use resources sourced solidary. caught too. big deal either. hearing cases like - starting make think vaccines work perhaps something else - question what...  Unfortunately may never happen I‚Äôm taking get. bullet hits chest right, impact could stop heart kill you. there's low chance happening versus 99% chance die bullet straight heart. Findings like really make wonder I'll ever feel comfortable vaccinated person live concerts love much. Considering often tens thousands people attending, also singing, screaming, cheering, etc. packed tight space (especially standing pit front stage rather using assigned seating plan). I'm hopeful large concerts starting happen again, hard feel excited returning them. think something higher dose compared Pfizer could wrong. can't someone stand make statement still catch spread virus even vaccinated? Majority people thought vaccination prevents getting infected.  Second doses ""done"" end month. second dose booked late August. got first dose early June healthy 31 year old quarantining isolating home May June dad died COVID late April wanted little part problem possibly could, time, leaving many vaccines possible need me. figured early June good go get first dose, anyone needed ample time supply get done. purposely delayed second dose (well, originally set late September, allowed 8 weeks) little bit later, mid - late August, think give best immune response going fall winter, COVID worst (hopefully bad year, many fully vaccinated people, still, whatever uptick see, I'd like know maximum protection uptick, summer, virtually COVID worried anyways. I'm thinking taxes whatever fees/costs pay State Owned Enterprises. Like say rent apartment, government land, made government steel, government cement. 

They're something money sure. they're also putting pocket make owners reap profit. 

We public transport here...  Interestingly, linked article quotes researcher says they'll publishing paper showing ""much reduced"" risk long covid among people double vaccinated. kind wish she'd said ""virtually eliminated"" something, since ""much reduced"" might mean, like, 50% decrease. least something. 

I'd interested see vaccine decreases severity duration long covid. I've lingering side effects serious respiratory infection basically life-long neurological damage Lyme disease - respiratory side effects resolved weeks, okay, Lyme side-effects minor, that's also okay. ""Short"" long covid ""incredibly minor long covid"" would big improvement we've got now. Careful now, sub loves remove people use Korl Morx words mask wearing staff probably helped reduce spread mask wearing children another matter. pick choose stats studies want. Oster's study huge sample sizes peer reviewed published. 

you can't deny evidence inconclusive. Lol literally anecdotal opinion versus mine, that's case province live know dye tablets give kids chew see plaque brush properly?

i wish something like adults see many germs breathe in. believe twisted version personal responsibility neglects fact *we live society* Sounds like found right soap. Well done. breakthrough infections happening frequently ultra-orthodox communities incidence breakthrough infections pretty uniform across groups Israel? agree you‚Äôre saying, completely disagree lumping *all* unvaccinated group take them. Often overlooked children younger 12 years old cannot receive vaccine. responsibility ensure infant child get COVID, vaccinated, masking up, limiting exposure. refuse vector virus. conspiracy shit heads still think wearing mask kills you. Mask mandates work USA certain segment population barely trainable leave decision parents, good bad.

 

Well, depends view children. children strictly property parents children citizens right, deserving protections rights individually?

 

Can parent refuse medical treatment result child‚Äôs death permanent disability? sexually mature child make reproductive choices? general, children authority parents, rights come play dealing medical issues responsibility long adulthood (like baby maintaining basic functionality body). blanket policy parental authority caveats considerations reduces children nothing objects. Maybe province are, am. still going take several weeks hospitalizations tick up, one degree another, cases found, without vaccines. Likely 90% hospitalizations unvaccinated people get it, 99.5% deaths weeks unvaccinated people.

What changes total number cases, hospitalizations, deaths (all lower) vaccines majority arms. time takes COVID progress ""I feel sick think may COVID I'm getting test"" ""I feel really sick think need hospital now"" ""I'm dead"" still weeks apart, 0% vaccinated 90% vaccinated, difference many people following along tracks.

This easy anyone understand really.. I‚Äôve lived Wyoming 2 years work. I‚Äôm finally moving early August- right Wyoming hosts biggest rodeo state comparable last years Mardi Gras super spreading event. 

Can‚Äôt wait get here. Wyoming 30% vaccinated state, yet covid cases 10x worse point last year. 

God help west. mean point vaccines fewer side effects birth control pills put two head head. I'd extremely surprised given full approval.   Honestly showing stomachs. know comment downvoted, nothing factual information. I'm playing rabbit hole game. Prove say, don't. Citation needed I'm sorry wife going thru this. best both.

Oxygen levels 95% going cause brain fog. likely due covid's neuro-invasive nature - meaning virus invade brain nearby nerves. example, loss smell indicates neuro invasion nerves responsible smell direct connection brain. broke ass, ghetto vaccine nobody trusts one take. Nice! Yeah definitely think masks helped dad. got boss work, working close quarters hours, sure boss mask on. stepmom live together tho obvi share bed stuff get worse him, still bad. 

Then stepsister lived whole time never got it! stayed room wore masks around part even so, house! weird. 

But yeah really unfortunate Delta. Def makes bit nervous, even fully vaccinated hate ppl logic. way humans vaccinations, virus infecting many people possible, population building immunity it. yeah, people idea vaccine like invisible shield stops particles entering system. exposed vaccinated still get virus, body responds depends much immune response vaccine. good, able stop virus tracks. good, body may bet sick response fighting virus multiplies. fortunately head start vaccine likely suffer short lighter illness body fights much efficiently never vaccine response ready go. got vaxxxes COVID vaccinated sub, someone issues mRNA vaccines advised get J&amp;J second dose. Maybe check doctor? What‚Äôs another route? going define wealthy then. millions families paying child care would call wealthy. also programs families qualifying incomes receive good amount assistance.

Hopefully everyone wants vaccine get one. Still waiting pre-teen get vaccinated.   Except Bangkok Post. virus won‚Äôt spread freely schools children staff symptoms required stay home. Asymptomatic spread uncommon.  That's fucking bullshit True. believe Quebec sequencing cases starting week, maybe 2 week offset start getting updates? hope 10% deficit 2nd doses going screw us short term. Vaccinated people develop severe symptoms therefore develop long covid. people chosen refuse vaccine, that's them. Please get facts straight trying claim superiority someone else. Depends where. son's school did, along classroom filters.

But they're also continuing require masks next school year. vaccinated u get COVID u still pass on? Pfizer seeking priority review, take 6 months  really suspect Covishield inefficient rather EMA high hygiene standards make vaccination even safer?

I suspect latter make sense ban people already survived vaccination protection people vaccine produced AstraZeneca.

It approved, ""formula"" AZ, seems hard believe would somehow protect less AZ. got infected back May, live 4 family members small flat, 3 fully vaccinated AZ vaccine (called Covishield India). Everyone got tested day 5 6, results came negative. Nobody got symptoms throughout 21 days quarantine.  Yay! Longterm disability risk hoax! Like virus itself!

Said mathematically literate person ever. Says who?  Yes said this????? realize young person, especially age range, still plays big role transmitting others, right? variants making worse. trying job got fired it, simple that. Covid-19 virus


Well, technically truth, lol :P Great, sounds like everything working.   Yeah Quebec really sequencing much Delta numbers regarding misleading; they're likely much higher. Still, encouraging know spite Delta probably around circulating, trends right direction. Yup, parents never get vaccine. KNOW.

The doses distributed PROVINCE. PROVINCE responsible keeping track many doses get. ONTARIO didn‚Äôt handed Pfizer everyone wanted don‚Äôt enough Pfizer second doses. much despise China, sinovac unfairly targeted western press way much recently  ""Ever dance devil wearing mask?"" Like 60% people live still wear masks indoors, despite longer required. Positive PCR rapid. Went second rapid get 10 day clear, sure why, hope escaping 3 kids maybe lol. PCR positive also. day think efficacy skewed reopen. Yeah, it‚Äôs good one dying still sick, wife sick. don‚Äôt empirical data handful people know got vaccinated experienced type fog exhaustion did. didn‚Äôt cough much though, say that, maybe 5-6 times day. would rather die ""free"" live life tyrannical thumb Deep State agenda protect us disease. whole thing gotten surreal even know joke anymore. actually know people like this, too. much.

We rejected them.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  long time see! glad back! Everyone risk. vaccine reduces greatly chances hospitalization death. still get sick. still transmit. still suffer long-haul COVID. still suffer permanent organ nerve damage. 

In simple terms: stupid, get vaccinated; stupid, wear mask. Maintaining high production quality least important. anyone could manufacture vaccine, ensure tainted incorrectly produced? far nuance discussion either aware want admit. old tricks. used make numbers time push Party's narrative. Exactly. bets one minute votes counted September. Yes, even non severe case nothing sneezed at.   stupid response. care IP protecting billions people, millions deaths far, waiving patent would ''stifle innovation''. seriously defending this?  
Actually, really want respond much, pretty fucking dense want get high horse Canada donated 18 million doses instead BARE MINIMUM help get us fucking mess. one needs reminder way things are. pretty apparent needs change. Fully vaccinated people still catch COVID develop mild symptoms. don‚Äôt want that. personally probably wear masks forever crowded places like public transportation reason: don‚Äôt want get sick. Canada patent can't Good shout. search low-histamine diet? histamine levels quite high usually especially time year may beneficial. aid before. Offer incentive. Euro people are/will get vaccinated. would definitely increase vaccinated.

Thanks making laugh thread sadness. assumption someone vaccinated quarantine selves get sore throat. happen instead pass go everywhere infect people. That's design though. intentionally taken US strategy creating two-tier society focus individual rights instead collective good.

I‚Äôm 30, overweight obese, asthma went thru sepsis last year. Herd stupidity  year half painfully obvious people alter lives little safety everyone since start continue necessary, start time soon reason.  


It's sick depressing *how many* sociopaths there, least see clearly now. Silver linings that. understand trying say, certain point accept maybe actions potentially negative impact others' lives, however unlikely may be, whether intended not. could technically potentially save someone's life, statistically speaking, never driving car again. think vaccinated, taken reasonable step towards mitigating risk harm others, think society expects go way reduce risk. think altering lifestyle way probably unnecessary. stopped lying number deaths - really much choice, looked rather absurd excess deaths showing 5x official toll. hope end line long covid sufferers. world's sake well, really hope scientists modern world could find stuffs alleviate even erase long covid managing symptoms.

Thank answer! really appreciate it. 30, overweight obese, female, asthma sepsis last year. wouldn‚Äôt reach herd immunity flu without vaccines - lot stuff Possibly worst ever usage word ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù history English language. feel like kind thing tested positive want cancel travel (because inconsiderate others) wife working office covid deniers entire time. need protect yourself. 

She wears n95 quality mask, sits next true HEPA air purifier (Filtrete purchased shelf Lowe‚Äôs, fake knock Amazon), stays several feet away others possible.

She also uses really excellent hand sanitizer (people wipe nose open door time‚Äîwatch them). Purell Prime Defense 85% alcohol. costs more, see need skimp protecting grubby nasty fingers copier work. 

And yes, fully vaccinated. want get kind covid, mild whatever low bar whatever organization trying set. excellent point. read article thought, ""classic."" Became really sick days staying Las Vegas strip, one wore masks. It‚Äôs already happening. Public school funds obliterated, poor left behind. inequality going get deeper. Home schooling private schooling roaring; almost private schools backlogged massive wait lists. know, grandchildren taken California‚Äôs failing public school system. private school system far superior; private school kids throughout COVID, masks, roundly succeeding. going pass poor kids held back politicized teachers unions public schools. ever learned  feelings hurt? Lol. I‚Äôm double vaccinated. I‚Äôm trying say everyone keeps saying aren‚Äôt people getting shot, project kinds attitudes. Guess what, attitudes won‚Äôt get people take shot. go right ahead keep asking people don‚Äôt get shot. don‚Äôt care either way. CDC tracking breakthrough infections unless result hospitalization lied masks airborne transmission. There's ""data"" follow except comes another country. I'd pay attention health authorities countries successfully responded pandemic want ""trust science data."" Countries like Israel, tracking breakthrough infections, saying need indoor masking vaccination rates far higher US. live vegas, one wears masks anymore honestly thought vaccine meant would ok :/ gas appliances house? Pfizer believes **will** need booster. issue get CDC/FDA page announced applying authorization it. administration manage bunch people walks life, means play stupid mother fornicating games people react differently things like ""needing booster"". may discourage getting vaccine begin with. clearly works feck need boost constantly.

Scott G. believes boosting available point fall/winter least vulnerable segment population. (Pfizer) also analyzing data Israel presenting FDA/CDC regarding need boost X number months. process. AZ flubbed trials US. gave J&amp;J opportunity vaccine, similar enough AZ there‚Äôs real push AZ US anymore. 87% astonishing. I'm impressed.  thickest mucus could ever imagine draining like syrup waterfall almost week. NOTHING could stop it. long choking started gathering chest. Fever whole time couldn‚Äôt eat drink couldn‚Äôt swallow due throat completely blocked off. I‚Äôm hospital day 2 able swallow fluids, haven‚Äôt able eat yet. Several times couldn‚Äôt breathe thought, it. Luckily avoided intubating oxygen mask entire first day. reasoning grade school surface level.

There's covid right now. Emphasize need plan future, now. thought USA even recognizing Astra Zeneca, EU supposedly villain recognizing AZ one plant bother ask certification? plant months months it, never bothered.

Yeah.

I often political economical motivation lot new pieces.

Also travelling Europe summer fundamental human right rich enough. AZ considered second tier class here. Japanese would rather go unvaxxed alternative it. Good thing kids take home viruses spread general community...

People dying numbers, plenty students get really, really sick COVID. multiple weeks last year, online. Like, sick log computers. That's antibody levels, cell immunity strong long-lasting, kick immediately. 

We always knew there'd breakthrough cases, none vaccines ever touted 100% effective. School mask mandates lifted Texas. already banned. imagine masks redirecting air past ears people sides. u feel travel? state international revelers LV r probably blame worker fed wearing mask job. approved, government still feels would hard sell public. believe masks useful kids age? Delta‚Äôs ready Exactly thinking happen too. Could be. COVID hospitalization rates &lt;30s near influenza writ large nobody ever seemed care flu whatever reason. People 30 really think getting really sick makes harder manage. Trust we‚Äôre fond sharing scared everything people either saying it? I‚Äôve seen he‚Äôs claiming it‚Äôs possible isn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm literally perplexed he‚Äôs choosing argument, what? It‚Äôs bad idea around reason pushing it, vaccines way reach herd immunity never point making first place! article talks masking policies across Europe Norway‚Äôs health department policy masks Danish policy kids masks. Thank idea vaccination tied masks all. Vaccinations work. Masks work. Vaccinations + masks = another level protection either provide own. 

The goal vaccination die hospitalized severe covid. ditch mask. 

Wearing mask NBD. truly get it. Thank üôèüèª wish state would. bet opposite it‚Äôs trash. reason can't mandate vaccine gets FDA approval? depends are. area, there's high vaccination rate case rates tiny. safe act like normal. certainly possible like like many areas. 

In areas, like that. wishing like bend reality wishes. asthmatic, sepsis last year, overweight obese.  got Pfizer vaccine normal risk factors asthma overweight (not obese). also battled sepsis last year twice. Yes, that's commenter responded also saying. Well, efficacy measure context suppressive measure massaged overemphasizing high protection ""hospitalization death"" way justify abandoning precautions. get wrong, that's absolutely great outcome vaccines, certainly mean letting tear populations unchecked.  feel getting tested point would knowledge purposes. want get it.

I assume vaccinated? Yeah Science hard, huh? fundamental misconception immune system functions. way ""more trained"" immune system. exposed one virus, like Measles Polio, says nothing someone's immune response different virus. days ago thing happened (3 deaths, 3 reversals) media went bonkers yelling YAY DEATHS mountaintop. Imagine family three people day Pfizer, last dose feb. Playing devils advocate here, know sick without vaccine? Saying things like ""vaccine saved lives"" without possible way verify bit there.  specific, discussion young children. easily google see masks recommended 10-12 Europe (Spain 6 - bit outlier). Scandinavia context I‚Äôm familiar with, kids never wore masks schools, 12 required public spaces. yeah think it‚Äôs fair see Europe large made made different policy choices re: masks children, thus concluded differently. overweight, yes - obese. asthmatic sepsis past. Archive link: journalists keep writing stories? corporation half accounting department this. Everyone KNOWS this. Maybe write story fix problem. Notably, index cases recently immunized Covaxin (an inactivated-virus vaccine made India), receiving second dose 10 days travelling Houston attend wedding.  US CDC terminology, 'fully vaccinated' (which starts 2 weeks final dose); mention paper timing first doses timing vaccination four cases.

The index cases asymptomatic wedding developed symptoms tested positive days later. vaccines mandatory years. People want science; people want politics. MA. outdoor mandate enforced. push ""Vaccinated people still need wear masks"" time also push ""Don't get vaccinated. still wear mask, pointless.""

You end discouraging people getting vaccine order stop wearing masks so. ask yourself, would rather people vaccinated wearing masks? can't both. think effectively means ""indefinitely"". really see things getting better near term, US. Might another year two. Possibly lot longer. vaccine's mandatory. 

For example: WA state currently requires public school students submit proof immunity immunization records chickenpox, polio, hepatitis B, combined tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis vaccine (Tdap), combined measles, mumps rubella shot (MMR) Yes, don‚Äôt get sense cares long covid either. 

It always beginning: use head comes protecting family. fed objectives don‚Äôt necessarily square covid impact particular life (like lying masks preserve supply medical workers. people could see happening early NY started wearing masks matter fed social media said‚Äîthey right). sample size tiny helpful. 

Look 1 dose Pfizer hospitalization (Table 1): 95% confidence level range 46% - 99%. 

In words, 95% confident efficacy somewhere range bad enough even get approval... most-successful vaccine history world.  Yeah, U.S. 7-day death average fraction car accident death average. I'm waiting uproar speed limits lane changing. really CDC far understand. entire thing predicated best effort reporting physicians, etc. US simply good way track sort things. good data means ability collect good statistics. single identifier (like SSN) used track medical data, collection data points like: first name, last name, address, phone number, etc. vaccinations states database (I know states mandatory databases now, do, fairly recent). info doctor's computer file room.

It's easier countries single database logs everything.

Someone correct I'm wrong. Good; better carefully, slowly intelligently otherwise. think care either way. relying source takes time, run risk going end following outdated recommendations. I'm saying.

Those early studies indicated outdoor transmission surface transmission rare wrong, I'm glad changed behavior response long CDC changed recommendations. don‚Äôt believe me. I‚Äôm warning others fully vaccinated live vegas shield getting sick still wear masks don‚Äôt end UMC me.  TIL there's Lambda. Damn ever end.  


Doesn't sound like variants hitting vaxxed relatively hard though; risk levels killers (driving, obesity, etc). unless god. Hungary will.

They pretty much pushed Sinopharm Pfizer, Moderna AstraZeneca here. Must suck Big Brother Putin, all, citizens' lives health secondary. I'll speculate here. think pay education everyone want working class. higher education reserved practice literal slave labor there, even working conditions always ideal safe US.

That's funny called that. coerced labor sometimes. 

They kind earn enough pay it. Basically Asian parents pay kids education tutoring afford view children's retirement investments. children take care parents culture.

But there's plenty can't afford west increasingly, matter good degree unless go Ivy League college, even guarantees.

I would strongly disagree this. Hell know rich Asian going non ivy league west coast school he's going rich like father. He's going school schools better quality easier get ones country.

Again America get loans non merit bases grants help pay school. There's non merit based grants China. kids 12, month ago 12-15 started getting second doses. kids all, like 3 months ago. feelings hurt going use justify callousness? lol. Kids 12 cannot get vax. Stop weak gaslighting admit stance flaws. Even worse. literally telling medical professionals legally jobs. Case 90% peak, course deaths going decreasing. fully acknowledged.

But wise man said, new shit come light man. even wiser man said, foolish consistency hobgoblin little minds.

Deaths rising, predictions already debunked. time evaluate new evidence update predictions preview coming rest country schools places reopen without mitigation strategies.

This going sound horrible, hit vaccination 'ceiling'... higher transmission (whether characteristic variants human behavior) probably get us herd immunity faster. going cost lot lives (mostly people willfully refuse vaccine). wish rest us foot bill coming (almost entirely avoidable) healthcare costs. wear protect others, then. I‚Äôm vaccinated get COVID, likely won‚Äôt know I‚Äôm young probably asymptomatic. means could going around unknowingly spreading COVID unvaccinated kids immunocompromised people can‚Äôt make antibodies. Wearing mask public indoor spaces least protect them.  Yeah know paying attention last decade we're getting people back thinking earth flat. Oh yea? go get pfizer then.

When get enough entire population? 2048?

As called 40 days, pfizer well. worried exact thing think. Mandate emergency use vaccine? Lawsuit anti-vax nurses. I‚Äôm sure bacon vegetable, long we‚Äôre wildly speculating saying random shit. Religion always people use comes that.  Without tracking review preprint...hate news articles link (note reviews original research, summaries reviewing often including opinion original research), I'm confused statement: ‚ÄúThe failure detect potential natural host stimulated suggestions Covid-19 pandemic resulted escape engineered virus lab Wuhan, China.""

Aren't mustelids (weasels, minks, etc) readily infected? Felines well seem transmit easily maybe low viral load (poor receptor recognition). mink farms major outbreaks clear animal animal spread. Seems like could plenty natural originating animal hosts. 

I'm PhD scientist biological sciences previously research laboratory evolution work generally microbial genetics (mostly applied research genetically engineering them, 14 years) BLASTed every coding sequence viral genome early weird preprint came claiming small bits HIV amino acid sequences (this extremely spurious article failed peer review many reasons) nothing there. closely matched, every gene, particular natural bat coronavirus, also clearly evolutionarily distant anything deposited genes scrambled impossible engineered least public database. Simply would sophisticated human done it. looked completely natural me. people genetically engineer things, lop chunks one sequence substitute others well characterized pieces something else. none SARS-CoV-2, period. Humans can't edit thousands upon thousands individual bases anything intelligent like that. definitely 100% natural. difficult explain laymen clue genetic engineering done. That's fantastic. Keep right thing. :)   Yes want kill everyone around me. dare freedom kill infringed. 3 4 people knew came P1 variant May died. 

What‚Äôs point you‚Äôre trying make? here. Highland Park well vaccinated, New Brunswick. I'm sure Atlantic City though. Holy *shit*.   delta variant much less deadly previous variants. deaths continue decline everywhere.

Talk shifting goalpost. Found Alabama lol agree i'm saying compulsory vaccination policy going work countries. going get sick end health problems going end lot excluded society. Controlling viral spread everyone's interest. enter anything. better require testing entering bar something least see people positive. ""This content available subscribers."" Governments around world clamped harder non vaccinated people. Instead everyone rushed open &amp; we‚Äôre going see Delta surges every corner world people aren‚Äôt vaccinated. It‚Äôs mess proportionately. people 40, including children, died car crashes COVID. large majority COVID deaths pretty much every country people 65 and, even then, 70 died younger segments demographic. average life expectancy general like, what, 70 something anyway? Sad, yes. would've hated mom. But, honestly, really risk assessment window young middle aged people. covishield one made largest vaccine producer world. anything it‚Äôs probably superior product EU / UK made version guys‚Äô business vaccine production. Individual EU countries ( last looked ten including Germany) already accepting Covishield vaccines. Kenneth Mak also said ""breakthrough infections problem Sinovac"" insinuated mRNA vaccines free it. days later, one outbreak clusters SG 32% breakthrough rate fully vaccinated people (Pfizer &amp; Moderna).

Couldn‚Äôt really afford time away work single parent, can‚Äôt afford commission kids either. I've one people pushing back lot fear mongering I'm concert anyone myself.

And young kids, still careful. pushing back people kids afraid trust vaccine **to degree advised CDC**. CDC says need wear mask? run around spreading fear taking masks lead catastrophe.

I gonna protect kids regardless people do. appreciate family used justification undermining science tells us vaccine efficacy. Trains subways pretty well ventilated depending are. Remember doors open frequently. Fine, choose last-in-time regulation.

Several EU countries already removed restriction . Exactly. Work home can. Less flight travel. Less buying things don‚Äôt need. 
Many people time families friends work home. think lot people reconsidering lives, wanting slow down, time things matter. 
It‚Äôs real shame people big corporations eager get back ‚Äúnormal‚Äù (yea like it‚Äôs normal commute hours day, needlessly polluting environment, work time hardly time see family)  course going get approved. half country took one three vaccines. FDA turn around say ""on second thought, maybe safe all"" would destroy credibility FDA left, would also drive anti-vax movement new heights. Yeah concur points. neither super alarming me. Unless think infected would pass real test. fist law smash. Pfizer, Moderna J&amp;J Covid- 19 vaccines already used millions millions people worldwide. Biden administration, fear Americans convinced coronavirus vaccines provide short-lived immunity requiring booster, less likely accept shot. 

This CDC continuing destroy credibility - basing messaging idea get vaccinated personally forget COVID think convince people get vaccinated even though actual rates vaccination make clear that's case. get wrong, think Pfizer purest intentions anything, straight trust CDC would like see release actual data Pfizer giving boosters. Yeah, doubt \*NEED\* shot, maybe look data decide want one. Yeah, explain co-worker worried showed they've grown fetal cells 70s 80s. Christian friend, even went route of, ""Yes, wish abortions happened all, think uncountable number lives saved measles, TDAP, Diptheria, etc vaccines? terrible potential lives never happened, could ask greater sacrifice aborted fetuses?""

It kinda worked bit went back deep end like week later. speak perspective country I‚Äôm living in. last year. It‚Äôs never going over. Even COVID pandemic wanes, always vulnerable sickness, it‚Äôs always good keep precautions.

Take easy remember that, matter what, great job. 100% true fewer people die portion country vaccinated nobody vaccinated. true undeniable. vaccines wonderful. 

But increased cases means increased deaths. majority protection death vaccines protection cases. surge cases happening despite vaccination, many people unvaccinated. parts country little third people fully vaccinated. 

In order say cases go up, mostly unvaccinated people, deaths won't, explain Delta variant kill unvaccinated people. Two days. escalated fast. Started fever 103 sweats, next thing know I'm completely weak trouble breathing. Don‚Äôt patients rights? fellow workers? Isn‚Äôt week old news? Several individual European countries said recognise Indian made vaccine. Also, it‚Äôs exactly one made EU / UK. share earth shattering statistics kids getting materially impacted this...or kind anti capitalism rant? That's actually number hospitalized fatal breakthrough cases reported, total number breakthrough cases (which would much higher).

I went 13 14 months without seeing single person supermarket laundromat without mask. one person. time, even fairly rare see anyone without mask walking outside (not counting people bicycles). 

Downtown ghost town coyotes mountain lions started wandering around financial district. 

Things changed recently, like last month two. dang, things shut near-universal compliance. get one others? % success higher went like 500ish back 10.000 2 weeks... fairly insane. NoooooOOOOOOoooooo \s asking evidence damage asymptomatic cases.. Mild/moderate much different asymptomatic. None sources addressed asymptomatic infections non-hosptialized people. 

The Korean study came closest, without able actually access it, can't tell people hospitalized first place. find important a) ground glass opacity occurs types disease b) illness treatment illness might mask covid infection. non pay walled link paper would great. 

Maybe data exist (yet), wondering could back specific claims damage asymptomatic infection. Especially otherwise healthier people.

If hear they'll think children pray. Cool Yup, easily imagine say 'well, approve many people already took it'. America track record types choices. 

Spoiler: it‚Äôs bad one Extinction Level Stupidity. local Facebook group shared article someone said doctor say children vaccinated. likely weren't. here's thing. anyone vaccinated winds hospitalized, almost certainly would died vaccine. immune system great, antibodies work keep covid bay. certainly vaccine people contract covid get hospitalized. Anyone hospitalized vaccination would hospitalized without vaccination. idea vaccines prevent serious disease. happens, covid like flu. flu ‚Äúendemic‚Äù disease since comes back every year. Likely happen covid, much population gets vaccinated. also went SF right quarantine... obvious difference. designing memorial pages kids die end school year? Congress proved funding research FDA long long history corruption comes pharmaceuticals, congressional testimony investigations proven well. Wake up. US deaths overall lowering starting rise Delta hotspots. Deaths lag new cases 4-6 weeks. able prove damages successful lawsuit. vaccine cause measurable damage way put vent dying got COVID anti-vax nurse does. idiots living TN refuse believe vaccine works get covid eventually die, leaving behind smarter people state.

I move future.  I'm Chile well, amount people think Sinovac suddenly worthless astounding. though 0 reading comprehension skills somehow boils Sinovac = bad. lmao  *caf√©* choice. way avoid false-positives recovering Covid? 

I tested positive delta variant July 7th symptom free today. unfortunately get surgery within next weeks, need test negative covid within 5 days surgery. know antibodies stay within body longer period time recovery cause false positive test. way help body get rid faster? I'm struggling come right words describe awful is. wow. mRNA followed Astra? Lol. know they're going say. approved fast. vaccine around since last March, trials began. know unusual weird unknown side effects found 16,17 months going found 24,36, on. would bet good money huge chunk people still gotten vaccinated going change mind full approval given green light. already excluded- good idea. Otherwise face lot resistance ager already angry staff right would happy public health administration would think like that, Belgium notorious three major regions working together. Israel published experience Pfizer‚Äôs efficacy Delta. 64% preventing symptoms still 98% successful preventing hospital admission. 36% breakthrough cases, people reporting reduced symptoms vs receive vaccine. also sense duty responsibility well. societies fail. Here's light reading effects asymptomatic mild/moderate cases. seems there's lot we're still discovering effects Covid-19 duration. Asymptomatic equal absence ill effects.

‚ÄúThe researchers found elevations C5b9 pediatric patients severe COVID-19 MIS-C, surprise, also found C5b9 elevated patients minimal asymptomatic disease. 22 patients complete data available, 19 (86%) met criteria TMA [thrombotic microangiopathy]. Additionally, sC5b9 levels elevated patients meet criteria TMA. Although children COVID-19 severe disease, study shows may effects SARS-CoV-2 worthy retrospectively investigated patients confirmed diagnosis COVID-19 show symptoms. Among 139 patients COVID-19 hospitalized Yeungnam University Hopistal Daegu, South Korea, 10 (7.2%) asymptomatic. chest CT radiographic findings analyzed. Results: results, patients (100%) ground-glass opacity (GGO) chest CT. Further, GGO lesions predominantly distributed peripherally posteriorly patients. 9 (90%) patients, GGO lesions combined reticular study (including control group n~5000) may interesting read. Mild-moderate acute stage. 15% reported moderate severe symptoms months post infection.

Comparing seropositive vs seronegative participants, 26% vs 9% reported least 1 moderate severe symptom lasting least 2 months (RR, 2.9 [95% CI, 2.2-3.8]) 15% vs 3% reported least 1 moderate severe symptom lasting least 8 months (RR, 4.4 [95% CI, 2.9-6.7]) (Table). common moderate severe symptoms lasting least 2 months seropositive group anosmia, fatigue, ageusia, fun off-topic bc people who've hospitalized Covid-19 (versus studies they've admitted reasons happened Covid-19), here's neat table literature Thanks. know status change. San francisco one vaccinated cities country (68% fully vaccinated, 75% eligible pop.) cases surging here. went 10 cases per day around 40 curve still going quite steeply. seems like delta variant also transmit vaccinated people.

Note vaccines still effective preventig severe disease hospitalization. terms case numbers, feel like could rise everywhere US. bots bad. Removing posts something affected pandemic maybe *more* health information insane counterproductive. r/SelfAwarewolves Good. Maybe focus bad instead speculation. got fired becauae lawmakers didnt nesesarrily want people know. Silent law. People would mad children vaccined without concent age 18. Covid not. know would be.....and would lawsuit pretty fast. think people vaccinated would've largely continued follow guidelines CDC told keep masks on. people vaccinated ones trusting science.

So, may ask, ""Why trust CDC now??"" 

With Delta variant particular, can't know extent vaccinated people spreading virus CDC simply tracking data outside deaths hospitalizations. sight, mind. jumped gun removing mask mandate vaccines proven strong UK variant, Delta variant whole animal. CDC digging heels decision remove mask mandate, even decision already proving costly. dictator always bad thing.

That‚Äôs enough Reddit today. Nah, CEE countries simply hit ceiling people ready get vaccinated. Bulgaria Romania especially high percentage simply care enough. make Covid vaccines mandatory arrested. gave examples deaths low cases rising beginning waves.

How hell say we've never seen response giving example us seeing it?  terrible idea ruling gets overturned. let perfect enemy good - especially dealing idiocy. less deadly variant

Misinformation left unqualified. know this. Idiocracy. future truly screwed country. Give little longer safe side - there's usually bit paperwork fill first.

Also, make sure coming pharmacy's closing time; sometimes close rest store.  Well that's basically college town full young people rest poor rural, that's much different parts California like SF Bay Area. beef math actuarial science‚Ä¶it confuses people. Yeah, would massive undertaking every lab. guys one ones. 

Nor even really every lab, test kits could come key test could unique, super easy tests much centralized labs

Another really simple way know correct ID pattern like pattern Visa card number, could done centrally people issuing test kit.

I'm saying I'm saying that's one could . Well, meant HPV.

Looks like Cuba thing clinical trials Oh yes, right get vaccinated put elderly higher risk catching covid come us treatment. Vaccines higher bar drugs, drugs given people who're already sick vaccines usually given healthy people. So, drugs still worth despite higher side effects. toddlers always slightly comforted fact Covid seem especially dangerous toddlers, believe even lower mortality rate flu. Delta variant seems different would absolutely matter. study appears talking presymtomatic infected individuals, called ‚Äúasymptomatic carrier transmitter‚Äù, infectious sources SARS-CoV-2, progress rapidly, even resulting acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) high case-fatality rate.

I think many people ended developing pneumonia, symptoms set olin. sources claiming? vaccinated persons. keep deliberately omitting. 

So point it‚Äôs deliberate misinformation. Well, know..... Arkansas.  sandcastle last forever beach, average tideline last hour many feet away it! wonder I'll able properly sue point then. doubt government remove restrictions though... Yeah that‚Äôs good point actually. Didn‚Äôt think like that. Guess we‚Äôll see starts develop, I‚Äôm optimistic scenario could def happen too. Belgium, way automated system crosscheck results every lab. Unfortunately, pretty much made choices.

Giving morons choices decidedly interest public health. grandmother get second dose week first dose somehow magically got pneumonia (according doctor). also almost never leaves house say probable link vaccine. Notice I‚Äôm citing media. problem is: moment know sure, late. willing sacrifice progress made go back Jannuary 2020? fuck already fully approved? year entire generation. reach adulthood die. Thanks playing. sure completed basic level maths course?

About 35,000 die country year car accidents. 600,000 minimum died Covid country last year. Far died Covid car accidents.

And that‚Äôs nearly everybody riding cars since terrible public transit much population best prevent coronavirus infection. I'm worried family. got shots. get it, we'll stay bed goes away. Even less effective vaccines lower risk level something people comfortable with.

But there's difference personal risk collective risk. manage tricky, especially since current messaging around variants may convince people pointless get vaccine (""I'll wait update""). good idea governments making decisions basis another wave. almost certainly will. Pretty much place world managed avoid another wave New Zealand, unless believe China's case numbers. like people working at-risk people get vaccinated they'd stop getting paid vaccine needed get access lot places caf√©s, headline catchy guess.  internet told wanted believe bad that‚Äôs irrelevant core issue people it, huh? take easy. Less 0.7% deaths (all causes) 0-17 year old group involve Covid-19. Considering risk increases age, 18 months baby Covid represents tiny risk worth worrying much. think factors wildly unknowable. I‚Äôm claiming conclusion necessarily incorrect. I‚Äôm saying can‚Äôt know shouldn‚Äôt act like can. real sources experts attempt answer questions laid specifically existing COVID vaccines would interested seeing them. need infrastructure spending ... regardless side line on. creates jobs fixes shit needs fixed. C'mon ""El Goato,"" say something get banned. know know, words hard. believe you!! Looks like dropped paywall article. 100%. understanding (which nothing) small children develop mild symptoms would like know changed delta variant. Whereas even official ID card. Get vaccine.

When call stupid people bullshit simply get stupider hide bullshit. part correct reasoning inconclusive. point vaccinating unvaccinated individual will, average, prevent COVID cases booster shot will. even vaccinated person without booster likely develop resistant strain choose give booster instead vaccinating someone else end people infected, average. means scenario likely create new resistant strains depends much likely vaccinated individual create new variants unvaccinated one many people would infected gave booster instead vaccinating new individual. case US case Italy well, I'd surprised different France.

Please correct wrong, based way originally described here, sounds like population level measurement based people *behaving normally*. Get rid normal behavior--even everyone deviates way--and statistics may longer apply. ratios predictable obvious, correlation cases, hospitalizations deaths are. I.e. UK, lag cases, hospitalizations deaths existed wave, hospitalization spike death spike muted.

I think US experience significantly death, hospitalization nowhere near uptake amongst elderly. UK imbalanced resevoir cases amongst almost entirely unvaccinated young. US plenty areas young mostly unvaccinated, outside New England parts west coast/hawaii, plenty unvaccinated elderly people. Bruhhh fucked Genuine question: endgame then? Yes, lower protection (though seeing studies showing far greater 60% protection), best got right now, know even I'm exposed symptoms transmissibility almost certainly minimized due vaccine. see end sight people still insistent masks/distancing right they're fully vaccinated. There's literally nothing else do, going take risk, take much much greater risk even peak earlier waves go back hell limited gatherings, going places, etc.

Not judging anyone still takes precautions, curious. Complete opposite sub one year ago people falling exclaim covid extinction level event üòÜ everything reopened returned normal United States deaths time low. Netherlands europe general far behind US? Part living society cooperating others greater good. selfish mindset climate change, disease, global challenges utterly failed. mask, put public. fucking big deal, complain-o Please enlighten exactly one would get tetanus given it‚Äôs contagious? Cue million Karens claiming kid ""special need"" Thanks! Though fair borrowed statistics sections [latest update Canada Coronavirus extracted key section, bolded numbers greatest interest, added additional commentary.

Yes, totally right could even better different American leadership. understand every government put citizens first, every vaccine-producing nation besides US willing export least *some* production. imagine EU also refused export vaccines! 

It's good government smart procurement policies paid end. I'm really impressed much citizens embraced cause, like nation-in-arms Covid.  you‚Äôre saying mandate masks, also ensure everyone access supply high quality masks. Great idea, fully support it! I‚Äôm two week point J&amp;J (not completely woods still looking good), gotten side effects whatsoever (apart couple minor ones first day) meant leave home obviously. like infected mask-wearing fully vaccinated hospital workers much less likely transmit virus others working indoor spaces. target ‚Äúmasks comfortable everyone wear one *feel* safe‚Äù bad still sure well asymptomatic people transmit virus.

""World Health Organization official clarified Tuesday scientists determined yet frequently people asymptomatic cases Covid-19 pass disease others, day suggesting spread ‚Äúvery rare.‚Äù Stuff like giving people false sense security. It‚Äôs really early tell, sample size isn‚Äôt large enough yet. Don‚Äôt rush science. Rich countries donating. Faster shots actually given many cases. last two days alone US donated 36 million vaccines separate covax. US pledged 500 million vaccines next year 200 million end year. Covax fault (aka WHO) slow ponderous rollout real plan terms actually getting shots arms. good countries donate vaccines money COVAX sit warehouses. wears masks home? one's face ever seen again. What's end game? everyone's vaccinated? Way go Gavin  There's still obvious predictable correlation cases, hospitalizations deaths, ratios.

Yeah well, ratios ""predictable"" ""obvious"" ask me. maybe care cite research back assertions? Georgia refused give vaccine forced teach 100 students person, Alabama gave vaccine. always grateful Alabama!  I‚Äôm talking places world US sucks them, 1) choice go places, 2) it‚Äôs small crowded place like one room 30+ people, 3) literally none vaccinated 15, likely far less general population. both. breakthrough infections person mount good immune response vaccine (or waned), exposed super-high dose virus (or repeated exposure) extra infectious variant. combination thereof.

You can't tell unless person antibody test exposed. Yeah feds really got stock even commend province rollout despite terribly handled lockdown Tetanus shots every 10 years something that's really practiced North America European countries. NHS UK reccomends typical childhood course tetanus shots. think latter. keep database anti vaxxers opt actually precise count many keep. would actually require competent government date systems.. honestly cannot believe idiots think government could orchestrate entire conspiracy.. remember, immunocompromised elderly among first get vaccine, first wane true. It‚Äôs specific schools teachers choice there. There‚Äôs teacher school 64 two time cancer survivor. He‚Äôs quite retirement age. He‚Äôs high risk immune compromised. gets despite vaccinated could kill him. think it‚Äôs fine forced exposed dozens unmasked, unvaccinated kids week?

That said also think still mandates places like grocery elderly high risk folks may choice at.  Dude. Look post history. spokesman drug lol? Either Russian bot. post link bunch threads different subs. clearly bot vaccine everyone getting Madrid? depend whether cases surge control heavily vaccinated areas. really see happening, honest areas. low vaccinated ones, yes, can.

The insinuation shadowy cabal trying to‚Ä¶hurt J&amp;J stock pretty there. Everyone‚Äôs hive minding  That's got idiots getting info another idiot guarantee idiot also got polio messeal vaccine. hospitalizations? It‚Äôs definitely regulated feds.  get 800k-1.2 million visitors workplace yearly. Nearly half people cannot get vaccinated. They‚Äôre 12. also nearly unmasked.

Between hordes young kids ~50% currently unvaxxed adults state wearing mask probably another half year. authoritarian though lol Why?  Seems like excuse parents take kids public schools. Epidemologists concerned mixture gives virus perfect environment mutate vaccine resistant. say done quantitative PCR mean real time PCR (with florescent dyes), end point PCR quantified band intensities? real-time PCR like used covid tests total number cycles practically meaningless long enough since machine measures amount DNA every cycle.

San Francisco currently 30 cases/day low test positivity rate.  city 800,000, that's really low. Read first post. risk kids extremely small.

The anti-vax crowd mostly made minds based disinformation willful ignorance. they're either going say FDA coerced approving go make another excuse. Thanks,I hope explain better! glad progressing vaccination too,but supply problem now.

When staying GP vaccinated,in less 30 minutes,they got 5 calls asking vaccine despite spot.

Hoping everybody able vaccinated soon! Sorry for""Me brain mess"".  EU's coronavirus response coordinated countries US states. 

There much coordination member states. visible thing synced across EU digital covid certificate (EU DCC). EU DCC recognized everywhere, individual countries still setting rules EU DCC needed enter conditions.

The EU issues recommendations border policies apply, countries put twist them. Even country color coding scheme based infections rates developed European CDC adopted universally.

Vaccine purchases approval also done joint effort, country allotted share based population size. rollout details left countries themselves. Things like prioritization interval doses different different countries.

Almost covid-19 measures, lockdowns, school closures, mask policies, curfews, decided country level, EU role big distinction I'm making separate test system traveling. 

In countries. others, never distinction. people get covid infections asymptomtatic... Different budgets. Improving student environments non existent budget educating student budget. Hiring admin increasing civil servant wage budget thus enables politicians say managed larger scale budgets Idk, I'd prefer force first dose certain people good reason get vaccinated. Using common sense, would realize ever going away. Coronavirus stay. feel person make valid point, draw line? would aid mandates vaccine organizations.

This makes sense me! older people largely vaccinated now. historically made bulk hospitalizations. Kill kids!

Kill kids!

Kill kids! hope people get mild symptoms breakthroughs abandon vaccines future lose faith belief bulletproof vest

I understand many people convinced acknowledge vaccines highly effective magic bullets somehow cause millions people get vaccinated. vaccines great! amazing! mean perfect abandoned anti-COVID measures also allowing half population get vaccinated still participate society put rest us increased risk. think, least, heavily vaccinated areas (i.e. California, majority northeast), lawmakers reinstate vaccine/negative test mandates large gatherings indoor dining, limiting capacity canceling things.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* way see science needs hard data back up. valid scientific concern.

For example, sure know vaccines help. example, many people died due vaccine? available anywhere? VAERS lacking vague. would absolutely bunkers assume happened. 

The UK Covid response site says, dig it, expect ""several thousand."" it. So, rather data less data. 

These vaccines like vitamins. serious drugs. treat such. Yea to. seems always surprises. Almost like programmed algorithm. ü§î could make argument even without minimal protection surgical cloth mask (it may physically block viral particles, without seal like N95 super effective), act wearing indoors increases peer pressure others wear indoors thus decrease chance infection convinces infected person mask otherwise have. means guarantee, course.

And regarding comment eyes, interesting question. seen good data often infections initiated eye vs throat (it would likely require study testing tissues SARS\_nCoV\_2 regularly see shows one first often even reliably together, anyone seen data I'd love know), unless every exposure results infection always infects eyes well nose/throat, N95 mask still decrease risk helping block situations nose/throat would initially infected. Though data knowledge, would hypothesize case significant portion infections start nose/throat without infecting eye initially (aka: preventable N95) matter living constantly suck air regions, whereas eye not. worthwhile wear N95 higher risk situations fully vaccinated? That's personal choice, I'm telling do.  Covid never killing hospitalizing children en masse. resulting mental illness well could kill hospitalize later life. ‚ÄúHaving time make it‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make trauma went go away. kids gonna need lot help don‚Äôt think parents understand that.

what bunch soft whiners become country. Well, one kid attended class portable building AC literal holes walls (you could see sky said holes, joke) smart money ""Haaaaaaaaahaha, NOPE.""

Virtual learning huge higher education. They‚Äôll options.  Thank reply. seems like quite year! wish government officials could refrain making speculative statements increase vaccine hesitancy.  Otherwise known ""don't stupid"" law proof this.

Yes, panic anxiety researching every anecdote may account lot mental challenges people facing. That‚Äôs really don‚Äôt like fear-mongering. thought shit wrong COVID everything came back negative. probably head Internet telling long covid. mean, lot effective kid everyone class maksed indoors

This really 'you you' situation bub Still feels way low canad though, especially Delta variant :(

Levelling 80% eligible population vaccinated. really hoping could get 90%+... No, (presumably) got vaccinated protect dummies. Masking kids bearing vaccinated, don‚Äôt know expect rest. They‚Äôve made willful choice roll dice. Saying still spread kids mask argument perpetuity. said ‚Äúthe flu dangerous kids COVID‚Äù also said ‚Äúits still pretty sad kids go wearing masks‚Äù.

Choose one. Oooh Canada; country legislated must say, say it. country keeps finding mass unmarked graves past.

Yeah...I think quite standard, even good example protecting individual freedoms, looking for.   november. apparently 6 months review.  Unless worker medically un able vaccinated, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs good enough reason one. magical combination poor critical thinking selfishness, little dose brainwash. Thank saying this. 18 month old. live Florida. nightmare. actually got asked ""well decided children pandemic"". No. No. didn't. January pandemic slowly dying inside ever since. Honestly know much longer take living Florida. testify this. entire family including sick back February made mistake looking experiences people. ""If they're alive typing, must well now, right?""

Instead kept reading people lost loved ones seemed getting better, 7-10 day mark, got worse suddenly passed away. cannot express sheer terror experiencing every second existence, continued 2 weeks. thinking second one parents might get sicker. would wake night sneak near room listen breathing sounded normal.

I ended panic attack night reading stuff, obviously made breathing go haywire immediately though ""welp that's it, I'm dead"". started taking sleeping medication knock overnight make sure continue nightly paranoia parties.

I've lost two grandparents COVID, fear doubled tragedy well. yeah, lesson learned: read sick, drive insane. Almost nobody cares. people wear masks *some* places that's that's changed. Everything open: bars, malls, movie theaters - concerts large crowds held regularly. mask temperature checks places, everyone immediately takes after.

So, huge chunk people think COVID big deal even lie hospital fever (I know people firsthand). course regular anti-vaxxers ""oppose chemicals put bodies reason!"" Finally people *do* treat COVID seriously, *do* trust vaccines hurry get one made Russia insuccificient clarity testing lack approval EU WHO. [FDA approval I'd ""astounded"" drug candidate politically savvy pharma fails get FDA approval. 

By comparison aducanumab, vaccines miracle drugs.  government announced yesterday going donating remaining AZ doses poorer countries, hopefully wasted. ... except children -- less likely negative impacts COVID -- almost getting vaccinated choose so. Yes, outliers based health conditions, minute amount people they're part problem. Anti-vaxers are.  endangering besides people dont want vaccinated? saying see shift excuses people getting start November. international caliber PhDs need apply debate. serious, scientific business.  Well right bat doesn‚Äôt (as far know) disease. like driving around date inspection sticker car. know part won‚Äôt break traffic yeet another car? No. thing knowingly driving said broken part? Also no.

Now probably considerably likely average result people hurt, thus stiffer penalty, assumption ‚Äòwe punish people though intended something‚Äô things didnt intend, straight couldn‚Äôt done conception ‚Äòthe punishment matching crime‚Äô works. I've heard delta less deadly

Can link Yeah, I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs difficult understand. won‚Äôt judge masking kid. it! don‚Äôt think get judge everyone else. Man go fun. Enjoy life - get one. went whole life near magical body fights diseases viruses every day. gone concerts past died hope. vaccinated - let fear control you. Worst case scenario get sick days saw damn awesome show. think like impossible predict demand 100% accuracy. Canada donated bunch AZ, like we're letting rot.

I believe donate bunch unused Moderna shortly. haven‚Äôt ‚Äúthe poor left behind‚Äù.

‚ÄúThe private school system far superior‚Äù

This myth  almost like man credentials would involved development basically end pandemic, allowed publicly give information That's exactly many employers do. reason already legal hassle forcing employees take non-FDA approved vaccine. I'm diminishing effectiveness masks - absolutely work - kids wear whenever they're indoors. going mandate anything, mandate cure i.e. vaccine, mandate mitigation. 

And I've asked before, many waves masks prevent? Even places almost perfect masking, COVID still ravaged previous surges. imperfect group level prevent surge. absolutely encourage anyone feels need mask, mask. think group-level masking solution people making - certainly proven preventative level. what? Everyone planet going acquire immunity Covid, either vaccination rolling dice infection (or cases) seems experts believe it‚Äôs endemic. 

Saying ‚Äúkids mask community spread‚Äù nobody else wear puts burden stopping them. It‚Äôs wrong hinging decision open close schools false choice. Get vaccine unlikely die virus. That's it, end.  Fully vaccinated (55) 2 teens also fully vaccinated. One went dinner vaccinated friends last Wednesday one friends tested positive. family sick. Getting tested couple hours, she‚Äôs got mild symptoms. I‚Äôm assuming Delta variant. point trying quarantine within household? Seems pointless she‚Äôs really beating putting mask probably makes feel she‚Äôs protecting me. She‚Äôs angry frustrated right things year. Canada, healthcare workers required get vaccinated various diseases. requirement, probably, already exists countries. 

Are aware this? don‚Äôt need read know it‚Äôs moral failure since lot countries proceeding AZ (without mixing up) still lagging behind.  guess kept doses case someone originally got AZ (before discontinued) wants AZ second. think expire tradeoff maintaining option choosing one vaccine doses. Yes, Sinovac gets job done pretty damn well, unfortunately media likes spit lot bullshit out, like Sputnik, vaccine right great. aren‚Äôt ‚Äúprotect dummies.‚Äù

We **protect children** dummies.

‚ÄúDing dong‚Äù adults aren‚Äôt masks mitigation measures **in schools**. 

I mean, fact half Californians still aren‚Äôt fully vaccinated, millions kids 12 unvaccinated. Actually think we're Lambda now, spread much yet.  whole world locked COVID, need make vaccination mandatory anyone wishing return society. kindergarten level stuff too, willing part solution accommodate you. much sacrifice death worldwide, Antivaxx people need boxed stupidity. Seriously?

Freedom debate flourish laws rules. recommend getting gas detector.  propane natural gas. notify gas leaks. Well, yes, available. got mine 3 weeks peers I'm still getting second one tomorrow.

Although, since guy bright, possible refused his. Good stuff. Make life difficult unvaccinated üëèüèº Bring Mexico, they'll gladly used need hurry school districts make mandatory I've vaccinated months gladly take booster when/ time comes vaccine passports asinine. I'm really interested showing papers basic things. typical thing hava reckless attitude regarding ones health Russia. towards Corona general. Many people fatalists believe fate. know plenty delinquent people outright refusing pride, would get plenty skeptics line. wait. First foremost, acetaminophen dangerously low therapeutic dose harm ratio. 1X dose supposed take, 3-4X therapeutic dose enough kill you. cascade liver processes drug - enough enzymes right creates dangerous intermediary product. 

Acetaminophen many different drugs. Bad cold? take tylenol - maybe pill two supposed feel really bad. decide double load Dayquil. allergies acting take Benadryl. feel better drugs go coworkers drink work (which reduces enzymes available break drug). couple days row sudden start becoming jaundiced because.. acute liver failure. 

We've gotten better warning labels, frighteningly easy overdose acetaminophen. Many, many drugs take *that* much extra cause serious problems, especially happen lower end LD50 curve. issue cause immediate issues: damages liver take multiple days manifest. 

Many people over-consume counter drugs assumption safe better. usually that's pretty true. take 30 sudafeds day (instead 8) may get heart palpitations, kill you. take 30 tylenols (instead 8) day - especially one day row - end hospital acute liver failure. 

While intentional overdoses, 25,000 hospitalizations acetaminophen overdoses year. caught early enough overdose severe, typically save liver treatments. many, time get hospital late: either get liver transplant die within week two. mutation date significantly altered mRNA vaccine efficacy severe infection. Vector vaccines done worse suspect due AZ using perfusion stabilized spike JJ single dose. 

UK new case rate continued rise starting early May death rate modesty going up. Delta mutated enough reduce neutralizing antibody response (and give fitness advantage Alpha) nearly enough cause widespread hospitalization death.  literally pointed paper agree said sibling explicitly **isn't** saying natural immunity better.

Also, end day important giving accurate full information people want take measures limit risk? CDC continually cratered legitimacy entire pandemic allow politics drive messaging instead data. worried acknowledging vaccines 100% effective hurt vaccine uptake answer create messaging addresses concern, lie refuse acknowledge vaccines going prevent every single person ever getting infected. Let's hear understanding fairness then.

Should charged what? dont end ICU doesnt matter, right?! /s probably spent barely money education countries. Ok arguing bad faith. Got it. details? One dose vaccine? long since shot?

If 2-dose vaccine, really protection 1-shot already well known weak delta. Yep, well beyond surgeons. study involves mild cases too, people vaccinated (especially first dose) still risk, even much lesser.

Point us, vaccination (two shots) goals met, there's little reason still wear mask follow social distancing.  Honest question. grew going school Texas. conservative policy? guess assumed girls country wear spaghetti straps show stomach. think south thing.  may 6, believe date applied, would put start november.

France much behind Spain total vaccinations, that's EU countries far supply-constrained therefore progressing pace (since deliveries quite homogenous throughout EU).

But look vaccinations age ranges see Spain eligible age ranges trend towards vaccination (close 100% 60 years) ones vaccinated almost lower age ranges simply chance get vaccinated far. However, France vaccination opened pretty much everybody long time demand dried older age groups. Vaccination progressing younger people important percentage eligible people get vaccine decision.

This means France soon get point demand lags behind supply whereas Spain point likely reached almost everybody fully vaccinated. Oh know that's logical people want. Yeah, true, articles CNN outlets it. side fact ""fully approved"" holding us back advancing vaccination effort.

If say Even conservative provinces 70%+ first dose climbing. It‚Äôs situation US.  What's outlook can't get second shot due medical advice complications first dose? EVERYTHING RISK ASSOCIATED IT! Let‚Äôs fall victim overtly peevish, getting vaccine far outweighs risk DEATH CoVid‚Ä¶.‚Ä¶.  majority cases unvaccinated people non-severe cases. 

I'm sure article telling us much this. giving us comparisons unvaccinated. government fuckup. shipments two vaccines sync. massive influx Moderna June little Pfizer, compounds issue 12-17 age group cannot given Moderna, age group given Pfizer.

There's nothing anyone that. vaccines produced shipped rate. Variability completely normal.

The thing one mismatch vaccines either wait mix vaccines, mixing seems better option. Even grandparents got first doses April waited 3 months. Personally exactly 8 weeks interval, friends got later 1st dose appointments ended waiting less since province moved 4-week interval last week (and walk-in clinics month).

People got spooked NACI recommendation 16 weeks acceptable, genuinely wonder anyone entire country *actually* 4 month dosing interval. Vaccine effective those. 90+% people contracting delta variant unvaccinated. Bout az? able schedule first vaccine appointment, calendar entry read ""deusnefum gets full body vaxxed"" flip 7-day average new doses, Bulgaria Romania vaccinating least twice number US, many passing US (Germany due overtake 4-5 days current rates hold) - EU average would overtake US 26 days.

But somewhat hide fact EU, like US, anti-vax/vaccine hesitancy problem. Now, Romania selling doses can't give Denmark, overall proceeding nicely, situation Western Europe reaches great coverage levels, places East lagging horrible behind (Bulgaria Romania) somewhat lower levels. husband kinda acting like ass last night. going bed chills bad shaking, last time happened back November got COVID, immediately asked symptoms feeling okay. 

He insisted fine wasn‚Äôt contagious. pestering bit more, turns finally decided get vaccinated yesterday morning side effects! kept saying going wait year concerned long term effects/the vaccine rushed, surprised last night figured gotten vaccinated earlier day. I‚Äôm pretty happy it. Ugh, hate you. I‚Äôm way. feels unethical ask come in. Anyway fight more? Hope things shift favor. Stay safe. interval 4 weeks vaccine. Yeah, wtf sure people die believe not.

My daughter also vaccinated CP well it‚Äôs standard - request pay it.  üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòä‚úÖ Ah yes thats virus spreads internationally. one irresponsible. Even wasnt ill, additional, stupid risk take Well cases sloooowly crawling Stockholm, exponential growth hard spot early. Tegnell wrong almost everything hope summer mode outdoors life keeps down, still feels might belong r/whatcouldgowrong weeks. Oh sure, pretty much every newspaper describing sort near-future Canadians would looking friends US gathering going vacations still lockdowns. turned sort true; US's position public health measures ranged lax non-existent. end large gap predicted never really materialized since campaign stalled quickly.  That‚Äôs we‚Äôre right now. suppose can't go live later then? live hope community wake one day realize they‚Äôre idiots get vaccinated asap. kids‚Äô vaccine trials quickly lead younger children getting vaccinated.

Plus it‚Äôs depressing thinking third summer masking. It‚Äôs fine rest year, miserable it‚Äôs hot humid breathing mask like breathing sweaty sock. AC isn‚Äôt great work. seems also means rate infection higher think, since asymptomatic people generally seek tests unless need one medical procedures, travel, whatever. can‚Äôt get vaccinated yet health conditions, that‚Äôs great attitude have. everyone vaccinated anti-vaxxers. aren‚Äôt going like this, play soccer weekends beer league (Dads gotta keep shape ya know) took almost month quarantine get cardio back was. runs would make probably quarter mile neighborhood stop completely winded. didn‚Äôt get back mile like 3 weeks quarantine. month though broke wall felt fine.

IANAL, understanding *trial abstentia* automatically means right *retrial* arrested (But previous trial used ground keep jail/house arrest waiting retrial) I‚Äôm sure answer question, can‚Äôt figure myself.

I‚Äôm UK. Here, understanding everyone age 40, everyone considered vulnerable COVID, fully vaccinated.

If case, matter cases rising UK? Yes make pay price Smart company makes smart decisions. Can't mad they're following laws... Bull. governments SEA choice. already widely reported since last year queue mRNA ones, even AstraZeneca. Heck, AstraZeneca get bad rep, SEA still get early. SEA get vaccines Western countries hogged accusing getting kickbacks choice. fact families vaccinated individuals test positivite symptoms COVID frankly worrying me. Even reduces severe cases, wish better and/or vaccines adapted Delta variant already available vaccinate yet instead ones vanished virus immunocompromised people cant get vaxxed safely? hope access free testing, oof. unless smoke lot weed get paranoid, ingesting weird conspiracies baked asses. starts creeping regular sober life. happened someone hardly talk anymore. quite true. 

No person born 1970 get measles vaccination. Adults younger get vaccinated work hospital, kindergarten, school refugees community home refugees living one. 

They made hard children get vaccinated though want visit kindergarten children go school unvaccinated measles parents pay fines. Germany homeschooling illegal outside rare exceptions children go school. care facts data ""new"" sorting Coronavirus subreddit. things take time, should.  sepsis last year twice, April November. Doctor currently says white blood cell count good symptoms last year. I‚Äôm hoping didn‚Äôt linger make covid worse. That‚Äôs fear sepsis unfortunately, never really getting feeling it‚Äôs fully gone away. actually put seeking treatment covid hospital sepsis PTSD still experiencing.  hope we've infected calms f*ck turns common cold. omega strain. wonder American health care costs much. money spent training surgeons get one surgery suffocating mask üôÑ It‚Äôs big disappointment, doubt. believe career CDC employees quit CDC enabled everyone take masks off. I‚Äôd love know said rooms. 

If it‚Äôs ok get ‚Äúmild‚Äù covid, fuck this? lockdowns, remote learning, work home, etc? vast majority risk ‚Äúmild‚Äù covid! Stockholm weekend (from Switzerland) really feel like measures all. time saw masks terminal airport. feel nice experiencing ""normal"" life though days. Hubby got second shots last Saturday.  


SUCH huge weight mind. &lt;3 CDC consistently slow adapt recommendations new data (ex. glacially slow admit outdoor transmission surface transmission rare, even data indicate many months). suspect also slow amend recommendations might change response new variants. effective pushing hesitant people edge. EU seems trying everything make vaccination mandatory without say loud. Kids 12 ""make choice"". happened last wave state 62% adults fully vaccinated? 
 


In every wave, cases went unvaccinated people, hospitalizations deaths went up. 

In wave, cases ALSO among unvaccinated people. expecting unvaccinated people get infected hospitalizations deaths? kids 12 immunocompromised people cannot get vaccine? enforced practice none executed since 2015 (I think) big study collated studies date. hungover move I‚Äôll dig later remember. know, makes lot sense. april 2020 nyc kinda freaked out! Pfizer gang  similar experience Mexico. test seemed far less intrusive previous one (where incentive negative results).  
Data going get skewed, already.  
That said, threshold positive pretty low started going down, incentive positives (more funding). SOEs private, that‚Äôs whole point. call ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù land, means it‚Äôs privately owned land. It‚Äôs technically people‚Äôs land. Calling ‚Äúgovernment‚Äôs‚Äù mischaracterization leaves fact it‚Äôs ‚Äúowned‚Äù ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù ‚Äúno one‚Äù individually/privately ‚Äúown‚Äù it. So, aren‚Äôt owners SOEs able fly space like here. businesses China SOEs anyways, nothing applies across board. money might go fund space program, knows. good thing, along public transport building. don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre from, US anywhere near mobility countries including China. aren‚Äôt ‚Äúputting pockets‚Äù system capitalism west freely ‚Äúputs‚Äù capital hands private individuals.

And yeah, know trains exist United States. Don‚Äôt coy, they‚Äôre making good investment could learn lot that. Everyone nice things. Yes, live Vegas it‚Äôs spreading really bad. That‚Äôs fine. don‚Äôt make five year olds play together masks. benefit tiny learning loss huge. Example: won‚Äôt even let kids sing school spreads air. result kid young play instrument gets participatory music education. It‚Äôs awful. kinda funny cuz mom antivaxx still discussed rational subjects. told watch israel ahead everyone else (so could see dropped dead). ended youtubing religious guy like 'take vaccine idiot' started following him, fully vaxxed! sorry, share :P additional protection beyond infection (though vaccines' protection hospitalization protection infection). 

But point remains - hospitalizations among vaccinated people certain fraction overall hospitalizations; overall hospitalizations go up, hospitalizations among vaccinated. ratio 20:1, example, every 20 new hospitalizations, 1 vaccinated person.  still rational vaccinated people want cases go up.  yet seem money keep hiring additional administrators 6 figure salaries schools crumble sucks. still get long covid neurological issues grey matter changes brain asymptomatic cases.

Also, asymptomatic person spreading others contributing creation variants prolonging whole situation us. people forgetful and/or stupid.   here. live parents also vaccinated. Since there's one home risk (like young children) already COVID December, I'm living normal life can. variant breaks through, unlikely (though much possible) I'll get infected cases start rising vaccinated people. I'm going wearing mask winter protect face cold, may extend mid-fall mid-spring protect respiratory disease. otherwise plan keep daily routine same. Many experts still think hospitals overflow measures relaxed. really makes head hurt fork cash fakes when, free, could get real thing.  


The stupid. HURTS. Kids much resilient give credit for. need adults set good example explain cautious important, upset it. get it. follow lead. would gladly sacrifice keep others safe, unlike seeing many adults. 

Are challenges? course. also silver linings like anything else Many kids much time parents year working home travel.

There also course kids tough situations, need support them. along, covid not. follow statistics science...your kid fine. assuming doesnt underlying conditions kids Miss likely had. media fails contextualize anything days. much country vaccinated then? Low vaccination zero masking‚Ä¶ everything‚Äôs back ‚Äúold normal‚Äù

Edit: large parties, big events, bars, restaurants packed. lag time cases deaths. 

Deaths beginning summer winter surges, deaths eventually followed.  requiring masks subways buses London, mandatory üëç know much Midwest general, low vaccination something else feel going rough fall? far better solution masks HEPA air purifiers ventilation, lot scientific evidence preventing Covid transmission cloth masks.

Masks leaky. Put bunch kids together poorly ventilated space hours end breathing others‚Äô infectious particles matter what. Fitting N95 masks doesn‚Äôt seem realistic.

Distancing plastic barriers also likely useless particles accumulate air hours circulate throughout room.  asymptomatic Covid actually absence symptoms, however that‚Äôs what‚Äôs observed several papers show ground glass opacities asymptomatic cases (small retrospective study) well pediatric patients asymptomatic elevated inflammation markers - clinical threshold TMA (low platelets, organ damage due formation microscopic blood clots capillaries small arteries).

Granted vaccine probably something positive asymptomatic cases, something lots people may know even don‚Äôt notice symptoms doesn‚Äôt mean bad things aren‚Äôt sensible warning. pray met sensible responses. Vaccines technically different approval process traditional pharmaceutical drugs, instead approved different process along biologics. Well hope allowed travel. help lot people could flip script leave state places align politics. know lot leftist individuals California say ""escaped"" Mississippi. also went private schools leg things previous person mentioned (education, opportunity, poverty). cdc following science shows still catch spread COVID even vaccinated. Fuck incentive bullshit. facts keeping people safe. right theme phony...consistently shuffling Except moderators sub take whole new level! can't mention pol ic al party without getting thee comment removed even directly applies conversation taking place post. secret moderators awful. encompass free speech agree moderators limiting discussion relevant topic hand. PA still holding steady. expect we'll increase amounts - million people also show second shot, 70% full vaccination rate seems like may happen here. many times seen beginning waves, wrong longer-term deaths inevitably follow cases.  again... deaths lag cases large amount  22, 2020**  fewer people dying COVID-19, even cases July 2020**  US coronavirus deaths going covid-19 cases soar? CDC never claimed need wear masks. claimed disease severe enough average warrant legal mandate double vaccinated, thing all. many caveats statement society follow properly whatsoever. People unvaccinated stopped wearing masks virus spreading, raising risk people vaccinated well.

Masks always really useful reducing viral spread. CDC never said need them. save lives pretty strong statement favour wearing them, particularly case surge cases due variant. question legal mandate. somehow, NYTimes, rueters decided fun portray SinoVac worthless.

Yes, ""somehow"" wink wink.

We know reason why. part cold war/ media war/ info war resorted telling lies brainwash population.

Just common sense/ logic already dispell almost 90% claim China.

In case sinovac, literally made way VACCINES last 70 years made. sinovac doesnt work, neither thousands thousands vaccines getting last 70 years! 

Do people even understand crazy claims are. Nope lol least NYC, Staten Island making large portion new cases. Republican area low vaccination rates. pdf might digital signature...and case actually quite hard forge sucks new deadlier variant came everyone started getting vaccinated. Yolo county sucks say, develop vaccine stops asymptomatic spread vaccinated Covid always Sure, assumes people actually ever RTFA. I.. doubts. Except kids 12 going magicaly infect without adult chain, likly unvaxed one.

Even spreads bunch kids camp infect highly vacinated set adult parents, infect even vaxed parents.

Keeps chain pretty small. Correct. takes 6 months data order apply full-use approval. March 

Vaccine makers started applying full FDA approval **May/June**. [A simple search shows 

Fauci doesn‚Äôt anything FDA approval process. say FDA‚Äôs timeline. never hasn‚Äôt claimed otherwise.

Please quit saying ‚Äúbut Fauci said.‚Äù It‚Äôs lazy argument.  Controlling viral spread everyone's interest.

Where say otherwise?

You missed point. people wanted get vaccinated beginning couldn't. US government giving Pfizer *tons money*. developed world-saving vaccine, rewarded handsomely that. penny-pinch, fewer firms want go limb future.

But case, no, money grab. think two things happen:

1. 10 children life support one state really huge number compared pandemic large, given deaths American children month pandemic 49.
2. People feel bad kids suffer especially now, kids 12 still can't get vaccine teens may constrained antivax parents. suspect sympathy adults dying COVID America very, low self-inflicted. 

None changes saying, even Delta serious, absolute number children life support/dying COVID remains low relative numbers going sound scarier are. phenomenon vaccines training child's immune system fight one disease, immune system might possibly gain ""muscles"" training improve ability fight diseases similar effect? incredibly French headline lmao need go back lockdown create vaccine-resistant variant.

I think that's necessary. version virus evades vaccines exceedingly unlikely mRNA vaccines work. wall need build inside borders. still right, though. infected vaccined individual far likely ""create"" vaccine resistant strains infected unvaccinated individual. Remeber said Sputnik one year ago media? ""A bad vaccine worse vaccine, makes immune evasion likely harm vaccination efforts"". Mississippian here. Mississippi used sensible vaccinations; it‚Äôs one states still strict vaccination requirements school enrollment. fully expect requirement become collateral damage current COVID vaccination debate scrapped completely near future, leading surges kinds fun childhood diseases. actually pretty interesting think about. vaccinating children 12 inadvertently nudge COVID (or COVID variants evolving US) evolutionary path select younger hosts? 

Or perhaps partially vaccinated population we're forcing newer virulent strains evolve outside US go straight easiest hosts - young kids. Yeah, reaction ""god assholes"" instead ""that's weird I'll take else do?"" maybe question whether actually care public health care side right. sounds lot like last year, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt celebrate Halloween/thanksgiving/Christmas year celebrate next year. People done, lots us got vaccinated comfortable risk point returned old lives, is, I‚Äôm sorry upsets people makes bad person. family friends vaccinated point. pharmacy generally closes different time actual CVS worth. Yes do. right quit job infringe rights patients want covid infection dirty ass. would really serious they're twelve years old. total vax percentage important gauging safety ones tell percent *eligible* people vaxxed important evaluating policy like. sounds right. maybe even less. people set goalpost ""Well, soon received OFFICIAL approval I'll get it"" mostly pick goalposts move another hundred yards set inscrutable requirement. met, they'll move again. 
 
We've pretty much reached point (in US least) anyone opportunity get vaccine (as right age group, allergic reaction medical restriction) STILL vaccinated point, likely never will. percent here, fraction percent last holdouts persuaded get (probably keep jobs, visit relatives something like - reluctantly).  
 
Most holdouts, point, remain holdouts, regardless vaccine fully approved not. think thing would move needle point would certain orange-colored individual go vocal, extended public media campaign berating anyone vaccinated. hold breath ever happening. Fixed thanks kids get sick? still count, sutely point course really matter post-vax covid worse flu season. However bad is, that's good gonna get. country seriously going shit. nothing culture war bullshit.  US significant increase number cases since winter surge. increase 33% sometime March April, that's it. 

The deaths numbers reflect sum many probability waves. person gets COVID, chance die. However, accurately, particular chance die day X number days. certain day highest chance die, continue less less chance die every day that. 

Let's say million people get infected January 1, nobody gets infected February, 100 people get infected day. 

The deaths graph still dominated January 1 infections, continue less less deaths every day, since less less people expected die January 1 infections passing day.  
The actual February infections significant contributor February deaths, basically almost January infections resolved. 

That explanation applies see 33% increase deaths period US March/April. 

This affect still apply now, probably overpowered pretty quickly -- 220 deaths day, much compared new daily cases getting. So, time expect deaths rise. Leave France then. I‚Äôm pretty sure Missouri could use healthcare workers right now. maybe Tennessee. really want everyone vaccine free see happens. Tennessee respect right choose. Antibodies good; protect you.  want get rid them.

Antigens antibodies attack - they're bits outside virus observed immune system.

Antigen tests genetic tests look different parts virus and, patients, parts linger long stop shedding intact viruses infect others.  Based commentary real virologists TWIV podcast think process well understood I'm afraid likely anything try stay healthy.  Mississippi ranks really badly lot public health factors (infant mortality, maternal outcomes birth, obesity, diabetes, asthma believe)‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs possible kids Mississippi generally less healthy kids places likely underlying conditions leave extra-vulnerable covid  don‚Äôt rights. president mandated need vaccine continue career. Life full things right. 

I downvoted saying before. saying again. Vaccination choice. choice life consequences. 

I think french sensible.  UK won‚Äôt recognise simply due administered Germany? even ""working way through"" nearly devastating. truly terrible month 0-17 deaths COVID like...20 people. Whereas almost 1000 people 85+ died COVID last month, three times entire COVID death toll American children. Again, point still going  Selfish target government innoculate national capital region nearby provinces. need 108 million doses. Right shifting Pfizer, Moderna JnJ. Idk I'd rather live benevolent dictator ungoverned thunderdome like Somalia limited ultra low temp storage. There's like notice much stock coming is. extremely well put friend exactly. You‚Äôre hiding main point implied officials changing language comes vaccine efficacy. Early health officials excited data suggests vaccines actually prevent infection produce asymptomatic cases. seems standard dropped considerably conversation turned idea might catch get sick,  many people hospitalized. interviewee also said people co-morbidities elderly may need booster. government means direct enforcement. tell federal employees military vaccinate slowly reprimanded eventual termination. military especially needs due close quarters soldiers live work bases ships. Similarly OSHA could consider COVID precautions mandatory work safety issue either get employees vaccinated required masked work indefinitely. Failure would constitute violation basic worker safety companies directly fined. employers start racking fines they'll quickly crack antivaxxer bullshit amongst employees. Uh, what? That's even remotely related. literally said approval process rushed was. emergency approval process absurdly rushed even vaccine makers, CDC, etc state such.  Haha thought said country county. Please disregard note. letter R important. Unfortunately unless written record leading termination, there's much recourse: Turkmenistan one nations earth release covid data. never cared. Man people take life seriously. r going corpses 100 years, time worry billionaires? Lol. Delete Facebook. true. chance get Pfizer last year, funny thing head Department Health sat several months. Take look Indonesia also, contract sinovac confidential price allowed divulged. sure naive things here. Btw 40 million doses government finally ordered arrive August. Yeah, fully opened Vermont well. we're taking care still, like started staying home closed, give shit safety community. Thank you. you! dream leaving Florida beaches fresh snow. Lol. people insisting will. body surprised this, never Tennessee. par course basic level ignorance exists common Tennessee citizen. game out.

If order boosters turns they're superfluous (which looking dubious every week), always donate country desperate need vaccines, plenty.

If order boosters Delta turns run even wilder been, (and severe) breakthrough cases original-vaccine immunity begins wane, we'll see spiraling infection death rates, vaccine bottleneck like deal earlier year. Combine reluctance lock down, even briefly, things could get really, really ugly -- time next year's midterm elections. 

If Biden admin plan place booster shots, they'll lose next year -- deserve to. Montgomery County md

And? That's reason fully vaccinated students still wear masks, fulfill ""masks forever"" fantasy.

Giving vaccinated people privileges return normal lives best way encourage vaccination. hey, status quo. Hows going ya? I‚Äôd agree start due stored -80, wouldn‚Äôt untested 3rd doses bigger concern?

It's like data completely absent - small scale studies still better nothing. far, seems mixing &amp; matching leads higher antibodies w/e. 5 sigma confidence good thing? safe &amp; lead autoimmune issues? seem like we're yet.

We data previous vaccines (I'm aware mixing &amp; matching bad). know danger covid running rampant. Many governments supply limited, unreasonable gamble mix &amp; match strategy (like Britain gambled ""more 1st shots"" rather standard ""more fully vaccinated""). I'm qualified say whether that's good bad idea, seem bit paranoid side.
